[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.850
PAUL KINLAN: Hi, guys.

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:31.690
I'm Paul Kinlan.

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:33.590
And I'm a developer advocate
at Google.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.420
And today we're doing the GDL
Presents, Google Developers

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.890
Live Presents, about the Chrome
Web Lab experiment.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.860
I think it's the first of our
current set of Hangouts that

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:43.630
we're going to run.

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:45.730
And with me I've got
Roger and Matias?

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:46.780
MATIAS: Yep, that's correct.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:47.500
PAUL KINLAN: Matias,
brilliant.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.210
I got them with me.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.290
And they worked on
the project.

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:50.890
So if you want to give
yourselves a little bit of an

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.300
introduction, and--

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.840
ROGER: Yeah, I'm Roger.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.190
I'm a creative technologist
at [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.810
And I've been the technical
leader of the project.

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:00.770
PAUL KINLAN: Cool.

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.420
MATIAS: Yeah, I'm Matias.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.815
And I'm a creative technologist
as well, and also

00:01:04.815 --> 00:01:05.480
at [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.710
And I mainly focused on the
Orchestra in the Web Lab.

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.670
PAUL KINLAN: Oh cool, so what's
your day-to-day like at

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.340
the moment, your kind
of average day?

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:21.100
ROGER: I was managing other
developers and doing some

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.200
programming as well, as well
as setting a little bit the

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.360
rules in terms of programming.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.350
PAUL KINLAN: The technical
direction and everything.

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:30.560
ROGER: Yeah, a little bit.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.220
And handling a lot the client
requests as well, making sure

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.210
that you guys were happy
with everything.

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.070
PAUL KINLAN: Sweet,
I'm always happy.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.750
So thanks.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.050
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.330
ROGER: And that's it actually.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.685
MATIAS: And I was more into
the code, writing both the

00:01:49.685 --> 00:01:51.080
front end and the back end.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.570
PAUL KINLAN: Oh, sweet.

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.660
MATIAS: For the Orchestra
and interfacing with the

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.130
instruments.

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:56.830
PAUL KINLAN: Sweet, so we'll
just do a little bit of a

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.470
brief introduction about
Web Lab itself.

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.850
So Web Lab is a series of five
real world Chrome experiments

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.140
that live on the web and also in
the British Science Museum.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.750
And I don't know how long
it's been-- it's been in

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.715
development for quite a long
time now, hasn't it?

00:02:09.715 --> 00:02:11.860
But essentially you can go to
the British Science Museum

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.300
today and start experimenting
with the experiments in the

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.260
real world.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.220
And today we're going to
talk mainly about the--

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.880
I'd say the virtual world, but
the online web experience.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:23.780
So you could be--

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.780
the way I always liked to pitch
this was you could be

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.510
actually in the museum
interacting with the

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.200
experiment through the browser
right there, walk 10 feet

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.020
away, still be interacting with
it, walk into the next

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.680
room, and still interact with
it in the same way that you

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.890
would if you were
at the museum.

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.360
And then you go all the way over
to Google I/O last year.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.180
And then you're 7,000 miles
away in San Francisco.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.460
And you're still interacting
with the experiments in the

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:47.570
same type of way.

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:48.550
I think that's a fair
assumption.

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:49.120
MATIAS: Yeah.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.450
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, it's
a fair summary.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.670
So we're going to go through the
actual experiments today.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.550
We're going to go through
one which is

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.290
called the Lab Tag Explorer.

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.390
And the lab tag itself is kind
of-- it's the core component

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.550
of Web Lab, isn't it really?

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.520
So if you want to give a little
bit of background on

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.825
what Web Lab-- or not Web Lab,
but the lab tag means to you.

00:03:07.825 --> 00:03:12.310
ROGER: Yeah, so in Web Lab we
wanted to represent people,

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.090
people that is interacting
with it at all time.

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.150
And a lab tag is your
identification in Web Lab.

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.690
So it's something kind of like
an avatar where you can store

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.050
all the content that you're
generating in Web Lab.

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.030
PAUL KINLAN: Cool, and if you
look at the screen right now,

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.220
we have these two streams.

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.180
Are these real-time streams
or are these random?

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.960
ROGER: Yeah, they are
generated by code.

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:46.840
And one stream represents
the online people.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:47.170
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:49.200
ROGER: And the other one the
people that is interacting in

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:49.780
the museum.

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.920
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, and these
are all lab tags that are

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.170
streaming across?

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.390
ROGER: It's not real data
in this stream.

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:58.330
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, OK.

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.987
ROGER: Once we go into the Lab
Tag Explorer is where we get

00:04:01.987 --> 00:04:02.730
the real data.

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.002
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, should
we have a quick look in?

00:04:05.002 --> 00:04:06.410
We'll zoom in.

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:07.180
That's pretty nice.

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.330
And how was that built?

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:09.030
Is this WebGL?

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.570
ROGER: Yeah, it is WebGL.

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.400
It is in three.js.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.110
PAUL KINLAN: And now this is
my lab tag that's getting

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.760
built right now.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.540
Can you explain a little bit
what these three symbols mean?

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.220
ROGER: Yeah, so each of the lab
tags is generated by one

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:26.190
main shape and two
more shapes.

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.460
And there's a variation on
rotation between the shape's

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.440
color and size.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.340
And under these barrier
[? rows, ?]

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.665
we can acquire millions of
different combinations.

00:04:39.665 --> 00:04:39.930
PAUL KINLAN: Millions?

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:40.100
ROGER: Yeah.

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:41.390
PAUL KINLAN: Wow, that's cool.

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:42.850
ROGER: So it does a lot.

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.020
But it's unique for it too.

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.980
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, and you also
get the lab tags online.

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:48.720
But you can get it in the
real world as well.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.800
ROGER: Yeah, the similar thing
in the museum is that you get

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.010
a badge, which you have
your lab tag [? in. ?]

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:00.430
And you can put it into each of
the experiments and collect

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:01.210
all your data.

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:01.720
PAUL KINLAN: Right.

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.910
ROGER: And once you go back
home, then you can use your

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:08.825
webcam to scan this badge and
receive all the contents that

00:05:08.825 --> 00:05:10.830
you have generated.

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.830
PAUL KINLAN: I just want to
cover how do you interact with

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:13.420
the webcam?

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:16.030
Is that Flash or is
it getUserMedia?

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:19.620
ROGER: Yeah, that specific
bit of code was Flash.

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:20.200
PAUL KINLAN: Was Flash.

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.080
Is it Flash still?

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.670
ROGER: It was this morning.

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:24.030
PAUL KINLAN: OK, cool.

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.250
ROGER: There are other things
in Web Lab that have been

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:27.360
using [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.930
That's the specific one.

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:30.680
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, I think
this has been a really

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.840
interesting experiment, really
where we've been trying to

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.030
push the boundaries
of what's been

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:35.900
possible inside the browser.

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.950
And there are some limits
that we've come up to.

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:41.650
And I think in a later Hangout
that we're going to run where

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:46.370
we talk about the Sketchbots,
we use getUserMedia.

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:50.580
I think, to actually take a
picture of the person from the

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:51.660
webcam using JavaScript.

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:53.950
Where in this case, we probably
used Flash, right?

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:54.450
ROGER: Yeah.

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:55.610
PAUL KINLAN: I think
this is basically--

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:57.970
there are some things right on
the web that we can't just do

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:00.110
purely nakedly inside the
browser right now.

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.250
And we have to do a fallback.

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:05.750
But the theme, it's a
relatively seamless

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:06.626
experience, right?

00:06:06.626 --> 00:06:09.010
MATIAS: Yeah, and as you
mentioned before, it's been in

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:10.540
production for a long time.

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:15.310
So when we started with it, we
couldn't use getUserMedia.

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:17.080
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, I actually
remember talking to you guys

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.540
and saying, you know,
getUserMedia is going to be in

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:21.430
the browser in two
months' time.

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:23.710
And then in two months' time,
yeah, it's going to be in the

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:25.310
browser again in two
months' time.

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:27.315
So the really cool thing at
least about Chrome and I

00:06:27.315 --> 00:06:29.650
believe Firefox as well
now and Opera, we have

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:33.490
getUserMedia, which allows
us to get the user media.

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:34.390
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:35.665
PAUL KINLAN: That's really
bad, isn't it?

00:06:35.665 --> 00:06:38.860
And they allow us to basically
get access to the webcam data

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:40.610
just by JavaScript.

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:41.730
We're not going to
see that today.

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:44.250
We're going to go straight into
the Lab Tag Explorer.

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:46.570
You know, I actually really like
this whole fun screen.

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:49.240
It's [? beautiful. ?]

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.610
Sorry, I'm just going completely
off track.

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:52.050
That's fine.

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:54.320
Cool, so the Lab Tag Explorer,
let's jump

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:57.040
into the Lab Tag Explorer.

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.870
So we were saying before-- oh,
this is beautiful, very nice

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:00.730
loading screens.

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:02.340
So what's happening in the
background at the moment?

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:03.050
Is this--

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:06.490
ROGER: So this just loading
all the specific bits for

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:08.340
these experiments.

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:10.170
PAUL KINLAN: So do you kind of
cache everything locally in

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:11.180
the user's machine?

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:12.010
ROGER: Ah, no.

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:13.990
PAUL KINLAN: Or is it just
basically saying, we're

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:14.730
loading everything.

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:16.987
When it's unload or
[? DOM ?] content

00:07:16.987 --> 00:07:18.526
ready, essentially we--

00:07:18.526 --> 00:07:19.774
ROGER: Yeah, this has
everything, yeah.

00:07:19.774 --> 00:07:21.700
PAUL KINLAN: That actually
looks really nice.

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:24.270
You'd normally see
a big white page.

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:25.500
So that's kind of interesting.

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:27.160
That's one of the things I've
been trying to work with

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:29.990
developers on is provide these
relatively seamless

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:30.640
experiences.

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:32.980
Don't let the user see that
things are loading

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:34.320
incrementally in
the background.

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:35.720
Sometimes with documents
it's fine.

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.380
But I think for applications
and those types of

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:40.670
experiences, it breaks
away from it.

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:42.130
So should we just describe
what's happening on the

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:42.840
screen right now?

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:46.730
ROGER: Yeah, so these
experiments is all about

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:50.390
exploring the content that all
the users have been using.

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:53.820
So as I mentioned, each of these
little things is a lab

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:55.770
tag, which represents a user.

00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:57.030
PAUL KINLAN: Ah, I see, cool.

00:07:57.030 --> 00:07:59.530
ROGER: In this view, we can
see the people who are

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:02.430
actually interacting with
Web Lab in this

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:03.580
precise moment of time.

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:04.230
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:05.980
ROGER: You can see that there's
two streams, one for

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:09.780
the museum people and another
one for the people who are

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:11.010
interacting online.

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:12.780
PAUL KINLAN: So the really cool
thing, and I'd encourage

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:15.300
anyone who can get to the
British Science Museum in

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:18.390
London, is that when you go into
the museum, you see these

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:21.420
lab tags falling from the
ceiling right down to the

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:22.130
floor, don't you?

00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:23.480
It's really nice.

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:25.800
ROGER: You have the same
experience that we've been

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.420
seeing in the online.

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:31.150
There it's represented
in a very big screen.

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:33.059
PAUL KINLAN: So I saw some kind
of lines come up before

00:08:33.059 --> 00:08:35.010
when I clicked on someone
from the US.

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:35.330
ROGER: Yeah.

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:35.879
PAUL KINLAN: There we go.

00:08:35.879 --> 00:08:38.470
ROGER: They're showing some
connections between them.

00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:38.710
PAUL KINLAN: Nice.

00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:42.409
ROGER: Some people probably
they are having lunch.

00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:47.080
Or people who are interacting
with Orchestra, some different

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:50.540
data, data visualization
of the users.

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:51.160
PAUL KINLAN: That's
really cool.

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:53.135
And these are actually
live users now?

00:08:53.135 --> 00:08:53.410
ROGER: Yeah.

00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:54.900
PAUL KINLAN: People who are
going or recently interacted

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:55.830
with a Sketchbot.

00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:56.260
ROGER: Yeah.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.670
PAUL KINLAN: That's pretty
cool, isn't it?

00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:03.600
MATIAS: And also, these items
flying by, it's--

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:09.200
we choose half an hour
ago all that has

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.070
interacted since that part.

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:12.250
So it's constantly updating.

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:14.970
And you can sit for hours
and just look

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:15.990
what people are doing.

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:17.780
PAUL KINLAN: This is really
cool, isn't it?

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:21.210
So just to talk about some of
the technology about this,

00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:23.490
this is based on the user's
rough location.

00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:27.570
Is this using App Engine's
request notification or the

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:30.620
requests country location
information?

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:32.290
Or is there some
other type of--

00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:33.670
ROGER: No, well, [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:36.245 --> 00:09:41.180
But I think they finally used
some kind of custom built

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:43.130
system to get the information.

00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:44.310
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, so it just
basically finds the country

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:45.650
and then maps it on.

00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:45.920
ROGER: Yeah.

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:46.480
PAUL KINLAN: That's
pretty nice.

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:49.850
So the client side technology
in this, this is

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:50.930
all WebGL as well?

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:51.270
ROGER: This is WebGL.

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:53.880
This is using three.js,
the same.

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:57.090
And we've been trying to--

00:09:57.090 --> 00:09:59.910
for the movement of them,
for the animation--

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:03.230
we've been using steering
behaviors.

00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:04.650
PAUL KINLAN: OK.

00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:10.780
ROGER: And as you can see,
there's some behaviors for

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:12.300
them to feel a little
bit alive.

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:15.130
But at the same time, they
all follow this path.

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:16.760
PAUL KINLAN: I kind of like how
they've just tried to get

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:18.090
themselves around where
my mouse was.

00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:19.720
ROGER: Yeah, we're
in level one.

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:25.820
So this is a nice interesting
bit which in 3D, it's quite

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:30.830
tricky to go from the 2D
world to the 3D world.

00:10:30.830 --> 00:10:33.390
For example, the mouse
is in the 2D world.

00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:35.900
And then you next interact with
some objects that live in

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:37.840
this 3D world.

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:40.870
But three.js makes
it very easy to.

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:43.080
PAUL KINLAN: OK, so is that
one of the reasons why you

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:44.840
chose three.js in
this project?

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:49.020
ROGER: Yeah, basically without
three.js and with the time

00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:50.470
that we've had, it would
have been impossible.

00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:53.086
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, does Mr.
[? Dupe ?] know that we--

00:10:53.086 --> 00:10:54.660
ROGER: Yeah, we've
been talking.

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:56.761
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, he's
cool, isn't he?

00:10:56.761 --> 00:10:57.190
That's cool.

00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:57.900
That's really interesting.

00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:00.380
So these are kind of like
voids essentially?

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:01.350
ROGER: Yeah, they are.

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:04.340
Each of them is like a void.

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:06.500
PAUL KINLAN: And did you notice
any performance issues?

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:09.850
I mean, you're streaming quite
a lot of data across the

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:11.010
screen at the moment.

00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:12.515
Were there any performance
issues when you

00:11:12.515 --> 00:11:12.920
were building this?

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:13.650
ROGER: Yeah, there
was actually.

00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:18.750
So these are all sprites,
each of the lab tags.

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:19.660
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:21.690
ROGER: But if you use
one texture--

00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:23.530
you see that animation?

00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:23.740
PAUL KINLAN: Mhmm.

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:27.120
ROGER: So how this animation
is done is using a

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:28.010
spreadsheet.

00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:29.180
PAUL KINLAN: Yep.

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:33.760
ROGER: And if we were using just
one spreadsheet per each

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:37.730
particle, it was impossible
to create this

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:39.210
with so many particles.

00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:43.840
So what we ended up using,
it's a system where we

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:47.340
generate textures as
big as they can.

00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:54.860
Taking in browsers, I think it's
a canvas of 2,048 pixels.

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:55.660
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:59.290
ROGER: And then we fit in as
many lab tags as we can, as

00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:02.890
many lab tag sprites per
each of the lab tags.

00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:07.280
And then we have some kind of
easy system with some indexes

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:08.210
to access them.

00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:12.640
So we're using one or two
very big textures.

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:17.550
And we use UV mapping and
UV offset to access

00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:19.612
each of the lab tags.

00:12:19.612 --> 00:12:20.910
PAUL KINLAN: That's
pretty cool.

00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:23.850
So I've actually just clicked
on one of the lab tags.

00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:25.550
And we've got this little screen
up here, which is the

00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:26.530
lab report.

00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:28.570
Can you explain a little bit
about the lab report?

00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:30.180
I think you might have
done it at the start.

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:37.300
ROGER: Yeah, so the lab report
is what records all your

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:38.010
interactions.

00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:40.660
So you can find all your content
that you've been

00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:43.320
generating in Web Lab
in the lab report.

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:43.855
PAUL KINLAN: That's pretty
cool, isn't it?

00:12:43.855 --> 00:12:47.350
MATIAS: And some things need
video to render recordings

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:50.540
from the museum, if you draw
yourself in the sand with a

00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:52.740
sand robot for our Sketchbots.

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:54.110
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:56.680
MATIAS: And the Orchestra
records you and gives you back

00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:58.000
a video as well.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.190
So they may take
time to render.

00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:04.130
So you will see a progress here
and can come back at any

00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:06.450
point and view your
recordings.

00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:07.490
PAUL KINLAN: That's pretty
cool, isn't it?

00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:08.340
That's very nice.

00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:10.600
That's one of the things I
really liked about the whole

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:11.630
Web Lab experience.

00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:13.750
I took my kids there.

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:15.170
Well, one is only two.

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:17.690
And he couldn't do anything.

00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:19.680
But Jack is six going
on seven now.

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:20.880
And he absolutely
loved the place.

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:21.860
He had his little lab tag.

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:23.400
He checked into every
single thing.

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:27.480
We got back home, put the lab
tag in front of the screen.

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:28.880
And we could share it today.

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:33.090
But I haven't got a lab tag from
my experience when I was

00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:34.090
at the museum itself.

00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:36.990
But yeah, we got it all back up
on the screen pretty much

00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:38.050
straight away.

00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:40.766
It was a beautiful experience
really.

00:13:40.766 --> 00:13:43.960
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:44.750
So we have this other section.

00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:46.980
Sorry, I just want to jump
in the other location.

00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:48.731
Here we go.

00:13:48.731 --> 00:13:49.981
That's beautiful that.

00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:56.870
MATIAS: And here we're loading
a lot of data, for many days

00:13:56.870 --> 00:13:57.610
back in time.

00:13:57.610 --> 00:13:58.350
PAUL KINLAN: Right, OK.

00:13:58.350 --> 00:14:02.220
MATIAS: And generating
spreadsheets for this as well.

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:02.940
ROGER: Yeah.

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:05.310
PAUL KINLAN: So this is probably
a silly question.

00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:07.070
How is the data stored
in the back end?

00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:09.970
Is it all in App Engine?

00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:12.300
Or is it in MySQL databases?

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:13.440
ROGER: It's in App Engine.

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:14.640
PAUL KINLAN: Oh, OK, cool.

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:17.140
So you record everything that
happens into App Engine and

00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:18.380
then haul it back.

00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:20.080
When you bring it back,
is it JSON?

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:21.580
ROGER: Yeah, it really
is JSON.

00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:22.610
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:24.940
ROGER: And it's amazing
how all the [? VI ?]

00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:26.110
JavaScript in [? time ?]

00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:27.650
is working.

00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:29.650
And it's so fast, so, so fast.

00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:31.960
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, so how many
data points would you normally

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:34.135
bring back do you
think in that?

00:14:34.135 --> 00:14:36.090
Because it took about five
seconds to bring everything

00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:36.820
back, is it?

00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:40.200
ROGER: Yeah, it depends a little
in the graphic and

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:40.500
everything.

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:44.260
But I don't have any numbers
where it's thousands of them.

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:47.320
And in each of them, there's
lots of information.

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:48.880
PAUL KINLAN: So you're
saying it goes back

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:49.590
over a couple of days.

00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:52.310
So we can, in theory jump
back over time.

00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:52.610
ROGER: Yeah.

00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:54.080
PAUL KINLAN: So can you explain
a little bit how you

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:56.690
actually built this little
time sequence thing?

00:14:56.690 --> 00:15:00.660
Is it just a series of planes
that you put into a 3D space?

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:01.520
Or is it--

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:05.550
ROGER: Yeah, it's basically,
everything is contained in a

00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:06.490
3D container.

00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:08.380
PAUL KINLAN: Yep.

00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:09.790
ROGER: So we don't
move the camera.

00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:12.020
We just move this container
up and down.

00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:17.530
And it creates this effect
of going back in time.

00:15:17.530 --> 00:15:19.550
PAUL KINLAN: Oh, so you
just move the camera?

00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:20.850
ROGER: No, so the camera--

00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:21.530
PAUL KINLAN: It's fixed.

00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:22.080
ROGER: It's not moving.

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:25.155
And then we have a 3D container
that just moves.

00:15:25.155 --> 00:15:26.280
PAUL KINLAN: I got you.

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:26.830
That's pretty cool.

00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:31.480
So if I look at it in this
projection, is it everything

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:32.400
prior to this time?

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:34.390
Or is it just at this
point in time?

00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:36.350
ROGER: So this is at
this point of time.

00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:40.770
And then if you scroll to the
left, it goes back in time.

00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:43.800
And you can see that it goes.

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:45.640
PAUL KINLAN: And this is all
data that we've pulled, that's

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:46.600
been pulled back?

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:49.940
ROGER: Yeah, and when you're
scrolling, we're actually

00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:51.970
simplifying it a little
bit because there

00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:53.390
were too many points.

00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:53.630
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah.

00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:54.660
ROGER: And it was becoming--

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:55.940
PAUL KINLAN: So it looked
like coalescent

00:15:55.940 --> 00:15:56.620
points in the beginning.

00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:58.340
ROGER: Yeah, so there's less
points when you scroll and

00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:01.202
then when you release
all of them.

00:16:01.202 --> 00:16:01.670
PAUL KINLAN: Excellent.

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:04.960
Yeah, that's so cool.

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:06.440
[INAUDIBLE].

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:06.930
Cool.

00:16:06.930 --> 00:16:08.720
ROGER: It's very interesting
to see the different flows.

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:09.870
PAUL KINLAN: This is, yeah.

00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:12.600
ROGER: Different days
and locations.

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:13.120
PAUL KINLAN: All right.

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:16.270
I'm just going to play with this
for a little bit longer.

00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:18.260
Man, that's insane.

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:21.400
That's a lot of interaction,
isn't it?

00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:24.230
Cool, so I think we're
close to the end.

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:25.540
I mean, is there anything else
you want to say about this

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:29.300
experiment, like technical
challenges that

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:31.140
you might have faced?

00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:33.170
MATIAS: Yeah, the performance.

00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:35.940
We tried to run their
location [? U ?]

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:39.920
and had debugged data
from the start.

00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:42.270
And it was a set number
of points.

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:43.650
And it went fine all the time.

00:16:43.650 --> 00:16:45.290
And then we started trying it.

00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:48.640
And it crashed directly because
we were filling it up

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:50.720
too fast, too fast
with points.

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:55.090
But yeah, smart solutions
and limiting the data.

00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:57.675
PAUL KINLAN: Yeah, so all the
coalescence and everything.

00:16:57.675 --> 00:16:58.080
MATIAS: Yeah.

00:16:58.080 --> 00:16:58.945
PAUL KINLAN: That's
pretty cool.

00:16:58.945 --> 00:17:00.950
Well, it's beautiful guys.

00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:01.550
Congratulations.

00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:03.050
