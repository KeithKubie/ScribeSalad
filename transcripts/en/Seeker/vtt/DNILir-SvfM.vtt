00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:02.000
Was Venus once a tropical oasis?

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.330
Did it once have LIFE?

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.859
Well, if it did, it doesn’t any more because
it’s a HELLHOLE.

00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:13.650
Hello 
fellow terrestrial lifeforms!

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.930
Trace here for DNews and I want you to consider
Venus.

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:22.340
Apparently that nasty, hot and toxic world
is Earth’s “twin”, its EVIL twin.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.860
Venus is around 80% the mass of Earth.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.090
Earth and Venus have similar orbits and are
likely made of similar materials.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.770
In fact, Venus may have been once surprisingly
Earth-like!

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.870
It sits on the inner edge of our solar system’s
habitable zone and could have even been a

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:36.929
veritable oasis!

00:00:36.929 --> 00:00:41.059
It's even thought that Venus could have once
had oceans!

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:45.479
But today Venus has an atmosphere that crushes
everything on its surface with about 90 times

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:47.519
more pressure we experience here.

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:49.839
It’s so hot that lead will melt.

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:53.629
It’s a planet where the greenhouse effect
has gone into overdrive and probably is the

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:57.359
last place in the solar system you’d consider
for your next vacay.

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:01.729
See, something catastrophic happened to the
planet’s atmosphere, causing it to turn

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:06.950
into a swirling hot mess and, as Venus receives
around double the solar energy of Earth, the

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.560
water content in its atmosphere was eventually
broken down through a process called photodissociation.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.820
Today, the planet is bone dry.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.229
But again, we think it wasn't always this
way.

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:23.430
In the journal Geophysical Research Letters,
scientists used 3-D models of Venus and simulated

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.229
how its atmosphere would evolve if the planet
had an ocean containing 10% the volume of

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.630
our oceans on Earth.

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.701
What they found was that because of Venus’
super slow rotation rate (it takes 243 Earth

00:01:34.701 --> 00:01:40.550
days to complete one Venus day) and the fact
our sun was cooler in the past, the planet

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.780
would have actually been pretty habitable
for a very long period of time -- possibly

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.240
for billions of years!

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.210
This is even considering the fact that our
sun got hotter as it got older.

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.679
In fact, this research says Venus could have
been a habitable world as recently as 700

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:55.939
million years ago.12, 13

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:57.570
That’s not that much time.

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.140
This is surprising because until now, it had
been assumed that Venus’ closer orbit around

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.049
the sun would have caused atmospheric temperatures
to soar and any oceans to boil away billions

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.100
of years ago.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.980
What they wanted to find out was how young
Venus regulated its temperature.

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.860
And interestingly, to do this, researchers
used the same models we use today to simulate

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.320
the effects of human-driven climate change.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.190
These models predict that water vapor forming
clouds in Venus’ atmosphere would have prevented

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.150
the sun’s extreme heat from driving atmospheric
temperatures too high, allowing the planet

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.190
to remain very Earth-like for billions of
years12.

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.780
And when you combine habitable temperatures
with liquid water and billions of years, you

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.660
get the possibility of the evolution of life!

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.070
Sadly, we may never know if Venus once possessed
life, as it’s currently almost impossible

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.000
for us to land a robot on the surface and
expect it not to melt.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.540
Though we have had landers there before, none
have lasted for longer than a couple of hours.

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.910
But this research shows that planets found
around other stars with orbits that were once

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.580
considered “too hot” to be habitable,
may in fact have atmospheres cool and stable

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.240
enough for life to take hold.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:07.210
This is awesome and may increase the number
of potentially habitable worlds in our galaxy!

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:11.240
Guys, if you love DNews in English -- gracias
por tu apoyo!

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.860
Now, we've got a new sister show, "DNews en
Español" -- It's DNews, but in Spanish!

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:29.440
If you like space, but want it to be more
espace: ¿Qué pasa si te traga un agujero

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.440
negro?

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.790
Check it out here.

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.530
Venus might sound pretty crappy for life,
but we’ve found a possibly more habitable

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:44.140
world on our galactic doorstep -- welcome
to Proxima b:

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:58.110
What do you guys think?

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:03.920
Would you rather go to Venus or Mars?
