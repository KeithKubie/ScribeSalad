may not know whether you were destined
 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.410
may not know whether you were destined

for paradise but if you did well in this
 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.289
for paradise but if you did well in this
world it would appear to improve the

another one back here the problem is
 

00:39:36.059 --> 00:39:38.900
another one back here the problem is
that if you are going to pivot the front

00:39:38.900 --> 00:39:38.910
that if you are going to pivot the front
 

00:39:38.910 --> 00:39:41.960
that if you are going to pivot the front
axle as soon as you start to turn the

enough you can provide for a substantial
 

00:39:55.500 --> 00:39:59.000
enough you can provide for a substantial
angle of turn but then you have a very

angle of turn but then you have a very
 

00:39:59.010 --> 00:40:04.359
angle of turn but then you have a very
wide axle in a rather narrow body and

wide axle in a rather narrow body and
 

00:40:04.369 --> 00:40:08.270
wide axle in a rather narrow body and
kind of a waste of your space but you

00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:08.280
kind of a waste of your space but you
 

00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:11.210
kind of a waste of your space but you
can do it the the angle that you can

can do it the the angle that you can
 

00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:13.789
can do it the the angle that you can
turn out before it hits the body is

that you have turned the front axle as

00:40:21.230 --> 00:40:21.240
that you have turned the front axle as
 

00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:24.799
that you have turned the front axle as
far as you can without you know hitting

00:40:24.799 --> 00:40:24.809
far as you can without you know hitting
 

00:40:24.809 --> 00:40:30.470

that at full lock might be able to pivot

00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:44.250
that at full lock might be able to pivot
 

00:40:44.250 --> 00:40:47.240
that at full lock might be able to pivot
to turn in a maybe a three to five

00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:47.250

and one of the things I should point out

00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:41.650
and one of the things I should point out
 

00:41:41.650 --> 00:41:44.700
and one of the things I should point out
is that this rush to have carriages in

00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:44.710
is that this rush to have carriages in
 

00:41:44.710 --> 00:41:47.960
is that this rush to have carriages in
Britain was to have carriages in town

00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:47.970
Britain was to have carriages in town
 

00:41:47.970 --> 00:41:50.490
Britain was to have carriages in town
because the roads in the country were

00:41:50.490 --> 00:41:50.500
because the roads in the country were
 

00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:51.900
because the roads in the country were
too rough

00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:51.910
too rough

traffic so you had what what could you
 

00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:06.900

do one thing you can do was to have a
 

00:42:06.910 --> 00:42:11.310
do one thing you can do was to have a
big wheel here and a small wheel here so

ways to to solve that so whenever you

00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:23.890
ways to to solve that so whenever you
 

00:42:23.890 --> 00:42:29.040

and if you're going downhill they can
hold back that same amount of weight if

hold back that same amount of weight if
 

00:44:28.990 --> 00:44:32.400
hold back that same amount of weight if
you have a larger number of animals the

you have a larger number of animals the
 

00:44:32.410 --> 00:44:33.990
you have a larger number of animals the
animals that are closest to the vehicle

00:44:33.990 --> 00:44:34.000
animals that are closest to the vehicle

can hold back more weight than the ones
that are farther away you don't have a

that are farther away you don't have a
 

00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:40.980
that are farther away you don't have a
very efficient braking mechanism but you

00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:40.990
very efficient braking mechanism but you
 

00:44:40.990 --> 00:44:42.480
very efficient braking mechanism but you
can carry more and more weight in the

00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:42.490
can carry more and more weight in the
 

00:44:42.490 --> 00:44:44.520
can carry more and more weight in the
vehicle because you have more more and

more animals pulling up because of the
 

00:44:46.030 --> 00:44:48.510
more animals pulling up because of the
new harnessing so you had to devise ways

00:44:48.510 --> 00:44:48.520
new harnessing so you had to devise ways
 

00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:52.890
new harnessing so you had to devise ways
to to brake the vehicle as it was going

00:44:52.890 --> 00:44:52.900
to to brake the vehicle as it was going
 

00:44:52.900 --> 00:44:57.300
to to brake the vehicle as it was going
down hill and so we have various new

00:44:57.300 --> 00:44:57.310
down hill and so we have various new
 

00:44:57.310 --> 00:45:01.620
down hill and so we have various new
theories of braking such as to to lock

00:45:01.620 --> 00:45:01.630
theories of braking such as to to lock
 

00:45:01.630 --> 00:45:04.320
theories of braking such as to to lock
the wheel so it won't turn and be one

the wheel so it won't turn and be one
 

00:45:04.330 --> 00:45:07.190
the wheel so it won't turn and be one
way of breaking another way would be to

00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:07.200
way of breaking another way would be to
 

00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:09.990
way of breaking another way would be to
basically throw out an anchor so you're

00:45:09.990 --> 00:45:10.000
basically throw out an anchor so you're
 

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:11.820
basically throw out an anchor so you're
dragging something behind you that will

00:45:11.820 --> 00:45:11.830
dragging something behind you that will
 

00:45:11.830 --> 00:45:15.300
dragging something behind you that will
slow you down there is the fear of

00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:15.310
slow you down there is the fear of
 

00:45:15.310 --> 00:45:17.490
slow you down there is the fear of
course that when you're going uphill and

00:45:17.490 --> 00:45:17.500
course that when you're going uphill and
 

00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:19.910
course that when you're going uphill and
you stop you'll slide backwards again

00:45:19.910 --> 00:45:19.920
you stop you'll slide backwards again
 

00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:22.710
you stop you'll slide backwards again
this is for carriages in San Francisco

00:45:22.710 --> 00:45:22.720
this is for carriages in San Francisco
 

00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:25.290
this is for carriages in San Francisco
and so they have the idea that if you

00:45:25.290 --> 00:45:25.300
and so they have the idea that if you
 

00:45:25.300 --> 00:45:27.540
and so they have the idea that if you
put out a pointed stick that has the

00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:27.550
put out a pointed stick that has the
 

00:45:27.550 --> 00:45:29.280
put out a pointed stick that has the
right angle you won't go backwards

00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:29.290
right angle you won't go backwards
 

00:45:29.290 --> 00:45:30.480
right angle you won't go backwards
because it will dig into the pavement

00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:30.490
because it will dig into the pavement
 

00:45:30.490 --> 00:45:31.960
because it will dig into the pavement
which is there's no pain

00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:31.970
which is there's no pain
 

00:45:31.970 --> 00:45:34.210
which is there's no pain
dig into the dirt so you have a whole

00:45:34.210 --> 00:45:34.220
dig into the dirt so you have a whole
 

00:45:34.220 --> 00:45:36.010
dig into the dirt so you have a whole
bunch of theories on breaking and then

00:45:36.010 --> 00:45:36.020
bunch of theories on breaking and then
 

00:45:36.020 --> 00:45:37.300
bunch of theories on breaking and then
of course the one where you have a huge

00:45:37.300 --> 00:45:37.310
of course the one where you have a huge
 

00:45:37.310 --> 00:45:39.760
of course the one where you have a huge
lever you pull on the lever and it rubs

00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:39.770
lever you pull on the lever and it rubs
 

00:45:39.770 --> 00:45:42.190
lever you pull on the lever and it rubs
against the wheel and slows down the

00:45:42.190 --> 00:45:42.200
against the wheel and slows down the
 

00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:44.560
against the wheel and slows down the
rotation of the wheel so braking is

00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:44.570
rotation of the wheel so braking is
 

00:45:44.570 --> 00:45:46.500
rotation of the wheel so braking is
another thing that you have with

00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:46.510
another thing that you have with
 

00:45:46.510 --> 00:45:48.580
another thing that you have with
four-wheel vehicles and you don't have

00:45:48.580 --> 00:45:48.590
four-wheel vehicles and you don't have
 

00:45:48.590 --> 00:45:50.410
four-wheel vehicles and you don't have
with too little vehicles but you don't

00:45:50.410 --> 00:45:50.420
with too little vehicles but you don't
 

00:45:50.420 --> 00:45:52.210
with too little vehicles but you don't
have it before this time because before

00:45:52.210 --> 00:45:52.220
have it before this time because before
 

00:45:52.220 --> 00:45:56.140

this time the harnessing really is

00:45:56.140 --> 00:45:56.150
this time the harnessing really is
 

00:45:56.150 --> 00:45:58.630
this time the harnessing really is
almost unused exclusively with a pair of

animals that can break themselves
 

00:46:00.700 --> 00:46:04.060
animals that can break themselves
sufficiently so now you have braking

00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:04.070
sufficiently so now you have braking
 

00:46:04.070 --> 00:46:09.630
sufficiently so now you have braking
then you have the question of suspension

00:46:09.630 --> 00:46:09.640
 

00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:13.420
the surfaces that wheeled vehicles were

00:46:13.420 --> 00:46:13.430
the surfaces that wheeled vehicles were
 

00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:17.020
the surfaces that wheeled vehicles were
pulled over were generally extremely

00:46:17.020 --> 00:46:17.030
pulled over were generally extremely
 

00:46:17.030 --> 00:46:22.930

rough even when they were paved they're
 

00:46:22.940 --> 00:46:27.730
rough even when they were paved they're
often paved with cobblestones or logs or

things that were basically very very
 

00:46:30.530 --> 00:46:32.349
things that were basically very very
rough and if you were in the country

00:46:32.349 --> 00:46:32.359
rough and if you were in the country
 

00:46:32.359 --> 00:46:34.930

on a dirt road this made it extremely
 

00:46:39.980 --> 00:46:42.490
on a dirt road this made it extremely
uncomfortable for the people inside and

uncomfortable for the people inside and
 

00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:46.900

princesses of such sensibility they
 

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:00.970
princesses of such sensibility they
needed to have some kind of suspension

00:47:00.970 --> 00:47:00.980
needed to have some kind of suspension
 

00:47:00.980 --> 00:47:04.750
needed to have some kind of suspension
so we have evidence of suspension that

00:47:04.750 --> 00:47:04.760
so we have evidence of suspension that
 

00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:07.570
so we have evidence of suspension that

suspension system but then that

00:47:25.329 --> 00:47:25.339
suspension system but then that
 

00:47:25.339 --> 00:47:26.890
suspension system but then that
disappears in the medieval period and

00:47:26.890 --> 00:47:26.900
disappears in the medieval period and
 

00:47:26.900 --> 00:47:30.940
disappears in the medieval period and
reappears just as the pivoting front

00:47:30.940 --> 00:47:30.950
reappears just as the pivoting front
 

00:47:30.950 --> 00:47:34.630
reappears just as the pivoting front
axle disappears and then reappears you

00:47:34.630 --> 00:47:34.640
axle disappears and then reappears you
 

00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:37.300
axle disappears and then reappears you
have suspension disappearing and then it

00:47:37.300 --> 00:47:37.310
have suspension disappearing and then it
 

00:47:37.310 --> 00:47:44.520
have suspension disappearing and then it
it reappears it reappears basically as

uprights and then of course you can put

00:48:00.490 --> 00:48:00.500
uprights and then of course you can put
 

00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:04.360
uprights and then of course you can put
up you know the top over it so nobody

00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:04.370
up you know the top over it so nobody
 

00:48:04.370 --> 00:48:05.830
up you know the top over it so nobody
sees you riding in the hammock

00:48:05.830 --> 00:48:05.840
sees you riding in the hammock

we actually have in medieval manuscripts

00:48:09.810 --> 00:48:09.820
we actually have in medieval manuscripts
 

00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:14.230
we actually have in medieval manuscripts
images of hammocks that are suspended in

images of hammocks that are suspended in
 

00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:16.210
images of hammocks that are suspended in
this way and we have one text that

00:48:16.210 --> 00:48:16.220
this way and we have one text that
 

00:48:16.220 --> 00:48:20.400
this way and we have one text that
describes in some detail

00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:20.410
 

00:48:20.410 --> 00:48:23.590
once you have thought of the idea of

once you have thought of the idea of
 

00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:27.820
once you have thought of the idea of
suspending a hammock then it is a it's a

well instead of a hammock let us put

00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:35.210
well instead of a hammock let us put
 

00:48:35.210 --> 00:48:39.730
well instead of a hammock let us put
some chains or straps and then put a

00:48:39.730 --> 00:48:39.740
some chains or straps and then put a
 

00:48:39.740 --> 00:48:46.570
some chains or straps and then put a
passenger compartment you know and drop

00:48:46.570 --> 00:48:46.580
passenger compartment you know and drop
 

00:48:46.580 --> 00:48:49.630
passenger compartment you know and drop
it down on top of the chains or straps

00:48:49.630 --> 00:48:49.640
it down on top of the chains or straps
 

00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:54.970
it down on top of the chains or straps
and let it sway and bounce along so the

00:48:54.970 --> 00:48:54.980
and let it sway and bounce along so the
 

00:48:54.980 --> 00:48:57.360

first suspension were literally

00:48:57.360 --> 00:48:57.370
first suspension were literally
 

00:48:57.370 --> 00:49:00.190
first suspension were literally
suspensions then you had the idea that

00:49:00.190 --> 00:49:00.200
suspensions then you had the idea that
 

00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:02.950
suspensions then you had the idea that
instead of having the straps widened

00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:02.960
instead of having the straps widened
 

00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:05.770
instead of having the straps widened
have a spring so you would have a metal

00:49:05.770 --> 00:49:05.780
have a spring so you would have a metal
 

00:49:05.780 --> 00:49:08.110
have a spring so you would have a metal
spring in the place of the straps and

00:49:08.110 --> 00:49:08.120
spring in the place of the straps and
 

00:49:08.120 --> 00:49:10.090
spring in the place of the straps and
eventually you get other types of

eventually you get other types of
 

00:49:10.100 --> 00:49:12.970
eventually you get other types of
Springs we get modern suspension and all

00:49:12.970 --> 00:49:12.980
Springs we get modern suspension and all

of these were devices to to make it more

00:49:16.060 --> 00:49:16.070
of these were devices to to make it more

comfortable to ride in
 

00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:22.410
comfortable to ride in
so you have

00:49:22.420 --> 00:49:25.670
more efficient harnessing you have

steering your brakes you have suspension

00:49:30.530 --> 00:49:30.540
steering your brakes you have suspension
 

00:49:30.540 --> 00:49:33.270
steering your brakes you have suspension
