Hey guys, I'm Nate welcome back to the studio today

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.150
we're going to be taking a look at something that while fairly basic is also extremely useful

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:11.519
We're going to show you how to tie six of the most useful knots that I know and what they're good for

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.640
For tying knots all you're gonna need is a piece or two of rope and we've got that so let's get started to make handling

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.510
a little bit easier, let's just cut off a piece that's I don't know eight feet long

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:23.949
There are hundreds or probably even

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:28.499
Thousands of types of knot that have already been used and named that all have their place

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.419
but these are the six knots that I found to be most useful in my life The first type of knot we're gonna learn to

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.610
make is called the bowline it's a good knot for making a strong stable loop at the end of a rope

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:42.779
To start with your bowline measure off whatever size loop you want at the end of your rope

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:48.390
with one hand holding the rope where you want your loop to start twist a circle by grabbing one section and

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.670
lifting it up away from yourself

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.190
Take the other end of the rope and thread it through the back of the small loop you just created

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.050
Wrap the short piece of rope around the back of the long piece of rope

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:07.949
Feed the short end of the rope around the long end and then back through the front of the smaller loop

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.339
At this point you should be able to grab these three parts of the rope with one hand and the long part of the rope

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:21.090
with the other and pull it tight if the small loop running around the long end of your rope hasn't tightened all the way

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.059
Just give it a tug on the big end of the loop

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:31.438
At this point unless you're using extremely slippery rope this will hold pretty much indefinitely

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.159
It's a very stable knot that will almost never give out even if it gets wet

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.369
or is in bad conditions

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:41.909
Another advantage of the bowline is even after it's been tied for a long time or put under a lot of stress it can usually

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.609
be undone fairly easily when you want it to

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.909
There's another way to tie the bowline that won't come in handy as often, but someday you might find

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.599
It useful and it's actually a way to tie it one-handed to demonstrate

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.619
Let's clamp our rope into this vise because I need something to hold on to the other end

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.020
There we go If I remember how to do this right?

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.859
Tada to tie the one-handed bowline

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.100
I have the long end coming all the way around my waist I'm

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.779
Gonna, hold the short end of the rope with a little bit of extra play at the top now

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.540
I'll drop my hand down on top of the long end and

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.210
twist it in a circle this forms the loop that we made when we were first tying our not

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.919
We now pass the short end of the rope behind the long end

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.260
Grab it and pull our hand down through the loop. We've created

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.969
Then with some tension added to the rope it pulls itself tight

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.790
Next knot

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:56.130
we're going to learn is called the clove hitch and this is a great knot for attaching a rope to a tree or branch or

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.809
any sort of pole we have here a pole in a vise and this is what we're going to tie our rope on to

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:06.270
For the clove hitch once again. We are going to work with a long end and a short end to make our clove hitch

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:11.249
It's best to give yourself enough extra rope that you can wrap around the pole once or twice without any problem

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.550
Start by wrapping the short end of your rope around the pole once and having it go underneath the long

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.569
end of the rope if you've got it on top of the long end of the rope you've done it wrong

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.569
Continue wrapping the short end of the rope around the pole, but don't pull it completely tight you want to leave some slack

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.209
With the short end wrapped back around you want to pass it over the long end of the rope and then

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.539
Under the loop you've just created around the pole

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:46.230
This knot will actually cinch itself a little bit tighter as you pull on it, which makes it great for attaching it to round poles

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.269
Like the bowline one of the nicest things about this knot is that after you're finished putting it under tension

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:00.929
You can usually get it to slip open very easily to retrieve your rope

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:05.968
Now it turns out that the clove hitch like the bowline also has a one-handed method of tying

00:04:05.969 --> 00:04:11.969
it its usefulness is a little bit different because you end up with the entire knot which then has to be placed over the

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:13.750
post that you're trying to tie it to

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:19.229
So if you would just have access to the middle of a branch or pole or tree this way won't help you out very much

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:25.169
One advantage of it however is that you don't need to have access to the end of your rope the whole thing can be tied

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:30.989
Just in the middle to start have the rope hanging off of your pinky and thumb with it passing in front of your other three fingers

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.889
Twist your hand toward you so the Rope overlaps itself

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:40.109
You then want to loop your hand down underneath one side of the rope and grab the other side

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:45.329
At this point you need to slide your hand out from the bundle of rope wrapping around it

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.449
These two loops that I'm still holding on to

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:58.409
That's the knot if I drop those two loops over my post I can grab the ends of the rope and pull it tight now

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:04.919
the next knot we'll learn is called the taut line and it's also good for attaching a rope to a branch or a pole but

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:06.389
this one is very adjustable

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:11.969
and you can use it to tighten your line after you've tied it almost as though it had a ratcheting system to start off

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:16.679
Let's wrap our rope around our pole and leave ourselves about one foot of rope to work with at the end

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.750
to start off the short end of the rope

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:23.609
passes over the long end of the rope the short end of the rope then comes up through the loop and then

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:26.489
wraps all the way around the rope a second time

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:33.299
You can see we have the two coils going around the long end of the rope we then want to wrap our rope over those

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.300
two coils and the long end of the rope

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:39.269
down underneath and then through the loop. We've just made

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:43.619
When our knot is tightened it will securely grip onto the rope

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:47.849
Holding our rope attached to the pole if we add a little bit of slack though

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:52.680
We have the ability to slide our knot up and down the long end of the rope where ever we want it

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.419
This is a great knot if you're trying to hold a tarp or a tent or something similar

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:04.199
Nice and tight because you can tie the knot pull to remove any slack and then adjust the knot up the long end

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.130
Which will shorten your rope holding it pulled tight against your pole

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:13.709
Our next knot is called the Sheep shank and it's used to shorten a piece of rope when it's too long

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:18.299
But you don't want to cut it or when both ends are already tied to other things to start

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:21.690
we'll make three loops by grabbing our rope and twisting it clockwise

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:24.610
one

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:26.610
two

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:32.820
Three you can see we now have sort of a clover shape going on we have our first loop with the rope passing on top

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:35.880
We have our second loop with the rope passing on top

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:41.700
and we have our third loop with again the rope passing on top so the reason we twist it in the same direction every time

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:45.510
So we always have the end of our loop passing on top

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:51.179
We don't want to have one loop going the other direction so it starts on top and ends on bottom

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:53.430
That's incorrect now to tie our knot

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:54.880
We'll take this loop

00:06:54.880 --> 00:07:00.689
Twist it a little bit more clockwise and grab the side of our middle loop we'll then do the same thing for the other side

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:05.790
Twist it a little bit clockwise reach through and grab the side of the middle loop

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:11.580
Now we pull the middle loop through our side loops

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:17.549
and then as we tighten down on the rope it will cinch up and hold itself together

00:07:17.919 --> 00:07:20.999
We've now shortened our rope by a considerable amount

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.040
Let's see the difference here our rope is about eight inches long if we relax it

00:07:26.979 --> 00:07:28.979
pop these middle loops out

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:33.809
Trying to just hold on to the same spot without letting go

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:37.679
We now have at least two feet of rope

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:44.489
and if you just make your middle loop even larger you take even more rope out of your middle our next knot is one

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:46.830
That's used for attaching the ends of two ropes together

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:52.140
Sometimes the rope you have is too long and you can use the Sheep shank, but sometimes your ropes aren't long enough

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:57.600
And you need to attach two of them together this next knot called the sheet Bend is good for that

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:00.899
I have here the ends of two ropes. You can see this is its own separate rope

00:08:01.479 --> 00:08:05.489
You could actually use this for attaching two ends of the same rope together as well

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:10.499
But I'm attaching two different ropes to each other. We fold the end of our first rope over

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:13.919
Second rope gets passed up through the bottom

00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:17.859
goes all the way around both parts of our first rope and

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:25.120
then passes through the loop in itself that it's created. It shouldn't pass back through the loop from the first rope

00:08:25.669 --> 00:08:29.589
Pull that tight and we have a nice secure knot that will not let go

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:36.099
one thing to look out for is you want to be sure that both of the short ends are on the same side of the

00:08:36.099 --> 00:08:40.749
rope if I hold the rope with the short end of our first rope facing down and

00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:43.270
tie the second part of the rope the same way

00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:53.859
You can see that the short ends of the rope are now on opposite sides from each other

00:08:53.860 --> 00:09:00.159
This is not going to be quite as strong. You can see that the angle as we pull begins to slide more

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:03.159
one of the advantages of the Sheep Bended

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:08.830
not is that it can be very good for tying together two ropes of different thicknesses here

00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:11.889
I've got our thicker rope and here I have a piece of thinner paracord

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:16.900
You can pull this tight and we have a strong connection between the two

00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:24.849
The last knot we're going to show you today is possibly the simplest one, but it's still very useful

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:26.540
It's called the figure eight knot

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:31.540
The figure eight knot is the knot that you should be using most of the time when you tie an overhand knot

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:35.469
For reference an overhand knot is the most basic simple knot you can tie

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:43.989
Everyone knows how to tie an overhand knot they do it all the time pretzels are overhand knots and

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:46.100
while it's not a useless knot

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:48.310
It's really not good for all that much

00:09:48.589 --> 00:09:54.099
most of the time an overhand knot is used to either stop a rope from fraying or to provide a

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:58.209
stopper so that the rope can't slide through a hole for both of those uses

00:09:58.209 --> 00:10:00.429
I highly recommend using the figure eight knot instead

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:04.959
The figure eight knot is almost as easy to tie as the overhand knot and I think it works a lot better

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:09.820
To start simply pass the short end of the rope behind the long end of the rope and wrap it around

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:11.529
wrap the short

00:10:11.529 --> 00:10:17.559
end of the rope behind itself and through the loop that you've just made as you pull the rope tight your knot is already finished

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.139
There you have it six of the most useful knots

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:25.659
I know if you've practiced these then when it comes time to use them you'll be able to do it without even thinking about it and it

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:27.140
will be a great time-saver

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:30.040
obviously there are hundred's of other knots that I haven't shown here and

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:32.030
dozens of ways to maybe even tie these

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:38.050
same knots that I didn't show this is just supposed to be a basic guide for knots that I actually use in everyday life

00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:40.269
I know that this is a pretty simple project

00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:43.210
But it is one of the most useful things that you could learn in an afternoon

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:48.280
Thanks for joining us for this video and remember to come gear yourself up with products and merch at thekingofrandom.com

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:50.400
see you there

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:03.580
Hey guys, it's grant here, I'm not in a position to be in these videos right now

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:07.539
But that's exactly why Nate's here Nate is the man he's got some incredible talent

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:12.130
and I think he could pretty much build anything so let him know in the comments what you want to see and he can probably

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:14.120
Make it happen
