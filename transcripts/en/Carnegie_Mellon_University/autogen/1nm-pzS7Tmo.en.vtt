not fun nobody thinks it's fun
especially the first time you go do it

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280
especially the first time you go do it
 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.710
especially the first time you go do it
maybe when you're a huge success or

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720

it's sometimes a bad influence and so I

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470
it's sometimes a bad influence and so I
 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:16.750
it's sometimes a bad influence and so I
think I would really try to raise as

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:16.760
think I would really try to raise as
 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:17.920

little money as possible it's always
going to seem like the more money i have

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250
going to seem like the more money i have
 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.710
going to seem like the more money i have
this would just be easy it's usually not

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720
this would just be easy it's usually not
 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:21.820
this would just be easy it's usually not
true usually that's just going to let

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830
true usually that's just going to let
 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:22.990

you run really fast in the wrong

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000
you run really fast in the wrong
 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.260
you run really fast in the wrong
direction one way to do that is the

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270
direction one way to do that is the
 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:27.580
direction one way to do that is the
inter customers to pay in advance this

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590
inter customers to pay in advance this
 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.620
inter customers to pay in advance this
is a really good influence and it's way

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630
is a really good influence and it's way
 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.180
is a really good influence and it's way
easier to do than most startups believe

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190
easier to do than most startups believe
 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:32.830
easier to do than most startups believe
and so you just you know you just ask

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840
and so you just you know you just ask
 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.870
and so you just you know you just ask
them to pay you and if that you're

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880
them to pay you and if that you're
 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.310
them to pay you and if that you're
really solving a problem that's valuable

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320
really solving a problem that's valuable
 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:37.539

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:40.180
in advance and they'll give you some
runway to go do that they'll give you a

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190
runway to go do that they'll give you a
 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.399
runway to go do that they'll give you a
little bit of leeway another great trick

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409
little bit of leeway another great trick
 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:43.750
little bit of leeway another great trick
is just ask your customers to double

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:43.760
is just ask your customers to double
 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:44.920

what they're paying you I just did that
 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:45.969
what they're paying you I just did that
with another startup that I'm working

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979
with another startup that I'm working
 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:47.500
with another startup that I'm working
with and they suddenly doubled their

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:47.510
with and they suddenly doubled their
 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.350
with and they suddenly doubled their
revenue it was it was an amazing trick I

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360
revenue it was it was an amazing trick I
 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.420
revenue it was it was an amazing trick I
would have very few secrets I would talk

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430
would have very few secrets I would talk
 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.100
would have very few secrets I would talk
to as many people as I can about my

to as many people as I can about my
 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:55.870
to as many people as I can about my
startup this doesn't mean that you if

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880
startup this doesn't mean that you if
 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:56.530
startup this doesn't mean that you if
you have something you're going to

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540
you have something you're going to
 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.330
you have something you're going to
patent you should disclose that or you

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340
patent you should disclose that or you
 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.710

benefits the unexpected things that are
 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.339
benefits the unexpected things that are
going to come back at you far outweigh

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:09.349
going to come back at you far outweigh
 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:10.660
going to come back at you far outweigh
the negative things that might happen

could do anything I wanted to do so I

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140
could do anything I wanted to do so I
 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.360
could do anything I wanted to do so I
get to pick where I'm going to start I

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370
get to pick where I'm going to start I
 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.649
get to pick where I'm going to start I
would pick mobile because that's where

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:24.659
would pick mobile because that's where
 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:25.970
would pick mobile because that's where

to explain that here and I would build

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170
to explain that here and I would build
 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.809
to explain that here and I would build
it on Ruby on Rails there's lots of ways

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819
it on Ruby on Rails there's lots of ways
 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:45.710

to get to the top of the mountain

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720
to get to the top of the mountain
 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.330
to get to the top of the mountain
there's lots of programming languages

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340
there's lots of programming languages
 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.890
there's lots of programming languages
you could use you could build a website

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900
you could use you could build a website
 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.390
you could use you could build a website
probably in any different language and

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400
probably in any different language and
 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.250
probably in any different language and
they probably could all do it well if

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260
they probably could all do it well if
 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.259
they probably could all do it well if
you did it the right way but I pic Ruby

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269
you did it the right way but I pic Ruby
 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:55.819
you did it the right way but I pic Ruby
on Rails and it's not really just about

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829
on Rails and it's not really just about
 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:57.920
on Rails and it's not really just about
the way Ruby on Rails works and that it

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930
the way Ruby on Rails works and that it
 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.479
the way Ruby on Rails works and that it
lets you do things really quickly and

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489
lets you do things really quickly and
 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.160
lets you do things really quickly and
fast but it's actually more about the

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170
fast but it's actually more about the
 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:02.809
fast but it's actually more about the
types of programmers that go and learn

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819
types of programmers that go and learn
 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:04.250
types of programmers that go and learn
ruby on rails and I find they're really

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260
ruby on rails and I find they're really
 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.360
ruby on rails and I find they're really
entrepreneurial and they're the kind of

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370
entrepreneurial and they're the kind of
 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:14.059
