that's obvious we try to make the

that's obvious we try to make the
 

00:19:26.789 --> 00:19:28.879
that's obvious we try to make the
faculty stronger stronger stronger so

00:19:28.879 --> 00:19:28.889
faculty stronger stronger stronger so
 

00:19:28.889 --> 00:19:29.930
faculty stronger stronger stronger so
that it makes it more and more difficult

00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:29.940
that it makes it more and more difficult
 

00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:32.299

you make it very very easy you really

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:35.010
you make it very very easy you really
 

00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:37.190

are something special also you are the
 

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:38.810
are something special also you are the
post professional program so you have

00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:38.820
post professional program so you have
 

00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:41.090

kind of a research capacity so what's

00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:33.570
kind of a research capacity so what's
 

00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:35.539
kind of a research capacity so what's
super interesting about your generation

00:20:35.539 --> 00:20:35.549
super interesting about your generation
 

00:20:35.549 --> 00:20:37.250
super interesting about your generation
is probably you're the first generation

00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:37.260
is probably you're the first generation

even with a more experimental mode of
 

00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:03.170
even with a more experimental mode of
behavior than you had at the school so

00:21:03.170 --> 00:21:03.180
behavior than you had at the school so
 

00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:04.970
behavior than you had at the school so
we've left behind an old model which

we've left behind an old model which

become more and more boring and then

00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:04.740
it's not good news it's also it's not
 

00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:06.230
it's not good news it's also it's not
terribly good news for the students of

00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:06.240
terribly good news for the students of
 

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:09.169
terribly good news for the students of
next year either and maybe the faculty

00:23:09.169 --> 00:23:09.179
next year either and maybe the faculty
 

00:23:09.179 --> 00:23:11.029
next year either and maybe the faculty
are wrong after all you were the ones

00:23:11.029 --> 00:23:11.039
are wrong after all you were the ones
 

00:23:11.039 --> 00:23:12.380
are wrong after all you were the ones
telling us that the faculty are not that

00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:12.390
telling us that the faculty are not that
 

00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:15.139
telling us that the faculty are not that
interesting so maybe they're wrong but

00:23:15.139 --> 00:23:15.149
interesting so maybe they're wrong but
 

00:23:15.149 --> 00:23:16.310
interesting so maybe they're wrong but
they currently think that you are the

00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:16.320
they currently think that you are the
 

00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:19.820
they currently think that you are the
best strongest most radical most

00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:19.830
best strongest most radical most
 

00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:21.260

unpredictable group that ever went
 

00:23:21.270 --> 00:23:22.760
unpredictable group that ever went
through the school so it's with just

00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:22.770
through the school so it's with just
 

00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:27.230

enormous pride and a sense of total

you we tried and there is something of a

00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:51.240
you we tried and there is something of a
 

00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:54.080

feeling in the air and maybe it has

00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:54.090
feeling in the air and maybe it has
 

00:23:54.090 --> 00:23:55.639
feeling in the air and maybe it has
something to do with the crisis of the

00:23:55.639 --> 00:23:55.649
something to do with the crisis of the
 

00:23:55.649 --> 00:23:58.580
something to do with the crisis of the
last two years in which when almost

00:23:58.580 --> 00:23:58.590
last two years in which when almost

every aspect of global society felt

school like like Columbia suddenly has

00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:10.860
school like like Columbia suddenly has
 

00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:12.409

to as it were elevated level of
 

00:24:12.419 --> 00:24:14.360
to as it were elevated level of
responsibility and suddenly a lot of the

ideas that you've been working on seem

00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:16.350
ideas that you've been working on seem
 

00:24:16.350 --> 00:24:19.760

of we're eating to see what will happen

00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:22.320
of we're eating to see what will happen
 

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:25.490
of we're eating to see what will happen
so I think maybe what went on in the

00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:25.500
so I think maybe what went on in the
 

00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:27.080
so I think maybe what went on in the
school for you over these last few

00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:27.090
school for you over these last few
 

00:24:27.090 --> 00:24:29.090
school for you over these last few
semesters was more like the real world

00:24:29.090 --> 00:24:29.100
semesters was more like the real world
 

00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:32.210
semesters was more like the real world
was more like real engagement and

00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:32.220
was more like real engagement and
 

00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:34.250
was more like real engagement and
perhaps the next step is the real

00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:34.260
perhaps the next step is the real
 

00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:37.460
perhaps the next step is the real
radical experiment so it's our sort of

00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:37.470
radical experiment so it's our sort of
 

00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:39.110
radical experiment so it's our sort of
deepest wish that every now and then

00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:39.120
deepest wish that every now and then
 

00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:41.539
deepest wish that every now and then
you'd let us know what you are doing to

00:24:41.539 --> 00:24:41.549
you'd let us know what you are doing to
 

00:24:41.549 --> 00:24:43.250
you'd let us know what you are doing to
see how this experiment plays out but

00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:43.260
see how this experiment plays out but
 

00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:47.000
see how this experiment plays out but
again I just want to congratulate you on

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:47.010

an absolutely amazing accomplishment we
would love to claim all of the credit

00:24:54.669 --> 00:24:54.679
would love to claim all of the credit
 

00:24:54.679 --> 00:24:58.310
would love to claim all of the credit
all of it 110 percent of the credit but

00:24:58.310 --> 00:24:58.320
all of it 110 percent of the credit but
 

00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:02.060
all of it 110 percent of the credit but
it's completely untrue we admitted you

00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:02.070
it's completely untrue we admitted you
 

00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:03.350
it's completely untrue we admitted you
into the school because you are

00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:03.360
into the school because you are
 

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:07.360
into the school because you are
certifiably crazy it's no question

00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:07.370
certifiably crazy it's no question
 

00:25:07.370 --> 00:25:10.460
certifiably crazy it's no question
instead of going for a series of steady

00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:10.470
instead of going for a series of steady

to go to the laboratory I want to go to

00:25:14.749 --> 00:25:14.759
to go to the laboratory I want to go to
 

00:25:14.759 --> 00:25:16.730
to go to the laboratory I want to go to
the place in which nobody's sure about

00:25:16.730 --> 00:25:16.740
the place in which nobody's sure about
 

00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:18.200
the place in which nobody's sure about
the future and I want to participate in

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:18.210
the future and I want to participate in
 

00:25:18.210 --> 00:25:20.330
the future and I want to participate in
recreating the future so you are

00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:20.340
recreating the future so you are
 

00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:24.019
recreating the future so you are
genuinely romantic you are beloved by

00:25:24.019 --> 00:25:24.029
genuinely romantic you are beloved by
 

00:25:24.029 --> 00:25:25.700
genuinely romantic you are beloved by
your teachers because you're willing to

00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:25.710
your teachers because you're willing to
 

00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:28.249
your teachers because you're willing to
throw away your life for the possibility

00:25:28.249 --> 00:25:28.259
throw away your life for the possibility
 

00:25:28.259 --> 00:25:30.739
throw away your life for the possibility
that you would negotiate with the future

00:25:30.739 --> 00:25:30.749
that you would negotiate with the future
 

00:25:30.749 --> 00:25:32.659
that you would negotiate with the future
I think it used to be that when

00:25:32.659 --> 00:25:32.669
I think it used to be that when
 

00:25:32.669 --> 00:25:34.279
I think it used to be that when
universities were formed that

00:25:34.279 --> 00:25:34.289
universities were formed that
 

00:25:34.289 --> 00:25:36.830
universities were formed that
universities were almost designed to

00:25:36.830 --> 00:25:36.840
universities were almost designed to
 

00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:40.159
universities were almost designed to
kind of keep the future at a distance

00:25:40.159 --> 00:25:40.169
kind of keep the future at a distance
 

00:25:40.169 --> 00:25:41.739
kind of keep the future at a distance
you know universities were about

00:25:41.739 --> 00:25:41.749
you know universities were about
 

00:25:41.749 --> 00:25:44.090
you know universities were about
consolidating established knowledge in

00:25:44.090 --> 00:25:44.100
consolidating established knowledge in
 

00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:46.340
consolidating established knowledge in
the eighteenth and nineteenth century

00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:46.350
the eighteenth and nineteenth century
 

00:25:46.350 --> 00:25:48.019
the eighteenth and nineteenth century
was really invented the idea of the

00:25:48.019 --> 00:25:48.029
was really invented the idea of the
 

00:25:48.029 --> 00:25:50.330
was really invented the idea of the
research university we're constructing

00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:50.340
research university we're constructing
 

00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:53.119
research university we're constructing
new knowledge was the the real paradigm

00:25:53.119 --> 00:25:53.129
new knowledge was the the real paradigm
 

00:25:53.129 --> 00:25:55.609
new knowledge was the the real paradigm
but even within a research university I

00:25:55.609 --> 00:25:55.619
but even within a research university I
 

00:25:55.619 --> 00:25:56.749
but even within a research university I
think the school of architecture has

00:25:56.749 --> 00:25:56.759
think the school of architecture has
 

00:25:56.759 --> 00:25:58.310
think the school of architecture has
gone to some whole new level of

00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:58.320
gone to some whole new level of
 

00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:00.710
gone to some whole new level of
engagement with the future and I can

00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:00.720
engagement with the future and I can
 

00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:03.769
engagement with the future and I can
