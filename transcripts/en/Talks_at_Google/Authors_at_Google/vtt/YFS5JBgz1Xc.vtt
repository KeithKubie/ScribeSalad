00:00:01.862 --> 00:00:03.320
MALE SPEAKER: So
welcome, everyone.

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.940
My name is [INAUDIBLE], and
I'm very pleased to welcome you

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:10.520
for another special talk in
our Value Investing series.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.680
We have a very special
speaker with us today.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.160
But before I get into
his introduction,

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.830
I want to talk briefly
about this term

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.290
"moat," which you are
going to be hearing

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:23.700
a lot about in today's talk.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.390
Well, according to
Wikipedia, a moat

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:32.360
is a deep, broad, ditch, either
dry or filled with water,

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.750
that surrounds a castle, other
building, or town, historically

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.410
to provide it with a
preliminary line of defense.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.940
However, thanks to Mr.
Buffett and a legion

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.290
of value investors,
this word "moat"

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.840
has become an excellent
metaphor to identify companies

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.980
with durable
competitive advantage.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.550
Very few people,
though, have managed

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.070
to develop and synthesize a
framework that systematically

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:08.270
helps to identify moats from
an investor's perspective.

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.020
Pat Dorsey, our
author for today,

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.990
has done a great
service to students

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.630
and individual investors
trying to do exactly that.

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.430
In his bestselling
book, "The Little

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.670
Book That Builds Wealth," he
has shared actionable insights

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.340
to identify modes in
the business world.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.190
His book is also a great
introduction for anyone

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.510
interested in learning
more about value investing.

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.380
We are very, very pleased
to have Pat here with us.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.370
So without further ado,
ladies and gentlemen,

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:37.577
please join me in
welcoming Pat Dorsey.

00:01:37.577 --> 00:01:40.727
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:40.727 --> 00:01:42.310
PAT DORSEY: Thanks
for the kind intro.

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.372
I'm glad we have the technology,
at least working mostly,

00:01:46.372 --> 00:01:48.580
here in one of the world's
most successful technology

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:49.079
companies.

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.326
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:51.326 --> 00:01:52.950
You would have thought
I was presenting

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:53.908
in Redmond, Washington.

00:01:53.908 --> 00:01:55.400
No, I'm joking.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.244
Sorry, sorry, it was just
right down the middle.

00:01:58.244 --> 00:01:58.910
It was too easy.

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.310
It was too easy.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:01.810
You give me a fat
pitch, I'm going

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.830
to hit it-- or invest
in it, I suppose.

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:05.910
So we've done the intros.

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:06.880
I'm Pat.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.087
I used to run Morningstar's
Equity Research Group,

00:02:10.087 --> 00:02:11.920
currently have my own
investment firm called

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.250
Dorsey Asset
Management, which is

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.120
a global firm, a global mandate.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.660
We can invest anywhere in
the world, any market cap.

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:20.750
We're very concentrated.

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.320
And our goal really
is to find 10 to 15

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.970
of the world's
most competitively

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.630
advantaged businesses that
can compound at high rates

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.220
overtime, invest in them,
and then leave them alone

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:32.750
to make lots of money over time.

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.666
That's our job, and
that's what we're actively

00:02:34.666 --> 00:02:36.050
engaged in doing right now.

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.640
And the framework we use
is in large part based

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.550
on the work I did at
Morningstar and the concept

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.770
of economic moats and
reinvesting capital

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:44.950
at high rates of return.

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.570
And that's what I want
to talk about today.

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.550
So the basic
foundation of thinking

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.710
about economic moats and
competitive advantage

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.840
is that-- shocker--
capitalism works,

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.240
and that capital seeks the
highest returns possible.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.170
If a company is
making a lot of money,

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.330
others will seek
to compete with it.

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.000
That intuitively make sense.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.040
If I wrote each of you a $50
million VC check and said,

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.070
go start a business,
you would probably

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:15.172
try to do something profitable.

00:03:15.172 --> 00:03:17.505
If you are smart, you probably
would not start airlines.

00:03:17.505 --> 00:03:18.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.010
I hope.

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.520
I hope.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.070
High profits attract
competition, I mean,

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:24.930
as surely as night follows day.

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.090
So intuitively this makes sense.

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.470
Empirically it
makes sense as well.

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.850
If you go back over
time and look at, say,

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.370
take T1, companies
in the highest

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.440
decile of returns on capital.

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.535
Then roll the clock
forward 10, 15 years

00:03:39.535 --> 00:03:42.290
and look at that
cohort of companies.

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.990
Most will have lower
levels of profitability.

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:47.490
Most will have lower
returns on capital

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:49.940
as their returns on
capital have drifted down

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:54.430
to some mean as
competition has come in.

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.100
Of course there is a
minority of businesses

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.780
where that's not the case.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.840
So most businesses
you see high returns

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.810
on capital decrease over
time as competition comes in.

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.890
However, there is a
very small minority

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.540
of businesses that
enjoy many years

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.520
of high returns on capital.

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.420
They essentially beat the odds.

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.089
They defy economic gravity.

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:21.200
And the question
simply becomes, how?

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.460
And in my view,
it's because they've

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.190
created structural
advantages, economic moats,

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.790
a way of insulating themselves,
buffering themselves

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:33.620
against the competition,
that enables them to maintain

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.800
supernormal returns
on capital longer

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.600
than academic theory and
the averages would suggest.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.270
Because absent a
moat, competition

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:48.790
destroys excess returns--
period, end, full stop.

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:51.680
Any highly profitable business
that is easy to compete

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.990
with, you will see that come
down over time-- very common

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.470
in the fashion industry,
very common, say,

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.170
in if you guys remember
back in NVIDIA,

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:04.310
and what was the other big
graphics company, chip company?

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:05.050
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.754
They would swap market
shares like every six months.

00:05:07.754 --> 00:05:08.670
One had the best chip.

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:09.961
Oh, now I've got the best chip.

00:05:09.961 --> 00:05:10.590
Do-do-do-do.

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:11.980
And there's no moat there.

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.330
The moat was just, what do
I got that's great today?

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.038
And then you had a
lot of smart engineers

00:05:16.038 --> 00:05:19.400
at the other place trying
to make the next best thing.

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.470
So the basics of
moats is that there

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:23.380
are structural and
sustainable qualities that

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:24.950
are inherent to the business.

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:27.690
A moat is part and
parcel of the business

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:28.680
that you're looking at.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.570
It's not a hot product.

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:33.220
We all probably remember
the Krispy Kreme debacle.

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:38.400
They taste good, but
sugar is not a moat.

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.990
Heelys-- anybody remember
Heelys or have a kid?

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:43.370
Remember those little shoes
with the wheel in the heel?

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:47.630
That was an $800 million
company at one point.

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:52.920
I mean, yes, as Dave Barry would
say, I am not making this up.

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:56.330
People were valuing Heelys
as if it had a moat.

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:59.760
Aside from the massive
product liability issues,

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:04.250
once basically schools
started banning them,

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:07.580
that's a problem if your
target audience of 12-year-olds

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:09.490
can't buy your product anymore.

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:12.710
And so that business
went to hell pretty fast.

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:14.800
It's not just a cool
piece of technology.

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.010
We talked about in video
and the graphics companies

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:17.890
a moment ago.

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:19.260
Remember Iomega?

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:22.320
Remember that was
going to be the thing?

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.290
It's just a cool
piece of technology.

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:27.120
And frankly, any cool
piece of technology

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.490
can be replicated by
other smart engineers,

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:32.170
unless there's some switch in
cost, some lock-in effect that

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:35.550
occurs or an industry
standard is created.

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:37.866
But anything that one smart
bunch of guys can develop,

00:06:37.866 --> 00:06:39.366
there's probably
another smart bunch

00:06:39.366 --> 00:06:41.969
of guys somewhere else trying
to make it even better.

00:06:41.969 --> 00:06:44.010
And of course, it's not
the biggest market share.

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:46.060
You'll often hear companies talk
about, oh, we're the biggest.

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:47.450
We're going for market share.

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:48.490
Let's think about GM.

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:49.870
Let's think about Compaq.

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:51.340
It didn't work out so well.

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:52.860
Big is not a moat.

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:56.160
In fact, small is often
a better moat than big.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.430
Moats generally manifest
themselves in pricing power.

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:01.270
A company that
can't raise prices

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:03.020
is unlikely to
have a strong moat.

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:06.350
And in fact, if you invest,
this is a test often

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:09.140
that businesses are losing
competitive advantage.

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:14.540
If you have a company who
typically raises prices 2%, 3%,

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:15.502
4% every year.

00:07:15.502 --> 00:07:17.710
They're able to kind of keep
pricing power moving up.

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:19.440
And then one year,
suddenly they don't.

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.550
They say, well,
the economy's tough

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:24.570
or we want to take it easy
on the customers this year.

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:26.520
That's a load of crap.

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:29.490
It means that something has
changed in that industry.

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:31.040
There's a competitor out there.

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.800
There is some event
going on that you may not

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.964
be aware of that's causing them
to lose that pricing power.

00:07:36.964 --> 00:07:38.380
Because if you can
take price, you

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:40.140
will take prices as a business.

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:43.000
And so companies that lose that
pricing power, that's usually

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.916
the first sign that
their moat is eroding.

00:07:45.916 --> 00:07:47.290
So what I want to
do next is talk

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:50.502
about the four kinds of moats
that I identified when we were

00:07:50.502 --> 00:07:53.410
at Morningstar and that I
still think make sense today.

00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:57.180
The way we identified
these was by going back,

00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:01.130
this would have been about
50 years of Compustat data,

00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:03.650
and it was pretty simple,
just looking at businesses

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:07.010
that had maintained returns on
capital above cost of capital

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:08.870
for 15 years plus.

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:10.585
It's not a huge data set.

00:08:10.585 --> 00:08:11.960
And then you
basically say, well,

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:13.418
what are the common
characteristics

00:08:13.418 --> 00:08:14.480
of these businesses?

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:16.544
What are the similarities
of these businesses?

00:08:16.544 --> 00:08:17.960
And that's where
we kind of teased

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:19.720
out these four categories.

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:21.800
And they've proven to
work out pretty well.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:25.350
We introduced the moat ratings
at Morningstar in about '01.

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:29.340
And so now we've had about
12, 13 years, and the business

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:32.470
we initially identified as
being wide-moat businesses that

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:35.030
fell into these buckets
have maintained higher

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:36.530
returns on capital
than their peers.

00:08:36.530 --> 00:08:41.710
So the empirical results
seem to bear out the theory.

00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:44.320
The first kind of
intangible asset is a brand.

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:47.330
And a brand is valuable
if it either increases

00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:50.450
your willingness to pay or
lowers your search costs.

00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:51.680
And this is really important.

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:53.572
It's not just that
it's well known.

00:08:53.572 --> 00:08:55.030
Because you think
about, say, Sony.

00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:56.480
We've all heard of Sony, right?

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:59.360
Sony is often ranked as one
of the 20 most valuable brands

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:02.100
on the planet by the
Business Week brand week

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:04.330
thingy that happens every year.

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:07.060
But let me just do a
quick survey in this room.

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:10.878
How many of you would pay 20%
more for a Sony DVD player?

00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:14.630
One hand?

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:15.350
Any hands?

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:16.989
AUDIENCE: Maybe 15 years ago.

00:09:16.989 --> 00:09:18.280
PAT DORSEY: Maybe 15 years ago.

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:20.050
That's exactly it.

00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:23.120
And right now you do see like
the Sony Bravia TVs getting

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:25.240
a little bit of a price
premium over others.

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:26.120
Because it's newer.

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:27.810
DVDs were newer.

00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:30.510
But consumer electronics
is fast-cycle stuff, right?

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:32.580
What's new today
is old next week.

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:35.220
And so the fact that
Sony is well known

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:38.250
and we've heard a lot about
it does not contribute one bit

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:39.950
to its competitive advantage.

00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:41.910
In fact, I would argue
Sony could probably

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:44.390
save a heck of a lot of
money by not advertising

00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:46.700
or advertising very little.

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:48.690
On Michigan Ave in
Chicago where I work,

00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:51.192
they have this super
expensive flagship store

00:09:51.192 --> 00:09:53.150
with all kinds of cool
stuff you can play with.

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:56.700
And I'm sure they're paying God
knows what in rent-- useless.

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:59.840
Because that brand doesn't
change your behavior.

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:02.780
By contrast, let's
look at Tiffany.

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:06.830
Tiffany will charge you 20%
more for the exact same diamond

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:10.210
that you can buy from Blue
Nile or Zales or Helzberg

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:11.360
or wherever you want.

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:15.039
20% is the value of
that pale blue box.

00:10:15.039 --> 00:10:17.330
I can guarantee you the
cardboard ain't that expensive.

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:18.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:19.380
OK?

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:23.180
But you know as the
giver of a diamond,

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:26.620
that you'll probably get a
bigger smile off the recipient

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:30.340
if it's in a Tiffany box than
if it's not in a Tiffany box.

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:32.490
So they can charge it.

00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:34.120
And so that brand
has value, right?

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:36.590
That brand increases
your willingness to pay.

00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:37.810
And there's value there.

00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:40.410
You also have brands
that lower search costs.

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:43.160
So think about Coca-Cola
or Wrigley gum.

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:46.010
You don't pay a lot more
for Coke versus Pepsi,

00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:48.740
but you know you like
Coke, so you go there.

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:50.872
You like Heinz, so you
grab it off the shelf

00:10:50.872 --> 00:10:52.830
because you don't want
to sit there and compare

00:10:52.830 --> 00:10:55.420
ketchup prices for 20 minutes
before buying the ketchup.

00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:56.705
It's $3.

00:10:56.705 --> 00:10:57.580
My kids like ketchup.

00:10:57.580 --> 00:10:58.621
Let's go get the ketchup.

00:10:58.621 --> 00:11:00.890
We go through ketchup
in vats at my house.

00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:02.320
I have twin
seven-year-olds, and I

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:04.111
think ketchup is like
our fifth food group.

00:11:04.111 --> 00:11:07.040
It's ridiculous.

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:11.460
So again, if a brand
changes consumer behavior

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:14.130
by increasing the
willingness to pay

00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:17.350
or reducing the search
costs, then it has value.

00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:20.890
Just being well known
doesn't mean anything at all.

00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:23.540
Patents-- obviously a
patent is a legal monopoly.

00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:26.290
But they are subject to
expiration, challenge,

00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:27.300
and piracy.

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:29.900
And so you want to be very
careful of a business--

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:32.330
you see this a lot in like
specialty pharmaceuticals

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:35.650
where you have one
asset, one drug driving

00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:37.190
all of your economic value.

00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:39.920
That patent gets
challenged, you're dead.

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:43.000
And last time I checked, patent
lawyers drive really nice cars.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.510
And there's a reason
for that, which

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:46.465
is that patents are
valuable to challenge.

00:11:46.465 --> 00:11:47.840
And so if they
can be challenged,

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:48.840
they will be challenged.

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:51.910
So you want to rely
on patents as a moat

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:53.850
when you have a
portfolio of them,

00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:56.052
that it's hard to
invalidate one or the other.

00:11:56.052 --> 00:11:56.760
Think of Qalcomm.

00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:58.280
Think of ARM Holdings,
where there's

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:00.102
this huge portfolio of patents.

00:12:00.102 --> 00:12:01.810
And then finally,
licenses and approvals.

00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:03.610
You have a license
to do something

00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:06.950
that not many people
can do or an approval,

00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:08.840
that is a pretty
solid economic moat.

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:11.660
Casinos-- not easy to
get a casino license.

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:12.830
Six of them in Macau.

00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:13.330
That's it.

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:15.100
They ain't giving out any more.

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:18.020
Landfills-- no one likes
to live near a landfill.

00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:21.214
So municipalities don't give
out tons of landfill licenses,

00:12:21.214 --> 00:12:22.880
because then nobody
wants to live there.

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:24.270
And that reduces the tax base.

00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:26.234
So once you have a
landfill or a gravel pit,

00:12:26.234 --> 00:12:28.650
you probably aren't going to
get a whole lot more of them.

00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:30.240
Aircraft parts are
the same thing,

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:32.360
have to be FAA
certified, and that's

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:34.360
a huge moat to the
aircraft parts industry.

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:36.760
Most aircraft parts
are sole source.

00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:39.580
They have one manufacturer
who makes them.

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:41.950
And so they get about a
40% margin on aftermarket.

00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:44.940
It's a beautiful business.

00:12:44.940 --> 00:12:47.537
If you're selling a brand,
if you're a company,

00:12:47.537 --> 00:12:49.370
here's what you want
to look for when you're

00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:50.745
looking at
brand-based companies.

00:12:50.745 --> 00:12:52.670
Brands are valuable
if they deliver

00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:55.370
a consistent or
aspirational experience.

00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:59.220
Now, consistency lowers search
costs and drives loyalty.

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:02.780
So what you don't want to do
is change the damn product.

00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:04.960
That's the stupidest
thing possible.

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:07.530
Remember New Coke?

00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:09.110
Idiotic.

00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:13.460
Schlitz-- Schlitz used to be
the second highest selling

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:15.910
beer in the US,
most volume the US.

00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:19.070
Now not so much, right?

00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:22.440
And the reason was they
changed the way it was made.

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:25.270
They changed the
taste of Schlitz.

00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:27.660
Why would you do this?

00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:29.252
Recently there was
something like-- I

00:13:29.252 --> 00:13:31.210
think it was either Heinz
or there was actually

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:32.480
a ketchup that
was going to lower

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:33.500
the amount of sugar content.

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:35.041
They were going to
change the recipe.

00:13:35.041 --> 00:13:36.930
And you just go, stop.

00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:40.960
If people are buying
this, why change it?

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:43.830
Aspiration, by contrast,
increases willingness to pay.

00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:47.662
So what you want to do is
create scarcity and exclusivity.

00:13:47.662 --> 00:13:51.111
A very interesting
example is Tiffany stores.

00:13:51.111 --> 00:13:53.610
Tiffany is unique in that we
think of it as a very expensive

00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:57.010
brand, but over 40%
of their revenue

00:13:57.010 --> 00:14:00.350
comes from stuff that's
sells for under $200.

00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:00.900
Weird, right?

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:02.240
You wouldn't think about that.

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:03.347
And it's brilliant.

00:14:03.347 --> 00:14:04.930
They're one of the
only companies that

00:14:04.930 --> 00:14:07.550
can hit volume and
hit high price.

00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:09.410
But here's how they
do it, one of the ways

00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:11.000
they do it by
maintaining the brand.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.458
You would think
that the stuff that

00:14:12.458 --> 00:14:13.990
drives 40% of your
sales, that would

00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:15.490
be at the front of
the store, right?

00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:17.281
You want people to get
easy access to that.

00:14:17.281 --> 00:14:18.550
No, no, no, no, no.

00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:19.890
Go into a Tiffany store.

00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:22.170
The cheap stuff is at the back.

00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:23.810
So the expensive
stuff, the stuff

00:14:23.810 --> 00:14:25.920
that costs more
than a Tesla, that's

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:27.450
sitting in the
front of the store.

00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:29.470
Because that keeps the
value of the brand up.

00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:33.920
That maintains an aura of
exclusivity and scarcity.

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:36.000
And so they keep
the brand value up.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.900
Or Patek Phillippe, very
expensive watch brand--

00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:41.980
the slogan, which
I love, is, you

00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:43.470
don't own a Patek Phillippe.

00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:46.090
You take care of it for
the next generation.

00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:49.040
I mean, what a great
image, for those of us

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:52.010
who can afford $50,000 watches.

00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:55.290
But it maintains that scarcity,
that exclusivity value.

00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:57.630
And again, you have
to look at, if you're

00:14:57.630 --> 00:14:59.980
looking at brand-based
companies, aspirations differ.

00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:02.180
So you want to think about
companies that can adapt.

00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:05.575
A great example is Jack
Daniels, owned by Brown-Forman.

00:15:05.575 --> 00:15:08.457
So these are two different
Jack Daniels ads.

00:15:08.457 --> 00:15:11.040
I'm going to do the translations
based on what I've been told.

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:13.700
I don't speak
Russian or Chinese.

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:16.620
So this says, "Happy
Birthday, Mr. Jack."

00:15:16.620 --> 00:15:19.167
And as you can look
at, see it, it's

00:15:19.167 --> 00:15:21.000
the same image we have
of Jack Daniels here,

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.390
the frontier, the
cowboy, old school.

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:27.910
And in Russia, that works,
because a lot of Russians

00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:28.660
own [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:30.868
They like to get out of the
city and get back to kind

00:15:30.868 --> 00:15:33.070
of their sort of Slavic roots.

00:15:33.070 --> 00:15:38.870
Now compare that with this
Jack Daniels ad in China.

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:43.350
You're in a very high-end
bar, very urban, very smooth,

00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:44.800
very cool.

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:48.797
And I've got this translated,
but can anyone-- I

00:15:48.797 --> 00:15:50.380
see a few folks here
who might speak--

00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:51.990
you want to translate
that for me?

00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:53.970
AUDIENCE: So it
specifically means

00:15:53.970 --> 00:15:58.920
confidence is not by our mouth
but from other people's eye.

00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:01.200
PAT DORSEY: Confidence
is not out of your mouth

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:03.190
but comes from
other people's eyes.

00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:07.440
In other words, confidence
is how people see you, right?

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:09.080
Totally different, right?

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:12.600
Because imagine in China if
you had this ad that basically

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:16.660
was like, you should go back
to the village you came from.

00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:18.560
That's going to sell a
premium spirit, right?

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:19.220
Uh-huh.

00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:20.240
You know?

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:22.690
So again, you see
this adaptation.

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:25.540
That's what you want to see
in a brand-based company.

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:28.572
Second kind of economic
moat is switching costs.

00:16:28.572 --> 00:16:31.030
It's very simple, just the cost
of switching to a competing

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:33.162
product outweigh the benefits.

00:16:33.162 --> 00:16:34.870
What you want to do
is look for companies

00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:37.390
that integrate with the
customer's business.

00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:39.800
So the upfront cost
of implementation

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:41.860
get huge payback for renewals.

00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:44.220
Think about an Oracle
database, for example.

00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:46.430
If you're P&amp;G, if
you're Citigroup

00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:49.100
and you're running on an Oracle
database, ripping that out

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:51.020
is virtually impossible.

00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:55.530
It's not impossible, but it's
really, really, really, hard.

00:16:55.530 --> 00:16:58.790
I mean, if you showed up
today, if Google, for example,

00:16:58.790 --> 00:17:02.040
built an amazing database and
showed up to P&amp;G and said,

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:07.319
we've got Googlebase, and it's
50% faster and 20% cheaper

00:17:07.319 --> 00:17:10.089
than Oracle's best
product, P&amp;G would say,

00:17:10.089 --> 00:17:13.349
yes, and I will have to spend
hundreds of millions of dollars

00:17:13.349 --> 00:17:16.180
and however many man hours
ripping out what I have now,

00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:18.859
and my business will probably
blow up when I do that.

00:17:18.859 --> 00:17:20.530
So the switching
costs are very high.

00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:23.710
And so Oracle can raise the
price 2% to 3% every year.

00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:26.089
You see this a lot with
enterprise software companies.

00:17:26.089 --> 00:17:27.630
You also see it with
data processors,

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:30.330
people that integrate tightly
with the customer's business.

00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:33.020
You can also sell an ongoing
service relationship.

00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:35.174
So think of elevators.

00:17:35.174 --> 00:17:36.840
Once you have an
elevator in a building,

00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:38.950
it probably ain't
coming out again.

00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:41.300
And so you get
elevator companies

00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:44.110
like Otis, which is part of
United Technologies, KONE,

00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:46.880
which is a Finnish company,
Schindler which is German,

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:49.630
and their goal is to have a
high what's called attach rate,

00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:52.217
to attach a service
contract to the elevator.

00:17:52.217 --> 00:17:53.800
Because once that
elevator's in there,

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:55.060
it ain't coming out again.

00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:57.570
And so you get this long
service relationship.

00:17:57.570 --> 00:18:00.970
Rolls Royce-- Rolls Royce
typically sells its jet engines

00:18:00.970 --> 00:18:02.850
on what's called
power by the hour.

00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:04.520
They actually sell
it, and then you

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:06.465
pay for it based on
how much you use it.

00:18:06.465 --> 00:18:07.840
You don't just
pay for it upfront

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:09.298
and then someone
else maintains it.

00:18:09.298 --> 00:18:11.664
So that's a way of increasing
the switching cost.

00:18:11.664 --> 00:18:13.080
And then you can
provide a product

00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:15.930
with a very high
benefit-to-cost ratio.

00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:18.770
Favorite example here is a
company called Fastenal here

00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:20.300
in the US.

00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:23.254
If you have one bolt on your
assembly line that goes down,

00:18:23.254 --> 00:18:25.670
and then you have a whole bunch
of unionized guys standing

00:18:25.670 --> 00:18:28.340
around basically getting
paid for not doing anything,

00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:30.840
you will pay a lot of
money to get that bolt

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:33.290
back on the line really quickly.

00:18:33.290 --> 00:18:35.850
And so that product doesn't
have a very high economic cost

00:18:35.850 --> 00:18:37.860
in terms of how would
you spend for the bolt.

00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:41.220
But it has a huge benefit
to your organization.

00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:44.086
Fuchs Petrolube or Lubrizol,
which Berkshire bought a while

00:18:44.086 --> 00:18:47.280
back, same thing-- lubricants--
if you have a lubricant that

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:50.480
can increase the uptime of
a giant mining machine down

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:52.655
in a hole by 10% so you
don't have to take it down

00:18:52.655 --> 00:18:54.780
for maintenance as often,
you don't have to take it

00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:57.310
apart and lube everything, and
you get more productivity out

00:18:57.310 --> 00:19:00.560
of it, and that
lubricant costs even

00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:02.920
20% more than the
competing lubricant,

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:06.780
it's such a tiny part of
the overall cost of running

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:08.630
that machine, why not?

00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:11.130
So this high benefit/cost
ratio is really a cool thing

00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:13.671
to look for when you're looking
for businesses with switching

00:19:13.671 --> 00:19:14.784
costs.

00:19:14.784 --> 00:19:16.700
You've got the network
effect, which is simply

00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:18.330
providing a service
that increases

00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:21.090
in value as the number
of users expands.

00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:23.350
You can aggregate demand
between fragmented parties.

00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:24.880
Think of distributors.

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:26.830
Henry Schein is a
dental distributor.

00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:29.990
So basically most dentists are
little owner-operators, two,

00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:31.800
three, four, five
dentists at a practice.

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:33.010
And then they've
got to buy stuff.

00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:35.218
They've got to buy those
obnoxious cotton things that

00:19:35.218 --> 00:19:37.170
stick in your mouth
and suck up the saliva

00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:39.837
and give you cotton
mouth, literally.

00:19:39.837 --> 00:19:42.170
They've got to buy dental
drills and all kinds of stuff.

00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:44.310
And basically what they're
doing is aggregating.

00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:46.600
Fragmented demand,
fragmented supply,

00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:48.420
and they bring the two
together and extract

00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:51.714
a lot of economic
rents by doing that.

00:19:51.714 --> 00:19:54.130
One thing to watch for here
is that one reason the network

00:19:54.130 --> 00:19:56.710
effect works so well
is the non-linearity

00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:58.640
of nodes versus connections.

00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:03.500
So if you have a web, and the
number of nodes in that web

00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:06.650
goes from one to two to three to
four, the number of connections

00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:08.680
increases exponentially.

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:11.680
So that is something that
makes it very hard to replicate

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:15.570
a network once the network gains
scale, something that Googlers

00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:17.854
should be pretty
familiar with, I think.

00:20:17.854 --> 00:20:19.520
One thing you want
to watch for, though,

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:22.340
is radial versus
interactive networks.

00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:24.480
So the interactive
network is what I just

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:27.870
described, the web, where each
node interacts with the other.

00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:30.579
A radial network
is less valuable.

00:20:30.579 --> 00:20:32.620
So this is a good lesson
I learned at Morningstar

00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:34.390
when we looked at Western Union.

00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:38.137
So Western Union helps people
send money from place to place.

00:20:38.137 --> 00:20:40.470
And they talk about, we have
the most number of branches

00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:41.980
of any money
transfer organization

00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:44.040
in the world, which is true.

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:47.030
The problem is that no one is
sending money from Bangladesh

00:20:47.030 --> 00:20:48.740
to Mexico City.

00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:52.090
They're sending money for Mexico
City to Chicago or from Mexico

00:20:52.090 --> 00:20:54.739
City to LA or from
Bangladesh to Chicago.

00:20:54.739 --> 00:20:56.530
We have a huge Bangladeshi
community there.

00:20:56.530 --> 00:20:58.155
No one is sending
money from Bangladesh

00:20:58.155 --> 00:20:59.430
to Mexico City or vice versa.

00:20:59.430 --> 00:21:01.200
So that route means nothing.

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:04.500
So it's basically a series of
channels, a series of spokes,

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:07.290
off different nodes that
are easier for a competitor

00:21:07.290 --> 00:21:10.500
to pick off by underpricing
service in that node.

00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:13.420
So radial networks are
much, much less robust

00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:16.440
than interactive ones, we found.

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:19.270
And then the final type
of moat-- cost advantages.

00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:21.916
This is kind of
self-explanatory.

00:21:21.916 --> 00:21:24.040
But the thing is, there's
a couple differences here

00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:26.456
that you should look for when
you're looking at companies.

00:21:26.456 --> 00:21:28.900
A process-based
advantage is basically

00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:30.980
inventing a cheaper
way to do something

00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:32.560
that is hard to
replicate quickly.

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:33.540
Southwest did this.

00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:34.150
Dell did this.

00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:35.280
Ryanair did this.

00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:38.590
Inditext, which owns the Zara
brand you may be familiar with,

00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:40.790
is great example.

00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:43.250
They had their clothes
made in Sri Lanka,

00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:46.436
the clothes made in Bangladesh
because it was really cheap.

00:21:46.436 --> 00:21:48.185
But of course, because
of transport links,

00:21:48.185 --> 00:21:51.240
you have to basically
make a fashion

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:53.040
bet six months in advance.

00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:55.495
What Inditext figured out was
that if they near shore it,

00:21:55.495 --> 00:21:57.300
if they get the stuff
made in North Africa,

00:21:57.300 --> 00:21:59.030
get the stuff made
in Eastern Europe,

00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:01.100
they can have much
faster response times,

00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:03.900
much faster responses to
different fashion trends.

00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:05.320
Now, you can copy that, right?

00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:06.150
You can copy that.

00:22:06.150 --> 00:22:08.950
But it works pretty well
while you're doing it.

00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:13.850
And so process-based cost
advantages tend to work well.

00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:15.630
But then they get
copied eventually.

00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:18.180
Southwest no longer
has the lowest cost

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:19.370
per available seat mile.

00:22:19.370 --> 00:22:21.620
People saw what they
did and copied it.

00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:24.970
Scale, by contrast, when
you spread your fixed costs

00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:28.690
over a large base, that tends
to be much, much more robust.

00:22:28.690 --> 00:22:31.770
So think about this big
network of brown UPS vans

00:22:31.770 --> 00:22:33.290
going around a neighborhood.

00:22:33.290 --> 00:22:36.510
What's the additional cost
of putting one more package

00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:37.900
on the UPS van?

00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:39.140
De minimus, right?

00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:41.990
And so your margin on
that is very, very high.

00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:44.360
It's very difficult to compete.

00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:48.460
A good example is DHL, which
is a wonderfully run business,

00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:50.920
has a very dense
network in Europe.

00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:54.830
They lost over a
billion dollars trying

00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:58.050
to compete with UPS and FedEx
in the ground market in the US.

00:22:58.050 --> 00:23:00.966
They couldn't do it simply
because they couldn't scale up.

00:23:00.966 --> 00:23:02.340
There weren't as
many yellow vans

00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:05.360
as there were brown vans
and blue-and-white vans.

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:08.590
Scale-based advantages,
especially in distribution,

00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:11.284
are incredibly robust.

00:23:11.284 --> 00:23:12.700
And you can have
a niche where you

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:14.660
establish a minimum
efficient scale.

00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:17.200
There are some niches,
some industries,

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:20.090
that can only profitably
support one or two players.

00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:23.690
If another player comes in,
spends the money to get in,

00:23:23.690 --> 00:23:26.200
returns come down so that
nobody makes any money,

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:29.804
so that new entrant never
comes in the market.

00:23:29.804 --> 00:23:32.220
The businesses often can't
grow very well, because they're

00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:36.089
kind of trapped there, but they
can be enormously profitable.

00:23:36.089 --> 00:23:37.130
So what about management?

00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:40.372
You notice I haven't said a
word about management yet.

00:23:40.372 --> 00:23:42.080
There's a great quote
from Warren Buffett

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:44.590
that, "Good jockeys will
do well on good horses

00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:48.170
but not on broken-down nags."

00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:51.390
So this is a professional
jockey on a goat.

00:23:51.390 --> 00:23:53.290
He is a very good manager.

00:23:53.290 --> 00:23:58.050
Sadly, he is on a bad
vehicle called a goat.

00:23:58.050 --> 00:24:01.990
So if you enter this in a race,
he is probably going to lose.

00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:04.640
By contrast, if you got
me, and I don't even

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:07.570
know how to ride a horse,
as long as I don't fall off,

00:24:07.570 --> 00:24:09.480
I probably beat the goat.

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:11.550
Because the horse
is better suited

00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:13.147
for winning races than the goat.

00:24:13.147 --> 00:24:14.980
You're not going to get
much milk out of it.

00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:16.400
The goat is better for that.

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:19.280
But it's very well
suited for winning races.

00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:22.800
So the key here is that you
want to get a good horse.

00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:24.520
You want to look
for good horses.

00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:26.470
Its not that the
jockey is irrelevant.

00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:28.860
It's that even the best
jockey, if he's on a goat,

00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:31.600
isn't going to make you a lot
of money or win many races.

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:35.310
Managers matter in the
context of the moat.

00:24:35.310 --> 00:24:37.280
And the way to think
about this is very simple.

00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:39.950
The required level
of managerial skill

00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:43.730
is inversely related to the
quality of the business.

00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:46.250
The worst the business,
the better the manager.

00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:50.050
The better the business--
eh-- as long as management

00:24:50.050 --> 00:24:52.500
isn't that stupid,
you'll do fine.

00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:54.690
If it's a really bad
business, you better

00:24:54.690 --> 00:24:56.240
have an awesome manager.

00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:57.980
This is Ryanair.

00:24:57.980 --> 00:25:00.790
O'Leary is a absolute genius.

00:25:00.790 --> 00:25:04.090
He's a jerk and customers
hate flying Ryanair,

00:25:04.090 --> 00:25:07.600
but he has created an
amazing, amazing business.

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:12.290
Ryanair is scale
advantages to die for.

00:25:12.290 --> 00:25:17.190
By contrast, if you have a great
business, genius is not needed.

00:25:17.190 --> 00:25:19.600
You saw where this
was going, I know.

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:21.490
What that actually
means is, here's

00:25:21.490 --> 00:25:25.670
what's happened to Microsoft's
moat while I've been in charge.

00:25:25.670 --> 00:25:28.580
Again, it's an easy target
here at Google, but it's true.

00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:30.370
I mean, Steve
Ballmer essentially

00:25:30.370 --> 00:25:32.445
spent 12 years setting
money on fire at Microsoft

00:25:32.445 --> 00:25:33.505
as far as I can tell.

00:25:33.505 --> 00:25:35.700
AUDIENCE: What do you
think about Twitter?

00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:38.770
PAT DORSEY: Well, Twitter--
I never followed it much.

00:25:38.770 --> 00:25:42.630
And also that was
no pun intended.

00:25:42.630 --> 00:25:44.480
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:47.382
The question was,
what about Twitter?

00:25:47.382 --> 00:25:49.590
I haven't figured out what
the monetization model is.

00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:50.840
I haven't figured out
how they make money.

00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:52.210
I mean, they may have
some secret theory.

00:25:52.210 --> 00:25:53.430
I just don't know what it is.

00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:55.110
But I haven't spent
much time on it,

00:25:55.110 --> 00:25:56.640
although I think it was
founded by a guy named Dorsey,

00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:57.610
wasn't it?

00:25:57.610 --> 00:26:00.040
Anyway, I probably
should look at it.

00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:03.260
So the key here is that moats
can buffer management mistakes.

00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:07.020
Microsoft minted money
despite Steve Ballmer,

00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:11.950
despite them shoveling
dirt in the moat every day.

00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:13.970
The core office, the
core Windows franchises

00:26:13.970 --> 00:26:16.400
were strong enough that
the business overall

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:18.460
maintained pretty high
returns on capital.

00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:21.800
New Coke didn't kill
Coca-Cola because the business

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:22.880
was robust enough.

00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:24.590
The brand is strong enough.

00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:27.750
Moody's put profits
before integrity,

00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:31.510
actively screwed
investors, and still

00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:34.180
cranked out a 40%
operating margin.

00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:36.590
That's a pretty good moat.

00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:38.920
But even a genius
like David Neeleman

00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:41.670
couldn't change the fact that
JetBlue is an airline, which

00:26:41.670 --> 00:26:44.910
is the worst industry
known to mankind.

00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:46.244
I mean, he's an amazing manager.

00:26:46.244 --> 00:26:48.826
If you've ever met him, read any
of his books, seen him speak,

00:26:48.826 --> 00:26:49.590
he's incredible.

00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:51.500
He's inspirational.

00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:54.060
JetBlue was like 30-odd times
earnings when it went public.

00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:58.080
Because it had
leather seats and TV?

00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:00.950
I mean, an airline will
never have lower costs

00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:03.400
than the day it
opens for business.

00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:03.900
Why?

00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:05.290
Planes don't get newer.

00:27:05.290 --> 00:27:07.790
They get older.

00:27:07.790 --> 00:27:09.580
Employees don't
get less seniority.

00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:10.760
They get more.

00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:12.540
So the planes cost more to run.

00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:14.250
The employees want more money.

00:27:14.250 --> 00:27:17.540
So the cost structure is
inevitably bound to decline.

00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:21.940
Again, great jockey on a goat.

00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:24.050
Good managers are
constantly looking for ways

00:27:24.050 --> 00:27:26.310
to widen a company's moat.

00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:29.320
Think about Amazon's focus
on the customer experience.

00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:30.820
It's not so much about scale.

00:27:30.820 --> 00:27:33.390
It's about the
customer experience.

00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:35.110
Here's a great-- let
me try this here.

00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:37.430
I've tried this at other
talks around the world.

00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:39.279
How many of you bought
something off Amazon

00:27:39.279 --> 00:27:40.820
without checking
the price elsewhere?

00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:45.970
OK, that's like 2/3,
3/4 of the hands.

00:27:45.970 --> 00:27:48.960
Isn't that an amazing
statistic right there?

00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:51.680
I mean, how hard is it to
click to another website?

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:54.210
What's the caloric cost
of moving your mouse?

00:27:54.210 --> 00:27:56.750
It's not high, right?

00:27:56.750 --> 00:28:00.320
But I've talked to about 45
CFA societies around the world.

00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:02.510
I get about the same
number of hands that go up,

00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:03.520
except in Germany.

00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:07.559
The Germans didn't
seem to-- Amazon

00:28:07.559 --> 00:28:08.850
has not been as-- there's more.

00:28:08.850 --> 00:28:09.530
There's Zalando.

00:28:09.530 --> 00:28:11.113
There's a lot of
other etailers there.

00:28:11.113 --> 00:28:12.960
But in the US, this is
the response you get.

00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:15.790
And a lot of this is the
customer experience, right?

00:28:15.790 --> 00:28:18.320
Trust matters more
online than offline.

00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:21.530
And I give Amazon enormous
credit for figuring this out

00:28:21.530 --> 00:28:24.950
early, that offline in a
regular physical store,

00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:28.700
I give you money, you give me
a good, and we're finished.

00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:30.850
There's no trust involved.

00:28:30.850 --> 00:28:33.680
Online, I have to trust you
to send me what I ordered.

00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:35.930
I have to trust you don't
steal my credit card number.

00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:38.060
I have to trust it arrives
when you say it will.

00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:40.950
I have to trust you'll take
it back if you say you will.

00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:42.460
There's a lot of trust involved.

00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:45.692
And that enabled the ability
to build a moat, build

00:28:45.692 --> 00:28:49.520
a brand in retailing, which
is a really tough industry

00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:50.880
to do that in.

00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:54.280
Think about Costco's focus on
using scale to lower costs.

00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:58.060
Costco gets bigger, cost savings
go right back to the customer.

00:28:58.060 --> 00:28:59.610
That brings in more
customers, which

00:28:59.610 --> 00:29:02.180
allows more cost savings that
go right back to the customer.

00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:03.760
That's what drives
their business.

00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:06.180
That's all they think
about every day.

00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:09.330
Now by contrast, bad
managers invest capital

00:29:09.330 --> 00:29:12.580
outside a company's moat,
which lowers overall returns

00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:13.620
on capital.

00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:17.370
This process is called
de-worse-ification, or setting

00:29:17.370 --> 00:29:20.980
fire to large piles of cash, OK?

00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:24.290
This is basically what you don't
want to see a company doing.

00:29:24.290 --> 00:29:27.980
Example-- Cisco moving into
consumer markets, the Netgear

00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:29.560
acquisition, I think it was.

00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:31.940
What on earth was that?

00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:35.420
You had this gorgeous, sticky
business in enterprise,

00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:39.050
and you start selling consumer
electronics that any moron just

00:29:39.050 --> 00:29:41.500
buys off the shelf
at Circuit City?

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:43.251
My set-top box at home
used to be a Cisco,

00:29:43.251 --> 00:29:45.083
and I could just curse
that thing every time

00:29:45.083 --> 00:29:45.940
I looked at it.

00:29:45.940 --> 00:29:47.523
Because it was just
the worst business

00:29:47.523 --> 00:29:49.890
to go into-- fast
product cycles,

00:29:49.890 --> 00:29:51.840
no competitive advantage.

00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:53.590
The whole network-centered comb.

00:29:53.590 --> 00:29:55.220
So what?

00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:57.440
Remember Garmin?

00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:01.130
Anybody remember
the Nuvi handset?

00:30:01.130 --> 00:30:01.630
Nobody?

00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:04.960
OK, so Garmin had this
great franchise, partially

00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:07.055
in GPS devices in
your car, but also

00:30:07.055 --> 00:30:09.370
a much better
franchise in avionics.

00:30:09.370 --> 00:30:12.100
So business jets,
regional jets often

00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:15.909
have Garmin as the
GPS device in there.

00:30:15.909 --> 00:30:18.200
You own a plane, you really
want to know where you are.

00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:21.400
So that business was a
very good, sticky business.

00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:26.330
And so they see, oh, gosh,
GPS is going from a product

00:30:26.330 --> 00:30:30.310
to a feature that's basically
just a feature of a smartphone.

00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:32.970
Oh, let's not relaxed
to the inevitable

00:30:32.970 --> 00:30:34.400
and just get out
of the business.

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:36.390
Let's double down
and go into handsets

00:30:36.390 --> 00:30:41.010
and compete with Ericsson and
Nokia-- completely moronic.

00:30:41.010 --> 00:30:43.880
And so again, you see
investing outside the moat--

00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:46.340
you see a business do
that out of weakness

00:30:46.340 --> 00:30:48.090
as opposed to out of
strength when they're

00:30:48.090 --> 00:30:50.930
trying to maintain
growth, like Cisco did.

00:30:50.930 --> 00:30:52.186
It's a horrible sign.

00:30:52.186 --> 00:30:52.810
Yep-- question?

00:30:52.810 --> 00:30:54.434
AUDIENCE: How do you
differentiate that

00:30:54.434 --> 00:30:55.642
from the innovator?

00:30:55.642 --> 00:30:56.600
Like Good, for example.

00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:58.010
PAT DORSEY: Great question,
and I knew this was coming.

00:30:58.010 --> 00:30:59.610
I knew this was coming.

00:30:59.610 --> 00:31:01.610
So the question is how
do you differentiate that

00:31:01.610 --> 00:31:02.720
from being innovative?

00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:04.950
Because Google is doing
it out of strength, right?

00:31:04.950 --> 00:31:07.450
Google is not doing
it to preserve growth

00:31:07.450 --> 00:31:09.900
or because their core
business is dying.

00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:13.750
Google is doing it as a way of
planting seeds for hopefully

00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:15.470
a great business in the future.

00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:18.059
And it's a subtle
difference, but the key thing

00:31:18.059 --> 00:31:19.350
is it's coming out of strength.

00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:21.450
Google's core business
isn't going down.

00:31:21.450 --> 00:31:25.150
It's when you see a company's
core business either slowing

00:31:25.150 --> 00:31:27.970
or the competitive
advantage eroding,

00:31:27.970 --> 00:31:34.370
and they try to basically invest
outside that to bump up growth.

00:31:34.370 --> 00:31:35.790
So Cisco, one of
the reasons they

00:31:35.790 --> 00:31:37.990
went into consumer
electronics, Netgear,

00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:40.900
was to compensate for the
fact that the enterprise

00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:43.420
market was slowing down.

00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:46.860
Or you can just say, hey, guys,
we'll grow at 6% and now 16%

00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:47.650
anymore.

00:31:47.650 --> 00:31:49.650
That would have been the
more rational response.

00:31:49.650 --> 00:31:51.400
Instead, they go out
and take a blow torch

00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:54.445
to dry pallets of cash by
buying-- oh, remember the Flip?

00:31:54.445 --> 00:31:56.230
Remember the Flip?

00:31:56.230 --> 00:32:01.550
$800 million on basically
a little video camera

00:32:01.550 --> 00:32:04.950
that will about six
months be in your phone.

00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:07.030
I mean, you know,
again, out of weakness

00:32:07.030 --> 00:32:08.670
versus out of strength.

00:32:08.670 --> 00:32:09.600
Yep, another question.

00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:12.000
AUDIENCE: How much of
this kind of stupidity

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.120
is correlated with the fact
that these businesses that

00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:17.928
are sometimes wide moats
are not [INAUDIBLE]?

00:32:17.928 --> 00:32:20.011
Imagine if you have an
owner-operator and he would

00:32:20.011 --> 00:32:21.410
not--

00:32:21.410 --> 00:32:23.009
PAT DORSEY: Yeah,
so the question

00:32:23.009 --> 00:32:24.550
is sort of how much
of this stupidity

00:32:24.550 --> 00:32:29.720
is correlated to businesses that
aren't run by owner-operators?

00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:32.070
I think it's a good--
John Chambers owned

00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:33.730
a decent chunk of Cisco.

00:32:33.730 --> 00:32:35.600
But I do think you
see it less frequently

00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:37.180
with owner-operator businesses.

00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:40.300
You see it more frequently with
businesses run by hired hands,

00:32:40.300 --> 00:32:42.410
where if the CEO
gets leaves, he'll

00:32:42.410 --> 00:32:44.960
get a giant golden parachute
and he goes off and plays

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:48.080
golf and nobody's the worse
off, except the poor sacks who

00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:49.730
owned the stock.

00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:52.330
So I think by having
an owner-operator,

00:32:52.330 --> 00:32:54.960
you lessen this chance.

00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:56.860
But they're not infallible.

00:32:56.860 --> 00:33:00.110
I mean, the danger
is when you have

00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:02.460
businesses that can't
relax to change.

00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:04.630
And especially you see
this a lot, actually,

00:33:04.630 --> 00:33:05.810
with tech companies.

00:33:05.810 --> 00:33:08.450
Not, not just tech companies,
but companies when they mature.

00:33:08.450 --> 00:33:09.480
So this happened to McDonald's.

00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:11.896
It happened to Home Depot,
happened to Starbucks, happened

00:33:11.896 --> 00:33:14.010
to Cisco, happened to Microsoft.

00:33:14.010 --> 00:33:17.820
As they get larger and have to
go from being growth companies

00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:20.820
to be mature
companies, they start

00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:23.700
continuing to act like
teenagers when they're actually

00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:24.430
in their 50s.

00:33:24.430 --> 00:33:25.888
It's like the
50-year-old guy who's

00:33:25.888 --> 00:33:27.250
trying to date a 20-year-old.

00:33:27.250 --> 00:33:29.150
It's just inappropriate.

00:33:29.150 --> 00:33:30.890
And it's the same
thing when you're

00:33:30.890 --> 00:33:33.330
a super successful
business like Starbucks.

00:33:33.330 --> 00:33:35.920
And they just kept opening new
stores, opening new stores.

00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:37.920
I remember there was a
great "Onion" story once,

00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:40.180
Starbucks opened Starbucks
in Starbucks' bathroom.

00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:42.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:43.990
Because they were just
everywhere, right?

00:33:43.990 --> 00:33:46.300
And Howard Schultz
came back and realized

00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:48.620
that the return on capital
for these new stores

00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:50.230
was really not very high.

00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:52.900
And so the better way
to allocate capital

00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:55.330
was not to open crap
loads of new stores,

00:33:55.330 --> 00:33:57.600
it was slow openings
and focus on making

00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:01.320
more money, increasing ticket
sizes, introducing food

00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:03.910
and so forth, at
existing stores.

00:34:03.910 --> 00:34:08.330
So I mean, many businesses
go through this transition.

00:34:08.330 --> 00:34:10.746
So we'll get the Joker
off the screen there.

00:34:10.746 --> 00:34:12.494
Now there is, I should
say, an exception

00:34:12.494 --> 00:34:14.460
to every rule about
sort of management

00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:17.800
and the horse being more
important than the jockey.

00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:20.170
There are a tiny
minority of managers

00:34:20.170 --> 00:34:24.679
who can create enormous value
via astute capital allocation,

00:34:24.679 --> 00:34:27.339
even if they don't
start with great horses.

00:34:27.339 --> 00:34:29.630
Warren Buffett at Berkshire
started with a textile mill

00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:30.750
for God's sake.

00:34:30.750 --> 00:34:33.739
Brian Joffe at Bidvest, which
is a South African firm,

00:34:33.739 --> 00:34:35.030
started with nothing.

00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:38.139
And now they do logistics,
they do distribution,

00:34:38.139 --> 00:34:40.650
they do food service--
amazing business.

00:34:40.650 --> 00:34:42.780
Dick Kovacevich at Wells
Fargo-- and banking

00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:45.761
is tough business,
really tough business.

00:34:45.761 --> 00:34:47.469
But what Kovacevich
and Stomphe have done

00:34:47.469 --> 00:34:49.179
is nothing short of amazing.

00:34:49.179 --> 00:34:50.989
Steven M. Rales at
Danaher-- Danaher

00:34:50.989 --> 00:34:53.389
has actually beaten Berkshire
in the past 20 years

00:34:53.389 --> 00:34:55.000
in terms of shareholder returns.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.900
It started off selling
industrial pumps.

00:34:57.900 --> 00:35:00.220
And they bought Beckman
Coulter a few years ago,

00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:01.300
big diagnostics firm.

00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:04.280
So again, there is an
exception to every rule.

00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:06.510
There is a tiny
minority of managers

00:35:06.510 --> 00:35:09.620
that can make something
out of not much.

00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:10.820
So keep an eye out for them.

00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:14.060
They're hard to find,
false positives abound,

00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:16.410
but these guys can create
enormous wealth over time.

00:35:16.410 --> 00:35:19.194
So just to kind of sideline
from the moat conversation,

00:35:19.194 --> 00:35:21.110
but my point here-- I
don't want you to go out

00:35:21.110 --> 00:35:24.170
of here thinking management
is irrelevant, because there

00:35:24.170 --> 00:35:25.590
is this tiny
minority of guys that

00:35:25.590 --> 00:35:27.030
can just do amazing things.

00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:28.260
Yeah, there's a question
there in the back?

00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:30.385
AUDIENCE: I was wondering
what's the role of chance

00:35:30.385 --> 00:35:32.910
in all of this, in the
examples of products

00:35:32.910 --> 00:35:35.540
that are created like New Coke.

00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:37.710
Maybe they should not
have done that and so on.

00:35:37.710 --> 00:35:39.550
For every New Coke
that did not work out,

00:35:39.550 --> 00:35:41.740
maybe there is another
product by some other company

00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:42.519
that did work out.

00:35:42.519 --> 00:35:44.060
PAT DORSEY: Sadly,
investing does not

00:35:44.060 --> 00:35:47.640
lend itself well to
statistical proof.

00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:49.410
Because you have
individual examples

00:35:49.410 --> 00:35:51.810
where you had highly
skewed results,

00:35:51.810 --> 00:35:54.610
where you have this huge, long
tail where a few companies do

00:35:54.610 --> 00:35:58.100
incredibly well, and a
very small number do OK.

00:35:58.100 --> 00:35:59.530
You probably would
enjoy reading--

00:35:59.530 --> 00:36:05.060
there's a recent book by
some Deloitte guys called

00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:08.840
"Three Rules" where they did
a pretty rigorous statistical

00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:13.300
analysis on returns on
capital and then went back,

00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:18.440
and they did a whole bunch
of pairwise analysis.

00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:21.000
They did a lot of controlling
for industry factors

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:24.000
to try to kind of eliminate
the odds of luck happening

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.450
with things and looking sort
of at what characteristics

00:36:27.450 --> 00:36:30.110
identified businesses that
were likely to succeed over

00:36:30.110 --> 00:36:31.470
a long period of time.

00:36:31.470 --> 00:36:33.760
But there is a luck
component to this, right?

00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:38.790
I mean, example from Berkshire
Hathaway-- Warren Buffett

00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:42.130
early on went to Washington,
DC, on the weekend

00:36:42.130 --> 00:36:45.150
to try to learn about
insurance at Geico.

00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:46.270
He got the janitor.

00:36:46.270 --> 00:36:48.830
He basically banged
on the door of Geico.

00:36:48.830 --> 00:36:51.540
And I can't remember the
manager's name-- one of you

00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:54.180
Buffett nuts probably
remembers-- let him in

00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:57.430
and basically gave him
like a five-hour lesson

00:36:57.430 --> 00:37:00.240
on how to do insurance well.

00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:03.390
If that hadn't
happened, would he

00:37:03.390 --> 00:37:05.360
have really gotten
the early tutelage

00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:08.270
in insurance then created
what Berkshire became?

00:37:08.270 --> 00:37:09.600
Maybe not.

00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:15.800
So my point here is simply
luck happens, right?

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:17.130
Chance is part of it.

00:37:17.130 --> 00:37:22.800
But your choice is either
say, this stuff is unknowable

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:24.400
and I'm just going
to index, which

00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:27.490
is a completely rational
thing to do, by the way,

00:37:27.490 --> 00:37:30.970
or if we want to try to
identify these businesses,

00:37:30.970 --> 00:37:33.220
we look for common
characteristics

00:37:33.220 --> 00:37:36.140
that seem to have held up
over long periods of time.

00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:40.140
But there is a role of chance in
creating successful companies.

00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:44.040
And that's a weakness
of like "Good to Great,"

00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:46.690
the "Built to Last," and lot
of these success studies.

00:37:46.690 --> 00:37:49.110
You would also enjoy a book
called "The Halo Effect,"

00:37:49.110 --> 00:37:53.010
which really does a great
job kind of basically

00:37:53.010 --> 00:37:56.190
disintegrating the
idea of the hero CEO.

00:37:56.190 --> 00:37:57.720
It's a really good book.

00:37:57.720 --> 00:37:58.220
Yeah.

00:37:58.220 --> 00:37:59.920
AUDIENCE: So you talked about
two possible approaches.

00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:01.670
What about the
third one where we

00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:03.920
know for a large
number of businesses,

00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:05.700
especially the
majority of businesses,

00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:08.570
returns are going
to revert to mean,

00:38:08.570 --> 00:38:13.920
and temporarily you can
see certain businesses

00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:17.550
there are times extremely
low, and maybe the valuation

00:38:17.550 --> 00:38:19.520
is even lower.

00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:22.250
And it kind of does
not reflect the fact

00:38:22.250 --> 00:38:24.210
that maybe over time
it will revert to mean.

00:38:24.210 --> 00:38:27.070
And maybe you can identify
certain industry--

00:38:27.070 --> 00:38:28.596
PAT DORSEY: So these are the--

00:38:28.596 --> 00:38:29.470
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:29.470 --> 00:38:31.120
PAT DORSEY: --crappy businesses
that go to being semi-crappy.

00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:31.869
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:38:31.869 --> 00:38:33.327
PAT DORSEY: No, I
mean, I know what

00:38:33.327 --> 00:38:34.702
you mean, the
businesses that are

00:38:34.702 --> 00:38:38.100
sort of low returns on capital
that go up to the average.

00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:41.380
Look, that's sort of traditional
value investing, right?

00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:43.690
So to find the
business that's priced

00:38:43.690 --> 00:38:46.340
as if it's going to go out of
business, and if it survives,

00:38:46.340 --> 00:38:47.960
you do pretty well, right?

00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:50.250
Or it goes from a
2% margin business

00:38:50.250 --> 00:38:52.050
to a 5% margin business.

00:38:52.050 --> 00:38:54.320
That is a fine way to invest.

00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:56.770
Typically these are not
kind of moat-y businesses.

00:38:56.770 --> 00:38:59.400
It's more what we call kind
of cigar button investing.

00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:02.590
Again, you can make
plenty of money that way.

00:39:02.590 --> 00:39:04.890
It's not how I choose to
invest, but plenty of people

00:39:04.890 --> 00:39:06.700
make lots of money that way.

00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:09.850
What I would say
is the only issue

00:39:09.850 --> 00:39:11.620
if you're going to
pursue that approach

00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:13.800
is time is not your friend.

00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:15.300
Because the intrinsic
value of those

00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:17.500
businesses is
declining over time.

00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:19.450
And if they don't
turn around quickly,

00:39:19.450 --> 00:39:21.710
you're left with
a declining asset.

00:39:21.710 --> 00:39:24.230
Whereas there's a great
quote from Bob Goldfarb

00:39:24.230 --> 00:39:26.700
at the Sequoia
Fund that "time is

00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:30.190
the friend of the wonderful
business," which is true.

00:39:30.190 --> 00:39:32.050
Because it builds
value over time.

00:39:32.050 --> 00:39:35.080
And that becomes a sort of an
additional margin of safety.

00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:39.080
So again, if you are going to go
kind of for deep value dumpster

00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:41.410
diving, you can
make a lot of money,

00:39:41.410 --> 00:39:46.440
but just be aware of
timing is all I'm saying.

00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:50.220
Because what you're buying is
probably declining in value.

00:39:50.220 --> 00:39:52.070
So just in a global
context, I think

00:39:52.070 --> 00:39:55.320
it's important to remember local
differences can create moats,

00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:57.620
OK?

00:39:57.620 --> 00:40:00.730
Foreign companies aren't
allowed to own banks in Canada.

00:40:00.730 --> 00:40:02.610
Thus, the Canadian
banks will always

00:40:02.610 --> 00:40:05.180
be insanely profitable,
much more profitable

00:40:05.180 --> 00:40:08.070
than banks in almost any
other part of the world.

00:40:08.070 --> 00:40:09.640
In Germany-- this
is a great one.

00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:11.610
Most German
municipalities don't allow

00:40:11.610 --> 00:40:14.130
you to wash your car in your
driveway or on the street.

00:40:14.130 --> 00:40:15.679
These are environmental
regulations.

00:40:15.679 --> 00:40:17.720
So car washing is actually
a pretty good business

00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:18.364
in Germany.

00:40:18.364 --> 00:40:19.780
Because Germans
like cars, and you

00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:21.889
can't wash in your
driveway, right?

00:40:21.889 --> 00:40:23.430
And so there's a
pretty good business

00:40:23.430 --> 00:40:26.550
called WashTec that makes
money basically providing

00:40:26.550 --> 00:40:29.290
all the consumables, the
detergents and stuff,

00:40:29.290 --> 00:40:30.410
in car washes.

00:40:30.410 --> 00:40:32.730
This business could
not exist in the US.

00:40:32.730 --> 00:40:34.630
So that's a local difference.

00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:36.550
So they can create moats.

00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:39.660
You also see minimum efficient
scale being more common.

00:40:39.660 --> 00:40:42.120
So retailing is a tough
business in the US.

00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:44.690
Because it's a huge
market, easy to come in.

00:40:44.690 --> 00:40:48.010
South African retailers
have returns on capital

00:40:48.010 --> 00:40:49.832
that make Costco
look like an airline.

00:40:49.832 --> 00:40:51.290
It's not entirely
true, but they're

00:40:51.290 --> 00:40:52.760
great returns on capital.

00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:53.870
And the reason is simple.

00:40:53.870 --> 00:40:56.040
It's a relatively small market.

00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:58.580
And once you've got the
two or three big players,

00:40:58.580 --> 00:41:00.510
it's really hard for
anybody else to compete.

00:41:00.510 --> 00:41:01.940
And global players
aren't going to come in,

00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:03.250
because it's just not
that big a market.

00:41:03.250 --> 00:41:04.500
Why am I going to
bother spending a ton

00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:06.270
of money coming in
to South Africa?

00:41:06.270 --> 00:41:07.924
Walmart recently came
in, but they just

00:41:07.924 --> 00:41:08.840
bought a local player.

00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:11.450
They didn't try to
come in on themselves.

00:41:11.450 --> 00:41:13.720
BEC World is the
largest producer

00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:15.640
of Thai language media.

00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:19.140
So if you want to watch a
soap opera in Thailand, a news

00:41:19.140 --> 00:41:22.140
broadcast, they own most
of the pay TV channels.

00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:23.265
It's awesome business.

00:41:25.930 --> 00:41:28.180
I mean, Thailand
is a big country.

00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:30.590
Thai is not as commonly
spoken as, say, English.

00:41:30.590 --> 00:41:32.257
So now you have
minimum-efficient scale.

00:41:32.257 --> 00:41:34.381
The odds that you have a
competitor coming in there

00:41:34.381 --> 00:41:37.230
are lower than if you created,
say, English-language content.

00:41:37.230 --> 00:41:40.100
And then you also have
cultural preferences.

00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:44.660
For example, beer travels--
beer can often be exported.

00:41:44.660 --> 00:41:46.660
I mean, when I was
in Macau last week,

00:41:46.660 --> 00:41:48.342
Carlsberg all over the place.

00:41:48.342 --> 00:41:49.050
It's crappy beer.

00:41:49.050 --> 00:41:49.950
I don't know why.

00:41:49.950 --> 00:41:52.791
But Carlsberg seemed
to be doing well there.

00:41:52.791 --> 00:41:54.190
Beer travels pretty well.

00:41:54.190 --> 00:41:55.890
Spirits travel pretty well.

00:41:55.890 --> 00:41:58.340
Candy and snacks don't.

00:41:58.340 --> 00:42:01.170
The snacks you grew up with,
the candy you grew up with,

00:42:01.170 --> 00:42:03.840
is what you will probably
eat the rest of your life.

00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:06.330
You try to sell
Hershey's in the UK,

00:42:06.330 --> 00:42:09.130
and they say it basically
tastes like cardboard.

00:42:09.130 --> 00:42:12.000
Whereas Cadbury to most
Americans is much too sweet.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.610
And like the Mexicans had
this chocolate bar called

00:42:14.610 --> 00:42:16.930
Carlos Quinto,
which basically is

00:42:16.930 --> 00:42:18.650
cardboard as far as I can tell.

00:42:18.650 --> 00:42:19.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:19.150 --> 00:42:20.650
Like the bar,
actually, because they

00:42:20.650 --> 00:42:22.320
have to change the
packaging in the US,

00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:25.360
actually says,
chocolate-style bar.

00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:29.160
It's like Kraft and
"cheese product."

00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:29.840
Esh.

00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:33.530
But anyway, Calbee
is a company in Japan

00:42:33.530 --> 00:42:35.710
that makes Japanese
snacks that are never

00:42:35.710 --> 00:42:37.030
going to see in the US.

00:42:37.030 --> 00:42:39.580
But Frito Lay ain't gonna
sell much in Japan, either.

00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:41.710
So these cultural
differences can create moats

00:42:41.710 --> 00:42:43.424
in different countries.

00:42:43.424 --> 00:42:44.590
So why does all this matter?

00:42:44.590 --> 00:42:45.798
Why am I talking about moats?

00:42:45.798 --> 00:42:46.730
Who cares?

00:42:46.730 --> 00:42:50.180
Pretty simple-- moats
add intrinsic value.

00:42:50.180 --> 00:42:54.010
A company that can compound cash
flow for many years is simply

00:42:54.010 --> 00:42:55.984
worth more than a
firm that can't.

00:42:55.984 --> 00:42:57.650
And you can think
about this here simply

00:42:57.650 --> 00:42:59.066
with you've got
returns on capital

00:42:59.066 --> 00:43:02.800
on the vertical axis, time
on the horizontal axis.

00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:05.280
And for the no-moat
business, returns on capital

00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:07.610
come down pretty fast
as competition comes in.

00:43:07.610 --> 00:43:09.555
So there's less time
for value to compound

00:43:09.555 --> 00:43:11.220
as you reinvest cash.

00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:14.320
For the wide-moat business,
you have longer span of time

00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:18.032
to reinvest capital at a high
incremental rate of return.

00:43:18.032 --> 00:43:20.657
Now this brings up the
question of valuing moats.

00:43:20.657 --> 00:43:22.490
And if you're looking
at a business thinking

00:43:22.490 --> 00:43:25.110
about investing in
a moat-y company,

00:43:25.110 --> 00:43:29.420
the value is largely dependent
on reinvestment opportunities.

00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:32.670
The ability to reinvest cash
at a high incremental rate

00:43:32.670 --> 00:43:34.930
of return is a
very valuable moat.

00:43:34.930 --> 00:43:37.330
If you can plow that cash
back into the business,

00:43:37.330 --> 00:43:40.360
continue to take market share,
expand your addressable market,

00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:42.800
give a long runway
ahead of you, that

00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:45.725
makes a business worth paying
a pretty high multiple for.

00:43:45.725 --> 00:43:48.266
Somebody mentioned to me Whitney
Tilson was here a while ago.

00:43:48.266 --> 00:43:50.016
He said he didn't buy
Google kind of early

00:43:50.016 --> 00:43:53.080
on because the PE was high,
that Google had this opportunity

00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:57.170
to reinvest in the
moat in a huge way.

00:43:57.170 --> 00:43:58.390
Fastenal has this.

00:43:58.390 --> 00:44:00.230
XPO, which is a
logistics company

00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:02.460
that does truck
brokerage-- same thing.

00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:06.970
By contrast, if a firm has
little ability to reinvest,

00:44:06.970 --> 00:44:09.260
the moat doesn't add
much to intrinsic value.

00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:10.510
It adds certainty.

00:44:10.510 --> 00:44:11.840
It adds confidence.

00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:14.740
It narrows the range
of possible outcomes.

00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:16.870
But it doesn't add
much to the value

00:44:16.870 --> 00:44:18.430
because they can't reinvest.

00:44:18.430 --> 00:44:19.820
Think about McCormick.

00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:22.990
McCormick owns the
spice market in the US.

00:44:22.990 --> 00:44:24.470
They own most of
the private label

00:44:24.470 --> 00:44:27.010
spices you get from
McCormick, and then they

00:44:27.010 --> 00:44:29.280
have the M-labeled
ones that you see.

00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:30.240
But you know what?

00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:34.260
The consumption of turmeric is
not going up 20% next year, OK?

00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:36.940
Not happen, all right?

00:44:36.940 --> 00:44:39.370
And so McCormick has to
pay out most of the money.

00:44:39.370 --> 00:44:42.120
So that moat is valuable in
creating stability, in creating

00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:43.770
confidence, but
doesn't really say,

00:44:43.770 --> 00:44:45.760
I want to pay 30 times
for this business.

00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:47.700
Because they can't
reinvest it back in.

00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:50.100
Microsoft, Oracle--
very similar things.

00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:54.340
The cash has to come out because
they have no where to put it.

00:44:54.340 --> 00:44:57.520
And another important
takeaway is that moats are not

00:44:57.520 --> 00:45:00.030
limited to these super stable
companies your grandkids can

00:45:00.030 --> 00:45:02.290
own, the Warren
Buffett inevitables.

00:45:02.290 --> 00:45:05.580
Those are a fairly small subset
of the investable universe.

00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:08.100
And as I just mentioned, they
have very limited reinvestment

00:45:08.100 --> 00:45:09.870
opportunities.

00:45:09.870 --> 00:45:12.710
Moat-y businesses that
pay out cash are goods.

00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:15.410
But moat-y businesses that
can reinvest cash back

00:45:15.410 --> 00:45:18.100
into the business are
truly awesome things.

00:45:18.100 --> 00:45:21.120
And when you've confined those
at reasonable valuations,

00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:23.960
it is very likely they'll
make you a lot of money.

00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:26.760
And so when you think
about investing in moats,

00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:30.100
the last takeaway I'll leave you
is that overestimating the moat

00:45:30.100 --> 00:45:31.800
means you'll pay for
value creation that

00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:33.210
never materializes.

00:45:33.210 --> 00:45:36.160
Underestimating the moat means
you have a large opportunity

00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:37.020
cost.

00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:40.540
So let's look at a real
cost example, Motorola, OK?

00:45:40.540 --> 00:45:44.360
This is a chart of
Motorola from '03 to 2012.

00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:46.510
Remember the Razr?

00:45:46.510 --> 00:45:49.140
How many you owned a Razr?

00:45:49.140 --> 00:45:49.930
A fair amount.

00:45:49.930 --> 00:45:53.100
How many of you owned a
Razr three years later?

00:45:53.100 --> 00:45:54.680
And that would be nobody.

00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:57.350
OK, exactly-- so the razor
Razr is released, right?

00:45:57.350 --> 00:45:58.980
And everybody goes bananas.

00:45:58.980 --> 00:46:01.650
And Motorola goes
to 22% market share.

00:46:01.650 --> 00:46:03.840
And the market says,
wow, this is fantastic!

00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:04.590
You've got a moat!

00:46:04.590 --> 00:46:07.410
You've got this
great Razr franchise!

00:46:07.410 --> 00:46:08.997
It's a piece of hardware.

00:46:08.997 --> 00:46:10.330
There's no proprietary software.

00:46:10.330 --> 00:46:11.642
There's no switching cost.

00:46:11.642 --> 00:46:13.350
As soon as the next
cool phone comes out,

00:46:13.350 --> 00:46:15.880
you're gonna go buy that,
which is exactly what happened.

00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:17.620
And so we see what happens.

00:46:17.620 --> 00:46:18.530
Stock craters.

00:46:18.530 --> 00:46:20.100
Motorola has 10% market share.

00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:23.380
People basically overestimated
the value of the moat

00:46:23.380 --> 00:46:25.880
and got hosed on the
stock because of that.

00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:28.350
Hosed is a technical term we
use in the financial industry.

00:46:28.350 --> 00:46:30.110
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:30.110 --> 00:46:33.350
Now, there's an opportunity
cost example in Walmart.

00:46:33.350 --> 00:46:35.570
So this is Walmart
from about '95.

00:46:35.570 --> 00:46:39.800
'97 it went bananas
to '99 through today.

00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:42.640
Buffett-- and this is a story
he told to the Berkshire meeting

00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:47.490
about '04, '06-- they started
to buy several million shares

00:46:47.490 --> 00:46:49.670
of Walmart back in '95.

00:46:49.670 --> 00:46:53.890
And then he said, the
price has moved up by 1/8.

00:46:53.890 --> 00:46:54.650
Let's wait a bit.

00:46:54.650 --> 00:46:56.731
Let's not buy any more.

00:46:56.731 --> 00:46:58.230
And look what
happened to the stock.

00:46:58.230 --> 00:47:01.730
Stock went from 10
to 50, basically.

00:47:01.730 --> 00:47:04.450
That decision-- this is the
number he gave at the meeting.

00:47:04.450 --> 00:47:06.570
He said that what he
called thumb sucking

00:47:06.570 --> 00:47:11.050
on Walmart, basically
not buying enough,

00:47:11.050 --> 00:47:15.440
cost Berkshire $8 billion in
money they could have made.

00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:17.690
And the reason was at that
time he said, eh, Walmart's

00:47:17.690 --> 00:47:18.780
a good retailer.

00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:20.910
He didn't say Walmart
is an awesome retailer

00:47:20.910 --> 00:47:23.160
and so we'll pay up a little
bit for that, the point

00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:26.179
here being that when you find
a truly awesome business,

00:47:26.179 --> 00:47:28.720
don't pay 100 times earnings,
which is what Cisco was trading

00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:31.950
for in 1999, but you pay more.

00:47:31.950 --> 00:47:32.880
It's worth more.

00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:34.780
It's going to compound
at a high rate.

00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:37.016
Because then you suffer
opportunity cost.

00:47:37.016 --> 00:47:39.140
And most investors, I've
found, spend a lot of time

00:47:39.140 --> 00:47:41.710
on margin of safety and not
a lot on opportunity cost.

00:47:41.710 --> 00:47:44.386
And it's something to really
think hard about, I think.

00:47:44.386 --> 00:47:46.827
And people often ask me, isn't
the moat already priced in?

00:47:46.827 --> 00:47:48.910
We already know these are
great businesses, right?

00:47:48.910 --> 00:47:53.450
Well, less often than you
think, because most investors

00:47:53.450 --> 00:47:55.760
own securities for very
short time periods.

00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:59.610
The average US mutual fund
has a turnover of about 100%.

00:47:59.610 --> 00:48:01.400
It's about a one-year
holding period.

00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:02.770
That's the average.

00:48:02.770 --> 00:48:05.220
There's plenty of folks who
three months is a long holding

00:48:05.220 --> 00:48:06.310
period.

00:48:06.310 --> 00:48:08.920
Moats matter in the long
run, not the short run.

00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:11.670
Most investors also assume
the current state of the world

00:48:11.670 --> 00:48:13.567
persists for longer
than it really does.

00:48:13.567 --> 00:48:15.650
And so when things are
tough for a great business,

00:48:15.650 --> 00:48:17.280
they say things will
be tough forever,

00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:20.050
not that this moat will help
the business bounce back.

00:48:20.050 --> 00:48:23.340
And finally, most investors
focus on short-term changes

00:48:23.340 --> 00:48:26.190
in price, not long-term
changes in moats.

00:48:26.190 --> 00:48:29.080
Because finding motes means
finding an efficiency.

00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:32.350
What I've found is that
quantitative data in the market

00:48:32.350 --> 00:48:34.600
tends to be very
efficiently priced.

00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:37.120
Qualitative insight,
understanding

00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:39.260
the structural characteristics
of the business,

00:48:39.260 --> 00:48:40.980
the switching costs,
why the customers

00:48:40.980 --> 00:48:43.620
behave the way they do, why
can this company raise prices

00:48:43.620 --> 00:48:45.550
a little bit every
year-- that tends

00:48:45.550 --> 00:48:47.640
to be less efficiently priced.

00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:50.910
Because, great quote from Bill
Miller, "all of the information

00:48:50.910 --> 00:48:54.780
is in the past, but all of
the value is in the future."

00:48:54.780 --> 00:48:57.320
So the future value
creation will often

00:48:57.320 --> 00:48:59.480
come from things
you can see today,

00:48:59.480 --> 00:49:03.360
not necessarily the information
that occurred in the past.

00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:05.430
And with that, we'll
do more questions.

00:49:05.430 --> 00:49:06.320
Thanks, guys.

00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:08.111
AUDIENCE: The question
is about the process

00:49:08.111 --> 00:49:10.600
you follow once you have
identified the moat companies.

00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:13.020
And once you have
these companies,

00:49:13.020 --> 00:49:16.230
do you try to do an analysis
as to what this company could

00:49:16.230 --> 00:49:19.020
be worth and what cash it can
bring in in 10 years or 15

00:49:19.020 --> 00:49:23.005
years to compare between the
two companies that have not

00:49:23.005 --> 00:49:23.630
have the moats?

00:49:23.630 --> 00:49:26.350
And now once you have
selected a set of companies

00:49:26.350 --> 00:49:29.152
that have a good moat,
what is the next step?

00:49:29.152 --> 00:49:29.860
PAT DORSEY: Sure.

00:49:29.860 --> 00:49:32.400
So that's a good question
about just process in general.

00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:35.257
And I think establishing
that mental database,

00:49:35.257 --> 00:49:37.590
that database of companies
that I would like to own this

00:49:37.590 --> 00:49:40.230
at some price because the
competitive advantages

00:49:40.230 --> 00:49:42.850
and the compounding potential
are things that I think

00:49:42.850 --> 00:49:44.430
are above average or solid.

00:49:47.470 --> 00:49:49.900
I think it's a good
idea to sort of at least

00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:51.590
get kind of a rough idea.

00:49:51.590 --> 00:49:55.770
Like would I want to buy
this at a 5% free cash yield?

00:49:55.770 --> 00:49:57.825
Would I want to buy this
at an 8% free cash yield

00:49:57.825 --> 00:49:59.520
because it's not
growing very much?

00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:01.810
Just something super rough.

00:50:01.810 --> 00:50:03.670
And then you just wait.

00:50:03.670 --> 00:50:05.830
And as it gets closer
to that valuation,

00:50:05.830 --> 00:50:07.420
then you really
ramp up the work,

00:50:07.420 --> 00:50:09.550
then you do the really
hard-core analysis,

00:50:09.550 --> 00:50:11.740
maybe put together a
discounted cash flow and say,

00:50:11.740 --> 00:50:14.244
OK, was my initial idea right?

00:50:14.244 --> 00:50:16.410
But you kind of have to
establish some kind of stake

00:50:16.410 --> 00:50:17.930
in the ground,
some initial idea,

00:50:17.930 --> 00:50:20.430
or you don't know when
to really dig deep.

00:50:20.430 --> 00:50:22.210
And you can't dig
deep on everything

00:50:22.210 --> 00:50:24.660
even if you do this for
a living, which I do.

00:50:24.660 --> 00:50:27.050
AUDIENCE: So a follow-up
question just on that.

00:50:27.050 --> 00:50:28.810
Now, if you are
following that approach,

00:50:28.810 --> 00:50:31.320
once you have identified
the moat companies then

00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:34.480
do some kind of analysis
and get a rough estimate,

00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:36.554
then it doesn't really matter.

00:50:36.554 --> 00:50:38.220
You have two classes
of moat over there.

00:50:38.220 --> 00:50:41.365
One of more that's investing in
itself and one or more that's

00:50:41.365 --> 00:50:42.990
just giving the share
of the money out.

00:50:42.990 --> 00:50:43.720
PAT DORSEY: Yep, yep.

00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:44.710
Good way to segment it.

00:50:44.710 --> 00:50:46.820
AUDIENCE: Then that
distinction doesn't matter

00:50:46.820 --> 00:50:50.160
much if you're doing a formal
analysis where you're coming up

00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:51.852
with these numbers and--

00:50:51.852 --> 00:50:53.310
PAT DORSEY: It only
matters in what

00:50:53.310 --> 00:50:55.226
you would want to pay
for it, probably, right?

00:50:55.226 --> 00:50:57.020
Because a business
like a McCormick,

00:50:57.020 --> 00:51:01.260
for example, you're not going to
pay 30 times earnings for this.

00:51:01.260 --> 00:51:07.320
Because it's never going
to compound at a huge pace.

00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:09.771
A business, whether it's
Google or a company--

00:51:09.771 --> 00:51:11.770
I better put it up there--
is [INAUDIBLE], which

00:51:11.770 --> 00:51:15.100
is doing for-profit
secondary education in South

00:51:15.100 --> 00:51:17.860
Africa, which has a huge
dearth of schools-- insanely

00:51:17.860 --> 00:51:18.377
profitable.

00:51:18.377 --> 00:51:19.960
There you'd pay a
lot, because there's

00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:22.861
this massive runway ahead of it.

00:51:22.861 --> 00:51:24.860
And also I think the thing
to heed, bear in mind

00:51:24.860 --> 00:51:27.186
there is that for the mature
business that's probably

00:51:27.186 --> 00:51:28.560
paying out a lot,
you're probably

00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:30.893
going to make most of your
money on the closing of price

00:51:30.893 --> 00:51:31.790
and value.

00:51:31.790 --> 00:51:35.400
Because intrinsic value is only
growing at a very steady pace,

00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:38.760
whereas for the business
that can reinvest in itself,

00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:40.582
that has that long
runway ahead, you're

00:51:40.582 --> 00:51:42.290
probably going to make
more of your money

00:51:42.290 --> 00:51:45.110
over time on the compounding
of intrinsic value.

00:51:45.110 --> 00:51:46.957
So then a smaller
margin of safety

00:51:46.957 --> 00:51:48.540
makes more sense,
because you're going

00:51:48.540 --> 00:51:50.510
to make all this
money from it growing

00:51:50.510 --> 00:51:53.260
and not in that closing
of price and value.

00:51:53.260 --> 00:51:56.530
And also, like if you were
to wait for, say, Visa to get

00:51:56.530 --> 00:51:59.670
to 10 times earnings,
you'd just never own it.

00:51:59.670 --> 00:52:01.920
And that's the opportunity
cost I was referring to.

00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:04.170
AUDIENCE: If you can give
us a little bit more insight

00:52:04.170 --> 00:52:07.380
in the process that you
guys followed at Morningstar

00:52:07.380 --> 00:52:08.890
and maybe what you follow.

00:52:08.890 --> 00:52:11.220
One of the interesting
things is Morningstar

00:52:11.220 --> 00:52:13.341
has made it really
accessible for us to go

00:52:13.341 --> 00:52:15.590
and figure out what are the
wide-moat businesses, kind

00:52:15.590 --> 00:52:17.720
of reverse engineer
some of these things

00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:19.040
by looking at the analysis.

00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:23.000
But I think the real value is in
going and doing your own work.

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:26.040
I've heard you talk about
following the value chain.

00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:29.800
So maybe if you can just talk
about how do you actually

00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:32.140
go about finding things
that are not well

00:52:32.140 --> 00:52:34.120
recognized even as a wide moat.

00:52:34.120 --> 00:52:36.280
There's a standard list
of things that are widely

00:52:36.280 --> 00:52:38.460
recognized as wide-moat
companies in the US.

00:52:38.460 --> 00:52:40.317
But say you want to
do your own work.

00:52:40.317 --> 00:52:41.400
How would you go about it?

00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:43.032
PAT DORSEY: Great
example-- so I'll

00:52:43.032 --> 00:52:44.900
give you a couple
value chain examples.

00:52:44.900 --> 00:52:49.815
So the Cokes and the
[INAUDIBLE] and the Wrigleys

00:52:49.815 --> 00:52:52.610
and the Nestles-- these are all
pretty good businesses, right?

00:52:52.610 --> 00:52:54.292
So let's think about this.

00:52:54.292 --> 00:52:56.750
They probably have to get their
ingredients from somewhere,

00:52:56.750 --> 00:52:57.602
right?

00:52:57.602 --> 00:52:59.060
Well, there's a
group of companies.

00:52:59.060 --> 00:53:00.326
One is called Givaudan.

00:53:00.326 --> 00:53:02.200
One is called International
Food and Flavors.

00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:04.680
It's the only one in the US.

00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:05.920
One's called Symrise.

00:53:05.920 --> 00:53:09.300
There's one in
Ireland called Kerry.

00:53:09.300 --> 00:53:11.020
They're flavor specialists.

00:53:11.020 --> 00:53:15.835
And when a company wants a
particular characteristic,

00:53:15.835 --> 00:53:17.485
like a particular
kind of mouth feel,

00:53:17.485 --> 00:53:19.632
a particular kind of
flavor, sometimes they'll

00:53:19.632 --> 00:53:20.340
do it themselves.

00:53:20.340 --> 00:53:21.970
Oftentimes they'll turn
to these companies that

00:53:21.970 --> 00:53:23.470
are ingredient
companies, basically.

00:53:23.470 --> 00:53:26.140
And there's about four or
five of them in the world,

00:53:26.140 --> 00:53:27.627
insanely profitable.

00:53:27.627 --> 00:53:29.960
Because of course, once you
have like the component that

00:53:29.960 --> 00:53:32.140
makes Fritos crunch
the way they crunch,

00:53:32.140 --> 00:53:33.600
you're not changing that, right?

00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:34.277
You're done.

00:53:34.277 --> 00:53:35.735
Or another example
would be there's

00:53:35.735 --> 00:53:37.680
a company called Novozymes,
another one called

00:53:37.680 --> 00:53:40.080
Christopher Hanson,
both European.

00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:43.790
They make enzymes, enzymes that
will help your beer stay fresh,

00:53:43.790 --> 00:53:47.630
enzymes that will accelerate the
process of yogurt development,

00:53:47.630 --> 00:53:49.850
again, things that are
massively important

00:53:49.850 --> 00:53:53.450
to the eventual experience
that the customer has,

00:53:53.450 --> 00:53:56.190
but that are pretty tiny
costs to the overall input.

00:53:56.190 --> 00:53:58.960
And that's a value chain thing,
just following that value chain

00:53:58.960 --> 00:54:01.600
back-- aircraft, another thing.

00:54:01.600 --> 00:54:07.510
So we know that airlines kind
of are a stinky industry.

00:54:07.510 --> 00:54:09.810
But they've got to get
the parts from somewhere.

00:54:09.810 --> 00:54:11.990
OK, so then you look
at Boeing and Airbus.

00:54:11.990 --> 00:54:13.250
Those are OK businesses.

00:54:13.250 --> 00:54:14.610
And the reason is very simple.

00:54:14.610 --> 00:54:16.660
People think these should be
awesome businesses, right?

00:54:16.660 --> 00:54:18.470
Because they're huge
and only two companies

00:54:18.470 --> 00:54:19.553
can make airplanes, right?

00:54:19.553 --> 00:54:21.280
And they're wide bodies.

00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:24.500
But at the end of the day, an
airplane is a commodity, right?

00:54:24.500 --> 00:54:27.882
If I'm Emirates or I'm
United, I want the airline

00:54:27.882 --> 00:54:29.840
that gets the most people
the furthest distance

00:54:29.840 --> 00:54:31.370
at the cheapest price.

00:54:31.370 --> 00:54:33.290
I don't care if it's
from Boeing or Airbus.

00:54:33.290 --> 00:54:33.780
You don't care.

00:54:33.780 --> 00:54:35.260
Do any of you care if you
fly a Boeing or an Airbus?

00:54:35.260 --> 00:54:35.968
Who cares, right?

00:54:35.968 --> 00:54:37.790
I mean, I guess the
A380 is kind of cool.

00:54:37.790 --> 00:54:39.370
I've always wanted
to fly on one.

00:54:39.370 --> 00:54:41.453
But I'm not going to pay
some massive premium just

00:54:41.453 --> 00:54:42.740
to fly on it.

00:54:42.740 --> 00:54:44.510
So they're-- eh-- a
commodity business.

00:54:44.510 --> 00:54:46.080
OK, so let's follow
that right back.

00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:49.490
Aircraft-- they got to get
parts from somewhere, right?

00:54:49.490 --> 00:54:50.000
Hm.

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:52.170
Well, the parts tend to be
pretty specialized and highly

00:54:52.170 --> 00:54:52.730
engineered.

00:54:52.730 --> 00:54:54.950
They're customized for
every different air frame.

00:54:54.950 --> 00:54:57.380
The fuel pumps in the 737
are different than the fuel

00:54:57.380 --> 00:55:00.260
pumps in the 757 or the A320.

00:55:00.260 --> 00:55:01.656
And they tend to be sole-source.

00:55:01.656 --> 00:55:04.030
Because they're developed when
the aircraft is developed.

00:55:04.030 --> 00:55:05.700
Boeing and Airbus
are just assemblers.

00:55:05.700 --> 00:55:07.116
That's really all
they're doing is

00:55:07.116 --> 00:55:08.770
assembling for the most part.

00:55:08.770 --> 00:55:10.910
And so then you get these
aftermarket businesses

00:55:10.910 --> 00:55:12.530
that are sole-source.

00:55:12.530 --> 00:55:14.520
And as long as that
airplane is flying,

00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:17.400
you've got one guy you
can get the part from.

00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:20.100
And he is going to
have you over a barrel,

00:55:20.100 --> 00:55:21.712
charge you whatever he wants.

00:55:21.712 --> 00:55:23.795
And so that's another kind
of value chain example.

00:55:26.037 --> 00:55:28.120
You almost just do a map,
like look at the company

00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:30.236
and say, OK, these
guys, they got

00:55:30.236 --> 00:55:31.610
to get this input
from somewhere,

00:55:31.610 --> 00:55:34.280
this input from somewhere,
this input from somewhere.

00:55:34.280 --> 00:55:35.660
Where's the money made?

00:55:35.660 --> 00:55:38.855
I mean, every industry,
you just do a value map.

00:55:38.855 --> 00:55:41.790
And sometimes there's almost
nowhere-- I mean, auto parts.

00:55:41.790 --> 00:55:43.260
Eh.

00:55:43.260 --> 00:55:45.320
Almost no one makes
money in this industry.

00:55:45.320 --> 00:55:47.029
Except Johnson Controls
does pretty well,

00:55:47.029 --> 00:55:49.069
because they'll do like
a whole interior and just

00:55:49.069 --> 00:55:50.070
kind of slot it in.

00:55:50.070 --> 00:55:51.660
Or there's a company
called Gentext

00:55:51.660 --> 00:55:53.630
that does auto dimming
and rear view mirrors.

00:55:53.630 --> 00:55:54.780
And they have some
patents on that

00:55:54.780 --> 00:55:55.800
that make it pretty profitable.

00:55:55.800 --> 00:55:57.466
But those are just a
couple of examples.

00:55:57.466 --> 00:55:59.300
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:55:59.300 --> 00:56:02.740
PAT DORSEY: Auto retailing
is not a bad business.

00:56:02.740 --> 00:56:04.530
AUDIENCE: I mean
auto part retailers.

00:56:04.530 --> 00:56:06.071
PAT DORSEY: Oh, auto
part retailers--

00:56:06.071 --> 00:56:07.490
yeah, yeah, AutoZone.

00:56:07.490 --> 00:56:10.560
And again, you go back, and
the reason is pretty simple.

00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:14.700
Because if you're the
mechanic, the cost of that part

00:56:14.700 --> 00:56:16.060
is passed through.

00:56:16.060 --> 00:56:18.030
If you take your car
in to get repaired,

00:56:18.030 --> 00:56:19.405
you're not shopping
for the part.

00:56:19.405 --> 00:56:20.988
The mechanic is
shopping for the part.

00:56:20.988 --> 00:56:22.760
He just passes through
the cost to you.

00:56:22.760 --> 00:56:26.539
So there's a margin made on it.

00:56:26.539 --> 00:56:28.080
You don't know what
a fan belt costs.

00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:29.746
Maybe you do know
what a fan belt costs.

00:56:29.746 --> 00:56:30.380
I don't know.

00:56:30.380 --> 00:56:33.650
But I barely know
what a carburetor is,

00:56:33.650 --> 00:56:35.370
much less could I
price the darn thing.

00:56:35.370 --> 00:56:37.570
So again, you have
this disconnect

00:56:37.570 --> 00:56:39.129
between the payer and the buyer.

00:56:39.129 --> 00:56:41.670
AUDIENCE: So you talked about
the valuation in the last part.

00:56:41.670 --> 00:56:43.720
And there are a
couple of questions.

00:56:43.720 --> 00:56:48.222
When it's an emerging
moat, it looks

00:56:48.222 --> 00:56:50.430
like some of those signs of
emerging moats are there,

00:56:50.430 --> 00:56:53.590
often the return
ratios are poor.

00:56:53.590 --> 00:56:56.090
The valuation is
optically seemed higher.

00:56:56.090 --> 00:56:58.560
Because the company has not
started shelling cash out.

00:56:58.560 --> 00:57:01.270
How would you value a
business in that state

00:57:01.270 --> 00:57:02.746
or value a moat in that state?

00:57:02.746 --> 00:57:04.370
PAT DORSEY: Yeah,
sure, great question.

00:57:04.370 --> 00:57:07.900
So that's where a discounted
cash flow analysis really

00:57:07.900 --> 00:57:08.980
becomes useful.

00:57:08.980 --> 00:57:12.270
And it's not that DCF is a
magic bullet and it's better.

00:57:12.270 --> 00:57:15.200
It just forces you to think
through the cash economics

00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:18.150
of the business over
the long run as opposed

00:57:18.150 --> 00:57:20.290
to the gap counting
characteristics

00:57:20.290 --> 00:57:22.830
of the short run, which
is what a PE will do.

00:57:22.830 --> 00:57:25.480
So in the case of a business
that, say, is growing quickly,

00:57:25.480 --> 00:57:28.780
returns are poor today but it
looks like there's something

00:57:28.780 --> 00:57:30.290
there, it looks
like there could be

00:57:30.290 --> 00:57:33.620
a moat, what I
would say is this.

00:57:33.620 --> 00:57:35.780
Think about three
things-- opportunity

00:57:35.780 --> 00:57:39.780
set, fixed and
variable costs, OK?

00:57:39.780 --> 00:57:42.270
So what is the opportunity
set here, right?

00:57:42.270 --> 00:57:43.920
How big could this thing get?

00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:46.270
What could they sell to
people in three year's

00:57:46.270 --> 00:57:48.380
time, five years'
time, whatever?

00:57:48.380 --> 00:57:50.720
And then say, OK,
to get there, they

00:57:50.720 --> 00:57:52.956
will need to invest
something, right?

00:57:52.956 --> 00:57:54.080
There's some number amount.

00:57:54.080 --> 00:57:56.290
They'll need to build new
plants, hire new engineers,

00:57:56.290 --> 00:57:57.390
whatever it might be.

00:57:57.390 --> 00:57:59.300
And then there will be
a flow-through, too.

00:57:59.300 --> 00:58:01.530
Some amount will drop
to the bottom line.

00:58:01.530 --> 00:58:04.800
And over time, more should
drop to the bottom line

00:58:04.800 --> 00:58:06.440
if it's a decent
business, right?

00:58:06.440 --> 00:58:08.480
Who knows if it is.

00:58:08.480 --> 00:58:11.750
And you just kind of math
that out, just DCF it out.

00:58:11.750 --> 00:58:14.650
And then say, OK,
this company could

00:58:14.650 --> 00:58:17.540
go from a 6% percent
return on capital

00:58:17.540 --> 00:58:20.360
to a 12% return on
capital in five years

00:58:20.360 --> 00:58:22.500
and start generating
free cash flow.

00:58:22.500 --> 00:58:24.250
And then we get a
hockey stick after that,

00:58:24.250 --> 00:58:25.490
as you kind of do it out.

00:58:25.490 --> 00:58:27.990
So for example, we're looking
at a business right now called

00:58:27.990 --> 00:58:32.110
SimCorp, which
does basically very

00:58:32.110 --> 00:58:35.540
expensive back-end software
for huge asset managers,

00:58:35.540 --> 00:58:38.250
like $100 billion
plus asset managers,

00:58:38.250 --> 00:58:40.530
runs the whole
back-end office suite.

00:58:40.530 --> 00:58:44.110
Now, basically they've
been growing about 5%,

00:58:44.110 --> 00:58:45.704
6% per year for
the past few years.

00:58:45.704 --> 00:58:47.620
Because they've not done
well in the US market

00:58:47.620 --> 00:58:49.760
for a bunch of reasons that
we think may be fixable.

00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:51.384
That's what we're
trying to figure out.

00:58:51.384 --> 00:58:53.120
But basically we've
talked to them,

00:58:53.120 --> 00:58:54.790
and that 5%, 6%
growth pretty much

00:58:54.790 --> 00:58:57.215
covers their cost
structure now and gets them

00:58:57.215 --> 00:58:59.010
about a low 20s margin.

00:58:59.010 --> 00:59:02.890
But every bit of incremental
growth over that,

00:59:02.890 --> 00:59:07.660
so going from 5% to 10%, you
get an 80% to 90% drop-through.

00:59:07.660 --> 00:59:10.080
And then that, then,
takes your margins

00:59:10.080 --> 00:59:12.402
from probably low 20s up a lot.

00:59:12.402 --> 00:59:13.860
But you don't know
what that number

00:59:13.860 --> 00:59:16.630
is until you think it through.

00:59:16.630 --> 00:59:18.900
Another example-- so when
Morningstar initiated

00:59:18.900 --> 00:59:24.430
on MasterCard, when it went
public at $40, $50 a share,

00:59:24.430 --> 00:59:27.360
I remember our analyst
wanted to put like $100, $110

00:59:27.360 --> 00:59:28.235
price target on it.

00:59:28.235 --> 00:59:30.160
And I was like, dude,
you're nuts, man.

00:59:30.160 --> 00:59:32.490
This thing is coming
public at like $40.

00:59:32.490 --> 00:59:34.490
We're not going to stick
our necks out that far.

00:59:34.490 --> 00:59:36.010
Come on.

00:59:36.010 --> 00:59:37.620
How good a business is this?

00:59:37.620 --> 00:59:39.050
And what he did
is he just walked

00:59:39.050 --> 00:59:41.170
through fixed versus
variable, that basically,

00:59:41.170 --> 00:59:43.900
OK, very little variable
costs in this business.

00:59:43.900 --> 00:59:46.800
You've got a fixed cost of a
network, the data processing

00:59:46.800 --> 00:59:47.840
network.

00:59:47.840 --> 00:59:50.850
But then of the
incremental revenue,

00:59:50.850 --> 00:59:53.180
tons will flow down
to the bottom line.

00:59:53.180 --> 00:59:57.430
And this is where-- and this
is a geek thing-- when you're

00:59:57.430 --> 00:59:59.290
modeling out a
high-growth company,

00:59:59.290 --> 01:00:00.690
don't model in percentages.

01:00:00.690 --> 01:00:02.330
Model in dollars.

01:00:02.330 --> 01:00:04.070
So it optically
looks weird to say,

01:00:04.070 --> 01:00:06.380
margins are going to
go from 13% to 25%.

01:00:06.380 --> 01:00:07.680
Ah!

01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:08.290
This is huge.

01:00:08.290 --> 01:00:10.570
My God, that's never
going to happen.

01:00:10.570 --> 01:00:12.070
So don't do it in percentages.

01:00:12.070 --> 01:00:14.590
Don't do operating
margins doing from x to y.

01:00:14.590 --> 01:00:17.440
Think about, OK,
fixed versus variable.

01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:20.470
How many dollars will
they need to spend

01:00:20.470 --> 01:00:23.820
to get each dollar of
additional revenue?

01:00:23.820 --> 01:00:27.040
And then see what operating
margin falls out of that.

01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:29.744
And you may come to a
very different conclusion.

01:00:29.744 --> 01:00:31.910
AUDIENCE: Is that like
operating leverage that you--

01:00:31.910 --> 01:00:33.190
PAT DORSEY: Yeah, it's
operating leverage.

01:00:33.190 --> 01:00:35.090
And I have found that operating
leverage is frequently

01:00:35.090 --> 01:00:37.170
one of the most mispriced
things in the market

01:00:37.170 --> 01:00:40.420
because nobody wants to like
hand their boss the portfolio

01:00:40.420 --> 01:00:42.400
manager or the
director of research

01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:44.859
a model that shows something
going from 13% to 30% margins.

01:00:44.859 --> 01:00:47.483
Because they're going to get it
back, and they're going to say,

01:00:47.483 --> 01:00:48.340
you're nuts, man.

01:00:48.340 --> 01:00:48.970
There's no way.

01:00:48.970 --> 01:00:50.094
Forget about it, like, nah.

01:00:54.110 --> 01:00:55.280
But it can happen.

01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:57.550
It happened with C&amp;E. It
happened with MasterCard.

01:00:57.550 --> 01:00:58.633
It's happened with Google.

01:00:58.633 --> 01:01:00.440
It happened with OpenTable.

01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:02.690
When you get these
network effect businesses

01:01:02.690 --> 01:01:05.517
with very high
incremental returns

01:01:05.517 --> 01:01:07.350
because you get this
high flow-through ratio

01:01:07.350 --> 01:01:09.630
of additional revenue
dollars, margins

01:01:09.630 --> 01:01:11.670
can do some pretty
interesting things.

01:01:11.670 --> 01:01:14.300
But you'll only figure that
out if you model in dollars.

01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:15.830
You've got to just
think about that.

01:01:15.830 --> 01:01:19.380
What do I need to spend for each
additional dollar in revenue?

01:01:19.380 --> 01:01:22.640
AUDIENCE: So for network
effect, you read anything

01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:25.822
about like eBay or Alibaba,
but those kind of networks

01:01:25.822 --> 01:01:27.780
seems like they're
[INAUDIBLE] digital network.

01:01:27.780 --> 01:01:29.488
You're talking about
it's radial network,

01:01:29.488 --> 01:01:32.490
not something like Facebook.

01:01:32.490 --> 01:01:34.830
So it appears the only
seller is the buyer.

01:01:34.830 --> 01:01:37.476
It's not like buyers sell
stuff to another buyer and all

01:01:37.476 --> 01:01:37.977
this stuff.

01:01:37.977 --> 01:01:40.100
PAT DORSEY: Oh, OK, that's
a really interesting way

01:01:40.100 --> 01:01:41.010
to think about it.

01:01:41.010 --> 01:01:42.220
OK, I see what you're saying.

01:01:42.220 --> 01:01:42.761
You're right.

01:01:42.761 --> 01:01:44.200
It is just seller to buyer.

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:47.310
But the more buyers
who are there,

01:01:47.310 --> 01:01:49.880
the more sellers are going to
want to be on the platform,

01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:50.380
right?

01:01:50.380 --> 01:01:52.130
It's not as if it's
just selling one good.

01:01:52.130 --> 01:01:58.150
Like let's imagine that eBay
could only sell baseball cards.

01:01:58.150 --> 01:02:00.077
I don't know, whatever.

01:02:00.077 --> 01:02:01.660
Then you could have
someone say, OK, I

01:02:01.660 --> 01:02:03.330
could pick that market off.

01:02:03.330 --> 01:02:07.120
I could invent a better platform
for selling baseball cards.

01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:09.930
Whereas if you know
that whatever I want,

01:02:09.930 --> 01:02:11.430
I'm probably going
to find it there,

01:02:11.430 --> 01:02:14.160
and whatever I want to sell,
I'm going to find it there,

01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:16.130
that creates all
those connections.

01:02:16.130 --> 01:02:21.310
But I kind of see-- I had never
thought about you could mistake

01:02:21.310 --> 01:02:22.720
that for being a radial network.

01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:25.000
I wouldn't characterize
it that way.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:28.720
Because any buyer can
interact with-- that's

01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:29.900
the best way to describe it.

01:02:29.900 --> 01:02:35.250
Any buyer on eBay can interact
with any seller, right?

01:02:35.250 --> 01:02:38.200
And depending on what
they want to buy or sell,

01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:39.940
that transaction could occur.

01:02:39.940 --> 01:02:43.770
Whereas although I can
send money from Bangladesh

01:02:43.770 --> 01:02:48.380
to Mexico City, to go
back to that example,

01:02:48.380 --> 01:02:49.690
there's no reason to, right?

01:02:49.690 --> 01:02:51.830
I mean, you don't have
people immigrating.

01:02:51.830 --> 01:02:54.900
And immigrants are one of the
biggest users of Western Union

01:02:54.900 --> 01:02:58.690
network to send money back
home, remittances, right?

01:02:58.690 --> 01:03:01.430
You just don't have people
who move from Mexico City

01:03:01.430 --> 01:03:02.952
to Bangladesh or vice versa.

01:03:02.952 --> 01:03:05.160
There may be a huge Mexican
population in Bangladesh.

01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:05.830
I don't know.

01:03:05.830 --> 01:03:06.788
I don't think there is.

01:03:06.788 --> 01:03:08.260
[LAUGHTER]

01:03:08.260 --> 01:03:10.670
But that was a cool way
of thinking about it.

01:03:10.670 --> 01:03:11.217
Yeah.

01:03:11.217 --> 01:03:12.050
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:03:12.050 --> 01:03:14.010
So I have one question, Pat.

01:03:14.010 --> 01:03:17.440
I'm always very curious about
when, just from a learning

01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:22.440
perspective, what would
you say, looking back

01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:26.910
10 years, what have been some
of your prominent mistakes

01:03:26.910 --> 01:03:29.150
and sort of what you've
learned from them?

01:03:29.150 --> 01:03:30.316
PAT DORSEY: Yeah, thank you.

01:03:30.316 --> 01:03:31.100
That's a good one.

01:03:31.100 --> 01:03:34.130
Thank you for forcing me to air
my dirty laundry, [INAUDIBLE].

01:03:34.130 --> 01:03:34.880
I appreciate that.

01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:35.010
[LAUGHTER]

01:03:35.010 --> 01:03:35.850
AUDIENCE: It will go on YouTube.

01:03:35.850 --> 01:03:36.125
PAT DORSEY: No, no, it's OK.

01:03:36.125 --> 01:03:37.350
It's OK.

01:03:37.350 --> 01:03:38.281
Yes, hello, YouTube.

01:03:38.281 --> 01:03:38.780
How are you?

01:03:38.780 --> 01:03:40.610
[LAUGHTER]

01:03:40.610 --> 01:03:41.614
No, seriously.

01:03:41.614 --> 01:03:43.280
No, actually, it's a
very good question.

01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:47.830
And I would say that I've
gotten that operating leverage

01:03:47.830 --> 01:03:49.460
thing right a couple of times.

01:03:49.460 --> 01:03:52.140
I've missed it more
times than I should have.

01:03:52.140 --> 01:03:56.450
So that's one that annoys
me when I think about it,

01:03:56.450 --> 01:03:59.930
is that thinking carefully about
operating leverage, thinking

01:03:59.930 --> 01:04:03.280
carefully about network
effects and runways,

01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:06.130
I've done OK at that, but
not as well as I should have.

01:04:06.130 --> 01:04:09.350
There's some pitches I missed
that would have been home runs,

01:04:09.350 --> 01:04:11.250
I think.

01:04:11.250 --> 01:04:13.280
The bigger one, though,
is probably management.

01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:22.960
Definitely as I've done more
work on businesses that are not

01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:25.160
making caps, that are
smaller-- because management

01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:27.270
can have a bigger effect
on a smaller business.

01:04:27.270 --> 01:04:33.610
It's just easier to drive a
sports car versus a Mack truck.

01:04:33.610 --> 01:04:35.440
And as I've done
more work on what

01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:38.890
I would call capital allocator
business models like Brookfield

01:04:38.890 --> 01:04:42.110
Asset Management or
Onyx in Toronto or Roper

01:04:42.110 --> 01:04:46.350
or PSG in South
Africa, which we own,

01:04:46.350 --> 01:04:48.930
I've gained a much
greater appreciation

01:04:48.930 --> 01:04:53.030
for what the truly
exceptional managers can do.

01:04:53.030 --> 01:04:58.590
And I think as I reflect
on it, I think some of this

01:04:58.590 --> 01:05:03.780
came from kind of a reaction
to the kind of 1990s hero CEO

01:05:03.780 --> 01:05:07.330
thing, where John
Chambers was God,

01:05:07.330 --> 01:05:11.110
Howard Schultz of Starbucks
was God, and this sort

01:05:11.110 --> 01:05:13.520
of cult of the hero CEO
that we've developed,

01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:17.700
especially in the US, where
pretty much every CEO in the US

01:05:17.700 --> 01:05:21.530
is vastly overpaid for
the value they deliver.

01:05:21.530 --> 01:05:25.790
And option expensing, you
remember, was a huge battle.

01:05:25.790 --> 01:05:27.374
And so I think some
of that management

01:05:27.374 --> 01:05:28.331
doesn't matter as much.

01:05:28.331 --> 01:05:30.920
Some of it was probably just
a kind of a knee-jerk reaction

01:05:30.920 --> 01:05:33.700
to a lot of that, it's
probably fair to say.

01:05:33.700 --> 01:05:38.627
But with time, hopefully the
knee is not jerking as much.

01:05:38.627 --> 01:05:41.210
And I guess I've just developed
a better appreciation for what

01:05:41.210 --> 01:05:43.950
the truly exceptional
manager can do.

01:05:43.950 --> 01:05:46.517
And again, I do want to
emphasize truly exceptional.

01:05:46.517 --> 01:05:48.350
And you're not truly
exceptional because you

01:05:48.350 --> 01:05:50.174
were on the cover of
"Forbes" or "Fortune."

01:05:50.174 --> 01:05:52.590
You are not truly exceptional
because you have a giant pay

01:05:52.590 --> 01:05:53.520
package.

01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:55.500
You are truly
exceptional because you

01:05:55.500 --> 01:05:57.000
are passionate
about your business

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.452
and you understand how
to allocate capital.

01:05:59.452 --> 01:06:01.160
That's what makes an
exceptional manager.

01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:02.910
But I would say
that's something I

01:06:02.910 --> 01:06:05.310
wish I had appreciated
earlier in my investing career

01:06:05.310 --> 01:06:07.680
but something we're working
hard to correct right now.

01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:12.230
I mean, in our current
portfolio of 14 companies,

01:06:12.230 --> 01:06:16.682
five are what I would call
this capital allocator model.

01:06:16.682 --> 01:06:17.390
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

01:06:17.390 --> 01:06:20.680
Actually, that brought
to mind one of the books,

01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:21.860
"The Outsiders."

01:06:21.860 --> 01:06:23.110
PAT DORSEY: Yeah, great book.

01:06:23.110 --> 01:06:24.370
AUDIENCE: Yeah, about
capital allocatin.

01:06:24.370 --> 01:06:24.950
PAT DORSEY: Yeah.

01:06:24.950 --> 01:06:26.130
"Outsiders" is a great book.

01:06:26.130 --> 01:06:26.740
If you haven't read
"The Outsiders,"

01:06:26.740 --> 01:06:28.198
it's an awesome
book on management.

01:06:28.198 --> 01:06:30.830
Will Thorndike wrote it.

01:06:30.830 --> 01:06:33.500
Yeah, definitely that
would be in the top 10

01:06:33.500 --> 01:06:34.740
the past coupld of years.

01:06:34.740 --> 01:06:37.830
AUDIENCE: So while we're
talking about emerging moats

01:06:37.830 --> 01:06:39.780
and like good
capital allocators,

01:06:39.780 --> 01:06:43.700
one example that you
brought up is Danaher.

01:06:43.700 --> 01:06:47.360
The Rales brothers,
they have Colfax,

01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:49.130
which right now is in
the news quite a bit

01:06:49.130 --> 01:06:51.870
because they sell to
oil and gas quite a bit.

01:06:51.870 --> 01:06:55.240
And this is one of kind
of an emerging moat, where

01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:58.140
we don't really see
it in the numbers yet.

01:06:58.140 --> 01:06:59.640
Would you have any
thoughts that you

01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:00.900
would like to share with us?

01:07:00.900 --> 01:07:02.399
PAT DORSEY: Yeah,
well, one is don't

01:07:02.399 --> 01:07:04.000
bet against the Rales brothers.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:07.240
That that's a low-odds bet.

01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:08.720
No, Colfax is
getting interesting.

01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:10.210
We need to ramp
up our work on it

01:07:10.210 --> 01:07:13.450
right now, because we sort of
have a list of great businesses

01:07:13.450 --> 01:07:15.450
that sell into oil and
gas that are kind of just

01:07:15.450 --> 01:07:16.400
gotten whacked lately.

01:07:19.070 --> 01:07:21.380
I have not followed
Colfax too closely.

01:07:21.380 --> 01:07:25.900
I mean, we owned it after
the charter acquisition

01:07:25.900 --> 01:07:28.040
when they basically
bought a company three,

01:07:28.040 --> 01:07:31.150
four times their size and
created enormous value almost

01:07:31.150 --> 01:07:35.380
overnight with what they
did with that business.

01:07:35.380 --> 01:07:38.100
I think I would say the
Rales are amazing managers,

01:07:38.100 --> 01:07:43.710
and it's very fertile ground
for more research and more work.

01:07:43.710 --> 01:07:49.550
What I would say, the
Colfax model currently

01:07:49.550 --> 01:07:54.940
is buy solid businesses and
make them better businesses

01:07:54.940 --> 01:07:56.670
via lean manufacturing
techniques,

01:07:56.670 --> 01:08:01.090
for the most part, the
Colfax business system.

01:08:01.090 --> 01:08:04.880
It's different than, say, like a
Roper or a PSG, both businesses

01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:08.860
we do own, which tend to own
great businesses that they want

01:08:08.860 --> 01:08:13.280
to make even better via
additional investment

01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:15.920
or better capital allocation.

01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:18.876
But the Rales brothers are
tough ones to bet against.

01:08:18.876 --> 01:08:20.334
AUDIENCE: The hard
part is when you

01:08:20.334 --> 01:08:26.260
are kind of watching it as it as
its stands as a snapshot today.

01:08:26.260 --> 01:08:28.710
Do these underlying
businesses really

01:08:28.710 --> 01:08:30.910
have any kind of moat or not?

01:08:30.910 --> 01:08:34.711
And since there's no
numerical evidence, it's hard.

01:08:34.711 --> 01:08:36.960
How do you actually go out
and do independent research

01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:39.880
and say, yes, these businesses
actually have a moat

01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:41.430
now that they are in the Colfax.

01:08:41.430 --> 01:08:42.740
PAT DORSEY: Yeah, so there's a
couple things to look at there.

01:08:42.740 --> 01:08:45.990
One is looking carefully at
the end markets there, I think.

01:08:45.990 --> 01:08:48.740
Because you're looking for
what the numbers could become,

01:08:48.740 --> 01:08:49.891
not what they are today.

01:08:49.891 --> 01:08:52.390
And so there, you want to almost
get in the customer's head,

01:08:52.390 --> 01:08:52.890
right?

01:08:52.890 --> 01:08:55.810
And say, why does a customer
buy a pump from Dahaner?

01:08:55.810 --> 01:08:59.399
What does it by a
fan from Howden?

01:08:59.399 --> 01:09:03.069
Why does it buy welding
equipment from ESAB?

01:09:03.069 --> 01:09:04.620
And then get in
the customer's head

01:09:04.620 --> 01:09:06.450
and then see what
their behavior is.

01:09:06.450 --> 01:09:07.991
And maybe there's
reasons why they're

01:09:07.991 --> 01:09:09.240
sticking-- I don't know.

01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:11.340
That would be a way to
kind of go down that path.

01:09:11.340 --> 01:09:13.229
But then also, and
this kind of goes back

01:09:13.229 --> 01:09:16.750
to the one slide about the
truly amazing managers,

01:09:16.750 --> 01:09:21.109
operational excellence can
become strategic advantage

01:09:21.109 --> 01:09:22.130
rarely.

01:09:22.130 --> 01:09:25.500
But in the hands of like an
ITW would be a good example,

01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:30.160
in the hands of a truly
four-standard-deviation

01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:35.180
manager, operational excellence,
the Danaher business system

01:09:35.180 --> 01:09:38.380
back at Danaher, can
become strategic advantage.

01:09:38.380 --> 01:09:43.020
Because you just do everything
so much more efficiently

01:09:43.020 --> 01:09:44.390
than everybody else.

01:09:44.390 --> 01:09:48.569
You manage to eke out an
economic moat out of that.

01:09:48.569 --> 01:09:51.366
Not common, not
something I would

01:09:51.366 --> 01:09:52.990
try to have a whole
portfolio of those,

01:09:52.990 --> 01:09:54.531
because they're
pretty tough to find.

01:09:54.531 --> 01:09:57.530
But I would say that the track
record of the Rales brothers

01:09:57.530 --> 01:10:02.980
is good enough that if anyone
can turn operational excellence

01:10:02.980 --> 01:10:04.730
into strategic
advantage, it would

01:10:04.730 --> 01:10:06.009
be on the pretty short list.

01:10:06.009 --> 01:10:07.550
MALE SPEAKER: All
right, thanks, Pat.

01:10:07.550 --> 01:10:09.650
With that, thank you very much
for such an enlightening talk.

01:10:09.650 --> 01:10:10.440
PAT DORSEY: Thanks, Surat.

01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:11.080
This has been fun.

01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:11.746
Awesome, thanks.

01:10:11.746 --> 01:10:12.920
[APPLAUSE]

01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:14.153
This has been fun.
