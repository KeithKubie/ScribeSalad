00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:04.040
Raptor training? That sounds interesting.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.080
Hey it's me Destin. I'm at Auburn University today at the South eastern Raptor

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.260
Centre with Andrew, and Andrew's a pretty unique guy. What do you do, Andrew?

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.440
-I get to work with birds every day.
Every single day.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.630
So today we have a red tailed hawk, and, what's his name? -Petey
Alright,

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.820
Petey is going to hit a target and we're gonna capture it in high speed video and we're gonna show you how

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.970
a bird can control his whole wing. It's kind of like, you know an airplane

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:37.130
controls just a control surface, one particular area of the wing. Birds can

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.310
control the whole wing, individually. So each individual feather is moving.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.350
So we're gonna try to capture that on high speed. Do you think he'll hit the target?
-Oh yeah. Every time.

00:00:45.370 --> 00:01:01.780
   

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.960
Alright, so we're gonna see if we can get the maneuver right when, this is Nadira?

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.140
-Yeah
Right when Nadira tries to stop. Now the interesting thing about these birds

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.160
is, they're like this huge optical processor and so, the

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.350
vision gives so much stimulation that they have to shield them so that they can't see. Am I saying everything

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:22.520
correct? Andrew, Sean, everything correct here?
Alright, so what we're gonna do is we have a

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.700
wide angle lens setup with this high speed camera. This is a Phantom V10

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.810
What we're gonna do is, the bird's gonna fly in here and get this piece of meat

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.930
and if you look at the lens it's got a big, a big bulbous on the outside there. That's a

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.100
special type of lens so we can get this exact point of impact, so

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.280
let's see what happens.
-Nadira. hup!

00:01:43.300 --> 00:02:05.200
    

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.890
OK so the bird has to wear a leather hood over her eyes

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:12.060
because she's so stimulated visually that she gets irritated if she doesn't. It's

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.210
like this. You and I are probably trichromats, which means we have cones in our eyes

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.360
to detect red, green and blue light. Now when we look at this rainbow

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.540
cat that my daughter made for me all the rest of the colours are a combination of these types of light.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.690
Birds are not that way. Birds are tetrachromats, or

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.770
even pintachromats, which means they have over two-thirds the amount of colour information

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.850
that they have to process that we don't. This makes sense because birds are most often

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.930
the most colourful species on the planet. If you think about it, there might be a UV

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.020
component of light that they're seeing that we're not. So this cardinal might not be red

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.200
but might be red, and a little, more UV or

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.240
less UV. There's something else that birds have to deal with and it's called a high flicker fusion rate.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.280
You and I can detect a flickering light up to about 18 hertz and beyond

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.420
that it looks like a smooth image. And that's why 25 or 30 frames per second on

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.560
video works well for us. But for birds they have a much higher flicker fusion rate.

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.720
In fact, if you throw in a UV component of light, their higher

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.890
flicker fusion rate is about 100 hertz, which is pretty amazing.

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.980
So if you think about it, you and I are calibrated so that we can go through

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.070
a world walking and running. Well, birds are flying, that's why they need

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.170
the higher flicker fusion rate, because if they're going through the woods they have to be able to see a branch coming

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.270
and make an adjustment on the fly. That makes watching this video much more enjoyable

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.300
because it's high speed footage which means it's simulating a flicker fusion

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.350
rate much higher than you or I are used to. It's like we're seeing the world through the eyes of the

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.380
bird. So if you look here as this bird tries to grab this target and she misses,

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.520
she sees with her high flicker fusion rate and tries to make an aerodynamic

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.670
correction, on the fly, to try to grab the target. And I think that is

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.150
very cool.
-Nadira. hup.

00:03:53.170 --> 00:04:21.580
     

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.490
-Percy!

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:52.160
      

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.330
It feels great to know that we're making people Smarter Every Day.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.360
Alright, so a big

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:04.390
thank you to Andrew. Andrew spent a lot of time helping me coordinate this, so

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:08.410
-It was a lot of fun. Thank you Destin
Thank you very much, and we hope to see you again

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.440
do this again. -Yeah, raptor centre hopes to see you guys again.
Appreciate it man.

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.590
I'm ready. - Welcome to the South eastern Raptor Centre.

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:20.770
[laugh]

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:24.930
[bird sounds]

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:33.240
 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:37.370
-Ten pounds, twelve pounds of air they have to push, so when they flap their

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:41.510
wings, it's, well it's cooling.

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:45.540
-So this is what they kill with.

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.580
-That is what they kill with
So the hallux is what does the piercing.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.630
-Well all their feet does, but that's the biggest, the biggest and the longest.
