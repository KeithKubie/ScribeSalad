MIN-MIN LIANG:
What's the difference

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:12.060
between streamlined courses
and regular Chinese courses?

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:13.630
I think in the
beginning they said

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:15.580
that streamlined is obvious.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.730
It's to make it faster.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.900
So it turned out to be--
it just happened this way.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.320
And when I start teaching
here, it's already established.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.330
So most students
taking streamlined,

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.080
they're heritage learners.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.850
You don't have to be a
heritage learner at all as long

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.370
as your oral proficiency
reaches a certain level.

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.490
So that means we
don't start a class

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:44.830
with how to pronounce the
words, because we assume you

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:48.040
have basic conversation skills.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.190
So versus regular
class, you start out

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.110
with all the language courses.

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.110
You start with pronunciations.

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.360
You start with the alphabet,
that we call the [INAUDIBLE],

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.610
how to pronounce words.

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.460
And then you
introduce everything,

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.040
just like from the start.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.500
So for streamlined courses, we
assume you have the oral skills

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.360
already at a certain level.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.530
So that makes it very different.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.850
And, I think, we're very
fortunate to have this program

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.870
here, because we've
got enough student

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:22.930
group to attend this course.

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.590
So my goal for this course
is literacy building.

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.340
And this is the main component.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:36.700
And the second thing is to help
them too elevate their speaking

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:37.530
proficiency.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.830
So I assume by
[INAUDIBLE] standard,

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.540
when they exit this
course, they could at least

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.160
reach the intermediate
high to advanced low level

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.810
in terms of speaking.

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.230
So they came in there
usually at intermediate low.

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.110
Even if you think
intermediate low,

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.940
intermediate high is
not much, but when

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.510
you try to push it
to that direction,

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.530
it's harder and harder,
because they get withdrawn

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.090
into their own little world.

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.820
They refuse to use
new vocabulary.

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.350
They will just speak
in their comfort zone.

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.640
So we need to push them.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.090
It's really hard.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.600
So that's my goal to
aim at the discourse.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.080
And the literacy, as I
said it, some of them

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.390
took Chinese class when they
were at elementary school,

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.270
some even in high school.

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:37.380
A lot of these kids they
to so-called Sunday school

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.910
once a week.

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.610
So some of them do have some
foundation to have Chinese

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.150
characters, but
sound really don't.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.410
So how do I start?

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.590
I make sure everybody
learns same amount

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.000
of characters in the beginning.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.520
The first month, we call
it just pure memorization.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.840
It's nothing, nothing tricky.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.740
I hate to say there's
just the effort you

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.430
need to memorize
characters, because that's

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:08.820
how you learn to read.

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:13.050
There's no way-- other
shortcut Let's put it this way.

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.200
It's because Chinese
characters are not spelling.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.557
It's like pictures.

00:03:18.557 --> 00:03:19.640
You have to memorize them.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.190
There are rules in there.

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.690
So after four weeks, people
really struggle, for those

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.470
who've never done it before.

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.540
Because basically,
every class, I

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.460
force them-- three hours
a week, every class,

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.050
we have quiz, dictation.

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.160
So before the class,
they have to memorize

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.370
50 characters at least.

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.170
Well, as I said, we're unique.

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.750
We're fortunate
they're MIT students.

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.110
They're so useful, hard-working.

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.720
They complain, but
they did it anyway.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:59.270
So after one month, everybody,
at least, has 250 characters.

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:03.680
Some do have more, because
they learned this before.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.190
But those who never attend
Chinese schools, now they

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.480
have 250 characters.

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.130
So they can read now, because
they know these characters

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.920
individually.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.680
They put it in a sentence.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.920
Now they can read
a short paragraph.

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:21.320
So the moment they
get to read the text,

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.390
they are just like so excited.

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:24.720
I can read.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.200
So then there's
the writing part.

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.700
So that's very
different from regular,

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.510
because regular we
have to focus so

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:35.210
much on four skills together.

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.790
Because for true
beginners, if you

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:43.340
ask them to memorize characters,
at same time how to pronounce

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.690
and speak is just too much.

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.530
So for heritage learners,
for the streamlined class,

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.350
we can do it all together.

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.400
So that's a huge difference.

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.670
And, as I say, we're unique.

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:58.000
We're able to do that.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.440
And I don't think my model
is good for every university,

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.790
every high school,
because it all

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.670
depends on your audience,
your student group.

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:10.610
I have teachers from
different universities

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.870
that they can't have
just heritage learners

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:15.150
or streamlined classes.

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:16.700
They have to mix
them up, which just

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.430
makes the teaching
very difficult,

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.360
because some are
here, some are here.

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.950
How do you make the balance?

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:26.030
So I said, I'm fortunate.

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:28.680
You know, I can't
really give advice

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.150
for those teacher who
are in the middle,

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.910
because this is totally
different environment.
