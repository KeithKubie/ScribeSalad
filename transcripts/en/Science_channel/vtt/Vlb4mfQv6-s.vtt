00:00:08.107 --> 00:00:10.276
Narrator:
TO MAKE ICE-CREAM TREATS,

00:00:10.276 --> 00:00:12.812
YOU FIRST HAVE TO MAKE
THE ICE CREAM.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.586
IT ALL BEGINS WITH FRESH CREAM.

00:00:20.586 --> 00:00:23.056
THE FACTORY STORES IT
IN REFRIGERATED SILOS

00:00:23.056 --> 00:00:25.892
SET JUST A FEW DEGREES
ABOVE FREEZING.

00:00:25.892 --> 00:00:28.027
THE SILOS FEED
A HIGH-SPEED MIXER

00:00:28.027 --> 00:00:30.797
THAT BLENDS THE CREAM
WITH OTHER INGREDIENTS.

00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:36.702
THE MAIN DRY INGREDIENTS
ARE POWDERED SKIM MILK

00:00:36.702 --> 00:00:39.472
AND PLANT-BASED STABILIZERS
AND EMULSIFIERS.

00:00:39.472 --> 00:00:42.642
STABILIZERS PREVENT THE ICE
CREAM FROM CRYSTALLIZING,

00:00:42.642 --> 00:00:45.445
AND EMULSIFIERS ALLOW THE MIX
TO BOND WITH AIR

00:00:45.445 --> 00:00:49.649
DURING THE WHIPPING PROCESS.

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.486
THE OTHER INGREDIENTS ARE SUGAR
AND CORN SYRUP.

00:00:56.255 --> 00:00:58.758
AFTER ABOUT THREE MINUTES
OF MIXING,

00:00:58.758 --> 00:01:00.459
A PUMPING SYSTEM MOVES
THE MIXTURE

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:02.162
INTO PASTEURIZATION TANKS

00:01:02.162 --> 00:01:05.931
AND HEATS IT TO 162 DEGREES
FOR HALF AN HOUR,

00:01:05.931 --> 00:01:09.869
KILLING ANY BACTERIA
AND ACTIVATING THE STABILIZERS.

00:01:12.805 --> 00:01:15.674
THEN THE FACTORY HOMOGENIZES
THE MIXTURE,

00:01:15.674 --> 00:01:18.477
A PROCESS THAT BREAKS UP
THE FAT GLOBULES,

00:01:18.477 --> 00:01:21.980
GIVING THE ICE CREAM
A SMOOTH TEXTURE.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.616
THE MIXTURE IS COOLED,

00:01:23.616 --> 00:01:27.020
AND CONCENTRATED VANILLA
FLAVORING IS ADDED.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.189
THEN THE CONCOCTION
IS CHILLED AND WHIPPED

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:31.824
FOR ABOUT 15 SECONDS.

00:01:31.824 --> 00:01:34.193
WHIPPING BLENDS THE MIX
WITH AIR,

00:01:34.193 --> 00:01:36.529
TRANSFORMING IT
FROM A LIQUID TO A SOFT SOLID.

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:38.631
WITHOUT AIR,
THE FINISHED PRODUCT

00:01:38.631 --> 00:01:40.666
WOULD COME OUT LOOKING
LIKE FROZEN MILK

00:01:40.666 --> 00:01:43.002
RATHER THAN ICE CREAM IF IT
WASN'T WHIPPED.

00:01:43.002 --> 00:01:44.703
THE ICE-CREAM-SANDWICH WAFERS

00:01:44.703 --> 00:01:47.106
ARE MADE
OF CHOCOLATE-CAKE INGREDIENTS.

00:01:47.106 --> 00:01:49.408
A FILLING MACHINE FEEDS
TWO LINES OF WAFERS

00:01:49.408 --> 00:01:51.244
TOWARD AN INJECTION PIPE.

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.749
JUST AS TWO WAFERS
COME TOGETHER,

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:58.551
THE MACHINE INJECTS
A THIRD OF A CUP

00:01:58.551 --> 00:02:00.386
OF VANILLA ICE CREAM
IN BETWEEN.

00:02:00.386 --> 00:02:02.789
THE PIPE'S HEAD SHAPES
THE ICE CREAM

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:04.089
INTO A RECTANGULAR SLAB

00:02:04.089 --> 00:02:07.159
THAT FITS PERFECTLY
BETWEEN THE WAFERS.

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:08.761
ALL THIS HAPPENS AT A RATE

00:02:08.761 --> 00:02:13.199
OF 140 ICE-CREAM SANDWICHES
PER MINUTE.

00:02:21.541 --> 00:02:24.110
AS THE SANDWICHES MOVE ON
TO PACKAGING,

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.980
THE FILLING IS STILL ICE-COLD
FROM THE FREEZING PHASE,

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.649
SO THERE IS NO THREAT
OF A MELTDOWN.

00:02:31.584 --> 00:02:35.254
THE PACKAGING SYSTEM RAISES
EACH SANDWICH INTO A WRAPPER,

00:02:35.254 --> 00:02:38.725
THEN FOLDS AND TUCKS THE ENDS.

00:02:41.427 --> 00:02:43.463
THE NEXT MACHINE
COUNTS THE SANDWICHES

00:02:43.463 --> 00:02:45.631
AND INSERTS THEM INTO BOXES.

00:02:45.631 --> 00:02:49.001
ONCE SEALED, THE BOXES GO
DIRECTLY INTO A STORAGE FREEZER

00:02:49.001 --> 00:02:51.271
AT MINUS-22 DEGREES.

00:02:53.405 --> 00:02:56.208
ON ANOTHER LINE,
ICE-CREAM-CONE PRODUCTION

00:02:56.208 --> 00:02:57.377
IS UNDER WAY.

00:02:57.377 --> 00:03:00.113
A FEEDER DROPS
PREWRAPPED SUGAR CONES

00:03:00.113 --> 00:03:02.182
INTO HOLDERS ON A CONVEYOR BELT.

00:03:12.324 --> 00:03:15.161
SPRAYERS COAT THE INSIDES
WITH A CHOCOLATY LAYER,

00:03:15.161 --> 00:03:16.762
WHICH ADDS FLAVOR

00:03:16.762 --> 00:03:19.098
AND CREATES A BARRIER
BETWEEN THE CONES AND ICE CREAM

00:03:19.098 --> 00:03:22.035
SO THE CONE REMAINS CRISPY
UNTIL YOU EAT IT.

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:28.908
NEXT, NOZZLES SQUIRT
IN THE ICE-CREAM FILLING.

00:03:28.908 --> 00:03:31.177
ONE PRODUCTION LINE,
TWO FLAVORS.

00:03:31.177 --> 00:03:33.179
ONE ROW
GETS VANILLA ICE CREAM,

00:03:33.179 --> 00:03:35.215
THE OTHER CHOCOLATE.

00:03:38.618 --> 00:03:41.453
NOW FOR A TASTY SURPRISE
IN THE CONE'S CORE --

00:03:41.453 --> 00:03:44.924
AN INJECTION OF LIQUID CARAMEL.

00:03:44.924 --> 00:03:46.859
THIS FACTORY ALSO MAKES

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:50.697
CHOCOLATE AND STRAWBERRY SAUCE
INSIDE.

00:03:53.666 --> 00:03:56.768
NEXT, A CHOCOLATE-FLAVORED
LIQUID TOPPING.

00:03:56.768 --> 00:03:59.705
THEN THE CRUNCHY
FINISHING TOUCH --

00:03:59.705 --> 00:04:02.642
A LAYER OF CHOCOLATY-COATED
PUFFED RICE.

00:04:14.787 --> 00:04:17.123
FINALLY, THE CONES MOVE
UNDER A LID DISPENSER

00:04:17.123 --> 00:04:20.793
THAT APPLIES A WAX-COATED,
PAPER LID TO EACH ONE.

00:04:20.793 --> 00:04:24.263
A HEATING ELEMENT
INSTANTLY MELTS THE WAX,

00:04:24.263 --> 00:04:27.000
SEALING THE LIDS
TO THE CONE'S PAPER SLEEVE.

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.606
FROM HERE, THE ICE-CREAM CONES
GO INTO BOXES,

00:04:34.606 --> 00:04:38.845
THEN STRAIGHT INTO THE FREEZER,
READY TO TAKE A LICKING.
