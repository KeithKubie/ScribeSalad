00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:03.860
NARRATOR: Some of these
students may have just learned

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:05.870
how to use a tape
measure or a saw,

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:07.930
but they're quick
learners and hard workers

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.530
with an important mission--
to build homes for people

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.416
who desperately need them.

00:00:13.416 --> 00:00:17.660
BRIAN TWOMEY: I was homeless
and living in a shelter-- church

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:18.660
basements.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.570
Prior to that, I owned a home.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.852
And I lost it to foreclosure.

00:00:24.852 --> 00:00:27.650
And it was because
I got really sick.

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.972
And ended up in the hospital
and kind of lost everything.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.790
SARAH SMITH: Nickelsville
is Seattle's largest

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.430
homeless encampment.

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.920
A homeless encampment
is essentially

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.510
a group of people who have
come together to provide safety

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.225
and community to one another.

00:00:45.225 --> 00:00:47.600
And there are some rules that
go along with Nickelsville.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.469
You can't be engaged in any kind
of substance use beyond coffee.

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.260
You really have to put
in community service

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.740
hours that contribute
to the life of the camp

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.510
while you're there.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.010
NARRATOR: Sarah Smith
leads Saw Horse Revolution,

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.840
a youth-oriented construction
program currently focused

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.320
on building an eco
village at Nickelsville,

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.460
including a communal kitchen and
a series of personal shelters

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.484
that are efficient,
custom tiny homes.

00:01:13.484 --> 00:01:14.900
SARAH SMITH: One
of the big things

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.390
we stress in the program
is that homelessness

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:18.910
is a point in time event.

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.430
It's not a result
of who you are.

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.300
So homelessness is something
that happens to you.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.150
And I think we see that
reflected in Nickelsville.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.060
People from all walks of
life-- families, single men,

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.927
single women-- all
can land in this camp.

00:01:37.927 --> 00:01:39.760
NARRATOR: The program
is also a crash course

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.050
in carpentry and design
skills for the students

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:43.870
who experience what
it's like to design

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.162
a structure for a client.

00:01:46.162 --> 00:01:48.370
SARAH SMITH: We actually go
to the homeless community

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.720
and check in and have a couple
different interviews with them

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.937
to see what they need.

00:01:53.937 --> 00:01:55.520
NARRATOR: Materials
for the tiny homes

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.340
are sometimes donated or
re-used from architecture firms

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.987
or salvage stores.

00:01:59.987 --> 00:02:02.070
SARAH SMITH: We actually
have a range of students.

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.120
A lot of them come from
their wood-shop class

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.430
where they're just
making a little box.

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.880
So they might know how
to use a tape measure,

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.789
but the concept
of framing a house

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.807
is something they can't
explore in school.

00:02:12.807 --> 00:02:14.390
NGHI QUAN: [INAUDIBLE]
project, if you

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.135
were to drop me on
an island, I wouldn't

00:02:16.135 --> 00:02:17.760
be able to build
anything, and probably

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.470
die off in like two days.

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.980
And then until now, if
you drop me on an island

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.010
I'll probably like make
a shelter for myself.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.500
Make my own tools and stuff.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.870
SARAH SMITH: This
house basically

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.060
is 10' by 9' on the
interior because we

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.060
sacrificed some of the floor
space for a nice covered porch.

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.230
There's going to be an interior
loft bed that essentially

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.660
has some closet
space underneath,

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.130
as well as shoe storage space.

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.960
There's a bench that
slips up and down

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.910
that has storage inside
of it that's lockable.

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.630
A tiny home is a
really natural fit

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.570
for people in groups
experiencing homelessness.

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.820
It has the aspect
of being a home.

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.450
You can build them really
quickly and at a low expense

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.800
without permitting
for the most part.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.690
BRIAN TWOMEY: It's
transitionary.

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.550
It's a way for me to
be able to save money.

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.350
You know, I got a place to stay.

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.050
I can participate.

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:20.070
And be encampment, you know,
doing my security shifts.

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.950
And it's a way for
me to save money

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.991
so I can that first and
last deposit and get back

00:03:23.991 --> 00:03:25.630
into an apartment.

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:30.460
It's great to be able to have
a key and a lock on, you know,

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:35.260
a door and have your
own space that's secure.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.390
That's very important.

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.110
It's a big difference.

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.180
COLIN LAMB: It's given
me greater awareness

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.600
to the daily struggles
of a lot of people

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.060
who are homeless in Seattle.

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.290
And I can't wait to see
like somebody actually

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.760
living in that house
right there because I'll

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.390
know like, hey, I built that.

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:57.210
It's a great thing.

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.320
NARRATOR: To find out what
rights the homeless have,

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.824
watch this next episode
on Seeker Daily.

00:04:07.824 --> 00:04:09.990
SUBJECT: In Rhode Island,
Connecticut, and Illinois,

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:13.840
some legislation is referred to
as a homeless bill of rights.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.600
It attempts to
guarantee equal access

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.120
for all to medical care, free
speech, free movement, voting

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.589
rights, employment
opportunities, and privacy.

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:23.130
