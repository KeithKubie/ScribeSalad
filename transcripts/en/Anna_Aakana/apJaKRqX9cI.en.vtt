00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500
You know what I hate?

00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:02.520
Everything.

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.440
Wow, ok. Someone's in a dark place.

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:11.480
Uh, sure. What I was gonna say is overthinking.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.880
It probably comes as no surprise to anyone who knows me,

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.300
but I overthink everything.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.020
Anything, really, and sometimes I can't help it

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.000
because engaging in self-reflection and expressing my findings is kind of what I do for a living. I mean it's what I'm doing right now.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.760
But I do know that there is a very very healthy line between

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:35.480
insightful introspection and just overthinking like hell, and the negative effects are really bad

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.960
I mean seriously, studies have shown that rumination leads to depression, anxiety,

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.060
binge drinking, binge eating, inability to sleep and self-harm.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.399
I have had every single symptom of the danger of dwelling and yet I can't quite kick the habit of it.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.860
Especially when it's silly, even when it's silly like analyzing the punctuation of a text message.

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.500
*Classical music*

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.340
*phone beeps*
*classical music continues*

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:06.060
*classical music continues*

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.240
"Wait, she used a period!

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.969
Does that mean she's mad? Cause no one uses periods right? Oh my god!

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.990
Maybe I should analyze her previous texts to see if she used that to establish a base of what her normal texting behavior is.

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.349
That way I know if this use of a period and the specific sentence has any significance.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:19.900
Yes.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.540
That is a good use of my time."

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.660
Although to be fair, like, periods in text messages are kind of ominous and rare right? Right Kat?

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.540
*laughs* I just want people to know that it's real

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:37.360
cause Kat, my friend Kat, actually puts periods at the end of every single one of her sentences and texts,

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.880
and I didn't notice it before like the other day and was like she's mad at me.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.140
She hates me there's something wrong and so...

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.130
But then I realized like I analyzed all of your text message and found out that you had a period in every one.

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.920
But then I looked at all my other text messages and nobody else really uses it unless it's necessary, so...

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.180
Just so everyone knows, it's real.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.360
It's exhausting. Once I get into the cycle of overthinking,

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:02.340
I'll ask myself the same negative self-blame question over and over and over again throughout the day.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.140
*whispers to self*

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.360
Uh is it okay that I said that last night?

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.720
I shouldn't have said that. - Am I being difficult? - Does everyone think that I'm difficult? -  Am I hard to get along with?

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:09.869
I don't think I'm being difficult. Why would I be difficult?

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:16.880
Does everyone hate me? Everyone must hate me. I'll never get it right.

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.540
Should I apologize?

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.780
*whisper ends*

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.470
If you're an over-thinker, know this! I read this one line in a study

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.440
and it really helped shape like how I think about overthinking now.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.059
And it's that your psychological response to an event is actually

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.089
more important than what happened to you.

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:41.570
So if you can't train your brain to stop overthinking, you're giving yourself negative mental health consequences.

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.059
I don't know about you, but I already got plenty of those.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.640
I don't need anymore. So what can we do? Well number one, practice mindfulness.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.720
I know, I know I'm always like: "Therapy and meditation will fix everything", but it's kind of true.

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.899
2017 has been the worst battle with depression of my life, with seasonal depression being like a nice little cherry on top.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.360
So I'm trying to be very very diligent about giving myself

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:10.600
ten to twenty minutes of mindful practice every single day. You can't train your mind without actually putting the work into it, so

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:17.690
whether you're using the headspace app or YouTube guided meditations, or just your timer on your phone, find what works for you.

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.940
You can have your brain acknowledge and let go of thoughts.

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.540
And the more practice you put into that, the more easily you can disassociate yourself from the negative ones.

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.500
Two: Be active! The only reason we have time to overthink is because

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.920
we have time to overthink. So be physical! Be creative!

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.360
Last month I picked up water coloring to keep myself occupied.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:44.120
It's penguin-ing to look a lot like Christmas. Have a chill holiday. We're gonna have a narly time in Iceland.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.420
Whether that's picking up painting or going for walks or reading books or getting hella jacked at the gym.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.500
Don't give your mind the luxury of chewing on something longer than it should.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:58.560
And three, if you absolutely have to think about it, practice compassionate problem-solving.

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.739
So if I feel really bad that I hurt someone's feelings, instead of beating myself up about it over and over,

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.739
instead I should ask myself: What can I do about it?

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:10.219
How can I learn from this experience and how can I prevent it from happening again?

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.839
So that instead of continually giving myself the message that I suck and I'm an awful person,

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:21.859
I'm focusing on correcting a behavior or a mistake and encouraging myself to be better because of it. So what about you?

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:27.799
