You asked me whether the football cup is going
to help Africa. My names is Guy Pfeffermann

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:13.210
and I run the Global Business School Network,
which has lots and lots of business schools

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:18.329
in Africa and the rest of the world and the
answer is a resounding Yes, because it's going

00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:24.970
to show people Africa is a continent of achievement,
of hope of great expectations for the future

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:30.800
and also a tremendous market. So I have no
doubt it will change many many people's image

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.920
of Africa and it will change the image, not
just of South Africa and thier eyes, but of

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:36.749
all of Africa.
