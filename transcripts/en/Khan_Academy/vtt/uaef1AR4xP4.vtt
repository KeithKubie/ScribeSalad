00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.580
- [Instructor] In 1890, the
United States was not exactly

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.070
a major player on the world stage.

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:07.880
It was an industrial behemoth,

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.500
attracting immigrants
from all over the world,

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.350
but it was focused on
its own internal growth,

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:14.980
not foreign affairs.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.240
There was little in the way
of a shared popular culture,

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.530
and there was practically
no government regulation

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:22.210
of industry or the market.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.340
Compare that to the United states in 1945,

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.280
which had a bustling
shared national culture,

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.660
a social safety net, and
lots of industry regulations

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.610
brought on by depression and war.

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.810
And the United States was the
strongest nation on earth.

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.680
For a time, the world's lone atomic power.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.700
These are all enormous changes,

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.990
changes in ideas about the economy,

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:47.340
American culture, and the United
States' role in the world.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.430
As a historian,

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.700
I'm curious about how these changes

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.710
affected American national
identity during this period.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.050
National identity is a
bit of a slippery thing,

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.870
but it encompasses a lot of core values

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.590
and beliefs in society

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.900
about who counts as an American,
how Americans should act,

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.700
and how the United States should
relate to other countries.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.940
So how can we measure just how much impact

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.380
the events of the first
half of the 20th century had

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.070
on American national identity.

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.980
First, we need to get more specific

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.150
about which core beliefs
around national identity

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:23.350
we wanna track,

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.290
since one of the changes we're looking at

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.520
relates to the growing regulation

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.610
of the American economy
in this time period.

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.450
One belief I think would be
valuable to examine over time

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.130
is individualism.

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.110
This is the idea that
everyone should be able

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.150
to pull themselves up by their bootstraps

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.060
to earn a good living
through their own hard work.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.170
This has been a pretty core
American value over time,

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.560
but there certainly have been moments

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.690
when many have question whether
it can really be achieved.

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.980
Next, I'm curious about changes

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.190
in American cultural
identity over this period.

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.070
People did a lot of moving around

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.610
in the early 20th century,
going from farms to cities,

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.660
and from the old country to the new.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.990
So did the United States develop a shared

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.150
national culture in this time
period along with the advent

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.850
of new communication
technologies like the radio,

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.400
or were cultural values
in the United States

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.680
fractured along lines of
race, class, and ethnicity?

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.120
Finally, since this is the era in which

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.680
the United States grew into a world power,

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.340
I'd like to look at changes in beliefs

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.850
about what the proper US
role in the world should be.

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.480
Okay, now that we've
decided which core values

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.610
of national identity we wanna track,

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.020
let's brain storm some of the major events

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.980
that may have affected these
values during this period.

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.350
I encourage you to pause the video here,

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:43.010
and think about what events
you might wanna discuss

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.370
related to these themes.

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.000
Think about the big things
that happened in this era

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.820
and how they could affect
ideas about individualism,

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.780
culture, and the United
States' role in the world.

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.860
You may come up with some
different things than I do,

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:55.760
and that's okay.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.990
Remember, we're doing a high-level
overview of events here,

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.800
so I'm not gonna go into
much depth about any of them.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.690
But if I mention something
you're not familiar with,

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:04.640
just jot it down,

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.920
and you can follow up
on that concept later.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.590
Okay, first, let's look at
beliefs around individualism.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.490
This is really a question
about whether people thought

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.000
it was possible for them
to earn a good living

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.700
through hard work alone.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.240
In the 1890s, there were
a few questions about

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.600
whether industrialization
and business consolidation

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.150
was making it impossible for
ordinary people to succeed,

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.610
like the farmers who
supported the Populist Party,

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.150
and wanted the government
to regulate railroads

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.730
and alter the money supply.

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.770
But they didn't get too much traction.

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:36.820
The progressive era also introduced

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.720
some regulations on business,

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.910
with presidents like Teddy
Roosevelt busting trusts,

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.010
and reformers helping to pass laws

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.260
protecting workers and consumers.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.430
The Roaring Twenties, by contrast,

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.840
was an era of boundless optimism

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.380
about the individual's
ability to get wealthy.

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:54.850
With lots of ordinary folks

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:56.410
investing in the stock market,

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.600
and believing that the
economic boom would never end,

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.350
but of course it did end,

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:02.183
and with it,

00:04:02.183 --> 00:04:04.940
so did a lot of people's
faith in individualism.

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.610
Factors outside the
control of any one person

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:08.910
brought on the great depression,

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.410
and people looked to the government

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.380
to provide relief to citizens

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.470
in a way that it had never done before.

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.200
The new deal established
a social safety net

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.800
and a limited welfare state

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.940
that would influence the
American economy for decades.

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.020
So looking at this period as a whole,

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.470
it seems like the events of the first half

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.960
of the 20th century had
a pretty profound effect

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.190
on the belief in American individualism.

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.970
Industrialization and
then the Great Depression

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.390
led to a growing sense that
the modern industrial economy

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:41.300
was too large of a machine for individuals

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.550
to navigate it successfully on their own.

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.420
And therefore, the government had a duty

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.190
to see to the welfare of its citizens.

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:52.210
Next, let's examine American
culture over this time period.

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.960
Was there one shared national culture,

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.970
like the melting pot analogy

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.130
or were there many tensions
and divisions in culture

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:04.680
over things like ideas, race,
religion, or gender roles.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:05.810
During this time period,

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.290
migration to cities led to the development

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:11.400
of cultural enclaves, like Little Italy,

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.380
and new cultural movements
like the Harlem Renaissance.

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.380
Those might suggest a
more divided culture.

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.410
On the other hand, the growing popularity

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:22.320
of radio and cinema in the 1920s

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:23.730
contributed to the development

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:26.360
of a national culture where
people across the country

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.850
could watch the same movies,

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:29.750
listen to the same radio shows,

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:31.710
and root for the same sports starts.

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.660
But there was also a backlash
against immigrant culture

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.110
and the urban modern environment

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.530
with the re-emergence of the KKK,

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:41.220
restrictions on freedom of speech,

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:44.830
and calls for 100% Americanism
during World War I,

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:47.640
and emigration restrictions in the 1920s.

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.630
However, American propaganda
during World War II

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:52.290
emphasize the diversity

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:54.310
and inclusiveness of the United States,

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:57.210
in contrast to Nazi racial ideology.

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:00.040
And US culture became more
accepting toward immigrants

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.580
from European backgrounds.

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.910
But Asian-Americans and African-Americans

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:06.070
were so largely excluded.

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:08.520
So the cultural transition
of the United States

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.450
is a bit of a mixed bag
in this time period.

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:12.470
There were both elements

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:13.870
that brought the country together

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:15.500
in a shared national culture,

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.290
and elements that
divided it based on race,

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:20.100
ethnicity, and belief.

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:22.190
Last, let's look at beliefs about

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:24.620
the role of the United
States in the world.

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:28.000
Up until the Spanish-American war in 1898,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.140
the guiding US foreign
policy was isolationism,

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:33.170
staying out of world affairs.

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:34.850
But by the turn of the 20th century,

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:36.350
the US government was tempted

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:38.310
to get in on the imperial game,

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:40.140
like the great powers of Europe,

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:42.680
and it did so with the
acquisition of Cuba,

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.600
Hawaii, and the Philippines.

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.530
United States was also reluctant

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:48.450
to get involved in World War I,

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:52.490
and did so only very late in
the war, after provocation.

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:53.840
After World War I,

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:56.840
the United States return to
its policy of isolationism

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:59.710
throughout the 1920s and 1930s,

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:03.280
but the Japanese bombing
of Pearl Harbor in 1941

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.980
led the country to fully mobilize for war.

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:08.100
After the war with Europe in ruins

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:10.400
and growing tensions
with the Soviet Union,

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.800
the United States would
abandon isolationism

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.010
as a foreign policy,

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:16.640
in favor of membership
in the United Nations

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:19.720
and military interventions
to contain communism.

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:21.950
So this too is a major shift

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:25.360
from outright isolationism,
to imperialism,

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:27.080
to interventionism.

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:29.750
The events of the first
half of the 20th century,

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:31.640
changed the core belief that

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:33.310
the United States was better off

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:35.260
staying out of world affairs

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.680
into the belief that US
involvement was crucial

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:40.040
to maintaining order in world affairs.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.710
So given the evidence we've compiled here,

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:46.580
which major events of the
first half of the 20th century

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:49.430
had the greatest impact
on national identity?

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:51.700
It seems like the aspects
of national identity

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:55.150
that changed the most were
the belief in individualism,

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:57.560
which transitioned into
a greater acceptance

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:58.810
of the role of government

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:00.870
in advancing citizen's welfare,

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:02.980
and the belief in isolationism,

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:04.440
which transitioned into the belief

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:07.670
that the United States should
intervene in world affairs.

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:09.700
Which events were most crucial

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:11.420
in changing those beliefs?

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:12.870
I would say that the Great Depression

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:14.200
was the most influential

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.160
in altering individualism,

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.640
and World War II was the most influential

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:20.530
in altering isolationism.

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:21.363
What do you think?

00:08:21.363 --> 00:08:23.960
Would you come to the same
conclusions that I have?

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:25.870
Next, think about how you might

00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:28.930
write a thesis statement in
order to answer this question

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:30.880
using the evidence that we've gathered.
