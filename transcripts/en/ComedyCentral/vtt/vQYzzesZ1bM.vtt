00:00:05.771 --> 00:00:08.107
  - Hello, I would
  like to purchase a

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:09.842
  delicious drink from you.

00:00:09.875 --> 00:00:11.110
 - Uh, yeah, I'm sorry,

00:00:11.143 --> 00:00:12.111
 I didn't know anyone
 else was still here.

00:00:12.144 --> 00:00:14.313
 We closed like two hours ago.

00:00:14.346 --> 00:00:17.417
- I would like a drink,
heavy with alcohol.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.118
  You must be wondering why.

00:00:19.151 --> 00:00:20.520
 Thank you for asking.

00:00:20.553 --> 00:00:22.789
  I've had a long stressful
  day at the office.

00:00:22.822 --> 00:00:25.091
 Crunching and grinding
 and now I want my

00:00:25.124 --> 00:00:27.660
 blood diluted, my brain slowed

00:00:27.693 --> 00:00:30.296
 by your sweet liquid caress.

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:32.498
 - Ah, I see.

00:00:32.531 --> 00:00:33.866
  Well, you know, we got a,

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.802
  a really great bar
  down the street

00:00:35.835 --> 00:00:38.404
 that does, uh, blood dilution.

00:00:38.437 --> 00:00:41.474
 - Inside of me is an
 aching need, writhing,

00:00:41.507 --> 00:00:44.377
  dancing, years of droughts
  have caused a desert

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.213
 and now I stand here begging.

00:00:47.246 --> 00:00:49.148
- Well, well I'm gonna go make a

00:00:49.181 --> 00:00:50.750
 phone call real quick.

00:00:50.783 --> 00:00:53.086
 (crunching)

00:00:56.021 --> 00:00:58.324
 - The doors of my home
 have been shuttered.

00:00:58.357 --> 00:00:59.625
And guess what?

00:00:59.658 --> 00:01:01.961
 Baby's not allowed in
 the hospital anymore.

00:01:01.994 --> 00:01:04.464
 And so baby wanders,
 looking for mommy.

00:01:04.497 --> 00:01:05.765
 But mommy isn't there,

00:01:05.798 --> 00:01:07.733
 (voice raising) Not
 at this time of night.

00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:10.436
 The blood of my family
 pools around my feet.

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:13.073
(voice deepening) And so
I stand here, waiting.

00:01:14.006 --> 00:01:14.907
 - You know I,

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.409
if you wanna drink, that's fine.

00:01:16.442 --> 00:01:18.044
  I'll get you a
  drink, no problem.

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:23.616
 - Serve me, touch me,
 serve me, touch me,

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:26.619
(voice raising) serve
me, serve me, serve me!

00:01:26.652 --> 00:01:28.555
- Please don't hurt me!

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.092
 (light music)

00:01:33.125 --> 00:01:35.428
 - (child's voice)
 Oh, this looks yummy!

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:37.797
  Thank you, Mister.

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.166
I'm sorry about being so weird.

00:01:40.199 --> 00:01:42.268
  I just really needed this.

00:01:42.301 --> 00:01:45.205
  (cheerful humming)

00:01:46.138 --> 00:01:47.540
 - Yeah, we're still closed.
