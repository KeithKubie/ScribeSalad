Speaker 1:          00:00          The Joe Rogan experience. That's an interesting thing for someone who studies artificial intelligence. I mean if anybody listen to this podcast, like what the fuck did I do? So many reservoir dogs, they talk about movies. So many people. And you're talking about autonomous vehicles. We have plenty of time, sir. We have plenty of time. But that's the beautiful thing about this podcast. We're just talking. So tell me what you got here with your notes man. I mean you are fucking prepared. I mean you have a lot of shit here. Many, many pages for sure. I don't want to miss out on this stuff. I mean there's a, there's been a lot of exciting stuff on the autonomous vehicle space since you came on. I got a Tesla and I've experienced with that thing is like when I put it on autopilot and it's stunning. Yeah, crazy. I mean this is the performance of the v amazing well in, in terms of its ability to change lanes and its ability to drive without you doing anything.

Speaker 1:          00:55          I just put my hand on the wheel and hold it there and it does all the work. So because like one or two people listen to this podcast, I want to take this opportunity and tell people, if you drive a Tesla, whether you listen to this now or a year from now, two years from now, Tesla or any other car, keep your damn eyes on the road. So whatever you think the system is able to do, you will have to still monitor the road and you still have to take over when it fails, if when really. So we're throwing, this is like the moment we're throwing down right now. I think it's an your level of expertise obviously. I mean, I'm not throwing down with you on that. No, I think it's really important to, in this transitionary phase, whatever the car company, uh, whatever the system that we don't overtrust a system, we don't become complacent.

Speaker 1:          01:52          We don't think he could do more than they can. Currently. 40,000 people die in the United States from, from fatal crashes. The number one reason for that is distraction. So texting smart phones, how much has it gone up since smart phones, people don't, exactly, they're trying to understand that. There's a lot of studies showing that it's significant increases, but it's hard to say it's because of smartphones, but it's almost obvious. It's pretty obvious. The, the flip side is even though everybody's not using a smart phone, texting and so on, they've become better at using the smartphone. So they're better at texting and driving the better balancing that. Now this is a horrible thing to do. So if you're listening to this podcast, you should, uh, listen to it in your car and keep your eyes on the road and not text. I think worst was Pokemon when Pokemon was in its prime. I was watching a guy on the highway playing Pokemon as he was driving. No more than one person. Two people, a guy. And I saw a girl do it once to holding the phone on the steering wheel. Playing Pokemon. Yeah. Yeah. It's incredible. What are you doing Jamie? That's GRANDPA's. Oh Shit. Sorry.

Speaker 1:          03:07          I'm confused. What does this, uh, this grandpa in Japan, he drives around on a bike. Oh, my phones playing Pokemon all at the same time. This guy is 15 phones. It's ridiculous. This guy needs to find hookers. There's people that do this also in their car with maybe four or five doing exactly what you're saying. This man needs a better hobby. This is preposterous. He can't see what the fuck's going on in front of him. He spends about $300 a month to buy virtual currencies in the game. Wow. That guy's board or in an innovative genius, depending on the perspective. One eye, people misuse their innovative Josie innovative. He's just playing a stupid game while he's driving around on his bike like an asshole. Well, he's doing in fact instead set of a woman thing. It's passion. It's the most amazing moment of his life playing Pokemon.

Speaker 1:          04:00          I'm sure most people are on my side. Sensible woman versus do you think most people are on your side? They think Sonneville woman's the greatest movie, all that to a woman, but I was defending godfather sent to a woman. You weren't defending godfather against me. I mean, I'm going to throw you under the band. Okay. I'm going to manipulate this conversation. Jamie, can you edit this in post? Did you see the video that just came out yesterday of a Tesla on autopilot? Avoiding a crash. All right, so yeah, I have and there's a lot of exams. Quite a few of those. Yeah, of course. It's like hard to prove exactly what happened and where the auto Paul was involved. Just like on the flip side, it's hard to prove that autopilot was involved in the dangerous stuff. But I think by any measure, the media is really negative in terms of their reporting on tests that there, I think, I think you've talked to this about before in general and negativity gets more clicks, right?

Speaker 1:          04:53          And I think Tesla negative stuff on Tesla gets a lot of clicks, so, well not Tesla. Let me speak more broadly about autonomous vehicles. If there's any fatality, any crash, it's overrepresented. It's over reported on. So I need to meet people who are interested in AI helping save lives in these systems like autopilot. I feel you carry the responsibility of being at least as good at as a driver. You are. I want it under manual control. So don't text and drive. Keep your eyes on the road. If I say anything over and over on this podcast is that drunk driving, of course, is the other one, and so don't drink and drive, but the number one thing is distracted driving.
