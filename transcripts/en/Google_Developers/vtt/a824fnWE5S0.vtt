[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.325 --> 00:00:06.950
BEN SCHROM: My name
is Benjamin Schrom.

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.100
I'm a product manager
on the Daydream team,

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.870
focused specifically on using
immersive technology like VR/AR

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:16.450
to make learning
and teaching better.

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:18.690
And I'm joined by two
members of our team here--

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.820
Jen, who's our program manager,
fresh from the Daydream keynote

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.621
just now, and Brandon, who
leads our engineering team.

00:00:25.621 --> 00:00:28.120
So we're going to share some
updates on Expeditions with you

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.490
today, show what we've
been up to lately,

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.500
and then show you how
it's possible to make

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.470
your own learning
application with VR/AR,

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.740
and then offer some thoughts
about why you should do that.

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.160
Now, I'd wager if you ask most
people to list the things they

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.490
think VR would be good for,
most people would actually

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.392
put education sort of
at the top of that list.

00:00:48.392 --> 00:00:50.350
We talk about it sort of
like it seems obvious,

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:51.391
and it is pretty obvious.

00:00:51.391 --> 00:00:55.010
It's like the first thing we
did with it here at Google.

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.530
But it's not just
because VR is fun

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.180
or because it makes you feel
like you're somewhere else

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.070
that it's an obvious
fit for learning.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.560
At least within our team,
it's because it powerfully

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.040
supports what our
values are as people

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:11.490
who are trying to enable better
learning with technology.

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.710
And what are those values?

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.918
Well, for us, we think that
good learning experiences

00:01:14.918 --> 00:01:17.200
should be fundamentally
immersive, interactive,

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.000
and social.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.370
And we act, no surprise,
that we actually

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.830
believe those same
things are the ones that

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.880
characterize VR experiences.

00:01:28.465 --> 00:01:29.840
We think they
should be immersive

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.420
because being engaged,
interested, emotionally

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.760
invested-- these are really
important contexts in which

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:35.716
to learn.

00:01:35.716 --> 00:01:37.965
And when things are immersive,
they are less abstract.

00:01:37.965 --> 00:01:41.670
There's sort of less
cognitive load to process.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.790
We also think that they
need to be interactive

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.670
because it's empowering
them agency as a user,

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.730
to not feel constrained, to
be able to have a thought

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.490
and see a result,
to be able to dig in

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.090
deeper when you see something
that piques your interest.

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.820
And they're social because
when people come together

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.220
as a group with
diverse viewpoints

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.350
that they discuss
and synthesize,

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.350
then we learn from one another.

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.959
And we end up with the sum
that's greater than the parts.

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:13.500
And this is important
to us at Google

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.670
because we aren't interested in
just creating future graduates.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.710
We want to create
future creators,

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.200
inventors, problem
solvers, dreamers.

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.150
So that's why we
started Expeditions.

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.150
We wanted to give schools
a simple, approachable, and

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.150
immediately useful tool for
using VR in the classroom

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.210
and creating more of those
sorts of experiences on a more

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:37.470
regular basis.

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.040
And here to talk to you a
little bit more about it is Jen.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.290
JENNIFER HOLLAND: Thanks, Ben.

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.130
So Expeditions was
announced two years ago,

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.170
and it was our first
large-scale effort

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.180
to bring VR in the classroom.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.200
And all schools needed was a
simple smartphone or tablet

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.910
and a VR viewer,
and they could be

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.400
teleported all over the world--

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.495
underwater and even to Mars.

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.890
And on our team, many
of the same people

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.010
that built Classroom and
G Suite for Education

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.050
are the same people
that built Expeditions.

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.830
And we were able to rely really
heavily on those insights

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.534
that we acquired.

00:03:18.534 --> 00:03:20.700
And one of the most important
things that we learned

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.950
is that you really need to
embrace the key functions

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.040
of a classroom.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.670
That's students
engaging, interacting,

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.265
learning with each other
as well as their peers.

00:03:29.265 --> 00:03:31.140
But there are also a
couple other things that

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.348
are actually really critical.

00:03:32.348 --> 00:03:34.720
One is it needs to
be so easy to use.

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.590
You can't rely on teachers to
go to professional development

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.010
training to get
trained on your tool.

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.970
Two, you need to really
make that immersion,

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.800
that social connection
between teachers and students,

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.690
and students and students.

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.770
And make making sure that
it's engaging and interacting.

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:56.600
And you need to make sure
that your product works

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.830
on multiple devices
and platforms.

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.750
And that's really
important because schools

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.610
have a variety of
devices, and they

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:03.930
have a variety of platforms.

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.540
And they're not just
going to pick one.

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.650
And you can't expect teachers
to replace their materials

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:11.220
overnight.

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.100
And so you need to make sure
your tool or your product

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.160
can easily fit into the
existing curriculum.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.470
And that's what we
did with Expeditions.

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.140
And just like
Chromebooks, we imagined

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.500
that the Expedition Kits
would be a shared resource

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.365
between classes and schools.

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:35.110
One of the biggest
things we realized

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.200
was that most teachers
weren't actually aware of VR

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.010
when we first started this.

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:44.290
And so what we decided to do
was bring Expeditions to schools

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:47.200
through the Expeditions
Pioneer Program.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.100
And what we saw was that
once teachers got a chance

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.370
to see VR in action
and see how Expeditions

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.940
could transform their classroom,
they were immediately hooked.

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.820
And so the first year,
we took Expeditions

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.580
to over a million
students in 11 countries.

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.340
And we got incredible feedback,
particularly from teachers

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:07.330
in the UK.

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.360
So this past year we
actually went back to the UK,

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.460
and we just wrapped
up our program there.

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.570
And we took another
million students in the UK

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:17.530
on an Expedition.

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:19.990
And that's one in
about every eight

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.925
primary and secondary
students in all of the UK.

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.740
So that brings our
total number of students

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:30.560
that I've gone on and used
Expeditions to over two million

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.650
in the last two years.

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.380
And even after
Expeditions has been

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.290
used for weeks or
months or years,

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:41.450
we still get the
same teacher feedback

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:43.920
like this each and every day.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.640
And so it's not just
the novelty of VR.

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:51.080
Clearly something is
working in the classroom.

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.210
And even more
importantly, we've heard

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:56.360
from thousands of students
from around the world who

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.710
have sent us personal letters.

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:01.460
And actually, these are just
the ones we got last week.

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:02.480
So you can see.

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:06.170
And I want to share one of them
with you because it's really

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:08.240
too precious not to share.

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.410
So this is from Lozen.

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:12.800
He's a student in the UK,
and he sent us this letter.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.720
He said, "The whole
experience has

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.510
made me even more keen
to become a doctor

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:19.820
and study the human
body thoroughly.

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:23.660
The technology I used helped
me understand complex subjects

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:24.920
easily.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:28.160
The solar system trip was
incredibly fascinating.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.350
I did not feel myself
sitting in class.

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:34.660
Instead, I felt like Tim Peake
orbiting the solar system.

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:36.590
Now I'm not sure
whether I should

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:39.170
be a doctor or an astronaut.

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:41.300
I'm quite confused
at this moment.

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:44.060
My mom says I should watch more
of these Google Expeditions

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:45.590
before I make up my mind.

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:49.127
And for once, I think
I'll listen to her."

00:06:49.127 --> 00:06:51.881
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:51.881 --> 00:06:54.320
And yes, Lozen, we
agree with your mom.

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:57.068
You should probably go on
more Google Expeditions.

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:02.006
So things are clearly
working, and there's

00:07:02.006 --> 00:07:03.630
quite a bit of momentum
that's actually

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:05.610
happening in the ecosystem.

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:09.120
We're seeing hundreds of
partners create Expeditions--

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.370
everything from traditional
education partners

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:14.580
like HMH to
nontraditional partners.

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:17.190
And we're working with museums
and cultural institutions

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:20.310
to create these Expeditions,
and we have a growing library

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:23.130
of over 600 tours.

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:25.410
We've also worked with
many hardware partners

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:27.330
to create certified
Expedition Kits.

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:29.850
So that all the hardware
that class of 30

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:32.550
would actually need
to take an Expedition.

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:35.640
And Best Buy Education was
one of our first partners

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:39.630
that we worked with last year
to launch an Expeditions Kit.

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:42.000
And we've now worked with
several other partners

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.250
around the globe to ensure
that schools actually

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:48.370
have certified kits to use.

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:50.550
We've also worked really
closely with teachers

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:52.290
to create supporting
lesson plans, which

00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:54.930
is really important because,
as I mentioned earlier,

00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:56.670
the lessons need
to be incorporated

00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:59.250
into the actual curriculum
so that teachers

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:01.150
can use it seamlessly.

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:03.750
And so we partnered with
Tes to upload these lessons.

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:05.640
And Tes is a global platform.

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:07.140
It has over eight
million teachers

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:10.350
that are sharing and
learning with each other

00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:13.260
and their lesson materials.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.150
And what's really cool
is that we're also

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:17.820
seeing Expeditions used
outside of the classroom,

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:20.550
and that's something that we
didn't initially anticipate.

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:22.380
We're seeing government
organizations.

00:08:22.380 --> 00:08:23.640
We're seeing nonprofits.

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:28.860
And we're seeing businesses
start to use Expeditions.

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:31.050
So let's just take a
look at one example.

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:33.809
And what you see on the screen
is actually our Coral Bleaching

00:08:33.809 --> 00:08:35.340
Expedition.

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:38.309
So it's basically highlighting
the coral bleaching

00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:40.890
event that took place in 2014.

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:43.049
And Michael, who is a
sixth grade earth science

00:08:43.049 --> 00:08:48.360
teacher in New Jersey
used this Expedition

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:50.910
to explain the impact
that climate change was

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:53.394
happening to his students.

00:08:53.394 --> 00:08:55.560
And they were able to go
underwater and actually see

00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:57.690
the coral bleaching event.

00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:00.090
And when talking to Michael
about the experience,

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:02.340
he highlighted that
Expedition continues

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:05.127
to add another layer
of authenticity

00:09:05.127 --> 00:09:06.960
to the learning in the
classroom by using it

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:09.780
effectively and seamlessly
and integrating it

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:13.420
into the curriculum.

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:15.850
And what amazed me, though,
about this expedition

00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:18.070
in particular was
that it was used

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:22.210
at COP21, which
happened in Paris

00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:24.670
and it was the UN climate
change conference.

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:27.400
And I was actually
fortunate enough to attend.

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.830
And there was a
presentation with about 150

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:30.730
different scientists.

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:32.800
And it was a big panel.

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:35.080
and what was a one-way
dialogue between the panel

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:37.750
and the audience
became really lively

00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:40.570
when a scientist actually
took an Expeditions Kit

00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:43.420
and started passing it
out to the audience.

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:45.550
Everyone started going on
this expedition together

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:48.610
and actually could observe the
big coral bleaching event that

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:51.190
happened in Hawaii in 2014.

00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:54.760
And the whole room was
transformed instantly.

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:56.500
So we're seeing some
of these examples

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:58.880
occur rather frequently.

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:01.785
And it's really exciting for
us to see not only Expeditions

00:10:01.785 --> 00:10:03.160
is used in the
classroom, but how

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.980
it's used outside of the
classroom over the past two

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:08.410
years.

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:10.650
So what's next with Expeditions?

00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:13.980
One of the most important things
that we value as an education

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:17.070
product team is listening
to teachers and students.

00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:18.990
We take feedback
really seriously,

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:21.810
and we actually read every
single piece of feedback

00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:22.800
that we receive.

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:26.130
And I kid you not, because my
team is the one that does it.

00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:29.850
So we're actually working to
address some of the top feature

00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:32.490
requests that we've gotten
from teachers and students,

00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:36.420
and now we're going to take
a look at a sneak peek.

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:39.360
So with over 600
tours available,

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:42.030
we know it can be a bit
challenging for teachers

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:47.490
to actually find the Expeditions
that we're looking for.

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:52.190
So rolling out soon, you'll see
a new UI in the Expeditions app

00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:55.820
that will allow you to see a
set of featured Expeditions.

00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:59.442
You'll be able to search
by specific categories.

00:10:59.442 --> 00:11:00.900
And we've also
improved the search.

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:03.740
So it'll make browsing a lot
easier to find the Expeditions

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:06.410
that you want.

00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:07.910
And the other really
important thing

00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:09.930
is that the UI is
really responsive.

00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:11.840
And it works on a
tablet or a phone.

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:15.110
So we know if you're in Magic
Window mode or full screen mode

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:16.970
with a tablet, it
will work great.

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:20.910
Or if you're on your mobile
device, it will work fine.

00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:23.490
And so now, I'm going
to turn it over to Ben.

00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:24.980
BEN SCHROM: Thanks, Jen.

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:27.500
We've also heard from teachers
that they want more tools

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:30.440
to explain and highlight the
things within Expedition scenes

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.520
and environments.

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:36.110
So we'll be bringing this
new sort of Annotations tool

00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:38.130
that lets you draw right
on top of Expeditions.

00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:40.660
And we think this is going
be really, really useful.

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:42.290
If you think of
the number of times

00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:44.900
when you're watching a sports
commentator use a telestrator

00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:48.470
to illustrate a particularly
interesting play in a game,

00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:50.630
it's exactly the
same thing here.

00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:53.630
And the way this works is a guy
can draw something on the scene

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:56.360
with their finger or a
stylus, like here sort

00:11:56.360 --> 00:12:00.410
of pointing out where a new
set of solar panels might go.

00:12:00.410 --> 00:12:03.410
And then each of the
connected explorers,

00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:07.162
they see that same thing
reflected on there's as well.

00:12:07.162 --> 00:12:08.892
There you go.

00:12:08.892 --> 00:12:09.600
It's really cool.

00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:14.910
And now for the number
one most requested

00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:17.980
feature of all-- the ability
to explore on your own.

00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:21.360
Now we see firsthand each day
how powerful a teaching tool

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:24.345
Expeditions can be when used
in a classroom of 30 students.

00:12:24.345 --> 00:12:26.220
But we also acknowledge
that as much learning

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:30.220
happens outside the classroom
as happens within it.

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:33.360
You don't always find yourself
with a willing and able teacher

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:34.800
right there in
the room with you.

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:37.110
So we'll soon be making
Expeditions available in a Solo

00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:40.230
Mode that lets you experience
them without a live guide

00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:42.360
present.

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:45.019
We've built out a full
VR UI within Expeditions

00:12:45.019 --> 00:12:47.310
that lets you do everything
right there, like searching

00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:51.532
and discovering awesome
Expeditions content all in VR.

00:12:51.532 --> 00:12:53.490
And when you've found
the Expeditions you like,

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:56.490
you can dive right in and step
through the scenes and sites

00:12:56.490 --> 00:12:58.685
within that Expedition
at your own pace.

00:12:58.685 --> 00:13:00.060
You can learn more
by bringing up

00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:02.060
this info panel with
relevant facts and details.

00:13:04.184 --> 00:13:06.600
And just so you don't feel
like when you're alone with VR,

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:08.725
we've added support for
narrations to accompany you

00:13:08.725 --> 00:13:09.340
as well.

00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:12.300
NARRATOR: View of the
spot where Hamilton fell.

00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:14.160
This 1830 view of
the dueling grounds

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:16.470
in Weehawken, New Jersey,
shows a memorial to Hamilton

00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:18.480
with Manhattan in
the background.

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:20.590
After being shot
by Burr, Hamilton

00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:23.970
was rowed back across the
river to Manhattan by friends.

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:24.646
According to a--

00:13:24.646 --> 00:13:26.770
BEN SCHROM: So that should
give you a little taste.

00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:28.300
But we've already
had some really,

00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:30.420
really amazing folks
provide narrations.

00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:34.400
And I'll again pass it back
to Jen to tell you about that.

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:36.570
JENNIFER HOLLAND: Does
anyone recognize the voice?

00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:40.740
I heard Hamilton.

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:44.160
It was Lin-Manuel Miranda,
who is the American actor

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:45.180
and playwright.

00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:48.232
He wrote Hamilton,
also starred in it.

00:13:48.232 --> 00:13:50.190
And so some of the new
tours that will actually

00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:53.610
be coming out as
part of Solo Mode

00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:56.227
will be a couple
of Hamilton tours.

00:13:56.227 --> 00:13:58.560
And it will be about Hamilton's
life and the place where

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:00.660
he dueled with Burr.

00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:03.240
And just for the record,
these Expeditions

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:08.490
won't actually save you any
money on a Broadway ticket.

00:14:08.490 --> 00:14:11.510
And we've also partnered
with Major League Baseball.

00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:15.340
And so we've created five
new narrated tours with them.

00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:17.100
And so you can step
up to home plate

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:19.410
at Camden Yards or Citi Fields.

00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:22.560
You can learn more
about MLB Statcast,

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:25.350
and you can learn about the
career of a baseball beat

00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:26.580
reporter.

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:29.550
And all of these new
Expeditions will also

00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:33.220
be available to schools
through the live guided mode.

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:34.860
And we've also had
several teachers

00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:37.872
who've already created
lessons to correspond

00:14:37.872 --> 00:14:40.080
with these specific Expeditions,
which make it really

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:41.460
easy for them to incorporate.

00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:44.830
And those are also on Tes.

00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:47.910
So Solo Mode will
work on Cardboard,

00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:51.360
and it will work
on Android and iOS.

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:53.790
And we're also really
excited that Expeditions

00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:56.490
will be coming soon
to Daydream devices,

00:14:56.490 --> 00:15:00.090
so that you can explore
Expeditions on your own

00:15:00.090 --> 00:15:01.750
or with a live guide.

00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:09.910
BEN SCHROM: We are doing demos
of Solo Mode in the Daydream

00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:13.140
tent just right next door, so
go check it out in the Sandbox.

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:16.840
So VR is amazing at making
you feel like you're somewhere

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:18.934
else, like you've been
transported to a new place.

00:15:18.934 --> 00:15:21.100
But we've also heard from
many students and teachers

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:23.410
that they want to interact
more with things or objects

00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:25.700
that you might find
in those places.

00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:27.400
It was actually one
of the first things

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:30.352
that struck us when
watching Expeditions VR used

00:15:30.352 --> 00:15:31.060
in the classroom.

00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:33.880
It was sort of the fact
that things in VR scenes

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:35.415
had a physical placement.

00:15:35.415 --> 00:15:36.790
And that actually
changed the way

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:38.980
that students recalled
and talked about them.

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:42.240
Like a student that would see
an Expedition about a shark,

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:44.350
they'd actually point to
the place in the scene

00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:45.760
where they saw that shark.

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:47.910
It became fixed in
their spatial memory,

00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:51.820
not in this sort of
textbook on a desk.

00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:54.480
And there may very well be
something else going on here.

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:56.980
There's this idea that's really
popular in cognitive science

00:15:56.980 --> 00:15:59.470
circles right now called
embodied cognition.

00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:01.630
And basically that
theory is that our bodies

00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:03.880
play a much bigger
role in how we think,

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:09.066
learn, and remember than we've
generally thought in the past.

00:16:09.066 --> 00:16:11.440
So the theory is that when we
move around and look around

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:13.830
and see things
presented in AR or VR,

00:16:13.830 --> 00:16:16.300
that can tap into some
very powerful capabilities

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:18.430
of our bodies plus our minds.

00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:25.250
So Tango is the technology that
allows us to do that with AR.

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:28.280
And we've combined the live,
social, teacher-curated

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:30.860
capabilities of
Google Expeditions

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:34.310
with the power of Tango
to augment the environment

00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:38.060
with virtual objects
and animations.

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:40.550
Tango uses sophisticated
computer vision combined

00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:42.620
with some simple
sensors and a smartphone

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:44.995
very much like the ones that
you all have in your pockets

00:16:44.995 --> 00:16:48.800
right now to sense the depth and
dimensions of the environment

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:51.790
that you hold that phone up to.

00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:53.540
So what does this sort
of mean in practice

00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:54.980
in terms of how a
teacher would do it?

00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:56.660
Well, it makes it
possible for a teacher

00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:58.667
to sort of digitally
map their classroom

00:16:58.667 --> 00:17:00.500
and place digital objects
in them as if they

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:02.510
existed in that space for real.

00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:05.569
And because Tango creates that
canonical sort of digital map,

00:17:05.569 --> 00:17:08.960
the objects placed in this space
are persistent across sessions,

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:10.579
can be shared with
other devices,

00:17:10.579 --> 00:17:12.109
and allow for
students and teachers

00:17:12.109 --> 00:17:15.589
to share a common view of that.

00:17:15.589 --> 00:17:17.359
And that's one of
the key things that

00:17:17.359 --> 00:17:20.000
makes Tango a unique and
really, really powerful thing

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.470
in the classroom.

00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:23.329
AR isn't new in the classroom.

00:17:23.329 --> 00:17:26.150
There's lots of actually really
awesome learning applications

00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:28.670
that use device
cameras on a tablet

00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:31.130
to do pass through in order
to show digital objects.

00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:34.840
But those cameras see the world
as a flat, 2D environment,

00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:37.544
and they can't create that sort
of shared social experience

00:17:37.544 --> 00:17:38.960
where a classroom
can collectively

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:41.360
stand in front of an object
and talk about it like it

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:42.980
was right there in the room.

00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:45.260
And we've also given
teachers similar controls

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:48.350
that they have to those
in Exhibitions VR,

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:51.050
allowing them to point
things out, change the object

00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:54.520
and control the
pace of the class.

00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:57.110
And it's been really fun
to sort of grant teachers

00:17:57.110 --> 00:18:00.380
this new superpower
to magically go deeper

00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:02.450
into any subject
in the classroom.

00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:04.970
And instead of, or maybe
more importantly in addition

00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:08.360
to the traditional
content used in schools,

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:11.780
AR can place inaccessible things
right in front of the student.

00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:15.350
So we've seen it
encourage more curiosity,

00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:18.560
engender more questions and
conversation among teachers

00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:20.510
and students, and
we think it can

00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:23.030
serve is a really, really
powerful complement

00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:25.190
to VR experiences as well.

00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:27.170
VR takes you like
anywhere in the world,

00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:30.747
and AR brings anything
in the world to you.

00:18:30.747 --> 00:18:33.330
So let's take a look at how AR
is being used in the classroom.

00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:34.610
Let's just watch
this quick video.

00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:36.720
Same one we showed at the
keynote, but we love it.

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:37.590
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:38.090
- All right.

00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:40.170
Who wants to see a volcano?

00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:43.723
3, 2, 1.

00:18:43.723 --> 00:18:44.223
- Wow.

00:18:46.747 --> 00:18:47.580
- Look at that lava.

00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:49.920
Look at that smoke
coming out of that.

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:54.014
- Pretend you're an airplane
and fly over the tornado.

00:18:54.014 --> 00:18:54.972
- That's the top of it.

00:18:54.972 --> 00:18:56.130
- What do you see?

00:18:56.130 --> 00:18:58.700
- These are
asteroids, meteorites.

00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:01.350
- We're learning about
DNA and genes, things

00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:02.710
that we can't see.

00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:06.540
And so the most exciting thing
for me with the AR technology

00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:12.000
was that I could see kids get an
aha moment that I couldn't get

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.360
by just telling them about it.

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:15.310
- The minute I saw it
pop up on the screen,

00:19:15.310 --> 00:19:17.140
it made me want to
get up and walk to it.

00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:19.640
- You get to turn around and
look at things from all angles,

00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:21.979
so it gives us a
nice perspective.

00:19:21.979 --> 00:19:23.520
- See if you can
figure out what that

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:26.640
might be based on what you know
about the respiratory system.

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:29.120
- I got to see where the
alveoli branched off,

00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:32.555
and I could look inside them
and see how everything worked,

00:19:32.555 --> 00:19:33.885
which I never saw before.

00:19:33.885 --> 00:19:35.959
And it was really, really cool.

00:19:35.959 --> 00:19:45.440
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:47.659
[END PLAYBACK]

00:19:47.659 --> 00:19:49.450
JENNIFER HOLLAND: So
that video is actually

00:19:49.450 --> 00:19:51.890
from a couple of
our pilot schools

00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:54.560
that have been using
AR in their classroom.

00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:56.560
And we've been piloting
with a number of schools

00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:57.730
all over the world.

00:19:57.730 --> 00:20:01.060
The feedback has been
incredibly positive,

00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:03.610
and we've learned a
great deal and really

00:20:03.610 --> 00:20:08.100
seen some amazing, creative ways
that teachers have incorporated

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:09.890
AR into the classroom.

00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:13.210
Similarly, how we saw
Expeditions VR incorporated

00:20:13.210 --> 00:20:16.250
into the classroom.

00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:19.990
And so here's just one example
from our pilot, which I just

00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:20.560
love.

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:25.390
How many of you remember
taking a math field trip?

00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:26.540
Oh we have one, two.

00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:27.040
OK.

00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:27.910
You took a math--

00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:31.870
most of us don't get to go
on field trips in math class.

00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:35.110
And yet, learning about
math in the context

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:38.990
of the actual real world
is really powerful.

00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:42.100
And so that's what we actually
saw with a middle school class

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:46.610
in New York who
used Expeditions AR.

00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:49.780
We worked with the teacher to
create this mini golf lesson

00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:54.670
to calculate how golf balls
form different angles as they

00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:56.300
hit the obstacle.

00:20:56.300 --> 00:21:00.400
So throughout the room was
this amazing mini golf course

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:01.880
in the classroom.

00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:04.270
And the students could see
the different holes and how

00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:07.120
the different angles
changed when the ball hit

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:10.650
specific obstacles.

00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:13.230
And just like we did
with Expeditions VR,

00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:15.780
we'll be bringing
Expeditions AR to schools

00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:18.000
this fall through
the Pioneer Program.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.680
We want to give
teachers the ability

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:23.430
to see how this technology
can be interactive, engaging,

00:21:23.430 --> 00:21:25.470
and fun with their students.

00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:27.450
And so if any teachers
are interested,

00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:29.340
they can sign up
right on our form,

00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:33.070
and we'll be in touch with
more information soon.

00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:37.110
And you can also check out the
demos in our Sandbox as well.

00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:39.960
But if you're a developer
who's really excited about AR

00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:42.810
and wants to work with
us to build AR lessons,

00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:45.750
please express interest
on our partner page.

00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:47.970
We've worked with so
many different partners

00:21:47.970 --> 00:21:50.010
to build Expeditions
VR, and we want

00:21:50.010 --> 00:21:52.290
to do the same with
Expeditions AR.

00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:54.420
So definitely sign up.

00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:55.920
And now I'd like
to turn things over

00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:58.128
to Brandon, who's going to
talk to you about building

00:21:58.128 --> 00:22:00.665
your own VR and AR experiences.

00:22:00.665 --> 00:22:01.790
BRANDON WUEST: Thanks, Jen.

00:22:05.441 --> 00:22:05.940
All right.

00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:08.030
So as Ben and Jen have
really highlighted,

00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:10.730
we have seen huge
success with Expeditions

00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:13.370
as an educational product
through its use of VR

00:22:13.370 --> 00:22:15.200
to enable immersive learning.

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:19.130
Additionally, our early efforts
to bring AR to the classroom

00:22:19.130 --> 00:22:20.930
have shown a lot of promise.

00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:23.990
However, isn't enough for us
to be building these AR and VR

00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:25.200
products alone at Google.

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:27.800
We really need developers
to be focused on education

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:30.830
as well to help
grow the ecosystem.

00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:33.200
But why do I want this
ecosystem to grow?

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:35.610
Well, I think it's the right
thing to do for the kids.

00:22:35.610 --> 00:22:38.210
I mean, as a father myself
of three young children,

00:22:38.210 --> 00:22:40.730
I want to see
education transform,

00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:43.610
to become richer
and more engaging

00:22:43.610 --> 00:22:45.710
for future generations.

00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:48.510
I've already started to notice
that with my own children,

00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:51.320
I notice that they learn better
if they can actually interact

00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:54.830
with something, whether it's my
son building a leprechaun trap

00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:58.160
or my daughter crafting
a tower with a 3D pen,

00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:01.110
or my youngest child
chewing on a sock.

00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:03.530
Maybe not so much the
sock, but hopefully you

00:23:03.530 --> 00:23:05.420
see where I'm going.

00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:09.770
But it's important to
note that AR and VR

00:23:09.770 --> 00:23:12.890
educational experiences
aren't just relevant inside

00:23:12.890 --> 00:23:15.020
of the classroom.

00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:17.000
There's actually also
an enormous potential

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.346
for their use in professional
education as well.

00:23:19.346 --> 00:23:20.720
So I think this
story is actually

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:23.670
a really good example of this,
and it's really interesting.

00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:25.190
So what this story
is talking about,

00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:27.530
it's talking about how a
utility company has started

00:23:27.530 --> 00:23:30.320
using an immersive group
experience to give people

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:33.800
exposure to what it might be
like to work in a local sewer

00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:35.609
system.

00:23:35.609 --> 00:23:37.400
Though after reading
this, this is actually

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:39.860
one instance that I'm glad that
we have not cracked virtual

00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:40.400
smells yet.

00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:45.830
So what I want to do
now is to give you

00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:48.170
a really quick overview of
some of the tools available

00:23:48.170 --> 00:23:53.250
that can allow you to build
your own AR and VR experiences.

00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:56.150
So first off, I want to talk
about Expeditions and its two

00:23:56.150 --> 00:23:58.880
fundamental features.

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:01.550
First, Expeditions is immersive.

00:24:01.550 --> 00:24:04.391
We use 360 imagery to surround
the students and the subject

00:24:04.391 --> 00:24:04.890
matter.

00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:10.920
Second, it provides a
co-located guided experience

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:13.830
that allows teachers
to control and augment

00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:15.807
the experiences they
deem appropriate.

00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:20.410
So first, let's talk
about the easiest way

00:24:20.410 --> 00:24:23.230
to get 360 imagery into
your own application that

00:24:23.230 --> 00:24:25.660
can be viewable in
Cardboard or Daydream

00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:27.270
or even outside of a VR viewer.

00:24:27.270 --> 00:24:29.770
First, you need to start with
something like the RICOH THETA

00:24:29.770 --> 00:24:32.320
camera or Cardboard camera
that works on Android and iOS

00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:34.810
to capture your imagery.

00:24:34.810 --> 00:24:37.580
Once you have your
360 content available,

00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:40.000
one of the easiest
ways to actually make

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.590
this viewable in
your application

00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:43.930
is to use something
called VR view.

00:24:43.930 --> 00:24:45.730
Now, VR view is a
drop-in component

00:24:45.730 --> 00:24:48.880
for viewing 360
photos and video.

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:50.980
And let me walk you through
a quick sample on how

00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:52.990
to do this on Android,
but be aware this is also

00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:55.410
available on iOS
and the web as well.

00:24:58.190 --> 00:25:01.690
So step one is to add the VR
view dependency to your gradle

00:25:01.690 --> 00:25:05.750
build file if
you're using gradle.

00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:08.750
Next step is to actually
add the VR panorama view

00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:09.480
to your layout.

00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:16.210
And then finally, you simply
take your VR panorama view

00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:19.970
and you use that to load
and display your image.

00:25:19.970 --> 00:25:24.910
And almost like magic, it's now
viewable in your application.

00:25:24.910 --> 00:25:28.396
And it not only is viewable
in your application in VR,

00:25:28.396 --> 00:25:29.770
you can also view
it in something

00:25:29.770 --> 00:25:31.240
that we call Magic
Window mode that

00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:33.085
allows you to view it
outside of a viewer

00:25:33.085 --> 00:25:34.210
and move your phone around.

00:25:34.210 --> 00:25:36.772
Now I realize that I'm going
over this very, very quickly,

00:25:36.772 --> 00:25:38.980
but I'm just trying to give
everyone a quick overview

00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:42.220
of all these tools.

00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:47.560
So next up, how can you enable
a co-located guided experience?

00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:49.180
It's actually really
straightforward

00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:50.680
with the Nearby API.

00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:53.320
Let me quickly walk you through
on how to do it on Android,

00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:55.030
but this is available
on iOS as well.

00:25:57.650 --> 00:26:01.940
First up for writing the Nearby
API is, just as with VR viewer,

00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:07.430
is you add the dependency
to your gradle build file.

00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:08.930
Then what you want
to do is you want

00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:10.209
to create a message listener.

00:26:10.209 --> 00:26:11.750
And now this message
listener is what

00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:15.050
you use to actually receive
and process your messages.

00:26:15.050 --> 00:26:16.867
So you create your
message listener--

00:26:20.210 --> 00:26:22.560
create your message listener--

00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:24.570
and then once you
have that listener,

00:26:24.570 --> 00:26:27.180
then you subscribe that
against the Nearby API.

00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:28.510
Pretty simple.

00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:30.510
Now once you actually
have your application that

00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:33.540
can listen to and receive
and process your messages,

00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:35.580
then you can have your
application actually

00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:37.215
publish these messages
out to clients.

00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:42.837
Now, again, I went over
this pretty quickly,

00:26:42.837 --> 00:26:44.420
but if you want to
learn more about VR

00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:46.642
view or the Nearby API,
here a couple of resources

00:26:46.642 --> 00:26:47.600
that you can check out.

00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:54.260
360 photos are great.

00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:56.540
They are simple and
easy to add to your app,

00:26:56.540 --> 00:26:58.370
but they're frankly
pretty limiting

00:26:58.370 --> 00:27:01.310
because they restrict you to
a certain type of content.

00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:03.470
As you start to
prepare experiences,

00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:05.210
say for our upcoming
standalone headset

00:27:05.210 --> 00:27:07.050
that we announced in
the keynote yesterday,

00:27:07.050 --> 00:27:10.370
you're going to want something
that's more flexible and more

00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:10.954
powerful.

00:27:10.954 --> 00:27:12.620
So what are your
options around building

00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:16.430
more advanced experiences
without getting your hands

00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:20.630
dirty with OpenGL or similar?

00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:22.370
Enter WebVR.

00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:26.080
Google has been a strong force
behind the WebVR standard,

00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:29.750
and today it is fully supported
in Chrome for Android, Firefox,

00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:31.910
Oculus, and Samsung browsers.

00:27:31.910 --> 00:27:35.420
That's all great, but what about
building your own experiences

00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:39.110
that use web technologies?

00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:40.920
What I want to talk
about is A-Frame.

00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:43.430
A-Frame is a web framework
for building virtual reality

00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:44.930
experiences.

00:27:44.930 --> 00:27:46.640
Now this actually
isn't a Google product,

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:49.160
but I want to talk about it
because it's one of the easiest

00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:51.830
ways that I've personally found
to build VR experiences that

00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:54.690
target the web.

00:27:54.690 --> 00:27:56.910
So for instance, let's take
a look at the 360 photo

00:27:56.910 --> 00:28:00.320
I showed you earlier
in the VR view example,

00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:03.264
and let's say we wanted to add
a 2D image overlay on top of it.

00:28:03.264 --> 00:28:05.430
This is actually something
that's pretty non-trivial

00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:06.330
to do with VR view.

00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:11.310
What you can see
here in the sample--

00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:14.640
and this is actually a complete
sample on how to do this--

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:19.410
it's very easy to add
our 360 photo and then

00:28:19.410 --> 00:28:25.170
our 2D image overlay and a
very concise amount of HTML.

00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:27.390
And this should also look
very syntactically familiar

00:28:27.390 --> 00:28:31.940
for those of you with web
development experience.

00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:36.640
And then here is this example
running in Chrome for Android.

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:37.140
Amazing.

00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:42.270
Now I'm going to try to
talk about a slightly more

00:28:42.270 --> 00:28:43.900
complex example.

00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:46.410
Now, when I was in
school, I struggled a lot

00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:48.930
with the concept of
imaginary numbers.

00:28:48.930 --> 00:28:51.597
I mean, for one, the name
is ridiculous, right?

00:28:51.597 --> 00:28:52.680
They're imaginary numbers.

00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:55.170
They're not even real.

00:28:55.170 --> 00:28:57.900
But besides the fact
I think that the name

00:28:57.900 --> 00:29:00.630
choice of imaginary
numbers is really poor,

00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:03.780
I remember the concept
to be really intimidating

00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:06.531
because it wasn't grounded
in anything tangible.

00:29:06.531 --> 00:29:08.280
To help illustrate
what I mean, let's take

00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:11.350
a look at this parabola,
x squared plus 1.

00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:13.110
Now the fundamental
theorem of algebra

00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:14.550
actually states
that there should

00:29:14.550 --> 00:29:17.130
be a value for x that
causes this parabola

00:29:17.130 --> 00:29:20.260
to cross the x-axis, but
we aren't seeing that here.

00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:23.384
So what are we missing?

00:29:23.384 --> 00:29:24.800
Well, the trick
here is that there

00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:28.970
is a value for x that causes a
parabola to cross the x-axis,

00:29:28.970 --> 00:29:30.935
but it requires us to
use imaginary numbers.

00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:36.760
And one of the reasons
this example of applying

00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:39.700
imaginary numbers
seems so inaccessible

00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:41.339
is because educators
have largely

00:29:41.339 --> 00:29:43.630
been limited to conveying
information like this on a 2D

00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:46.070
plane, like a piece of paper.

00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:47.980
But just as we represent
positive numbers

00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:52.180
on the number line in one
direction and negative numbers

00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:55.240
in the other direction,
we can actually

00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:58.930
think of imaginary numbers
as just another dimension.

00:29:58.930 --> 00:30:02.130
When we represent our
parabola in 3D space,

00:30:02.130 --> 00:30:03.670
our applied use of
imaginary numbers

00:30:03.670 --> 00:30:04.840
seems a lot more obvious.

00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:07.300
You can clearly see that
our parabola intersects

00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:08.650
with the x-axis, right?

00:30:08.650 --> 00:30:10.370
It's obvious.

00:30:10.370 --> 00:30:12.370
Well actually, it's
probably not obvious to you.

00:30:12.370 --> 00:30:14.320
And if you're feeling
completely lost, great.

00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:15.280
That's my point.

00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:18.490
I'm trying to explain all
this using traditional 2D

00:30:18.490 --> 00:30:19.480
presentation tools.

00:30:22.210 --> 00:30:26.380
Now imagine if you could enable
students to explore concepts

00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:28.480
like imaginary numbers in VR.

00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:30.790
What's amazing here is
that someone has actually

00:30:30.790 --> 00:30:33.310
already built a graphing
calculator application called

00:30:33.310 --> 00:30:36.340
MathWorld VR using A-Frame.

00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:38.680
Also, not only is this
tool available today,

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:40.460
but it's completely open source.

00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:43.180
So if you want to take a look
at a more advanced example

00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:45.640
of using A-Frame
or targeting WebVR,

00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:48.340
this is a great place to start.

00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:51.100
And if you want to learn more
about A-Frame or MathWorld VR,

00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:52.350
you can check out these links.

00:30:55.345 --> 00:30:57.220
So everything I've shown
you up to this point

00:30:57.220 --> 00:31:01.510
has only enabled VR, and I
haven't talked about AR at all.

00:31:01.510 --> 00:31:04.480
Google is pushing toward
a web AR standard.

00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:06.790
But today, one of the
best tools for building

00:31:06.790 --> 00:31:09.940
AR experiences such as
our Expeditions AR app

00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:12.390
that you can see in
the Sandbox next door,

00:31:12.390 --> 00:31:13.840
is with something called Unity.

00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:16.930
Now if you've been building
3D games or VR content,

00:31:16.930 --> 00:31:19.840
it's very likely
you've heard of Unity.

00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:22.600
If you're new to this space,
there's a good chance maybe

00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:25.141
you aren't familiar with Unity
or haven't heard of it at all.

00:31:25.141 --> 00:31:25.840
And that's OK.

00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:29.560
Unity has been historically very
popular for building mobile 3D

00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:34.690
games, but the same features
that have empowered developers

00:31:34.690 --> 00:31:36.640
to create amazing
games actually also

00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:39.910
apply really well to AR and VR.

00:31:39.910 --> 00:31:42.370
So this is why we build
Expeditions AR using Unity.

00:31:42.370 --> 00:31:45.670
Because, one, it provides
really robust support

00:31:45.670 --> 00:31:48.490
for importing and
manipulating 3D objects.

00:31:48.490 --> 00:31:50.140
It provides a
multiplayer API that

00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:52.300
works with peer-to-peer
connections, which

00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:55.449
is conducive to our traditional
co-located student-teacher

00:31:55.449 --> 00:31:57.490
classroom set up where an
internet connection may

00:31:57.490 --> 00:31:58.960
be unavailable.

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:02.320
And most importantly, it
provides simple integration

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:03.310
with Tango.

00:32:03.310 --> 00:32:06.160
And Tango is at the core
of Google's AR tracking

00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:07.470
capabilities.

00:32:07.470 --> 00:32:09.770
Now to provide slightly
more depth on this topic--

00:32:09.770 --> 00:32:11.270
and if you've been
paying attention,

00:32:11.270 --> 00:32:14.110
you might realize that's
a pun, though a bad one--

00:32:14.110 --> 00:32:16.260
let's talk about the three
key features of Tango.

00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:20.690
So first, Tango provides
our position in 3D space.

00:32:20.690 --> 00:32:22.660
So we know where our
device is looking

00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:23.740
and where it is located.

00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:27.520
And this is what allows
students to walk around the room

00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:32.170
and see objects from different
perspectives and distances.

00:32:32.170 --> 00:32:35.090
It also provides
surface detection.

00:32:39.810 --> 00:32:42.260
So we know a floor is a
floor and a desk is a desk.

00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:44.060
And this is what allows
us to place objects

00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:49.940
relative to our physical
space and allow teachers

00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:52.160
to place objects on
tables just as they would

00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:55.370
traditional classroom materials.

00:32:55.370 --> 00:32:57.260
And then, finally,
Tango does all of this

00:32:57.260 --> 00:32:58.940
by giving us a
global understanding

00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:00.750
of our position in space.

00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:02.780
So when we leave the
classroom and come back,

00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:03.680
the objects remain.

00:33:06.816 --> 00:33:08.740
Now if you want to
learn more about Unity

00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:11.554
for Daydream or Cardboard
or Tango integration,

00:33:11.554 --> 00:33:12.970
you can check out
these resources.

00:33:12.970 --> 00:33:15.551
I realize I went
over this very fast,

00:33:15.551 --> 00:33:17.050
but hopefully they
gave you somewhat

00:33:17.050 --> 00:33:18.520
of a broad understanding
of some of the tools

00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:21.010
available that will allow you
to build your own AR and VR

00:33:21.010 --> 00:33:21.980
experiences.

00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:22.480
All right.

00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:24.214
Let me hand you back to Ben.

00:33:24.214 --> 00:33:25.380
BEN SCHROM: Thanks, Brandon.

00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:31.970
Why are we so excited
to have you guys build

00:33:31.970 --> 00:33:34.660
AR and VR learning
experiences, and why do we

00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:37.450
think it's like almost
an urgent thing?

00:33:37.450 --> 00:33:40.690
So sort of perfectly
encapsulated in this quote

00:33:40.690 --> 00:33:43.135
from one of my heroes,
Seymour Papert.

00:33:43.135 --> 00:33:44.510
Does anybody know
Seymour Papert?

00:33:47.050 --> 00:33:49.560
We should all try harder
to learn like children

00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:52.630
is basically the point here.

00:33:52.630 --> 00:33:54.374
Papert had such an
influence for us,

00:33:54.374 --> 00:33:56.290
though, because he was
one of the first people

00:33:56.290 --> 00:33:59.260
to see computers not as these
things that have generally

00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:01.080
characterized people's
understanding--

00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:03.190
these big information
stores that

00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:04.940
are good at doing
repetitive tasks,

00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:08.560
sort of like the logical
extension of an encyclopedia.

00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:10.420
But he saw them as
these things that

00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:12.670
could be harnessed by
people to create things,

00:34:12.670 --> 00:34:15.580
to learn by doing,
by making new things

00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:19.610
by being able to actively
try and fail and try again.

00:34:19.610 --> 00:34:21.550
But here's the great irony.

00:34:21.550 --> 00:34:23.739
In the last 30 or so
years since Papert

00:34:23.739 --> 00:34:26.620
began to compel us to
rethink how to use technology

00:34:26.620 --> 00:34:29.020
to support human learning,
what we've actually seen

00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:32.230
is we've made much more progress
teaching computers how to learn

00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:34.284
than we have with people.

00:34:34.284 --> 00:34:35.784
So I'll give you
an example of this.

00:34:35.784 --> 00:34:38.139
Do people remember Deep Blue?

00:34:38.139 --> 00:34:39.949
Do people remember
Joel Benjamin?

00:34:39.949 --> 00:34:41.949
Does anyone remember
Joel Benjamin?

00:34:41.949 --> 00:34:43.820
Joel Benjamin was
the chess grandmaster

00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:46.179
that the Deep Blue
team worked with at IBM

00:34:46.179 --> 00:34:48.429
to actually encode Deep
Blue's game strategy.

00:34:48.429 --> 00:34:50.739
They basically extracted
as many if/then statements

00:34:50.739 --> 00:34:53.350
as they could from
Joel Benjamin's mind,

00:34:53.350 --> 00:34:55.179
and they created this
powerful computer

00:34:55.179 --> 00:34:58.080
that could do what Joel Benjamin
could do, just do it faster.

00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:02.080
And it was an amazing
achievement for AI at the time.

00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:04.980
But then last year, just
22 years later, there

00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:08.350
was AlphaGo, the computer that
defeated one of the world's

00:35:08.350 --> 00:35:10.370
great Go players.

00:35:10.370 --> 00:35:13.060
But this wasn't done by coding
a computer with like everything

00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:15.650
a human knows about
the game's strategy.

00:35:15.650 --> 00:35:17.740
This was done by
programming a computer

00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:20.260
to learn about how to
learn about what a good Go

00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:21.860
strategy might be.

00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:24.220
So instead of one really
smart Joel Benjamin,

00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:27.430
you basically have this ignorant
crowd of really good learners

00:35:27.430 --> 00:35:30.560
who just played Go all the time.

00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:32.740
And to put that in some
context, the difference

00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:34.870
between the number
of moves in chess

00:35:34.870 --> 00:35:37.420
and the number of moves
in Go is the difference

00:35:37.420 --> 00:35:39.730
between the number
of atoms in your body

00:35:39.730 --> 00:35:42.160
and the number of
atoms in the universe.

00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:45.850
And that in like 20 years.

00:35:45.850 --> 00:35:48.550
So what happened that allowed
for such dramatic progress

00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:49.900
in such a short time?

00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:54.370
How is that milestone of
artificial intelligence that

00:35:54.370 --> 00:35:57.010
was achieved just 20 years
ago sort of cute in comparison

00:35:57.010 --> 00:35:58.720
to what we can do today?

00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:00.550
Well, it turns out
that programming

00:36:00.550 --> 00:36:02.500
a computer to be
smart is actually

00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:07.840
much harder than programming
it to learn to be smart.

00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:09.730
Put another way,
artificial intelligence

00:36:09.730 --> 00:36:11.350
grew into machine learning.

00:36:11.350 --> 00:36:14.569
So instead of jamming computers
full of if/then statements,

00:36:14.569 --> 00:36:16.360
we give them the ability
and some structure

00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:19.360
to observe success or
progress, let them try and fail

00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:20.710
and try again.

00:36:20.710 --> 00:36:23.440
We gave them the same gift
of learning that we're all

00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:24.910
born with as children--

00:36:24.910 --> 00:36:27.250
the same gift that leads
Brandon's youngest kid

00:36:27.250 --> 00:36:30.370
to eat his sock.

00:36:30.370 --> 00:36:31.970
So what do I take
away from this?

00:36:31.970 --> 00:36:34.990
So much of traditional education
and its accompanying technology

00:36:34.990 --> 00:36:37.660
tries to give kids
that old notion

00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:38.999
of artificial intelligence.

00:36:38.999 --> 00:36:40.540
Think about all of
the facts you were

00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:43.210
asked to memorize, all the
standardized bubble tests

00:36:43.210 --> 00:36:46.480
you took, all the times the
solution was presented to you

00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:50.240
as choosing the right
if/then statement.

00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:53.740
So if it took giving
computers the technology

00:36:53.740 --> 00:36:57.272
to experientially learn at
scale to make them capable

00:36:57.272 --> 00:36:59.230
of tackling these
cosmically-hard problems like

00:36:59.230 --> 00:37:02.200
Go, then I think it should make
us realize that the technology

00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:05.320
we need to be giving humans
to help them learn needs to be

00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:08.610
focused on helping them
learn by experiencing--

00:37:08.610 --> 00:37:13.660
by having agency, not just by
giving them a bunch of facts.

00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:16.540
And that's exactly
why the emergence

00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:19.300
of widely available and
powerful, immersive computing

00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:24.830
like VR and AR is such
an exciting opportunity.

00:37:24.830 --> 00:37:28.130
It can enable the right kind
of learning moments at scale,

00:37:28.130 --> 00:37:31.040
provide people trying to learn
something with experiences,

00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:34.070
with curiosity, with
wonder, with trial and error

00:37:34.070 --> 00:37:36.020
that can be arrived
at quickly and safely.

00:37:39.250 --> 00:37:40.940
And they can inspire kids.

00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:42.850
And that's a much
more powerful force

00:37:42.850 --> 00:37:46.520
than any educational technology
that we could actually create.

00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:49.360
So if we-- and that
includes all of you--

00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:51.190
if we get this right,
we have a chance

00:37:51.190 --> 00:37:53.680
to give the same gift
that we spent the last 20

00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:58.330
years giving to rack-mounted
servers to our own students.

00:37:58.330 --> 00:38:00.940
So that's why we're really
excited to see what we all do.

00:38:00.940 --> 00:38:03.400
So thanks very much.

00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:09.750
