YO YO MA &gt;&gt; Hello, YouTube. I'm Yo yo Ma,
and so my answer is work hard and be loving.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:11.820
And by that I mean-ah-be empathetic to people,
be nice to people, practice empathy.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:18.090
Um-how do you do that? Well, I think you actually
have to be able to be able to have the imagination

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:33.620
to be in someone else's shoes. So, you know,
just walk around and say, "So-and-so, what's

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:39.050
their life like?"
And-ah-and-and you have to do that without

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.399
pre-judgment. You actually have to be there
and not say, "Oh, well that's a horrible way

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:51.629
to be!" No, you actually have to be them from
inside looking at the world from their point

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.050
of view.
And I think that's-that's actually a harder

00:00:53.050 --> 00:01:00.159
thing to do than-um-than__.
Anyway, I think-um-enjoy! Bye.
