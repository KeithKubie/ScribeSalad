for many years what message do you think

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570
for many years what message do you think
 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.400

time and I think the many people tried
 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.619

very hard to cure the cancer but
 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:58.180

the principal and this is really working

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680
the principal and this is really working
 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.070

go in research because you didn't set
 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:49.480

out to discover oh no well it's such a

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490
out to discover oh no well it's such a
 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.210
out to discover oh no well it's such a
complex system it's totally different

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220
complex system it's totally different
 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.289

from the engineering we cannot design

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299

many people try to find the therapy for

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210
many people try to find the therapy for
 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.780
many people try to find the therapy for
cancer but all failed and myself I never

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790
cancer but all failed and myself I never
 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.389
cancer but all failed and myself I never
expected my research working on immunity

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399
expected my research working on immunity
 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.009
expected my research working on immunity
them will lead to the cancer therapy but

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:15.019
them will lead to the cancer therapy but
 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:19.690
them will lead to the cancer therapy but
so in a sense I'm very fortunate but I

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700
so in a sense I'm very fortunate but I
 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.319
so in a sense I'm very fortunate but I
also thought about it so you know you

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:23.329
also thought about it so you know you
 

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:25.929
also thought about it so you know you
have to try many things and if you're

00:02:25.929 --> 00:02:25.939
have to try many things and if you're
 

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:28.509
have to try many things and if you're
lucky you can hit anybody you have to

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519
lucky you can hit anybody you have to
 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:33.910
lucky you can hit anybody you have to
pursue that's my area and what is your

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920
pursue that's my area and what is your
 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.410
pursue that's my area and what is your
hope for the future of immune checkpoint

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420
hope for the future of immune checkpoint
 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.330

inhibitors well there are still several

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340
inhibitors well there are still several
 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:46.080
inhibitors well there are still several
problems but two most important one is

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090
problems but two most important one is
 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:53.319
problems but two most important one is
still only 30% of patients responding so

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:53.329
still only 30% of patients responding so
 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:56.440
still only 30% of patients responding so
we wish to have some biomarkers to

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450
we wish to have some biomarkers to
 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.460
we wish to have some biomarkers to
predict whether he or she is responsive

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470
predict whether he or she is responsive
 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:01.559
predict whether he or she is responsive
or not

00:03:01.559 --> 00:03:01.569
or not
 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:04.300
or not
secondary different we wish to improve

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310
secondary different we wish to improve
 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.020
secondary different we wish to improve
the efficacy of this treatment and

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030
the efficacy of this treatment and
 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.129
the efficacy of this treatment and
actually this is a target of many many

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:11.139
actually this is a target of many many
 

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:14.490
actually this is a target of many many
scientists in the company so I believe

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500
scientists in the company so I believe
 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.840
scientists in the company so I believe
these two problem will be solved in

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850
these two problem will be solved in
 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.069
these two problem will be solved in
