00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.640
(light music)

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:03.930
- In my classroom, I always
ask them, who are you.

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:06.870
They know to respond, "I am
the leader of the world."

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.614
And it's true, they are the future.

00:00:08.614 --> 00:00:11.870
(light music)

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.590
The importance of
teachers is unquantifiable

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:18.300
for this excess of students
because we do not just teach,

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.906
but we really care about our students.

00:00:20.906 --> 00:00:23.620
(light music)

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:26.092
We're also their mentors,
we're also their friends.

00:00:26.092 --> 00:00:28.592
(light music)

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:31.770
Every teacher uses different tools

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:33.560
to be an effective teacher.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:35.390
One of those tools that I choose to use

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.260
because I believe the curriculum,

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.100
the rigor in it is Khan Academy.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.050
So, it gives me immediate feedback

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.400
of okay, this person understands,
or this person doesn't.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.460
Every student, every child, every life

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.050
has a possibility to create something.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.670
Everyone deserves access
to free, quality education.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.233
Then we can really see the
power of education blossom.
