00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.580
us, Steve.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:23.620
[applause]

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.890
&gt;&gt;Steve Kamb: Thanks Chad for that. Can everyone
hear me OK?

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:27.890
&gt;&gt;FEMALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: Yeah.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.040
&gt;&gt;Steve Kamb: All right. Great. First of all,
guys, I just wanna start by saying thank you

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.860
so much for having me. Google is one of those
companies that you always hear about, but

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.880
you don't--. You always wonder what goes on
there.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.860
So, for me today, it feels like Charlie and
The Chocolate Factory, getting to see everything

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.201
happening around the world--.

00:01:44.201 --> 00:01:45.370
[clears throat]

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:52.550
Excuse me. Getting to see how this place actually
runs. So, I'm sure many of you are wondering

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:59.030
who I am what the heck I'm doing here. So
let's get started. This is a picture of me

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.282
as Superman, back when--I wanna say--maybe
when I was four, maybe five. To be honest

00:02:03.282 --> 00:02:04.460
with you, I don't actually know the date.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.229
Generally, you could say, "Oh, that's Halloween
of October 2005," or I'm sorry, Halloween

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:14.110
when I was five or Halloween when I was four.
But that could've been me on a Tuesday. I

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.340
just happened to like dressing up like Superman
as often as possible, because I really wanted

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:24.660
to be the Man of Steel. I was just fascinated
with the whole concept of being strong and

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.120
super-fast and lightening quick and all these
things.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.560
Unfortunately, my genetics did not really
line up with being Superman. So, I'd always

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:41.250
been that scrawny, weak, I don't wanna say
slow, but scrawny weak kid that just never

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:47.040
had an opportunity to become super strong.
And normally it wasn't an issue growing up

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.570
as a kid. It's all right. It's fine. You don't
need to be strong.

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.750
And it never really caught up to me until
I got to high school and everybody else around

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.240
me had this wonderful thing happen to them
and it missed out on me. Puberty. Well, by

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:03.900
the time I was a sophomore in high school,
I think I was maybe five feet tall, a hundred

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.590
pounds. And then my junior year, I finally
started growing.

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.940
I was five feet tall. I'm sorry. Five feet,
ten inches tall, still a hundred pounds. Just

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.640
a total weakling. A stiff breeze would blow
me over. I really wanted to start playing

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.430
basketball. My brother played. My dad played.
All of my friends played. I had played growing

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.800
up, so I signed up for the high school basketball
team.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:29.260
And actually, as a five foot ten, hundred
pound weakling, I got cut from the basketball

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.860
team. But this was the most horrifying moment
of my life. I can't believe I got cut from

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:39.349
this basketball team. So the very next day,
I signed up for a gym membership. I remember

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:45.050
this day like it happened yesterday. I went
to the gym and having no clue what I was doing,

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.910
walked upstairs to the free weight section.

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.720
I remember lying down on the bench. Like an
idiot, I loaded up 45-pound plates on each

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.910
side of the bench. And I remember lying down
on the bench, just that's what guys do. They

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.180
do bench presses. I didn't know any better.
All right. Why not? Let's get started. So

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.570
I laid down on the bench, lifted the weight
off the rack, brought it down to my chest--

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:07.830
[laughter]

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:13.410
and it got stuck there. Fortunately again,
I was stupid enough not to put any clips on

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:18.799
the outside of the rack. So I'm lying there
and I slowly twisted my body to the left until

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:24.620
that big 45-pound plate spiraled off the end
of the bar bell. Boom! Smack down on the ground.

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.439
As soon as that one hit, the whole weight
shifted to the other side. Boom! That one

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:33.840
fell down on the ground. I'm lying there on
the bench. OK. It's OK. Maybe nobody saw this.

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.870
So I quickly put the weight back, the bar
bell back on the rack. And I sat up. And I

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.809
looked as those 45-pound weights were rolling
across the gym floor and about 40 pairs of

00:04:42.809 --> 00:04:48.150
eyes were just staring at me, like "Who is
this kid and what is he doing in a gym?"

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.259
I thought the basketball cutting was getting
the most mortified area of my life. Nope.

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:57.830
It was that day, in that gym. But I realized
something. Like, you know what? OK. There's

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:02.599
a start here. I obviously can't get any worse
than what I just did. I can build from this.

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:04.340
There's something that I can do.

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.169
So from that point on, I made a commitment
to myself saying, "You know what? I wanna

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:15.259
get stronger. I don't wanna be weak. I don't
wanna be that skinny kid. I wanna start making

00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:21.689
some changes in my life." So I spent two years,
the last two years of my high school strength

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:26.740
training. I spent four years of college strength
training, desperately trying to get stronger.

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:30.009
I read every muscle and fitness magazine,
'cause that's what you're supposed to do if

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:34.740
you wanna get in shape, right? I started drinking
protein shakes, 'cause that's what you're

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:39.190
supposed to do. Didn't help. Through four
years of college, I think I put on maybe two

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:42.389
pounds. Just a complete, I'm not gonna say
waste of my time, 'cause I learned so much

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:43.400
in that time.

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:50.360
But I realized in those six years, I really
hadn't accomplished much. At this point after

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:55.110
graduating, I moved out to California. Got
a desk job in sales and signed up for a gym

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:59.369
membership. And fortunately, they gave me
five free personal trainer sessions. Something

00:05:59.369 --> 00:06:01.689
I had never had before, something I didn't
think I needed.

00:06:01.689 --> 00:06:07.009
I was like, "Oh, I'll be fine. I don't need
a trainer. I'd been exercising for six years."

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:12.860
Well, I sat down with that trainer, who completely
changed how I ate and how I exercised. And

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:17.349
I'll tell you, in those first 28 days, I had
more progress than I did in the entire six

00:06:17.349 --> 00:06:20.659
years prior of training. From that point,
I was addicted.

00:06:20.659 --> 00:06:25.330
And I knew it. It's like, "I got it." From
that point, I just started reading everything

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:31.660
I could about fitness. I wanted to be--. I
was like, OK. If I made six years of mistakes

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:35.840
and I've finally seen the light, there have
to be other people out there like me who don't

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:39.831
know who to talk to, who don't know where
to turn, maybe don't have the money for a

00:06:39.831 --> 00:06:41.860
personal trainer, but they wanna start getting
in shape.

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:48.150
So I started formulating this idea of a community
of folks that would help other people get

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:53.509
started on that path to getting in shape.
It was actually right around this time that

00:06:53.509 --> 00:06:58.020
a movie by the name of "300" came out. This
was back in 2007. And I'm sure most of you

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:01.869
guys have seen this movie. It may be not the
deepest plot in the world, or the deepest

00:07:01.869 --> 00:07:04.059
characters, but damn, those dudes were in
shape.

00:07:04.059 --> 00:07:09.729
And I couldn't help but get inspired watching
these guys and thinking here are actors getting

00:07:09.729 --> 00:07:14.270
paid millions of dollars and they dedicated
their lives for months and months and months

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:19.059
and months and months to get in the best shape
of their lives. So I started doing some research

00:07:19.059 --> 00:07:20.059
how they got in shape.

00:07:20.059 --> 00:07:24.710
What did they do? And I came across this quote
from Mark Twight, who is the trainer of all

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:30.360
the actors from the movie, "300." And that
quote is "appearance is a consequence of fitness."

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:35.669
And that really, really resonated with me.
It made sense. I said, "OK." For me, I wanted

00:07:35.669 --> 00:07:39.120
to get bigger and stronger. For many other
people, they needed to lose weight and maybe

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:41.479
get a little bit stronger.

00:07:41.479 --> 00:07:45.460
And this concept really fascinated me. OK,
if you wanna look better on the outside that's

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:50.929
quite all right. Put your focus into becoming
the best athlete or getting in the best shape

00:07:50.929 --> 00:07:56.879
of your life if you can and your appearance
will follow. So, I started building the concept

00:07:56.879 --> 00:08:03.249
of Nerd Fitness around that. So that's how
it happened, how I decided on the whole concept

00:08:03.249 --> 00:08:04.249
of Nerd Fitness.

00:08:04.249 --> 00:08:08.939
It's actually really pretty simple. I had
this idea from "300". I had been training,

00:08:08.939 --> 00:08:14.379
from that point, probably eight years in a
gym--two years pretty seriously. I was like,

00:08:14.379 --> 00:08:20.990
"Well, I'm kind of a nerd. I like fitness.
Stick 'em together." I looked it up. Couldn't

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:25.789
find any online for a community of folks that
worked at a desk job that wanted to get in

00:08:25.789 --> 00:08:26.789
shape.

00:08:26.789 --> 00:08:30.839
And I realized that I had been making mistakes
for the majority of my life trying to exercise.

00:08:30.839 --> 00:08:35.990
There had to be other people out there like
that. And as far as exercise goes, it's not

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:39.740
like in a video game. You always start on
that first level where everything is really

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:44.190
easy. They hold your hand and walk you through
it. In fitness, you're thrown to the sharks.

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:49.940
You walk into a gym. There's a million elliptical
machines, a bunch of exercise machines, free

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:55.149
weights with huge dudes standing. It's really
intimidating. And that stuff used to intimidate

00:08:55.149 --> 00:09:00.589
me, but it didn't anymore. And I thought I
had an opportunity to help people that were

00:09:00.589 --> 00:09:04.480
in my same position maybe six years prior
to start getting in shape.

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:11.160
So I come to you today not as a fitness expert.
I don't claim to be one. I leave that to the

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.990
actual fitness experts themselves. But I come
to you as a guy that's in the trenches with

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:19.800
you. I spend all day on a computer, sitting
behind a desk, until recently when I booked

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:23.829
this crazy trip, which I'll get to in a little
bit.

00:09:23.829 --> 00:09:29.160
But I booked this trip--. I'm sorry. I sit
behind a desk and I play video games at night,

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:34.250
but I also enjoy reading about fitness and
diet and health and exercise. And I want to

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:39.519
pass on that information to folks that don't
know where to begin who really wanna get started.

00:09:39.519 --> 00:09:44.910
So I formulated the concept for Nerd Fitness
and broke it down to one main goal.

00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:50.029
That's be better today than you were yesterday.
It's a simple concept. One sentence to grow

00:09:50.029 --> 00:09:53.930
around. But I didn't think that sounded nerdy
enough. If I'm gonna run a website called

00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:58.089
Nerd Fitness, I have to come up with a cooler,
nerdier tag-line than that. So that sentence

00:09:58.089 --> 00:10:02.199
became, "Level up your life, every single
day."

00:10:02.199 --> 00:10:06.370
That's a simple concept and it breaks down
into whatever aspect of fitness you're hoping

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:10.670
to accomplish. If you wanna be stronger, if
you can find a way to lift one more pound

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:14.009
today than you did last week, you're officially
stronger.

00:10:14.009 --> 00:10:15.850
[male voice interrupting]

00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:18.240
If you're a runner--. Sorry guys.

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:24.589
&gt;&gt;Female: Hi. If you're on VC, please make
sure to mute. We can hear you.

00:10:24.589 --> 00:10:26.430
[male voice interrupting]

00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:30.740
&gt;&gt;Steve Kamb: [chuckles] Hi guys on VC.

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:32.589
&gt;&gt;Female: OK, thanks.

00:10:32.589 --> 00:10:37.709
&gt;&gt;Steve Kamb: [chuckles] Alrighty then. So
yeah. Back to the concept of leveling up your

00:10:37.709 --> 00:10:41.550
life. It's simple. If you wanna be a better
runner, all you have to do is worry about

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:45.750
running one second faster, or one meter farther
than you ran last time.

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:49.940
And you're gonna start to make those changes.
You're gonna start improving and leveling

00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:54.620
up your life, very similar to a video game
character. And that's something that I grasped

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:59.190
on to and have been running Nerd Fitness as
concept around for almost three years now.

00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:02.110
So I wanted to break that down a little bit
more.

00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:07.500
What are four aspects of Nerd Fitness? Four
aspects of being a nerd that you can really

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:12.480
rally behind and apply to your everyday life,
to actually get better at fitness. I like

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:18.829
to refer to those affectionately as the Four
Pillars of Nerdiness. But we'll get to these

00:11:18.829 --> 00:11:24.490
shortly. But they come down to Zero to Hero,
Leveling Up, Achievements and Rewards, and

00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:27.100
also Clans and Competition.

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:31.740
So let's take a look at that first concept,
Zero to Hero. What does Spiderman, Captain

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:37.300
America, and the Incredible Hulk all have
in common? They all started out as nerds,

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:43.930
zeros. And through some super awesome act,
became an incredible super human version of

00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:51.100
themselves. And I always, again, as the skinny
guy, a weak guy, it's something I enjoyed

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:52.959
reading about and watching movies on.

00:11:52.959 --> 00:11:57.139
It's like, "Hey, that's kinda cool. This is
a guy that used to be a nobody and suddenly

00:11:57.139 --> 00:12:03.019
became a great, an updated version of themselves."
So obviously, until Google invents it, we

00:12:03.019 --> 00:12:07.370
don't have any radioactive spiders that can
bite us to turn us into superheroes. So, I

00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:11.350
wanna take a look at a different concept in
the same Zero to Hero category.

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:15.980
That's a game that I grew up playing, fell
in love with. I will play each one of them

00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:20.019
until the day I die. I'm talking about "The
Legend of Zelda." And the reason I fell in

00:12:20.019 --> 00:12:25.209
love with The Legend of Zelda is because at
the beginning of every game you're always

00:12:25.209 --> 00:12:29.000
this scrawny, a little kid with a wooden sword
and a wooden shield and you're told you need

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.689
to go save the world.

00:12:30.689 --> 00:12:35.350
Holy crap. That's a little intimidating. What
happens by the end of the game? You're wielding

00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:41.730
this sweet Master Sword. You're defeating
Ganon, rescuing Zelda, saving the world. You've

00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:46.899
done it. You've gone officially from zero
to hero--level zero to level 50 . You've been

00:12:46.899 --> 00:12:51.300
able to accomplish something that you didn't
think was possible back at the beginning.

00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:55.610
Sticking with that same concept. We're gonna
move on to Leveling Up here. So, my favorite

00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:59.939
game in Zelda was always "A Link to the Past,"
way back in the Super Nintendo. I remember

00:12:59.939 --> 00:13:03.500
playing this game actually back in 3rd grade.
My mom told me I couldn't play at once for

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:08.180
an entire month because I played so often
I couldn't sleep 'cause I had the music from--I

00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:12.709
think it was--the third dungeon in the Light
World playing in my head.

00:13:12.709 --> 00:13:15.070
I told my mom, "I can't sleep. The music's
stuck in my head." She said, "All right. Well

00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:19.759
you're not playing anymore." Crap. Luckily,
she let me finally start playing it again.

00:13:19.759 --> 00:13:25.880
And I realized why Zelda really appealed to
me. And it was this concept of this kid had

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:32.529
to go save the world with just this huge,
terrifying, overwhelming idea to him.

00:13:32.529 --> 00:13:37.709
But he didn't worry about it. What did he
do? Link started with level one. He beat level

00:13:37.709 --> 00:13:42.720
one, got a little bit stronger, got a new
weapon, moved on to level two. Did he have

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:46.920
to worry about the future? No. He moved on
to level two. As soon as he got to level two,

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:51.980
he can move on to level three and so on. Essentially,
to borrow a phrase from "What About Bob?"

00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:56.019
Essentially, this poor kid was simply taking
baby steps towards saving the world and he

00:13:56.019 --> 00:14:01.870
was able to accomplish it. The next concepts
are Achievements and Rewards. I don't know

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:06.050
if anybody here plays a game like World of
Warcraft, or any of those persistent online

00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:09.420
games. I'm sure everybody has had months of
their lives sucked into these things, like

00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:10.420
I have.

00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:17.310
For me, I actually started playing a game
called EverQuest, which is World of Warcraft's

00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:20.889
precursor, back in my--I wanna say--sophomore
year of high school. At the time, I had no

00:14:20.889 --> 00:14:26.829
car, but I had a great computer and an EverQuest
install disk, which meant months of my life

00:14:26.829 --> 00:14:30.569
were sucked into this game. And you know,
it's all virtual stuff.

00:14:30.569 --> 00:14:33.829
You don't really--. At the end of the day,
you could spend 15 hours getting all these

00:14:33.829 --> 00:14:38.420
really cool things, but you don't actually
accomplish anything in the real world. But

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:43.749
it didn't matter. You were still--. You had
this idea of constant achievements and rewards.

00:14:43.749 --> 00:14:47.050
If you started as level one, they tell you
to go kill some rats and deliver a message

00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:48.050
to somebody.

00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:50.939
I'd say, "Well, why the heck am I gonna do
that?" Well, because it's gonna get you closer

00:14:50.939 --> 00:14:54.959
to level two. As soon as you get to level
two, hey, I might a sword or I might get this

00:14:54.959 --> 00:14:59.769
cool spell or this new attack and go to this
new zone. You get to all these really cool

00:14:59.769 --> 00:15:05.529
things that continually escalate what you're
hoping to accomplish when it comes to--.

00:15:05.529 --> 00:15:09.340
What you do in this game you, again, very
similar to Zelda, you get to go up from a

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:14.199
zero to a hero--zero to level 50, or whatever
the level cap is these days. I have no idea

00:15:14.199 --> 00:15:19.459
because my computer broke and I couldn't play
it anymore. And last but not least, we have

00:15:19.459 --> 00:15:23.449
Clans and Competitions. I'm sure everybody
has also played a game like Modern Warfare

00:15:23.449 --> 00:15:31.819
2 or Halo, Half Life, Counter Strike, Team
Fortress, any of those online shooter games.

00:15:31.819 --> 00:15:35.759
And to be honest with you, I suck at first
person shooters. I am terrible. I lived with

00:15:35.759 --> 00:15:40.079
two kids in Atlanta for the past three years
who were great at these games. And I never

00:15:40.079 --> 00:15:43.930
wanted to play because I knew they'd always
kick my ass. One day last year, they got Halo

00:15:43.930 --> 00:15:48.069
Reach. They said, "Steve, c'mon man. Let's
play." "All right. I'll get into it. I'll

00:15:48.069 --> 00:15:49.629
finally start playing Halo."

00:15:49.629 --> 00:15:55.770
I think the first time I played, I got one
kill and I died 37 times. Not exactly a great

00:15:55.770 --> 00:16:00.310
ratio, but I learned something. You know what?
One kill is better than zero. And next time

00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:04.800
I went out, I got two kills and only 35 deaths.
It's like, "Well, you only got one more kill,

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:07.380
but hey. That's a hundred percent increase
in my kill ratio right there.

00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:11.740
Thank you very much." So I could build on
that. And I noticed I could start not only

00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:17.220
comparing myself against my previous stats,
but I could compare myself to people all around

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:22.120
the world and have these competitions and
say, "Well you know what? I got great at this.

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:26.129
I wasn't so good at this, but I can get better
and I can see if I'm getting better in the

00:16:26.129 --> 00:16:27.129
right way."

00:16:27.129 --> 00:16:32.639
So, we now have these four concepts. I wanna
think of what we can do to combine them and

00:16:32.639 --> 00:16:38.449
actually use them to essentially level up
our lives. Here's a term I like to call "Real

00:16:38.449 --> 00:16:41.160
Life Role-Playing," which is a little different
than the role-playing you're probably used

00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:45.449
to at home with your wife or husband. Let's
start with that first goal.

00:16:45.449 --> 00:16:50.309
We have a concept of going from zero to hero.
And for this, whenever anybody comes to me

00:16:50.309 --> 00:16:55.420
and says, "Steve, I wanna get in shape," or
"I wanna get stronger. I wanna run faster,"

00:16:55.420 --> 00:17:00.550
I encourage them to get super specific with
that goal. And by that I mean if you're gonna

00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:03.269
be a superhero, what would your super power
be?

00:17:03.269 --> 00:17:07.569
And the reason for that is it takes things
from the abstract and makes them tangible.

00:17:07.569 --> 00:17:12.870
So, if somebody says, "I wanna get in shape,"
encourage them to put a date and maybe a goal

00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:17.550
on it. And that becomes maybe lose ten percent
body fat by September 1st. You all of a sudden

00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:20.300
have a specific goal that you can start working
towards.

00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:26.150
Getting stronger becomes do a freaking pull-up
by Halloween. Everybody always wants to be

00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:32.000
able to do one. They never can. And they say
they want to get stronger. In what way do

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.720
you want to get stronger? Be specific and
then you can start tailoring your work outs

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:39.580
and your plans around how you're gonna get
stronger.

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:44.840
Maybe you wanna run faster. Everybody wants
to run faster. It's, you like running? Maybe

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:48.670
you wanna run faster. Let's break that down.
Instead of just running faster, maybe you

00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:53.470
wanna run a half marathon in under two hours.
Or maybe you wanna finally run a full marathon.

00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:59.100
Whatever it is set a specific goal so that
you know exactly what your particular level

00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:00.910
fifty is.

00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:07.320
And by that I mean you're working your way
up slowly. Yeah, you can get into it, but

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:11.940
if you have that specific idea in mind, that
tangible goal that you can work towards, it

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:15.450
makes it a lot easier to start putting the
steps in place, which is that next level up

00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:19.270
concept. And for this, I'm sure you've all
heard the phrase, "What gets measured gets

00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:20.530
improved."

00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:24.340
The reason I say that is because if you don't
know how good you did last week, how the heck

00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:28.190
are you gonna know how good you're gonna do
this week in order to be better? And for that,

00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:34.160
I mean it's time to track every workout you
do. And if you're not working out yet, I'll

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:38.080
get to this a little later on. And by that
I mean what exactly you did.

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:44.530
Did you do push-ups, squats? Did you do pull-ups?
Whatever you did, how many of them did you

00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:49.070
do? How long did it take you to do it? And
how did you feel afterwards? Once you have

00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:53.050
these things written down and kept track of,
next week you can look back at your previous

00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:58.120
workouts and say, "OK, I got it. Last week
I did ten push-ups. In order for me to be

00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:03.150
stronger this week, simple. I need to do 11
push-ups. If I can do 11, I am now officially

00:19:03.150 --> 00:19:04.150
stronger."

00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:07.630
If you’re running, maybe you ran a mile
last week and it exhausted you. OK. How long

00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:12.150
did it take you to run that mile? If it took
you nine, nine and a half minutes, great.

00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:16.450
If you can do it this week in nine minutes
and twenty-nine seconds, you are now officially

00:19:16.450 --> 00:19:19.061
faster. Congratulations, you made a step in
the right direction.

00:19:19.061 --> 00:19:23.490
On top of that, if you're really interested
in how your appearance looks, or you know

00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:27.290
you wanna lose weight, you wanna make sure
you're losing the right kind of weight. I

00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:31.520
wholeheartedly encourage you to keep track
of your measurements. And I don't mean measure

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:35.370
yourself on a daily basis. That can lead to
all kinds of mental issues.

00:19:35.370 --> 00:19:39.450
Oh my God, my weight went up one pound or
down two, or vice versa. I mean, over the

00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:43.980
course of a couple of weeks, keep track of
not only your body fat percentage, of which

00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:50.180
you can use a simple caliper that you can
buy online for ten bucks to show if it's progressing

00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:52.090
in the right direction. Also your weight.

00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:56.830
You can even use a simple tape measure. Take
measurements like your chest, navel, waist,

00:19:56.830 --> 00:20:01.890
hips, thigh, whatever. As long as you're measuring
the same thing in the same spot at the same

00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:07.430
time of day each week, you can show that you're
getting healthier in the right way. Another

00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:09.500
thing that you can also track is your diet.

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:12.870
I know a lot of people don't like to track
calories. For me personally, that's one of

00:20:12.870 --> 00:20:16.920
the best things I think somebody can do the
first couple days of starting out. The majority

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:20.920
of people don't have any idea how much they're
actually eating. And after a couple days of

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:24.810
tracking that, they realize, "Oh, I was eating
way more than I thought," or maybe, "I was

00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:26.540
eating way less than I thought."

00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:30.660
So that's the Leveling Up concept. At this
point, I wanna introduce a good friend of

00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:32.610
mine. I've never actually met her. She actually
lives in Boston, so I'll get a chance to meet

00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:38.830
her in a couple of weeks. It's a girl by the
name of Staci, who has recently become a moderator

00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:42.510
on the Nerd Fitness message boards, a community
that we have through the site.

00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:46.590
The reason I wanna bring up Staci, or Spezzy,
as she's known on the boards, is that she

00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:51.290
has become such an inspiration to all the
girls that read Nerd Fitness because of her

00:20:51.290 --> 00:20:55.490
great, incredible story. So we're gonna back
up a little bit. Staci works as an email marketing

00:20:55.490 --> 00:21:01.450
manager up in Boston. Back in August of 2009,
this is about a year before she discovered

00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:03.970
Nerd Fitness, she weighed 172 pounds.

00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:08.930
On top of that, she had a body fat percentage
around 35 to 37 percent, according to her

00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:14.590
doctor. And she wanted to lose weight. So
what she started doing, we'll get to that

00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:22.950
in a second. This is Staci at 172 pounds here
back in August of 2009. Now, what Staci did

00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:26.530
is what every girl that generally runs across
fitness starts doing.

00:21:26.530 --> 00:21:30.760
They start to starve themselves. They start
running six hours a day on a treadmill because

00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:35.690
they think that's what they're supposed to
do. And Staci did this for over a year. She

00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:41.100
worked out every single day. All she did was
run, run, run, run, run, run, run. I think

00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:46.050
she was eating somewhere between 900 and maybe
1100 calories a day, practically starving

00:21:46.050 --> 00:21:47.620
herself.

00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:55.650
As a result, she got all the way down to 120
pounds as of August of 2010. As an unfortunate

00:21:55.650 --> 00:22:01.120
side effect of that, Staci was also a twig.
She had no muscle on her. She was tired all

00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:07.350
the time. She felt like crap. And incredibly
weak, she told me a story of how she, at this

00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:10.741
point in her life, she actually wanted to
start weight training.

00:22:10.741 --> 00:22:16.030
So she bought herself a Gillian Michaels DVD
and two pink, 5-pound dumbbells. And could

00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:20.340
not actually physically lift them up to do
a chest press because she was so weak. So

00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:24.640
from that point on, this is the point when
she discovers Nerd Fitness, hops on the message

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:29.400
boards and starts speaking with all the other
folks on there that are doing strength training.

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:34.250
And from here on over the next two months,
she was actually able to put on ten pounds

00:22:34.250 --> 00:22:38.900
of healthy muscle. And how she did that was
honestly through strength training. And I

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:43.160
know a lot of girls are very hesitant. They
don't wanna get too bulky. They're, "Oh my

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:50.210
God, if I start lifting weights I'm gonna
start looking like some 'roided up girl that

00:22:50.210 --> 00:22:55.760
belongs in a body weight competition and not
in a, not the look that they're going for."

00:22:55.760 --> 00:23:00.920
Well, I'm here to tell you that's all crap.
I show you here that Staci, like I said, she

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:04.150
started weight training. And not only did
she start weight training, she started weight

00:23:04.150 --> 00:23:12.590
training old school. I'm talking barbell,
big plates on the side, lifting heavy, dead

00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:17.380
lifts, squats, overhead presses, bench press.
And it was actually right around this point

00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:20.780
in October when she started to really get
into the whole strength training thing.

00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:26.651
These are her stats over the past seven months
she's kept meticulous track of. The top bar

00:23:26.651 --> 00:23:30.550
is actually her, how much she's been able
to dead lift. You notice back in October she

00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:38.760
started at 135 pounds, and last week she actually
dead lifted 315 pounds. She weighs 140 pounds

00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:42.850
now. So, it's about two and a half, two point
two five, two and a half times her own body

00:23:42.850 --> 00:23:43.850
weight.

00:23:43.850 --> 00:23:48.510
Her bench press has gone from 95 pounds up
to 135. And her overhead press has gone from

00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:54.380
50 pounds all the way up to 95. And it's been
so cool to see this happen. So you're probably

00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:59.570
wondering, "OK. This girl packs on an additional
ten pounds of muscle again. She's been strength

00:23:59.570 --> 00:24:05.390
training heavy." I mean, 315 pounds is a ridiculous
amount of weight to lift. "So what happened?"

00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:09.780
What happens to somebody that packs on more
weight, as a female, while lifting heavy?

00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:16.660
This is her back in October at 131 pounds.
This is her taken yesterday at 142 pounds.

00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:20.920
Believe it or not, the picture on the right,
she's actually 11 pounds heavier than the

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:26.350
picture on the left. How was she able to do
it? One, she tracked all of her weight.

00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:30.160
She did every week. And honestly, I wouldn't
believe this if somebody sent me these pictures

00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:33.340
and said, "Hey, look what I did." Because
every, honestly the internet, everybody is

00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:38.990
skeptical. However, she's been keeping track
of every one of her workouts for the past

00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:40.980
seven months on the Nerd Fitness message boards.

00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:45.530
You go back through there and read the archives
and see on this day she lifted this much.

00:24:45.530 --> 00:24:49.520
She did these exercises. She weighed in at
this amount of weight. This is awesome to

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:53.850
see what she's been able to accomplish simply
because she knew what she wanted, she put

00:24:53.850 --> 00:25:02.111
her focus on getting stronger. And as a result,
her appearance started to show that.

00:25:02.111 --> 00:25:05.520
Now let's move on to that Achievements and
Rewards category. And this is very similar

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:10.580
to what I was just discussing. But I want
you to always show progress. And by that I

00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:15.070
mean, if you're keeping track of your stats.
It's really easy for you to see, OK. If I

00:25:15.070 --> 00:25:20.150
did this last week, I need to do this, this
week in order to start seeing some success.

00:25:20.150 --> 00:25:27.030
On top of that, I highly encourage people--and
this is one that drives me absolutely crazy--I

00:25:27.030 --> 00:25:33.120
see people go to a gym and they start lifting
weights. And they take a class and they do

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:38.110
some sort of cardio aerobic class and they
come home and stuff their face with a 300-calorie

00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:42.410
Gatorade and a piece of cake because they've
earned it because they worked out.

00:25:42.410 --> 00:25:45.460
They've actually done more damage with the
food that they ate compared to the amount

00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:49.900
of exercise that they have actually been able
to do. For that, I encourage you to reward

00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:56.650
yourself with things that reward you back.
And by that, I mean if you are--. If you wanna

00:25:56.650 --> 00:26:00.270
lose weight, say, by the time I get to 50
pounds loss, I'm gonna buy myself some new

00:26:00.270 --> 00:26:01.270
clothes.

00:26:01.270 --> 00:26:06.050
That will encourage you to wanna lift, encourage
you to want to continue to be better. Let's

00:26:06.050 --> 00:26:10.920
say maybe you want to take a karate class.
You say, "OK, great. I will take that karate

00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:15.670
class after I've exercised three days a week
for two months in a row." So that you have

00:26:15.670 --> 00:26:19.340
the confidence to walk into that class. You
have these things that you can build on and

00:26:19.340 --> 00:26:22.170
reward yourself with to give you things to
look forward to.

00:26:22.170 --> 00:26:26.560
Not only look forward to them, but look forward
to them and use those things to even get better

00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:31.880
and better and better. At this point, I wanna
introduce you to another guy that came across

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:38.210
my site back in October of 2010. His name
is Tony. Back in October, Tony weighed in

00:26:38.210 --> 00:26:42.760
at 257 pounds. He had a waist size of 40 inches.

00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:49.420
He had a shirt size of double XL and he came
to me looking for a plan to follow. He wanted

00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:53.780
to get in shape. He knew he needed some sort
of specific plan and he didn't have one. He

00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:58.100
emailed me and said, "Steve, I just picked
up your Rebel Fitness guide." It's a workout

00:26:58.100 --> 00:26:59.411
plan that I offer through the website.

00:26:59.411 --> 00:27:03.630
He said, "I picked it up. I wanna get started.
I just wanna let you know that today is the

00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:08.600
day that I'm starting." All right, Tony. Thanks,
man. I didn't hear from Tony for five months.

00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:13.420
I just figured it happens. People drop off
the face of the earth. He tried it, failed,

00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:17.160
didn't work out for him. Fortunately, Tony
actually stuck with it.

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:23.910
I got an email from Tony again back in March.
Tony, at this point in March, dropped his

00:27:23.910 --> 00:27:29.650
weight down to 211 pounds, which is 46 pounds
lost in five months. His waist size dropped

00:27:29.650 --> 00:27:36.320
by four inches. Shirt size went down to large.
The way the Rebel Fitness guide is set up

00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:40.810
is it's broken into different levels. For
somebody that's brand new to exercise, you

00:27:40.810 --> 00:27:42.330
can start at Level One.

00:27:42.330 --> 00:27:46.060
If you do your eight weeks at Level One, then
you progress up to Level Two. As soon as you

00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:49.530
get through Level Two, you can move on to
Level Three. So there's this constant progression

00:27:49.530 --> 00:27:53.910
and reward system that says, "Hey, you're
able to accomplish this. I encourage you to

00:27:53.910 --> 00:27:54.920
move on to the next one."

00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:59.320
Well, Tony emailed me in March with his after
picture and said, "Hey, I don't have a Nerd

00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:03.610
Fitness t-shirt yet, but as soon as I get
through Level Three, I'm gonna buy one." And

00:28:03.610 --> 00:28:08.520
it was so, pretty cool. So Tony actually sent
me a picture wearing his homemade Nerd Fitness

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:12.410
t-shirt, where he had taken his I Heart New
York and taped a blue "F" onto it.

00:28:12.410 --> 00:28:13.410
[laughter]

00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:16.390
I was so inspired by Tony's story enough that
I said, "If you get through Level Three man,

00:28:16.390 --> 00:28:20.540
I'm gonna send you a shirt." And fortunately,
he got through it. So I decided to send him

00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:25.480
a Nerd Fitness t-shirt. And on top of that,
what's been great to see is Tony not only

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:29.580
says something like, "Hey, I made it through
Level Three. I can't wait to get to Level

00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:30.580
Four."

00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:33.950
When he gets to Level Four and beats Level
Four, he said, "I can't wait to move on to

00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:40.490
the next Rebel Strength guide." There's another
e-book that I put out. And that was his reward

00:28:40.490 --> 00:28:45.070
was to move on to the next step. He wasn't
gonna reward himself by binge eating and drinking

00:28:45.070 --> 00:28:50.830
and regressing. He was gonna reward himself
with things that continue to reward him in

00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:51.830
the right direction.

00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:58.170
So here's a look at Tony again, before and
after. Why was Tony so successful? And I'd

00:28:58.170 --> 00:29:02.930
love to say that it was my e-books, but to
be honest with you my e-book is no different

00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:07.640
from the other e-books that are offered out
there. It always pretty much comes to the

00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:10.650
same thing--having a plan that you can stick
with.

00:29:10.650 --> 00:29:14.290
The reason I think my book worked for Tony
is because it's filled with Star Wars and

00:29:14.290 --> 00:29:18.460
Lord of the Rings references and things like
that that keep people interested and excited

00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:22.880
and have that level progression that Tony
really latched onto. So, he had a specific

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:27.391
plan to follow. Tony started at Level One.
He worked his eight weeks.

00:29:27.391 --> 00:29:30.620
As soon as he got through that, he moved on
to Level Two. He did his eight weeks there

00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:36.410
and he moved on to Level Three. He's now halfway
through Level Four and as soon as he's done

00:29:36.410 --> 00:29:39.190
with that, he said he's gonna move on to the
next e-book, which I told him I'd send him

00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:43.290
absolutely free of charge because I just can't
help but love what this guy's been able to

00:29:43.290 --> 00:29:44.290
accomplish.

00:29:44.290 --> 00:29:48.720
It's been so inspiring for me. And last but
not least, we have our Clans and Competitions.

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:54.430
And this one is relatively self-explanatory.
For this, I mean it's simple. Have a support

00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:57.400
group. A lot of us, and I'm assuming at Google
here, you guys have plenty of friends that

00:29:57.400 --> 00:30:00.870
are all interested in these type of things.
We're all--.

00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:04.580
Here you guys are all work in a similar type
of job. You're sitting behind a desk. You're

00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:09.980
sitting at a computer. Maybe you wanna start
getting in shape. So you have those folks

00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:14.490
that you can reach out to, folks that you
can express your concerns with and say, "Hey,

00:30:14.490 --> 00:30:17.490
I'm not making progress on this," or share
your goals.

00:30:17.490 --> 00:30:24.790
And share your successes. If you have an unsupportive
husband or wife and you go home and say, "Honey,

00:30:24.790 --> 00:30:26.960
I just dead lifted 225 pounds," and they don't
know what a dead lift is, well, they're probably

00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:31.280
not gonna care. And you're not gonna have
that encouragement. So, the reason the thing

00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:38.530
about Nerd Fitness that I'm most proud of,
the thing that I think is the future of where

00:30:38.530 --> 00:30:42.520
this community is headed is the message board
community and the community itself that has

00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:44.130
sprung up around the blog.

00:30:44.130 --> 00:30:49.060
The reason I say that is because it's nerds
and desk jockeys from all over the world that

00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:53.840
don't have this support group at home. Because
they don't have it at home, they have all

00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:57.030
friends that all just wanna sit around and
play video games all day and say, "Hey, you

00:30:57.030 --> 00:30:59.440
wanna go exercise?" "No, I'm just gonna sit
here and do this."

00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:04.040
Well, they have a support group online--people
that they can reach out to and say, "Hey,

00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:07.840
I just did this," or, "I just accomplished
that." And there's thousands. We're up to,

00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:12.430
I think, 1700 people on the boards now. So
if anybody posts something like, "Hey, I just

00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:16.290
ran my first half marathon," there will be
20 people posting within a couple of minutes

00:31:16.290 --> 00:31:17.290
to say congratulations.

00:31:17.290 --> 00:31:21.860
And I know that person is so fired up reading
these things and saying, "You know what? I'm

00:31:21.860 --> 00:31:27.140
starting to, I get it. I'm part of something
now, something that's bigger than me and I'm

00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:32.250
making success. And not only am I being successful,
but I'm inspiring other people to have success

00:31:32.250 --> 00:31:37.540
as well." At this point, I wanna introduce
you to my friend Saint.

00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:44.590
Saint and I grew up together and we played
basketball back when we were in, I think,

00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:47.000
5th grade. And stayed in touch. Actually,
the way Saint and I stayed in touch--. He

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:52.260
lives in Boston and after that, I went to
college in Tennessee, California, and Atlanta.

00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:56.160
The way that Saint and I stayed in touch was
really through EverQuest--EverQuest and Gchat

00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:59.030
these days.

00:31:59.030 --> 00:32:05.830
Saint came to me back in--let's see--it was
January of 2009 and a weight of 236 pounds.

00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:11.080
Like any other desk jockey, he had kinda sat
around after he graduated college. Didn't

00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:16.460
really keep track of his weight. Didn't really
exercise much. And wanted to start making

00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:18.511
some changes. He said, "Steve I wanna lose
weight."

00:32:18.511 --> 00:32:25.700
All right, bud. Well, it's somebody that wants
to get in shape. I said, "I encourage you

00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:29.080
to start putting some goals in place." Well,
he wasn't really interested in strength training.

00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:32.940
He wasn't really interested in keeping track
of what he ate. He's like, "I'll just eat

00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:38.030
less and run a lot more." All right. Well,
it's a start. So what happened was Saint lost

00:32:38.030 --> 00:32:40.680
about 30 pounds over the course of the year.

00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:45.010
Honestly, through the same way that Staci,
or Spezzy, was able to lose her weight by

00:32:45.010 --> 00:32:50.250
almost starving himself and running ragged.
So what happened was Saint, back in January,

00:32:50.250 --> 00:32:55.620
got all the way down to 203 pounds and then
continued to try and work that weight off.

00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:58.480
Unfortunately, over the year nothing happened.

00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:04.560
He got stuck at 203 pounds and he ended up
at a body fat percentage around 20% or so,

00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:09.640
which is--. He's not a really out of shape
guy. He stayed relatively active, but it wasn't

00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:15.120
where he wanted to be. He's always struggled
to get across the 200-pound barrier. And then

00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:18.940
something happened that I will always look
back on.

00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:23.560
What happened is Saint emailed me out of the
blue, or actually it was on Gchat, back in

00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:28.190
January. Said, "Steve, I've made a huge mistake."
"All right, Saint. How much money do you need?"

00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:33.870
"No. I don't need any money. I entered into
a competition with my friends at work." "OK.

00:33:33.870 --> 00:33:36.190
That sounds like a good idea. Well, what happened?"

00:33:36.190 --> 00:33:41.440
"Well, I'm getting married in June and I wanna
be in the best shape of my life for my honeymoon.

00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:44.980
So I told my friends that if I didn't get
below ten percent body fat by the time Memorial

00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:51.240
Day rolled around, I owe them $500 ." "Saint,
are you an idiot?" "Yes. I'm an idiot." "Do

00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:53.330
you have $500 to give to your friends if you
don't make it?"

00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:57.770
"No, I don't, which is why I need you to help
me get there." "All right, dude. You got it.

00:33:57.770 --> 00:34:02.880
It's gonna be tough, but let's make it happen."
So, over the past five months, I told Saint

00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:07.020
he needed to start tracking everything that
he did meticulously if he wanted to get down

00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:11.349
to that level. And obviously, ten percent
is a really low number.

00:34:11.349 --> 00:34:16.419
So he had to be incredibly diligent with not
only what he ate, but how he trained. And

00:34:16.419 --> 00:34:20.130
obviously, decent genetics and everything
like that factored in there as well. But he

00:34:20.130 --> 00:34:25.520
started to--. He wanted to get down to that
body fat percentage. So this is Saint's weight

00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:29.530
over the past five months. If you notice,
he started up around 203 pounds.

00:34:29.530 --> 00:34:35.070
He quickly weight dropped off. He lost seven
pounds or so right around the February mark.

00:34:35.070 --> 00:34:40.190
Weight went down a little bit. Went down around
to 193 pounds. And then his weight started

00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:44.600
going back up again. So by the time middle
of May rolled around, Saint had only lost

00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:49.210
seven pounds. Fortunately, Saint had been
tracking a lot of other metrics as well.

00:34:49.210 --> 00:34:53.480
So for the past five months, Saint has been
tracking his body fat percentage by getting

00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:57.500
it measured every two weeks. He also took
measurements of different parts of his body

00:34:57.500 --> 00:35:01.400
every two weeks to make sure he was progressing
in the right direction. So after a month and

00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:05.360
a half, Saint's body fat, although his weight
was dropping as we saw in the previous slide,

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:07.240
his body fat wasn't going anywhere.

00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:12.050
And he's like, "Oh, crap. Well, I'm two months
in. I got three months to go. I don't have

00:35:12.050 --> 00:35:16.990
$500 to give up. I need to start making some
changes." So I told Saint, "All right, man.

00:35:16.990 --> 00:35:22.120
What you need to do is focus on getting stronger.
Put the focus on getting stronger. We're gonna

00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:26.840
clean up your diet." That day, he signed up
for a gym membership and started lifting heavy.

00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:32.020
Like clockwork, Saint's body fat dropped back
in March. Actually, he started joining the

00:35:32.020 --> 00:35:37.980
gym right around mid-February. He went from
right around 20 percent in mid-February all

00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:41.770
the way down to nine point five percent in
May. He emailed me halfway through May and

00:35:41.770 --> 00:35:44.270
said, "Holy crap. I did it." "What did you
do?"

00:35:44.270 --> 00:35:48.770
He said, "I got down to nine point five percent."
"All right." Well again, this is one of those

00:35:48.770 --> 00:35:53.440
situations where I wouldn't believe it if
I didn't see it. This is Saint back in January.

00:35:53.440 --> 00:36:00.280
And this is Saint in May. Again, and when
I say January. The weight really didn't start

00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:04.900
dropping off until halfway through February.
The reason Saint was able to have the success

00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:06.940
is 'cause he had that fire lit underneath
him.

00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:10.890
I'm not encouraging everyone to start betting
their friends that they pay them 500 bucks

00:36:10.890 --> 00:36:15.230
so they don't get what they want, but it was
able for them--. It was a way for Saint to

00:36:15.230 --> 00:36:19.200
finally start making some changes. Not only
did he make these changes, but he put his

00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:24.620
focus on getting stronger. Saint leveled up
his life by focusing on getting stronger.

00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:27.590
And the best part about this whole thing is
I get emails from Saint, Gchats from Saint

00:36:27.590 --> 00:36:32.060
on a daily basis still. Whereas for the past
two years, they'd always been, "I need to

00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:36.640
lose weight," or, "I can't get to where I
need to be," or, "I can't do this." These

00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:42.850
Gchats are now, "Holy crap, Steve. I just
dead lifted 225 pounds for the first time."

00:36:42.850 --> 00:36:46.580
"Steve, I can do five pull-ups in a row now.
Last year, I couldn't do a single pull-up."

00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:49.890
Or, "Hey, I just dunked a basketball. I didn't
think I'd ever be able to do that." But he

00:36:49.890 --> 00:36:55.001
did it. His goals have now completely shifted.
They've gone from "I need to lose weight,"

00:36:55.001 --> 00:36:57.350
something generic to something super specific.

00:36:57.350 --> 00:37:02.870
He wanted to get to a certain body fat percentage.
That was his driving force to begin with.

00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:07.560
And since then, his goals have shifted to
wanting to become stronger and a more leveled

00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:15.220
up version of himself. And that's what all
three of these folks have in common. They

00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:19.920
all set specific, concrete goals. Not only
did they have these specific, concrete goals,

00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:22.460
but they broke these goals down into specific
steps.

00:37:22.460 --> 00:37:27.461
So they knew what they needed to do to go
from Level One to Level Two to Level Three.

00:37:27.461 --> 00:37:32.050
There was always that progression. It was
never too overwhelming for them 'cause all

00:37:32.050 --> 00:37:36.680
they had to focus on was that next logical
step of the progression. On top of that, they

00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:38.290
all tracked their workouts.

00:37:38.290 --> 00:37:42.800
They tracked their weight and multiple other
things on themselves to make sure they were

00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:46.820
headed in the right direction. If Saint wasn't
tracking his body fat and he just saw that

00:37:46.820 --> 00:37:51.090
his weight was dropping off, he wasn't taking
measurements, he never would've known that--.

00:37:51.090 --> 00:37:55.220
He wasn't sure why things weren't working
out for him, but because he was keeping track

00:37:55.220 --> 00:37:59.150
of all these different things and he could
compare them week over week, month over month,

00:37:59.150 --> 00:38:04.190
he could see that progress and say, "OK. I'm
there. I'm starting to do things in the right

00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:06.700
way. I'm making progress. I can build on this."

00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:11.010
Last but not least, they all incorporated
community. I can guarantee you--. Community

00:38:11.010 --> 00:38:15.270
and competition. I can guarantee you, Staci
wouldn't look the way she does today if she

00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:20.590
had never found the Nerd Fitness community
that helped her find her love of barbell training

00:38:20.590 --> 00:38:25.370
and really enjoying strength training. I can
tell you Saint would still be stuck at 203

00:38:25.370 --> 00:38:29.930
pounds today if he didn't have that competition
behind him to finally push him over the edge

00:38:29.930 --> 00:38:31.630
and wanna start making some serious changes.

00:38:31.630 --> 00:38:41.070
And I'll tell you just a quick, little bit
about my epic quest. Back in December, I was

00:38:41.070 --> 00:38:47.800
living with two friends in Atlanta. And one
is moving in with his girlfriend. And another

00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:52.610
one is moving out of state. So I had this
opportunity as well. I could get my own place

00:38:52.610 --> 00:38:56.870
to live and keep doing what I'm doing. I had
already been running Nerd Fitness as my full-time

00:38:56.870 --> 00:38:58.980
job for the past six months.

00:38:58.980 --> 00:39:04.830
Or, I could book some crazy trip. And the
reason I wanted to book a crazy trip is because

00:39:04.830 --> 00:39:09.640
honestly, I'm one of the most risk-adverse
homebodies that you'll meet. Up until November

00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:14.980
of last year, I had never been out of North
America. I am a very picky eater. So, traveling

00:39:14.980 --> 00:39:17.780
to foreign countries scared the crap out of
me.

00:39:17.780 --> 00:39:24.940
And things that scared me, I told myself,
"How are you going to encourage people to

00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:28.450
want to live better and step outside of their
comfort zone if you can't do it yourself?"

00:39:28.450 --> 00:39:33.190
So for me, I essentially travel-hacked. I
sold my car. Sold most of my stuff. And travel-hacked

00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:35.881
my way into a 35,000 mile trip around the
world.

00:39:35.881 --> 00:39:39.820
I wanted to start crossing things off my bucket
list. Now, obviously a bucket list doesn't

00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:43.540
sound nerdy enough, so I decided to call it
my Epic Quest of Awesome, 'cause I thought

00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:46.550
it sounded cooler. So, while traveling, I
started doing things that scared me when visiting

00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:51.420
a foreign country. Here I am doing push-ups
on the Great Wall of China.

00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:57.380
Bungee jumping. Scuba-diving with sharks and
finding Nemo down there. And even jumping

00:39:57.380 --> 00:40:02.390
out of an airplane. I started doing things
that really scared me because I not only wanted

00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:07.461
to level up my workouts and my fitness, but
I wanted to level up my life. And for me to

00:40:07.461 --> 00:40:11.050
level up my life, it was doing things and
seeing things and experiencing things that

00:40:11.050 --> 00:40:13.550
I had never seen or done or felt before.

00:40:13.550 --> 00:40:19.180
It also presented an interesting situation
for me. I've been a gym rat, I guess, for

00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:23.430
the past decade of my life. I can think of
maybe three or four months along the way where

00:40:23.430 --> 00:40:27.660
I haven't had a gym membership. And in those
three or four months, I've gotten weaker because

00:40:27.660 --> 00:40:32.130
I didn't know what the heck to do if I didn't
have barbells and plates and all that good

00:40:32.130 --> 00:40:33.510
stuff to workout.

00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:37.340
So, I had to put a plan in place. Honestly,
it was for you guys. I wanted to come back

00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:41.619
to Google in better shape than when I left.
So I was scared I was gonna come back after

00:40:41.619 --> 00:40:46.070
four months of living out of a backpack, no
gym, looking like a complete skeleton and

00:40:46.070 --> 00:40:51.280
having you guys saying, "Who the heck is this
guy and who is he to tell us about fitness?"

00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:55.920
So I spent the three months while traveling,
I'm sorry, three and a half months while traveling,

00:40:55.920 --> 00:41:02.210
no gym, living out of a backpack, completely
readjusting how I worked out. And to do that,

00:41:02.210 --> 00:41:06.860
I put my focus on getting stronger with only
body weight exercises. And that was a concept

00:41:06.860 --> 00:41:08.701
that I just honestly didn't think was possible.

00:41:08.701 --> 00:41:13.880
I can do push-ups, but I don't think that's
gonna get me any stronger, if I keep doing

00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:18.660
the same kind of push-ups in a row. So I started
doing research into guys like gymnasts and

00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:21.501
people from Cirque du Soleil. I figured, "You
know what? If these guys can get in great

00:41:21.501 --> 00:41:24.540
shape without picking up a weight, maybe I
could, too."

00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:29.550
On top of that, a term I like to use is "MacGyvering"
a workout. I'm sure everybody has seen the

00:41:29.550 --> 00:41:35.460
show MacGyver, where MacGyver, he's save the
world or blow up something that if you give

00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:39.270
him a paper clip, a piece of gum, and a plastic
straw, and he'll figure out a way to make

00:41:39.270 --> 00:41:44.090
a bomb out of it. Well, for me, I had to figure
a way how to make a workout out of everywhere

00:41:44.090 --> 00:41:45.390
that I was traveling.

00:41:45.390 --> 00:41:50.680
So every time I got out into a new city, I
would walk around until I found either a tree

00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:57.240
branch, a kid's swing set, overhang of a bus
station. I've even worked out hanging off

00:41:57.240 --> 00:42:01.710
of something inside the Auckland, New Zealand
airport because that was where I could find

00:42:01.710 --> 00:42:05.540
something to do pull-ups on. And beyond those
pull-ups, everything else I did was just using

00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:09.570
my body weight.

00:42:09.570 --> 00:42:13.250
And along with just using the body weight
exercises, I had to clearly defined path for

00:42:13.250 --> 00:42:17.560
success. And what I mean by that is there
was a logical progression for each exercise

00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:22.360
that I had to go through in order for me to
actually get to that successful stage. And

00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:25.530
what I mean by that is I started out doing
regular push-ups.

00:42:25.530 --> 00:42:29.250
As soon as those became too easy for me, I
knew where to go next. I put my feet up on

00:42:29.250 --> 00:42:35.030
a bench and do decline push-ups. From there,
I started working towards handstand push-ups,

00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:39.110
where I just put my feet up against a wall
and try to hold a handstand as long as possible.

00:42:39.110 --> 00:42:42.510
From there, trying to do maybe a half handstand
push-up.

00:42:42.510 --> 00:42:46.560
Beyond that, doing a full handstand push-up.
I'm at the point know where I can do nine

00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:50.260
handstand push-ups in a row, something that
I hadn't even considered five months ago.

00:42:50.260 --> 00:42:54.740
It's something I never even thought I'd be
able to do just because it wasn't something

00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:57.109
I'd considered. On top of that, I can now
do--.

00:42:57.109 --> 00:43:04.260
I went from doing seven pull-ups in a row
to 20 pull-ups in a row. And from zero one-legged

00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:09.850
squats, I can almost do five on each leg now.
And as a result of getting stronger and doing

00:43:09.850 --> 00:43:14.651
these things, I put a focus on eating healthier.
As a result, I put on ten pounds in the past

00:43:14.651 --> 00:43:18.970
three months of almost all muscle while living
out of a backpack and traveling.

00:43:18.970 --> 00:43:25.250
And I realized, "You know what? If I can do
this while traveling, there's no reason that

00:43:25.250 --> 00:43:29.510
nobody else can not build a workout." And
here at Google, you guys have such a great

00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:33.660
advantage. You guys have personal trainers
on staff that can help you out if you're interested.

00:43:33.660 --> 00:43:35.800
You have people that can answer your questions.

00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:39.910
But there's sometimes where maybe you're traveling
or on vacation and you wanna get in shape

00:43:39.910 --> 00:43:44.050
and you don't really know where to begin.
Well, you can really break things down to

00:43:44.050 --> 00:43:48.130
make things as simple as possible. As they
say, "Keep it simple, stupid." So, in order

00:43:48.130 --> 00:43:53.090
to build a workout, I like to keep everything
at 45 minutes--no longer than that.

00:43:53.090 --> 00:44:00.920
Be super intense in those 45 minutes. And
also, focus on doing real world movements.

00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:04.992
And by that, I mean doing exercises that prepare
your body for the real world. I don't mean

00:44:04.992 --> 00:44:08.960
doing bicep curls and getting in a machine
and doing leg curls and all that garbage.

00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:12.210
I mean doing things that actually help you
out while you're traveling.

00:44:12.210 --> 00:44:17.030
I mean, help you out in your real life. And
for that, I mean if you can do a simple body

00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:21.869
weight squat and drop down below--. Drop your
body down and focus on squats. The next time

00:44:21.869 --> 00:44:26.680
you need to move your couch, pick up your
kid, grab your groceries, your body is already

00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:30.631
prepared for these movements because you've
put your body through these movements on a

00:44:30.631 --> 00:44:31.631
repeated basis.

00:44:31.631 --> 00:44:36.210
It's ready to handle these things. So if it's
ready to handle these things, you're gonna

00:44:36.210 --> 00:44:43.290
be far less likely inclined to get injured.
On top of that, you can also pick your exercise,

00:44:43.290 --> 00:44:48.040
I'm sorry. Pick your level for each exercise.
And by that, I mean for a push-up. You go

00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:51.610
from a push-up to a declined push-up, to that
next level.

00:44:51.610 --> 00:44:56.280
Each push-up is going up. Squats can go from
two-legged squats to one-legged squats while

00:44:56.280 --> 00:45:01.340
holding on to something, down to--. There
are huge--. There's levels and levels of progressions

00:45:01.340 --> 00:45:07.630
for each exercise you can do. So for this,
I made things super simple for while I was

00:45:07.630 --> 00:45:09.680
traveling 'cause I knew I wouldn't have a
lot of time.

00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:13.510
I might be at a bus station one day, the next
day in a different town. So I wanted to keep

00:45:13.510 --> 00:45:18.060
things super simple. I started with a simple
push exercise. By that, I mean push-ups. If

00:45:18.060 --> 00:45:21.540
you can't do a single push-up yet, you can
start by doing them against a wall, putting

00:45:21.540 --> 00:45:26.369
your hands on the side of a bench, something
where it makes it a little easier for you.

00:45:26.369 --> 00:45:30.920
Just like the rest of your life, you can level
it up step by step by step until you're getting

00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:36.480
stronger. After you do your push exercises,
we move on to a pull exercise. Pull is gonna

00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:40.480
work your back, your biceps and your forearms.
So right there you've pretty much covered

00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:44.520
almost every single muscle group in your entire
upper body in two exercises.

00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:48.200
Now, you might be able to do a pull-up. You
might not. If you can't do a pull-up, it's

00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:52.590
OK. There are progressions you can take on
pull-ups as well, whether it's a bent over

00:45:52.590 --> 00:45:56.970
row where you're down on one knee, lifting
your backpack, your laptop bag, something

00:45:56.970 --> 00:46:01.130
up in the air, pulling backwards. That is
working your back and will get you started

00:46:01.130 --> 00:46:05.840
in the right direction towards finally doing
a pull-up.

00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:11.210
After that, we have leg exercises. This is
simple. Squats, lunges, anything that involves

00:46:11.210 --> 00:46:14.960
your lower body. If you squat deep enough,
not only are you activating your quads, but

00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:19.010
you're also activating your hamstrings, your
flutes, your calves. Your whole lower body

00:46:19.010 --> 00:46:21.160
essentially gets worked out along with your
core.

00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:25.610
When you're doing things like squats and lunges
and you can do things called step ups, where

00:46:25.610 --> 00:46:31.020
you're stepping up onto a high ledge, or doing
box jumps where you're jumping up onto a ledge.

00:46:31.020 --> 00:46:36.410
It's putting your entire lower body through
a workout in just one exercise. Last but not

00:46:36.410 --> 00:46:37.410
least we have our core exercise.

00:46:37.410 --> 00:46:41.619
It's gonna work your stomach, your lower back,
and your obliques. So just like that in four

00:46:41.619 --> 00:46:47.200
exercises, we've almost covered every muscle
group in your body. And I understand this

00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:51.210
is not a fully complete workout, but if you're
pinched for time, if you're traveling, if

00:46:51.210 --> 00:46:54.690
you don't have a gym, you don't have weights
to lift, or maybe you're just not interested

00:46:54.690 --> 00:46:55.690
in going to a gym.

00:46:55.690 --> 00:46:58.501
To be honest with you, I might never have
set foot in a gym again because I've had so

00:46:58.501 --> 00:47:04.790
much fun doing what I've done over these past
four months. And you take these four exercises.

00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:11.230
Now I realize this chart looks a little intimidating
at first. But it really is very similar to

00:47:11.230 --> 00:47:14.130
a Choose Your Own Adventure. I remember reading
those books as a kid.

00:47:14.130 --> 00:47:18.710
What you take is you have your four exercises
from the previous page and you decide on what

00:47:18.710 --> 00:47:22.950
your desired outcome is. If you want to build
strength, you simply focus on only doing four

00:47:22.950 --> 00:47:27.540
to six reps. If you want to hypertrophy, which
is essentially increasing muscular size, you're

00:47:27.540 --> 00:47:30.080
gonna focus on doing eight to twelve reps.

00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:33.780
And maybe you wanna focus on muscular endurance,
if you're an endurance athlete or you just

00:47:33.780 --> 00:47:37.170
wanna see how much of a certain exercise you
can do. That's when your reps are gonna go

00:47:37.170 --> 00:47:42.600
from 12 to 15 plus. So what you're gonna do,
is you take your four exercises--it's almost

00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:45.400
like fill in the equation--you pick your four
exercises.

00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:50.600
You decide on your sets, your reps, and your
rests. And then you track your results. You

00:47:50.600 --> 00:47:55.510
say, "I did four sets of ten push-ups this
week. I did three sets of five squats this

00:47:55.510 --> 00:48:01.500
week. And I did four sets of two pull-ups."
Perfect. Write it down. Pull up Evernote on

00:48:01.500 --> 00:48:07.280
your phone or shoot yourself an email. Keep
track of what you did this week so next week

00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:10.200
you know exactly what you need to do in order
to be better.

00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:16.450
And I realize that's a very simplified version
of what a workout is. I also make sure you

00:48:16.450 --> 00:48:21.810
warm up beforehand and stretch properly afterwards.
I didn't want to get into all that stuff here

00:48:21.810 --> 00:48:25.859
in this presentation. It would take way too
long. I actually love to work with the Google

00:48:25.859 --> 00:48:31.820
trainers here and send everybody that's interested
a .pdf of not only what I've been doing on

00:48:31.820 --> 00:48:36.980
the past four months with descriptions and
videos of each exercise, but also a unified

00:48:36.980 --> 00:48:38.869
message between Nerd Fitness and Google.

00:48:38.869 --> 00:48:43.820
I don't think there's a better audience that
I can get in front of as far as being a nerd

00:48:43.820 --> 00:48:48.910
and being excited about fitness. And putting
together something that you guys can not only

00:48:48.910 --> 00:48:54.380
take with you, but read and kinda start building
your own concepts. It's very similar to the

00:48:54.380 --> 00:48:59.109
whole give a man a fish, he eats for a day.
Teach a man to fish, he eats for a lifetime,

00:48:59.109 --> 00:49:00.109
blah, blah, blah.

00:49:00.109 --> 00:49:04.410
You know it. It's very similar to that. So,
today I wanna leave you with one final concept

00:49:04.410 --> 00:49:10.770
before we open up to questions. It comes down
to "Do something. Do anything." We're all

00:49:10.770 --> 00:49:16.100
at that point in our lives where certain things
seem overwhelming. If you're really overweight

00:49:16.100 --> 00:49:21.900
and you wanna get down to a certain weight,
it could be very overwhelming and intimidating.

00:49:21.900 --> 00:49:26.690
If you wanna go to a gym and it's scary for
you to get there, don't worry. Maybe you wanna

00:49:26.690 --> 00:49:31.330
finally you run a marathon, but you can't
walk ten feet without losing your breath.

00:49:31.330 --> 00:49:38.000
That's OK. Focus on doing something today.
And by that, it can honestly mean as something

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:43.010
as walking a little bit, doing a couple push-ups
at your desk in-between sets.

00:49:43.010 --> 00:49:48.210
I'm sorry, in between projects. And maybe
you're trying to eat better. Focus on changing

00:49:48.210 --> 00:49:54.270
one thing in your diet, trying to eat a little
bit healthier. And the example I always like

00:49:54.270 --> 00:50:01.960
to call upon is--just to cement my nerdiness--I
like to look back and think about Optimus

00:50:01.960 --> 00:50:03.330
Prime from Transformers.

00:50:03.330 --> 00:50:10.000
When you think of Optimus Prime, you got this
huge Mack Truck, and all of a sudden he becomes

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:15.890
a freaking giant robot. How did he do it?
One step at a time. It wasn't he snapped his

00:50:15.890 --> 00:50:21.320
fingers and all of a sudden transformed from
a truck into a robot. One tire pulled in.

00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:26.470
The windshield pulls down a little bit. Something
else gets tucked behind something else.

00:50:26.470 --> 00:50:31.680
And little by little, step by step, Optimus
Prime transforms himself literally, from a

00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:37.060
Mack Truck into a robot. So, I encourage you
to start doing something. Build on that. And

00:50:37.060 --> 00:50:41.609
once you're doing something, get a little
bit better at it each time and you'll start

00:50:41.609 --> 00:50:43.721
to see some results and hopefully start leveling
up your life.

00:50:43.721 --> 00:50:49.180
I guess we open up to questions now. Before
I get there, I just wanna say again guys,

00:50:49.180 --> 00:50:53.089
thank you so much for coming out. It's been
an absolute pleasure to be here at Google

00:50:53.089 --> 00:50:56.840
and probably one of the coolest things I've
ever done. I actually added this to my Epic

00:50:56.840 --> 00:51:03.490
Quest. I finally crossed this off today. So
thank you again for having me.

00:51:03.490 --> 00:51:04.490
[applause]

00:51:04.490 --> 00:51:16.020
I don't know if anybody has any questions.
Maybe, maybe not. I guess not. Yes. Sure.

00:51:16.020 --> 00:51:19.320
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: [ inaudible ]

00:51:19.320 --> 00:51:23.610
&gt;&gt;Steve Kamb: You know, it's funny you should
mention--. My dad, actually, growing up, my

00:51:23.610 --> 00:51:24.610
dad--. I'm sorry.

00:51:24.610 --> 00:51:25.610
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: [ inaudible ]

00:51:25.610 --> 00:51:30.580
&gt;&gt;Steve Kamb: Oh, sure. The questions was
thank you for reminding me. The question was

00:51:30.580 --> 00:51:34.730
a question about my parents and what my parents
have done since before starting Nerd Fitness

00:51:34.730 --> 00:51:37.181
and since then. Is that what you mean? Or
like growing up and--.

00:51:37.181 --> 00:51:40.643
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: Growing up and
then [ inaudible ].

00:51:40.643 --> 00:51:41.643
&gt;&gt;Steve Kamb: OK. So, growing up and through
then.

00:51:41.643 --> 00:51:42.800
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: [ inaudible].

00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:50.119
&gt;&gt;Steve Kamb: Sure. Absolutely. So, my parents
were never overweight. Never, never really

00:51:50.119 --> 00:51:54.210
overweight, but they both worked desk jobs
so they all had the same thing over the course

00:51:54.210 --> 00:51:57.380
of 20, 30 years of sitting behind a desk.

00:51:57.380 --> 00:52:02.920
My dad developed a little bit of a gut, like
every other guy that generally works at a

00:52:02.920 --> 00:52:09.600
desk and spends all his time there. And I
never told him to make any changes. And this

00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:15.730
is actually something that I have really come
to enjoy. I wanna say my dad is a big guy.

00:52:15.730 --> 00:52:23.400
He's six five. He weighs, I think at his biggest
he was probably 230, maybe 240.

00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:30.690
But he hadn't exercised in years up until
I started Nerd Fitness. And I never told him

00:52:30.690 --> 00:52:38.040
to make a change, but his diet wasn't the
cleanest. And he wasn't exercising a lot.

00:52:38.040 --> 00:52:41.510
And I was actually worried about him. I want
my dad to be around forever, like everybody

00:52:41.510 --> 00:52:43.470
does. And I was kind of worried about him.

00:52:43.470 --> 00:52:48.750
But my dad has been such an important figure
in my life, that how do you bring up something

00:52:48.750 --> 00:52:53.420
to your dad and say, "Hey dad. I need you
to start losing weight." And I didn't. Instead,

00:52:53.420 --> 00:52:58.980
I chose to try to inspire him through my actions.
And by that, I mean I never once brought up,

00:52:58.980 --> 00:53:00.720
"Hey Dad, you need to lose weight."

00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:05.359
It was more, "Hey Dad. Check out this article
I read." Or he made sure he was reading Nerd

00:53:05.359 --> 00:53:08.840
Fitness every day since then. I'd been very,
very lucky to have supportive parents throughout

00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:13.540
this whole thing. And since then, my dad has
actually been able to lose--I wanna say--between

00:53:13.540 --> 00:53:19.460
20 and 30 pounds through nothing I've requested,
but he started doing push-ups and started

00:53:19.460 --> 00:53:20.460
cleaning up his diet.

00:53:20.460 --> 00:53:24.310
And it's been cool to see that he emailed
me and said, "Hey, I've lost 12 pounds this

00:53:24.310 --> 00:53:29.600
year and I'm gonna lose another 12 next year."
Wow. Dad, that's awesome. I didn't ask it

00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:35.130
of him, but I really wanted it for him. So
it's been cool to see that progression happen.

00:53:35.130 --> 00:53:39.710
Same thing with my mom and also my sister.
My sister actually started strength training

00:53:39.710 --> 00:53:41.321
along with the Rebel Strength guide.

00:53:41.321 --> 00:53:45.400
It's the e-book I put out a couple months
back. And I saw a picture of her the other

00:53:45.400 --> 00:53:49.490
day. And I haven't seen her since I left for
my trip. Holy crap. You look great. And my

00:53:49.490 --> 00:53:52.150
sister, what she'd been doing, she'd been
strength training. She emailed me the other

00:53:52.150 --> 00:53:54.680
day and said, "Holy crap Steve. I did two
pull-ups."

00:53:54.680 --> 00:53:58.160
And this is my younger sister, who had never
been able to do a pull-up in her life. She

00:53:58.160 --> 00:54:02.840
said, "Hey Steve. I can finally do two pull-ups."
And that's awesome. Go for three. So now,

00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:08.810
my family has started to embrace this stuff
through not because I've asked them to, but

00:54:08.810 --> 00:54:12.270
because they've been inspired. But not only
what I've written about, but inspired by these

00:54:12.270 --> 00:54:17.920
stories and the people that have started popping
up in the blogs and in the message boards

00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:18.920
and stuff like that.

00:54:18.920 --> 00:54:25.070
So, my folks were never overweight, but they
were very typical Americans with a desk job.

00:54:25.070 --> 00:54:30.330
A gut to lose and some weight to drop and
something they never considered focusing on

00:54:30.330 --> 00:54:33.690
until Nerd Fitness finally started happening.
Yes.

00:54:33.690 --> 00:54:38.640
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #3: I have a nerdy
question.

00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:44.590
&gt;&gt;Steve Kamb: A nerdy question, yes. Absolutely.
I love it.

00:54:44.590 --> 00:54:45.590
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #3: Any particular
tools you'd want a person to look at for tracking

00:54:45.590 --> 00:54:46.590
and reporting progress?

00:54:46.590 --> 00:54:48.980
&gt;&gt;Steve Kamb: Absolutely. Tools that I recommend.
The question was any nerdy tools out there

00:54:48.980 --> 00:54:54.960
to recommend for progress? The best thing
that I found as far as keeping things digital

00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:59.880
was a website called dailyburn.com.

00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:03.210
And what it is, it's just a simple program
for you to keep track of what you're eating

00:55:03.210 --> 00:55:09.270
and your workouts. And you can put your weights
every time you measure it. And every time

00:55:09.270 --> 00:55:13.130
you weigh in, you put your weights in there.
And the reason I found it so great is because

00:55:13.130 --> 00:55:16.350
when I wanted to start building muscle, I
realized I wasn't eating enough.

00:55:16.350 --> 00:55:19.710
And for most people that wanna start losing
weight, they don't realize that they're eating

00:55:19.710 --> 00:55:24.980
too much. So I encourage them to sign up for
Daily Burn. Spend two to three days tracking

00:55:24.980 --> 00:55:29.390
their calories. And really keeping track of--.
And the reason Daily Burn makes it so easy

00:55:29.390 --> 00:55:34.590
is you can simply type in something like "strawberries"
or "Kit-Kat" or whatever.

00:55:34.590 --> 00:55:41.110
And it provides all statistics for it--the
carbs, grams of sugar, total calories, everything.

00:55:41.110 --> 00:55:44.430
And at the end of the day, you can look at
it and go, "Wow. I didn't realize I ate that

00:55:44.430 --> 00:55:47.869
much." Or, "Wow. I didn't realize I wasn't
eating enough or was eating enough protein

00:55:47.869 --> 00:55:53.970
and etc." And then on top of that as far as
tracking workouts, I love to use a program

00:55:53.970 --> 00:55:54.970
called Evernote.

00:55:54.970 --> 00:55:59.320
It's a simple app for my phone. And I'm sure
many of you have it where I just pull-up a

00:55:59.320 --> 00:56:06.520
document. I put the title and it'll say, "5/31,"
or "6/01" will say Mountain View, California.

00:56:06.520 --> 00:56:10.109
And I'll write down what I did. I started
out with a dynamic warm up and jump roped

00:56:10.109 --> 00:56:15.140
for five minutes to get my blood pumping.
Then I did this many push-ups with 90 seconds

00:56:15.140 --> 00:56:16.140
in-between each set.

00:56:16.140 --> 00:56:20.350
And then I did this many push-ups, so very
basic. I don't--. You can track it on Excel,

00:56:20.350 --> 00:56:26.000
if you're interested. If people wanna be more--.
Or Google Docs if you wanna be, keep in the

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:29.690
cloud like that. But for me, Evernote worked
out great 'cause I knew it would email it,

00:56:29.690 --> 00:56:35.160
or I could--. It would live in infinity. And
for me while traveling, I didn't have internet

00:56:35.160 --> 00:56:36.160
while traveling.

00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:40.260
All I had was Wi-Fi if I could find it here
and there. So my iPhone pretty much became

00:56:40.260 --> 00:56:45.280
a glorified iPod for four months while traveling,
so I never used the 3G service on it. So more

00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:48.950
me, Evernote worked out great 'cause I could
go track a workout, go back to the hostel

00:56:48.950 --> 00:56:53.440
or hotel I was staying in and it would upload
my document to Evernote so I could keep track

00:56:53.440 --> 00:56:56.250
of each of my workouts and compare them to
previous workouts.

00:56:56.250 --> 00:57:02.050
On top of that, there is a thing called an
Accu-Measure 3000, to measure your body fat

00:57:02.050 --> 00:57:05.930
percentage. Now, this is one of those things
where the most accurate methods are also some

00:57:05.930 --> 00:57:11.080
of the most expensive. You could do the hydrostatic
testing, where they float you in a tub, or

00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:14.250
they put you in a room where they can pressurize
the air and they can figure out your body

00:57:14.250 --> 00:57:15.250
fat percentage.

00:57:15.250 --> 00:57:18.990
For most people, that's just not realistic.
And it's also not something they're interested

00:57:18.990 --> 00:57:23.760
in doing. So, you can pick up one of these
body fat calipers for, I think it's like ten

00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:29.900
bucks online. And it's relatively accurate.
And the thing that's important about it is

00:57:29.900 --> 00:57:36.900
it might be off by a percentage point or two,
compared to the super complex advanced thing,

00:57:36.900 --> 00:57:39.710
like the hydrostatic testing.

00:57:39.710 --> 00:57:43.960
But as long as you're testing yourself in
the same spot and using the same tool on a

00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:50.920
bi-weekly basis, you can see that progress
is changing. So, I use an Accu-Measure body

00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:54.930
fat tester. And then also, just a simple tape
measure. They have ones that you just wrap

00:57:54.930 --> 00:57:59.750
around your arms. You can take measurements
of your chest, your navel, your waist, your

00:57:59.750 --> 00:58:04.230
hips, your thighs, to see if the weight is
coming off in the right spots.

00:58:04.230 --> 00:58:07.220
For most guys, they wanna keep the weight
up on their shoulders and chest, and lose

00:58:07.220 --> 00:58:11.170
it down in their gut. So, if you're taking
measurements and you know it's coming off

00:58:11.170 --> 00:58:14.941
in the right spots and you're tracking those
things. So, I'd say a combination of those

00:58:14.941 --> 00:58:18.460
four things, super basic. You can get a tape
measure for three bucks.

00:58:18.460 --> 00:58:24.660
Evernote is free and the body fat caliper,
which is tiny. It's this big. You pinch yourself,

00:58:24.660 --> 00:58:29.150
you read a chart, put your age in, and it's
relatively accurate. So between those things,

00:58:29.150 --> 00:58:33.599
you spent 15 bucks, you can track yourself
on a daily basis, or bi-weekly basis, depending

00:58:33.599 --> 00:58:35.869
on what you're interested in doing to get
some results out of it.

00:58:35.869 --> 00:58:44.500
So, those are the four I do recommend. One
more. Yes, sir. Go ahead. And I'll stick around

00:58:44.500 --> 00:58:49.520
for as long as you guys want, if you wanna
talk after this, for sure.

00:58:49.520 --> 00:58:51.890
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #4: [ inaudible ]

00:58:51.890 --> 00:58:53.310
&gt;&gt;Steve Kamb: Yes.

00:58:53.310 --> 00:58:55.680
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #4: [ inaudible ]

00:58:55.680 --> 00:58:57.099
&gt;&gt;Steve Kamb: Mm-hmm.

00:58:57.099 --> 00:59:00.420
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #4: I'm wondering [ inaudible
].

00:59:00.420 --> 00:59:05.820
&gt;&gt;Steve Kamb: You know, it depends. From what
I found--. Oh, to repeat the question people.

00:59:05.820 --> 00:59:10.500
The question was, do people, as Staci started
taking on strength training, do you see a

00:59:10.500 --> 00:59:12.680
lot of guys start taking on aerobic activity?

00:59:12.680 --> 00:59:16.230
And to be honest with you, I think most people
that's the natural progression, is they start

00:59:16.230 --> 00:59:20.401
with the aerobic stuff because that's the
easiest thing for them to grasp. They don't

00:59:20.401 --> 00:59:23.580
have a gym membership. They don't know how
to exercise, so the easiest thing for them

00:59:23.580 --> 00:59:26.950
to do is to put on a pair of running shoes
and go for a walk.

00:59:26.950 --> 00:59:31.740
So, they always start with the exercise and
maybe counting calories and making a couple

00:59:31.740 --> 00:59:35.530
adjustments there. There's definitely plenty
of folks that read Nerd Fitness that don't

00:59:35.530 --> 00:59:39.470
do any sort of strength training, but they
love to run. I try to push them towards strength

00:59:39.470 --> 00:59:43.181
training 'cause I'm personally biased. I think
that's such an important part of getting in

00:59:43.181 --> 00:59:44.181
shape.

00:59:44.181 --> 00:59:47.410
But there are plenty of folks that are in
great shape that run marathons that don't

00:59:47.410 --> 00:59:53.570
strength train that do that aerobic cardio
stuff. Absolutely. And as far as girls go,

00:59:53.570 --> 00:59:57.910
I think, I'm actually hoping to highlight
Staci more on the blog because she has such

00:59:57.910 --> 01:00:03.930
a great story to encourage more girls to wanna
start strength training, to show that you're

01:00:03.930 --> 01:00:06.430
not gonna get bulky and big, which is the
issue that all girls have.

01:00:06.430 --> 01:00:11.540
They pick up their five-pound pink dumbbells
and do bicep curls 'cause they're scared of

01:00:11.540 --> 01:00:16.460
getting too big. I'll tell you, Staci is dead
lifting 315 pounds, putting weight on, and

01:00:16.460 --> 01:00:20.900
looking better than she's ever looked before,
in better shape, healthier, happier than she's

01:00:20.900 --> 01:00:24.540
ever been before. So I think there's gonna
be a lot more crossover from the girls, hopefully

01:00:24.540 --> 01:00:26.210
to the strength training.

01:00:26.210 --> 01:00:29.020
And not even just weights, but maybe even
body weight type stuff. That's something they're

01:00:29.020 --> 01:00:35.070
getting into while still supplementing that
with running and things that still make them

01:00:35.070 --> 01:00:38.730
happy. If somebody runs, I don't tell them
to stop running. If it makes them happy, by

01:00:38.730 --> 01:00:42.940
all means, do it. The best exercise plan is
something that you're actually going to follow.

01:00:42.940 --> 01:00:46.310
So if you hate strength training and you love
running, by all means keep running. If you

01:00:46.310 --> 01:00:50.040
hate running and love strength training, keep
strength training. Don't--. Put you're focus

01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:55.500
on the stuff that you love and you'll find
a way to find some success with it. And I

01:00:55.500 --> 01:00:59.720
think we're out of time. So guys, thanks.
Everybody up there watching, thank you.

01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:02.480
And I guess we'll see you later. I am gonna
stick around for a while if anybody wants

01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:04.540
to talk. And I guess we'll go from there.
So, thanks.

01:01:04.540 --> 01:01:04.730
[applause]
