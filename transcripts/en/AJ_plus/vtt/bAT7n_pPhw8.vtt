00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.080
The day of the Muslim ban, there were

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:03.988
so many emotions that I was feeling.

00:00:03.988 --> 00:00:05.687
[News Clip]: "President
Trump is defending "

00:00:05.687 --> 00:00:07.478
"a temporary travel ban for seven"

00:00:07.478 --> 00:00:08.929
"Muslim majority countries."

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:10.828
I thought about my family,

00:00:10.828 --> 00:00:12.580
who's had seven Marines

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.161
that served in Iraq and Afghanistan,

00:00:15.161 --> 00:00:16.962
the New York Police Department;

00:00:16.962 --> 00:00:20.060
how this was a betrayal to their service

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.430
to this nation.

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.405
A Muslim ban that basically said,

00:00:23.405 --> 00:00:26.597
"You are not welcome here
because you are Yemeni."

00:00:28.602 --> 00:00:30.207
I consider myself

00:00:30.207 --> 00:00:31.760
one of those people

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.630
who's been put on the face of the earth

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:34.940
to be a change agent.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.610
"No hate no fear."

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.290
"Our country was built on
the backs of immigrants."

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:40.880
The day of the Muslim ban,

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.662
I organized an emergency meeting

00:00:42.662 --> 00:00:44.920
with the Yemeni-American community.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.690
They were so outraged.

00:00:46.882 --> 00:00:49.582
When Yemeni-Americans
migrated to New York,

00:00:49.582 --> 00:00:52.040
they landed at Brooklyn Borough Hall.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.667
Many of them then went
off to open up stores

00:00:54.667 --> 00:00:56.814
which are now called "bodegas".

00:00:56.814 --> 00:00:59.930
There are between four
to six thousand bodegas

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.882
across New York City
owned by Yemeni-Americans.

00:01:03.882 --> 00:01:06.945
They never, ever were interested
in challenging government,

00:01:06.945 --> 00:01:09.510
but the Muslim ban woke them up.

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.346
They felt that they
needed to take a stand.

00:01:12.346 --> 00:01:15.047
And so, Zaid, a fellow
Yemeni-American, said,

00:01:15.047 --> 00:01:16.397
"Why don't we do a strike?"

00:01:16.397 --> 00:01:18.210
"Close about two hundred stores."

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.440
I said, "Okay so when do
you guys want to do this?"

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.520
And he said, "Thursday."

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.740
I was like, "What?"

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:23.815
We had four days.

00:01:23.815 --> 00:01:25.544
(upbeat music)

00:01:26.777 --> 00:01:29.920
My media head starts thinking
about this and I'm like,

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.175
"If you really want to
send a strong message,"

00:01:32.175 --> 00:01:35.733
"you close a thousand
stores and we hold a rally."

00:01:35.733 --> 00:01:38.534
I called up the Borough
President, Eric Adams.

00:01:38.534 --> 00:01:40.140
"Eric, I need your help."

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.449
"It has to be Brooklyn Borough Hall."

00:01:43.449 --> 00:01:45.575
He's like, "Okay, that's
cutting it really close."

00:01:45.575 --> 00:01:47.597
And I was like, "What's going on that day?

00:01:47.597 --> 00:01:48.430
They're like,

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.392
"We have the Chinese New Year
event happening that night."

00:01:51.392 --> 00:01:53.187
I called back Zaid and he said,

00:01:53.187 --> 00:01:54.440
"Brooklyn Borough Hall?"

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.037
And I was like, "Yes" and he was like,

00:01:56.037 --> 00:01:57.795
"Wow, that's really big."

00:01:57.795 --> 00:02:00.626
We made over a thousand posters

00:02:00.626 --> 00:02:02.409
and we distributed to the stores

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:05.566
and the store owners
pasted it on their windows:

00:02:05.566 --> 00:02:07.811
"We're closing from 12:00 to 8:00 pm."

00:02:07.811 --> 00:02:10.490
They were literally delivering posters

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.567
as late as Thursday 3:00 am.

00:02:14.567 --> 00:02:17.414
We were talking about who was going to MC,

00:02:17.414 --> 00:02:18.840
and they're like, "You're gonna MC."

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:19.970
"What do you mean, 'who's gonna MC'?"

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:20.960
"You're MCing this."

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.249
I was like, "Oh, my God."

00:02:23.391 --> 00:02:27.530
The day of the rally, it is
freezing cold in the plaza.

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.890
At 12 o'clock, the stores shut down.

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.480
- [News Clip] "Yemeni owners of bodegas"

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.999
"across the city closing
up shop at 12 noon."

00:02:36.041 --> 00:02:37.780
There were two bodegas,

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.030
they never close their doors, never.

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.150
When they went to lock the doors,

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.961
the lock fell apart.

00:02:43.961 --> 00:02:45.932
12:30, I get a call:

00:02:45.932 --> 00:02:48.609
"Debbie, what time did
you tell people to come?"

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:50.360
- And I said, "4:30."

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.930
He's like, "Debbie, we
have fifty people outside."

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.557
The numbers just kept growing.

00:02:55.557 --> 00:02:58.527
At 1:30, Stefan calls me again,

00:02:58.527 --> 00:03:01.057
"There are five hundred people outside!"

00:03:01.057 --> 00:03:05.530
"People are hanging off
the fringe of the flags."

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.116
(crowd yelling)

00:03:07.116 --> 00:03:09.162
I finally make my way there

00:03:09.162 --> 00:03:10.516
at 3:00 O'clock.

00:03:10.516 --> 00:03:14.065
And all I see is a sea of people,

00:03:14.065 --> 00:03:17.152
I was like, "Oh, my God,
how did this happen?"

00:03:17.152 --> 00:03:19.003
"Did we really do this?"

00:03:20.828 --> 00:03:22.514
Close to six thousand people.

00:03:22.514 --> 00:03:26.628
Young, old, American
flags swinging everywhere.

00:03:26.628 --> 00:03:29.120
This is (in Arabic) Borough Hall.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.092
Borough Hall for the Yemenis!

00:03:30.092 --> 00:03:33.673
[Debbie]: "You should
be absolutely proud!"

00:03:33.673 --> 00:03:35.587
We were covered by the 'New York Times',

00:03:35.587 --> 00:03:36.812
by 'Slate',

00:03:36.812 --> 00:03:38.490
'LA Times'.

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:41.070
Every media outlet covered us.

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.330
[Crowd]: "This is what
democracy looks like!"

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.117
My eyes swelled with tears

00:03:45.117 --> 00:03:48.137
and I felt so much pride

00:03:48.137 --> 00:03:52.584
to see my community actually
take a political stand.

00:03:52.584 --> 00:03:55.515
[Debbie]: "You are powerful!"

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.440
We took that energy and
formed the Yemeni-American

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.655
Merchants Association to
make sure they have a voice

00:04:01.655 --> 00:04:03.738
and a place at the table.

00:04:03.744 --> 00:04:07.098
And to say, "This sleeping
giant is no longer sleeping."
