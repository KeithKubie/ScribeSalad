00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.148
So, how do these different sequences result in different traits, like for

00:00:04.148 --> 00:00:07.269
example you have blue eyes and I have brown?

00:00:07.269 --> 00:00:10.899
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Right, so obviously not everyone has the same genetic sequence for every gene,

00:00:10.899 --> 00:00:15.892
the stuff that codes for us. Now, in the example of eye color, the eye color

00:00:15.892 --> 00:00:19.865
gene can come in different versions. Now, in genetics, we have a word for this

00:00:19.865 --> 00:00:23.904
and it's called and allele. So, you could have the sequence that codes for

00:00:23.904 --> 00:00:28.300
brown eyes and we would call that the brown allele or the brown version.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.234
Alternatively, you could have the sequence that codes for blue eyes. We call

00:00:32.234 --> 00:00:35.760
this the blue allele or the blue version of the gene. Now, if we carry this out

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.162
in an experiment, like a thought experiment, where you get one brown allele

00:00:39.162 --> 00:00:42.672
from one parent and another brown allele from another parent, what color eyes

00:00:42.672 --> 00:00:46.790
do you think the children are going to have?

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:47.330
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Brown.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.859
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Right. They're going to have brown. So, it's pretty simple. We could also do

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:53.900
the experiment with the blue alleles. If you get one blue allele from mom and

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.610
one blue allele from dad, what color eyes do you think you're going to have? &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Blue.

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.065
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; You're going to have blue. But it gets interesting when we have to figure out

00:01:01.065 --> 00:01:03.810
what happens in the mixed situation, where you get a brown allele from one

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:08.528
parent and a blue allele from another parent. In this case, what color eyes do

00:01:08.528 --> 00:01:10.760
you think the children are going to have?

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.380
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I don't know, why don't you answer this one.
