It will take Anjali 55 days.

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:11.643
So our algebraic proportion is 650
over 5 is equivalent to 7,150 over x.

00:00:11.643 --> 00:00:18.113
After cross multiplying we get
650 times x = 5 times 7,150.

00:00:18.113 --> 00:00:24.309
5 times 7,150 is 35,750.

00:00:24.309 --> 00:00:28.600
Divide both sides by 650 to isolate x.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.713
And 35,750 divided by
650 is equal to 55.

00:00:33.713 --> 00:00:37.379
So x = 55.
