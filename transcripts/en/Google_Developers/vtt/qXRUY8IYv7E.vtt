BILL LUAN: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.670
So Chris, the first
question for you.

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.710
Since you have on your title
page that you mentioned,

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.070
now is the most exciting time.

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.480
Given that you're the vice
president, over charge a lot

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.100
of product development, you
also, on behalf of Google,

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.930
announced a lot of new features.

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.350
You had Google IO,
many other events.

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.685
In your personal view,
what do you think

00:01:49.685 --> 00:01:52.210
are the most exciting
things for you

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.830
in terms of you looking at
all the past announcements,

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:56.900
features.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.570
Among all those, what's the
most interesting to you?

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.570
CHRIS YERGA: Well, I think
new device categories

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.190
like Android Wear,
and Android TV,

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.720
and automotive are
certainly very interesting.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.030
But actually, the thing
that excites me the most

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.260
is not necessarily the
flashy, new hardware products.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.550
I'm excited about
much of the stuff

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.220
that Brahim just finished
talking about in terms

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.640
of expanding payments for Play.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.770
Recently, we've done things like
launching new, direct carrier

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.200
billing integrations in the
Philippines and Thailand,

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.300
and launching gift cards in
places like Hong Kong or Korea.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.330
And I think that
work that we focus

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:51.210
on tirelessly all the time, it's
not necessarily as glamorous

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:52.840
as some of the new
product launches.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.060
But it's really exciting to
me, because with every new form

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.310
of payment we add in
a country, it benefits

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.290
all of the developers
on Google Play,

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:09.720
because we are a global market
having users in Southeast Asia,

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.050
or Russia, or new
places like that,

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.470
increases a number of
places that you can sell

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.030
your applications and games.

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:24.420
And that work is very important
and one that actually, I

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.015
get the most excited by.

00:03:26.015 --> 00:03:29.070
BILL LUAN: Thank you, Chris.

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.880
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.280
Ellie, since you are the
product manager for Google Play

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.350
operations, there are a couple
of questions, very good,

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:11.730
in terms of the
features we have in Play

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.650
that enable the
developers interacting

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.180
with their customers.

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.790
So two of the questions, which
I think they interlink together.

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:25.170
One is whether we can consider,
allowing the developers to use

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:28.570
their control panel,
to have direct access

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.680
to their customers.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.270
And number two, whether they
can even allow the control panel

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:40.470
to export their engagement
with the customer

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.840
so that they can do
more data analysis,

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.930
can do more follow up.

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.470
And my related question
to that is, in the past,

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.270
Google probably considered
that in the past,

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.250
if there's a reason
not to do so, and why.

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.610
So probably you're the best
person to elaborate on that.

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:04.200
So again, control panel using
that to engage with customers.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.050
ELLIE POWERS: So I actually have
some good news for those of you

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:10.890
who have used the Google Play
Developer Console in the past.

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:12.720
Over time this
year, we've actually

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.400
been doing a lot
of work to make it

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.360
possible to export
all the different data

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.900
types from the Google
Play Developer Console.

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.150
So we had some
launches recently.

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.920
So you can actually export
your statistics, your crashes.

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:30.650
And you actually can export all
of your user reviews, as well.

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:34.270
If you go to
support.google.com, there's

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:36.730
basically a help article
that you can pull up

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:40.100
that gives you directions
on how to use this using

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:42.390
a utility that we
have called gsutil

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:45.780
so that again, allows you to
export all of your user reviews

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:47.690
using this utility.

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:51.010
And then you'll be able to do
whatever analysis that you want

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:52.350
to do with them after that.

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:53.766
It was something
that was recently

00:05:53.766 --> 00:05:55.150
launched on Google Play.

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:57.050
So we're pretty
excited about it.

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.040
And just one quick tip for
everybody in the audience.

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.690
On the left hand side of the
Google Play Developer Console,

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:04.910
there is a little icon.

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:06.694
It looks like a megaphone.

00:06:06.694 --> 00:06:08.110
And that's where
you can go to see

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:09.890
announcements of new features.

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:11.860
We also announced some
of our bigger features

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:16.470
on the Google Developer's
blog, as well.

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:18.660
Another common
question that we had

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:22.164
asked just now about how we're
replying to reviews works.

00:06:22.164 --> 00:06:23.830
I'll give a little
bit more information,

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:26.600
because this is one of the most
common questions that we get.

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.620
So when a user leaves a review
on the Google Play Store,

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:31.720
the developer can respond
through the Google Play

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.050
Developer Console.

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:34.820
But what you may
not know actually

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:36.260
is what happens after that.

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.710
So we actually sent an email
notification to the user,

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:41.550
letting them know that the
developer has responded.

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:43.790
We provide the user with
the developer's email

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:46.510
address and let them know
that they can either contact

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:48.810
the developer directly
using that email address,

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:51.200
or by replying to
the mail, or they

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:55.500
can go and update their review
on Google Play if they want to.

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:58.200
So we don't disclose the
user's email addresses

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:01.080
to the developers, but we do
disclose the developer's email

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:02.100
addresses to the users.

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:04.480
So if users choose
to, they can engage

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.720
in a one on one conversation
with the developer.

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.910
But for privacy
reasons, we don't

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:10.950
share the individual
user's email addresses

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:11.942
with the developer.

00:07:11.942 --> 00:07:13.400
So we think that
this is a good way

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:17.570
to balance privacy, as well as
a desire for direct interaction.

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:19.007
Some users do check their email.

00:07:19.007 --> 00:07:20.590
They do receive these
emails, and they

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:22.120
do choose to reply to them.

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.710
Other users don't.

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:26.510
So I think you'll sometimes
find that some users will want

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:29.010
to talk with you one on
one, and others don't.

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:32.260
If you do you want users to
reach out to you directly,

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:33.760
when you reply to
their reviews, you

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:37.200
can mention that if they'd like
to have more of a conversation,

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:39.650
that this is their email
address that they can use,

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:41.982
or the website that
they can go to to get

00:07:41.982 --> 00:07:43.190
more direct support from you.

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:46.990
BILL LUAN: Thank you.

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:49.060
The next speaker is Kevin.

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:53.100
So since Kevin's talking
about discoverability,

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:56.720
the question for you is do
you have further comments,

00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:03.290
the discoverability of the
apps on Play changed over time

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:05.940
from your experience,
your observations?

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:08.380
Do you have any further
comment on that?

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:10.380
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:39.799
KEVIN CHIAO: So I always
think about discoverability

00:08:39.799 --> 00:08:45.330
as the holy grail of
the whole app ecosystem.

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:48.580
If you think about the most
important things we just all

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:50.810
covered today, I
always called it

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:56.050
the three R's, which is
reach, retention, and revenue.

00:08:56.050 --> 00:08:57.540
Other than making
a great product,

00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:00.080
you need to worry about
how do I get more users,

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.750
how do I keep them in my game,
and how do I make money off

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:03.520
of them?

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:05.970
If you think about what we
talked about this morning,

00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:08.770
it's that whole story.

00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:10.210
I talked about the reach.

00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:11.890
Ellie talked about
the retention.

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:13.510
Brahim talked about the revenue.

00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:15.420
How do we make more money?

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:17.440
And I used to be a
developer myself,

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:20.690
so I know how difficult
user acquisition can be.

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:23.050
And I think from
a lot of people,

00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:26.760
because I started out
in the Apple ecosystem

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:30.280
doing a lot of user acquisition
there and trying to get

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:31.480
to the top of the charts.

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:34.200
And I realize every
day I would wake up,

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:36.920
and I would just
Apple R on my computer

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:38.950
and refresh the charts.

00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:40.340
And I'm sure a
lot of you guys do

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:42.510
this where you wake up every--
you just refresh the charts.

00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:43.690
You're like, where am I?

00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:46.035
And you're like, I
just went from like 50

00:09:46.035 --> 00:09:46.910
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:53.810
But it doesn't necessarily
correlate to more installs

00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:56.060
or more revenue.

00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:58.640
It's just an arbitrary
chart in a lot of ways

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:03.450
that people, for some reason,
they'll slave over it.

00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:06.240
And they'll spend hundreds
and hundreds of thousands,

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:10.090
of millions of dollars to get
to the top of these charts.

00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:14.790
And so over time, you've seen
discoverability change a lot

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:16.840
in the ecosystem, especially
because Google Play

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:18.940
has gotten a lot larger.

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:22.290
If you think about
two, three years ago,

00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:23.740
Google Play's still very young.

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:26.281
And when it all started out--
I don't know if any of you guys

00:10:26.281 --> 00:10:30.060
saw the videos earlier, but they
showed the Android marketplace,

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:31.289
the first UI.

00:10:31.289 --> 00:10:33.080
And I don't know if
you guys remember that.

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:34.989
But I remember that
from a developer's side.

00:10:34.989 --> 00:10:36.655
And I was like, why
would anyone develop

00:10:36.655 --> 00:10:41.150
for this, because I was making
90% of my revenue on Apple.

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:43.920
But over time, that
has always changed.

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:45.760
And now, as Google
Play continues to grow,

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:47.670
as of revenue, the
retention, and we

00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:51.620
bring all these great
resources for everyone here,

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:54.410
the discovery piece
means so much more.

00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:57.230
But it's not just about
being on the top charts.

00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:59.720
If you actually
look at the data,

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:02.324
search is the largest
for Google Play.

00:11:02.324 --> 00:11:04.240
We are a search company,
so we should at least

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:05.710
get that part right.

00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:09.050
So when it comes
to all of this, you

00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:11.660
can sit there and spend
hundreds of thousands

00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:14.430
of dollars on user
acquisition to try to get

00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:16.210
to the top of the charts.

00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:18.170
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:20.990
This is like spam installs.

00:11:20.990 --> 00:11:23.820
They use fake installs to
get to the top of the charts.

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:26.040
But it doesn't help
you in any way.

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:28.040
It might just get you to
the top of the charts.

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:29.710
But the things we
just talked about,

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:31.207
getting real users
into your game,

00:11:31.207 --> 00:11:33.040
or getting real users
to discover your game,

00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:36.000
getting them to retain, getting
them to make revenue-- this

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.200
won't happen just
off of top charts.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.340
If you think about the
history of how all of this

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:45.300
has happened, what I really
want people to take away

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:48.920
is that everything we're
sharing with you today,

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:51.130
you get to the top of
the charts these days,

00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:52.960
because you've done
everything right.

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:54.520
You've looked at your users.

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:56.920
You've built a strong community.

00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:58.270
You go to regions.

00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:00.060
You localize your listings.

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:03.182
You have very, very strong
community in that area.

00:12:03.182 --> 00:12:05.640
And we'll talk more about that
today in a lot of the panels

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:06.840
that we'll be on.

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:09.490
And I really hope that we can
share more about that with you

00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:12.980
guys further down the road.

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:14.895
BILL LUAN: Thank you Kevin.

00:12:14.895 --> 00:12:16.260
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.775
They like your answer.

00:12:18.775 --> 00:12:21.180
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:56.480
So a question for [INAUDIBLE]
about the different list

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:59.550
of four different
ads models that you

00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:00.940
talked about this morning.

00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:06.480
For a global market, due to the
differences in culture, custom,

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:11.460
behavior, and so on, from you
and your team's observations

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:13.360
from any past data,
where's anything

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:16.830
you could comment on
due to the culture

00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:19.230
differences, the
custom behavior.

00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:22.470
Which one of those models
will be most successful

00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:25.440
that you would recommend
among our attendees

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:30.300
today if they want to go global
to help them to be successful?

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:32.800
Which one should
to be used first?

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:35.285
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:42.130
MALE SPEAKER:
[NON ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:02.890
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:04.464
BILL LUAN: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:17:32.850 --> 00:17:34.700
That's like a food chain.

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:36.760
[NON ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:45.995
So Bryan, you talked about
monetize opportunities

00:17:45.995 --> 00:17:47.970
on Play this morning.

00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:50.320
And since a lot of
topics we covered

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:52.380
are so far, including
doing the Q&amp;A,

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:54.420
all the other speakers
are talking about things

00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:57.840
that you should do to help
you be more successful.

00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:59.730
However, the question
about monetizing,

00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:02.770
one of the good questions
raised is actually the reverse.

00:18:02.770 --> 00:18:06.270
What are the things that you
should not do which if you do,

00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:08.275
will prevent you to
be less successful,

00:18:08.275 --> 00:18:11.290
or prevent you to be more
successful, causing you to be

00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:13.860
less successful in monetizing?

00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:15.950
The second question
is rather frank

00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:17.780
and a straightforward,
tough question--

00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:20.654
why does Google Payments
sometimes seem so slow?

00:18:20.654 --> 00:18:22.570
And I believe you have
a good answer for that.

00:18:22.570 --> 00:18:25.370
So these questions, on to you.

00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:27.400
BRAHIM ELBOUCHIKHI: Thank you.

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:31.030
So we've talked a lot
about what you should do,

00:18:31.030 --> 00:18:32.570
and that is great.

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:34.370
But I think obviously,
all of those inverse

00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:35.536
are things you shouldn't do.

00:18:35.536 --> 00:18:39.350
But a couple of tactical
items that we hear a lot about

00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:44.470
is, for example, there are a lot
of boilerplate implementations

00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:46.930
of our in-app billing APIs.

00:18:46.930 --> 00:18:50.530
And lots of developers would
actually take that and just

00:18:50.530 --> 00:18:53.680
drop it in their app as a
standard implementation.

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:55.630
And what ends up
happening is a lot

00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:57.770
of users actually
make purchases.

00:18:57.770 --> 00:19:00.010
And they don't receive the
item they just purchased,

00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:02.220
for some reason or the other.

00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:04.980
This is our number one
driver for support tickets.

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:08.337
And actually, it just creates
such a bad experience,

00:19:08.337 --> 00:19:09.920
because someone just
literally decided

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:11.580
to spend their money with you.

00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:14.630
And they didn't get that
good they just purchased.

00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:16.420
And a lot of times,
they find this

00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:18.750
is because of these kind
of copy/paste errors

00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:21.080
where there are some
implementations out there.

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:23.310
They aren't good, and
so they get dropped,

00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:25.750
and they get reiterated,
implemented over, and over,

00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:26.450
and over.

00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:28.156
And so it's somewhat
a simple fix,

00:19:28.156 --> 00:19:29.530
because implementation's
actually

00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:31.400
pretty straightforward.

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:36.460
But this causes lots of your
users to have a bad experience

00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:39.070
and then request
refunds, et cetera.

00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:43.730
So this is a tactical thing
that I would love for everyone

00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:46.110
to just go look and
implement right,

00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:50.140
especially as you all are
embarking in that journey now.

00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:53.840
The second point which
I've heard a lot about

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:58.639
is around game mechanics, and
how or even app mechanics.

00:19:58.639 --> 00:20:00.180
How do you build an
experience that's

00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:03.390
welcoming, so that
the user actually

00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:05.230
gets enough of an
experience that they're

00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:07.760
willing to then spend?

00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:12.610
Too often, we hear immediately,
a lot of developers

00:20:12.610 --> 00:20:16.555
build apps that immediately
try to monetize the user.

00:20:16.555 --> 00:20:17.930
Maybe they get
through one level,

00:20:17.930 --> 00:20:20.020
and then they start
hitting those roadblocks.

00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:22.700
And you can see this in the
reviews for these apps, where

00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:25.880
users will say,
monetizing aggressively,

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:29.750
or can't really play, or need
to spend way too much money

00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:31.370
to progress.

00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:35.080
And this is a matter of
patience and actually

00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:38.430
building an app that welcomes
the user, actually gives them

00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:41.520
a really great
immersive experience,

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:43.780
and then try to monetize it.

00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:49.260
So that's a fundamental way
of building your app possibly.

00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:51.290
But it could make a
significant difference

00:20:51.290 --> 00:20:52.250
in your monetization.

00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:55.710
So those two tactical,
slash long term things

00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:58.600
I would like to talk about.

00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:01.200
I'm assuming there are
two aspects too slow.

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:03.370
I'm not sure which one
we're talking about.

00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:08.500
One is literally latency
of the purchase experience.

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:12.590
And over the past year, actually
about a year or plus ago,

00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:14.430
we launched an entirely
new implementation

00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:18.760
for our purchase flow, which
had three things in mind.

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:21.000
One is simplicity.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.500
Two is keeping the user in
context of your application,

00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:26.300
and three was latency.

00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:29.240
And we actually cut latency
at the time by over 40%,

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:31.800
and in some markets here
in Asia, by more than that.

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:34.170
So latency, very
technically, is something

00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:36.270
that we are obsessed about.

00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:39.430
We know that it is
not perfect yet,

00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:41.940
but we have teams that are
working on making that better.

00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:44.830
The other part of slow
that I wasn't sure about

00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:47.070
is launching, new
forms of payment,

00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:48.910
and expanding our reach.

00:21:48.910 --> 00:21:53.750
And that aspect
goes back to what

00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:55.637
I mentioned earlier
about payments

00:21:55.637 --> 00:21:57.970
being one of the key value-adds
that we delivere to you,

00:21:57.970 --> 00:21:59.850
in addition to distribution.

00:21:59.850 --> 00:22:02.450
Payments are really difficult.

00:22:02.450 --> 00:22:04.140
I've worked on it
for three years.

00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:07.210
We have large teams of people
that are working specifically

00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:07.990
on this problem.

00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:09.760
It is just difficult.

00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:13.190
For example, when you launch
a payment service in Brazil,

00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:16.530
you need to have 24/7
support in Portuguese.

00:22:16.530 --> 00:22:19.670
So setting up those sorts of
operations in brand new markets

00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:21.350
is incredibly difficult.

00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:23.350
Of course, going to the
regulatory and licensing

00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:24.740
aspects is difficult.

00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:26.850
Of course, I'm not
trying to find excuses.

00:22:26.850 --> 00:22:28.670
But payments are difficult.

00:22:28.670 --> 00:22:31.800
This is what we believe,
that Google Play offers you

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:35.980
a great platform for reaching
buyers in 130 markets plus,

00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:38.600
and you're not having
to worry about that.

00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:41.070
So that, in a way,
is our value add.

00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:43.130
But we do realize that
we can move faster,

00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:48.490
and we are, to use the term,
doubling down on payments

00:22:48.490 --> 00:22:51.260
and making sure that we can
move even faster over the coming

00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:53.930
year or so.

00:22:53.930 --> 00:22:56.830
I don't want to do whichever it
was, but those are the answers.

00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:57.595
Thank you.

00:22:57.595 --> 00:22:59.036
BILL LUAN: Thank you, Brahim.

00:22:59.036 --> 00:23:00.180
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:02.850
So due to time
limitations we're going

00:23:02.850 --> 00:23:06.180
to end our Q&amp;A, because it's
about time for everybody

00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:07.200
to have lunch.

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:09.200
So please put your
hands together,

thanking all of our
speakers for their answers.
