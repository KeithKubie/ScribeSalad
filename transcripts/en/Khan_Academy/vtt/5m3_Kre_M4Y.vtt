00:00:01.625 --> 00:00:03.765
- After I've done my homework,
after I've learned all day,

00:00:03.765 --> 00:00:06.243
the one thing I want to
do is just make music.

00:00:06.243 --> 00:00:09.487
My car is the number one place
where I can just sit there

00:00:09.487 --> 00:00:12.304
and make the music
right there in my hands.

00:00:12.304 --> 00:00:16.202
At least until I run outta gas or battery.

00:00:16.202 --> 00:00:18.251
The SAT is extremely
important when it comes

00:00:18.251 --> 00:00:20.495
to getting into college.

00:00:20.495 --> 00:00:23.003
You can never be too
prepared for something.

00:00:23.003 --> 00:00:24.140
Like if you're trying to learn a song

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:25.513
and you wanna perform it to people,

00:00:25.513 --> 00:00:27.173
ultimately you don't
want to go over it once

00:00:27.173 --> 00:00:28.429
and be like alright, I'm ready.

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:30.474
You should always put time and practice

00:00:30.474 --> 00:00:31.940
into anything you do.

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:33.037
Not only are you prepared,

00:00:33.037 --> 00:00:35.205
you also feel confident
in what you're doing.

00:00:35.205 --> 00:00:36.256
If you want to become anything

00:00:36.256 --> 00:00:38.192
there's a correct step you need to take.

00:00:38.192 --> 00:00:40.973
It's always baby steps and
it's always practicing.

00:00:40.973 --> 00:00:44.089
I want to make something that
people can really connect with

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:46.228
and to be able to do that for a living.

00:00:46.228 --> 00:00:48.432
I feel a lot more confident

00:00:48.432 --> 00:00:50.709
doing things that I've practiced for.

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:51.578
You don't want to do something

00:00:51.578 --> 00:00:55.745
that you haven't taken the
time to really get down.
