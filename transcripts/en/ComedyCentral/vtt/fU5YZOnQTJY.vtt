00:00:01.034 --> 00:00:02.402
It's been harder for Trump to

00:00:02.402 --> 00:00:03.303
find people to perform at his

00:00:03.303 --> 00:00:04.438
inauguration than it is to find

00:00:04.438 --> 00:00:05.239
people to perform in his

00:00:05.239 --> 00:00:06.306
administration.

00:00:06.306 --> 00:00:07.841
A number of acts have refused,

00:00:07.841 --> 00:00:09.610
or outright canceled, uh, and

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:10.711
those who are performing are

00:00:10.711 --> 00:00:11.712
gearing up for what will

00:00:11.712 --> 00:00:13.213
probably be their last ever

00:00:13.213 --> 00:00:14.948
appearance onstage.

00:00:14.948 --> 00:00:17.618
See ya in hell Three Doors Down.

00:00:17.618 --> 00:00:18.852
Now, this is actually a picture

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:20.220
of the '70s band Thee Dog Night,

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.355
but we don't know what Three

00:00:21.355 --> 00:00:23.590
Doors Down looks like, so...

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.460
We just... that's what we had.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.794
But the performers that do sign

00:00:27.794 --> 00:00:28.829
up for their moment in the

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:29.930
freezing January sun will

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:30.998
probably be treated like royalty

00:00:30.998 --> 00:00:32.266
for a few minutes.

00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:33.400
So comedians, I want you to give

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.068
me some items or demands that

00:00:35.068 --> 00:00:36.503
you might find on a Trump

00:00:36.503 --> 00:00:37.771
inaugural performers backstage

00:00:37.771 --> 00:00:39.173
rider agreement.

00:00:39.173 --> 00:00:40.807
Uh, Dave Anthony.

00:00:40.807 --> 00:00:42.943
&gt;&gt; The ability to feel shame.

00:00:42.943 --> 00:00:44.545
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: All right, points.

00:00:44.545 --> 00:00:45.546
Posehn.

00:00:45.546 --> 00:00:46.914
&gt;&gt; Crisp white sheets.

00:00:46.914 --> 00:00:48.348
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: All right, points.

00:00:48.348 --> 00:00:49.349
Stephanie.

00:00:49.349 --> 00:00:50.417
&gt;&gt; Some Mexican food with a wall

00:00:50.417 --> 00:00:51.418
built around it.

00:00:51.418 --> 00:00:53.487
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: All right, points.

00:00:53.487 --> 00:00:54.488
Posehn.

00:00:54.488 --> 00:00:55.856
&gt;&gt; A fourth door down.

00:00:55.856 --> 00:00:57.491
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: All right, points.

00:00:57.491 --> 00:00:58.559
Anthony.

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.327
&gt;&gt; A bowl of grabable pussies.

00:01:00.327 --> 00:01:01.828
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: All right, points.

00:01:01.828 --> 00:01:03.597
Grabable... Stephanie.

00:01:03.597 --> 00:01:05.165
&gt;&gt; A gift basket of ammo and

00:01:05.165 --> 00:01:06.366
Keystone Light.

00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:07.601
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: All right, points.

00:01:07.601 --> 00:01:09.403
Oh, a winning combination.

00:01:09.403 --> 00:01:10.504
Brian Posehn.

00:01:10.504 --> 00:01:12.039
&gt;&gt; A scientist, so you can burn

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:13.540
him with cigarettes.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:14.942
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: Points.

00:01:14.942 --> 00:01:15.943
Stephanie.

00:01:15.943 --> 00:01:17.444
&gt;&gt; A copy of the Constitution

00:01:17.444 --> 00:01:19.546
and someone who can read.

00:01:19.546 --> 00:01:20.948
&gt;&gt; HARDWICK: Ah, points.

00:01:20.948 --> 00:01:22.282
Very good.

00:01:22.282 --> 00:01:24.651
And Mr. Brian Posehn.

00:01:24.651 --> 00:01:26.053
&gt;&gt; A dumb red hat with a stupid

00:01:26.053 --> 00:01:26.820
fucking thing on it.
