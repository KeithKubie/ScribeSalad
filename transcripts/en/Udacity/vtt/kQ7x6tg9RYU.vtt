00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.091
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; In general form we just have all the variable terms on one side, and then a

00:00:04.091 --> 00:00:08.145
constant term on the other side. The only change we need to make to this

00:00:08.145 --> 00:00:12.503
equation then is to get the term with the x onto the left side of the equation.

00:00:12.503 --> 00:00:16.395
We just need to add 5 x to both sides, and we get 5 x plus 4 y equals 51.
