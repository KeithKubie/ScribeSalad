00:00:00.066 --> 00:00:03.866
&gt;&gt;Darling-Hammond: Being aware
of the fact that every child is

00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:07.266
on their own developmental pathway
and will need different supports

00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:11.696
and scaffolds is part of what the
teacher needs to be able to do.

00:00:12.106 --> 00:00:16.366
&gt;&gt;Cantor: We don't only want to be
talking the kids that disrupt a class,

00:00:16.366 --> 00:00:21.556
which is very often the case, we want
to talk about every child and be able

00:00:21.766 --> 00:00:23.676
to see what every child needs.

00:00:30.796 --> 00:00:32.166
&gt;&gt;Shaddox: Once a week we meet

00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:35.356
to discuss student behavior
and student academics.

00:00:35.496 --> 00:00:37.346
&gt;&gt;All right, Paula's going
to roll through the deck.

00:00:39.536 --> 00:00:44.176
&gt;&gt;One strategy we utilize is a deck of
cards that contain each student's name.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.276
&gt;&gt;Paula: Jeffrey? 
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Yes.

00:00:46.356 --> 00:00:49.526
&gt;&gt;Shaddox: Paula reads their name aloud
and we take a moment to just consider

00:00:49.526 --> 00:00:50.906
if we need to speak about the student.

00:00:51.246 --> 00:00:55.316
And if it is a student we want
to discuss, she pulls that card,

00:00:55.316 --> 00:00:56.676
she puts it in another pile.

00:00:56.836 --> 00:00:58.666
These are students that we
might have concerns about

00:00:58.736 --> 00:01:00.776
or they could be students
that we want to highlight.

00:01:08.206 --> 00:01:11.836
&gt;&gt;Cantor: This group of teachers
having the name of every child

00:01:11.836 --> 00:01:17.396
on an index card are saying every
child in this school is important.

00:01:17.956 --> 00:01:22.206
&gt;&gt;Cantor: These teachers having
such a deep knowledge of who is

00:01:22.356 --> 00:01:26.976
in the classroom means that they
will really produce learning

00:01:26.976 --> 00:01:28.750
and growth for more kids.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.316
&gt;&gt;Teacher: His scores were phenomenal.

00:01:32.396 --> 00:01:33.226
The impression I have from that--

00:01:33.636 --> 00:01:37.646
&gt;&gt;Shaddox: Our team does have
norms. Some of our norms are

00:01:37.646 --> 00:01:42.776
to use pro-child language, to not
make assumptions, to be specific.

00:01:42.776 --> 00:01:45.976
&gt;&gt;Teacher: His ability to
communicate in that kind

00:01:45.976 --> 00:01:49.896
of basic interpersonal
style is getting to be fine.

00:01:50.226 --> 00:01:52.456
It's the academic language.

00:01:52.456 --> 00:01:56.536
&gt;&gt;Teacher: He does struggle
a lot in my math class.

00:01:56.536 --> 00:01:57.196
I think his--

00:01:57.346 --> 00:01:59.666
&gt;&gt;Shaddox: It's great when you
can figure out that there's a link

00:01:59.666 --> 00:02:02.426
between their academics
and maybe a behavior.

00:02:02.636 --> 00:02:04.936
&gt;&gt;Teacher: I'm thinking it's time
to make a parent communication.

00:02:05.096 --> 00:02:06.536
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Okay.

00:02:06.946 --> 00:02:09.406
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Quickly, I've had a
really successful time with him.

00:02:09.536 --> 00:02:11.376
&gt;&gt;Shaddox: It also allows us
to check in with each other,

00:02:11.686 --> 00:02:12.926
so that we're really cohesive

00:02:12.926 --> 00:02:15.726
about supporting our students
emotionally and academically.

00:02:22.756 --> 00:02:24.016
&gt;&gt;Darling-Hammond: Students
may be showing us something

00:02:24.016 --> 00:02:28.256
about what is hurting and what is
troubling them inside that needs

00:02:28.356 --> 00:02:32.286
to be unearthed so that we
can help them deal with it.

00:02:32.826 --> 00:02:38.316
So, it's an opportunity to engage
with the child's development

00:02:38.606 --> 00:02:41.116
and to help them begin
to develop the skills

00:02:41.816 --> 00:02:44.496
that that behavior suggests
that they really need.

00:02:45.616 --> 00:02:49.456
&gt;&gt;Cantor: This simple technique
enables us not to lose a child,

00:02:50.126 --> 00:02:54.596
enables us to talk about quiet
children, and of course focus

00:02:54.756 --> 00:02:56.356
on children who may need more help.
