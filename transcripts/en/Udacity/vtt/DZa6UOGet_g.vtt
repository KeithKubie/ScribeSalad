00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.569
The last step of course would be to put all the

00:00:01.569 --> 00:00:06.110
pieces together. So, we would take our carrier and airport lists

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:08.790
and run a number of queries to download all of the

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.770
data. We then want to write a parser that will allow us

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:14.910
to extract this data, and put it into the tables we

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.840
would like to build for flight information, for all airline and

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.330
airport combinations. This is a somewhat larger process than it makes

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.420
sense to go through in this lesson, but you'll find some fun

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.180
work to do built around this example in the problem set.
