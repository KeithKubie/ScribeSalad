00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:08.380
TIM DESMOND: Welcome, everyone.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:09.290
I'm Van Riper.

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.860
I run the gPause, our
mindfulness programs,

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.450
community programs for
employees here at Google.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.030
And I'm really proud and
happy to have Tim Desmond here

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:21.890
with us today.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.230
I actually don't know
Tim all that well myself,

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.590
but it's one of the great things
about our community programs

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:28.880
is it's not just me.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.509
There's a group of like
200 or more Googlers

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.600
that are very passionate
about mindfulness, well-being,

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.130
self-compassion.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.290
And one of those Google
are is actually reached out

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.290
to me saying they really would
recommend that we bring Tim in,

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.800
and then I got to check out
his stuff, and it was awesome.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.220
And I really liked that his
work is around developing

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.820
your skills, because just like
in the work of people like

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.760
Richie Davidson, they're
learning that well-being--

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.720
they are skills
that we can develop.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.970
And I'm looking
forward to hearing

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:03.470
from Tim about
how we can develop

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:04.620
our self-compassion skills.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:09.020
So with that, I'm going to turn
over the-- oh, one last thing,

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.450
just for those people
on the live stream.

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.520
Thank you, Brandy.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.530
Thank you, Brandy.

[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.560
MICHAEL VAN RIPER: So
we have a Dory link,

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.120
which I didn't give
Tim in advance,

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:25.677
but it's go slash, Tim's
name, Tim Desmond, dash dory.

00:01:25.677 --> 00:01:27.260
So for those you're
on the live stream

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.970
and you want to have us
answer a question at the end,

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.120
please take advantage of
that go link and do that.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.080
Thank you, Brandy.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.358
So with that, no further ado,
I will turn it over to Tim.

00:01:40.358 --> 00:01:41.354
Welcome, Tim.

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:47.090
TIM DESMOND: Good
morning, everybody.

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:58.870
So on November 14,
2016, just a couple

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:04.210
of days after Donald
Trump won the election,

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:10.830
my wife woke up in the middle of
the night in excruciating pain.

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.390
A trip to the ER revealed
that the cancer that she she'd

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.420
been fighting for
more than a year

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.952
had spread into her abdomen,
and there was a tumor

00:02:21.952 --> 00:02:23.160
that was blocking her kidney.

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.370
A few hours later, she
came out of surgery,

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:34.490
and she had a plastic tube
implanted into her side that

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.994
drained urine into a bag.

00:02:37.994 --> 00:02:40.160
And we were told that she
was going to probably have

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.409
that for the rest of her life.

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:42.448
She still has it.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:51.200
And when our 3-year-old son
came into the hospital room,

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.690
I had to teach him
not to touch her tube.

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.570
So that was a moment that I
could just kind of hear despair

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:08.020
calling me, almost audibly.

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.990
Like it was basically just
saying your life is shit.

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:18.370
Everything is fucked
up, and your best option

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.550
is just to go cower
in the corner or run.

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.050
But looking at my wife and
son, it was just so clear

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.880
that they needed me.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.440
And they didn't need me to
do anything in particular,

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.880
they needed me to be able
to be there for them.

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:46.350
To be present, to help them
feel that they're not alone

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.810
and that life is still worth
living, that that beauty

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.070
and joy are still possible.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.680
But how is that?

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.934
How can that happen in a
moment in which everything

00:03:58.934 --> 00:04:00.100
seems like it's going wrong?

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.040
That's what I want
to talk about today.

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:12.820
There is a capacity
that we can develop

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:20.140
that allows us to stay human,
to be able to stay present,

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:27.190
to be able to care and stay
connected in whatever situation

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:28.180
we find ourselves in.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:39.910
My teacher-- I've been a student
of a Buddhist monk and peace

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:45.370
activist, Thich Nhat Hanh, for
about 20 years, and my teacher,

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:50.170
Thich Nhat Hanh, the word
that he uses for this capacity

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:53.452
is mindfulness.

00:04:53.452 --> 00:04:55.910
But at this point, I'm not sure
how I feel about that word,

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:01.970
because it's a word
that's used so often,

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.730
and used to mean a lot
of different things

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:07.690
to a lot of different people.

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:12.780
For some people, mindfulness
just means taking a deep breath

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.730
or sitting on a
cushion on the floor,

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:19.870
or just sort of paying attention
to your thoughts and feelings

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:25.040
with disinterest, like you're
watching a boring TV show.

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.950
But for my teacher,
for Thich Nhat Hanh,

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:32.220
mindfulness is talking
about this exact capacity.

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:37.040
It's talking about a
way of relating to life,

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:44.510
a way of relating especially
to suffering with compassion

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:48.550
and joy and
equanimity and wisdom,

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:50.750
a way of relating
to life that allows

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:52.040
us to be more fully alive.

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.970
In the book that I'm
talking about here,

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:00.130
I call that capacity
self-compassion,

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:03.162
to kind of highlight
the element of caring,

00:06:03.162 --> 00:06:05.120
the element of compassion
in it, but it doesn't

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:08.170
matter what you call it.

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:11.560
What matters is
that we recognize

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:16.340
how incredibly precious it
is, that we really understand

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:20.070
why we're here, that
we really understand

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:22.080
what feels important to you.

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:32.540
And for me, it's this capacity
to stay human, this capacity

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:36.210
to stay connected.

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:41.180
Whether it's experiencing
tragedy in your own life,

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:44.910
whether it's experiencing
challenges at work,

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:50.930
whether it's successes
or failures or just

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:53.000
kind of the monotony
of day-to-day life.

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.720
That we can develop
this capacity

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:03.670
to be more fully alive, and
to be more fully connected.

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:05.350
And this is a
capacity that we can

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:14.580
develop that I think of as sort
of made out of some component

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:17.390
skills.

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:20.540
We're going to talk about
just a handful of them here,

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:25.500
and in my workbook, we
go through a lot more.

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:28.790
And the first skill that
I want to talk about,

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:30.710
that helps us to
develop this capacity,

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:36.680
is the skill of recognizing
what's beautiful in life.

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:41.240
A lot of us spend
a lot of our time

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:45.860
just paying attention to what
isn't OK in life, everything

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:48.570
that we want to change, all the
problems we're trying to solve.

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:56.020
So I want to talk about
this skill of being

00:07:56.020 --> 00:08:02.389
able to remember, to not
forget, to not ignore everything

00:08:02.389 --> 00:08:03.430
that's beautiful in life.

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:14.160
In every moment of life, there
are infinite reasons to suffer,

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:17.460
and in every moment of life
there are infinite reasons

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:20.320
to be happy.

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:22.750
And what matters is where
we're bringing our attention,

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:25.950
what we're paying attention to.

00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:28.140
If we were just to take
a few minutes right now,

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:32.780
make a list of everything
that you could be upset about,

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:34.669
I don't think
anybody would run out

00:08:34.669 --> 00:08:38.030
of things to put on that list.

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:41.360
But if we were to take
the same amount of time

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.760
and make a list of
everything that you could

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:52.070
be happy about, whether it's
like the colors of a sunset

00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:55.025
or the experience of
health in your body.

00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:02.760
We'd never run out of
those items either.

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:10.340
So there is a skill that
is about training ourselves

00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:13.460
to notice, to be
able to pay attention

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:15.510
to what's beautiful in life.

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:22.960
Now, if we focus
all of our attention

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:29.350
on everything-- so most
of us go through life

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:33.820
believing that the only way
it's possible to be happy

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:38.080
is when all of our conditions
for suffering are gone.

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.340
Right?

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:43.940
I can be happy when
I fix this problem

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:46.660
and when I've
achieved that goal.

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:48.250
And then at that
point, once there's

00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:51.550
no more reasons
for me to suffer,

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:55.000
then that's when
happiness is possible.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.580
But we also know that that's
never going to happen.

00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:00.970
There will never
be a moment in life

00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:03.730
that you won't be able to
find a reason to suffer,

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:04.902
if you're looking for it.

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:10.610
And that's why it's
so important for us

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:15.850
to develop the skill to
learn how to notice what's

00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:20.190
already good, notice
what's already

00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:24.300
beautiful in our lives that's
available right in this moment.

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:31.860
And as we begin to
do that, we also

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:36.900
begin to recognize
everything that isn't wrong.

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:46.690
Like, right now, if you had a
tooth ache, if you had pain,

00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:51.780
like a dental pain,
you'd be thinking,

00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:54.980
if only I didn't have a
tooth ache, I'd be so happy.

00:10:57.650 --> 00:11:02.530
And you don't have a
tooth ache right now,

00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:05.290
and so then the question
is, is it possible

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:10.750
for you to enjoy your
non-toothache right

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:13.330
in this moment?

00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:16.540
Is it possible to
train myself to be

00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:20.420
able to notice those things?

00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:28.320
And it's not naive to
look at life this way.

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:31.560
I mean, if anything,
it's pretty irrational

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:37.770
to be so focused on the
never-ending stream of problems

00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:43.080
in life to the point that
we become debilitated by it.

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:46.170
We can think of experiences
of beauty and joy

00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:50.380
as kind of like the fuel
that we need in order

00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:55.800
to be able to be present when
something doesn't go well.

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:59.730
And if we don't fill up
that reservoir in ourselves,

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:04.030
we won't have the energy to
be able to deal with life

00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:07.971
when we're exposed to
some real difficulty.

00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:21.300
So coming back to my
story, coming back

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:22.370
to that hospital room.

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:33.070
So there I am, with
my wife and son,

00:12:33.070 --> 00:12:37.820
in a moment when it feels like
everything is going wrong.

00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:45.090
And more than anything,
what I want in that moment

00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:47.782
is to be able to be
a resource for them,

00:12:47.782 --> 00:12:49.740
to be able to be there
for them in a way that's

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:52.990
going to be helpful.

00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:53.710
How can I do it?

00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:59.631
So in that moment, I stop.

00:12:59.631 --> 00:13:00.130
I pause.

00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:06.790
I let go of whatever I'm
trying to do in that moment.

00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:11.270
I let go of any desires,
including the desire

00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:14.060
to feel any different or
be any different than I am.

00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:20.450
And I come back just
to the sensations

00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:25.270
in my body in that moment.

00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:29.570
And when I do, it
is not pleasant.

00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:36.630
What I find is an intense
amount of tension,

00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:43.970
agitation, an intense amount
of just kind of heaviness.

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:48.640
And I give myself
permission just

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:55.470
to feel it, just to allow it
to be there, just bringing kind

00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:59.702
of an open acceptance
to exactly what I'm

00:13:59.702 --> 00:14:00.660
feeling in this moment.

00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:08.300
And as I let go of
struggling against what's

00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:12.660
real for me, what
I'm actually feeling,

00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:16.140
as I bring sort of
acceptance and compassion

00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:20.460
to myself in that
moment, it's like I

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:23.610
come into the present in
a really different way.

00:14:26.230 --> 00:14:30.240
And I recognize
this voice in me,

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:34.970
this voice that's
just saying, no.

00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:37.280
This is not OK.

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:38.450
I don't accept this.

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:48.310
I don't accept that
this is happening,

00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:52.292
and I pause, and I listen
to myself with compassion.

00:14:52.292 --> 00:14:53.500
I don't fight against myself.

00:14:53.500 --> 00:15:00.700
I don't start arguing against
myself, but I just listen.

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:06.320
And I recognize that
that voice is suffering

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:14.080
so much is that what is so
difficult in that moment what

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:20.080
that voice is saying is I
don't want to lose my wife,

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:22.410
that I'm really
scared of losing her.

00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:29.700
But as I come into the
present a little more,

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:33.860
I recognize that
she's here with me.

00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:35.375
She's alive in this moment.

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:39.610
That all of this
suffering that's

00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:42.190
coming up for me, all in this
distress that's coming up

00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:45.560
for me, is about the
fear of losing something

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:46.900
that I haven't lost yet.

00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:55.060
And I recognize, and I see this
is a moment that she's alive.

00:15:55.060 --> 00:16:02.670
This is a moment in which I'm
here, with my wife and my son,

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:04.070
and it's not a moment to grieve.

00:16:04.070 --> 00:16:05.701
It's a moment to celebrate.

00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:11.360
When I give talks
about mindfulness,

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:13.570
there's a story that
I'll sometimes tell.

00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:16.322
It's about sort of
listening to ourselves,

00:16:16.322 --> 00:16:18.280
listening to sort of
what's underneath whatever

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:22.220
our behaviors are, and
the story goes like this.

00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:29.080
Imagine somebody is driving on
a highway, and they get cut off,

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:33.970
and they just go into a rage.

00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:35.890
And they roll down the
window, and they're

00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:39.190
screaming obscenities, and maybe
like they throw a plastic water

00:16:39.190 --> 00:16:41.230
bottle at the other car.

00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:44.680
If you could pause in that
moment and ask that person,

00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:46.726
why are you doing that?

00:16:46.726 --> 00:16:48.600
They might say, because
this jerk cut me off.

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:53.280
But if we look a
little deeper, we

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:57.770
might ask, OK, so why is
that so upsetting to you?

00:16:57.770 --> 00:17:02.200
Well, because it was really
unsafe and disrespectful.

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:07.490
OK, so the need that's up
for you right in this moment

00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:09.020
is safety and respect.

00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:11.640
You'd like to feel more
safety and more respect.

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:12.560
Right?

00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:16.770
Yeah, obviously, and
so what you're doing,

00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:19.980
to seek greater
safety and respect,

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:22.537
is chasing somebody
down the highway,

00:17:22.537 --> 00:17:24.870
sticking your head out the
window and screaming at them.

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:31.760
In that moment, I
felt as misguided

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:35.690
as the person in
my story, just sort

00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:39.290
of lost in grief about
something that hadn't happened.

00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:49.190
And actually, in a moment
that I can celebrate.

00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:52.220
That's what I mean
by the practice

00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:57.466
of recognizing what's already
beautiful and being fed by it.

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:04.240
The second skill that I
want to talk about today--

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:07.360
I sort of alluded
to in that story--

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:08.650
is the skill of--

00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:16.910
the skill of being
able to come home

00:18:16.910 --> 00:18:22.195
to your body with
acceptance and compassion.

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:31.620
Whatever is taking
us away, whatever

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:38.450
is getting in the way of our
ability to be fully present,

00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:43.520
our ability to be fully human
in any situation, at least

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:49.634
the most basic level, we
can think of as distress.

00:18:49.634 --> 00:18:51.830
Right?

00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:54.110
And that on one of
the most basic levels,

00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:57.847
we can think of distress as
a physiological response that

00:18:57.847 --> 00:18:58.680
happens in the body.

00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:04.570
In fact, from the perspective
of Buddhist psychology,

00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:11.990
any emotion is made out of
this physiological component

00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:15.530
and a tendency to
think in a certain way.

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:18.740
So for example,
anger is considered

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:23.780
to be made up of a
physiological reaction

00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:26.780
combined with a tendency
to think angry thoughts.

00:19:29.830 --> 00:19:33.610
So this is a practice
of coming home

00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:38.400
to that physiological
response in the body

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:42.047
and bringing acceptance
and compassion.

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:48.050
So at probably the
most basic level,

00:19:48.050 --> 00:19:52.880
just being able to accept my
own physiological response

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:56.210
to a situation,
we might consider

00:19:56.210 --> 00:19:59.780
the absolute floor
of self-compassion

00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:01.730
of self-acceptance.

00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:07.370
It is OK for my body to be
doing what it's doing right now,

00:20:07.370 --> 00:20:14.420
as opposed to it's not OK
for whatever my body is--

00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:17.210
whatever's happening
in my body right now.

00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:18.900
So we can consider
that in some ways

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:22.140
just the most basic
level of self-acceptance

00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:25.050
or self-compassion.

00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:30.200
But bringing compassion to
the sensations in our body

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:31.380
has another element.

00:20:33.984 --> 00:20:37.330
I'm going to flip through
a couple of slides here.

00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:45.840
So first, this is Annie.

00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:52.220
This is my wife after one
of our many hospital visits.

00:20:54.674 --> 00:20:56.090
And then this is
the person that I

00:20:56.090 --> 00:20:58.406
want to talk about
now, Jaak Panksepp.

00:21:02.266 --> 00:21:05.300
Panksepp is probably
one of-- or was--

00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:09.500
one of the most
well-known affective

00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:12.260
neuroscientists in the world,
actually coined the term

00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:13.280
affective neuroscience.

00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:19.010
He's a neuroscientist who
focuses on the study of emotion

00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:20.186
in the brain.

00:21:20.186 --> 00:21:23.270
This is a photo of him with
some of his best friends,

00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:24.200
his lab rats.

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:33.320
So Panksepp, in the
course of his research,

00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:39.830
he discovered what he calls
basic emotional circuits

00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:41.020
in the brain.

00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:42.950
He was really
particularly interested

00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:48.260
in coming to understand
well-defined anatomical

00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:54.360
structures in the brain that
all mammals share, that give

00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:58.170
rise to what he would
call basic emotions.

00:21:58.170 --> 00:22:02.160
And one of the seven
basic emotional circuits

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:07.050
that Panksepp discovered
he calls the care circuit.

00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:11.010
It's basically the brain
circuit that all mammals

00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:17.830
share that regulates
caretaking behaviors.

00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:22.170
If you're feeling
warmth and love,

00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:25.120
if it were possible to image
your brain with enough detail,

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:27.120
we would see that the
care circuit in your brain

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:29.340
is active.

00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:34.100
That it's releasing
oxytocin and natural opiates

00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:35.600
to give you that
warm fuzzy feeling.

00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:43.820
Panksepp discovered that the
care circuit in your brain

00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:48.050
is one of the
primary tools that we

00:22:48.050 --> 00:22:51.860
have for emotional regulation.

00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:55.460
That for any man
experiencing distress,

00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:59.090
if you can activate the
care circuit in your brain,

00:22:59.090 --> 00:23:02.510
he'll say you can do
so either naturally

00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:06.320
or using micro electrodes
in animal studies.

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:09.800
Just turning on the care
circuit in your brain,

00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:16.060
that your experience of
distress drops dramatically.

00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:18.130
And so one thing
that we're learning

00:23:18.130 --> 00:23:24.820
how to do in this practice
is we can consider compassion

00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:31.490
training at some level utilizing
the care circuit in your brain

00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:34.670
to regulate distress.

00:23:34.670 --> 00:23:39.110
Getting in touch with a
feeling of warmth and love,

00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:43.085
and allowing that to regulate
distressing emotions.

00:23:45.730 --> 00:23:47.500
And I'm going to
tell a little story

00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:53.650
about utilizing this
practice or process in kind

00:23:53.650 --> 00:23:58.110
of a high pressure environment.

00:23:58.110 --> 00:24:05.650
I think it was October
13th or so, 2011.

00:24:05.650 --> 00:24:12.880
Mayor Bloomberg in New York
City gave an eviction notice

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:18.480
for all of the protesters at
Occupy Wall in Zuccotti Park.

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:21.900
What he said was
that the protesters

00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:27.760
needed to evacuate the park, so
the park can be power washed.

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:29.820
Most of the
demonstrators assumed

00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:35.730
that this was just kind
of a way of clearing out

00:24:35.730 --> 00:24:36.880
the demonstrations.

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:40.110
And in fact, Saturday Night
Live made a joke about anyone

00:24:40.110 --> 00:24:42.000
who spent much time
in New York City

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.890
doesn't see a lot of
evidence of public parks

00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:44.910
being power washed.

00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:53.360
So that night
Hundreds of protesters

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:57.150
rented industrial cleaning
equipment and cleaned the park,

00:24:57.150 --> 00:25:04.390
and a call went out to
resist the eviction.

00:25:04.390 --> 00:25:09.830
And so the next morning, before
dawn, more people than ever

00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:13.580
were crowded into
Zuccotti Park, shoulder

00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:17.360
to shoulder for the
entire public park.

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:21.320
And I was asked with
another organizer,

00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:25.790
Nicole [? Cardy, ?] to
facilitate the General

00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:30.500
Assembly the next morning.

00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:36.710
So I remember standing
up on a low stone wall

00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:40.930
and looking out into
this sea of humanity.

00:25:40.930 --> 00:25:46.120
We were entirely penned
in by police in riot gear.

00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:50.800
There were helicopters
overhead, and

00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:56.540
this enormous military-level
police presence,

00:25:56.540 --> 00:25:58.670
and Nicole and I were
tasked with doing

00:25:58.670 --> 00:26:01.050
something impossible.

00:26:01.050 --> 00:26:06.220
We're supposed to facilitate
a consensus meeting

00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:10.550
with tens of thousands of people
in imminent physical danger.

00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:17.310
And I remember looking out
into this group of people

00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:25.010
and seeing the terror that
was in so many of their faces,

00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:30.800
that threatened to
overcome our hope

00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:32.600
and turn this
gathering into chaos.

00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:41.840
And in that moment,
all that I wanted to do

00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:47.860
was to be a resource
to ground the energy.

00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:49.000
I wanted to be--

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:57.320
I wanted to project calm
and serenity and connection,

00:26:57.320 --> 00:27:00.290
but I was just as freaked
out as anybody else.

00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:09.010
Possibly more so, because I'm
supposed to be facilitating

00:27:09.010 --> 00:27:12.190
this, co-facilitating it.

00:27:12.190 --> 00:27:14.830
So in that moment, I
remember looking out

00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:23.900
into this crowd of people,
and again, just stopping

00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:25.190
and coming back to my body.

00:27:28.450 --> 00:27:30.880
And again becoming
aware of just the

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:36.610
shakiness the
agitation the pressure,

00:27:36.610 --> 00:27:40.760
just as physical
sensation in my body.

00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:43.070
And in that moment,
what I said to

00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:49.582
myself was, whatever you
feel right now is OK.

00:27:49.582 --> 00:27:51.670
It can be as strong
as it wants to be.

00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:56.650
I sort of spoke to the fear in
me, and said, it's OK for you

00:27:56.650 --> 00:27:58.460
to be here.

00:27:58.460 --> 00:28:03.310
You can be as strong as you
want to be, and as I did,

00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:04.635
the sensation got a lot worse.

00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:11.160
But I didn't worry, because
I've had enough experience

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:16.200
with this practice that I
know that happens sometimes.

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:18.770
So I told myself--

00:28:18.770 --> 00:28:22.140
so I kind of spoke to
the fear in me saying,

00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:24.780
you can be as strong as
you want to be, and it did,

00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:28.030
got really intense.

00:28:28.030 --> 00:28:31.990
And I basically just
said, you can be as afraid

00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:32.830
as you want to be.

00:28:32.830 --> 00:28:37.010
This fear can be as
strong as you want to be,

00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:38.550
and you're still loved.

00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:41.420
You're still OK.

00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:42.540
I can be here for you.

00:28:45.510 --> 00:28:52.050
That moment is what we
might call equanimity

00:28:52.050 --> 00:28:55.300
with compassion.

00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:58.870
For a lot of us, when
we think of compassion,

00:28:58.870 --> 00:29:01.532
we think of compassion
without equanimity.

00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:10.410
The idea that I care so much
about your well-being that

00:29:10.410 --> 00:29:12.420
to see you suffering kills me.

00:29:15.370 --> 00:29:17.860
And that it's hard for me to
be around, or it's hard for me

00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:18.380
to help.

00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:23.350
It sort of burns me out
to care of this much.

00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:26.170
You can consider that
compassion without equanimity.

00:29:26.170 --> 00:29:30.180
And then on the other
hand, sometimes we

00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:33.600
can have equanimity
without compassion.

00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:36.450
What that might consider
equanimity without compassion

00:29:36.450 --> 00:29:40.470
is kind of like, oh yeah, things
like this happen every day.

00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:42.330
You read the news,
and you're like,

00:29:42.330 --> 00:29:48.520
yeah, things like that happen
every day, not surprised,

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:51.660
and you're not move at
all to want to help.

00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:54.040
It doesn't really stir you.

00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:58.560
We consider that sort of
equanimity without compassion.

00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:02.020
But the image for what I
want to talk about here,

00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:05.950
that I feel like is maybe
the most important component

00:30:05.950 --> 00:30:09.610
of developing our
capacity to stay human,

00:30:09.610 --> 00:30:12.940
is equanimity with compassion.

00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:18.120
And the archetype of
equanimity with compassion

00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:20.760
is the way that we
hold a crying baby.

00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:24.850
My teacher Thich
Nhat Hanh, when he

00:30:24.850 --> 00:30:27.760
talks about mindfulness
practice, he says,

00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:32.620
what you're learning how to do
is to be present with yourself

00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:36.170
and especially present
with your suffering.

00:30:36.170 --> 00:30:40.280
In the way that you would hold
a crying baby, with that kind

00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:46.100
of openness and warmth and care.

00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:48.044
And he's not talking
about the way

00:30:48.044 --> 00:30:50.210
that we might actually hold
a crying baby, when it's

00:30:50.210 --> 00:30:53.570
3:00 O'clock in the morning, and
you're just totally burned out.

00:30:53.570 --> 00:30:57.140
What he means is
that there is a way

00:30:57.140 --> 00:31:00.740
to hold a crying baby that
that baby experiences as deeply

00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:03.780
comforting.

00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:06.240
And it's not you're
holding the baby,

00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:09.550
and you're just like,
God, will you shut up.

00:31:09.550 --> 00:31:12.850
OK, I'm holding you, see,
holding you, now stop.

00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:21.040
It's a way that I think
that we can all relate to,

00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:26.140
that you're holding this
baby with the attitude of,

00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:31.720
it's OK if you cry, and
it's OK if you stop.

00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:36.510
Whatever you're feeling
is fine with me,

00:31:36.510 --> 00:31:39.500
and I'm here for you,
whatever you need.

00:31:42.150 --> 00:31:44.720
It's not the kind
of equanimity--

00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:46.560
so sometimes we
get confused when

00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:48.630
we think about our
adult relationships,

00:31:48.630 --> 00:31:52.770
because we feel like to
have compassion for somebody

00:31:52.770 --> 00:31:57.420
means that we don't really
accept their suffering.

00:31:57.420 --> 00:32:00.040
We have to fix them.

00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:03.280
Or we might feel like
having equanimity

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:07.700
is like, well, you're going
through something hard,

00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:08.842
so I'm just going to--

00:32:08.842 --> 00:32:10.300
so that's fine with
me, that you're

00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:11.508
going through something hard.

00:32:14.270 --> 00:32:20.800
But there is a compassion with
equanimity in which I can be--

00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:24.400
whatever you're going
through doesn't bother me,

00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:27.750
like I recognize
that's part of life.

00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:32.266
And yet, I'm here for you, if
there's anything that I can do,

00:32:32.266 --> 00:32:33.218
I will.

00:32:36.550 --> 00:32:41.110
And so in this
meeting, I'm trying

00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:45.470
to relate to my own
suffering in this way.

00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:52.300
I'm feeling this fear as
borderline terror in me,

00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:57.200
and saying, you can be as
afraid as you want to be.

00:32:57.200 --> 00:33:00.485
I'm here for you,
whatever you need.

00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:10.000
And as I do, it gets
worse for a few minutes.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:16.360
Maybe not even a minute,
and then it starts to relax,

00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:19.870
and I start to get this sense
of whatever feeling comes up

00:33:19.870 --> 00:33:21.700
is OK.

00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:26.910
It doesn't threaten
my value as a person,

00:33:26.910 --> 00:33:32.910
that love and compassion are
available whatever is coming up

00:33:32.910 --> 00:33:35.906
with me, regardless.

00:33:35.906 --> 00:33:37.280
And there's
something that's just

00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:39.890
profoundly comforting
for a human being

00:33:39.890 --> 00:33:41.990
to have that experience,
and that's really

00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:44.480
what we're training
ourselves to be

00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:50.590
able to do in the practice
of self-compassion.

00:33:50.590 --> 00:33:55.280
And as I started to settle,
I looked out in this crowd,

00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:59.420
and it was just so obvious to me
that there is nowhere on earth

00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:02.080
that I'd rather be.

00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:04.510
I'm surrounded with
tens of thousands

00:34:04.510 --> 00:34:09.460
of people who are
risking their comfort

00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:12.850
and their safety to try to
make the world a little better,

00:34:12.850 --> 00:34:16.638
in whatever way that they think
might make the world better.

00:34:16.638 --> 00:34:18.179
But that they're
putting their bodies

00:34:18.179 --> 00:34:22.230
on the line for something
that they believe in,

00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:26.639
and seeing that insight,
I just fell in love

00:34:26.639 --> 00:34:30.960
with everybody, every
single person in that crowd.

00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:35.895
And I think that they could
feel it, and the energy relaxed.

00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:43.330
And about 20 minutes into
that general assembly,

00:34:43.330 --> 00:34:47.800
we got word that Bloomberg
and Brookfield Properties,

00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:52.330
that manages the park, had
rescinded their evacuation

00:34:52.330 --> 00:34:53.590
notice.

00:34:53.590 --> 00:34:55.840
And so there's a
huge celebration,

00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:58.570
and marching and dancing
and everything like that.

00:35:01.350 --> 00:35:04.130
It ended up being this
really wonderful day.

00:35:07.980 --> 00:35:11.450
So that's the second skill
that I want to talk about,

00:35:11.450 --> 00:35:16.150
that ability to relate to
ourselves, to our suffering,

00:35:16.150 --> 00:35:18.670
with openness, with compassion.

00:35:18.670 --> 00:35:22.500
To relate to those
experiences primarily

00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:25.290
as sensations in
the body that we can

00:35:25.290 --> 00:35:28.990
bring openness and compassion.

00:35:28.990 --> 00:35:32.200
And then the third skill
that I want to talk about--

00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:35.460
I'm going to turn
these slides back on.

00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:40.340
There's the one of
the General Assembly

00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:43.280
meetings at Occupy Wall Street.

00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:49.740
OK, so sometimes holding our
suffering feels like this.

00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:54.780
Sometimes, our fear, our grief,
our anger, we can recognize it

00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:59.400
and we can kind of hold it,
and that's kind of the image.

00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:01.360
It when you're thinking
about mindfulness,

00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:05.160
this is the image that I'd like
for you to have in your mind.

00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:08.449
However, sometimes we try to
come home to our suffering,

00:36:08.449 --> 00:36:09.990
and it looks a little
more like this.

00:36:12.650 --> 00:36:15.140
And so there's this
question of how

00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:19.820
do I find compassion for that?

00:36:19.820 --> 00:36:27.610
How can I find it in myself
to have love and compassion

00:36:27.610 --> 00:36:28.530
for this part of me?

00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:36.120
And it's particularly
problematic

00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:37.590
when we're being
self-destructive,

00:36:37.590 --> 00:36:40.260
when we experience ourselves
as being self-destructive.

00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:43.500
Those are the parts of us
that are often the hardest

00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:45.376
to relate to with compassion.

00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:57.900
So in my first book,
in "Self-Compassion

00:36:57.900 --> 00:37:03.450
in Psychotherapy,"
there's a client that I--

00:37:03.450 --> 00:37:05.020
sort of a case study
that I write up,

00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:06.811
that I'm going to share
a little bit about,

00:37:06.811 --> 00:37:10.460
to talk about this problem.

00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:14.540
His name, as the case
study, his name was Chris,

00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:16.760
and he came to therapy.

00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:23.550
He said that he
had been depressed

00:37:23.550 --> 00:37:28.300
with intense self-criticism
for a long time,

00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:31.450
and that I was the I think
the fifth therapist that he

00:37:31.450 --> 00:37:33.760
had seen in two years.

00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:35.047
No one had helped.

00:37:35.047 --> 00:37:36.380
So I was already really excited.

00:37:39.970 --> 00:37:45.010
And so I said, OK well, tell me
about what you want to work on.

00:37:45.010 --> 00:37:49.730
And he said, so I've
got this intense amount

00:37:49.730 --> 00:37:55.000
of self-criticism, and whatever
I do doesn't seem to help

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:58.660
and he talks about
whenever he had a success.

00:37:58.660 --> 00:38:03.160
He felt like an imposter,
like he was just moments

00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:07.110
away from being
kind of found out

00:38:07.110 --> 00:38:11.510
and that just going through
life, whenever made a mistake,

00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:16.250
he was incredibly
critical of himself.

00:38:16.250 --> 00:38:21.150
And so we started
off, and I said,

00:38:21.150 --> 00:38:24.800
well, maybe we can try
a couple of practices

00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:28.030
and see if we can find
something that might help you.

00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:30.570
Would you be willing
to try a practice?

00:38:30.570 --> 00:38:33.510
We can try a few things
and see what might help,

00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:35.990
and he said, well,
what do you want to do?

00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:39.170
So I described him a mindfulness
of the body practice,

00:38:39.170 --> 00:38:41.840
and he's like, nah, I've
read all about mindfulness.

00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:44.450
It doesn't help me.

00:38:44.450 --> 00:38:45.250
I said, OK.

00:38:48.430 --> 00:38:52.600
So then I described a another
self-compassion practice

00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:55.164
about like the voices
or thoughts in his head.

00:38:55.164 --> 00:38:57.580
And he's like, no, that sounds
really similar to something

00:38:57.580 --> 00:38:58.610
another therapist did.

00:38:58.610 --> 00:39:01.650
I don't want to do that either.

00:39:01.650 --> 00:39:07.500
We spent pretty much a full
hour-long session going through

00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:09.690
just about any
orientation that I

00:39:09.690 --> 00:39:15.420
could think of for working on
depression and self-criticism.

00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:18.570
And every single one
he had either tried,

00:39:18.570 --> 00:39:25.030
and it didn't work, or it just
couldn't possibly work for him.

00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:32.530
And so the term that kept
popping up in my mind

00:39:32.530 --> 00:39:36.070
was a term by the
Harvard psychologist

00:39:36.070 --> 00:39:40.330
Robert Kegan called
competing commitment.

00:39:40.330 --> 00:39:43.200
And what Kegan means by
a competing commitment

00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:46.980
is that it's
possible for someone

00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:53.330
to genuinely want to
stop being depressed.

00:39:53.330 --> 00:39:57.230
And yet for another
part of them to be

00:39:57.230 --> 00:40:01.150
afraid of letting go
of their depression,

00:40:01.150 --> 00:40:04.525
or whatever that symptom
is, competing commitments.

00:40:08.170 --> 00:40:10.540
And that's kind of what
was coming up in me.

00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:13.650
It seems like
everything I'm doing,

00:40:13.650 --> 00:40:18.416
Chris was finding some way to
kind of not go along with it.

00:40:18.416 --> 00:40:19.790
I was kind of
getting that sense,

00:40:19.790 --> 00:40:23.490
so we end up trying a
practice looking into that.

00:40:23.490 --> 00:40:26.000
But I want to talk a little
bit about competing commitments

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:30.320
first, because it's I feel like
one of the most important areas

00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:34.920
for really understanding
self-compassion.

00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:38.190
Because what it
means ultimately is

00:40:38.190 --> 00:40:41.460
relating to every
part of myself,

00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:45.680
even the self-destructive
ones, with understanding

00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:46.693
and compassion.

00:40:49.870 --> 00:40:55.090
Now usually, when we
think about somebody

00:40:55.090 --> 00:41:03.070
who's like really self-critical
or self-sabotaging or just

00:41:03.070 --> 00:41:06.190
incapable of taking
a complement,

00:41:06.190 --> 00:41:10.060
it seems like they're just
being self-destructive,

00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:12.670
or that there's something
sort of dysfunction

00:41:12.670 --> 00:41:16.750
about their way of relating.

00:41:16.750 --> 00:41:18.760
But I want to talk
about that and question

00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:22.060
that a little bit in
terms of finding a way

00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:25.950
to develop compassion for
those parts of ourselves.

00:41:25.950 --> 00:41:32.030
So to go back to our
slides for a second,

00:41:32.030 --> 00:41:36.474
when you see a moth
fly into a flame--

00:41:36.474 --> 00:41:37.890
that moth's about
to kill himself.

00:41:41.230 --> 00:41:42.130
Why do they do that?

00:41:45.610 --> 00:41:48.970
Well, when we look at
a moth just like a bee

00:41:48.970 --> 00:41:53.390
line for a flame and
die, we generally

00:41:53.390 --> 00:41:56.270
don't assume that moth
just hated himself.

00:41:58.790 --> 00:42:00.200
Right?

00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:08.140
We come up with some other
story for why the moth did that.

00:42:08.140 --> 00:42:13.850
In general, we might
believe that maybe they

00:42:13.850 --> 00:42:18.170
use light to
navigate, and they get

00:42:18.170 --> 00:42:21.020
confused by artificial lights.

00:42:21.020 --> 00:42:22.910
That's a really common
idea that people

00:42:22.910 --> 00:42:25.280
will talk about
why that happens,

00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:29.300
even though it's
factually untrue.

00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:33.650
Entomologists say that moths
don't use light to navigate.

00:42:33.650 --> 00:42:36.540
We don't actually
know why they do this,

00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:44.820
but we tend to come up with
some sort of explanation

00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:48.195
that there is a life-serving
purpose that gets confused.

00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:52.820
Whenever we see an
animal acting in ways

00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:56.780
that might be considered
self-destructive,

00:42:56.780 --> 00:42:59.440
that there must be some
sort of life-serving purpose

00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:01.770
that's just out of
context a little bit.

00:43:01.770 --> 00:43:04.860
And we do that because
evolution doesn't really

00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:13.150
make sense unless you assume
that life is motivated

00:43:13.150 --> 00:43:18.730
by avoiding suffering
and trying to meet needs,

00:43:18.730 --> 00:43:21.760
trying to thrive.

00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:24.300
Otherwise, when you're
talking about evolution,

00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:27.960
it's hard to say
what's driving--

00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:31.140
how to explain any
of these behaviors

00:43:31.140 --> 00:43:35.180
in terms of evolution.

00:43:35.180 --> 00:43:39.632
But we don't necessarily do
that with our own behaviors.

00:43:39.632 --> 00:43:41.090
We don't give
ourselves the benefit

00:43:41.090 --> 00:43:44.510
of the doubt in the same way
that we might with a moth.

00:43:47.190 --> 00:43:50.840
Now, trying to understand
what gets confused--

00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:55.840
if we want to assume that
whatever self-destructive

00:43:55.840 --> 00:43:57.990
behavior--

00:43:57.990 --> 00:44:00.420
we might engage in
self-sabotaging behavior--

00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:09.840
that Chris, his depth
of self-criticism

00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:16.440
and his whatever ways that
he's kind of avoiding therapy.

00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:19.170
If we're trying to assume
that that is motivated

00:44:19.170 --> 00:44:24.144
by some sort of life-serving
purpose that gets confused,

00:44:24.144 --> 00:44:25.560
we need to understand
a little bit

00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:29.770
about why it could be confused.

00:44:29.770 --> 00:44:36.430
And actually,
there is a new kind

00:44:36.430 --> 00:44:38.830
of subfield of
neuroscience that's

00:44:38.830 --> 00:44:41.080
teaching us a lot about this.

00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:43.300
computational neuroscience.

00:44:43.300 --> 00:44:45.500
For a long time,
neuroscientists,

00:44:45.500 --> 00:44:48.670
from the beginning
of neuroscience,

00:44:48.670 --> 00:44:51.040
they were only really able
to learn about the brain

00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:53.620
through injuries.

00:44:53.620 --> 00:44:55.240
Right?

00:44:55.240 --> 00:44:58.230
Somebody gets-- an
animal or a person--

00:44:58.230 --> 00:45:01.180
an animal gets a lesion or a
person gets a brain injury,

00:45:01.180 --> 00:45:02.580
and we see how it affects them.

00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:06.404
And for a long time, up until
more recent brain imaging,

00:45:06.404 --> 00:45:08.320
that's the only way we're
able to really learn

00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:11.610
about how the brain works.

00:45:11.610 --> 00:45:16.630
Starting with when we
invented functional imaging,

00:45:16.630 --> 00:45:19.230
we were then able to learn
a lot more about the brain,

00:45:19.230 --> 00:45:23.190
being able to kind of look
at it in live subjects.

00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:27.120
But still, it's
like if I could just

00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:29.580
take a scan of what
my computer is doing,

00:45:29.580 --> 00:45:32.640
like as the electricity
is moving around,

00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:35.160
you can't really learn
that much about how

00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:38.510
my computer works just by
kind of looking at a scan.

00:45:42.790 --> 00:45:47.536
The fields of artificial
intelligence and machine

00:45:47.536 --> 00:45:48.910
learning have
gotten to the point

00:45:48.910 --> 00:45:54.400
now that they're making
novel contributions

00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:56.110
to the field of neuroscience.

00:45:56.110 --> 00:45:58.570
And one of the main ways
that they're able to do that

00:45:58.570 --> 00:46:05.320
is by taking theories that are
put forward by neuroscientists

00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:08.470
and biologists,
biologically-grounded theories,

00:46:08.470 --> 00:46:11.350
and they're able to
formalize those theories

00:46:11.350 --> 00:46:12.970
and test them computationally.

00:46:12.970 --> 00:46:16.210
Like, does this
actually behave--

00:46:16.210 --> 00:46:18.190
in what ways does
it, and in what ways

00:46:18.190 --> 00:46:22.310
does it not behave
like an actual brain?

00:46:22.310 --> 00:46:25.580
Probably one of the
most dominant ideas

00:46:25.580 --> 00:46:28.400
in computational
neuroscience right now

00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:34.580
is that the brain's core
functioning is to build models,

00:46:34.580 --> 00:46:36.830
to build models of the world.

00:46:36.830 --> 00:46:43.960
To take the chaos of our sensory
data, and to look for patterns,

00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:46.030
and to use those
patterns to construct

00:46:46.030 --> 00:46:50.990
models of how the world works.

00:46:50.990 --> 00:46:56.110
But what that means is
that all of our actions

00:46:56.110 --> 00:46:59.260
are being mediated
through these models

00:46:59.260 --> 00:47:05.140
that we have of how to avoid
suffering and find happiness.

00:47:05.140 --> 00:47:09.520
And all of our models
are constructed out

00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:13.110
of our past experience.

00:47:13.110 --> 00:47:18.690
And so kind of recognizing
that a worldview that

00:47:18.690 --> 00:47:27.170
sees human beings want to avoid
suffering and find happiness,

00:47:27.170 --> 00:47:31.470
but we just generally
don't know how.

00:47:31.470 --> 00:47:36.960
Because we are filtering those
impulses through imperfect

00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:38.010
modeling of the world.

00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:45.510
And that in some ways,
recognizing that a human being

00:47:45.510 --> 00:47:48.720
is someone who--

00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:51.780
it's actually very similar
to the idea in Buddhist

00:47:51.780 --> 00:47:56.160
psychology, that
ultimately what we

00:47:56.160 --> 00:48:00.000
want is to avoid suffering
and find happiness,

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:03.140
but we don't know how.

00:48:03.140 --> 00:48:07.920
Coming back to Chris,
so what we did,

00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:09.270
he came back the next session.

00:48:09.270 --> 00:48:12.210
I said, you know,
I'd like to try to--

00:48:12.210 --> 00:48:15.230
can we go through some
sort of practice today?

00:48:15.230 --> 00:48:18.100
He said, OK, I'll try something.

00:48:18.100 --> 00:48:21.699
And what I did was I asked him
to picture himself in a moment

00:48:21.699 --> 00:48:23.240
that he was feeling
really depressed.

00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:26.830
He talked about
earlier that week he

00:48:26.830 --> 00:48:32.760
had stayed home and overeaten,
played a lot of video games.

00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:35.350
And his girlfriend asked him
to come out to a dinner party,

00:48:35.350 --> 00:48:36.830
and he was isolating.

00:48:36.830 --> 00:48:38.674
He turned her down,
and he was just

00:48:38.674 --> 00:48:40.090
overeating and
playing video games

00:48:40.090 --> 00:48:41.548
and feeling terrible
about himself.

00:48:41.548 --> 00:48:45.130
And I asked him to picture
himself back there,

00:48:45.130 --> 00:48:49.360
and just sit with
that for a moment,

00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:55.730
let himself get in touch
with, bring up those feelings.

00:48:55.730 --> 00:48:57.790
And from the perspective
of recognizing

00:48:57.790 --> 00:49:03.210
that whatever part of him
is active right now is--

00:49:03.210 --> 00:49:08.680
it has a life-serving purpose
that we don't yet understand.

00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:13.528
I asked him to
finish the sentence

00:49:13.528 --> 00:49:20.040
"I refuse to let go of my
depression, because if I did--"

00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:24.230
and he immediately said,
"they get away with it."

00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:26.160
I said, who gets
away with it, and he

00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:27.595
goes, my fucking parents.

00:49:30.810 --> 00:49:32.570
And we talked a little
bit more, and he

00:49:32.570 --> 00:49:41.389
explained that he'd grown
up in a household where

00:49:41.389 --> 00:49:43.680
it was a household where his
parents would be screaming

00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:44.850
at him and demeaning him.

00:49:44.850 --> 00:49:48.259
And then the phone would ring,
and they'd be like, oh hi!

00:49:48.259 --> 00:49:49.800
Oh yeah, everything's
wonderful here.

00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:51.960
How are you?

00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:55.920
And for Chris, that
facade of needing

00:49:55.920 --> 00:49:59.220
to put forth
everything is fine here

00:49:59.220 --> 00:50:04.650
was actually more painful
than the emotional abuse

00:50:04.650 --> 00:50:07.770
that he experienced
from his parents.

00:50:07.770 --> 00:50:09.690
And that there was
a part of him that

00:50:09.690 --> 00:50:19.520
felt like the only
way for me to have

00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:24.410
any hope of my parents
admitting the reality of what

00:50:24.410 --> 00:50:28.040
our relationship has been
is just to stay depressed,

00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:31.160
to keep undermining my life.

00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:33.200
Because as soon
as I start really

00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:36.920
succeeding, as soon as I
really let go of this stuff,

00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:40.320
they're just going to
take credit for all of it,

00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:42.020
and that was intolerable.

00:50:45.170 --> 00:50:49.730
And as soon as I could recognize
how this undermining himself

00:50:49.730 --> 00:50:52.730
was an attempt--

00:50:52.730 --> 00:50:58.170
had a life serving purpose,
then we could integrate it,

00:50:58.170 --> 00:51:01.350
and we could find compassion
for that part of himself

00:51:01.350 --> 00:51:07.830
that just is terrified of
letting his parents win.

00:51:07.830 --> 00:51:14.160
And eventually, he was able to
kind of consciously give up.

00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:18.010
Give up hope on the
possibility that they

00:51:18.010 --> 00:51:23.320
were going to respond to him
the way that he wanted them to,

00:51:23.320 --> 00:51:26.680
and in doing that, he
no longer felt compelled

00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:31.170
to undermine himself anymore.

00:51:31.170 --> 00:51:37.470
Coming back to the workbook--

00:51:37.470 --> 00:51:39.610
let's see.

00:51:39.610 --> 00:51:40.810
There you go, yep.

00:51:40.810 --> 00:51:48.450
Coming back to the workbook, the
Self-Compassion Skills workbook

00:51:48.450 --> 00:51:54.970
is organized as kind of a flow
chart of different practices.

00:51:57.990 --> 00:52:00.170
In my first book,
"Self-Compassion

00:52:00.170 --> 00:52:03.840
in Psychotherapy," Richie
Davidson wrote the foreword,

00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:11.010
and he describes research that
shows about 30 minutes a day,

00:52:11.010 --> 00:52:18.900
for two weeks, of compassion
training is enough to create

00:52:18.900 --> 00:52:24.910
measurable changes in both
brain physiology and behavior.

00:52:24.910 --> 00:52:28.260
And so this workbook is
set up with that assumption

00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:34.160
in mind, that taking 30
minutes a day, for two weeks,

00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:37.160
to train yourself
in the component

00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:38.890
skills of self-compassion.

00:52:41.980 --> 00:52:43.900
But recognizing that
we're different,

00:52:43.900 --> 00:52:45.850
and we have different
strengths, and we

00:52:45.850 --> 00:52:48.560
have different obstacles.

00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:50.380
There's a flow chart
that, depending

00:52:50.380 --> 00:52:53.290
on what's coming up
for you, it points you

00:52:53.290 --> 00:52:56.260
to whatever practice is going
to be most appropriate for you

00:52:56.260 --> 00:52:57.370
in that moment.

00:52:57.370 --> 00:53:01.180
So you start every training
session at the beginning,

00:53:01.180 --> 00:53:03.920
and move from one
practice to the next,

00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:08.170
depending on what
comes up for you.

00:53:08.170 --> 00:53:10.830
So we're at a good
place, I think,

00:53:10.830 --> 00:53:15.490
to open up for questions,
thoughts, and comments.

00:53:15.490 --> 00:53:18.062
So I think Van has a mic there.

00:53:18.062 --> 00:53:20.270
MICHAEL VAN RIPER: Yeah,
I'm going to-- maybe Brandy,

00:53:20.270 --> 00:53:21.310
you'll be my mic runner?

00:53:26.829 --> 00:53:27.370
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:53:27.370 --> 00:53:29.410
My name is [? Sarup. ?]
I'm part of gPause team.

00:53:29.410 --> 00:53:33.680
I teach meditations and yoga.

00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:37.660
I [INAUDIBLE] look like I'm
a taking a personal session

00:53:37.660 --> 00:53:40.000
and asking you a question,
but it's kind of like,

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:41.530
so I teach meditation, right?

00:53:41.530 --> 00:53:42.280
TIM DESMOND: Sure.

00:53:42.280 --> 00:53:44.320
AUDIENCE: I'm learning
mediation from the day.

00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:46.690
I'm going to school,
because my schools are

00:53:46.690 --> 00:53:48.235
teaching meditation.

00:53:48.235 --> 00:53:50.890
But now, still even after
practicing meditation

00:53:50.890 --> 00:53:54.220
from so long, right, still
there is a little anger in me.

00:53:54.220 --> 00:53:54.970
TIM DESMOND: Yeah.

00:53:54.970 --> 00:53:55.636
AUDIENCE: Right?

00:53:55.636 --> 00:53:58.750
There's still little because
people point this out.

00:53:58.750 --> 00:54:00.541
You are practicing this long.

00:54:00.541 --> 00:54:01.540
TIM DESMOND: Sure, sure.

00:54:01.540 --> 00:54:04.030
AUDIENCE: Why the hell
do you have anger?

00:54:04.030 --> 00:54:07.540
But now the problem--
now, you know?

00:54:07.540 --> 00:54:09.810
Even discussion is
coming to me, myself.

00:54:09.810 --> 00:54:10.615
Right?

00:54:10.615 --> 00:54:11.680
The point is right.

00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:14.530
I'm practicing meditation
for so long, why

00:54:14.530 --> 00:54:16.330
there's still this anger.

00:54:16.330 --> 00:54:18.300
Now, I want to share
the situation as well.

00:54:18.300 --> 00:54:19.050
TIM DESMOND: Sure.

00:54:19.050 --> 00:54:21.340
AUDIENCE: That is
causing the anger.

00:54:21.340 --> 00:54:23.560
So I belong to a
very poor family.

00:54:23.560 --> 00:54:26.070
Somehow I managed to
reach Google today,

00:54:26.070 --> 00:54:28.490
and I want to give back
to the society, right?

00:54:28.490 --> 00:54:31.030
So I was helping an
orphanage to fund.

00:54:31.030 --> 00:54:33.820
Not just me, I collected
a bunch of friends

00:54:33.820 --> 00:54:37.570
who were like me, somehow
least successful in their life,

00:54:37.570 --> 00:54:39.130
and we were supporting
an orphanage.

00:54:39.130 --> 00:54:40.630
But since we are
busy with our life,

00:54:40.630 --> 00:54:43.810
and we were not ready
to really go and check

00:54:43.810 --> 00:54:46.720
what the hell is happening,
we just give money to support.

00:54:46.720 --> 00:54:50.290
But one day I realized that the
orphanage we all were funding,

00:54:50.290 --> 00:54:54.010
they were giving
drugs to the kids,

00:54:54.010 --> 00:54:57.760
and they were abducting
kids from other places

00:54:57.760 --> 00:55:00.130
to just make the orphanage big.

00:55:00.130 --> 00:55:01.240
Right?

00:55:01.240 --> 00:55:04.870
So all of a sudden,
this give me an anger.

00:55:04.870 --> 00:55:08.860
I know I myself [INAUDIBLE]
I teach meditation.

00:55:08.860 --> 00:55:09.730
TIM DESMOND: Yeah.

00:55:09.730 --> 00:55:15.250
AUDIENCE: And I do know well,
should just enjoy the fact

00:55:15.250 --> 00:55:16.890
that, OK, stuff happen.

00:55:16.890 --> 00:55:21.000
Now, look in the future,
and don't do the mistake.

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:24.870
Or I just keep this
small anger in myself

00:55:24.870 --> 00:55:27.850
to help me motivate
to fight against it.

00:55:27.850 --> 00:55:28.880
TIM DESMOND: Yeah, yeah.

00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:32.410
AUDIENCE: So my question is,
should I let go and enjoy

00:55:32.410 --> 00:55:35.940
my life, or should I keep this
anger and fight against it?

00:55:35.940 --> 00:55:37.540
TIM DESMOND: Yeah, yeah.

00:55:37.540 --> 00:55:38.060
Thank you.

00:55:42.210 --> 00:55:43.920
I'm glad you feel
angry about that.

00:55:49.250 --> 00:55:52.220
Some people talk about
the goal of meditation

00:55:52.220 --> 00:55:56.930
is like to no longer
have negative emotions

00:55:56.930 --> 00:56:01.040
or even to stop your thinking,
as though like being brain

00:56:01.040 --> 00:56:08.190
dead is like a better
situation than being alive.

00:56:08.190 --> 00:56:11.910
So for me, any
type of meditation,

00:56:11.910 --> 00:56:14.280
the goal of that
meditation comes

00:56:14.280 --> 00:56:17.100
down to what is your
goal about the person

00:56:17.100 --> 00:56:18.480
that you want to
be in the world.

00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:21.240
And actually, it's not
so much like how can I

00:56:21.240 --> 00:56:26.910
be a good meditator and
just embody whatever

00:56:26.910 --> 00:56:30.000
goals are part of that.

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:33.980
You find a lot more
success in discovering

00:56:33.980 --> 00:56:36.130
who do I want to be?

00:56:36.130 --> 00:56:38.580
What's important to me?

00:56:38.580 --> 00:56:42.030
What are the qualities that
I want to develop in myself,

00:56:42.030 --> 00:56:45.390
and then I want to train
myself in those qualities,

00:56:45.390 --> 00:56:47.730
and I want to know why.

00:56:47.730 --> 00:56:51.000
Why do I want to be this
way and not that way?

00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:51.540
Right?

00:56:51.540 --> 00:56:57.350
So like in what way do I
want-- how would I like

00:56:57.350 --> 00:56:59.930
to react in a moment like that?

00:56:59.930 --> 00:57:04.850
And I'm 100% not
going to prescribe

00:57:04.850 --> 00:57:07.490
some sort of a
right way to react,

00:57:07.490 --> 00:57:15.140
but I can say that it is the
inevitable human response when

00:57:15.140 --> 00:57:18.690
you're in touch with
suffering that it brings up

00:57:18.690 --> 00:57:20.700
suffering in you.

00:57:20.700 --> 00:57:25.500
In Buddhist
psychology, the saying

00:57:25.500 --> 00:57:30.470
is that the nature of mind
is dual and permeable.

00:57:30.470 --> 00:57:32.867
If you're really
happy, being around

00:57:32.867 --> 00:57:35.450
you is going to make me happy,
and if you're really suffering,

00:57:35.450 --> 00:57:37.550
being around you is going
to bring up suffering in me.

00:57:37.550 --> 00:57:39.830
The question is, what do I
do with the suffering that

00:57:39.830 --> 00:57:43.240
comes up in me?

00:57:43.240 --> 00:57:46.200
Am I dominated by it?

00:57:46.200 --> 00:57:50.910
Suffering, I would
say, is a good servant

00:57:50.910 --> 00:57:55.530
and a terrible master,
because suffering

00:57:55.530 --> 00:58:00.510
is a necessary
component of compassion.

00:58:00.510 --> 00:58:04.920
There would be no compassion,
if we couldn't suffer.

00:58:04.920 --> 00:58:07.340
So I recognize the
suffering in me,

00:58:07.340 --> 00:58:12.590
and then I want to relate
to that suffering with love

00:58:12.590 --> 00:58:13.250
in myself.

00:58:13.250 --> 00:58:15.734
I want to be able to
accept that in me,

00:58:15.734 --> 00:58:17.150
and I want to be
able to recognize

00:58:17.150 --> 00:58:21.020
that the entire spectrum
of human experience

00:58:21.020 --> 00:58:24.720
is welcome in me.

00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:27.180
I want to make
friends with my anger.

00:58:27.180 --> 00:58:31.997
I don't want to somehow decide
that I shouldn't be angry.

00:58:31.997 --> 00:58:34.580
And that the more that I'm able
to make friends with my anger,

00:58:34.580 --> 00:58:39.500
the more that I'm able to listen
to it and act with wisdom.

00:58:39.500 --> 00:58:40.000
Thank you.

00:58:43.460 --> 00:58:45.902
MICHAEL VAN RIPER: So we're
actually almost at time.

00:58:45.902 --> 00:58:47.360
Well, we can take
another question.

00:58:47.360 --> 00:58:49.040
I just want to be
respectful if people

00:58:49.040 --> 00:58:50.960
have to go somewhere at one.

00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:54.410
I also don't know if our live
stream will cut out that one,

00:58:54.410 --> 00:58:58.010
or if we can keep it
going for a little bit.

00:58:58.010 --> 00:59:01.160
But I had one question
from the Dory,

00:59:01.160 --> 00:59:03.650
and then we can go for
a few minutes past,

00:59:03.650 --> 00:59:05.330
because we have the
room beyond one.

00:59:09.800 --> 00:59:11.560
This person had two questions.

00:59:11.560 --> 00:59:13.130
We'll see [INAUDIBLE].

00:59:13.130 --> 00:59:16.850
What can we do every day to
stop being negative and bringing

00:59:16.850 --> 00:59:18.150
ourselves down?

00:59:18.150 --> 00:59:20.717
That's the first
question, and also,

00:59:20.717 --> 00:59:23.300
after I speak with someone, or
I'm afraid to approach someone,

00:59:23.300 --> 00:59:26.900
I get very angry and have
regrets for not being confident

00:59:26.900 --> 00:59:29.040
and beat myself up.

00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:31.114
How can I deal with
those feelings?

00:59:31.114 --> 00:59:33.780
We have limited time, so you can
choose which of those two you--

00:59:33.780 --> 00:59:34.730
TIM DESMOND: I'll
use the second one.

00:59:34.730 --> 00:59:36.400
It's a little more [INAUDIBLE].

00:59:36.400 --> 00:59:37.565
It's more like specific.

00:59:41.510 --> 00:59:45.760
I want to approach somebody
and insecurity arises in me.

00:59:45.760 --> 00:59:48.580
So the real question
is, how can I be

00:59:48.580 --> 00:59:51.670
kind to the insecurity in me?

00:59:51.670 --> 00:59:53.440
How can I recognize--

00:59:53.440 --> 00:59:55.450
instead of identifying
with it, instead of

00:59:55.450 --> 01:00:00.780
saying like, this insecurity
is me, and it's bad,

01:00:00.780 --> 01:00:03.420
I can recognize that
insecurity is something

01:00:03.420 --> 01:00:07.330
that every human
being experiences.

01:00:07.330 --> 01:00:11.020
And probably, it's
a transmission

01:00:11.020 --> 01:00:13.900
that I've received from
whatever experiences

01:00:13.900 --> 01:00:18.050
or my parents, my ancestors.

01:00:18.050 --> 01:00:22.010
And the question is, how can
I relate to that insecurity

01:00:22.010 --> 01:00:23.220
with compassion?

01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:31.360
So after I want to
approach somebody

01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:34.710
and then don't and
feel bad about it,

01:00:34.710 --> 01:00:38.720
then I want to
stop and recognize

01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:41.370
that there is insecurity in me.

01:00:41.370 --> 01:00:45.780
And I want to ask
myself, is it possible

01:00:45.780 --> 01:00:48.990
for me to relate to this
insecurity with compassion?

01:00:48.990 --> 01:00:52.320
Now, the insecurity
in me, if it seems

01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:55.650
like a beautiful crying baby
that just feels anxious,

01:00:55.650 --> 01:00:56.990
then I can hold it like that.

01:00:56.990 --> 01:00:59.790
If it seems like
a little monster,

01:00:59.790 --> 01:01:02.770
then I need to look
a little deeper

01:01:02.770 --> 01:01:07.090
and try to understand
how is that insecurity

01:01:07.090 --> 01:01:09.610
have some sort of a
life-serving purpose?

01:01:09.610 --> 01:01:12.660
How is it trying
to keep me safe?

01:01:12.660 --> 01:01:16.140
How is it trying to steer
me away from suffering

01:01:16.140 --> 01:01:17.520
and toward happiness?

01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:21.740
And if I can see
that as the basis,

01:01:21.740 --> 01:01:24.270
then it becomes easier to
relate to with compassion.

01:01:27.700 --> 01:01:30.349
Yeah?

01:01:30.349 --> 01:01:30.890
AUDIENCE: Hi.

01:01:30.890 --> 01:01:32.967
Thank you.

01:01:32.967 --> 01:01:34.550
Really don't have a
whole lot of words

01:01:34.550 --> 01:01:37.640
to describe how I feel right
now, other than this feeling

01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:38.722
of coming home.

01:01:38.722 --> 01:01:40.430
Just everything that
you've talked about,

01:01:40.430 --> 01:01:42.140
there's just this
resonance of home.

01:01:42.140 --> 01:01:43.132
So thank you for that.

01:01:43.132 --> 01:01:44.090
TIM DESMOND: Thank you.

01:01:44.090 --> 01:01:45.630
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
my question though

01:01:45.630 --> 01:01:49.310
is when you were talking
about the first tool,

01:01:49.310 --> 01:01:52.310
about seeing what's
already beautiful,

01:01:52.310 --> 01:01:54.030
So I do a lot of that.

01:01:54.030 --> 01:01:55.490
And it's something
that I do daily,

01:01:55.490 --> 01:01:56.900
and it's come naturally to me.

01:01:56.900 --> 01:02:02.150
But something-- I am a fixer,
and I love to solution things,

01:02:02.150 --> 01:02:03.894
and I have this
commitment to my life

01:02:03.894 --> 01:02:05.810
that if I'm going to
complain about something,

01:02:05.810 --> 01:02:06.852
I better have a solution.

01:02:06.852 --> 01:02:07.601
TIM DESMOND: Sure.

01:02:07.601 --> 01:02:09.440
AUDIENCE: Or else,
don't complain about it.

01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:12.290
And I have an 11-year-old
boy, and there's

01:02:12.290 --> 01:02:13.770
a lot of litter in San Jose.

01:02:13.770 --> 01:02:18.170
It's absolutely filthy, and my
eye is constantly seeing it.

01:02:18.170 --> 01:02:19.850
And it comes-- my
mind says, well, this

01:02:19.850 --> 01:02:22.580
is because I want a solution it,
and that's a beautiful thing.

01:02:22.580 --> 01:02:23.150
TIM DESMOND: Yeah.

01:02:23.150 --> 01:02:24.525
AUDIENCE: Well,
a couple of weeks

01:02:24.525 --> 01:02:27.185
ago, my son said to me, mom,
stop looking at the trash

01:02:27.185 --> 01:02:29.060
and look at everything
else that's beautiful.

01:02:29.060 --> 01:02:31.510
It's not the only
thing that's around.

01:02:31.510 --> 01:02:33.010
And I loved that
he said that to me.

01:02:33.010 --> 01:02:36.140
He's a beautiful mirror.

01:02:36.140 --> 01:02:38.480
And I said, yes,
you're right, but if I

01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:41.310
don't look at the trash,
then who's going to fix it?

01:02:41.310 --> 01:02:42.950
TIM DESMOND: Yeah,
so it's a balance.

01:02:42.950 --> 01:02:43.450
Right?

01:02:43.450 --> 01:02:44.300
AUDIENCE: Right.

01:02:44.300 --> 01:02:48.020
TIM DESMOND: It's not
only look at the trash

01:02:48.020 --> 01:02:50.660
or pretend the
trash isn't there.

01:02:50.660 --> 01:02:51.630
Right?

01:02:51.630 --> 01:02:54.690
We want to be like--

01:02:54.690 --> 01:02:59.490
the question is like, who
I want to be in the world?

01:02:59.490 --> 01:03:07.540
I want to be somebody who acts
to make my community better,

01:03:07.540 --> 01:03:14.050
but who isn't debilitated
by the amount of work that's

01:03:14.050 --> 01:03:15.190
in front of me.

01:03:15.190 --> 01:03:15.880
Right?

01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:17.950
So what I want to do is it's--

01:03:17.950 --> 01:03:22.090
and that's when we talk
about being present,

01:03:22.090 --> 01:03:24.450
what it means in this
situation is coming back to you

01:03:24.450 --> 01:03:26.920
in this moment.

01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:30.080
Do I need to be looking
more at the litter,

01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:31.580
or more at everything else?

01:03:31.580 --> 01:03:35.810
It's not about always.

01:03:35.810 --> 01:03:41.890
It's right now, do I move myself
a little left or a little right

01:03:41.890 --> 01:03:45.910
in order to be in the place
that I want to be right now?

01:03:45.910 --> 01:03:49.160
And so it's this
constant question

01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:54.110
of re-orienting and
finding a balance that's

01:03:54.110 --> 01:03:56.990
going to help me be the
person I want to be.

01:03:59.832 --> 01:04:01.040
AUDIENCE: That's was perfect.

01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:01.769
Thank you.

01:04:09.753 --> 01:04:11.260
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:04:11.260 --> 01:04:12.140
It's great talk.

01:04:12.140 --> 01:04:13.480
I did enjoyed it.

01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:15.600
I wanted to ask about one thing.

01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:18.040
So definitely the 30 minute
training every day something

01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:19.030
that might--

01:04:19.030 --> 01:04:20.980
I can definitely see
it having benefits.

01:04:20.980 --> 01:04:24.430
But most of us in our
work, we are engineers.

01:04:24.430 --> 01:04:29.440
We are writing code or dealing
with maybe all kind of stuff

01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:32.500
at work or at home.

01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:35.530
I also saw this kind of probably
there's an answer already

01:04:35.530 --> 01:04:40.030
to it, but I would like to
see some sort of tools that

01:04:40.030 --> 01:04:44.470
can help me in the moment
rather than doing a training 30

01:04:44.470 --> 01:04:47.140
minutes in the morning.

01:04:47.140 --> 01:04:49.660
Would that-- I think,
I did see a third thing

01:04:49.660 --> 01:04:50.500
which was the deck.

01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:50.740
I don't know.

01:04:50.740 --> 01:04:52.640
Maybe that's the answer to the
question or maybe something

01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:53.140
else.

01:04:53.140 --> 01:04:58.310
TIM DESMOND: You know,
what I would say is,

01:04:58.310 --> 01:05:03.340
for me, what it comes
down to ultimately is

01:05:03.340 --> 01:05:06.560
getting clear about who do
I want to be in the world?

01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:09.366
What are the qualities that
I want to develop in me?

01:05:09.366 --> 01:05:10.990
And so let's say what
I want to develop

01:05:10.990 --> 01:05:13.450
is just sort of greater
peace, contentment, happiness,

01:05:13.450 --> 01:05:17.740
whatever it is, compassion.

01:05:17.740 --> 01:05:20.770
And there are four
basic categories

01:05:20.770 --> 01:05:23.130
of personal practice.

01:05:23.130 --> 01:05:26.840
A formal daily practice
is just one of them.

01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:30.530
So first category we can think
of as a formal daily practice,

01:05:30.530 --> 01:05:32.560
and the reason that
I orient the workbook

01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:37.390
around the formal daily practice
is that most of the research

01:05:37.390 --> 01:05:42.990
comes from explicit practice
for an explicit amount of time.

01:05:42.990 --> 01:05:46.160
The second category, sort of
a broad category of practice,

01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:50.060
we might consider an informal
moment-to-moment practice,

01:05:50.060 --> 01:05:52.730
which is about recognizing.

01:05:52.730 --> 01:05:58.490
So it might be finding one
activity that I do every day,

01:05:58.490 --> 01:06:00.260
stepping into the
shower, turning

01:06:00.260 --> 01:06:03.110
on my car, whatever it is.

01:06:03.110 --> 01:06:10.930
And asking myself, can I
create a poem or a reminder

01:06:10.930 --> 01:06:15.730
that will help me to get
into the frame of mind

01:06:15.730 --> 01:06:19.956
that I would like to
be in, in this moment?

01:06:19.956 --> 01:06:21.330
When my teacher,
Thich Nhat Hanh,

01:06:21.330 --> 01:06:26.790
first became a Buddhist monk
in Vietnam, the first element

01:06:26.790 --> 01:06:29.340
of his training he was
given a book of poems,

01:06:29.340 --> 01:06:31.980
and he was told to memorize.

01:06:31.980 --> 01:06:36.840
And there was a poem for waking
up, for putting on your robes,

01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:40.650
putting on your shoes,
for washing your face.

01:06:40.650 --> 01:06:43.560
And he was supposed
to recite these poems

01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:45.690
as he went through
his day, and that

01:06:45.690 --> 01:06:50.650
was like the first stage
of monastic training.

01:06:50.650 --> 01:06:53.800
The poem-- he's translated
these poems in a book

01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:57.160
called "Present Moment,
Wonderful Moment."

01:06:57.160 --> 01:06:59.320
Kind of an example,
the poem for waking up

01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:02.860
is, waking up this
morning I smile.

01:07:02.860 --> 01:07:06.130
24 brand new hours to be alive.

01:07:06.130 --> 01:07:09.820
I vow to look at living beings
with the eyes of compassion.

01:07:09.820 --> 01:07:11.020
So you say that.

01:07:11.020 --> 01:07:14.860
So there is
moment-to-moment practice.

01:07:14.860 --> 01:07:19.060
Then, there is
intensive retreats.

01:07:19.060 --> 01:07:22.820
If you want to learn, let's
say, I like a foreign language,

01:07:22.820 --> 01:07:25.220
what do they say is the
best way to do that?

01:07:25.220 --> 01:07:28.150
Immersion, right?

01:07:28.150 --> 01:07:32.200
So we can think of a retreat
as kind of like immersion

01:07:32.200 --> 01:07:35.650
in the training of
mindfulness and compassion.

01:07:35.650 --> 01:07:39.020
Similar to immersion
in language,

01:07:39.020 --> 01:07:41.910
you take up a lot
more a lot quicker

01:07:41.910 --> 01:07:43.930
with that sort of a practice.

01:07:43.930 --> 01:07:47.920
And the fourth category
is a supportive community,

01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:55.430
having people around you
that share your enthusiasm,

01:07:55.430 --> 01:08:00.040
or that can at least
feed that purpose in you.

01:08:00.040 --> 01:08:04.150
And so some people
really feel like

01:08:04.150 --> 01:08:06.340
their daily formal practice
is where they shine.

01:08:06.340 --> 01:08:08.590
It's what feels most important.

01:08:08.590 --> 01:08:12.260
Other people aren't able to
do the daily formal practice,

01:08:12.260 --> 01:08:15.070
but they try to go on an
intensive retreat once or twice

01:08:15.070 --> 01:08:16.740
a year.

01:08:16.740 --> 01:08:20.620
Other people, it's really
the informal practice

01:08:20.620 --> 01:08:24.120
that they put their energy into.

01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:27.390
So finding something,
trying out something

01:08:27.390 --> 01:08:30.300
from those different categories,
can be really helpful.

01:08:30.300 --> 01:08:33.689
But just like learning
a new language,

01:08:33.689 --> 01:08:36.840
just like learning to play an
instrument, what it comes down

01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:40.740
to is deliberate
practice in whatever form

01:08:40.740 --> 01:08:43.140
that's going to take if you
want something to create

01:08:43.140 --> 01:08:45.021
real change in your life.

01:08:45.021 --> 01:08:47.229
MICHAEL VAN RIPER: We're
going to have to wrap it up,

01:08:47.229 --> 01:08:48.390
but I want to thank Tim.

01:08:48.390 --> 01:08:49.590
Let's give--

01:08:49.590 --> 01:08:52.940
[APPLAUSE]
