00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.375
What I want to do in this
video is talk a little bit more

00:00:02.375 --> 00:00:03.880
about the concept
of an organelle.

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.190
And as you can see it
contains the word organ,

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.320
and that's because the
idea of an organelle

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.217
is related to the
idea of an organ.

00:00:14.217 --> 00:00:15.800
If you're talking
about a human being,

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.570
if you're talking about
me, I have a liver.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.180
A liver is an organ.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:20.926
I have lungs.

00:00:20.926 --> 00:00:21.550
I have a heart.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.270
These are substructures of Sal.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:31.740
Similarly, an organelle is
a substructure of the cell.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.120
You could view it as almost
an organ of the cell.

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.070
And actually let me be a little
bit more particular there,

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.610
membrane-bound
structure of cell.

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.050
So for example,
let me draw a cell.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.280
So that is my cell
right over here.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.180
We're already familiar
with the idea of a nucleus.

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.760
A nucleus is a
membrane-bound structure,

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.090
so it is an organelle, nucleus.

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.810
We've talked about the
endoplasmic reticulum, which

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.830
is also a membrane-bound
structure,

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.840
so it is also an organelle.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.320
We have talked about
the Golgi bodies.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.730
Once again membrane-bound
structures, so it

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:35.480
is also an organelle.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.680
So that's a Golgi
body right over there.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.510
We have the endoplasmic
reticulum right over there.

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.270
And by this definition even
these small little vesicles,

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.700
these little membranes that
are carrying things around,

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.140
even these vesicles could be
considered to be organelles.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.800
Vesicle.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.990
And if you have
really large vesicles,

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.410
or a bunch of these
vesicles fused together,

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.000
you have these larger
membrane-bound structures

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.280
called vacuoles, which
could just be really viewed

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.220
as large vesicles or a bunch
of vesicles fused together.

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.960
Vacuoles.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.130
All of these things, these are
all membrane-bound structures

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.539
inside the cell, and so these
are all considered organelles.

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:25.580
Now some people are a
little bit more particular.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.580
When they really talk
about organelles they say,

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.350
OK, we could say maybe
membrane-bound structures,

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.100
but there are some
organelles that are not

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.160
only membrane-bound, but
they also have their own DNA.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.320
For example, you
have mitochondria,

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:48.840
which I will do in pink, which
exist in most eukaryotes.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.330
And this is really
the energy-producing,

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.690
I guess you could say, the
energy factory of the cell.

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:58.955
Let me draw it like this.

00:02:58.955 --> 00:03:01.770
It has an inner and
an outer membrane,

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.610
so that right over
there is mitochondria.

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.440
It really takes sugars and
is able to take that sugar

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.250
chemical energy and turn it
into ATP, which I guess is still

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.680
a chemical energy but a more
useful, or a more readily-used

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.970
form of energy.

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.890
Mitochondria.

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.275
In plants you have plastids.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.790
And the most famous, or at
least from our point of view

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.170
the most famous of
these are chloroplasts

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.180
where photosynthesis
takes place, where you're

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.010
taking light energy
and turning that

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.440
into chemical energy
in the form of sugars.

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.990
So this right over here,
this is a chloroplast.

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.820
Let me go into much
more detail with those

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.270
when we talk about
photosynthesis.

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:52.930
So that right over
there, a chloroplast,

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.980
which is a more particular
form of a plastid.

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.860
So I just drew a chloroplast.

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.130
But that's a more particular
form of a plastid.

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.100
It also has its own DNA.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.960
And so mitochondria
and plastids generally

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.200
are fascinating
because it is believed,

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.850
because they have their own
DNA and they can replicate

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:23.270
themselves, that it's believed
that their ancestors were once

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.180
independent prokaryotes.

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.710
And at some point these
independent prokaryotes

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.630
started to get together and
into a membrane-bound structure

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.670
started to work
together in symbiosis.

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:40.600
And that kind of collaborative
of these prokaryotes working

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:46.490
together is believed to be
the predecessor of, say,

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.420
many modern cells that
contain these structures.

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:51.410
So it's a really
fascinating window

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.990
into how these things
actually might have formed.

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:57.550
But the big picture
here that I just

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.460
want to make sure we understand,
is that organelles, really,

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.710
it's generally viewed as any
membrane-bound structure,

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.110
anything as simple as a vesicle,
all the way to something that

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:13.050
has its own DNA, like
mitochondria or plastids.
