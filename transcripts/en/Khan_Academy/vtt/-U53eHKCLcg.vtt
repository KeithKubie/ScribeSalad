00:00:00.055 --> 00:00:02.341
- [Voiceover] We've already
seen that a vector is defined

00:00:02.341 --> 00:00:04.780
by both its magnitude and its direction.

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:07.381
What I want to do in this
video is get some practice

00:00:07.381 --> 00:00:10.715
calculating or figuring out
the magnitudes of vectors

00:00:10.715 --> 00:00:12.341
and I have a vector right over here,

00:00:12.341 --> 00:00:14.640
vector u, it is, it is,

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.974
visually depicted here on our corded plane

00:00:17.974 --> 00:00:19.193
and I wanna figure out its magnitude

00:00:19.193 --> 00:00:20.611
and I encourage you to pause the video

00:00:20.611 --> 00:00:24.322
and see if you can figure it out.

00:00:24.322 --> 00:00:25.802
Well the magnitude of a vector,

00:00:25.802 --> 00:00:27.357
just the length of this line

00:00:27.357 --> 00:00:30.400
you could view it as the distance
between the initial point

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.174
and the terminal point right over there

00:00:33.174 --> 00:00:34.881
and so one way to think about it,

00:00:34.881 --> 00:00:36.460
you could view this,

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:37.737
the magnitude of the vector,

00:00:37.737 --> 00:00:38.700
let me write this.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.781
The magnitude of the vector.

00:00:41.781 --> 00:00:44.080
Well you could either think
of it as the distance formula,

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.095
which is really, just
comes straight out of the

00:00:46.095 --> 00:00:47.029
Pythagorean theorem.

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:49.745
It's going to be the square root of our

00:00:49.745 --> 00:00:53.060
change in x squared

00:00:53.205 --> 00:00:56.741
change in x squared

00:00:56.886 --> 00:00:59.092
plus change in y squared

00:00:59.092 --> 00:01:01.994
plus change in y squared.

00:01:01.994 --> 00:01:03.236
Once again this triangle,

00:01:03.236 --> 00:01:05.233
Greek letter delta is just shorthand

00:01:05.233 --> 00:01:06.812
for change in y

00:01:06.812 --> 00:01:08.333
and this once again
comes straight out of the

00:01:08.333 --> 00:01:10.293
distance formula which really comes out of

00:01:10.293 --> 00:01:12.025
the Pythagorean theorem.

00:01:12.025 --> 00:01:13.753
It'll become a little bit
more obvious when I draw

00:01:13.753 --> 00:01:15.773
the change in y and I draw the change in x

00:01:15.773 --> 00:01:17.572
on this diagram.

00:01:17.572 --> 00:01:19.406
So what's our change in y?

00:01:19.406 --> 00:01:20.870
Well we're starting at our initial point.

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.888
We're starting at y is equal to nine

00:01:23.888 --> 00:01:26.663
and we are, to get to the y value

00:01:26.663 --> 00:01:28.149
of our terminal point,

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:32.358
we're going down to y is equal to two.

00:01:32.358 --> 00:01:34.444
So we have a change in y

00:01:34.444 --> 00:01:37.277
our change in y is equal to,

00:01:37.277 --> 00:01:38.762
going from nine to two,

00:01:38.762 --> 00:01:42.001
our change in y is negative seven.

00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:44.973
Similarly, our change in x

00:01:44.973 --> 00:01:47.877
we're going from x is equal to two,

00:01:47.877 --> 00:01:50.082
to x is equal to five.

00:01:50.082 --> 00:01:53.681
So our change in the horizontal
direction is plus three.

00:01:53.681 --> 00:01:56.514
So our change in x

00:01:56.514 --> 00:01:58.174
where we can either think
of this as the horizontal

00:01:58.174 --> 00:01:59.881
component of the vector.

00:01:59.881 --> 00:02:02.284
This is equal to positive three

00:02:02.284 --> 00:02:03.515
and as we've just seen

00:02:03.515 --> 00:02:05.605
we have drawn a right triangle

00:02:05.605 --> 00:02:07.357
and so we can use a Pythagorean theorem

00:02:07.357 --> 00:02:09.487
to figure out, to figure out the length

00:02:09.487 --> 00:02:10.810
of the hypotenuse and
you might say wait, wait,

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.831
a length of a side of a triangle
can't have a negative value

00:02:13.831 --> 00:02:15.988
and that's why these squareds are valuable

00:02:15.988 --> 00:02:18.356
because it doesn't matter
if you're taking a negative

00:02:18.356 --> 00:02:20.191
seven squared or a positive seven squared,

00:02:20.191 --> 00:02:21.967
you're going to get a positive value here

00:02:21.967 --> 00:02:24.057
and if you really just
view this as a triangle,

00:02:24.057 --> 00:02:28.126
all you care about is
the length of this side

00:02:28.126 --> 00:02:30.348
right over here or it's
the magnitude of this side

00:02:30.348 --> 00:02:32.554
or the absolute value of it
which is just going to be

00:02:32.554 --> 00:02:34.353
positive seven

00:02:34.353 --> 00:02:36.885
and so we can say this
is going to be equal to

00:02:36.885 --> 00:02:41.447
the magnitude of our vector
is going to be equal to

00:02:41.447 --> 00:02:44.994
so three squared is nine,

00:02:45.452 --> 00:02:48.199
nine, and then

00:02:48.228 --> 00:02:51.467
negative seven squared is positive 49.

00:02:51.467 --> 00:02:54.764
So plus 49

00:02:54.764 --> 00:02:56.226
or once again you could view this as our

00:02:56.226 --> 00:02:57.225
change in y squared

00:02:57.225 --> 00:02:58.989
which is negative seven squared

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:00.325
or you could say,

00:03:00.325 --> 00:03:01.034
well just look,

00:03:01.034 --> 00:03:03.193
the absolute value,
the length of the side,

00:03:03.193 --> 00:03:04.493
we don't wanna think of a side as having

00:03:04.493 --> 00:03:06.432
a negative value, the
negative really just says,

00:03:06.432 --> 00:03:08.011
hey we're going from the top to the bottom

00:03:08.011 --> 00:03:09.555
it gives us our direction,

00:03:09.555 --> 00:03:10.774
but if we just say the length of it

00:03:10.774 --> 00:03:12.388
it's seven, well you're there

00:03:12.388 --> 00:03:13.863
if you just use a Pythagorean theorem.

00:03:13.863 --> 00:03:16.173
Seven squared would also be 49

00:03:16.173 --> 00:03:18.402
and so either way you get

00:03:18.402 --> 00:03:20.631
the magnitude of our vector is equal to

00:03:20.631 --> 00:03:23.685
the square root of nine plus 49

00:03:23.685 --> 00:03:25.532
is going to be

00:03:25.532 --> 00:03:30.480
57, I don't think I can
simplify this radical

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.490
too much, no that's it.

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:34.288
So the magnitude of this vector

00:03:34.288 --> 00:03:37.083
is the square root of 57.
