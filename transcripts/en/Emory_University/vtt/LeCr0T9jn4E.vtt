"Almost two years ago, we announced that DeKalb Medical would be seeking a partner for the future,

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:18.989
and then almost a year ago we selected Emory Healthcare as that partner."

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:21.719
Emery Healthcare leadership and community dignitaries

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:28.019
were recently on hand to celebrate the partnership between DeKalb Medical and Emory Healthcare.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:33.570
"We are now stronger than we have ever been as we move into this partnership with Emory."

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.360
"The partnership will bring together two organizations that really have community care at their center,

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:41.819
and by combining the resources of the two organizations,

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.039
we're going to be able to provide services in communities that haven't had those services.

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:52.559
We're also going to be able to take care of our community in ways that we haven't even imagined in the past."

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.479
In addition to DeKalb Medical on North Decatur Road becoming Emory Decatur Hospital,

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:04.290
DeKalb Medical Hillandale is now Emory Hillandale Hospital and DeKalb Medical Long-term Acute Care

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.279
Downtown Decatur is now called Emory Long-term Acute Care.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.369
"So today signifies an important turning point for both of our organizations,

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:19.379
and I count myself extremely fortunate to be part of this inspiring and transformational event."

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:26.789
"Really the big winner is the community. It's the communities served by both the DeKalb Medical

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.270
hospitals, physicians, as well as the communities served by Emory Healthcare."

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:36.629
"I'm hearing excellent things --- the patients here in DeKalb and the community are more excited than we are as

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:45.689
employees because they feel like they're going to have first-class service throughout DeKalb County."

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.819
"It's not about getting bigger simply for the sake of being bigger. It's really about having that

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.810
relevant size that allows you to better meet the needs of your population.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.009
We're incredibly excited to welcome the DeKalb family to the broader Emory Healthcare, making us almost 25,000 people strong,

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:09.399
three additional acute care facilities and really the ability to better meet the needs of the community and all their healthcare needs.
