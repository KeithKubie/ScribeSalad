00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.570
Sup guys. I'm in hawaii. You've been asking for a vlog so here's a vlog now

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.410
I don't normally do vlogs, but we're going to try it out and if you don't like it

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.510
Give me a thumbs down on this video if you do like it

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.219
Give me a thumbs up on this video if we get a hundred thousand thumbs ups maybe I'll make another vlog

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.948
But here's what we're doing today. My wife is over here on the hammock hanging out [checking] social media or something and

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:26.519
In my hand. And my little boy is over here blowing bubbles right you got to love how there's like palm trees everywhere

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:32.520
[we've] got coconut start over here coconut tree, and if we turn [right] we've got a little banana tree right there as well, [so]

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.969
[we've] been going to the beach [pretty] much every day today

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.989
We're going to the dole plantation, and I've got my meet up tonight at the sand Island the ala

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.099
Moana Beach Park area at 4:30 to 5:30. I don't really expect anybody's going to show up

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.780
It's kind of a small island short notice

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.550
But I thought it would be terrible if I miss the opportunity to do a meet-up in Hawaii while we're here

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.779
We have been here for two [weeks]. [I've] filmed and worked on videos every single day since we've been here

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.189
It's supposed to be a vacation but for me. It's [just] kind of a relocation vacation

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.649
It's been a ton of fun though, and you can't beat the scenery

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:07.379
This is our backyard [the] place that we're staying we've got palm trees banana trees coconut trees

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.229
Looking down you see random coconuts everywhere

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.999
We've busted open a lot of coconuts, and had a lot of coconut milk and juice and we're loving it cool Little trick

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.189
I figured out was you could take the husk out of the inside of coconut shells like this and turn it into rope

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.849
So I've got a tutorial coming on how to do that how to make rope [out] of coconut husk

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.900
[I] also visited the polynesian cultural center [and] learned some cool tricks on making one of those Hawaii

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.669
Headbands out of palm leaves and cool little fish toys. So we got some tutorials coming on as well

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.700
We take you inside the house and give you a little house tour

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.439
So this is our little beach house is where we're staying my friend mark is with us. That's his bed right there

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.869
We didn't have enough room for him

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.799
He's over here right now working on some of the audio that we just record on the beach

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.839
We're doing a sponsored video for lifevantage. So we're putting that together recording with this equipment here

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.750
This is a sony A6300 and we only have two bedrooms

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.130
So that's where Janae

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.199
And I sleep and this is where the kids are [sleeping] right now looks like we got reefs in they're working on Minecraft right now

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:07.049
House is pretty cool. It's got little paintings all over the walls nice Little Hawaiian decorations

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.669
It's not a bad little place to hang out. It's costing us [about] [$3,000] to be here for three weeks

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.389
[the] shower is Terribly small, but at least it works. I

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.839
Just got the stealth shelf loaded up. I'm going to be giving this thing away today down on the sand Island in the ala

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.360
Moana Beach Park area it is our first factory prototype, and I just don't have enough room in my luggage to take it home

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.499
So I thought it made more sense to give it away [160] dollar value plus free shipping

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.860
But somebody who comes out to see me today is going to get that it's Gonna be fun

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.419
Oh and Here's some of my headbands that I've made these are made out of palm leaves and once you learn the technique

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.220
It's just a simple weave but very cool

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.139
And I love wearing these things makes me feel like an island boy all right off to the dole plantation. We're here dole plantation

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:54.899
You guys gotta see these trees these are crazy trees are like multicolored like all the different layers of bark that peel off green Maroon

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:56.770
Orange

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:58.570
very very pretty

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:59.890
so we had huge

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.830
Construction driving out here it took about 40 minutes longer than it should have that means we've only got an hour here at the [dole]

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.750
Plantation to ride a train go see the fish get a dole whip and head over to Magic Island so we can do the meet

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.750
Up tonight

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.830
is that

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.690
Got the whole crew loaded up, and we were headed down to Magic Island for the main group

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.000
So some of you know many of you do not I used to live [in] Hawaii

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.639
I used to work out here flying the mail for one of the local [airlines] from Island Island [and] I wrote a moped and this

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:44.698
Is the Nimitz Highway that I would ride in Honolulu all the time?

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:48.869
I worked the night shift which means I had the days free and I would go exploring during the days

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:53.579
So it worked as a tour bus driver for Roberts Hawaii. How crazy. Is that okay?

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:58.530
So update we are in rush-hour traffic on Nimitz Highway however. We're only ten minutes away from Magic Island

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:04.720
[it's] 405 that means we're gonna get there at 4:15. That's 15 minutes early for the [meet and] great things are looking good so far

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:09.980
*unintelligible*

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.160
All right, lets go fly a drone

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.340
All right, I think it's time to do the drawing on the stealth shelf

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:05.840
*unintelligible*

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:40.140
Like whoo look at I know I like what are you looking at? Oh your self? Yes, you're so handsome

00:06:41.059 --> 00:06:43.639
Yeah, you see that is my queen of Random anyway

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:49.308
It's like a quarter to seven right now where our one-hour session turned into like two almost two and a half hours

00:06:49.309 --> 00:06:54.018
Yeah, there were there were probably over a hundred people that showed up tonight. That was so awesome so cool

00:06:55.499 --> 00:07:00.049
honestly, I thought we're gonna choke to the park and just have lunch and then go home and I wish we had some lunch because

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:05.359
Our children are starving people of oahu are awesome. Yeah, we love you guys in a great time well, what an incredible day?

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:08.149
We just made it home. We did stop at Costco and got some pizzas

00:07:08.149 --> 00:07:12.109
I had the whole family [it] was awesome stuff, and my phone's got 1% battery left

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:16.129
