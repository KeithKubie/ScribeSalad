00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let me ask a more general question now.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
What may happen if h, the heuristic, is not admissible?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
A-star finds the optimal path always.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
A-star may find a suboptimal path in some cases.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
A-star may fail to find a path even if one exists.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Or none of the above.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
In answering this question, it is important to say this is a statement that always applies,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and these statements suggest they just apply sometimes

00:00:32.000 --> 09:59:59.000
under certain circumstances.
