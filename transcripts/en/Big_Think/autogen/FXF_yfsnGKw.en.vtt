that demand or aggregated demand is that

for any welfare analysis and from that

for any welfare analysis and from that
 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:31.859
for any welfare analysis and from that
you can calculate what happened if we

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:31.869
you can calculate what happened if we
 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:34.470
you can calculate what happened if we
increase tax decrease task and so on but

increase tax decrease task and so on but
 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.189

these two forces are independent now

so imagine the following imagine it

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260
so imagine the following imagine it
 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.340
so imagine the following imagine it
tomorrow they double the price of milk

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350
tomorrow they double the price of milk
 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.979
tomorrow they double the price of milk
and half the price of alcohol I would

00:00:58.979 --> 00:00:58.989
and half the price of alcohol I would
 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:00.720

work a happier and with less calcium

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180
work a happier and with less calcium
 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.910
work a happier and with less calcium
okay the prices from yesterday would be

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920
okay the prices from yesterday would be
 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.010
okay the prices from yesterday would be
selling in our mind and will change a

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020
selling in our mind and will change a
 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.350
selling in our mind and will change a
shopping behavior but imagine that this

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.360
shopping behavior but imagine that this
 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.120
shopping behavior but imagine that this
change in pricing would also be

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130
change in pricing would also be
 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.149
change in pricing would also be
accompanied by complete amnesia for any

prices you ever paid for milk and for

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310
prices you ever paid for milk and for
 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.609
prices you ever paid for milk and for
alcohol under those conditions I think

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:20.619
alcohol under those conditions I think
 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:22.380
alcohol under those conditions I think
there wouldn't be much change in how

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390
there wouldn't be much change in how
 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.260
there wouldn't be much change in how
much we consume milk versus versus

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270
much we consume milk versus versus
 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.140
much we consume milk versus versus
alcohol you know milk is kind of a good

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.150
alcohol you know milk is kind of a good
 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:29.700
alcohol you know milk is kind of a good
deal now at four dollars per gallon I

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710
deal now at four dollars per gallon I
 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:30.899
deal now at four dollars per gallon I
think we'll still be a good deal eight

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:30.909
think we'll still be a good deal eight
 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:33.210
think we'll still be a good deal eight
dollars per gallon and wine is a good

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220
dollars per gallon and wine is a good
 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:34.500
dollars per gallon and wine is a good
dealer twenty dollars per bottle let's

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:34.510
dealer twenty dollars per bottle let's
 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:35.760
dealer twenty dollars per bottle let's
say and would still be good at ten

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770
say and would still be good at ten
 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.260
say and would still be good at ten
dollars and per bottle and what this

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270
dollars and per bottle and what this
 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.609
dollars and per bottle and what this
suggests but we have a lot of research

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619
suggests but we have a lot of research
 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:43.140
suggests but we have a lot of research
to show it's not just an anecdote is

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.150
to show it's not just an anecdote is
 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.620
to show it's not just an anecdote is
that what we based on decision is not

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630
that what we based on decision is not
 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.140
that what we based on decision is not
just what we the benefit and cost in our

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150
just what we the benefit and cost in our
 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.690
just what we the benefit and cost in our
hedonic pleasure but also what we did in

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700
hedonic pleasure but also what we did in
 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.969
hedonic pleasure but also what we did in
the past and the past prices that we

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979
the past and the past prices that we
 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:56.640
the past and the past prices that we
encountered so what does it say about

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650
encountered so what does it say about
 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.730
encountered so what does it say about
supply and demand it says that demand

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740
supply and demand it says that demand
 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.370
supply and demand it says that demand
depends on supply if I was born to a

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380
depends on supply if I was born to a
 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.980
depends on supply if I was born to a
world with the MSRP or the suggested

price for milk was four dollars that we

price for milk was four dollars that we
 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.699
price for milk was four dollars that we
find that was born to a world it was

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709
find that was born to a world it was
 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.640
find that was born to a world it was
eight dollars it will be fine and those

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650
eight dollars it will be fine and those
 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.050
eight dollars it will be fine and those
are not unique a demand curves their

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060
are not unique a demand curves their
 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.569
are not unique a demand curves their
demand curves that move is a function of

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:18.579
demand curves that move is a function of
 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:20.159
demand curves that move is a function of
what the supply curve is and what the

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:20.169
what the supply curve is and what the
 

00:02:20.169 --> 00:02:22.980
what the supply curve is and what the
prices are now

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990
prices are now
 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.440
prices are now
if if that's the case it means that

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450
if if that's the case it means that
 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:26.820
if if that's the case it means that
welfare analysis should be thought of

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830
welfare analysis should be thought of
 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.790
welfare analysis should be thought of
very very differently because it means

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800
very very differently because it means
 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.040
very very differently because it means
that when the prices change people would

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050
that when the prices change people would
 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.660
that when the prices change people would
react vigorously to those so again if

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670
react vigorously to those so again if
 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.270
react vigorously to those so again if
price of gasoline jump from a dollar to

price of gasoline jump from a dollar to
 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.740
price of gasoline jump from a dollar to
four dollars per gallon and people would

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750
four dollars per gallon and people would
 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.800
four dollars per gallon and people would
react vigorously in the beginning but if
