00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.423
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:08.650
- Good afternoon, everyone.

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:09.830
Glad to have you here.

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:10.700
I'm Liz Cohen.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.630
I'm dean at the
Radcliffe Institute.

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.090
And I'm so pleased
to welcome all of you

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.870
to Samantha Power's much
anticipated lecture, US Foreign

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.980
Policy From the Inside Out.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.570
As Harvard's Institute
for Advanced Study,

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.940
Radcliffe embraces
a dual mission

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.880
to foster and to share
transformative ideas

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.460
across disciplines.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.410
And we do this by
convening and supporting

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.310
scholars, scientists, artists,
and professionals working

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.760
at the forefront of their
fields and by organizing

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.440
a full calendar of
public programming,

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.050
including lectures, conferences,
performances, and exhibitions.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.540
Now, today, we have
the opportunity

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.180
to hear from someone
who has grappled

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.460
with many of the
most daunting issues

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.170
facing the United
States and the world

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.610
and who has done so from a
number of different vantage

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:04.629
points.

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.520
As a journalist, a scholar, an
activist, and most recently,

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.220
as a senior executive
branch official,

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.150
Samantha Power has been on
the front lines, so to speak,

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.480
throughout her career
in foreign policy.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.090
As a result of her
varied experiences,

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.540
Samantha is well-placed to
explore challenging questions

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.670
around how to balance means and
ends, pragmatism and idealism,

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.340
and competing priorities
in determining

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.830
the appropriate role
for the United States

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.750
on the world stage.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.930
These questions
defy easy analysis,

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.040
and yet, they run through
much of Samantha's work.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.240
In her first book, entitled
A Problem from Hell, America

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.440
and the Age of
Genocide, Samantha

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.490
indicts the US foreign
policy establishment

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.580
for falling short of
our nation's ideals

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.720
by failing to act against
genocide at critical moments

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.100
in embattled hotspots like
Cambodia, Iraq, Bosnia,

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.660
and Rwanda.

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.980
More than that, Samantha charges
that the US distanced itself

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.470
from these conflicts
which fell outside

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.550
of its narrow national interest
by deliberately sidestepping

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.650
moral responsibility.

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.370
A Problem from Hell won the 2002
National Book Critics Circle

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.000
Award for nonfiction
and the 2003 Pulitzer

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.010
Prize for nonfiction.

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.100
Samantha's second book,
Chasing the Flame,

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.730
Sergio Vieira de Mello and
the Fight to Save the World,

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.420
takes on difficult questions
about the proper role

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.990
of international diplomacy
and the proper conditions

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:47.350
for intervention in a
world where nations' moral

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.890
and strategic objectives
often compete.

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.850
Here, she explores the personal
and professional evolution

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.690
of Sergio Vieira de Mello,
a Brazilian-born diplomat

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.230
who served in the United Nations
for more than three decades

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.520
and who died tragically
in a 2003 suicide bombing

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.100
while acting as
Secretary-General Kofi Annan's

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.710
special representative in Iraq.

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:15.580
Chasing the Flame was also the
basis for an award-winning HBO

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.560
documentary entitled Sergio.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.240
In Samantha's telling,
de Mello began his career

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.960
as someone who would freely
and forcefully denounce

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.840
evil and injustice
wherever he saw it,

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.660
but who then went
on to fully embrace

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.540
not only the necessity
of negotiation,

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.640
but also the United Nations'
powerful inclination towards

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.030
non-judgment.

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.350
He did this to such an extent
that some found him obsequious.

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.100
De Mello even
earned the nickname

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.570
Serbio for his
perceived closeness

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:54.760
to Slobodan Milosevic during the
Balkan War of the early 1990s.

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.660
Eventually, we learn, de
Mello struck a balance

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.260
between the poles of
denouncement and non-judgement

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.350
that Samantha holds up
as a model from which

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.270
our country can learn.

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:09.310
I quote her prescription.

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:14.170
"Be in the room, don't be afraid
of talking to your adversaries,

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.950
but don't bracket what happened
before you entered the room.

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.200
Don't black-box history.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.440
Don't check your
principles at the door."

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.740
I suspect this kind of
principled pragmatism

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.100
combined with humility and what
Samantha has described as--

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.360
and I quote her-- "an emboldened
sense of responsibility"

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.530
has animated much of her
own efforts in recent years

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.310
at the senior-most levels
of US foreign policy making.

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.120
Her policy positions, as
many analysts have noted,

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.200
do not track with any
particular partisan agenda.

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.380
Moreover, Samantha is
well-known as someone

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.640
who presses her case with
both force and clarity.

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:01.180
And I might add here something
that her fellow fellows,

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.480
I think, will agree with, that
we in the Radcliffe community

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:08.170
have had the honor and
pleasure of observing Samantha

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:12.550
in action, as she has
interrogated her fellow fellows

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:15.490
on an impressively
broad range of topics

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.210
with the same
intensity and insight.

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:22.180
Whatever you may think of
the current administration

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.660
or the previous one, it
should be clear to all

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:29.170
that we face new and
often unprecedented

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:33.070
global challenges with
profound strategic and human

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:34.510
implications.

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:38.530
I am thrilled to have someone as
expert, as experienced, and as

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:43.300
wise as Samantha here today to
help us reflect on these issues

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.790
from the inside out,
to use her language,

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:48.430
and to suggest a way forward.

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:53.460
Samantha is the 2017-2018
Perrin Moorhead Grayson

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.890
and Bruns Grayson Fellow here
at the Radcliffe Institute.

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:00.310
And I'm happy to see Penny
Grayson here with us today.

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:03.190
I'm grateful to the Graysons
for their generous support

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:06.460
of the Institute and to Penny
for her advice as a member

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:09.220
of our Deans Advisory Council.

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:11.650
In addition to Samantha's
Radcliffe fellowship

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:15.250
this year, she is on the faculty
of both the Harvard Law School

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.170
and the Harvard Kennedy School.

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:19.340
Before returning to
Harvard last fall,

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:22.160
Samantha was a US permanent
representative to the United

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.940
Nations and a member of
President Barack Obama's

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:27.110
cabinet.

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:29.480
She also served as
special assistant

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:33.860
to the president and senior
director for Multinational--

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.410
Multilateral Affairs
and Human Rights

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:38.960
on the president's
National Security Council,

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.830
where she focused on UN
reform, LGBT and women's

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:46.190
rights, religious freedom,
human trafficking,

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:48.650
and democracy and human rights.

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:51.080
Samantha was the founding
executive director

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:53.990
of the Carr Center for Human
Rights at the Harvard Kennedy

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:54.950
School.

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:58.110
And in addition to her two
books that I mentioned earlier,

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:01.910
she is the co-editor of another
book entitled The Unquiet

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:04.940
American, Richard
Holbrooke in the World,

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:08.900
an examination of the career
and writings of another diplomat

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:11.390
Samantha admired greatly.

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:14.420
Samantha's other writings have
appeared in such publications

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:17.210
as The Atlantic, the New
Republic, The New York Review

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:20.150
of Books, and The New Yorker.

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:22.790
I will just add, before
making a final comment,

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:25.340
that I want to alert
you to the fact

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:28.010
that a film that
features Samantha

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:31.370
and her last year in
the Obama administration

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:35.570
is now out in the world,
available through YouTube

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:37.130
and I'm sure other--

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:39.230
how else?

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:41.640
Lots of different ways, and
the Kendall theater, too.

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:44.360
So you can see it at home
or you can see it in public.

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.790
But we highly recommend it.

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:48.380
Here's how the
afternoon will go.

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:50.330
After Samantha
delivers her lecture,

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:52.760
there'll be time
for a brief Q&amp;A.

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:55.010
We will put a microphone
in the center aisle.

00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:58.790
We invite you to line
up to ask your question.

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:01.790
Please introduce yourself
before you do so.

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:03.980
And after the final
question, I invite

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:08.330
you to join us for a reception
next door at Fay House.

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:11.150
Now, it gives me great
pleasure to welcome

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:12.570
Samantha Power to the podium.

00:08:12.570 --> 00:08:15.030
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:16.506
- Thank you.

00:08:16.506 --> 00:08:17.490
Thank you so much.

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:19.950
Thank you.

00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:20.934
Thank you.

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:27.320
Hello, everybody.

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:29.450
Great to be here.

00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:31.770
And thank you so much,
Liz, for that introduction.

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:36.580
I'd like to start by offering a
fulsome thank you to Radcliffe,

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:40.960
the Radcliffe Institute, to the
Grayson family for having me

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:46.330
here as a fellow along with
such other amazing people

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:50.177
that I've had a chance to
listen to and learn from.

00:08:50.177 --> 00:08:52.510
I was incredibly privileged
to get to serve in the Obama

00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:54.170
administration for eight years.

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:57.460
But one of the
disadvantages of being

00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:00.640
in national security
24/7 is it tends

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.260
to narrow your perspective.

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:05.020
And coming here
and learning about

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:12.970
facial-recognition technology
and pirates and cichlid fish

00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:15.610
reminds me and
affirms for me why

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:18.340
it's so amazing to be on
a campus, and especially

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:19.330
this amazing campus.

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:20.020
So thank you.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.450
It's wonderful to see so
many people here today who

00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:27.158
could be doing a lot
of different things.

00:09:27.158 --> 00:09:28.730
So thank you for coming out.

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:31.750
I have spent my time thus far--

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:34.300
I can't believe it's
slipping away, but trying

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:39.280
to understand the journey
that Liz described,

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:42.910
a journey that took me from
being, initially, a journalist

00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:49.630
and activist and academic into
the messy world of politics,

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:55.990
and specifically into Barack
Obama's Senate office,

00:09:55.990 --> 00:10:02.020
into his presidential campaign,
which I had to leave briefly,

00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:06.400
and finally into the White
House, and most amazingly,

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:10.771
as his ambassador to the United
Nations in his second term.

00:10:10.771 --> 00:10:12.520
In coming here today
and having the chance

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:15.580
to speak at Harvard for the
first time since I've returned

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:17.560
and to do my--

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:19.510
make my Radcliffe
presentation, I

00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:21.130
considered a lot
of different topics

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:24.310
within the broad rubric
of foreign policy

00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:27.400
from the inside out
because I'm exploring

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:30.044
a very broad range of topics.

00:10:30.044 --> 00:10:31.960
The question I get asked
the most about, which

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:33.501
may come up in the
discussion period,

00:10:33.501 --> 00:10:36.190
is the red line in Syria.

00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:39.550
There's a lot to say about
the person currently occupying

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:42.610
the Oval Office and the future
of the liberal international

00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:43.150
order.

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:44.980
I could have gone
in that direction.

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:49.630
But given the broader reckoning
going on in our country

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:52.870
and around the world, I
thought I would actually

00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:55.060
use this occasion
here at Radcliffe,

00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:58.210
of all places, to
reflect on a question

00:10:58.210 --> 00:11:00.730
that I increasingly
get, which is, what

00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:04.690
was it like, as a woman,
doing foreign policy in the US

00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:07.660
government and at the UN?

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:10.720
And I stress, because
I am a professor here,

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:13.960
but this is not an
academic lecture.

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:16.950
It's not my normal
analytic fare.

00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:19.390
It is one person's
personal experiences

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:25.480
from which I try to draw,
also, some lessons regarding

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:28.810
how we go forward in the face
of many of the challenges

00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:34.120
that are being discussed
and aired, but many of which

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:37.990
are not yet being addressed.

00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:40.400
So let me start a little
bit at the beginning.

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:44.110
Before I began working
in the US government,

00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:46.600
I will admit that
I had never been

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:51.020
all that self-conscious about
being a woman in the workplace.

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:53.950
And this is partly
because I was raised

00:11:53.950 --> 00:12:00.280
by a very single-minded Irish
mother, Vera Delaney, who

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:05.590
overcame such severe hurdles and
prejudices herself to do what

00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:09.360
she loved, which was
to practice medicine,

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:12.250
that I compared my
lucky life, which

00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:14.740
was very privileged, certainly,
in comparison to some

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:17.200
of the challenges she faced.

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:17.880
This is her.

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:19.680
This is me and my mother.

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:22.740
[INAUDIBLE] great.

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:24.220
She's really great.

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:28.360
But not long after she
married my father and had me,

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:30.700
my mother became a
doctor, at a time

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:34.120
when married women
made up less than 10%

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:36.070
of the Irish workforce.

00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:39.520
I grew up on stories
of her experiences

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:41.340
in the medical
profession and in the--

00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:43.790
in the world, which
often weren't pretty--

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:47.170
but they never deterred her,
she was full speed ahead--

00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:51.430
like the one when she tried to
acquire custody of my younger

00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:55.360
brother and me so she could
bring us to the United States

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:58.110
in order to be able to deepen
her training as a kidney

00:12:58.110 --> 00:12:59.320
doctor.

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:03.460
And in the courtroom, the
justice mused out loud about

00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:06.100
my mother-- who at that point,
had a PhD in biochemistry

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:07.620
and medical degree--

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:10.810
what right has this
woman to be so educated?

00:13:10.810 --> 00:13:13.125
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:13.125 --> 00:13:14.571
I know.

00:13:14.571 --> 00:13:16.570
But these are the kinds
of stories I grew up on.

00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:19.990
So I thought,
who's got problems?

00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:25.285
My first real job was as a
23-year-old war correspondent

00:13:25.285 --> 00:13:26.960
in the Balkans.

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:31.670
Now, of course, it
was men, mainly,

00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:35.840
who orchestrated and fought
the wars that I was covering.

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:41.120
Interestingly, though, among
the posse of freelancers

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:47.120
and full-time correspondents
who gravitated to the Balkans,

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:50.690
it was women war correspondents
who really, at that time,

00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:53.750
I think, stood out, everyone
from Christiane Amanpour

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:56.540
of CNN, of course, to Maggie
O'Kane of the Guardian, who

00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:59.660
uncovered concentration
camps in northern Bosnia,

00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:03.560
Kate Adie of the BBC, Carol
Williams of the LA Times.

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:06.440
These were amazing
role models for me

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:10.280
and my girlfriends, who
are still my closest

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:14.960
friends, to have at that stage.

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:18.440
And although the culture that
we encountered in the Balkans

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:22.430
was patriarchal in the
extreme, although not compared

00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:24.560
to what some of our
people here I know

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:28.350
have gone through-- but with
very deep-rooted sexism,

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:32.420
writing for the Western
media in Bosnia in the 1990s

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:37.040
was a far cry for women from
what Martha Gellhorn had

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:39.711
gone through to try to cover the
D-Day invasion of World War II.

00:14:39.711 --> 00:14:41.210
Some of you know
the story where she

00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:44.210
had to hide in the
toilet of a hospital ship

00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:46.610
and to sneak ashore
with an ambulance crew

00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:49.430
in order to cover the landing.

00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:52.760
I can't be scientific
about the difference

00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:55.940
that gender made in Bosnia.

00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:59.090
And it is even
conceivable that we

00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:01.490
women correspondents,
of whom there were many,

00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:04.760
actually enjoyed better access
to the people and events we

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:09.080
wished to cover because the
local gunmen so underestimated

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:10.850
us.

00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:14.210
But that said, I also don't know
a single woman colleague who

00:15:14.210 --> 00:15:16.940
wasn't, at one point,
caught off guard

00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:20.180
by a romantic
come-on from a source

00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:26.390
or left stammering her way
out of an unexpected advance.

00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:30.560
I must admit, again, that
I had not reflected much

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:34.010
on the role that gender
played in my career at all,

00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:37.940
really, until
recently, when hundreds

00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:41.900
of brave women, and a few
men, began coming forward

00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:45.230
to share their personal
experiences of harassment,

00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:48.170
predation, assault,
exposing decades

00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:54.470
of toxic and illegal behavior
by people in positions of power.

00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:56.330
Like everything in this stage--

00:15:56.330 --> 00:16:00.500
in this age, I should say,
it has a hashtag, #MeToo.

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:04.130
But unlike so many other issues
that have burst into the news

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:06.500
and then just as
quickly disappeared,

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:10.910
#MeToo has become more
impactful on the national

00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:14.660
and the global conversation
than I think any of us

00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:16.790
could have imagined
when we first

00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:21.590
read about Harvey Weinstein,
for example, last fall.

00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:24.680
These silence breakers,
as Time magazine

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:28.130
called its 2017
person of the year,

00:16:28.130 --> 00:16:31.790
have jumpstarted a
long-overdue reckoning.

00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:34.880
It is reaching across
professions and party lines,

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:39.590
shining a light on the invisible
daily struggles endured

00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:43.280
for too long by our mentors, our
teachers, friends, colleagues,

00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:46.280
neighbors, grandmothers,
mothers, and even

00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:47.990
our own daughters.

00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:51.260
It is no wonder, then, that
this reckoning has also

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:55.400
reached the field of national
security and foreign policy.

00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:59.840
Two months ago, in
November, 223 women

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:02.820
who work in or on US
national security,

00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:05.119
including many close colleagues
of mine from the Obama

00:17:05.119 --> 00:17:07.730
administration,
signed an open letter

00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:11.234
that they titled #MeTooNatSec.

00:17:11.234 --> 00:17:12.650
You don't have to
read the letter.

00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:15.379
I do recommend
looking for it online.

00:17:15.379 --> 00:17:17.420
But that's just to give
you a hint of the letter.

00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:19.970
The letter is addressed to
the entire national security

00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:20.480
community.

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:22.880
And it was quite
measured in tone.

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:26.930
It made no sensational claims
about specific abusers,

00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:31.400
nor did it call out any
particular government agency,

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:33.830
declaring, quote, "We,
too, are survivors

00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:36.080
of sexual harassment,
assault, and abuse

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:38.600
or know others who
are," end quote.

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:40.850
Ambassadors,
professors, diplomats,

00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:44.690
intelligence analysts, military
officers, think-tankers,

00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:47.360
and leading experts from every
part of the foreign policy

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:50.060
community delivered a
stinging assessment.

00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:52.250
And I'll just read you
part of the letter.

00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:54.740
"Many women are
held back or driven

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:56.660
from the national
security field by men

00:17:56.660 --> 00:18:00.110
who use their power to assault
at one end of the spectrum

00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:04.250
and perpetuate, sometimes
unconsciously, environments

00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:08.960
that silence, demean, belittle,
or neglect women at the other.

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:11.900
Assault is the progression
of the same behaviors

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:14.900
that permit us to be denigrated,
interrupted, shut out--

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:15.400
[COUGH]

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:17.690
--excuse me, shut
out, and shut up.

00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:20.210
These behaviors incubate
a permissive environment

00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:23.340
where sexual harassment
and assault take hold."

00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:25.670
So that's just a
part of the letter.

00:18:25.670 --> 00:18:29.240
So this letter only received
fleeting media coverage,

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:33.590
but it did generate significant
attention in the foreign policy

00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:34.460
world.

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:38.030
And among those reacting were
the 10 Democrats on the Senate

00:18:38.030 --> 00:18:40.250
Foreign Relations
Committee who forwarded

00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:42.500
this letter to
Secretary of State Rex

00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:45.830
Tillerson with a warning that a
failure to remedy the problems

00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:48.380
it described would have
what the senators called

00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:52.790
a deep and negative affect
on US national security.

00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:55.106
Well beyond the letter,
in recent months--

00:18:55.106 --> 00:18:56.480
again, a little
beneath the radar

00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:59.540
compared to some of what's
in the press each day--

00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:01.610
women in national
security have come forward

00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:05.570
to share their experiences
of indignities and abuses,

00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:10.880
large and small, themselves
overcoming or combating,

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:14.060
overriding the longstanding
concern that speaking out

00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:17.180
would torpedo their careers.

00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:20.390
I'll offer just
two stark examples.

00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:24.410
One widely-shared frustration
is the demeaning, often flippant

00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:27.830
attitude men in the
national security realm

00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:30.260
have expressed toward the
professional advancement

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:32.930
or achievement of their
female colleagues.

00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:36.230
Heather Hurlburt, who
is a former speechwriter

00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:38.990
in the White House and
the State Department,

00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:42.620
recalled being hired
for her dream job,

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:44.960
only to be told by
her boss, quote,

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:48.950
"We held this job open for
a woman, so I hired you

00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:53.710
and dated the other
finalist," end quote.

00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:55.310
Not ideal.

00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:58.640
Others have spoken to
the dangerous culture

00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:01.310
of entitlement and
impunity that prevails

00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:05.150
in a profession that entails,
often, long foreign trips

00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:07.490
and long hours.

00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:10.010
Rosa Brooks-- some of you may
have seen this-- a defense

00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:12.290
official in the
Obama administration,

00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:15.710
described a harrowing experience
from earlier in her career

00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:18.990
with a senior foreign service
Officer who, as she put it,

00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:21.170
quote, "grabbed me and
shoved his tongue forcibly

00:20:21.170 --> 00:20:23.330
down my throat as we walked
along a deserted canal

00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:26.600
in Venice, returning from an
international law conference.

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:28.940
It took several minutes of
skirmishing and several firm

00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:31.100
threats to shove
him into the canal

00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:35.330
before he stopped pawing
at me," end quote.

00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:38.439
Now, this problem is
obviously widespread well

00:20:38.439 --> 00:20:40.730
beyond the national security
community, as we all know,

00:20:40.730 --> 00:20:43.220
and certainly well
beyond the United States.

00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:45.530
Just last week, in
fact, the Guardian

00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:48.740
published a devastating
expose describing

00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:51.800
pervasive sexual harassment,
assault, and retaliation

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:56.090
across the UN, often
perpetrated by senior officials.

00:20:56.090 --> 00:20:59.750
A former investigator for the
UN's internal affairs division

00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:03.320
told the paper that he
routinely witnessed cover-ups

00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:05.840
and that impunity for
offenders was the norm.

00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:07.940
As he put it, "the
only rule is not

00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:10.810
to publicly embarrass
the Organization,"

00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:13.700
capital "O," Organization.

00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:16.280
Taking stock of the
many experiences shared

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:19.190
by female national
security professionals,

00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:21.650
the political
scientist, Dan Drezner,

00:21:21.650 --> 00:21:24.680
described women in
this field as facing

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:27.740
what he called a
gender tax, something

00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:32.000
that our male counterparts
don't shoulder.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.310
Speaking more
personally, I think

00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:37.670
it is fair to say that the first
time I began to focus on what

00:21:37.670 --> 00:21:39.320
it meant to be a
woman in the workplace

00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:42.440
was when I started to
work in Washington.

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:43.730
And let me be clear.

00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:45.680
On that score and
on many others,

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:48.230
I feel extremely
fortunate to have worked

00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:53.076
for President Obama, the son
of a trailblazing mother,

00:21:53.076 --> 00:21:54.950
the husband of a woman
who was once his boss,

00:21:54.950 --> 00:22:00.456
and the dedicated father of two
daughters who has said proudly,

00:22:00.456 --> 00:22:02.330
"It's important that
their dad is a feminist,

00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:06.410
because now that's what
they expect of men."

00:22:06.410 --> 00:22:08.900
In his eight years as
president-- you miss him,

00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:09.800
don't you?

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:12.680
I know, sorry--

00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:15.860
Obama appointed the
highest number of women

00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:18.770
to cabinet-level
positions in US history.

00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:21.140
And I must say-- and
this mattered to me

00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:23.180
a lot-- he always
gave the impression

00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:26.360
that he wasn't scurrying
around with women in binders

00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:28.950
or whatever it was
that we heard about,

00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:31.900
that someone had to make
this huge effort in order

00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:33.170
to find talented women.

00:22:33.170 --> 00:22:35.120
He projected the
sense that he was

00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:38.570
hiring the people who were
the best for the job, who

00:22:38.570 --> 00:22:40.070
happened to be women.

00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:44.690
Nonetheless, in 2009, while
women ran key government

00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:47.540
agencies, at the
White House itself,

00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:50.160
where I would work
for four years,

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:52.970
men held 2/3 of the top jobs.

00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:54.450
And this wasn't
a new phenomenon.

00:22:54.450 --> 00:22:57.500
It was not until the Eisenhower
administration in 1953

00:22:57.500 --> 00:22:59.600
that women began to
work in the West Wing

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:01.520
as more than secretaries.

00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:04.310
The culture at the White
House bore similarities

00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:07.520
to office dynamics across
this great country,

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:10.160
lots of sports metaphors
and sports outings

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:14.660
to play basketball or golf,
ample "dude" references,

00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:17.660
and lots and lots of swearing.

00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:19.490
I was fortunate to
play basketball.

00:23:19.490 --> 00:23:21.530
So I had opportunities
to do business

00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:26.030
with senior officials outside
of our long hours in the office.

00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:29.120
I won't speak to
the swearing part.

00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:32.570
The most vivid occasion
on which gender

00:23:32.570 --> 00:23:36.260
dynamics at the White
House surfaced publicly

00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:39.680
came in December 2012
during negotiations

00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:43.100
over the so-called fiscal cliff
when the White House released

00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:48.980
a photo of President Obama
seated in the Oval Office

00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:51.440
with his back to the
camera, giving direction

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:58.220
to his political, economics, and
communications teams, as such.

00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:00.800
When critics pounced
on this photo-- someone

00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:01.675
released this photo.

00:24:01.675 --> 00:24:03.800
Someone very senior would
have released this photo,

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:05.180
not thinking that
there was anything

00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:06.170
weird about this photo.

00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:07.640
So we start with that.

00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:10.760
So when critics saw the
photo, the White House

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:13.550
pointed out something
even worse than releasing

00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:14.459
the photo itself.

00:24:14.459 --> 00:24:15.500
Some of you may remember.

00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:21.270
Does anybody remember that,
in fact, if you look closely,

00:24:21.270 --> 00:24:24.320
you will see, behind Dan
Pfeiffer in his brown corduroys

00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:27.515
and blue shirt,
Valerie Jarrett's leg.

00:24:27.515 --> 00:24:30.632
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:34.370
She was there all along.

00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:36.050
And literally, you
had statements,

00:24:36.050 --> 00:24:39.184
people on and off the record,
coming out saying, oh, no, it's

00:24:39.184 --> 00:24:39.684
fine.

00:24:39.684 --> 00:24:41.570
Look, there's her knee.

00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:43.560
You could just see in the--

00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:46.820
Anyway, so you can imagine
the reaction to this.

00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:50.120
Jodi Kantor of the New York
Times tweeted "Jarrett's leg

00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:52.880
as metaphor."

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:55.307
Now, President Obama,
the enlightened guy

00:24:55.307 --> 00:24:57.890
that he is, of course, invited
senior women on the White House

00:24:57.890 --> 00:25:00.440
staff to his office or
he had dinners with them

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:03.110
so that they could vent,
share frustrations,

00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:06.747
get a sense of what could
be done differently.

00:25:06.747 --> 00:25:10.250
And I think that
more self-awareness

00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:13.124
and deliberateness meant that
women were called on more

00:25:13.124 --> 00:25:15.290
often-- and sometimes even
when they weren't raising

00:25:15.290 --> 00:25:17.600
their hands, which happens
not only at Harvard campus,

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:20.030
but within the White
House as well--

00:25:20.030 --> 00:25:23.420
and also affirming the
work of his women advisors.

00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:27.380
But I think, as we all
know, numbers matter.

00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:30.230
And it was significant
that in the second term,

00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:34.040
President Obama and his very
activist chief of staff, Denis

00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:36.470
McDonough, went out
of their way to try

00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:39.890
to ensure that women occupied
an equal share of the top White

00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:41.540
House staff jobs.

00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:44.180
And in fact, in
2015, the White House

00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:48.530
released a not-so-subtle photo
of the president conferring

00:25:48.530 --> 00:25:50.116
with his advisors.

00:25:50.116 --> 00:25:53.740
[INAUDIBLE], yes.

00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:56.570
And Obama's
photographer, Pete Souza,

00:25:56.570 --> 00:25:59.240
later commented, "This
is a full-frame picture.

00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:03.381
I guess you'd say I was
trying to make a point."

00:26:03.381 --> 00:26:04.880
So at the National
Security Council,

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:07.255
which is where I worked-- it
was part of the White House,

00:26:07.255 --> 00:26:09.140
but its own world--

00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:11.990
in the early years of
the Obama administration,

00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:14.935
men held all the top jobs,
national security advisor,

00:26:14.935 --> 00:26:17.060
deputy national security
advisor, homeland security

00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:20.690
advisor, chief of staff,
strategic communications

00:26:20.690 --> 00:26:23.820
advisor, and speechwriter.

00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:28.250
The senior staff were known
as-- are known, I think,

00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:30.370
maybe that's one thing
that's still intact--

00:26:30.370 --> 00:26:32.750
are still known, perhaps,
as senior directors,

00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:34.550
NSC senior directors.

00:26:34.550 --> 00:26:38.600
And my first year, I was
one of six women who were

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:40.790
senior directors out of 26.

00:26:40.790 --> 00:26:42.860
That gives you some
sense of the ratio.

00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:46.310
One Wednesday toward the
end of our first year, one

00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:48.615
of my senior women
colleagues-- it

00:26:48.615 --> 00:26:50.510
was a fellow senior
director-- invited

00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:52.910
me and a few other women
to come to her office

00:26:52.910 --> 00:26:54.870
for a glass of wine.

00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:58.850
This quick break turned
into a 90-minute release.

00:26:58.850 --> 00:27:00.920
And after a half an hour
together, each of us

00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:04.520
called back to our assistance
to ask apologetically

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:06.530
if they could move our
next appointments owing

00:27:06.530 --> 00:27:10.160
to urgent national
security business.

00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:14.960
We discussed not only our
experience of work at the NSC

00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:17.780
and some of our
frustrations, but also

00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:20.420
what we were working on,
what we were proud of,

00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:22.700
what we hoped to achieve.

00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:25.400
This first pretty
spontaneous invitation

00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:28.940
turned into a sacred
weekly Wednesday group.

00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:31.490
Those of us with kids
talked about the chaos

00:27:31.490 --> 00:27:32.420
of our juggling.

00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:36.230
The single women among us talked
about their latest crushes.

00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:40.070
Each of us gave each other
a quality of attention

00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:43.640
that was too often lacking
in the transactional world

00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:45.020
of Washington.

00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:46.640
And outside of
these gatherings, I

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:49.190
think a change
crept into the way

00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:53.390
that we acted in our
larger policy discussions.

00:27:53.390 --> 00:27:57.200
Without ever discussing it or
making any conscious shift--

00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:59.810
at least that I'm aware of--
we reflexively supported

00:27:59.810 --> 00:28:01.460
one another in meetings.

00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:04.130
Now, this didn't mean we
agreed with one another.

00:28:04.130 --> 00:28:08.600
Some of my most spirited
arguments at the NSC

00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:11.210
were with my fellow
women senior directors.

00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:13.490
We were not always on the
same page, by any means.

00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:17.330
But we engaged one another's
arguments, not simply leaving

00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:21.290
them hanging in the air, which
happened too often in larger

00:28:21.290 --> 00:28:22.914
group discussions.

00:28:22.914 --> 00:28:24.830
As we compared notes
during what became known,

00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:27.110
again, as this--
the Wednesday group,

00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:30.560
I was struck both by how
self-conscious my colleagues

00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:34.010
were as women role
models to younger women

00:28:34.010 --> 00:28:36.530
and by the lengths
to which these women,

00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:39.680
the senior directors,
went to seek out and hire

00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:43.220
young women to work directly
under them as directors.

00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:46.340
And I just have to stress
how challenging this

00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:49.215
is to do in the world of foreign
policy and national security.

00:28:49.215 --> 00:28:53.540
You really have to
fight gravity in order

00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:58.110
to have the kind of equality
of representation that we seek.

00:28:58.110 --> 00:28:59.960
And why is that?

00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:01.910
The pipeline, the
so-called pipeline

00:29:01.910 --> 00:29:06.020
of women eligible to go into
senior foreign policy positions

00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:09.200
in government is very skewed.

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:13.160
In academia, a key feeder to
these top national security

00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:15.980
jobs, the ratio of men
to women professors

00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:19.490
who focus on US foreign policy
back when I was in the Obama--

00:29:19.490 --> 00:29:22.010
starting in the Obama
administration was 3 to 1.

00:29:22.010 --> 00:29:24.320
Of the top 10
American think tanks

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:27.020
concentrating on
international affairs,

00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:30.460
just one was then
run by a woman.

00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:33.560
When CNN, Fox, and MSNBC--

00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:36.340
so the range-- had
foreign policy segments,

00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:41.520
they chose male commentators
a remarkable 80% of the time.

00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:45.000
And so even though in recent
memory Madeleine Albright,

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.400
Condoleezza Rice,
Hillary Clinton

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:49.680
have run the State
Department, we

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:52.380
can't forget that
until 1971, women

00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:54.060
Foreign Service
Officers at State

00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:57.150
had to retire if
they got married.

00:29:57.150 --> 00:30:01.080
And only 9% of US ambassadors
have been women since

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:03.660
the country's-- since
our country's founding.

00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:07.120
More often than not-- and
this remains true today--

00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:09.300
the women ambassadors
are posted to countries

00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:13.350
considered less central
to US national security.

00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:15.180
No woman has yet
served as ambassador--

00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:19.060
US ambassador to China,
to Russia, Israel, Turkey,

00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:20.760
or Afghanistan.

00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:24.090
And I think it's fair to say
the same basic story applies

00:30:24.090 --> 00:30:28.320
across government agencies, like
CIA and the Defense Department.

00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:31.230
I came to understand that
hiring men and women in roughly

00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:34.200
equal numbers at the
NSC really required

00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:37.650
pushing water uphill, slowing
down the hiring process at just

00:30:37.650 --> 00:30:39.120
the time that,
given the workload,

00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:41.220
you were inclined
to speed it up,

00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:43.140
and proactively
reaching out to women

00:30:43.140 --> 00:30:45.990
to urge them to throw
their hats in the ring,

00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:49.200
or trying to appeal to
them and to overcome

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:53.160
the doubts that they have about
even taking jobs of this nature

00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:56.490
given some of the reputational
issues that also existed.

00:30:56.490 --> 00:30:59.280
Jim Clapper, President
Obama's Director

00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:01.980
of National Intelligence,
made the case

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:05.580
for more proactive
hiring this way.

00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:09.250
He said, "Over my 53-plus years
in the intelligence business--"

00:31:09.250 --> 00:31:10.710
that's a lot of years--

00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:12.930
"I've watched women rise
to leadership positions

00:31:12.930 --> 00:31:14.430
all around me.

00:31:14.430 --> 00:31:16.350
And having women
in leadership roles

00:31:16.350 --> 00:31:19.440
is more critical than people
on the outside would think.

00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:22.290
We have found that with almost
all the major intelligence

00:31:22.290 --> 00:31:27.060
failures we've had, diversity
of thought might have saved us,"

00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:28.260
end quote.

00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:31.290
And speaking about the equally
troubling absence of people

00:31:31.290 --> 00:31:33.210
of color in the field
of national security

00:31:33.210 --> 00:31:35.520
or foreign policy, President
Obama's National Security

00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:37.260
Advisor, Susan Rice,
put it perfectly.

00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:39.300
"Our national security
agencies have not yet

00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:43.320
drawn fully on the strengths
of our great nation.

00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:46.050
In the halls of power, in the
faces of our national security

00:31:46.050 --> 00:31:50.760
leaders, America is still
not fully reflected."

00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:52.270
And that was before
the cabinet came

00:31:52.270 --> 00:31:55.540
to look like founding fathers.

00:31:55.540 --> 00:32:02.830
So fortunately for me, even
though there were far more men

00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:06.730
than women at the NSC,
as I've indicated,

00:32:06.730 --> 00:32:09.080
I rarely found myself the
only woman in the room.

00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:10.510
And there were all--
again, all these ways

00:32:10.510 --> 00:32:12.885
in which I think we found a
way to reinforce one another.

00:32:12.885 --> 00:32:17.600
And the culture did evolve,
importantly, over time.

00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:21.320
Things were very different when
I got to the United Nations,

00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:24.300
when I became President Obama's
second ambassador to the United

00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:27.080
Nations, where you
really often were

00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:29.800
the only woman in the room.

00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:32.990
So since World War II
when the UN was created,

00:32:32.990 --> 00:32:35.175
enshrining within
its founding charter

00:32:35.175 --> 00:32:36.800
the critical importance
of human rights

00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:39.140
and fundamental
freedoms, there has never

00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:41.780
been a woman Secretary-General.

00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:44.000
And the percentage of women
ambassadors representing

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.416
the various member
states, which--

00:32:45.416 --> 00:32:48.050
and this would just reflect the
dynamics within the countries

00:32:48.050 --> 00:32:49.460
that comprise the UN--

00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:51.770
has never exceeded 25%.

00:32:51.770 --> 00:32:54.050
Now, I was really lucky,
because I didn't represent

00:32:54.050 --> 00:32:55.250
any old country at the UN.

00:32:55.250 --> 00:32:57.770
I represented the United
States, the country

00:32:57.770 --> 00:33:00.190
that hosts the UN on its soil.

00:33:00.190 --> 00:33:03.320
We are the largest
financial donor to the UN

00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:05.040
by leaps and bounds.

00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:06.020
We have the veto.

00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:08.570
One of five countries
at the UN have the veto.

00:33:08.570 --> 00:33:11.630
We bring our policy
initiatives there.

00:33:11.630 --> 00:33:13.220
As a result, I think
it's fair to say

00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:18.830
that over my time at the UN,
the salience of my Americanness

00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:24.080
was more relevant or
evident to other countries

00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:26.390
than me being a woman was.

00:33:26.390 --> 00:33:31.490
And so I think I suffered very
few of the kinds of slights

00:33:31.490 --> 00:33:33.620
that I know from my
colleagues, women colleagues,

00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:35.150
that they suffered.

00:33:35.150 --> 00:33:38.990
Madeleine Albright
liked to joke, quote,

00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:42.290
"It used to be that the
only way a woman could truly

00:33:42.290 --> 00:33:45.350
make her foreign policy views
felt was by marrying a diplomat

00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:51.020
and then pouring tea on an
offending ambassador's lap."

00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:54.230
By the time I assumed
my position in 2013,

00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:58.980
a trio of amazingly strong
women had served at the UN,

00:33:58.980 --> 00:34:02.360
representing the United States
before me, Jeane Kirkpatrick,

00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:07.292
1981 to 1985, Albright herself,
'93 to '97 before she became

00:34:07.292 --> 00:34:08.750
our first woman
secretary of state,

00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:12.620
and Ambassador
Rice, 2009 to 2013.

00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:16.070
So when I got to New York,
I read the biographies

00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:18.199
by Jeane Kirkpatrick and
about Jeane Kirkpatrick

00:34:18.199 --> 00:34:21.560
and by Secretary
Albright herself.

00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:24.980
And I think when you read
biographies of women who've

00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:27.679
served in prior
generations, you really

00:34:27.679 --> 00:34:30.290
see how much has
changed for the better.

00:34:30.290 --> 00:34:34.070
And I'm just going to give you
a flavor of that here today.

00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:37.550
Jeane Kirkpatrick, raised
in a small town in Oklahoma,

00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:40.159
ducked out of an early
stint in government

00:34:40.159 --> 00:34:43.550
to raise her three sons
while she was competing

00:34:43.550 --> 00:34:45.690
her doctorate at Columbia.

00:34:45.690 --> 00:34:48.800
She was discovered in 1979--
that's the year I came to this

00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:50.810
country from Ireland--

00:34:50.810 --> 00:34:54.050
after Dick Allen, Ronald
Reagan's foreign policy advisor

00:34:54.050 --> 00:34:58.400
in the presidential campaign,
gave Reagan an essay

00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:00.260
that she had written
in commentary, which

00:35:00.260 --> 00:35:01.718
you all probably
are familiar with,

00:35:01.718 --> 00:35:04.580
called "Dictatorships
and Double Standards."

00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:06.680
Reagan, who had just
announced that he was running

00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:10.490
for president, read the essay
on a flight from Washington

00:35:10.490 --> 00:35:13.370
to Los Angeles and called
Allen very excitedly

00:35:13.370 --> 00:35:15.050
when he got home.

00:35:15.050 --> 00:35:17.990
"What you gave me to read was
extraordinary," Reagan said.

00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:21.500
"Who is this guy,
Jeane Kirkpatrick?"

00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:24.680
Kirkpatrick was almost
always the only woman

00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:27.980
in the room at the
UN and in Washington.

00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:30.560
During her four years
in New York at the UN,

00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:34.100
she was one of just three
women ambassadors out

00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:39.480
of the then 157 UN member
states, three out of 157.

00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:42.600
She served with also a woman
ambassador from Liberia

00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:44.116
and from the Seychelles.

00:35:44.116 --> 00:35:46.490
The Soviet Union, just to give
you an indicator, has had,

00:35:46.490 --> 00:35:50.600
actually, 11 ambassadors
in their mission.

00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:52.010
The United States has five.

00:35:52.010 --> 00:35:55.790
Soviet Union had
11, none a woman.

00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:59.390
She later recalled how
people interacted with her

00:35:59.390 --> 00:36:00.860
or treated her.

00:36:00.860 --> 00:36:02.930
She said, quote,
"it rocked them.

00:36:02.930 --> 00:36:06.040
I think they just regarded
me as a very odd creature,"

00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:07.460
end quote.

00:36:07.460 --> 00:36:10.340
Now, the Washington glass
ceiling she shattered

00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:13.250
is, in many ways, just
as important, if not more

00:36:13.250 --> 00:36:14.240
important.

00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:15.980
She was the first
woman in history

00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:20.360
to have a seat at the table
in the high-level debates.

00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:22.700
Now we'd call it the
Principals Committee.

00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:24.309
Then they had
another name for it.

00:36:24.309 --> 00:36:25.850
But basically, your
national security

00:36:25.850 --> 00:36:28.580
cabinet, first woman ever.

00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:31.070
Again, I was new to the
United States, an immigrant

00:36:31.070 --> 00:36:33.470
with my mother and
my younger brother.

00:36:33.470 --> 00:36:37.580
But a photo that really stuck in
my mind from when I was a kid--

00:36:37.580 --> 00:36:40.700
I know, it's amazing--

00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:43.910
was this one, and
seeing Kirkpatrick there

00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:48.190
among the suits at the
center of the shot.

00:36:48.190 --> 00:36:56.420
Now, soon after-- soon after
she was chosen UN ambassador,

00:36:56.420 --> 00:37:01.220
a friend of hers reported that
Secretary of State Alexander

00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:05.884
Haig had reacted to the news of
her appointment by exclaiming,

00:37:05.884 --> 00:37:07.550
"I don't know how
anybody expects that I

00:37:07.550 --> 00:37:08.680
will work with that bitch."

00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:15.560
Secretary Haig, who famously
craved the diplomatic limelight

00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:20.370
himself, accused Kirkpatrick
of being temperamental--

00:37:20.370 --> 00:37:22.850
sound familiar?--
mentally and emotionally

00:37:22.850 --> 00:37:26.570
incapable of thinking clearly,
especially during the Falklands

00:37:26.570 --> 00:37:30.080
Crisis, when their
relationship came to a head.

00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:33.080
Even those who
respected Kirkpatrick--

00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:35.987
of whom there were many at the
time-- treated her differently,

00:37:35.987 --> 00:37:37.070
I think, it's fair to say.

00:37:37.070 --> 00:37:41.480
In the spring of 1983, Chief
of Staff Mike Deaver told her,

00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:44.000
"Everyone notices
you have influence

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.060
with President Reagan."

00:37:46.060 --> 00:37:48.820
When Kirkpatrick shrugged,
Deaver went on, "No, no, no.

00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:50.020
Everyone notices.

00:37:50.020 --> 00:37:51.670
He always listens
when you speak.

00:37:51.670 --> 00:37:53.980
He looks at you and
his eyes light up.

00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:56.470
Maybe it's because
you're a woman."

00:37:56.470 --> 00:37:58.120
Kirkpatrick shot
back, "Maybe it's

00:37:58.120 --> 00:38:01.870
because he's interested
in foreign policy."

00:38:01.870 --> 00:38:03.970
President Clinton appointed
Madeleine Albright

00:38:03.970 --> 00:38:06.320
to the UN ambassadorship
less than a decade later.

00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:08.680
By this time, she was
not the sole woman

00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:11.530
in the traditional
cabinet photo.

00:38:11.530 --> 00:38:14.830
For Albright, also,
sitting behind the placard

00:38:14.830 --> 00:38:17.380
in New York that said
United States of America

00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:19.330
had special resonance.

00:38:19.330 --> 00:38:23.120
She was a Czech
immigrant, but a refugee.

00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:26.770
Her refugee family had
come to this country.

00:38:26.770 --> 00:38:29.530
And she remains, to
this day, incredibly

00:38:29.530 --> 00:38:31.360
grateful to this country
for welcoming her

00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:33.310
in and very
outspoken about, now,

00:38:33.310 --> 00:38:37.540
the curbs on incoming
refugee flow.

00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:40.300
Albright married young,
three days after her college

00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:44.560
graduation, and took
the long road, 13 years,

00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:47.110
to completing her
doctorate at Georgetown

00:38:47.110 --> 00:38:49.180
while she raised
her three daughters.

00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:50.770
She was frustrated
that the skills

00:38:50.770 --> 00:38:52.960
she was honing as a
multi-tasking mother

00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:55.780
carried little weight in
the professional world.

00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:58.270
As she would later put
it, "Senior vice president

00:38:58.270 --> 00:39:01.180
for communications sounds
so much more important than

00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:05.650
'put out school newsletter.'"
Albright did not hold

00:39:05.650 --> 00:39:09.340
a full-time job until
she was 39 years old.

00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:11.515
When I was nominated
to become UN ambassador

00:39:11.515 --> 00:39:13.810
and I went to see
Secretary Albright,

00:39:13.810 --> 00:39:16.090
she told me that when
she had been at the UN,

00:39:16.090 --> 00:39:20.740
she had convened a group
for women ambassadors.

00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:22.550
And then, when she was there--

00:39:22.550 --> 00:39:24.640
again, there were more
countries in the world

00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:26.556
as well than when
Kirkpatrick had been there--

00:39:26.556 --> 00:39:28.180
there were 183 countries.

00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:29.680
And only seven of
those countries

00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:31.580
were represented by women.

00:39:31.580 --> 00:39:35.670
So Albright branded
her group the G7.

00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:38.230
Not the group of seven,
the girls' seven.

00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:39.670
And they traded gossip.

00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:41.410
They shared family experiences.

00:39:41.410 --> 00:39:43.510
And they really, I
think importantly,

00:39:43.510 --> 00:39:47.500
became a cross-regional lobby
on behalf of women's issues,

00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:49.810
even managing to
get two women judges

00:39:49.810 --> 00:39:53.530
onto the bench of the new UN war
crimes tribunal, which was just

00:39:53.530 --> 00:39:54.790
being set up.

00:39:54.790 --> 00:39:57.610
Now, I had way more female
company when I got to New York

00:39:57.610 --> 00:39:58.165
in 2013.

00:39:58.165 --> 00:40:02.620
I was the one of 37 women
permanent representatives out

00:40:02.620 --> 00:40:06.880
of 193 countries, again,
more countries than in '93.

00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:09.826
But that's still
just 20% overall,

00:40:09.826 --> 00:40:11.200
which is quite
similar, actually,

00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:13.970
to our own Congress, the ratio.

00:40:13.970 --> 00:40:16.300
And again, the UN tends to
be reflective of how things

00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:18.920
are within national systems.

00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:21.790
Now, on the most
powerful UN body,

00:40:21.790 --> 00:40:24.700
which is the 15-member
UN Security Council,

00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:29.440
I had the chance in 2014 to
serve with four other women.

00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:31.180
There were five of us--

00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:33.550
the United States, Nigeria,
Luxembourg, Jordan,

00:40:33.550 --> 00:40:34.750
and Lithuania.

00:40:34.750 --> 00:40:36.850
We were the largest
female contingent

00:40:36.850 --> 00:40:41.656
on the council in the
seven-decade history of the UN.

00:40:41.656 --> 00:40:44.292
And though we only
accounted-- we didn't all

00:40:44.292 --> 00:40:45.250
sit together, actually.

00:40:45.250 --> 00:40:46.900
This was a panel.

00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:49.550
But maybe we should have.

00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:52.750
Though we only accounted for
a third of the membership

00:40:52.750 --> 00:40:55.611
on the premiere UN body
responsible for making

00:40:55.611 --> 00:40:57.610
international law, deciding
on the use of force,

00:40:57.610 --> 00:41:01.690
sanctions, et cetera, the
excitement around the UN

00:41:01.690 --> 00:41:04.900
was palpable in this period
where we had the chance

00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:06.190
to serve together.

00:41:06.190 --> 00:41:09.160
Young women would pull
me aside in the restroom,

00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:12.100
in the ladies restroom,
to say how proud they

00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:17.020
were to see five women
duking it out in the usually

00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:19.780
male Security Council chamber.

00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:23.860
And the longer I served, though,
also apart from how it looked

00:41:23.860 --> 00:41:26.890
and the signal that that sent,
which I'll come back to--

00:41:26.890 --> 00:41:30.310
the longer I served,
the more evidence I

00:41:30.310 --> 00:41:34.480
saw of the functional value,
as well, of this gender parity.

00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:36.910
Having more women
on the council,

00:41:36.910 --> 00:41:41.260
just simply put, changed the
nature of our deliberations.

00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:43.440
We weren't perfect at
listening to one another,

00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:46.690
but I think it's fair to say we
listened to one another more.

00:41:46.690 --> 00:41:48.910
With more women
colleagues on the council,

00:41:48.910 --> 00:41:52.159
we also talked more, as it
happened, about sexual violence

00:41:52.159 --> 00:41:53.950
and about the importance
of including women

00:41:53.950 --> 00:41:58.770
in peace processes, from which
they are so often shut out.

00:41:58.770 --> 00:42:00.460
Nonetheless, even
with us there--

00:42:00.460 --> 00:42:03.490
and we were a formidable group.

00:42:03.490 --> 00:42:06.820
I mean, the character of
the individuals involved

00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:11.800
were very, very
strong in each case.

00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:13.870
Just even having that
presence didn't, of course,

00:42:13.870 --> 00:42:16.000
stop our some of
our male colleagues

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:21.490
from saying completely crazy
things behind closed doors.

00:42:21.490 --> 00:42:24.610
On several occasions,
male ambassadors

00:42:24.610 --> 00:42:27.490
questioned whether
well-documented cases

00:42:27.490 --> 00:42:31.510
of rape as an atrocity
in war had occurred.

00:42:31.510 --> 00:42:34.070
And I'll just quote
you from one of them.

00:42:34.070 --> 00:42:35.650
"Why would the
soldiers have done

00:42:35.650 --> 00:42:38.260
this when they have their
wives to come home to?"

00:42:38.260 --> 00:42:40.330
one of my African
colleagues asked.

00:42:40.330 --> 00:42:41.680
"Where's the proof?

00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:44.170
If these rapes really
happened, any woman victim

00:42:44.170 --> 00:42:45.530
would want to talk about it.

00:42:45.530 --> 00:42:50.050
They wouldn't care if
security forces were present."

00:42:50.050 --> 00:42:51.910
So I asked-- this is
the advantage, again,

00:42:51.910 --> 00:42:55.120
of at least being in the
room where it happens.

00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:58.210
I asked, oh, are
you speaking from

00:42:58.210 --> 00:43:00.944
your vast personal experience
of having been raped

00:43:00.944 --> 00:43:02.360
and then being
asked what happened

00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:06.010
while security forces affiliated
with your rapist leered

00:43:06.010 --> 00:43:07.030
over you?

00:43:07.030 --> 00:43:11.030
Is that how you are an
authority on this matter?

00:43:11.030 --> 00:43:13.360
The Russian
ambassador, memorably--

00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:16.660
it's become the stuff of
legend in the small circle that

00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:21.100
is New York, but criticized the
UN's Yemen envoy for spending

00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:25.420
too much of his precious time
on the ground talking to women.

00:43:25.420 --> 00:43:28.870
"Your job is to make peace and
that is a hard enough job,"

00:43:28.870 --> 00:43:30.044
the Russian ambassador said.

00:43:30.044 --> 00:43:31.960
"Why are you wasting
your time having meetings

00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:35.550
with women who aren't even
involved in the conflict?"

00:43:35.550 --> 00:43:37.997
That's an important point.

00:43:37.997 --> 00:43:40.330
So let's spend all our time
with the men who are fueling

00:43:40.330 --> 00:43:43.050
the conflict and won't stop.

00:43:43.050 --> 00:43:46.010
In each of these
instances and many others,

00:43:46.010 --> 00:43:48.670
the heads of the women
ambassadors present and some

00:43:48.670 --> 00:43:51.130
of the male
ambassadors, of course,

00:43:51.130 --> 00:43:53.020
as well would snap to attention.

00:43:53.020 --> 00:43:54.670
And each of us would
fling our hand up

00:43:54.670 --> 00:43:58.180
in the air to seek the floor to
challenge what had been said.

00:43:58.180 --> 00:44:02.140
Unfortunately, in 2016, the
number of women ambassadors

00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:05.350
dwindled back down
to 1 out of 15.

00:44:05.350 --> 00:44:06.200
There she is.

00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:08.260
That's me.

00:44:08.260 --> 00:44:11.830
And it remained that way
until just a few weeks ago

00:44:11.830 --> 00:44:15.250
when Karen Pierce became
the first woman in history

00:44:15.250 --> 00:44:18.430
to represent the United
Kingdom at the United Nations,

00:44:18.430 --> 00:44:21.610
joining now Ambassador
Nikki Haley.

00:44:21.610 --> 00:44:24.760
In my years in government,
as I alluded to earlier,

00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:28.510
I developed a heightened
appreciation for symbols.

00:44:28.510 --> 00:44:31.930
And one of the most moving
photographs taken during

00:44:31.930 --> 00:44:36.850
the Obama presidency was this
one of Jacob Philadelphia--

00:44:36.850 --> 00:44:38.600
this was 2009--

00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:42.220
just tentatively reaching up
to just-- to feel, to see,

00:44:42.220 --> 00:44:44.830
to be sure, could it
really be the case

00:44:44.830 --> 00:44:46.780
that this African-American
man with hair just

00:44:46.780 --> 00:44:48.300
like this little
boy's was, in fact,

00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:50.020
President of the United States?

00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:54.540
So what we see matters
hugely, changes

00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:57.140
our sense of what's possible.

00:44:57.140 --> 00:45:00.880
And when I would sit in the open
chamber of the Security Council

00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:02.950
as the only woman
permanent representative,

00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:05.410
I would often see
the school tour

00:45:05.410 --> 00:45:08.680
groups that would come
into the UN in New York.

00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:11.230
And they're escorted
into the viewing gallery.

00:45:11.230 --> 00:45:12.100
They sit there.

00:45:12.100 --> 00:45:16.210
They watch 10, 15
minutes of the debate.

00:45:16.210 --> 00:45:18.310
And I just found
myself wondering,

00:45:18.310 --> 00:45:21.430
what must these children think?

00:45:21.430 --> 00:45:25.180
They look down at this famous
horseshoe where world history

00:45:25.180 --> 00:45:27.760
has sometimes been made.

00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:32.440
And is the ambition of these
girls altered by the sense

00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:35.660
that there's one
out of 15 people

00:45:35.660 --> 00:45:38.680
as a woman at this table,
and the boys' sense--

00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:46.900
for both-- of what is normal
shaped again by that picture?

00:45:46.900 --> 00:45:49.420
So needless to say,
in the 21st century,

00:45:49.420 --> 00:45:51.160
it should not and
should never have

00:45:51.160 --> 00:45:53.440
been seen as normal for
women to have only one seat

00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:56.510
at that table or any table.

00:45:56.510 --> 00:45:59.050
So I am working on a
book about my experiences

00:45:59.050 --> 00:46:00.610
in government
provisionally titled

00:46:00.610 --> 00:46:04.660
The Education of an Idealist, a
title that will likely change,

00:46:04.660 --> 00:46:09.661
because why is it only idealists
who get educated, I ask you,

00:46:09.661 --> 00:46:11.410
but nonetheless, gives
you a sense of what

00:46:11.410 --> 00:46:12.495
I'm trying to track.

00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:19.870
But in part, because of all
that is going on around us now

00:46:19.870 --> 00:46:23.770
and the bravery of women
across so many domains,

00:46:23.770 --> 00:46:26.530
I am asking myself questions
that I haven't really

00:46:26.530 --> 00:46:28.600
asked before.

00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:33.100
Has my professional life been
impacted more by these issues

00:46:33.100 --> 00:46:34.210
than I recognized?

00:46:34.210 --> 00:46:37.870
Was I, at times, dismissed
or underestimated

00:46:37.870 --> 00:46:38.800
because of my gender?

00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:42.490
Have I myself blocked
out various dimensions

00:46:42.490 --> 00:46:44.770
of the problem, and
in so doing, failed

00:46:44.770 --> 00:46:49.000
to do as much as I should
have myself in the positions

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:51.340
that I've had to
combat this phenomenon?

00:46:51.340 --> 00:46:54.850
And how can I equip
my young daughter

00:46:54.850 --> 00:46:57.562
to handle what
lies ahead for her?

00:46:57.562 --> 00:46:59.770
So I'm still wrestling with
these personal questions.

00:46:59.770 --> 00:47:02.080
And I don't have
great answers yet.

00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:06.010
But I have, for the
purposes of today, at least,

00:47:06.010 --> 00:47:10.300
tried to distill what
are the lessons for now,

00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:13.030
at least as I can offer them up.

00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:16.654
So here are a few ideas,
at least, humbly put,

00:47:16.654 --> 00:47:17.320
tentatively put.

00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:22.190
But first, I think women
have a wonderful opportunity

00:47:22.190 --> 00:47:26.170
and responsibility to have
the backs of other women.

00:47:26.170 --> 00:47:28.420
I tried to use my
perch at the UN

00:47:28.420 --> 00:47:34.060
to push for women's voices
to be heard around the world.

00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:35.530
Often, I was unsuccessful.

00:47:35.530 --> 00:47:39.100
But at times, we were able
to line the moons up in a way

00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:40.900
that I think mattered.

00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:47.530
One example is that I launched
a campaign called #FreeThe20,

00:47:47.530 --> 00:47:51.880
which was aimed at securing the
release of 20 women political

00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:53.260
prisoners around the world.

00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:55.750
These are voices of women
that were being silenced

00:47:55.750 --> 00:47:59.380
in Egypt, Ethiopia,
Venezuela, China,

00:47:59.380 --> 00:48:01.050
a whole bunch of countries.

00:48:01.050 --> 00:48:03.430
And here were the 20 women.

00:48:03.430 --> 00:48:06.250
I would hang-- each
day for 20 days,

00:48:06.250 --> 00:48:09.250
we hung a portrait of one of
the women and profiled them.

00:48:09.250 --> 00:48:12.340
And social media and the State
Department and the White House

00:48:12.340 --> 00:48:15.790
got behind it, as did
members of Congress.

00:48:15.790 --> 00:48:19.324
And I think, thanks to a lot of
advocacy, and particularly that

00:48:19.324 --> 00:48:20.740
by outside groups
who have nothing

00:48:20.740 --> 00:48:22.656
to do with the US
government-- but in the end,

00:48:22.656 --> 00:48:27.310
together, 16 of the 20
prisoners we profiled

00:48:27.310 --> 00:48:29.840
gained their freedom.

00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:31.740
The other thing I did was--

00:48:31.740 --> 00:48:37.120
and, again, much of what
I did was ineffective.

00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:40.540
What I'm about to describe felt
like there was a power to it,

00:48:40.540 --> 00:48:45.040
but very, very hard
to know, certainly

00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:48.550
in the short term, but just
a simple thing that all of us

00:48:48.550 --> 00:48:50.650
have in our power
to do today, which

00:48:50.650 --> 00:48:54.070
is just while traveling
abroad as UN ambassador,

00:48:54.070 --> 00:48:56.020
just insisting on
every one of my trips

00:48:56.020 --> 00:48:57.910
that I would just
meet with young girls

00:48:57.910 --> 00:49:01.090
in difficult situations
and just talk to them

00:49:01.090 --> 00:49:02.620
about their aspirations.

00:49:02.620 --> 00:49:04.960
And most of these
girls, you can imagine,

00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:08.651
had never met a high-ranking
female official.

00:49:08.651 --> 00:49:10.900
In Mexico, I met with a group
of underprivileged girls

00:49:10.900 --> 00:49:13.105
in a soccer league,
played soccer with them.

00:49:13.105 --> 00:49:14.980
In Nigeria, I met with
a group of schoolgirls

00:49:14.980 --> 00:49:17.990
from Chibok, which many of you
know from the news who-- these

00:49:17.990 --> 00:49:20.470
were girls who had been
captured by Boko Haram,

00:49:20.470 --> 00:49:24.610
but then mercifully had
escaped in the early part

00:49:24.610 --> 00:49:26.110
of their captivity.

00:49:26.110 --> 00:49:30.550
In the war-ravaged north of Sri
Lanka, meeting with Buddhist

00:49:30.550 --> 00:49:32.770
and Muslim girls who
were learning how to

00:49:32.770 --> 00:49:34.510
live together again.

00:49:34.510 --> 00:49:37.300
And in Israel and the
Palestinian territories,

00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:39.010
sitting down with
honor students who

00:49:39.010 --> 00:49:42.160
dreamed of becoming
engineers, architects,

00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:46.100
and even a few politicians.

00:49:46.100 --> 00:49:48.640
So, I mean, the hurdles
that these girls faced

00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:49.870
were unimaginable.

00:49:49.870 --> 00:49:54.910
But again, the ferocity of their
determination and discipline

00:49:54.910 --> 00:49:57.100
left me and the
members of my team

00:49:57.100 --> 00:49:59.920
completely blown
away and inspired.

00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:01.450
We still have a
huge amount of work

00:50:01.450 --> 00:50:05.020
to do in ensuring
women and girls abroad

00:50:05.020 --> 00:50:08.230
and at home have the
confidence to pursue

00:50:08.230 --> 00:50:11.750
the ambitions that they
think up for themselves.

00:50:11.750 --> 00:50:16.750
I'll give you an American
statistic that's quite jarring.

00:50:16.750 --> 00:50:18.910
American men are
both more likely

00:50:18.910 --> 00:50:22.630
to see themselves as qualified
to run for political office

00:50:22.630 --> 00:50:25.240
and much more likely to receive
encouragement from family

00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:27.070
and friends to do so.

00:50:27.070 --> 00:50:28.480
A pair of studies--

00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:31.930
one from 2001, one 2011--
found that men were almost 60%

00:50:31.930 --> 00:50:34.390
more likely than women
to describe themselves

00:50:34.390 --> 00:50:37.416
as very qualified to be a
candidate, even though the men

00:50:37.416 --> 00:50:39.790
and women surveyed were both
equally experienced in terms

00:50:39.790 --> 00:50:42.520
of fundraising, policy
knowledge, et cetera.

00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:44.770
A follow-on report that
focused on young people

00:50:44.770 --> 00:50:47.260
similarly found that
female college students

00:50:47.260 --> 00:50:50.740
are less likely than their male
peers to feel that they have

00:50:50.740 --> 00:50:52.135
what it takes to run for office.

00:50:52.135 --> 00:50:55.150
And that's, again, more recent.

00:50:55.150 --> 00:50:58.660
This self-doubt manifests
itself in a whole bunch

00:50:58.660 --> 00:51:00.760
of very subtle ways.

00:51:00.760 --> 00:51:05.230
A fascinating survey-- oh,
you can't actually see it--

00:51:05.230 --> 00:51:09.220
of Americans age 15 to 24 was
released just two weeks ago.

00:51:09.220 --> 00:51:11.500
And it confirmed what
we have all been seeing.

00:51:11.500 --> 00:51:13.390
Young women
distinguished themselves

00:51:13.390 --> 00:51:17.290
as much more politically engaged
than their male counterparts

00:51:17.290 --> 00:51:19.150
in 2017.

00:51:19.150 --> 00:51:22.240
And that was on everything from
volunteering to donating money

00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:24.370
to attending demonstrations.

00:51:24.370 --> 00:51:27.370
At the same time, a much
higher percentage of women

00:51:27.370 --> 00:51:29.740
cited a lack of knowledge
about the issues

00:51:29.740 --> 00:51:32.890
or a fear of undue
criticism as explanations

00:51:32.890 --> 00:51:36.370
for why they decided not
to be politically active.

00:51:36.370 --> 00:51:38.650
As teachers,
parents, and mentors,

00:51:38.650 --> 00:51:41.230
we've got to somehow
find a way to continue

00:51:41.230 --> 00:51:45.340
to narrow and close, in the
end, this confidence gap.

00:51:45.340 --> 00:51:48.970
Second, if we want
to make change,

00:51:48.970 --> 00:51:51.100
we who share a
desire to see change

00:51:51.100 --> 00:51:56.799
must embrace politics
in all of its messiness.

00:51:56.799 --> 00:51:57.340
I don't know.

00:51:57.340 --> 00:51:59.380
That's sort of the
biggest realization

00:51:59.380 --> 00:52:01.550
I have on all national
security issues,

00:52:01.550 --> 00:52:04.180
and certainly on this issue,
anything related to gender.

00:52:04.180 --> 00:52:08.050
There's really no
obvious door number two.

00:52:08.050 --> 00:52:09.520
Politics, politics, politics.

00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:12.610
And here, again, some
good news, EMILY's List,

00:52:12.610 --> 00:52:14.560
which for more
than three decades

00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:18.430
has been tracking the
number of women who have

00:52:18.430 --> 00:52:22.060
come forward to run for office--

00:52:22.060 --> 00:52:26.100
EMILY's List, as you know,
has existed for 32 years

00:52:26.100 --> 00:52:30.040
and it helps recruit and
elect pro-choice women.

00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:33.970
But it reported that in
2016, the 32-year-old record

00:52:33.970 --> 00:52:37.840
was shattered, that 920
women had come forward

00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:40.360
seeking information about
how to run for office.

00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:46.420
Now, in 2017, the year that
just closed out, the 920 was--

00:52:46.420 --> 00:52:50.965
looks like the 19th century,
22,000 women reached out.

00:52:50.965 --> 00:52:54.250
So that just gives you a sense,
like that was the prior record.

00:52:54.250 --> 00:52:57.310
And that's captured in a lot of
what we read about, of course,

00:52:57.310 --> 00:52:58.990
in terms of women's engagement.

00:52:58.990 --> 00:53:02.950
Between 2016 and now,
the number of women

00:53:02.950 --> 00:53:07.990
running for congressional or
statewide offices has doubled.

00:53:07.990 --> 00:53:10.990
And in those crucial races
for control of the House,

00:53:10.990 --> 00:53:14.530
so far there are
389 women running,

00:53:14.530 --> 00:53:16.750
the most female
candidates ever seeking

00:53:16.750 --> 00:53:20.000
to become a US representative.

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:21.910
And women are not only running.

00:53:21.910 --> 00:53:23.150
They are winning.

00:53:23.150 --> 00:53:26.990
In Virginia, 11 of the
14 women candidates

00:53:26.990 --> 00:53:29.930
for the House of Delegates
backed by EMILY's List

00:53:29.930 --> 00:53:32.480
won their races, 11 out of 14.

00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:36.110
Many of these women were
firsts for the Virginia House,

00:53:36.110 --> 00:53:38.600
the first Latina, the
first Asian-American,

00:53:38.600 --> 00:53:42.890
the first lesbian, and the
first transgender woman.

00:53:42.890 --> 00:53:46.520
Signing ceremony looks a
little different than often.

00:53:46.520 --> 00:53:49.190
But we must acknowledge, of
course, that change is slow.

00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:52.120
And incremental gains
never seem to be enough.

00:53:52.120 --> 00:53:55.130
At the current rate of
progress, without knowing,

00:53:55.130 --> 00:54:00.020
now, the outcome of 2018, where
so many more women are getting

00:54:00.020 --> 00:54:01.940
involved, but--

00:54:01.940 --> 00:54:03.350
so putting that to one side.

00:54:03.350 --> 00:54:06.170
But it would, unless that
makes a major difference,

00:54:06.170 --> 00:54:10.670
take another 75 years to achieve
gender parity in Congress

00:54:10.670 --> 00:54:13.640
and 152 years for
state governors.

00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:15.514
Now, that's not what
it's going to take.

00:54:15.514 --> 00:54:17.180
It's going to take a
lot less than that.

00:54:17.180 --> 00:54:20.240
But that's if we
were to extrapolate

00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:22.130
on the basis of
where we are now.

00:54:22.130 --> 00:54:25.490
Shelly Simmons, a name
you might remember

00:54:25.490 --> 00:54:28.910
from the news of the
last couple months,

00:54:28.910 --> 00:54:31.130
tied for her Virginia seat.

00:54:31.130 --> 00:54:33.950
And she lost, then, if
you can call it that,

00:54:33.950 --> 00:54:36.980
because of the random
drawing to break the tie that

00:54:36.980 --> 00:54:39.830
went in her opponent's favor.

00:54:39.830 --> 00:54:43.490
And afterward, she said, "I'm
my usual, angry, pissed-off self

00:54:43.490 --> 00:54:45.290
about the situation.

00:54:45.290 --> 00:54:48.560
Next time, I'm not
going to lose."

00:54:48.560 --> 00:54:50.990
And it seems like it will
take that kind of resilience

00:54:50.990 --> 00:54:54.230
and determination to accelerate
those numbers and the pace

00:54:54.230 --> 00:54:55.760
of change.

00:54:55.760 --> 00:54:57.620
Third-- and I only have four--

00:54:57.620 --> 00:55:02.600
I think those of us who have
been fortunate enough to obtain

00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:05.402
high-profile roles
as women leaders--

00:55:05.402 --> 00:55:06.860
my own view is that
we could afford

00:55:06.860 --> 00:55:10.460
to be more open about the
doubts and the challenges

00:55:10.460 --> 00:55:12.560
that we face.

00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:17.510
Madeleine Albright I've always
really admired for doing this.

00:55:17.510 --> 00:55:20.810
She has often talked about being
the only woman at the table

00:55:20.810 --> 00:55:24.590
in policy debates and thinking--
and these are her words--

00:55:24.590 --> 00:55:26.480
"OK, well, I don't
think I'll say that.

00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:28.104
It might sound stupid.

00:55:28.104 --> 00:55:30.020
And then some man says
it and everybody thinks

00:55:30.020 --> 00:55:31.103
it's completely brilliant.

00:55:31.103 --> 00:55:35.440
And you were so mad at yourself
for not saying something."

00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:36.530
And that's Madeleine.

00:55:36.530 --> 00:55:38.750
Across male-dominated
fields, women

00:55:38.750 --> 00:55:41.150
experience many of
the same dynamics.

00:55:41.150 --> 00:55:44.260
But we don't always
seek each other out

00:55:44.260 --> 00:55:45.410
to learn from one another.

00:55:45.410 --> 00:55:48.380
And I know that, while I
never would have been the one

00:55:48.380 --> 00:55:52.400
to create this Wednesday group
I told you about at the NSC,

00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:54.320
I'm so glad that
one of my colleagues

00:55:54.320 --> 00:55:56.150
had the insight to do so.

00:55:56.150 --> 00:55:59.210
The busier one is, the
less time one feels

00:55:59.210 --> 00:56:00.630
one has for such initiatives.

00:56:00.630 --> 00:56:04.070
But I think they offer
consolation and inspiration

00:56:04.070 --> 00:56:05.540
at once.

00:56:05.540 --> 00:56:09.950
We women are often the jugglers
if we happen to have kids.

00:56:09.950 --> 00:56:12.920
No amount of leaning in appears
to have changed the fact

00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:16.520
that we are the ones likely to
be orchestrating the carpool

00:56:16.520 --> 00:56:19.040
and making sure our kids
brush their teeth properly.

00:56:19.040 --> 00:56:23.180
Sorry, I'm sure there are
amazing male parents here.

00:56:26.390 --> 00:56:30.140
In my household, the
modernity has not yet

00:56:30.140 --> 00:56:32.405
struck on these matters.

00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:36.410
He's out of town, so I can--

00:56:36.410 --> 00:56:37.791
I get away with this.

00:56:37.791 --> 00:56:40.040
But feel free to bring it
up the next time you see him

00:56:40.040 --> 00:56:42.530
at Harvard Law School.

00:56:42.530 --> 00:56:46.140
Some women perform
the miracle juggle.

00:56:46.140 --> 00:56:47.930
I mean, most women
perform the miracle

00:56:47.930 --> 00:56:51.110
juggle without
advertising it, somehow

00:56:51.110 --> 00:56:54.410
managing their jobs
or their home lives

00:56:54.410 --> 00:56:56.930
as if with their
left hands, making

00:56:56.930 --> 00:56:58.910
it look easy from the outside.

00:56:58.910 --> 00:57:02.990
I have been incredibly lucky
to have a lot of support

00:57:02.990 --> 00:57:06.350
for my juggle, including
my mother and my parents.

00:57:06.350 --> 00:57:09.550
But I've never found it
easy and have always--

00:57:09.550 --> 00:57:12.470
or at least, since I've
been in public life,

00:57:12.470 --> 00:57:17.240
advertised those challenges
for what they're worth.

00:57:17.240 --> 00:57:19.580
The time I really
started doing that was

00:57:19.580 --> 00:57:23.600
when I had a grueling
confirmation hearing because

00:57:23.600 --> 00:57:26.570
of what I had written as an
activist and an academic.

00:57:26.570 --> 00:57:28.590
It was very difficult to
go before the US Senate

00:57:28.590 --> 00:57:30.173
and then have to
answer for everything

00:57:30.173 --> 00:57:33.000
I'd said and written
my entire life.

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:35.350
So it was difficult.
And the gavel sounded.

00:57:35.350 --> 00:57:36.305
Finally, it was over.

00:57:36.305 --> 00:57:39.330
And I prepared for it for weeks.

00:57:39.330 --> 00:57:42.800
And my four-year-old
son jumped into my arms.

00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:44.005
I know.

00:57:44.005 --> 00:57:45.230
And he's such a ham.

00:57:45.230 --> 00:57:49.190
He was like, yay, I've been
waiting for this my whole life.

00:57:49.190 --> 00:57:50.720
And a good few--
you can't see it,

00:57:50.720 --> 00:57:53.072
but basically, a scrum
of reporters came

00:57:53.072 --> 00:57:54.530
and they start
snapping this photo.

00:57:54.530 --> 00:57:59.000
And it was published in
a good few newspapers.

00:58:01.590 --> 00:58:03.930
It's a lovely photo of my son.

00:58:03.930 --> 00:58:05.930
And it just captures
my relief, I think,

00:58:05.930 --> 00:58:08.760
at surviving my
confirmation hearing.

00:58:08.760 --> 00:58:10.700
But what amazed
me about this was

00:58:10.700 --> 00:58:13.820
I started getting notes from all
over the country, and even some

00:58:13.820 --> 00:58:16.280
from around the world, just
saying how heartened they

00:58:16.280 --> 00:58:19.500
were to see somebody attempting
a national security cabinet

00:58:19.500 --> 00:58:22.040
role with small children in tow.

00:58:22.040 --> 00:58:25.040
And again, I just didn't--
that wasn't my orientation.

00:58:25.040 --> 00:58:27.410
I didn't think in those
terms, and then began

00:58:27.410 --> 00:58:33.620
to be much more public
about some of the dimensions

00:58:33.620 --> 00:58:35.780
to my juggling.

00:58:35.780 --> 00:58:40.580
So this meant speaking about
the inelegance of my efforts

00:58:40.580 --> 00:58:42.671
to work and mother
at the same time.

00:58:42.671 --> 00:58:45.170
This was my approach, not the
one I recommend for everybody.

00:58:45.170 --> 00:58:47.540
So I might have mentioned
publicly several times

00:58:47.540 --> 00:58:50.450
how I breastfed my
daughter while on the phone

00:58:50.450 --> 00:58:52.220
with the UN
Secretary-General talking

00:58:52.220 --> 00:58:56.270
about a chemical
weapons attack in Syria.

00:58:56.270 --> 00:58:58.820
Or the way in which--

00:58:58.820 --> 00:59:02.480
in order to explain my
absences to my boy, Declan,

00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:05.750
I taught him more about
Vladimir Putin and Crimea

00:59:05.750 --> 00:59:10.100
than is probably healthy
for a seven-year-old.

00:59:10.100 --> 00:59:11.930
But the point is,
every woman has

00:59:11.930 --> 00:59:15.270
her own way of managing
their very particular juggle

00:59:15.270 --> 00:59:18.080
and so too makes up her
own mind-- the same true

00:59:18.080 --> 00:59:21.140
with working dads, of course,
as well-- about how transparent

00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:23.240
to be about that challenge.

00:59:23.240 --> 00:59:25.130
My conscious
decision, particularly

00:59:25.130 --> 00:59:27.129
in the wake of the reaction
I had to this photo,

00:59:27.129 --> 00:59:30.710
was to overshare, which
may be a weakness of mine.

00:59:30.710 --> 00:59:34.430
Fourth and finally,
even amid the cruelty

00:59:34.430 --> 00:59:39.650
being perpetrated by our
current president and the desire

00:59:39.650 --> 00:59:43.910
many of us have to change
the whole world at once,

00:59:43.910 --> 00:59:49.100
I think figuring out how
to be good with bite-sized

00:59:49.100 --> 00:59:52.640
contributions and doing
what each of us can do,

00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:54.650
what is-- identifying
and pursuing what

00:59:54.650 --> 00:59:58.440
is in each of our power to do.

00:59:58.440 --> 01:00:00.980
It's about what is one's
specific difference.

01:00:00.980 --> 01:00:04.610
What is the specific
difference each of us can make?

01:00:04.610 --> 01:00:07.520
And it is going to be millions
of small contributions

01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:11.670
that ultimately produce the
kind of equality that we seek.

01:00:11.670 --> 01:00:13.489
And here, it was a
Martin Luther King--

01:00:13.489 --> 01:00:15.530
I love Martin Luther King
quotes, constantly been

01:00:15.530 --> 01:00:16.370
quoting them my whole life.

01:00:16.370 --> 01:00:19.190
But I had never seen this quote,
but is now my favorite Martin

01:00:19.190 --> 01:00:23.450
Luther King quote, "Be a
bush if you can't be a tree.

01:00:23.450 --> 01:00:26.870
If you can't be a
highway, just be a trail.

01:00:26.870 --> 01:00:29.300
If you can't be
a sun, be a star,

01:00:29.300 --> 01:00:31.970
for it isn't by size
that you win or fail.

01:00:31.970 --> 01:00:34.260
Be the best at
whatever you are."

01:00:34.260 --> 01:00:37.490
And here, inspired a
little bit by a talk

01:00:37.490 --> 01:00:41.270
that Kathryn Sikkink
gave on Tuesday,

01:00:41.270 --> 01:00:45.450
I would point to the
simple act even of voting,

01:00:45.450 --> 01:00:49.400
which all citizens have it
within their power to do.

01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:52.040
And focusing
specifically on women,

01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:56.120
it is devastating to note that,
while women still generally

01:00:56.120 --> 01:01:01.850
vote more than men in the United
States, female turnout in 2016

01:01:01.850 --> 01:01:08.420
was down when compared
to 2004, 2008, and 2012.

01:01:08.420 --> 01:01:10.760
Given the stakes
and the consequences

01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:12.680
that we're living
every day, that's

01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:16.347
something we have got to remedy.

01:01:16.347 --> 01:01:18.680
And that's with the chance
to elect even the first woman

01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:21.590
president in American history.

01:01:21.590 --> 01:01:24.440
We have to find a way to
rally our family and friends,

01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:27.830
having worked so hard
to secure for women

01:01:27.830 --> 01:01:30.740
a voice in American
political life,

01:01:30.740 --> 01:01:32.720
encouraging women
to raise that voice

01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:35.780
and insist that they be heard.

01:01:35.780 --> 01:01:37.610
In addition-- and
this is just because I

01:01:37.610 --> 01:01:42.920
feel like every talk that's
in any way about politics

01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:46.590
or public policy needs to
address this in some fashion.

01:01:46.590 --> 01:01:49.880
But I think part, again,
of our small contributions

01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:52.970
before we are able to
make the big ones relates

01:01:52.970 --> 01:01:54.320
to political polarization.

01:01:57.290 --> 01:02:00.860
Speaking here directly to
women, if we are mothers,

01:02:00.860 --> 01:02:03.260
we are talking
incessantly about our kids

01:02:03.260 --> 01:02:05.180
to other mothers and fathers.

01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:06.656
Now, in the Republic
of Cambridge,

01:02:06.656 --> 01:02:08.780
it may be that we don't--
there isn't a huge amount

01:02:08.780 --> 01:02:09.650
of diversity there.

01:02:09.650 --> 01:02:13.260
But in most communities,
it is still--

01:02:13.260 --> 01:02:15.650
there is more plurality
in those communities

01:02:15.650 --> 01:02:19.910
than is reflected by
our electoral maps.

01:02:19.910 --> 01:02:24.500
And I think, again,
all of us, as people

01:02:24.500 --> 01:02:27.470
who are parts of
families, want our leaders

01:02:27.470 --> 01:02:30.810
to solve practical
problems for our families.

01:02:30.810 --> 01:02:32.690
So here, again, just
we can all do better

01:02:32.690 --> 01:02:34.550
at trying to listen
to one another

01:02:34.550 --> 01:02:37.310
and be prepared to change
our minds, something that

01:02:37.310 --> 01:02:42.260
gets harder and harder
given what is coming at us,

01:02:42.260 --> 01:02:44.930
trying to reclaim this
world of facts and truth

01:02:44.930 --> 01:02:48.860
and putting our minds to
the larger epistemological

01:02:48.860 --> 01:02:51.920
challenge of how
we go about that

01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:55.190
and focusing on what unites
us, which notwithstanding,

01:02:55.190 --> 01:02:58.910
again, the group of
people that appear

01:02:58.910 --> 01:03:00.830
to want to go in a
different direction,

01:03:00.830 --> 01:03:03.650
wanting security and
dignity for our families

01:03:03.650 --> 01:03:05.950
and our communities
really does--

01:03:05.950 --> 01:03:09.570
it can unite the vast majority
of people in this country.

01:03:09.570 --> 01:03:16.370
And in the spirit of talking
about aspiring to breaking down

01:03:16.370 --> 01:03:20.140
some of the echo chambers in
our country and our culture,

01:03:20.140 --> 01:03:22.900
I would note that this national
reckoning that I've referred to

01:03:22.900 --> 01:03:25.690
and that is so much with
us in so many spheres

01:03:25.690 --> 01:03:29.080
right now was kicked
off by none other

01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:33.760
than Gretchen Carlson, a
longtime Fox News anchor who,

01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:36.310
for many years, hosted Fox
&amp; Friends, Donald Trump's

01:03:36.310 --> 01:03:37.990
favorite TV show.

01:03:37.990 --> 01:03:41.530
And as a direct result
of Carlson's bravery

01:03:41.530 --> 01:03:44.560
in coming forward with her
stories of sexual harassment,

01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:47.210
Roger Ailes resigned
as president of Fox.

01:03:47.210 --> 01:03:48.940
This started a
domino effect that

01:03:48.940 --> 01:03:51.730
led to the dismissal of Bill
O'Reilly and top network

01:03:51.730 --> 01:03:52.870
executives.

01:03:52.870 --> 01:03:56.140
And today, Gretchen
Carlson is a major force

01:03:56.140 --> 01:03:59.710
behind pursuing bipartisan
legislation that is now

01:03:59.710 --> 01:04:02.620
pending before Congress,
which would invalidate

01:04:02.620 --> 01:04:06.850
unfair mandatory arbitration
clauses that allow employers

01:04:06.850 --> 01:04:09.970
to cover up patterns of
abuse by preventing employees

01:04:09.970 --> 01:04:13.480
from taking cases of
sexual harassment to court.

01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:18.160
I would like to close and really
look forward to the discussion.

01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:22.700
These are difficult
times, to say the least.

01:04:22.700 --> 01:04:25.030
But America's history--

01:04:25.030 --> 01:04:27.570
I need that back.

01:04:27.570 --> 01:04:28.390
I need that back.

01:04:28.390 --> 01:04:30.010
Can I have that back?

01:04:30.010 --> 01:04:31.900
Thank you.

01:04:31.900 --> 01:04:36.550
America's history is, of course,
filled with difficult times.

01:04:36.550 --> 01:04:42.020
And women have always been
among the first to rise.

01:04:42.020 --> 01:04:44.380
At the risk, again, of
pandering at Radcliffe,

01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:47.860
the historian Gerda
Lerner once counseled,

01:04:47.860 --> 01:04:49.450
"Always ask, what
did the women do

01:04:49.450 --> 01:04:51.449
while the men were doing
what the textbook tells

01:04:51.449 --> 01:04:54.650
us was important?"

01:04:54.650 --> 01:04:58.060
And here, just again in the
realm of inspiring historical

01:04:58.060 --> 01:05:01.420
tidbits, 4,500 women
launched campaigns for office

01:05:01.420 --> 01:05:05.650
before the ratification of
the 19th Amendment in 1920.

01:05:05.650 --> 01:05:08.200
And somewhat amazingly, given
the times, more than 3,000

01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:09.590
won those races.

01:05:09.590 --> 01:05:13.630
And Susanna Salter, who was
the first woman ever elected

01:05:13.630 --> 01:05:18.370
mayor in the US, was put
on the ballot in Kansas

01:05:18.370 --> 01:05:22.330
by a group of men who thought
it would be a hilarious joke

01:05:22.330 --> 01:05:25.610
until she won 2/3 of the votes.

01:05:25.610 --> 01:05:27.520
So we think we have it bad.

01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:30.490
Women were a driving
force in the movement

01:05:30.490 --> 01:05:33.370
to abolish slavery,
and a century later,

01:05:33.370 --> 01:05:34.990
in the civil rights movement.

01:05:34.990 --> 01:05:36.880
We remember the
names, of course,

01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:40.660
of Rosa Parks and Fannie
Lou Hamer, Sojourner Truth.

01:05:40.660 --> 01:05:42.760
But women whose
names never appeared

01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:45.460
in bold print also helped
carry these movements,

01:05:45.460 --> 01:05:48.250
women like Alabama's
Jo Ann Robinson,

01:05:48.250 --> 01:05:53.200
who mimeographed 35,000 leaflets
the night of Rosa Parks' arrest

01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:55.421
to publicize the
first bus boycott.

01:05:55.421 --> 01:05:57.670
And of course, when it came
to fighting for equal pay,

01:05:57.670 --> 01:05:59.980
it was a woman,
Lilly Ledbetter, who

01:05:59.980 --> 01:06:01.630
never gave up, even
when the Supreme

01:06:01.630 --> 01:06:03.100
Court sided against her.

01:06:03.100 --> 01:06:05.470
She appealed all the
way to President Obama,

01:06:05.470 --> 01:06:08.260
who signed the Lilly Ledbetter
Fair Pay Act in 2009,

01:06:08.260 --> 01:06:10.570
helping restore
protections for women

01:06:10.570 --> 01:06:12.730
against pay discrimination.

01:06:12.730 --> 01:06:15.340
It is clear that women
and men must unite

01:06:15.340 --> 01:06:18.140
behind the cause of equality.

01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:21.850
It has been a year since the
incredible women's marches.

01:06:21.850 --> 01:06:24.370
And we've just had the
anniversary marches.

01:06:24.370 --> 01:06:30.007
My favorite sign was one
hoisted by a middle-aged man.

01:06:30.007 --> 01:06:33.346
[LAUGHTER]

01:06:35.740 --> 01:06:39.175
I think that kind
of says it all.

01:06:39.175 --> 01:06:42.790
"Not usually a sign
guy, but geez."

01:06:42.790 --> 01:06:47.710
So influenced by Sign Guy,
who I hope to meet someday,

01:06:47.710 --> 01:06:51.320
it does seem the right time
to ask, what are each of us

01:06:51.320 --> 01:06:56.050
normally not that these times
suddenly require us to be?

01:06:56.050 --> 01:07:01.330
And little girls like this
one are counting on us

01:07:01.330 --> 01:07:02.330
to figure that out.

01:07:02.330 --> 01:07:02.960
So thank you.

01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:03.751
That's my daughter.

01:07:03.751 --> 01:07:06.896
[APPLAUSE]

01:07:06.896 --> 01:07:07.872
Thank you.

01:07:19.039 --> 01:07:19.580
- Is it time?

01:07:19.580 --> 01:07:20.190
- Yeah.

01:07:20.190 --> 01:07:20.690
- Hi.

01:07:20.690 --> 01:07:21.060
Thank you.

01:07:21.060 --> 01:07:22.380
- Please, yeah, if you
could just introduce

01:07:22.380 --> 01:07:23.430
yourself, maybe, and--

01:07:23.430 --> 01:07:24.595
- Sure.

01:07:24.595 --> 01:07:26.180
My name is Tanya [INAUDIBLE].

01:07:26.180 --> 01:07:28.640
I'm a Harvard
Radcliffe graduate,

01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:33.170
a concert pianist with
interest in many disciplines.

01:07:33.170 --> 01:07:35.800
And I try to speak
up in my hometown

01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:43.850
about issues, irregularities,
process matters, et cetera.

01:07:43.850 --> 01:07:49.590
So I am going to also ask
about a foreign policy

01:07:49.590 --> 01:07:53.700
question, which is
the non-recognition

01:07:53.700 --> 01:07:55.200
of the Armenian Genocide.

01:07:55.200 --> 01:08:00.840
I do happen to be Armenian,
but pretend I am Norwegian.

01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:04.080
I grew up in Turkey, so
I have made my own peace

01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:05.110
with the issue.

01:08:05.110 --> 01:08:06.540
But I am concerned.

01:08:09.230 --> 01:08:13.560
I know that it can't be an
easy matter in foreign policy

01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:16.830
because Turkey is
a military ally

01:08:16.830 --> 01:08:23.319
and they don't want
1915 stuff recognized.

01:08:23.319 --> 01:08:24.140
What do you think?

01:08:24.140 --> 01:08:27.479
Wouldn't it be better
if genocides were all

01:08:27.479 --> 01:08:31.220
recognized so that,
A, they don't repeat,

01:08:31.220 --> 01:08:34.500
B, we call them genocide
as they happen today,

01:08:34.500 --> 01:08:37.410
like the Rohingya?

01:08:37.410 --> 01:08:39.720
And maybe it explains
more of what's

01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:41.160
going on in the
Middle East today.

01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:42.210
Thank you.

01:08:42.210 --> 01:08:44.890
- Thank you very much.

01:08:44.890 --> 01:08:47.140
I agree with you.

01:08:47.140 --> 01:08:49.109
I think genocide
should be recognized.

01:08:49.109 --> 01:08:54.870
I think when governments
or people or institutions

01:08:54.870 --> 01:08:57.990
are put in a position
where they have to contort

01:08:57.990 --> 01:09:01.890
and wiggle around and
come up with euphemisms,

01:09:01.890 --> 01:09:03.399
I think therein madness lies.

01:09:03.399 --> 01:09:07.580
And we, as your question--

01:09:07.580 --> 01:09:09.606
you're polite in the way
you pose your question,

01:09:09.606 --> 01:09:11.939
but as your question suggests,
we promised we were going

01:09:11.939 --> 01:09:13.980
to recognize the Armenian
Genocide and we didn't.

01:09:13.980 --> 01:09:19.529
And if you ask me why,
fundamentally, the president

01:09:19.529 --> 01:09:22.470
initially-- the right year to
do it would have been 2009.

01:09:22.470 --> 01:09:25.140
We had promised on the
campaign we'd just come off,

01:09:25.140 --> 01:09:29.680
rip the Band-Aid off, and
just say to President Erdogan,

01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:33.330
sorry, I made this commitment
and I keep my commitments.

01:09:33.330 --> 01:09:37.260
I mean, we were really
motivated as an administration

01:09:37.260 --> 01:09:40.622
by the set of things that
we had promised to do.

01:09:40.622 --> 01:09:42.330
But there was-- you
might remember-- back

01:09:42.330 --> 01:09:46.859
in 2009, a nascent normalization
process between Armenia

01:09:46.859 --> 01:09:48.270
and Turkey.

01:09:48.270 --> 01:09:52.750
And the president was convinced
that doing so would potentially

01:09:52.750 --> 01:09:57.780
set back that in-the-region
reckoning among the--

01:09:57.780 --> 01:10:00.060
between the parties.

01:10:00.060 --> 01:10:03.930
To me, it seemed more like
a ploy on the part of Turkey

01:10:03.930 --> 01:10:09.300
to get through April 24,
2009, the-- our first Armenian

01:10:09.300 --> 01:10:11.100
Genocide Remembrance
Day occasion,

01:10:11.100 --> 01:10:13.350
where we should have recognized.

01:10:13.350 --> 01:10:15.210
And I think that
history bore that out,

01:10:15.210 --> 01:10:19.740
that it ended up being not
a normalization process

01:10:19.740 --> 01:10:23.460
to which there was real
sincerity to make progress.

01:10:23.460 --> 01:10:25.320
Then the other occasion--

01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:27.900
of course, we could have done
it any year, but just the way

01:10:27.900 --> 01:10:30.870
government works, the
other bite at the apple

01:10:30.870 --> 01:10:32.460
was really on the
100th anniversary

01:10:32.460 --> 01:10:37.290
when Pope Francis recognized and
many countries and parliaments

01:10:37.290 --> 01:10:38.490
around the world.

01:10:38.490 --> 01:10:41.160
And there-- again, this
isn't by way of excuse.

01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:43.500
But just to give you a
sense of the context,

01:10:43.500 --> 01:10:46.100
we were just getting
access to Turkish bases

01:10:46.100 --> 01:10:48.054
to fight against ISIS.

01:10:48.054 --> 01:10:49.470
And there was a
fear that Erdogan,

01:10:49.470 --> 01:10:56.370
given his erratic way of
dealing with everything and his

01:10:56.370 --> 01:10:58.230
anti-Americanism and
so forth, would just--

01:10:58.230 --> 01:11:00.330
would actually sooner
have ISIS caliphate

01:11:00.330 --> 01:11:05.760
survive than allow Americans
to use these bases in the wake

01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:08.400
of the genocide recognition.

01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:10.362
So this is why they pay--

01:11:10.362 --> 01:11:12.570
President Obama didn't really
pay them the big bucks.

01:11:12.570 --> 01:11:16.020
But these are
really tough calls.

01:11:16.020 --> 01:11:18.920
But I think I come back
to your first premise.

01:11:18.920 --> 01:11:20.350
It's just, in general--

01:11:20.350 --> 01:11:24.002
it will serve you well
over time if you--

01:11:24.002 --> 01:11:26.330
if we as a government
and if we as people--

01:11:26.330 --> 01:11:27.592
if we tell the truth.

01:11:27.592 --> 01:11:29.010
Yep.

01:11:29.010 --> 01:11:29.636
- Yes, hi, my--

01:11:29.636 --> 01:11:30.260
[CLEARS THROAT]

01:11:30.260 --> 01:11:31.820
Sorry, I have a sore throat.

01:11:31.820 --> 01:11:32.870
My name is Ann Eldridge.

01:11:32.870 --> 01:11:40.640
And I wanted to ask a question
about relationships between men

01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:42.470
and women in the
diplomatic service

01:11:42.470 --> 01:11:44.720
and in national
security in general.

01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:46.640
I happen to have a classmate--

01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:51.050
class of 1957-- who
is a retired diplomat.

01:11:51.050 --> 01:11:53.510
And she was married to
a classmate who was also

01:11:53.510 --> 01:11:54.710
a diplomat and served--

01:11:54.710 --> 01:11:57.350
they both served in
many areas of the world.

01:11:57.350 --> 01:12:00.560
And actually, her career--
starting out in the 1960s doing

01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:01.730
this--

01:12:01.730 --> 01:12:05.180
is just replete with
the kinds of challenges

01:12:05.180 --> 01:12:09.081
that you described, including
being told that, well, he

01:12:09.081 --> 01:12:11.330
has this position and we
thought you were coming along

01:12:11.330 --> 01:12:13.490
to be his secretary.

01:12:13.490 --> 01:12:16.820
But I happened to be reading
her memoir, which just came out

01:12:16.820 --> 01:12:20.120
this year, just at the time
that Vice President Pence was

01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:23.600
talking about how it
is impossible to get

01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:27.590
into the elevator with a
woman who is not Mother.

01:12:27.590 --> 01:12:34.430
And the situations that you
describe in which men so

01:12:34.430 --> 01:12:39.860
vastly outnumber women and
women have to face situations

01:12:39.860 --> 01:12:45.230
where they will be the
only woman in a context,

01:12:45.230 --> 01:12:49.760
and then adding onto that,
the uneasiness that is now

01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:54.320
pervading the whole question
of male-female relationships--

01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:55.490
what if I say this?

01:12:55.490 --> 01:12:57.200
What if I do that?

01:12:57.200 --> 01:12:58.970
I just wonder if
you could comment

01:12:58.970 --> 01:13:03.320
on strategies that can address
those kinds of challenges.

01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:09.880
- Your answer's probably--

01:13:09.880 --> 01:13:12.039
and the answer of
people here would

01:13:12.039 --> 01:13:13.580
be better than mine,
maybe people who

01:13:13.580 --> 01:13:16.130
have reflected on this more.

01:13:16.130 --> 01:13:18.500
I think the
sensitization by virtue

01:13:18.500 --> 01:13:22.590
of the public conversation
is already a step.

01:13:22.590 --> 01:13:26.990
And I think that, right now, if
you take just one institution

01:13:26.990 --> 01:13:29.550
which is where the
diplomatic corps lives,

01:13:29.550 --> 01:13:32.510
it would have been great if
Secretary Tillerson, as part

01:13:32.510 --> 01:13:35.720
of this conversation,
had come out--

01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:38.930
He's so focused on the State
Department and the building

01:13:38.930 --> 01:13:41.990
and the positions and
the Foreign Service,

01:13:41.990 --> 01:13:49.490
but to make this a feature
of that, which I think

01:13:49.490 --> 01:13:50.930
is way too inward-looking.

01:13:50.930 --> 01:13:52.846
I think he's way too
inward-looking generally.

01:13:52.846 --> 01:13:55.577
I wish he'd tell us what
wars he wants to end

01:13:55.577 --> 01:13:57.410
and problems he wants
to solve in the world.

01:13:57.410 --> 01:14:00.537
But since he's not
that guy, at least

01:14:00.537 --> 01:14:02.120
if he's going to
deal with bureaucracy

01:14:02.120 --> 01:14:05.570
and make that his
passion, this is something

01:14:05.570 --> 01:14:09.140
that you can deal with
incentives and disincentives

01:14:09.140 --> 01:14:11.480
and structures and airings.

01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:13.849
But it's very hard
to do that when

01:14:13.849 --> 01:14:15.140
Donald Trump is your president.

01:14:15.140 --> 01:14:18.140
And so that's why when
it comes to, at least,

01:14:18.140 --> 01:14:21.020
the diplomatic world,
even though it feels

01:14:21.020 --> 01:14:24.780
like you can have a conversation
hived off from politics,

01:14:24.780 --> 01:14:26.450
it's about getting
rid of people who

01:14:26.450 --> 01:14:32.010
aren't dedicated to figuring
out how to manage this issue.

01:14:35.180 --> 01:14:36.566
It really is about--

01:14:36.566 --> 01:14:38.690
and I think-- there have
been interesting writings.

01:14:38.690 --> 01:14:43.400
Jake Sullivan, who was
Secretary Clinton's policy

01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:46.190
guy in the campaign is one
of the most impressive people

01:14:46.190 --> 01:14:49.050
I met in my eight
years in government.

01:14:49.050 --> 01:14:54.950
He came out in the wake of some
of the kinds of disclosures

01:14:54.950 --> 01:14:59.360
that I referenced today and
just talked about himself.

01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:03.260
Now, I would see him
as in the upper 1%

01:15:03.260 --> 01:15:08.570
of 1% of enlightened,
progressive men

01:15:08.570 --> 01:15:10.160
that I came across
in government.

01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:12.380
And there are many, but
I mean really top tier.

01:15:12.380 --> 01:15:14.810
And yet, he was the one-- he
writes a long piece saying,

01:15:14.810 --> 01:15:17.480
here are all the ways
in which I failed,

01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:22.835
because it isn't enough just to
be progressive and then neutral

01:15:22.835 --> 01:15:27.260
when that culture, which is
so subtle and hard to break

01:15:27.260 --> 01:15:29.610
through in, exists around me.

01:15:29.610 --> 01:15:31.580
And so here's a list
of the kinds of things

01:15:31.580 --> 01:15:34.340
I wish I had done
as a progressive guy

01:15:34.340 --> 01:15:36.210
while I was in a
position of power.

01:15:36.210 --> 01:15:38.520
He was Secretary Clinton's
deputy chief of staff

01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:41.850
and then was on the campaign.

01:15:41.850 --> 01:15:43.430
So I refer you to that article.

01:15:43.430 --> 01:15:45.680
I mean, I think we have
to change our leadership.

01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:48.740
And then our leadership
needs to find a way

01:15:48.740 --> 01:15:49.640
to be more proactive.

01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:52.460
But one of the reasons
I mention all the feeder

01:15:52.460 --> 01:15:58.070
information about think tanks
and media and panels and--

01:15:58.070 --> 01:16:01.370
that in this world of
diplomacy, it really

01:16:01.370 --> 01:16:04.220
would make a difference
if we started

01:16:04.220 --> 01:16:07.930
having an equal number of
people doing national security

01:16:07.930 --> 01:16:11.240
PhDs at the Kennedy
School, and if we

01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:17.900
started also internalizing
in our hiring

01:16:17.900 --> 01:16:19.640
the kinds of different
decisions women

01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:21.598
have to make at different
parts in their career

01:16:21.598 --> 01:16:24.530
and then make it easier
for them to hop back

01:16:24.530 --> 01:16:26.750
in if they've taken
time out, let's say,

01:16:26.750 --> 01:16:29.790
to have a baby or something.

01:16:29.790 --> 01:16:31.992
Anyway, so there's
a lot one can say.

01:16:31.992 --> 01:16:33.700
But I think the first
thing we have to do

01:16:33.700 --> 01:16:36.224
is just-- it's back to
politics, unfortunately.

01:16:39.500 --> 01:16:42.560
- Jay [? Gleason. ?] You're
right that it would be nice

01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:45.080
if Secretary Tillerson
would tell us

01:16:45.080 --> 01:16:49.160
how he wants to end the war in
Libya, which Barack Obama has

01:16:49.160 --> 01:16:50.960
called the worst mistake
of his presidency.

01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:53.990
You and Susan Rice and
the woman that you once

01:16:53.990 --> 01:16:55.760
referred to as a
monster, Hillary Clinton,

01:16:55.760 --> 01:16:58.280
were leading advocates
for that assault on Libya,

01:16:58.280 --> 01:17:01.400
whereas at the same time, men
in the cabinet, like Bob Gates

01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:03.470
and Tom Donilon and
then John Brennan

01:17:03.470 --> 01:17:07.580
were very much reluctant to take
on that type of intervention.

01:17:07.580 --> 01:17:09.280
So I can't help but
wonder whether women

01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:13.250
are becoming worse warmongers
and cold-blooded killers

01:17:13.250 --> 01:17:15.590
than men are.

01:17:15.590 --> 01:17:19.970
- Well the number of factual
inaccuracies that are implicit

01:17:19.970 --> 01:17:22.515
or that were stated
in your question

01:17:22.515 --> 01:17:24.890
do make me question whether
you were in the room with all

01:17:24.890 --> 01:17:28.040
this vivid detail about
who was on what side

01:17:28.040 --> 01:17:31.497
because much of what's
been written is inaccurate.

01:17:31.497 --> 01:17:33.080
But let me talk about
the intervention

01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:35.420
in Libya, which seems
to be the-- if I gather,

01:17:35.420 --> 01:17:37.550
the focus of your question.

01:17:37.550 --> 01:17:40.220
So in Libya, we
had a circumstance

01:17:40.220 --> 01:17:41.810
that we were
confronted with, which

01:17:41.810 --> 01:17:46.250
is that you had people who had
risen up against a dictator who

01:17:46.250 --> 01:17:51.530
was threatening to hunt the
people down like cockroaches,

01:17:51.530 --> 01:17:54.770
who had turned its sights
on Benghazi, which was where

01:17:54.770 --> 01:17:58.160
the revolution had started,
and where tens of thousands

01:17:58.160 --> 01:17:59.750
of peaceful protesters
were gathering

01:17:59.750 --> 01:18:02.150
every night in the main square.

01:18:02.150 --> 01:18:05.000
The Arab League called--

01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:06.950
had a meeting, an
unprecedented meeting,

01:18:06.950 --> 01:18:09.560
where it expelled Libya
from the Arab League

01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:13.400
and called for the world,
the international community

01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:16.760
to use all necessary means
to protect civilians.

01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:21.000
Then the British and the
French proposed a no-fly zone.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:24.930
Gaddafi-- we don't need to--

01:18:24.930 --> 01:18:28.592
Gaddafi wasn't using his
planes to carry out atrocities.

01:18:28.592 --> 01:18:30.050
All the evidence
we had was that it

01:18:30.050 --> 01:18:33.000
was his militia on the ground
who were hunting people down.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:36.960
And a no-fly zone basically
would not be effective.

01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:43.100
So we went to the United
Nations, which other than 9/11,

01:18:43.100 --> 01:18:45.680
basically had not
authorized the use of force

01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:49.220
to protect civilians in
more than two decades.

01:18:49.220 --> 01:18:51.290
And amazingly, the
UN Security Council,

01:18:51.290 --> 01:18:53.540
the arbiter of
international law,

01:18:53.540 --> 01:18:55.942
authorizes the use of
all necessary measures

01:18:55.942 --> 01:18:57.650
to protect civilians,
partly because they

01:18:57.650 --> 01:19:00.108
knew what Gaddafi was capable
of and what he was explicitly

01:19:00.108 --> 01:19:01.950
stating he was going to do.

01:19:01.950 --> 01:19:05.825
So the president then joined
with a coalition of countries

01:19:05.825 --> 01:19:07.700
in order to carry out
the intervention called

01:19:07.700 --> 01:19:09.825
for by the Arab League, by
the UN Security Council,

01:19:09.825 --> 01:19:12.380
and by the Libyan resistance.

01:19:12.380 --> 01:19:15.849
As it happened, in the
wake of the intervention,

01:19:15.849 --> 01:19:18.140
one of the things that the
same people had been calling

01:19:18.140 --> 01:19:20.150
for intervention were
absolutely adamant

01:19:20.150 --> 01:19:23.030
about was no foreign
presence, no foreign troops,

01:19:23.030 --> 01:19:25.220
no foreign police, no nothing.

01:19:25.220 --> 01:19:28.430
And in the wake of
what was initially

01:19:28.430 --> 01:19:33.920
a very beautiful time where
independent media flowered,

01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:37.400
civil society, women's
organizations, and the scrum

01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:41.690
of politics turned very
tribal, very messy,

01:19:41.690 --> 01:19:43.550
and with a division--
a profound division

01:19:43.550 --> 01:19:47.270
within the society between
Islamists and a more secular

01:19:47.270 --> 01:19:47.820
model.

01:19:47.820 --> 01:19:50.960
And Libya's in a terrible
state today and people

01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:55.040
are suffering the
consequences of what

01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:58.100
amounts to a civil war, a
low-grade civil war with ISIS

01:19:58.100 --> 01:20:00.290
also now at the foothold.

01:20:00.290 --> 01:20:02.607
I think the challenge--
and I'm reckoning

01:20:02.607 --> 01:20:04.190
with this along with
everything else--

01:20:04.190 --> 01:20:08.150
is knowing what we
knew on the front end.

01:20:08.150 --> 01:20:10.520
All we knew was what we knew.

01:20:10.520 --> 01:20:12.752
And we knew also--

01:20:12.752 --> 01:20:14.210
there are other
people in line also

01:20:14.210 --> 01:20:15.501
who are going to want to speak.

01:20:15.501 --> 01:20:19.940
But in the wake of
800,000 people getting

01:20:19.940 --> 01:20:23.510
killed in Rwanda, given
how explicit Gaddafi was.

01:20:23.510 --> 01:20:26.210
And given what I really
do believe to be the case,

01:20:26.210 --> 01:20:29.990
which is had we not--

01:20:29.990 --> 01:20:32.180
what you would
have, I believe, is

01:20:32.180 --> 01:20:35.390
the massacre, which would
have been pretty ugly.

01:20:35.390 --> 01:20:36.440
But no one will know.

01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:36.910
It's a counterfactual.

01:20:36.910 --> 01:20:38.660
I have no idea how bad
it would have been.

01:20:38.660 --> 01:20:40.493
Maybe it would have
been better than Gaddafi

01:20:40.493 --> 01:20:42.780
himself was saying
he wanted to make it.

01:20:42.780 --> 01:20:46.344
And you would not have Libya
of the pre-revolution Libya.

01:20:46.344 --> 01:20:48.260
It's not like you'd have
a stable Libya today.

01:20:48.260 --> 01:20:49.040
Look at Syria.

01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:51.450
There's an example
of no intervention.

01:20:51.450 --> 01:20:54.290
And is that a stable place
where those kinds of divisions--

01:20:54.290 --> 01:20:55.970
- All kinds of
intervention in Syria.

01:20:55.970 --> 01:20:56.480
- I'm sorry?

01:20:56.480 --> 01:20:57.950
- There's all kinds
of intervention

01:20:57.950 --> 01:20:59.900
in Syria, direct and proxy.

01:20:59.900 --> 01:21:03.724
In the UNSC 1973 did not
call for regime change.

01:21:03.724 --> 01:21:05.890
You can't cite anywhere
where it said regime change.

01:21:05.890 --> 01:21:06.260
The AU--

01:21:06.260 --> 01:21:08.000
- But for all neccessary
measures to protect civilians.

01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:08.485
- The AU--

01:21:08.485 --> 01:21:09.470
- OK, I think I've given
you the best answer I can.

01:21:09.470 --> 01:21:11.050
- --and the Arab league did
not call for regime change.

01:21:11.050 --> 01:21:11.591
- We're good.

01:21:11.591 --> 01:21:12.650
All right.

01:21:12.650 --> 01:21:13.520
Thanks for coming.

01:21:13.520 --> 01:21:16.000
Hope you enjoyed it.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.170
- Hi, I'm Robert Cooper.

01:21:18.170 --> 01:21:21.650
I love that photo of all
the male Secretaries-General

01:21:21.650 --> 01:21:22.570
of the UN.

01:21:22.570 --> 01:21:25.700
And I wondered if you have any
comment on the last selection

01:21:25.700 --> 01:21:29.450
process where there were several
qualified women candidates.

01:21:29.450 --> 01:21:31.700
My personal favorite,
since I'm from New Zealand,

01:21:31.700 --> 01:21:32.840
would've been Helen Clark.

01:21:32.840 --> 01:21:33.635
But there were
several candidates.

01:21:33.635 --> 01:21:36.150
I wonder if you have any
insights on that process.

01:21:36.150 --> 01:21:40.022
- I have big insights,
because the United States--

01:21:40.022 --> 01:21:41.480
fortunately for
the United States--

01:21:41.480 --> 01:21:43.160
gets to be very central to it.

01:21:43.160 --> 01:21:47.180
And within that process, the 15
members of the Security Council

01:21:47.180 --> 01:21:50.120
choose the successor
to Ban Ki-moon,

01:21:50.120 --> 01:21:53.600
chose the successor
to Ban Ki-moon.

01:21:53.600 --> 01:21:57.130
And because the five
permanent members have a veto,

01:21:57.130 --> 01:22:02.690
well, ultimately, the United
States has more than 1/15,

01:22:02.690 --> 01:22:06.980
probably, of influence
in all of this.

01:22:06.980 --> 01:22:09.800
So this process, for
the very first time,

01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:11.697
was public and transparent.

01:22:11.697 --> 01:22:13.280
And for the first
time, the candidates

01:22:13.280 --> 01:22:16.370
for Secretary-General had to
perform and answer questions

01:22:16.370 --> 01:22:19.640
before the broader membership
of the General Assembly,

01:22:19.640 --> 01:22:24.082
which I will say I did not
think would necessarily--

01:22:24.082 --> 01:22:26.540
I thought it was the right
thing to do, of course, in terms

01:22:26.540 --> 01:22:28.435
of legitimacy and
broader ownership,

01:22:28.435 --> 01:22:29.810
but I didn't
necessarily think it

01:22:29.810 --> 01:22:31.880
would produce a better outcome.

01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:36.530
I thought there'd be a fair
amount of grandstanding and--

01:22:36.530 --> 01:22:37.910
but it really was--

01:22:37.910 --> 01:22:39.320
it really changed the dynamic.

01:22:39.320 --> 01:22:42.380
And it meant that, among
the-- and I forget now--

01:22:42.380 --> 01:22:46.070
I think it was 11
candidates we had,

01:22:46.070 --> 01:22:49.060
more women competed this time--

01:22:49.060 --> 01:22:52.070
I think five or six
women competed--

01:22:52.070 --> 01:22:56.300
than all the prior races for all
the other secretary generalship

01:22:56.300 --> 01:22:57.500
combined.

01:22:57.500 --> 01:23:00.440
So that was the other thing
about making it public

01:23:00.440 --> 01:23:03.350
and having an emphasis on having
a woman Secretary-General.

01:23:03.350 --> 01:23:06.440
There was a group of countries
that was constituted called

01:23:06.440 --> 01:23:09.800
the Friends of a Woman
Secretary-General,

01:23:09.800 --> 01:23:12.470
and really banging the drum
about the importance of having

01:23:12.470 --> 01:23:14.000
a lot of women candidates and--

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:15.560
with the hope that
we would-- we,

01:23:15.560 --> 01:23:18.620
the 15, and specifically
the five permanent,

01:23:18.620 --> 01:23:21.530
would end up with a
woman Secretary-General.

01:23:21.530 --> 01:23:25.250
So these public
debates meant that each

01:23:25.250 --> 01:23:27.500
of these candidates, including
Helen Clark-- everybody

01:23:27.500 --> 01:23:28.490
performed.

01:23:28.490 --> 01:23:34.190
And weirdly, countries as
diverse as Saudi Arabia,

01:23:34.190 --> 01:23:38.000
France, Togo, Thailand--

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:39.620
they all came out
of those sessions

01:23:39.620 --> 01:23:43.430
believing that Guterres
was heads and shoulders--

01:23:43.430 --> 01:23:45.140
or heads and tails,
however you say it--

01:23:45.140 --> 01:23:47.270
above the rest in terms
of his qualification.

01:23:47.270 --> 01:23:51.440
He's a former prime
minister and former head

01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:54.110
of the UN Refugee Agency.

01:23:54.110 --> 01:23:56.300
One of the interesting
things was the main thing

01:23:56.300 --> 01:23:58.508
he had to answer for, he
was very explicit about it--

01:23:58.508 --> 01:23:59.790
he's like, I'm not a woman.

01:23:59.790 --> 01:24:02.630
And I think, basically,
if I weren't running,

01:24:02.630 --> 01:24:06.196
I would think that there should
be a woman Secretary-General.

01:24:06.196 --> 01:24:08.570
But here's what I've done for
women throughout my career.

01:24:08.570 --> 01:24:11.420
And half his cabinet when he
was prime minister was women.

01:24:11.420 --> 01:24:12.980
All of his senior--

01:24:12.980 --> 01:24:15.335
not all.

01:24:15.335 --> 01:24:18.470
I think it was a slim majority
of his senior appointments

01:24:18.470 --> 01:24:21.060
when he was head of the
Refugee Agency were women.

01:24:21.060 --> 01:24:24.290
So he had an account, not
just on appointments, but also

01:24:24.290 --> 01:24:26.870
on policies about what
he had done for women.

01:24:26.870 --> 01:24:30.290
And in the end, while
the United States

01:24:30.290 --> 01:24:32.210
had-- there were more
than one candidate

01:24:32.210 --> 01:24:34.970
that we would have supported
as Secretary-General,

01:24:34.970 --> 01:24:37.460
Guterres was the only one
that we could get all five

01:24:37.460 --> 01:24:39.900
of those countries
to agree upon.

01:24:39.900 --> 01:24:42.500
So a couple of the other women--

01:24:42.500 --> 01:24:45.091
and I'm not going to out my
colleagues on the Security

01:24:45.091 --> 01:24:45.590
Council.

01:24:45.590 --> 01:24:47.048
But a couple of
the other women who

01:24:47.048 --> 01:24:50.090
we thought were
very compelling were

01:24:50.090 --> 01:24:53.587
voted against by permanent
members, which basically--

01:24:53.587 --> 01:24:55.670
so they're [? doomed. ?]
Now, you could say, well,

01:24:55.670 --> 01:24:56.990
does this mean only
the guys are going

01:24:56.990 --> 01:24:58.100
to be the consensus candidates?

01:24:58.100 --> 01:24:58.933
Because these guys--

01:24:58.933 --> 01:25:02.390
I was one of 15-- these
guys casting the ballots.

01:25:02.390 --> 01:25:06.080
I think in this
case what shocked

01:25:06.080 --> 01:25:09.860
me is that Russia was prepared
to live with Guterres, somebody

01:25:09.860 --> 01:25:12.830
who had a record of pushing
for human rights and women's

01:25:12.830 --> 01:25:16.680
rights, very-- just a very
progressive politician.

01:25:16.680 --> 01:25:21.260
But the fact that we actually
had the broader pool and it

01:25:21.260 --> 01:25:22.910
felt like a level--

01:25:22.910 --> 01:25:26.390
I mean, given the record I've
describe, this is hard to say.

01:25:26.390 --> 01:25:28.160
But it felt like
people were being

01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:31.317
judged on the basis of how
they, for instance, answered

01:25:31.317 --> 01:25:32.900
questions about the
Libya intervention

01:25:32.900 --> 01:25:35.045
or answered questions about--

01:25:35.045 --> 01:25:37.700
they weren't asked about
the Armenian Genocide.

01:25:37.700 --> 01:25:40.220
People had to perform and
show their capabilities

01:25:40.220 --> 01:25:43.220
and lay out a program for
what they were going to do.

01:25:43.220 --> 01:25:45.947
And it has to be said, Guterres
is the one now who's going to--

01:25:45.947 --> 01:25:48.530
the Secretary-General is the one
who's going have to deal with

01:25:48.530 --> 01:25:49.029
this--

01:25:49.029 --> 01:25:51.260
the Guardian expose
and all the allegations

01:25:51.260 --> 01:25:53.240
of abuse and harassment.

01:25:53.240 --> 01:25:56.990
But he has also just announced
that, for the first time,

01:25:56.990 --> 01:26:00.384
the senior appointments within
the UN are completely 50/50.

01:26:00.384 --> 01:26:01.550
I think it's-- where's Adam?

01:26:01.550 --> 01:26:02.940
Is it 50-50 or a little more--

01:26:02.940 --> 01:26:07.040
yeah, basically even a
majority, now, of women.

01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:09.870
Ban Ki-moon was very
outspoken on these issues.

01:26:09.870 --> 01:26:12.350
But if you look at the
gap between the words

01:26:12.350 --> 01:26:15.120
and the actual appointments,
there's a big gap.

01:26:15.120 --> 01:26:17.210
So that's an example
of a campaign promise

01:26:17.210 --> 01:26:20.930
that Guterres has already
kept within a year of arriving

01:26:20.930 --> 01:26:22.650
in the job.

01:26:22.650 --> 01:26:24.400
- Hi, first off, I
think it's an honor.

01:26:24.400 --> 01:26:27.140
I didn't think I'd ever
be asking you a question.

01:26:27.140 --> 01:26:28.560
I admire you so much.

01:26:28.560 --> 01:26:29.405
So my question--

01:26:29.405 --> 01:26:30.040
[APPLAUSE]

01:26:30.040 --> 01:26:30.800
- Thank you.

01:26:30.800 --> 01:26:32.180
- I just want to say that--

01:26:32.180 --> 01:26:36.980
and I've read your first book
during my time in undergrad.

01:26:36.980 --> 01:26:39.800
I focused a lot on
the Syrian crisis.

01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:44.240
But my question is about Syria,
specifically President Assad,

01:26:44.240 --> 01:26:46.490
who is a war criminal.

01:26:46.490 --> 01:26:49.130
My question is, will we
ever be able to hold him

01:26:49.130 --> 01:26:50.990
accountable for these attacks?

01:26:50.990 --> 01:26:53.840
And there's now recent reports
that there's other chemical

01:26:53.840 --> 01:26:56.360
attacks happening in eastern--

01:26:56.360 --> 01:26:57.090
is it Ghouta?

01:26:57.090 --> 01:26:57.770
- Ghouta, yeah.

01:26:57.770 --> 01:26:59.600
- Those questions that--

01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:01.910
so really, my question
there is, will there ever

01:27:01.910 --> 01:27:03.490
be a solution there?

01:27:03.490 --> 01:27:05.840
This conflict
continues to happen

01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:08.420
and we're talking
about fighting ISIL.

01:27:08.420 --> 01:27:11.360
But you will not
ultimately, in my opinion,

01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:14.450
defeat ISIL until you
solve the Assad problem.

01:27:14.450 --> 01:27:15.380
So that's my question.

01:27:15.380 --> 01:27:15.890
- Thank you, [INAUDIBLE].

01:27:15.890 --> 01:27:17.390
- But it's such an
honor to be here.

01:27:17.390 --> 01:27:18.530
So thank you.

01:27:18.530 --> 01:27:19.710
- Thank you very much, sir.

01:27:19.710 --> 01:27:21.631
Thank you.

01:27:21.631 --> 01:27:23.630
Let me take your question,
though, in two parts,

01:27:23.630 --> 01:27:25.926
because the first
question was on Assad's

01:27:25.926 --> 01:27:27.800
personal accountability,
and then the second,

01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:33.080
more the structural question
about whether the regime and--

01:27:33.080 --> 01:27:35.360
so first, on accountability,
I mean, right now,

01:27:35.360 --> 01:27:40.340
he's operating with a sense of--
and has been for some time--

01:27:40.340 --> 01:27:43.497
operating with a sense
of great impunity.

01:27:43.497 --> 01:27:45.830
Fundamentally, the economic
sanctions that have been put

01:27:45.830 --> 01:27:49.040
in place, the tools in
the toolbox that are about

01:27:49.040 --> 01:27:51.800
de-legitimation and stigma--

01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:54.230
those just-- those have
had no impact on him.

01:27:54.230 --> 01:27:56.973
Now, whether military force--

01:27:56.973 --> 01:28:01.130
taking to heart the point that
the earlier question addressed,

01:28:01.130 --> 01:28:04.280
which is military force
is a very uncertain tool.

01:28:04.280 --> 01:28:06.920
And you can't deal with
these underlying fissures

01:28:06.920 --> 01:28:08.180
and cleavages in the society.

01:28:08.180 --> 01:28:11.217
So whether that would have made
a difference, we don't know.

01:28:11.217 --> 01:28:12.800
And that's, again,
something I'm going

01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:15.292
to have to grapple with in
the book that I'm writing

01:28:15.292 --> 01:28:17.750
and President Obama himself is
grappling with in the memoir

01:28:17.750 --> 01:28:20.030
that he's writing.

01:28:20.030 --> 01:28:22.550
But we tried--

01:28:22.550 --> 01:28:24.620
I tried, when I was
ambassador, to bring

01:28:24.620 --> 01:28:27.860
an international criminal
court referral to the Security

01:28:27.860 --> 01:28:30.110
Council, because that's
when-- since Assad's not going

01:28:30.110 --> 01:28:34.060
to refer himself, and because
Syria is not a state party,

01:28:34.060 --> 01:28:35.877
the court has no
jurisdiction to say, hey,

01:28:35.877 --> 01:28:38.210
there's a guy running a country
who's killing his people

01:28:38.210 --> 01:28:39.650
and gassing these people.

01:28:39.650 --> 01:28:41.660
So I tried that
and Russia vetoed

01:28:41.660 --> 01:28:45.050
it, one of a half-dozen
vetoes that Russia

01:28:45.050 --> 01:28:49.940
extended on Syria while I
was at the Security Council.

01:28:49.940 --> 01:28:53.210
And so it's tempting, in
the wake of that, to think,

01:28:53.210 --> 01:28:55.130
he's got Russia and
Iran behind him.

01:28:55.130 --> 01:28:57.719
He's winning on the battlefield.

01:28:57.719 --> 01:29:00.260
Military force is not going to
be employed, which is the one,

01:29:00.260 --> 01:29:02.180
maybe, coercive tool
that hasn't been tried.

01:29:02.180 --> 01:29:04.470
Maybe it could
make a difference.

01:29:04.470 --> 01:29:07.520
And so this guy is--

01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:08.705
whatever, home free.

01:29:10.766 --> 01:29:12.140
There's not a lot
of history that

01:29:12.140 --> 01:29:14.660
cuts in that
direction, which isn't

01:29:14.660 --> 01:29:16.970
to say that tomorrow
there's going

01:29:16.970 --> 01:29:21.200
to be some big turn
of fortune for him.

01:29:21.200 --> 01:29:25.310
My first career, as I
mentioned, was in the Balkans.

01:29:25.310 --> 01:29:28.490
And if you had told me
when I left to come here

01:29:28.490 --> 01:29:31.790
to go to law school here
that Slobodan Milosevic

01:29:31.790 --> 01:29:35.630
would end up in prison by the
International Criminal Tribunal

01:29:35.630 --> 01:29:39.440
for Yugoslavia, or Ratko Mladic,
who just seemed invulnerable

01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:41.030
in very similar ways--

01:29:41.030 --> 01:29:43.010
and again, very different
set of circumstances.

01:29:43.010 --> 01:29:45.093
NATO did get involved on
the ground in Yugoslavia.

01:29:45.093 --> 01:29:46.460
That made a big difference.

01:29:46.460 --> 01:29:51.260
But what tends to happen,
even in countries where you

01:29:51.260 --> 01:29:53.720
don't have something like
you had in the Balkans,

01:29:53.720 --> 01:30:00.080
is just the infighting
and the rivalries within

01:30:00.080 --> 01:30:03.540
the administration itself
combined with what we have now,

01:30:03.540 --> 01:30:05.490
which we didn't have
initially back then,

01:30:05.490 --> 01:30:09.800
which is the documentation and
the preservation of evidence, ,

01:30:09.800 --> 01:30:13.730
means that it is less likely
to be a foreign plucking

01:30:13.730 --> 01:30:16.790
or imposition of something and
more likely to be some kind

01:30:16.790 --> 01:30:18.840
of internal fissure
at some point.

01:30:18.840 --> 01:30:21.240
But that's not very
satisfying to people who are--

01:30:21.240 --> 01:30:22.850
have been victims.

01:30:22.850 --> 01:30:25.940
400,000, 500,000 people
have been killed,

01:30:25.940 --> 01:30:29.120
it looks like, in Syria, as
you say, the gas attacks,

01:30:29.120 --> 01:30:33.110
this genie out of the
bottle that we thought

01:30:33.110 --> 01:30:37.130
was squarely sealed in there
from the time of Saddam

01:30:37.130 --> 01:30:39.530
Hussein.

01:30:39.530 --> 01:30:41.720
So the larger
question before one

01:30:41.720 --> 01:30:46.100
could even imagine this
infighting or Assad meeting

01:30:46.100 --> 01:30:48.560
his political demise and
then potentially getting

01:30:48.560 --> 01:30:52.970
extradited to face
justice is the question

01:30:52.970 --> 01:30:55.970
of a political solution to
what's happening in Syria.

01:30:55.970 --> 01:30:59.850
And Liz mentioned
The Final Year,

01:30:59.850 --> 01:31:03.170
this movie that has just come
out about Obama's last year

01:31:03.170 --> 01:31:08.120
where Obama and his team granted
almost full access, basically,

01:31:08.120 --> 01:31:09.800
to a team of filmmakers.

01:31:09.800 --> 01:31:12.470
And one of the things
that's captured

01:31:12.470 --> 01:31:15.380
in the film that's kind of the
heart of the film is Syria.

01:31:15.380 --> 01:31:18.004
And the efforts that
Secretary Kerry made are--

01:31:18.004 --> 01:31:19.670
because it only
captures the final year,

01:31:19.670 --> 01:31:21.128
it only shows him
in the final year

01:31:21.128 --> 01:31:26.420
to get Russia, Iran, the
Europeans, the Arabs, the Gulf

01:31:26.420 --> 01:31:28.670
Arabs, everybody
under the same tent

01:31:28.670 --> 01:31:30.770
to try to put enough
pressure on the opposition

01:31:30.770 --> 01:31:32.210
and on the regime.

01:31:32.210 --> 01:31:34.970
And when you see this
film, I mean, there are--

01:31:34.970 --> 01:31:37.900
if nothing else, it'll just
make you love John Kerry.

01:31:37.900 --> 01:31:41.407
You see him, at times,
staggering up the stairs,

01:31:41.407 --> 01:31:43.990
just so exhausted because he's
been going from a Yemen meeting

01:31:43.990 --> 01:31:49.340
to a Paris climate meeting,
Cuba normalization, Syria.

01:31:49.340 --> 01:31:51.680
And again, it's A for effort.

01:31:51.680 --> 01:31:53.270
But none of us--

01:31:53.270 --> 01:31:56.150
we didn't get the
results that we wanted.

01:31:56.150 --> 01:31:58.600
And yet, the one way
I know we will not

01:31:58.600 --> 01:32:02.120
have a solution for Syria is for
none of that effort to occur.

01:32:02.120 --> 01:32:05.500
And that's the world
we're in now, where--

01:32:05.500 --> 01:32:08.020
the way international
diplomacy works for now,

01:32:08.020 --> 01:32:11.050
before China begins
to flex its muscles,

01:32:11.050 --> 01:32:13.360
as it will at some
point in these areas--

01:32:13.360 --> 01:32:15.430
but it's like a pickup--

01:32:15.430 --> 01:32:16.870
it's like pickup basketball.

01:32:16.870 --> 01:32:21.040
Someone is picking people and
pulling them into the tent

01:32:21.040 --> 01:32:23.530
and putting forward
political agreements.

01:32:23.530 --> 01:32:27.070
We have a military, a tactical
approach to defeating ISIS.

01:32:27.070 --> 01:32:30.186
As you said, we have
nothing, as the United States

01:32:30.186 --> 01:32:31.810
or the broader
international community,

01:32:31.810 --> 01:32:34.004
aimed at getting at the
underlying causes of ISIS.

01:32:34.004 --> 01:32:35.170
And that just has to change.

01:32:35.170 --> 01:32:37.150
And I'm hopeful-- the
only hope I have is

01:32:37.150 --> 01:32:43.394
that our military, which has
performed so ably in achieving

01:32:43.394 --> 01:32:45.310
this very important
tactical victory of ending

01:32:45.310 --> 01:32:47.810
the caliphate, in
my experience--

01:32:47.810 --> 01:32:50.560
and the same Chairman
of the Joint Staff today

01:32:50.560 --> 01:32:53.279
was the one that we had,
Joe Dunford, who's superb.

01:32:53.279 --> 01:32:54.820
But in my experience
in the situation

01:32:54.820 --> 01:32:57.028
we're in, whether on Libya
or Syria or anything else,

01:32:57.028 --> 01:32:59.740
it's the military saying,
where's the governance?

01:32:59.740 --> 01:33:02.050
How are we going to
deal with the underlying

01:33:02.050 --> 01:33:04.900
causes of why people went
into ISIS in the first place?

01:33:04.900 --> 01:33:07.060
Because they know
it's just whack-a-mole

01:33:07.060 --> 01:33:08.590
with military force alone.

01:33:08.590 --> 01:33:10.364
And so maybe that's
the-- the tail will

01:33:10.364 --> 01:33:13.030
wag the dog eventually and we'll
start to get some diplomacy out

01:33:13.030 --> 01:33:14.360
of this administration.

01:33:14.360 --> 01:33:17.119
- --ask their questions because
we're going to have to--

01:33:17.119 --> 01:33:17.660
- No problem.

01:33:17.660 --> 01:33:19.243
- Just hear their
questions and then--

01:33:19.243 --> 01:33:21.280
- Yeah, I'll take
all your questions

01:33:21.280 --> 01:33:23.430
and I'll write down
my yes/no answers.

01:33:25.950 --> 01:33:29.209
- Hi, Liam deClive-Lowe,
aspiring political organizer

01:33:29.209 --> 01:33:31.500
and undergraduate student
here at the Harvard Extension

01:33:31.500 --> 01:33:32.610
School.

01:33:32.610 --> 01:33:36.579
In your presentation, you
talked about this surge

01:33:36.579 --> 01:33:38.370
in candidates, especially
women candidates,

01:33:38.370 --> 01:33:39.840
who are now running for office.

01:33:39.840 --> 01:33:42.200
And obviously, in
those elections,

01:33:42.200 --> 01:33:45.390
foreign policy's an
enormously complex issue

01:33:45.390 --> 01:33:48.060
that has a huge impact on
the way that people vote.

01:33:48.060 --> 01:33:50.190
So based on your
experience, what

01:33:50.190 --> 01:33:52.740
is your advice to this
new slew of candidates

01:33:52.740 --> 01:33:55.860
about how to talk about foreign
policy on the campaign trail?

01:33:55.860 --> 01:33:57.480
And number two, do
you have any plans

01:33:57.480 --> 01:34:00.060
to join those ranks of
candidates as one yourself,

01:34:00.060 --> 01:34:02.430
potentially, in the future?

01:34:02.430 --> 01:34:05.070
- I did until that
guy scared me off.

01:34:05.070 --> 01:34:07.830
I thought I--

01:34:07.830 --> 01:34:09.120
- My name's [INAUDIBLE].

01:34:09.120 --> 01:34:10.980
I'm a woman in tech.

01:34:10.980 --> 01:34:13.110
And the work that
you're doing in terms

01:34:13.110 --> 01:34:17.130
of emphasizing the importance
of women in various roles

01:34:17.130 --> 01:34:18.479
is super critical.

01:34:18.479 --> 01:34:20.520
You've been personally a
great role model for me,

01:34:20.520 --> 01:34:21.686
whether you meant it or not.

01:34:21.686 --> 01:34:23.320
So it's great to be here.

01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:25.330
My question for you
is about the comment

01:34:25.330 --> 01:34:28.980
you made at the end regarding
truth and facts, which has

01:34:28.980 --> 01:34:31.021
been such a challenge for us.

01:34:31.021 --> 01:34:33.270
I do think it's the biggest
risk for democracy for us.

01:34:33.270 --> 01:34:36.270
What are your thoughts
regarding the responsibility

01:34:36.270 --> 01:34:38.310
that tech companies have?

01:34:38.310 --> 01:34:40.620
And what's the role
of government in that?

01:34:40.620 --> 01:34:41.460
Thank you so much.

01:34:41.460 --> 01:34:42.376
- Thank you very much.

01:34:45.050 --> 01:34:46.100
- Hi, thank you.

01:34:46.100 --> 01:34:46.980
My name is Guy.

01:34:46.980 --> 01:34:49.520
I'm a genocide
survivor from Darfur.

01:34:49.520 --> 01:34:51.770
Before coming to America,
I lived in Israel

01:34:51.770 --> 01:34:53.670
also for five years.

01:34:53.670 --> 01:34:57.620
And then I'm currently an asylum
seeker in the United States.

01:34:57.620 --> 01:34:59.700
Thank you for your
magnificent contribution

01:34:59.700 --> 01:35:02.150
to this global society.

01:35:02.150 --> 01:35:07.190
My question is, America has
contributed to the world

01:35:07.190 --> 01:35:10.820
so much, but we still
have our problems.

01:35:10.820 --> 01:35:13.670
I have some
classmates that I ask.

01:35:13.670 --> 01:35:16.490
And your thoughts on
America's contribution

01:35:16.490 --> 01:35:19.370
to the global society makes
them a little bit uncomfortable

01:35:19.370 --> 01:35:24.350
because they feel like
they have given so much.

01:35:24.350 --> 01:35:28.850
What is a better way
that we can do and stop

01:35:28.850 --> 01:35:33.170
all these crises that are
happening outside America?

01:35:33.170 --> 01:35:38.540
And also, where America stands
today, and the crises that

01:35:38.540 --> 01:35:40.250
are happening in
Libya, the slave

01:35:40.250 --> 01:35:43.770
trade and torture
that is happening--

01:35:43.770 --> 01:35:45.080
I don't know if you saw it.

01:35:45.080 --> 01:35:46.910
Yesterday it was on the news.

01:35:49.242 --> 01:35:50.700
I don't want to
take too much time.

01:35:50.700 --> 01:35:53.960
But for also the
international community--

01:35:53.960 --> 01:35:56.030
the International
Criminal Court, the ICC,

01:35:56.030 --> 01:35:58.750
has issued a
warrant for arrest--

01:35:58.750 --> 01:36:01.790
to arrest al-Bashir,
the president of Sudan.

01:36:01.790 --> 01:36:06.500
But these guys are still
moving from country to country.

01:36:06.500 --> 01:36:09.970
Who is responsible
in implementing

01:36:09.970 --> 01:36:12.020
the court order of the ICC?

01:36:12.020 --> 01:36:12.750
Thank you.

01:36:12.750 --> 01:36:13.500
Thank you so much.

01:36:16.080 --> 01:36:17.130
Hi, I'm Hans Schattle.

01:36:17.130 --> 01:36:19.290
I teach in the political
science department

01:36:19.290 --> 01:36:21.660
at Yonsei University
in Seoul, South Korea.

01:36:21.660 --> 01:36:24.150
But New England's my
home, so it's really nice

01:36:24.150 --> 01:36:25.930
to see you here in person.

01:36:25.930 --> 01:36:27.780
I followed your
career trajectory back

01:36:27.780 --> 01:36:29.170
in the early 1990s.

01:36:29.170 --> 01:36:31.920
I was working as a news
reporter locally at the time

01:36:31.920 --> 01:36:33.197
here in Massachusetts.

01:36:33.197 --> 01:36:35.280
And it was really something
to see your dispatches

01:36:35.280 --> 01:36:39.600
in the Boston Globe during the
Bosnian War, and of course,

01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:41.130
everything that's followed.

01:36:41.130 --> 01:36:44.550
One of my big frustrations
in international relations

01:36:44.550 --> 01:36:47.100
is that we talk so much
about balance of power,

01:36:47.100 --> 01:36:51.300
and understandably so, but
we give correspondingly

01:36:51.300 --> 01:36:55.410
little airtime to the idea
of balancing responsibility.

01:36:55.410 --> 01:36:58.917
So I'm wondering, in your years
in government, and especially

01:36:58.917 --> 01:37:00.750
at the United Nations
in the last few years,

01:37:00.750 --> 01:37:05.070
did you come away from that
time with any new insights that

01:37:05.070 --> 01:37:08.490
could inspire us a little bit
about how we might think more

01:37:08.490 --> 01:37:11.310
comprehensively,
maybe holistically,

01:37:11.310 --> 01:37:13.680
about how to manage
responsibilities

01:37:13.680 --> 01:37:17.100
on issues, global warming,
migrants, refugees?

01:37:17.100 --> 01:37:19.830
We could, of course, talk
about R2P and the difficulty

01:37:19.830 --> 01:37:22.590
in rehabilitating that
concept after Libya.

01:37:22.590 --> 01:37:25.920
I mean, IR now is so much
bigger than just diplomacy,

01:37:25.920 --> 01:37:27.030
foreign ministries.

01:37:27.030 --> 01:37:28.740
We have corporations.

01:37:28.740 --> 01:37:32.190
Look at Davos this week, NGOs,
schools and universities,

01:37:32.190 --> 01:37:34.870
churches, everyday
citizens on Twitter.

01:37:34.870 --> 01:37:35.370
And

01:37:35.370 --> 01:37:36.870
There's so much out
there and I feel

01:37:36.870 --> 01:37:39.300
as if there's a lot of work
in the field that's still

01:37:39.300 --> 01:37:41.400
ahead of us in terms
of consolidating

01:37:41.400 --> 01:37:44.310
our thinking about how
we can solve problems

01:37:44.310 --> 01:37:46.980
more effectively that
transcend nation states.

01:37:46.980 --> 01:37:48.720
And of course, the UN is our--

01:37:48.720 --> 01:37:51.510
it's the best venue we've
got, but it only goes so far.

01:37:51.510 --> 01:37:53.560
So any thoughts on that
would be really great.

01:37:53.560 --> 01:37:54.060
Great.

01:37:54.060 --> 01:37:56.310
Thank you.

01:37:56.310 --> 01:37:58.871
Great, OK.

01:37:58.871 --> 01:37:59.370
Wonderful.

01:37:59.370 --> 01:37:59.953
Thank you all.

01:37:59.953 --> 01:38:03.500
And thanks for staying
through all of this.

01:38:03.500 --> 01:38:05.376
It's OK if you
have to leave, too.

01:38:09.610 --> 01:38:12.580
So first, for the aspiring
political organizer--

01:38:12.580 --> 01:38:15.760
Liam, I think you
said your name was--

01:38:15.760 --> 01:38:17.770
we learned yesterday
at Radcliffe,

01:38:17.770 --> 01:38:23.410
through-- or two days ago
at Radcliffe that only 24%

01:38:23.410 --> 01:38:27.070
of eligible Harvard students
had voted in the midterm

01:38:27.070 --> 01:38:32.110
election in 2014.

01:38:32.110 --> 01:38:35.680
Aspiring political organizer,
there's a task for you.

01:38:35.680 --> 01:38:37.900
Why don't we all chip
in and figure out

01:38:37.900 --> 01:38:42.520
how we can get that up just
way, way higher, as something

01:38:42.520 --> 01:38:45.499
we can do in the here and now?

01:38:45.499 --> 01:38:48.040
But your question was about how
to talk about foreign policy.

01:38:48.040 --> 01:38:54.970
And I guess I would
acknowledge that we have-- we,

01:38:54.970 --> 01:38:57.430
the Obama administration,
did not crack that code,

01:38:57.430 --> 01:38:59.230
it's fair to say.

01:38:59.230 --> 01:39:02.200
The fact that we now
have not only the Trump

01:39:02.200 --> 01:39:05.380
base with "America
First" and this kind

01:39:05.380 --> 01:39:10.000
of discredited
political ideology

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:13.510
that has lived within our
political ecosystem for more

01:39:13.510 --> 01:39:18.200
than a hundred years, but the
fact that that is now governing

01:39:18.200 --> 01:39:21.760
and that we're pulling out
of the kinds of things that

01:39:21.760 --> 01:39:24.220
put my world view to
one side, but just

01:39:24.220 --> 01:39:28.480
as a matter of
pragmatism, are needed,

01:39:28.480 --> 01:39:31.720
whether on climate or
on terrorism, alienating

01:39:31.720 --> 01:39:34.450
our allies or
insulting our allies,

01:39:34.450 --> 01:39:37.810
and thus really
jeopardizing our ability

01:39:37.810 --> 01:39:39.380
to call on them
when we need them,

01:39:39.380 --> 01:39:41.755
whether in the context of
international framework or even

01:39:41.755 --> 01:39:42.680
just bilaterally.

01:39:42.680 --> 01:39:47.020
So the fact that it's on
the left and the right--

01:39:47.020 --> 01:39:49.405
and I'm not a believer
in false equivalence,

01:39:49.405 --> 01:39:51.280
because only one party
is governing and doing

01:39:51.280 --> 01:39:52.610
these things.

01:39:52.610 --> 01:39:59.140
But the left wing of
the Democratic Party

01:39:59.140 --> 01:40:00.940
is not very enthusiastic about--

01:40:00.940 --> 01:40:02.800
or some of them,
anyway, are not very

01:40:02.800 --> 01:40:06.250
enthusiastic about the
kinds of investments

01:40:06.250 --> 01:40:09.340
in our national security,
whether in the form

01:40:09.340 --> 01:40:12.100
of our military or our
diplomacy or in terms

01:40:12.100 --> 01:40:13.490
of international engagements.

01:40:13.490 --> 01:40:16.970
And so this-- these
wings are very different.

01:40:16.970 --> 01:40:20.410
And one has a much
more inclusive model

01:40:20.410 --> 01:40:22.600
and doesn't have the
xenophobia and racism

01:40:22.600 --> 01:40:23.720
or any of that stuff.

01:40:23.720 --> 01:40:27.310
But in terms of the
belief of the balance

01:40:27.310 --> 01:40:30.040
between the domestic
enterprise and all

01:40:30.040 --> 01:40:36.280
that is left to be done here
at home and what we do abroad,

01:40:36.280 --> 01:40:40.060
there ends up being an overlap,
at times, in prescription.

01:40:40.060 --> 01:40:41.800
So that worries me a lot.

01:40:41.800 --> 01:40:45.670
And on communications,
I've talked

01:40:45.670 --> 01:40:51.220
to some of my favorite members
of Congress about this.

01:40:51.220 --> 01:40:53.920
We have to find a way
to talk about climate

01:40:53.920 --> 01:40:56.920
that feels relevant to
people's lives here.

01:40:56.920 --> 01:40:59.410
And it won't be by talking
about the Paris Agreement.

01:40:59.410 --> 01:41:03.790
And some people ask me
sometimes about my book

01:41:03.790 --> 01:41:05.860
and is there a thesis
undergirding it.

01:41:05.860 --> 01:41:08.020
And the only thing I can
tell you is I will not--

01:41:08.020 --> 01:41:09.700
the words "liberal
international order"

01:41:09.700 --> 01:41:11.440
will not appear in my book.

01:41:11.440 --> 01:41:16.430
I aspire in telling
stories to reach people.

01:41:16.430 --> 01:41:20.530
Yes, that is my
unconcealed worldview,

01:41:20.530 --> 01:41:22.690
is that we have to invest
in our common security

01:41:22.690 --> 01:41:24.310
and our common humanity.

01:41:24.310 --> 01:41:26.129
But I've got to
find a way and we've

01:41:26.129 --> 01:41:27.670
got to find a way
to communicate that

01:41:27.670 --> 01:41:33.580
in a manner that's accessible
beyond our like-minded cohort.

01:41:33.580 --> 01:41:35.660
So I don't have a great answer.

01:41:35.660 --> 01:41:40.670
But I think this question
of how to communicate,

01:41:40.670 --> 01:41:43.090
how to talk about foreign
policy is really important.

01:41:43.090 --> 01:41:45.100
And we went through
this on Ebola.

01:41:45.100 --> 01:41:47.050
One thing President
Obama did, which

01:41:47.050 --> 01:41:49.000
I really admired
at the time, but I

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:52.390
think has to be
supplemented, is people

01:41:52.390 --> 01:41:54.790
were in full-on panic in
this country about Ebola.

01:41:54.790 --> 01:41:57.100
You remember when patient
Duncan died in Texas

01:41:57.100 --> 01:41:59.260
and some of the
nurses got infected.

01:41:59.260 --> 01:42:02.500
And the polling was horrific,
even in democratic districts,

01:42:02.500 --> 01:42:04.992
of people wanting
to close our doors

01:42:04.992 --> 01:42:07.450
and not even let health workers
come back into this country

01:42:07.450 --> 01:42:09.619
or to quarantine them
when they came back in.

01:42:09.619 --> 01:42:11.410
And this was at a time
where more Americans

01:42:11.410 --> 01:42:16.300
had married Kardashians than
had died of Ebola, right?

01:42:16.300 --> 01:42:17.920
And so President
Obama didn't say

01:42:17.920 --> 01:42:19.990
what I just said, which would--

01:42:19.990 --> 01:42:22.330
of course, you're not going to--

01:42:22.330 --> 01:42:25.210
I went to West Africa in the
middle of the Ebola crisis.

01:42:25.210 --> 01:42:25.900
I was scared.

01:42:25.900 --> 01:42:27.490
I mean, fear is--

01:42:27.490 --> 01:42:31.870
it's a legitimate thing
that one can feel.

01:42:31.870 --> 01:42:37.090
But how to meet people
where they are and--

01:42:37.090 --> 01:42:42.100
if you just, whether on
terrorism, refugees, Ebola,

01:42:42.100 --> 01:42:46.150
climate-- if you just cite
statistics for people,

01:42:46.150 --> 01:42:48.020
a lot of people,
that's good enough.

01:42:48.020 --> 01:42:51.850
But there's a group that
aren't-- the Trump base,

01:42:51.850 --> 01:42:53.690
but of people who
can be convinced,

01:42:53.690 --> 01:42:56.500
but whom we have not
brought into the fold,

01:42:56.500 --> 01:42:59.650
for whom statistics and just
the facts aren't meeting them

01:42:59.650 --> 01:43:02.170
viscerally where they are when
they are feeling those fears,

01:43:02.170 --> 01:43:03.880
which of course
are stoked, then,

01:43:03.880 --> 01:43:06.520
by people who shouldn't
be-- who should know better.

01:43:06.520 --> 01:43:10.190
In terms of tech companies, let
me-- let me just acknowledge,

01:43:10.190 --> 01:43:15.620
I think, the importance of the
question in the following way.

01:43:15.620 --> 01:43:18.000
People ask us about the
Russia interference,

01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:19.970
which I'm surprised
I haven't been asked

01:43:19.970 --> 01:43:22.375
about, and with good reason.

01:43:22.375 --> 01:43:24.000
And they ask, should
we have done more?

01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:27.170
And should Obama have come out
and not just the intelligence

01:43:27.170 --> 01:43:28.640
agencies before the election?

01:43:28.640 --> 01:43:30.052
And all the rest and--

01:43:30.052 --> 01:43:32.510
we're all going to be asking
ourselves questions about what

01:43:32.510 --> 01:43:33.801
we might have done differently.

01:43:33.801 --> 01:43:39.900
But one thing I just want
to convey is when we--

01:43:39.900 --> 01:43:44.510
so cyber security and cyber
threats by foreign nations

01:43:44.510 --> 01:43:47.270
is something that we have
developed over the last decade,

01:43:47.270 --> 01:43:50.240
plus an infrastructure within
the US national security

01:43:50.240 --> 01:43:52.610
establishment to deal with,
Department of Justice,

01:43:52.610 --> 01:43:54.860
Department of Homeland
Security, Defense Department,

01:43:54.860 --> 01:43:57.530
intelligence in terms
of who's doing what.

01:43:57.530 --> 01:43:59.930
When it comes to
fake news and ad

01:43:59.930 --> 01:44:03.350
buys and your-- the
de-centralized world

01:44:03.350 --> 01:44:07.820
of your existence and
other citizens' existence,

01:44:07.820 --> 01:44:10.370
whether here or
anywhere else, there's

01:44:10.370 --> 01:44:12.920
no obvious government lever.

01:44:12.920 --> 01:44:15.920
And that's why this
conversation that's

01:44:15.920 --> 01:44:19.430
happening in Silicon Valley, as
unsatisfying as I have found it

01:44:19.430 --> 01:44:22.010
up to this point, really
is a conversation that

01:44:22.010 --> 01:44:24.614
should have been happening
four or five years ago.

01:44:24.614 --> 01:44:26.030
And we should have
done everything

01:44:26.030 --> 01:44:27.946
in our power-- we should
have done more to try

01:44:27.946 --> 01:44:30.890
to catalyze that conversation.

01:44:30.890 --> 01:44:34.250
But fundamentally, it's going to
be on that community of people

01:44:34.250 --> 01:44:36.170
to make things happen.

01:44:36.170 --> 01:44:39.620
And then I just merged
the last two questions

01:44:39.620 --> 01:44:46.580
because [? Gees' ?] question was
on how to stop crises and share

01:44:46.580 --> 01:44:48.860
burdens better, and then
the other was on balance

01:44:48.860 --> 01:44:51.020
of responsibility,
which I think also

01:44:51.020 --> 01:44:52.807
is another version
of burden-sharing.

01:44:52.807 --> 01:44:54.890
Part of the answer to the
first question about how

01:44:54.890 --> 01:44:57.890
you sell foreign
policy in a broader way

01:44:57.890 --> 01:45:00.830
will entail being able
to better describe

01:45:00.830 --> 01:45:03.500
what the international
order is buying us.

01:45:03.500 --> 01:45:06.110
And Donald Trump has had this
worldview throughout his life.

01:45:06.110 --> 01:45:08.420
He has not changed at all.

01:45:08.420 --> 01:45:11.090
He feels like we are
getting ripped off.

01:45:11.090 --> 01:45:13.290
And he has found something,
again, in his base,

01:45:13.290 --> 01:45:15.410
but also in others
who have supported him

01:45:15.410 --> 01:45:17.750
and now may have--
maybe have melted away.

01:45:17.750 --> 01:45:20.330
But we need to
show-- for instance,

01:45:20.330 --> 01:45:23.780
in my world of UN peacekeeping,
everybody focuses on the fact

01:45:23.780 --> 01:45:28.460
that it's a $8.5 billion budget
for UN peacekeepers, 100,000 UN

01:45:28.460 --> 01:45:31.790
peacekeepers in the world,
and we pay 28% of that.

01:45:31.790 --> 01:45:33.860
They don't focus on
the fact that 72%

01:45:33.860 --> 01:45:35.720
is paid for by other countries.

01:45:35.720 --> 01:45:38.180
And moreover, the troops who
actually are peacekeepers,

01:45:38.180 --> 01:45:41.360
who are risking their lives and
dying at record rates almost

01:45:41.360 --> 01:45:42.830
never come from
the United States.

01:45:42.830 --> 01:45:45.290
We have a tiny
percentage of that.

01:45:45.290 --> 01:45:48.170
Climate, I think we
made good headway.

01:45:48.170 --> 01:45:50.870
But responsibility is something
you hear a lot from the biggest

01:45:50.870 --> 01:45:53.810
emitters, from China and India.

01:45:53.810 --> 01:45:56.450
And their conception
of responsibility

01:45:56.450 --> 01:45:58.689
is historical, which
is really important.

01:45:58.689 --> 01:46:00.480
If you're them, you're
like, wait a minute.

01:46:00.480 --> 01:46:02.230
How can we just start
caring about climate

01:46:02.230 --> 01:46:04.970
when we are now needing coal
in order to develop and deal

01:46:04.970 --> 01:46:06.470
with our growing populations?

01:46:06.470 --> 01:46:08.360
And I think what we
succeeded in doing,

01:46:08.360 --> 01:46:10.910
partly by leveraging the
relationships that Obama had

01:46:10.910 --> 01:46:15.530
built with Xi and with Modi,
is for the first time now

01:46:15.530 --> 01:46:20.180
we have a language about
responsibility that is lateral

01:46:20.180 --> 01:46:24.290
and in the present about
emissions as being what

01:46:24.290 --> 01:46:26.220
dictates your responsibility.

01:46:26.220 --> 01:46:28.190
But we still have to
acknowledge the historical

01:46:28.190 --> 01:46:30.120
and the disparities
and so forth there.

01:46:30.120 --> 01:46:33.890
So I think a lot of creative
thinking needs to be done.

01:46:33.890 --> 01:46:37.760
And the questions that
emphasize language and framing

01:46:37.760 --> 01:46:41.120
are right because we
have to do better.

01:46:41.120 --> 01:46:44.600
If we are going to go
forward and actually

01:46:44.600 --> 01:46:48.410
be able to execute a worldview
that is rooted in the sense

01:46:48.410 --> 01:46:50.690
that we are connected and
that it is in our interests,

01:46:50.690 --> 01:46:53.905
also, to look out for others,
whether at home or abroad,

01:46:53.905 --> 01:46:55.280
we're going to
have to sell that.

01:46:55.280 --> 01:46:55.880
Thank you.

01:46:55.880 --> 01:46:57.980
