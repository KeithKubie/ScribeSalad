00:00:00.959 --> 00:00:02.502
we're here
to wreck something.

00:00:02.502 --> 00:00:04.796
- Yes, yes, absolutely.
- Party, wreck something.

00:00:04.796 --> 00:00:07.507
- I am extremely excited
to smash and cut

00:00:07.507 --> 00:00:09.843
and just completely
obliterate whatever I can.

00:00:09.843 --> 00:00:11.594
I'm here to have fun.
How about you?

00:00:11.594 --> 00:00:14.055
- I'm a fat old man;
I'm supposed to be dead

00:00:14.055 --> 00:00:16.683
32 years ago.
Here I am to party.

00:00:16.683 --> 00:00:18.184
- If I remember correctly,
you told me

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:20.103
you were an extreme
sport athlete.

00:00:20.103 --> 00:00:22.439
- Yeah, I was on
"Forged in Fire."

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:23.732
How about you?

00:00:23.732 --> 00:00:25.442
- Yeah, I did a little
preparation.

00:00:25.442 --> 00:00:27.152
I drank a lot of beer
at The Forge,

00:00:27.152 --> 00:00:29.070
got a lot of good
hammer strikes in.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.780
Yeah.
- [grunts]

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.782
- You do any martial arts
in your past?

00:00:32.782 --> 00:00:35.076
- Uh, well, I used to do
SCA fencing.

00:00:35.076 --> 00:00:36.411
- Used to?
- Used to.

00:00:36.411 --> 00:00:38.955
- Gave that up?
- Yeah, I got fat.

00:00:38.955 --> 00:00:41.708
You got--fencing is for fat,
old guys

00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:42.959
that are mostly dead.

00:00:42.959 --> 00:00:44.753
- Yeah.
- It's nice.

00:00:44.753 --> 00:00:46.546
Never--no heavy stick
fighting?

00:00:46.546 --> 00:00:48.506
- Nah, well, I did that
when I was 15.

00:00:48.506 --> 00:00:50.884
Then I got in a motorcycle
accident, wrecked my knees.

00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:53.428
- You were mostly dead.
- I was mostly dead.

00:00:53.428 --> 00:00:55.305
In many different ways.

00:00:55.305 --> 00:00:57.098
As I said, I look pretty darn
good for a corpse.

00:00:57.098 --> 00:00:58.683
- You look good for a corpse,
yeah.

00:00:58.683 --> 00:01:00.185
- Perambulatin' corpse.

00:01:00.185 --> 00:01:02.228
- Pre-ambulating.
- Per-rambulatin'.

00:01:02.228 --> 00:01:03.980
- Perambulate, that means
you can walk or--

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.106
- That's a fancy word.
- Yeah, that's a fancy word.

00:01:05.106 --> 00:01:06.524
- I went to college and all.

00:01:06.524 --> 00:01:08.276
So what do you normally make?

00:01:08.276 --> 00:01:11.863
- Uh, whatever historically
catches my interest.

00:01:11.863 --> 00:01:13.823
I wanted to learn how to do
socketed spears.

00:01:13.823 --> 00:01:15.408
I probably made--
less than 100,

00:01:15.408 --> 00:01:17.994
but I've made a lot of spears,
all one piece.

00:01:17.994 --> 00:01:20.205
Figure it out, that's what
I like to do.

00:01:20.205 --> 00:01:22.415
- Yeah, I've been doing
mostly historical stuff.

00:01:22.415 --> 00:01:24.083
I did a couple of Viking
wolf's tooth.

00:01:24.083 --> 00:01:26.503
I did a seax
in a wolf's tooth.

00:01:26.503 --> 00:01:29.756
I did a dagger in
a wolf's tooth pattern.

00:01:29.756 --> 00:01:31.007
- Right on.
- Based, actually--

00:01:31.007 --> 00:01:32.467
I got a friend who's got

00:01:32.467 --> 00:01:34.844
a couple of artifact
Viking wolf tooth spears.

00:01:34.844 --> 00:01:36.054
- Cool.

00:01:36.054 --> 00:01:38.223
- So I kinda based that on

00:01:38.223 --> 00:01:41.434
the actual artifacts
I've handled.

00:01:41.434 --> 00:01:43.770
So what do you do
for a day gig?

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.522
- For a day job
instead of blacksmithing

00:01:45.522 --> 00:01:46.523
in the dead of night?

00:01:46.523 --> 00:01:47.857
I'm a correction officer.

00:01:47.857 --> 00:01:49.359
Been doing that for about
17 years.

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:51.361
- So you seen all sorts
of shanks and stuff.

00:01:51.361 --> 00:01:53.154
- I've seen a lot of homemade
weapons, yes.

00:01:53.154 --> 00:01:55.323
Yep, pretty interesting things
that would not

00:01:55.323 --> 00:01:57.075
do well on these
kind of courses,

00:01:57.075 --> 00:01:58.910
but for up close,
personal combat,

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.328
yeah, yeah.

00:02:00.328 --> 00:02:01.746
I train for that, you know.

00:02:01.746 --> 00:02:03.373
If somebody's gonna attack you

00:02:03.373 --> 00:02:05.375
in hand-to-hand kind of
takedown stuff--

00:02:05.375 --> 00:02:08.044
trapping weapons, you know,
gaining the upper hand.

00:02:08.044 --> 00:02:09.921
It might come in handy.
I don't know.

00:02:09.921 --> 00:02:12.382
I'm in okay shape.
I'm not mostly dead.

00:02:12.382 --> 00:02:14.926
One foot in the grave, maybe,
but I'm not mostly dead.

00:02:14.926 --> 00:02:16.719
- I'm a jeweler. [laughs]

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:18.221
I make little shiny things.

00:02:18.221 --> 00:02:19.514
- Jewelry's good. Yeah, yeah.

00:02:19.514 --> 00:02:21.182
Did you make that on
your shirt there?

00:02:21.182 --> 00:02:23.518
- Oh, yeah.
- Nice. Yeah, saw that earlier.

00:02:23.518 --> 00:02:26.646
- Yeah, I work in gold,
silver, bronze,

00:02:26.646 --> 00:02:28.648
high carbon steel.

00:02:28.648 --> 00:02:30.066
- High carbon steel.

00:02:30.066 --> 00:02:32.610
Have you done any cutting
competitions ever?

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.280
- Nope.
- Neither have I. Not a one.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.823
- Nah, I didn't even really
get a chance

00:02:36.823 --> 00:02:37.991
to touch my blade.

00:02:37.991 --> 00:02:39.534
I'm not--here's hoping.
