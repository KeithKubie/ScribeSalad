1
00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.460
So we're studying nuclear fillic substitution as in part,

2
00:00:07.591 --> 00:00:12.570
at least as a means of seeing how one goes about establishing a mechanism,

3
00:00:12.571 --> 00:00:17.460
proving a mechanism.
Uh,
remember that,
uh,

4
00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:22.610
the sn two nuclear fillic substitution has a number of components here and the

5
00:00:23.851 --> 00:00:26.190
logic is to vary them,

6
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.320
see how the rate changes and see if you can disprove some of the mechanisms.

7
00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.070
Uh,
and last time we looked at at,
uh,

8
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.340
at the kinetic order and at stereochemistry and began looking at how the

9
00:00:40.681 --> 00:00:43.410
different components influenced the rate constant.

10
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:45.990
So here we're looking at,

11
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.280
we looked at the end the last time at the nucleophile and saw that it was gave

12
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.340
unusual it what the reactivity with a carbon in the sn two transition state

13
00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.530
didn't seem to parallel the reactivity with the Proton if you want across the

14
00:01:01.531 --> 00:01:04.560
first row it was fine,
but when you went down it looked funny.

15
00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.860
But then we saw that the solvent had something to do with it.

16
00:01:07.861 --> 00:01:09.870
That although in water it looks funny,

17
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.490
it's backwards from what you would expect in acetone.
It sensible.

18
00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:17.790
So we concluded that the solvent makes a difference.
This solvent,

19
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.770
hydrogen bonds in a case of water to the nuclear file,

20
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.090
making it less reactive in the smaller,
a more reactive,

21
00:01:27.091 --> 00:01:30.540
the nucleophile,
the,
the more it deactivates it,

22
00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.530
the stronger the hydrogen bonding.
And you don't have that factor and acetone,

23
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.320
but that's just one example of a solvent.
In fact,

24
00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.490
there's a very general kind of solvent effects where a polar solvent,

25
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.660
uh,
stabilizes ions.
We saw this in the case of water,

26
00:01:45.661 --> 00:01:47.200
the gas phase ions,

27
00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.220
how much they were stabilized by having water come around them in the order of a

28
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.480
hundred kilocalories per mole,
uh,
compared to the gas phase.
Okay?

29
00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:02.870
So whenever you generate ions or increase the localization of charge,

30
00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.920
you get stronger bonding with polar solvents.

31
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:13.400
So polar solvents accelerate reactions that generate or concentrate charge

32
00:02:13.801 --> 00:02:17.280
because they bind more strongly to it.
And vice versa.

33
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.550
If charge is being destroyed in the reaction than a polar solvent will stabilize

34
00:02:23.041 --> 00:02:26.700
the starting materials more than it does the transition state and the reaction

35
00:02:26.701 --> 00:02:30.070
will slow down.
So that's an important,
uh,

36
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.600
consideration in choosing a solvent for a reaction.

37
00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.970
Now let's look at the leaving group.

38
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.050
Fortunately here things make sense.
Uh,
you notice that,
that the,
uh,

39
00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.150
that the stronger the acid that is the more weekly the,
the,

40
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.990
the particular group bonds to a Proton,
the uh,

41
00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.030
the,
uh,
uh,
the better it is as a leaving group.

42
00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.220
That is,
it can give up its bond to carbon.

43
00:03:00.221 --> 00:03:02.560
The same way it gives up its bond to protons.

44
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.450
And there's a strict parallel between how good a nucleophile is and how,

45
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.630
how acidic what it's PKA is.

46
00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:16.230
So weak basis are good leaving groups that is stable and ions form easily or uh,

47
00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:22.180
those that don't hold tightly to h plus don't hold tightly to the carbon in the

48
00:03:22.571 --> 00:03:25.540
transition state of the sn two reaction.

49
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.140
So that makes perfect sense.
Okay,

50
00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.850
now we looked last time at the work of Bartlett and knocks this classic work of

51
00:03:33.851 --> 00:03:38.460
using a bridge head reactivity,
this bridge head chloride in order to,

52
00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.490
to test some possibilities about about,
uh,

53
00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.900
the mechanism of nuclear physics substitution that you can't get at the

54
00:03:46.901 --> 00:03:51.310
backside.
So that's out.
You can't,
uh,
you can't,
uh,

55
00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.570
uh,
form a double bond at the bridge head so you don't have to worry about

56
00:03:55.571 --> 00:03:58.540
elimination and you can't have a non,

57
00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.680
the question is whether you could have a non planar cad ion or whether you could

58
00:04:02.681 --> 00:04:05.110
attack from the front instead of from the back.

59
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:09.520
And by showing that this compound was inert to such substitutions,

60
00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:14.770
they were able to,
uh,
to show that those inferences were correct.

61
00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:20.260
So they specifically designed and prepared this molecule to test these

62
00:04:20.261 --> 00:04:24.070
mechanistic questions.
Incidentally,
since last time I got hold of this,

63
00:04:24.071 --> 00:04:28.780
a picture of Lawrence knocks,
it's his graduation picture from Bates College.

64
00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.880
Uh,
now they hit,
he had to prepare the molecule.

65
00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.970
How did he prepare it?
Because we're,

66
00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.930
what we're saying is it's very difficult to prepare things at the bridge head

67
00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:45.340
because a,
you can't do nuclear affiliate substitution.

68
00:04:45.341 --> 00:04:48.520
That's what their experiment showed.
So how did they do it?

69
00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:51.161
Well,

70
00:04:51.161 --> 00:04:55.570
they started with this mean actually they started with a product that already

71
00:04:55.571 --> 00:05:00.270
had the carboxylate group in there.
Right.
And they converted that to the,

72
00:05:00.271 --> 00:05:04.390
you mean by a reaction we'll discuss later in the semester,

73
00:05:04.391 --> 00:05:07.180
in the last quarter of the semester.

74
00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:10.510
But they had this compound available.

75
00:05:10.511 --> 00:05:15.511
How do they replace Nh two by cl and h two is a crummy leaving group and even a

76
00:05:16.721 --> 00:05:20.980
good grip,
better leaving group like chloride.
Uh,
we,
they,

77
00:05:20.981 --> 00:05:23.860
what they showed was that it doesn't undergo substitution.

78
00:05:23.861 --> 00:05:26.620
So how do you put chloride in,
in place of,

79
00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:28.900
of the Nh two.

80
00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:33.460
You need some fabulous leaving group if you wanted to be able to do something at

81
00:05:33.461 --> 00:05:38.080
the bridge head.
Okay.
So what they did was treat the amine,

82
00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.770
uh,
and notice that the amine itself is not a leaving group.

83
00:05:41.771 --> 00:05:45.610
It's the PKA is 34.
So the higher the PKA,

84
00:05:45.611 --> 00:05:49.110
the worst it is as a leaving group as we just saw a,

85
00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.250
if you protonated it,

86
00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:55.390
it would make it a much better leaving group because protonated Nh three,

87
00:05:55.391 --> 00:05:59.390
the ammonium ion has a pka that's a whatever,

88
00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:02.030
a 25 powers of 10 better.

89
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:06.830
But still that's not nearly good enough to make a bridge head cat ion or to do a

90
00:06:06.831 --> 00:06:08.240
substitution.
At the bridge yet.

91
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:13.940
So what they did was treat the amine with n.
O c l.

92
00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.770
Okay.
Now let's think about how those would react with one another.

93
00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:24.140
What makes the Nh two reactive?
Antonio,
what he say?

94
00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:27.820
<v 1>Yeah,
at the High Homo is</v>

95
00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:33.880
the loan bear on the nitrogen.
So what's it going to attack Antonio?
Keep us going

96
00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:40.120
and,
oh,
okay.
There's a Pi star bond ban,

97
00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:42.740
so it could form a bond to nitrogen.
Uh,

98
00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:47.530
but if you have that negative charge on the oxygen,
that's perfectly good.

99
00:06:47.531 --> 00:06:49.210
And it's almost certainly the way it starts,

100
00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:52.990
but that negative charge can come back in reform on the bond

101
00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:57.250
<v 0>and lose chloride,
which is a good leaving group.
Okay.</v>

102
00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:59.710
So I'm not going to draw the intermediate step.

103
00:06:59.711 --> 00:07:01.900
That would just probably correct that you suggested,

104
00:07:01.901 --> 00:07:04.180
but just say that it displaces the chloride.

105
00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:07.480
It probably is because of the Pi star that does it so easily.

106
00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:10.750
Although it could do it directly.
Okay.

107
00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:15.310
So then we're going to have chloride displaced and a positive charge on this

108
00:07:15.311 --> 00:07:17.710
nitrogen.
What will happen next?

109
00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:21.930
<v 1>Well,
how do you get rid of positive charge is on nitrogen like that?</v>

110
00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:30.160
Well,
we need here we have an eye on

111
00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:32.170
<v 0>generally there are other things around that.</v>

112
00:07:32.171 --> 00:07:36.070
We'll take that that are better at having positive charge than this.

113
00:07:36.071 --> 00:07:39.400
Can you think of some way you can get rid of that positive charge?

114
00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:48.830
<v 1>What did we just say about the protonated nitrogen?
Remember number,</v>

115
00:07:48.831 --> 00:07:53.360
it's PKA is nine.
It's 25 powers of 10 easier.

116
00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:58.940
Better as a leaving group.
Then that is to give up a proton.

117
00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:00.100
Then

118
00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:04.300
<v 0>Nh three is to give up a proton and form Nh.
Two minus.</v>

119
00:08:04.301 --> 00:08:06.190
It's much better to have an h.

120
00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:10.720
Three is the leaving group try Vaillant nitrogen rather than the an island.

121
00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:15.370
So it's acidic.
It gives up a proton.
Good.

122
00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:20.110
Okay.
Now what would the next thing you need to do to get toward the product?

123
00:08:20.111 --> 00:08:25.111
I mean obviously this particular reaction wasn't figured out on paper by saying

124
00:08:25.391 --> 00:08:26.141
what's the whole ball,

125
00:08:26.141 --> 00:08:29.050
what's the Lumo and saw and they mixed it and found out what happened.

126
00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:31.390
But we can predict what's going to happen.
And,

127
00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:35.680
but fortunately I have some insight into what does happen.

128
00:08:35.681 --> 00:08:37.570
So I know what has to happen next.

129
00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:42.040
What you have to do is have what's called an Al Lilly rearrangement,

130
00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:46.890
where you shift the double bond and the age.
So the h goes from end to,

131
00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:50.140
oh,
the double bond goes between the two ends,

132
00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:54.040
right from one end to the other of a three Adam Alec system.

133
00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:57.060
Okay?
Now how do we go about that?

134
00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:01.560
Well first we can put the Proton and unshared pair of oxygen.
That's pretty easy,

135
00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:03.083
right?

136
00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:07.290
And now there's a resonance structure of that involving the unshared pair on

137
00:09:07.291 --> 00:09:09.090
nitrogen again,
right?

138
00:09:09.091 --> 00:09:13.070
So we can go in and the double bond can put the,
the,

139
00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:17.640
the Pi electrons can go onto oxygen in the resonance structure we're talking

140
00:09:17.641 --> 00:09:21.990
about.
So now we've done the elderly rearrangement,

141
00:09:21.991 --> 00:09:26.220
except it's still got a positive charge on the nitrogen for what do you do now

142
00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:29.620
<v 1>to get rid of the positive charge on the nitrogen?</v>

143
00:09:31.390 --> 00:09:33.690
Is the Proton again.

144
00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:40.070
<v 0>Okay,
now you do the same thing again.
Watch this.</v>

145
00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:44.240
So you've protonate protonate the water,
right?

146
00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:48.200
And now use the unshared pair of the nitrogen,
right?

147
00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:50.930
And we're going to draw two arrows,
right?

148
00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:53.430
<v 1>Right.</v>

149
00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:57.750
<v 0>So you form a triple bond between the two nitrogens and water is a good leaving</v>

150
00:09:57.751 --> 00:10:00.820
group,
right?

151
00:10:00.821 --> 00:10:05.821
So we have that and now that truly is a fabulous leaving group.

152
00:10:06.431 --> 00:10:08.440
What is the leaving group?
What's going to leave

153
00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:17.240
<v 1>Roy
and too,</v>

154
00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:18.760
right?

155
00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:23.560
<v 0>I,
I looked,
I couldn't find a PKA for protonated into,</v>

156
00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:28.480
it just has no affinity for nitrogen for a hydrogen,
for a proton at all.

157
00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:32.170
I can't,
I couldn't find it,
but it's certainly a very,

158
00:10:32.171 --> 00:10:36.820
very strong acid protonated nitrogen gas,
right?

159
00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:41.410
So it's very good leaving group and you get into,

160
00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:46.660
and it as a leaving group can generate even a bridge head cat ion.

161
00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:48.730
The thing that you can't do with chloride,

162
00:10:48.731 --> 00:10:52.420
even with the help of silver ion is Bartlett and Knox found.

163
00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:55.090
Okay?
So once you have that,

164
00:10:55.091 --> 00:10:57.820
remember we already got the chloride from the first reaction.

165
00:10:58.030 --> 00:11:01.330
So he just put that in and that's how they made it,
right?

166
00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:04.810
So there are leaving groups even better than these.

167
00:11:04.811 --> 00:11:08.920
And two is a fabulous leaving group,
right?

168
00:11:08.921 --> 00:11:10.960
And can even make the bridge head Cat Island.

169
00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:17.100
Now this idea of of a protonated or charging things in order that they leave as

170
00:11:17.531 --> 00:11:22.531
neutral molecules like n two is also present in molecules in this,

171
00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:26.800
in the list we already have here like Roi h has.

172
00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:31.630
That's a very bad leaving group O h minus,
right.
However,

173
00:11:31.631 --> 00:11:36.631
if you protonate it then you have water as the leaving group and that's good.

174
00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:38.530
You've changed the,

175
00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:43.830
you've changed the PKA by a 17 and a half powers of 10 you've changed the PK by

176
00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:49.510
a 17 and a half units.

177
00:11:49.511 --> 00:11:53.950
That is the equilibrium constant by that many powers of 10 so that becomes very

178
00:11:53.951 --> 00:11:57.460
good and in fact there is another good way of doing it.

179
00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:02.640
So that's acid Katala PSAs to help lose o h that is you lose it as water not as

180
00:12:02.681 --> 00:12:07.681
o h minus and another way is to convert it into a sulfonate Ester,

181
00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:11.550
which is a good leaving group.
Did you ever see that for sure

182
00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:15.240
<v 1>to have that complicated thing leave instead of Ooh minus</v>

183
00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:21.360
because of the new dispensation?
Yeah.

184
00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:24.580
<v 0>That the exam is going to be on Friday rather than Wednesday.</v>

185
00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:27.430
You have a whole week to learn that.
Okay.

186
00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:33.340
So that was what Kenyon and Phillips did remember in order to study the

187
00:12:33.341 --> 00:12:37.210
inversion.
Okay.
So there's,
there's,

188
00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:42.220
there are tricks leaving group tricks and there's lore about that of what you

189
00:12:42.221 --> 00:12:44.500
could do to help make,
Ooh,
a leaving group.

190
00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:48.400
You can protonate it had to have the leaving group B,
h two o.

191
00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:53.050
So that can be the leaving group O h two plus.
And then it leaves as h two O.

192
00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:55.960
Right.
So we can look at an example of that.

193
00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:59.170
So here's bromide going to displace hydroxide.

194
00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:04.300
So we can imagine that,
uh,
coming on and hydroxide going off.

195
00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:06.400
But there's a problem with this.

196
00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:11.050
The PKA of of water is 16 roughly,
right?

197
00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:15.370
And the PK of HBR is minus five.

198
00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:19.420
So one way to say it is that bromide is a much better,

199
00:13:19.421 --> 00:13:23.120
and I on that hydroxide is right at one one,

200
00:13:23.121 --> 00:13:25.690
one of them is going to be protonated.
Okay.

201
00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:30.490
What does that mean about this reaction that you'd rather have bromide than have

202
00:13:30.491 --> 00:13:31.330
hydroxide?

203
00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:37.360
<v 1>Luke,
what does that say about this reaction to make a lot of money doing that</v>

204
00:13:37.361 --> 00:13:41.860
reaction?
Why not?

205
00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:49.130
I can't even remember.
That probably wouldn't happen.
What would happen?

206
00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:55.220
You go the other direction.
All right?
So would go that way.

207
00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:56.630
<v 0>Okay.</v>

208
00:13:56.630 --> 00:14:01.630
And I see it start with an expensive starting material and make a cheap product

209
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.740
if you wanted to use that reaction.
But if you put HBR in there,

210
00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:09.470
you protonate it,
right?

211
00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:14.190
Because HBR has a pka of five,
but,

212
00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:17.540
but water or alcohol has a,

213
00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:20.840
has a pka of of minus 1.7.

214
00:14:20.841 --> 00:14:25.370
So there's a difference between that of,
uh,
of uh,
over three.

215
00:14:25.371 --> 00:14:30.371
So it's more than a thousand times better to protonate the oxygen than it is to

216
00:14:31.431 --> 00:14:35.660
protonate br minus.
So this reaction,
we'll certainly go in the right direction,

217
00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:40.070
right?
And now you have a great leaving group.
Okay?

218
00:14:40.071 --> 00:14:44.840
So bromide is a good nucleophile and we'll displace water.
So without,

219
00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:47.380
without,
if you just tried using sodium,

220
00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:50.960
sodium bromide as the source of bromide,
it wouldn't work.

221
00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:53.930
But if you use hydro,
bro,
make acid,

222
00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:58.490
then you zip up the starting material and now it's downhill to the product.

223
00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:04.520
Okay.
And you can cleave ethers.
You know ether is a very common solvent.

224
00:15:04.521 --> 00:15:07.550
I suspect you've used an ether in lab,
right?

225
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.470
Because it doesn't react well with new what you can do have lots of nuclear

226
00:15:12.471 --> 00:15:16.700
files in there,
but you don't displace or minus.
You don't,

227
00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:20.750
that's not alleving group,
that's not a good leaving group.
It's like oh h minus.

228
00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:24.560
Right?
But if you use HBR like this example here,

229
00:15:24.561 --> 00:15:28.250
excess 47% HBR treated for eight hours,

230
00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:31.790
it protonate and now you have a good leaving group.

231
00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:35.210
So you have a good nucleophile and a good leaving group.

232
00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:40.450
The bromide can attack the carbon and the alcohol is the leaving group is the

233
00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:42.253
okay.

234
00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:46.970
And then we already saw that the alcohol reacts with Hbr to give a bromide.

235
00:15:46.971 --> 00:15:51.140
So you convert the ether completely to the bromide if you add HBR.

236
00:15:51.141 --> 00:15:55.130
So HBR can cleave ethers.
Okay.

237
00:15:55.131 --> 00:16:00.131
So that's one trick to make h minus into a leaving group to make Ooh into o h

238
00:16:02.211 --> 00:16:03.950
two plus.
Okay.

239
00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:07.880
Another one is the one we already alluded to and talked about last time,

240
00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:13.210
which is to convert the alcohol into a what's called a sulfonate Esther Atossa

241
00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:14.913
late.

242
00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:19.900
The reason it's called tarsal aid is that that acid is called Tal Uie and soul

243
00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:24.110
phonic acid.
So it's abbreviated Tasi tosic acid.

244
00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:27.020
So Tasi late is the,
uh,

245
00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:31.400
is the leaving group and that the PK of that acid is minus three.

246
00:16:31.401 --> 00:16:32.540
So it's not surprising.

247
00:16:32.541 --> 00:16:36.860
It's a good leaving group and worked well for Kenyon and Phillips in 1923.

248
00:16:36.861 --> 00:16:40.580
That's a very common way to make alcohols into leaving groups.

249
00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:45.680
Another way is talked about in,
in the Jones text,

250
00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:50.150
which is uh oh s OCL.
Okay.

251
00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:52.700
So the way to get that is to start,

252
00:16:52.701 --> 00:16:56.510
as they say here with thigh and Neil Chloride SOCL too,

253
00:16:56.870 --> 00:17:01.870
which reacts with the alcohol to give an alcohol chloride plus s o two and hcl.

254
00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:08.360
And there's an example shown here of a particular acid being converted with

255
00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:12.560
financial chloride,
chloroform,
a hundred degrees,
two hours into an 80% yield.

256
00:17:12.561 --> 00:17:17.561
They say of this plus s o two and hcl 80% is not such a great yield for this

257
00:17:19.131 --> 00:17:20.480
reaction.
I've done this.

258
00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:23.870
This is one of the reactions I've done a lot and it really gives very,

259
00:17:23.871 --> 00:17:25.250
very good yields.
Typically,

260
00:17:25.251 --> 00:17:30.251
one of the reasons it's so handy is that the byproducts are gases.

261
00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:34.280
So you don't have to do any separation.
They just go away.

262
00:17:34.281 --> 00:17:38.150
You can appreciate from lab how handy it would be if you didn't have to do any

263
00:17:38.151 --> 00:17:42.260
purification of the product at the end.
Everything just went up the hood.

264
00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:46.820
Okay.
And furthermore,
uh,
uh,

265
00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:48.230
there's,

266
00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:51.480
there seems to be a little bit of a problem here because they said they did this

267
00:17:51.481 --> 00:17:53.370
in chloroform at a hundred degrees.

268
00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:57.510
It could be that the bath was at a hundred degrees,
but if so,

269
00:17:57.540 --> 00:17:59.790
the solution wasn't at a hundred degrees.

270
00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:02.010
Does anybody have an idea why that might be?

271
00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:08.460
Cause the boiling point of chloroform is 61 and the boiling point of vinyl

272
00:18:08.461 --> 00:18:13.461
chloride is 75 so it'd be very difficult to get a solution like that he did to a

273
00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:19.580
hundred degrees.
Right.
So the reason I put point this out on this,
uh,
uh,

274
00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:22.590
page from the book is that,
uh,
uh,

275
00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:27.150
Professor Jones is a great friend of mine and a very good physical organic

276
00:18:27.151 --> 00:18:30.490
chemist and he has,
he's taken the prob the,
uh,

277
00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:35.540
care and his book as in most good books to actually put in real examples,

278
00:18:36.481 --> 00:18:40.620
not just theoretical examples made up out of your head.
You know,
there was a,

279
00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:43.200
there was a very famous professor in the,
uh,

280
00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:48.620
in the first half of the 20th century at Mit whose occupation in the summer was

281
00:18:49.891 --> 00:18:51.240
to write textbooks.

282
00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:56.310
But he did it by going up to his cabin in Maine and writing the textbooks there

283
00:18:56.311 --> 00:18:59.940
where he had no access to a library.
So everything he wrote,

284
00:18:59.941 --> 00:19:02.400
he made up out of his head in there.
Right.

285
00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:06.450
Much better to have an example like this where they give exactly what the yield

286
00:19:06.451 --> 00:19:10.650
is 80% and what the conditions were.
But even in this case,

287
00:19:10.651 --> 00:19:14.160
I doubt that that really was the condition,
although that might've been what the,

288
00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:17.880
what the heating mantle was at 100 degrees with the solution,

289
00:19:17.881 --> 00:19:21.420
couldn't possibly have been at 100 degrees.
Even though when you mix things,

290
00:19:21.421 --> 00:19:22.920
the boiling point is elevated,

291
00:19:22.921 --> 00:19:25.080
but it wouldn't be that much elevated I don't think.

292
00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:28.490
But the reason I mentioned that is not just the to,
uh,

293
00:19:28.650 --> 00:19:32.220
point out that you have to take things with a grain of salt and look as much as

294
00:19:32.221 --> 00:19:36.900
you can and original literature if you really want to repeat some,
uh,

295
00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:41.580
process.
Uh,
but to point out that that final deal,
chloride is a rather,

296
00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:45.060
is not a very high boiling liquid.
So in fact,

297
00:19:45.061 --> 00:19:46.770
all you do is take the alcohol.

298
00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:51.600
You don't need a chloroform at least I'd never used a solvent.
This is a liquid.

299
00:19:51.601 --> 00:19:54.510
This'll dissolve this,
right?
And as,

300
00:19:54.511 --> 00:19:57.360
and the product chloride is the liquid even in,
uh,

301
00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:00.660
with bigger molecules where the alcohol might be a solid.

302
00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:05.990
So you just heat it up and for awhile reflux it and then distill out.

303
00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:11.690
And this SOCL to still distills out the two and HCL distills out.

304
00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:15.810
And all you're left with is the,
is the,
uh,
Al Kill chloride.

305
00:20:15.811 --> 00:20:20.210
It's a beautiful reaction.
Okay.
And here's an example.

306
00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:25.140
An example there that shows the mechanism of this.
The crucial part is this.
You,

307
00:20:25.141 --> 00:20:28.620
the,
the alcohol display displaces that sulfur.

308
00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:32.850
So the chloride goes away and you get our,
oh,
and this is the new bond.

309
00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:37.760
So cl right now,
uh,

310
00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:40.680
pardon me,
I said the wrong thing.
At first you'd display,
yeah,

311
00:20:40.681 --> 00:20:45.590
you displaced one of these chlorides with the,
Oh,
so you get R,

312
00:20:45.591 --> 00:20:47.500
O,
s,
O,
l.

313
00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:52.780
But now the neat reaction is that you generated chloride in that process when

314
00:20:52.781 --> 00:20:54.190
you eliminated a chloride here,

315
00:20:54.191 --> 00:20:59.140
that chloride can do an sn two displacement on the are these electrons go in

316
00:20:59.141 --> 00:21:02.200
here.
But at the same time,
these chloride,

317
00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:04.270
these electrons go onto the chloride.

318
00:21:04.271 --> 00:21:08.920
So you directly make [inaudible] two and cl.
So it's an unusual kind of leaving,

319
00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:11.980
leaving group cause it breaks apart as it leaves

320
00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:16.690
day.
Now another way,
uh,
to,

321
00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:21.170
to make the Oah into alleving group is to have it be,
uh,

322
00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:25.390
have phosphorous on there with electron withdrawing groups on it.

323
00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:27.820
Because as it turns out,

324
00:21:27.821 --> 00:21:31.480
the double bond between phosphorus and oxygen is quite a strong one.

325
00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:36.780
Remember that phosphorus has d orbitals that are vacant so they can stabilize a

326
00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:42.220
electrons on the adjacent oxygen or when you make a negative charge there.

327
00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:45.820
Okay?
And if x is something that's electro negative,

328
00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:47.680
this is a very good leaving group.

329
00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:53.040
So here's an example of an alcohol tweeted with PBR three and it gives a 58%

330
00:21:54.461 --> 00:21:56.860
yield.
They sat here with specific conditions,

331
00:21:56.950 --> 00:22:01.840
ad and a phosphoric acid as a byproduct.
Okay?

332
00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:06.700
And here's another example.
Uh,
we using PCL five,

333
00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:09.970
right?
It says 100%,

334
00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:14.050
but aware of things that say the yield is 100%.

335
00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:17.740
That's a sign that the person probably wasn't very careful.

336
00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:22.210
Have you ever gotten a 100% yield in lab?
These people may be,

337
00:22:22.211 --> 00:22:25.180
have more experience than you,
but they're not that much better.

338
00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:29.710
Very rarely do you truly get 100% yield.
Okay.

339
00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:32.500
Uh,
now,
how does this work?
Well,

340
00:22:32.501 --> 00:22:34.870
first you do a substitution that phosphorous,

341
00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:39.970
so the o of the Oah attacks phosphorous and displaces chloride,

342
00:22:39.971 --> 00:22:44.971
probably that's a d a association and dissociation probably you first form a

343
00:22:45.641 --> 00:22:46.730
bond to phosphorous.

344
00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:50.200
Remember it as vacant d orbitals and then the chloride leaves.

345
00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:51.940
Okay?

346
00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:56.380
So you have this with these electronegative groups on it and now that can be a

347
00:22:56.381 --> 00:23:01.150
good leaving group,
right?
So you've converted o h into this good leaving group.

348
00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:03.370
Now that's an interesting,

349
00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:08.350
why is that particular one of interest in context of what we've been talking

350
00:23:08.351 --> 00:23:09.184
about lately?

351
00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:17.450
What's interesting about that particular argument to do it as a substitution of

352
00:23:17.451 --> 00:23:18.284
that carbon,

353
00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:21.773
<v 1>Linda,</v>

354
00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:26.480
<v 0>okay,
I can do real
Aha.</v>

355
00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:29.720
Can't do a backside attacks,
right?

356
00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:31.850
This is like the Bartlett knocks thing,
right?

357
00:23:31.851 --> 00:23:34.910
It's set up so you can't get a nucleophile to the backside.

358
00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:38.800
The alternative remember was to,
uh,

359
00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:43.420
have it leave and leave a cad ion,
right?

360
00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:48.260
Just leave without the help from being back side.
Uh,
but,
uh,

361
00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:49.760
what we learned from this,

362
00:23:49.761 --> 00:23:54.500
the fact that we get a 100% yield is that we can do that.

363
00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:58.430
So these rings are bigger.
Remember the one that Bartlett and Knox made,

364
00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:01.970
the bridges were two carbons,
two carbons and one carbon.

365
00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:04.010
Here are the rings are much bigger,

366
00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:08.180
so it's easier to distort the angles in order to flatten the rings.

367
00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:12.890
Okay?
So you can do substitution.
That bridge had cad ions,

368
00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:17.150
just not when the rings are involving bridge had cat and it's just not when the

369
00:24:17.151 --> 00:24:21.180
rings are very small.
But what you learn here is that this,
uh,

370
00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:25.340
this leaving group is good enough to do that even though it's a bridge head.

371
00:24:26.620 --> 00:24:30.410
Okay?
Another trick is this one called the apple reaction.

372
00:24:30.411 --> 00:24:33.500
I took this figure from Wikipedia.
Uh,

373
00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:37.540
the reagents that you add to the alcohol are,
uh,

374
00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:42.470
try fennel phosphene and carbon tetrachloride and unusual reagent.

375
00:24:42.471 --> 00:24:45.800
You more often would think of that as a solvent then as a reagent.

376
00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:47.001
But as you see,

377
00:24:47.001 --> 00:24:51.980
what happens is the unshared pair on phosphorus does a substitution on carbon

378
00:24:51.981 --> 00:24:56.690
tetrachloride,
but the phosphorus attacks chloride,

379
00:24:56.930 --> 00:24:57.830
not carbon.

380
00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:03.220
So it attacks the chloride and CCL three minus is the leaving group because the

381
00:25:04.311 --> 00:25:07.730
three chlorines are sufficiently electron attractive that the,

382
00:25:07.790 --> 00:25:10.280
that the anti and is not a bad anti.

383
00:25:10.281 --> 00:25:13.910
And it's the PKA of chloroform is 24.

384
00:25:14.150 --> 00:25:17.840
So it's pretty easy to generate that and I,
and,
and lose a proton.

385
00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:21.380
Now notice that this stage,
when you add the alcohol,

386
00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:23.750
it's PK is about 17.

387
00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:27.260
So the try chloro methyl and ion,

388
00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:32.710
although it's unusually stable for a carbon and iron is much,

389
00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:37.700
uh,
more avid to get a proton than the,
than the Oh of the,

390
00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:40.340
uh,
of the alcohol is.
So it takes,

391
00:25:40.370 --> 00:25:43.370
so this base that you'd made made in the first reaction,

392
00:25:43.371 --> 00:25:46.400
the leaving group takes the proton off the alcohol.

393
00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:51.320
And now you have orr minus.
But now you have,
uh,

394
00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:54.350
uh,
the,
uh,
the,

395
00:25:54.351 --> 00:25:59.351
the possibility for chloride to attack this carbon where you've made this new

396
00:26:00.021 --> 00:26:04.160
bond here.
That's probably an association followed by dissociation.

397
00:26:04.161 --> 00:26:08.100
But notice the substitution is that phosphorus,
uh,

398
00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:12.140
because the o attack,
the phosphorus and chloride came off.

399
00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:15.560
So here's the chloride.
It does a nuclear filex substitution.

400
00:26:15.561 --> 00:26:20.480
Now at carbon and fennel three Po try fennel.

401
00:26:20.481 --> 00:26:24.500
Phosphine oxide is the leaving group.
And that's a super leaving group.

402
00:26:24.501 --> 00:26:28.400
This is a very strong bond.
The Po,
a double bond there.

403
00:26:28.790 --> 00:26:31.160
So this converted,
Ooh,

404
00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:35.960
f what would have been an Oah leaving group into this try fennel,

405
00:26:35.961 --> 00:26:39.830
phosphene cad I and which leaves to get make,

406
00:26:39.850 --> 00:26:42.450
try funnel phosphine oxide.
Uh,

407
00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:45.690
so you've made a very good leaving group out of an oxygen.

408
00:26:45.691 --> 00:26:49.770
So what this shows is that there are lots of ways to skin a cat.
You know,

409
00:26:49.771 --> 00:26:51.870
O h minus is a terrible leaving group,

410
00:26:51.871 --> 00:26:55.350
but we have lots of different ways of going at it.
You can,

411
00:26:55.590 --> 00:27:00.320
you can protonate it,
you can,
uh,
you can use SOCL to,

412
00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:03.480
uh,
you can,
uh,
use the phosphorus,

413
00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:07.320
a chloride or bromides the phosphorus highlights.

414
00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:12.060
And you can do this funny trick and the apple reaction using,

415
00:27:12.210 --> 00:27:14.640
try funnel phosphene and carbon tetrachloride.

416
00:27:15.150 --> 00:27:19.560
And here's an example from the book.
So the Oah was from the,
uh,

417
00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:23.650
from the Jones' book where the o h,
uh,

418
00:27:23.850 --> 00:27:28.260
is made into a leaving group by try fennel phosphene and carbon tetrachloride.

419
00:27:28.261 --> 00:27:30.960
It says it was done over a day at room temperature.

420
00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:35.880
And here's the chloride notice it inverted the presence of deuterium comes here,

421
00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:40.180
allows you to know whether,
whether the,
the,
uh,
configuration is,

422
00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:45.180
is retained or inverted.
And as you expect with an sn two reaction,

423
00:27:45.181 --> 00:27:49.200
it's inverted.
Now.
Uh,
so we've,

424
00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:53.340
we've looked a lot at these,
uh,
these,
uh,
that this mechanism.

425
00:27:53.610 --> 00:27:58.610
Let's see how you can use knowledge of the mechanism to do something useful.

426
00:27:59.311 --> 00:28:00.540
In this particular case,

427
00:28:00.541 --> 00:28:05.430
it was to maximize synthetic speed in order to do,

428
00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:10.350
to,
uh,
to uh,
make pet scanning possible.
Do people know what pet scanning is?

429
00:28:10.370 --> 00:28:12.900
Pet what the P stands for?

430
00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:17.980
<v 1>The P is positron.
And what is a positron?</v>

431
00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:23.740
It's something you don't encounter very often.
You can't buy a bottle of it.

432
00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:28.260
Pardon me?
It's anti matter.
It's an

433
00:28:28.410 --> 00:28:30.030
<v 0>positive electron.</v>

434
00:28:30.330 --> 00:28:34.110
It's an electron that has a positive charge instead of a negative charge.

435
00:28:34.290 --> 00:28:38.040
So that's a positron.
Now,
where do you get positrons?

436
00:28:46.930 --> 00:28:48.560
<v 1>You get 'em by nuclear,
you're</v>

437
00:28:48.570 --> 00:28:53.550
<v 0>decay,
unstable isotopes,
decay to give a number of particles.</v>

438
00:28:53.551 --> 00:28:56.490
But one that's given,
especially in the case of,
uh,

439
00:28:56.491 --> 00:29:01.170
of f 18 is,
is uh,
uh,

440
00:29:02.390 --> 00:29:05.280
cause so f 18 can give off.

441
00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:10.380
You can have one of its protons in the nucleus become a new tron.

442
00:29:12.030 --> 00:29:16.710
That is,
it's the same,
it's the same particle,
but it loses a positive charge,

443
00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:21.480
right?
So Proton becomes a neutron.
So instead of fluoride,

444
00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:26.490
it's now oxygen,
right?
So you've made a new element,

445
00:29:27.030 --> 00:29:31.980
right?
And it's lost a positive charge.
So,
so if it was f minus its oxygen,

446
00:29:31.981 --> 00:29:34.680
double minus,
but it's the same mass,
right?

447
00:29:34.681 --> 00:29:38.400
18 because all you lost was this positive electron.

448
00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:42.190
Now when you have a positive electron,

449
00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:47.220
it goes away instantly because the anti matter meets its corresponding matter

450
00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:52.690
and electron,
right where it lives,
right?
It's there,
it's made right there.

451
00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:55.780
But there are a zillion electrons around.
Even on the same atom,

452
00:29:55.781 --> 00:29:57.820
there are like trons.
So when the two,

453
00:29:57.821 --> 00:30:02.170
when the electron and a positron meet one another,
they annihilate,

454
00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:03.760
they go away.

455
00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.830
And what comes out is two photons gamma particles,

456
00:30:09.010 --> 00:30:14.010
which is you saw flew off anti parallel to one another along the same line.

457
00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:16.780
So you get,
if you have a detector,

458
00:30:16.781 --> 00:30:20.740
you see a fly ash here and detected over there as well.

459
00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:23.680
Now you can do that again and again.

460
00:30:23.681 --> 00:30:27.670
You can get Bingo those to happen at the same time,
right?

461
00:30:27.671 --> 00:30:31.900
Because they came from the same decay or those two.

462
00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:33.040
Right?

463
00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:37.510
So if you surround the thing with the detector that can tell when things hit it

464
00:30:37.810 --> 00:30:40.840
when two things hit it at the same time,
right?

465
00:30:40.841 --> 00:30:44.560
They came from the same nuclear decay.
Okay.

466
00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:47.560
Now do you see what you could do with respect to imaging?

467
00:30:48.850 --> 00:30:49.150
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

468
00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:54.150
<v 0>How could you tell where the sample that had flury and was that had fluorine 18</v>

469
00:30:57.540 --> 00:31:00.630
all you know is where are these things hit your detector?

470
00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:05.810
You see what you do to figure out where they came from?

471
00:31:08.030 --> 00:31:12.110
Aha.
Yes.
You trace lines.
So if you connect those,

472
00:31:12.111 --> 00:31:15.560
where they intersect is where the fluorine 18 was.

473
00:31:16.070 --> 00:31:20.330
Each line comes from one fluorine 18 but the sample had a number of fluorine,

474
00:31:20.331 --> 00:31:24.290
18 senate.
So they they,
so you find out where the sample was.

475
00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:29.780
Okay.
Now,
uh,
if you want to use this imaging defined tumors,

476
00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:34.700
you have to find some way to get flurry in 18 to where the tumor is.

477
00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:36.080
And then if you put the,

478
00:31:36.081 --> 00:31:41.081
surround the patient with this detector and measure these simultaneous flashes

479
00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:45.410
or detection events,
then you know where that substance was.

480
00:31:45.411 --> 00:31:49.340
So if you could make that substance be in the tumor,
then you're home free,

481
00:31:50.150 --> 00:31:54.800
but you have to do it.
You can read about it then as I did in Wikipedia.

482
00:31:56.090 --> 00:31:58.340
Uh,
what you have to do this,

483
00:31:58.580 --> 00:32:03.230
you have to do this really quickly after you've prepared the element,

484
00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:06.440
right?
So you prepare the element f 18,

485
00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:09.110
but it's half life is only a 110 minutes,

486
00:32:09.470 --> 00:32:13.610
so you don't have much time to make it into something that will go where the or

487
00:32:13.611 --> 00:32:14.444
is.

488
00:32:14.510 --> 00:32:18.770
So speed is of the essence and doing whatever kind of synthesis you're going to

489
00:32:18.771 --> 00:32:19.370
get.

490
00:32:19.370 --> 00:32:24.370
Now where do you get f 18 you get it from all eight t in the same as the product

491
00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:28.970
by adding a proton and losing a new tron.

492
00:32:32.530 --> 00:32:36.610
Okay,
so you don't change the bass,
right?
But you,

493
00:32:36.850 --> 00:32:40.580
but you put a positive charge in to the nucleus so you,

494
00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:45.740
so you get flury in instead of oxygen,
okay?
Now,
okay,
fine.

495
00:32:45.741 --> 00:32:49.910
If you have all 18 you buy oh 18,
uh,
then your butt,
your,

496
00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.450
but where are you going to get a proton that's going really fast?

497
00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:56.450
7 million electron volts.

498
00:33:01.610 --> 00:33:05.600
You have to get it from an accelerator right from a cyclotron,

499
00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:07.460
okay?

500
00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:12.020
Now you can also do it with carb making in place of Fluor and you could have

501
00:33:12.021 --> 00:33:15.830
carbon or nitrogen or oxygen,
but they have even shorter half life.

502
00:33:15.831 --> 00:33:20.650
So you have to work even quicker in order to have any there at the time to get

503
00:33:20.651 --> 00:33:22.550
it where you want it to be detected.

504
00:33:23.090 --> 00:33:28.090
Now if you go onto the pet center.yale.edu you see that they do this positron

505
00:33:28.491 --> 00:33:30.200
emission tomography,

506
00:33:30.650 --> 00:33:34.370
and you see what they have as a cyclotron that generates these high energy

507
00:33:34.371 --> 00:33:38.720
protons that can convert one element into one of these radioactive elements

508
00:33:38.721 --> 00:33:41.780
that'll generate positrons,
okay?

509
00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:47.180
And you see they have a water target so that you can produce fluoride.

510
00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:51.290
They also have targets to produce those other elements I talked about.

511
00:33:51.890 --> 00:33:56.570
And they say they also have two fluorine,
18 synthesis modules,

512
00:33:56.900 --> 00:34:01.490
one for nuclear,
Felix substitution and one for electrophilic substitution.

513
00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:04.970
Okay.
So,
but the question is,
so they have,

514
00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:10.000
they have the facility for making this stuff and then doing reactions quickly

515
00:34:10.341 --> 00:34:11.510
with it.
Right?

516
00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:16.280
But the question is what are you going to sit the size so that it will go to a

517
00:34:16.281 --> 00:34:19.850
tumor so you can find where the tumor is and you have to do it really quickly,

518
00:34:21.110 --> 00:34:22.070
right?
Well,

519
00:34:22.071 --> 00:34:27.071
glucose is the basis of metabolism and tubers are growing rapidly,

520
00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:32.720
so they really snarfy up,
uh,
glucose.
Okay.

521
00:34:34.010 --> 00:34:38.990
So if you had f 18 and glucose,
uh,
that might do the trick,
right?

522
00:34:39.350 --> 00:34:43.040
If you could make two flouro glucose,
right,

523
00:34:43.041 --> 00:34:46.820
with an f 18 in it,
maybe that would suck up a,

524
00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:51.890
it be sucked up by the tumors the same way that glucose is.

525
00:34:51.950 --> 00:34:56.810
So we need to make that molecule as quickly as possible from glucose.
Okay.

526
00:34:57.830 --> 00:35:01.010
Okay.
Well,
let's just do as a nuclear Philly's substitution,

527
00:35:01.011 --> 00:35:04.850
Fluor idea in hydroxide out.
Does that sound good?

528
00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:10.280
Or might there be problems with that in doing the sn two reaction?

529
00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:14.540
Did you think of a problem doing this reaction?

530
00:35:14.541 --> 00:35:18.800
Fluoride comes in and displaces Oah to give the compound on the right,

531
00:35:18.801 --> 00:35:23.230
which has the same shape as glucose.
Lauren,
what's up buddy?
Problem.

532
00:35:24.730 --> 00:35:29.300
Okay,
so the hydroxides a crummy leaving group.
Whoops.
And it didn't,

533
00:35:29.301 --> 00:35:33.710
it was supposed to come up there,
but it didn't.
I had anticipated you,

534
00:35:34.130 --> 00:35:37.980
but uh,
I think I did.
Let's see what the next one is.
Yeah,

535
00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:42.240
but it could be that the wrong CEO to the wrong carbon gets attacked.

536
00:35:42.241 --> 00:35:43.650
There are lots of ohs here.

537
00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:47.280
Even if it could be attacked that the others could be just as good.

538
00:35:47.670 --> 00:35:51.810
And if you did sn two a displacement at the oxygen,

539
00:35:51.811 --> 00:35:55.590
even if you attack that one,
it would give the wrong Fluor 18

540
00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:01.570
arrangement.
Oh,
there's Lauren's,
right?
It's a terrible leaving group.

541
00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:06.310
Okay.
That's not all.
That's possible.
That's wrong with this.

542
00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:11.620
A fluoride is a horrid nucleophile as we saw right member at a it,

543
00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:14.410
it's tied up by hydrogen bonding.

544
00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:19.270
So you have to break the hydrogen bonds and it's very small and highly charged.

545
00:36:19.271 --> 00:36:24.010
So it's has very strong hydrogen bonds.
And furthermore,
uh,

546
00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:27.580
it's tied up by the potassium cad ion,
right?

547
00:36:27.610 --> 00:36:31.000
Which makes it less reactive.
So you've got lots and lots of problems.

548
00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:36.190
So that doesn't look like it's going to do the trick.
All right,
now,

549
00:36:36.191 --> 00:36:40.900
can we address these problems on the basis of what we've been talking about?

550
00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:45.640
Can we figure out some way of doing it so we can do this transformation really

551
00:36:45.641 --> 00:36:48.910
rapidly after the cyclotron generates this stuff?

552
00:36:48.911 --> 00:36:52.480
That's half of it's going away every couple hours.
Okay.

553
00:36:52.870 --> 00:36:56.410
How bout the sn two inversion version gives the wrong configuration.

554
00:36:57.010 --> 00:37:00.400
What could we do to get the right configuration if we did an inversion

555
00:37:03.050 --> 00:37:07.520
use a different starting material.
Right?
And it turns out that mannose,

556
00:37:07.521 --> 00:37:11.810
which has this,
Ooh,
axial pointed up,
is readily available.

557
00:37:11.811 --> 00:37:15.020
It's a different sugar.
And if you did substitution on that,

558
00:37:15.021 --> 00:37:17.360
you'd get the equatorial thing that you wanted.

559
00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:19.430
That would be so that's no problem.

560
00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:23.630
Now we have the problem that the wrong CEO could be attacked.
There are,

561
00:37:23.690 --> 00:37:28.580
there are uh,
uh,
there are,
uh,
one,
two,
three,

562
00:37:28.581 --> 00:37:31.220
four,
five different Coh is in here.

563
00:37:31.910 --> 00:37:36.910
So what you have to do is make one of them different from the others,

564
00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:41.180
right?
The one you want to attack has to be different from the others.

565
00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:46.510
And the way you do it is has been known a long time in sugar chemistry,

566
00:37:48.410 --> 00:37:53.270
which is you can protect some of the groups and not another one.

567
00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:57.410
So what w what's done here is to,
is to put assets,

568
00:37:57.411 --> 00:38:02.411
deal groups on all the other four but not on this particular h and how that's

569
00:38:04.251 --> 00:38:08.030
done,
we won't go into,
now that's a topic and sugar chemistry,

570
00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:11.090
but you know how to do it.
Okay.
Now,

571
00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:13.850
but there's a problem here that still,

572
00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:18.050
that o h minus is a horrid leaving group.
It's now different from the others,

573
00:38:18.350 --> 00:38:22.970
but it's a horrid leaving group and Acetate is a better leaving group,
right?

574
00:38:22.971 --> 00:38:27.820
It's,
it's a more acidic compound,
a CT Cason than water better.

575
00:38:27.821 --> 00:38:32.450
And I,
okay.
So what are we going to do now,
Lauren?
It was your,

576
00:38:32.451 --> 00:38:35.430
this was your problem.
That the,
Ooh,
my one.

577
00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:37.040
<v 1>They leaving move.
What did we do?</v>

578
00:38:40.370 --> 00:38:44.810
Try to from here to here,
try to protonate it.
We could,
we could,

579
00:38:44.811 --> 00:38:45.940
we could probably get it,
but you're good.

580
00:38:45.970 --> 00:38:50.500
<v 0>Protonate the acetates to would make them better leaving groups so that won't do</v>

581
00:38:50.501 --> 00:38:51.334
the trick.

582
00:38:54.290 --> 00:38:55.123
<v 1>Okay.</v>

583
00:38:56.380 --> 00:38:59.620
<v 0>What they did was converted into a sole phonic acid.</v>

584
00:38:59.650 --> 00:39:03.730
Now the one that Kenyon and Phillips did had a fennel group here,

585
00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:07.300
or a Tall Youin,
actually a benzene with a methyl on the edge of it.

586
00:39:07.630 --> 00:39:09.820
This is CF three white.

587
00:39:09.821 --> 00:39:14.821
My CF three be better than just a regular old hydrocarbon like tall youin.

588
00:39:17.110 --> 00:39:21.460
It's got the flu or Ian's in it that are electron withdrawing.
So it makes this,

589
00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:23.900
it makes the anti and you're gonna want to leave.

590
00:39:23.950 --> 00:39:28.930
Leave this o s o two CF three is a much stronger acid.

591
00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:33.280
Right.
But much more stable and I,
and a better leaving group.
Uh,

592
00:39:34.660 --> 00:39:35.710
so that's great.

593
00:39:35.711 --> 00:39:40.360
It's the PKA of the corresponding acid here is minus 14.

594
00:39:40.660 --> 00:39:42.370
It's called a super acid.

595
00:39:42.810 --> 00:39:47.380
Remember the the strongest when we've talked about so far had a PK of minus 11.

596
00:39:47.590 --> 00:39:52.360
This is a thousand times stronger than Hii.
So it's a great,

597
00:39:52.510 --> 00:39:55.060
so we put on are really super leaving group.
It's called,

598
00:39:55.270 --> 00:39:58.770
it's trifluridine methane sulfonate and called flight.

599
00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:00.753
Okay.

600
00:40:01.390 --> 00:40:06.390
So now we have a compound that's as good as we can make it for being attacked,

601
00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:12.070
uh,
at this center,
not the others,
uh,

602
00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:16.240
for having a great leaving group and for having the proper stereochemistry,

603
00:40:16.690 --> 00:40:19.330
right?
So that will get the fluoride where we want it.

604
00:40:19.331 --> 00:40:22.600
And now we have to do the reaction with fluoride,
right?

605
00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:26.950
Notice that all of this can be done ahead of time.
We can have the bottom right,

606
00:40:27.330 --> 00:40:30.760
a molecule take however much time we want to make it.

607
00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:35.110
Now we have it in a bottle.
We go to the cyclotron at the medical school,

608
00:40:35.111 --> 00:40:39.820
get fluoride,
18 right?
And try to do our substitution.

609
00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:43.840
Right now we have to introduce the flouride 18,
right?

610
00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:47.680
So we want to have to go from this protected,
trifling late.

611
00:40:48.190 --> 00:40:52.360
To this compound as soon as we can,
right?

612
00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:56.260
Because it's the fluorides giving off these positrons all the time.

613
00:40:57.490 --> 00:40:58.810
Okay.
So we,

614
00:40:58.870 --> 00:41:03.820
so let's react it with potassium fluoride with fluoride.

615
00:41:03.821 --> 00:41:06.610
18.
Okay.
What's the problem?

616
00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:11.860
The fluoride is tied up by hydrogen bonding.
It's not a good nucleophile.

617
00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:15.850
How could we,
how could we get around that problem of the hydrogen bonding,

618
00:41:15.851 --> 00:41:17.380
deactivating fluoride?

619
00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:29.050
<v 1>Any ideas on that one?
How can Lauren,</v>

620
00:41:29.410 --> 00:41:32.110
could you shoot a solid change the salt,
something

621
00:41:32.110 --> 00:41:36.880
<v 0>that can't make bonds,
right?
So they use,
uh,
uh,</v>

622
00:41:37.030 --> 00:41:41.570
a cdot night trial,
methyl cyanide,
which doesn't have any,
uh,

623
00:41:41.870 --> 00:41:45.140
hydrogen bonding protons in it.
It has cah protons,

624
00:41:45.141 --> 00:41:48.560
but those aren't involved in hydrogen bonding.
So that's no problem.

625
00:41:48.830 --> 00:41:53.660
But we still have this last problem that potassium cad ion is going to be

626
00:41:53.661 --> 00:41:57.590
tightly associated with the fluoride and we're going to have to break it away to

627
00:41:57.591 --> 00:42:00.530
make the fluoride more reactive.
How can we make the,

628
00:42:00.950 --> 00:42:03.380
how can we get rid of the potassium cad?
I am.

629
00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:10.520
Do you remember the problem is the potassium,

630
00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:14.720
a single atom is rather small.
If it were big,

631
00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:19.310
then it wouldn't attract by Coolamons law,
the fluoride so tightly,

632
00:42:19.311 --> 00:42:22.610
then you wouldn't have to worry about it.
How could we make potassium big?

633
00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:24.830
Harvard.
Did you have an idea?

634
00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:32.340
<v 1>Dolan?
Don't they don't like I always get bigger if you add an electron,</v>

635
00:42:34.030 --> 00:42:37.340
<v 0>uh,
well if you add an electron to the potassium cat,
I,</v>

636
00:42:37.341 --> 00:42:40.330
and it's not a cat I anymore,
it's not the thing that's associated.

637
00:42:40.630 --> 00:42:43.900
So it has to still be a cad ion,
but you want to make it bigger.

638
00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:46.900
How do you make a potassium cad?
I am big.

639
00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:51.750
<v 1>Ah,
but that's,</v>

640
00:42:52.310 --> 00:42:55.790
<v 0>uh,
that's,
that's an interesting idea,</v>

641
00:42:56.180 --> 00:43:01.180
but I don't think it's practical because you couldn't have enough light to,

642
00:43:01.250 --> 00:43:02.083
to,
uh,

643
00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:07.250
to make a significant number of them bigger all at the same time without just

644
00:43:07.251 --> 00:43:08.480
blowing everything apart.

645
00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:12.230
<v 1>Okay.
Hey,
Matt,
could you separate it?</v>

646
00:43:12.231 --> 00:43:16.120
You see a crowney through [inaudible] or even better?

647
00:43:16.180 --> 00:43:20.950
<v 0>It's a crip date.
Okay.
So you make it big that way.</v>

648
00:43:20.951 --> 00:43:24.640
And now the fluoride's a good nucleophile.
There's no hydrogen bonding.

649
00:43:24.940 --> 00:43:26.770
The cad ion is really big.

650
00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:28.673
<v 1>Okay.</v>

651
00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:33.350
<v 0>And now you can do that.
So that's how they do it.
Okay,</v>

652
00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:38.800
so it's all this using these ideas to figure out how to tune the sn two reaction

653
00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:42.230
to make it as efficient as possible.

654
00:43:42.380 --> 00:43:45.680
And of course there's one more step you have to then take off these acetate

655
00:43:45.681 --> 00:43:50.480
groups,
but you can do that just by treating it with water and acid.
Okay.

656
00:43:50.810 --> 00:43:55.810
And here's an example of a of a pet scan image that's measured one hour after

657
00:43:56.151 --> 00:43:59.240
administering.
So you have,
you have not only have to make the stuff,

658
00:43:59.870 --> 00:44:04.250
you have to give it to the patient and the patient has to process it enough that

659
00:44:04.251 --> 00:44:07.070
that compound gets to where the tumor is.

660
00:44:07.310 --> 00:44:10.490
Now it goes to where glucose is being consumed,

661
00:44:10.491 --> 00:44:15.491
the two flouro glucose and one place that a lot of glucose is being consumed is

662
00:44:16.341 --> 00:44:17.570
up there.
Where's that?

663
00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:21.590
<v 1>Is it happening for you?</v>

664
00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:26.630
If I had given you a do flouro glucose and was looking at your boss,
the prawns,

665
00:44:26.631 --> 00:44:30.770
when I see them coming from here,
all right.
That's where a lot of metabolism,

666
00:44:30.771 --> 00:44:32.310
but unfortunately

667
00:44:32.310 --> 00:44:35.280
<v 0>also there.
And if we slice through there and tip it up,</v>

668
00:44:35.610 --> 00:44:40.530
you can see that that's the,
uh,
that's the tumor that was located this way.
Uh,

669
00:44:41.790 --> 00:44:46.200
so the metabolism was in the brain but also in a cancerous lymph node.

670
00:44:47.220 --> 00:44:51.240
Okay.
So understanding how nuclear filex substitution works,

671
00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:55.560
how to control it was crucial in designing this technique.

672
00:44:56.910 --> 00:44:57.241
Okay.

673
00:44:57.241 --> 00:45:02.241
Now one last topic which I'll just introduce here and then we'll uh,

674
00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:05.550
we'll complete next time.
Is the,

675
00:45:05.610 --> 00:45:09.720
we've talked about stereochemistry late rate law and rate constant,

676
00:45:10.410 --> 00:45:13.890
but can you do actual structural work?

677
00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:16.670
Remember how we talked about the mechanism of,

678
00:45:16.870 --> 00:45:21.870
of a nucleophile attacking the carbon yield group.
And you could do it by x Ray.

679
00:45:21.871 --> 00:45:24.750
You could get a bunch of different compounds that had nitrogens in different

680
00:45:24.751 --> 00:45:28.440
positions relative to the carbon eel and you could put them together and sort of

681
00:45:28.441 --> 00:45:30.080
a movie in the Borghi done.

682
00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:34.680
It's a material that we did last semester and see the stage of the reaction.

683
00:45:35.010 --> 00:45:38.340
Might you be able to do that for a nuclear fillic substitution?

684
00:45:38.730 --> 00:45:42.100
Might you be able to use x-ray and if not extra,

685
00:45:42.101 --> 00:45:47.100
at least use quantum mechanics to see what the structure of this intermediate
is.

686
00:45:47.101 --> 00:45:49.350
Because what's hard to tell we,

687
00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:54.400
so far we've mostly been beating up on the dissociation and association back in

688
00:45:54.730 --> 00:45:59.190
is most of the things we've disproven are things that involve that mechanism

689
00:45:59.191 --> 00:46:01.050
with the Tri Vaillant carbon intermediate,

690
00:46:01.260 --> 00:46:05.370
although it can happen and we're going to talk about it next day that go through

691
00:46:05.371 --> 00:46:07.710
the intermediate cad I am right.

692
00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:11.160
So there are some cases where it would flow applies,

693
00:46:11.161 --> 00:46:16.161
but the tougher problem is to distinguish between concerted and association

694
00:46:16.891 --> 00:46:21.891
dissociation with a very weakly stabilized pentavalent intermediate.

695
00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:26.310
Uh,
so there's some stuff on the course website about that,

696
00:46:26.580 --> 00:46:31.230
but the question is might there be a pentavalent intermediate instead of the

697
00:46:31.231 --> 00:46:35.400
concerted transition state?
So here's the transition state,

698
00:46:35.430 --> 00:46:39.510
which is an energy maximum and here's the pentavalent intermediate.

699
00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:43.440
So there would be nothing to see at the transition state here.

700
00:46:43.441 --> 00:46:46.380
It wouldn't last any time is just passing through.

701
00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:50.310
But if there were a little dimple up at the top,

702
00:46:50.670 --> 00:46:55.650
there could be some stability.
That is,
that is a stable pentavalent carbon.

703
00:46:56.340 --> 00:47:00.870
Uh,
but does it exist?
You can see that if it got,

704
00:47:01.070 --> 00:47:05.730
it would merge smoothly into the one if it just had a teeny tiny dimple or a

705
00:47:05.731 --> 00:47:08.070
little bit bigger dibble.
If we're big enough,

706
00:47:08.310 --> 00:47:11.580
you might be able to prepare it under some circumstances where you could

707
00:47:11.581 --> 00:47:16.290
actually see it say an x ray.
Right?
But if it's too small,

708
00:47:16.470 --> 00:47:17.580
you're never going to see it.

709
00:47:18.150 --> 00:47:21.180
You might be able to try to calculate it by quantum mechanics.

710
00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:25.410
So the question is,
is there an example of a pentavalent carbon?

711
00:47:25.860 --> 00:47:30.860
So by quantum mechanics they said that that for water displacing a h two o,

712
00:47:33.490 --> 00:47:36.470
so that cad ion that,
that,
uh,

713
00:47:36.490 --> 00:47:40.450
symmetrical compound there is actually a transition state,

714
00:47:40.451 --> 00:47:44.980
not an intermediate.
It goes downhill if you,
if you distort linkedin,

715
00:47:44.981 --> 00:47:46.630
one bond and short than the other.

716
00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:51.040
And the same is true in the anti and if these are of course calculations of

717
00:47:51.041 --> 00:47:53.230
isolated materials.
So gas phase,

718
00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:58.050
if you have OAH minus come in and displace,
Ooh,
minus that one.

719
00:47:58.150 --> 00:48:01.150
Quantum mechanics also says is a transition state,

720
00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:05.920
but neither reaction is practical in the laboratory.
So the question is,

721
00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:07.750
what does experiments say?

722
00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:12.880
Can you do X-ray's studies and actually see whether there might be a stable

723
00:48:12.881 --> 00:48:16.360
pentavalent may be very transiently stable,

724
00:48:16.570 --> 00:48:21.100
very weakly stabilized,
but might that pentavalent compound be stable?

725
00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:25.000
So that's what we'll talk about the x-ray material next time.
