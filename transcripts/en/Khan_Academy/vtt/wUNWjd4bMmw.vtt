00:00:00.707 --> 00:00:02.195
Voiceover:So we have three different

00:00:02.195 --> 00:00:03.346
function definitions here.

00:00:03.346 --> 00:00:06.579
This is F of X in blue, here
we map between different

00:00:06.579 --> 00:00:10.653
values of T and what G of T would be.

00:00:10.653 --> 00:00:13.996
So you could use this as
a definition of G of T.

00:00:13.996 --> 00:00:18.363
And here we map from X to H of X.

00:00:18.363 --> 00:00:20.025
So for example, when X is equal

00:00:20.025 --> 00:00:22.636
to three, H of X is equal to zero.

00:00:22.636 --> 00:00:26.204
When X is equal to one,
H of X is equal to two.

00:00:26.204 --> 00:00:27.424
And actually let me number

00:00:27.424 --> 00:00:30.459
this one, two, three, just like that.

00:00:30.459 --> 00:00:33.562
Now what I want to do in
this video is introduce you

00:00:33.562 --> 00:00:37.991
to the idea of composing functions.

00:00:37.991 --> 00:00:40.455
Now what does it mean
to compose functions?

00:00:40.455 --> 00:00:43.190
Well that means to build
up a function by composing

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.693
one function of other functions or I guess

00:00:46.693 --> 00:00:48.102
you could think of nesting them.

00:00:48.102 --> 00:00:49.446
What do I mean by that?

00:00:49.446 --> 00:00:53.641
Well, let's think about
what it means to evaluate

00:00:53.687 --> 00:00:57.138
F of, not X, but we're
going to evaluate F of,

00:00:57.138 --> 00:01:00.066
actually let's just start
with a little warm-up.

00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:07.443
Let's evaluate F of G of two.

00:01:07.443 --> 00:01:09.075
Now what do you think this is going to be

00:01:09.075 --> 00:01:10.514
and I encourage you to pause this video

00:01:10.514 --> 00:01:13.074
and think about it on your own.

00:01:13.074 --> 00:01:15.106
Well it seems kind of daunting at first,

00:01:15.106 --> 00:01:17.186
if you're not very
familiar with the notation,

00:01:17.186 --> 00:01:19.154
but we just have to
remember what a function is.

00:01:19.154 --> 00:01:20.402
A function is just a mapping from

00:01:20.402 --> 00:01:22.355
one set of numbers to another.

00:01:22.355 --> 00:01:24.739
So for example, when
we're saying G of two,

00:01:24.739 --> 00:01:27.971
that means take the number two, input it

00:01:27.971 --> 00:01:31.509
into the function G and
then you're going to get

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:36.454
an output which we are
going to call G of two.

00:01:36.454 --> 00:01:38.772
Now we're going to use
that output, G of two,

00:01:38.772 --> 00:01:41.507
and then input it into the function F.

00:01:41.507 --> 00:01:47.759
So we're going to input
it into the function F,

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.054
and what we're going to get is F

00:01:49.054 --> 00:01:55.881
of the thing that we
inputted, F of G of two.

00:01:55.881 --> 00:01:57.392
So let's just take it step by step.

00:01:57.392 --> 00:01:59.856
What is G of two?

00:01:59.856 --> 00:02:08.746
Well when T is equal to two,
G of two is negative three.

00:02:09.176 --> 00:02:15.135
So when I put negative three
into F, what am I going to get?

00:02:15.135 --> 00:02:22.430
Well, I'm going to get negative
three squared minus one,

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.118
which is nine minus one which
is going to be equal to eight.

00:02:27.118 --> 00:02:29.343
So this right over here is equal to eight.

00:02:29.343 --> 00:02:33.983
F of G of two is going
to be equal to eight.

00:02:33.983 --> 00:02:37.326
Now, what would, using
this same exact logic,

00:02:37.326 --> 00:02:46.869
what would F of H of two be?

00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:48.362
And once again, I encourage
you to pause the video

00:02:48.362 --> 00:02:50.730
and think about it on your own.

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.818
Well let's think about
it this way, instead of

00:02:53.818 --> 00:02:57.257
doing it using this little
diagram, here everywhere

00:02:57.257 --> 00:03:01.610
you see the input is X,
whatever the input is

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.355
you square it and minus one.

00:03:03.355 --> 00:03:06.682
Here the input is H of
two, and so we're going to

00:03:06.682 --> 00:03:10.234
take the input, which is H
of two, and we're going to

00:03:10.234 --> 00:03:17.065
square it and we're going to subtract one.

00:03:17.065 --> 00:03:21.241
So F of H of two is H of
two squared minus one.

00:03:21.241 --> 00:03:23.450
Now what is H of two?

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.698
When X is equal to two, H of two is one.

00:03:26.698 --> 00:03:32.297
So H of two is one, so since
H of two is equal to one,

00:03:32.297 --> 00:03:35.561
this simplifies two one squared minus one,

00:03:35.561 --> 00:03:37.513
well that's just going to be one minus one

00:03:37.513 --> 00:03:42.522
which is equal to zero.

00:03:42.522 --> 00:03:44.698
We could have done it
with the diagram way,

00:03:44.698 --> 00:03:46.826
we could have said, hey
we're going to input

00:03:46.826 --> 00:03:54.585
two into H, if you input
two into H you get one,

00:03:54.585 --> 00:03:57.321
so that is H of two right over here.

00:03:57.321 --> 00:04:00.762
So that is H of two, and then
we're going to input that

00:04:00.762 --> 00:04:09.770
into F, which is going
to give us F of one.

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:14.479
F of one is one squared
minus one, which is zero.

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:17.902
So this right over here is F of H of two.

00:04:18.394 --> 00:04:19.862
H of two is the input
into F, so the output

00:04:19.862 --> 00:04:27.062
is going to be F of our
input, F of H of two.

00:04:27.062 --> 00:04:29.526
Now we can go even further,
let's do a composite.

00:04:29.526 --> 00:04:35.111
Let's compose three of
these functions together.

00:04:35.111 --> 00:04:44.086
So let's take, and I'm doing
this on the fly a little bit,

00:04:44.086 --> 00:04:56.070
so I hope it's a good
result, G of F of two,

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.175
and let me just think
about this for one second.

00:04:59.175 --> 00:05:03.590
So that's going to be G of F of two,

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:09.704
and let's take H of G of
F of two, just for fun.

00:05:09.704 --> 00:05:12.167
Now we're really doing
a triple composition.

00:05:12.167 --> 00:05:13.718
So there's a bunch of
ways we could do this.

00:05:13.718 --> 00:05:19.398
One way is to just try to
evaluate what is F of two.

00:05:19.398 --> 00:05:26.183
Well F of two is going to be
equal to two squared minus one.

00:05:26.183 --> 00:05:28.711
It's going to be four minus one or three.

00:05:28.711 --> 00:05:32.870
So this is going to be equal to three.

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:35.238
Now what is G of three?

00:05:35.238 --> 00:05:41.787
G of three is when T is equal
to three, G of three is four.

00:05:41.787 --> 00:05:47.531
So G of three, this whole thing, is four.

00:05:47.531 --> 00:05:50.267
F of two is three, three of G is four.

00:05:50.267 --> 00:05:52.427
What is H of four?

00:05:52.427 --> 00:05:55.804
Well we can just look back
to our original graph here.

00:05:55.804 --> 00:05:59.787
When X is four, H of four is negative one.

00:05:59.787 --> 00:06:07.915
So H of G of F of two, is
just equal to negative one.

00:06:07.915 --> 00:06:10.492
So hopefully this you
somewhat familiar with how

00:06:10.492 --> 00:06:13.548
to evaluate the composition of functions.
