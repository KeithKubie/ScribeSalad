[APPLAUSE]

00:01:20.616 --> 00:01:26.902
&gt;&gt; Mr.President, as faculty marshal, I have the honor to declare the 120th commencement of

00:01:26.902 --> 00:01:32.547
Carnegie Mellon University, as authorized

&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:01:35.725 --> 00:01:45.725
[MUSIC]

00:01:57.442 --> 00:01:58.414
&gt;&gt; Please rise for

00:01:58.414 --> 00:02:03.438
the singing of our national anthem by
the vocal performance class of 2017.

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:19.399
&gt;&gt; [MUSIC]

00:03:48.241 --> 00:03:54.683
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:04:11.665 --> 00:04:12.722
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:04:15.825 --> 00:04:23.760
We are gathered in a wonderful place of
collaborative study, work and living.

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.980
Please be seated.

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:31.600
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:38.400
&gt;&gt; Together, all of us, we are diverse in our
fields of study, our talents and

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.220
our abilities, our ethnicities and
the places that we call home.

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.660
In light of a respect for others,
and with an acknowledgement

00:04:49.661 --> 00:04:54.705
of our differences,
I invite you to join me, if you are able,

00:04:54.705 --> 00:04:59.943
in a moment of silence as we quiet
our hearts in prayer in a posture

00:04:59.943 --> 00:05:04.808
of thankfulness for this day and
for the class of 2017.

00:05:12.147 --> 00:05:17.775
Almighty God, we gather today to
celebrate the diligent work and

00:05:17.775 --> 00:05:23.830
the dedication of the Carnegie
Mellon University class of 2017.

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:28.340
We pause for a moment to give thanks for

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.580
those who have helped these
students achieve this day.

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:38.955
For the parents, family,
friends, teachers,

00:05:38.955 --> 00:05:47.040
and any others who have been their
providers of support throughout the years.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:54.418
We choose this day to be grateful for
the vision and direction

00:05:54.418 --> 00:06:00.470
of those who helped make Carnegie Mellon
the institution it is today.

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:05.612
We give thanks to the leadership and
the administration, who continue to carry

00:06:05.612 --> 00:06:10.603
on the vision of having a transformative
impact on society through continual

00:06:10.603 --> 00:06:15.691
innovation in education, research,
creativity, and entrepreneurship.

00:06:18.379 --> 00:06:21.851
Continue to teach these students,
and us as well,

00:06:21.851 --> 00:06:24.290
to look with compassion on others.

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:32.950
Take away any arrogance or
hatred that may impact our view of others.

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:37.550
Give us the grace and
ability to love our neighbors and

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:40.510
to seek justice and
peace in all areas of life.

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:47.540
Bless these students as they enter
the next stages of their lives and

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:48.970
seek to reach their full potential.

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:56.050
Be with them as they take steps into
the known and into the unknown.

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:01.550
May all that they do, and
the decisions that they make,

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:06.180
honor you and the tradition of
Carnegie Mellon University.

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:10.741
We send them forth to impact
society in transformative ways,

00:07:10.741 --> 00:07:15.927
through their work, through their lives,
and their partnerships.

00:07:17.932 --> 00:07:22.530
Be with us this day and
let these students bring You glory.

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:25.751
Our heart is in the work.

00:07:25.751 --> 00:07:28.322
Amen.

00:07:28.322 --> 00:07:35.820
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:07:46.007 --> 00:07:47.884
&gt;&gt; Good morning, everyone!

00:07:47.884 --> 00:07:53.299
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; It's a good day for the graduates.

00:07:53.299 --> 00:07:56.727
Whoo!

00:07:56.727 --> 00:08:01.270
On behalf of the Board of Trustees,
Let me welcome you to the 120th

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:04.060
Commencement of
Carnegie Mellon University.

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:08.335
My name is Jim Rohr, and
it's my honor and pleasure to serve as

00:08:08.335 --> 00:08:13.122
the Board Chairman for
the 2017 Carnegie Mellon Commencement.

00:08:13.122 --> 00:08:16.060
To all the students who
are graduating today,

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:20.610
let me begin by congratulating
you on your achievement.

00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:24.649
This degree represents years of
hard work and self discipline,

00:08:24.649 --> 00:08:27.876
of discovery and
creativity and problem solving.

00:08:27.876 --> 00:08:30.670
I hope it has a little
fun included as well.

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:37.183
At Carnegie Mellon, a degree is
a sign that you have surpassed a high

00:08:37.183 --> 00:08:41.402
standard of accomplishment in science,
art, and ideas.

00:08:41.402 --> 00:08:44.803
And that you are ready to use
this knowledge in your lives and

00:08:44.803 --> 00:08:46.380
your future professions.

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:49.870
You are ready to take on the charge

00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:54.690
of continuing the long standing tradition
of doing the work that matters.

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.594
Congratulations to you all.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:04.940
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:12.680
&gt;&gt; I would also like to wish congratulations to the family members, and to the friends, mentors, faculty,

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:17.700
and staff who also take great pride in
what the graduates have accomplished.

00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:23.140
Graduation from a demanding academic
institution like Carnegie Mellon

00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:23.980
is a team effort.

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:27.272
These students couldn't
have done it without you.

00:09:27.272 --> 00:09:31.725
So I invite all of us to thank the support
team with a wonderful round of applause

00:09:31.725 --> 00:09:32.948
for the supporters.

00:09:32.948 --> 00:09:39.890
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:43.551
&gt;&gt; Now with us today at our 120th
Commencement are some faculty and

00:09:43.551 --> 00:09:47.640
students from Carnegie Mellon's
other locations around the world.

00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:54.601
I am particularly pleased to welcome
students from the CMU Silicon Valley

00:09:54.601 --> 00:09:59.634
campus, and all the way from
Rwanda in our CMU Africa program.

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:03.575
And also our first to Lakshmi Subramanian

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:08.490
CMU's Africa Student
Excellence Award Scholars.

00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:10.520
We are delighted to have
you here with us today.

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:14.420
As members of
the Carnegie Mellon community,

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:18.490
you are ambassadors of our distinguished,
distinctive university.

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:22.853
It was at Carnegie Mellon that you gained
solid grounding in your major field.

00:10:22.853 --> 00:10:27.271
And it was at Carnegie Mellon that you
collaborated with people whose backgrounds

00:10:27.271 --> 00:10:30.140
were very different from your own.

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:35.420
And it was at Carnegie Mellon that you
discovered new ideas about the world,

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:37.320
and, actually,
new aspects about yourselves.

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:43.350
As trustees, it's our job to uphold
the university's values, and

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:46.720
help CMU achieve further excellence
in fulfillment of those values.

00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:51.450
Many trustees are here on
the platform this morning, and

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:53.980
I would like them to stand and
be recognized.

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:54.556
Trustees?

00:10:54.556 --> 00:11:04.556
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:11:07.932 --> 00:11:10.108
&gt;&gt; This year, Carnegie Mellon has added to

00:11:10.108 --> 00:11:13.374
its impressive momentum with
a number of new initiatives and

00:11:13.374 --> 00:11:17.550
partnerships that are contributing to
the growth of knowledge in the world.

00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:22.216
And we're moving forward rapidly with
distinctive and collaborative education,

00:11:22.216 --> 00:11:26.422
ambitious research programs in areas
ranging from energy, data science,

00:11:26.422 --> 00:11:29.660
workings of the brain, and
even the science of learning.

00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:34.822
The campus footprint is growing,
with plans fully underway for

00:11:34.822 --> 00:11:38.898
spectacular new spaces designed
to make CMU a standard setter for

00:11:38.898 --> 00:11:41.357
the 21st century higher education.

00:11:41.357 --> 00:11:46.694
With emphasis on collaboration
fields across the enterprise,

00:11:46.694 --> 00:11:50.855
create problem solving,
as well as innovation.

00:11:50.855 --> 00:11:55.462
But behind all of this growth and
expansion is our dynamic president,

00:11:55.462 --> 00:12:00.616
who joined the university in 2013
from the National Science Foundation,

00:12:00.616 --> 00:12:04.925
and who has already had a tremendous
effect on this institution.

00:12:04.925 --> 00:12:08.402
It's my great privilege to
introduce the ninth president of

00:12:08.402 --> 00:12:11.345
Carnegie Mellon University,
Dr. Subra Suresh.

00:12:11.345 --> 00:12:20.471
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:12:20.471 --> 00:12:22.211
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:12:22.211 --> 00:12:24.997
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:12:24.997 --> 00:12:29.510
&gt;&gt; Good morning everyone and
congratulations graduates.

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:32.378
I'm going to be saying that a few times.

00:12:32.378 --> 00:12:36.808
Commencement is always a special day for

00:12:36.808 --> 00:12:40.600
family, friends, and faculty.

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:45.023
But more than anything
else it is a milestone for

00:12:45.023 --> 00:12:50.013
each of you, the graduates,
the class of 2017.

00:12:50.013 --> 00:12:56.804
We are here to celebrate your
accomplishments over the past four years.

00:12:56.804 --> 00:12:59.955
Or five years if you're from
the School of Architecture.

00:12:59.955 --> 00:13:06.515
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; You worked hard to get here,

00:13:06.515 --> 00:13:12.637
and we are very proud and
honored to salute you today.

00:13:12.637 --> 00:13:16.238
Let me also express my
deep appreciation for

00:13:16.238 --> 00:13:20.813
the Carnegie Mellon University Board
of Trustees, and

00:13:20.813 --> 00:13:24.412
to the Chairman of the Board,
Jim Rohr, for

00:13:24.412 --> 00:13:29.401
all their energy, vision,
friendship and leadership.

00:13:29.401 --> 00:13:37.083
With their help,
CMU is poised to have a bright future.

00:13:37.083 --> 00:13:39.358
Thank you, Jim, and thank you, trustees.

00:13:39.358 --> 00:13:45.596
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:13:45.596 --> 00:13:51.003
&gt;&gt; I would like to also recognize a number
of alumni groups in attendance today.

00:13:51.003 --> 00:13:56.891
The 2017 Distinguished Alumni Award
honorees,

00:13:56.891 --> 00:14:02.530
the class of 1967 50th reunion celebrants.

00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:08.734
And, of course, our legacy families.

00:14:08.734 --> 00:14:13.765
Just to give you an idea,
yesterday morning when

00:14:13.765 --> 00:14:21.017
we met with the 50th reunion class,
a number of things had changed.

00:14:21.017 --> 00:14:25.001
A postage stamp was 5 cents in 1967,

00:14:25.001 --> 00:14:30.848
today it's 49 cents, and
it says forever if you can believe it.

00:14:30.848 --> 00:14:38.881
Carnegie Mellon's endowment at that time
was $75 million, it's much greater now.

00:14:38.881 --> 00:14:43.366
There are many, many more things
that have happened since '67, but

00:14:43.366 --> 00:14:47.925
the best news of all is that,
with every incoming class, the quality and

00:14:47.925 --> 00:14:52.490
impact of Carnegie Mellon education
has increased substantially, and

00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:55.602
you represent the very
best of Carnegie Mellon.

00:14:55.602 --> 00:14:58.716
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:03.380
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:07.420
&gt;&gt; CMU is a beloved tradition in so
many families, and we are also

00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:11.880
pleased to see successive generations
of family members attending CMU.

00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:15.950
All CMU alumni here today

00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:19.620
are specially designated by
the blue stoles they are wearing.

00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:23.240
We are happy to see so
many of you back here.

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:29.084
Would all CMU alumni in attendance
please stand and be recognized?

00:15:29.084 --> 00:15:39.084
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:15:42.850 --> 00:15:45.687
&gt;&gt; It's wonderful to have you here, and

00:15:45.687 --> 00:15:50.032
I hope our new graduates today
continue this tradition and

00:15:50.032 --> 00:15:52.968
return to Commencement in the future.

00:15:52.968 --> 00:15:58.930
One alumna who our new graduates
should get to know Is our

00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:05.440
Alumni Association Board President Debbie
Yue, Dietrich College Class of 1989.

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:11.550
Debbie joined
the Alumni Association Board in 2010 and

00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:13.370
began her term nearly a year ago.

00:16:14.490 --> 00:16:17.670
While she was earning her Bachelor's
degree in Technical Writing at

00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:21.680
Carnegie Mellon,
she was a reporter for the Tartan and

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:23.640
was active in the pre-law society.

00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:29.830
Now a partner at the firm of
Gallagher Sharp in Cleveland, Ohio, Debbie

00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:34.310
has been an active volunteer for the
Northeast Ohio Alumni Networks since 2007.

00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:38.730
Having served previously
as network president.

00:16:38.730 --> 00:16:42.690
She also volunteers as a Carnegie Mellon
admission interviewer and

00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:46.710
is active in a number of professional and
community organizations.

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:50.440
And since taking office,

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:54.640
she's been an outstanding representative
of all Carnegie Mellon alumni.

00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:59.370
I would like to invite Debbie
now to the podium, Debbie.

00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:05.240
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:10.660
&gt;&gt; Thank you, President Suresh, and
congratulations to the Class of 2017 and

00:17:10.663 --> 00:17:14.490
welcome to the Carnegie Mellon
alumni family.

00:17:14.490 --> 00:17:16.619
As you begin the next
chapter of your lives,

00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:23.900
please remember that you are now lifelong
members of the Carnegie Mellon community.

00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:28.090
Therefore, wear your Carnegie Mellon
clothing, bring your CMU mugs to work and

00:17:28.090 --> 00:17:30.730
be proud to be part of
such an amazing group.

00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:35.900
Although Carnegie Mellon alums make up
only a small percentage of the world's

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:41.310
population, our contributions are great,
and our impact enormous.

00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:46.000
We just celebrated the achievement in
service of a few of our dedicated and

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.440
talented alums at the alumni
awards ceremony on Friday

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:53.130
and I was inspired not only
by their achievement, but

00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:58.640
by their incredible passion for Carnegie
Mellon, even 60 years after graduation.

00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:02.380

Be supportive of each other as well as for
those who are following in your footsteps.

00:18:33.050 --> 00:18:37.223
And always go outside
of your comfort zone and

00:18:37.223 --> 00:18:40.469
embrace your vision for the future.

00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:18.300
On behalf of the Carnegie Mellon
Alumni Association and Board,

00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:23.075

member of the Carnegie Mellon community,
serving as founding president of Colors at

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:19.810
CMU, a student organization that promotes
open conversations on race and diversity.

00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:26.270

And is an Andrew Carnegie Society Scholar,

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:45.430
a distinction bestowed upon
only 40 graduating seniors.

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:48.880
The daughter of a Haitian immigrant,

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:54.220
Crystal plans to complete a Master of
Global Affairs with a concentration in

00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:59.218
public policy at Shanghai University
in Beijing, China and

00:20:59.218 --> 00:21:04.310
work to address barriers to healthcare
faced by immigrant families.

00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:09.407
It was a great pleasure for
me this morning to meet Crystal's parents.

00:21:09.407 --> 00:21:11.850
Crystal, I would like to now
invite you to the podium.

00:21:11.850 --> 00:21:22.122
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:21:22.122 --> 00:21:22.975
&gt;&gt; Hi everyone.

00:21:27.626 --> 00:21:31.390
Five years ago,
I came to CMU as a high school student.

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:35.940
I was here for the university's
Summer Academy of Math and

00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:38.400
Science or SAMS for short.

00:21:40.150 --> 00:21:44.420
Now, I didn't know that Carnegie Mellon,
or that SAMS,

00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:48.020
excuse me, was a program for
minority students.

00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:51.830
And the entire time, I was surrounded
by people who look like me.

00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:56.200
So I left thinking, this is great.

00:21:56.200 --> 00:22:01.035
Carnegie Mellon University, a historically
black college for math and science, right?

00:22:01.035 --> 00:22:03.105
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; I'm totally going here.

00:22:08.417 --> 00:22:14.292
[LAUGH] Even though CMU wasn't
exactly what I expected,

00:22:14.292 --> 00:22:18.670
I'm still so glad I decided to come here.

00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:21.730
I have learned so

00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:27.192
much while here at Carnegie Melon,
and not just academically.

00:22:27.192 --> 00:22:32.020
Problem solving,
how to hold difficult conversations,

00:22:33.450 --> 00:22:39.130
and most importantly, I now know there's
still so much more that I don't know.

00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:42.140
What drives people?

00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:45.010
How do our environments influence us?

00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:49.380
How is our world interconnected?

00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:52.580
I've started to think
about these questions,

00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:56.580
because I've been fortunate
enough to meet many of you.

00:22:56.580 --> 00:23:01.120
And getting to know your stories,
your perspectives and

00:23:01.132 --> 00:23:06.495
the way you think about things,
I've been blown away.

00:23:09.183 --> 00:23:13.611
As someone who came from a town where high
school students thought they couldn't go

00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:17.240
to college if they didn't have the money.

00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:19.680
As someone whose pediatrician told her,

00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:24.580
at least one of us made it
out of this worthless place.

00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:28.900
As someone whose relative told her,

00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:33.402
isn't Carnegie Mellon a bit
too advanced for you?

00:23:33.402 --> 00:23:37.679
I am immensely proud to
be a part of this campus.

00:23:37.679 --> 00:23:40.783
And I am so
proud to be able to walk with you today.

00:23:40.783 --> 00:23:50.783
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:23:54.693 --> 00:23:56.559
&gt;&gt; But what now?

00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:59.300
We're about to leave the CMU bubble.

00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:03.220
Some of us may start working and
receive nice paychecks.

00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:07.275
Some of us may go onto graduate school,
and receive all right paychecks.

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:11.700
[LAUGH] And
some of us may take a well-deserved break.

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:14.920
But what, then?

00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:21.360
Instead of thinking about the next
achievement, now's our opportunity

00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:28.340
to reflect on purpose as we enter
the next stage of our life.

00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:32.620
Purpose, the reason we exist.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.560
Maybe Carnegie Mellon has already
helped you find your purpose.

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:39.360
Maybe you're just getting started.

00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:44.660
We should reflect on purpose
because it develops us,

00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:49.080
keeps us resilient and
can lead us to happiness.

00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:55.360
So how do we crystallize purpose, or
even find purpose in the first place?

00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:57.560
We help others.

00:24:59.175 --> 00:25:04.180
We are driven by the need
to impact others.

00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:06.300
We're social animals, after all.

00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:09.340
I'm a biology major, trust me.

00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:18.160
So what's the relationship between
purpose, helping others and happiness?

00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:23.760
Well, to me,
there are three levels of happiness.

00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:29.380
First, you can get happiness
from simply building something.

00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:35.560
Then there's a second level of happiness
when people praise what you have built.

00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:39.920
And then there's this
third level of happiness,

00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:46.620
when someone tells you what you
have built has changed my life.

00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:50.960
That level of happiness
just can't be beat.

00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:55.430
And the path that makes you feel
the most fulfilled, the path that

00:25:55.430 --> 00:26:02.500
gives you the greatest happiness,
can give you insight on purpose.

00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:07.980
We've already been practicing,
impacting the lives of others.

00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:14.691
We've overloaded, become execs on boards,
volunteered for 1000plus, tutored,

00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:20.900
TAed, researched,
strived because CMU is a striving place.

00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:25.760
We're a bunch of overachievers who've been
presented with so many opportunities,

00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:30.140
and have been encouraged to learn.

00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:35.660
Now's our time to put
practice into action.

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:39.066
Continue to strive.

00:26:39.066 --> 00:26:41.840
Continue to aspire.

00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:47.996
And as you leave here today,
center your life around purpose.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.240
Center your life around impacting others.

00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:54.620
Let purpose guide you.

00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:58.760
And to everyone who
helped us along the way,

00:26:58.770 --> 00:27:02.662
mentors who guided us
throughout the process,

00:27:02.662 --> 00:27:07.525
faculty members who helped to
see just what we could do, and

00:27:07.525 --> 00:27:13.384
loved ones who have been with us and
encouraged us every step of the way.

00:27:13.384 --> 00:27:15.173
Thank you.

00:27:15.173 --> 00:27:18.946
And thank you, class of 2017.

00:27:18.946 --> 00:27:22.693
I know you'll do great things, thank you.

00:27:22.693 --> 00:27:32.693
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:27:37.511 --> 00:27:39.760
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Kristal.

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:43.920
&gt;&gt; Now we come to the presentation of
special doctor's degrees awarded to honor

00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:48.840
individuals who have had extraordinary
impact in areas that reflect

00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:53.733
Carnegie Mellon's trends in the arts,
sciences,

00:27:53.733 --> 00:27:58.140
scholarship, and society.

00:27:58.140 --> 00:28:01.830
Recipients of these honorary
degrees have in common

00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:06.320
a notable record of achievement
in their chosen fields.

00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:10.770
And they each have made in their own
domains substantial contributions to

00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:15.060
the advancement of knowledge,
the enrichment of the arts and

00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:20.510
culture, and
to bettering the well-being of humanity.

00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:25.360
Provost Farnam Jahanian will
present each candidate and

00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:28.540
cite the achievements
that merit this honor.

00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:33.075
Then all candidates will together receive
their degrees and their doctoral hoods.

00:28:33.075 --> 00:28:34.359
Farnam.

00:28:40.981 --> 00:28:44.269
&gt;&gt; Good morning, class of 2017.

00:28:44.269 --> 00:28:45.756
&gt;&gt; Good morning.
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:45.756 --> 00:28:46.760
&gt;&gt; No, no, you don't understand.

00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:47.960
This is a celebration.

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:49.053
We're gonna try this again.

00:28:49.053 --> 00:28:52.675
Good morning, class of 2017.

00:28:52.675 --> 00:28:54.820
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Much better.

00:28:56.630 --> 00:29:00.260
&gt;&gt; Let me add my warm
welcome to all of you and

00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:06.240
extend my congratulations
to the class of 2017.

You're highly celebrated for your study
of the disparity between conscious

00:29:37.313 --> 00:29:43.170
expression of attitudes and beliefs, and
our less conspicuous implicit behavior.

00:29:44.690 --> 00:29:48.323
You have been the recipient
of numerous accolades for

00:29:48.323 --> 00:29:55.300
your work as a social scientist, professor
and senior adviser at Harvard University.

00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:58.880

acclaim to this university throughout
your history-making career.

00:31:21.878 --> 00:31:28.234
Shortly after earning your bachelor's
degree in 1944, yes, 1944.

00:31:28.234 --> 00:31:35.365
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:31:35.365 --> 00:31:39.624
&gt;&gt; You became the first African American
librarian at Carnegie Library of

00:31:39.624 --> 00:31:43.659
Pittsburgh, then went on to become
the first black president of

00:31:43.659 --> 00:31:49.414

&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:24.360
&gt;&gt; While living in New York, your love for artistic expression led you and

00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:29.400
your husband to start a collection
of Haitian and African-American art.

00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:32.040
Today, the Hewitt Collection

00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:36.760
is recognized as one of the finest
collections of its kind in the world.

00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:39.390

plumbing supply store, led you to become

00:35:30.970 --> 00:35:33.120

&gt;&gt; Meg Whitman,

And your leadership at eBay led
to a truly remarkable expansion.

00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:25.879
Under your direction, the e-commerce
company grew from 30 employees and

00:37:25.879 --> 00:37:30.241
4 million in annual revenue to
more than 15,000 employees and

00:37:30.241 --> 00:37:32.208

&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:25.220
Business leader, political activist,

00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:31.560
philanthropist, these are all
descriptions of Meg Whitman,

00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:36.979
one of the most successful business
executives in the world today.

00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:43.020
Since 2011, she's been president, CEO

00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:51.240
and/or chairman of Hewlett-Packard and
since 2015 she's been the CEO and

00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:54.640
President of
Hewlett-Packard Enterprise and

00:39:54.640 --> 00:40:01.680
chairman of HP Inc. Board of Directors.

00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:07.917
As someone who knows her from
serving on that board at HP Inc.,

00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:14.589
I can tell you, no one just shows up and
becomes president, CEO and

00:40:14.589 --> 00:40:20.700
Chairman of one of the world's
most important corporations.

00:40:20.704 --> 00:40:24.504
In a business world
overwhelmingly run by men,

00:40:24.504 --> 00:40:29.254
Meg Whitman has earned every accolade,
and has repeatedly

00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:36.100
demonstrated the benefit of pursuing
new and unexpected challenges.

00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:40.473
Having been an accomplished
high school student athlete,

00:40:40.473 --> 00:40:44.792
Meg set her sights on becoming
a physician when she enrolled at

00:40:44.792 --> 00:40:49.044
Princeton just a few years after
women were first admitted.

00:40:49.044 --> 00:40:56.660
But a summer spent selling magazine
advertising revealed her true calling.

00:40:56.880 --> 00:41:01.080
This drove her to pursue her
Bachelor's degree in economics, and

00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:03.840
then an MBA from Harvard.

00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:07.739
Meg's path from there is meteoric.

00:41:07.739 --> 00:41:12.306
She joined Procter &amp; Gamble where
she worked with Steve Case,

00:41:12.306 --> 00:41:15.400
who later founded AOL.

00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:21.080
She took a position with Bain &amp; Company,
where she rose to Senior Vice President.

00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:25.400
And along the way worked with Mitt Romney,
who would later become Governor of

00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:29.700
Massachusetts and compete for
the presidency of the United States.

00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:33.100
Meg then served as
an executive with Disney,

00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:37.860
Stride Rite, FTD, and Hasbro

00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:44.260
before taking the helm of a fledgling
company that made her a household name.

00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:48.880
AuctionWeb is probably not
the name you were expecting.

00:41:49.020 --> 00:41:54.670
But under ten years of her leadership,
Meg Whitman grew AuctionWeb

00:41:54.670 --> 00:42:00.320
into a multibillion dollar global
phenomenon, now known as eBay,

00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:05.095
that has revolutionized
the way humanity trades goods.

00:42:05.095 --> 00:42:10.588
Not content to rest on her laurels, Meg
started a charitable foundation that has

00:42:10.588 --> 00:42:17.480
focused much of its giving on addressing
global warming and ecosystem restoration.

00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:22.650
She's also dabbled in politics,
running an historic campaign for

00:42:22.650 --> 00:42:25.460
governor of California in 2010.

00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:30.180
In fact, The New York Times singled her
out as one of the women most likely

00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:35.020
to become the first female
President of the United States.

00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:42.908
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Since 2011,

00:42:42.908 --> 00:42:48.759
Meg has worked tirelessly at
Hewlett-Packard Company and

00:42:48.759 --> 00:42:55.905
Hewlett-Packard Enterprise after
their historic split in 2015.

00:42:55.905 --> 00:43:00.755
I give you the person Forbes Magazine
named the 20th Most Powerful Woman in

00:43:00.755 --> 00:43:02.433
the World, Meg Whitman.

00:43:02.433 --> 00:43:11.513
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Well,

00:43:11.513 --> 00:43:17.258
President Suresh, members of the class
of 2017, members of the faculty,

00:43:17.258 --> 00:43:22.780
distinguished guests,
fellow recipients of honorary degrees.

00:43:22.780 --> 00:43:25.870
Families of the graduating class,
ladies and

00:43:25.870 --> 00:43:29.760
gentleman, it's a true
honor to be with you today.

00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:32.700
And it's a great privilege
to receive an honorary

00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:35.780
Doctor of Business Practice degree.

00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:39.853
And I am grateful to be earning
my degree in a lot less time and

00:43:39.860 --> 00:43:45.660
with a lot fewer all-nighters than
it took many of you to earn yours.

00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:51.660
To the parents of the graduating class
of 2017, it is a magnificent and

00:43:51.670 --> 00:43:56.570
memorable day when your child
graduates from college.

00:43:56.570 --> 00:43:59.720
It certainly is a wonderful day for you.

00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:03.452
And I'm guessing that for
many of you parents,

00:44:03.452 --> 00:44:07.292
it's a pretty good day for
your wallets as well.

00:44:07.292 --> 00:44:11.810
Congratulations for having traveled
this journey with your children.

00:44:11.810 --> 00:44:15.900
A journey that began not with their
enrollment at this university, but

00:44:15.900 --> 00:44:18.360
at the moment of their birth.

00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:20.880
Whether your children fully realized it or

00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:27.060
not, whether they have fully expressed
it to you or not, and they will.

00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:31.860
They would not be here today
without your love and support and

00:44:31.864 --> 00:44:34.202
encouragement along the way.

00:44:34.202 --> 00:44:36.203
So congratulations to the parents.

00:44:36.203 --> 00:44:43.530
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:44:43.530 --> 00:44:46.840
&gt;&gt; Most important to the class of 2017,

00:44:46.840 --> 00:44:49.240
congratulations.

00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:53.180
Graduating from college is
an impressive achievement, but

00:44:53.180 --> 00:44:57.690
especially graduating from one of
the leading universities in the world,

00:44:57.690 --> 00:45:02.880
an institution characterized by
high standards and excellence.

00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:06.620
One that has produced
winners of Nobel Prizes, and

00:45:06.620 --> 00:45:11.900
Turing, Tony, Emmy, and
Academy Award winners.

00:45:12.300 --> 00:45:17.380
Carnegie Mellon University has
prepared you for a life of purpose and

00:45:17.385 --> 00:45:22.770
meaning, and there are people and
moments you will never forget.

00:45:22.770 --> 00:45:27.720
Including, I understand,
the Spring Carnival, which includes what

00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:34.740
I gather are some pretty amazing amusement
park rides, booths, and buggy races.

00:45:35.020 --> 00:45:39.360
To bag piping, which the school
has made into an art form,

00:45:39.377 --> 00:45:43.482
and to my personal favorite,
the Band Without Pants.

00:45:43.482 --> 00:45:47.979
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; A tradition unique to Carnegie Mellon,

00:45:47.979 --> 00:45:51.734
and I'm confident I can say one
you are unlikely to encounter

00:45:51.740 --> 00:45:54.700
in your first full-time job.

00:45:56.060 --> 00:46:01.360
You are graduating at a moment of
great challenge for our nation.

00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:06.670
When our country will decide on matters
having to do not with just commerce,

00:46:06.670 --> 00:46:08.420
but conscience.

00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:13.620
Not just with what we will gain,
but what we will give.

00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:19.640
Not just with our military power,
but with our deepest ideals.

00:46:19.940 --> 00:46:24.400
This is hardly the most difficult
moment in American history.

00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:29.640
I believe you can safely argue that
the Civil War, two World Wars,

00:46:29.642 --> 00:46:33.587
and the Great Depression
have us beat by a long shot.

00:46:33.587 --> 00:46:36.665
You are a blessed generation in so
many ways,

00:46:36.665 --> 00:46:41.220
with opportunities unimaginable
to past generations.

00:46:41.220 --> 00:46:45.960
And gratitude is one of
the hallmarks of a fulfilled life.

00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:51.600
But every life has hardships,
every generation faces obstacles.

00:46:51.619 --> 00:46:56.515
And we are in the midst of
a profoundly important moment

00:46:56.515 --> 00:47:00.462
in the political and
civic life of America.

00:47:00.462 --> 00:47:05.440
The challenges today are more
from within than without.

00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:10.139
And I believe this is a moment that,
if we do not handle it well,

00:47:10.139 --> 00:47:15.018
could produce harmful effects on
my generation and on yours, and

00:47:15.018 --> 00:47:17.169
on generations yet unborn.

00:47:17.169 --> 00:47:20.440
The stakes are that serious.

00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:26.060
So today I wanna speak about some
disturbing trends in our national life.

00:47:26.260 --> 00:47:30.660
Trends that need to be challenged
by people of both genders,

00:47:30.660 --> 00:47:35.320
every class, race, and ethnic background.

00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:41.220
Of every political party and ideology,
but most especially by young people.

00:47:41.620 --> 00:47:48.020
Who are not only inheritors of the future,
but will do so much to shape it.

00:47:48.022 --> 00:47:53.483
The first disturbing trend I want
to mention is the attack on truth.

00:47:53.483 --> 00:47:58.249
There are many people these days,
including people at the highest level in

00:47:58.249 --> 00:48:02.525
public life-
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:48:02.525 --> 00:48:07.967
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:07.967 --> 00:48:12.400
&gt;&gt; Who use lies to devalue truth.

00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:16.320
Those who are part of this effort
like describing what's happening

00:48:16.330 --> 00:48:20.685
euphemistically using phrases
like alternative facts.

00:48:20.685 --> 00:48:25.488
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; But we know better to paraphrase

00:48:25.488 --> 00:48:31.872
Shakespeare's Juliet,
a lie by any other name is still a lie.

00:48:31.872 --> 00:48:35.524
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]

00:48:35.524 --> 00:48:40.390
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:40.390 --> 00:48:41.400
&gt;&gt; What is so

00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:46.470
striking is the brazenness and
rapidity of the lies and their purpose

00:48:46.470 --> 00:48:52.260
Which is to de-legitimize sources of
information hostile to those in power.

00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:57.020
The lies tumble down like
rocks in an avalanche.

00:48:57.140 --> 00:49:03.420
They are not subtle, they are overt,
obvious, and part of a conscious effort.

00:49:03.580 --> 00:49:08.692
Language is being employed not to
reveal reality, but to obscure it,

00:49:08.700 --> 00:49:13.390
not to simply mislead people but
to disorient them,

00:49:13.390 --> 00:49:19.640
to assert power over truth in
an effort to deconstruct it.

00:49:19.780 --> 00:49:23.400
So here's why this should matter to you.

00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:29.320
If we do not share a common reality,
we can't reason together.

00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:33.100
Truth creates restraints on power.

00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:39.010
If we allow those with power to
control the very idea of truth itself,

00:49:39.010 --> 00:49:43.420
then we cannot identify and
stand against injustice.

00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:46.780
And if we can't identify injustice,

00:49:46.786 --> 00:49:52.313
then we cannot replace it with
concepts like equality under law,

00:49:52.313 --> 00:49:57.149
respect, decency, compassion,
and justice itself.

00:49:57.149 --> 00:50:05.790
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:50:05.790 --> 00:50:08.330
&gt;&gt; A great university is always enlisted

00:50:08.330 --> 00:50:13.710
against the spread of illusion, and on the
side of reality, said President Kennedy.

00:50:13.710 --> 00:50:18.840
And that is the essence of your calling
as graduates of a great university.

00:50:18.980 --> 00:50:24.340
My encouragement to you is to be women and
men who stand for truth.

00:50:24.460 --> 00:50:29.460
Who spend your life in search of it,
even if you never fully know it.

00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:33.420
Who believe in inquiries,
in facts, in objective reality.

00:50:33.423 --> 00:50:38.114
And who have the courage to speak
truth to power even when there may be

00:50:38.114 --> 00:50:39.465
a cost to doing so.

00:50:39.465 --> 00:50:49.013
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; If you do,

00:50:49.013 --> 00:50:54.390
if you are defenders of truth in an age
marked by lies, it will have a liberating

00:50:54.390 --> 00:51:01.680
effect on our fellow citizens and make
more possible all good things in life.

00:51:01.880 --> 00:51:06.820
A second truth that needs to be
confronted is the attack on free speech.

00:51:06.940 --> 00:51:09.780
&gt;&gt; In the last several years,-
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:51:09.788 --> 00:51:11.805
&gt;&gt; We have seen a powerful movement,

00:51:11.805 --> 00:51:15.030
one that seeks to shut down free speech,

00:51:15.030 --> 00:51:18.280
gain traction in the academy.

00:51:18.380 --> 00:51:22.000
The very institutions that were
created in order to allow for

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:24.860
the free exchange of ideas.

00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:29.150
On some campuses,
we've seen certain speakers not invited.

00:51:29.150 --> 00:51:31.220
On others, they've been shouted down.

00:51:31.220 --> 00:51:34.480
And on still others,
we are witnessing violence.

00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:39.940
Now I understand this kind of thing isn't
happening on most American campuses, but

00:51:39.940 --> 00:51:43.740
it's happening in too many places and
it needs to end.

00:51:44.020 --> 00:51:46.800
But there's something
else going on as well.

00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:50.720
College students are increasingly
demanding protection from words and

00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:53.090
speech they find offensive.

00:51:53.090 --> 00:51:57.610
We hear a lot about trigger warnings and
safe spaces which are designed to

00:51:57.610 --> 00:52:03.340
protect students from viewpoints that
they might find upsetting and unsettling.

00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:06.200
Here's why I think this is problematic.

00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:11.940
For one thing, I don't think most of you
want to be treated like porcelain dolls.

00:52:12.100 --> 00:52:15.450
And now that you are college graduates,
the rest of the world and

00:52:15.450 --> 00:52:19.120
certainly the business world
won't treat you that way.

00:52:19.120 --> 00:52:23.460
So no one is doing college students
any favors when they intellectually

00:52:23.460 --> 00:52:24.465
isolate them.

00:52:24.465 --> 00:52:33.270
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; But

00:52:33.270 --> 00:52:37.140
the issue extends beyond the walls of
the academy and matters whether or

00:52:37.140 --> 00:52:41.040
not you ever step foot on a campus again.

00:52:41.140 --> 00:52:45.820
While many of you are about to
complete your formal education, you will

00:52:45.830 --> 00:52:51.860
spend a lifetime continuing to learn,
gathering and processing new information

00:52:51.860 --> 00:52:56.900
and dealing with people with different
life experiences and points of view.

00:52:56.900 --> 00:53:02.240
Shutting down free speech, insulating
ourselves from hearing competing points of

00:53:02.244 --> 00:53:07.495
view is the equivalent of injecting poison
into the bloodstream of our republic.

00:53:07.495 --> 00:53:14.610
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:53:14.610 --> 00:53:18.880
&gt;&gt; John Stewart Mill in his 1859 classic,

00:53:18.880 --> 00:53:22.670
On Liberty,
put it as well as anyone ever has.

00:53:22.670 --> 00:53:28.050
And I quote,
he who knows only his own side of the case

00:53:28.050 --> 00:53:31.280
knows little of that, Mill wrote.

00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:36.280
His reason may be good and
no one may have been able to refute that.

00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:41.720
But if he is equally unable to refute
the reasons on the opposite side,

00:53:41.860 --> 00:53:46.450
if he does not so much as know what
they are, he has no ground for

00:53:46.450 --> 00:53:49.520
preferring either opinion.

00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:52.740
Mill went on to say this, nor is it enough

00:53:52.740 --> 00:53:57.580
that he should hear the opinions of
adversaries from his own teachers

00:53:57.580 --> 00:53:59.690
presented as they state them and

00:53:59.690 --> 00:54:03.210
accompanied by what they
offer as refutations.

00:54:03.210 --> 00:54:07.460
He must be able to hear from
persons who actually believe them.

00:54:07.460 --> 00:54:12.740
He must know them in their most
plausible and persuasive form.

00:54:13.080 --> 00:54:17.390
So my encouragement to you is to be
the men and women who stand up for

00:54:17.390 --> 00:54:20.010
free speech, who welcome debate.

00:54:20.010 --> 00:54:23.980
Who model for
others what genuine dialogue is, and

00:54:23.980 --> 00:54:26.990
who are not afraid to have
your beliefs challenged.

00:54:28.220 --> 00:54:34.020
Too many of us live in intellectual silos,
where we seek out people and

00:54:34.020 --> 00:54:38.850
information that simply
reinforces our existing opinions.

00:54:38.850 --> 00:54:42.100
Venture out of those silos.

00:54:42.100 --> 00:54:45.760
We are better when we are exposed
to different ideas and

00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:48.220
competing philosophies.

00:54:48.980 --> 00:54:54.640
Learn to listen in order to understand
others, not just to respond to them.

00:54:54.649 --> 00:54:57.801
And remain open to
the possibility that you may have

00:54:57.801 --> 00:55:00.840
something to learn from others.

00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:04.510
Be the generation that
embodies real tolerance,

00:55:04.510 --> 00:55:09.130
genuine inquiry and
authentic open mindedness.

00:55:09.130 --> 00:55:14.969
It is what this nation desperately needs
during this fractured and fractious time.

00:55:14.969 --> 00:55:24.370
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; The third

00:55:24.370 --> 00:55:28.780
trend that needs to be confronted
is the attack on civility.

00:55:28.860 --> 00:55:32.910
We live in an age of
escalating incivility.

00:55:32.910 --> 00:55:37.700
We see it all around us,
on our roads, in airways,

00:55:37.700 --> 00:55:42.870
in sports stadiums, and
on social media, and in politics.

00:55:42.870 --> 00:55:47.840
The problem has gotten worse recently,
with those running for high public office

00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:53.750
mocking reporters and demeaning
opponents with childish names or worse.

00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:55.460
It seems that no words,

00:55:55.460 --> 00:56:00.840
no matter how hurtful or cruel to
others are considered inappropriate.

00:56:00.980 --> 00:56:07.400
We are fostering the conditions in which
we view others not as opponents, but enemies.

00:56:07.460 --> 00:56:10.210
We're treating one another as subhuman and

00:56:10.210 --> 00:56:14.980
that's a terribly,
dangerous line to cross.

00:56:15.120 --> 00:56:21.620
Civility is more than nice manners, it's
a precondition of democratic dialogue,

00:56:21.620 --> 00:56:26.360
in the words of Professor Steven L. Carter
of Yale Law School.

00:56:26.520 --> 00:56:32.200
Civility is part of the, quote,
etiquette of democracy, unquote.

00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:36.330
It allows for genuine social interaction.

00:56:36.330 --> 00:56:40.550
It's been said that the true
genius of Martin Luther King Jr.

00:56:40.550 --> 00:56:46.240
was not his ability to argue
the pain of an oppressed people, but

00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:52.580
his ability to inspire those very people
to be loving and civil in their descent.

00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:57.270
We should treat each other with civility,
not because we agree with others, but

00:56:57.270 --> 00:57:01.800
because it is a measure of our respect for
human dignity.

00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:04.130
It's what we owe all people,

00:57:04.130 --> 00:57:08.510
including those with whom we
have fierce disagreements.

00:57:08.510 --> 00:57:11.020
Our institutions, our culture,

00:57:11.020 --> 00:57:16.600
our communities cannot be sustained let
alone thrive if civility is eroded.

00:57:16.600 --> 00:57:20.305
It is an essential democratic virtue.

00:57:20.305 --> 00:57:31.500
[APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Kingman Brewster, a former president of Yale,

00:57:31.580 --> 00:57:37.040
said, quote, the presumption of
innocence is not just a legal concept.

00:57:37.050 --> 00:57:41.420
In commonplace terms,
it rests on the generosity of spirit

00:57:41.420 --> 00:57:45.840
which assumes the best,
not the worst of a stranger.

00:57:45.920 --> 00:57:50.620
My encouragement to you is to be
the women and men who embody civility,

00:57:50.620 --> 00:57:56.620
who demonstrate a generosity of
spirit in an ungenerous time.

00:57:56.740 --> 00:58:03.660
And who assume the best, not the worst,
of the stranger, of those you do not know,

00:58:03.660 --> 00:58:07.940
people whose life experiences
are different than yours, and

00:58:07.940 --> 00:58:12.940
who may see the world in a dramatically
different way than you do.

00:58:13.060 --> 00:58:18.740
In doing so, you will make us
a more decent and just society.

00:58:19.680 --> 00:58:23.500
This country desperately needs
the skills you have developed

00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:26.210
during your years at Carnegie Mellon.

00:58:26.210 --> 00:58:31.380
But it needs something more than
your skills, it needs your ideals.

00:58:33.070 --> 00:58:35.630
You leave this great
university as better men and

00:58:35.630 --> 00:58:38.820
women than when you arrived,
more knowledgeable and

00:58:38.820 --> 00:58:44.120
better educated, I'm sure, but
I trust wiser and more hopeful.

00:58:44.460 --> 00:58:48.730
There's a beautiful line by William
Wordsworth in his poem The Prelude,

00:58:48.730 --> 00:58:53.720
in which he says, quote,
what we have loved others will love and

00:58:53.720 --> 00:58:56.000
we will teach them how.

00:58:56.060 --> 00:59:00.660
The faculty at CMU has taught
you what to know and love and

00:59:00.660 --> 00:59:05.540
now it is your turn to teach others
what you have come to know and love.

00:59:06.440 --> 00:59:09.500
I wish you all a life of joy and

00:59:09.500 --> 00:59:14.180
purpose, of success and
fulfillment, and congratulations

00:59:14.240 --> 00:59:16.660
to the great class of 2017.

00:59:16.660 --> 00:59:26.660
Thank you very much.
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:59:39.080 --> 00:59:43.720
&gt;&gt; Meg, thank you for

00:59:43.725 --> 00:59:46.865
your thoughtful and sobering remarks.

00:59:46.865 --> 00:59:55.140
We're not only inspired by your words but
also motivated by your example.

00:59:55.140 --> 00:59:58.590
It's been an honor to have
you as our keynote speaker.

00:59:58.590 --> 00:59:59.570
Thank you, again, Meg.

00:59:59.570 --> 01:00:06.677
Please join me, once again,
in thanking Meg Whitman.

01:00:06.677 --> 01:00:14.020
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; It is now my pleasure to

01:00:14.020 --> 01:00:19.940
recognize the faculty members who have
recently accepted emeritus status.

01:00:19.940 --> 01:00:26.774
Like all of our educators, these
distinguished individuals are scholars,

01:00:26.780 --> 01:00:32.280
scientists, artists and
above all, teachers.

01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:43.360
They have left an [LAUGH] indelible mark
on this university through the support and

01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:46.620
encouragement they have
provided to our students and

01:00:46.620 --> 01:00:51.020
through their legacy of
exceptional scholarship.

01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:56.160
The names of all retiring faculty will be
projected on this screen at this time.

01:00:56.340 --> 01:01:00.200
Those retiring faculty who
are present this morning,

01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:02.680
please stand as I read your name.

01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:06.980
Please hold your applause until
I have read all their names.

01:01:07.180 --> 01:01:11.820
Mark Fichman, Associate Professor
of Organizational Behavior and

01:01:11.820 --> 01:01:14.540
Theory, Tepper School of Business.

01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:20.660
Peggy Anne Knapp, Professor of English,
Dietrich College of Humanities and

01:01:20.660 --> 01:01:23.120
Social Sciences.

01:01:23.460 --> 01:01:25.500
Kenneth Kotovsky,

01:01:25.540 --> 01:01:32.940
Professor of Psychology, Dietrich College
of Humanities and Social Sciences.

01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:38.360
Gregory Lehane, Professor of Drama and
Music, College of Fine Arts.

01:01:39.730 --> 01:01:45.810
Mel Siegal, Associate Research Professor,
School of Computer Science.

01:01:45.810 --> 01:01:49.780
Please join me in thanking all of
Carnegie Mellon's emeriti faculty for

01:01:49.780 --> 01:01:52.550
their service and
dedication to the university.

01:01:56.865 --> 01:02:03.560
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:09.190
&gt;&gt; I would now like to recognize those faculty
members who were recently honored

01:02:09.190 --> 01:02:12.640
with the title of university professor.

01:02:12.660 --> 01:02:17.880
Being appointed a university professor
is one of the highest honors

01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:22.040
that a faculty member can
receive at Carnegie Mellon.

01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:28.400
Receiving this rank confers both honor and
obligation onto its recipients,

01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:32.180
and denotes a legacy of exceptional
contribution to education,

01:02:32.180 --> 01:02:37.020
artistic creativity and/or research.

01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:43.740
This prestigious group includes faculty
from all of our colleges and schools.

01:02:43.820 --> 01:02:47.880
I am pleased to announce that
three faculty members have joined

01:02:47.890 --> 01:02:50.750
these distinguished ranks this year.

01:02:50.750 --> 01:02:55.863
Nominated and recommended by academic
leaders and university professors,

01:02:55.863 --> 01:03:01.400
and promoted to University Professor
by President Suresh and me.

01:03:01.420 --> 01:03:05.000

completed their requirements of their
programs to the satisfaction and

01:04:00.940 --> 01:04:03.900
approval of their faculty members.

01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:05.720
[CHEERS]
&gt;&gt; You can clap, it's okay.

01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:10.740
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; The commencement

01:04:10.750 --> 01:04:14.460
program gives each student's
degree an area of study,

01:04:14.460 --> 01:04:19.460
which will be called out and celebrated
at departmental diploma ceremonies.

01:04:19.460 --> 01:04:21.900
I encourage families and
friends to look and

01:04:21.900 --> 01:04:25.590
listen beyond just your
own graduate's listing

01:04:25.590 --> 01:04:30.400
to get a sense of the unique educational
environment at Carnegie Mellon.

01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:34.200
The environment that makes this
institution so distinctive and

01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:36.900
this graduating class so exceptional.

01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:40.740
I wish to begin by acknowledging
the achievements of this year's

01:04:40.750 --> 01:04:42.960
group of doctoral candidates.

01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:47.950
These outstanding scholars received their
academic hoods at a special ceremony

01:04:47.950 --> 01:04:49.600
yesterday afternoon.

01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:53.820
In earning their doctorates, they have
made a commitment to a life of scholarly

01:04:53.830 --> 01:04:57.500
pursuits, and have reaffirmed
the importance and prominence of

01:04:57.500 --> 01:05:02.500
Carnegie Mellon as one of the nation's
premier research universities.

01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:07.540
I would invite the doctor's candidates
to please rise and be recognized.

01:05:07.540 --> 01:05:09.580
Doctor's candidates?

01:05:09.580 --> 01:05:19.580
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

01:05:21.260 --> 01:05:24.140

&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; That party must have lasted really,

01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:30.600

01:05:30.660 --> 01:05:31.840
Please be seated.

01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:35.460
There are some of them back there as well,

01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:40.980
In addition, we're pleased to
officially confer bachelor degrees

01:05:40.980 --> 01:05:46.040
to students graduating from
Carnegie Mellon University, Qatar campus.

01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:50.040
These students earned degrees from the
Dietrich College, the Mellon College of Science,

01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:55.020
the School of Computer Science,
and the Tepper Business School.

01:05:55.140 --> 01:06:00.810
At this time I want to recognize the Dean
of Carnegie Mellon University, at Qatar.

01:06:00.810 --> 01:06:06.320
Dean Ilker Baybars, who has been
an exemplary leader of campus in Doha,

01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:10.210
and who just completed his
last academic year as dean.

01:06:10.210 --> 01:06:16.560
For the past six years, Ilker has led the
CMU Q campus with honor and distinction,

01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:20.970
enhancing the CMU experience through
his passion for teaching and

01:06:20.970 --> 01:06:24.900
collaboration and
his dedication to students.

01:06:25.380 --> 01:06:29.795
Once a successor is named,
Ilker will resume his duties as

01:06:29.795 --> 01:06:36.375
George Leland Bach Professor of Operations
Management in Tepper School of Business,

01:06:36.375 --> 01:06:40.715
where he has been a member
of our faculty since 1978.

01:06:40.715 --> 01:06:45.620
Dean Baybars, thank you for your service
and please stand to be recognized.

01:06:45.620 --> 01:06:55.620
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

01:06:57.050 --> 01:06:58.210
&gt;&gt; Candidates,

01:06:58.210 --> 01:07:02.660
I'm gonna give you some
directions on what to do next.

&gt;&gt; We will ask each degree candidate from

01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:25.330
each college, to stand and be recognized
as you're called upon by your dean.

01:07:25.330 --> 01:07:29.750
When all schools and colleges have been
recognized, the President then asks all

01:07:29.750 --> 01:07:35.590
students to stand again at which time
he will formally confer your degrees.

01:07:35.590 --> 01:07:37.480
And don't be shy.

01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:44.740
Last year, we had a bit of a competition
for the most boisterous school or college.

01:07:45.320 --> 01:07:50.520
So let's hear your enthusiasm
as your dean calls on you.

01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:53.020
That's an open invitation.

01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:54.600
Are you with me?

01:07:54.602 --> 01:07:56.310
&gt;&gt; Yes.

01:07:56.310 --> 01:07:56.979
&gt;&gt;[APPLAUSE]

01:07:56.979 --> 01:07:59.441
&gt;&gt; If not, just follow the person next to you.

&gt;&gt; For

I will now call on the dean of each school
or college to present its candidate.

01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:24.100

On behalf of all the Deans and
Program Directors

01:18:21.780 --> 01:18:26.360
I will now present the candidates for
degrees from these special programs.

01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:28.545
Will all of the Bachelor's, Master's,

01:18:28.545 --> 01:18:32.500
and Doctoral candidates in our
interdisciplinary programs, please rise.

01:18:32.500 --> 01:18:41.400
&gt;&gt;[APPLAUSE]

01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:44.688
&gt;&gt; Mr President.

01:18:44.688 --> 01:18:49.780
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Upon the recommendation of our faculty,

01:18:49.780 --> 01:18:53.850
I have the honor of presenting these
candidates from our University-wide,

01:18:53.850 --> 01:18:57.440
Inter-College and Joint Degree Programs.

01:18:57.440 --> 01:19:01.020
I would ask these students
to remain standing

01:19:01.020 --> 01:19:04.140
and I would like to invite
students from all other

01:19:04.140 --> 01:19:09.100
colleges and
schools to stand once again, for

01:19:09.100 --> 01:19:14.780
the official conferral
degrees by President Suresh.

01:19:14.780 --> 01:19:22.760
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; By virtue of the authority granted

01:19:22.760 --> 01:19:25.140
to me by the Board of Trustees,

01:19:25.340 --> 01:19:29.630
I hereby confer these degrees
upon these candidates,

01:19:29.630 --> 01:19:35.580
with all the rights, honors, privileges
and responsibilities pertaining thereto.

01:19:35.820 --> 01:19:40.373
I'm pleased to join the deans and
the faculty of the entire university,

01:19:40.373 --> 01:19:41.948
in congratulating you.

01:19:41.948 --> 01:19:44.940
Congratulations, class of 2017.

01:19:44.940 --> 01:19:58.740
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

01:19:58.740 --> 01:20:00.460
&gt;&gt; Will all the new Bachelor's,

01:20:00.460 --> 01:20:03.850
Master's and Doctoral graduates

01:20:03.850 --> 01:20:08.715
and the new Alumni Association
members of Carnegie Mellon University,

01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:11.680
please be seated.

01:20:15.660 --> 01:20:18.691
I'm immensely proud to stand before you,

01:20:18.700 --> 01:20:24.560
the Carnegie Mellon University
graduating class of 2017.

01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:32.340
In my charge to you, the graduates,
I wish to focus on two themes.

01:20:32.700 --> 01:20:37.700
The number four, especially focusing
on the last four years of your

01:20:37.703 --> 01:20:41.733
presence here, and
some thoughts and suggestions for

01:20:41.733 --> 01:20:46.041
your career and
life beyond Carnegie Mellon University.

01:20:46.041 --> 01:20:51.540
Four years,
that's an interesting interval of time.

01:20:51.660 --> 01:20:57.420
Every four years we see a U.S.
Presidential Election,

01:20:57.420 --> 01:21:05.540
Olympic Games, a soccer World Cup,
and of course a leap year.

01:21:05.820 --> 01:21:10.820
Four years ago in the summer of 2013,
you arrived

01:21:10.820 --> 01:21:17.520
on this campus as freshmen,
accompanied by your family members.

01:21:17.660 --> 01:21:22.250
I had the enormous privilege and
honor of welcoming you to CMU

01:21:22.250 --> 01:21:25.830
at the orientation event on the Mall.

01:21:25.830 --> 01:21:29.600
I told you and
your parents at the time that like you,

01:21:29.620 --> 01:21:35.920
I had just arrived on campus as
a freshman to begin the journey with you.

01:21:36.040 --> 01:21:38.440
How many of you remember that?

01:21:38.440 --> 01:21:45.200
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; In the succeeding four years

01:21:45.380 --> 01:21:50.480
you have accomplished much in your
learning, your field of specialization,

01:21:50.480 --> 01:21:57.000
in your personal growth, in your teamwork,
and in your global perspectives.

01:21:57.100 --> 01:22:02.860
You have built valuable relationships with
your mentors and advisors, staff across

01:22:02.860 --> 01:22:09.740
campus, faculty members, department heads,
deans, coaches, alumni, and trustees.

01:22:09.820 --> 01:22:13.940
You've also contributed so
much to the fabric of this university and

01:22:13.940 --> 01:22:16.040
its rich heritage.

01:22:16.040 --> 01:22:21.160
As you walk the corridors of various
buildings, painted the Fence,

01:22:21.160 --> 01:22:25.270
strolled the cart,
pushed the buggy at carnival, or

01:22:25.270 --> 01:22:29.500
exhibited your enormous creativity and
technological prowess

01:22:29.500 --> 01:22:34.590
in formal classroom work,
in theater, music and art.

01:22:34.590 --> 01:22:39.370
In research and poetry, and
in presentations you produced and

01:22:39.370 --> 01:22:41.700
exhibited on campus,

01:22:41.800 --> 01:22:44.520
your determination to improve
the human condition and

01:22:44.520 --> 01:22:48.770
your compassion and humanity came through
in the numerous community service

01:22:48.770 --> 01:22:54.340
activities you initiated and
executed locally and around the world.

01:22:54.340 --> 01:22:59.458
My wife, Mary, and
I were privileged to host many of you on

01:22:59.458 --> 01:23:04.118
hundreds of occasions on campus and
at our residence for

01:23:04.120 --> 01:23:11.100
conversations, entertainment,
meals, and social interactions.

01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:17.540
And we came to see you not just as
students but as members of our family.

01:23:17.800 --> 01:23:22.900
We celebrated major achievements together,
and we came together to hold and

01:23:22.900 --> 01:23:29.780
support one another during times
of deep sorrow and tragedy.

01:23:29.780 --> 01:23:33.400
While our faculty continued to
garner international recognition for

01:23:33.413 --> 01:23:38.030
their research and creativity,
you, our graduates today,

01:23:38.030 --> 01:23:43.060
have also accomplished
much in these four years.

01:23:43.200 --> 01:23:48.140
Excelling in athletics,
creating artificial intelligence programs

01:23:48.140 --> 01:23:52.410
that defeated four of the world's
best professional poker players

01:23:52.410 --> 01:23:56.220
in a marathon 20-day poker competition.

01:23:56.220 --> 01:23:59.800
Winning the Putnam Competition,
the premier mathematics competition for

01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:02.265
undergraduate students in North America.

01:24:02.265 --> 01:24:05.570
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Competing

01:24:05.570 --> 01:24:10.000
against the best undergraduate
math students in the country.

01:24:10.260 --> 01:24:11.780
During your time here,

01:24:11.780 --> 01:24:16.340
your accomplishments helped
the University scale new heights.

01:24:16.420 --> 01:24:21.680
Thanks to the generosity of about 450
donors and the efforts of many members

01:24:21.680 --> 01:24:27.140
of the CMU community the last four years
saw a historical buildup of dedicated

01:24:27.140 --> 01:24:32.740
endowment to support students through
presidential fellowships and scholarships.

01:24:32.920 --> 01:24:38.570
This program just established three
years ago has grown to benefit a total

01:24:38.570 --> 01:24:44.440
of 255 students this year in every
college and school at Carnegie Mellon.

01:24:44.500 --> 01:24:49.740
Similar efforts were created to support
faculty through endowed professorships.

01:24:49.740 --> 01:24:54.067
Your ideas and
exuberant engagement helped the University

01:24:54.067 --> 01:24:58.221
establish an historic expansion
of the campus to benefit

01:24:58.221 --> 01:25:02.907
generations of students in teaching,
learning and research.

01:25:02.907 --> 01:25:06.858
All this was fueled by one of the most
sustained and successful fundraising

01:25:06.860 --> 01:25:11.900
efforts in a continuous four-year
period the university has witnessed.

01:25:12.020 --> 01:25:16.340
This happened as the university's
visibility expanded around the world,

01:25:16.340 --> 01:25:21.180
from pioneering university participation
at the Tony Awards on Broadway.

01:25:21.420 --> 01:25:26.470
To faculty engagement at the World
Economic Forum in Davos, to hosting

01:25:26.470 --> 01:25:31.335
the President of the United States on our
campus and to attracting several large

01:25:31.335 --> 01:25:36.230
multi-national companies to Pittsburgh,
while at the same time we nurtured and

01:25:36.230 --> 01:25:41.200
supported our activities at
CMU campuses around the world.

01:25:41.400 --> 01:25:46.060
Your work at the university
community also brought to the fore

01:25:46.060 --> 01:25:51.000
the critical need to enhance
the CMU experience for all.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:55.520
This commitment has already produced
initiatives and action plans for

01:25:55.520 --> 01:26:00.130
the next several years to improve programs
and infrastructure for counseling,

01:26:00.130 --> 01:26:04.440
mentoring, and
enhancing student support and services.

01:26:04.440 --> 01:26:09.800
We have accomplished all this together
in close partnerships with faculty and

01:26:09.800 --> 01:26:15.540
staff, parents, families, friends,
coaches, trustees, and alumni.

01:26:15.640 --> 01:26:20.060
Today we pause to reflect and
celebrate as well as recognize and

01:26:20.060 --> 01:26:24.540
express our pride in what you have
accomplished in your four years.

01:26:24.540 --> 01:26:32.160
And today, I challenge you again,
what will you do in the next four years?

01:26:32.500 --> 01:26:38.680
As you go out into the world, in whatever
you do as a Carnegie Mellon graduate,

01:26:38.680 --> 01:26:44.240
you have joined over
100,000 living alumni.

01:26:44.240 --> 01:26:48.100
We know that you will be enormously
successful and impactful.

01:26:48.220 --> 01:26:53.800
If history is any indication,
many of you will occupy leadership roles

01:26:53.800 --> 01:26:58.820
where your principles and values will
determine the scale of your impact.

01:26:58.820 --> 01:27:04.380
If you are a change agent, your world
will be changing even faster than

01:27:04.380 --> 01:27:09.420
ever before because of the accelerating
pace of change around the world.

01:27:09.420 --> 01:27:13.700
If you are someone who,
through hard work and aspiration,

01:27:13.700 --> 01:27:18.910
tirelessly seeks to improve status quo,
it is imperative

01:27:18.910 --> 01:27:23.428
that you adhere to your principles
even in the face of obstacles,

01:27:23.428 --> 01:27:29.120
adversity and setbacks,
especially created by those

01:27:29.120 --> 01:27:34.200
who are uncomfortable with the disruptions
that emerge from changing the status quo.

01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:40.340
Rosalynn Carter once said, a leader
takes people where they want to go.

01:27:40.340 --> 01:27:44.080
A great leader takes people
where they ought to go

01:27:44.080 --> 01:27:46.960
even if they do not want to go there.

01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:51.840
Such leaders make great personal
sacrifices to move their organizations or

01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:59.020
their countries to a much higher level,
against incredible odds and opposition.

01:27:59.100 --> 01:28:03.900
You may make some mistakes along
the way but you will learn from it,

01:28:03.901 --> 01:28:06.793
and be a better person,
and a better leader.

01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:10.820
Never be hesitant to voice your opinion.

01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:17.560
Sir Winston Churchill once famously said,
when the eagles are silent,

01:28:17.720 --> 01:28:24.380
the parrots begin to jabber.  Be an eagle, not a parrot.

01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:27.400
Consider the case of Abraham Lincoln,

01:28:27.400 --> 01:28:32.760
who many historians consider the greatest
president of the Untied States.

01:28:32.840 --> 01:28:37.120
Lincoln, who led our country in
the middle of the Civil War,

01:28:37.180 --> 01:28:40.420
established the Morrill Land Grant Act
in 1862,

01:28:40.420 --> 01:28:46.060
that completely transformed the higher
education system of the US.

01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:49.180
His signing of
the Emancipation Proclamation,

01:28:49.180 --> 01:28:54.220
during a bloody Civil War that tore
the country apart, on January 1,

01:28:54.220 --> 01:29:00.540
1863, as a Presidential Executive Order,
changed our society forever.

01:29:00.700 --> 01:29:06.220
Also in 1863, Lincoln established
the National Academy of Sciences,

01:29:06.220 --> 01:29:11.060
with a remarkable vision that
was free of political influence.

01:29:11.140 --> 01:29:16.000
Lincoln faced resistance during
his entire leadership tenure.

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:19.720
Another iconic leader of
our times penned a speech

01:29:19.720 --> 01:29:24.440
that captures this theme because
of the way it played out.

01:29:24.440 --> 01:29:32.820
As I read this quote, try to guess to whom
it is attributed, the quote goes like this.

01:29:32.920 --> 01:29:37.740
There will always be dissident
voices expressing opposition without

01:29:37.740 --> 01:29:43.060
alternatives, finding fault but
never favor.

01:29:43.140 --> 01:29:49.940
Perceiving gloom on every side and
seeking influence without responsibility.

01:29:50.080 --> 01:29:54.812
That was a speech that
President John F Kennedy was supposed to

01:29:54.812 --> 01:29:58.546
deliver in Dallas on November 22, 1963.

01:29:58.546 --> 01:30:01.645
These words were in his
prepared remarks and

01:30:01.645 --> 01:30:04.752
he never had a chance
to deliver his speech.

01:30:04.760 --> 01:30:09.960
My charge to you is do the right
thing based on principles,

01:30:09.960 --> 01:30:15.980
values, hard work, honesty, and integrity.

01:30:16.060 --> 01:30:20.560
As graduates entering a new world,
facing new challenges,

01:30:20.560 --> 01:30:27.240
it is your duty to ensure that fake
news does not overwhelm truth.

01:30:27.240 --> 01:30:31.020
Noise does not drown out the signal and

01:30:31.020 --> 01:30:36.640
mere superficial style does
not replace deep substance.

01:30:36.680 --> 01:30:41.620
With a CMU degree, you are well
prepared to separate signal from noise,

01:30:41.630 --> 01:30:46.010
fact from fiction, and
evidence from a mere innuendo.

01:30:46.010 --> 01:30:47.480
As you accomplish much,

01:30:47.480 --> 01:30:53.180
we expect you to return to this campus
sharing your knowledge and experiences.

01:30:53.320 --> 01:30:56.200
Whatever you do, wherever you live,

01:30:56.220 --> 01:31:01.540
you will have a profound impact on
the world equipped with a CMU degree.

01:31:01.620 --> 01:31:06.697
I cannot wait to see how you change
the world, you were my freshman class and

01:31:06.697 --> 01:31:11.874
therefore, you are my special class of
students forever, with whom I have bonded.

01:31:11.874 --> 01:31:17.748
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; With whom I have bonded so

01:31:17.748 --> 01:31:22.177
much over the past four years,
I will always be connected with you,

01:31:22.177 --> 01:31:24.833
congratulations, class of 2017.

01:31:24.833 --> 01:31:31.400
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

01:31:31.400 --> 01:31:34.200
&gt;&gt; We will conclude today's ceremony by

01:31:34.200 --> 01:31:39.050
singing the alma mater by the vocal
performance class of 2017.

01:31:39.050 --> 01:31:40.790
We invite you to please rise and

01:31:40.790 --> 01:31:45.640
sing along, the words to our alma
mater can be found in your program.

01:31:45.640 --> 01:31:48.500
Also, please remain standing at
the conclusion of the alma mater for

01:31:48.500 --> 01:31:51.140
the recession.

01:31:59.360 --> 01:33:22.960
[MUSIC]

01:33:23.840 --> 01:33:32.480
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]
