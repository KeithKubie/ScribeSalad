00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:05.390
The first property three criterion to consider is adequacy. That is,

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.240
the lower level implementation must be rich enough that each abstract state is

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.950
represented by a concrete state. State it precisely, for

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:18.340
each abstract invariant, if the invariant is true in a state.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.630
Then there must exist a corresponding state in the implementation in which that

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.510
the corresponding concrete invariant is also true. And in logic, okay, for

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:35.790
every, every abstract state S, okay, if the abstract invariant is true for S,

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:42.569
then there must exist some state T down in the concrete. implementation. And

00:00:42.569 --> 00:00:47.810
some, some, concrete invariant over that state T,

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:52.980
such that if you were to apply the retrieve function to the concrete state,

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.180
you would get the abstract state.
