00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:06.400
Alan found 4 marbles
to add to his 5 marbles

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.400
currently in his pocket.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.760
He then had a competition
with his friends

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.230
and tripled his marbles.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.340
Write a numerical expression
to model the situation

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.730
without performing
any operations.

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:20.620
So let's think about
what's going on.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.120
So he already had 5
marbles in his pocket.

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.380
And then he found 4 more
marbles to add to that.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.200
So we can add the 4
marbles to the 5 marbles.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.900
So 4 marbles plus the 5 marbles.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.900
So that's what happens
after the first sentence.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.490
He found 4 marbles to
add to his 5 marbles

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.070
currently in his pocket.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.970
He then had a competition
with his friends

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.890
and tripled his marbles.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.500
So this is how many marbles
he had before tripling.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.740
And now he's
tripling his marbles.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.980
So we want to multiply 3 times
the total number of marbles

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.690
he has now-- times 4 plus 5.

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.410
So this right over here is
the numerical expression

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.950
that models the situation
without performing

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:06.840
any operations.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.550
We, of course, could then
actually calculate this.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.590
He has 9 marbles
before tripling.

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.041
And then you multiply
it by 3 and he has 27.

00:01:16.041 --> 00:01:17.540
But this is what
they're asking for.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.395
They want us to write
this expression.
