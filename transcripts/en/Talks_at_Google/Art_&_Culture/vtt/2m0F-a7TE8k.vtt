[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.055 --> 00:00:08.180
SPEAKER: So Josh, thank
you so much for being here.

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:09.020
JOSH ANDRÉS RIVERA:
Yes, my pleasure.

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:10.580
SPEAKER: I'm so
excited to have you.

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.413
So to get things started,
I thought I'd just

00:00:12.413 --> 00:00:14.960
do a few rapid fire questions.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.150
So for these ones, just
answer the first thing

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:18.350
that comes to your mind.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:19.500
JOSH ANDRÉS RIVERA: OK.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.930
SPEAKER: OK, first one.

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.010
Favorite song in "Hamilton."

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:26.877
JOSH ANDRÉS RIVERA:
"Yorktown," for sure.

00:00:26.877 --> 00:00:28.210
SPEAKER: Last thing you Googled.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.360
JOSH ANDRÉS RIVERA: I
want to say it was--

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.192
I can just check.

00:00:42.192 --> 00:00:44.780
Let's find out.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.285
It was something super random.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.650
It might have been a Jimmy
Johns location there somewhere.

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:53.910
SPEAKER: That's good.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.310
JOSH ANDRÉS RIVERA:
Yeah, there you go.

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.440
SPEAKER: Favorite city
you have performed in, not

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:00.192
including Denver.

00:01:00.192 --> 00:01:01.150
JOSH ANDRÉS RIVERA: OK.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:02.160
Because Denver's first.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.000
SPEAKER: Yes.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.829
JOSH ANDRÉS RIVERA:
Honestly, I loved--

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:07.870
they've all been so good.

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.860
Audiences are like subtly
different in each one.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.241
I really liked San
Diego as a city.

00:01:14.241 --> 00:01:15.490
I really vibed with that city.

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.430
It was super cool.

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.240
Yeah, I really liked it there.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.280
That was fun.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.820
No, no, no.

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:22.390
I changed my mind.

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:23.260
I changed my mind.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.380
Tempe was the best.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.240
Because it was on
a college campus.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.540
So the energy there
was just so awesome.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.950
And there was a
professor that used

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.870
to teach at Ithaca
College, which

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:36.130
is the school that I went to.

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.830
And then he now teaches at ASU.

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:40.420
So I got to do a
talk at his class.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.930
And all his students
randomly saw me go on.

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.350
Because I was on for about a
week for Jefferson, Lafayette

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.406
and Jefferson.

00:01:47.406 --> 00:01:48.280
So it was just like--

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.821
I don't know.

00:01:48.821 --> 00:01:49.750
It was super cool.

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.970
I felt just a tiny bit famous.

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.500
SPEAKER: Two more
rapid fire ones--

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.942
one word to describe "Hamilton."

00:02:00.942 --> 00:02:02.442
JOSH ANDRÉS RIVERA:
There's a bunch.

00:02:02.442 --> 00:02:02.850
SPEAKER: You can do a few.

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:03.975
JOSH ANDRÉS RIVERA: I know.

00:02:03.975 --> 00:02:06.480
I'll say-- what's a
groundbreaking for sure one?

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.870
Movement.

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:08.947
It's such a movement.

00:02:08.947 --> 00:02:10.030
You know, it's more than--

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.470
I mean, it's obviously
musical theater.

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.520
But I feel like it's done
so much more than that.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.970
And the timing of
it, and cultural

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.300
implication that it has--

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.540
it's just, yeah, I
would say movement.

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:20.790
SPEAKER: Cool.

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.065
Last rapid fire--
coolest person you've met

00:02:23.065 --> 00:02:24.400
while performing in the show.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.140
JOSH ANDRÉS RIVERA:
I want to say--

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.250
I have a story about it.

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.560
Have you guys seen the
show "Crazy Ex-Girlfriend?"

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.800
Yeah, I love that show.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.000
And Rachel Bloom is
the main person in it.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.820
I went on as Lafayette-Jefferson
once, and then it was in LA.

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.490
And after the show I saw her,
and I was like, oh, my gosh.

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:43.950
And I was just
creeping from afar.

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.880
I was saying,
that's Rachel Bloom!

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.060
Like, what do I do?

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.015
Do I just say hi?

00:02:49.015 --> 00:02:50.060
No, I can't do that.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.270
That's stupid.

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.739
And then she saw me, and
she was like, oh, my gosh!

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:54.655
It's Thomas Jefferson.

00:02:54.655 --> 00:02:58.070
And I said, no way!

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:59.290
It was the craziest thing.

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.580
Yeah.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.913
And she just came up to me,
and we chatted for a second,

00:03:01.913 --> 00:03:03.020
and that was really cool.

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:04.420
And Seth Green, too--

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.490
he was really nice.

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.990
Yeah.

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:08.490
I mean, we've met
a bunch of people.

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.630
That's probably my most
notable interaction,

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:15.040
just because that was so
crazy that she called me out.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.722
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:03:15.722 --> 00:03:16.520
Awesome.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:17.020
Cool.

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.519
OK.

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.880
So now we'll get to
some bigger questions.

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.145
Can you start off by telling
us a little bit about all

00:03:22.145 --> 00:03:23.770
of the characters
you play in the show,

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.870
and what it's like to be in
the room where it happens?

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:26.470
JOSH ANDRÉS RIVERA: Yo.

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.969
OK.

00:03:26.969 --> 00:03:30.940
So it's funny.

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.880
So Offstage Principle
Standby is my title,

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.379
which basically means I'm hired
for the sole purpose of just

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:37.840
being there in case
something happens,

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.740
so I can go in whenever.

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.489
Or before the show, I'll
get notice maybe two,

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:45.280
three hours before.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.040
Somebody asked me, how
early do you usually know?

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.427
Is it a couple of days?

00:03:49.427 --> 00:03:51.010
Do they tell you
like the week before?

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.184
And I'm like, literally
anywhere from like months

00:03:53.184 --> 00:03:54.350
to like a couple of minutes.

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.330
Last week, I was playing
Uno with the other swings,

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:03.580
and the stage manager came in.

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.145
She's like, hey, you're going to
be Jefferson in the second act.

00:04:06.145 --> 00:04:07.020
And that was just it.

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.910
That's what happens.

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:08.900
SPEAKER: So mid-show.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:09.010
JOSH ANDRÉS RIVERA: Yeah.

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:09.565
Mid-show.

00:04:09.565 --> 00:04:11.440
And that's only happened
to me like a handful

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.000
of times where that happens.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.200
So honestly, originally,
that was really--

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.810
I've never had to do
anything like that before.

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:20.784
That was really hard.

00:04:20.784 --> 00:04:21.950
And it was really stressful.

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:23.500
And especially with this brand.

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.060
I mean, it's so
larger than life.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.690
It's just huge.

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.340
And it's so-- I'm so
thankful to be a part of it,

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.950
but at the same time, there's
a gravity to it-- or there was.

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:34.720
I mean, I don't so
much feel this anymore.

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.470
I have relatively
gotten used to it.

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:39.100
But at the beginning,
it was very

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:44.350
crazy to have to just
be, yes, I'm enough.

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:45.130
I can do it.

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:47.770
You know?

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:48.490
It's a lot.

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.710
But I don't know.

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.890
Now I really love it.

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:56.289
You just never know what your
day is going to turn into.

00:04:56.289 --> 00:04:56.830
I don't know.

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.560
It's so much fun for me.

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:59.944
Especially because,
I don't know,

00:04:59.944 --> 00:05:01.360
I like to consider
myself somebody

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.950
who goes with the flow.

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:05.319
So it's just kind of like--

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:05.860
I don't know.

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.950
It's such a weird
thing to be able to do.

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:10.791
I'm very proud of it now.

00:05:10.791 --> 00:05:11.290
Yeah.

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:12.430
I don't know.

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.750
I feel like I went in
a different direction.

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:16.250
SPEAKER: No.

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:17.217
That's totally fine.

00:05:17.217 --> 00:05:19.550
Do you have a favorite role
you get to play in the show?

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:27.190
JOSH ANDRÉS RIVERA: Honestly,
I think I relate most with

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:29.470
Laurens-Philip.

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.440
But the funnest role for
me is for sure Jefferson.

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:36.360
I mean, you just,
you literally--

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.522
you just get to be extra.

00:05:37.522 --> 00:05:38.230
It's so much fun.

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:39.440
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:40.330
It's the most.

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:41.680
It's the best.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:42.827
Literally, you come out--

00:05:42.827 --> 00:05:44.410
I don't know if you
guys have seen it,

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:47.650
but at the very
beginning of the act,

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:51.970
you come out on a staircase, and
you're just in a velvet suit.

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:54.136
And you'll hear a couple
of people from the back

00:05:54.136 --> 00:05:54.760
go like, woo!

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.670
And then, I don't know.

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:57.460
This is what I do.

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:59.056
I'll just be like--

00:05:59.056 --> 00:06:02.110
it's like I come up,
and everybody cheers.

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:03.027
It's so crazy.

00:06:03.027 --> 00:06:03.610
It's the most.

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:04.193
It's so extra.

00:06:04.193 --> 00:06:05.410
I love it.

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:06.827
That's definitely the funnest.

00:06:06.827 --> 00:06:07.828
SPEAKER: That's awesome.

00:06:07.828 --> 00:06:09.785
What would you say is
the most challenging part

00:06:09.785 --> 00:06:10.720
of being in the show?

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.040
Is it going on last minute?

00:06:16.192 --> 00:06:17.400
JOSH ANDRÉS RIVERA: I think--

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.510
there's been a
whole arc of things

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:30.240
that I've considered challenging
and overcome, more or less.

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.100
You know, at first,
I think it had

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:36.580
to do with the stress of being
associated with the brand.

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:38.700
It's, like I said,
it's just magnificent.

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:40.780
It's just this very big thing.

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:45.650
So I think that that was
difficult for me a little bit.

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:49.399
And then I was very
homesick for a long time.

00:06:49.399 --> 00:06:50.690
SPEAKER: Well, you're home now.

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:52.065
JOSH ANDRÉS RIVERA:
Yeah, I know.

00:06:52.065 --> 00:06:53.970
So that's it.

00:06:53.970 --> 00:07:00.051
And it's interesting just
really not having a home now.

00:07:00.051 --> 00:07:01.300
I mean, yeah, this is my home.

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:02.400
But you know what I mean.

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:03.300
We're touring.

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:05.190
So that's been tough.

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:10.770
But then as far as the
performance goes, like I said,

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:15.500
it used to be having
such a short notice,

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:17.550
such a short amount of
time to prepare and go on.

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:22.407
But I don't know.

00:07:22.407 --> 00:07:24.990
It's interesting, because things
that I considered challenging

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:27.120
are now things that
I kind of enjoy.

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:31.990
It's all kind of transformed
into something else.

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:35.130
I guess now it's just
making the most out of it

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:38.750
and trying to remember that--

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:40.500
because sometimes it
does feel like a job.

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:43.290
You know, we've been doing
this for a year, over a year.

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:46.050
And it does feel like going
to the office sometimes.

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:50.430
It does feel a little
bit crazy sometimes.

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:52.966
So I guess remembering that--

00:07:52.966 --> 00:07:54.840
you know, I feel like
every period of my life

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:56.714
I look back on the
previous period, I'm like,

00:07:56.714 --> 00:07:57.750
oh, that was the best.

00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:01.444
But while I was going through
it, it didn't feel that way.

00:08:01.444 --> 00:08:03.610
So now I'm just trying
really hard to be like, yeah,

00:08:03.610 --> 00:08:05.520
this really is awesome.

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:10.576
So I guess just trying to take
that in while it's happening.

00:08:10.576 --> 00:08:12.450
SPEAKER: So can you tell
us a little bit more

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:14.236
about how you got
involved with Hamilton,

00:08:14.236 --> 00:08:15.860
and what the audition
process was like?

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:16.530
JOSH ANDRÉS RIVERA: Yeah.

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:17.950
I was really, really fortunate.

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:24.756
So I graduated college in May
2016, and I was able to get--

00:08:24.756 --> 00:08:28.777
at most theater college,
performance colleges,

00:08:28.777 --> 00:08:31.110
we have this thing called a
showcase, which we basically

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:35.610
go to New York City and then
prepare a song and a scene

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:39.131
or something with our class for
a bunch of agents and managers

00:08:39.131 --> 00:08:41.130
and casting directors and
stuff like that-- just

00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:43.770
a bunch of people, anybody
who wants to attend.

00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:46.740
And I was fortunate enough
to get signed out of that.

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:51.350
And my agent was very,
very, very good to me.

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:52.740
She's really awesome.

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:53.820
I love her.

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:59.010
And she was able to
get me an appointment.

00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:00.520
You know, I did auditions.

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:02.520
I moved there over the
summer, to New York City.

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:06.930
I did a show around Ithaca, and
then I moved to New York City

00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:07.914
after that.

00:09:07.914 --> 00:09:09.330
And I was just
auditioning around.

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:12.000
It was mostly workshops,
just smaller projects,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.336
like start-up things.

00:09:13.336 --> 00:09:15.210
I was in callbacks for
"Aladdin" for a while,

00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:18.980
but I'm just bad at tap dance.

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:21.990
So it didn't end up panning.

00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:25.290
And then around-- I
think it was October

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:27.240
was when I got an
appointment for this.

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:30.040
And then I went in, and it was--

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:31.460
they have a general mail packet.

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:36.560
It had "Dear Theodosia,"
"Blow Us All Away,"

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:38.171
"Washington On Your
Side," I think.

00:09:38.171 --> 00:09:38.670
Yeah.

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:39.640
And then I did that.

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:43.620
And they called me back
in for "Sons of Liberty"

00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:45.030
and "Hamilton."

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:48.630
And then it was
like, oh, good job.

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:50.550
OK, can you learn
these 50 songs?

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:54.730
And then I had to
learn so much music.

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:56.610
It was crazy.

00:09:56.610 --> 00:09:57.670
So I ended up--

00:09:57.670 --> 00:10:01.020
I think it was actually like
eight songs or eight cuts.

00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:03.840
And then I learned them all,
and then I went back in,

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:05.960
and they asked me to
do like two of them.

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:10.140
And then it was a crazy process.

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:10.820
I think I had--

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:13.550
I want to say I had
seven callbacks.

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:14.551
And it took two months.

00:10:14.551 --> 00:10:16.050
And it was one of
those things where

00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:17.250
it was like, I would do one.

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:19.090
I didn't know how I did.

00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:21.614
And then it would be a week
of just thinking about it.

00:10:21.614 --> 00:10:23.530
And then they would email
me and be like, hey,

00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:24.905
can you come in
tomorrow morning?

00:10:24.905 --> 00:10:27.160
I'd say, yeah, sure.

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.694
You've always got to say yes.

00:10:29.694 --> 00:10:31.110
You know, I was
just starting out.

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:32.010
I got no leverage.

00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:34.060
What am I going to say?

00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:35.460
No, I have a 2 o'clock.

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:45.460
So then I did that
like six, seven times.

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:52.447
And then the last
one was a dance call,

00:10:52.447 --> 00:10:54.030
because they hadn't
seen me dance yet.

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:54.905
So I was like, great.

00:10:54.905 --> 00:10:57.800
And then I showed up, and
there was nobody there.

00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:58.800
I said, what's going on?

00:10:58.800 --> 00:10:59.520
I'm in the wrong place.

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:00.853
Oh, my gosh, I was freaking out.

00:11:00.853 --> 00:11:03.150
Because obviously I just--

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:05.970
I don't know, I was just
stressed all the time.

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:08.550
So then there was nobody
there, and I was asking around.

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:12.720
And I asked the
person at the desk--

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:13.990
I can't remember their name.

00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:16.220
But she was like, no,
this is the right place.

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:16.720
Yeah.

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:18.130
They'll see you shortly.

00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:20.704
And it was just the associate
choreographer who came out,

00:11:20.704 --> 00:11:21.870
and he was like, come on in.

00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:23.250
And then it was just me and him.

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:24.720
And I was like, why me?

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:25.590
Why?

00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:27.400
This is the worst.

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:31.810
And then, it was so
funny, because you know,

00:11:31.810 --> 00:11:33.060
it's not like I can't dance.

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:34.268
You know, I'm fun at parties.

00:11:34.268 --> 00:11:36.670
I can bob.

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:37.260
I do OK.

00:11:40.162 --> 00:11:41.370
You know, that's not like me.

00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:42.240
SPEAKER: It's
tough choreography.

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:43.281
JOSH ANDRÉS RIVERA: Yeah.

00:11:43.281 --> 00:11:44.250
Exactly.

00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:45.210
It's craziness.

00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:47.760
And so there's a mover
call and a dancer call,

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:50.910
and they put me
in the dance call.

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:53.565
And then he was teaching
me all these crazy moves.

00:11:53.565 --> 00:11:55.830
And I said, no, this is it.

00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:57.030
This is the end.

00:11:57.030 --> 00:12:00.000
But I think they just wanted to
see how I moved or something,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.440
or how fast I picked it up.

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:05.300
I don't really
know but whatever.

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:06.410
It worked out.

00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:07.720
SPEAKER: It sure did.

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:08.940
JOSH ANDRÉS RIVERA: Yeah.

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:11.148
And that was the last one,
and I didn't hear anything

00:12:11.148 --> 00:12:13.940
for two weeks.

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:16.860
And then I got the call
right before Christmas.

00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:18.660
It was December 23.

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:21.785
And my family lives
in Puerto Rico.

00:12:21.785 --> 00:12:23.160
I mean, they're
all Puerto Rican.

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:28.560
So I was on my way to
visit them for Christmas,

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:32.530
and I was literally on
my way to the airport,

00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:34.230
and my agent called me.

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:36.390
And then she told
me that I got it.

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:37.740
And I stopped the Uber.

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:40.990
I was like, I had to get out.

00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:42.240
So I just literally--

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:44.190
I'm sure I looked
like a crazy person.

00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:47.360
But I literally just got
out of the car and just ran.

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:49.260
I just ran around.

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:51.330
And then I just
called three people.

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:54.570
I ran some more, and
I called three more,

00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:58.650
and then rinse and repeat.

00:12:58.650 --> 00:13:02.700
And then I went to Puerto Rico,
and I felt like a superhero.

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:03.930
I felt so cool.

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:07.430
SPEAKER: Life changing moment.

00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:08.555
JOSH ANDRÉS RIVERA: I know.

00:13:08.555 --> 00:13:09.570
It really-- yeah.

00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:12.530
And then we started rehearsals
like two weeks later.

00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:14.580
It was great.

00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:16.830
SPEAKER: So before I saw
"Hamilton" for the first time

00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:19.980
in 2015, I have to admit
my American history

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:22.156
knowledge was lacking a bit.

00:13:22.156 --> 00:13:23.810
How much American
history did you

00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:25.450
know before starting the show?

00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:29.730
JOSH ANDRÉS RIVERA: I
mean, I don't know--

00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:31.770
a fair amount.

00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:32.291
No.

00:13:32.291 --> 00:13:32.790
No.

00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:33.990
I'm--

00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:36.240
SPEAKER: I knew Alexander
Hamilton is on the $10 bill,

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:39.040
and Burr shot him in a duel.

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:39.820
JOSH ANDRÉS RIVERA: Can I tell
you something embarrassing?

00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:40.384
SPEAKER: Sorry to my
high school teachers,

00:13:40.384 --> 00:13:41.560
but that's all I remember.

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:42.090
JOSH ANDRÉS RIVERA:
I literally--

00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:45.000
because I think I was just so
focused on learning the words.

00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:49.770
I remember there
was a moment where

00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:55.640
I was like, oh, the $10 founding
father, like, two months

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:59.150
into rehearsal.

00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:00.120
Yeah.

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:02.960
I mean, so I guess not a lot.

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:06.990
But that's why I love this
show so much, especially

00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:11.160
with the outreach that we
do with schools, and just

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:14.620
the amount that we talk with
students and stuff like that.

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:17.070
It really made me
passionate about learning

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:20.010
about our history
as a country, and I

00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:27.480
think it really has that effect
on, I feel like, everybody.

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:29.810
I didn't know a
lot of this stuff.

00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:33.530
And some of it's obviously--

00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:35.122
it's dramatized and
stuff like that.

00:14:35.122 --> 00:14:36.330
Some things get glossed over.

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:37.163
I mean, you have to.

00:14:37.163 --> 00:14:40.260
We have three hours
to tell a lifetime.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:43.370
But it made me
passionate about--

00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:45.544
it made me want to
learn more about it.

00:14:45.544 --> 00:14:47.460
So definitely the process
has made me smarter.

00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:50.520
I think beforehand, no, I
didn't know a lot about it.

00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:54.520
I knew that Hamilton was a
dude who existed at one point,

00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:57.515
and there was a show
about him with rad music.

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:03.671
SPEAKER: So segueing into
education, which you just

00:15:03.671 --> 00:15:04.170
mentioned.

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:05.890
So since the show's
inception, there

00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:08.310
has been a huge initiative for
education-- making the show

00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:09.877
accessible to students.

00:15:09.877 --> 00:15:11.460
For those who aren't
familiar, can you

00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:13.640
tell us a bit more about
the EduHam program,

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:15.390
and what those
performances are like?

00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:15.645
JOSH ANDRÉS RIVERA: Yeah.

00:15:15.645 --> 00:15:16.410
Oh, my gosh.

00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:18.930
It's so fabulous.

00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:20.100
I'm obsessed with that.

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:23.860
I mean, you see just the
most passionate kids.

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:26.550
It's very inspiring
to me as a performer.

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:29.790
You know, it's just like--

00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:30.580
I don't know.

00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:36.540
They'll come in, and
they'll do anything,

00:15:36.540 --> 00:15:41.450
like a poem, a rap, just
spoken word, whatever,

00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:44.580
make a speech, just something
about something that they

00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:45.630
believe in.

00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:48.540
And everybody brings
in different ideas

00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:57.839
with similar drives behind
it that are just like--

00:15:57.839 --> 00:15:58.380
I don't know.

00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:02.250
I guess for me,
I feel like I was

00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:06.090
a relatively soft spoken
person about my own opinions

00:16:06.090 --> 00:16:07.649
up until--

00:16:07.649 --> 00:16:08.190
I don't know.

00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:11.197
Even now, I don't--

00:16:11.197 --> 00:16:13.030
I'm not really loud-mouthed
about the things

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:13.696
that I believed.

00:16:13.696 --> 00:16:16.140
And I wish I was
a little bit more.

00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:21.030
But it's so cool to see
how this show just inspires

00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:23.850
kids who are just younger
than 18, kids who are still

00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:28.680
maturing, to really just speak
up about what they believe in.

00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:29.610
It's so cool.

00:16:29.610 --> 00:16:31.532
That's just something that I--

00:16:31.532 --> 00:16:33.530
I don't want to say I
was taught not to do it.

00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:40.050
I just didn't believe in myself
and my opinions and the things

00:16:40.050 --> 00:16:43.560
that I felt and the things
that I believe to the extent

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:46.525
that this show is getting
people to do that.

00:16:46.525 --> 00:16:47.400
You know what I mean?

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:49.191
I feel like I'm not
articulating this well.

00:16:49.191 --> 00:16:54.060
But it's just so cool to
see that from kids so young.

00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:56.469
Oh, my gosh, it's amazing.

00:16:56.469 --> 00:16:58.260
SPEAKER: A new generation
of theater-goers.

00:16:58.260 --> 00:16:59.520
JOSH ANDRÉS RIVERA: Exactly.

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:00.430
And just a new--

00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:02.940
it really is like watching
it and being like,

00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:05.520
this is the future.

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:10.410
It's so-- it makes me just
feel so good about, I guess,

00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:15.194
what's to come in the arts,
and what's to come politically.

00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:20.300
SPEAKER: So off of that--

00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:22.440
so you said these kids
are inspiring to you.

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:25.500
Is there anyone who
inspired you to do theater?

00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:28.020
JOSH ANDRÉS RIVERA: A
bunch of people, yeah.

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:29.890
It was a culmination
of a lot of things.

00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:31.710
I mean, to be
honest, my trajectory

00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:34.110
is a little bit all over the
place as far as the things

00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:36.630
that I wanted to do growing up.

00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:40.150
I played football for a
long time-- not a long time.

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:43.470
I mean, I played football
for like three years

00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:44.460
going into high school.

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:46.230
My story is so corny.

00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:49.980
I played football, and then the
musical was going to happen,

00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:51.930
and I was like, I can't do both.

00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:58.310
And then I quit football,
and then I did the musical.

00:17:58.310 --> 00:18:01.100
I was Marius in Fairview
High School's production

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:04.730
of "Les Miserables."

00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:07.910
And I remember my
sophomore year I

00:18:07.910 --> 00:18:10.700
did this thing called
Pop Show, which is just

00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:14.160
like a culmination
of acts and songs

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:16.490
that the students would put on.

00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:19.640
And that was my
first time performing

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:21.790
in front of an audience.

00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:25.070
I did "Your Song" by Elton John
with a couple of my friends.

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:27.740
And I always liked to
sing, but I had not

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:30.197
performed like that before.

00:18:30.197 --> 00:18:32.030
The first time I did
that was when I was 16,

00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:35.540
and that's when I found out
that I really, really loved it.

00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:37.550
I had the best time.

00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:39.530
And it was not something
that I considered

00:18:39.530 --> 00:18:41.120
to be a viable career path.

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:42.980
I mean, when you're
coming up, especially

00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:45.020
if you want to be a
performer, everybody

00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:46.660
tells you not to do it--

00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:48.050
everybody.

00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:50.600
I remember doing master
classes with people

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:53.540
who were theatergoers, and the
thing that they would always

00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:54.260
say, it was--

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:55.310
it pissed me off.

00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:59.117
It was, if you can do anything
else, you should do it.

00:18:59.117 --> 00:19:00.700
SPEAKER: Good thing
you didn't listen.

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:02.700
JOSH ANDRÉS RIVERA: I know.

00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:03.590
I didn't.

00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:04.090
Yeah.

00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:09.460
And I don't feel like I
could do anything else.

00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:18.090
I mean, I don't know if I'd
be happy doing anything else.

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:27.990
So originally I wanted to
sing, and I didn't really

00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:30.000
exactly know how to
approach that avenue.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.699
And I think musical
theater was a medium that--

00:19:33.699 --> 00:19:34.240
I don't know.

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:36.300
It was just such a unique
way of storytelling

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:39.490
that I hadn't experienced
before the age of 17.

00:19:39.490 --> 00:19:41.770
Like I said, it was my
junior year of high school.

00:19:41.770 --> 00:19:44.201
And then I did the musical
again when I was a senior,

00:19:44.201 --> 00:19:46.450
and that's kind of what did
it, where I was like, wow,

00:19:46.450 --> 00:19:48.900
this is just a really
beautiful avenue

00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:50.850
with which to tell a story.

00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:53.340
And it's such a--

00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:55.530
yeah.

00:19:55.530 --> 00:19:59.190
So then after that I auditioned
for a bunch of colleges,

00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:04.800
and I actually wanted to go
to Berklee for production

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:06.750
and design at first.

00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:10.620
And then they were so expensive.

00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:12.700
And so I didn't
end up going there.

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:15.900
And then I went
to Ithaca College,

00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:19.440
which I love their program.

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:21.000
I didn't consider
myself an actor.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.850
Like I said, I was
mostly a singer.

00:20:23.850 --> 00:20:26.000
And Ithaca was
very acting-heavy.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.640
And at first I really
didn't like that.

00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:30.130
But then I got really,
really into it.

00:20:30.130 --> 00:20:32.144
Now I just really
like to act, too.

00:20:32.144 --> 00:20:33.810
I ended up doing a
lot of straight plays

00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:34.560
while I was there.

00:20:37.290 --> 00:20:39.580
I honestly can't remember
what you originally asked.

00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:42.810
SPEAKER: It was who
inspired you to do theater.

00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:45.956
JOSH ANDRÉS RIVERA: I just
told you my whole story.

00:20:45.956 --> 00:20:46.830
SPEAKER: You're good.

00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:48.413
JOSH ANDRÉS RIVERA:
A bunch of people.

00:20:48.413 --> 00:20:50.270
I had a bunch of teachers who--

00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:50.820
yeah.

00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:52.967
A teacher at Fairview, her
name is Janice Vlachos.

00:20:52.967 --> 00:20:54.300
You know, she's been a big part.

00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:55.260
I almost didn't do--

00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:57.410
it was choir that
originally led me in.

00:20:57.410 --> 00:20:59.650
And I didn't sign up for
choir my sophomore year.

00:20:59.650 --> 00:21:00.734
I was like, choir's lame.

00:21:00.734 --> 00:21:01.900
You know, I was in football.

00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:04.350
And I wanted to be
one of those guys.

00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:06.484
And that's offensive
to those guys.

00:21:06.484 --> 00:21:07.400
They were nice people.

00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:14.560
And I remember I didn't
sign up my sophomore year.

00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:17.470
And then I got my schedule,
and choir was on my schedule.

00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:18.450
And I said, WTF?

00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:25.410
And I went up to
Janice, and I said, why?

00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:27.530
And she said, yeah,
you're doing choir.

00:21:27.530 --> 00:21:29.070
And I said, I didn't sign up.

00:21:29.070 --> 00:21:30.504
She said, you're going to do it.

00:21:30.504 --> 00:21:31.420
You're going to do it.

00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:33.930
And then I did, and it was fun.

00:21:33.930 --> 00:21:34.800
I had a great time.

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:36.341
And that's how I
ended up doing that.

00:21:36.341 --> 00:21:38.200
So honestly, her.

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:44.160
And then I had a bunch of
really supportive friends,

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:46.800
and their families were
really supportive of me.

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:49.620
And my family was
really supportive of me.

00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:56.027
And yeah, I think it was just
a lot of people really believed

00:21:56.027 --> 00:21:57.610
in me when I didn't
believe in myself.

00:21:57.610 --> 00:21:59.906
And that's a big part of it.

00:21:59.906 --> 00:22:01.810
SPEAKER: Absolutely.

00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:04.620
So you mentioned a lot of people
told you not to do theater.

00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:07.320
Opposite of that, what was
the best piece of advice

00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:10.002
you've ever received?

00:22:10.002 --> 00:22:12.210
JOSH ANDRÉS RIVERA: I can't
think of a specific piece

00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:13.620
of advice that I've been given.

00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:19.040
I think-- you know,
this sounds so specific,

00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:22.680
but I think I
realized really young

00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:27.089
that I can get away with a
lot of stuff if I just smile.

00:22:27.089 --> 00:22:28.380
SPEAKER: Talk less, smile more.

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:30.990
JOSH ANDRÉS RIVERA: Exactly,
like literally that.

00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:35.050
Because I remember growing
up, I used to get into trouble

00:22:35.050 --> 00:22:37.400
and be like, oh, sorry.

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:39.870
And then they'd
be like, oh, you.

00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:41.760
You know, it would
turn into one of those.

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:43.050
So it kind of became a habit.

00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:50.730
And then I think
eventually it prohibited me

00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:53.070
from being genuinely
vulnerable, just

00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:57.270
because I had fallen into the
habit of just smiling whenever

00:22:57.270 --> 00:22:58.290
I was feeling anything.

00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:02.580
This is what I'm saying.

00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:03.780
It's very specific.

00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:05.760
But someone-- I had
an acting teacher just

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:07.462
say, you're smiling so much.

00:23:07.462 --> 00:23:08.670
You're smiling at everything.

00:23:08.670 --> 00:23:09.660
Why are you smiling so much?

00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:10.535
You're sad right now.

00:23:10.535 --> 00:23:11.990
This scene is sad.

00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:13.530
Express that.

00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:16.590
This text is not telling you
to be a smiley little kid.

00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:21.750
And then I thought about that.

00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:25.460
And at first I was just
like, OK, I just won't smile.

00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:29.080
But that sounds like
really jaded advice.

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:31.290
But I'm telling you, it's
one of those things where

00:23:31.290 --> 00:23:33.180
I thought about
it, and I realized

00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:38.280
how little of my
actual feelings I

00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:40.710
was allowing to
show other people

00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:43.800
and to express to
myself, because instead I

00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:44.610
had deflected it.

00:23:44.610 --> 00:23:47.740
It was just like, oh, eh.

00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:50.160
And then it carried
over into my acting,

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:52.920
where that was a real
acting fallback that I had,

00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:56.400
where I would just
smile at everything.

00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:58.290
And then I kind of
stopped doing that,

00:23:58.290 --> 00:24:01.350
and I just found a whole
spectrum of emotions

00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:04.560
that I guess I had
not considered before.

00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:06.670
Like I said, it's a
very specific thing.

00:24:06.670 --> 00:24:11.310
But the best advice I ever
got was somebody telling me

00:24:11.310 --> 00:24:12.080
not to smile.

00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:15.987
You know.

00:24:15.987 --> 00:24:17.070
The world's a crazy place.

00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:22.010
SPEAKER: So switching
gears a bit,

00:24:22.010 --> 00:24:23.570
the musical's about
founding fathers.

00:24:23.570 --> 00:24:26.640
And while many of them made huge
contributions to our country,

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:28.640
they were also humans
who were deeply flawed--

00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:29.030
JOSH ANDRÉS RIVERA: Of course.

00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:29.990
SPEAKER: --and made mistakes.

00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:31.490
How does this affect
your portrayal

00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:32.690
of these historical figures?

00:24:32.690 --> 00:24:34.370
JOSH ANDRÉS RIVERA: Honestly,
I think there's a duality

00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:36.870
to every human being, and it's
really important to take that

00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:39.060
into consideration.

00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:40.460
And you know, I'm glad that--

00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:42.800
I mean, they really addressed
that mostly with Hamilton.

00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:44.550
You know, obviously
he cheated on his wife

00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:50.495
and sort of dropped the ball
with his son dying in a duel.

00:24:54.410 --> 00:24:57.050
But that doesn't really discount
any of the contributions

00:24:57.050 --> 00:25:00.440
that he made to society and our
economy and the building blocks

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:02.360
that he set.

00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:07.850
As far as my portrayal of
the people, I don't know,

00:25:07.850 --> 00:25:09.440
I think that's really important.

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:11.090
It shouldn't be hid.

00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:13.760
Truth is truth, and it matters.

00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:19.400
It's reality, and that's
really, really important.

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:22.250
The USA has a shady history.

00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:23.750
It's so shady.

00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:29.990
But we're here now,
and hopefully we're

00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:30.950
educated about it.

00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:33.080
I mean, I think that's
really important that we

00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:38.330
see all sides of the story,
because I think it really helps

00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:42.320
us going forward in proceeding.

00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:48.230
Thomas Jefferson wasn't
historically a nice dude,

00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:49.690
I guess.

00:25:49.690 --> 00:25:52.280
I mean, I don't know a
crazy a lot about him.

00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:54.410
I was more focused on just
learning the blocking.

00:25:54.410 --> 00:25:59.190
But I know that he was a
big proponent of slavery.

00:25:59.190 --> 00:26:01.520
But he made a lot of
contributions, too.

00:26:04.550 --> 00:26:08.630
Everybody is flawed in every
story that you ever tell.

00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:12.922
Hopefully-- in order to
be a dynamic character,

00:26:12.922 --> 00:26:13.880
you have to have flaws.

00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:15.640
In order to be a human
being you have to.

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:16.640
It shouldn't be ignored.

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:17.900
It should be--

00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:20.510
I don't know about
embraced sometimes,

00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:22.580
but yeah, that's important.

00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:24.340
SPEAKER: Absolutely.

00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:24.840
OK.

00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:27.372
So you've been in this cast
for a little bit over a year,

00:26:27.372 --> 00:26:29.330
and you've traveled cities
all over the country

00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:30.736
with the "Hamilton" cast.

00:26:30.736 --> 00:26:32.784
What is it like having
different audiences,

00:26:32.784 --> 00:26:34.450
performing in front
of different cities?

00:26:34.450 --> 00:26:36.030
Do you get different reactions?

00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:36.770
JOSH ANDRÉS RIVERA:
Yeah, for sure.

00:26:36.770 --> 00:26:37.880
It's so interesting.

00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:47.870
I feel like in every city people
laugh in different places.

00:26:47.870 --> 00:26:49.790
That's primarily the
one that I notice

00:26:49.790 --> 00:26:51.721
is sometimes people will laugh.

00:26:51.721 --> 00:26:52.220
It's funny.

00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:54.150
In the EduHams,
there was one where--

00:26:56.770 --> 00:27:00.290
I think it was last week or
something-- where there's

00:27:00.290 --> 00:27:01.860
this song "Say No to This."

00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:04.560
It's like, "led me to her bed,
let her legs spread instead."

00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:06.515
And then like,
everybody was like, oh!

00:27:06.515 --> 00:27:08.010
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:09.690
Like that.

00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:11.610
They freaked out about it.

00:27:11.610 --> 00:27:15.386
I thought it was so funny.

00:27:15.386 --> 00:27:19.150
And then there was one-- at the
end, spoiler alert, but also,

00:27:19.150 --> 00:27:19.790
it's history--

00:27:19.790 --> 00:27:21.584
Hamilton gets shot.

00:27:21.584 --> 00:27:22.492
SPEAKER: Sorry.

00:27:22.492 --> 00:27:23.950
JOSH ANDRÉS RIVERA:
Like Wikipedia,

00:27:23.950 --> 00:27:25.725
they literally say it
in the first number.

00:27:25.725 --> 00:27:27.058
SPEAKER: It's in the first song.

00:27:27.058 --> 00:27:28.190
JOSH ANDRÉS RIVERA: Yeah.

00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:30.250
I'm not sorry.

00:27:30.250 --> 00:27:31.304
But yeah, he got shot.

00:27:31.304 --> 00:27:33.470
And then as soon-- it was
like [IMITATING GUNSHOT]..

00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:38.180
And then as soon as that
happened, there was silence.

00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:39.834
And somebody said, oh, no!

00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:45.330
It's was so funny.

00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:49.140
And then everybody
laughed in the audience.

00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:51.840
It's so weird to be a
performer in moments like that,

00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:54.480
because it's just like, how
do I not acknowledge this?

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:56.216
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:57.660 --> 00:27:59.450
Oh, my gosh.

00:27:59.450 --> 00:28:03.190
So yeah, it varies.

00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:04.870
SPEAKER: And going
off of that, have

00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:07.570
you had any on-stage
or backstage mishaps?

00:28:07.570 --> 00:28:09.320
And if so, how did
you handle that?

00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:10.611
JOSH ANDRÉS RIVERA: Hell, yeah.

00:28:10.611 --> 00:28:12.036
Heck, yeah.

00:28:12.036 --> 00:28:12.910
I mean, that happens.

00:28:12.910 --> 00:28:15.360
Especially, you
know, I'm a cover,

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:17.160
so I don't do these
tracks every day.

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:23.110
So my debut-- my first time
ever going on, I did it.

00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:25.460
It was for Mulligan-Madison.

00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:27.870
And the whole thing
went, you know, as good

00:28:27.870 --> 00:28:29.760
as could be expected
for the first time.

00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:32.006
I didn't make any
crazy mess-ups.

00:28:32.006 --> 00:28:33.630
And I was like, you
know, this is good.

00:28:33.630 --> 00:28:35.040
I'm living breezy.

00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:36.930
We're golden.

00:28:36.930 --> 00:28:42.240
The last line that I have in
the entire show, I just forgot.

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:44.700
It was so embarrassing.

00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:48.240
And Josh Henry-- he's our
original Burr-- he just

00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:50.040
said, "President Madison."

00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:52.800
And I said, he took our
country from bankruptcy--

00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:53.778
[INHALES]

00:29:00.135 --> 00:29:01.610
SPEAKER: To prosperity?

00:29:01.610 --> 00:29:02.950
JOSH ANDRÉS RIVERA: Because
it's, he took our country from

00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:03.990
bankruptcy to prosperity.

00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:05.610
I hate to admit it, but he
doesn't get enough credit

00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:06.440
for all the credit he gave us.

00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:08.231
I said, he took our
country from bankruptcy

00:29:08.231 --> 00:29:14.580
to financial stability--

00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:16.570
and then I was like,
I hate to admit it,

00:29:16.570 --> 00:29:17.600
but he doesn't get enough
credit for all the credit.

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:19.266
And then he's like,
who lives, who dies,

00:29:19.266 --> 00:29:21.370
who-- so they cut me off.

00:29:21.370 --> 00:29:25.870
It was so embarrassing.

00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:28.360
They just had to pretend
it didn't happen.

00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:31.520
And there's been times where
I've been in the wrong--

00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:33.630
but that's the funniest one.

00:29:33.630 --> 00:29:36.910
I mean, there's a bunch
of really funny ones.

00:29:36.910 --> 00:29:40.200
I mean, I don't want to
blow up anybody's spot.

00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:44.025
But there was one time when
our George Washington just--

00:29:44.025 --> 00:29:45.900
you know, you do it,
you get into the groove,

00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:48.000
and I think you expect
it to just come to you,

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.700
and sometimes it just doesn't.

00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:53.280
And there was one time when--

00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:56.040
ladies and gentlemen,
the issue on the table.

00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:59.640
Secretary Jefferson-- you
know, the cabinet battle.

00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:03.180
So he comes out and he
says, ladies and gentlemen--

00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:04.110
woo!

00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:05.970
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:08.569 --> 00:30:09.360
He's just the best.

00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:12.310
He's the most-- he's
just such a jubilant man.

00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:17.250
So he goes, [LAUGHS].

00:30:17.250 --> 00:30:20.070
I lost my train of thought.

00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:23.870
Secretary Jefferson,
you have the floor.

00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:25.330
It was so funny.

00:30:25.330 --> 00:30:26.681
And then they just started.

00:30:26.681 --> 00:30:27.180
Yeah.

00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:28.811
It totally happens.

00:30:28.811 --> 00:30:31.060
SPEAKER: There's a lot of
lines and songs to remember.

00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:33.180
JOSH ANDRÉS RIVERA:
There's a lot of lines.

00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:35.910
And it's great, because it's
so dense that usually you just

00:30:35.910 --> 00:30:38.615
forget about it in like
10 measures anyways.

00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:42.970
But it happens all the time.

00:30:42.970 --> 00:30:46.043
SPEAKER: Thank you
for sharing that.

00:30:46.043 --> 00:30:48.360
Kind of overall big
question-- what does this show

00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:49.347
mean to you?

00:30:49.347 --> 00:30:51.180
JOSH ANDRÉS RIVERA: It
means so many things.

00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:52.740
And it's progressed.

00:30:52.740 --> 00:30:57.710
I think so much
life has happened

00:30:57.710 --> 00:31:00.270
while I've been on tour.

00:31:00.270 --> 00:31:03.037
Like, our George Washington
had his second child

00:31:03.037 --> 00:31:03.870
while we were in LA.

00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:10.095
Josh Henry-- well, no.

00:31:10.095 --> 00:31:11.730
I guess that was after--

00:31:11.730 --> 00:31:12.230
yeah.

00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:13.515
That was after-- his
baby was just born.

00:31:13.515 --> 00:31:14.730
I don't know what I'm saying.

00:31:14.730 --> 00:31:17.450
But you know, a
lot of friendships

00:31:17.450 --> 00:31:18.710
have been developed.

00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:19.920
Things have happened.

00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:22.590
Journeys have been gone through.

00:31:22.590 --> 00:31:24.630
I have made a progression
as a human being

00:31:24.630 --> 00:31:28.800
through this process,
just because it

00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:31.290
comes with so many experiences.

00:31:31.290 --> 00:31:35.220
It meant a different thing to
me before than it does now.

00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:37.590
You know?

00:31:37.590 --> 00:31:41.120
I think before it meant what--

00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:42.840
I mean, and it still does.

00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:45.540
I think it's this idea
and it's this movement

00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:47.070
that's very inclusive.

00:31:47.070 --> 00:31:49.790
And it involves
everyone, and it's

00:31:49.790 --> 00:31:52.320
a choice to stand up
for what you believe in.

00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:57.400
And I think that has remained
consistent to me throughout.

00:31:57.400 --> 00:32:02.580
And I think over time it
became a lot about growth,

00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:05.370
and a lot about
internal progression

00:32:05.370 --> 00:32:09.140
and overcoming my fears
and overcoming my--

00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:15.100
inner demons is the wrong word.

00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:16.350
I mean, I had a lot of like--

00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:22.680
Thomas Jefferson,
that track, homie

00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:24.240
Daveed won a Tony for that.

00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:24.975
Who am I?

00:32:24.975 --> 00:32:26.060
You know what I mean?

00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:29.910
It was one of those things
where I think figuring out

00:32:29.910 --> 00:32:32.250
what it is that I had to
offer as a human being

00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:34.620
and as a performer has
progressed a lot over time

00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:35.850
through this show.

00:32:35.850 --> 00:32:37.770
And it's funny,
because the show itself

00:32:37.770 --> 00:32:40.170
is a lot about
embracing yourself

00:32:40.170 --> 00:32:42.392
and what you believe in.

00:32:42.392 --> 00:32:44.100
And like I said, that
remains consistent.

00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:47.280
And that has been
a huge arc for me

00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:50.900
throughout this entire process.

00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:53.400
I mean, I don't have that
much experience in general

00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:54.190
with life.

00:32:54.190 --> 00:32:55.170
I'm 23.

00:32:55.170 --> 00:33:00.450
I was blessed enough to get this
pretty shortly out of college.

00:33:00.450 --> 00:33:05.771
So a lot of my post-graduate
life has been this show.

00:33:05.771 --> 00:33:06.270
Yeah.

00:33:06.270 --> 00:33:08.286
I couldn't be happier about it.

00:33:08.286 --> 00:33:09.660
SPEAKER: So you
mentioned Daveed.

00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:11.790
Were you able to meet up with
any of the original cast?

00:33:11.790 --> 00:33:12.290
JOSH ANDRÉS RIVERA: Oh, yeah.

00:33:12.290 --> 00:33:12.950
SPEAKER: Have you
met all of them?

00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:15.449
JOSH ANDRÉS RIVERA: Daveed used
to come hang out with us all

00:33:15.449 --> 00:33:16.120
the time.

00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:18.831
Yeah, we had a barbecue
with him when we were in LA.

00:33:18.831 --> 00:33:19.330
He's dope.

00:33:19.330 --> 00:33:21.260
He's a good guy.

00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:23.670
SPEAKER: Did they give any
advice about the roles?

00:33:23.670 --> 00:33:26.130
JOSH ANDRÉS RIVERA: Oh, I
mean, I've never really asked.

00:33:26.130 --> 00:33:27.270
I've tried not to be--

00:33:31.446 --> 00:33:32.850
I imagine that--

00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:37.400
I don't know.

00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:39.390
I imagine that if I had
done it for a while,

00:33:39.390 --> 00:33:42.960
and then I was finished
with it, I'd probably

00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:44.759
just want to live my life.

00:33:44.759 --> 00:33:46.800
SPEAKER: So you guys don't
talk about "Hamilton."

00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:49.050
JOSH ANDRÉS RIVERA: I try
not to talk about "Hamilton"

00:33:49.050 --> 00:33:49.830
with those people.

00:33:49.830 --> 00:33:55.520
But we met a lot of them.

00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:58.230
Oke came to-- Oke and Daveed
were both at the opening night.

00:33:58.230 --> 00:33:58.932
Lin was, too.

00:33:58.932 --> 00:33:59.640
SPEAKER: Awesome.

00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:00.681
JOSH ANDRÉS RIVERA: Yeah.

00:34:00.681 --> 00:34:02.370
We got to meet with him.

00:34:02.370 --> 00:34:03.121
They're all great.

00:34:03.121 --> 00:34:03.661
I don't know.

00:34:03.661 --> 00:34:04.800
Yeah, they're just people.

00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:05.640
It's so funny.

00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:07.230
I feel like coming
out of college,

00:34:07.230 --> 00:34:09.929
these were people that I--

00:34:09.929 --> 00:34:11.679
I mean, the whole thing
is relatively new,

00:34:11.679 --> 00:34:15.389
but in my senior year, we
talked about them in class

00:34:15.389 --> 00:34:17.080
and talked about
this whole thing.

00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:19.929
And talked about Tommy
Kail, Andy Blankenbuehler,

00:34:19.929 --> 00:34:22.050
Alex Lacamoire-- the
original creative team.

00:34:22.050 --> 00:34:28.050
And it's so crazy to
just hang out with them.

00:34:28.050 --> 00:34:33.210
You know, it's funny to
have your role models just

00:34:33.210 --> 00:34:36.172
become people before
your eyes and have

00:34:36.172 --> 00:34:38.130
a regular conversation
about something that has

00:34:38.130 --> 00:34:39.360
nothing to do with your job.

00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:43.380
Yeah.

00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:44.947
That's been really interesting.

00:34:44.947 --> 00:34:47.280
Talking with Lin, and just
having a regular conversation

00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:49.800
about his flight into LA--

00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:50.484
it was wild.

00:34:50.484 --> 00:34:52.650
I'm just like, wow,
this is just so--

00:35:00.070 --> 00:35:01.630
yeah.

00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:03.446
So yes, I've met a lot of them.

00:35:03.446 --> 00:35:04.310
SPEAKER: Very cool.

00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:08.410
So we're going to open
up to audience questions.

00:35:08.410 --> 00:35:11.680
I know we have some
mics around the room.

00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:14.325
If anyone has a question, did
you want to raise your hand,

00:35:14.325 --> 00:35:16.522
and we can bring a mic to you?

00:35:16.522 --> 00:35:17.980
AUDIENCE: Can you
talk a little bit

00:35:17.980 --> 00:35:19.900
about the journey
between getting

00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:23.050
the part, like the
rehearsals, to opening night?

00:35:23.050 --> 00:35:25.430
JOSH ANDRÉS RIVERA: Totally.

00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:25.930
Yeah.

00:35:25.930 --> 00:35:28.952
So got it, freaked
out, went to Puerto

00:35:28.952 --> 00:35:30.160
Rico, felt like a superhero--

00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:30.890
SPEAKER: Ran around.

00:35:30.890 --> 00:35:31.380
JOSH ANDRÉS RIVERA: Yeah.

00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:32.425
Ran around.

00:35:32.425 --> 00:35:35.140
Just ran around the
whole span of Manhattan.

00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:41.440
And then it was awesome.

00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:45.430
And we started rehearsal,
and it was in Midtown.

00:35:45.430 --> 00:35:46.930
It was from 10:00
to 6:00 every day.

00:35:46.930 --> 00:35:50.039
I mean we had to learn a whole
show in like three weeks,

00:35:50.039 --> 00:35:51.080
so it was pretty intense.

00:35:57.220 --> 00:35:58.840
It was crazy at the
time, and now I'm

00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:01.450
really thankful
that this happened.

00:36:01.450 --> 00:36:06.670
But the covers are not
priority when teaching a show

00:36:06.670 --> 00:36:08.185
to an original company.

00:36:08.185 --> 00:36:12.220
We were all learning the
show at the same time.

00:36:12.220 --> 00:36:14.570
So the priority was obviously
teaching the principles

00:36:14.570 --> 00:36:19.460
and the onstage cast their
parts as fast as possible.

00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:23.980
And so a lot of me
learning my stuff--

00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:27.500
I had to do it through
osmosis and on my own.

00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:29.860
And I had to really pay
attention to what was going on

00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:33.410
and absorb as much
as I possibly could

00:36:33.410 --> 00:36:36.320
so that I could go
home and review it.

00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:37.944
And that was really crazy.

00:36:37.944 --> 00:36:39.860
I'd never had to do
anything like that before.

00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:42.040
It was like nobody
was holding my hand.

00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:47.870
I felt like it was so difficult.

00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:51.100
But at the same
time, I don't know.

00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:56.020
I feel like that built so
much character, just having

00:36:56.020 --> 00:36:58.090
to do something like that.

00:36:58.090 --> 00:37:01.450
Nobody was telling
me what to do,

00:37:01.450 --> 00:37:03.310
and I was still
expected to do it.

00:37:03.310 --> 00:37:05.620
And nobody talked to
me about that, either.

00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:07.630
That was the weird thing
is I really wasn't sure

00:37:07.630 --> 00:37:09.850
what the expectation
was, and when

00:37:09.850 --> 00:37:12.700
I was supposed to know my stuff
by, and what that was like.

00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:15.150
So I just tried to learn
it as fast as I could.

00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:22.900
And fortunately, I
had that attitude,

00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:24.880
because I had to go on
really, really early.

00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:27.670
My debut in Madison happened
I think the second week

00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:30.090
of previews, which usually--

00:37:30.090 --> 00:37:31.159
I don't know.

00:37:31.159 --> 00:37:33.700
It's not like it's unheard of,
but it usually doesn't happen.

00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:36.130
It was crazy.

00:37:36.130 --> 00:37:38.860
But fortunately I had
been so stressed about it

00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:41.930
that I had already learned it.

00:37:41.930 --> 00:37:43.871
It was all I thought about.

00:37:43.871 --> 00:37:46.120
Literally I would go to bed
and be like, what if like,

00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:49.730
what if, I don't know,
somebody just quit.

00:37:49.730 --> 00:37:50.380
I don't know.

00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:52.171
I was just thinking,
all kinds of scenarios

00:37:52.171 --> 00:37:53.180
flying by in my head.

00:37:53.180 --> 00:38:00.296
And I would have
dreams about waking up

00:38:00.296 --> 00:38:02.170
for opening night and
people being like, hey,

00:38:02.170 --> 00:38:04.295
you have to go on for this
track you've never done.

00:38:04.295 --> 00:38:05.380
And it starts in 30.

00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:06.040
Good luck!

00:38:12.790 --> 00:38:14.440
It was a lot of that.

00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:17.470
And then when they knew that
I was going to have to go on,

00:38:17.470 --> 00:38:21.520
they were really hands-on with
me, which was super helpful.

00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:25.110
And I got to rehearse
one-on-one with everybody.

00:38:25.110 --> 00:38:28.870
And then I had a
put-in, which was great.

00:38:28.870 --> 00:38:33.820
And then I think it was
the week after that I

00:38:33.820 --> 00:38:36.880
had to debut a different role.

00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:40.330
It was like, the first
two were just nuts, dude.

00:38:40.330 --> 00:38:42.980
Because that one--
the next week when

00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:45.764
I had to debut that
other one, I got one day.

00:38:45.764 --> 00:38:46.930
They told me the day before.

00:38:46.930 --> 00:38:49.810
Like, the night
before was my day off.

00:38:49.810 --> 00:38:52.350
I was out with friends.

00:38:52.350 --> 00:38:55.420
We were doing this
community outreach thing

00:38:55.420 --> 00:39:02.070
with a homelessness
outreach in San Francisco.

00:39:02.070 --> 00:39:04.370
And then it was just
afterwards, we were hanging out.

00:39:04.370 --> 00:39:07.845
I was just having a glass of
wine, and then I get a call.

00:39:07.845 --> 00:39:11.050
And it was like,
hey, Ruben is out.

00:39:11.050 --> 00:39:12.460
You have to go on tomorrow.

00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:16.968
And I just put my
glass of wine down.

00:39:16.968 --> 00:39:19.060
And I was like, I
have to go home.

00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:24.350
And then I just went
over it a bunch.

00:39:24.350 --> 00:39:25.980
That was pretty intense.

00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:28.039
That was one of
those things where

00:39:28.039 --> 00:39:30.330
I feel like now it's a year
out, so I can talk about it

00:39:30.330 --> 00:39:31.540
a little bit more candidly.

00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:35.310
But I remember I had
a put-in, an emergency

00:39:35.310 --> 00:39:37.330
put-in the next morning,
which was great.

00:39:37.330 --> 00:39:39.420
But I remember there
being certain numbers

00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:41.290
where I was like,
I just have to--

00:39:41.290 --> 00:39:44.220
I just I have to
not hit anybody.

00:39:44.220 --> 00:39:45.902
I would be like
maneuvering around.

00:39:45.902 --> 00:39:47.610
I didn't know where
I was supposed to be,

00:39:47.610 --> 00:39:51.190
but I knew approximately
that I should be there,

00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:53.769
because people were here.

00:39:53.769 --> 00:39:56.350
It was nuts.

00:39:56.350 --> 00:39:58.039
It was the most
terrifying thing ever.

00:39:58.039 --> 00:40:00.330
But then it was one of those
things where after that, I

00:40:00.330 --> 00:40:02.680
was like, I can do anything.

00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:04.110
Oh, my god.

00:40:04.110 --> 00:40:07.080
That was crazy.

00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:08.310
And that was--

00:40:08.310 --> 00:40:10.050
I think that's the
most stress that I've

00:40:10.050 --> 00:40:11.091
had with this experience.

00:40:11.091 --> 00:40:13.920
And after that it
was smooth sailing.

00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:16.140
I think nothing will
be harder than that.

00:40:20.310 --> 00:40:24.450
After that, it became a
little bit more routine.

00:40:24.450 --> 00:40:29.460
We rehearse once, twice a week,
and we'll run through the show,

00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:31.570
and I'll be a different
person every time.

00:40:31.570 --> 00:40:35.860
And it became a little
more routine after that.

00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:39.440
But yeah, the start was
actually super turbulent for me.

00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:42.885
Ooh, it was crazy.

00:40:42.885 --> 00:40:44.640
AUDIENCE: If you
could play any role

00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:48.902
in any non-Hamilton
musical, what would it be?

00:40:48.902 --> 00:40:50.610
JOSH ANDRÉS RIVERA:
I really want to be--

00:40:50.610 --> 00:40:52.020
this isn't a
musical, but I really

00:40:52.020 --> 00:40:53.644
want to be in "Streetcar
Named Desire."

00:40:53.644 --> 00:40:55.770
I'd love to be Stanley.

00:40:55.770 --> 00:40:57.620
That would be awesome.

00:40:57.620 --> 00:40:58.620
Have you guys seen that?

00:40:58.620 --> 00:41:00.765
With Marlon Brando--
have you seen that movie?

00:41:00.765 --> 00:41:03.400
Oh, it's so awesome.

00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:07.332
That dude-- I don't know.

00:41:07.332 --> 00:41:09.540
I mean, everybody talks
about Marlon Brando like he's

00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:11.004
the best actor
ever, because he is.

00:41:11.004 --> 00:41:12.420
Or at least a young
Marlon Brando,

00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:17.470
before he had an
earpiece with the lines.

00:41:17.470 --> 00:41:21.680
But back when he tried,
he was really good.

00:41:25.830 --> 00:41:27.540
I think that's my dream.

00:41:27.540 --> 00:41:30.797
I would love to be in that show.

00:41:30.797 --> 00:41:32.130
I have to think about a musical.

00:41:32.130 --> 00:41:34.070
There's a bunch of
musicals I'd love to be in.

00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:38.190
I would love to be Warner
in "Legally Blonde."

00:41:38.190 --> 00:41:40.290
That would be so much fun.

00:41:40.290 --> 00:41:41.940
This is my aesthetic, guys.

00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:44.910
I love being--

00:41:44.910 --> 00:41:48.900
I'm trying to think
of a word that's--

00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:52.620
I just love to be
kind of a jerk.

00:41:52.620 --> 00:41:53.880
It's like my favorite thing.

00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:56.581
And you know, I go in for like
casting all the time for like--

00:41:56.581 --> 00:41:58.955
I've got a young face, so I
go in for high school bullies

00:41:58.955 --> 00:42:01.350
and jocks and stuff a lot.

00:42:01.350 --> 00:42:03.660
Yeah, they're a little
two-dimensional,

00:42:03.660 --> 00:42:05.010
but they're so much fun.

00:42:05.010 --> 00:42:08.130
It's so much fun to just be that
dude who's like, heh, you think

00:42:08.130 --> 00:42:10.350
you're so cool with your pants.

00:42:10.350 --> 00:42:12.690
I don't know.

00:42:12.690 --> 00:42:14.970
I don't know.

00:42:14.970 --> 00:42:15.720
I don't know.

00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:17.180
I would love to be Warner
in "Legally Blonde."

00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:18.040
That would be so much fun.

00:42:18.040 --> 00:42:19.810
I don't know if I'd
call that my dream,

00:42:19.810 --> 00:42:22.500
but it'd definitely
be a good time.

00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:25.525
AUDIENCE: So my daughter
goes to Fairview.

00:42:25.525 --> 00:42:27.527
Have you been to Fairview,
been back to school

00:42:27.527 --> 00:42:28.318
since you've been--

00:42:28.318 --> 00:42:30.060
JOSH ANDRÉS RIVERA: Yeah.

00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:36.400
I went and talked to one
of the choirs last week.

00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:37.752
Yeah.

00:42:37.752 --> 00:42:39.960
AUDIENCE: What's the response
been from the students?

00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:42.230
JOSH ANDRÉS RIVERA:
Oh, I love them.

00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:44.140
They were just a lot of fun.

00:42:44.140 --> 00:42:46.990
It wasn't like-- I mean, it
wasn't anything like this.

00:42:46.990 --> 00:42:49.980
It was very casual,
and I just told them

00:42:49.980 --> 00:42:56.370
about how I used to go there
and my process from then.

00:42:56.370 --> 00:42:57.420
They were really nice.

00:42:57.420 --> 00:43:00.760
They were very enthusiastic,
and I loved talking to them.

00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:04.260
It was very strange going back.

00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:11.940
And being in Denver in
general has been very crazy.

00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:14.370
There's a lot of
nostalgia and sentiment,

00:43:14.370 --> 00:43:18.300
and what it means to be
home, addressing that.

00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:20.197
And especially going
back to Fairview,

00:43:20.197 --> 00:43:21.780
it was like, being
in that choir room,

00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:23.857
and literally
looking at the seats

00:43:23.857 --> 00:43:25.815
that I used to sit in in
the tenor two section.

00:43:28.370 --> 00:43:29.350
I don't know.

00:43:29.350 --> 00:43:30.030
It was so wild.

00:43:30.030 --> 00:43:33.300
And I think they got that.

00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:39.625
And hopefully-- and
everybody always told me

00:43:39.625 --> 00:43:41.250
when I was in high
school, it was like,

00:43:41.250 --> 00:43:42.720
you're going to miss this.

00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:45.320
This is going to be the
stuff that you miss.

00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:47.970
Obviously, like I sucked,
so I was like, whatever.

00:43:47.970 --> 00:43:49.485
I hate high school.

00:43:49.485 --> 00:43:54.882
But a lot of my formative
experiences happened.

00:43:54.882 --> 00:43:56.340
And I was trying
to tell them that.

00:43:56.340 --> 00:43:59.070
Hopefully it didn't [WHOOSH]
like it did with me.

00:43:59.070 --> 00:44:01.560
But it was really, really,
really, really cool

00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:03.310
talking to them.

00:44:03.310 --> 00:44:04.599
It meant a lot to me.

00:44:04.599 --> 00:44:05.890
AUDIENCE: I have two questions.

00:44:05.890 --> 00:44:09.270
How many people in roles
like yours are there?

00:44:09.270 --> 00:44:12.661
Do all the main
characters have someone?

00:44:12.661 --> 00:44:14.910
JOSH ANDRÉS RIVERA: I think
everybody has at least two

00:44:14.910 --> 00:44:15.410
covers.

00:44:18.020 --> 00:44:21.520
Laurens has three covers.

00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:27.550
And there's another guy who
covers the parts that I cover,

00:44:27.550 --> 00:44:31.570
but he does like two
dance tracks, also.

00:44:35.290 --> 00:44:37.090
Everybody has at least two.

00:44:37.090 --> 00:44:41.110
AUDIENCE: So every performance
there's two people there

00:44:41.110 --> 00:44:42.130
who could step in?

00:44:42.130 --> 00:44:42.210
JOSH ANDRÉS RIVERA: Yeah.

00:44:42.210 --> 00:44:44.376
Who could potentially step
in if something happened.

00:44:44.376 --> 00:44:47.000
AUDIENCE: So then what does
the costume room look like?

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:48.083
JOSH ANDRÉS RIVERA: Large.

00:44:48.083 --> 00:44:50.190
AUDIENCE: Because
you have to have

00:44:50.190 --> 00:44:52.427
the costumes for all
the different roles

00:44:52.427 --> 00:44:53.760
that you could potentially play.

00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:54.801
JOSH ANDRÉS RIVERA: Yeah.

00:44:54.801 --> 00:44:56.980
My gondola is stacked.

00:44:56.980 --> 00:44:58.110
It's just got all of--

00:45:03.490 --> 00:45:09.020
I want to say there's like
34 cast members in total

00:45:09.020 --> 00:45:11.990
and about half are
off-stage covers.

00:45:11.990 --> 00:45:15.560
So yes, there's a lot.

00:45:15.560 --> 00:45:16.640
It's so much.

00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:20.970
AUDIENCE: How many costume
changes do you usually have?

00:45:20.970 --> 00:45:24.250
JOSH ANDRÉS RIVERA: Usually like
three, I think, in the show.

00:45:24.250 --> 00:45:27.230
The first act-- let me think.

00:45:27.230 --> 00:45:27.730
OK.

00:45:27.730 --> 00:45:29.470
We have the parchment
in the beginning,

00:45:29.470 --> 00:45:32.540
and then we have the
regular study coats,

00:45:32.540 --> 00:45:34.840
and then we have the
revolutionary outfits.

00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:37.510
And then Lafayette changes
into a general outfit.

00:45:37.510 --> 00:45:40.670
And then he changes into
his Jefferson costume.

00:45:40.670 --> 00:45:42.927
And then Jefferson
doesn't change, and then

00:45:42.927 --> 00:45:43.760
back into parchment.

00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:46.060
So I guess six.

00:45:46.060 --> 00:45:47.170
That's the whole show.

00:45:47.170 --> 00:45:50.739
But in the first act it's like
three per character-- about.

00:45:50.739 --> 00:45:51.280
I don't know.

00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:51.510
Yeah.

00:45:51.510 --> 00:45:52.510
That's a good amount.

00:45:52.510 --> 00:45:54.580
There's one quick change
at the end that's crazy,

00:45:54.580 --> 00:45:56.788
but that's the only one
that's really that stressful.

00:45:56.788 --> 00:45:58.930
Because usually we have
a minute to change.

00:45:58.930 --> 00:46:00.320
But there's one--

00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:02.180
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:02.180 --> 00:46:03.436
Oh.

00:46:03.436 --> 00:46:06.430
Duh.

00:46:06.430 --> 00:46:09.276
But at the end,
there's one where

00:46:09.276 --> 00:46:11.150
I remember the first
couple of times I did it

00:46:11.150 --> 00:46:13.300
I missed the next number.

00:46:13.300 --> 00:46:16.910
Because it's literally like,
you have to go off and woosh!

00:46:16.910 --> 00:46:18.550
You just take off all your--

00:46:18.550 --> 00:46:23.105
I think it's like 45 seconds
to change your entire outfit.

00:46:23.105 --> 00:46:23.980
And that one's crazy.

00:46:23.980 --> 00:46:25.770
But all the other ones are fine.

00:46:25.770 --> 00:46:27.230
No stress.

00:46:27.230 --> 00:46:30.130
AUDIENCE: So I imagine when you
go to-- different theaters can

00:46:30.130 --> 00:46:32.350
have slightly different stages.

00:46:32.350 --> 00:46:34.510
Does anything have to change?

00:46:34.510 --> 00:46:37.060
JOSH ANDRÉS RIVERA: Generally
we'll show up to each theater

00:46:37.060 --> 00:46:40.000
like three hours early and
just talk through the changes.

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:44.425
Usually we won't
have to run through--

00:46:44.425 --> 00:46:46.330
well, we run through
a couple of things

00:46:46.330 --> 00:46:47.830
just to get lighting and stuff.

00:46:47.830 --> 00:46:49.204
Because usually,
that's the thing

00:46:49.204 --> 00:46:52.800
is it's a very
lighting-heavy show.

00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:56.830
And I think theaters are
equipped differently in the way

00:46:56.830 --> 00:46:58.627
that they use lights
and stuff like that.

00:46:58.627 --> 00:47:00.460
So that's usually what
we have to go through

00:47:00.460 --> 00:47:04.570
is changing the
lighting and everything.

00:47:04.570 --> 00:47:07.630
But generally the stages
are roughly the same sizes

00:47:07.630 --> 00:47:08.320
proportionally.

00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:10.260
Sometimes props will
be in different places,

00:47:10.260 --> 00:47:11.800
so we have to live through that.

00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:13.282
But it's really, really similar.

00:47:13.282 --> 00:47:14.740
They do a really
good job at making

00:47:14.740 --> 00:47:17.350
everything kind of what it is.

00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:24.245
And we have a turntable that
we take with us everywhere,

00:47:24.245 --> 00:47:25.750
so that's nice.

00:47:25.750 --> 00:47:26.830
At least that's the same.

00:47:26.830 --> 00:47:30.820
That's the thing that
needs to be the same.

00:47:30.820 --> 00:47:35.802
I don't know if you guys have
seen that, but it's crazy.

00:47:35.802 --> 00:47:37.510
SPEAKER: It's a great
use of a turntable.

00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:38.718
JOSH ANDRÉS RIVERA: Oh, yeah.

00:47:38.718 --> 00:47:40.690
And aesthetically,
it's beautiful.

00:47:40.690 --> 00:47:45.230
But learning how to walk on
that thing was a process.

00:47:45.230 --> 00:47:46.949
Yeah.

00:47:46.949 --> 00:47:47.990
SPEAKER: And dance on it.

00:47:47.990 --> 00:47:49.490
JOSH ANDRÉS RIVERA:
And dance on it.

00:47:49.490 --> 00:47:52.390
And I don't even have to
like dance dance on it.

00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:56.556
People are just doing spins
and crazy stuff on that thing.

00:47:56.556 --> 00:47:58.060
Whoa, it's wild.

00:47:58.060 --> 00:48:01.540
AUDIENCE: I imagine that
you perform a lot regularly.

00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:04.360
So does it become routine,
or are there a lot

00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:05.725
of highs and lows each week?

00:48:05.725 --> 00:48:06.340
JOSH ANDRÉS RIVERA: Sometimes.

00:48:06.340 --> 00:48:08.710
I feel like the first show
is always kind of weird.

00:48:12.340 --> 00:48:14.530
It's hard to just
get right into it,

00:48:14.530 --> 00:48:18.739
especially when I'll have
usually two weeks in between.

00:48:18.739 --> 00:48:19.280
I don't know.

00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:21.196
They've been getting
mileage out of me lately,

00:48:21.196 --> 00:48:25.540
but yeah, there'll usually
be like a week or two

00:48:25.540 --> 00:48:28.270
in between when I'll
have to go on again.

00:48:28.270 --> 00:48:35.800
And it's always just a little
bit weird, the first one.

00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:38.830
That opening number
is so stressful to me.

00:48:38.830 --> 00:48:40.750
I cannot lie.

00:48:40.750 --> 00:48:45.370
Because it's so exposed, and
I still get a little nervous.

00:48:45.370 --> 00:48:47.440
That doesn't go
away, unless I do it

00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:51.152
multiple times in a row,
usually the second one I

00:48:51.152 --> 00:48:51.860
won't be nervous.

00:48:51.860 --> 00:48:55.180
But the first number
I'm always nervous,

00:48:55.180 --> 00:48:57.673
because that first line,
especially as Laurens, where

00:48:57.673 --> 00:48:59.590
it's like Burr comes
out, he says his thing,

00:48:59.590 --> 00:49:02.050
and Laurens is the second
person to come out.

00:49:02.050 --> 00:49:04.870
And it's just you and
the audience, baby.

00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:09.010
And literally, the spotlight
is just like [WHOOSH]..

00:49:09.010 --> 00:49:10.810
That was the thing
when I first came on.

00:49:10.810 --> 00:49:12.010
Because I have to
figure out where

00:49:12.010 --> 00:49:13.570
to breathe, because the
line is kind of long.

00:49:13.570 --> 00:49:15.070
And I remember the
first time I ever

00:49:15.070 --> 00:49:17.700
did it, going out and then
looking and just being like--

00:49:17.700 --> 00:49:21.990
my pupils just, and I was like,
the $10 dollar, founding father

00:49:21.990 --> 00:49:23.620
without--

00:49:23.620 --> 00:49:27.620
like I was so-- it's kind of
nerve wracking the first time.

00:49:27.620 --> 00:49:31.650
And I haven't-- it still is.

00:49:31.650 --> 00:49:33.660
It doesn't really
become routine.

00:49:36.460 --> 00:49:39.580
But it's definitely way
easier than it used to be.

00:49:39.580 --> 00:49:42.690
I imagine it becomes
routine for other people,

00:49:42.690 --> 00:49:45.840
but for me, I'm always
really excited to go on.

00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:48.210
I always have a great
time, and I'm always

00:49:48.210 --> 00:49:49.770
very thankful when
I get to do it.

00:49:52.830 --> 00:49:56.940
So far I haven't been able to
do it enough times where I--

00:49:56.940 --> 00:49:59.690
or I don't know that it would--

00:49:59.690 --> 00:50:02.250
I haven't been able to
do it so much where I

00:50:02.250 --> 00:50:05.250
feel like it's like, whatever.

00:50:05.250 --> 00:50:06.360
I talk in gestures.

00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:09.199
You guys just have
to get used to it.

00:50:09.199 --> 00:50:09.990
It's just who I am.

00:50:09.990 --> 00:50:11.040
Just accept me for me.

00:50:16.110 --> 00:50:18.655
I think for some people
it definitely is.

00:50:18.655 --> 00:50:21.870
It's just what they do.

00:50:21.870 --> 00:50:24.120
I think mostly just
because of my job,

00:50:24.120 --> 00:50:25.725
if I only had to
cover one person it

00:50:25.725 --> 00:50:26.891
would be a little different.

00:50:26.891 --> 00:50:28.950
It would totally be
routine if I did.

00:50:28.950 --> 00:50:31.410
But the thing is that
I always have to like--

00:50:31.410 --> 00:50:34.560
my brain has three
modes for each track.

00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:36.760
So I always have to
pay attention to that,

00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:38.647
or I'm going to say
somebody else's line.

00:50:38.647 --> 00:50:39.730
It's just going to happen.

00:50:42.942 --> 00:50:44.400
AUDIENCE: If your
friends at Google

00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:47.460
could create one technology
to help the theater community,

00:50:47.460 --> 00:50:48.420
what would it be?

00:50:48.420 --> 00:50:49.315
JOSH ANDRÉS RIVERA: Oh, my gosh.

00:50:49.315 --> 00:50:50.148
AUDIENCE: Dream big.

00:50:56.480 --> 00:50:58.530
JOSH ANDRÉS RIVERA: Ooh!

00:50:58.530 --> 00:50:59.890
I feel like what I say matters.

00:51:02.570 --> 00:51:03.185
Damn.

00:51:03.185 --> 00:51:04.393
AUDIENCE: It can be anything.

00:51:04.393 --> 00:51:08.237
JOSH ANDRÉS RIVERA: I
guess, I wish there was--

00:51:08.237 --> 00:51:09.320
that's a really big thing.

00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:12.320
For auditions, I
think the process

00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:16.550
of finding music
and scenes and stuff

00:51:16.550 --> 00:51:24.030
that really fits the project,
that's really difficult

00:51:24.030 --> 00:51:26.950
and strenuous for me, I guess.

00:51:26.950 --> 00:51:31.190
I think it is for
a lot of actors--

00:51:31.190 --> 00:51:37.940
just finding music that's
easily accessible and works

00:51:37.940 --> 00:51:42.680
and is in the style of the
show that you're going in for.

00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:46.280
That's a tough research
process that has

00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:49.260
to happen for a lot of people.

00:51:49.260 --> 00:51:52.670
So something where I
can be like, hey Google,

00:51:52.670 --> 00:51:55.280
I need a song that
makes me look spunky

00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:57.100
and I can hit an A in it.

00:52:00.110 --> 00:52:03.110
I guess if you could do
that, that'd be great.

00:52:03.110 --> 00:52:05.206
SPEAKER: We'll tell
our engineers if anyone

00:52:05.206 --> 00:52:07.550
wants to take on that project.

00:52:07.550 --> 00:52:11.850
AUDIENCE: Are you able to
leave all the characters

00:52:11.850 --> 00:52:12.980
on stage or so?

00:52:12.980 --> 00:52:14.660
Or whenever you're
out in everyday life

00:52:14.660 --> 00:52:17.870
are you like, I'm being
super Jefferson right now?

00:52:17.870 --> 00:52:19.790
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:24.500
JOSH ANDRÉS RIVERA: I love that.

00:52:24.500 --> 00:52:26.220
I'm so Jefferson right now.

00:52:30.091 --> 00:52:30.590
No.

00:52:30.590 --> 00:52:31.940
I leave them on stage.

00:52:31.940 --> 00:52:36.500
I mean, they're all like
me, different sides of me.

00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:37.420
The way that I do it.

00:52:39.980 --> 00:52:42.500
I mean, that's what
acting is to me,

00:52:42.500 --> 00:52:47.990
it's just bringing myself to
the circumstance and whatever.

00:52:47.990 --> 00:52:50.240
I meet the disposition halfway.

00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:53.740
So that's the thing is,
I am extra by nature.

00:52:59.750 --> 00:53:02.660
But I don't really consider
that bringing the characters

00:53:02.660 --> 00:53:03.910
with me.

00:53:03.910 --> 00:53:07.760
I think that's just
because I bring--

00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:08.720
that's already me.

00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:10.710
I bring it to that.

00:53:10.710 --> 00:53:13.540
So no, I'm not like
method or anything.

00:53:13.540 --> 00:53:14.316
I'm not like--

00:53:17.170 --> 00:53:18.560
I don't know.

00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:20.370
I don't know if
that answered that.

00:53:20.370 --> 00:53:21.110
I don't know.

00:53:21.110 --> 00:53:24.900
No, I don't really have a
problem leaving it on stage.

00:53:24.900 --> 00:53:28.340
I've had to go through a process
of really separating this

00:53:28.340 --> 00:53:32.302
from my personal identity,
just because, if I didn't, I

00:53:32.302 --> 00:53:32.885
would go nuts.

00:53:36.070 --> 00:53:40.870
So yeah, I think I'm good
at leaving work at work.

00:53:40.870 --> 00:53:44.870
And when I'm in
my personal life,

00:53:44.870 --> 00:53:47.180
maybe I'm being Jefferson,
but I don't call it that.

00:53:47.180 --> 00:53:49.460
I don't know.

00:53:49.460 --> 00:53:52.050
AUDIENCE: So I saw the show
a few weeks ago in Denver.

00:53:52.050 --> 00:53:53.400
It was awesome.

00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:55.790
And you had mentioned
sometimes you forget a line,

00:53:55.790 --> 00:53:57.650
or somebody forgets a line.

00:53:57.650 --> 00:54:00.230
When I saw the show, it felt
like nobody forgot anything,

00:54:00.230 --> 00:54:01.970
and it was perfect.

00:54:01.970 --> 00:54:04.370
Has the cast as a
whole ever felt like,

00:54:04.370 --> 00:54:05.750
at the end of a
performance, wow,

00:54:05.750 --> 00:54:07.666
that was the best
performance we've ever done?

00:54:09.535 --> 00:54:10.910
JOSH ANDRÉS RIVERA:
I don't know.

00:54:10.910 --> 00:54:13.130
I think different
adjectives are used.

00:54:13.130 --> 00:54:18.240
I don't know if anybody has ever
said that about a performance

00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:21.007
that they've just done.

00:54:21.007 --> 00:54:23.090
There's definitely been
days where I've been like,

00:54:23.090 --> 00:54:26.870
I am nailing it!

00:54:26.870 --> 00:54:30.110
But I don't know.

00:54:30.110 --> 00:54:33.000
There are definitely some
days when it's like, man,

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:34.437
this is really fun.

00:54:34.437 --> 00:54:36.020
Because obviously
you do it every day,

00:54:36.020 --> 00:54:37.730
and not every show is
going to be the same.

00:54:37.730 --> 00:54:39.360
But there are definitely
certain shows.

00:54:39.360 --> 00:54:42.890
And it is, if the audience is
reacting, it feels really good.

00:54:42.890 --> 00:54:45.355
And there are definitely
shows where at the end,

00:54:45.355 --> 00:54:47.230
we're like, that
was really great.

00:54:47.230 --> 00:54:48.560
That was awesome.

00:54:48.560 --> 00:54:51.140
And it feels really good.

00:54:51.140 --> 00:54:53.060
Yeah, for sure, I guess.

00:54:53.060 --> 00:54:56.480
I don't know if we'll ever
say, like, that was the one.

00:54:56.480 --> 00:54:59.680
It doesn't get better
than this, baby.

00:54:59.680 --> 00:55:00.480
Yeah.

00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:02.332
All downhill from here.

00:55:02.332 --> 00:55:04.056
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:06.867 --> 00:55:09.450
I'm sure that yours was probably
a day where it was like, wow,

00:55:09.450 --> 00:55:11.501
that felt really good.

00:55:11.501 --> 00:55:13.250
SPEAKER: Thank you so
much for being here.

00:55:13.250 --> 00:55:14.630
This was such a treat for us.

00:55:14.630 --> 00:55:15.830
[APPLAUSE]

00:55:20.030 --> 00:55:22.480
JOSH ANDRÉS RIVERA:
It was so my pleasure.
