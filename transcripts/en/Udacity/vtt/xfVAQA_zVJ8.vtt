00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.716
The correct answers, at least according to me

00:00:02.716 --> 00:00:07.930
are: sending proper user-agents, very important, writing custom protocols,

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:09.270
no, you know, there is a time and a

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.570
place for it, generally using common protocols and data

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.309
formats is a better idea, using soap. [LAUGH] Depending

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.120
on whether we mean the protocol or the cleaning

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.320
substance. The correct answer may be yes or no.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.230
We're going to go with the protocol, and say,

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.470
I wouldn't use it if I could avoid it. You might make, you might make somebody

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.090
at Hipmunk really upset. Or rate-limiting yourself, that

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.010
is also correct. You know, always be kind,

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.430
proper user agents, rate-limit yourself, use protocols and

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.940
data formats that everybody knows how to work

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.470
with that are easy to work with. Your

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.000
life and everybody else's online will be much easier.
