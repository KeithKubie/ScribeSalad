00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.360
To get from function f of x equals log base 2 of x, to the function f of x

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:11.400
equals log base 2 of x plus 2. We need to shift the original function up, which

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.170
is a vertical shift, by 2 units. So here's a different look at the graph of f

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:22.870
of x equals log base 2 of x and just above it. The graph of the transformed

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:28.330
function, f of x equals log base 2 of x plus 2. And sure enough, we can tell

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:35.150
that for every x value the graph up here, the transformed one, is 2 units above

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.929
the original.
