00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I think we have enough knowledge to begin tackling the mystery of the angle

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and what do I mean by this.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We've shown that if we know, for example, what angle describes our position

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and what I've called face space, which is somehow a relationship

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
between velocity and position, we can determine exactly what we are in the cycle

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
with this mass moving up and down, but how we do get this angle?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
This angle seems so important. I don't know how to find it.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
It seems to be related to position somehow, to velocity somehow, and also somehow to time,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
because if I knew, for example, that I started here and released the mass from Xmax

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
as time went on, it would just trace out the circle.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And we've discussed a little bit what tracing the circle means.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
So, I guess my question is, which variable can we use to determine this angle Î¸?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Is it velocity? position? or is it time?

00:00:51.000 --> 99:59:59.000
This is a very tricky one but think it through and see if you can get the answer.
