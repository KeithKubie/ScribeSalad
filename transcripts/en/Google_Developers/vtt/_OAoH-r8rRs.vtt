00:17:49.839 --> 00:17:51.839
ROIP

00:17:59.617 --> 00:18:03.734
&gt;&gt; I'm Rachel BOOEN, Been.  
   &gt;&gt; We just announced a 

00:18:03.735 --> 00:18:05.735
comprehensive 

00:18:08.357 --> 00:18:13.509
update to Material design.  
Hopefully you enjoyed that.  We 

00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:15.758
will talk about material 
theming, which is a new approach

00:18:15.759 --> 00:18:17.759
to customizing 

00:18:20.879 --> 00:18:22.320
apps, powered by open-source 
components, new tools, and new 

00:18:22.321 --> 00:18:24.321
design guidance.

00:18:25.428 --> 00:18:29.308
We've created all of this work 
focused around two major goals. 

00:18:29.309 --> 00:18:31.983
First, we wanted to do more to 
improve the design tore 

00:18:31.984 --> 00:18:36.516
developer workflow.  That was a 
big focus for us in this work.  

00:18:36.517 --> 00:18:38.976
We want to make it faster and 
easier to build custom and 

00:18:38.977 --> 00:18:40.977
improved experiences.

00:18:44.991 --> 00:18:46.991
And second, we wanted to make

00:18:50.535 --> 00:18:52.535
Material more adaptable and 
flexible so 

00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:58.546
that new products can brand can 
come to Material and take the 

00:18:58.547 --> 00:19:00.981
benefits from it.  This will be 
focused on how you move 

00:19:04.315 --> 00:19:06.555
from customizing and design to 
realizing that customization in 

00:19:06.556 --> 00:19:08.784
code.  We will cover both halves
of that.  

00:19:13.326 --> 00:19:15.754
We launched in 2014 as a way of 
creating a unified 

00:19:15.755 --> 00:19:18.649
cross-platform set of 
experiences.  It was designed 

00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:23.316
not just for Google and not just
for Android, but for everyone.  

00:19:23.317 --> 00:19:25.317
And we wanted it to be able to 
span 

00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:28.730
mobile, desktop, and other 
devices along the way.  And 

00:19:28.731 --> 00:19:31.004
since then, we've seen an 
incredible amount of beautiful 

00:19:31.005 --> 00:19:33.005
and 

00:19:36.128 --> 00:19:38.128
usable products produced by you.

00:19:40.864 --> 00:19:42.864
Built on the foundations of 
Material design.

00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:47.540
We have winners of previous 
years 

00:19:49.974 --> 00:19:51.974
Material design awards from

00:19:55.806 --> 00:19:56.407
"New York Times" to air BnB and 
more succeeded because they were

00:19:56.408 --> 00:19:59.270
able to bring their brand to 
bear, the strength 

00:20:02.316 --> 00:20:04.355
of their identity into the 
forefront of the experience 

00:20:04.356 --> 00:20:06.356
without compromising 

00:20:07.396 --> 00:20:09.396
predictability or introducing 
confusion for the user.  

00:20:12.891 --> 00:20:15.736
With Material theming, you can 
create a custom theme of 

00:20:15.737 --> 00:20:17.737
Material, which 

00:20:19.807 --> 00:20:22.238
is personalized for you product,
expressing its brand through 

00:20:22.239 --> 00:20:25.335
color, type, and shape.  For 
today's talk, we're going walk 

00:20:29.224 --> 00:20:31.224
through three steps involved in 
useing Material theming.

00:20:34.739 --> 00:20:36.739
Rachel will tell you about using

00:20:37.776 --> 00:20:39.776
design itself

00:20:42.062 --> 00:20:44.140
.  Then Rachel and I will walk 
you through a set of different 

00:20:44.141 --> 00:20:48.193
examples of how you create 
different themes for different 

00:20:48.194 --> 00:20:50.451
apps and brands, and Josh is 
going to show us how to realize 

00:20:50.452 --> 00:20:52.452
all of this in code.

00:20:55.326 --> 00:20:57.326
That's the plan for today

00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:05.620
. 

00:21:17.563 --> 00:21:19.563
&gt;&gt; R

00:21:20.675 --> 00:21:22.508
Defining surface relationships, 
the user understands how to use 

00:21:22.509 --> 00:21:24.509
your 

00:21:25.514 --> 00:21:27.514
products

00:21:29.263 --> 00:21:31.263
.  Fundamental guidelines such 
as 

00:21:32.976 --> 00:21:35.624
layout, motion, and so on 
provide the scaffolding to 

00:21:35.625 --> 00:21:38.026
create the beautiful and 
functional products.  And 

00:21:38.027 --> 00:21:39.450
components are still the 
building blocks of great product

00:21:39.451 --> 00:21:43.134
experiences.  We've expanded 
componentry over the years, as 

00:21:43.135 --> 00:21:45.786
many of you might have noticed, 
introducing things like the 

00:21:50.658 --> 00:21:52.087
bottom Nav, and the bottom app 
art which you probably saw on 

00:21:52.088 --> 00:21:54.088
stage and you will see in our 
presentation.

00:21:56.307 --> 00:22:01.263
We've strengthened the 
usability.  For example, last 

00:22:01.264 --> 00:22:03.930
year we released a new text 
field component to increase 

00:22:06.372 --> 00:22:08.372
usability and discoverability 
within 

00:22:09.373 --> 00:22:11.373
this component

00:22:17.316 --> 00:22:19.322
.  Starting today, there will be
a theming section which will 

00:22:19.323 --> 00:22:21.323
showcase how 

00:22:23.319 --> 00:22:25.319
components can be easily 
customized from the baseline 

00:22:25.366 --> 00:22:27.366
Material theme.

00:22:28.825 --> 00:22:30.825
Then you can use the Material 
theme 

00:22:34.117 --> 00:22:35.730
editor to execute this cascades 
customizations throughout your 

00:22:35.731 --> 00:22:37.731
brand components.

00:22:42.518 --> 00:22:43.927
Let's talk ABTS about a few of 
these customizations that make 

00:22:43.928 --> 00:22:47.811
your product come alive.  We 
launched a beautiful color 

00:22:47.812 --> 00:22:51.297
palate and a way to think about 
how to apply color to your UI.

00:22:54.958 --> 00:22:56.958
What if your brand color was not
in 

00:22:58.025 --> 00:23:00.894
this palate? A new tool in the 
guidelines creates 

00:23:05.533 --> 00:23:07.533
beautiful Material

00:23:08.876 --> 00:23:12.141
palates and gives you tools to 
add to your palates.  You can 

00:23:12.142 --> 00:23:14.582
generate palates in the Material
theme editor, but the theme 

00:23:17.426 --> 00:23:19.265
editor takes this a step 
further, applying across your 

00:23:19.266 --> 00:23:21.504
symbol library.  It helps check 
for accessibility.

00:23:24.808 --> 00:23:27.067
Using the full palate to provide
alternative colors that meet 

00:23:28.090 --> 00:23:32.818
accessibility standards.  
    So let's talk about type.  

00:23:32.819 --> 00:23:34.819
We introduced the same 
capabilities with typography.

00:23:38.937 --> 00:23:41.255
In 2014, we released a 
comprehensive scale that mapped 

00:23:41.256 --> 00:23:43.494
to components.  Today we can 
create beautiful type 

00:23:46.742 --> 00:23:48.742
scales for any type face, not 
just Roboto.

00:23:51.236 --> 00:23:53.236
These are often configured to 
work across Material components.

00:23:54.684 --> 00:23:57.142
And for shape, today with the 
launch of the theme editor, we 

00:23:57.143 --> 00:23:59.143
are introducing 

00:24:01.244 --> 00:24:03.479
the ability to customize shape 
so that rounder corners or 

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:07.967
detail on some of your surfaces 
immediately apply across all 

00:24:07.968 --> 00:24:09.968
surfaces within your design.

00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:14.410
And lastly, Akon

00:24:16.547 --> 00:24:19.589
iconography, resulting in a 
collection of over 1,000 icons. 

00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:22.088
Today we're announcing four 
additional sets of icon, 

00:24:22.089 --> 00:24:24.089
expanding the visual range of 
the original set.

00:24:28.217 --> 00:24:30.217
Available on Material.

00:24:32.126 --> 00:24:34.174
io, they allow for more visual 
expression in the smallest 

00:24:34.175 --> 00:24:36.175
details of 

00:24:37.388 --> 00:24:39.388
your experience

00:24:53.377 --> 00:24:55.377
.  

00:24:57.671 --> 00:25:01.560
-- Android, web, and Flutter.  
So let's go deeper.  We want to 

00:25:01.561 --> 00:25:03.561
show you how efficient 

00:25:05.384 --> 00:25:07.384
customization can actually be

00:25:13.155 --> 00:25:14.979
.  Making sure our system works 
for a wide variety of 

00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:17.438
experiencing and brands.  You 
will see these used throughout 

00:25:17.439 --> 00:25:20.896
our updated guidelines.  Today 
we will talk about a travel app 

00:25:23.547 --> 00:25:25.547
here shown on desktop.

00:25:29.027 --> 00:25:32.285
Reply, an e-mail app, and a 
retail app shown on tablet.  

00:25:32.286 --> 00:25:34.286
This visual shows how they would

00:25:37.051 --> 00:25:39.210
originally appear pre-Material 
theming.  You can see how 

00:25:39.211 --> 00:25:41.211
similar the structure 

00:25:46.309 --> 00:25:48.309
and visual design of these 
screens are

00:25:57.884 --> 00:26:00.121
.  
    I will start with an app 

00:26:00.122 --> 00:26:02.122
called 

00:26:05.355 --> 00:26:07.355
crane, which is a travel app

00:26:14.577 --> 00:26:16.607
.  It is editorial, using 
beautiful image lists to 

00:26:16.608 --> 00:26:19.894
showcase and browse content.  
Crane's brand is refined but not

00:26:19.895 --> 00:26:24.635
unfriendly.  The brand needs to 
give the user confidence that 

00:26:24.636 --> 00:26:26.636
they can book travel and accept 
payment, but also lively enough 

00:26:29.581 --> 00:26:31.811
for vacation planning to still 
feel exciting.  A lot of that 

00:26:31.812 --> 00:26:33.812
personality starts with color 
decisions.

00:26:37.143 --> 00:26:39.210
Crane's primary color is purple,
and uses variants of this color 

00:26:39.211 --> 00:26:41.460
to distinguish and create 
contrast, and the 

00:26:46.546 --> 00:26:47.755
secondary color is bright red, 
used for important information 

00:26:47.756 --> 00:26:49.756
and selection within the 
experience.

00:26:51.855 --> 00:26:54.333
The purple is the main color of 
the buttons, and second color is

00:26:54.334 --> 00:26:57.862
used for selection controls and 
typographic elements and places.

00:27:00.138 --> 00:27:02.983
But if we use red for type and 
selection controls, what about 

00:27:02.984 --> 00:27:04.984
error states?

00:27:09.258 --> 00:27:11.258
Very observant if you noticed 
that

00:27:21.332 --> 00:27:22.748
.  Speaking of text fields, 
crane uses two styles that 

00:27:22.749 --> 00:27:27.063
you'll see here.  This is the 
lighter weight outlined text 

00:27:27.064 --> 00:27:29.064
field used for longer scrolling 

00:27:30.079 --> 00:27:32.079
forms

00:27:35.938 --> 00:27:37.996
.  This is used for search and 
user preferences.  They have a 

00:27:37.997 --> 00:27:39.827
custom shape with rounded 
corners and use the brand 

00:27:39.828 --> 00:27:41.828
colors, the 

00:27:44.114 --> 00:27:46.764
iconography and typography.  And
we mentioned crane's emphasis on

00:27:47.770 --> 00:27:52.916
editorial content.  They use a 
styled grid list where photos 

00:27:52.917 --> 00:27:54.767
maintain their aspect ratio so 
they show as much content as 

00:27:54.768 --> 00:27:59.888
possible.  The image list has 
been -- with each item, custom 

00:27:59.889 --> 00:28:04.771
padding has been added above and
below the item.  Okay.  Josh, 

00:28:04.772 --> 00:28:06.772
your designer has given you a 
beautiful design.

00:28:09.017 --> 00:28:12.569
Can you make it? 
   &gt;&gt; JOSH ESTELLE: As a 

00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:14.570
developer, I love a good 
challenge, and I love making 

00:28:16.267 --> 00:28:18.515
beautiful designs come to life 
and really putting them in the 

00:28:18.516 --> 00:28:20.516
hands of our users.

00:28:22.208 --> 00:28:24.864
Our engineering team has been 
hard at work creating building 

00:28:24.865 --> 00:28:26.865
blocks for great 

00:28:27.919 --> 00:28:29.919
design, complete with 
flexibility 

00:28:30.927 --> 00:28:32.927
necessary

00:28:35.518 --> 00:28:37.518
.  We have done this through 
open source 

00:28:41.455 --> 00:28:43.455
libraries, available for 
Android, iOS, and Flutter.

00:28:45.509 --> 00:28:48.344
I will walk you through how we 
get started building this with 

00:28:48.345 --> 00:28:50.345
MDC web.

00:28:52.735 --> 00:28:54.735
I can quickly drop in the basic 

00:28:56.763 --> 00:28:58.763
structure of an app

00:29:00.502 --> 00:29:01.517
.  This is what it looks like 
before I begin customizing 

00:29:01.518 --> 00:29:04.768
anything.  This will give you 
users a great experience right 

00:29:04.769 --> 00:29:08.244
out of the box.  But today we're
talking about customizing 

00:29:08.245 --> 00:29:11.092
materials for your brand's 
specific needs.  I will show you

00:29:11.093 --> 00:29:13.093
how easy that is.  
    First, color.

00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:19.774
Rachel told you about our new 
color system

00:29:23.833 --> 00:29:25.833
.  From the tools, you can 
easily pull 

00:29:26.883 --> 00:29:29.557
in the colors necessary by 
defining these variables.  These

00:29:29.558 --> 00:29:31.558
variables are used throughout 

00:29:33.845 --> 00:29:35.845
the MDC components and can be 
used 

00:29:36.919 --> 00:29:39.138
anywhere within your app to give
understanding to how color is 

00:29:39.139 --> 00:29:44.065
applied.  While all MDC 
components will automatically 

00:29:44.066 --> 00:29:46.066
pick up and adapt those colors 
we just defined, you can 

00:29:49.952 --> 00:29:51.952
customize things when necessary

00:29:54.822 --> 00:29:56.822
.  A tabs default to colors 
expected.

00:29:57.849 --> 00:30:00.144
On this app, they are part of 
the top app bar which uses the 

00:30:00.145 --> 00:30:03.414
primary color as your 
background.  The default black 

00:30:03.415 --> 00:30:05.646
that tabs use is too dark to put
on top of that primary color.

00:30:27.125 --> 00:30:29.125
So here we show how we -- and 
this is what that looks like.

00:31:21.165 --> 00:31:22.387
Reply's promise to users is not 
especially complex.  It's an 

00:31:22.388 --> 00:31:24.388
e-mail app.  It wants to be 
clearly organized.

00:31:27.081 --> 00:31:29.958
It wants to have legible 
typography and straightforward 

00:31:29.959 --> 00:31:32.828
navigation.  But we have 
customization opportunities 

00:31:32.829 --> 00:31:34.829
within that.

00:31:36.915 --> 00:31:38.915
Reply's brand is focused on 
friendliness.

00:31:42.870 --> 00:31:44.870
It's come PEpetence and maybe a 
hint of quirkiness.

00:31:47.190 --> 00:31:49.190
On mobile, reply uses the bottom
app bar.

00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:53.500
You see the floating action 
button, 

00:31:54.753 --> 00:31:56.753
and it has been nested into the 
app 

00:31:58.045 --> 00:32:00.268
itself with that nice little 
cut.  Doing that increases its 

00:32:00.269 --> 00:32:02.269
prominence.

00:32:04.372 --> 00:32:07.206
A key action as our Fabs often 
are, and this makes it an 

00:32:07.207 --> 00:32:09.871
obvious target.  It's a little 
less obvious, less 

00:32:13.546 --> 00:32:15.976
prominent, uses the reply logo 
to access a traditional 

00:32:15.977 --> 00:32:18.439
navigation panel.  You might 
notice something interesting 

00:32:19.859 --> 00:32:21.921
going on with the icons 
themselves.  They're using one 

00:32:21.922 --> 00:32:24.194
of the new sets that Rachel 
described earlier, in this case,

00:32:26.036 --> 00:32:28.036
the two-tone version.

00:32:29.106 --> 00:32:31.349
Now, these icons are still 
immediately recognizable.  We 

00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:33.350
haven't changed the way that we 

00:32:36.397 --> 00:32:43.835
draw the similarable symbol.  We
have stylized it.  The entry 

00:32:43.836 --> 00:32:46.486
chips in the middle of the 
screen here, those use custom 

00:32:46.487 --> 00:32:50.960
color and typography, and we've 
also adjusted some of the 

00:32:50.961 --> 00:32:52.961
lay-out elements.

00:32:56.069 --> 00:32:58.089
Inside of the avatar been inset,
we customize it to be a bit 

00:32:58.090 --> 00:33:02.166
larger, completing the rounded 
shape and giving you the 

00:33:02.167 --> 00:33:04.167
slightly better chance of 

00:33:07.221 --> 00:33:09.221
actually being able to tell who 
that is

00:33:14.164 --> 00:33:16.164
.  

00:33:17.846 --> 00:33:19.688
It needs to cover a lot of 
different use cases or tasks 

00:33:19.689 --> 00:33:21.689
related to this very text heavy 
application.

00:33:24.989 --> 00:33:26.989
So we've done customization here
as well.

00:33:28.877 --> 00:33:34.371
We've taken the default Roboto 
and replaced it with Work Sans. 

00:33:34.372 --> 00:33:36.831
We've updated the weights using 
the guidance out of the Material

00:33:36.832 --> 00:33:43.809
theme editor.  With the bold 
headlines and less emphasized 

00:33:43.810 --> 00:33:45.810
captions and body text, we 

00:33:46.890 --> 00:33:49.110
increased the scanability of the
content.  And you can see that 

00:33:49.111 --> 00:33:53.581
really clearly in a view like 
the messaging list here.  

00:33:53.582 --> 00:33:55.840
There's a clean visual hierarchy
and the user's eye knows how to 

00:33:55.841 --> 00:33:58.886
jump down the page to catch the 
different titles that are there.

00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:04.819
On the cards themselves, we 
customized them to use sharp 

00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:09.974
corners, and we decreased the 
padding between the cards so 

00:34:09.975 --> 00:34:11.975
there's more space to get 
content in.

00:34:13.878 --> 00:34:14.901
Even though there's no 
indication of elevation on the 

00:34:14.902 --> 00:34:18.561
cards, you can still see a clear
separation between them.  You're

00:34:18.562 --> 00:34:20.822
getting a little bit of that 
background color peeking through

00:34:20.823 --> 00:34:25.551
between the cards, cueing that 
these are different surfaces, 

00:34:25.552 --> 00:34:27.552
and that the user 

00:34:29.849 --> 00:34:31.849
can reasonably expect to perform
swipe 

00:34:33.333 --> 00:34:36.162
gestures on them to star or 
delete one of the messages.  

00:34:36.163 --> 00:34:38.163
That's a lot of customization.

00:34:39.393 --> 00:34:42.125
Can Josh build it? 
   &gt;&gt; JOSH ESTELLE: So I already

00:34:42.126 --> 00:34:48.274
showed you MDC web.  I will 
bring you through MDC Android.  

00:34:48.275 --> 00:34:50.933
No matter what platform you're 
building for, you have a 

00:34:50.934 --> 00:34:55.195
consistent set of components 
available, the same patterns, 

00:34:55.196 --> 00:34:57.443
features, themability, but very 
much in line with the platform 

00:34:59.270 --> 00:35:02.346
specific paradigms that your 
users are going to expect.  So 

00:35:02.347 --> 00:35:04.347
here on Android, we have the 
same material theming for color.

00:35:07.945 --> 00:35:09.945
We define our theme inheriting 
for the 

00:35:11.204 --> 00:35:13.237
Material components theme and 
define our brand colors.  This 

00:35:13.238 --> 00:35:15.238
defines the colors that will 
flow 

00:35:17.361 --> 00:35:20.014
through the app, styling both 
the MDC components and UI 

00:35:20.015 --> 00:35:24.729
elements.  Now for reply, we 
really need to exercise our 

00:35:24.730 --> 00:35:26.730
ability to customize 

00:35:27.811 --> 00:35:29.811
typography and use the Material 
type 

00:35:30.813 --> 00:35:32.813
scales

00:35:38.697 --> 00:35:41.338
.  Work Sans is the type face 
for reply, and this is all you 

00:35:41.339 --> 00:35:43.569
need to have that font 
downloaded on the fly whenever 

00:35:46.637 --> 00:35:50.752
necessary for your app.  Once we
have the font, we have to apply 

00:35:50.753 --> 00:35:52.179
our material type scales that 
our tooling will help you 

00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:54.180
determine.

00:35:56.676 --> 00:35:58.676
Here we redefine the headline 
one text 

00:36:01.366 --> 00:36:03.366
appearance to use Work Sans with
a light text style.

00:36:05.446 --> 00:36:08.307
We can apply and link up to to 
our theme so that all update 

00:36:08.308 --> 00:36:10.959
across your app.  
    So with those changes to our

00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:12.960
theme, 

00:36:14.874 --> 00:36:16.874
we see replies, colors, and 
typography 

00:36:17.939 --> 00:36:20.189
permeate through the components 
and views of the app.  Now let's

00:36:20.190 --> 00:36:22.190
look at specific components.  
First, chips.

00:36:25.099 --> 00:36:27.826
Chips can be versatile, and 
complicated to implement well 

00:36:27.827 --> 00:36:29.879
and in a consistent well.  So 
we've done that for you.

00:36:32.969 --> 00:36:35.831
Pull in the MDC Android chips 
like this, very simple.  Drop it

00:36:35.832 --> 00:36:40.281
in your layout.  Getting all the
nuanced behavior of a chip just 

00:36:40.282 --> 00:36:42.311
right, and completely pulling in
your theme colors and type 

00:36:43.338 --> 00:36:45.338
definitions.

00:36:47.013 --> 00:36:49.696
And of course, the new bottom 
app bar with that special place 

00:36:49.697 --> 00:36:51.697
for the floating 

00:36:52.819 --> 00:36:54.517
action button this is one of the
nice patterns that might seem 

00:36:54.518 --> 00:37:00.280
like it would take forever to 
figure out how to build.  It did

00:37:00.281 --> 00:37:03.338
take a while, but we've got that
for you, too.  Here is the 

00:37:03.339 --> 00:37:05.780
bottom bar and floating action 
bar, automatically pulling in 

00:37:06.588 --> 00:37:08.588
your theme colors and type.

00:37:11.079 --> 00:37:13.079
We're using our new Material 
two-tone icons.

00:37:15.845 --> 00:37:18.833
They are available on Material.
I/O

00:37:27.847 --> 00:37:29.847
.io

00:37:36.417 --> 00:37:38.673
.  
   &gt;&gt; RICHARD FULCHER: So now we

00:37:38.674 --> 00:37:40.674
will 

00:37:42.572 --> 00:37:44.572
move on to the next app.

00:37:47.748 --> 00:37:49.748
So, because of this, a lot of 
the emphasis is on imagery.

00:37:54.211 --> 00:37:56.211
The tonal color pal

00:37:58.332 --> 00:38:00.368
palate has minimal interest.  
Think about what a user coming 

00:38:00.369 --> 00:38:03.455
to this experience is looking 
for.  They want to engage with 

00:38:03.456 --> 00:38:08.390
the content.  They want to be 
excited by the different wares 

00:38:08.391 --> 00:38:11.662
you have up for sale and keep 
their focus there.  But you also

00:38:11.663 --> 00:38:13.663
need to be able to convert them.

00:38:15.317 --> 00:38:18.174
They need to be able to find 
that add to cart button and hit 

00:38:18.175 --> 00:38:20.175
it when it's time to make the 
purchase.

00:38:25.115 --> 00:38:27.115
You're balancing content 
browsing and specific execution.

00:38:30.225 --> 00:38:32.225
With that in mind, shrine's 
brand 

00:38:33.313 --> 00:38:35.313
recedes a little and content and
key actions go forward.

00:38:37.539 --> 00:38:39.539
Where

00:38:41.284 --> 00:38:43.284
shrine shines is in the way it 
uses shapes.

00:38:44.744 --> 00:38:46.185
We use sharp cuts on surfaces 
like buttons and larger sheets 

00:38:46.186 --> 00:38:51.501
of material.  And those are all 
tied back to that diamond logo, 

00:38:51.502 --> 00:38:53.502
the product logo of shrine 
itself.

00:38:57.851 --> 00:38:59.851
Those aren't just aesthetic 
choices.

00:39:02.341 --> 00:39:05.208
When we do the surface cuts on 
the corner, we are communicating

00:39:05.209 --> 00:39:09.701
how the surfaces are arranged in
Z space and how the user might 

00:39:09.702 --> 00:39:12.750
be able to interact with them.  
So from front to back, you have 

00:39:12.751 --> 00:39:17.737
the backdrop back layer where we
have a custom navigation menu 

00:39:17.738 --> 00:39:22.649
for shrine.  In the middle, we 
have the backdrop front layer, 

00:39:22.650 --> 00:39:24.480
which is where the bulk of the 
content the user is actually 

00:39:24.481 --> 00:39:29.380
going to engage with is going to
reside with.  And then the 

00:39:29.381 --> 00:39:31.428
shopping cart sheet which is 
tucked almost entirely off 

00:39:31.429 --> 00:39:33.429
screen, 

00:39:34.702 --> 00:39:36.702
and it is out of the view when 
it's not needed.

00:39:39.388 --> 00:39:41.837
On tablet and desktop, shrine's 
primary navigation is through 

00:39:41.838 --> 00:39:43.838
tabs.

00:39:45.002 --> 00:39:46.854
On keeping with the emphasis on 
storytelling through shape, 

00:39:46.855 --> 00:39:51.305
we're using a highlight 
indicator that takes a custom 

00:39:51.306 --> 00:39:54.594
shape and draws it behind the 
active label.  Last time, Josh, 

00:39:54.595 --> 00:39:56.595
once more? 
   &gt;&gt; JOSH ESTELLE: Okay.

00:39:58.244 --> 00:40:00.506
So this time, let's talk about 
iOS.  Again, I'm going to show 

00:40:00.507 --> 00:40:04.833
you how colors are defined very 
simply and easily get applied 

00:40:04.834 --> 00:40:07.300
throughout all of our 
components.  For each platform 

00:40:07.301 --> 00:40:11.623
you define these colors and 
trust that we've applied them in

00:40:11.624 --> 00:40:13.624
the appropriate places across 
all the 

00:40:15.113 --> 00:40:17.113
UI elements.

00:40:19.406 --> 00:40:21.406
This is one of the areas that 
I'm really excited about.

00:40:23.708 --> 00:40:25.708
It's tricky to implement these 
things, 

00:40:27.364 --> 00:40:29.632
but we aim at making it as 
simple as theming any other 

00:40:29.633 --> 00:40:34.364
aspect of your design.  Here we 
used this cut on the corners of 

00:40:34.365 --> 00:40:38.025
the buttons and on the top left 
corner of the larger surface.  

00:40:38.026 --> 00:40:40.026
On iOS, you can use our shape 

00:40:42.674 --> 00:40:45.266
generators and cornerate them to
stylize.

00:40:49.370 --> 00:40:51.805
Here you see a bigger 32 pixel 
cut, but only applied to the 

00:40:51.806 --> 00:40:53.846
top-left corner of the card this
takes care of a ton of 

00:40:56.335 --> 00:40:58.335
complexity and making touch 
targets 

00:40:59.831 --> 00:41:00.846
behave correctly, ripples and 
shadows appear in the right 

00:41:00.847 --> 00:41:05.920
place.  With all of this, you 
get an easy, interesting way to 

00:41:05.921 --> 00:41:07.921
apply custom shapes across 
everything you do.  

00:41:08.590 --> 00:41:10.590
Now shape is still a work in 
progress.

00:41:11.856 --> 00:41:14.113
I showed it to you here applied 
to buttons and cards, but it 

00:41:14.114 --> 00:41:18.983
will be coming to many more of 
our components soon.  With that,

00:41:18.984 --> 00:41:21.444
hopefully I have gotten you 
excited about Material 

00:41:21.445 --> 00:41:23.681
components, the benefits, and 
the ease with which they 

00:41:28.972 --> 00:41:30.972
offer the customizations

00:41:33.942 --> 00:41:35.781
.  
   &gt;&gt; RICHARD FULCHER: So if we 

00:41:35.782 --> 00:41:37.782
revisit 

00:41:39.021 --> 00:41:41.058
these apps, they feel much more 
distinct and like themselves, 

00:41:41.059 --> 00:41:43.695
which is the goal.  We haven't 
changed any essential 

00:41:44.307 --> 00:41:46.307
structuring of the information. 
It's all the same content and 

00:41:48.004 --> 00:41:49.639
navigation, but we've added a 
lot more of the brand's 

00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:51.640
character in through this work.

00:41:53.538 --> 00:41:55.972
And, everything that you see is 
still entirely consistent with 

00:41:55.973 --> 00:42:00.073
the fundamental principles of 
material design.  We are not 

00:42:00.074 --> 00:42:02.169
introducing anything that's 
going to be unfamiliar to the 

00:42:02.170 --> 00:42:05.007
user.  They're still going to be
able to work through these 

00:42:05.008 --> 00:42:07.052
systems.  Crane is still making 
use of bold 

00:42:11.127 --> 00:42:13.375
color, but it's flexible enough 
to be able to tell a selection 

00:42:13.376 --> 00:42:18.128
state from an error state, as we
saw.  Reply is using a different

00:42:18.129 --> 00:42:21.402
style of icons, but they are 
still recognizable and familiar 

00:42:21.403 --> 00:42:23.403
to the user.

00:42:24.877 --> 00:42:27.128
And shrine is still giving 
separated surfaces so they know 

00:42:27.129 --> 00:42:32.036
where they can touch and how the
surfaces might respond.  That's 

00:42:32.037 --> 00:42:33.885
the power of Material theming 
and the goal we have been 

00:42:33.886 --> 00:42:38.788
chasing.  Starting from the 
foundation of Material itself 

00:42:38.789 --> 00:42:42.891
that solid Material foundation 
of good design, and customizing 

00:42:42.892 --> 00:42:44.731
the experience through key 
attributes which have 

00:42:44.732 --> 00:42:46.732
wide-ranging impacts throughout 
the experience.  

00:42:48.001 --> 00:42:50.035
Today we've just kind of 
concentrated on three of our 

00:42:50.036 --> 00:42:52.036
example apps.

00:42:55.544 --> 00:42:57.544
There are actually four more at 
material.

00:43:00.688 --> 00:43:03.557
oi so you can see other 
customization options to get a 

00:43:03.558 --> 00:43:06.198
sense of the full capability.  
While you're there, you can see 

00:43:06.199 --> 00:43:08.199
how 

00:43:09.935 --> 00:43:11.935
other real brands are using 
Material theming.

00:43:13.312 --> 00:43:15.312
So you can read about how we 
applied 

00:43:16.407 --> 00:43:18.249
the Google Material theme to 
products like Gmail, news, pay, 

00:43:18.250 --> 00:43:20.250
and home.

00:43:21.505 --> 00:43:23.730
And, over the last year, we've 
partnered with the stellar 

00:43:23.731 --> 00:43:25.731
design teams 

00:43:30.088 --> 00:43:32.586
from genius, Lyft, and Zappos to
help bring Material design into

their 

00:43:35.886 --> 00:43:38.183
products YOCHLs.  You can read 
about these partners and 

00:43:40.660 --> 00:43:46.789
Material on Material.io as well.
    This is just the start.  We 

00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:49.429
will be adding new components, 
options, guidance, and examples 

00:43:49.430 --> 00:43:53.542
on a regular basis.  We're very 
excited to see what you do with 

00:43:53.543 --> 00:43:55.543
Material design.  Thank you for 
joining us today.  

00:43:57.981 --> 00:43:59.981
[ Applause ] 

00:44:03.844 --> 00:44:08.963
    If you would like to learn a
little bit more, we have 

00:44:08.964 --> 00:44:13.042
sessions coming up, about four 
or five different sessions that 

00:44:13.043 --> 00:44:15.043
cover different aspects of 
Material 

00:44:16.222 --> 00:44:18.222
throughout the remaining couple 
of days 

00:44:19.871 --> 00:44:22.924
of I/O.  There's a session later
today on stage 4 that goes 

00:44:22.925 --> 00:44:25.194
deeper into using Material to 
design and build across 

00:44:25.402 --> 00:44:28.453
platforms.  It's a good session,
and you will probably enjoy it 

00:44:28.454 --> 00:44:30.454
as well.

00:44:31.931 --> 00:44:34.583
And we also have just outside 
this stage is the design and 

00:44:34.584 --> 00:44:36.584
accessibility dome.

00:44:37.873 --> 00:44:40.519
We will be there throughout all 
of I/O.  Come.  I'm sure you'll 

00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:44.811
have questions.  We are happy to
answer them there at the dome.  

00:44:44.812 --> 00:44:46.812
Meet designers from the Material
team.

00:44:48.098 --> 00:44:52.177
You can see demos of Material

00:44:52.178 --> 00:44:54.178
You can also get a designer 
review for your app.

00:44:56.648 --> 00:44:58.295
You can get a 15-minute slot to 
talk through what questions you 

00:44:58.296 --> 00:45:02.564
might have about material or 
design in general.  And we also 

00:45:02.565 --> 00:45:04.565
are going to be doing a 

00:45:06.026 --> 00:45:07.653
series of short ten-ish men knit
talks, small form on different 

00:45:07.654 --> 00:45:09.654

   &gt;&gt; GERARDO CAPIEL: Good 
afternoon, everyone.

01:17:57.293 --> 01:17:59.293
I'm GER rah Gerardo, with me is 
my 

01:18:01.177 --> 01:18:02.598
partner in crime, Varouj.  
   &gt;&gt; VAROUJ CHITILIAN: Who's 

01:18:02.599 --> 01:18:04.599
excited 

01:18:07.327 --> 01:18:09.327
about Google Pay today? 
   &gt;&gt; GERARDO CAPIEL: Great.

01:18:11.463 --> 01:18:13.930
So earlier this year, we unified
all of the ways that you can pay

01:18:13.931 --> 01:18:16.385
with Google into a single brand 
called Google Pay.

01:18:21.678 --> 01:18:23.712
With Google Pay, you can pay 
online and at millions of places

01:18:23.713 --> 01:18:25.713
all around the 

01:18:26.994 --> 01:18:29.505
world with the payment 
information that you saved in 

01:18:29.506 --> 01:18:31.506
your Google account.

01:18:32.564 --> 01:18:34.564
Today, we're going to be talking
about 

01:18:36.251 --> 01:18:38.251
the great ways in which we're 
making it 

01:18:40.148 --> 01:18:42.148
easier, faster, and more 
rewarding for 

01:18:43.265 --> 01:18:45.265
your customers to check out 
online and 

01:18:46.698 --> 01:18:49.210
in stores.  
   &gt;&gt; VAROUJ CHITILIAN: We want 

01:18:49.211 --> 01:18:51.659
to make payments easy for 
everyone everywhere.

01:18:55.528 --> 01:18:57.771
See, Google Pay is not just an 
app.  Google Pay makes payments 

01:18:57.772 --> 01:19:01.866
a foundational and integral part
of a Google user's account.

01:19:04.970 --> 01:19:07.664
So, if a Google user is logged 
into any Google service, they 

01:19:07.665 --> 01:19:11.960
can experience amazing payment 
experiences that Google Pay 

01:19:11.961 --> 01:19:14.001
provides.  
    The other advantage to tying

01:19:15.463 --> 01:19:17.463
everything to one account is 
that 

01:19:18.778 --> 01:19:20.778
payment methods and transactions
can all 

01:19:23.409 --> 01:19:25.409
be managed in a central location

01:19:27.334 --> 01:19:29.334
.  Now we all know that mobile 
is the 

01:19:31.455 --> 01:19:33.455
fastest growing e commerce 
surface, but 

01:19:35.904 --> 01:19:38.576
your customers are transacting 
on all surfaces.  So we want to 

01:19:38.577 --> 01:19:40.577
make sure that with 

01:19:41.652 --> 01:19:43.652
Google Pay that Google users can
pay as 

01:19:45.101 --> 01:19:47.537
easily in stores with a tap as 
they can online at your sites 

01:19:47.538 --> 01:19:49.538
and apps, as well 

01:19:55.907 --> 01:19:57.907
as on Google, on Chrome, on 
YouTube

01:20:02.015 --> 01:20:04.015
, Google Play and even Google 
Assistant.  

01:20:04.022 --> 01:20:05.424
&gt;&gt; GERARDO CAPIEL: So what's in 
it for all of you developers out

01:20:05.425 --> 01:20:07.665
here in the crowd? Currently, 
there are hundreds of 

01:20:11.002 --> 01:20:13.002
millions of payment methods 
saved to 

01:20:16.730 --> 01:20:18.991
Google Accounts when users 
transact on Play or when they 

01:20:18.992 --> 01:20:20.992
save their cards in Chrome.

01:20:23.250 --> 01:20:25.250
We know from operating

01:20:26.539 --> 01:20:28.539
Google

01:20:30.457 --> 01:20:33.113
Play that these users that have 
saved payment methods to their 

01:20:33.114 --> 01:20:35.114
account are 

01:20:36.832 --> 01:20:37.843
much more likely to complete a 
transaction than when they 

01:20:37.844 --> 01:20:39.844
haven't.

01:20:41.726 --> 01:20:43.726
And we call these users 
ready-to-pay users.  

01:20:46.639 --> 01:20:48.639
Via our APIs, we're going to 
enable 

01:20:49.723 --> 01:20:52.603
these ready-to-pay users to also
check out quickly and easily in 

01:20:52.604 --> 01:20:54.604
your own apps 

01:20:55.653 --> 01:20:57.653
and websites, which means that 
you're 

01:20:59.583 --> 01:21:01.659
going to see increased 
conversion rates, faster 

01:21:01.660 --> 01:21:03.660
monetization, and you'll be able

01:21:04.726 --> 01:21:06.726
to provide your customers with 
the same 

01:21:07.966 --> 01:21:09.966
easy, quick check-out experience
that we 

01:21:11.792 --> 01:21:14.576
provide on Play.  
    Speaking of payment methods,

01:21:14.577 --> 01:21:17.020
let me turn to the Google Pay 
app.

01:21:20.514 --> 01:21:23.163
So in an upcoming update of the 
Google Pay app, we're going to 

01:21:23.164 --> 01:21:28.101
allow you to manage all the 
payment methods in your Google 

01:21:28.102 --> 01:21:30.950
account, not just the payment 
methods that you use to pay in 

01:21:30.951 --> 01:21:33.397
store.  And even better, we're 
going to 

01:21:36.672 --> 01:21:38.672
provide you with a holistic view
of all 

01:21:41.331 --> 01:21:43.545
your transactions, whether they 
be on Google Apps and services 

01:21:43.546 --> 01:21:45.546
such as Play 

01:21:46.579 --> 01:21:48.579
and YouTube, whether they be 
with 

01:21:50.708 --> 01:21:52.330
third-party merchants such as 
Walgreen's and Uber, or whether 

01:21:52.331 --> 01:21:57.279
they're transactions that you've
made to friends and families via

01:21:57.280 --> 01:21:59.730
our peer-to-peer service.  And 
of course the app is available 

01:21:59.731 --> 01:22:03.875
on Android, but I'm really 
excited to tell you all that 

01:22:03.876 --> 01:22:05.876
we're bringing this 

01:22:07.754 --> 01:22:09.754
capability to iOS and the web.  
Whoo! 

01:22:10.817 --> 01:22:12.817
[ Applause ] 

01:22:17.021 --> 01:22:19.268
So let's dig a little deeper 
into the Google Pay app.

01:22:22.533 --> 01:22:24.383
If you open the app, you come to
a home tab, and hopefully many 

01:22:24.384 --> 01:22:27.466
of you have seen this.  And this
tab is personalized for you 

01:22:29.961 --> 01:22:31.589
based on the credit and debit 
cards in your Google account, 

01:22:31.590 --> 01:22:36.700
based on the loyalty programs 
that you have saved to Google 

01:22:36.701 --> 01:22:38.724
Pay, based on the offers you 
have saved to Google Pay, and 

01:22:38.725 --> 01:22:44.347
even based on the stores that 
are nearby you.  You can see 

01:22:44.348 --> 01:22:46.215
examples of the many types of 
cards that you might find in the

01:22:46.216 --> 01:22:50.776
home feed of the Google Pay app.
Now what's really exciting is 

01:22:50.777 --> 01:22:55.310
that some of these cards are 
actionable.  So for example, 

01:22:55.311 --> 01:22:57.311
this card that you see 

01:22:59.192 --> 01:23:01.440
here allows you to sign up for 
balanced rewards, or if you 

01:23:01.441 --> 01:23:04.291
already belong, its allows you 
to link your balanced rewards 

01:23:07.159 --> 01:23:09.880
account to your Google account. 
And this card is geoaware.

01:23:13.757 --> 01:23:15.757
It only shows up when you're at 
wall 

01:23:17.175 --> 01:23:19.175
green's

01:23:22.773 --> 01:23:26.890
Walgreen's.  So merchants out 
there and providers of loyalty 

01:23:26.891 --> 01:23:29.347
programs and offers programs 
that wish to take advantage of 

01:23:29.348 --> 01:23:33.606
these features should join the 
ranks of the hundreds of 

01:23:33.607 --> 01:23:35.607
partners that have 

01:23:36.892 --> 01:23:39.763
implemented the Google Pay APIs 
for loyalty.  And to learn more,

01:23:39.764 --> 01:23:41.764
I encourage you to go to G.

01:23:45.523 --> 01:23:47.523
co/pay/business.  

01:23:48.575 --> 01:23:50.575
Now, we're also working with 

01:23:52.176 --> 01:23:54.176
ticketing provider

01:23:55.736 --> 01:23:58.411
s so that our users can easily 
and quickly save event tickets 

01:23:58.412 --> 01:24:03.118
and boarding passes to their 
Google account, and then be able

01:24:03.119 --> 01:24:05.119
to access them right in the 
Google Pay app.

01:24:08.034 --> 01:24:10.061
I'm excited to announce some of 
our early access partners, some 

01:24:10.062 --> 01:24:12.310
of which I see out here in the 
crowd such as 

01:24:20.385 --> 01:24:22.385
Singapore Airlines, Southwest,

01:24:25.773 --> 01:24:28.027
EventBrite, and Fortress GB, who
provides ticketing 

01:24:28.028 --> 01:24:30.087
infrastructure for soccer 
matches in the UK and beyond.

01:24:33.542 --> 01:24:35.542
I will now turn it to Varouj.  

01:24:37.826 --> 01:24:40.277
&gt;&gt; VAROUJ CHITILIAN: So Google 
Pay covers most of what is in 

01:24:40.278 --> 01:24:44.801
your wallet, but transit is a 
massive use case.  Google Pay 

01:24:44.802 --> 01:24:46.802
already supports transit 

01:24:49.335 --> 01:24:51.335
and has for a while at transit 
agencies 

01:24:53.211 --> 01:24:55.211
that accept contactless credit 
or debit cards.

01:24:58.119 --> 01:25:00.119
We see transactions in London, 

01:25:03.191 --> 01:25:05.191
Chicago, Kiev, portland, and 
coming soon in Vancouver.

01:25:07.510 --> 01:25:09.510
But if we only support 
contactless 

01:25:11.805 --> 01:25:14.470
credit and debit cards for 
transit, we will leave a large 

01:25:14.471 --> 01:25:16.471
portion of our Google 

01:25:20.190 --> 01:25:22.190
users that use TRAtraditional 
cards underserved.

01:25:23.246 --> 01:25:25.246
So we have been partnering with 

01:25:27.895 --> 01:25:29.895
providers like NXP

01:25:34.698 --> 01:25:36.698
and others to natively accept 
these payments within the app.

01:25:38.977 --> 01:25:40.999
You may have heard that we 
launched in las Vegas as well as

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.058
in portland.  And today we would
like to announce 

01:25:46.557 --> 01:25:48.794
that coming soon we will have 
support in West Midlands in the 

01:25:48.795 --> 01:25:50.795
UK.  So very, very exciting.

01:26:03.717 --> 01:26:07.717
ITSO and others to natively 
accept these payments within the

01:26:03.717 --> 01:26:07.983
app.  You may have heard that we
launched in las Vegas as well as

01:26:03.717 --> 01:26:07.783
in portland.  And today we would
like to announce that coming 

01:26:03.717 --> 01:26:07.583
soon we will have support in 
West Midlands in the UK.  So 

01:26:03.717 --> 01:26:06.160
very, very exciting.  
    Google Pay is already 

01:26:06.161 --> 01:26:08.608
available to hundreds of users 
in 18 markets.

01:26:12.279 --> 01:26:14.279
Just recently, Google Pay passed
100 

01:26:17.794 --> 01:26:19.794
million downloads in the Google 
Play store.

01:26:23.838 --> 01:26:25.489
But we're not stopping there.  
Very soon, we will be launching 

01:26:25.490 --> 01:26:27.490
many 

01:26:30.373 --> 01:26:33.697
of the core features and the 
Google Pay app globally.  That 

01:26:33.698 --> 01:26:35.740
means that billions of users 
worldwide will be able to 

01:26:35.741 --> 01:26:38.208
leverage the amazing payment 
experiences that Google Pay 

01:26:38.209 --> 01:26:40.209
provides.

01:26:43.301 --> 01:26:45.301
So we're very, very excited 
about this.  

01:26:46.208 --> 01:26:48.208
&gt;&gt; GERARDO CAPIEL: It is super 
exciting.

01:26:51.077 --> 01:26:53.605
And users in the UK and the US 
have one more thing to be 

01:26:53.997 --> 01:26:55.997
excited about.

01:26:57.733 --> 01:27:00.002
We are bringing peer-to-peer 
payment right into the Google 

01:27:00.003 --> 01:27:02.673
app.  That means you will be 
able to send 

01:27:05.728 --> 01:27:09.432
and request money directly from 
the app on the send tab.  But 

01:27:09.433 --> 01:27:11.874
more exciting than that is you 
will be able to easily split for

01:27:11.875 --> 01:27:13.923
those tickets -- that purchase 
for tickets to 

01:27:17.009 --> 01:27:19.267
the soccer game or the drinks at
the pub, easily, right from the 

01:27:19.268 --> 01:27:23.988
Google Pay app.  So if you pull 
up the transaction details after

01:27:23.989 --> 01:27:26.441
paying for drinks at the pub, 
right from there, you will be 

01:27:26.442 --> 01:27:32.202
able to split the expense with 
your friends.  Super exciting.  

01:27:32.203 --> 01:27:34.454
   &gt;&gt; VAROUJ CHITILIAN: Awesome.
And guess what?

01:27:38.781 --> 01:27:40.403
For many of these payment 
experiences, you don't even need

01:27:40.404 --> 01:27:42.404
to have the Google Pay app 
installed.

01:27:47.570 --> 01:27:49.570
Our P2P experience is embedded 
in 

01:27:54.330 --> 01:27:56.330
Gmail, contacts, assistant, 
Android 

01:28:01.189 --> 01:28:03.189
messages and Apple iMessages

01:28:05.438 --> 01:28:07.895
.  Last year we demonstrated how
users can directly add credit or

01:28:07.896 --> 01:28:13.015
debit cards from their bank's 
mobile apps to Google Pay.  But 

01:28:13.016 --> 01:28:15.906
now you can sign up for a new 
credit or debit card in the 

01:28:15.907 --> 01:28:20.405
mobile banking app, add that 
privilege to Google Pay and 

01:28:20.406 --> 01:28:23.051
start using it even before the 
credit or debit card arrives in 

01:28:23.052 --> 01:28:26.555
the mail.  Isn't that awesome? 
   &gt;&gt; GERARDO CAPIEL: It's 

01:28:26.556 --> 01:28:30.483
pretty cool.  That is pretty 
cool.  And so now that we've 

01:28:30.484 --> 01:28:34.558
taken you through this whirlwind
tour of everything that's been 

01:28:34.559 --> 01:28:36.559
happening since 

01:28:37.639 --> 01:28:39.673
we were last up here, which has 
been dizzying, and it's the 

01:28:39.674 --> 01:28:41.674
things that are 

01:28:42.750 --> 01:28:44.779
making it easier, simpler, and 
more rewarding for our users to 

01:28:44.780 --> 01:28:47.456
pay online and in stores, let's 
talk about the 

01:28:51.738 --> 01:28:53.583
specific ways in which you all 
here can create great 

01:28:53.584 --> 01:28:55.584
experiences for your 

01:28:57.479 --> 01:28:59.479
customers online and in stores. 

01:29:01.498 --> 01:29:03.498
So let's STARTD start with 
online.

01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:08.165
What I really like about online 
is its scale.  There are 

01:29:08.166 --> 01:29:10.210
millions and millions of 
merchants all around the world 

01:29:10.211 --> 01:29:14.754
where you can buy things online.
And we want to make every single

01:29:14.755 --> 01:29:16.755
one 

01:29:17.821 --> 01:29:19.821
of those check-out experiences 
great.

01:29:21.879 --> 01:29:24.945
So that means that we need 
solutions that scale.  And 

01:29:24.946 --> 01:29:26.946
ideally, they are solutions 
where 

01:29:28.224 --> 01:29:32.336
you don't have to do anything or
just do very little.  Chrome 

01:29:32.337 --> 01:29:34.337
autofill is one of those 
experiences.

01:29:38.343 --> 01:29:41.041
Chrome autofill removes the 
hassle from users of having to 

01:29:41.042 --> 01:29:44.093
type in credit card numbers, 
shipping addresses and billing 

01:29:44.094 --> 01:29:46.094
addresses.  It makes it super 
simple.

01:29:50.083 --> 01:29:52.083
So hopefully your site already 
works 

01:29:54.123 --> 01:29:56.123
perfectly with Chrome autofill, 
but we know there's a number out

01:29:56.551 --> 01:30:01.447
there that don't.  So we want to
make sure that your users are 

01:30:01.448 --> 01:30:04.705
able to take advantage of 
autofill as fast as possible.  

01:30:04.706 --> 01:30:07.152
And we've published a set of 
guidelines and best practices 

01:30:07.153 --> 01:30:09.153
that will 

01:30:10.868 --> 01:30:12.868
enable you to test and optimize 
your 

01:30:15.012 --> 01:30:17.012
check-out forms for Chrome 
autofill.

01:30:18.871 --> 01:30:20.871
To learn more, go to G.

01:30:23.023 --> 01:30:27.732
co/pay/autofill.  Or when you 
exit out of here, visit our 

01:30:27.733 --> 01:30:29.780
sandbox right across the way and
speak with our engineers about 

01:30:29.781 --> 01:30:31.781
how you 

01:30:34.220 --> 01:30:36.220
can optimize your check-out flow
.  

01:30:37.322 --> 01:30:39.572
&gt;&gt; VAROUJ CHITILIAN: So if we 
focused exclusively on autofill,

01:30:39.573 --> 01:30:43.909
we would be doing Google users a
disservice.  The north star here

01:30:43.910 --> 01:30:46.160
is really to skip the check-out 
form all together.

01:30:49.233 --> 01:30:51.233
And that's where the Google Pay 
APIs 

01:30:52.919 --> 01:30:55.377
for checkout come in.  Now we 
announced the online payment 

01:30:59.269 --> 01:31:01.773
APIs last year, but since then, 
we made three major enhancements

01:31:01.774 --> 01:31:03.774
that I'd like 

01:31:05.180 --> 01:31:07.180
to talk to you about

01:31:08.277 --> 01:31:10.277
.  FWHURNL

01:31:13.066 --> 01:31:15.228
Number one, we're announce ing
ing JavaScript bindings for the 

01:31:15.229 --> 01:31:19.691
Google Pay check-out.  You can 
provide the great experiences 

01:31:25.430 --> 01:31:27.430
that Google Pay provides across 
all browsers.  

01:31:29.131 --> 01:31:31.359
And a very consistent JSON 
representation of request and 

01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:33.360
response objects.

01:31:34.838 --> 01:31:36.838
If you implement the Google Pay 
APIs 

01:31:38.482 --> 01:31:40.134
for check-out for web in 
JavaScript, you can easily port 

01:31:40.135 --> 01:31:42.135
that, including the 

01:31:44.531 --> 01:31:47.313
payment processing to your app, 
and also to Google Assistant.

01:31:50.343 --> 01:31:52.343
I actually want to show you a 
quick 

01:31:53.442 --> 01:31:55.442
demo here -- not a demo, but a 
screen 

01:31:56.512 --> 01:31:58.557
share of what we've done with 
Fandango that's coming soon 

01:31:58.558 --> 01:32:00.558
where you can get an 

01:32:04.826 --> 01:32:06.826
easy check-out experience from 
Google

01:32:07.969 --> 01:32:09.969
Search when you use a Google Pay
APIs for check-out.

01:32:13.742 --> 01:32:15.742
So a user searches for tickets 
on Google.

01:32:17.196 --> 01:32:19.196
com and they go to the Fandango 
site 

01:32:21.912 --> 01:32:23.331
where they can easily select and
purchase tickets using Google 

01:32:23.332 --> 01:32:25.332
Pay.  So very exciting.  

01:32:29.502 --> 01:32:31.502
And the last thing, last 
enhancement 

01:32:32.561 --> 01:32:37.043
that I'd like to talk about is 
we've enhanced our readytoPay 

01:32:37.044 --> 01:32:39.044
API.

01:32:40.700 --> 01:32:42.751
You can tell whether a user 
enters -- a customer on your 

01:32:42.752 --> 01:32:45.200
site if they have a payment 
method that you can actually 

01:32:45.607 --> 01:32:49.897
accept.  What this allows you to
do is now that you know this is 

01:32:49.898 --> 01:32:51.898
a ready to pay user, 

01:32:53.146 --> 01:32:55.850
you can really streamline the 
check-out experience and really 

01:32:55.851 --> 01:33:01.216
drive increased conversions.  
   &gt;&gt; GERARDO CAPIEL: Great.  

01:33:01.217 --> 01:33:02.655
That's pretty cool.  
   &gt;&gt; VAROUJ CHITILIAN: Let's 

01:33:02.656 --> 01:33:05.151
see this stuff in action.  
   &gt;&gt; GERARDO CAPIEL: It is 

01:33:05.152 --> 01:33:07.822
cooler when you see it in 
action.  Let's turn to the 

01:33:07.823 --> 01:33:11.684
computer.  Last year when we 
were up here, we showed you the 

01:33:11.685 --> 01:33:13.685
great check-out 

01:33:14.741 --> 01:33:16.741
experience that we created on 
the web, 

01:33:17.997 --> 01:33:20.883
but it was limited to Chrome on 
Android.  We have now extended 

01:33:20.884 --> 01:33:22.884
this to many 

01:33:24.185 --> 01:33:26.185
other browsers such as safari 
such as 

01:33:29.157 --> 01:33:31.056
desktop and iOS, firefox, etch, 
and internet explorer are coming

01:33:31.057 --> 01:33:33.057
soon.

01:33:34.945 --> 01:33:36.181
And you will be able to play 
with this yourselves right after

01:33:36.182 --> 01:33:38.182
this slide.  I'm on our demo 
site.

01:33:42.328 --> 01:33:46.033
Time to get new Google gear.  I 
like the shell.  So I go to the 

01:33:46.034 --> 01:33:48.034
product details page 

01:33:51.963 --> 01:33:55.015
and I see a "buyBuy With Google 
Pay" button.  Over 60% of online

01:33:55.016 --> 01:33:57.016
purchases are really just for 
one item.

01:34:02.571 --> 01:34:04.993
So why put users through a 
multi-step check-out flow where 

01:34:04.994 --> 01:34:06.994
they have to add to a cart and 
the other steps?

01:34:10.963 --> 01:34:12.199
Let's just let them buy what 
they want directly from product 

01:34:12.200 --> 01:34:14.200
details.  When I click there, 
because I was 

01:34:16.934 --> 01:34:18.934
already logged into my Google 
account, 

01:34:20.348 --> 01:34:22.348
checking Gmail or YouTube, I'm 
automatically logged in.

01:34:24.442 --> 01:34:26.290
I see the payment methods that I
have saved to my Google account 

01:34:26.291 --> 01:34:28.291
and other information such as my
shipping address.

01:34:32.006 --> 01:34:34.548
And then I hit continue, and 
Voila, I am done.  It's that 

01:34:34.549 --> 01:34:40.061
simple.  Okay? 
    So, that's cool.  But on 

01:34:40.062 --> 01:34:42.914
Chrome, we're doing something 
even more cool in the near 

01:34:42.915 --> 01:34:44.915
future.

01:34:49.021 --> 01:34:51.021
So on Chrome, we are creating a 
near 

01:34:52.523 --> 01:34:55.189
native experience that is fast 
and seamless and tightly 

01:34:55.190 --> 01:34:57.190
integrated into Chrome.

01:34:59.474 --> 01:35:01.718
As you can see right here, when 
I move my window around, things 

01:35:01.719 --> 01:35:05.206
stay in place.  And this is 
really great.  Let's turn it 

01:35:05.207 --> 01:35:07.207
back to the slides, please.  

01:35:09.321 --> 01:35:11.321
So if you want to check this out

01:35:12.373 --> 01:35:14.663
yourselves on your iPhone or on 
your desktop, go to G.

01:35:19.710 --> 01:35:21.710
co/pay/webdemo.  

01:35:24.701 --> 01:35:26.701
So fewer distractions, faster 

01:35:30.895 --> 01:35:33.576
check-out, simpler check-out 
means greater conversion.  And 

01:35:33.577 --> 01:35:36.279
we're pretty confident that 
you're going to see these types 

01:35:36.280 --> 01:35:38.280
of results when 

01:35:39.957 --> 01:35:41.957
you implement the Google Pay 
API.

01:35:44.430 --> 01:35:46.476
Since we announced Google Pay, 
the response from merchants has 

01:35:46.477 --> 01:35:48.477
been overwhelming all around the
world.

01:35:51.857 --> 01:35:53.857
We've added merchants such as 
Uber and 

01:35:56.377 --> 01:35:58.469
Doordash, Asos, Deliveroo, and 
soon coming? Starbucks.  

01:36:02.138 --> 01:36:04.138
And our partners are seeing 
great results.

01:36:07.234 --> 01:36:08.660
StubHub, for example, since 
they've implemented the newest 

01:36:08.661 --> 01:36:11.501
version of our API has seen a 7X
increase in 

01:36:16.677 --> 01:36:18.677
transactions through Google Pay,
and air 

01:36:19.953 --> 01:36:21.953
BnB saw an 11% increase in 
transactions through Google Pay.

01:36:23.039 --> 01:36:25.039
And it's interesting and great 
that 

01:36:26.938 --> 01:36:28.938
Hotel Tonight has found that 
users that 

01:36:29.989 --> 01:36:31.989
use Google Pay to complete a 
booking are 

01:36:39.348 --> 01:36:41.358
65% more likely to complete the 
transaction than those who 

01:36:41.359 --> 01:36:45.373
don't.  Varouj, tell us more.  
   &gt;&gt; VAROUJ CHITILIAN: If you 

01:36:45.374 --> 01:36:47.627
guys take one thing away from 
I/O on the payment 

01:36:51.790 --> 01:36:53.846
side, you should definitely 
figure out how you're going to 

01:36:53.847 --> 01:36:55.847
implement these 

01:36:57.730 --> 01:36:59.555
Google Pay APIs for Check-Out on
your surfaces to give your 

01:36:59.556 --> 01:37:02.844
customers incredible payment 
experiences.  We have two 

01:37:02.845 --> 01:37:04.845
additional sessions that you can
go to.

01:37:07.782 --> 01:37:09.467
The first is tomorrow, what's 
new for online check-out on 

01:37:09.468 --> 01:37:13.986
stage 6.  And the second is by 
our UX team.  It's called the 

01:37:13.987 --> 01:37:15.987
Google Pay best practices for 
great payment experiences.

01:37:18.546 --> 01:37:20.546
And that's on stage 7 on 
Thursday.

01:37:23.111 --> 01:37:25.111
So please go and check those 
out.

01:37:30.482 --> 01:37:33.553
   &gt;&gt; GERARDO CAPIEL: Great.  
Let's talk next about something 

01:37:33.554 --> 01:37:38.762
that users love more than saving
time.  Saving money.  Who 

01:37:38.763 --> 01:37:40.763
doesn't love to save money?

01:37:44.101 --> 01:37:46.101
So, Google Pay is more than just
a way 

01:37:47.502 --> 01:37:49.502
to pay

01:37:51.618 --> 01:37:53.645
.  We've invested heavily into 
making Google Pay a platform by 

01:37:53.646 --> 01:37:57.350
which you can engage your users 
through loyalty and offers.

01:38:00.672 --> 01:38:02.672
In previous years, we've been up
here 

01:38:05.103 --> 01:38:07.103
and we talked about our

01:38:09.869 --> 01:38:11.869
smartSmart Tap protocol, based 
on NFC, 

01:38:13.213 --> 01:38:15.677
which allows users who are in 
store to tap once and convey 

01:38:15.678 --> 01:38:17.701
their loyalty credentials and 
offers along with payment 

01:38:17.702 --> 01:38:20.407
information.  It's a great 
experience, and merchants 

01:38:23.512 --> 01:38:25.512
all around the world have been 

01:38:26.992 --> 01:38:28.821
implementing Smart Tap and 
creating great value-added 

01:38:28.822 --> 01:38:30.822
check-out experiences for their 
users.

01:38:33.751 --> 01:38:35.751
So I'm excited to announce today
that 

01:38:36.760 --> 01:38:38.760
Russia

01:38:41.951 --> 01:38:43.951
's Sberbank is the latest 
partner that 

01:38:46.682 --> 01:38:48.705
will be rolling out Smart Tap 
across thousands of users in 

01:38:48.706 --> 01:38:50.706
Russia.  

01:38:52.342 --> 01:38:55.751
&gt;&gt; VAROUJ CHITILIAN: Burr we But
we're not stopping there.  We're

01:38:55.752 --> 01:38:57.752
working with tickets as well.

01:38:59.225 --> 01:39:01.684
We have an incredible demo today
that we have done with our 

01:39:01.685 --> 01:39:05.360
partners at Ticket Master that 
brings everything together into 

01:39:05.361 --> 01:39:08.205
one demo.  So, let's go to the 
film.

01:39:13.155 --> 01:39:15.155
So you'll have to use your 
imagination here.

01:39:16.665 --> 01:39:20.783
Let's all pretend you're in 
Orlando.  Excuse the humidity.  

01:39:20.784 --> 01:39:22.784
And I'm a massive soccer fan, 
and my 

01:39:23.896 --> 01:39:25.896
favorite team is the Chicago 
Fire of the MLS.

01:39:29.834 --> 01:39:31.834
So Chicago Fire is visiting 
Orlando 

01:39:33.306 --> 01:39:35.306
city, and I really want to check
out 

01:39:36.778 --> 01:39:38.778
this game with Gerardo.

01:39:40.299 --> 01:39:42.351
I'm going to open the Ticket 
Master app, and since they're my

01:39:42.352 --> 01:39:44.352
favorite team, it will be in 
favorites.

01:39:48.013 --> 01:39:50.013
So now I select the game

01:39:52.740 --> 01:39:54.740
.  I select a ticket

01:39:58.148 --> 01:40:00.148
.  Do "Buy Now.

01:40:01.154 --> 01:40:03.154
"

01:40:05.728 --> 01:40:07.728
And here we see the "buy with 
Google 

01:40:12.464 --> 01:40:14.464
Pay button," so I'll give that a
click

01:40:16.235 --> 01:40:18.659
.  And complete check-out.  
Boom.  I've purchased these 

01:40:18.660 --> 01:40:21.340
tickets.  
[ Applause ] 

01:40:22.986 --> 01:40:24.245
&gt;&gt; GERARDO CAPIEL: It gets 
better, though.  It gets better.

01:40:24.246 --> 01:40:26.246
   &gt;&gt; VAROUJ CHITILIAN: What's 
that? 

01:40:26.906 --> 01:40:28.906
&gt;&gt; GERARDO CAPIEL: It gets 
better.  

01:40:29.201 --> 01:40:32.041
&gt;&gt; VAROUJ CHITILIAN: Oh yeah, it
gets better.  Yeah.  Now I can 

01:40:32.042 --> 01:40:34.042
view these tickets.

01:40:35.900 --> 01:40:37.317
And here we see the save to 
phone buttons that Gerardo 

01:40:37.318 --> 01:40:39.318
mentioned.

01:40:41.539 --> 01:40:43.539
So I can save this

01:40:46.979 --> 01:40:48.979
ticket to Google Pay.

01:40:53.873 --> 01:40:55.873
So now, let's open the Google 
Pay app

01:41:01.105 --> 01:41:03.105
.  When I go to the cards, I now
notice 

01:41:04.368 --> 01:41:06.368
that I have my tickets here for 
Orlando 

01:41:07.828 --> 01:41:10.715
SC versus Chicago Fire, and I'm 
all ready to go to this game.  

01:41:10.716 --> 01:41:12.806
I'm super excited.  
   &gt;&gt; GERARDO CAPIEL: Get your 

01:41:12.807 --> 01:41:14.415
gear on. 
   &gt;&gt; VAROUJ CHITILIAN: And 

01:41:14.416 --> 01:41:16.416
here's the 

01:41:17.527 --> 01:41:19.356
kicker -- no pun intended -- I 
can actually go to the gate to 

01:41:19.357 --> 01:41:24.471
get into the game, and I don't 
need to fiddle around with paper

01:41:24.472 --> 01:41:27.967
tickets and I don't need to scan
QR codes.  All I need to do -- 

01:41:27.968 --> 01:41:32.888
   &gt;&gt; GERARDO CAPIEL: Let's turn
it to the demo.  Thank you.  

01:41:37.320 --> 01:41:40.297
[ Beeping ]. 
   &gt;&gt; VAROUJ CHITILIAN: Tap, and

01:41:40.298 --> 01:41:42.298
I gain 

01:41:44.003 --> 01:41:46.003
entry into the stadium.  
[ Applause ] 

01:41:47.062 --> 01:41:49.288
And I go along my way.  These 
are the incredible user journeys

01:41:51.129 --> 01:41:53.129
that we can create together with
these 

01:41:54.150 --> 01:41:56.150
APIs

01:41:58.659 --> 01:42:00.659
.  Back to the slides

01:42:02.403 --> 01:42:04.247
.  
   &gt;&gt; GERARDO CAPIEL: Okay.  

01:42:04.248 --> 01:42:08.742
That was great.  Now that we've 
overloaded you with information 

01:42:08.743 --> 01:42:11.626
about all the great things that 
you can do with Google Pay, what

01:42:13.877 --> 01:42:16.311
are next steps? 
    So, the first one is super 

01:42:16.312 --> 01:42:21.318
easy, because it just takes a 
few steps.  You exit out this 

01:42:21.319 --> 01:42:25.558
door and you head over to our 
sandbox, and there you can meet 

01:42:25.559 --> 01:42:25.983
with the engineers that have 
built all of these amazing 

01:42:25.984 --> 01:42:27.984
things.

01:42:31.853 --> 01:42:33.853
You can get your questions 
answered.  You can get demos.

01:42:34.999 --> 01:42:36.690
And some of the demos EECHB get 
even get you cookies, and I'm 

01:42:36.691 --> 01:42:38.691
not 

01:42:42.439 --> 01:42:44.439
talking browser cookies, but 
real tasty, good cookies.  

01:42:44.709 --> 01:42:46.709
&gt;&gt; VAROUJ CHITILIAN: I'm getting
hungry.  

01:42:46.749 --> 01:42:49.199
&gt;&gt; GERARDO CAPIEL: There are 
several deep dives the rest of 

01:42:49.200 --> 01:42:51.034
this week into the different 
things that we talked about 

01:42:51.035 --> 01:42:53.325
today.  First of all, I would 
encourage you to 

01:42:56.619 --> 01:42:58.619
go check out tomorrow night at 
6:30 on 

01:42:59.681 --> 01:43:01.681
this stage the what's new for 
online 

01:43:03.579 --> 01:43:06.049
checkNew For Online Checkout 
session, which is going to be 

01:43:06.050 --> 01:43:08.938
run by our engineers that have 
built all of these amazing 

01:43:08.939 --> 01:43:10.939
things.  And then on Thursday, 
our payments UX 

01:43:14.304 --> 01:43:16.304
team is going to be doing a 
session on 

01:43:18.786 --> 01:43:22.868
Best Practices forFor Creating 
Great Check-out Flows.  They 

01:43:22.869 --> 01:43:25.822
will go a lot deeper and beyond.
And then finally, on Thursday 

01:43:29.719 --> 01:43:31.719
afternoon, right near here on 
stage 5, 

01:43:32.958 --> 01:43:34.411
you can learn about how you can 
add transactional capabilities 

01:43:34.412 --> 01:43:38.923
to your actions.  
   &gt;&gt; VAROUJ CHITILIAN: So if 

01:43:38.924 --> 01:43:43.432
you can't make these sessions or
the sandbox or if you're 

01:43:43.433 --> 01:43:45.433
watching on live stream and you 

01:43:46.496 --> 01:43:48.732
want to learn more, these are 
some of the resources you can go

01:43:48.733 --> 01:43:50.733

are a partnership between us.  

01:44:36.375 --> 01:44:37.788

experiences to your customers 

01:44:37.789 --> 01:44:42.552

Today we're going be 
introduceing .

02:17:55.145 --> 02:17:57.145
app domain names.

02:17:58.839 --> 02:18:00.839
I'm Ben McIlwain, and I'm the 
lead 

02:18:01.852 --> 02:18:03.852
developer

02:18:07.711 --> 02:18:09.711
engineer at Google registry. 

02:18:10.739 --> 02:18:13.391
&gt;&gt; ADRIENNE PORTER FELT: I'm 
Adrienne Porter Felt, and I'm a 

02:18:13.392 --> 02:18:15.392
long time 

02:18:16.696 --> 02:18:19.534
engineer on the Google Chrome 
team.  About a year ago, Ben 

02:18:19.535 --> 02:18:23.410
came to my team and I with an 
idea.  He worked on the registry

02:18:23.411 --> 02:18:29.076
team, and they had an idea that 
they were going to be launching

02:18:36.967 --> 02:18:38.967
this TLD, top-level domain to 
make 

02:18:41.321 --> 02:18:43.579
memorable and meaningful domain 
names.  I'm sure many of you 

02:18:43.580 --> 02:18:46.651
like short meaningful domain 
names.  We also like them in 

02:18:46.652 --> 02:18:50.322
terms of usability of the web.  
We think that URLs are easier to

02:18:50.323 --> 02:18:52.352
use if the domains are something
that people 

02:18:55.895 --> 02:18:57.349
can actually remember, and 
ideally differentiate between 

02:18:57.350 --> 02:18:59.350
the real brands when they're 
trying to actually get to 

02:19:01.222 --> 02:19:03.222
that website, versus other 
content that 

02:19:05.331 --> 02:19:07.331
might be spam, phishing or 
spoofing.

02:19:09.361 --> 02:19:12.717
But that wasn't all.  
    Ben was aware of the fact 

02:19:12.718 --> 02:19:14.718
that 

02:19:18.998 --> 02:19:20.998
Google has been pushing on

02:19:23.140 --> 02:19:25.368
HTTPS adoption to make the web 
safer.  It keeps our users' 

02:19:25.369 --> 02:19:29.080
content private and secure.  
HTTPS provides encryption 

02:19:29.081 --> 02:19:31.081
between the client and the 
server, such that anyone 

02:19:35.472 --> 02:19:37.472
in the middle like the ISP or 
someone 

02:19:40.184 --> 02:19:42.184
else on the same wireless 
network isn't 

02:19:43.493 --> 02:19:45.112
able to eves drop on the 
information while on transit or 

02:19:45.113 --> 02:19:47.113
modify it.

02:19:50.205 --> 02:19:53.085
And pushing out HTTPS adoption 
has been a big effort across 

02:19:53.086 --> 02:19:55.086
Google and the security 
community for the past several 

02:19:55.321 --> 02:19:57.321
years.

02:20:00.350 --> 02:20:03.304
Back in early 20 #15RKS which15,
we saw that only a quarter to a 

02:20:06.351 --> 02:20:08.351
third of pages loaded in Chrome 
were HTTPS.

02:20:10.796 --> 02:20:12.796
At that point

02:20:16.178 --> 02:20:18.620
, HTTP was dominant.  Now about 
75% of all page loads in 

02:20:22.233 --> 02:20:26.823
Chrome are RTS HTTPS, so we've 
seen a huge shift.  Now we're 

02:20:26.824 --> 02:20:28.824
looking at how to get the 

02:20:31.363 --> 02:20:33.363
last little chunk.  

02:20:34.425 --> 02:20:36.425
Looking back at 2014, Google 

02:20:39.582 --> 02:20:41.582
premiered HTTPS ranking boothing
inging 

02:20:44.511 --> 02:20:46.511
boost, so the idea was that 
sites would 

02:20:48.960 --> 02:20:50.960
get bumped if they encrypt

02:20:52.730 --> 02:20:54.730
.  Free HTTPS

02:20:59.325 --> 02:21:01.998
certificates launched, and 
helped a lot of sites get 

02:21:01.999 --> 02:21:03.999
online, particularly websites 
where the developers were not 

02:21:06.298 --> 02:21:08.298
able to previously afford 
certificates.

02:21:09.562 --> 02:21:12.413
Even though at 10, $15 was 
cheap, some were not able to 

02:21:12.414 --> 02:21:14.414
afford it.

02:21:15.474 --> 02:21:17.474
Google started indexing HTTPS 
sites by 

02:21:18.771 --> 02:21:21.442
default, meaning if a site was 
available on both, we would 

02:21:21.443 --> 02:21:24.505
index the HTTPS version.  We 
released a transparency report 

02:21:26.163 --> 02:21:28.163
showing that at the time only a 
quarter 

02:21:29.203 --> 02:21:31.456
of the top 100 sites supported 
HTTPS by default, and now it's 

02:21:31.457 --> 02:21:36.427
at 83.  Also, near and dear to 
my heart, starting in 2017, 

02:21:36.428 --> 02:21:38.428
Chrome started 

02:21:41.949 --> 02:21:43.949
labeling HTTP websites as not 
secure in 

02:21:47.446 --> 02:21:49.925
the URL bar if they had a 
password, form fields or a 

02:21:49.926 --> 02:21:51.926
credit card form field, because 
those are particularly sensitive

02:21:52.791 --> 02:21:54.791
field types.

02:21:56.054 --> 02:21:58.300
We ratcheted that up a bit and 
in mid 2017, we started labeling

02:21:58.301 --> 02:22:00.301
more pages as 

02:22:03.219 --> 02:22:05.219
not security if they had any 
HTTP page 

02:22:07.143 --> 02:22:09.143
in incognito or any HTTP page 
with form fields on it.

02:22:12.270 --> 02:22:15.169
And starting in Chrome 68 in 
July, all HTTP pages will be 

02:22:15.170 --> 02:22:17.422
labeled as "not secure" in the 
URL bar.

02:22:21.101 --> 02:22:22.122
Ben was aware of this and 
excited as was the rest of his 

02:22:22.123 --> 02:22:27.049
team.  They wanted to bring 
these two things together, a 

02:22:27.050 --> 02:22:29.050
product that encourages 
memorable domain name as well as

02:22:29.914 --> 02:22:32.583
security features of HTTPS.  So 
Ben, tell them what the idea 

02:22:32.584 --> 02:22:34.584
was.  

02:22:36.008 --> 02:22:38.008
&gt;&gt; BEN MCILWAIN: All right

02:22:41.397 --> 02:22:43.397
.  Today we are launching the 
world's 

02:22:46.954 --> 02:22:48.977
first entirely secure all HTTPS 
open top-level domain, and I 

02:22:48.978 --> 02:22:52.056
know that's a lot to unpack.  
First, what's a top-level 

02:22:52.057 --> 02:22:55.105
domain? Let's look at that.  So 
a top-level domain is the last 

02:22:55.106 --> 02:23:01.657
part of the domain name, right 
of the final dot.  Top-level 

02:23:01.658 --> 02:23:04.735
domains are run by registries 
like Google registry, that's my 

02:23:04.736 --> 02:23:06.736
team, for instance.

02:23:08.466 --> 02:23:10.466
That's in contrast to a domain 
name 

02:23:12.957 --> 02:23:14.957
registrar which is where you 
would go to buy a domain.

02:23:17.216 --> 02:23:19.251
The registries run their own 
TLD, and that TLD is only run by

02:23:19.252 --> 02:23:21.252
that registry.

02:23:22.925 --> 02:23:24.355
So you don't interact with the 
registries too much, but we're 

02:23:24.356 --> 02:23:28.457
the big database behind these.  
    Let's go through examples.

02:23:31.925 --> 02:23:33.925
Really obvious ones, .

02:23:36.029 --> 02:23:40.922
com, .net, and .org.

02:23:45.015 --> 02:23:46.843
Next up, we have the sponsored 
TLDs.  These have restrictions 

02:23:46.844 --> 02:23:50.770
on registration, and these ones 
have been out for a very long 

02:23:50.771 --> 02:23:52.813
time. .

02:23:56.488 --> 02:23:58.488
EDU, .

02:24:00.110 --> 02:24:05.262
gov, and .mil.  And the third 
level would be country 

02:24:08.795 --> 02:24:10.795
code like .

02:24:11.795 --> 02:24:13.795
uk

02:24:15.348 --> 02:24:17.348
,.

02:24:20.030 --> 02:24:22.030
de, and .io.

02:24:25.540 --> 02:24:27.802
It's a country domain name 
because it's two letters.

02:24:30.867 --> 02:24:32.867
IO is Indian ocean, if you 
didn't know.  

02:24:33.527 --> 02:24:35.527
And finally we get to the most 

02:24:36.984 --> 02:24:38.984
recent ones, the new generic 
TLDs.

02:24:40.042 --> 02:24:42.042
So we have .

02:24:43.249 --> 02:24:45.249
ho

02:24:47.977 --> 02:24:49.977
, and .Google.

02:24:52.173 --> 02:24:54.173
These three examples happen to 
be ones 

02:24:55.271 --> 02:24:57.271
run by my team at the Google 
registry.

02:25:01.612 --> 02:25:03.612
One interesting thing to notice 
is dot

02:25:11.224 --> 02:25:13.224
the middle one on the bottom is 
a unicode.  

02:25:14.213 --> 02:25:15.839
And, in addition to all of these
existing ones and thousands of 

02:25:15.840 --> 02:25:17.840
others 

02:25:19.313 --> 02:25:22.404
that already exist, today, 
specifically as of 9:00 a.m. 

02:25:22.405 --> 02:25:24.675
this morning, there is a new 
top-level domain on the web, and

02:25:24.676 --> 02:25:30.573
that top-level domain is .app.  
So yeah.  Today -- 

02:25:33.579 --> 02:25:37.917
[ Cheers and Applause ] 
    Thank you.  So yeah.  

02:25:37.918 --> 02:25:40.790
Introducing .app.  It is the new
home on the web for 

02:25:45.463 --> 02:25:47.463
mobile apps, web apps, 
progressive web 

02:25:51.404 --> 02:25:53.257
apps, desktop apps, app 
developers, and pretty much 

02:25:53.258 --> 02:25:55.258
anything you can imagine having 
to do with apps.

02:25:58.015 --> 02:26:00.917
We envision landing pages, 
server endpoints, marketing 

02:26:00.918 --> 02:26:02.918
pages, deep-linking 

02:26:04.340 --> 02:26:06.379
URLs that go specifically into a
specific piece of content and 

02:26:06.380 --> 02:26:09.269
pretty much anything else.

02:26:13.127 --> 02:26:15.196
It is open, so anyone can buy a 
.app domain name.

02:26:18.702 --> 02:26:20.322
Because the string is dot app, 
it would probably make sense to 

02:26:20.323 --> 02:26:22.323
use it for 

02:26:23.944 --> 02:26:25.944
something SOERNT associated with
dot app.  

02:26:28.160 --> 02:26:30.195
You should all pay attention to 
the rest of this talk, because 

02:26:30.196 --> 02:26:35.279
everyone here is getting a free 
.app domain name.  And not just 

02:26:35.280 --> 02:26:37.280
everyone in this room, 

02:26:40.783 --> 02:26:42.783
but every single attend eye of

02:26:45.075 --> 02:26:47.942
ee of I/O.  
    Please don't do that right 

02:26:47.943 --> 02:26:52.010
now.  Please pay attention to 
the rest of the presentation.  

02:26:52.011 --> 02:26:54.265
We're going to give you some 
useful tips on how to use them 

02:26:54.266 --> 02:26:56.542
and most importantly, how to 
secure them.  

02:26:57.357 --> 02:26:59.357
All right.

02:27:03.032 --> 02:27:05.908
And then this is our launch site
, GIT.

02:27:12.322 --> 02:27:14.322
app.

02:27:16.450 --> 02:27:18.493
This is where you would get 
yours if you want one or if 

02:27:18.494 --> 02:27:20.494
you're on the live 

02:27:21.517 --> 02:27:23.376
streamget.app.  This is where 
you would get yours if you want 

02:27:23.377 --> 02:27:24.995
one or if you're on the live 
stream.  And there is a list of 

02:27:24.996 --> 02:27:27.242
sites that are already live on .

02:27:30.294 --> 02:27:32.294
app domains.  

02:27:33.341 --> 02:27:35.790
&gt;&gt; ADRIENNE PORTER FELT: .app 
provides domains that are 

02:27:35.791 --> 02:27:39.047
memorable because they're short 
and there are lots of names 

02:27:39.048 --> 02:27:41.527
available.  And also, they're 
all HTTPS.

02:27:44.590 --> 02:27:46.590
Any site registered under .

02:27:48.822 --> 02:27:51.776
app needs to be HTTPS.  So the 
main reason why I expect 

02:27:52.793 --> 02:27:54.623
developers and marketers and all
of you here in the room to get 

02:27:54.624 --> 02:27:57.466
excited is because you can get 
short, memorable 

02:28:02.333 --> 02:28:04.333
domains that tie in with your 
brands

02:28:05.476 --> 02:28:08.334
.  Since it's a new TLD, it's a 
fresh name space.  There are 

02:28:08.335 --> 02:28:09.573
lots of good names available.  
   &gt;&gt; BEN MCILWAIN: Although 

02:28:09.574 --> 02:28:11.574
maybe not 

02:28:13.334 --> 02:28:15.351
for much longer, because if you 
wait too long.  Just since 

02:28:15.352 --> 02:28:17.352
launch this morning, 

02:28:18.358 --> 02:28:20.013
there's already been over 
100,000 registrations, including

02:28:20.014 --> 02:28:22.014
30,000 in just the first three 
minutes.  

02:28:23.679 --> 02:28:24.899
&gt;&gt; ADRIENNE PORTER FELT: My team
snapped one up this morning.  

02:28:24.900 --> 02:28:28.785
   &gt;&gt; BEN MCILWAIN: My team was 
very hectic this morning.  

02:28:30.210 --> 02:28:31.461
&gt;&gt; ADRIENNE PORTER FELT: So, you
know, previously if you were 

02:28:31.462 --> 02:28:33.462
trying to 

02:28:34.874 --> 02:28:39.440
work in a .com world, you may 
have ended up with a 

02:28:42.526 --> 02:28:44.526
long domain name, but shorter 
ones are 

02:28:45.792 --> 02:28:47.435
more appealing to developers and
also to end users who have to 

02:28:47.436 --> 02:28:49.436
remember how to get back to your
website.  

02:28:51.737 --> 02:28:55.420
But not only are .app names 
memorable, but also unique.  

02:28:55.421 --> 02:28:57.421
This is really important.

02:28:59.344 --> 02:29:01.344
Let's say you're trying to get 
to this call app.

02:29:04.034 --> 02:29:05.675
This is a pretty poplar call 
app, particularly in emerging 

02:29:05.676 --> 02:29:07.676
markets.

02:29:09.987 --> 02:29:12.838
And the thing about the name 
"call app," is if you searched 

02:29:12.839 --> 02:29:14.839
for that name, 

02:29:16.693 --> 02:29:19.361
lots of applications use the 
word "call", so there's 

02:29:19.362 --> 02:29:21.362
ambiguity.

02:29:22.420 --> 02:29:26.274
Domain names are unique there's 
only one call.app.  So domain 

02:29:26.275 --> 02:29:28.948
names are a more reliable way 
for people to be able to find 

02:29:28.949 --> 02:29:30.949
your 

02:29:32.021 --> 02:29:33.644
app, your web app, your mobile 
app, whatever, by name.  

02:29:33.645 --> 02:29:36.293
&gt;&gt; BEN MCILWAIN: All right.  So 
let's look at some real, live 

02:29:38.950 --> 02:29:44.086
examples of websites that are 
already serving on .app.  As we 

02:29:44.087 --> 02:29:46.562
go through these, I'm going to 
pay particular attention to the 

02:29:46.563 --> 02:29:48.563
domain names that they're using 
and think about 

02:29:53.930 --> 02:29:55.930
what alternatives may have 
existed on older TLDs.

02:29:58.020 --> 02:29:59.451
And spoiler alert, the other 
alternatives would not have been

02:29:59.452 --> 02:30:04.795
as good as these are.  
    So first up is cash.app.  

02:30:04.796 --> 02:30:07.071
Obviously a great domain name.  
This is an app by Square, and it

02:30:07.072 --> 02:30:09.072
is 

02:30:11.530 --> 02:30:13.530
for sending and receiving money

02:30:16.698 --> 02:30:18.698
.  For what they are doing, you 
can't 

02:30:19.779 --> 02:30:21.779
imagine a better name.

02:30:22.989 --> 02:30:28.828
Next is ov.app.  They are a 
supporting apparel retailer with

02:30:28.829 --> 02:30:32.502
an augmented reality shopping 
feature in their app.  And then 

02:30:32.503 --> 02:30:34.503
there's Albert.

02:30:38.215 --> 02:30:40.894
app, a financial advice app.  
You get a nice, short domain 

02:30:40.895 --> 02:30:45.429
name that's exactly the actual 
name of your app.  And there's 

02:30:45.430 --> 02:30:49.104
many, many more.  We won't go 
through these individually, but 

02:30:49.105 --> 02:30:51.350
these are all more examples of 
real, live apps that are 

02:30:54.204 --> 02:30:56.204
currently out there and running 
on .

02:30:57.251 --> 02:31:01.137
app domain names, and you can 
find this list on get.app if 

02:31:01.138 --> 02:31:04.004
you're interested.  
    We talked about how the 

02:31:04.005 --> 02:31:06.245
string is interesting, but what 
else is special besides the 

02:31:06.246 --> 02:31:10.558
name? Adrienne mentioned earlier
that security was a big win for 

02:31:10.559 --> 02:31:12.782
.app.  

02:31:15.797 --> 02:31:18.446
&gt;&gt; ADRIENNE PORTER FELT: 
Security is why I'm excited, but

02:31:18.447 --> 02:31:23.527
.app is all HTTPS by default.  
If you register and use, you 

02:31:23.528 --> 02:31:25.528
will need 

02:31:27.648 --> 02:31:29.648
to build an HTTPS website from 
the start.

02:31:30.911 --> 02:31:32.911
This idea first came up on the 
Chrome 

02:31:34.115 --> 02:31:36.115
security team

02:31:39.534 --> 02:31:41.975
.  It turns out a lot as changed
since then.  And you know, we're

02:31:41.976 --> 02:31:45.343
in the future and the future is 
awesome and very friendly to 

02:31:45.344 --> 02:31:47.344
HTTPS.

02:31:48.353 --> 02:31:50.353
Don't just take my word for it.

02:31:51.409 --> 02:31:53.066
To quote buzz feed, moving to 
HTTPS is clearly the way forward

02:31:53.067 --> 02:31:55.936
for the industry overall.  And 
as I mentioned earlier, at the 

02:31:57.980 --> 02:31:59.930
beginning, we are seeing three 
quarters of page loads now over 

02:31:59.931 --> 02:32:04.825
HTTPS.  I think most new sites 
as they're coming online are all

02:32:04.826 --> 02:32:06.826
HTTPS.  

02:32:08.308 --> 02:32:10.799
Now, I'm excited about HTTPS for
many reasons, but I want to tell

02:32:10.800 --> 02:32:15.101
you why you all should be 
excited about HTTPS.  It gives a

02:32:15.102 --> 02:32:17.102
lot of positive benefits to your
website.

02:32:18.969 --> 02:32:21.054
The first is authenticity.  What
this example is showing here on 

02:32:24.973 --> 02:32:27.417
the screen is someone I know 
named Eric Mill browsing on a 

02:32:27.418 --> 02:32:29.662
wireless hot spot, looking at 
the website for the federal 

02:32:29.857 --> 02:32:31.857
trade commission.

02:32:34.370 --> 02:32:36.370
Now normally, the FDC website 
does not 

02:32:37.661 --> 02:32:38.877
have ads all over it, by the 
nature that they are a 

02:32:38.878 --> 02:32:43.817
government website.  But when he
was looking at it, all of this 

02:32:43.818 --> 02:32:47.516
area that is covered in yellow 
was showing advertisements.  

02:32:47.517 --> 02:32:52.834
They really took up a large 
chunk of the view port.  What 

02:32:52.835 --> 02:32:54.891
was happening is the wireless 
hot spot provider was injecting 

02:32:56.932 --> 02:32:58.932
advertisements for one of their 
other 

02:33:03.387 --> 02:33:05.387
businesses on to every HTTP 
service.

02:33:06.449 --> 02:33:08.449
This is a thing that ISP, 
wireless hot 

02:33:10.939 --> 02:33:12.939
spots do in order to monetize 
there's a 

02:33:16.482 --> 02:33:18.482
good amount of HTTP traffic that
has advertisements injected.

02:33:20.748 --> 02:33:23.390
I'm sure a lot of you in the 
room put effort into what your 

02:33:23.391 --> 02:33:27.945
website looks like.  You think 
hard on when and how you should 

02:33:27.946 --> 02:33:29.946
show advertisements and how it 
affects experience.

02:33:32.008 --> 02:33:33.842
I'm sure you don't want someone 
else's ads all over your 

02:33:33.843 --> 02:33:38.340
beautiful website.  If you have 
an HTTPS domain, this kind of 

02:33:38.341 --> 02:33:41.194
thing can't happen.  
    Another thing that HTTPS 

02:33:41.195 --> 02:33:43.486
gives you is access to powerful 
APIs.

02:33:46.749 --> 02:33:49.448
New web features that have come 
out over the past few years are 

02:33:49.449 --> 02:33:52.924
available only to HTTPS 
websites.  This is particularly 

02:33:52.925 --> 02:33:54.925
important for 

02:33:56.773 --> 02:33:59.015
people making PWAs, or 
progressive web apps.  Service 

02:33:59.016 --> 02:34:01.016
workers which are important 

02:34:03.654 --> 02:34:05.654
for building good offline 
experiences, 

02:34:07.318 --> 02:34:09.144
background syncing and sending 
push notifications are 

02:34:09.145 --> 02:34:11.145
important.

02:34:13.030 --> 02:34:15.030
Geonotification, camera and mic 
are HTTPS only.  

02:34:17.348 --> 02:34:19.348
Also, if you have an HTTPS 
website, 

02:34:21.446 --> 02:34:23.446
you'll get a better look in a 
Chrome URL bar.

02:34:24.860 --> 02:34:27.515
In July 2018, which is the 
Chrome 68 release, all HTTP 

02:34:27.516 --> 02:34:31.188
websites will be marked not 
secure.  Right next to the 

02:34:31.189 --> 02:34:34.671
domain name in the URL bar.  So,
you know, we're trying to tell 

02:34:37.727 --> 02:34:39.727
users what you get with HTTP, 
which is 

02:34:40.977 --> 02:34:42.605
an unencrypted insecure 
connection.  If any of you here 

02:34:42.606 --> 02:34:45.280
are running websites that are 
not HTTPS yet, please 

02:34:49.824 --> 02:34:51.824
move them to HTTPS before July. 

02:34:53.975 --> 02:34:55.601
Also, as an added bonus.  
Android security is important, 

02:34:55.602 --> 02:34:57.602
too.

02:35:01.537 --> 02:35:03.362
It requires TLS by default to 
prevent anyone from messing with

02:35:03.363 --> 02:35:05.363
or looking at 

02:35:06.444 --> 02:35:08.287
the traffic between people's 
Android phones and your back 

02:35:08.288 --> 02:35:10.288
ends, so you will need to have 
that set up anyway.  

02:35:16.872 --> 02:35:18.872
We're using a technique called 
HTed 

02:35:21.350 --> 02:35:23.350
HSTS preload

02:35:28.527 --> 02:35:30.527
ing HSTS stands for HTTP strict 

02:35:31.533 --> 02:35:34.878
transport SKURTD security.  I 
tried to say the whole thing 

02:35:37.143 --> 02:35:39.143
earlier, and it takes like five 
minutes.

02:35:40.635 --> 02:35:42.475
So what HSTS does is it's a way 
for your server to tell the 

02:35:42.476 --> 02:35:45.945
browser that your web content 
should be always over HTTPS.

02:35:49.024 --> 02:35:51.024
So you would send a header 
that's 

02:35:53.757 --> 02:35:56.403
named strict transport security,
and once the browser sees that, 

02:35:56.404 --> 02:35:59.048
it will note to only connect 
over HTTPS from then on 

02:36:02.760 --> 02:36:04.794
until the max age runs out 
without seeing an updated max 

02:36:04.795 --> 02:36:09.526
age.  Even if the user doesn't 
specify the scheme and they type

02:36:09.527 --> 02:36:11.527
in the URL bar, or 

02:36:14.226 --> 02:36:16.226
if the user types in HTTP or 
clicks on 

02:36:19.681 --> 02:36:21.596
an HTTP link, they will end up 
on an HTTPS version of your 

02:36:21.597 --> 02:36:23.597
website.

02:36:26.080 --> 02:36:28.080
-HSTS prevents a downgrade 
attack on your website.

02:36:32.454 --> 02:36:34.454
If you have both an HTTP verse 
and 

02:36:35.929 --> 02:36:38.766
HTTPS, it's possible to force 
users back to the HTTP version 

02:36:38.767 --> 02:36:42.625
if you don't haves is like HSTS.
Let me explain with an example.

02:36:46.762 --> 02:36:48.762
Fairly recently, the citizen lab

02:36:50.040 --> 02:36:52.040
claimed that middle boxes on the
telecom 

02:36:54.890 --> 02:36:56.890
network we redistrict

02:36:59.380 --> 02:37:02.834
directing to spy ware.  They 
supported HTTPS, but were not 

02:37:05.472 --> 02:37:08.108
HTTPS only, they were not using 
HSTS.  So the ISP was able to 

02:37:08.109 --> 02:37:10.802
force the connections down to 
HTTP and modify them in transit.

02:37:13.665 --> 02:37:15.665
So using HSTS will prevent that 
from 

02:37:16.686 --> 02:37:18.686
happening

02:37:20.598 --> 02:37:22.598
.  

02:37:23.889 --> 02:37:25.543
Plus you can go one step further
with something called 

02:37:25.544 --> 02:37:27.585
preloading.  There's a long list
of domains that 

02:37:31.354 --> 02:37:33.392
want you to be always HTTPS even
on that very first connection 

02:37:33.393 --> 02:37:36.322
before the browser has had a 
chance to see a header.  If 

02:37:36.323 --> 02:37:38.177
you're on this list, then the 
browser knows that the 

02:37:38.178 --> 02:37:40.635
connection should always be over
HTTPS, even without 

02:37:44.861 --> 02:37:48.260
having seen that header.  
   &gt;&gt; BEN MCILWAIN: All right.  

02:37:48.261 --> 02:37:50.261
In addition to preloading 
individual 

02:37:52.137 --> 02:37:54.137
domain names in the HTTPS list, 
it's 

02:37:55.186 --> 02:37:58.873
also possible to preload an 
entire top-level domain.  That's

02:37:58.874 --> 02:38:01.314
exactly what we did and how we 
implemented this security 

02:38:01.315 --> 02:38:07.033
features of .app.  So this 
screen shot right here is just a

02:38:07.034 --> 02:38:09.915
screen shot from the actual GIT 
repository that's hosting the 

02:38:09.916 --> 02:38:11.916
HSTS 

02:38:13.780 --> 02:38:16.013
preload list, and these TLDs are
on it.  What that means is that 

02:38:16.014 --> 02:38:18.304
any web request through a 
browser to any domain 

02:38:21.914 --> 02:38:23.914
on any of these

02:38:26.098 --> 02:38:28.776
top-level domains will have the 
URL upgraded from HTTP to HTTPS 

02:38:28.777 --> 02:38:30.777
before that network connection 
is ever made.

02:38:36.008 --> 02:38:38.008
So it's always and only ever 
HTTPS to 

02:38:42.523 --> 02:38:44.523
any domain on those TLDs.

02:38:46.210 --> 02:38:48.210
There's a company called FTLD 

02:38:52.085 --> 02:38:59.321
registry, and they run .bank and
.insurance.  You can see why 

02:38:59.322 --> 02:39:03.426
security would be important in 
those industries.  There's more 

02:39:03.427 --> 02:39:05.427
coming soon to this list, 

02:39:07.316 --> 02:39:10.369
and we would encourage registry 
operators to add more.  Out of 

02:39:10.370 --> 02:39:12.406
the eight that are currently on 
there now, .

02:39:16.144 --> 02:39:18.193
app is the first open TLD on the
list.  What that means is it's 

02:39:18.194 --> 02:39:21.448
the first one on the list that 
grants security benefits to 

02:39:21.449 --> 02:39:24.347
everyone here present, because 
you can all and indeed you all 

02:39:26.380 --> 02:39:28.380
do now have a free .app domain 
name.

02:39:30.850 --> 02:39:34.768
It TEES's the first time that 
this benefit is being made 

02:39:34.769 --> 02:39:37.051
available to everyone.  And you 
get it just by registering a 

02:39:37.859 --> 02:39:39.859
domain name.

02:39:41.138 --> 02:39:45.820
Why has this not happened before
now? There's a couple reasons.  

02:39:45.821 --> 02:39:47.821
One is that the requisite 
browser 

02:39:52.396 --> 02:39:55.033
support for handle inging 
top-level pre-loading came in 

02:39:55.034 --> 02:39:57.034
only fairly recently.

02:39:58.087 --> 02:40:00.918
And that really easily HTTPS 
configuration and one-click SSL 

02:40:02.967 --> 02:40:04.967
certificate provisioning came 
out and 

02:40:06.629 --> 02:40:08.629
made it really simple to just 
get that hosting working.

02:40:10.930 --> 02:40:12.568
And a lot of that is thanks to 
lets encrept.  And another 

02:40:12.569 --> 02:40:14.834
reason we're doing this now is 
because privacy and security is 

02:40:16.284 --> 02:40:18.284
on everyone's minds these days.

02:40:20.970 --> 02:40:23.227
It's in the news constantly.  
Enforced HTTPS is something that

02:40:23.228 --> 02:40:27.997
can help mitigate some of these 
issues.  You can't have privacy 

02:40:27.998 --> 02:40:29.998
and security at 

02:40:31.690 --> 02:40:32.908
all if you're doing things over 
an insecure connection or a 

02:40:32.909 --> 02:40:36.208
connection that can be forced to
be insecure.  It's just not even

02:40:36.209 --> 02:40:38.660
possible.  
    There's a huge number of 

02:40:38.661 --> 02:40:42.334
different benefits of preloading
at the TLD level that I'd like 

02:40:42.335 --> 02:40:44.335
to go over.

02:40:46.219 --> 02:40:48.219
So number one

02:40:52.986 --> 02:40:55.823
, it eliminates configuring 
headers.  You will never need to

02:40:55.824 --> 02:40:57.824
go stack 

02:40:59.835 --> 02:41:01.835
overfloeflow or Google and 
figure out 

02:41:02.967 --> 02:41:04.967
how to get HTTPS on Apache.

02:41:08.155 --> 02:41:10.155
It's already done on the entire 
top-level domain.

02:41:12.431 --> 02:41:14.431
And, there's no need to submit 
your 

02:41:16.298 --> 02:41:17.934
domain to the HSTS preload list,
which would otherwise be another

02:41:17.935 --> 02:41:19.970
step you would have to do to get
that security benefit.

02:41:24.277 --> 02:41:26.916
And very importantly, by having 
the entire TLD already on the 

02:41:26.917 --> 02:41:31.005
HSTS preload list, and we did 
this last year, it eliminates 

02:41:31.006 --> 02:41:34.701
the lag time to add domains to 
the preload list.  If you went 

02:41:34.702 --> 02:41:38.756
out right this second and bought
a .com domain name, and you 

02:41:38.757 --> 02:41:40.757
wanted to 

02:41:42.285 --> 02:41:44.958
adhere to the best possible web 
security practices and submitted

02:41:44.959 --> 02:41:50.102
to the HSTS list right now, it 
would take many months for many 

02:41:50.103 --> 02:41:53.359
users to get the advantage of 
the higher level security.  The 

02:41:53.360 --> 02:41:56.626
reason for that is the browser 
release cycle.  Go into the code

02:41:56.627 --> 02:41:58.690
now, hit the nightly, and in a 
month and a half it would hit 

02:42:01.379 --> 02:42:03.379
the beta and then in a month and
a half, 

02:42:05.855 --> 02:42:07.855
hit the GA, and eventually 
people would 

02:42:09.717 --> 02:42:12.188
update their browser and get the
benefit.  But here you get the 

02:42:12.189 --> 02:42:14.189
security instantly.  

02:42:15.241 --> 02:42:17.674
And very importantly, preloading
a TLD increases browser 

02:42:17.675 --> 02:42:19.675
efficiency.

02:42:21.378 --> 02:42:24.045
Because the preload list is 
built into every browser 

02:42:24.046 --> 02:42:26.490
installation, it's in the 
downloaded executable both on 

02:42:26.491 --> 02:42:28.491
desktop 

02:42:29.753 --> 02:42:32.460
and mobile in every 
installation.  So there's over 2

02:42:32.461 --> 02:42:34.461
billion Chrome installations out
there, and there's 

02:42:37.386 --> 02:42:40.053
many billions of installations 
of other browsers and the HSTS 

02:42:40.054 --> 02:42:42.701
preload list is in every one of 
them.  Keeping the list small 

02:42:42.702 --> 02:42:46.625
and efficient is very important,
because it's saving a lot of 

02:42:46.626 --> 02:42:49.286
disk space and memory on all of 
these different computers and 

02:42:49.287 --> 02:42:51.984
mobile devices.  And especially 
important for the 

02:42:55.077 --> 02:42:56.695
mobile devices is a smaller list
is more efficient to check 

02:42:56.696 --> 02:43:01.572
against, because there's fewer 
entries to check when you're 

02:43:01.573 --> 02:43:04.234
making a web request, so it's 
saving CPU cycles too, and 

02:43:04.235 --> 02:43:06.235
that's obviously very important 
on mobile.

02:43:08.786 --> 02:43:09.969
If you use more CPU cycles, 
you're using up more battery.  

02:43:09.970 --> 02:43:14.528
    And preloading makes your 
site faster.  If you're not 

02:43:14.529 --> 02:43:16.982
preloading and you want to have 
security, what you typically do 

02:43:22.729 --> 02:43:24.729
is you will have an HTTP to 
HTTPS redirect.

02:43:27.330 --> 02:43:29.330
So users will type in the 
domain, and 

02:43:30.801 --> 02:43:32.827
by default, an HTTP request will
be main, then a redirect, and 

02:43:32.828 --> 02:43:34.828
another request to the HTTPS 
site.

02:43:40.226 --> 02:43:42.261
By not having the redirect, 
which you can accomplish by 

02:43:42.262 --> 02:43:44.262
preloading, you are 

02:43:45.874 --> 02:43:47.873
saving a round trip to the 
server.  This is significant on 

02:43:47.874 --> 02:43:51.090
mobile devices, especially on 
spotty connections.  You can 

02:43:51.091 --> 02:43:52.917
easily save at least a 
connection by loading the secure

02:43:52.918 --> 02:43:55.186
version of the site first and 
immediately rather 

02:43:58.846 --> 02:44:00.846
than hitting the whole redirect.

02:44:02.318 --> 02:44:04.581
And another benefit, preloading 
makes URLs shorter without 

02:44:04.582 --> 02:44:06.582
losing safety.

02:44:07.645 --> 02:44:09.482
For marketing you want short 
URLs, obviously whether it's 

02:44:09.483 --> 02:44:11.483
print materials 

02:44:12.820 --> 02:44:15.486
or web ads or radio commercials 
or telling your friend the name 

02:44:15.487 --> 02:44:18.330
of a domain name.  You're not 
going to say I found this 

02:44:22.762 --> 02:44:24.762
cool app it's HTTPS

02:44:30.403 --> 02:44:32.403
://name of app blah blah blah 
blah.

02:44:34.885 --> 02:44:37.333
If it's preloaded, the request 
is upgraded to HTTPS without 

02:44:37.334 --> 02:44:40.389
having to include the protocol 
specifier.  This makes marketing

02:44:40.390 --> 02:44:42.390
and security people happy.

02:44:45.518 --> 02:44:48.787
So a really simple example is 
which looks better? Which would 

02:44:48.788 --> 02:44:50.788
you rather see on, let's 

02:44:53.017 --> 02:44:55.017
say maybe a sticker

02:44:59.979 --> 02:45:07.802
? HTTPS://get.app? Or just get.
app? And because it's preloaded,

02:45:07.803 --> 02:45:09.803
it's just 

02:45:11.074 --> 02:45:12.545
as secure as the one on the 
left.  

02:45:12.546 --> 02:45:15.418
&gt;&gt; ADRIENNE PORTER FELT: So 
maybe you guys are already an 

02:45:15.419 --> 02:45:17.863
old hat at setting up HTTPS 
websites, but just in case, we 

02:45:20.296 --> 02:45:22.541
will walk through tips on how to
set up an HTTPS website and 

02:45:22.542 --> 02:45:26.204
tools that are available for you
to use.  Of course, the first 

02:45:26.205 --> 02:45:28.644
thing you need is a certificate.

02:45:32.525 --> 02:45:34.781
Sometimes people have a 
perception that certificates are

02:45:34.782 --> 02:45:38.663
going to be expensive, 
particularly wild cards.  You 

02:45:38.664 --> 02:45:40.664
can get free certificates from 
lets encrypt.

02:45:43.745 --> 02:45:45.772
There are crowd engines that 
will provision a free 

02:45:45.773 --> 02:45:47.773
certificate for you if you're a 
customer.  

02:45:53.344 --> 02:45:55.786
Not only does your top-level 
frame need to be HTTPS, but all 

02:45:55.787 --> 02:45:57.787
of the sub resources within that
frame need to be 

02:46:02.939 --> 02:46:04.966
HTTPS, meaning your scripts, 
images, iFrames.  They all need 

02:46:04.967 --> 02:46:07.878
to be HTTPS as well.  It's 
called a mix content error if 

02:46:07.879 --> 02:46:09.879
you 

02:46:11.944 --> 02:46:13.944
have a mix of HTTP and HTTPS 
resources on a page.

02:46:16.645 --> 02:46:19.482
And this is problematic for your
website.  If you have active 

02:46:19.483 --> 02:46:21.483
resources like a 

02:46:25.845 --> 02:46:28.088
script or an iFrame that are 
HTTP, browsers will block them 

02:46:28.089 --> 02:46:32.378
on an HTTPS connection, and they
will not show up.  If you have 

02:46:32.379 --> 02:46:34.379
passive content like an image, 
it will show up but not ideal.

02:46:38.962 --> 02:46:41.600
You will usually get a downgrade
to tell people that not all of 

02:46:41.601 --> 02:46:45.072
the sub resources have been 
loaded correctly.  So it's 

02:46:45.073 --> 02:46:46.914
really important that you're 
testing for this, looking out 

02:46:46.915 --> 02:46:51.834
for mixed content, that you're 
able to move your sub resources 

02:46:51.835 --> 02:46:54.114
to HTTPS, too.  
    One tool you can use is 

02:46:54.115 --> 02:46:58.451
actually built into Chrome.  
Hopefully all of you in the room

02:46:58.452 --> 02:47:00.452
use Chrome.

02:47:01.525 --> 02:47:03.548
Assuming you do, you can look in
dev tools and open up the 

02:47:03.549 --> 02:47:05.549
security panel.

02:47:09.439 --> 02:47:12.399
This is showing a test website, 
mixed.badssl.com.

02:47:16.054 --> 02:47:17.707
It shows any origins for 
requests so you can get them 

02:47:17.708 --> 02:47:19.708
fixed.  
    Another tool is lighthouse.

02:47:22.419 --> 02:47:25.074
Lighthouse provides audits.  One
of them is a security audit that

02:47:26.300 --> 02:47:28.300
looks for mixed content.

02:47:29.574 --> 02:47:31.574
In this example, which is again 
mix.badssl.

02:47:34.062 --> 02:47:35.687
com, it tells you about all of 
the insecure resources that it 

02:47:35.688 --> 02:47:37.688
found on the page that you can 
fix.

02:47:40.417 --> 02:47:42.234
It also highlights the one that 
you can tell are already 

02:47:42.235 --> 02:47:45.288
available over HTTPS.  So for 
those, you'll just need to go 

02:47:47.936 --> 02:47:49.936
add an extra S into the resource
request and you're golden.

02:47:52.430 --> 02:47:56.748
For others you may need to use a
different sub domain.  Sometimes

02:47:56.749 --> 02:47:58.749
things have a special secure 

02:48:00.243 --> 02:48:02.440
or S sub domain they use for 
HTTPS traffic.  Or if it's a 

02:48:02.441 --> 02:48:05.729
company that you are paying, you
may need to specifically specify

02:48:05.730 --> 02:48:07.730
in your contract that you want 

02:48:10.816 --> 02:48:12.368
to use HTTPS version of their 
sites.  

02:48:12.369 --> 02:48:14.369
&gt;&gt; BEN MCILWAIN: All right.

02:48:17.107 --> 02:48:19.107
So, number three is use HTTPS in
your 

02:48:20.402 --> 02:48:22.450
development environment and 
indeed, all environments.  Don't

02:48:22.451 --> 02:48:27.368
just wait until production.  
There's many reasons for this.  

02:48:27.369 --> 02:48:29.369
One is the powerful web APIs 
that Adrienne was talking about.

02:48:31.819 --> 02:48:35.566
Some of them you can hit 
insecurely over local content.  

02:48:35.567 --> 02:48:40.893
Iftext.  If you want to show 
them over your local network to 

02:48:40.894 --> 02:48:43.547
your colleagues, it will not 
work without an SSL certificate.

02:48:46.822 --> 02:48:48.822
There are third-party web APIs 
that 

02:48:49.993 --> 02:48:51.234
require HTTPS, and you cannot 
test unless you're supporting 

02:48:51.235 --> 02:48:53.906
it.  Another problem is, if you 
are doing a 

02:48:57.788 --> 02:48:59.788
mix of HTTP in development and 
HTTPS 

02:49:02.424 --> 02:49:04.424
later, you have two different

02:49:06.784 --> 02:49:12.111
canonical resources.  You could 
easily get them confused.  

02:49:12.112 --> 02:49:13.933
There's a whole class of 
problems you can cause for 

02:49:13.934 --> 02:49:19.059
yourself that are completely 
unnecessary by not having that 

02:49:19.060 --> 02:49:21.520
one canonical location for all 
resources that only starts with 

02:49:21.521 --> 02:49:23.521
HTTPS.  

02:49:25.788 --> 02:49:27.788
And third, it's maybe sort of 

02:49:29.319 --> 02:49:31.968
tautological, but you need to 
use HTTPS in your dev 

02:49:31.969 --> 02:49:34.423
environment so that you can test
HTTPS.  It doesn't make sense to

02:49:34.424 --> 02:49:38.484
wait until the very last minute 
right before you want to go to 

02:49:38.485 --> 02:49:41.744
production and change everything
and now make it secure, because 

02:49:41.745 --> 02:49:43.745
a lot of things are going to 

02:49:45.064 --> 02:49:47.064
start breaking right then, most 
likely 

02:49:48.330 --> 02:49:50.330
mixed mode content errors.

02:49:52.002 --> 02:49:54.859
If you're going to be running it
securely, you need to be testing

02:49:54.860 --> 02:49:56.941
it securely so problems don't 
creep up on you.  

02:50:01.681 --> 02:50:04.531
And number four, when testing 
use a real domain or sub domain 

02:50:04.532 --> 02:50:08.035
that you own.  Or do not use a 
fake domain or sub domain that 

02:50:08.036 --> 02:50:12.541
you don't own.  It's the same 
thing repeated twice, so it's 

02:50:12.542 --> 02:50:16.021
important so I'm emphasizing it.
The reason is simple.  Why use a

02:50:16.022 --> 02:50:18.072
real domain? If you use a fake 
domain, you are going 

02:50:21.753 --> 02:50:26.069
to have problems.  Not maybe, 
it's almost guaranteed.  The 

02:50:26.070 --> 02:50:28.070
specific problem is a name 

02:50:31.509 --> 02:50:33.644
collision where traffic is 
unexpectedly going somewhere 

02:50:33.645 --> 02:50:35.645
that you didn't want it to go.

02:50:36.742 --> 02:50:38.742
It will work fine on my 
computer, but 

02:50:39.826 --> 02:50:42.733
in any other contacts like let's
say I run a new docker container

02:50:42.734 --> 02:50:46.835
and forgot set up a new DNS, 
it's going to a completely 

02:50:46.836 --> 02:50:49.485
different location or a friend 
runs it and it's going to a new 

02:50:49.700 --> 02:50:51.700
location.

02:50:52.750 --> 02:50:54.984
You're not in charge of your 
destiny if you are using a fake 

02:50:54.985 --> 02:51:00.089
domain name.  This is a huge 
problem if you're interacting 

02:51:00.090 --> 02:51:05.227
with third-party web services.  
    Huge numbers of developers 

02:51:05.228 --> 02:51:10.420
worldwide have had problems when
they used a fake domain or a 

02:51:10.421 --> 02:51:12.653
domain on a fake TLD only for it
to turn out to be real or later 

02:51:15.291 --> 02:51:16.923
become real, which is sort of 
even worse because things break 

02:51:16.924 --> 02:51:21.040
on you later.  When you use a 
fake domain, you're not in 

02:51:21.041 --> 02:51:23.041
control of your own destiny.

02:51:25.111 --> 02:51:26.953
At Google registry, we run 46 
TLDs, and we know how big of a 

02:51:26.954 --> 02:51:31.215
problem this is, because we get 
an unbelievable amount of 

02:51:31.216 --> 02:51:33.238
misaddressed traffic to what are
supposedly fake domain names 

02:51:33.239 --> 02:51:36.315
that are actually real.  And to 
really drive that home, two of 

02:51:40.419 --> 02:51:45.552
the 46 TLDs that we run are .dev
and .prod.  If you are using 

02:51:45.553 --> 02:51:49.622
domain names like that, stop 
immediately, because those are 

02:51:49.623 --> 02:51:51.623
real and we're getting some of 
that traffic.  

02:51:52.733 --> 02:51:54.156
&gt;&gt; ADRIENNE PORTER FELT: I see 
some guilty faces.  

02:51:54.157 --> 02:51:57.445
&gt;&gt; BEN MCILWAIN: Some guilty 
people in the audience here.  

02:51:57.446 --> 02:51:59.446
Here's a simple example of the 
right way to do things.

02:52:01.311 --> 02:52:03.944
So use a real domain name.  And 
then get a wild card certificate

02:52:06.406 --> 02:52:08.406
for all sub domain names.

02:52:10.065 --> 02:52:12.065
You can do that for free with 
lets encrypt.

02:52:13.873 --> 02:52:15.873
And depending on if you want 
local DNS 

02:52:19.332 --> 02:52:21.332
resolution, you can use etsy 
host file.

02:52:22.389 --> 02:52:24.828
Or you can use something like 
DNS mask.  The reason is you 

02:52:24.829 --> 02:52:26.829
obviously don't want 

02:52:27.864 --> 02:52:29.703
to route traffic worldwide to 
your local dev set up when it's 

02:52:29.704 --> 02:52:34.611
not ready.  You only want it to 
resolve locally.  But the key 

02:52:34.612 --> 02:52:37.078
thing is it's still a real 
domain name, so you are in 

02:52:37.079 --> 02:52:40.604
charge of where that traffic 
will go from the world, and you 

02:52:40.605 --> 02:52:44.721
know it's never going anywhere 
unexpectedly, so therefore never

02:52:44.722 --> 02:52:47.664
in name collisions.  
    And the final tool for doing

02:52:47.665 --> 02:52:49.665
secure 

02:52:50.731 --> 02:52:52.731
hosting is just use a service 
with automatic HTTPS.

02:52:54.748 --> 02:52:56.748
And there's so many of them 
these days.

02:52:59.036 --> 02:53:01.036
Some examples, Google AppEngine,

02:53:02.052 --> 02:53:04.052
Firebase

02:53:05.147 --> 02:53:07.147
, GitHub pages and many, many 
more.

02:53:10.717 --> 02:53:12.917
This is a system simple way to 
get a secure site running.

02:53:15.975 --> 02:53:17.975
Many times it's as simple as 
hitting a check box.

02:53:20.653 --> 02:53:22.653
Sometimes it's even simpler, 
because 

02:53:24.115 --> 02:53:26.115
the check box is checked by 
default.

02:53:27.794 --> 02:53:29.794
You combine a hosting service 
that 

02:53:31.044 --> 02:53:33.044
gives you automated security 
with a .

02:53:34.705 --> 02:53:36.588
app domain, and when you have 
those two combined, you have the

02:53:36.589 --> 02:53:38.589
best in class, 

02:53:40.283 --> 02:53:42.283
best possible best practices 
security.  

02:53:45.577 --> 02:53:48.212
&gt;&gt; ADRIENNE PORTER FELT: Some 
some of you may be moving 

02:53:48.213 --> 02:53:53.512
existing websites over to .app. 
Keep in mind that assuming you 

02:53:53.513 --> 02:53:57.400
want to maintain your search 
ranking, help out the Google 

02:53:57.401 --> 02:54:02.128
BOT.  It needs to know that 
you're moving your domain so you

02:54:02.129 --> 02:54:07.020
maintain your ranking from one 
domain through to the other.  

02:54:07.021 --> 02:54:09.456
There's an excellent search 
console help article that walks 

02:54:09.457 --> 02:54:12.299
you through the best practices. 
There's an FAQ that covers what 

02:54:12.300 --> 02:54:16.381
you need to do to prepare for a 
site move.  I strongly encourage

02:54:16.382 --> 02:54:18.487
you take a look at that if you 
ever move a website.  

02:54:23.467 --> 02:54:25.297
I'm going to pause because I see
a whole bunch of people taking 

02:54:25.298 --> 02:54:27.389
pictures of the slide.  All 
right.

02:54:31.071 --> 02:54:33.071
The help center has other tips 
on 

02:54:34.343 --> 02:54:36.173
practices for making your HTTPS 
setting set up be ranking 

02:54:36.174 --> 02:54:38.174
friendly.

02:54:40.999 --> 02:54:43.081
I encourage you to check this 
out, too.  

02:54:45.120 --> 02:54:47.563
&gt;&gt; BEN MCILWAIN: So one last 
final reminder, the launch site 

02:54:47.564 --> 02:54:52.021
is get.app.  All the relevant 
information is there, or look at

02:54:52.022 --> 02:54:55.293
the sticker on the back of your 
laptop, hopefully.  And everyone

02:54:55.294 --> 02:54:58.545
here in attendance, go and get 
your free domain.  Follow the 

02:54:58.546 --> 02:55:00.776
instructions in the e-mail.  For
anyone that's not here or on the

02:55:03.014 --> 02:55:06.107
live stream or people here who 
want more than one .app, 

02:55:06.108 --> 02:55:08.147
hopefully the same.  And the 
last note, and this is very 

02:55:11.828 --> 02:55:13.247
important is you should go out 
there and use these domain 

02:55:13.248 --> 02:55:17.110
names.  Don't just register them
and park them.  The security 

02:55:17.111 --> 02:55:19.111
comes from using them.  Security
is getting more and more 

02:55:22.229 --> 02:55:24.673
people on HTTPS on the web and 
getting more of them on the best

02:55:24.674 --> 02:55:26.674
possible 

02:55:27.745 --> 02:55:29.746
practices domains that are HSTS 
preloaded.  Do it on .

02:55:32.804 --> 02:55:34.842
app because security is easier 
on .app than anywhere else.  All

02:55:34.843 --> 02:55:36.843
right.  
    So thank you very much.

02:55:40.973 --> 02:55:42.973
Here is some social information 
and links to check out.

02:55:45.800 --> 02:55:47.800
The last one

02:55:49.109 --> 02:55:51.109
is nomulus.

02:55:52.195 --> 02:55:54.195
foo.

02:55:56.710 --> 02:55:58.939
It is what we use to run all 46 
of our top-level domains, 

02:55:58.940 --> 02:56:00.940
including .app.

02:56:03.855 --> 02:56:05.855
If you had any curiosity of how 

02:56:06.921 --> 02:56:08.921
top-level domains are run, you 
can go to nomulus.

02:56:13.344 --> 02:56:16.190
foo, and it goes to our GitHub 
to see our source code.  We are 

02:56:16.191 --> 02:56:19.034
running out of time, but we will
be in the web biodome G over 

02:56:19.035 --> 02:56:21.272
there, so come talk to us 
afterwards.  

02:56:22.090 --> 02:56:24.090
&gt;&gt; ADRIENNE PORTER FELT: Thanks,
everyone.  

02:56:24.529 --> 02:56:27.927
&gt;&gt; BEN MCILWAIN: Thank you.  
[ Applause ]

good afternoon, everyoneGood 
afternoon, everyone.  

03:17:54.943 --> 03:17:56.943
&gt;&gt; I'm responsible for improving
our 

03:17:57.996 --> 03:17:59.996
understanding of Android apps, 
their 

03:18:04.166 --> 03:18:06.166
capabilities, content and 
attributes.  

03:18:06.213 --> 03:18:08.213
&gt;&gt; ILYA FIRMAN: Hi, everyone.

03:18:09.300 --> 03:18:11.300
I'm a software engineer on the 
actions on Google team.

03:18:14.395 --> 03:18:15.808
Actions on Google offers APIs 
for developers to integrate with

03:18:15.809 --> 03:18:17.809
the Google assistant and other 
Google products.

03:18:21.556 --> 03:18:23.556
My focus is on connecting 
Android apps 

03:18:26.672 --> 03:18:28.503
into the actions on Google 
system.  

03:18:28.504 --> 03:18:30.504
&gt;&gt; LUV KOTHARI: As Dave 
mentioned in 

03:18:32.171 --> 03:18:34.171
the keynote this morning, app 
actions 

03:18:35.224 --> 03:18:37.255
will allow users to discover and
re-engage with the capabilities 

03:18:37.256 --> 03:18:39.256
and 

03:18:42.157 --> 03:18:44.428
content of apps at just the 
right moment.  You will get an 

03:18:44.429 --> 03:18:46.709
opportunity to increase reach 
and engagement for your 

03:18:52.000 --> 03:18:54.442
apps across multiple Google and 
Android surfaces.  Let's look at

03:18:54.443 --> 03:18:56.443
a couple of examples for this.

03:18:59.987 --> 03:19:02.012
With app actions, users will be 
able to get things done quickly 

03:19:02.013 --> 03:19:05.913
and seamlessly.  Imagine you're 
planning a Friday night out with

03:19:05.914 --> 03:19:11.234
your friends.  Wouldn't it be 
great if you had a personal 

03:19:11.235 --> 03:19:13.235
assistant which would help you 

03:19:14.308 --> 03:19:16.308
accomplish tasks such as making 
a dinner 

03:19:18.230 --> 03:19:21.068
reservation, getting movie 
tickets, getting a ride to the 

03:19:21.069 --> 03:19:24.794
venue, and building a collage 
from the pictures taken during 

03:19:24.795 --> 03:19:26.795
the evening.  

03:19:29.838 --> 03:19:31.838
Google assist TANLT was

03:19:33.568 --> 03:19:36.845
ant was created to help users 
with these many tasks.  And for 

03:19:36.846 --> 03:19:38.846
these tasks, the user may have 

03:19:40.289 --> 03:19:42.289
the perfect Android app on their
devices.

03:19:45.836 --> 03:19:46.812
With app actions, your Android 
app can integrate with the 

03:19:46.813 --> 03:19:48.813
Google assistant and 

03:19:49.856 --> 03:19:52.705
participate in these user 
journeys.  MOFR, the app 

03:19:52.706 --> 03:19:55.400
suggestions will appear on 
Google and Android surfaces to 

03:19:55.401 --> 03:19:59.704
help users get things done and 
discover what their apps can do.

03:19:59.705 --> 03:20:05.215
    With app actions, user will 
be able to go from the content 

03:20:05.216 --> 03:20:07.216
they love to the 

03:20:09.284 --> 03:20:11.503
actions that can take on that 
content to the relevant apps to 

03:20:11.504 --> 03:20:13.504
fulfill those actions.

03:20:18.475 --> 03:20:20.475
Imagine a lady Gaga fan is 
searching for her latest hits.

03:20:23.357 --> 03:20:25.617
Wouldn't it be great if that 
user, while looking for that 

03:20:25.618 --> 03:20:30.297
information could also discover 
where to listen to her songs, 

03:20:30.298 --> 03:20:33.145
watch her videos, buy tickets to
her upcoming concerts or find 

03:20:33.146 --> 03:20:38.869
updates about her? This is the 
ideal moment for the use tore 

03:20:38.870 --> 03:20:44.154
discover capabilities of the 
Android apps they already have. 

03:20:44.155 --> 03:20:46.003
App actions can help users 
re-engage with the apps they 

03:20:46.004 --> 03:20:48.306
forgot they had, and also 
discover new opportunities and 

03:20:49.978 --> 03:20:51.978
capabilities they did not know 
existed.  

03:20:54.739 --> 03:20:57.411
We are bringing similar 
experiences to diverse content 

03:20:57.412 --> 03:20:59.412
such as TV shows, 

03:21:00.715 --> 03:21:02.715
movies, books, courses, sports, 
games, 

03:21:04.145 --> 03:21:06.145
books, and more

03:21:09.160 --> 03:21:11.615
.  As an Android developer, you 
know that re-engagement is a 

03:21:11.616 --> 03:21:14.479
challenging problem.  Users have
hundreds of apps on their 

03:21:15.728 --> 03:21:17.728
devices to choose from.

03:21:19.212 --> 03:21:21.445
Android authority did a survey a
couple of years ago and found 

03:21:21.446 --> 03:21:23.446
that 77% 

03:21:24.508 --> 03:21:26.125
of Android users do not use an 
app after three days of 

03:21:26.126 --> 03:21:28.126
installing it.

03:21:30.206 --> 03:21:33.473
And that number goes up to 90% 
after a month.  You all have 

03:21:33.474 --> 03:21:35.474
worked really hard for 

03:21:36.931 --> 03:21:39.232
those app installs, but getting 
users to keep coming back to 

03:21:39.233 --> 03:21:43.277
your app is a harder problem.  
Notifications and e-mails are 

03:21:43.278 --> 03:21:47.345
all tools in your tool kit, but 
it's also possible that it can 

03:21:47.346 --> 03:21:49.994
come across as spammy and 
annoying.

03:21:55.317 --> 03:21:57.946
It's much bet toreter to 
re-engage with the user in the 

03:21:57.947 --> 03:21:59.947
right context and in the right 
moment.  

03:22:01.629 --> 03:22:03.061
So today we're going beyond 
simply predicting the next app 

03:22:03.062 --> 03:22:05.062
the user would 

03:22:06.147 --> 03:22:08.147
want to open to the next action 
the user would want to take.

03:22:10.658 --> 03:22:13.309
In an AI-first world, we want to
assist users to find 

03:22:13.310 --> 03:22:15.310
capabilities and 

03:22:17.324 --> 03:22:19.324
content from your apps even if 
that 

03:22:20.378 --> 03:22:24.850
information is buried deep 
inside the app.  So how will we 

03:22:24.851 --> 03:22:26.899
make this happen? 
    First, we are building a 

03:22:26.900 --> 03:22:28.900
rich 

03:22:29.948 --> 03:22:32.007
catalog of actions -- or intents
as we call them.

03:22:36.500 --> 03:22:38.500
Essentially, think of them of 
verb plus noun.

03:22:41.181 --> 03:22:43.181
Some examples, play music, play 
game, 

03:22:44.436 --> 03:22:47.102
take course, order ride, order 
food.  These are all intents in 

03:22:47.103 --> 03:22:49.103
our catalog.

03:22:50.408 --> 03:22:53.120
For these intents, we will build
deep semantic understanding.  

03:22:53.121 --> 03:22:55.595
What do I mean by that? We will 
define detailed schemas with 

03:22:58.254 --> 03:23:01.106
parameter specs and define 
grammar, not only in English but

03:23:01.107 --> 03:23:03.107
many other languages.  Let's 
take a concrete exam. 

03:23:07.418 --> 03:23:09.830
Of checking air quality in Los 
Angeles.

03:23:12.870 --> 03:23:14.870
There are multiple ways to check
pollution.

03:23:17.987 --> 03:23:20.425
Look at these here.  There are 
many other possible ways the 

03:23:22.062 --> 03:23:24.551
user can make that query.  
Google will parse all of these 

03:23:24.552 --> 03:23:26.552
queries 

03:23:28.837 --> 03:23:30.837
and map them into one common 
intent 

03:23:31.842 --> 03:23:33.842
called

03:23:36.039 --> 03:23:38.903
check_air_quality, and pass on 
the right parameters so they 

03:23:38.904 --> 03:23:40.904
will all get passed along to the
Android app, which 

03:23:44.699 --> 03:23:47.149
will take the user to the right 
place inside the app and get the

03:23:47.150 --> 03:23:49.150
correct action.  

03:23:51.657 --> 03:23:53.657
We also define grammars in 
popular 

03:23:55.743 --> 03:23:58.219
languages and provide natural 
language understanding.  You get

03:23:58.220 --> 03:24:00.675
instant global reach without 
having to do the hard work of 

03:24:02.295 --> 03:24:05.152
understanding languages.  We 
already support 16 languages and

03:24:07.994 --> 03:24:09.838
will continue to expand that 
coverage.  

03:24:09.839 --> 03:24:11.839
How do you participate?

03:24:13.951 --> 03:24:16.447
As an Android developer, you 
need to add an actions.

03:24:21.297 --> 03:24:23.297
xml file

03:24:26.881 --> 03:24:28.881
into your APK

03:24:31.058 --> 03:24:33.058
.  Once you have exposed the 

03:24:34.550 --> 03:24:36.788
capabilities and content of your
apps, Google will map user 

03:24:36.789 --> 03:24:38.789
queries and context 

03:24:42.294 --> 03:24:45.201
to your app and service you 
highly utilized products within 

03:24:45.202 --> 03:24:47.202
Android in the 

03:24:48.907 --> 03:24:51.183
launcher and selection, the GOOL
Play store, the Google 

03:24:51.184 --> 03:24:53.814
assistant, and the search app.  
Actions are not restricted to 

03:24:53.815 --> 03:24:56.691
Android P, and are available on 
all devices with 

03:25:02.799 --> 03:25:05.535
the most recent versions of 
these appsoogle play store, the 

03:25:05.536 --> 03:25:09.802
Google assistant, and the search
app.  Actions are not restricted

03:25:05.536 --> 03:25:09.602
to Android P, and are available 
on all devices with the most 

03:25:05.536 --> 03:25:07.536
recent versions of these apps.  

03:25:08.843 --> 03:25:10.665
Let's walk through a few 
examples, and I'm very excited 

03:25:10.666 --> 03:25:12.666
to be walking you through these.

03:25:16.399 --> 03:25:18.399
This is my screen on my phone, 
an all app screen.

03:25:20.492 --> 03:25:23.483
Last year we introduced the 
concept of predicted

03:25:26.598 --> 03:25:31.901
apps.  It has been working 
really great.  As Dave mentioned

03:25:31.902 --> 03:25:35.752
this morning, we have about 60% 
prediction rate on this.  It's 

03:25:35.753 --> 03:25:37.793
phenomenal.  This year, we want 
to go further.

03:25:41.261 --> 03:25:43.719
You want to go from predicting 
the next app to predicting the 

03:25:43.720 --> 03:25:47.218
next action a user would want to
take.  If you take a closer 

03:25:47.219 --> 03:25:49.219
look, I see two action 
suggestions.

03:25:52.255 --> 03:25:54.255
And right around this time of 
the day

03:25:57.994 --> 03:26:00.061
, commuting back home, I'm 
relying on Google maps to 

03:26:00.062 --> 03:26:02.062
navigate me around traffic.

03:26:03.737 --> 03:26:05.630
I'm also talking to my wife, 
Tina, catching up on her day, 

03:26:05.631 --> 03:26:07.631
mostly 

03:26:08.692 --> 03:26:10.692
strategizing how to survive with
two 

03:26:12.298 --> 03:26:14.298
kids at home

03:26:15.299 --> 03:26:17.299
.  Both of these actions take me
deep inside the app.

03:26:19.208 --> 03:26:21.208
The actions are predicted based 
on my 

03:26:23.277 --> 03:26:24.900
usage patterns, my routines, my 
app sequences and the context 

03:26:24.901 --> 03:26:27.373
I'm in, whether I'm in my car, 
whether I have my 

03:26:31.283 --> 03:26:33.283
headset on, what is it I'm 
doing.

03:26:36.599 --> 03:26:38.599
If I rarely plug in my headset 
with my 

03:26:39.638 --> 03:26:42.513
phone, I get an action to resume
a play list I was listening to 

03:26:42.514 --> 03:26:45.603
in my favorite music app.  
    Actions are also integrated 

03:26:45.604 --> 03:26:50.919
in smart text selection in 
Android.  Let's say I get a 

03:26:50.920 --> 03:26:52.920
recommendation to a 

03:26:58.733 --> 03:27:00.733
new restaurant in a city called 

03:27:01.760 --> 03:27:03.760
flour+water

03:27:05.307 --> 03:27:07.307
.  It will try to map what 
possible 

03:27:10.872 --> 03:27:13.291
actions, and then further, what 
possible apps would be needed 

03:27:13.292 --> 03:27:15.292
for the given entity.

03:27:23.392 --> 03:27:27.501
As I select flour +Water, I get 
a suggestion to use Open Table. 

03:27:27.502 --> 03:27:29.343
I can click on that where it 
will take me directly to the 

03:27:29.344 --> 03:27:32.041
open table app where I can see 
information, read reviews, and 

03:27:33.705 --> 03:27:36.164
make the dinner reservation.  
All of this is using an on 

03:27:36.165 --> 03:27:39.241
device machine learning model.  
Any of the text that I'm 

03:27:39.242 --> 03:27:41.242
selecting on 

03:27:43.148 --> 03:27:44.806
the screen never leaves my 
device.  Everything is secure 

03:27:44.807 --> 03:27:46.807
and fast.  

03:27:49.921 --> 03:27:52.604
Smart text selection will be 
able to recognize many entities 

03:27:52.605 --> 03:27:54.605
such as TV 

03:27:56.061 --> 03:27:58.061
shows, movies, athletes, 
musicians, 

03:28:00.575 --> 03:28:02.575
flight numbers, and more.

03:28:05.682 --> 03:28:07.762
Actions would also surface on 
play store.  We all know there 

03:28:07.763 --> 03:28:09.763
is an app for everything.

03:28:12.259 --> 03:28:14.306
And the Play Store is the place 
where users go looking for those

03:28:14.307 --> 03:28:16.307
apps and those capabilities.

03:28:19.836 --> 03:28:22.522
So let's say I search for 
ladyLady Gaga, I will get 

03:28:22.523 --> 03:28:25.592
suggestions to go inside any of 
these apps to perform these 

03:28:25.593 --> 03:28:30.347
actions.  What's interesting is 
not only do I get action 

03:28:30.348 --> 03:28:32.602
suggestions for apps I have 
installed, but also the apps I 

03:28:32.603 --> 03:28:34.603
have not installed.

03:28:36.097 --> 03:28:39.345
This is the universe of apps 
that exist out there.  If I tap 

03:28:39.346 --> 03:28:42.178
on something that is not 
installed, I will go to the 

03:28:42.179 --> 03:28:46.248
details page of that app, 
install the app, and then I tap 

03:28:46.249 --> 03:28:48.562
open, and it will take me 
directly into the right place 

03:28:48.563 --> 03:28:50.563
inside the app to fulfill that 
action.  

03:28:53.515 --> 03:28:56.159
With app actions, users can 
discover new ways to re-engage 

03:28:56.160 --> 03:28:58.649
with the content they already 
love.

03:29:01.694 --> 03:29:03.694
Actions will also work in 
assistant.

03:29:07.054 --> 03:29:12.460
Let's say I ask Assistant to 
show me my budget on mint.  I 

03:29:12.461 --> 03:29:14.461
will pass it to show_budget 
action inside the Android app.

03:29:18.724 --> 03:29:20.724
The right placed in the

03:29:24.128 --> 03:29:26.228
app will get invoked and I'm 
able to fulfill that action.  

03:29:31.750 --> 03:29:33.750
Here I am asking assistant what 
is 

03:29:35.855 --> 03:29:36.681
lady Gaga's real name, but 
assistant anticipates that I 

03:29:36.682 --> 03:29:38.682
might be interested 

03:29:39.799 --> 03:29:41.799
in knowing more about lady Gaga 
and similar actions.

03:29:44.550 --> 03:29:46.604
I get offered more knowledge 
chips to listen to her music and

03:29:46.605 --> 03:29:48.605
buy tickets to her concert.

03:29:50.933 --> 03:29:51.959
It's a great way for users to 
discover capabilities about the 

03:29:51.960 --> 03:29:55.820
apps they already have, and they
are able to do so in the right 

03:29:55.821 --> 03:29:58.054
moment.  Again, tapping on any 
of these chips 

03:30:01.544 --> 03:30:03.811
will take me directly into your 
Android apps and will let me 

03:30:03.812 --> 03:30:05.812
fulfill the action 

03:30:07.117 --> 03:30:09.117
I was intending to do.  

03:30:12.241 --> 03:30:14.241
Finally, as Dave mentioned 
thised 

03:30:16.502 --> 03:30:19.427
mentioned this morning in the 
keynote, as an example, if you 

03:30:19.428 --> 03:30:21.428
search for the 

03:30:25.172 --> 03:30:27.172
latest avengers movie, "Infinity
War," 

03:30:30.427 --> 03:30:32.427
you will get an action to

03:30:35.364 --> 03:30:37.364
Fandango app to buy tickets if 
you have Fandango installed.

03:30:40.883 --> 03:30:41.888
App actions are built as part of
a broader actions in Google 

03:30:41.889 --> 03:30:43.889
developer platform.

03:30:47.224 --> 03:30:48.445
This platform provides common 
development tools and processes 

03:30:48.446 --> 03:30:50.446
and a 

03:30:53.875 --> 03:30:55.875
set of foundational building 
blocks

03:31:02.991 --> 03:31:05.849
.  
    You can provide Google 

03:31:05.850 --> 03:31:07.850
inventory for your actions.

03:31:10.561 --> 03:31:12.821
You can report action usage by 
app indexing and get 

03:31:12.822 --> 03:31:15.643
personalized suggestions based 
on usage patterns.

03:31:19.631 --> 03:31:21.631
Identity in seamless digital 

03:31:22.915 --> 03:31:24.915
suggestions allow hassle free 

03:31:26.875 --> 03:31:28.875
foundations across multiple 
modalities.

03:31:30.174 --> 03:31:32.174
The two modalities available, 
Android 

03:31:33.826 --> 03:31:35.820
app actions is what we have been
talking about here.  There is 

03:31:35.821 --> 03:31:37.826
another one, which is 
conversation actions, and you 

03:31:37.827 --> 03:31:40.886
have heard quite a bit about it 
in consumer and developer 

03:31:40.887 --> 03:31:44.349
keynote.  These are ones for you
to build voice-powered 

03:31:44.350 --> 03:31:46.631
experiences.  You can also 
design a vertical program 

03:31:51.705 --> 03:31:53.705
and deeply integrate with

03:32:07.812 --> 03:32:09.812
Google.  

03:32:13.091 --> 03:32:15.091
You also tell us how to fulfill 

03:32:17.134 --> 03:32:19.134
intents with deep links

03:32:22.697 --> 03:32:24.734
.  Ilya, can you walk us through
some of this and show us how 

03:32:24.735 --> 03:32:26.735
it's working? 

03:32:28.986 --> 03:32:30.986
&gt;&gt; ILYA FIRMAN: Thank you so 
much

03:32:33.596 --> 03:32:35.828
.  I hope you guys are as 
excited as we are about the 

03:32:35.829 --> 03:32:38.699
opportunities offered by app 
actions.  You must wonder how do

03:32:38.700 --> 03:32:42.610
I sign up.  Let me walk you step
by step through the actions of 

03:32:42.611 --> 03:32:44.611
setting up your app.

03:32:46.318 --> 03:32:48.731
At the core of app actions is 
actions.xml, a new configuration

03:32:48.732 --> 03:32:50.794
file that you can include in 
your Android APK.

03:32:54.116 --> 03:32:56.575
It enables you to register for 
intents and define fulfillment 

03:32:56.576 --> 03:32:58.576
for those intents.

03:33:00.454 --> 03:33:02.454
When we talk about intents, we 
are 

03:33:03.955 --> 03:33:06.444
talking semantic intents.  These
intents describe what your 

03:33:08.109 --> 03:33:11.106
action does in the language that
Google can understand

03:33:17.300 --> 03:33:18.519
.  Intents can be built in or 
custom intents defined by the 

03:33:18.520 --> 03:33:21.178
developer.  And while intents 
describe what an 

03:33:24.459 --> 03:33:25.704
action does, fulfillment 
describes how your app does that

03:33:25.705 --> 03:33:27.705
action.

03:33:29.205 --> 03:33:31.665
For Android apps, fulfillment 
connects the semantic intent to 

03:33:31.666 --> 03:33:33.666
the Android intent in the app.  

03:33:35.360 --> 03:33:37.360
Together, intents and 
fulfillment 

03:33:39.943 --> 03:33:42.372
define actions, and actions.xml 
is how you provide actions in 

03:33:42.373 --> 03:33:44.373
your Android app.

03:33:47.343 --> 03:33:49.806
Once you define intents and 
fulfillment, you can integrate 

03:33:49.807 --> 03:33:51.807
usage 

03:33:53.562 --> 03:33:56.212
logging into your app using APIs
from Firebase app indexing.

03:33:59.463 --> 03:34:01.463
You can enhance the way actions 
are 

03:34:03.908 --> 03:34:06.513
presented to the user using 
slices, a new UI framework.

03:34:09.998 --> 03:34:12.853
This is a quick, high-level 
overview.  Let us walk through 

03:34:12.854 --> 03:34:15.114
each step in detail, starting 
with intents.  

03:34:21.017 --> 03:34:23.093
As Luv mentioned earlier, app 
actions is built on a new 

03:34:23.094 --> 03:34:25.094
catalog of 

03:34:26.192 --> 03:34:28.848
semantic intents published by 
Google as part of the actions by

03:34:28.849 --> 03:34:30.849
Google catalog.

03:34:33.125 --> 03:34:35.368
We define a grammar that helps 
us recognize queries, and 

03:34:35.369 --> 03:34:40.277
parameters we can infer from the
query and pass to your app.  The

03:34:40.278 --> 03:34:41.703
catalog helps us organize the 
world of actions so we can show 

03:34:41.704 --> 03:34:43.960
the right actions to the right 
user at the right time.

03:34:47.281 --> 03:34:48.921
We expect that most will 
register for one of our built-in

03:34:48.922 --> 03:34:54.467
intents.  With that, you give 
Google a deep understanding of 

03:34:54.468 --> 03:34:56.468
what your app does.

03:34:57.560 --> 03:34:59.560
Moreover, with built-in intents 
you do 

03:35:01.634 --> 03:35:03.634
not need to worry about natural 
language understanding.

03:35:07.731 --> 03:35:11.213
You may want to ask to book a 
taxi or order a cab.  With 

03:35:11.214 --> 03:35:12.853
built-in intents, you don't need
to worry about the different 

03:35:12.854 --> 03:35:14.854
ways in 

03:35:16.180 --> 03:35:18.854
which a user can express the 
same intent.  Google takes care 

03:35:18.855 --> 03:35:21.711
of natural language 
understanding.  Your app just 

03:35:21.712 --> 03:35:24.962
needs to provide fulfillment.  
Built-in intents give you 

03:35:24.963 --> 03:35:26.963
support for many languages right
out of the box, and 

03:35:30.738 --> 03:35:32.985
they provide a one-stop shop for
giving access to multiple UI 

03:35:32.986 --> 03:35:37.068
surfaces.  Google will be adding
more and more intents to the 

03:35:37.069 --> 03:35:39.069
catalog over time.  If your 
particular use case is not 

03:35:40.739 --> 03:35:43.180
covered, chances are it will be 
soon.  And you will have a way 

03:35:43.181 --> 03:35:46.689
to request new intents to be 
defined.  If your use case is 

03:35:46.690 --> 03:35:48.956
truly unique, you can define a 
custom intent and build 

03:35:52.656 --> 03:35:55.547
your own grammar, the equivalent
of play console or actions on 

03:35:55.548 --> 03:35:58.237
Google developers.  
    It is important to 

03:35:58.238 --> 03:36:03.366
distinguish with semantic 
intents that they are defined on

03:36:03.367 --> 03:36:05.385
actions on Google and Android 
intents, a feature in the 

03:36:05.386 --> 03:36:10.096
Android framework.  As Android 
developers, you are familiar 

03:36:10.097 --> 03:36:12.133
with Android intents.  They 
describe specific operations in 

03:36:12.134 --> 03:36:17.710
a way that allows Android apps 
to talk to each other.  Semantic

03:36:17.711 --> 03:36:20.542
intents are part of our larger 
catalog that extends beyond 

03:36:24.003 --> 03:36:25.033
Android that looks at 
assistance, search, and other 

03:36:25.034 --> 03:36:27.034
surfaces.

03:36:28.272 --> 03:36:30.272
For Android apps, actions.

03:36:32.234 --> 03:36:34.234
xml is what dedefines the 
mapping.

03:36:36.368 --> 03:36:39.214
Of course, you can built 
multiple ways to build the same 

03:36:39.215 --> 03:36:43.316
semantic intent across multiple 
types of devices.  Let's say 

03:36:43.317 --> 03:36:45.317
you're a bank and you want 

03:36:48.677 --> 03:36:51.533
to support the check_account 
intent.  You could build a 

03:36:51.534 --> 03:36:54.014
conversational action so you 
could support a voice-only 

03:36:56.710 --> 03:36:58.333
experience on Google Home or 
smart displays, using the tools 

03:36:58.334 --> 03:37:00.554
you have seen earlier.  
    And if you would like to 

03:37:00.555 --> 03:37:03.417
learn more about how to 
transition from building 

03:37:06.710 --> 03:37:08.710
for your Android app to 
conversational 

03:37:10.833 --> 03:37:12.466
experiences, you can come to a 
session dedicated to that on 

03:37:12.467 --> 03:37:14.467
Thursday morning.

03:37:16.501 --> 03:37:18.501
Today

03:37:20.086 --> 03:37:22.583
Now, if you're an Android 
developer, you're probably 

03:37:22.584 --> 03:37:25.242
familiar with intent filters, 
and they expose intents outside 

03:37:26.056 --> 03:37:28.056
of the app.

03:37:29.726 --> 03:37:31.726
Intent builders define content 
types 

03:37:35.065 --> 03:37:37.065
and data URIs, and those can 
come in the 

03:37:38.066 --> 03:37:40.066
form

03:37:41.289 --> 03:37:43.289
of HTTP URLs.

03:37:45.390 --> 03:37:47.390
It defines how a semantic intent
can 

03:37:49.408 --> 03:37:51.408
be converted into a

03:37:54.577 --> 03:37:56.577
URL to open into your app

03:38:01.572 --> 03:38:03.617
.  Now, why do we use URLs to 
connect semantic and Android 

03:38:03.618 --> 03:38:05.618
intents?

03:38:07.512 --> 03:38:09.512
Deep link URLs are part of a 
larger app discovery eco-system.

03:38:11.804 --> 03:38:13.804
You can link your app URLs to 
your web 

03:38:14.867 --> 03:38:16.867
content using verified app links
or site maps.

03:38:18.767 --> 03:38:20.823
With Google's structured data 
programs, you can precisely 

03:38:20.824 --> 03:38:25.767
define the specific content that
your app can support.  And with 

03:38:25.768 --> 03:38:27.768
Firebase app indexing, you 

03:38:30.469 --> 03:38:32.299
can enable Google to enable 
actionable suggestions to 

03:38:32.300 --> 03:38:35.160
identify what users do when they
use your app.  All of the 

03:38:35.161 --> 03:38:37.161
different features and 

03:38:39.048 --> 03:38:41.048
programs use URLs to identify 
content in your app.  

03:38:41.715 --> 03:38:43.762
So we've talked about intents.  
Let's switch gears and talk 

03:38:43.763 --> 03:38:45.763
about fulfillment.

03:38:47.905 --> 03:38:50.150
Fulfillment describes a specific
mechanism to invoke a particular

03:38:50.151 --> 03:38:52.813
action in your app.  It tells 
Google how to determine the 

03:38:55.886 --> 03:39:01.237
specific deep-link URL to open 
for a specific given intent.  

03:39:01.238 --> 03:39:03.238
You can use one of two models to

03:39:04.917 --> 03:39:06.917
provide fulfillment for semantic
intent.

03:39:09.444 --> 03:39:11.444
We use the parameters of the 
semantic 

03:39:12.689 --> 03:39:14.689
intent to dynamically conduct at
run 

03:39:15.694 --> 03:39:18.626
time.  At run time, we take the 
parameters 

03:39:22.327 --> 03:39:24.327
from the user intent and pass 
them into your URL.

03:39:25.616 --> 03:39:27.616
This model is ideal for 

03:39:28.860 --> 03:39:30.860
action-centered apps with 
deep-link APIs.

03:39:33.028 --> 03:39:35.515
In the content-driven model, we 
discovered a fulfillment URL 

03:39:35.516 --> 03:39:37.951
through your web content or 
structured data.

03:39:41.043 --> 03:39:43.043
We use the query to find the 
content 

03:39:44.334 --> 03:39:46.600
in your web presence and 
actions.xml to connect with the 

03:39:46.601 --> 03:39:51.321
appropriate content.  You must 
verify ownership of your content

03:39:51.322 --> 03:39:54.456
before you can use it in your 
app.  You can use Android's 

03:39:54.457 --> 03:39:59.237
verified app links or connect 
using your website using the 

03:39:59.238 --> 03:40:02.122
Google search console.  
    All that's really needed for

03:40:04.573 --> 03:40:06.573
fulfillment is linking your 
actions.

03:40:08.043 --> 03:40:10.043
xml to your web pages, but the 

03:40:11.101 --> 03:40:13.101
content-driven fulfillment model
works best with structured data.

03:40:15.811 --> 03:40:17.811
Structured data can describe the

03:40:19.075 --> 03:40:21.152
nouns, the inventory of your 
app.  Google provides a variety 

03:40:21.153 --> 03:40:24.828
of structured data programs.  
Some of them use web mark-up, 

03:40:24.829 --> 03:40:29.124
some of them use hosted data 
feeds.  Many of you probably 

03:40:29.125 --> 03:40:31.980
already participate in these 
programs.  You can use the 

03:40:31.981 --> 03:40:34.831
developer side to see if there's
a vertical program that fits 

03:40:36.475 --> 03:40:38.318
your specific use case, and you 
can find a link to the tool that

03:40:38.319 --> 03:40:40.319
you can use to 

03:40:41.852 --> 03:40:46.314
test your mark-up.  How do you 
actually submit your actions.xml

03:40:46.315 --> 03:40:48.776
to Google? Perhaps you're 
developing in Android 

03:40:52.881 --> 03:40:54.881
studio and you can include in 
the same 

03:40:56.161 --> 03:40:58.161
APK that you submit to the play 
console.

03:40:59.259 --> 03:41:01.695
It parses your actions and 
registers them in the actions on

03:41:01.696 --> 03:41:03.738
Google database.  This 
registration allows your app to 

03:41:05.770 --> 03:41:07.770
respond to queries and appear in

03:41:09.649 --> 03:41:12.088
suggestions in various Google 
products.  And how can you test 

03:41:12.089 --> 03:41:14.089
that your actions 

03:41:15.144 --> 03:41:17.397
work before you submit your app 
to Play? You can use our new 

03:41:17.398 --> 03:41:20.043
plugin for the Android studio 
called the app actions test 

03:41:20.044 --> 03:41:25.852
tool.  With this tool, you can 
validate your actions.xml and 

03:41:25.853 --> 03:41:27.853
submit it to actions on Google 

03:41:28.897 --> 03:41:31.134
in the special preview mode, 
which makes your actions 

03:41:31.135 --> 03:41:33.135
available just for your own 
developer account.

03:41:35.212 --> 03:41:37.212
You can then test how Google 
assistant 

03:41:40.170 --> 03:41:42.626
would invoke with different 
combinations of semantic intent 

03:41:42.627 --> 03:41:44.627
parameters.

03:41:46.388 --> 03:41:48.615
But enough talk.  
    In this first example, I 

03:41:48.616 --> 03:41:52.730
will show you how the URL 
template base fulfillment model 

03:41:52.731 --> 03:41:54.731
works.

03:41:55.767 --> 03:41:58.437
I will show you my favorite text
here that I built a couple weeks

03:41:58.438 --> 03:42:00.438
ago for this session.

03:42:03.562 --> 03:42:04.983
Can we switch the slides for 
just one moment? Switch to 

03:42:04.984 --> 03:42:06.984
slides?

03:42:08.039 --> 03:42:10.039
Thank you.  

03:42:12.929 --> 03:42:17.849
The order write intent comes 
with four parameters.  Each of 

03:42:17.850 --> 03:42:21.965
these parameters is defined as a
schema.org entity.  And you can 

03:42:21.966 --> 03:42:24.006
see on the slide how we parse 
out the parameters of that 

03:42:24.007 --> 03:42:26.899
entity from a user invocation.

03:42:31.430 --> 03:42:33.874
And now let's switch to the 
demo.  What you can see on your 

03:42:33.875 --> 03:42:37.760
screen is Android studio.  Many 
my Android project, I have my 

03:42:38.576 --> 03:42:40.576
actions.xml file open.

03:42:43.068 --> 03:42:45.125
You can see here that I'm 
registering my taxi app for the 

03:42:45.126 --> 03:42:47.126
order ride intent, 

03:42:48.611 --> 03:42:50.611
and I'm providing a URL 
template, in 

03:42:53.152 --> 03:42:55.152
this case it happens to be an 
HTTP URL, 

03:42:58.074 --> 03:43:02.807
but you can use app-specific 
URLs or intent URIs.  Here there

03:43:02.808 --> 03:43:05.055
are place holders for the 
drop-off and pick-up address.

03:43:08.123 --> 03:43:09.147
These parameters are mapped to 
the parameters of the intent.  

03:43:12.827 --> 03:43:15.821
Now, let's bring up the app 
actions test tool

03:43:24.114 --> 03:43:26.152
.  When I click the load actions
button, it will take the 

03:43:26.153 --> 03:43:30.012
actions.xml, parse it and submit
it to actions on Google in 

03:43:30.013 --> 03:43:32.264
preview mode.  So I can test 
what would happen if I 

03:43:36.081 --> 03:43:38.081
pass this particular parameter

03:43:42.602 --> 03:43:44.602
.  When I click run

03:43:53.748 --> 03:43:56.378
-- for some reason my phone 
switched to landscape mode, but 

03:43:56.379 --> 03:43:58.457
I think I made the point.  The 
tool passes from the parameter 

03:43:58.458 --> 03:44:03.145
to the app.  The way this 
happens is the tool simulates 

03:44:03.146 --> 03:44:05.149
what Google assistant would do 
if it received a particular 

03:44:05.150 --> 03:44:07.150
semantic intent with particular 
parameters.  

03:44:10.531 --> 03:44:14.019
More specifically, the tool 
constructs an action link.  And 

03:44:14.020 --> 03:44:16.245
you might have seen action links
earlier today in the actions on 

03:44:16.246 --> 03:44:18.246
Google talk.

03:44:19.566 --> 03:44:21.566
And this is a deep link to a 
specific 

03:44:23.863 --> 03:44:25.863
semantic intent in the 
assistant.

03:44:29.142 --> 03:44:32.042
Let's switch to slides, please. 

03:44:36.843 --> 03:44:37.158
We talked about the 
template-based fulfillment 

03:44:37.159 --> 03:44:40.113
model.  Let's talk about how the
content-driven model works.

03:44:44.799 --> 03:44:46.799
We have worked with Coursera to 
integrate their app actions.

03:44:49.117 --> 03:44:51.793
They are setting up with the 
take_course intent from our core

03:44:51.794 --> 03:44:56.919
catalog.  This takes a specific 
parameter of type schema.  You 

03:44:56.920 --> 03:44:59.576
can see how the properties of 
schema.course from a user 

03:44:59.577 --> 03:45:01.577
invocation.

03:45:05.285 --> 03:45:07.285
Now Coursera happens to elevate 
their 

03:45:08.560 --> 03:45:09.986
pages with structured data, and 
we can infer what the name of 

03:45:09.987 --> 03:45:11.987
the course is, what the course 
is about, and what the 

03:45:15.381 --> 03:45:17.381
specific deep link URL for the 
course is.

03:45:20.552 --> 03:45:22.595
Since Coursera is use ing 
verified app links, we can use 

03:45:22.596 --> 03:45:24.596
it to open on the device.

03:45:28.136 --> 03:45:30.136
Let's switch to the laptop, 
please.  Thank you.  

03:45:36.203 --> 03:45:38.699
Here is the actions.xml could 
look like for Coursera.

03:45:42.005 --> 03:45:44.005
They are signing up for the 
take_course intent, and for the 

03:45:46.506 --> 03:45:48.948
parameter, there is an inventory
reference that ties this 

03:45:48.949 --> 03:45:53.057
registration to schema.org 
course structures located on 

03:45:53.058 --> 03:45:55.058
these web pages.

03:45:57.588 --> 03:45:59.857
And the URL template takes the 
URL discovered from structured 

03:45:59.858 --> 03:46:03.394
data as a refer parameter.  
Again, we can bring up the app 

03:46:03.395 --> 03:46:05.395
actions test tool.

03:46:10.085 --> 03:46:12.085
Submit actions in preview mode

03:46:14.326 --> 03:46:16.326
.  And let's see what would 
happen if I 

03:46:18.573 --> 03:46:20.573
wanted to study machine learning

03:46:27.022 --> 03:46:29.272
.  The Coursera app opens to the
specific deep link for the 

03:46:29.273 --> 03:46:31.273
machine learning course.

03:46:33.622 --> 03:46:35.293
And if the demo Gods smile on 
us, perhaps we could see what 

03:46:35.294 --> 03:46:37.294
would happen 

03:46:40.656 --> 03:46:42.656
if I try the query, "What is 
deep learning?".  

03:46:52.094 --> 03:46:54.766
So here, Google is giving us -- 
the system is giving us another 

03:46:54.767 --> 03:46:58.437
chance to explain what deep 
learning is, but under the 

03:46:58.438 --> 03:47:00.085
answer there is a suggestion to 
learn more by taking a course 

03:47:00.086 --> 03:47:05.822
with Coursera.  And when I click
on that link, it opens a 

03:47:05.823 --> 03:47:07.823
specific deep link to a course 

03:47:09.860 --> 03:47:12.227
in the Coursera app.  Switch 
back to slides, please.  

03:47:18.374 --> 03:47:20.374
So you have seen how you can 
define 

03:47:21.649 --> 03:47:26.184
your intents and fulfillment 
using the actions.xml file.  You

03:47:26.185 --> 03:47:28.185
can further help us discover 
your 

03:47:29.677 --> 03:47:31.677
apps by integrating usage 
logging 

03:47:32.775 --> 03:47:37.130
through your app, using Firebase
app indexing APIs.  Action 

03:47:37.131 --> 03:47:39.370
logging through Firebase and 
indexing helps Google provide 

03:47:42.235 --> 03:47:43.650
personalized suggestions based 
on the context and usage 

03:47:43.651 --> 03:47:45.651
patterns.

03:47:47.141 --> 03:47:49.594
If you often listen to jazz 
music on your evening commute, 

03:47:49.595 --> 03:47:51.595
it will show a 

03:47:52.677 --> 03:47:54.677
suggestion to play cool jazz 
music when you get into the car.

03:47:58.320 --> 03:48:00.513
If we know that you keep 
watching a show, we can suggest 

03:48:00.514 --> 03:48:05.460
when the next episode comes out.
Action logging can help the 

03:48:05.461 --> 03:48:08.119
action suggestions.  This is not
a new API, but we have 

03:48:11.187 --> 03:48:13.187
made changes to support app 
actions.

03:48:14.446 --> 03:48:15.867
You can tie to a specific 
semantic intent and specific 

03:48:15.868 --> 03:48:19.859
parameter values.  Users remain 
in control of their data at all 

03:48:19.860 --> 03:48:23.758
times.  They can see and control
all of their logged activity 

03:48:23.759 --> 03:48:25.787
using their my activity website 
and opt out of action logging 

03:48:26.199 --> 03:48:28.199
all together.  

03:48:31.537 --> 03:48:33.375
I will now pass the stage to Luv
who will talk to you about how 

03:48:33.376 --> 03:48:35.376
you can 

03:48:37.271 --> 03:48:39.271
enhance your actions by adding 
rich UI 

03:48:40.378 --> 03:48:42.378
and conversational fulfillment. 

03:48:43.417 --> 03:48:46.723
&gt;&gt; LUV KOTHARI: Thank you Ilya 
and thank you demo Gods.  This 

03:48:46.724 --> 03:48:51.293
was incredible.  I want to give 
a big shout out to multiple 

03:48:51.294 --> 03:48:54.144
product teams that have worked 
together on this feature.  I 

03:48:54.145 --> 03:48:56.641
mean, if you imagine, right, you
have Android as a developer 

03:48:56.642 --> 03:49:00.958
eco-system, and you've got 
actions on Google.  It's never 

03:49:00.959 --> 03:49:03.681
easy when you try to make both 
of these eco-systems work 

03:49:03.682 --> 03:49:05.943
together as seamlessly as you 
have just seen here.  

03:49:09.452 --> 03:49:11.114
To recap, as a developer, you 
can participate in actions by 

03:49:11.115 --> 03:49:13.115
registering 

03:49:16.884 --> 03:49:20.952
your app and the actions in your
app in your actions.xml file.  

03:49:20.953 --> 03:49:23.794
You can provide URLs.  You can 
report action usage fusing 

03:49:26.669 --> 03:49:28.669
Firebase app indexing to help 
your app rank better.

03:49:30.786 --> 03:49:32.832
However, app actions, as we 
think of it, is just the first 

03:49:32.833 --> 03:49:34.833
step in your journey with 
actions.

03:49:36.939 --> 03:49:39.803
The more ways with which you can
enhance actions and further 

03:49:39.804 --> 03:49:43.701
increase engagement with users. 
First, you can use slices to 

03:49:43.702 --> 03:49:45.702
enhance 

03:49:46.704 --> 03:49:52.129
action representation through 
rich UI templates.  And you can 

03:49:52.130 --> 03:49:55.978
build conversational experiences
and multimodality experiences in

03:49:55.979 --> 03:49:57.979
the Google eco-system.  

03:49:59.251 --> 03:50:01.510
Slices enhance presentation 
through templates.  These 

03:50:01.511 --> 03:50:03.511
templates are designed to appear

03:50:04.999 --> 03:50:06.999
outside the app in the Android 
system 

03:50:08.608 --> 03:50:11.579
UI, like notifications like 
assistant and search.

03:50:15.502 --> 03:50:17.502
These templates support flexible

03:50:18.580 --> 03:50:20.580
layouts, interactive controls 
like 

03:50:23.106 --> 03:50:25.106
sliders and toggles, like data 
like 

03:50:26.415 --> 03:50:28.415
realtime pricing served directly
on the app on the user's phone.

03:50:33.420 --> 03:50:35.420
Slices are compatible with API 
19 or 

03:50:37.968 --> 03:50:39.588
above and enables you to get to 
over 95% of Android devices out 

03:50:39.589 --> 03:50:43.656
there.  Pretty cool.  
    This year slices are 

03:50:43.657 --> 03:50:45.657
launched on Google search on 
Android.

03:50:48.209 --> 03:50:50.209
We have a whole session 
dedicated to 

03:50:53.830 --> 03:50:55.063
slices norms tomorrow at 8:30 on
stage four.  Hope to see you 

03:50:55.064 --> 03:50:57.738
there.  
    What about the new devices 

03:50:57.739 --> 03:51:02.254
and platforms? Things that you 
heard from Brad in the developer

03:51:02.255 --> 03:51:04.500
keynote this afternoon? You can 
extend your services to new 

03:51:06.953 --> 03:51:09.214
devices and form factors by 
building conversational actions 

03:51:09.215 --> 03:51:14.535
and multi-modality experiences 
for Google Assistant.  Again, to

03:51:14.536 --> 03:51:16.590
learn more, please attend our 
technical session on Thursday 

03:51:19.043 --> 03:51:23.726
morning at 10:30 on stage 4.  
Actually, it's 9:30.  My bad.

03:51:26.797 --> 03:51:30.113
I hope you're as excited about 
this project as we can.  Many 

03:51:30.114 --> 03:51:31.367
Android developers are already 
building support for actions and

03:51:31.368 --> 03:51:35.880
hope you will as well.  If 
you're interested, please let us

03:51:36.905 --> 03:51:39.782
know at G.co/appactions.

03:51:44.518 --> 03:51:46.946
You can learn more on the page, 
and we will be starting an early

03:51:46.947 --> 03:51:49.407
access program next month and 
hopefully some of you will sign 

03:51:49.408 --> 03:51:53.912
up for that.  We would love to 
hear your feedback, and 

03:51:53.913 --> 03:51:55.913
specifically on intents and the 

03:51:56.941 --> 03:51:58.361
catalog we're building for 
intents.  

03:51:58.362 --> 03:52:00.362
Over the next two days, we have 

03:52:01.850 --> 03:52:03.850
quite a few venues to answer any
burning questions you may have.

03:52:05.970 --> 03:52:08.871
We have office hours and in both
sandboxes in Android as well as 

03:52:10.504 --> 03:52:12.583
Assistant where we can show you 
these things live and answer any

03:52:12.584 --> 03:52:14.584
questions you may have.

03:52:16.098 --> 03:52:18.098
We have two more sessions, one 
on 

03:52:20.194 --> 03:52:23.450
slices and one on actions the 
day after tomorrow.  And you 

03:52:23.451 --> 03:52:25.451
will be able to upload the 
actions.

03:52:29.339 --> 03:52:31.339

03:52:38.039 --> 03:52:40.039
ing the Play console.  Thank you
so much.  

03:52:40.523 --> 03:52:42.523
[ Applause ] 
   &gt;&gt; LUV KOTHARI: Thank you.

03:52:59.251 --> 03:53:01.251
   &gt;&gt; Thank you for joining this
session.

03:53:04.012 --> 03:53:06.502
Brand ambassadors will assist 
with directing you through the 

03:53:06.503 --> 03:53:09.371
designated exits.  We'll be 
making room for those who 

03:53:10.411 --> 03:53:13.260
registered for the next session.
If you've registered for the 

03:53:13.261 --> 03:53:15.307
next session in this room, we 
ask that you 

03:53:18.370 --> 03:53:19.993
please clear the room and return
via the registration line 

03:53:19.994 --> 03:53:21.994
outside.  Thank you.

I don't

04:53:29.688 --> 04:53:31.688
-- you know what I seem saying?

04:53:33.249 --> 04:53:35.249
It is as important as creating 
an app 

04:53:38.358 --> 04:53:41.094
or creating something, you know,
having the voices there that has

04:53:41.095 --> 04:53:44.365
the experience in those 
communities, because you really 

04:53:44.366 --> 04:53:47.438
don't know what you don't know. 
That's what I learned by going 

04:53:47.439 --> 04:53:52.363
to Africa.  You don't know what 
you don't know, but I knew I was

04:53:52.364 --> 04:53:54.489
going to look at it with beauty.
I knew I was going to look at it

04:53:54.490 --> 04:53:57.373
with the lens of absolute 
modernism and 

04:54:00.455 --> 04:54:02.455
beauty and capability, all the 
things 

04:54:03.510 --> 04:54:06.174
that I wanted to put into 
Panther.  I wasn't looking for 

04:54:06.175 --> 04:54:11.133
the commercial with the 
poverty-stricken children.  I 

04:54:11.134 --> 04:54:12.577
wasn't looking for the things 
that we're told the continent 

04:54:12.578 --> 04:54:16.490
is.  I was looking for the joy 
and pride and dignity of the 

04:54:16.491 --> 04:54:18.491
people that lived there.

04:54:20.170 --> 04:54:22.207
And, you know, that's the choice
we make for wherever we are, 

04:54:22.208 --> 04:54:25.085
because I met people who lived 
in the rural parts of 

04:54:28.554 --> 04:54:30.554
Africa just as much as people 
lived in 

04:54:33.424 --> 04:54:35.424
the modern cities like Johan

04:54:37.236 --> 04:54:39.236
asburg, Durbin, Cape Town.  You 
could see someone dressed in 

04:54:41.884 --> 04:54:43.884
tradition

04:54:47.270 --> 04:54:48.083
al Zulu in the city just as much
as you might see that in rural 

04:54:48.084 --> 04:54:50.084
areas.

04:54:51.176 --> 04:54:53.176
So I decided not only to find 
myself 

04:54:54.247 --> 04:54:56.247
and realized that I think I have
been 

04:55:00.216 --> 04:55:02.216
African this entire time, but 
that was 

04:55:03.497 --> 04:55:05.497
determined to find all the 
beautiful 

04:55:08.214 --> 04:55:11.090
things that I was told weren't 
there.  That, then really came 

04:55:11.091 --> 04:55:16.469
back to who I am as a person, 
you know what I mean? It related

04:55:16.470 --> 04:55:18.470
back to who I am and how I felt 
about myself and the confidence 

04:55:18.514 --> 04:55:20.514
that I had.

04:55:22.578 --> 04:55:23.614
Our fictional world building 
bleeds back into our realities. 

04:55:23.615 --> 04:55:25.615
   &gt;&gt; JOHN MAEDA: We have two 
minutes left.

04:55:28.546 --> 04:55:30.374
Could you share a non-fiction 
story you shared with me that 

04:55:30.375 --> 04:55:33.441
moved me very much about your 
director, who I'm a huge fan of.

04:55:36.715 --> 04:55:39.166
In Silicon Valley, we talk about
leadership, CEO, or the product 

04:55:40.381 --> 04:55:42.625
managers, the CEO of the 
product, and the CEO-ish things.

04:55:49.061 --> 04:55:51.509
I think of Ryan Kugler as one of
the creative CEO's of our time. 

04:55:51.510 --> 04:55:55.789
   &gt;&gt; HANNAH BEACHLER: When I 
was talking to myself? You 

04:55:55.790 --> 04:55:57.790
obviously know I'm weird.

04:56:00.968 --> 04:56:03.850
We're working on "Creed," and 
we're tech scouting.  You can 

04:56:03.851 --> 04:56:06.297
spend all day, and we had 
stopped at this coffee shop, and

04:56:06.298 --> 04:56:10.586
I got my coffee, and I was 
working out a problem, and when 

04:56:10.587 --> 04:56:12.641
I'm trying to work out a problem
or solve a problem, I talk out 

04:56:14.289 --> 04:56:16.736
loud to myself, because that's 
the best way to do it for me, 

04:56:16.737 --> 04:56:18.737
apparently.

04:56:20.474 --> 04:56:22.474
And you know, my friends and 
stuff, we 

04:56:23.978 --> 04:56:25.193
were like poke fun at me like 
you're crazy, talking to 

04:56:25.194 --> 04:56:29.704
yourself.  So sometimes I do and
I don't know I'm doing it.  So 

04:56:29.705 --> 04:56:31.961
Ryan comes walking over to me, 
and he was like, are you talking

04:56:31.962 --> 04:56:37.100
to yourself? And I was like a 
little like oh.  I know you and 

04:56:37.101 --> 04:56:39.101
love you, but yeah.

04:56:40.384 --> 04:56:41.814
And the first thing he said when
he looked at me, he said that's 

04:56:41.815 --> 04:56:45.096
the sign of a really healthy 
mind and a really intelligent 

04:56:45.097 --> 04:56:48.982
person.  And he turned around 
and walked away.  And I was kind

04:56:48.983 --> 04:56:50.983
of like ready to get 

04:56:52.891 --> 04:56:53.907
the hit of, like, oh, you're 
crazy funny joke joke, but a 

04:56:53.908 --> 04:56:56.565
little bit of a slight.  And 
that's not at all where his mind

04:56:58.012 --> 04:57:00.012
came from.  It looked for the 
immediate positive 

04:57:03.123 --> 04:57:09.069
thing about the thing that I was
doing.  Sometime that sometimes 

04:57:09.070 --> 04:57:11.145
people think is weird or could 
make you feel a certain way 

04:57:11.146 --> 04:57:15.438
about yourself that eventually 
starts beating you down and 

04:57:15.439 --> 04:57:18.110
making, you know, defining who 
you are, because you're hearing 

04:57:18.314 --> 04:57:22.097
negative things about it.  That 
is who Ryan is.  He's the person

04:57:22.098 --> 04:57:24.098
that will constantly 

04:57:26.222 --> 04:57:28.222
lift people up, you know.

04:57:29.317 --> 04:57:31.574
And he's not perfect, I promise.
There's days that I'm like 

04:57:31.575 --> 04:57:38.318
please make a decision.  You 
have two hours.  And he does all

04:57:38.319 --> 04:57:41.197
the things that directors do 
that can completely bother you 

04:57:41.198 --> 04:57:43.321
or things that are like amazing.
He's the type of person like we 

04:57:43.322 --> 04:57:45.322
would 

04:57:48.274 --> 04:57:51.174
be on set for Warrior Falls 
where they had the big fight.  

04:57:51.175 --> 04:57:52.841
And he gathered us all around in
a big circle.  Some people were 

04:57:52.842 --> 04:57:54.842
in the water.

04:57:55.951 --> 04:57:58.407
And he really told us why that 
scene was important.  This was 

04:57:58.408 --> 04:58:00.306
before we started shooting.  He 
started to say why that scene 

04:58:00.307 --> 04:58:02.307
was important to him.

04:58:05.216 --> 04:58:07.216
And really talked about having 
all the 

04:58:08.693 --> 04:58:10.942
fictional tribes of Wakanda in 
one place and represented by all

04:58:10.943 --> 04:58:12.943
the references we 

04:58:14.414 --> 04:58:16.262
used, the different tribes in 
sub Saharan Africa, and how that

04:58:16.263 --> 04:58:19.969
was a big part of him really 
feeling complete.  And you know,

04:58:19.970 --> 04:58:21.970
you are holding hands 

04:58:23.452 --> 04:58:25.135
and he's telling us all this, 
and we're standing in a circle, 

04:58:25.136 --> 04:58:27.136
and you feel like 

04:58:28.231 --> 04:58:30.508
you can take on the entire world
at that point.  So that's who he

04:58:30.509 --> 04:58:32.509
is as a director and my friend.

04:58:36.256 --> 04:58:38.699
And he is a really important 
voice because his perspective on

04:58:38.700 --> 04:58:40.700
anything and everything is the 
most unique 

04:58:43.466 --> 04:58:46.330
perspective I promise you will 
ever hear from anybody.  If you 

04:58:46.331 --> 04:58:49.179
ever get a chance to talk to 
him, talk to him.  He will turn 

04:58:49.180 --> 04:58:51.180
a situation and make you 

04:58:52.889 --> 04:58:55.130
see it from a side you were 
never maybe even meant to see it

04:58:55.131 --> 04:58:59.035
from, and all the sudden your 
world opens up.  And so I can 

04:58:59.036 --> 04:59:01.036
always -- he would be standing 
here going like oh, please stop.

04:59:05.380 --> 04:59:08.425
He is really that great.  
   &gt;&gt; JOHN MAEDA: Thanks for 

04:59:08.426 --> 04:59:12.308
sharing that story.  What a 
leader, and what a designer.  

04:59:12.309 --> 04:59:14.573
Thank you.  
   &gt;&gt; HANNAH BEACHLER: Wow.  

04:59:14.574 --> 04:59:17.572
[ Cheers and Applause ] 

05:00:00.848 --> 05:00:03.847
S

05:01:04.190 --> 05:01:06.190
&gt;&gt; Thank you for joining this 
session.

05:01:07.450 --> 05:01:10.338
Brand ambassadors will assist 
you in exiting through the 

05:01:10.339 --> 05:01:12.339
exits.
