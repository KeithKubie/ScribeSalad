00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.230
&gt;&gt;presenter: Thanks everyone for coming today.

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:08.870
We have author George Dyson here to talk about
his upcoming book, or brand new book Turingís

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.590
Cathedral: The Origins of the Digital Universe.

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:17.860
The creation stories of revolutionary technologies
is pretty deeply embedded in American culture.

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.400
We all learned very young about Benjamin Franklinís
experiments with electricity and Thomas Edison

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.550
work on the light bulb, however, the story
of the invention of the computer, which is

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.050
arguably going to have much, a far greater
impact even though itís based functionally

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.250
on those earlier technologies, is largely
missing from our collective knowledge.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.250
Dysonís new work sheds important light on
this and, on this creation of this and, uh,

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.430
this wonderful invention and how the digital
universe exploded in the aftermath of World

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:46.540
War II.

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.490
So, besides going deep into the early history
of the computer Turingís Cathedral also offers

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:56.000
a series of provocative suggestions as to
where the digital universe may be headed next.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.559
And so without further ado, letís welcome
George Dyson.

00:00:58.559 --> 00:00:59.559
[Applause]

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:01.460
&gt;&gt;George Dyson: Thank you.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.670
Itís great to be here and see everybody working.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:12.560
I come here every summer for Sci-Fu but in
the old days of Sci-Fu, sort of, we mingled

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.749
with the Google people that was part of the
idea but now Sci-Fu sort of isolated and we

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:21.310
donít really see the people who are working,
weíre separated from the Sci-Fu people.

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.959
But I was here seven years ago, in fact, thatís
where the title of this book comes from and

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:30.130
Iíll explain that a little later.

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:37.189
And, Iím coming to this; I just have to say
this in all honesty, from totally left field.

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:43.539
Iím not a computer scientist, Iím not, I
dropped out of high school at age sixteen

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:48.032
and have no credentials that Iím interested
in things, I get curious about them and sort

00:01:48.032 --> 00:01:50.200
of obsessed.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.180
So I actually, by trade, Iím a boat builder.

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.609
I design and build boats.

00:01:54.609 --> 00:02:00.739
And I am best known, far beyond anything in
computing history or anything else, because

00:02:00.739 --> 00:02:04.399
I lived in a tree house for three years.

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:07.369
It was 95 feet up in a Douglas Fir Tree.

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:08.390
So thatís half way.

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.470
The bottom of the tree would be down at about
the floor.

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.930
Thatís the house.

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.620
And in that tree house I read lots of books.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:16.620
I had time.

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.150
I had time on a scale that no one can imagine
today.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.900
You know, no e-mail, no distractions.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:29.610
I read the entire 6,000 pages of Cooks Journals
one winter and then I came down.

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:30.880
And so Iím gonna thank a few people.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.310
The book that Iím here for was published
yesterday, so itís still, still a new thing.

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.340
First of all, my sister Esther, who some of
you probably know.

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:45.230
Sheís played a role in a lot of the start
ups here and in Silicon Valley she actually,

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.820
I think, had some of the original investment
in Google at the very beginning.

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.200
There she is with her friend Bill in 1984.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.850
And Esther was very kind to sort of extract
her brother from the Canadian wilderness and

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:03.720
bring me down to her, at that time she produced
the annual conference for the computer, it

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.120
was actually called in the beginning the Rosen
Electronics Forum.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.360
It dealt mainly with semiconductors and suddenly
the main application for semiconductors became

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.010
the personal computer.

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.650
So she introduced me to this world and I got
to see what was going on.

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:26.190
And it brought me back to my childhood when
I was a young child there was a guy named,

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.610
my father worked at this placed called The
Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton,

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.920
but not part of the university, my mother
worked there too.

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.340
And most of those scientists were doing completely
boring things.

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.380
They worked on pencil and paper and maybe
they wrote on the chalkboard and erased it

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:43.380
the next day.

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:49.290
But Johnny Von Neumann had a building out
back where he was building a computer.

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:55.540
And it was not the first computer, itís impossible
to get the people, you know, discussing and

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.000
trying to sell this book, to not say, ìGeorgeís
book is about the first computer.î Itís

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000
not the first computer.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.590
There were many, many computers before this
computer.

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:10.080
It was one of the first computers to have
a two dimensional speed of light address matrix

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:16.060
which is the world that you guys are all living
in today, where you can give a numerical coordinate

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.690
and get back a string of bits.

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.329
That was the thing that was new and thatís
what Von Neumann saw.

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:26.169
The model was Turing, Alan Turing's one dimensional
model and Von Neumann made it two dimensional,

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:29.860
thatís sort of the key moment in history
Iím trying to look at.

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:36.099
Not who invented the first computer, weíre
gonna argue about that forever.

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:39.419
You know, weíll learn by arguing about it,
but it sort of gets pointless after a while.

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:46.240
So in 1984 just after I came down from the
tree house, I wrote this piece about Von Neumann

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.849
trying to give it to the people at my sisterís
conference, who really were not interested.

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:56.330
They were interested in whether DOS, which
sort of flavor of DOS would win next year.

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:57.650
So nothing happened.

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:04.080
But eventually this became this book, Darwin
Among the Machines, which was probably too

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.629
far ahead of its time but still in print.

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:12.949
And looks at this very large description of
where did this digital universe come from

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:14.180
on the long side?

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:18.979
In this book, I take it back to Thomas Hobbes
in the 17th century.

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:25.890
One of the people who appreciated this book
was Charles Simonyi from Xerox PARC, right

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:28.110
across the street here.

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:33.460
And thatís Charles in Budapest, Hungary with
a holographic bust of Johnny Von Neumann,

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.419
who is a national hero in Hungary.

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:43.180
And it was Charles who said, ìGeorge, you
know you should go dig this stuff out.î He

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:49.639
sort of sensed that I had a passion for excavating
digital archeology.

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:55.520
Heís the guy who pulled the strings to open
the doors to the history of advanced study

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:00.889
where there archives had been kept closed
to outside researchers since 1946.

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:06.729
And I happened to come, be with Charles when
he came to Google for the first time.

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:09.389
We were riding a bus together to an event
here.

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:13.749
And we drove up, and he was still at Microsoft
then, and we drove up in front of building

00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:19.880
43, and what he said, which I can probably
repeat now, not at the time, cause heís left

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:23.120
Microsoft, but he said, ìOh shit!

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:29.410
Building 43, weíre screwed.î Cause he thought
you guys already had 43 buildings.

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:33.449
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;George Dyson: And you were only 2 years

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:36.759
old.

00:06:36.759 --> 00:06:43.330
So Charles sent me on this path ten years
ago to go and try to find the documents of

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:44.520
really happened.

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:50.589
And the path always ends if you, if youíre
interested in history you sort of, you start

00:06:50.589 --> 00:06:54.949
reading books that are gateway drugs.

00:06:54.949 --> 00:06:56.650
Books lead you to libraries.

00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:00.080
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;George Dyson: And libraries lead you to

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.080
archives.

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:04.800
And then the final, sort of the heroine of
the whole thing, is eventually you get to

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:09.270
stuff that is not even the archives and thatís,
thatís what I do now.

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:14.789
This is the filing cabinet belonging to Johnny
Von Neumannís daughter in Ann Arbor Michigan.

00:07:14.789 --> 00:07:17.020
Itís always next to the water heater in the
basement.

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:21.569
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;George Dyson: All of John Von Neumannís

00:07:21.569 --> 00:07:26.339
papers went the library of Congress, but this
filing cabinet didnít and his daughter said,

00:07:26.339 --> 00:07:30.619
you know, ìYou should come to Ann Arbor,
maybe, and take a look.î She didnít, nobody

00:07:30.619 --> 00:07:31.619
had looked.

00:07:31.619 --> 00:07:36.770
I opened, and to me as a historian, the most
interesting, sort of, dark period of technology

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:43.469
history is like between 1937, just before
World War II and Sputnik.

00:07:43.469 --> 00:07:46.129
After Sputnik we started documenting everything
really well.

00:07:46.129 --> 00:07:49.210
But thereís sort of a dark period where we
donít really know what happened.

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:54.809
So I opened that bottom drawer and itís all
the letters back and forth, both directions

00:07:54.809 --> 00:08:01.309
between Johnny and Klara from 1937 to when
he died in 1957.

00:08:01.309 --> 00:08:07.210
And Von Neumann when he built this machine,
he needed to write the code for it, there

00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:10.569
was nobody who did that kind of thing, so
he taught Klara how to write the codes.

00:08:10.569 --> 00:08:14.310
So she wrote all the early codes and these
letters were all back and forth.

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:17.680
Heís, like there heís at Los Alamos, sheís
in Washington D.C.

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:23.110
And there sheís at Aberdeen where the ENIAC
was, so sheís writing codes for the ENIAC

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:29.550
and heís, uh, at Oak Ridge laboratory, nuclear
laboratory in Tennessee.

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:36.020
So all this stuff was there, half in Hungarian,
but Bela Bolobas and his wife Gabriella translated

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:39.330
it for me, so that, thatís the source of
this book.

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:43.950
When, until then I was struggling, then I
had the raw material to really bring this

00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:44.950
story to life.

00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:49.700
And Klara was a fantastic writer, even though
English was a second language, her journals

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:55.960
of coming to America and learning to code
these computers and seeing it all are just,

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:59.280
if you read the book I think youíll find
sheís the voice that really keeps it all

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:00.690
going.

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:08.800
In Seattle, at the University Towers Hotel,
he gets invited to give the dance lectures

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:16.320
in 1940 at University of Washington and they
drive across America, you know, on Route 66

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:21.720
in his V8 Cadillac coupe and itís all there
in the journals, itís fantastic.

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:26.470
They stop at a bar in Nevada, and a guy comes
into the bar with a mule and the bartender

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:28.990
gives the mule a bucket of beer.

00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:34.650
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;George Dyson: And the other source of, the

00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:42.980
sort of, real life to this story was a crazy
brilliant Italian, Norwegian mathematical

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:48.080
viral geneticist Nils Aal Barricelli, who
the moment even before Von Neumann got the

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:54.430
machine running, 1959 Baricelli writes to
Von Neumann from Norway saying he wants to

00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:58.010
come and run numerical evolution experiments
on this machine.

00:09:58.010 --> 00:10:01.330
And the machine is being built to hydrogen
bomb, hydro dynamic calculations.

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:06.350
So Von Neumann makes a deal, well you can
have the bomb guys sort of work all night

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:11.350
but they still fade out and go home at 2 or
3 in the morning and Baricelli gets the machine

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:12.540
the rest of the night.

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:17.420
And he has a knack for keeping, even with
no engineers he often keeps it going, you

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:19.480
know, until daylight.

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:26.410
So, now, Iíve been working on this five years,
I had a book contract for two years, itís

00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:31.370
what you get from publishers is two years,
Iím now, now really two years overdue and

00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:36.150
I still havenít started writing the book
and the publisher, theyíre gonna cancel my

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:37.150
contract.

00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:40.880
So I finally started writing this by putting
these slides together and I went and found,

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:42.090
ìOkay I can find the notebook.

00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:43.620
I wrote the first word.

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:46.850
It was gonna be called Baricelliís Universe,
but then the publishers, well, ìWhoís Baricelli,

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:50.160
nobody knows?î So thatís why Turing got
the title.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:55.170
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;George Dyson: Using the wonders of, you

00:10:55.170 --> 00:11:00.620
know Photoshop; you can actually erase the
context and see the second, so here, whatís

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:03.100
the first sentence I wrote.

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:06.650
ìItís Princeton New Jersey where this took
place.

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:12.220
In summer is so hot and humid that the atmosphere
has been described as quote ìLike the inside

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:16.550
of a dogís mouth.î Itís sensing itís the
worse place in the world to try and build

00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:21.550
an electrostatic memory computer, but they
did.î And that sentence actually survived.

00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:24.730
Itís the opening sentence of Chapter 2.

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:28.740
So I had the first sentence in the book, but
no book.

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:33.720
Now I work in a bar, old bar in Bellingham
Washington so I could lay out, you know, one

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:36.430
by one, the chapters.

00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:41.760
So Turing comes into the picture because,
you know, the conception of all this goes

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:42.760
back to Turing.

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:46.510
Turing came to Princeton in 1936, he stayed
for two years.

00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:50.650
He worked fairly closely with Johnny Von Neumann
who always credited Turing.

00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:56.840
Von Neumann always said, ìThe original idea
was Turingís, all I did was implement it.î

00:11:56.840 --> 00:12:03.390
And why we now have an incredible divisive
battle going on between people who think the

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:07.990
Americanís get too much credit, people who
think that British get too much credit and

00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:11.740
at the time both sides were absolutely collaborating
with each other.

00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:16.520
There was not rivalry until, sort of, the
historians who came in later.

00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:21.130
In 1950 Alan Turing whoís very interested
in the, the whole idea of what we now call,

00:12:21.130 --> 00:12:26.990
artificial intelligence, he starts asking
the question, ìCan machines think?î And

00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:29.330
immediately people are saying, ìOh no, donít
go there.

00:12:29.330 --> 00:12:33.900
Thatís sort of playing God and only God and
people can think.

00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:39.990
How can machines think?î And he answers that
question, I think, in a very tactful way.

00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:48.820
ìWhen we build intelligent machines, weíre
not creating souls weíre creating the mansions

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:54.790
for the souls that only he can create.î And
I think thatí, thatís how I feel.

00:12:54.790 --> 00:13:02.490
And then itís 2005, Chris DiBona who invites
me here to Google, cause 19-, 2005 is sixty

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:05.160
years from when this project started.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:10.650
So I came and gave a similar afternoon talk
on that anniversary.

00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:15.510
And when I walked in here I got sort of the
engineering tour of what youíre doing in

00:13:15.510 --> 00:13:16.840
the basement and other places.

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:19.560
I saw the first of the Mars data coming in
and stuff.

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:25.510
And then as I walked out after giving the
talk I just, this phrase came to my mind,

00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:30.240
ìThis is not, what youíre doing here at
Google, thatís not Turingís mansion, this

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:35.110
is Turingís Cathedral.î And thatís, so
thatís, the title of this book actually comes,

00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:38.680
not from this right here, I gave the talk
in the cafeteria, it was very bad acoustics.

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:40.910
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; George Dyson: But thatís, thatís the

00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:41.940
source of Turingís Cathedral.

00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:45.840
And thatís not in the book, thatís sort
of the back story that people donít know.

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:50.650
The front story is just cathedral, cathedrals
are built by large numbers of anonymous people

00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:52.850
and thatís how computing is.

00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:57.610
Everybodyís putting a little brick here a
little brick there and in the end you get

00:13:57.610 --> 00:13:59.050
this cathedral.

00:13:59.050 --> 00:14:04.760
So finally, uh, Iíve sort of got the beginnings
of a book.

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:06.530
The subtitle was A Creation Myth.

00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:11.380
I didnít want people to think I was telling,
I didnít want to be held to telling the truth.

00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:16.840
I just wanted to tell what I, the best of
my knowledge, what I think happened.

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:20.080
Iím not interested so much in who is first,
but what really happened.

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:24.260
And we lack a, we live in this digital universe,
but we donít really have a common creation

00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:27.160
myth about how it started.

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:36.000
And thereís three things that as an author
that youíre terrified of hearing from your

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.180
publisher.

00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:42.040
The first one if your rejection letter, ìItís
a lovely book but we canít publish it.î

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:47.310
The second one is, ìYouíre late and weíre
gonna cancel your contract.î And the third

00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:52.300
one is, ìWe have a cover and we think you
will like it.î

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:57.730
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;George Dyson: Every time Iíve got that

00:14:57.730 --> 00:14:59.580
message from publishers theyíre just horribly
disappointing.

00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:06.310
Some of the covers Iíve had for my books
are just excruciating, but in this case, it

00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:07.310
was true.

00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:12.660
They, Pantheon, their designer, Peter Mendelsund,
came up with this cover that was so brilliant.

00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:16.510
I mean, I loved it, nothing got changed.

00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:21.170
The idea, sort of, cover is punched, like
the punch cards, at random machine.

00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:25.380
So you see, you know the digital, thereís
the transition between analog and digital,

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:27.420
itís there in the physical cover of the book.

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:30.500
And you wonít get that in an EBook.

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:34.171
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; George Dyson: 1912 Turing was born, so

00:15:34.171 --> 00:15:40.880
exactly 100 years ago Sara Turing, his mom,
was five months pregnant and weíre counting

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:48.110
down to the centenary of Alan Turin, who deserves
all the, you know, he had a tragic life.

00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:51.360
He, people say he did commit suicide, we think
he committed suicide.

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:57.420
Weíre not sure, but he died of cyanide poisoning
under ambiguous circumstances at the age of

00:15:57.420 --> 00:15:58.690
41.

00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:06.670
And the opening page of this book is a tribute
to Leibniz who in 1697 reminded us that it

00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:09.900
was not made for those who sell oil or sardines.

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:14.210
Which, modern translation would be, Google
isnít all about ads, thereís other stuff

00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:16.400
going on.

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:23.540
And what Iím going to do now, because the
book has all these, again they kept the 82

00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:24.600
illustrations I gave them.

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:28.800
Iím just going to show you the illustrations
in color, but if you have the book theyíll

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:30.160
be there in black and white.

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:31.680
So theyíre all very carefully chosen.

00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:37.740
That is the dawn of the digital universe,
or of the modern digital, we certainly had,

00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:45.140
we had punch cards long before that but this
is one of the first of these electronic memory

00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:49.450
tubes where the bits actually are charged
spots on the face of the tube.

00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:53.260
Now, you know, we have solid state memory
and we display it on a display.

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:58.840
And in this case, the actual memory were spots
of light on the face of a glass tube, so you

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:05.300
could see, there were 40 of these tubes, you
could see the computation preceding.

00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:08.970
This is a scrap of paper I found in another
one of these basements by the water heaters,

00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:10.890
Julian Bigelowís basement.

00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:16.700
It was crumpled up and saved, it says, ìOrders
let a word 40 bd.î So that dates it from

00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:20.760
before they started using the word bit, binary
digits.

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:27.790
ìThe two orders, each order equal C of A,
a command.î They give the coordinates and

00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:28.790
an address.

00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:33.780
And to me thatís Moses coming off of a mountain
and saying ìLet there be the command line.î

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:37.370
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt; George Dyson: And we take that completely

00:17:37.370 --> 00:17:38.370
for granted.

00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:41.520
How could we, you know, was there ever a word
without commandments?

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:44.110
Well, there was and thatís the beginning
of it.

00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:49.100
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;George Dyson: And the engineers, no one

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:53.050
was supposed to talk about the fact that they
were actually designing hydrogen bombs, but

00:17:53.050 --> 00:17:55.190
here is, this is a late night log book.

00:17:55.190 --> 00:18:00.890
So this is significant because this is March
3rd 1953, so this is the first night that

00:18:00.890 --> 00:18:06.350
Baricelli starts writing his first ever, he
calls them numerical simbi organisms, now

00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:08.210
we call them digital organisms.

00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:14.230
So he stops and turns it over to the AEC bomb
people and thatís the log entry of that transition.

00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:20.990
So they were, on the one, why Von Neumann
was so amazing that he not only, he was trying

00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:25.070
to build a machine, a device that could destroy
all life on planet Earth.

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:29.180
A hydrogen bomb is the most evil thing that
has ever been created and at the same time

00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:32.520
he was talking about creating a new kind of
digital life.

00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:38.900
So thereís two very opposite things were
going on in the same, you know, it was 5 kilobytes

00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:40.020
of memory was all they had.

00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:45.470
Thatís Alan Turing at age 5 and Johnny Von
Neumann at age 7.

00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:51.970
So thereís, very much, complimentary personalities
between these two people.

00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:59.520
And, so it irritated me how all these historians
still are arguing about, ìWhat did Von Neumann

00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:00.730
take from Turing?

00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:02.330
Why didnít he give Turing credit?

00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:04.420
Did he read Turingís paper?

00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:07.320
People say, ìOh no, he didnít read Turingís
paper.î So I just thought Iíd go look in

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:09.200
Von Neumannís library.

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:14.580
Turingís paper was published in the proceedings
of the London mathematical society.

00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:17.370
Thatís the volume it was in.

00:19:17.370 --> 00:19:22.690
When you go to the institute library all the
volumes are absolutely untouched, mint, hardly

00:19:22.690 --> 00:19:24.730
been opened except volume 42.

00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:30.100
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;George Dyson: And itís clearly, you know,

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:33.650
itís been read so many times itís completely
fallen apart.

00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:35.730
They didnít have Xerox machine so they just,
yeah.

00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:39.140
And the engineers I spoke with, the few that
were left said, ìYeah, Von Neumann, we all

00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:40.200
had to read that paper.

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:44.550
Thatís what we were doing was building a
Turing machine.î So I think that answers

00:19:44.550 --> 00:19:46.750
the question.

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:51.290
And Turing was working in England, he was
in Princeton, but he went back to help with

00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:52.580
the war effort.

00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:58.870
Actually he saved, I think, I think he saved
England from being conquered by Germany because

00:19:58.870 --> 00:20:02.910
he helped break the Nazi U-boat codes.

00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:07.240
We forget how desperate England was, I mean
we were sending supplies to England but we

00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:11.480
hadnít entered the war yet and the Germans
were sinking the supply ships.

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:19.280
So he also, the engineers with him built,
what was effectively a Turing machine called

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:25.600
The Colossus built largely by Thomas, Tommy
Flowers, who came from the Post Office Electronic

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:32.340
Research Station and it was able to compare
coded sequences stored in vacuum tube memory

00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:38.330
with the intercepted coded sequences stored
on paper tape and so it really, it was, who,

00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:43.730
in fact you could say this was the archetype
of a search engine, searching for patterns

00:20:43.730 --> 00:20:45.290
in data.

00:20:45.290 --> 00:20:50.420
Thereís Turing getting on a bus, he was a
long distance runner, heís going to a marathon.

00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:57.850
Von Neumann with his machine that was built
by Julian Bigelow and it had twenty of these

00:20:57.850 --> 00:21:05.150
tubes on each side, so each of these cans
had a 32x32 array of bits and there were 40

00:21:05.150 --> 00:21:06.150
cans.

00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:11.920
So effectively they had a matrix that was
32x32x40 bits, which is five kilobytes.

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:15.610
Thatís one half second of an Mp3.

00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:21.050
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;George Dyson: They did this in the middle

00:21:21.050 --> 00:21:26.390
of New Jersey which is also, and sort of the
back story to all of this is always fascinating,

00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:35.990
so the, thatís the headwaters of the [inaudible]
and New York is here and so Philadelphia is

00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:36.990
there and so this has been settled in the
17th century.

00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:41.590
And a guy named Henry Greenland opens a tavern
there at the arrow so people going back and

00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:48.470
forth on that trail can stop and get a beer
and change their horses or spend the night.

00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:53.190
And then the Quakers led by William Penn,
theyíre trying to get as far away from New

00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:56.440
York and Philadelphia is possible.

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:59.230
So they also settle there, and they build
a Quaker meeting house.

00:21:59.230 --> 00:22:02.090
So you have this tavern and you have the Quaker
meeting house.

00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:07.990
And the tavern became Princeton University
and the Quaker meeting house that land became

00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:09.520
the Institute for Advanced Study.

00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:16.070
It only changed hands twice, from the Penn
family to the Olden family to the Institute.

00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:20.570
Then they built this fabulous headquarters,
the sort of Google Plex of its time.

00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:24.540
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;George Dyson: And this was built in 1939

00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:30.790
right when things really went bad in Europe,
so this became a refuge for all the, mainly

00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:35.190
Jewish scientists fleeing Germany who were
given refuge here.

00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:39.640
I mean, it was incredible stupidity on the
part of the Germans to kick out the smartest

00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:47.880
people who, who were largely given refuge
by Oswald Veblen who American but saw what

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:52.490
was happening and set up a community to aide
refugee scientists and broke all the rules

00:22:52.490 --> 00:22:59.861
like you guys probably do with H1 visas to
get these people in despite, forget that at

00:22:59.861 --> 00:23:03.760
that time Princeton University had a quota
against Jewish faculty and Jewish students

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:07.309
so the Institute played a very strong role.

00:23:07.309 --> 00:23:13.080
Thatís Norbert Wiener who sort of coined
the word, or took the word from Ampere but

00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:17.130
then re coined the word cybernetics.

00:23:17.130 --> 00:23:23.350
Abraham Flexner who really, the Institute
was his idea and it was based on the concept

00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:30.000
of the usefulness of useless knowledge, that
if you just let people work on whatever they

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.510
want, theyíre gonna come up with useful things.

00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:33.300
I think, whatís the policy here, still 10%?

00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:34.940
Or is it 20?

00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:35.940
20, okay.

00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:37.760
So this was hundred percent.

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:45.960
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;George Dyson: Itís all, itís all [inaudible].

00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:50.870
And the founders, the people who put in the
money, they were sort of the [inaudible] family,

00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:55.410
the department store owners, the Bambergers
who believed in that this would further the

00:23:55.410 --> 00:24:00.170
cause of social justice which in a way maybe
it has if the computer actually did what they

00:24:00.170 --> 00:24:01.370
intended.

00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:09.430
The first six math professors including Einstein
and Herman Weyl as well as [Inaudible], Johnny

00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:14.631
Von Neumann and Oscar Morgenstern who together
formulated the modern version of game theory,

00:24:14.631 --> 00:24:18.290
theory of games and economic behavior.

00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:23.360
And Einstein and Gˆdel, Kurt Gˆdel the logician
who gets, in the standard histories gets no

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:25.260
credit, thereís no involvement with computing
at all.

00:24:25.260 --> 00:24:28.200
But actually his office was above von Neumann.

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:32.240
And I think in many ways the whole concept
of numerical addressing that you could address

00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:36.890
strings of bits, manipulate the numerical
addresses and then be manipulating the underlying

00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:41.450
streams is very similar to what Gˆdel did
in his, sort of, incompleteness proof.

00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:45.809
And I think he actually contributed more than
what we actually think.

00:24:45.809 --> 00:24:49.040
Johnny Von Neumann at age 11 with his cousin.

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:52.179
He loved weapons from the beginning.

00:24:52.179 --> 00:24:59.049
So here theyíre visiting an Austro-Hungarian
artillery gun emplacement in 1915 and heís

00:24:59.049 --> 00:25:02.929
the kid sitting on the barrel of the cannon.

00:25:02.929 --> 00:25:07.110
There at a wedding with his, uh, his cousinís
wedding.

00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:12.280
This stuff is all in it because so much of
understanding why this happened and how it

00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:16.741
happened is that, what was going on in Budapest
between World War I and World War II, why

00:25:16.741 --> 00:25:22.150
did all these, you know, why did Johnny Von
Neumann, Eugene Wigner, Leo Szilard, Edward

00:25:22.150 --> 00:25:28.410
Teller and Paul Erdos, they all came out of
the same group of people in Hungary and ended

00:25:28.410 --> 00:25:30.420
up here.

00:25:30.420 --> 00:25:34.470
So Von Neumann was at the position at the
University of Berlin but then he could see

00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:42.280
what was, he saw what was gonna happen and
left early, resigned his position, had a tremendous,

00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:45.660
you know, sense of humor.

00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:52.460
Thatís Princeton, thatís a cocktail party
in the 1930ís.So all these people are from

00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:53.460
Budapest.

00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:58.380
Thatís HP Robertson who at that time was
teaching quantum physics to Alan Turing, Alan

00:25:58.380 --> 00:26:04.620
Turing was his student and, you know, I was
there as a child, I donít ever remember meeting

00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:08.730
Johnny Von Neumann, he had left to go work
for the Atomic Energy Commission while I was

00:26:08.730 --> 00:26:09.800
still like two years old.

00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:16.590
But I remember a cocktail party of my momís
when I was stuck in a crib, I was very unhappy

00:26:16.590 --> 00:26:22.610
and a guy, a really cheerful mathematician
came in the room and talked to me and gave

00:26:22.610 --> 00:26:24.130
me a sip of his drink.

00:26:24.130 --> 00:26:27.460
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;George Dyson: And I like to think, you know,

00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:32.559
maybe that was, maybe that was my contact
with Von Neumann.

00:26:32.559 --> 00:26:37.080
And these guys had so much fun at Los Alamos,
I mean, these are theoretical mathematicians

00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:43.090
who never touched real hardware and then suddenly
theyíre allowed to play with high explosives

00:26:43.090 --> 00:26:44.390
in machine shops.

00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:49.100
Dick Feynman standing on the left in 1949,
the photo taken by Nick Metropolis who developed

00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:54.760
the Monte Carlo algorithm.

00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:58.360
So they were intoxicated, I mean once Los
Alamos was over they werenít gonna go back

00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:01.140
to teaching calculus or anything like that.

00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:05.410
They wanted, and the computer, that was the
next thing after.

00:27:05.410 --> 00:27:08.700
So, they all got involved in the ENIACs.

00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:13.570
The ENIAC which was oddly enough, it was what
we would now call a multiple core processor

00:27:13.570 --> 00:27:19.210
where there were 20 parallel processors working
together and then they rewired it to turn

00:27:19.210 --> 00:27:21.590
into more of a serial mode.

00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:27.230
But it started out as multiple core architecture.

00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:32.590
And von Neumann and his, the other engineers
put together this little book explaining how

00:27:32.590 --> 00:27:36.200
to build a better computer, things like an
adder that we take totally for granted, they

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:37.200
had to figure it out.

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:39.350
The memory, the input output.

00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:45.640
Vladimir Dvorkin another amazing character,
Russian emigre who escaped through the Russian

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:51.160
Arctic to America, you know, got a job in
New York and ended up bringing television

00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:54.990
to, heís really one of the two people that
brought television to American.

00:27:54.990 --> 00:28:01.240
And he and Von Neumann partnered together
so the origin is this project, like meeting

00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:06.470
number one is in Zworykinís office and thereís
you see the fifth person down is John Tooke,

00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:11.830
the statistician, the guy who gets tired of
saying binary digit and finally says, ìcome

00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:16.070
on, letís call them bits guys.î And then
we get bit.

00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:23.590
Bernetta Miller, no institution functions
without a secretary who keeps everything going

00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:31.190
and solves the problems and gets things done,
she was the fifth person in the United States

00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:34.730
to get a pilotís license and then her eyesight
started going bad so she ended up getting

00:28:34.730 --> 00:28:37.309
a job at the institute and ran things.

00:28:37.309 --> 00:28:42.990
So she did the hard work of keeping the computer
projects supplied and so on.

00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:49.640
And, uh, then Oppenheimer fired her because
she kinda, I think she knew too much.

00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:58.350
Acrivo Condopria Emmanuelise, Greek, so she
was 16 years old in Philadelphia, her father

00:28:58.350 --> 00:29:02.770
couldnít read or write English and her guidance
counselor told her she couldnít go to the

00:29:02.770 --> 00:29:09.160
college, there was no hope, but there was
this project if she moved to Pennsylvania

00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:14.620
maybe she could work on it, and it was ENIAC,
so she became the ENIAC project secretary

00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:19.480
and did such a good job that Herman Goldstein
and Johnny Von Neumann brought her to the

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:21.519
Institute at age 17.

00:29:21.519 --> 00:29:27.919
And if youíre around this evening Iím doing
a discussion at the computer history museum

00:29:27.919 --> 00:29:29.110
and sheís going to be there.

00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:34.490
Sheís one of the last persons left who really
is still, cause she was so young at the time,

00:29:34.490 --> 00:29:39.040
she lives in Los Angeles and sheís come up
for this tonight and then another thing in

00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:44.419
San Francisco tomorrow and thatís quite amazing,
that thereís still somebody left who, all

00:29:44.419 --> 00:29:49.929
those famous reports, establishing the architecture
of all the machines used them, sheís the

00:29:49.929 --> 00:29:53.100
person who typed those reports and got every
word right.

00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:54.220
And she proofread my book.

00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:57.360
It was just fantastic having her.

00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:03.549
So sheís a lot of fun, I mean, and she didnít
have her own computer until 2009, her daughter

00:30:03.549 --> 00:30:05.200
got her a Mac.

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:09.630
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;George Dyson: And some of the guys, Norman

00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:14.830
Phillips, doing weather predictions, so they
worked on a bunch of problems including Jerry

00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:19.929
Estrin whoís two of his daughters, one is
real principal in Cisco and Judy and Deborah

00:30:19.929 --> 00:30:25.280
Estrin and both very active in, you know,
whatís happened in the next generation of

00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:26.500
computing.

00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:33.120
This machine was built with the expectation
what Zworykin promised that RCA would build

00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:38.880
something called the Selectron, so this is
like you heard about how dinosaur, somewhere

00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:44.290
thereís a dinosaur, the first dinosaur that
has feathers and thatís the, the mythical

00:30:44.290 --> 00:30:46.059
transition from analog to digital.

00:30:46.059 --> 00:30:51.600
Thatís an analog vacuum tube with a 4,096
bit digital memory inside.

00:30:51.600 --> 00:31:00.160
A pure digital matrix and so itís the ancestor
of your USB stick but it never got built in

00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:04.640
time but they built a machine waiting for
these things to plug in and then they never

00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:08.610
materialized, so then they did the strange
hack with the cathode ray tubse.

00:31:08.610 --> 00:31:14.520
But the architecture is established for this
the next, I think largely the reason that

00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:21.400
we moved into the solid state age so fast
that when, you know, Fairchild and those people

00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:26.500
started coming up with, with solid state devices
and memory.

00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:29.960
The architecture had been expecting that from
the very beginning.

00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:34.039
Itíd been waiting for it for twenty or thirty
years so it just could plug right in.

00:31:34.039 --> 00:31:40.610
In fact, my new Mac here has a solid state
drive so itís actually a, itís a selectron

00:31:40.610 --> 00:31:41.610
machine.

00:31:41.610 --> 00:31:46.730
So in England, in Manchester, where a very
clever group of British people were also with,

00:31:46.730 --> 00:31:51.840
including Turing, were, they got a machine
running way before the people in Princeton,

00:31:51.840 --> 00:32:00.200
thatís Frederic C Williams and Tom Kilburn,
they did the work of getting these, using

00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:05.200
these spots of charge on the face of an oscilloscope
tube to work as memory and then the Princetonians

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:09.429
went over there and adopted and improved the
idea, they made it random access.

00:32:09.429 --> 00:32:13.560
So thatís one, itís a standard washer plus
an oscilloscope tube with an amplifier on

00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:14.560
top.

00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:18.690
So with the amplified the signal 30,000 times
and then if youíre lucky you can distinguish

00:32:18.690 --> 00:32:26.590
between a 0 and a 1 in this tiny time interval
of point 7 microseconds.

00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:31.690
Julian Bigelow was the engineer who built,
physically built the machine.

00:32:31.690 --> 00:32:33.070
I think itís an absolute work of art.

00:32:33.070 --> 00:32:40.240
I mean, itís built like a 40 cylinder diesel
engine with overhead valves intake, I mean,

00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:45.160
itís just essentially was an engine, it was
an engine for numbers and it, you know, thereís

00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:48.910
one bit each of 1,040 bit words in each cell.

00:32:48.910 --> 00:32:52.730
Itís just an absolutely brilliant design
as long as you know when it was working.

00:32:52.730 --> 00:32:57.470
And there it is, itís now, unfortunately,
was given to the Smithsonian but they donít

00:32:57.470 --> 00:32:58.470
even have it on display.

00:32:58.470 --> 00:33:02.400
Itís often one of closed warehouses in Maryland
or somewhere.

00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:04.870
[Pause]
&gt;&gt;George Dyson: It shouldnít be and I hope

00:33:04.870 --> 00:33:09.600
someone will, if I succeed in anything it
might be to get, you know it should be in

00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:12.590
a computer history museum right here, they
have space for it and itíd be the perfect

00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:15.060
place for it.

00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:20.280
Julian Bigelow, Herman Goldstein, Robert Oppenheimer
who we think was against the hydrogen bomb

00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:26.780
but was actually being quite supportive, Johnny
Von Neumann, all of the engineers that helped.

00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:32.980
A lot of women who did the coding, there was
no place for them to live so Bigelow, who

00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:38.390
would solve any problem, he went to upstate
New York, a place called Mineville and purchased

00:33:38.390 --> 00:33:45.070
these war surplus barracks and cut them in
half and brought them down to Princeton by

00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:46.070
rail.

00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:51.780
Thatís the first magnetic drive, so thatís
the ancestor of your hard disc.

00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:58.500
Itís magnetic recording wire around two bicycle
wheels and they got 90,000 bits per second

00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:01.110
input output outta that thing.

00:34:01.110 --> 00:34:06.000
And thatís what a 40 bit word looks like,
I mean, itís amazing how they, you know,

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:10.330
they were able to solve real problems with
sort of that, you know, that bad of digital

00:34:10.330 --> 00:34:11.330
representation.

00:34:11.330 --> 00:34:16.060
So, you know, theyíre trying to get analog
stuff to behave in a digital way.

00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:21.909
Thatís the very first prototype shift register,
is a, we think like shift registers been there

00:34:21.909 --> 00:34:27.619
forever, but it had, somebody had to, so they
went to about 7 different versions of shift

00:34:27.619 --> 00:34:34.080
registers before saying ,îThis is how itís
gonna be.î And now thatís how it is.

00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:37.099
Physical work was done by high school girls
and students.

00:34:37.099 --> 00:34:42.560
They were called wiremen, the people who had
to actually had to do the wiring and soldering.

00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:47.490
Thatís the wiring guide ran for the shift
register, itís really brilliantly designed.

00:34:47.490 --> 00:34:54.450
Jim Pomerantz with a pipe and Julian Bigelow
in the middle, Willis Ware whoís still alive

00:34:54.450 --> 00:35:03.369
who played a big role, went from the Princeton
to Rand and, uh, he was explaining computer

00:35:03.369 --> 00:35:05.280
architecture.

00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:09.001
The first flow diagram that Iíve been able
to find, maybe someday somebody with find

00:35:09.001 --> 00:35:16.150
another one, but this was 1947 theyíre doing
a Monte Carlo hydrogen bomb problem.

00:35:16.150 --> 00:35:21.490
And thatís Stan Ulam who really the Monte
Carlos sort of named after.

00:35:21.490 --> 00:35:28.160
He was a gambler, heís waiting, thatís the
weekly poker game at Los Alamos and thatís

00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:35.090
Nick Metropolis who we owe a huge debt to,
I mean, he, you know, one of the founding

00:35:35.090 --> 00:35:40.370
fathers of computer science whoís again,
not, never took a huge amount of credit for

00:35:40.370 --> 00:35:41.370
himself.

00:35:41.370 --> 00:35:48.780
Klara, Johnnyís second wife, who was the
champion figure skater of Hungary, national

00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:54.110
figure skating champion at age 14, paid no
attention in school but Johnny taught her

00:35:54.110 --> 00:35:55.599
to do the coding.

00:35:55.599 --> 00:36:03.970
Thatís their trip to Florida in his V8 Cadillac.

00:36:03.970 --> 00:36:09.070
And Stan Ulam and Francois who both, you know,
they both lost their entire families to the

00:36:09.070 --> 00:36:11.650
holocaust in Europe and escaped to the United
States.

00:36:11.650 --> 00:36:15.980
And you have to remember that when you try
and say, ìWhy were these people working on

00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:20.130
these terrible, terrible weapons?î They were
working on these terrible weapons because

00:36:20.130 --> 00:36:27.390
they believed we had to have the strongest
weapons on our side and also not publicly

00:36:27.390 --> 00:36:28.480
known.

00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:35.730
Thatís Nick Metropolisís Los Alamos badge,
now heís playing first game of computer chess

00:36:35.730 --> 00:36:38.500
against the MANIAC at Los Alamos.

00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:41.090
Notice itís a 6 by 6 chess board.

00:36:41.090 --> 00:36:44.290
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;George Dyson: So to make it simpler so they

00:36:44.290 --> 00:36:48.030
play without bishops and they called it anti-clerical
chess.

00:36:48.030 --> 00:36:52.680
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;George Dyson: And the moves are, the input

00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:58.460
output is still punch paper tape, so the machine
was called MANIAC for mathematical numerical

00:36:58.460 --> 00:37:00.660
integrated and computer.

00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:05.690
But back to Von Neumann, he had at Los Alamos
he worked closely with Klaus Fuchs and they

00:37:05.690 --> 00:37:09.820
were actually working on a hydrogen bomb design
and then it, Klaus Fuchs turned out to be

00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:13.090
this, he was the Russian spy, he was the Russian
plant.

00:37:13.090 --> 00:37:18.740
So Von Neumann knew more than he could say,
he really believed the Russians might be half

00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:21.890
way there and we had to catch up.

00:37:21.890 --> 00:37:25.570
So itís not to justify what, well it is to
justify what he did.

00:37:25.570 --> 00:37:31.940
So thereís Von Neumann at the Grand Canyon
and his mule is facing the opposite direction

00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:34.440
of everybody else.

00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:42.130
And Klara and Francois Ulam, Claire Ulam,
whoís still alive, Stan Ulam her dad who

00:37:42.130 --> 00:37:48.530
was from Poland, Johnny and the Ulamís, so
all these people let me into their basements

00:37:48.530 --> 00:37:51.220
and the Ulamís sort of filing cabinet.

00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:55.090
Thereís this beautiful drawing by George
Kamov with sort of the actors in the hydrogen

00:37:55.090 --> 00:37:56.590
bomb drama in 1951.

00:37:56.590 --> 00:38:03.540
Thatís Joseph Stalin with the bomb, Oppenheimer
looking like a saint, whether he was or not

00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:09.480
and Stan Ulam spitting, Edward Teller in the
middle and George Kamov pulling the tail of

00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:10.480
a cat.

00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:16.270
And those drawings are about they have some
significance as physics relating to the different

00:38:16.270 --> 00:38:19.390
approaches that were being taken to try and
solve the hydrogen bomb problem but nobody

00:38:19.390 --> 00:38:23.890
is left who can explain that to me, I donít
understand it.

00:38:23.890 --> 00:38:28.280
Von Neumann and Vera Von Braun the, you know,
the rocket pioneer from Germany.

00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:32.670
Lewis Fry Richardson, another thread of this
whole thing, a meteorologist in England who

00:38:32.670 --> 00:38:40.590
worked on a, during, coding the hydrodynamic
behavior of the atmosphere in a cellular model

00:38:40.590 --> 00:38:42.650
which is how we actually do it today.

00:38:42.650 --> 00:38:49.890
He said we would need 64,000 human computers
to exchange, do the partial differential equating

00:38:49.890 --> 00:38:54.870
as fast as the weather itself and thatís
about what really happened.

00:38:54.870 --> 00:38:58.230
And then he answered the artificial intelligence
questions, you know, ìDo we have artificial

00:38:58.230 --> 00:39:00.750
intelligence?î Yeah, sure we do, itís just
a question of how much.

00:39:00.750 --> 00:39:05.441
So this is a non-deterministic circuit, you
canít predict what states itís gonna be

00:39:05.441 --> 00:39:06.599
in.

00:39:06.599 --> 00:39:12.760
Illustrating the mind having the will thatís
capable of only two ideas, and thatís, again,

00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:14.810
what I think you guys are doing here at Google.

00:39:14.810 --> 00:39:21.250
Youíre just, youíre building an enormous
nondeterministic circuit that instead of the

00:39:21.250 --> 00:39:25.599
only capable of two ideas is capable of all
the ideas that people have ever had.

00:39:25.599 --> 00:39:30.040
And thatís, you know, thatís why the book
is called Turingís Cathedral.

00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:33.900
Thatís the expedition to do the, thatís
the first day they actually knew they got

00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:41.320
a 24 hour weather prediction in less than
24 hours of processing time.

00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:46.109
And then it went very fast, if you look at
what they did, weíre just about at the end,

00:39:46.109 --> 00:39:51.610
in this 5 kilobytes of memory; they worked
on five big problems that were confrontationally

00:39:51.610 --> 00:39:55.890
kind of similar but across completely different
scales of time.

00:39:55.890 --> 00:40:00.440
So they worked on the questions of nuclear
explosions where everything is over in nanoseconds,

00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:02.170
thatís it.

00:40:02.170 --> 00:40:07.770
And youíve got the answer, it may take weeks
to get it, but the phenomena itself is very

00:40:07.770 --> 00:40:08.770
short.

00:40:08.770 --> 00:40:13.290
Von Neumann was extremely interested in shock
waves which are on the time scale of seconds

00:40:13.290 --> 00:40:16.310
to maybe minutes but a short period of time.

00:40:16.310 --> 00:40:21.290
And then they looked at meteorology, which
is over periods of hours, days and weeks.

00:40:21.290 --> 00:40:24.400
If itís months then it sort of become climate.

00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:29.980
And Nils Barricelli showed up to work on biological
evolution over periods of centuries, thousands

00:40:29.980 --> 00:40:36.341
of years, and another German refugee, Martin
Schwarzschild showed up and did a huge number

00:40:36.341 --> 00:40:40.849
of stellar evolution codes, looking at the
evolution of stars over billions of years.

00:40:40.849 --> 00:40:47.330
So itís five problems that span, sort of,
entire span of time in five kilobytes, quite

00:40:47.330 --> 00:40:48.330
amazing.

00:40:48.330 --> 00:40:51.590
These are all five problems that are still
big problems today.

00:40:51.590 --> 00:40:56.820
In the middle is the scales in seconds, so
you got 26 rows of magnitude from 10 to minus

00:40:56.820 --> 00:40:59.400
8 to 10 to the 17th seconds.

00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:05.030
If you look, you know, what is humanely perceivable
you have a blink of an eye, a third of a second

00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:07.250
to a 90 year life span.

00:41:07.250 --> 00:41:13.330
And in the exact middle is one day, sort of
one, you know, one 8 hour day at work is like

00:41:13.330 --> 00:41:19.230
the middle of the perceivable universe and
that Iím still, Iím puzzled by this.

00:41:19.230 --> 00:41:23.300
I donít know if itís because weíre observers
in the middle thatís always gonna be symmetrical.

00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:26.780
But why, you know why are we in the middle
of that time scale?

00:41:26.780 --> 00:41:30.280
And what computers have done, they have expanded
our perception.

00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:36.700
Weíve gone from the blink of an eye being
the shortest interval to, you know, we measure

00:41:36.700 --> 00:41:38.060
our memory in nanoseconds.

00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:42.040
So computers have just expanded our range
in all directions.

00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:49.880
And the fast side gets all the attention cause
you need fast computers to, you know, to build

00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:54.130
bombs, to beat the other guy in high frequency
trading and that kind of thing.

00:41:54.130 --> 00:41:56.420
But the long term scale, I think, is equally
important.

00:41:56.420 --> 00:42:02.160
In the long term it may be just as important
to the survival of our species and civilization

00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:08.770
and even life on earth that we have computers
that, you know, monitor climate of hundreds

00:42:08.770 --> 00:42:14.140
of years and make long term decisions that
we as human beings might not make for ourselves.

00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:18.450
So von Neumann was very interested in life
and biology, thereís Baricelli who thought

00:42:18.450 --> 00:42:19.760
totally in binary.

00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:24.040
They didnít have any, real operating systems,
no language no nothing.

00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:29.670
It was just straight, I mean most of the guys
worked at hexadecimal but he worked straight

00:42:29.670 --> 00:42:33.700
raw binary code so thatís one of his universes.

00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:39.270
Alan Turing in 1951 where he is now working
on building a commercial machine and he insisted

00:42:39.270 --> 00:42:44.530
that that commercial machine had to have a
source of nondeterministic electronic noise.

00:42:44.530 --> 00:42:50.361
The machine had to be able to guess, you know,
he didnít want a deterministic machine he

00:42:50.361 --> 00:42:53.460
wanted a machine that was capable of making
guesses and mistakes.

00:42:53.460 --> 00:42:59.360
Julian Bigelow who would be 100 years old
next year, soon as von Neumann died the Institute

00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:04.720
pulled the plug on the project so 12 oí clock
midnight July 15th 1958 thatís the last entry

00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:10.220
in the log book and it was so sad for, cause
Julian he had such a rapport with this machine,

00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:11.370
it was running fine.

00:43:11.370 --> 00:43:16.430
He had problems stacked up to work on but
they pulled the plug on him and it was over.

00:43:16.430 --> 00:43:22.490
In one of these basements, you know, I was
digging around there was a box that the surface

00:43:22.490 --> 00:43:28.030
of the box was World War II teleprinter manuals
that I should of just, you know, left it but

00:43:28.030 --> 00:43:32.660
I dug to the bottom of the box and the bottom
of the box was a box of punch cards with the

00:43:32.660 --> 00:43:41.560
entire, uh, source and output code for one
of Baricelliís digital numerical origin experiments.

00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:48.450
And on, in there was a note and the note from
the engineer to, you know, Mr. Baricelli,

00:43:48.450 --> 00:43:53.570
ìThere must be something about this code
that you havenít explained yet.î And when

00:43:53.570 --> 00:43:58.770
I found that sentence it was like, you know,
walking in here and finding the title I knew

00:43:58.770 --> 00:44:03.589
that, that was gonna be the last, those would
be the last words in the book because thatís

00:44:03.589 --> 00:44:09.770
what Turing came to this problem the beginning
from and was trying to answer a very abstract

00:44:09.770 --> 00:44:13.530
mathematical problem called the Entscheidungs
Problem, the decision problem of whether by

00:44:13.530 --> 00:44:20.280
looking at any string of code can you predict
whether it is a provable formula or not.

00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:26.660
And the answer is no and he got to that answer
by inventing what we called the Turing machine.

00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:32.359
It was a very sort of strange accident in
that doing this very abstract problem he helped

00:44:32.359 --> 00:44:34.690
to develop this very concrete technology.

00:44:34.690 --> 00:44:42.270
And the Entscheidungs Problem is still what
allows us to know that, and you guys know

00:44:42.270 --> 00:44:46.150
it all too well, that you canít tell by looking
at a code, you have to run the code to really

00:44:46.150 --> 00:44:47.380
know what itís gonna do.

00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:53.690
Thereís always gonna be strange unpredictable,
not just bugs, but thatís a very fundamental

00:44:53.690 --> 00:44:59.620
part of this world we live in that itís never
gonna be completely determined itís gonna

00:44:59.620 --> 00:45:05.260
always, thereís always gonna be some loudness
there, I think thatís important.

00:45:05.260 --> 00:45:10.580
And so it brings us back to what Leibniz imagined
in the beginning, this purely digital universe

00:45:10.580 --> 00:45:12.410
where everything was binary code.

00:45:12.410 --> 00:45:17.570
The last picture in the book is me, thatís
me, no thatís Esther sucking her thumb.

00:45:17.570 --> 00:45:18.570
[Laughter]

00:45:18.570 --> 00:45:24.339
&gt;&gt;George Dyson: In 1954, so Iím sort of here
as the, not the eyewitness, but to remind

00:45:24.339 --> 00:45:30.369
everybody where, you know, where this started
in these sort of very, uh, far thinking ideas

00:45:30.369 --> 00:45:31.369
and the people that started it.

00:45:31.369 --> 00:45:34.700
They werenít just trying to do one problem
they were trying solve all problems.

00:45:34.700 --> 00:45:41.390
And thanks to all the people who so generously
let me go through their stuff.

00:45:41.390 --> 00:45:42.390
And thatís it.

00:45:42.390 --> 00:45:45.650
We have time for a few questions.

00:45:45.650 --> 00:45:48.130
[Applause]

00:45:48.130 --> 00:45:55.970
&gt;&gt;presenter: Thanks again for an absolutely
fascinating talk and in depth history of this

00:45:55.970 --> 00:46:00.480
relatively mythical creation in time, um,
I was actually wondering you mentioned, you

00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:04.940
know, theyíve got these myths about the inventor
from electricity and the experiments with

00:46:04.940 --> 00:46:06.960
that and then the invention of the light bulb.

00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:13.230
How do you think some day that this story
will boil down to, you know, a very maybe

00:46:13.230 --> 00:46:17.460
metaphor, but a concept that even children
will be able to accept and embrace as far

00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:20.990
as the foundations and beginning of modern
computation?

00:46:20.990 --> 00:46:23.220
&gt;&gt;George Dyson: Yeah, thatís a good question.

00:46:23.220 --> 00:46:28.400
And itís such a problem because people always
want to assign it to one person, they want

00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:34.250
to say, ìThomas Edison invented the light
bulb.î Or ìBenjamin Franklin invented electricity.î

00:46:34.250 --> 00:46:39.010
We somehow, so I donít know how to, I mean,
thatís why I called the book Turingís Cathedral

00:46:39.010 --> 00:46:45.089
because Iím trying to give credit to Turing
for this very abstract idea but not say that

00:46:45.089 --> 00:46:49.710
so and so invented the computer.

00:46:49.710 --> 00:46:52.859
And there are books, I mean, if you look at
how many books there are on who invented the

00:46:52.859 --> 00:46:53.859
computer and the arguments.

00:46:53.859 --> 00:46:58.850
I donít know what weíre gonna arrive at
as a sort of cultural myth.

00:46:58.850 --> 00:47:06.150
I was trying to give a bigger picture of this
is a very group effort that brought us into

00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:10.900
a numerical universe in a way that, you know,
there was this very fundamental transition.

00:47:10.900 --> 00:47:14.040
Itís like we donít argue about who invented
the language, right?

00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:16.340
Nobodyís arguing, ìOh it was this guy.

00:47:16.340 --> 00:47:20.800
No it was his uncle that said the first sentence.î
We donít care, just itís something that

00:47:20.800 --> 00:47:26.550
happened but there are huge numbers of academic
scientists studying the evolution of language

00:47:26.550 --> 00:47:30.210
but we donít try to say that somebody invented
it.

00:47:30.210 --> 00:47:35.020
&gt;&gt; presenter: While we wait for any other
questions, I did have one other question.

00:47:35.020 --> 00:47:41.820
You said that there was a bit of pathetic
or a sense of transition from those two dimensional

00:47:41.820 --> 00:47:43.310
universe you described to a three dimensional.

00:47:43.310 --> 00:47:47.000
Can you give us a glimpse of that, obviously
I look forward to reading it in the book,

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:50.070
but any sense of what you mean by stepping
in to a three dimensional universe?

00:47:50.070 --> 00:47:51.070
&gt;&gt;George Dyson: Sure.

00:47:51.070 --> 00:47:52.070
I love to talk about the future.

00:47:52.070 --> 00:47:56.329
Iím a historian so Iím sort of licensed
to talk about the past not the future.

00:47:56.329 --> 00:48:01.400
But I think there is, sort of and this is
making a very simplified generalization, but

00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:06.280
the Turing model was one dimensional , the
on Neumann implementation was this, which

00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:10.890
still you know, if you have an IP address,
thatís a coordinate in a two dimensional

00:48:10.890 --> 00:48:11.890
space.

00:48:11.890 --> 00:48:14.840
Thatís why we have the at sign in the middle.

00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:20.320
And, but what the internet has done is give
us this more three dimensional world where

00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:24.240
machines can be connecting with the same data
at the same time.

00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:26.099
Itís no longer flat.

00:48:26.099 --> 00:48:31.349
So itís become three dimensional but we still
write most of our programs in a three dimensional

00:48:31.349 --> 00:48:32.349
way.

00:48:32.349 --> 00:48:36.119
I think the future and the exciting thing
about whatís going on here, companies like

00:48:36.119 --> 00:48:40.210
Facebook, all the companies that are doing
well, is that theyíre building new layers

00:48:40.210 --> 00:48:44.420
of very different kinds of computation on
top of that, weíre not gonna replace the

00:48:44.420 --> 00:48:46.720
von Neumann sub street itís like DNA, itís
there.

00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:51.839
We can do other things on top of it and a
lot of whatís being done, and itís an almost

00:48:51.839 --> 00:48:56.700
unmentionable word to say, but a lot of what
you guys are doing is analog computation.

00:48:56.700 --> 00:49:01.250
And, I mean, if you look at the Facebook problem,
you got a small high school, everybodyís

00:49:01.250 --> 00:49:07.680
changing girlfriends and boyfriends every
weekend, you cannot digitally code that, itís

00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:09.859
just too incomprehensibly complex.

00:49:09.859 --> 00:49:17.000
But if you get everybody a little piece of
code and let them connect on Facebook the

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:20.770
map becomes a, you know it becomes a model
of itself.

00:49:20.770 --> 00:49:22.660
And thatís analog computing.

00:49:22.660 --> 00:49:27.599
Where the complexity is not in the code but
in the connections between the code and thatís

00:49:27.599 --> 00:49:31.580
a lot of how Google works because, you know,
youíre finding the links.

00:49:31.580 --> 00:49:35.260
Itís topology not digital sequence.

00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:37.119
Thatís good.

00:49:37.119 --> 00:49:41.720
&gt;&gt;male #1: So youíve already made a liar
of me.

00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:46.540
I came here today planning to ask you how
come Leibniz and Gˆdel always fall out of

00:49:46.540 --> 00:49:47.540
these discussions.

00:49:47.540 --> 00:49:49.930
Why are they never made part of the story?

00:49:49.930 --> 00:49:52.120
&gt;&gt;George Dyson: Oh I think it all goes back
to Leibniz.

00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:58.109
&gt;&gt; male #1: But it all goes back to Leibniz
and Gˆdel clearly, um, he was asking the

00:49:58.109 --> 00:49:59.109
questions.

00:49:59.109 --> 00:50:07.170
I think thereís a subtlety that maybe people
asking questions in analog domain itís not

00:50:07.170 --> 00:50:12.540
obvious, to those of us in computing, that
these things map across into the digital make.

00:50:12.540 --> 00:50:18.089
But, I was wondering, you know, this; Iím
trying to ask you something about the historical

00:50:18.089 --> 00:50:19.880
process I think.

00:50:19.880 --> 00:50:25.320
How is it that these great antecedents, the
people that pose the questions, donít get

00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:27.020
a very large slice of the credit themselves?

00:50:27.020 --> 00:50:28.780
&gt;&gt;George Dyson: I donít know.

00:50:28.780 --> 00:50:31.190
I mean thatís the mystery of history.

00:50:31.190 --> 00:50:35.020
And you can probably tell I like, I enjoy
sort of finding the people like Baricelli

00:50:35.020 --> 00:50:41.070
who were completely ignored, you know, and
bringing them back to life.

00:50:41.070 --> 00:50:45.540
And the same with Gˆdel, I think if youíre
looking for early computer plans and Gˆdelís

00:50:45.540 --> 00:50:53.440
1931 proof is in many ways, itís a program,
itís a, itís quite amazing how much, and

00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:56.930
the funny thing is that he was just sitting
there with all this going on around him and

00:50:56.930 --> 00:50:57.930
he didnít

00:50:57.930 --> 00:51:02.620
&gt;&gt;male #1: But the point of amusement that
was when I was studying mathematics and the

00:51:02.620 --> 00:51:06.960
assignment was like, go and reconstruct that
proof, it turned out the easiest method I

00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:10.880
had to do was to write a LISP interpreter
in arithmetic.

00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:11.950
And then everything followed.

00:51:11.950 --> 00:51:13.510
&gt;&gt;George Dyson: Yeah.

00:51:13.510 --> 00:51:17.720
Thatís a very good question and Iím glad
I saved myself from me.

00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:18.720
[Laughs]

00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:22.170
&gt;&gt;presenter: Well, again, just make sure we
have a little bit of time left for book signing

00:51:22.170 --> 00:51:24.640
and again make sure you talk to the book [inaudible]
people in the back.

00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:26.740
Letís give one more round of applause for
George Dyson.

00:51:26.740 --> 00:51:26.950
[Applause]
