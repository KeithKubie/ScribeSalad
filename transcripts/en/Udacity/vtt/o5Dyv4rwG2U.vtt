00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.485
&gt;&gt; Alright Charles, what, you said you had

00:00:02.485 --> 00:00:04.575
the answer how do we figure it out?

00:00:04.575 --> 00:00:05.603
&gt;&gt; It's 1 6th.

00:00:05.603 --> 00:00:10.360
&gt;&gt; I guess that's what, which, we don't, I don't know if it will accept that,

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:16.079
whatever 1 6th is expressed as a decimal, but yes 1 6th. How did you get that?

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:17.590
&gt;&gt; I saw the number six and figured it had to

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:19.510
be 1 6th because you said it was low, but here is

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.250
what actually I did, well, I was thinking about it is, you

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.190
said, well when are they equally good? Well, if you always defect,

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:28.070
you get minus 6 gamma over 1 minus

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.470
gamma. And if you always cooperate, you get minus

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.440
1 over minus 1 minus gamma, so they're

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.990
equally good when those two values are the same.

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.610
&gt;&gt; Good, alright, and the denominators are the

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.940
same, as long as gamma's not one, that's fine.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:42.270
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.970
&gt;&gt; If we divide by the negative 6, we get gamma equals 1 6th.

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:45.660
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.020
&gt;&gt; Excellent. So, so that's interesting, right? So,

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.310
that's, it's saying that for gamma values that are

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.590
less than 1 6th, we should be doi, we should just defect because there's

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.750
no. Well the games not going to last long enough for us to form any

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.200
kind of coalition. But for things higher than 1 6th. A half. 3 quarters.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.170
0.999. It's going to be better to cooperate than to defect against tit for tat.

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:07.490
&gt;&gt; Or 6 plus epsilon.

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:08.460
&gt;&gt; Indeed.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.280
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I like that. That's actually very cool.
