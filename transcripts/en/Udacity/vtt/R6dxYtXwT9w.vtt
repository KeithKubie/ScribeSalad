00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.410
When I Google search ORM for
Python I get over 14

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:06.670
million results with several
different ORM options we could use.

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.320
The first result that showed
up when I searched was for

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.910
an application called SQL Alchemy.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.820
SQL Alchemy is an open source ORM for
Python with a slew of features.

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.300
Not to mention this awesome
Getting Started tutorial.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.230
There's a lot of
information on this page.

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.610
But let's just focus on setting up
our database and tables for now.

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.480
If you're using the Vagrantfile,

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.620
SQLAlchemy is already installed
on your virtual machine.

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.050
If you are not using Vagrant,

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.970
you can install SQLAlchemy from
the link below to follow along.
