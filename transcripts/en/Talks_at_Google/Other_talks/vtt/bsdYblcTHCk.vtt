00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:04.310
MALE SPEAKER: Thanks,
everybody, for joining us

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:05.760
at "Talks at Google."

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.140
Today's guest, I'm very
proud to introduce.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.940
Alexis, don't call him
Alex, Ohanian, who has just

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.970
published this book, which
you can all get here,

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.380
and you should all read.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.550
I had the great opportunity
to read it before it came out,

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.110
and I enjoyed it immensely.

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.800
I am surprised to see,
however, that we don't believe

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.190
in putting the title
on the cover anymore,

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:31.160
so it's on the back.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.160
ALEXIS OHANIAN: Who needs
to go with convention?

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.960
MALE SPEAKER: Without
their permission.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.044
So thanks very much, Alexis,
for joining us today.

00:00:38.044 --> 00:00:39.710
ALEXIS OHANIAN: Thank
you for having me.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.080
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.800
MALE SPEAKER: So not to give
away too much of the book,

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.850
but I just wanted to
start by asking you

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.390
a little bit about a story
that happens early in the book

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.300
that I really enjoyed, which
is apparently, when you were

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.660
a teenager, you started
out in a CompUSA

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.520
pitching software demos to
basically an empty store

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.370
for hours at a time.

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.099
So tell me a little
bit about that,

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:09.000
and how you think it might have
actually surprisingly prepared

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.940
you for what came after?

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.290
ALEXIS OHANIAN: Well,
I was a teenager

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.771
when a buddy of mine Jacob--
shout out, Jacob Winthrop,

00:01:15.771 --> 00:01:17.770
was like, hey dude, one
of my childhood friends,

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.980
you want a job demoing
software at a CompUSA?

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.244
And I was like, sure.

00:01:22.244 --> 00:01:23.910
I don't know what
that entails, but it's

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:25.470
going to pay me
like, $10 an hour.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.280
And I'm like, hell, yes.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.317
So I show up, and
on my first day,

00:01:29.317 --> 00:01:30.650
he puts me in this little booth.

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.326
Actually, you guys
remember what a CompUSA is?

00:01:33.326 --> 00:01:35.634
There are probably a lot
of you who have no idea.

00:01:35.634 --> 00:01:37.800
It was this amazing store
where you could go and buy

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.194
all your computer-related needs.

00:01:39.194 --> 00:01:40.610
And they put me
in a little booth.

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.330
And it was this company
called [? Sydea ?], which

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.700
was one of the many corpses
from the first tech boom.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.300
But at the time, they were
paying us this absurd amount

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.480
of money, $10 an hour, to
basically every 30 minutes,

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.614
do the same pitch, the
same like, 10 minute pitch,

00:01:55.614 --> 00:01:57.780
of whatever software or
hardware we had at the time.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.350
So it'd be like, look
at this amazing mouse.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.431
It is a great mouse.

00:02:02.431 --> 00:02:03.930
I remember we played
this one, there

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.789
was a Madelaine math--
I think it was a game.

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:09.330
It was one of those point and
click adventure games for kids.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.472
And I practically learned French
at the end of those two months,

00:02:12.472 --> 00:02:14.930
because we'd be playing the
same thing over and over again.

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.620
But all that's to say for
like, a chubby teenager

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.930
to get up in front of an
audience every 30 minutes

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.327
and literally have the worst
experience a public speaker

00:02:25.327 --> 00:02:27.160
could have, which is
everyone ignoring you--

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.409
MALE SPEAKER: Like, worse
than being a stand-up comic.

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:30.530
ALEXIS OHANIAN: Right.

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.420
You were basically
annoying people

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:34.712
who were just trying to shop.

00:02:34.712 --> 00:02:36.795
And they're always looking
over like, god, really?

00:02:36.795 --> 00:02:38.377
You just did this
30 minutes ago.

00:02:38.377 --> 00:02:40.960
MALE SPEAKER: You were like, the
pre-internet version of spam.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:41.540
ALEXIS OHANIAN: I was a spammer.

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:42.360
Yeah.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.600
I mean, I was, I would
say a step probably

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.365
below the dudes who
are always handing out

00:02:47.365 --> 00:02:49.380
flyers on New York
street corners.

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.459
And I had my little
megaphone and my headset,

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:52.500
and just demoed software.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.470
But it was-- and you
actually put this

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:55.860
very well as we were talking.

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.550
I guess it was like,
my 10,000 hours

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.330
moment with public speaking.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.520
And it was a great way--
I mean, it's all practice.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.340
Look, anyone you see
up there who's like,

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.590
an amazing public speaker,
even a good public speaker,

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:06.714
they weren't born that way.

00:03:06.714 --> 00:03:09.070
They just spend a
lot of time doing it.

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.140
And it's shocking how
terrified people are of it.

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.000
But you all need jobs
at doomed companies

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.670
to just get over it
for a couple years.

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.632
MALE SPEAKER: Now, now, now.

00:03:19.632 --> 00:03:21.840
You're not making any
predictions about Google there?

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.215
ALEXIS OHANIAN:
I don't think you

00:03:23.215 --> 00:03:25.190
guys have to worry
too much about Google.

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.480
You guys actually, you
wouldn't show me the room,

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.740
but there is a room that
literally prints money here.

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:31.050
I'm not allowed to see it.

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.440
MALE SPEAKER: Shh.

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.080
ALEXIS OHANIAN: Not
allowed to see it.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.307
But I know that.

00:03:33.307 --> 00:03:34.890
MALE SPEAKER: That's
a Google X thing.

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:35.580
We don't talk about that.

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:36.020
ALEXIS OHANIAN: I see.

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.887
All right.

00:03:36.887 --> 00:03:38.470
MALE SPEAKER: So
speaking of companies

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.670
that were not doomed, another
big section of the book

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.940
is about Reddit,
which of course, you

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.810
were one of the founders of.

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.370
And it's really striking
to me in reading the book,

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:49.310
you tell the story.

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:50.685
And of course,
you tell the story

00:03:50.685 --> 00:03:53.590
about how your Y
Combinator experience was

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.270
really pivotal to that.

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.270
But the Y Combinator
connection comes back

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.620
in almost every chapter
of the book that follows.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.700
I'm sort of curious,
one, what do

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.190
you think about that
community and its value,

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.400
not just to your company, but
to the startup scene in general?

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.110
And then maybe a
harder question.

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:15.207
If that pitch at Y Combinator
had not worked out,

00:04:15.207 --> 00:04:16.790
what do you think
would have happened?

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:17.623
ALEXIS OHANIAN: Wow.

00:04:17.623 --> 00:04:18.149
OK.

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:19.000
Well.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.395
So first and foremost,
Steve and I--

00:04:21.395 --> 00:04:22.770
I got to give you
the full thing.

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.820
Like, Steve and I
were seniors at UVA.

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.291
And I had talked
to him-- basically,

00:04:27.291 --> 00:04:28.790
I had an epiphany
at a Waffle House.

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:30.581
Realized that I didn't
want to be a lawyer.

00:04:30.581 --> 00:04:31.200
Sorry.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.600
I just--

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.980
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:36.520
ALEXIS OHANIAN:
And thankfully, I

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.540
realized I wanted to just live
like a college student working

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:40.229
on fun projects.

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:41.770
And I had this friend
of mine, Steve,

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:43.150
who was a talented engineer.

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:44.500
We had talked about
stuff for long enough.

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.333
Anyway, I convinced him
to work on a company

00:04:46.333 --> 00:04:49.850
with me called My
Mobile Menu, or MMM.

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:51.210
That was the name for it.

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:52.110
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHING].

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:53.860
ALEXIS OHANIAN: I can
never tell if that's

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.570
a good response,
like great idea,

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:57.635
or that was a stupid name.

00:04:57.635 --> 00:04:59.010
But anyway, I
convinced him to do

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:01.134
this instead of taking a
job at a software company.

00:05:01.134 --> 00:05:04.100
And during our senior
year, his girlfriend

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.821
saw an article somewhere
on the interwebs

00:05:06.821 --> 00:05:08.320
about a guy named
Paul Graham giving

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.780
a talk on how to
start a startup.

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.000
And he was up in Boston.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.020
And it was during our
senior year spring break.

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.450
So of course, we went to Boston
instead of going to a beach,

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.110
because laptops suck on beaches.

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:20.360
There's not a lot to do there.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.276
A lot of screen glare.

00:05:21.276 --> 00:05:22.360
It's just not fun.

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.450
MALE SPEAKER: Sand.

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:25.450
ALEXIS OHANIAN: And we
heard him give this talk.

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:26.830
There's rarely WiFi.

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:28.120
It's not fun.

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.890
And we heard Paul
give this talk.

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:32.316
And we lucked out.

00:05:32.316 --> 00:05:34.440
Steve approached him
afterward to get an autograph.

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:35.700
And I followed and
said, it'd totally

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:37.360
be worth the cost of
buying you a drink

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:38.401
to pitch you on our idea.

00:05:38.401 --> 00:05:39.600
We came from Virginia.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:40.610
Like, hear us out.

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:41.977
And he was shocked.

00:05:41.977 --> 00:05:44.310
Shocked that, I guess, we
came all the way from Virginia

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.340
to Boston, and said OK.

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:47.880
And one thing leads to another.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.000
A few weeks later, he
announces Y Combinator.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.330
He had given us really
good feedback on MMM.

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:56.310
And we applied and
had a great interview,

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.150
and then got rejected.

00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:59.450
And then got drunk.

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:01.395
And the next morning,
he called back--

00:06:01.395 --> 00:06:03.520
MALE SPEAKER: It's good
that it went in that order.

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:04.911
ALEXIS OHANIAN: Right.

00:06:04.911 --> 00:06:06.410
We would have known
the exact reason

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:08.826
why wed gotten rejected if we
had just gotten drunk first.

00:06:08.826 --> 00:06:12.330
It would have made the
interview more fun, but it hurt.

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:13.317
It hurt.

00:06:13.317 --> 00:06:15.400
And they called us back
the next morning and said,

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:16.290
we don't like your idea.

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:16.970
It's too early.

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:19.090
2005, right, the smartest
phone on the market

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:21.704
was a Treo with a stylus.

00:06:21.704 --> 00:06:22.620
Remember those things?

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.470
And like, BlackBerry
was still a company.

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:27.412
And I guess Palm was
still a company too.

00:06:27.412 --> 00:06:28.870
MALE SPEAKER: What,
no love Newton?

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:29.020
Come on.

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:30.900
ALEXIS OHANIAN: Anyway,
it was too early.

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:31.840
Aw.

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.470
Another wonderful product.

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:36.393
But like, it was
ahead of its time.

00:06:36.393 --> 00:06:38.520
And we lucked out,
because he calls up.

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:39.550
And I'm like, hello?

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:42.680
And Paul says, listen, we'll
let you do Y Combinator.

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:43.940
Just come up with a new idea.

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:45.010
Do something on the web.

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:46.180
Mobile's too early.

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:47.300
So we come back up there.

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:48.766
We speak with Paul for an hour.

00:06:48.766 --> 00:06:50.640
He asked what our problems
are every morning.

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:52.545
And we say, a bunch
of things, including

00:06:52.545 --> 00:06:54.420
how to find out what's
going on in the world.

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:56.294
And Steve have loved
Slashdot for many years.

00:06:56.294 --> 00:06:59.437
I was just reading a bunch
of news sites in my browser

00:06:59.437 --> 00:07:00.020
every morning.

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:03.750
And that became what
would become Reddit.

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:08.520
And so, all that's to say Y
Combinator changed our lives.

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:12.040
Even after the success we had
with Reddit, for Steve and Adam

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.520
and me to some
extent, it was a no

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:16.250
brainer to do Y
Combinator with Hipmunk.

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:19.459
And look, that's not to say
there's obviously-- everyone

00:07:19.459 --> 00:07:21.250
knows about this sort
of Y Combinator mafia

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:22.227
in that network.

00:07:22.227 --> 00:07:23.810
We don't do anything
illegal, but it's

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:26.540
that very strong
network among founders.

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:28.780
If nothing else, I
think it is great

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:34.920
because it has helped people
really appreciate how-- they

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:37.710
were the first ones to really
show, if you invest less

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:39.810
money than it costs
to get a Ford Focus,

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:43.710
you can have a billion dollar
company within a few years.

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:46.749
I mean look, no matter how
you feel about Y Combinator,

00:07:46.749 --> 00:07:48.540
I think part of reason
it's been so special

00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:51.150
is they genuinely care
about founders doing right

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:52.380
by their founders.

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:55.370
And I think that more broadly
helps the greater ecosystem,

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:58.360
because now investors
can't get away

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:01.760
with being jerks in the way that
they used to even 10 years ago.

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:04.400
That founder friendliness
has a ripple effect.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.840
And so, yes, it's influenced.

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:09.090
I'm very appreciative,
because it's made me who I am.

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:13.252
And the reality is, if we
hadn't gotten that call back,

00:08:13.252 --> 00:08:14.710
we would have gone
back to Virginia

00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:17.280
and tried to prove
Paul and Jessica wrong.

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:20.885
We would have showed them MMM
is going to take over the world.

00:08:20.885 --> 00:08:23.260
We probably would've stayed
in Charlottesville, Virginia,

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.900
which is a great college town,
but not the biggest market.

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:27.920
And we probably
would have languished

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.700
for a few years trying to figure
out what was going to happen.

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:32.575
Maybe we would have
gotten lucky with the app

00:08:32.575 --> 00:08:33.980
store finally coming online.

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:34.770
Who knows?

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:38.740
MALE SPEAKER: All I know is
all the college kids at UVA,

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:41.539
they could have had a great
mobile ordering service.

00:08:41.539 --> 00:08:42.220
And you just--

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:43.220
ALEXIS OHANIAN: If only.

00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:44.520
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah,
it's very disappointing.

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:45.100
It's very disappointing.

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:45.980
ALEXIS OHANIAN:
We abandoned them.

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:47.990
But what is so cool
now is there are so

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:50.132
many companies that
are doing this.

00:08:50.132 --> 00:08:51.590
And someone's going
to win the day,

00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:54.090
and then we'll never have to
wait in line for a frappuccino.

00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:55.022
So there's that.

00:08:55.022 --> 00:08:55.730
MALE SPEAKER: So!

00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:57.540
One other thing that
comes through to me

00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:01.440
as I'm reading the book about,
obviously, you start Reddit,

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:03.080
and then you guys go
on and do Hipmunk,

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:05.840
and you've done a whole bunch
of other great startup-related

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:08.570
ideas, and supported a
lot of other startups,

00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:11.680
you're not a technical person,
sort of by your own admission

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:12.220
in the book.

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:15.975
You were not the coding
chops behind Reddit.

00:09:15.975 --> 00:09:16.850
ALEXIS OHANIAN: Nope.

00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:19.266
MALE SPEAKER: And you haven't
been the coding chops behind

00:09:19.266 --> 00:09:21.655
any of these other startups
that you've-- so, I'm sort

00:09:21.655 --> 00:09:22.650
of curious.

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:26.080
A lot of people in this room
don't have that handicap.

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:27.190
God bless you.

00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:29.530
But for those of
us like myself, I

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:31.767
was a liberal arts
major undergrad,

00:09:31.767 --> 00:09:33.850
I'm sort of curious, what
are your thoughts about,

00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:37.080
is being a technical person
more and more necessary?

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:38.380
Less and less necessary?

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:42.570
Is it orthogonal to the whole
question of being in a startup?

00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:45.430
I'm really curious
about your prospective

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:49.379
in a world full of hardcore
coders, not being one.

00:09:49.379 --> 00:09:50.920
ALEXIS OHANIAN: You
know, the running

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:52.757
joke in that first
batch of Y Combinator--

00:09:52.757 --> 00:09:54.840
and this is back when it
was in Boston, all right,

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:57.390
but it was maybe a dozen
or so companies-- was,

00:09:57.390 --> 00:09:58.970
what does Alexis do?

00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:00.991
And they'd always ask
this about Steven.

00:10:00.991 --> 00:10:02.990
At some point, it was
clear they weren't joking.

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:04.840
They were genuinely concerned.

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:09.140
Because I think I was the only
non-technical person in YC.

00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:11.110
Maybe with one exception.

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:12.910
But also, YC's very biased.

00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:14.850
This whole tech
industry for startups

00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:16.767
is so biased towards
technical founders, which

00:10:16.767 --> 00:10:18.850
is why it's so important
to be able to write code.

00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:20.800
Because if you have an
idea, congratulations.

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:22.880
You are one of everyone.

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:24.840
Everyone has great ideas.

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:26.600
So it is more
important than ever.

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:32.020
And if I could do it all over
again, I don't want to brag,

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:36.200
but at Howard High School, I
was the best in my Pascal class.

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:38.750
I loved programming.

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:40.820
MALE SPEAKER: And you
knew how to pitch software

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:41.690
in 10 minutes.

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:42.390
ALEXIS OHANIAN: I
knew how to pitch.

00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:44.190
I had that going for me.

00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:47.280
And I was very proud of
my mascot doodles as well.

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:50.240
But at the end of the day, if
I could do it all over again,

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:52.793
I would've stuck with computer
science when I got to college.

00:10:52.793 --> 00:10:54.626
What happened was I met
Steve freshman year.

00:10:54.626 --> 00:10:56.120
He just lived across
the hall from me.

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:57.980
And I was so excited,
because here's another geek.

00:10:57.980 --> 00:10:59.104
He was playing video games.

00:10:59.104 --> 00:11:01.250
We were talking about
gaming PCs we had built.

00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:03.570
And at some point, he's like
I'm in engineering school.

00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:04.110
I do CS.

00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:05.651
And I was like, oh,
I think I'm going

00:11:05.651 --> 00:11:06.840
to be pre-med or something.

00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:07.670
That lasted a week.

00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:09.150
I ended up being
a history major.

00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:15.180
And it was clear
he was someone--

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:16.480
I feel guilty saying this.

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:18.271
But it was clear, he
was the kind of person

00:11:18.271 --> 00:11:22.114
who-- when a talented
or fairly talented

00:11:22.114 --> 00:11:24.530
high school athlete goes to
college and meet someone who's

00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:26.010
very clearly, you
just know, she's

00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:27.090
going to be in the
Olympics one day.

00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:29.350
And you think, well, I'm
probably going to ride the pine

00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:30.720
and have to figure out
something else to do.

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:32.150
I felt that way
when I met Steve.

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:33.750
Here was someone
who was clearly just

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:36.420
a brilliant technical mind.

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:37.920
He was going to go
off to do things.

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:38.850
And I was intimidated by it.

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:40.308
MALE SPEAKER: He
ruined it for you.

00:11:40.308 --> 00:11:42.200
You were like, I'm
not going to do that.

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:44.325
ALEXIS OHANIAN: And the
the first version of Reddit

00:11:44.325 --> 00:11:45.100
was in LISP-2.

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:49.450
And he spent a sad 48 hours
trying to work with me.

00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:52.370
I was trying to learn
LISP for about 48 hours.

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:55.330
I still have a photo
of that journal entry

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:59.180
where I just said, this
hurts, dot, dot, dot.

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:01.180
That was not fun.

00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:02.720
I still can't look
at a parenthesis

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:04.930
without like, shaking
a little to this day.

00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:06.800
MALE SPEAKER: I think you're
selling yourself a little bit

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:07.330
short.

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:09.663
Because I think a lot of what
you talk about in the book

00:12:09.663 --> 00:12:12.890
is the importance of
figuring out what users want,

00:12:12.890 --> 00:12:15.390
and really paying attention,
being there, listening

00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:18.014
to their complaints,
answering them.

00:12:18.014 --> 00:12:20.430
And the truth of the matter
is I'm guessing Scott probably

00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:23.345
didn't have the time to do
as much of that as you did.

00:12:23.345 --> 00:12:24.220
ALEXIS OHANIAN: Yeah.

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:25.510
Steve was busy actually
building the site.

00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:26.676
MALE SPEAKER: Steve, rather.

00:12:26.676 --> 00:12:28.150
Sorry.

00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:29.420
ALEXIS OHANIAN: Yes.

00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:31.340
So what I tell non-technical
founders today?

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:32.487
One, learn how to code.

00:12:32.487 --> 00:12:33.820
You can get started right there.

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:35.230
The tutorials that
are available today

00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:36.688
versus even eight
years ago when we

00:12:36.688 --> 00:12:39.360
started Reddit are orders
of magnitude better.

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:42.650
But if you do manage to
convince a technical co-founder

00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:44.900
to work with you, be ego-less.

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:46.990
Be willing to do
anything, whether it's

00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:48.970
ordering the takeout,
dealing with the lawyers,

00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:50.530
negotiating the cell phone bill.

00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:52.000
Like, do everything else.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.480
Create and care so
much especially early

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:57.990
on about those few
users who are actually

00:12:57.990 --> 00:13:00.600
willing to try your new service
that no one has ever heard of,

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:03.189
that has a weird typo, and
care so much about them.

00:13:03.189 --> 00:13:04.480
Because those people are crazy.

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:06.104
Those people are
amazing and wonderful.

00:13:06.104 --> 00:13:07.974
And like, those are
the ones who are

00:13:07.974 --> 00:13:10.140
going to be those early
adopters, those evangelists.

00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:11.460
I mean, that's how we built
the audience at Reddit.

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:12.793
That's how we did it at Hipmunk.

00:13:12.793 --> 00:13:16.000
That's how I see non-technical
founders doing it all time.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.167
But really, I mean, I'm
preaching to the choir here.

00:13:18.167 --> 00:13:20.583
But developing and writing
code is the most valuable skill

00:13:20.583 --> 00:13:21.370
of the century.

00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:25.597
And like I said, if I could
do it all over again, I would.

00:13:25.597 --> 00:13:27.680
MALE SPEAKER: So in the
book after the acquisition

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:32.690
of Reddit, you did a whole bunch
of really interesting things

00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:36.470
that were not just about
making the next million

00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:37.850
dollars or whatnot.

00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:40.760
So say a little bit about that.

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:43.690
It struck me that a lot
of the stuff you did

00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:45.970
were much more
civic-minded than I

00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:53.580
think I'm used seeing-- usually
men who cash out from startups,

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:55.710
I don't see them doing the
kinds of things you did.

00:13:55.710 --> 00:14:01.000
And so I'm curious, what
put you on that path?

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.850
ALEXIS OHANIAN: Oh, wow.

00:14:02.850 --> 00:14:06.150
I should probably give
all the credit to my mom.

00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:07.220
I don't know.

00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:12.030
I mean, I think when you
have the fortune that I had

00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:14.800
of being a 23-year-old
millionaire,

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:18.360
you can go one of two ways.

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:20.801
At the end of the day, though,
what anchored me so much

00:14:20.801 --> 00:14:23.300
was having the relationship
that I had with both my parents,

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:27.440
but especially my mom,
that made me appreciate

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:29.552
what really mattered in life.

00:14:29.552 --> 00:14:31.010
And I won't go into
too much detail

00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:32.676
because it usually
makes me sad and cry.

00:14:32.676 --> 00:14:36.180
So instead, what I
will say abstractly

00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:39.200
is most 22,
23-year-olds, whatever,

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:44.470
they don't have the wisdom that
usually comes with age when you

00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:46.220
actually start questioning
your mortality,

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:47.380
and wondering what's
going to happen,

00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:50.080
and what you'll care about
when you're on your death bed.

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:53.650
As a 23-year-old, I
knew very, very well

00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:57.270
what people cared about
when they were facing death.

00:14:57.270 --> 00:15:01.125
And that something I
wish I could, trust me,

00:15:01.125 --> 00:15:02.870
I wish I could not
have had that happen.

00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:05.460
But the advantage was
it gave me a perspective

00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:08.390
that I think usually, we
aren't fortunate enough,

00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:10.500
I suppose is the word,
to get until much later.

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:15.939
So all that's to say, it was
easy because I knew that there

00:15:15.939 --> 00:15:17.480
were not going to
be-- I never wanted

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:19.800
to have things
that made me happy.

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:22.820
I wanted to have experiences
and actions and a legacy that

00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:23.960
made me happy.

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:26.239
And look, I think
altruism is selfish.

00:15:26.239 --> 00:15:27.030
Don't get me wrong.

00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:33.160
I'm not a monk here.

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:35.250
It is an opportunity
for us who have

00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:38.360
done so well to make sure
other people can too.

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:43.300
And look, I also say this, you
correctly identified my gender.

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:47.110
But it is also, as a
straight white dude,

00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:50.290
the way I like to describe it
is it's kind of like playing

00:15:50.290 --> 00:15:51.109
on easy mode.

00:15:51.109 --> 00:15:52.525
I played a lot of
video games too.

00:15:52.525 --> 00:15:54.710
MALE SPEAKER: No, really?

00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:56.640
ALEXIS OHANIAN:
That's not obvious.

00:15:56.640 --> 00:16:01.100
And I don't think it in any
way takes away from success

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:03.220
that I'm proud of that
I feel like I've earned.

00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:04.880
But it's an
admission of the fact

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:07.176
that it is just a
little easier for things

00:16:07.176 --> 00:16:08.300
that are not of my control.

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:11.950
Like, it's the way the
world is, unfortunately.

00:16:11.950 --> 00:16:16.070
But it makes me really
aware of the asterisk.

00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:19.000
This isn't like a Barry
Bonds kind of asterisk.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.430
But it is an asterisk
that points out

00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:26.170
that, yeah, I had advantages
other people don't have.

00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:28.880
And if I really believe in
the power of the internet,

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:32.274
it's for anyone with a
great idea to be awesome.

00:16:32.274 --> 00:16:33.440
That's why I wrote the book.

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:35.880
That's why I'm going on a
crazy 150 stop bus tour.

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:38.130
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, actually,
I was going to just ask.

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:39.671
Say a little bit
about that bus tour.

00:16:39.671 --> 00:16:44.420
Because I thought that
was-- for an the industry--

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:46.490
if you read the
tech press, I mean,

00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:50.700
I would love to do a study
of every company mentioned

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:52.730
on Tech mapped.

00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:54.510
And it would be very
interesting to see

00:16:54.510 --> 00:16:57.450
if there was anything
between the West Coast

00:16:57.450 --> 00:17:01.377
and the East Coast that is
ever mentioned on TechCrunch.

00:17:01.377 --> 00:17:02.710
I don't mean to single them out.

00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:04.680
It's true, I think,
of all the tech press.

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:08.660
What made you think, let's go
across the country in a bus?

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:10.930
ALEXIS OHANIAN: Well, I think
you're absolutely right.

00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:12.429
And you're talking
a guy, mind you--

00:17:12.429 --> 00:17:14.140
Reddit was not once
covered in TechCrunch

00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:15.849
until the day we got acquired.

00:17:15.849 --> 00:17:18.371
I mean, we're based out of
Somerville, Massachusetts.

00:17:18.371 --> 00:17:19.579
We're still in a startup hub.

00:17:19.579 --> 00:17:23.119
But there is very much,
most of the tech press

00:17:23.119 --> 00:17:27.079
stays to the Bay, New
York, Boston, the Coast.

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:28.830
And last year,
this pissed me off,

00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:31.870
because I kept hearing
Silicon Valley-- no offense,

00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:34.760
guys-- defeated Hollywood in the
battle against SOPA and PIPA.

00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:37.490
And it's like, yeah,
OK, you all showed up.

00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:39.017
But the whole country showed up.

00:17:39.017 --> 00:17:39.850
Millions of people--

00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:40.300
MALE SPEAKER: The whole world.

00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:42.094
ALEXIS OHANIAN: The
whole world, right?

00:17:42.094 --> 00:17:44.260
And so, I wanted to illustrate
this as best I could.

00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:46.802
And instead of just talking
about it, we crowd-funded a bus

00:17:46.802 --> 00:17:48.760
and drove it through the
Heartland for 10 days.

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:50.950
We visited Google
Fiber in Kansas City,

00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:53.050
and took a number
of other stops,

00:17:53.050 --> 00:17:56.560
and met with farmers, and
truckers, and startup founders,

00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:58.140
and students, and
all kinds of people

00:17:58.140 --> 00:17:59.890
who were using the
internet to be awesome.

00:17:59.890 --> 00:18:01.930
Whether it was starting
companies, running their family

00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:02.660
farms better.

00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:05.460
All that to really just
show off that it wasn't just

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:06.130
Silicon Valley.

00:18:06.130 --> 00:18:08.930
The internet economy is not
just a few zip codes here

00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:09.610
in California.

00:18:09.610 --> 00:18:11.177
It's the entire world.

00:18:11.177 --> 00:18:13.010
At least for our
politicians' consideration,

00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:14.430
it is the entire United States.

00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:16.310
Every one of their
constituents lives

00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:18.210
in like, a digital district.

00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:20.600
And so I thought, all
right, that was fun.

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:22.190
That was my beta test.

00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:27.270
Now let's do it for five months
and go to 75 universities.

00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:31.460
Because I basically want to
deliver the class or the talk

00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:34.035
that I wish I had had while
Steve and I were at UVA.

00:18:34.035 --> 00:18:34.910
We lucked out, right?

00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:38.040
We heard Paul Graham was giving
a talk in Boston up at Harvard.

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:39.080
We got up there.

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:41.622
But I want to deliver it.

00:18:41.622 --> 00:18:43.830
I'm excited, because we're
going to go to Ohio State.

00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:45.104
Arizona State, all right?

00:18:45.104 --> 00:18:47.520
I don't know how many Arizona
State alums are in the crowd

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:48.020
right now.

00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:48.650
Represent.

00:18:48.650 --> 00:18:49.150
All right?

00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:50.724
So Arizona State
has a reputation

00:18:50.724 --> 00:18:52.640
of being the school that
has a very good time.

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:54.870
Would that be accurate?

00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:56.480
When we announced
the tour, and we

00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:59.220
had all the obvious schools--
and I wanted to make sure

00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:00.660
we hit a number
of large schools.

00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:01.810
Not just the Ivies.

00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:02.410
I went to UVA.

00:19:02.410 --> 00:19:03.493
I went to a public school.

00:19:03.493 --> 00:19:05.930
But still, not just
the obvious candidates.

00:19:05.930 --> 00:19:07.020
Arizona State,

00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:10.260
I don't know what they did,
but that came out in droves.

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:12.012
There was a deluge
of emails and tweets

00:19:12.012 --> 00:19:13.220
from people at Arizona State.

00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:14.632
Undergrads and grads--

00:19:14.632 --> 00:19:16.090
MALE SPEAKER: They
heard about MMM,

00:19:16.090 --> 00:19:18.424
and they were all like,
we need more of that.

00:19:18.424 --> 00:19:19.340
ALEXIS OHANIAN: Maybe.

00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:20.715
I hope so.

00:19:20.715 --> 00:19:22.700
At the very least,
at the very least,

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:26.960
they were pissed off because
they care about this stuff.

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:29.110
They want that spirit
of entrepreneurship,

00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:30.700
because it is there in pockets.

00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:32.700
But they want someone to
come in really be like,

00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:35.330
yes, there's no reason
why you can't do this too.

00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:37.950
And it was great.

00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:40.450
And I have to admit, even I was
a little surprised at first.

00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:41.825
Then I was like,
shut up, Alexis.

00:19:41.825 --> 00:19:43.750
Stop being surprised.

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:47.240
If the thesis is true,
this is not just something

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:48.830
that kids at
Stanford care about.

00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:51.280
And obviously, it's easy to
just cherrypick and be like,

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:54.010
every kid from Stanford wants to
start her own startup one day.

00:19:54.010 --> 00:19:56.550
And that's probably
true, actually.

00:19:56.550 --> 00:19:57.830
But more power to them.

00:19:57.830 --> 00:20:00.280
But this is a nationwide, this
is a worldwide phenomenon.

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:02.780
And it's not just
starting companies.

00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:04.990
It's getting your first
film funded on Kickstarter.

00:20:04.990 --> 00:20:06.519
It's opening your
first Etsy store.

00:20:06.519 --> 00:20:09.060
It's using these platforms, even
if you're not building them.

00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:11.505
MALE SPEAKER: And have
you taken that message

00:20:11.505 --> 00:20:13.420
out to other countries as well?

00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:15.750
I imagine this is a message
that a lot of people

00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:16.630
are ready to hear.

00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:17.540
ALEXIS OHANIAN: Yes.

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:19.780
And it's been funny.

00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:23.280
Because of interesting--
I don't know how exactly

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:25.970
the world works with a
publishing and licensing

00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:26.670
internationally.

00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:28.537
There have been a
number of people abroad

00:20:28.537 --> 00:20:30.620
who have had trouble getting
the book because it's

00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:33.220
not technically
published there yet,

00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:36.860
even in digital form, which
is kind of a mind job.

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:39.680
So they found ways
to acquire the book

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:43.090
on the internet using things.

00:20:43.090 --> 00:20:43.740
Which is great.

00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:45.960
I'm happy the ideas spread.

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:49.860
And there has been a ton
of requests to go abroad.

00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:52.740
But I'll tell you, I feel like
I learn more from those things

00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:55.280
than I could possibly present.

00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:57.610
One of the stories that
had such a big impact on me

00:20:57.610 --> 00:21:02.350
was going to Egypt maybe a
month or so after Mubarak felt.

00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:04.450
And it was a tech
entrepreneurship conference.

00:21:04.450 --> 00:21:08.480
And here I am in Cairo talking
a few dozen entrepreneurs who

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:10.610
are literally revolutionaries.

00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:14.350
Like, they call founders
like me and David Karp, Larry

00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:15.580
and Sergey revolutionaries.

00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:16.300
That's bullshit.

00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:17.410
No offense to those guys.

00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:19.241
But like, we're not
revolutionaries.

00:21:19.241 --> 00:21:21.240
That's a great hyperbole
to throw in a magazine.

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:24.850
But like, these were people
who were actually trying

00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:27.520
to forge a new Egypt,
and in the process

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:30.690
were also starting companies,
and had the same ambitions.

00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:32.534
They ask the same
damn questions you

00:21:32.534 --> 00:21:34.700
get asked in Brooklyn from
a bunch of tech founders.

00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:37.230
It's obviously very
different starting a company

00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:41.340
in Egypt versus here for lots
of sort of macro reasons.

00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:42.795
But at a micro
level, they're just

00:21:42.795 --> 00:21:44.920
trying to make something
people want just the same.

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:48.950
And to see that same kind of
hustle is so inspirational,

00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:53.250
because I realize the life
lottery ticket that comes just

00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:55.920
from being born in the States
versus being born anywhere

00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:58.320
else, and how easy it is to
just open a laptop and get

00:21:58.320 --> 00:21:59.560
started on a business.

00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:00.950
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, absolutely.

00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:02.741
ALEXIS OHANIAN: So I
think it's a good time

00:22:02.741 --> 00:22:05.690
to get to the politics
part of our program today.

00:22:05.690 --> 00:22:09.190
Obviously, a chapter of your
book is about the SOPA/PIPA

00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:11.515
that you played and Redditors--

00:22:11.515 --> 00:22:12.640
ALEXIS OHANIAN: And Google.

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:13.980
Thank you, Google.

00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:15.920
MALE SPEAKER: We did our part.

00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:16.930
And Wikipedia.

00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:20.840
And all kinds of other
folks participated in it.

00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:21.460
I'm curious.

00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:23.790
What got you interested?

00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:26.751
What made it possible when
that happened for you to sort

00:22:26.751 --> 00:22:28.250
of say, hey, yeah,
this is something

00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:30.610
I want to try to
do something about?

00:22:30.610 --> 00:22:33.750
And do you think there
are any real lessons

00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:36.490
that you want to impart to
people about what you learned

00:22:36.490 --> 00:22:38.390
and what the internet
hopefully learned.

00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:39.390
ALEXIS OHANIAN: Oh, yes.

00:22:39.390 --> 00:22:40.470
So I fell into this.

00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:43.410
I had not been terribly
politically active before this.

00:22:43.410 --> 00:22:47.220
I mean, I voted, but I was
not by any means an activist,

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:50.109
or any way really that
passionate about it.

00:22:50.109 --> 00:22:51.650
And then I got an
email from a friend

00:22:51.650 --> 00:22:52.920
of mine, Christina [? Shi ?].

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:55.120
And she said, hey,
some friends of mine

00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:57.370
are working on this thing
called Fight for the Future,

00:22:57.370 --> 00:22:59.850
and they're really worried about
these two bills, SOPA and PIPA,

00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:01.340
and they may
actually become law.

00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:02.090
And I took a look.

00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:05.800
And I'm reading through
it, and I'm like, no, no.

00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:07.040
This is so stupid.

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:10.100
There is no way this
could actually become.

00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:12.694
And I start emailing, and
I realized very quickly

00:23:12.694 --> 00:23:14.610
that, no, actually, these
bills are considered

00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:17.349
to be inevitable,
inevitable, in Washington.

00:23:17.349 --> 00:23:18.140
They had Democrats.

00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:18.770
MALE SPEAKER: They were wired.

00:23:18.770 --> 00:23:19.200
ALEXIS OHANIAN: They
had Republicans.

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:20.210
It was done.

00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:21.110
The check was signed.

00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:21.640
MALE SPEAKER: It was
like, the Chamber

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:24.080
of Commerce and
the unions agreed.

00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:25.999
And they were like, well,
that never happened.

00:23:25.999 --> 00:23:26.915
ALEXIS OHANIAN: Right.

00:23:26.915 --> 00:23:28.081
Let's take advantage, right?

00:23:28.081 --> 00:23:30.450
This would be at a time
when, even back then,

00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:32.320
I know it's hard to
believe, government

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:33.505
was seemingly dysfunctional.

00:23:36.650 --> 00:23:37.310
Back then.

00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:37.440
MALE SPEAKER: Compared to what?

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:38.930
ALEXIS OHANIAN: Good thing
we got that one solved.

00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:39.810
MALE SPEAKER: Exactly.

00:23:39.810 --> 00:23:41.070
ALEXIS OHANIAN: But
this was something

00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:42.490
that was ostensibly bipartisan.

00:23:42.490 --> 00:23:42.989
It was.

00:23:42.989 --> 00:23:44.890
They had Democrats and
Republicans lining up.

00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:46.550
Hollywood, the
entertainment industry,

00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:48.380
had dropped about $94
million in lobbying.

00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:49.130
It was all finished.

00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:49.963
All going to happen.

00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:55.220
At the time, I was just
transitioning out of Hipmunk,

00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:58.570
and it was clear I'd be
a hypocrite if I didn't

00:23:58.570 --> 00:24:00.439
participate, because
Steve and I never

00:24:00.439 --> 00:24:02.980
would have been able to start
Reddit if either of those bills

00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:03.890
were law.

00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:06.360
And don't get me wrong.

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:09.120
I would've loved if
my peers at Facebook,

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:12.090
and Twitter, and everywhere
else were also joining in,

00:24:12.090 --> 00:24:13.100
but it's fine.

00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:13.690
It's fine.

00:24:13.690 --> 00:24:14.500
MALE SPEAKER: We were there.

00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:15.296
ALEXIS OHANIAN:
Yes, I know-- no, I

00:24:15.296 --> 00:24:17.160
know-- well, dude,
between Google,

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:19.370
and then the Wikipedia
blackout was the big one.

00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:23.290
Because that made it-- I was
ignored by even my friends who

00:24:23.290 --> 00:24:26.370
are producers in the media
up until Wikipedia went dark.

00:24:26.370 --> 00:24:28.195
Because then, top 10 website.

00:24:28.195 --> 00:24:29.820
Actually, I remember
checking Wikipedia

00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:31.472
at like, five minutes
past midnight,

00:24:31.472 --> 00:24:33.180
and I was pissed off
because it was down.

00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:34.080
And I was like, oh, no, wait.

00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:34.340
Right.

00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:34.840
Good cause.

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:36.366
This is a good cause.

00:24:36.366 --> 00:24:38.300
MALE SPEAKER: [LAUGHING].

00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:38.680
ALEXIS OHANIAN: And I felt
that rage for a minute.

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:39.888
I was like, what's happening?

00:24:39.888 --> 00:24:40.522
Oh, right.

00:24:40.522 --> 00:24:42.730
But it was after that that
all of a sudden, the phone

00:24:42.730 --> 00:24:45.517
starts ringing, and I spend
24 hours pretty much on TV

00:24:45.517 --> 00:24:47.100
explaining why the
internet's enraged.

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:51.830
But like, all of this
is to say, like I said,

00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:53.150
I got a fortuitous email.

00:24:53.150 --> 00:24:54.640
I was down in DC a week later.

00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:56.490
And I started meeting
with senators and reps

00:24:56.490 --> 00:24:57.330
and their staffers.

00:24:57.330 --> 00:25:01.640
And what was so wild was they
were actually listening to me.

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:02.950
The ones we met with, at least.

00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:04.906
This is a small sample.

00:25:04.906 --> 00:25:06.280
But they were
actually listening.

00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:07.220
We would go around the table.

00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:08.928
We'd have our three
minute elevator pitch

00:25:08.928 --> 00:25:09.990
for saving the internet.

00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:11.794
And I just told my
story of Reddit,

00:25:11.794 --> 00:25:13.710
and how Steve and I got
this thing started out

00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:16.550
of an apartment for $12,000,
and now look what it's doing.

00:25:16.550 --> 00:25:22.782
And that story of the American
Dream, that economic story,

00:25:22.782 --> 00:25:24.740
was enough to get people
to perk up their ears.

00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:26.430
Because look, as sad
as it is, the thing

00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:29.300
that actually moves them
is the potential of being

00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:30.730
accountable for losing jobs.

00:25:30.730 --> 00:25:31.080
MALE SPEAKER: Jobs.

00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:31.640
Economic.

00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:31.890
ALEXIS OHANIAN: Jobs.

00:25:31.890 --> 00:25:32.390
Jobs.

00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:32.940
Jobs.

00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:34.731
I actually went on the
technology subreddit

00:25:34.731 --> 00:25:36.436
the night before and
asked for advice.

00:25:36.436 --> 00:25:38.060
I said, should I talk
about censorship?

00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:40.010
Should I talk about the
economic repercussions?

00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:40.410
And it was great.

00:25:40.410 --> 00:25:42.368
I was getting talking
points from the internet.

00:25:42.368 --> 00:25:43.780
And everyone was saying--

00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:45.571
MALE SPEAKER: What
could possibly go wrong?

00:25:45.571 --> 00:25:48.030
ALEXIS OHANIAN: Well, touche.

00:25:48.030 --> 00:25:52.890
I lucked out because the
ratio of cats to good advice

00:25:52.890 --> 00:25:54.380
was actually pretty good.

00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:55.450
Not too many cats.

00:25:55.450 --> 00:25:57.980
But they all said, don't
even bother with censorship.

00:25:57.980 --> 00:25:59.412
And it was just cynicism.

00:25:59.412 --> 00:26:00.870
There were a few
people who claimed

00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:02.337
to be staffers or
former [INAUDIBLE] I

00:26:02.337 --> 00:26:03.295
said don't even bother.

00:26:03.295 --> 00:26:03.840
No one cares.

00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:04.673
Talk about the jobs.

00:26:04.673 --> 00:26:05.600
Jobs, jobs, jobs.

00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:07.020
Mentioned jobs
every two seconds.

00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:07.855
Jobs.

00:26:07.855 --> 00:26:09.915
MALE SPEAKER: You
mentioned in the book--

00:26:09.915 --> 00:26:10.790
ALEXIS OHANIAN: Jobs.

00:26:10.790 --> 00:26:11.130
MALE SPEAKER: Exactly.

00:26:11.130 --> 00:26:11.629
Jobs.

00:26:11.629 --> 00:26:14.437
The protest in New York
that you attended in person.

00:26:14.437 --> 00:26:16.520
The fact that one of the
things you said-- I mean,

00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:18.030
there's a whole
bunch of people who

00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:22.350
came out in IRL to
protest against this.

00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:26.590
And you asked mostly techies,
I assume, how many of you

00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:28.070
work at companies
that are hiring?

00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:28.405
ALEXIS OHANIAN: Yeah.

00:26:28.405 --> 00:26:28.904
Every hand.

00:26:28.904 --> 00:26:30.960
MALE SPEAKER: And I
thought that was great.

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:31.780
Very powerful.

00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:35.910
And that's exactly what people
in DC can hear, for better

00:26:35.910 --> 00:26:36.470
or for worse.

00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:40.750
ALEXIS OHANIAN: And
that message resonated.

00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:47.160
And we saw a bill that went
from inevitable to unthinkable,

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:48.270
almost overnight.

00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:51.270
After the blackout on the
18th, you saw people running.

00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:54.700
Running, because a bunch of
citizens picked up a phone,

00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:55.360
called up.

00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:57.750
A bunch citizens
signed petitions.

00:26:57.750 --> 00:26:59.605
A bunch of citizens
actually got engaged.

00:26:59.605 --> 00:27:01.230
And millions of
disparate people-- this

00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:02.354
was a leader full movement.

00:27:02.354 --> 00:27:04.760
It wasn't just a couple
people pulling strings.

00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:07.860
This was a decentralized,
very internet kind of story.

00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:08.780
And it worked.

00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:10.110
It actually worked.

00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:13.080
It did something that everyone
in DC said was not possible,

00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:14.960
and it defeated an
entrenched lobbying group

00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:18.170
that has spent their entire
industry basically trying

00:27:18.170 --> 00:27:21.670
to buy Washington to
write laws to preserve

00:27:21.670 --> 00:27:23.280
their outdated business models.

00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:25.410
I'm a little biased.

00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:26.580
But we actually won.

00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:29.760
And so for me as a kind
of political virgin,

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:33.830
that was so dangerous, because
it inspired me so much.

00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:35.180
Because I was like, holy shit.

00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:37.800
Like, the system's broken
99% of the time, but look,

00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:38.996
it actually worked.

00:27:38.996 --> 00:27:40.370
And it was thanks
to the internet

00:27:40.370 --> 00:27:42.354
that we were able to
connect and amass this.

00:27:42.354 --> 00:27:43.770
MALE SPEAKER: I
was really struck.

00:27:43.770 --> 00:27:48.030
As part of that fight, as people
talk about it in retrospect

00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:51.020
now, there is almost a
sense of magic about,

00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:54.679
and then there was a blackout,
and then the law was defeated.

00:27:54.679 --> 00:27:56.470
But there's been a lot
of great stuff being

00:27:56.470 --> 00:27:58.160
written about actually
what happened.

00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:01.190
And one of the things that I
think people shouldn't forget

00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:02.770
is Tumblr.

00:28:02.770 --> 00:28:05.925
Tumblr, early on, they
did an interesting--

00:28:05.925 --> 00:28:08.000
they blacked out pieces
of their website.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.420
And then they created, basically
hacking together existing web

00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:14.820
tools, they hacked
together a web

00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:17.160
to phone interface
that led straight

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:20.250
to the congressional switchboard
of your member of Congress.

00:28:20.250 --> 00:28:23.840
And I thought that was just such
a great concrete example of,

00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:24.800
it's not magic.

00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:27.985
It's existing web tools,
bringing the technologies

00:28:27.985 --> 00:28:32.460
of the web, and just tying stuff
together to make things happen.

00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:35.700
And Tumblr wasn't
the end of the story,

00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:37.740
but I think it was a
very important beginning

00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:41.120
to the story that led to
the Wikipedia blackout,

00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:44.840
and Google's partial
blackout, and all that.

00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:48.230
ALEXIS OHANIAN: The
impressive thing,

00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:50.170
and the thing that
I hope to impart on

00:28:50.170 --> 00:28:53.760
as many people as
possible, is that we all

00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:55.750
have a responsibility.

00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:58.220
And I think, just
as citizens, it

00:28:58.220 --> 00:29:01.980
is so easy to get so cynical.

00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:05.420
It is so easy to get so
disappointed and frustrated.

00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:06.330
But we have--

00:29:06.330 --> 00:29:08.744
MALE SPEAKER: Again,
this week in particular.

00:29:08.744 --> 00:29:10.410
ALEXIS OHANIAN: Trust
me, I'm just like,

00:29:10.410 --> 00:29:12.493
face-palming most the time
whenever I get updates,

00:29:12.493 --> 00:29:14.840
about what's going
on in Washington.

00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:17.199
It is still our government.

00:29:17.199 --> 00:29:19.490
It is still a government by
the people, for the people.

00:29:19.490 --> 00:29:23.720
And the internet presents--
it is just a tool--

00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:27.140
but it presents a tool that can
be used to let us actually get

00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:30.540
the leverage and
input that we deserve.

00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:31.729
That we've always deserved.

00:29:31.729 --> 00:29:33.020
That we always should have had.

00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:35.390
And so that part of that
is just being-- I mean,

00:29:35.390 --> 00:29:40.050
I go around demoing the contact
Congress app on my smartphone,

00:29:40.050 --> 00:29:43.050
just because I like
the accessibility.

00:29:43.050 --> 00:29:46.040
I've been calling my rep
staff the last couple weeks

00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:47.040
just to check in.

00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:48.880
Like, I like the
accessibility of knowing

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:49.420
that I can push a button--

00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:50.770
MALE SPEAKER: Government
going to go back online?

00:29:50.770 --> 00:29:52.936
ALEXIS OHANIAN: Just be
like, hey, what's happening?

00:29:52.936 --> 00:29:55.220
Like, we should feel that
same kind of accountability.

00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:58.970
Because so much of
the inane stuff,

00:29:58.970 --> 00:30:01.450
I can see the photo of
some stranger's breakfast

00:30:01.450 --> 00:30:04.570
right now on Instagram,
or what have you.

00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:05.410
That's great.

00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:06.520
I'm happy that exists.

00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:07.850
I'm not going to hate on it.

00:30:07.850 --> 00:30:09.360
I like looking at food.

00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:12.020
But if we get that kind of
transparency and insight

00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:14.552
into random things
about random strangers,

00:30:14.552 --> 00:30:17.010
shouldn't we have that kind of
insight into our government?

00:30:17.010 --> 00:30:18.360
Into the people
who represent us?

00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:19.818
MALE SPEAKER: So
this was the thing

00:30:19.818 --> 00:30:22.030
that really struck
me reading your book.

00:30:22.030 --> 00:30:25.090
And frankly, even after
the SOPA/PIPA fight.

00:30:25.090 --> 00:30:26.375
I agree with you completely.

00:30:26.375 --> 00:30:27.750
I mean, that kind
of transparency

00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:29.040
is absolutely crucial.

00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:31.257
But another piece of it,
frankly, is the money piece.

00:30:31.257 --> 00:30:32.090
ALEXIS OHANIAN: Yes.

00:30:32.090 --> 00:30:33.640
Huge part of it.

00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:35.640
MALE SPEAKER: And I've
wondered for a long time,

00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:38.490
why is there no
Kickstarter for politics?

00:30:38.490 --> 00:30:40.530
We've taken the tools
of transparency.

00:30:40.530 --> 00:30:43.870
We've taken the tools of
phone calls and all of that.

00:30:43.870 --> 00:30:46.870
But we haven't
democratized the tools

00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:50.820
of giving money to politicians
when they do things we like.

00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:53.930
Because that's
positive reinforcement.

00:30:53.930 --> 00:30:55.440
It can be effective.

00:30:55.440 --> 00:30:58.260
So that's always struck me.

00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:02.250
Why haven't we crowdfunded
the government we want to see?

00:31:02.250 --> 00:31:04.660
ALEXIS OHANIAN: I don't think
we've had candidates yet

00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:08.415
that have really been able to
have the savvy, or the gusto,

00:31:08.415 --> 00:31:09.080
or the what.

00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:10.300
MALE SPEAKER: Let's
crowd-fund them.

00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:11.550
ALEXIS OHANIAN: I mean, right?

00:31:11.550 --> 00:31:12.760
Like, I mean, there are--

00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:15.157
MALE SPEAKER: What are
you doing next fall?

00:31:15.157 --> 00:31:16.740
ALEXIS OHANIAN: Well,
Google, I wanted

00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:19.500
to come here to
announce that next fall,

00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:23.022
I am running for nothing.

00:31:23.022 --> 00:31:23.730
Here's the thing.

00:31:23.730 --> 00:31:25.260
We're going to get a candidate.

00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:28.670
And because she's
a technologist,

00:31:28.670 --> 00:31:30.820
she's going to
instinctively understand

00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:31.895
how valuable this is.

00:31:31.895 --> 00:31:34.270
And with that, we're going to
[INAUDIBLE] technologically

00:31:34.270 --> 00:31:34.740
right.

00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:35.740
Let me go down the list.

00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:36.880
OK.

00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:38.850
Solved problem is crowdfunding.

00:31:38.850 --> 00:31:40.160
This is a solved problem.

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:40.660
Right?

00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:41.743
We could do this tomorrow.

00:31:41.743 --> 00:31:44.520
We could do this in hackathon
over the next 24 hours.

00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:47.330
One of my favorite
examples of a Google Doc,

00:31:47.330 --> 00:31:50.970
shameless plug in action,
is the nonprofit watsi.org,

00:31:50.970 --> 00:31:53.880
which manages every single
financial transaction

00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:57.020
on that nonprofit in a
public, real-time, of course,

00:31:57.020 --> 00:31:57.707
Google Doc.

00:31:57.707 --> 00:32:00.040
So at any moment, you can go
to this nonprofit's website

00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:01.350
and check up on their finances.

00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:02.580
Every transaction.

00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:05.770
That kind of
transparency is solved.

00:32:05.770 --> 00:32:06.400
That's done.

00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:07.540
They're doing it right now.

00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:08.580
And they're an example
that's probably

00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:10.260
going to affect every
nonprofit going forward,

00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:12.080
because why else would I want
to give to a non-profit that

00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:13.150
doesn't give me that
kind of accountability?

00:32:13.150 --> 00:32:14.910
Watsi can do it, why can't you?

00:32:14.910 --> 00:32:17.830
We get someone running
for office, crowdfunding.

00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:20.999
Actually publicly sharing
every dime of where money gets

00:32:20.999 --> 00:32:22.040
spent, where it comes in.

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:24.540
That is already public,
it just comes out too late

00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:25.230
in real time.

00:32:25.230 --> 00:32:27.313
Then all of a sudden, now
we have a representative

00:32:27.313 --> 00:32:29.792
or a senator who we can
point at and say, she did it.

00:32:29.792 --> 00:32:30.750
Why the hell can't you?

00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:34.910
And have that example as a
very real, concrete-- except

00:32:34.910 --> 00:32:38.260
and all this software is
pretty much off the shelf.

00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:42.170
Like, I'm spending
the next five months

00:32:42.170 --> 00:32:44.900
on a bus just talking
to college students.

00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:46.919
But I hope it
inspires some who are

00:32:46.919 --> 00:32:49.210
at least-- I guess they'd
have to be old enough to run.

00:32:49.210 --> 00:32:50.959
Well, they could do
it at the local level.

00:32:50.959 --> 00:32:52.530
The point is, it
is going to happen.

00:32:52.530 --> 00:32:55.770
And when it does, I
can't help but feel

00:32:55.770 --> 00:32:59.870
like they're going to have such
an amazing amount of support

00:32:59.870 --> 00:33:01.940
from all of those
people who called up

00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:03.210
to fight against SOPA/PIPA.

00:33:03.210 --> 00:33:05.085
All those people who
care about the internet.

00:33:05.085 --> 00:33:08.110
The internet public is
just about everyone.

00:33:08.110 --> 00:33:12.510
And it's about time we actually
could flex some muscle,

00:33:12.510 --> 00:33:14.540
because this is what we deserve.

00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:17.580
MALE SPEAKER: So I totally
agree with all of that.

00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:19.584
And I look forward
to seeing that.

00:33:19.584 --> 00:33:21.500
ALEXIS OHANIAN: We should
find this candidate.

00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:22.670
[INAUDIBLE]

00:33:22.670 --> 00:33:24.210
MALE SPEAKER:
That's a great idea.

00:33:24.210 --> 00:33:24.700
That's a great idea.

00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:25.290
ALEXIS OHANIAN: Take it, please.

00:33:25.290 --> 00:33:25.880
Someone do it.

00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:26.970
MALE SPEAKER: But
let me just say,

00:33:26.970 --> 00:33:28.230
I think it's sort of funny.

00:33:28.230 --> 00:33:30.570
I mean, in Silicon
Valley, we work at Google,

00:33:30.570 --> 00:33:32.380
you read Reddit.

00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:35.210
You forget that
outside of this bubble,

00:33:35.210 --> 00:33:39.810
the internet actually has a
very different reputation,

00:33:39.810 --> 00:33:40.310
if you will.

00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:41.185
ALEXIS OHANIAN: Yeah.

00:33:41.185 --> 00:33:43.000
MALE SPEAKER: And I
just wanted to ask you,

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.490
so much to the press
about the internet

00:33:45.490 --> 00:33:49.520
is dominated by the
bad guys, whether it's

00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:54.810
malware people, or revenge porn.

00:33:54.810 --> 00:34:00.790
It's like every media cycle
finds some tiny corner

00:34:00.790 --> 00:34:04.240
of the internet to say that
this is what the internet is.

00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:07.110
And of course,
Reddit, you probably

00:34:07.110 --> 00:34:11.082
have more than a fair amount of
experience with this problem.

00:34:11.082 --> 00:34:13.040
So I'm sort of curious,
what are your thoughts?

00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:15.219
Is this a PR problem?

00:34:15.219 --> 00:34:18.260
Is this a real problem?

00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:22.040
What, if anything, should
the internet do about it,

00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:23.999
or not do about it?

00:34:23.999 --> 00:34:24.790
ALEXIS OHANIAN: OK.

00:34:24.790 --> 00:34:29.205
Well, so the internet--
in this instance,

00:34:29.205 --> 00:34:30.580
when I describe
the internet, I'm

00:34:30.580 --> 00:34:33.199
talking about this technology.

00:34:33.199 --> 00:34:35.690
The internet is a reflection,
like any other tool,

00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:37.380
of the people who
use it, whether it's

00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:39.046
a hammer, whether
it's a printing press,

00:34:39.046 --> 00:34:44.260
whether it's a thing-- and
whether it was the 5 o'clock

00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:47.620
news 30 years ago,
leads and leads,

00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:50.260
we have a tendency to
talk about this stuff,

00:34:50.260 --> 00:34:53.330
because mundane things
never make headlines.

00:34:53.330 --> 00:34:55.820
Joe is a reasonable
person one day.

00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:58.400
Jane is a reasonable
person the next day.

00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:01.900
That doesn't get attention in
a way that the extremes do.

00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:03.830
That's not to say
it's not a problem.

00:35:03.830 --> 00:35:08.880
It is just that like all things,
the stuff that is basically

00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:14.500
the statistical minority, but
that is doing offensive, awful,

00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:17.010
whatever stuff, is the thing
that gets the spotlight.

00:35:17.010 --> 00:35:18.010
That gets the attention.

00:35:18.010 --> 00:35:19.968
MALE SPEAKER: Unfortunately,
then I worry, then

00:35:19.968 --> 00:35:22.900
it gets the laws.

00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:25.990
What leads the news becomes the
thing the member of Congress

00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:28.500
wants to introduce a law about.

00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:30.895
I was just reading a
blog by a law professor

00:35:30.895 --> 00:35:33.260
in Santa Clara, Eric
Goldman, who's great.

00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:34.970
And he had a great
line this morning.

00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:38.280
He said, "I have never
seen any law passed

00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:40.680
by any state about
the internet that

00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:43.600
has been anything
other than terrible."

00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:49.200
And so I wonder, as long
as that's the mechanism,

00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:53.370
you see these extreme
stories, and then

00:35:53.370 --> 00:35:56.540
that's what yields
policymaker attention,

00:35:56.540 --> 00:35:59.460
we have this kind
of-- I wonder if this

00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:02.150
is going to be the next thing
the cat signal gets used for.

00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:04.660
And I guess that's
my next question.

00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:07.780
Where do you think
the next internet cat

00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:12.270
signal worthy threat to the
open internet comes from?

00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:14.870
ALEXIS OHANIAN: OK.

00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:17.940
I mean, Verizon's at it again
with that neutrality stuff.

00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:19.774
Or at least thwarting it.

00:36:19.774 --> 00:36:21.440
There's TPP, and I
don't think any of us

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:22.500
have a clue what's
going on there,

00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:24.040
because it's all closed doors.

00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:26.080
World leaders not
telling us jack.

00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:28.780
MALE SPEAKER: That's treaty that
will include some copyright law

00:36:28.780 --> 00:36:32.300
provisions that will involve a
number of different countries

00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:33.970
that are negotiating
it in secret.

00:36:33.970 --> 00:36:36.150
ALEXIS OHANIAN:
Totally in secret.

00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:38.640
Copyright reform seems
like it's on the table.

00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:40.004
That could be great.

00:36:40.004 --> 00:36:40.920
I'm hoping it's great.

00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:44.460
MALE SPEAKER: Well, I will
say this about copyright form.

00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:47.170
That committee of
Congress, they have not

00:36:47.170 --> 00:36:48.860
forgotten PIPA and SOPA.

00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:52.627
They are still paying
close attention.

00:36:52.627 --> 00:36:53.710
ALEXIS OHANIAN: Excellent.

00:36:53.710 --> 00:36:58.910
MALE SPEAKER: So that's pretty
good, all things considered.

00:36:58.910 --> 00:37:02.440
ALEXIS OHANIAN: I mean, the
hope there is we can actually

00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:05.500
roll back copyright to stop
protecting Mickey Mouse

00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:07.360
and actually start
helping people

00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:09.160
innovate and be creative.

00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:10.930
It's scary.

00:37:10.930 --> 00:37:13.980
And I was able to dig up some
old stuff from-- because I went

00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:15.802
UVA, of course, I
love quoting TJ.

00:37:15.802 --> 00:37:17.260
And I found some
old letters of his

00:37:17.260 --> 00:37:20.480
where he even debated
putting an explicit limit

00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:23.710
in the Constitution for
personal monopolies.

00:37:23.710 --> 00:37:25.560
For copyrights, trademarks.

00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:27.980
Because there is a
short-term reason,

00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:31.260
and a great reason
to have copyright.

00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:33.270
But the way it has been
abused has taken it

00:37:33.270 --> 00:37:36.687
so far from its intended
purpose that it's actually

00:37:36.687 --> 00:37:38.270
stifling innovation
when it's supposed

00:37:38.270 --> 00:37:41.010
to encourage it and enable it.

00:37:41.010 --> 00:37:42.611
That's probably
the next one, where

00:37:42.611 --> 00:37:44.860
there's going to be some
meeting, something coming up,

00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:47.350
and it's going to be on us
to rally as many artists,

00:37:47.350 --> 00:37:48.990
as many musicians,
as many authors,

00:37:48.990 --> 00:37:51.840
as many creatives,
copyright makers,

00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:54.000
as possible to say,
no, no, no, hold on.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:59.650
Actually, the reason
my buddy-- oh my gosh,

00:37:59.650 --> 00:38:01.760
I can only think of
"Dinosaur Comics" right now.

00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:04.550
The reason that Ryan North,
who creates "Dinosaur Comics,"

00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:06.627
was able to remix
"Hamlet" into a Choose

00:38:06.627 --> 00:38:08.210
your Own Adventure
version of "Hamlet"

00:38:08.210 --> 00:38:11.230
and raise $600,000
on Kickstarter

00:38:11.230 --> 00:38:13.500
was because it's in
the public domain.

00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:15.914
I don't think the estate of
Shakespeare loses anything--

00:38:15.914 --> 00:38:17.580
MALE SPEAKER: Because
Disney has not yet

00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:19.620
made their animated
"Hamlet" version.

00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:20.730
ALEXIS OHANIAN: I know.

00:38:20.730 --> 00:38:22.230
And it's like, we
are so much better

00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:25.320
off because it is in
the public domain.

00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:28.745
The saddest one is the fact
that Dr. King's speech still

00:38:28.745 --> 00:38:31.120
requires some kind of financial
transaction to be viewed.

00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:33.640
And it's like, that is
itself an amazing remix

00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:35.370
of so many amazing works.

00:38:35.370 --> 00:38:37.060
And yes, sadly
enough, here is one

00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:39.792
of the most important public
speeches of the 20th century,

00:38:39.792 --> 00:38:42.000
and someone needs to be paid
if you want to watch it.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.666
MALE SPEAKER: One of
my favorite stories

00:38:43.666 --> 00:38:45.150
is the song "Happy Birthday."

00:38:45.150 --> 00:38:45.350
ALEXIS OHANIAN: Right.

00:38:45.350 --> 00:38:45.940
The lyrics.

00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:46.731
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:38:46.731 --> 00:38:51.770
Currently in litigation
with f Music claiming they

00:38:51.770 --> 00:38:54.190
own the copyright to that.

00:38:54.190 --> 00:38:58.787
now It was just a story about an
online stream of a live event,

00:38:58.787 --> 00:39:00.620
where they started
singing "Happy Birthday,"

00:39:00.620 --> 00:39:05.075
and the audio got shut down,
because it was like, sorry,

00:39:05.075 --> 00:39:05.700
that's a match.

00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:06.533
ALEXIS OHANIAN: Wow.

00:39:06.533 --> 00:39:08.491
Worst birthday ever.

00:39:08.491 --> 00:39:10.240
MALE SPEAKER: Anyhow,
I want to leave time

00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:13.260
for questions from this
great audience as well.

00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:17.540
So if folks have questions, I
think there's a mike somewhere,

00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:22.339
so that the video can
hear what you had to say.

00:39:22.339 --> 00:39:23.380
AUDIENCE: Thanks so much.

00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:26.020
I loved what you said about
Y Combinator and the culture

00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:28.232
of like startup founders
helping startup founders.

00:39:28.232 --> 00:39:29.690
And that's one of
the things that I

00:39:29.690 --> 00:39:31.160
see so often on the internet.

00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:33.870
When we look at why the
SOPA and PIPA stuff failed

00:39:33.870 --> 00:39:35.860
was because there was
just a unified message

00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:39.550
and a unified front amongst
the internet citizenry.

00:39:39.550 --> 00:39:43.450
How do we continue to take some
of the biting commentary that

00:39:43.450 --> 00:39:46.570
comes out of people online, when
we forget that other people are

00:39:46.570 --> 00:39:48.420
people buying keyboards?

00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:49.170
How do we do that?

00:39:49.170 --> 00:39:52.840
How do we foster that spirit?

00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:53.840
ALEXIS OHANIAN: I wish--

00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:56.910
MALE SPEAKER: You mean to say
that unifying YouTube and G+

00:39:56.910 --> 00:39:58.667
comments won't solve it?

00:39:58.667 --> 00:40:00.000
ALEXIS OHANIAN: No, it will not.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.083
MALE SPEAKER: Inside joke.

00:40:01.083 --> 00:40:01.670
Inside joke.

00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:02.840
ALEXIS OHANIAN: That's
the reality, right?

00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:04.340
I mean, Facebook's
the closest thing

00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:06.840
we have to the
realist of identities.

00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:08.370
Real name, real photo.

00:40:08.370 --> 00:40:10.690
And people still behave
like awful human beings

00:40:10.690 --> 00:40:14.130
to people they
know in real life.

00:40:14.130 --> 00:40:15.470
I mean, despicable stuff.

00:40:15.470 --> 00:40:19.610
So the reality is, I
think no matter what,

00:40:19.610 --> 00:40:23.050
some extent of awful people will
feel comfortable saying things

00:40:23.050 --> 00:40:29.120
behind the device than
they would in person.

00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:30.870
You could make it so
their parents have

00:40:30.870 --> 00:40:33.160
to live-stream watch
every comment they type.

00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:36.850
Like, there's some subset that
are going to always do that.

00:40:36.850 --> 00:40:38.700
So on the one hand,
there's the glib answer

00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:40.890
of like, finding a way
to like, electrocute them

00:40:40.890 --> 00:40:41.990
whenever-- I mean,
you guys, you,

00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:43.698
could maybe plug that
in Android somehow.

00:40:47.110 --> 00:40:51.720
Unfortunately, it there is
a certain societal thing

00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:53.624
we can do for etiquette
in terms of trying

00:40:53.624 --> 00:40:55.040
to encourage that
better behavior.

00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:57.000
At some extent, nothing
will be fool-proof.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.570
The gift and the curse to an
open communication platform

00:40:59.570 --> 00:41:00.620
is people are open.

00:41:00.620 --> 00:41:03.410
Whether they're open to say
things-- because remember,

00:41:03.410 --> 00:41:04.870
that same ability
to say something

00:41:04.870 --> 00:41:06.328
that you would not
feel comfortable

00:41:06.328 --> 00:41:08.590
saying to someone's
face helps someone.

00:41:08.590 --> 00:41:11.305
It helps someone say something.

00:41:11.305 --> 00:41:12.680
If they live in
a community where

00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:15.480
they would be persecuted
for their sexuality,

00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:17.480
it gives them the
confidence to say stuff

00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:19.910
that they couldn't say with
their real name attached.

00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:22.650
Because they might
be persecuted.

00:41:22.650 --> 00:41:23.830
That is a great gift.

00:41:23.830 --> 00:41:26.540
But the curse of it is, again,
it lets some asshole abuse it.

00:41:26.540 --> 00:41:30.750
And I-- only Sith
deal in absolutes.

00:41:30.750 --> 00:41:35.340
So I can't say-- you have to
take the good with the bad.

00:41:35.340 --> 00:41:38.847
And we need to do as much as
we can to curtail the bad.

00:41:38.847 --> 00:41:40.430
And I think a lot
of that's just going

00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:43.211
to come from us as a society.

00:41:43.211 --> 00:41:44.710
I mean, so much of
this has come up.

00:41:44.710 --> 00:41:46.750
And I think specifically
of cyberbullying.

00:41:46.750 --> 00:41:49.180
And I think of Louis CK's
recent observation, which

00:41:49.180 --> 00:41:51.400
was so spot-on,
in which she said,

00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:53.660
the reason I don't let my
daughter's have cell phones,

00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:55.446
or really use the
internet much is

00:41:55.446 --> 00:41:56.820
because I need
them to understand

00:41:56.820 --> 00:41:59.020
that when they are
bullies, it hurts people.

00:41:59.020 --> 00:42:01.467
If you bully someone
to their face,

00:42:01.467 --> 00:42:02.675
it is a learning opportunity.

00:42:02.675 --> 00:42:05.359
And as a kid, usually,
you feel empathy.

00:42:05.359 --> 00:42:07.650
You can't really help, unless
you're a total sociopath,

00:42:07.650 --> 00:42:08.640
but feel empathy.

00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:10.990
But when these kids come
up-- these whippersnappers--

00:42:10.990 --> 00:42:13.059
when these kids come
up and can do it

00:42:13.059 --> 00:42:15.600
all from the safety of a phone,
they never feel that empathy.

00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:17.180
And here's Louis CK on
"The Late Night Show."

00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:18.350
And I'm like, damn, Louis.

00:42:18.350 --> 00:42:20.000
You've nailed it.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:23.010
I don't have a solution
yet, but it is very clear

00:42:23.010 --> 00:42:25.720
that this is a risk that we run.

00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:28.000
Look, you guys are Google
you can figure it out

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:29.700
probably faster than I can.

00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:30.720
But it's a real issue.

00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:32.337
Because we don't know.

00:42:32.337 --> 00:42:33.420
This is all new territory.

00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:38.330
The best thing we have going
for us right now is this

00:42:38.330 --> 00:42:39.690
is all a new frontier.

00:42:39.690 --> 00:42:42.450
And in a lot of ways we,
especially the people

00:42:42.450 --> 00:42:44.405
here at Google,
have an opportunity

00:42:44.405 --> 00:42:46.450
to sort of guide that
in some way, shape,

00:42:46.450 --> 00:42:48.700
or form, whether through the
technology that we build,

00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:49.570
or the things we do.

00:42:49.570 --> 00:42:52.200
But to some extent, we also
have to accept the fact

00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:55.205
that we can't
totally control it.

00:42:55.205 --> 00:42:55.830
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:42:55.830 --> 00:42:57.704
I have a question towards
your history major.

00:42:57.704 --> 00:42:58.740
You mentioned Jefferson.

00:42:58.740 --> 00:42:59.573
ALEXIS OHANIAN: Yes.

00:42:59.573 --> 00:43:02.369
AUDIENCE: Any other figures, or
maybe even trends historically,

00:43:02.369 --> 00:43:03.910
or time periods, or
things like that,

00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:05.600
that really influenced
your career?

00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:06.475
ALEXIS OHANIAN: Woah.

00:43:06.475 --> 00:43:07.280
MALE SPEAKER: Oh.

00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:08.604
ALEXIS OHANIAN: Woah, deep.

00:43:08.604 --> 00:43:09.840
Oh, man.

00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:11.560
I do not get asked
this question.

00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:12.539
All right.

00:43:12.539 --> 00:43:14.330
I need to make my
history professors proud.

00:43:20.018 --> 00:43:22.230
Uh, man.

00:43:22.230 --> 00:43:25.410
One of the things that has
really and tru-- well, OK.

00:43:25.410 --> 00:43:29.360
When I think of the
future of media,

00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:34.020
I am so-- well actually,
let's back this up.

00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:37.060
Tim Wu wrote amazing book
called "The Master Switch."

00:43:37.060 --> 00:43:39.170
And it's a great
pairing with my book,

00:43:39.170 --> 00:43:43.280
because this is real
talk from Professor Wu.

00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:46.140
He's just like, listen,
all the same shit Alexis

00:43:46.140 --> 00:43:48.745
is saying about the internet
they were saying about radio,

00:43:48.745 --> 00:43:51.120
about film, about TV, about
all these other communication

00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:51.750
platforms.

00:43:51.750 --> 00:43:54.190
And it was going to be so
democratizing, and so amazing,

00:43:54.190 --> 00:43:55.120
and so wonderful.

00:43:55.120 --> 00:43:57.720
And every single one of them,
every single one of them,

00:43:57.720 --> 00:43:59.100
whether it's through big
business, big government,

00:43:59.100 --> 00:44:00.599
or some combination
of the two, have

00:44:00.599 --> 00:44:04.200
been what they are today, which
is anything but democratic.

00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:06.320
So I am very, very cognizant.

00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:09.380
I keep that book like,
floating in my head.

00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:12.890
As optimistic as I am,
there is a very real chance

00:44:12.890 --> 00:44:15.014
that this ends up going
the same way of all

00:44:15.014 --> 00:44:15.930
those other platforms.

00:44:15.930 --> 00:44:17.232
And humans are resourceful.

00:44:17.232 --> 00:44:19.190
There's going to be some
other iteration of it.

00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:20.981
But I don't even want
to go down that road.

00:44:20.981 --> 00:44:23.010
Because right now, we
have such an opportunity.

00:44:23.010 --> 00:44:24.670
It is the world's
largest library,

00:44:24.670 --> 00:44:26.724
and the world's
largest stage in one.

00:44:26.724 --> 00:44:29.140
And it's accessible to anyone
with an internet connection.

00:44:29.140 --> 00:44:30.410
Which is part of the
reason why I love you guys

00:44:30.410 --> 00:44:32.400
doing this balloon
internet thing.

00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:33.260
Awesome.

00:44:33.260 --> 00:44:35.430
Like, access is still
a huge part of it.

00:44:35.430 --> 00:44:37.830
And there's some author
who wrote a book that's

00:44:37.830 --> 00:44:39.817
saying Google was
making us stupid.

00:44:39.817 --> 00:44:40.900
Can't remember who it was.

00:44:40.900 --> 00:44:42.730
Very link bait-y title.

00:44:42.730 --> 00:44:45.170
Yes, I don't mind
as a history major

00:44:45.170 --> 00:44:47.740
not really remembering
that the Civil War was

00:44:47.740 --> 00:44:50.860
from 1861 to 1865,
even though it was,

00:44:50.860 --> 00:44:52.480
and having to Google that later.

00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:54.120
Because yes, that is a cost.

00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:55.590
Maybe I'm a little dumber
because I don't remember

00:44:55.590 --> 00:44:57.089
that particular
fact, because I know

00:44:57.089 --> 00:44:58.454
I can Google it, or Bing it.

00:44:58.454 --> 00:45:02.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:04.890
But again, that's the curse.

00:45:04.890 --> 00:45:07.970
The gift is anyone with
an internet connection

00:45:07.970 --> 00:45:10.890
can now get the world's
knowledge about the Civil War

00:45:10.890 --> 00:45:12.610
at their fingertips for nothing.

00:45:12.610 --> 00:45:13.460
My trade-off?

00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:14.500
That's totally worth.

00:45:14.500 --> 00:45:18.177
I will gladly be a little
worse at trivia night

00:45:18.177 --> 00:45:20.510
if it means the world can get
access to knowledge that's

00:45:20.510 --> 00:45:22.030
historically been only
accessible to those who

00:45:22.030 --> 00:45:24.750
had the power, the money, or the
connections, or the whatever.

00:45:24.750 --> 00:45:26.499
And again, it's always
a gift and a curse.

00:45:26.499 --> 00:45:29.932
There's always, I think
generally speaking,

00:45:29.932 --> 00:45:31.390
with any of these
new technologies,

00:45:31.390 --> 00:45:32.139
it's always there.

00:45:32.139 --> 00:45:33.560
But that is the thing.

00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:36.412
And this one feels like
it's going to be different.

00:45:36.412 --> 00:45:37.870
I know a lot of
people in tech have

00:45:37.870 --> 00:45:39.120
gotten in trouble saying that.

00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:44.410
But I really hope so, because
in just the last five years,

00:45:44.410 --> 00:45:48.800
it feels like we are on
the cusp of really doing

00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:50.080
something special.

00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:52.105
And hopefully,
not following suit

00:45:52.105 --> 00:45:54.480
and following in the path of
all those other technologies

00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:55.800
before it.

00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:57.020
Because that would suck.

00:45:57.020 --> 00:45:59.020
That would really, really suck.

00:45:59.020 --> 00:46:03.235
So let's not screw
this up, people, OK?

00:46:03.235 --> 00:46:03.735
OK

00:46:03.735 --> 00:46:04.010
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:46:04.010 --> 00:46:05.990
So you said that your
time at Y Combinator

00:46:05.990 --> 00:46:07.760
had a huge influence
on your success,

00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:13.480
and you think that it's a great
opportunity for young people

00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:15.740
to get involved in
the startup industry.

00:46:15.740 --> 00:46:18.080
If you look statistically
at the type of people

00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:20.750
that are in Y
Combinator, it tends

00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:23.610
to be overwhelmingly male,
overwhelmingly white,

00:46:23.610 --> 00:46:27.580
overwhelmingly middle
to upper middle class.

00:46:27.580 --> 00:46:30.860
How do suggest bringing
that kind of opportunity

00:46:30.860 --> 00:46:33.750
to join the startup industry
to people that have generally

00:46:33.750 --> 00:46:36.040
been disadvantaged,
like minorities,

00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:37.510
women, that kind of people?

00:46:37.510 --> 00:46:39.830
ALEXIS OHANIAN: Well,
so the only asterisk

00:46:39.830 --> 00:46:41.917
I put on that is we
actually-- I don't

00:46:41.917 --> 00:46:43.250
have the numbers in front of me.

00:46:43.250 --> 00:46:46.490
But typically, Southeast
Asians also do well at YC.

00:46:46.490 --> 00:46:52.860
But yes, definitely
majority male, and still. .

00:46:52.860 --> 00:46:54.640
And this is an issue
for Y Combinator.

00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:56.520
This is an issue for tech.

00:46:56.520 --> 00:46:58.720
And where does it begin?

00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:03.365
I mean, the short
answer is, it is largely

00:47:03.365 --> 00:47:06.330
a reflection of the applicant
pool to Y Combinator.

00:47:06.330 --> 00:47:07.160
So, all right.

00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:08.900
How do we broaden
that applicant pool?

00:47:11.580 --> 00:47:15.390
I hope visiting 75 universities
brings more people,

00:47:15.390 --> 00:47:17.740
like a dose of what is possible.

00:47:17.740 --> 00:47:19.156
And at the end of
the day, I don't

00:47:19.156 --> 00:47:20.150
care if they apply
to Y Combinator.

00:47:20.150 --> 00:47:22.660
I just want them to get
interested in building tech.

00:47:22.660 --> 00:47:26.870
But this is such a big problem.

00:47:26.870 --> 00:47:30.610
Because the bias
for tech investors

00:47:30.610 --> 00:47:33.370
is to invest in founders who
aren't themselves technical.

00:47:33.370 --> 00:47:37.960
And so you are looking
at fixing and correcting

00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:40.761
what has been a problem
for a very long time.

00:47:40.761 --> 00:47:43.260
And so part of it is attacking
it at the early stages, where

00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:46.630
it's like, the reason I'm on the
advisor board of [INAUDIBLE],

00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:49.060
and I'm actually fund-raising
for every STEM classroom

00:47:49.060 --> 00:47:52.780
in Brooklyn right now, is
because it's getting access

00:47:52.780 --> 00:47:55.420
to technology in classrooms
for kids at a very young age.

00:47:55.420 --> 00:47:59.170
It is increasing the number
of women and people of color

00:47:59.170 --> 00:48:03.180
who are doing STEM who are
interested in computer science.

00:48:03.180 --> 00:48:05.240
They are amazing
organizations that I support,

00:48:05.240 --> 00:48:09.440
like Black Girls Who Code, that
are doing a great job better.

00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:12.430
That have single-minded focus
on bringing women of color

00:48:12.430 --> 00:48:15.836
into technology and
teaching them how to code.

00:48:15.836 --> 00:48:17.210
There are so many
elements to it.

00:48:17.210 --> 00:48:25.520
And I mean, from the tech
community's standpoint,

00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:27.790
there is also kind
of a responsibility

00:48:27.790 --> 00:48:31.930
that we all have to create an
environment and a place that

00:48:31.930 --> 00:48:33.800
is just welcoming.

00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:40.220
And I don't know whether it
is conduct at hackathons,

00:48:40.220 --> 00:48:41.990
whether it is the
kinds of events we run,

00:48:41.990 --> 00:48:44.090
whether it's the people
we have on stage.

00:48:44.090 --> 00:48:45.450
I mean, it's all of this stuff.

00:48:45.450 --> 00:48:46.940
It's a ton of stuff.

00:48:46.940 --> 00:48:49.890
And I'm sure there's more
that I could be doing.

00:48:49.890 --> 00:48:51.590
But the low-hanging
fruit that I've

00:48:51.590 --> 00:48:54.060
been able to find myself most
effective with sort of breaks

00:48:54.060 --> 00:48:56.884
down to like, again,
whether supporting classroom

00:48:56.884 --> 00:48:59.050
[INAUDIBLE], whether it's
helping organizations that

00:48:59.050 --> 00:49:00.675
are specifically
geared towards-- Girls

00:49:00.675 --> 00:49:02.936
Who Code is another great one.

00:49:02.936 --> 00:49:05.560
Geared towards actually getting
these valuable, valuable skills

00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:08.360
in the hands of the
people who need it most,

00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:13.930
as well as just sort of
generally trying to be an ally.

00:49:13.930 --> 00:49:15.624
But it's not
something that's going

00:49:15.624 --> 00:49:17.040
to unfortunately
change overnight.

00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:21.370
But I can already
see an improvement

00:49:21.370 --> 00:49:24.750
versus eight years ago when
we were starting in tech.

00:49:24.750 --> 00:49:26.644
So it's not a reason
to get complacent,

00:49:26.644 --> 00:49:28.310
but it's a reason to
feel good about it.

00:49:28.310 --> 00:49:31.100
I mean, I was so pleased.

00:49:31.100 --> 00:49:33.049
The last Google science
fair thing you guys

00:49:33.049 --> 00:49:34.590
do with all the high
schools, I don't

00:49:34.590 --> 00:49:37.300
think there was a
single dude finalist.

00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:39.810
And that's like, awesome.

00:49:39.810 --> 00:49:40.580
Sorry, guys.

00:49:40.580 --> 00:49:45.490
But like, it's things like
that, and stories and examples

00:49:45.490 --> 00:49:48.310
like that that I think will
hope to show and work on this.

00:49:48.310 --> 00:49:50.922
But like, it's far
from overnight.

00:49:50.922 --> 00:49:52.630
AUDIENCE: So, it was
kind of interesting.

00:49:52.630 --> 00:49:55.230
There was another talk
just before yours.

00:49:55.230 --> 00:49:57.400
And it's an editor
from "The Economist"

00:49:57.400 --> 00:49:59.580
who's writing a book.

00:49:59.580 --> 00:50:01.610
The book is called "The
Writing on the Wall,"

00:50:01.610 --> 00:50:04.315
saying that this
version of new media

00:50:04.315 --> 00:50:08.585
is actually kind of
old media as well.

00:50:08.585 --> 00:50:12.190
And how in the past,
Romans especially, they

00:50:12.190 --> 00:50:14.260
used to share information,
and transmission

00:50:14.260 --> 00:50:15.645
was relatively
cheap, because you

00:50:15.645 --> 00:50:18.420
had people that could transcribe
it, and copy it, and send it

00:50:18.420 --> 00:50:19.190
around.

00:50:19.190 --> 00:50:21.170
And so, he was actually
like, arguing the fact

00:50:21.170 --> 00:50:24.830
that the establishment as
it was before the internet

00:50:24.830 --> 00:50:26.350
is kind of the fad.

00:50:26.350 --> 00:50:29.530
And that this thing about
being able to share information

00:50:29.530 --> 00:50:33.610
more freely is the way things
were done before the barriers

00:50:33.610 --> 00:50:35.990
to entry became so large
that people couldn't do it.

00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:38.960
So I guess there's kind of
like, some hope for-- like,

00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:41.239
you're saying to be
optimistic about,

00:50:41.239 --> 00:50:42.530
that is where things are going.

00:50:42.530 --> 00:50:43.363
ALEXIS OHANIAN: Yes.

00:50:43.363 --> 00:50:46.071
And I actually bumped into
him in Portland, actually.

00:50:46.071 --> 00:50:48.070
And I was able to get a
signed copy of his book.

00:50:48.070 --> 00:50:50.060
So I'm a chapter in,
and I know exactly what

00:50:50.060 --> 00:50:51.726
you're talking about
about ancient Rome.

00:50:51.726 --> 00:50:55.890
What's so cool is, yes--
and it's really easy

00:50:55.890 --> 00:50:58.630
to gush about how
great the internet is.

00:50:58.630 --> 00:51:00.830
All of those things that
have been so successful

00:51:00.830 --> 00:51:04.710
really are just better scaled
versions of things humans

00:51:04.710 --> 00:51:05.700
have always done.

00:51:05.700 --> 00:51:07.940
Whether it's social media.

00:51:07.940 --> 00:51:09.960
I mean, crowdfunding, right?

00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:12.560
As soon as we had currency,
actually people were bartering.

00:51:12.560 --> 00:51:14.220
They were probably
like, hey, let's all

00:51:14.220 --> 00:51:16.880
pitch in to go
create this thing.

00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:18.450
Some of the best
ideas are the ones

00:51:18.450 --> 00:51:21.107
that are just highly
scaled versions of things

00:51:21.107 --> 00:51:22.690
human beings have
always done, instead

00:51:22.690 --> 00:51:24.260
of having to teach
us a new skill.

00:51:24.260 --> 00:51:27.150
MALE SPEAKER: And on that same
note, I'd encourage any of you,

00:51:27.150 --> 00:51:30.370
the next time you're going to
complain about Reddit trolls

00:51:30.370 --> 00:51:32.480
or the quality of
YouTube comments,

00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:36.110
there's a great article online--
I'm sure you can find it using

00:51:36.110 --> 00:51:40.730
your favorite search engine--
about the graffiti in like

00:51:40.730 --> 00:51:41.231
Vesuvius--

00:51:41.231 --> 00:51:42.105
ALEXIS OHANIAN: Yeah.

00:51:42.105 --> 00:51:43.330
Awful stuff on those walls.

00:51:43.330 --> 00:51:43.840
MALE SPEAKER: Exactly.

00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:44.540
It really is.

00:51:44.540 --> 00:51:45.610
It really is.

00:51:45.610 --> 00:51:47.500
People are the same.

00:51:47.500 --> 00:51:50.500
It's scaled, but the
people are still the same

00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:51.337
as they were then.

00:51:51.337 --> 00:51:53.420
ALEXIS OHANIAN: Let me,
because it's again, always

00:51:53.420 --> 00:51:54.420
very helpful.

00:51:54.420 --> 00:51:59.800
One of the things that makes
me so much happier is, so yes,

00:51:59.800 --> 00:52:01.020
people always been the same.

00:52:01.020 --> 00:52:03.580
And we can get all
deep about like,

00:52:03.580 --> 00:52:05.850
the duality of man and humans
and the range of stuff.

00:52:05.850 --> 00:52:08.610
But look, I think
historically, we've

00:52:08.610 --> 00:52:10.505
always had forces that
have always tried to,

00:52:10.505 --> 00:52:12.880
for whatever reasons, whether
they were businesses trying

00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:15.290
to sell us more toothpaste,
whether they were governments

00:52:15.290 --> 00:52:18.260
trying to make a scared,
whatever, we've always

00:52:18.260 --> 00:52:20.750
been pushed toward sort
of fearing our neighbor

00:52:20.750 --> 00:52:23.080
and being more afraid
and being worried.

00:52:25.627 --> 00:52:28.085
I really do believe most people
are actually pretty decent.

00:52:28.085 --> 00:52:29.460
They're just decent people.

00:52:29.460 --> 00:52:32.690
And the fact that these stories,
these sort of benign stories,

00:52:32.690 --> 00:52:34.270
can now scale a
lot further, when

00:52:34.270 --> 00:52:38.200
you can read the story
of some cute kids

00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:40.730
in LA Children's Hospital
putting up a sign that

00:52:40.730 --> 00:52:43.484
says "Send Pizza," and that can
go around the world, and all

00:52:43.484 --> 00:52:45.150
of a sudden, a bunch
of random strangers

00:52:45.150 --> 00:52:48.300
are just buying pizza for a
bunch of kids in a chemo ward.

00:52:48.300 --> 00:52:52.240
And that story now doesn't
just stay within the family.

00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:54.710
I'm sure at some point in
the history of hospitals, ,

00:52:54.710 --> 00:52:57.220
someone did some random kind
gesture like buy some pizza

00:52:57.220 --> 00:52:58.510
for some sick kids.

00:52:58.510 --> 00:52:59.617
But now that story scales.

00:52:59.617 --> 00:53:01.450
And now that story gets
seen by more people,

00:53:01.450 --> 00:53:03.409
and more people actually
go, oh, you know what?

00:53:03.409 --> 00:53:04.241
That's kind of nice.

00:53:04.241 --> 00:53:05.020
Like, that's cool.

00:53:05.020 --> 00:53:09.200
And we can actually finally
start scaling those subtle,

00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:12.730
kind gestures of humanity that
never would have made headlines

00:53:12.730 --> 00:53:13.230
before.

00:53:13.230 --> 00:53:14.690
That never would
have gone beyond

00:53:14.690 --> 00:53:16.300
our initial social circle.

00:53:16.300 --> 00:53:17.680
Again, I am optimistic.

00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:20.470
But I really hope we get a
little closer to all realizing

00:53:20.470 --> 00:53:22.050
we're all just
carbon-based lifeforms

00:53:22.050 --> 00:53:24.020
trying to get by on
a little blue dot.

00:53:24.020 --> 00:53:25.400
At least until the singularly.

00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:27.626
And I saw Kurzweil earlier.

00:53:27.626 --> 00:53:28.750
That's going to be amazing.

00:53:28.750 --> 00:53:31.254
But until then, we got to try
not to fuck this thing up.

00:53:31.254 --> 00:53:33.420
MALE SPEAKER: As they said
in "Star Trek," "Ugly Bag

00:53:33.420 --> 00:53:36.994
of Mostly Water."

00:53:36.994 --> 00:53:38.410
AUDIENCE: With all
the revelations

00:53:38.410 --> 00:53:42.590
of what the NSA has been doing
to spy on a bunch of people,

00:53:42.590 --> 00:53:44.480
I was kind of wondering-- sorry.

00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:47.856
ALEXIS OHANIAN: I was
like, is that God?

00:53:47.856 --> 00:53:49.230
AUDIENCE: I was
kind of wondering

00:53:49.230 --> 00:53:51.490
what your thoughts on that were?

00:53:51.490 --> 00:53:55.560
I know a lot of politicians seem
to be OK and in support of it.

00:53:55.560 --> 00:53:58.140
I can kind of guess
what your thoughts are.

00:53:58.140 --> 00:54:02.670
But two, also, how do you feel
that the internet may change

00:54:02.670 --> 00:54:04.590
in response to this information?

00:54:04.590 --> 00:54:06.390
And also three, if
there's anything

00:54:06.390 --> 00:54:09.880
you think we could do to
prevent any bad outcomes that

00:54:09.880 --> 00:54:10.720
might come of it?

00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:15.550
For example, you hear
about Brazil and China

00:54:15.550 --> 00:54:18.080
talking about
decentralizing the internet.

00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:19.080
ALEXIS OHANIAN: Oh, man.

00:54:19.080 --> 00:54:19.760
All right.

00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:22.930
Well, NSA.

00:54:22.930 --> 00:54:25.560
Yeah.

00:54:25.560 --> 00:54:28.520
What is creepy, like
there's a brief dystopian

00:54:28.520 --> 00:54:30.260
section of the book
where I'm like,

00:54:30.260 --> 00:54:31.970
here's what's going to
happen if we fuck this up.

00:54:31.970 --> 00:54:32.470
And.

00:54:32.470 --> 00:54:34.450
I joke about
everything the NSA has

00:54:34.450 --> 00:54:37.070
been doing for the last few
years, which was awkward.

00:54:37.070 --> 00:54:39.960
Because I didn't want
that to be prophetic.

00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:45.060
That is incredibly
upsetting to me.

00:54:45.060 --> 00:54:46.720
And I think more
and more Americans

00:54:46.720 --> 00:54:50.720
are realizing that-- maybe
this is again wishful thinking.

00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:53.210
But we have a Fourth
Amendment that

00:54:53.210 --> 00:54:55.294
protects our right to
privacy in [? meet ?] space.

00:54:55.294 --> 00:54:55.793
Right?

00:54:55.793 --> 00:54:56.410
Our mail.

00:54:56.410 --> 00:54:57.320
Our home.

00:54:57.320 --> 00:54:59.860
If you want to see it,
great, it's due process.

00:54:59.860 --> 00:55:01.700
Let's get a warrant.

00:55:01.700 --> 00:55:04.450
That should also apply
to our digital email,

00:55:04.450 --> 00:55:06.900
or our digital mail,
and our digital space.

00:55:06.900 --> 00:55:10.110
And I hope we can connect
those dots for politicians,

00:55:10.110 --> 00:55:13.890
so that they realize that one,
that boundary needs to exist.

00:55:13.890 --> 00:55:14.730
Absolutely.

00:55:14.730 --> 00:55:15.870
Full stop.

00:55:15.870 --> 00:55:18.570
And then we can actually have an
honest, open, public discussion

00:55:18.570 --> 00:55:21.350
about how much it's all a
trade-off between security

00:55:21.350 --> 00:55:22.410
and privacy.

00:55:22.410 --> 00:55:26.930
And last I checked, this is
ostensibly still a democracy.

00:55:26.930 --> 00:55:30.360
We should have
discussions about this.

00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:31.980
We should be able
to publicly make

00:55:31.980 --> 00:55:34.240
decisions about just
how much privacy

00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:36.577
we're willing to give up
in the name of security.

00:55:36.577 --> 00:55:39.160
And so far, not only, we haven't
had those discussions at all.

00:55:39.160 --> 00:55:41.410
It's been a total cluster.

00:55:41.410 --> 00:55:43.380
It's violated all of
our rights to privacy.

00:55:43.380 --> 00:55:46.030
And we are coming up on the 12
year anniversary of the Patriot

00:55:46.030 --> 00:55:48.650
Act in a few weeks.

00:55:48.650 --> 00:55:51.830
And as a nation, we were
really worried, really

00:55:51.830 --> 00:55:54.310
scared, and made some
decisions that I think now

00:55:54.310 --> 00:55:56.800
12 years later, now that
we can all catch our breath

00:55:56.800 --> 00:56:00.730
and look at, were not in the
best interests of our rights

00:56:00.730 --> 00:56:01.750
as citizens.

00:56:01.750 --> 00:56:04.970
And I hope we can look
back at those things now.

00:56:04.970 --> 00:56:07.430
I mean, that was a Republican
President, George W. Bush

00:56:07.430 --> 00:56:09.890
that signed that
into law, and then

00:56:09.890 --> 00:56:12.420
a Democrat who has upheld them.

00:56:12.420 --> 00:56:13.850
And so, everyone
of us, regardless

00:56:13.850 --> 00:56:16.664
of our political
stripes, I believe,

00:56:16.664 --> 00:56:18.580
is really starting to
look critically at this.

00:56:18.580 --> 00:56:20.330
And I hope we get
that line drawn.

00:56:20.330 --> 00:56:21.770
Because we need it.

00:56:21.770 --> 00:56:23.590
Because we shouldn't
have CEOs having

00:56:23.590 --> 00:56:26.660
to deal with these
requests when they're not

00:56:26.660 --> 00:56:30.110
actually in the spirit
of the Constitution.

00:56:30.110 --> 00:56:35.110
So I am encouraged by the
fact that humans are always

00:56:35.110 --> 00:56:36.199
resourceful.

00:56:36.199 --> 00:56:38.740
Like, every now and then, I see
the Darknet thread bubble up,

00:56:38.740 --> 00:56:39.690
where people are
like, it's cool,

00:56:39.690 --> 00:56:41.439
we're going to make
our an internet again.

00:56:43.897 --> 00:56:45.605
Long-term, I know
humans are resourceful.

00:56:45.605 --> 00:56:46.440
It doesn't matter.

00:56:46.440 --> 00:56:48.375
Right now, how much time
and money and energy

00:56:48.375 --> 00:56:49.750
does the Chinese
government spend

00:56:49.750 --> 00:56:51.200
trying to keep people
from looking at photos

00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:52.533
of the Tenement Square Massacre?

00:56:52.533 --> 00:56:55.680
And yet still, every
day, people thanks to Tor

00:56:55.680 --> 00:56:58.340
and other pieces of software,
look at those things.

00:56:58.340 --> 00:57:00.460
We are very resourceful.

00:57:00.460 --> 00:57:02.396
And that in the
end gives me hope.

00:57:02.396 --> 00:57:04.270
I just don't want it to
have to come to that.

00:57:04.270 --> 00:57:07.100
And so in the meantime,
again, it comes back to us

00:57:07.100 --> 00:57:09.640
being active citizens, and
actually using this government

00:57:09.640 --> 00:57:14.750
that in theory represents us
to not be stupid, and actually

00:57:14.750 --> 00:57:17.004
have technologists in the room.

00:57:17.004 --> 00:57:18.170
AUDIENCE: Thanks for coming.

00:57:18.170 --> 00:57:21.110
I've really enjoyed seeing
your work on "The Verge" with--

00:57:21.110 --> 00:57:21.850
ALEXIS OHANIAN: "Small Empires."

00:57:21.850 --> 00:57:22.890
AUDIENCE: --"Small Empires."

00:57:22.890 --> 00:57:23.450
It's awesome.

00:57:23.450 --> 00:57:25.040
So I want to know
how that's going on,

00:57:25.040 --> 00:57:27.134
and where you're
going with that?

00:57:27.134 --> 00:57:28.550
ALEXIS OHANIAN:
So "Small Empires"

00:57:28.550 --> 00:57:31.409
is a show that I
do on "The Verge"

00:57:31.409 --> 00:57:32.950
to basically highlight
New York tech.

00:57:32.950 --> 00:57:34.190
And not just show
off the founders,

00:57:34.190 --> 00:57:35.720
because everyone
gets to see founders.

00:57:35.720 --> 00:57:36.940
Show off people who work there.

00:57:36.940 --> 00:57:37.060
And.

00:57:37.060 --> 00:57:39.434
More interestingly to me,
people who use these platforms.

00:57:43.400 --> 00:57:45.189
In my way, it's like
startup propaganda.

00:57:45.189 --> 00:57:47.480
I want people to watch it
and be entertained and think,

00:57:47.480 --> 00:57:48.192
holy shit.

00:57:48.192 --> 00:57:49.900
Not only can I start
one of these things,

00:57:49.900 --> 00:57:50.630
I could work there.

00:57:50.630 --> 00:57:51.879
And I can even use this thing.

00:57:51.879 --> 00:57:55.800
I'm a poet, and I can use rap
genius to annotate my art.

00:57:55.800 --> 00:57:57.961
That's an actual example.

00:57:57.961 --> 00:58:00.210
And also, of course, show
off the New York tech scene.

00:58:00.210 --> 00:58:02.540
So we have part
two of season one

00:58:02.540 --> 00:58:03.890
that just launched on Tuesday.

00:58:03.890 --> 00:58:05.470
It's going to continue through--
we've got six episodes up now.

00:58:05.470 --> 00:58:07.350
The OKCupid one
might be my favorite.

00:58:07.350 --> 00:58:08.500
It just went up.

00:58:08.500 --> 00:58:13.525
The couple on that episode will
make you feel so unromantic.

00:58:13.525 --> 00:58:14.900
Every one of you
is going to feel

00:58:14.900 --> 00:58:16.050
like you need to
step up your romance

00:58:16.050 --> 00:58:17.341
game after seeing that episode.

00:58:17.341 --> 00:58:18.879
Mark my words.

00:58:18.879 --> 00:58:19.670
But what do I hope?

00:58:19.670 --> 00:58:20.600
I hope it scales.

00:58:20.600 --> 00:58:23.350
I hope we can get it on,
I don't know, Netflix,

00:58:23.350 --> 00:58:25.820
so we get it somewhere were
a bunch more people can even

00:58:25.820 --> 00:58:26.630
see it.

00:58:26.630 --> 00:58:31.231
And a lot of people have
said, hey, come to Victoria

00:58:31.231 --> 00:58:32.480
and do a "Small Empires" here.

00:58:32.480 --> 00:58:34.849
Come to Orlando and do
a "Small Empires" here.

00:58:34.849 --> 00:58:35.890
And you know what I said?

00:58:35.890 --> 00:58:38.470
I love traveling, but I
cannot possibly do all that.

00:58:38.470 --> 00:58:40.080
I'm on a bus for the
next five months.

00:58:40.080 --> 00:58:41.210
So one of the things
we're trying to do,

00:58:41.210 --> 00:58:42.876
and I don't think
it's been done before,

00:58:42.876 --> 00:58:47.096
is I'd like to open
source the show,

00:58:47.096 --> 00:58:48.720
or license out the
show to some extent.

00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:51.000
Kind of like how TED does TEDx.

00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:53.000
I want someone to be
like, hey, listen.

00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:54.720
I want to run the show in
Victoria, British Columbia.

00:58:54.720 --> 00:58:56.230
Because we've got an
amazing startup community.

00:58:56.230 --> 00:58:57.320
We're building "Small Empires."

00:58:57.320 --> 00:58:58.420
I want to show it off.

00:58:58.420 --> 00:58:59.610
And I'll be like, cool.

00:58:59.610 --> 00:59:00.680
Here's what you need.

00:59:00.680 --> 00:59:02.110
Go forth and make awesome stuff.

00:59:02.110 --> 00:59:03.880
And like, some basic
branding guidelines.

00:59:03.880 --> 00:59:05.255
Here's how you
shoot the episode.

00:59:05.255 --> 00:59:06.540
This isn't rocket science.

00:59:06.540 --> 00:59:07.890
It's three cameras. .

00:59:07.890 --> 00:59:09.980
Four really talented people
do all the real work.

00:59:09.980 --> 00:59:11.646
And I just sit there
and talk to people.

00:59:11.646 --> 00:59:13.450
Like, it can be run
for pretty cheap.

00:59:13.450 --> 00:59:16.030
And I would love to see
"Small Empires" sprout

00:59:16.030 --> 00:59:17.320
all over the world.

00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:19.690
Because I want these
ideas to spread.

00:59:19.690 --> 00:59:21.600
I could spend a lot
of time on planes

00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:22.670
and go to a bunch of
different communities

00:59:22.670 --> 00:59:23.545
all over the country.

00:59:23.545 --> 00:59:27.140
But like, I want to see "Small
Empires, Nairobi" from someone

00:59:27.140 --> 00:59:29.470
who actually loves Nairobi
as much as I love New York.

00:59:29.470 --> 00:59:31.404
Because like, I
can love Nairobi,

00:59:31.404 --> 00:59:33.070
but not in the same
way I love New York.

00:59:33.070 --> 00:59:37.520
And like, let's let locals
show off their communities

00:59:37.520 --> 00:59:39.000
that they're proud off.

00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:40.750
Because to hell
with what I think.

00:59:40.750 --> 00:59:42.400
MALE SPEAKER:
Solutions that scale.

00:59:42.400 --> 00:59:44.151
We at Google care a
little bit about that.

00:59:44.151 --> 00:59:45.900
ALEXIS OHANIAN: Is
Google going to help me

00:59:45.900 --> 00:59:47.070
with "Small Empires?"

00:59:47.070 --> 00:59:48.820
AUDIENCE: I'm from
Orlando, so sign me up.

00:59:48.820 --> 00:59:49.945
MALE SPEAKER: There you go.

00:59:49.945 --> 00:59:52.891
ALEXIS OHANIAN: That was
not a hypothetical either.

00:59:52.891 --> 00:59:54.640
Stay tuned, man. "Small
Empires, Orlando."

00:59:54.640 --> 00:59:55.590
And I was shocked too.

00:59:55.590 --> 00:59:56.150
I was like, really?

00:59:56.150 --> 00:59:56.770
Orlando?

00:59:56.770 --> 00:59:58.190
And he was like, yeah, man.

00:59:58.190 --> 00:59:58.898
We're doing shit.

00:59:58.898 --> 01:00:00.671
It's not just Disney.

01:00:00.671 --> 01:00:03.480
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I was kind of
interested on what technologies

01:00:03.480 --> 01:00:06.250
you think are going to continue
help the growth of kind

01:00:06.250 --> 01:00:07.730
of like, an open internet?

01:00:07.730 --> 01:00:10.820
I saw the post by
Shriner yesterday

01:00:10.820 --> 01:00:15.040
about Aaron Swartz'
software finally shipped

01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:17.480
for a secure Dropbox.

01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:21.450
And I used to work
for iFixit, and all

01:00:21.450 --> 01:00:23.240
of their commentary
with press now,

01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:25.160
like the press is
actually requiring

01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:27.720
that they use PGP on
like, all of their emails,

01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:29.730
which is pretty intense.

01:00:29.730 --> 01:00:33.480
I mean, they're tech reporters
but I figure that can spread.

01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:35.390
So I'm kind of curious.

01:00:35.390 --> 01:00:38.210
PGP's old, SecureDrop's new.

01:00:38.210 --> 01:00:41.790
And I'm kind of curious like, in
the next five years, what kind

01:00:41.790 --> 01:00:45.220
of technology do we need
to keep in open internet?

01:00:45.220 --> 01:00:46.905
I mean, there's
the Darknet stuff.

01:00:46.905 --> 01:00:48.800
MALE SPEAKER: Say
the word Tor again.

01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:51.540
ALEXIS OHANIAN:
Tor, Tor, Tor, Tor.

01:00:51.540 --> 01:00:52.870
Wow.

01:00:52.870 --> 01:00:54.517
Here's what I love.

01:00:54.517 --> 01:00:56.100
The nature of
innovation is I actually

01:00:56.100 --> 01:00:57.500
don't have a fucking clue.

01:00:57.500 --> 01:00:59.330
I don't know.

01:00:59.330 --> 01:01:02.470
It seems to me that, yes, secure
file storage, secure mail,

01:01:02.470 --> 01:01:11.812
this whole Lavabit fiasco,
there is clearly even

01:01:11.812 --> 01:01:13.270
from a business
standpoint, I think

01:01:13.270 --> 01:01:14.895
there's going to be
an increased demand

01:01:14.895 --> 01:01:16.810
in an actual secure
messaging system.

01:01:16.810 --> 01:01:17.810
There's going to
be increased demand

01:01:17.810 --> 01:01:19.393
for an actually
secure storage system.

01:01:19.393 --> 01:01:23.384
And it sounds like we're
working towards getting that.

01:01:23.384 --> 01:01:25.800
I would hate to see a sort of
Balkanization that comes out

01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:28.000
of the internet because of this.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.375
Just even the
standpoint of like,

01:01:29.375 --> 01:01:31.160
there are going to be
people who are going

01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:33.804
to look twice at
using a service.

01:01:33.804 --> 01:01:35.470
Let's say it's an
American company who's

01:01:35.470 --> 01:01:37.070
servers are here in the States.

01:01:37.070 --> 01:01:39.134
MALE SPEAKER: Let's say.

01:01:39.134 --> 01:01:40.800
ALEXIS OHANIAN: That's
terrifying to me.

01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:42.620
If I'm putting on
my businessman hat,

01:01:42.620 --> 01:01:43.910
I'm like, that's terrifying.

01:01:43.910 --> 01:01:48.200
We lead the world, essentially,
in the internet economy.

01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:49.560
Like, the world is using Google.

01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:50.610
I generalizing here.

01:01:50.610 --> 01:01:52.850
But like, there are
not a lot of industries

01:01:52.850 --> 01:01:56.530
left where the United States
is sort of king of the roost.

01:01:56.530 --> 01:01:58.790
And that is not guaranteed.

01:01:58.790 --> 01:02:01.040
It is not guaranteed
in any industry,

01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:04.910
but especially one that
is as competitive and fast

01:02:04.910 --> 01:02:07.630
to grow as the
internet, as online.

01:02:07.630 --> 01:02:10.750
And I worry that if we
aren't building these things

01:02:10.750 --> 01:02:12.090
ourselves, someone else will.

01:02:12.090 --> 01:02:14.120
And before long, the
next big thing pops up,

01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:17.840
and it's in Rakovic, or it's
in Berlin, or go down the list,

01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:22.470
where the laws are there that
uphold the kind of privacy

01:02:22.470 --> 01:02:24.192
rights that I wish
we had in the States.

01:02:24.192 --> 01:02:26.150
Well, that we ostensibly
do have in the States,

01:02:26.150 --> 01:02:27.840
but aren't actually
being enforced.

01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:28.340
So, yeah.

01:02:28.340 --> 01:02:29.660
There are business
opportunities here.

01:02:29.660 --> 01:02:31.243
And you guys are
lots of smart people.

01:02:31.243 --> 01:02:34.900
I say, I hope my book
does not necessarily

01:02:34.900 --> 01:02:37.590
inspire you to go leave
Google and start a company.

01:02:37.590 --> 01:02:39.660
Because you guys have
been such wonderful hosts.

01:02:39.660 --> 01:02:41.159
MALE SPEAKER: I was
looking in here.

01:02:41.159 --> 01:02:44.540
I seem to remember a line in
here about the only people

01:02:44.540 --> 01:02:46.300
to go to Google are--

01:02:46.300 --> 01:02:48.840
ALEXIS OHANIAN: Are waiting
until they get the right idea

01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:50.215
to go start a startup.

01:02:50.215 --> 01:02:51.090
That's what they are.

01:02:53.994 --> 01:02:55.450
MALE SPEAKER: Sure.

01:02:55.450 --> 01:02:57.283
AUDIENCE: I have to
give a little background

01:02:57.283 --> 01:03:00.920
for this question, so I'll try
not to take up too much time.

01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:02.770
Early last year,
I was in college.

01:03:02.770 --> 01:03:04.740
I just graduated from
Brown University.

01:03:04.740 --> 01:03:10.840
And someone I new named Sunil
Tripathi had disappeared.

01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:12.940
And no one knew if he
had committed suicide.

01:03:12.940 --> 01:03:14.273
No one knew if he was kidnapped.

01:03:16.545 --> 01:03:18.420
No one really had known
what happened to him.

01:03:18.420 --> 01:03:20.980
So take a step like,
a couple months

01:03:20.980 --> 01:03:24.440
to April, when the Boston
Marathon bombings happened.

01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:31.110
So no one had found this
missing student at Brown.

01:03:31.110 --> 01:03:36.934
And Reddit led this massive
manhunt to try-- well,

01:03:36.934 --> 01:03:38.850
there was a massive
manhunt around the country

01:03:38.850 --> 01:03:41.210
to find the Boston
Marathon Bomber.

01:03:41.210 --> 01:03:44.810
There was chaos everywhere,
and Reddit had kind of

01:03:44.810 --> 01:03:49.060
formed this mob mentality, where
they thought that this missing

01:03:49.060 --> 01:03:51.620
student from Brown was one of
the Boston Marathon bombers.

01:03:51.620 --> 01:03:53.240
And I was at the
college at the time,

01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:55.940
so I saw like the real,
direct harm it was causing.

01:03:55.940 --> 01:03:57.800
His family was shattered.

01:03:57.800 --> 01:04:01.270
I wasn't particularly close with
him, but I knew his girlfriend.

01:04:01.270 --> 01:04:03.730
And she was just, I don't know.

01:04:03.730 --> 01:04:07.230
She was just completely
stunned by the whole ordeal.

01:04:07.230 --> 01:04:10.650
But this is the background
for my question.

01:04:10.650 --> 01:04:14.510
Various forms of media have
always had checks and balances

01:04:14.510 --> 01:04:19.440
for free speech, like
print media, like libel.

01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:22.160
You can't print
libelous information.

01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:22.720
Right?

01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:24.820
So I guess, how do
you mitigate the power

01:04:24.820 --> 01:04:27.450
of the open, free
internet with its ability

01:04:27.450 --> 01:04:29.315
to do harm to people?

01:04:29.315 --> 01:04:30.690
ALEXIS OHANIAN:
Traditional media

01:04:30.690 --> 01:04:33.830
has gotten it wrong in the past.

01:04:33.830 --> 01:04:35.580
I mean, even after the
Navy Yard shooting,

01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:38.860
CBS and NBC
misidentified someone

01:04:38.860 --> 01:04:40.240
who was involved in the attack.

01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:45.700
This is to say, humans are
themselves the problem,

01:04:45.700 --> 01:04:47.961
whether they are trained
professional journalists

01:04:47.961 --> 01:04:48.460
or not.

01:04:51.890 --> 01:04:53.290
There is no good
answer for this.

01:04:53.290 --> 01:04:56.930
Because yes, there was
a particular subreddit

01:04:56.930 --> 01:04:59.760
which had maybe 1,000
people using it that

01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:03.410
was responding to an FBI
request to help track the Boston

01:05:03.410 --> 01:05:04.260
bombers.

01:05:04.260 --> 01:05:07.030
And they misidentified someone.

01:05:07.030 --> 01:05:09.380
"The New York Times" did a
very thorough investigation

01:05:09.380 --> 01:05:12.170
in the Sunday magazine
about what happened.

01:05:12.170 --> 01:05:14.170
And it turned out
that a journalist

01:05:14.170 --> 01:05:16.740
had tweeted that Reddit post.

01:05:16.740 --> 01:05:20.160
A journalist, a professional
journalist, had tweeted it out.

01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:21.680
And then, it got re-tweeted.

01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:23.480
Even Perez Hilton joined in.

01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:25.540
And that spun it out of control.

01:05:25.540 --> 01:05:32.430
So there are lots of humans
responsible for this.

01:05:32.430 --> 01:05:38.530
And at the end of
the day, there just

01:05:38.530 --> 01:05:41.990
is not an easy answer for this.

01:05:41.990 --> 01:05:45.740
If one journalist draws
attention to a random Reddit

01:05:45.740 --> 01:05:48.690
thread, and it gets picked up,
and "The New York Post" decides

01:05:48.690 --> 01:05:55.420
to put it on their front
page, how after the fact can

01:05:55.420 --> 01:06:01.522
we actually say, what--
and this goes back

01:06:01.522 --> 01:06:03.730
to being the gift and the
curse of the open platform.

01:06:03.730 --> 01:06:04.813
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE].

01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:10.320
ALEXIS OHANIAN: It's an awful,
awful thing that happened.

01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:15.421
And unfortunately,
there's no easy solution

01:06:15.421 --> 01:06:16.170
for the next time.

01:06:16.170 --> 01:06:19.510
I mean, every one of
those trained journalists,

01:06:19.510 --> 01:06:24.600
even the one who re-tweeted
that Reddit thread may

01:06:24.600 --> 01:06:25.450
make mistakes.

01:06:25.450 --> 01:06:27.840
And now we've given an
opportunity for anyone

01:06:27.840 --> 01:06:29.820
with a connection
to have a soapbox.

01:06:29.820 --> 01:06:31.310
And they're going
to make mistakes.

01:06:31.310 --> 01:06:36.160
And so in response,
Reddit has sort of

01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:38.530
to the best of its
ability now sort of said,

01:06:38.530 --> 01:06:40.680
no more of these
kinds of witch hunts.

01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:43.740
You can't create a subreddit to
try to identify the Navy Yard

01:06:43.740 --> 01:06:46.650
shooter, or any other person
who the FBI or someone wants

01:06:46.650 --> 01:06:48.350
to track down.

01:06:48.350 --> 01:06:50.480
But the reality is, they'll
just do it on Twitter.

01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:50.670
Right?

01:06:50.670 --> 01:06:52.050
That's what happened during
the Navy Yard shooting.

01:06:52.050 --> 01:06:53.341
They just do it all on Twitter.

01:06:53.341 --> 01:06:58.240
And people are unfortunately,
as they have always

01:06:58.240 --> 01:06:59.830
been, capable of
being, even when

01:06:59.830 --> 01:07:02.530
they have the best of
intentions, being wrong.

01:07:02.530 --> 01:07:05.530
And it is a challenge
that will always

01:07:05.530 --> 01:07:06.980
exist as long as we have people.

01:07:06.980 --> 01:07:09.080
And once we have
sentient robots,

01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:10.090
they'll just enslave us.

01:07:10.090 --> 01:07:12.490
So like, I don't know.

01:07:12.490 --> 01:07:16.330
There's no easy answer.

01:07:16.330 --> 01:07:19.110
I'm happy with
response Reddit took.

01:07:19.110 --> 01:07:22.360
But I just know that in a world
with social media, whether it's

01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:24.420
a journalist or
Joe Six-pack, it's

01:07:24.420 --> 01:07:25.810
probably going to happen again.

01:07:28.102 --> 01:07:28.810
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

01:07:28.810 --> 01:07:30.010
Well, I wanted to say thanks.

01:07:30.010 --> 01:07:31.093
Thanks a bunch for coming.

01:07:31.093 --> 01:07:33.000
And once again, plug the book.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:33.627
Go read it.

01:07:33.627 --> 01:07:34.960
It's available right over there.

01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:37.940
And thank you, Alexis,
for joining us.

01:07:37.940 --> 01:07:44.257
