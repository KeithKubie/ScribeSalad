KeyMe allows you to instantly make duplicate
copies of your keys by storing a digital copy

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.700
of your keys so you never get locked out again....
and it'll open your beer

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.379
And the Marshall Dicycle is an electric motorcycle
concept that doubles as amplifiers when instruments

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:15.879
are plugged in.

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:22.029
Vsauce! Kevin here - this is Mind Blow.

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:28.779
The cafe latte printer allows customers to
drink their own face. Let's Cafe - is a kiosk

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:33.780
in taiwanese convenience stores that is offering
customers the opportunity to print any picture

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.050
taken from their phone instantly onto the
top of their latte. It works by dusting the

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:47.210
image with an edible powder with a computer-controlled
print head.

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.670
The LiveMap helmet was created by russian
inventors to make a motorcycle helmet with

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:58.320
built in navigation. The helmet creates translucent
full color images and text in the visor giving

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.300
the rider the ability to check speed, time,
and get directions without taking their eyes

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.390
off the road like traditional navigation.
It's only slightly larger than a normal helmet

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.190
and adjusts depending on the lighting outside.
If the indiegogo amount is achieved they plan

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.290
to sell them for around $2000.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.090
Researchers at North Carolina State University
have created a device that controls cockroaches

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:25.140
using an Xbox Kinect. They created an interface
that sends the roach on a predetermined track

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:31.100
by using a computer to plot its course. Researchers
wire sensors to the roach's external sensory

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.110
organs causing it to move forward and small
charges in the neural tissue tricks the roach

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.420
into thinking its antennae are hitting a barrier
causing it to turn.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:46.380
Scientists in Japan cloned this mouse from
only a drop of blood of the donors tail!

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.500
Tokyoflash created the Kisai watch that lets
users know whether or not they are intoxicated

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.170
through the use of a built in breathalyzer.
By blowing into a hole located in the side

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.490
of the watch for five seconds the watch glows
green if it detects no alcohol, yellow if

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.450
alcohol is detected but you are in the legal
limit, and red if you are legally drunk. The

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.590
watch also has a built in sobriety test that
asks the user to stop a moving line at a certain

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.390
point on the screen.

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.310
Sensoria are a pair of socks that are able
to track the way people walk. Developed by

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.670
Heapsylon, by using a bluetooth enabled anklet
in conjunction with the socks the sensors

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.940
in the socks transmit the data to a computer
or smartphone. Sensoria can determine improper

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:33.160
walking or running habits or if the foot is
landing at an unsafe angle during particular

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.360
activities.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:41.910
WI-Vi is a prototype handheld device that
researchers at MIT have created in order to

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.660
see through walls. Users will be able to point
the device at walls and see anything moving

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.730
on the other side. WiVi works by emitting
wifi signals at the wall where some of those

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:58.290
signals bounce off of the moving objects on
the other side and back to the device. Wivi

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.680
could be used in multiple applications including
aiding police and rescue workers or creating

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.360
verybetter motion controlled gaming systems.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.880
Archaeologists have recently discovered that
flowers have been used at funerals for 13,000

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:12.900
years.

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.040
This self-burying robot was presented by the
Carnegie Mellon University Robotics Institute

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:25.000
in May of 2013. The plans to use self burying
robots range from mining to military applications.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.980
This robot is able to travel to its location
in one mode and then bury itself in another.

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:35.040
Shown in this video digging through various
things such as rice, sand, flour, and sugar,

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.530
but it's still in the developmental stages
and they're trying to make more efficient

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:39.540
versions.

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.840
This bike helmet is made from recycled paper
pulp. It was created by students from the

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.630
Royal College of Art in London by making a
pulp out of old newspapers they mixed with

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:53.530
an adhesive, pigment, and organic additive.
They claim to be rain proof for up to six

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.540
hours and can be recycled again after being
used to make more helmets. Though wearing

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.770
these may be better than no protection it's
still unclear the actual safety of the helmets.

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:09.430
The Termes Project is developing self-organizing
simple robots building 3-D structures. Based

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:14.340
upon the building abilities of termites - the
robot is able to navigate, lift blocks and

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:19.100
build structures much larger than itself and
the researchers at Harvard University are

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.440
looking into ways to further develop automated
construction.

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:27.370
Finally, Minsu Kim's Living food project is
a concept involving food that moves on the

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:37.620
plate and in your mouth by building on developments
in synthetic biology.

00:04:37.620 --> 00:05:19.620
I'm going to leave you with a barrel of ping
pong balls on fire. And as always - thanks

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:58.150
for watching.
