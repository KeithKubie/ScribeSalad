00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:05.800
We would not have been able to survive so
long if we were not able, at points, to get

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:12.451
very worried indeed; if we didn’t possess
a native genius for flooding our minds, at

00:00:12.451 --> 00:00:17.900
astonishing speed, with a cocktail of the
most intense and panicky hormones our bodies

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:25.489
can secrete. And yet our capacity to keep
surviving – or at least, and as importantly,

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:31.749
to draw some enjoyment from what remains of
life – depends on something quite contrary

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:40.350
and even more challenging: an ability at points
to unpanic ourselves, to wind down the alarm

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.920
and clear the bloodstream of catastrophic
foreboding: a mastery of the delicate art

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:56.520
of unworrying. Many of us belong within a
damnable category known as hypervigilant – that

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.999
is, we are not merely ordinarily careful and
on the look out for our safety, as we should

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:11.070
be, but outright panicked and alarmed pretty
much all the time. We, in the unhappy hypervigilant

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:18.260
camp, wake up terrified, spend the day in
low-level dread and exist in near certainty

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:24.900
that something appalling will fell us. At
points, it’s so tiring, it’s normal that

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:32.490
we may long for it all to be over – though
that too is a dreadful prospect. The reasons

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.360
why are like this are always somewhat the
same. At some point, long before we could

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:46.040
cope, we were frightened very badly indeed,
so badly, we have never really recovered a

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:52.310
faith in the solidity of anything. Something
so challenging unfolded, it has jammed our

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:58.620
minds in a state of alarm, even when the outward
conditions have changed and when there is,

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:04.160
in the objective sense (as kindly friends
like to tell us), nothing in particular to

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:11.670
be terrified of. Perhaps someone was very
angry in the vicinity. Perhaps we were humiliated

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:18.310
and made to feel unwanted and sinful. Maybe
an older sibling tortured us. Perhaps we got

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:24.440
sent away to an institution where we were
appallingly isolated. In response, our level

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:31.390
of panic hormones spiked – and never came
down. Now our hypervigilance scrambles the

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:38.390
part of the mind that regulates basic functions
like sleep, digestion and touch – and so,

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:45.100
a telling symptom is that it will almost certainly
be difficult for us to rest, to manage our

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:51.910
bowels or to be wholly at ease being touched
by a fellow human, however much we long to

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:59.750
be. There is no easy cure, but it is the start
of something to have at least a name to put

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:06.640
to the chaos. A degree of compassion can start
up too. We can start to notice how much of

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:13.150
life has been held together by fear. We have
a concept that links why it’s so hard to

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:20.880
go to parties, trust a lover, relax on holiday,
go to the bathroom or sleep much past 4am.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:27.290
Image result for agnes martin We might dare
to tell a few others about our hypervigilance,

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:34.320
handing them the word like a gift, a clue
to our particular brokenness. Every time we

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:40.959
find a kindly other to whom we can safely
entrust news of our state, and who can smile

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:47.600
tenderly in response, the panic goes down
and the world becomes ever so slightly more

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:54.400
bearable. But sometimes, when we are alone
and the pressures mount once more, we may

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:00.910
simply have to stand back and observe the
hypervigilance do its thing: smash our plans

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:07.360
and hopes, and unleash panic in a way that
will knock us out for the day or the month.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:14.870
We should forgive ourselves. This is a disease
like any other. What can be hardest, but most

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:22.580
important, to believe is that being an adult
means having options. We can push back against

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:29.389
bullies, move away when it gets too much and
tell others what we need from them. We don’t

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:36.759
need to be hypervigilant because we have the
option of true vigilance: if there were to

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:42.490
be real dangers, we would now have the inner
resources to greet and fight them in good

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:50.870
time. We can worry when we need to, not just
because we exist. In the meantime, we should

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:57.210
allow ourselves – with this strange, slightly
ugly word in hand – to feel sorry for our

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:06.210
desperate impulses and strive, where we can,
at 4.35am perhaps, to turn over and get a

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.000
little more rest.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:24.000
We can learn the skill of being calm,  not through special teas or slow breathing.  But through thinking.  Our book guides us through that process.
