00:00:00.208 --> 00:00:03.708
â™ª [upbeat music plays] 

00:00:03.708 --> 00:00:06.333
Chris Haseman: So the app we're presenting
today is our media player, DoubleTwist.

00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:08.667
And so, initially we were
just a desktop application.

00:00:08.667 --> 00:00:14.458
And our desktop application would sync
any file in any format to any device.

00:00:14.458 --> 00:00:15.667
As we progressed, 

00:00:15.667 --> 00:00:19.708
we realized that Android was a huge
opportunity to bring that vision

00:00:19.708 --> 00:00:23.375
and that need that we think, we thought
we could fill to a much larger audience.

00:00:23.375 --> 00:00:25.958
Jason LeBrun: A lot of our product
is based around getting your media

00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:28.333
from your computer onto your phone.

00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:29.917
And since then,
we've been expanding.

00:00:29.917 --> 00:00:33.125
And we just really wanna provide
a premium media experience.

00:00:33.125 --> 00:00:35.000
Chris Haseman: So the feature that
we added for the conference--

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.250
this conference in particular--

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.292
is a tap-to-share application.

00:00:38.292 --> 00:00:42.833
Using the Near Field Communication
radio in both of the two devices.

00:00:42.833 --> 00:00:45.917
You tap together while a media,
a piece of media is playing

00:00:45.917 --> 00:00:49.333
and the NFC negotiates a pairing
between the two phones

00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:52.250
and the media is shared
across the two devices.

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:53.708
It works on Wi-Fi,

00:00:53.708 --> 00:00:56.167
if the Wi-Fi is available and
it also will use Bluetooth

00:00:56.167 --> 00:00:58.417
if there's no network available.

00:00:58.417 --> 00:01:01.125
And it lets you share audio
or video with anybody

00:01:01.125 --> 00:01:03.292
who has an NFC capable phone.

00:01:03.292 --> 00:01:05.583
Jason LeBrun: One of the things I really
like about working with Android

00:01:05.583 --> 00:01:07.458
is it's a very flexible platform, 

00:01:07.458 --> 00:01:12.167
but there's also a huge ecosystem
and it's a very diverse ecosystem,

00:01:12.167 --> 00:01:15.125
because there are constantly
these new devices coming out.

00:01:15.125 --> 00:01:17.708
There's all these innovative features
that are always popping up.

00:01:17.708 --> 00:01:20.500
Chris Haseman: The more people that we
can bring on board with our application,

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.917
the more we grow our ecosystem

00:01:21.917 --> 00:01:24.792
and the better we can make
our application.

00:01:24.792 --> 00:01:25.667
Jason LeBrun: So, if someone told me

00:01:25.667 --> 00:01:28.500
they were thinking about developing
on the Android platform,

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.167
my first question would be,

00:01:30.167 --> 00:01:31.417
"You're just now thinking of that?"

00:01:31.417 --> 00:01:34.583
Because, I mean, at this point,
it's an obvious choice.
