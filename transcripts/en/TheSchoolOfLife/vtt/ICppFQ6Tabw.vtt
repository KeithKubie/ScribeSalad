00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.300
Max Weber is one of the philosophers

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.180
best able to explain to us

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:15.200
the peculiar economic system we live within called capitalism.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.740
Born Erfurt in Germany in 1864,

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:23.040
Weber grew up to see his country
convulsed by the dramatic changes of the Industrial Revolution.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.060
Cities were exploding in size.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:26.700
Vast companies were forming.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.300
A new managerial elite was replacing the old aristocracy.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.020
Weber spent his life analyzing these changes

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.720
and he developed some key ideas with which we can better understand

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.220
the workings and future of
capitalism.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.300
The standard view is that capitalism began

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.079
as a result of developments in
technology especially steam power.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.960
But Weber proposed something more
interesting that what actually made capitalism possible

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.820
was a set of ideas

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.280
and in particular religious ideas

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.460
and not just any religious ideas.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.860
Capitalism was created by Protestantism,
specifically Calvinism.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.140
In his great work The Protestant Ethic and The Spirit of Capitalism, published in 1905,

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.200
Weber laid out some of the reasons why he believed Protestant Christianity

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.600
had been so crucial to capitalism.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.960
In Weber's analysis Catholics have it relatively easy.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.420
They were able to confess their
transgressions at regular intervals

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.760
and can be cleansed by priests.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.880
But no such purifications are available to Protestants

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.060
who believe that only god is able to forgive anyone

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.600
and he won't make his intentions known until the day of judgment.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.660
Until then Weber alleged Protestants are left with
heightened feelings of anxiety

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:50.240
as well as lifelong guilty desires to prove
their virtue to a severe all-seeing but silent god.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.640
In Weber's eyes Protestant feelings of guilt were
diverted into an obsession with hard work.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.900
This was what he called the Protestant
work ethic.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.900
The sins of Adam could only be expunged through constant toil.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.940
Not coincidentally there were far fewer festivals and days of rest in Protestantism.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.380
God didn't like time off.

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.780
Catholics had limited their conception
of holy work to the activities of

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.610
priests, monks and nuns

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.540
but now Protestants declared that work of any kind could be done in the name of God

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.140
even jobs like being a baker or an
accountant.

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:34.830
This lent new moral energy and
earnestness to all branches of professional life.

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.380
In Catholic countries the family was and
often still is everything.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.280
But Protestants took a less benevolent
view of family.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.840
The family could be a haven for selfish and egoistic motives.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:54.220
For early Protestants one was meant to direct one's selfless energies to the community as a whole,

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.180
the public realm, where everyone deserved fairness and dignity.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.980
Protestantism and eventually scientific capitalism turned its back on miracles.

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.560
Weber called this the disenchantment of the world.

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.740
So prosperity wasn't to be thought of as
something mysteriously ordained by God,

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.940
it could only be the result of thinking
methodically, acting honestly,

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.780
and working industriously and sensibly
over many years.

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:22.640
Without a belief in miracles

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.590
people turn to science for explanations and changes

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.210
which encouraged scientific investigation and discovery

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:30.680
and eventually technological booms.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.760
Taken together these five factors
created, in Weber's eyes,

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:38.490
the crucial catalytic ingredients for
capitalism to take hold.

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.440
Marx had argued that religion was the
opium of the masses,

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.340
a drug that induced passive acceptance of the horrors of capitalism.

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.980
But Weber turned this dictum on its head.

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:52.230
People didn't tolerate capitalism
because of religion.

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.830
They only became capitalists as a result
of their religion.

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:05.080
There are about 35 countries where
capitalism is now well developed.

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.780
It probably works best in Germany where
Weber first observed it.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.420
But in the remaining 161 nations it arguably isn't working very well at all.

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.040
This is a source of much puzzlement and 
distress.

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.460
Billions of dollars in aid are transferred every year from the rich to the poor parts of the world.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.760
But a Weberian analysis tells us that these materialist interventions will never work

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.940
because the problem isn't really a material one to begin with

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:36.460
Instead certain countries for Weber fail to succeed at capitalism because they don't feel anxious and guilty enough.

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.320
They trust too much in miracles.

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.370
They like to celebrate now rather than
invest in tomorrow

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.390
and their members feel it's acceptable to steal from the community

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:48.470
in order to enrich their families favoring the clan over the
nation.

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.340
Today, Weber would counsel those who wish to spread capitalism

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.780
to concentrate on our equivalent of religion -- culture.

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:59.590
It's a nation's attitudes hopes and a
sense of what life is about

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.350
that produces an economy that either
flourishes or flounders.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.900
To reduce poverty, Weber would say one has to start at the level of ideas.

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:11.590
What the World Bank and the IMF should
be giving sub-saharan Africa

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:16.510
is not, in a Weberian analysis, money and technology but a new outlook.

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:22.440
The decisive question for an economy should not be what the rate of inflation is but what's on TV tonight.

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.320
Weber was writing in an age of revolution.

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.170
He, too, wanted things to change

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:35.330
but he believed that one first had to work out how political power operated.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.000
Weber believed that humanity had gone through three distinct types of power.

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:44.120
The older societies operated according
to what he called traditional authority

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:48.110
where kings relied on folklore and
divinity to justify their power.

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:51.230
Then came the age of charismatic authority

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:54.270
where a heroic individual, most famously Napoleon,

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.610
could rise to power with a magnetic personality

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:59.130
and change everything through passion and will.

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:04.730
However, Weber explained that we had now entered a third age of bureaucratic authority.

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:07.880
Bureaucracy achieves its power via knowledge.

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:10.620
Only the bureaucrats know how stuff works

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:13.340
and it will take an outsider years to work it out.

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:17.330
Most of us simply give up, usefully for
the powers that be.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:22.440
The dominance of bureaucracy has major implications for anyone trying to change a nation.

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:27.620
There is often an understandable but
misguided desire to think that one just has to change the leader.

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:32.080
But in fact removing a leader almost never has the degree of impact that is hoped for.

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:35.460
If we're to get things to go better much
of it will have to come through

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:39.360
outwardly rather undramatic bureaucratic processes.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:44.000
It will come through the marshalling of statistical evidence, patient briefings to ministers,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.580
testimonies to committee hearings, and a minute study of budgets.

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:52.580
Weber tells us how power works now and reminds us that ideas may be far more important

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:55.480
than tools or money in changing nations.

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.000
It's a hugely significant thesis.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.740
With Weber's guidance we learn that so much which we associate with vast, impersonal, external forces

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:09.140
is, in fact, dependent upon something utterly intimate and perhaps more malleable:

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:11.540
the thoughts in our own heads.
