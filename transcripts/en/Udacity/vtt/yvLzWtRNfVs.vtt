00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.548
Some classes in the OMS
program have proctored exams.

00:00:03.548 --> 00:00:06.140
A proctored exam is similar to one
you would take in the classroom.

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.740
No books, no notes, no resources,
just you and the test.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.610
Now, of course, in a classroom,
that's easy to do.

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.350
There is a teacher watching.

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:17.490
Online, it's not so easy, so we use a
tool called Proctortrack, which provides

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.290
automatic proctoring using cutting
edge AI and computer vision.

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:22.540
And that's fascinating to me.

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.770
We're using AI and
computer vision to deliver a program

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.910
where you'll learn about AI and
computer vision.

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:30.530
&gt;&gt; To access Proctortrack,

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:35.620
you'll go to testing.verificient.com
as you see up here.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.480
When you first take a class
that has a proctored exam,

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.510
a Proctortrack account will
be created for you here.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.860
And you'll get the password
in your email.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.240
Using that login name and
password, click here to log in.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.390
After logging in,
you'll be back at the home page.

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.610
Click View Tests to view
the tests available to you.

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.810
Generally, the first time you log in,
you should see an onboarding test.

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.510
Click Continue to open
the onboarding test.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.950
Then walk through the steps to install
the software on your computer for

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:08.720
the first time and
experience what proctoring is like.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.120
When you have an upcoming test,
it will be listed here as well.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.760
&gt;&gt; Note that even after you've
taken the onboarding test,

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.800
it will continue to appear here just in
case you need to set up the software on

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.350
a new computer in the future.

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.960
And as with other tools we use,
Proctortrack may change over time.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:24.760
So check the notes below

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.810
this video to see if there's
anything new to be aware of.
