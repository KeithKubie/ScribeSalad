This video is brought to you by Dollar Shave Club

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:04.980
Hey guys I'm Nate welcome back to the workshop today

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.710
We're going to be trying an experiment that I've wanted to do for quite a while

00:00:07.809 --> 00:00:12.059
We're going to use electricity to see if we can engrave or etched steel although

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.129
I think this idea has been done by a lot of people

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.670
I got the idea from watching a channel called the art of weapons check the link below

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:22.649
The basic idea is that you can use a low voltage direct current and a little bit of salt water or vinegar

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:28.649
to engrave or etched into steel we have a few different varieties of this setup that we're gonna try and see which one works the

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.559
Best I have a couple different types of Steel that I want to try a flat carbon steel bar and this stainless steel cup

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.700
In order to make the designs a little more detailed than just drawing with a q-tip

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.789
You can use masks to carefully outline where you want the etching to go. There are a few different types of masks

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.000
I'm going to try

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.700
Electrical tape nail polish and a sticker and then finally there are two different ways

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.789
I'm going to try applying the electricity the first is just using some 9-volt batteries and connecting directly to those

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.180
The second source of electricity is this AC to DC adapter?

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.899
Which I'm going to use to let me have a constant stream of electricity straight from the outlet

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:10.169
I've also seen people attempting this using a car battery charger, which should do mostly the same thing as this AC to DC adapter

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.790
Which is to put out a constant stream of 12 volt electricity at approximately 1 amp?

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.799
Let's start out by testing our high carbon steel bar to be sure we have a nice clean and non

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:26.009
Oxidized surface to work with let's get some high grit sandpaper and just go over this whole bar that will remove any oxidation or grease

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.009
That may be on the surface of the seal

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:40.240
Let's use some electrical tape to mask off areas that we don't want to engrave this wood here closely to the steel so we shouldn't

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.960
Have to worry about any of the water

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.550
seeping underneath the tape

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.480
There's a line right here that kind of looks like it's exposed steel

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.469
But it's actually just a very edge of the electrical tape and it has a little bit of dust on it

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.520
So it's white, but in truth the steel is not exposed right there at all now

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.719
let's take an exacto knife and carefully cut out the pattern that we want to engrave on to the steel I

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.149
Think I've successfully cut out the shape that I want now

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.350
I'll peel off the electrical tape on the inside where I want it and great

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:18.279
Supposed to sort of be a little flame not sure how much it really looks like one, but it'll still work really well for testing

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.070
There we go got the two cut out

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.849
I'm just gonna press down to make sure the tape is really nicely attached especially

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.320
There's little bits that point down into the shape. I don't want those accidentally peeling off

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.880
Now let's take out one of our batteries and connect it to our alligator clips

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.550
Attach our black to the negative terminal and the red one to the positive terminal

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.940
These little alligator clips should be available at most hardware stores. I got this set at Harbor Freight for about three bucks

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.449
I have here a small dish with a little bit of water in it. Let's just add some salt

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.610
Now we take the lead on our positive terminal and we attach that to the metal now

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:03.580
Let's take a cotton swab dip it quickly into the saltwater and attach it to the lead on the negative terminal our two experiments are

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.499
Going to be with salt water and vinegar to see which one works better. I've heard both can give good results

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.110
Actually here at doing something

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.619
There are tiny tiny little bubbles

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:22.988
Forming on this I saw a little wisp of smoke there, too

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.870
You know

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.870
Keep painting over it

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.210
You can definitely see the bubbling going on

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.410
gross

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.910
That's all just like edged away steel that has built up on the cotton swab

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.570
I'm gonna use the other end of this cotton swab to sort of clean it off a little bit

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.910
And get a new one and keep going over it again

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.949
We're just gonna take a quick break and talk about the sponsors for this video Dollar Shave Club

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:54.919
If you're like me and hate paying the weirdly high prices for men's grooming products now is a great time to try out Dollar Shave

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:01.220
Club
For a limited time Dollar Shave Club has a really good deal going on for their starter kit for only 5 bucks for new members

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.820
This starter kit has their

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:09.439
executive razor and 3 trial sized versions of their most popular products their shave butter the body wash and one wipe Charlies

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:14.389
Butt wipes I really like these cartridges that have 6 blades on the front and the single blade on the back

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:16.130
I've been using these blades for a while

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:21.230
And they do a really good job of giving you a nice clean shave and precision grooming lines to get this off for a while

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:22.800
It's available go to

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.150

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.019
King of random or click the link in the description below

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.379
Alright that seems to be working pretty well

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.219
I'm gonna try it with vinegar on the other one and see if we get any results

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.930
The cotton swab

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.459
dip it into vinegar attach it to the negative lead terminal I

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.260
Don't hear anything with the salt water it started kind of making a bubbling noise

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:54.229
I'm getting a little bit of discoloration on the cotton swab from where the alligator clip is biting into it

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:58.189
It's not doing anything on our carbon steel bar

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.630
Our carbon steel bar did not seem affected when we tested it with the vinegar

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:07.399
But it seemed to go pretty quickly when we used it with the salt water. Let's take off the tape and check the result

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.320
disconnect I

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.469
Would get a clip from my power source

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.739
You off the tape and see how it looks underneath

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:21.309
All right, so where we had the vinegar there

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:26.769
Might be a slight discoloration. You can see the lines going around but for the most part

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:30.399
That's just where the knife cut through the tape you can see that

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.270
It'll just mark it if I

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:33.830
Don't even have tape there

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:39.820
So we have the outline of where I cut and it might look a little bit less shiny where I had the vinegar

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:46.209
But I can't tell if it's changed much however with the salt water it really did something very visible and in fact

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:48.790
There's even a little bit of a lip

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.730
Where the metal has actually been worn away?

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:55.209
That is a very very different look right there

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:00.429
So salt water works great with a nivel battery

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:04.209
Vinegar on the carbon steel not so much

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:08.919
The salt water powered by a nine volt battery was doing a really good job of engraving the steel

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:11.589
I want to see what happens though if I take a second battery

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:17.799
Connect the two together and then attach the leads to the battery like this will the additional power make it engrave faster

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.679
Let's find out red to the positive terminal

00:06:21.229 --> 00:06:23.229
black to the negative terminal

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.090
I'm going to do a slightly simpler design this time. I'm just going to cut out a square

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:32.979
Because a square should test. How well it works just as well as a fire

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:42.609
Attach our positive lead to our steel a little bit of salt water on our q-tip and attach it to the negative lead

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:45.520
Now using two batteries. Let's see how well this works

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:49.960
Certain live seeing something

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:55.419
It's getting the q-tip dirtier much faster, so I think that means it's working better at least faster

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:59.949
I don't know faster is necessarily better in this situation, but feel like it is

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:05.740
My that's uh

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:08.500
There's a lot of bubbling action right there

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:10.880
alright, I

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:15.519
Think that is enough I can take off our tape and see how it's doing

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:26.859
Think it off a little bit with another cotton swab here, I would say that is definitely engraved

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:30.190
Right up to the edges here

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:32.920
There is a very clear lip

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:38.529
Where the steel has dropped down it's a very small amount I'd say probably a fraction of a millimeter

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:42.250
But it's nothing you know we can catch the blade very easily

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:46.480
I think I can they even threw my gloves. I can feel it with my fingers and fingernails

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:51.699
Well, I would say that two batteries definitely works faster than one battery, which should be no surprise

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:54.550
If one is working two is gonna. Have more power running into it

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:59.980
I don't know if it's necessarily a good thing it does seem to be a little harder to control and give a little bit more

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:01.550
of a splotchy result

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:06.069
Maybe I just need to be more careful about moving the cotton swab quickly so it doesn't stay in one place too long

00:08:06.470 --> 00:08:08.050
The battery differently works now

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:10.050
I want to try moving on to our AC to DC

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:15.609
Adapter if you're like me you might have several of these floating around your house somewhere with no idea what they go to or if

00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:18.940
You don't have any you can often pick them up at a thrift store for just a couple of bucks

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:21.640
Failing that they're also available on Amazon

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:26.529
what you want to look out for is one that says that it has an output of 12 volts and

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:32.980
One camp this small line with three dots underneath. It means. It's putting out DC power not AC power

00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:37.959
That's what we want this end that's on the power cord is not what we want, so let's just snip it off

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:46.020
Now let's separate the do cords and strip back a little bit of the plastic so we have the exposed wire underneath I

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:51.690
Believe the wire with the black dotted line running along it is the negative terminal

00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:55.710
If it doesn't work very well, then we'll just switch them and see if that helps it

00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:59.519
It's gonna fold up a little bit to make it a bit easier for the Gator clip to grab on to it

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:12.270
Now let's plug in our adapter try a different shape this time. I'm just gonna make a longer slightly squiggly line

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:16.690
All right

00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:23.790
Connect our what? I hope is our positive terminal to the metal our salt water covered cotton swab connected to the negative terminal

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:27.540
See how this works oh

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:33.749
We got bubbling pretty much right away, which I think confirms that this is in fact the negative terminal

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:37.440
I would say this is a little bit more bubbling action than one 9-volt battery

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:43.200
but less than two, which makes sense since this is 12 volts in each of the batteries is 9 volts I

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:47.309
Saw a fair amount of bubbling when I first started applying it like this

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:53.010
But it hasn't been changing the color at all and there's been no buildup on the tip of the cotton swab it's been building up

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:55.559
Where the alligator clip was holding it, but not on the tip of the swab?

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:58.590
So I'm wondering if I have my positive and negative terminals switched

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:04.470
so I'm just going to attach the black one to the bar and put the cotton swab in the red clips and then see if

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:05.530
It makes a difference

00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:09.660
It's not bubbling as much as it was before, but it's definitely discolor anymore

00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:15.210
which I think is the more important look because it means it's actually doing something to the metal I

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:17.939
Was doing a lot more than it was before

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:24.270
So I clearly had my positive and negative terminals switched on that wire

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:26.380
You can see that this time

00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:32.309
All of the build-up on the cotton swab is where it's touching the steel and not where the alligator clip is gripping it

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:42.559
Beautiful just like how we were getting before

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:49.340
There's definitely an edge on the steel a lip that can kind of catch the blade that has removed some steel

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:52.220
Right up to the line

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:59.090
Saltwater seems to be working great both sources of electricity seem to be working great and electrical tape is making a great mask I do

00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:01.609
Want to try one other type of masking and that's nail polish?

00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:07.130
I'm gonna be using black nail polish because it will be easier to see the contrast between where there is and is not a

00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:10.039
Protective coating, but you can use any color you've got available

00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:12.769
Our nail polish is dry so now let's try

00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:17.120
Scratching in some lettering to see if we can use the nail polish as a mask the same way we did the tape

00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:20.610
I'm sorry

00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:22.380
tearing strangely

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:28.760
He's not actually sticking very well to our steel. It's just sort of lifting up in spots. I was trying to make the letter K

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:33.619
But it didn't stay stuck down very well. Just kind of filled right off

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:39.320
I'm not sure if it's gonna be the best thing to use on a smooth steel surface

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:43.910
I was supposed to say king with the bit that broke off of the top of the K

00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:46.699
It looks more like it says ring well. Let's give it a try anyway

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:52.640
I

00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:56.399
Think I've gotten a decent engraving there

00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:00.540
normally, I would say get some acetone to clear all the

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:03.360
nail polish off but

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:06.900
Coming off so easily been I'm not sure that's necessary

00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:14.010
Weirdo you can definitely see the engraving

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:21.840
Indeed engrave the metal pretty well, but the nail polish itself just kind of started coming up while I was using it

00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:25.049
I'm not sure if there's a way to make it adhere better to the steel than what I did

00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:26.890
I hit it with the very high grit sandpaper

00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:32.160
Then I actually washed it off with some isopropyl alcohol before I applied the nail polish

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:35.999
And it was completely dry when I applied it, but it just isn't sticking very much

00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:40.170
Maybe it's just not meant to stick to steel very well, or maybe it's just because it's a low cost

00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:42.420
nail polish either way

00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:47.729
I think the electrical tape works way better as a mask if you've tried this and you used nail polish

00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:51.149
And you had good results I'd like to know what you did. Tell me about it in the comments

00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:55.290
I was thinking I might try a second one which is why I did two different patches of nail polish

00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:57.090
But the first one really didn't impress me

00:12:57.090 --> 00:13:02.910
so I think I'm just gonna leave it be and say let's move on to trying our steel cup instead of our steel bar I

00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:03.880
have here a

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:09.450
Stainless steel cup and I want to see what happens if I try and engrave onto the outside of it this could be very useful

00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:14.729
For personalization in a very permanent way. I also have one of the methods that I want to try for masking this off

00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:19.830
I'm going to be using this king of random sticker in the same way that I was using the electrical tape

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:22.859
I'm not going to try and cut out every single detail of this logo

00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:29.040
But I am going to try to go around the main crown outline and then this one Pentagon shape that's touching the crown

00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:31.230
We'll see how it works

00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:50.770
Now let's just add a little bit of electrical tape along the sides, so I don't accidentally engrave anything

00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:55.779
I don't want to all right. We've got the mask set up now. Let's try and engrave it

00:13:55.779 --> 00:13:59.229
This is a much larger area than I've tested before so I hope it works out well

00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:12.339
One of the things I'm really looking for is for the surface texture and shine to change

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:16.479
The stainless steel has this brushed look that gives it a little bit of shine

00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:20.020
When we were doing our tests that shine a lot of it went away

00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:23.679
And I think that was a good sign that it had really engraved down into it a little bit

00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:26.770
It is definitely losing some of its shininess

00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:31.179
Wearing down the steel little by little just what I want

00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:36.969
now I think I have a pretty good edge into the metal so I'm going to try switching the leads and using the vinegar to

00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:39.339
See if I can darken the metal after I've edged it

00:14:58.620 --> 00:15:00.620
Oh

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
Beautiful

00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:06.870
I'm just use a little bit of alcohol on a cotton swab and clean it off a little bit

00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:08.970
Hopefully it won't completely ruin the finish

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:15.270
There we go using a combination of both edging methods one to engrave down into the metal and one to slightly stain it

00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:16.920
We've gotten a very good result

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:21.839
I think the metal is engraved it is stained, and I'm pretty sure that's gonna be on there just forever

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:24.119
I'm really looking forward to it. I'm also curious

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:27.000
What will happen to it over time if it will darken or lighten?

00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:28.600
And we'll just have to see

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:34.320
This has been a really fun experiment learning how to use electricity to engrave into steel, which is pretty cool

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:35.700
It doesn't take a lot of work

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:38.129
You can easily use a 9-volt battery to make it work

00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:42.689
Or if you can find one of these AC to DC adapter cords, I think they work even better

00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:46.499
And then you have a constant source of electricity that you know isn't gonna drain and run out

00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:50.399
We found that using the tape or the sticker works very well as using a mask

00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:52.710
I couldn't get good results with nail polish

00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:56.039
But maybe you know a secret to make it work a lot better if you do let me know

00:15:56.200 --> 00:16:01.289
Now if you have anything metal that you want to permanently mark with a symbol or a logo or a name

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:02.910
You know how to do that yourself?

00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:07.320
maybe you have a knife that you want to put your logo on or you have a steel cup and you want to put your

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:11.939
Name on it, so everyone knows that it's your cup this cup even came with a steel stri suppose

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:14.309
You could try and gravy your name right onto the straw

00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:18.239
Special shout out to the channel art of weapons for giving us this idea. Thank you

00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:22.049
Thank you guys for joining us for this project today, and we will see you in the next one. Talk to you then

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:28.020
Here's the pile of the really disgusting looking huge cotton swabs

00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:33.119
They look like someone was cleaning something terrible with them if you clean your ears with a cotton swab

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:39.840
And it looks like this see a doctor immediately once again. Thank you to Dollar Shave Club for sponsoring this video go now to dollarshaveclub.com
