00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:02.940
All righ, t so now, we have got these
two Bellman operators, B1 and B2.

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.700
That each one is associated
with the a fixed policy.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.230
So B1 makes an update,
essentially following Pi 1.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.480
And B2 makes an update following Pi 2.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.230
So we know a bunch of
things about these updates.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.220
So for example, we know that if we
apply B1 to two value functions.

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.690
What's going to happen to
the value functions as a result?

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:26.160
&gt;&gt; They will not move further apart.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.810
&gt;&gt; By a factor of at least Gamma.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:28.920
&gt;&gt; Unless, they're the same one.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.490
Right?
If they're already perfectly together,

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:31.960
then they won't move closer together.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.090
&gt;&gt; Because they were at a fixed point.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.953
But then their distance is 0.

00:00:34.953 --> 00:00:39.410
And we do get gamma closer to zero,
because 0 times Gamma is still 0.

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:40.040
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.510
So that's true, but I'm just saying,

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.640
it's not that they always
get closer together.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:44.560
&gt;&gt; Yeah, okay, all right.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:45.470
That's fair.

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:46.170
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; That's fair.

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.440
If they are not on top of each other,
then they get closer together.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.900
And the same thing is true of B2.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:51.420
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; But

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.160
there's some other interesting
properties of these that aren't

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.740
necessarily true of the standard
Bellman operator, but

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.830
they are true when we used
the fixed policy like Pi 1 or Pi 2.

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.860
So let's step through what
some of those properties are.

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.570
And we'll use them to show that
policy iteration behaves itself.

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.390
&gt;&gt; Nice.
&gt;&gt; So this is the property that we

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.730
want to show that B1 and B2 have.

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.340
So, if we've got two value functions,
V1 and V2, not

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.640
only if we apply these Bellman operators
to them do they get no farther apart and

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.150
actually potentially closer together.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.040
But they actually keep
their same ordering.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.310
So let's say that V1 dominates V2.

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.930
So V1 is bigger than or
equal to V2 at all states s.

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.480
Then, that still is true after we've
applied Bellman operator B2 or

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.690
Bellman operator B1.

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.810
But we're talking about B2 right now.

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.080
&gt;&gt; Okay, that makes sense and

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.990
I think it follows immediately from
raising Thursday to the Monday power.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.480
&gt;&gt; Oh, I see.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:44.980
No, that's supposed to be theorem.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.030
Sorry about that.

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.930
&gt;&gt; Okay
&gt;&gt; We don't do day of the week

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.110
math until the next section.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.430
&gt;&gt; Okay, looking forward to that.

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.500
&gt;&gt; So how would we show
something like this is true?

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.020
The standard thing that we always seem
to do is go back to the definitions and

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.360
just plug things through.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.190
And let's see what we get.

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.600
&gt;&gt; Okay
&gt;&gt; To show that B2 V1 dominates B2 V2,

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.740
I'll just subtract one
from the other and

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.120
see if the result is
always non-negative.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.770
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:09.620
&gt;&gt; So let's do that.

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:10.910
We plug in the definitions.

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.620
And I did some cancelling here,
because it's,

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:13.990
it always sort of comes out the same.

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.950
This sort of notion that since we're
talking about the same states and

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.520
the same actions,
these rewards are going to cancel.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.180
The Gammas and

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.810
the summations and the transition
probabilities are going to factor out.

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.440
And we're going to end
up with something, well,

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.590
actually a lot like this.

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.530
Gamma times the sum over all
states of the probability

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.740
of reaching the next state times
the difference at the new state,

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.590
s prime,
between the value functions V1 and V2.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:38.480
&gt;&gt; Oh, okay.
&gt;&gt; And what

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.120
do we know about this quantity here?

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.421
&gt;&gt; Well, we know that V1 is always
greater than or equal to V2,

00:02:43.421 --> 00:02:46.440
which means that V1 minus
V2 has to be non-negative.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.245
&gt;&gt; Good, and then we take a convex
combination of a bunch of

00:02:49.245 --> 00:02:50.110
non-negative values.

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.820
There's no way it could become negative.

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.386
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; It could be 0, I guess, but

00:02:53.386 --> 00:02:56.000
we know that we're greater than or
equal to 0.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.220
It can't be smaller than 0.

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.450
So that gives us exactly what we need.

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:05.340
That if V1 dominated V2 before,
B2 V1 dominates B2 V2 now.

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.880
&gt;&gt; Nice.
And if we replaced B2 with B1.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:09.850
This would also be true.

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:10.470
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:11.160
Exactly so.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.610
The only thing that we're actually using
here is that we have a fixed policy.

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.520
It doesn't matter what the policy is.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.760
So B1 and B2 are the same
operators except they just differ

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.760
as to which fixed policy they are using.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.320
&gt;&gt; Okay.
So both B1 and B2 have mono.

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.940
That's perfect.

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:23.540
&gt;&gt; No.

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:24.850
They don't have mono.

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.340
They are monotonic meaning this preserve
this kind of ordering property.

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.240
Not that they have mononucleosis,
sometimes known as the kissing disease.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.250
&gt;&gt; Well, maybe where you're from.
