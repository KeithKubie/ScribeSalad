This episode of "Shots of Awe"
is brought to you by Norton.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.310
So I'm really
interested in the space

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.800
in which design
meets consciousness.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.380
When we're not just building
or creating useless things,

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.740
but when we're actually
co-actively authoring

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.250
our mindware.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:40.270
We build the tools.

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.340
And remember, the
tools build us.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.160
And there's actually
a whole philosophy

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.839
behind this idea, known
as ontological design.

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:48.630
Anne-Marie Willis wrote
an amazing article,

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.170
in which she basically
stated it like this.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.500
Everything that we design,
in turn, designs us back.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.130
So we are being
actively designed

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:03.290
by that which we have designed.

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.070
Our thoughts shape our
spaces and shape our tools.

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.270
Our tools and spaces
return the favor,

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:11.670
as Steven Johnson tells us.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:12.860
And so what does this mean?

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.850
Well, it means that
everything we are

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.698
is emerging, is unfolding.

00:01:17.698 --> 00:01:20.420
It's being created by
the active engagements

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:21.890
between mind and world.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.470
And the feedback
loops therein are

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:30.400
creating the linguistic choices,
transform, literally transform

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.945
our minds from within.

00:01:31.945 --> 00:01:35.840
And so again, it shows
that there a sort of space

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.400
in which what is without,
ultimately is within.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.850
That there's a circularity.

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.430
That our actions matter.

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.183
That the choices we make
today for our dwellings,

00:01:44.183 --> 00:01:46.280
for our museums, for our
institutional systems,

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.730
everywhere we place the
body-mind has to be designed,

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.710
knowing that everything
that we are designing

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.436
is designing us back.

00:01:53.436 --> 00:01:54.560
This is ontological design.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.450
This is why it's important.

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.130
And this is why we basically got
to keep in mind when we upgrade

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:59.460
everything, from
our refrigerators,

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.930
to our apartments, to our cars,
to our goods and services,

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.170
to our smartphones because
it's our minds we're

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.430
talking about here.

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:07.850
That's ontological design.
