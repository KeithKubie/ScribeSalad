00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.840
LOUIS GRAY: Welcome back to
Google Developers Live at I/O

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.190
from Moscone here at
Google I/O 2013.

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.420
I'm Louis Gray from the Google
Developers Live, and my guest

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.980
right now is Nicolas Garnier.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:17.570
NICOLAS GARNIER: Hi, Louis.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:18.460
LOUIS GRAY: On the Drive team.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.380
He comes to us from Zurich,
Switzerland.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:21.640
So that's quite the trip.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.240
We definitely appreciate
your coming by.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.170
And today we're here to
talk about the first

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.610
year of Google Drive.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.970
It's hard to imagine it's
only been one year.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.080
But it came out last year.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.200
Last time we were here, we were
talking about docs, and

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.130
spreadsheets, and each piece
in its own little slot.

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.070
So maybe you can give us a
little understanding of what's

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.190
happened in the last
12 months.

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.090
How has Drive evolved?

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.465
NICOLAS GARNIER: Well, 12 months
ago, basically, we

00:00:44.465 --> 00:00:47.260
launched Google Drive, right?

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.340
And people were really
anticipating this launch.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.940
It's really what people
expected, right?

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.960
It's really a service for people
to back up all of the

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.250
files that they have on their
desktop and open them online.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.069
And basically allowed them to
share these files with their

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:08.190
friends, for example,
or their colleagues.

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.350
But really, lots of the effort
that we have put in, and lots

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.960
of, I would say, the
groundbreaking features that

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.490
we've been working on are really
related to the SDK of

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.950
Google Drive.

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.480
So the SDK, that's basically the
API and a bunch of other

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.700
features that I'm going
to tell you

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:26.510
about in this session.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.390
LOUIS GRAY: And that really sets
it up for developers who

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.110
want to develop against
the Drive API.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.530
NICOLAS GARNIER: It's really
for apps to really build on

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.010
top of Google Drive and really
use Google Drive as basically

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.290
the file system for the
web platform, right?

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.340
You can find nowadays really
cool, really powerful apps

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.400
online, for example, photo
editors, I don't know, even

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.030
faxing applications or
diagram editors.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.650
All of that.

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.945
So even Google Docs, right, all
of these apps that went

00:01:53.945 --> 00:01:56.740
online that are great editors.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.760
We hope for them to actually use
Google Drive, really, as

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.570
the central place to read files
and basically save files

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.620
to so that users have this
central place to really hold,

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:11.670
and manage, and organize
all of their files.

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.370
Not only the files that they
have on the desktop, but

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.700
really use that for really the
web platform, as I said.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.450
All of the apps that are out
there that need to save files,

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:25.880
that need to read files,
basically.

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.000
LOUIS GRAY: And you talked
about, you look at a

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.410
differentiation between backup,
which is essentially a

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.530
passive environment where you
just send files from one place

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.060
and put them in another to
retrieve later, to more of an

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.150
active, interactive piece with
applications touching those

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.410
files, sharing with
other people.

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.290
One thing that I've enjoyed is
you essentially have, whether

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.570
it be Chrome OS or any other
application, if you log into

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.960
your account on Google, your
Drive documents are

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.430
everywhere, wherever you fall.

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.020
And it makes it really feel like
any computer in the world

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.150
is my computer.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.720
It's no longer that
my files are on my

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:57.900
desktop living somewhere.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.380
Do you feel like that's
really changed the way

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:00.912
users perceive it?

00:03:00.912 --> 00:03:01.500
NICOLAS GARNIER: Yeah.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.870
I think that's really one of the
big reasons why people are

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.650
really moving away from the
desktop and doing more and

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.420
more things online, basically,
alongside with all of the cool

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.850
apps that are available.

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:20.110
But to actually make these web
apps better and make them

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.090
actually want to use Google
Drive as an SDK, we've been

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.380
launching a bunch of features
[INAUDIBLE] this year.

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.580
I can just mention a few
ones really quickly.

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.220
There's now a way for people who
have files on Google Drive

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.800
to publish their files as
a website, basically.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.670
That's one of the real
interesting features.

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.330
We launched a real time API
allowing apps to build

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.760
real-time collaboration feature,
web apps that are

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.020
using Google Drive.

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.860
Real-time collaboration feature
that would be similar

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.060
to Google Docs, for instance.

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.340
We've seen some really,
really cool apps that

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.050
are using that future.

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.690
What else?

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.080
LOUIS GRAY: One of the good
things about being at Google

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.225
Developers Live and getting to
see the Google Drive team

00:04:05.225 --> 00:04:08.350
present is I've seen a lot of
these real-time interactive

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.070
features with the
Realtime API.

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:13.170
I've seen a number of the
developers out there who have

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:14.630
tapped into it for
the first time.

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.680
And we've been able to see a lot
of the tips, be it Claudio

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.779
or Stephen and the members of
your team talking about how to

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:24.550
drive your first Drive apps,
be it in Java or C++, or

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:25.050
JavaScript.

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.240
It really seems like the Drive
APIs are exceptionally

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.340
flexible for any type of code
that comes in there.

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.680
NICOLAS GARNIER: Yeah,
definitely.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.050
Actually, most of our APIs at
Google have this really wide

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.170
set of client libraries.

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:40.810
We're really trying to make
it easy for everyone to

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:41.900
integrate with us.

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.050
I think we have client
libraries in

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.160
eight or nine languages.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:52.910
You know, iOS, Java, Python,
PHP, et cetera, JavaScript.

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:56.760
And for JavaScript developers,
and for web apps in general,

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.700
we are really trying to
make it even easier.

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.420
We launched, for example,
a bunch of

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.940
widgets, widgets that--

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:07.730
basically really common UI
components, features of Drive

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:11.670
that we don't want developers
out there to have to rebuild

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:13.360
everything again.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.060
So we provide a bunch
of widgets to them.

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.700
Like for example the picker,
which is this little file

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.130
explorer they can embed
in their website.

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:22.610
So they don't have to
build that, right?

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:24.460
They can just trigger
that widget.

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:25.950
It's just a few lines
of JavaScript.

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:29.120
And people can go ahead and
select a file in their drive.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.910
It's like this little
UI popping up.

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:31.460
It's pretty nice.

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.710
We have the same for sharing
a file, right?

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:38.180
So we'll allow developers to
actually embed that sharing

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.160
widget, the same one we use
in Google Docs, or Google

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:45.370
Spreadsheet, or Google Drive, to
embed that UI directly into

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:45.860
their website.

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:49.350
So they don't have to rebuild
that feature again.

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:51.750
LOUIS GRAY: In what fashion
would somebody use Google

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:53.730
Drive as the back end
for their website?

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:55.065
I've seen the feature launched,
and it's really

00:05:55.065 --> 00:05:57.490
interesting to understand,
what kind of actual

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.310
deployments have you
seen so far?

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:03.260
NICOLAS GARNIER: So I think the
best suited apps for this

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.510
currently are productivity
apps.

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.310
That's really the type
of application.

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:09.090
Online productivity apps.

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:12.910
That's really the type of
application that can really

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:16.780
use the most of our features
that are out there.

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:19.360
For example, I forgot to mention
that we have this

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.540
really, really great feature
that was available at the

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:23.620
launch of the API a year ago.

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.570
It's the ability for application
to integrate

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:27.840
directly with the user interface
of Google Drive.

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.400
So application can basically
register--

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.770
just like they would on your
local desktop computer, they

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:35.800
register to open certain
[INAUDIBLE] types.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.170
They tell us, hey,
I can open image.

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:41.320
I'm an image editor, so I
support opening JPG and PNG

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:42.720
images, and stuff like that.

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:45.870
So when people actually
installed that web apps, or

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:48.820
connected, we call that, that
web apps to Drive, then from

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:51.990
within Drive they can, for
example, right-click on an

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:55.770
image or directly open an image
with that image editor.

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:57.760
For example, I can
cite a few ones,

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.070
Pixeler, Editor, or PicMonkey.

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:03.030
Those are the few cool image
editors that you can find

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:07.240
online that have a very, very
deep integration with the

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.220
Google Drive SDK,
basically, the

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:10.360
Google Driver user interface.

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:11.150
LOUIS GRAY: You mentioned
Pixeler.

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:13.410
They were actually one of the
first developer partners that

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:14.850
I asked Ali to take a look at.

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:17.790
As somebody who uses Chrome OS
every day, I want to have the

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:20.280
ability to get into image
editing, get really deep into

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.340
it, do the cropping and all
those things that you would do

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:24.010
typically with a native
desktop application.

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:26.340
It's been great to see the
integration with Drive there,

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:28.590
where you can take content that
is stored in Drive and

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:30.610
pass it right through
a system like that.

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:32.990
Now, we have only a
couple minutes.

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:34.900
I definitely wanted to say thank
you very much for coming

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:37.170
through, and talking with us
about Drive, and giving us an

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:39.430
update on the 12 months of

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:40.780
advancements that have happened.

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:41.840
NICOLAS GARNIER: Thanks
for hosting me.

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:42.560
LOUIS GRAY: Absolutely.

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:45.440
I appreciate you coming on GDL
at I/O. For those of you on

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:47.190
the live stream, we're going
to cut over to the sessions

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:48.190
momentarily.

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:50.890
And when we come back to GDL at
I/O I'll be joined with the

00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:52.550
team working on games,
which were all

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:53.610
announced this morning.

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:56.380
Should have incredible
demos coming up.

00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:57.630
NICOLAS GARNIER: Thank you.
