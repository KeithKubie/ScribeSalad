00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:03.823
Voiceover:We're told theta
is between pi and 2pi,

00:00:03.823 --> 00:00:04.950
and cosine of theta is equal

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:06.833
to negative square root of 3 over 2,

00:00:06.833 --> 00:00:09.767
and phi is an acute angle,

00:00:09.767 --> 00:00:12.700
and we can assume it's
a positive acute angle.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.967
So we could say an acute positive angle

00:00:14.967 --> 00:00:19.835
or as a positive acute angle.

00:00:19.835 --> 00:00:24.169
And cosine of phi is equal to 7/25.

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:27.900
Find cosine of phi plus theta exactly.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.434
So essentially, can we figure
it out without a calculator?

00:00:30.434 --> 00:00:32.100
I encourage you to pause this video

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.366
and think about it on your own.

00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:35.900
Let's see if we can work through it.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.367
When we see, "Find cosine
of phi plus theta,"

00:00:38.367 --> 00:00:42.233
we're finding the cosine of
the addition of 2 angles,

00:00:42.233 --> 00:00:43.234
so to me at least,

00:00:43.234 --> 00:00:46.233
that screams out that maybe
the angle addition formula

00:00:46.233 --> 00:00:48.900
can help us evaluate this,

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.834
especially because we know
what cosine of theta is,

00:00:50.834 --> 00:00:52.033
cosine of phi is,

00:00:52.033 --> 00:00:52.900
and then maybe we can also use those

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.433
to figure out what sine of
theta and sine of phi are.

00:00:55.433 --> 00:00:58.034
So let's just write out
the angle addition formula.

00:00:58.034 --> 00:01:08.167
It tells us that cosine of phi plus theta

00:01:08.167 --> 00:01:11.367
is equal to cosine of
both of those angles,

00:01:11.367 --> 00:01:14.033
the product of the cosines
of both of those angles.

00:01:14.033 --> 00:01:19.961
So cosine phi times cosine theta

00:01:19.961 --> 00:01:21.196
minus,

00:01:21.196 --> 00:01:23.101
so if this was a positive,
this is going to be a negative,

00:01:23.101 --> 00:01:25.033
if this was a negative,
this would be a positive,

00:01:25.033 --> 00:01:28.566
minus the product of the
sines of both of these angles,

00:01:28.566 --> 00:01:33.600
so sine of phi times sine of theta.

00:01:36.701 --> 00:01:38.833
And we already know some
of this information.

00:01:38.833 --> 00:01:40.900
We know what cosine of phi is.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.041
Cosine of phi is 7/25.

00:01:43.041 --> 00:01:45.433
So that is 7/25.

00:01:45.433 --> 00:01:47.034
We know what cosine of theta is.

00:01:47.034 --> 00:01:49.636
Cosine of theta is negative
square root of 3 over 2.

00:01:49.636 --> 00:01:52.434
Negative square root of 3 over 2,

00:01:52.434 --> 00:01:54.366
so we're going to take a
product here for this term.

00:01:54.366 --> 00:01:55.900
Now we need to figure out what sine of phi

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.766
and sine of theta are.

00:01:57.766 --> 00:02:00.500
Lucky for us, we have
the Pythagorean identity.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.500
The Pythagorean identity tells
us that sine squared theta

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.900
plus cosine squared theta is equal to 1.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.966
Or we could say that sine squared theta

00:02:10.966 --> 00:02:14.166
is equal to 1 minus cosine squared theta,

00:02:14.166 --> 00:02:19.967
or that sine of theta is
equal to the plus or minus

00:02:19.967 --> 00:02:25.033
square root of 1 minus
cosine squared theta.

00:02:25.033 --> 00:02:27.100
For example, we could use
this now to figure out

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.034
what sine of theta is.

00:02:29.034 --> 00:02:33.566
We could say sine of
theta is going to be equal

00:02:33.566 --> 00:02:35.833
to the plus or minus square root

00:02:35.833 --> 00:02:39.566
of 1 minus cosine squared theta.

00:02:39.566 --> 00:02:42.566
Cosine squared theta is negative
square root of 3 over 2.

00:02:42.566 --> 00:02:44.701
If you square it, that's
going to be positive,

00:02:44.701 --> 00:02:46.905
and if you square 3,

00:02:46.905 --> 00:02:48.633
if you square the square root of 3,

00:02:48.633 --> 00:02:50.366
you're going to get 3,

00:02:50.366 --> 00:02:52.934
and if you square 2,
you're going to get 4.

00:02:54.525 --> 00:02:56.646
The plus or minus square
root of 1 minus 3/4,

00:02:56.646 --> 00:03:01.432
which is equal to the plus
or minus square root of 1/4,

00:03:01.432 --> 00:03:05.600
which is equal to plus or minus 1/2.

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.433
Now which one is it going to be?

00:03:07.433 --> 00:03:12.433
Is sine of theta going to be
positive 1/2 or negative 1/2?

00:03:12.433 --> 00:03:13.233
To think about that,

00:03:13.233 --> 00:03:17.600
we could draw ourselves a
little unit circle here.

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:19.900
That's my Y-axis.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.167
That is my X-axis.

00:03:24.167 --> 00:03:26.684
Let me draw a little unit circle here,

00:03:26.684 --> 00:03:29.500
as neatly as I can.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.500
A little unit circle right over there.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.238
Now what do they tell us about theta?

00:03:33.238 --> 00:03:37.900
They tell us that theta
is between pi and 2 pi,

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.700
so it's between pi and 2 pi.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.233
So our angle, our terminal,

00:03:44.233 --> 00:03:46.166
I guess the terminal ray of the angle

00:03:46.166 --> 00:03:47.367
is going to sit,

00:03:47.367 --> 00:03:50.233
is going to be in the
third or fourth quadrants.

00:03:50.233 --> 00:03:52.033
We're saying sine of theta is equal

00:03:52.033 --> 00:03:54.234
either positive 1/2 or negative 1/2,

00:03:54.234 --> 00:03:55.966
so it's either positive 1/2,

00:03:55.966 --> 00:03:59.367
which could mean it's one of
these angles right over here,

00:03:59.367 --> 00:04:00.633
or it's negative 1/2,

00:04:00.633 --> 00:04:03.900
which means it's one of
these angles right over here.

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.234
This tells us that we're in
the third or fourth quadrant,

00:04:06.234 --> 00:04:07.033
so sine of theta,

00:04:07.033 --> 00:04:10.033
we don't know if theta is this angle

00:04:10.033 --> 00:04:12.835
or if theta is this angle right over here,

00:04:12.835 --> 00:04:15.300
but we know if it's in the
third or fourth quadrant,

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.234
the sine of it is going
to be non-positive.

00:04:18.664 --> 00:04:20.833
We know that for this theta,

00:04:20.833 --> 00:04:25.900
sine of theta is going to be negative 1/2,

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.500
negative 1/2.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.666
So this right over here is negative 1/2.

00:04:31.701 --> 00:04:34.166
Now let's think about sine of phi.

00:04:34.166 --> 00:04:37.836
Sine of phi is going to be equal

00:04:37.836 --> 00:04:40.042
to plus or minus square root

00:04:40.042 --> 00:04:44.034
of 1 minus cosine of phi squared.

00:04:44.034 --> 00:04:45.700
Cosine of phi is 7/25,

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:51.802
so that's 49 over 625.

00:04:51.925 --> 00:04:52.301
Let's see.

00:04:52.301 --> 00:04:53.901
What is that going to be?

00:04:53.901 --> 00:04:54.833
Let me do it over here.

00:04:54.833 --> 00:05:01.635
625 over 625 minus 49 over 625,

00:05:01.635 --> 00:05:04.007
I just rewrote 1 as 625 over 625.

00:05:04.007 --> 00:05:07.915
That's going to be 625
minus 50 would be 575.

00:05:07.915 --> 00:05:08.566
That's going to be one more.

00:05:08.566 --> 00:05:13.367
That's going to be 576 over 625,

00:05:13.367 --> 00:05:15.900
so it's equal to the
plus or minus square root

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:20.166
of 576 over 625.

00:05:20.566 --> 00:05:21.100
And let's see.

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:22.766
I know what the square root of 625 is.

00:05:22.766 --> 00:05:23.900
It's 25.

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.368
576 , is it 24?

00:05:26.368 --> 00:05:30.634
24 times 24, yup, it is 576.

00:05:30.634 --> 00:05:34.866
So this is equal to the
plus or minus 24/25.

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.633
So sine of phi is 24/25.

00:05:37.633 --> 00:05:42.101
Remember, the sine of an
angle is the Y-coordinate

00:05:42.101 --> 00:05:44.701
of where the terminal ray
intersects the unit circle.

00:05:45.008 --> 00:05:49.034
So we're either looking
at one of these angles.

00:05:49.034 --> 00:05:50.849
We're either looking
at one of those angles,

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:53.166
if the sine is a positive,

00:05:53.426 --> 00:05:56.233
so we're either looking at
this angle or that angle,

00:05:56.233 --> 00:06:00.100
or we're looking at a
terminal ray down here again.

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:04.166
Now they tell us that phi
is a positive acute angle.

00:06:04.166 --> 00:06:07.633
So we know that we're dealing
actually with this scenario,

00:06:07.633 --> 00:06:09.433
this scenario right over here.

00:06:09.433 --> 00:06:13.038
Sine of phi is going to
be the positive 24/25,

00:06:13.038 --> 00:06:15.833
so that's 24/25.

00:06:15.833 --> 00:06:18.300
Now we just have to multiply the numbers

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:19.766
and then do the subtraction.

00:06:19.766 --> 00:06:23.166
This is going to be equal to 725 ...

00:06:23.166 --> 00:06:24.366
let me just write it down.

00:06:24.366 --> 00:06:33.101
This is going to be equal to
negative 7 square roots of 3

00:06:33.101 --> 00:06:36.766
over 25 times 2 is 50,

00:06:36.766 --> 00:06:38.233
over 50,

00:06:38.233 --> 00:06:39.634
minus,

00:06:39.634 --> 00:06:40.930
but then we're going to
have a negative out here,

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:42.371
so we could say plus.

00:06:42.494 --> 00:06:44.234
Negative times negative is positive.

00:06:44.234 --> 00:06:48.633
And then 24 over 25
times 1/2 is 12 over 25,

00:06:48.633 --> 00:06:52.433
so plus 12 over 25.

00:06:52.433 --> 00:06:53.833
But actually, let me just write it over 50

00:06:53.833 --> 00:06:55.300
since we have a 50 right over here.

00:06:55.300 --> 00:07:01.033
This is going to be plus 24 over 50.

00:07:01.033 --> 00:07:03.700
And so this is going to be equal to

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:10.966
24 minus 7 times the
square root of 3 over 50.

00:07:10.966 --> 00:07:12.866
And we are done.
