00:00:00.809 --> 00:00:03.612
- Many times in chemistry
we'll see different molecules

00:00:03.612 --> 00:00:06.779
that have the same constituent atoms.

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:08.906
For example, these two molecules here,

00:00:08.906 --> 00:00:10.445
they both have four carbons.

00:00:10.445 --> 00:00:11.721
One, two, three, four.

00:00:11.721 --> 00:00:13.715
One, two, three, four.

00:00:13.715 --> 00:00:15.663
So if I were to write
their chemical formula,

00:00:15.663 --> 00:00:18.806
it would be C4 and then they both have,

00:00:18.806 --> 00:00:22.548
one, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

00:00:22.548 --> 00:00:25.859
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:26.775
hydrogens.

00:00:26.775 --> 00:00:30.635
So both of them, both of them
have the chemical formula

00:00:30.635 --> 00:00:31.468
C4H10.

00:00:33.259 --> 00:00:36.905
C4H10, but they're still
fundamentally different molecules

00:00:36.905 --> 00:00:39.887
and you can see that because
they have different bonding.

00:00:39.887 --> 00:00:42.701
For example, over here we
have a carbon that is bonded

00:00:42.701 --> 00:00:45.391
to three other carbons and a hydrogen.

00:00:45.391 --> 00:00:47.452
Over here I can't find
any carbon that's bonded

00:00:47.452 --> 00:00:48.959
to three other carbons.

00:00:48.959 --> 00:00:50.733
I can find ones that are
bonded to two other carbons,

00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:53.019
but not one that's bonded
to three other carbons.

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:56.560
So, how we've put the atoms
together, is actually different.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.639
They're bonded to different things.

00:00:58.639 --> 00:01:01.141
And so when we have the
situation where you have

00:01:01.141 --> 00:01:03.156
the same constituent atoms,
where you have the same

00:01:03.156 --> 00:01:05.293
chemical formula, but
you're still dealing with

00:01:05.293 --> 00:01:09.539
different molecules
because either how their

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:13.465
bonds are made or what their shape is,

00:01:13.465 --> 00:01:15.799
we call those isomers.

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:17.549
So an isomer, isomer,

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.909
you have the same chemical formula,

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:23.742
same chemical formula.

00:01:26.627 --> 00:01:30.794
But you could have different
bonding but different,

00:01:33.102 --> 00:01:34.602
different bonding,

00:01:37.352 --> 00:01:38.769
bonding or shape,

00:01:39.888 --> 00:01:42.388
bonding, shape or orientation.

00:01:44.326 --> 00:01:45.892
Orientation.

00:01:45.892 --> 00:01:48.273
So over here you have
just different bonding

00:01:48.273 --> 00:01:51.237
and this type of isomer is
called a structural isomer.

00:01:51.237 --> 00:01:54.655
So these characters
are structural isomers,

00:01:54.655 --> 00:01:57.950
same constituent atoms,
but different bonding.

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.533
Structural isomers.

00:02:01.101 --> 00:02:04.907
So that's structural
isomers right over there.

00:02:04.907 --> 00:02:06.324
Now when you look at this pair

00:02:06.324 --> 00:02:07.443
or this pair,

00:02:07.443 --> 00:02:08.672
you'll say those don't look
like structural isomers.

00:02:08.672 --> 00:02:10.465
Not only do they have
the same constituents,

00:02:10.465 --> 00:02:12.571
both of these for example
have four carbons,

00:02:12.571 --> 00:02:14.515
four carbons and they both have

00:02:14.515 --> 00:02:16.316
one, two, three, four, five, six,

00:02:16.316 --> 00:02:20.067
one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight,

00:02:20.067 --> 00:02:22.283
and they both have eight hydrogens.

00:02:22.283 --> 00:02:24.200
So these are both C4H8,

00:02:28.012 --> 00:02:30.727
it's looks like they're bonded similarly.

00:02:30.727 --> 00:02:33.162
For example, I mean the
left hand side here,

00:02:33.162 --> 00:02:34.265
these look identical

00:02:34.265 --> 00:02:35.719
and one the right hand side,

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:37.880
you have a carbon bonded to another carbon

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.478
that's bonded to three hydrogens,

00:02:39.478 --> 00:02:40.813
carbon bonded to another carbon

00:02:40.813 --> 00:02:42.185
that's bonded to three hydrogens.

00:02:42.185 --> 00:02:43.599
Carbon bonded to a hydrogen,

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:45.427
carbon bonded to a hydrogen,

00:02:45.427 --> 00:02:47.584
so it looks like the
structure of the bonding,

00:02:47.584 --> 00:02:49.666
everything's bonded to the same things,

00:02:49.666 --> 00:02:51.230
but you might notice a difference.

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.490
Over here, on the right hand side,

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:57.703
this CH3 is on the bottom right,

00:02:57.703 --> 00:03:00.786
while over here it's on the top right

00:03:01.716 --> 00:03:03.138
and you might say okay well we know,

00:03:03.138 --> 00:03:04.204
what's the big deal there,

00:03:04.204 --> 00:03:06.040
these, you know, all these molecules,

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.330
they're all moving around,

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.173
maybe they're rotating
with respect to each other

00:03:09.173 --> 00:03:10.620
and these things could,

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.471
this thing could have rotated down

00:03:12.471 --> 00:03:14.316
to become what we have up here.

00:03:14.316 --> 00:03:15.932
If this was a single bond.

00:03:15.932 --> 00:03:18.692
A single bond would allow
for that type of rotation,

00:03:18.692 --> 00:03:22.461
it would allow for these things
to rotate around each other.

00:03:22.461 --> 00:03:24.902
For the molecule to
rotate around that bond,

00:03:24.902 --> 00:03:28.164
but a double bond does
not allow that rotation.

00:03:28.164 --> 00:03:30.004
So this fixes these two things,

00:03:30.004 --> 00:03:33.391
this fixes these two things in place.

00:03:33.391 --> 00:03:35.350
And because of that, these are actually

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.221
two different molecules.

00:03:37.221 --> 00:03:40.529
Over here on the top,
you have the CH3 groups,

00:03:40.529 --> 00:03:43.655
they're both, they're both,
I guess you could say,

00:03:43.655 --> 00:03:46.316
facing down or their both on the same side

00:03:46.316 --> 00:03:48.163
of the double bond,

00:03:48.163 --> 00:03:51.899
while over here they're on different sides

00:03:51.899 --> 00:03:53.755
of the double bond

00:03:53.755 --> 00:03:55.603
and so this type of isomerism,

00:03:55.603 --> 00:03:58.220
where you have the same constituents

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:59.868
and you even have the same bonding,

00:03:59.868 --> 00:04:02.286
this is called stereoisomerism.

00:04:02.286 --> 00:04:05.730
So over here we're caring
much more about how things sit

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.407
in three dimensions.

00:04:07.407 --> 00:04:09.026
We don't just care about
what's bonded to what

00:04:09.026 --> 00:04:10.949
or the constituents

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:12.472
and actually this one is, as we'll see,

00:04:12.472 --> 00:04:14.378
is also a stereoisomer because this carbon

00:04:14.378 --> 00:04:16.986
is bonded to the same
things in either case.

00:04:16.986 --> 00:04:19.456
So these are both, these
are both situations,

00:04:19.456 --> 00:04:22.108
there are both stereoisomers,

00:04:22.108 --> 00:04:23.275
stereoisomers,

00:04:25.625 --> 00:04:28.231
and this particular
variation of stereoisomer

00:04:28.231 --> 00:04:30.236
is called a cis trans isomer.

00:04:30.236 --> 00:04:32.973
Cis is when you have the
two groups on the same side,

00:04:32.973 --> 00:04:34.444
cis,

00:04:34.444 --> 00:04:36.061
and trans is when you have the two groups

00:04:36.061 --> 00:04:38.506
on the opposite sides of the double bond.

00:04:38.506 --> 00:04:40.006
Cis trans isomers.

00:04:41.026 --> 00:04:42.526
Cis trans isomers.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:47.174
Isomers,

00:04:47.174 --> 00:04:49.951
and these are often
called geometric isomers.

00:04:49.951 --> 00:04:50.784
Geometric,

00:04:51.871 --> 00:04:54.193
geometric isomers.

00:04:54.193 --> 00:04:56.733
So that's a subset, so when
I'm talking about cis trans

00:04:56.733 --> 00:04:58.386
or geometric, I'm talking about

00:04:58.386 --> 00:04:59.697
these two characters over here.

00:04:59.697 --> 00:05:03.280
They are a subset of the stereoisomers.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.456
Now what's going on over here?

00:05:04.456 --> 00:05:07.212
I have no double bond, I'm not
talking about cis and trans.

00:05:07.212 --> 00:05:09.064
The carbon, as I've just said,

00:05:09.064 --> 00:05:11.557
is bonded to fluorine, chlorine,
bromine, and a hydrogen,

00:05:11.557 --> 00:05:13.584
fluorine, chlorine,
bromine, and a hydrogen.

00:05:13.584 --> 00:05:14.927
How are these two things different?

00:05:14.927 --> 00:05:17.188
And the way that they're different

00:05:17.188 --> 00:05:19.415
is if you were to actually
try to superimpose them

00:05:19.415 --> 00:05:20.672
on each other.

00:05:20.672 --> 00:05:22.125
You will see that it is impossible.

00:05:22.125 --> 00:05:23.792
There are mirror images of each other

00:05:23.792 --> 00:05:25.754
and because there's four
different constituents here,

00:05:25.754 --> 00:05:28.986
you can actually not
superimpose this molecule

00:05:28.986 --> 00:05:31.285
onto this molecule over here

00:05:31.285 --> 00:05:32.415
and actually because of that,

00:05:32.415 --> 00:05:35.497
they actually have different
chemical properties,

00:05:35.497 --> 00:05:38.504
and so this over here,
these two characters,

00:05:38.504 --> 00:05:40.673
which is a subset of stereoisomers.

00:05:40.673 --> 00:05:42.994
Stereoisomers are
concerned with how things

00:05:42.994 --> 00:05:45.172
are positioned in three dimensions,

00:05:45.172 --> 00:05:47.661
not just how their bonding is different,

00:05:47.661 --> 00:05:50.266
but this subset where you
have these mirror images

00:05:50.266 --> 00:05:51.637
that cannot be superimposed,

00:05:51.637 --> 00:05:54.081
we call these enantiomers.

00:05:54.081 --> 00:05:56.024
So these two characters,

00:05:56.024 --> 00:05:57.857
these are enantiomers.

00:05:58.843 --> 00:06:00.177
Enantiomers,

00:06:00.177 --> 00:06:02.200
and enantio comes from Greek,

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.560
the Greek word or the Greek root opposite.

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.713
So these are opposites of each other,

00:06:06.713 --> 00:06:08.077
they cannot be superimposed,

00:06:08.077 --> 00:06:10.042
they're mirror, they're mirror images.

00:06:10.042 --> 00:06:13.519
So all of these are different
variations of isomers

00:06:13.519 --> 00:06:15.116
and once again, you might say,

00:06:15.116 --> 00:06:16.956
okay theses are clearly
two different molecules

00:06:16.956 --> 00:06:18.246
that have different bonding,

00:06:18.246 --> 00:06:20.333
but even cis trans isomer will have

00:06:20.333 --> 00:06:22.833
different chemical properties.

00:06:23.866 --> 00:06:26.072
These two in particular,
they aren't that different

00:06:26.072 --> 00:06:28.088
but they do have different
chemical properties,

00:06:28.088 --> 00:06:29.654
but sometimes they're so different

00:06:29.654 --> 00:06:32.182
that one might be able to
exist in a biological system

00:06:32.182 --> 00:06:33.497
while the other is not.

00:06:33.497 --> 00:06:34.969
One might be okay for your health,

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:36.984
and the other might not
be okay for your health.

00:06:36.984 --> 00:06:39.357
Same thing for enantiomers.

00:06:39.357 --> 00:06:41.612
One might be biologically
active in a certain way

00:06:41.612 --> 00:06:45.332
and the other one might
not be biologically active

00:06:45.332 --> 00:06:46.749
in that same way.
