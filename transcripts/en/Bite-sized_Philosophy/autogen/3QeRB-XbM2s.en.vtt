telogen is an interesting concept it's
 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:09.350
telogen is an interesting concept it's
very controversial in fact if you one of

the things that continually happens over
 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.620
the things that continually happens over
and over again in psychology is that

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630
and over again in psychology is that
 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.480
and over again in psychology is that
psychologists discover all sorts of new

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490
psychologists discover all sorts of new
 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.540
psychologists discover all sorts of new
kinds of intelligence and you know the

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550
kinds of intelligence and you know the
 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.700
kinds of intelligence and you know the
biggest to proponents of that sort of

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710
biggest to proponents of that sort of
 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.590

thing I suppose with Bob Sternberg who

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600
thing I suppose with Bob Sternberg who
 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.790
thing I suppose with Bob Sternberg who
came up with this thingy called

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800
came up with this thingy called
 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.710
came up with this thingy called
practical intelligence and then Howard

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720
practical intelligence and then Howard
 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.330
practical intelligence and then Howard
Gardner who came up with the theory of

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340
Gardner who came up with the theory of
 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.700
Gardner who came up with the theory of
multiple intelligences which had a very

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710
multiple intelligences which had a very
 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.720
multiple intelligences which had a very
large effect on educational psychology

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730
large effect on educational psychology
 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.580
large effect on educational psychology
when the theory was first proposed and

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590
when the theory was first proposed and
 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.350
when the theory was first proposed and
that's not saying much because generally

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360
that's not saying much because generally
 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.889
that's not saying much because generally
speaking it's very difficult to find a

00:00:38.889 --> 00:00:38.899
speaking it's very difficult to find a
 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:41.119
speaking it's very difficult to find a
discipline that's more susceptible to

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129
discipline that's more susceptible to
 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.060
discipline that's more susceptible to
fads in educational psychology and as

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070
fads in educational psychology and as
 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.889
fads in educational psychology and as
far as I can tell generally speaking

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899
far as I can tell generally speaking
 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.100
far as I can tell generally speaking
each fad is worse than the previous one

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110
each fad is worse than the previous one
 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.910
each fad is worse than the previous one
so you know Gardner posited that I think

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920
so you know Gardner posited that I think
 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.950
so you know Gardner posited that I think
there were seven oh there they are seven

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960
there were seven oh there they are seven
 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.500
there were seven oh there they are seven
or eight different intelligences

emotional intelligence and they talk
 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.850

about practical intelligence and as far

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860
about practical intelligence and as far
 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.469
about practical intelligence and as far
as I'm concerned all about complete

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479
as I'm concerned all about complete
 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.109
as I'm concerned all about complete
rubbish and there are technical reasons

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119
rubbish and there are technical reasons
 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.600
rubbish and there are technical reasons
for that I mean there's technical and

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610
for that I mean there's technical and
 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.880
for that I mean there's technical and
philosophical reasons for that the first

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890
philosophical reasons for that the first
 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.370
philosophical reasons for that the first
thing is you can't just mess up a word

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380
thing is you can't just mess up a word
 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.590
thing is you can't just mess up a word
you know the whole point of having a

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600
you know the whole point of having a
 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.179
you know the whole point of having a
word is so that it defines something

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189
word is so that it defines something
 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.130
word is so that it defines something
that describes something and doesn't

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140
that describes something and doesn't
 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.830
that describes something and doesn't
describe other things right and so you

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840
describe other things right and so you
 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.670
describe other things right and so you
can you can make the word intelligence

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680
can you can make the word intelligence
 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.590
can you can make the word intelligence
account for whatever you want so you can

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600
account for whatever you want so you can
 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.990
account for whatever you want so you can
say that the ability advanced is a form

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000
say that the ability advanced is a form
 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.469
say that the ability advanced is a form
of intelligence but the problem with

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479
of intelligence but the problem with
 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.149
of intelligence but the problem with
that is you blur out the word so badly

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159
that is you blur out the word so badly
 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.130
that is you blur out the word so badly
you can't tell what it means anymore and

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140
you can't tell what it means anymore and
 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.289
you can't tell what it means anymore and
so and I would also point out we had

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299
so and I would also point out we had
 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.149
so and I would also point out we had
perfectly good words for those major

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159
perfectly good words for those major
 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.420
perfectly good words for those major
intelligences we call them talents and

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430
intelligences we call them talents and
 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.429
intelligences we call them talents and
so it's perfectly reasonable to make a

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439
so it's perfectly reasonable to make a
 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.020
so it's perfectly reasonable to make a
distinction between the talent and

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030
distinction between the talent and
 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.450
distinction between the talent and
intelligence now you might say well how

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460
intelligence now you might say well how
 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.700
intelligence now you might say well how
the hell do you know the difference like

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710
the hell do you know the difference like
 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.060
the hell do you know the difference like
if things look similar to some degree

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070
if things look similar to some degree
 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.109
if things look similar to some degree
then how do you know if they're the same

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119
then how do you know if they're the same
 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.270
then how do you know if they're the same
or different well that's exactly what

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280
or different well that's exactly what
 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.559
or different well that's exactly what
you do when you do the construct

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569
you do when you do the construct
 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.050
you do when you do the construct
validity process so let's

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060
validity process so let's
 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.710
validity process so let's
you raided a number of people on their

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720
you raided a number of people on their
 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.780
you raided a number of people on their
dancing abilities and then you rated the

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790
dancing abilities and then you rated the
 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.430
dancing abilities and then you rated the
number of people on their ability to

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440
number of people on their ability to
 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.040
number of people on their ability to
multiply two digits two two-digit

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050
multiply two digits two two-digit
 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.770
multiply two digits two two-digit
numbers in their heads and quickly well

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780
numbers in their heads and quickly well
 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.770
numbers in their heads and quickly well
then you see technically if both of

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780
then you see technically if both of
 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.500
then you see technically if both of
those were intelligences then the people

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510
those were intelligences then the people
 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:30.880
those were intelligences then the people
who could dance better could multiply

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890
who could dance better could multiply
 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.250
who could dance better could multiply
two-digit numbers faster in their head

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260
two-digit numbers faster in their head
 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.630
two-digit numbers faster in their head
and that they would be slightly

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640
and that they would be slightly
 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.460
and that they would be slightly
positively sorry see that's what happens

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470
positively sorry see that's what happens
 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.870
positively sorry see that's what happens
when I don't have any diet coke so

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880
when I don't have any diet coke so
 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.080
when I don't have any diet coke so
anyway if intelligence was the right

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090
anyway if intelligence was the right
 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.620
anyway if intelligence was the right
word to subsume both of those then what

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630
word to subsume both of those then what
 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:54.910
word to subsume both of those then what
you see is there would be a high

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920
you see is there would be a high
 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.380
you see is there would be a high
correlation the people who were good

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390
correlation the people who were good
 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.059
correlation the people who were good
dancers would also be the ones who could

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:58.069
dancers would also be the ones who could
 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:01.960
dancers would also be the ones who could
multiply most rapidly and I mean

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970
multiply most rapidly and I mean
 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:07.180
multiply most rapidly and I mean
multiply in their head but that's but

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190
multiply in their head but that's but
 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.100
multiply in their head but that's but
you're not going to be able to extract

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110
you're not going to be able to extract
 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.140
you're not going to be able to extract
out a single factor like that it's just

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150
out a single factor like that it's just
 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.000
out a single factor like that it's just
not it's just not the case that those

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010
not it's just not the case that those
 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.380
not it's just not the case that those
things associate like that so for

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390
things associate like that so for
 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:22.840
things associate like that so for
something to be one phenomena the things

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850
something to be one phenomena the things
 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:29.500
something to be one phenomena the things
that it obviously I've talked too much

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510
that it obviously I've talked too much
 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.910
that it obviously I've talked too much
different master all the things that are

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920
different master all the things that are
 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.970
different master all the things that are
subsumed under that definition have to

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980
subsumed under that definition have to
 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.430
subsumed under that definition have to
be correlated and highly correlated

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440
be correlated and highly correlated
 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.080
be correlated and highly correlated
because otherwise they're not the same

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090
because otherwise they're not the same
 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.509
because otherwise they're not the same
thing it's the definition of the same

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519
thing it's the definition of the same

thing now IQ is a very peculiar

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709
thing now IQ is a very peculiar
 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:52.539
thing now IQ is a very peculiar
construct a very unique construct from a

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:52.549
construct a very unique construct from a
 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:54.610
construct a very unique construct from a
psychological perspective but also these

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620
psychological perspective but also these
 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.590

more generally from a social science

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600
more generally from a social science
 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.650
more generally from a social science
perspective because IQ has the most

perspective because IQ has the most
 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.780
