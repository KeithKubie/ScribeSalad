00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.000
We aim to make it easier and simpler for users

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.400
to shop the entire travel marketplace

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.099
for flights and for hotels.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
We describe ourselves as a search driven online marketplace

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.699
We launched our Andriod app in early 2014

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.199
and since then, the growth has been really rapid.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.199
There is an active community of developers out there

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:32.500
developing for the Android eco-system.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.500
So it is really easy for our team to share their

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.700
experiences and also learn from other developers.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.200
The move to material design was a natural progression.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.600
We wanted to provide a more native experience

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.100
for our users.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.799
And a user interface that they could simply just understand

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:48.899
and not learn specifically for WEGO'S app.

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:56.899
and for every new mobile app installed,

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:05.400
Last year when we decided to redesign our whole app

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.599
using materal design principles,

00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:08.900
The first thing we did was to migrate to Andriod studio

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.200
which took a bit of getting used too.

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.200
Things went quite smoothly afterwards

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.200
with the help of new libraries provided by Google.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.900
We moved to flatter material designs using

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.099
strong colours and bold typography

00:01:28.099 --> 00:01:30.299
to focus attention on content.

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.000
The floating action button pushed

00:01:35.699 --> 00:01:37.599
We optimized the app quite a lot

00:01:37.599 --> 00:01:40.599
which made the app experience really good and really fast.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.600
Within two months,

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.700
The most important thing that we are proud of is that

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.800
our app ratings were around

00:01:58.699 --> 00:02:01.500
In a space of less than a year, we've improved that to

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.500
To grow your app ratings while scaling,

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.000
while still getting millions of new users

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.100
seems to be some of the best in the industry.
