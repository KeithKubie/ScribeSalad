00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:03.400
MALE SPEAKER: Good afternoon.

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.770
It's my pleasure, privilege,
and honor to welcome to the

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:10.580
Googleplex Radhanath Swami, a
renowned Vedic scholar, bhakti

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:13.780
yoga teacher, and an author.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.950
I first came across Radhanath
Swami in a Burning Man video.

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:20.650
Believe it or not, he
does get around.

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.010
And in that video, he said a
statement that a stuck with me

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:26.430
for a very long time.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.190
And that statement
was, everybody

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:30.730
is looking for happiness.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.920
But to find your happiness, you
don't need to change your

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.160
externalities.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.040
All you need to do is to change
your consciousness.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.610
And the second time I came
across Radhanath Swami was at

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.810
the Wanderlust Festival
at Lake Tahoe.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:47.330
So I told you, he
does get around.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.070
And he was there with Moby and
Ziggy Marley, and he was give

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.740
a talk on environmentalism.

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.320
And at that time, he gave me a
copy of his book, "The Journey

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:02.470
Home, an Autobiography of
an American Swami."

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.280
And it's an extraordinary
story in this book of

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.510
adventure, of love
and mysticism.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.420
And in this book he talks
about, I read with

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:16.200
fascination, of how a young man
called Richard Slavin from

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.800
the suburbs of Chicago,
a little hippie--

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.895
he did have long hair back
then, should-length hair,

00:01:20.895 --> 00:01:22.790
believe me--

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.190
left on a trip around the world,
seeking something,

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:28.530
something that is calling
out to him.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.310
And he went on this trip
through Europe, Western

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.150
Europe, Eastern Europe, Central
Asia through Iran,

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.740
Afghanistan, Pakistan, and
finally found himself

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.280
meditating in a cave in
the Indian Himalayas.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.450
And along the way, he lost all
of his possessions and his

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.300
diaries at least five times,
sometimes just washed away by

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:49.650
the River Ganges.

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:54.460
And yet, when you read this
book, you'll be struck by how

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.890
striking is his recall
of minute details,

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.430
going back 20, 30 years.

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.700
And through this journey that
he documents in the book--

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.260
you can get a copy of the
book at the back--

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.350
Radhanath Swami discovered that
the fundamental problems

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.420
in life are really caused by
what he calls the frailties of

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.420
human nature, and that there
is a path to happiness, and

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.360
that there is a path to solving
world problems that

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.080
entails what he calls shifting
your consciousness.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.960
And to talk about that more,
please help me welcome to

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.900
Googleplex, once again,
Radhanath Swami.

00:02:44.628 --> 00:04:24.406
RADHANATH SWAMI:
[CHANTING IN SANSKRIT]

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:34.860
It is my great pleasure
and honor to be

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.540
with all of you today.

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:51.510
This company, Google, started
in a small way not long ago.

00:04:51.510 --> 00:05:00.160
And it's come to a level where
it practically influences, in

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:06.300
every aspect of life, almost
everyone on Earth.

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:11.700
I have observed this
as I travel around.

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:15.160
Even little swamis like me,
when I come to speak to

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.450
somewhere, almost everyone
says I googled

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:21.420
you before I came.

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:26.790
Not to speak of buying things
for the household or making

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:28.040
investments.

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:37.530
Such a great power of influence
your company has on

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:40.190
so many lives throughout
the world.

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:51.200
I'd like to begin by speaking
something about networking

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.625
from the perspective
of nature.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:04.100
Just a few days ago, I took a
walk with one of my very dear

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:08.760
friends to a redwood forest.

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:10.250
Have you been to Muir Woods?

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:17.280
Every year I go with one of my
dear friends while I'm in this

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:24.090
area to the Muir Woods, just
to get away from everything

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:26.420
and the beauty of nature.

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:29.810
And there, some of the largest
and greatest trees on the

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:34.810
entire planet have been standing
for hundreds or even

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:38.130
thousands of years old.

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:43.260
And as you're walking along the
little pathways, the bark

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:47.610
of the trees is so thick, and
there's so many such trees

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:54.250
hardly any sun comes down,
because it's blocked by all

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:56.350
the leaves and branches.

00:06:56.350 --> 00:07:02.460
And footsteps are kind of
absorbed in this thick bark.

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:06.110
So it's a very mystical
silence.

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:09.750
And as we were walking, we came
to one of the largest

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:12.020
trees in the forest.

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:20.040
There was a group of Chinese
tourists in a circle around a

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.290
park ranger.

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:29.570
And I happened to stand just
behind the tourists to hear

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:30.820
what he was saying.

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:41.630
He was about to tell what he
said the underground secret of

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:42.880
the redwood trees.

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:49.970
Now an American coming from
the 1960s, I still have an

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:54.428
inclination to hear underground
secrets.

00:07:54.428 --> 00:07:59.670
And he asked a question.

00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:06.550
He began by telling how these
trees in this forest have

00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:11.410
stood over hundreds or thousands
of years through

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:15.700
massive snow storms, windstorms,
and devastating

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:23.580
earthquakes, and yet they keep
growing bigger and higher and

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:26.860
higher and higher.

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:30.950
Now for most trees to have
strength, they need roots that

00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:32.595
go very, very deep.

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:41.480
But the redwood trees, their
roots do not grow very deep,

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:46.200
and they're in an area
with very loose soil.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:48.550
And it's a hilly region.

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:52.590
How do they withstand these
storms and earthquakes and

00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:55.690
keep growing?

00:08:55.690 --> 00:09:02.700
And then he paused for about a
minute so that we could all

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:04.850
ponder this question.

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:06.100
How do they survive?

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:12.340
And as I was pondering, I was
thinking of all the storms

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:15.620
that come in life, individually,
collectively,

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:17.336
socially, nationally,
internationally.

00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:27.740
Then he revealed the secret.

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:37.100
The roots of the redwood tree,
they grow outward underground,

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:43.120
reaching for the roots of
other redwood trees.

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:46.710
And as soon as they come in
contact with each other, they

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:53.340
intertwine and make permanent
bond between them.

00:09:53.340 --> 00:09:56.400
They're interlocked.

00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:00.870
This means that one tree is
locked in its root system with

00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:03.750
another tree on one side
and on another

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:05.910
side with other trees.

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:08.590
And the trees that are on the
other side of the trees that

00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:11.550
they're interlocked with are
interlocked with other trees.

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:16.030
And the little baby trees, their
little tiny roots, these

00:10:16.030 --> 00:10:21.990
big ancient giants wrap their
roots around them.

00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:24.790
In this way, practically
every tree in

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:29.340
the forest is connected.

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:33.880
Their unity is their strength.

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:38.210
Even through storms, winds,
and earthquakes, they hold

00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:46.020
each other up and keep growing
and growing and growing.

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:51.470
This is nature's lesson
of networking.

00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:53.010
United we stand.

00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:54.260
Divided we fall.

00:10:56.890 --> 00:11:03.537
In our lives, our heart is
like where our roots are.

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:13.220
And when the roots of our
care, our concern, our

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:21.460
affection actually connect
with each other, we can

00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:27.500
develop such incredible
strength.

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:30.870
Even when the storms come-- the
storm of temptation, the

00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:34.283
storm of fear, the storm of
reversals and challenges--

00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:40.995
we can hold each other strong.

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:48.490
And this is very much a
spiritual principle.

00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:56.140
There's a very beautiful verse
in the "Bhagavad Gita." When I

00:11:56.140 --> 00:12:03.600
first heard this, I thought,
this is what I've always been

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:04.850
looking for.

00:12:06.770 --> 00:12:14.255
You see, I was born in a Jewish
family near Chicago.

00:12:14.255 --> 00:12:19.980
And in my life, I had a natural
inclination towards

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:21.230
spirituality.

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:29.960
But I saw so much hate and
division in the name of a

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:31.340
loving God.

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:39.830
This was extremely
disturbing to me.

00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:44.960
Either I have to reject the
whole concept altogether, or

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:51.470
is there something deeper,
something that actually is

00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:57.710
there, in an essence, that
unites us and awakens real

00:12:57.710 --> 00:13:01.040
character and real love,
something common?

00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:07.150
I believed in that essence,
and I was

00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:08.470
seeking that essence.

00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:18.460
This is written about in this
little book I wrote.

00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:22.070
I hitchhiked from London through
Europe through the

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:26.940
Middle East, travelled through
India, studying various

00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:30.980
religions under various
masters, trying

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:33.890
to find that essence.

00:13:33.890 --> 00:13:37.920
And a particular verse in the
"Bhagavad Gita," when I heard

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:42.900
it, I was thinking, yes.

00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:47.040
This is what the world needs.

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:49.510
This is what I need.

00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:53.200
Would you like to
hear that verse?

00:13:53.200 --> 00:14:05.170
In Sanskrit, [SPEAKING SANSKRIT]

00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:13.650
Real wisdom, it is defined not
by how much data we collect

00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:16.220
within our brains.

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:24.000
Real wisdom is not how
many degrees we have.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.880
Real wisdom is not how many
followers we have.

00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:37.920
It is to the extent we have
the capacity to see every

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:42.330
living being with
equal vision.

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:45.890
Whether one is man or woman,
black, white, red, yellow, or

00:14:45.890 --> 00:14:51.030
brown, whether one is from the
East or the West, whether one

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:54.320
is a Christian or a Jew or a
Muslim or Hindu a Jain or a

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:58.630
Buddhist or a Zoroastrian
or a Sikh or an

00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:00.120
agnostic or an atheist.

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:08.850
The "Gita" goes so far to say,
whether one is a human or an

00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:13.300
elephant or a cw or
a dog or a cat.

00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:18.350
Wherever there is life,
it is sacred.

00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:21.860
Life is sacred.

00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:25.690
When we understand how our own
life is sacred, we will

00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:31.760
understand that sacredness and
respect it wherever we

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:37.490
experience life, in every tree,
in every plant, in every

00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:38.740
living being.

00:15:43.620 --> 00:15:46.820
And then the "Gita" goes
on to explain, what is

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:50.550
the nature of life?

00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:54.570
[SPEAKING SANSKRIT]

00:15:54.570 --> 00:16:00.010
That the conscious force that's
seeing through the eyes

00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:02.140
and hearing through the ears
and tasting through the

00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:05.720
tongue, touching through the
flesh, thinking through the

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:09.520
brain, loving through
the heart, that

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:15.970
living force is divine.

00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:21.020
It is Sat Chit Ananda, eternal,
full of knowledge,

00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:24.060
and full of bliss.

00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:25.310
It's indestructible.

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:31.430
The body is constantly
changing.

00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:35.360
The mind is constantly
changing.

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:42.990
The witness of these changes is
constant, and that witness

00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:44.240
is our true self.

00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:49.210
[SPEAKING SANSKRIT]

00:16:49.210 --> 00:16:52.100
That means it cannot be cut
into pieces by any weapon.

00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:53.840
It can't be moistened
by water.

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:55.285
It cannot be burned by fire.

00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:01.320
And it does not die
with the body.

00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:09.829
According to the "Gita,"
the body is like a

00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:11.835
car or motor vehicle.

00:17:14.599 --> 00:17:17.130
Some drive Mercedes, BMWs.

00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:19.339
Some drive Fords.

00:17:19.339 --> 00:17:20.680
Some drive Volvos.

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:23.270
Some drive Hondas or Toyotas.

00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:26.666
And some drive Hindustani
ambassadors.

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:33.470
According to how much money we
have and according to the

00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:37.600
choices we make, we get a
particular type of car.

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:40.630
The "Gita" explains similarly,
according to the choices we

00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:44.080
make and according to what we've
invested in, in what is

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:47.310
called karma, for every action
there is an equal reaction, we

00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:50.340
get a particular type of body.

00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:53.080
And there are so many different
varieties of bodies.

00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:59.900
And there are so many different
differences,

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:03.910
differences in the ways
religions describe things,

00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:07.420
their languages, their rituals,
differences in habits

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:13.665
and cultures, in ways of life,
in physical appearances.

00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:28.240
But to understand the unity
within diversity is the secret

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:34.270
of actually finding peace and
being an instrument of peace

00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:36.930
within this word.

00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:40.140
That atman, or that
living force, that

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:45.350
soul, is the true self.

00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:51.280
And at the time of death,
according to the "Gita," when

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:55.860
this car of the body is no
longer suitable to us, we go

00:18:55.860 --> 00:19:01.720
into another car, according to
the choices and the desires we

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:03.135
have created in this life.

00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:14.160
Human life is very special,
because we have such a vast

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:16.260
capacity of free will.

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:27.840
You'll never see a cow jumping
on rabbits and devouring them,

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:30.400
and you'll never see a tiger
grazing on grass.

00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:36.192
Because they are programmed--

00:19:36.192 --> 00:19:38.940
you people are the best computer
people in the planet,

00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:43.970
so you'll understand
it better than me--

00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:47.570
with a particular
consciousness.

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:57.970
But a human being has
such free will.

00:19:57.970 --> 00:20:00.180
We could be saints.

00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:02.110
We could be serial killers.

00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:08.190
We could be envious.

00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:09.760
We could be everyone's
well-wisher.

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:17.400
We could be respectful and
self-controlled, or we could

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:20.320
be completely wild
and impolite.

00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:30.536
But with that power free choice
comes responsibility.

00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:41.280
The Bible says, as ye sow,
so shall ye reap.

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:45.080
In the Vedic text, this is
called the laws of karma.

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:47.775
For every action, there's an
equal corresponding reaction.

00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:59.020
But the soul, the atman, is
beyond all these things.

00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:04.390
But when the atman, due to the
ahamkar, or the false ego,

00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:09.360
identifies with this temporary
body and this mind, instead of

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:15.110
understanding I am in my body,
when we think I am this body,

00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:18.760
I am observing life through
this mind, I am this mind,

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:20.010
there's a big difference.

00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:27.070
If we identify with it and
forget our true nature, then

00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:30.780
we're deeply affected by every
situation that comes to us.

00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:36.800
Yoga means to reconnect.

00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:40.560
And interestingly, the Latin
word religio, which is the

00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:43.620
root of religion, means
to bind back.

00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:46.830
They really mean
the same thing.

00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:51.490
They don't mean just to be a
particular sectarian group

00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:54.540
that feels that I
have knowledge

00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:56.100
and nobody else does.

00:21:56.100 --> 00:22:00.480
Religion actually means to
reconnect with our own

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:06.590
essential self and with the
grace of God and to be an

00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:10.420
instrument of that grace
in whatever we do.

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:17.030
And when we make that connection
with ourself to

00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:22.840
understand our own eternal,
pure, loving nature, then we

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:32.560
can actually see it in everyone
in a dormant state,

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:35.865
and then even nature, our
environment, our ecology.

00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:41.550
When we're in harmony with
our self, we'll be in

00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:42.860
harmony with nature.

00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:44.690
We'll be in harmony
with each other.

00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:51.670
I write about this
in the book.

00:22:51.670 --> 00:23:00.830
In 1971, I got a very wonderful
lesson from an event

00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:05.690
that we might see every few days
something like this, but

00:23:05.690 --> 00:23:10.830
we don't really take
it seriously.

00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:13.340
The Bible said, seek
and ye shall find.

00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:16.170
If we're really seeking wisdom,
it's amazing where

00:23:16.170 --> 00:23:16.980
we'll find it.

00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:19.460
We'll find it everywhere.

00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:21.840
I was sitting on the bank
the River Ganges.

00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:31.570
It was the summer, very hot,
probably 110 degrees

00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:32.750
Fahrenheit.

00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:36.410
And nobody else was
there at the time.

00:23:36.410 --> 00:23:39.840
It was actually at Prayag, the
place where the Kumbh Mela

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:42.310
takes place.

00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:44.100
I was just at Kumbh Mela.

00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:48.200
And the day I bathed in the same
spot, according to the

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:52.430
government 35 million
people bathed.

00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:56.780
35 million humans bathed in
that place on that day.

00:23:56.780 --> 00:24:01.300
But in 1971, when I was sitting
there, I was the only

00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:02.550
one around.

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:08.860
A hawk was flying overhead.

00:24:11.530 --> 00:24:20.900
This hawk was hovering lower
and lower and lower till he

00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:24.104
was just a few meters
above me.

00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:30.820
I looked up at him.

00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:38.840
He had brown, what, and kind
of gold feathers, with his

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:45.280
wings expanded, and extremely
sharp claws.

00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:52.380
And its beak was curved down
and pointed very sharp, and

00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:59.730
yellow eyes that seemed to be
unblinkingly gazing at me as

00:24:59.730 --> 00:25:04.370
he was coming lower and
lower and lower.

00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:15.260
So naturally, I was thinking,
maybe he's hungry.

00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:18.180
Maybe I'm his food.

00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:23.320
Suddenly, he dove right into
the water and went

00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:24.410
underwater a little.

00:25:24.410 --> 00:25:27.610
And there was a skirmish.

00:25:27.610 --> 00:25:31.970
And about 30 seconds later, he
emerged from the water with

00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:36.680
the flapping fish
in its claws.

00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:40.170
That fish was about
a foot long.

00:25:40.170 --> 00:25:44.976
And it was really bewildered.

00:25:44.976 --> 00:25:48.320
It was just a few yards
in front of me.

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:50.780
And I looked into the
eyes of that fish.

00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:54.190
He or she--

00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:57.000
I couldn't tell.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.500
And I don't want to call it, so
I'll just call him he, just

00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:02.787
for conventional purposes.

00:26:02.787 --> 00:26:09.130
That fish looked so disoriented
and bewildered.

00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:20.220
And I was thinking, he was
probably just going about his

00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:24.390
day like every other day,
swimming upstream, swimming

00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:28.110
downstream, maybe with
family, friends,

00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:31.960
looking for food, playing.

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:38.250
Did not expect that at the least
expected moment it would

00:26:38.250 --> 00:26:42.340
be a ripped out of
its complacency

00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:43.590
by the hawk of destiny.

00:26:47.168 --> 00:26:54.710
And I was thinking how many
people I know, how many people

00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:56.260
I hear about.

00:26:56.260 --> 00:26:59.050
Very much like that fish,
they're just going about their

00:26:59.050 --> 00:27:01.860
days, and all of a sudden
they're diagnosed with a

00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:11.250
terminal disease, or they're
betrayed by a loved one, or

00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:16.770
they get in an accident, or
there's an earthquake that

00:27:16.770 --> 00:27:19.750
devastates everything
around them.

00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:22.580
It happens every day.

00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:25.080
No one expects it.

00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:31.800
That hawk of destiny is kind of
flying over everyone's head

00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:33.580
and could come down to get us.

00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:43.790
And I was thinking how we
shouldn't be complacent.

00:27:43.790 --> 00:27:48.160
We should make priorities in
our life of what really is

00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:50.425
sacred, what really
is important.

00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:58.640
I remember Martin Luther
King speaking.

00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:02.030
He said, if you do not have an
ideal you're willing to die

00:28:02.030 --> 00:28:06.260
for, you have nothing meaningful
to live for.

00:28:09.242 --> 00:28:10.575
Do we have that ideal?

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:19.920
Moments pass, and we're just
so preoccupied with

00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:22.000
superficialities.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.680
How much time do we really
invest in trying to discover

00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:29.355
what's really meaningful
and important in life?

00:28:33.930 --> 00:28:41.890
And then I reflected how if that
fish was swimming deeper,

00:28:41.890 --> 00:28:46.300
the hawk could not reach it.

00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:52.830
And similarly, if our
fulfillment, if our pleasure

00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:58.760
and meaning in life is deep,
then whatever happens in this

00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:07.320
ever-changing world cannot
really disturb what we have

00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:17.380
achieved within ourselves and
cannot alter the integrity and

00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:19.658
the character in
which we live.

00:29:23.410 --> 00:29:26.720
This is a beautiful building.

00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:29.180
But how many of us are thinking
how wonderful the

00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:32.420
foundation is?

00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:34.810
The foundation, like the
roots of those redwood

00:29:34.810 --> 00:29:38.780
trees, cannot be seen.

00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:46.860
It's something deeper than what
the eyes can perceive.

00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:51.870
But yet, the integrity of the
building is completely

00:29:51.870 --> 00:29:54.385
dependent on the strength
of the foundation.

00:29:58.250 --> 00:30:01.520
The Bible tells like
this, build your

00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:04.640
house on solid rock.

00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:08.085
Then any storm that
comes will not--

00:30:08.085 --> 00:30:13.660
It may disturb it, but it's just
a temporary disturbance.

00:30:17.130 --> 00:30:21.630
But if you build your house on
shifting sand, then when the

00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:24.930
storm comes everything
crumbles.

00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:35.590
How much are we really taking
seriously developing the

00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:42.450
foundation of our lives, a
deep inner fulfillment?

00:30:46.030 --> 00:30:50.390
In 1971, I lived with Mother
Teresa for some time.

00:30:50.390 --> 00:30:53.600
And I remember she said
something to me

00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:55.990
that was quite profound.

00:30:55.990 --> 00:30:59.870
And it was the same thing I was
hearing from so many great

00:30:59.870 --> 00:31:07.530
sages in the Himalayas, that the
greatest problem in this

00:31:07.530 --> 00:31:14.690
world is hunger, not hunger
of the stomach,

00:31:14.690 --> 00:31:16.485
hunger of the heart.

00:31:20.571 --> 00:31:23.605
What is the one thing that
nourishes the heart?

00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:28.830
Love.

00:31:28.830 --> 00:31:33.510
It's the most essential
need for all of us, to

00:31:33.510 --> 00:31:38.360
love and to be loved.

00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:45.290
If we have everything else but
not that, there will be no

00:31:45.290 --> 00:31:48.040
fulfillment to the heart.

00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:51.250
And if we have that, whether
we have everything else or

00:31:51.250 --> 00:31:55.165
nothing else, there's an
inner fulfillment.

00:31:58.430 --> 00:32:05.150
Because fulfillment it's not the
ever-fleeting experiences

00:32:05.150 --> 00:32:10.070
that come before our eyes or
that we touch with our skin.

00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:12.720
Those things are fleeting.

00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:16.095
Or even fame and prestige, they
come and go in the mind.

00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:21.920
Fulfillment is a thing
of the heart, to

00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:26.070
love and to be loved.

00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:31.920
And the origin, the universal
principle of all these great

00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:35.710
spiritual paths is to
the origin of that

00:32:35.710 --> 00:32:36.850
love is within us.

00:32:36.850 --> 00:32:38.100
It is our inherent nature.

00:32:40.690 --> 00:32:46.760
In the theistic paths, it is
to experience the infinite

00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:50.090
love of God, who has many names,
who has appeared in

00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:58.820
this world in many times in many
forms to feel that love

00:32:58.820 --> 00:33:01.360
and to love.

00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:05.480
And the "Bhagavad Purana" tells
that when we experience

00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:09.350
that love and we reciprocate
with that love, it's like

00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:10.780
watering the root of a tree.

00:33:14.890 --> 00:33:22.250
When there is love of God, it
naturally extends to every

00:33:22.250 --> 00:33:27.640
living being, just as watering
the root of a tree that water

00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:31.140
extends to every leaf,
every flower, every

00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:33.480
branch, every twig.

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:34.730
It doesn't discriminate.

00:33:37.420 --> 00:33:38.670
It's natural.

00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:48.560
According to the yoga
principles, it is that

00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:55.390
spiritual experience that is
the deepest fulfillment.

00:33:55.390 --> 00:34:00.790
And when we find that deep
fulfillment within ourselves,

00:34:00.790 --> 00:34:05.920
then the ever-changing world
and all the challenges that

00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:10.310
come cannot disturb it.

00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:17.480
The hawk of faith cannot go deep
if the fish are swimming

00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:20.790
in a safe place.

00:34:20.790 --> 00:34:23.330
But if our happiness and our
purpose and our meaning in

00:34:23.330 --> 00:34:26.780
life is based on all these
ever-changing, superficial

00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:32.909
conditions, at any moment
it could be changed.

00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:47.550
Ralph Waldo Emerson, he said
the reason why our society

00:34:47.550 --> 00:35:00.780
lacks unity and lies broken and
in heaps is because man

00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:06.420
has lost connection with
himself or herself.

00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:15.670
This is a transcendental
universal principle, to

00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:24.468
actually connect to that essence
of who we really are.

00:35:28.260 --> 00:35:37.665
If a person has chronic boils,
boils are extremely painful,

00:35:37.665 --> 00:35:41.450
and you have to let them go
through their natural course.

00:35:41.450 --> 00:35:42.800
I've had many in my life.

00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:51.890
We have to treat the symptoms.

00:35:51.890 --> 00:35:54.020
We put salve on it.

00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:58.610
We treat that boil in
a particular way.

00:35:58.610 --> 00:36:03.590
But if the cause of the boils
is a disease in the blood,

00:36:03.590 --> 00:36:08.040
unless we treat that, then
there will just be

00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:09.870
continuous--

00:36:09.870 --> 00:36:12.780
We treat one, we make it better,
and another comes.

00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:21.550
Some years ago, I was sitting
in the New Delhi Airport.

00:36:21.550 --> 00:36:25.350
I had just taken a pilgrimage of
several thousand people for

00:36:25.350 --> 00:36:28.850
about two weeks in a place
called Vrindavan, and I was

00:36:28.850 --> 00:36:31.440
really tired.

00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:34.140
I was waiting for a flight to
get back to where I live in

00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:37.550
Mumbai, and I was really happy
to kind of just be alone

00:36:37.550 --> 00:36:40.650
waiting for the flight.

00:36:40.650 --> 00:36:44.180
And then somebody came up to
me and said, the Union

00:36:44.180 --> 00:36:49.520
Minister of the government of
India for the environment

00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:52.750
wants to speak to you.

00:36:52.750 --> 00:36:58.170
So I said, OK.

00:36:58.170 --> 00:37:03.830
And she came up, and
she challenged me.

00:37:03.830 --> 00:37:09.310
She said, what are you swamis
and yogis doing for the

00:37:09.310 --> 00:37:10.560
environment?

00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:15.170
The rivers are polluted.

00:37:15.170 --> 00:37:17.270
The oceans are polluted.

00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:18.690
The ground is polluted.

00:37:18.690 --> 00:37:20.050
The air is polluted.

00:37:20.050 --> 00:37:22.470
And you're just sitting around
chanting your mantras and

00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:24.890
meditating and doing your
pujas, your rituals?

00:37:24.890 --> 00:37:26.140
What are you doing?

00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:29.410
We need action.

00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:33.530
So that was a challenge.

00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:38.760
It's kind of like a storm.

00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:41.820
It's like an earthquake,
actually.

00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:43.070
Very powerful lady.

00:37:47.456 --> 00:37:50.850
And she stared at me, waiting
for an answer, because she

00:37:50.850 --> 00:37:52.510
really cared.

00:37:52.510 --> 00:37:54.210
She really cared about
the environment.

00:37:57.430 --> 00:38:03.520
And I remember responding by
using the same example.

00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:06.350
When we're covered with boils,
we do have to treat the

00:38:06.350 --> 00:38:07.600
symptomatic problem.

00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:13.860
But if the cause is a disease
in the blood, we

00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:15.090
have to treat that.

00:38:15.090 --> 00:38:19.410
What is the cause for all of
this crime and all this hatred

00:38:19.410 --> 00:38:21.640
and hypocrisy in the
name of religion?

00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:26.720
What is the problem with the
greed on Wall Street that's

00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:28.720
actually creating such a

00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:32.610
destabilization in our own economy?

00:38:32.610 --> 00:38:36.820
What is the problem in India
among politicians who for

00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:41.550
bribes are willing
to compromise and

00:38:41.550 --> 00:38:42.800
let the people suffer?

00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:50.320
And what is actually
the reason why

00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:51.570
there's all this pollution?

00:38:53.950 --> 00:38:57.330
It's a pollution within
the human heart.

00:38:57.330 --> 00:39:00.655
When our heart is polluted,
through our words and through

00:39:00.655 --> 00:39:03.300
our actions and through the
decisions we make, we're going

00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:05.332
to pollute the world.

00:39:05.332 --> 00:39:08.550
Because what's in is expressed
through what we do and say.

00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:17.710
We have to address, we have to
educate people how to live in

00:39:17.710 --> 00:39:20.860
harmony with ourself, how to
live in harmony with each

00:39:20.860 --> 00:39:23.840
other, how to live in harmony
with God, and how to live in

00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:27.300
harmony with nature,

00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:33.030
And today's world now, it has
come to a point with all of

00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:38.450
our incredible science and our
incredible technology and the

00:39:38.450 --> 00:39:45.480
unbelievable development of
industry and the armies and

00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:52.760
the weapons and the bombs and
the incredible power of

00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:54.010
communication.

00:39:55.670 --> 00:40:00.770
If we don't use these things
with the right attitude, with

00:40:00.770 --> 00:40:04.850
the right motives we have the
power to really cause serious

00:40:04.850 --> 00:40:06.100
destruction.

00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:16.640
The purpose of religion, the
purpose of spirituality, the

00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:19.400
purpose of yoga is
very simple.

00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:25.240
It's not a sectarian idea.

00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:28.125
It's to clean the pollution
in our hearts.

00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:37.560
Transformation, transformation
of arrogance into humility,

00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:42.120
transformation of greed,
toxic greed that

00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:43.530
can never be satisfied.

00:40:50.530 --> 00:40:55.030
Being a millionaire,
being a billionaire

00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:58.130
cannot satisfy the heart.

00:40:58.130 --> 00:40:59.670
That's the way greed is.

00:40:59.670 --> 00:41:00.990
It's like a fire.

00:41:00.990 --> 00:41:04.880
The more you feed it,
the hotter it burns.

00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:12.690
And selfishness, transforming
selfishness into a desire to

00:41:12.690 --> 00:41:17.345
selflessly or unselfishly
serve others.

00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:23.320
Hate into love.

00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:30.700
Envy into rejoicing over
somebody else's good fortune.

00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:43.080
And actually connecting,
connecting to a grace, an

00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:47.530
energy that is within all of us
in everything, that brings

00:41:47.530 --> 00:41:50.020
out that love that
is within us.

00:41:56.420 --> 00:42:02.360
So I told this lady that we're
trying to do our part.

00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:06.660
And you're doing your part, and
we should work together.

00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:10.650
Because if we don't clean up
the internal state of human

00:42:10.650 --> 00:42:14.200
consciousness, even if you
clean every river, every

00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:18.030
ocean, all the air, and all the
ground, as long as that

00:42:18.030 --> 00:42:22.840
selfish egoistic greed is there,
they're just going to

00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:24.180
pollute it all over again.

00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:35.410
And she smiled and said, yes,
we must work together.

00:42:40.750 --> 00:42:43.850
This is the potential of those
interlocking roots of the

00:42:43.850 --> 00:42:46.640
redwood forest.

00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:48.840
We all have our differences.

00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:50.410
Some of us are accountants.

00:42:50.410 --> 00:42:52.870
Some of us are software
engineers.

00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:54.280
Some of us are managers.

00:42:54.280 --> 00:43:02.750
Some of us are politicians,
farmers, scientists,

00:43:02.750 --> 00:43:04.000
technologists.

00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:11.410
In a human body, every part
of the body has a unique

00:43:11.410 --> 00:43:16.650
function, but they're not
fighting with each other.

00:43:16.650 --> 00:43:21.180
It's not that the brain
says to the kidneys,

00:43:21.180 --> 00:43:23.556
I'm better that you.

00:43:23.556 --> 00:43:26.070
You do what I say.

00:43:26.070 --> 00:43:29.420
And it's not the liver that
tells the heart that you can't

00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:31.830
do what I can do.

00:43:31.830 --> 00:43:35.695
And the heart doesn't tell the
eyes you are low class.

00:43:38.910 --> 00:43:41.980
Every part of the body has its
own color, its own shape, its

00:43:41.980 --> 00:43:45.730
own function, but they all work
together for the sake of

00:43:45.730 --> 00:43:46.980
the whole body.

00:43:49.010 --> 00:43:50.890
And only when that's there
is there health.

00:43:54.420 --> 00:43:58.440
When we can see beneath the
external, superficial

00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:02.110
differences that we all have
with each other and we

00:44:02.110 --> 00:44:05.410
actually understand the essence
of who we really are

00:44:05.410 --> 00:44:13.090
beneath, as divine, eternal,
all-loving beings, then we can

00:44:13.090 --> 00:44:19.760
recognize how we're all
connected and how every one of

00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:24.200
us we could respect each other
for what we contribute, like

00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:27.230
the parts of the body.

00:44:27.230 --> 00:44:31.270
I may not be able to
do what you can do.

00:44:31.270 --> 00:44:32.770
You could probably
do what I do.

00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:40.730
Just recently, I spoke at the
HSBC Bank headquarters in

00:44:40.730 --> 00:44:46.840
London, and there
was 900 bankers.

00:44:46.840 --> 00:44:48.590
I was supposed to
speak to them.

00:44:48.590 --> 00:44:50.420
That was the event.

00:44:50.420 --> 00:44:56.555
And I actually looked out at
them and started laughing.

00:44:56.555 --> 00:44:59.990
Even now I'm laughing just
thinking about it.

00:44:59.990 --> 00:45:03.340
And I had to just be honest.

00:45:03.340 --> 00:45:08.070
I said, I don't know why you
asked me to speak to you.

00:45:08.070 --> 00:45:11.140
You're one of the greatest banks
in the whole world, and

00:45:11.140 --> 00:45:13.780
you're among the greatest
bankers in the whole world.

00:45:13.780 --> 00:45:16.380
There were all these department
heads and CEOs and

00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:17.840
everything there.

00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:20.720
And I said, and you're asking
me to speak to you?

00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:30.540
I have not had a bank account
and have not signed a check

00:45:30.540 --> 00:45:37.130
since 1969.

00:45:37.130 --> 00:45:44.810
They looked at me like I was
an alien from a distant

00:45:44.810 --> 00:45:51.644
universe, like how
do you survive?

00:45:51.644 --> 00:45:55.830
Now I can't say to all of you
that I have never looked at

00:45:55.830 --> 00:46:01.970
Google, because everyone has to
look at Google, even people

00:46:01.970 --> 00:46:03.220
without bank accounts.

00:46:06.060 --> 00:46:10.055
You see, whatever our strengths
and weaknesses may

00:46:10.055 --> 00:46:16.290
be, cultured humanity is when
we honor and respect what a

00:46:16.290 --> 00:46:27.950
person can contribute, instead
of judging people according to

00:46:27.950 --> 00:46:31.600
what I have and what you don't
have, what I can do and what

00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:35.050
you can't do, where I'm from
and where you're not from,

00:46:35.050 --> 00:46:37.680
what religion I'm from and
what you're not from.

00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:50.740
Real love manifests
as compassion.

00:46:50.740 --> 00:46:58.200
Real love manifests as having
compassion with equal vision.

00:46:58.200 --> 00:47:02.640
Of course we have to
discriminate, but not an

00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:03.890
egoistic way.

00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:16.370
It's not that you go up to a
tiger and embrace it because

00:47:16.370 --> 00:47:19.270
we are one.

00:47:19.270 --> 00:47:23.010
That's foolishness.

00:47:23.010 --> 00:47:27.555
Well, for most of
us it would be.

00:47:27.555 --> 00:47:29.360
We keep a distance.

00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:30.690
I was speaking last night.

00:47:30.690 --> 00:47:33.990
I lived in the Himalayan jungles
with one yogi, and he

00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:40.780
taught me that the leopards
and the snakes and the

00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:44.560
panthers, they're all around.

00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:47.930
You're sleeping under
trees in the jungle.

00:47:47.930 --> 00:47:51.530
And whether you're awake or
asleep, they have greater

00:47:51.530 --> 00:47:53.780
power than you.

00:47:53.780 --> 00:47:56.970
If you feel that you are better
than them, or if you

00:47:56.970 --> 00:48:00.550
have any fear of them,
they will kill you.

00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:09.560
But if you see the sacredness of
life and honor and respect

00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:14.580
that, don't go start
petting the cobras.

00:48:14.580 --> 00:48:17.695
Give them their space, and
they'll give you your space.

00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:23.770
And believe it or not,
it really works.

00:48:29.330 --> 00:48:31.860
But you know what I found?

00:48:31.860 --> 00:48:34.800
That it's much more difficult
to do that with humans.

00:48:37.670 --> 00:48:41.880
Because humans have really
complicated egos.

00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:43.130
Animals are predictable.

00:48:49.730 --> 00:48:55.660
But that is our potential, and
that is how we could actually

00:48:55.660 --> 00:48:58.010
make a real difference
within this world in

00:48:58.010 --> 00:48:59.260
whatever we're doing.

00:49:05.060 --> 00:49:10.310
I am just so happy, so
grateful I have this

00:49:10.310 --> 00:49:20.490
opportunity to be with all of
you and to share what I have

00:49:20.490 --> 00:49:26.980
learned from my beloved guru,
Srila Prabhupada, and from all

00:49:26.980 --> 00:49:28.550
my experiences in life.

00:49:32.570 --> 00:49:33.820
Thank you very much.

00:49:44.498 --> 00:49:46.860
AUDIENCE: Do you differentiate
between dogma and

00:49:46.860 --> 00:49:48.550
spirituality?

00:49:48.550 --> 00:49:51.050
And where do you
draw the line?

00:49:51.050 --> 00:49:55.840
And the second question is,
you talk about us being

00:49:55.840 --> 00:49:57.650
greedy, having negative
energy.

00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:04.370
And the question I have is, any
thoughts on why we were

00:50:04.370 --> 00:50:06.760
created that way
to begin with?

00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:11.720
Why be created ill and then
be commanded to be well?

00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:14.290
RADHANATH SWAMI: Can you say
that last question clearer?

00:50:14.290 --> 00:50:17.870
AUDIENCE: Why were we created
ill, and then we're commanded

00:50:17.870 --> 00:50:19.632
to be well?

00:50:19.632 --> 00:50:21.120
RADHANATH SWAMI: [CHUCKLES]

00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:22.370
Thank you.

00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:32.430
There could be many definitions
of dogma.

00:50:32.430 --> 00:50:40.100
But essentially, whatever
religious or spiritual rituals

00:50:40.100 --> 00:50:49.570
or beliefs we have are really
meant to be an aid to

00:50:49.570 --> 00:50:50.820
transform our hearts.

00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:57.180
Just like, for example,
you want to

00:50:57.180 --> 00:51:00.330
send a letter to someone.

00:51:00.330 --> 00:51:07.230
Of course, these days this is
not a very relevant example.

00:51:07.230 --> 00:51:12.400
In the old days, when I grew up,
we used to have envelopes.

00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:15.520
And we put the address on the
envelope, and we put the stamp

00:51:15.520 --> 00:51:17.830
of the envelope, and
then we'd send it.

00:51:17.830 --> 00:51:20.030
Nobody cares about
the envelope.

00:51:20.030 --> 00:51:23.020
They want to see the content of
what's inside the envelope.

00:51:25.940 --> 00:51:29.400
So our aspirations, our
goodness, our will to be

00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:34.360
purified, our will to love
God, our will to be an

00:51:34.360 --> 00:51:41.300
instrument of God's grace in
this world, that's what

00:51:41.300 --> 00:51:43.460
meditation is for.

00:51:43.460 --> 00:51:47.140
That's what ritual is for.

00:51:47.140 --> 00:51:49.210
It's a form in which
we can communicate.

00:51:52.950 --> 00:51:56.550
When we identify our religion
with the envelope and we don't

00:51:56.550 --> 00:52:00.860
really concern ourself with
the content of what is our

00:52:00.860 --> 00:52:04.480
character, what are we asking
for, what are we offering,

00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:05.730
what are we giving--

00:52:10.910 --> 00:52:15.410
In spiritual life, the envelope
of whatever external

00:52:15.410 --> 00:52:20.660
forms may be there, it's for the
purpose of giving love and

00:52:20.660 --> 00:52:21.910
receiving love.

00:52:26.130 --> 00:52:30.040
But if the content in our
heart is envy or ego,

00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:34.230
arrogance, and that's what we're
using the envelope of

00:52:34.230 --> 00:52:40.220
our religious rituals for,
that's not religion at all.

00:52:40.220 --> 00:52:43.490
Then it becomes a very empty
misused form of dogma.

00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:49.320
That's one way to
explain that.

00:52:49.320 --> 00:52:56.155
As far as the second question,
we are not created ill.

00:53:00.630 --> 00:53:04.320
The atman, the living force
within us is perfect.

00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:06.200
It is a part of God.

00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:08.940
As we said, it is eternal, full
of knowledge and full of

00:53:08.940 --> 00:53:11.690
bliss, beyond death,
beyond birth.

00:53:16.110 --> 00:53:20.630
But we have free will
within this world.

00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:26.660
And according to the choices we
make, it not only creates a

00:53:26.660 --> 00:53:34.260
reaction, but it also creates an
internal inclination toward

00:53:34.260 --> 00:53:36.167
doing the same thing again.

00:53:39.510 --> 00:53:49.256
A crude example, most of
us are not born with an

00:53:49.256 --> 00:53:52.285
unbearable craving to
smoke cigarettes.

00:53:57.800 --> 00:53:59.920
You make the choice.

00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:02.880
It's not that people's shove
cigarettes in your mouth.

00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:05.550
Of course, people could be all
around you smoking, and you're

00:54:05.550 --> 00:54:07.000
inhaling it.

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:10.852
But you make a choice
at a certain time

00:54:10.852 --> 00:54:12.102
to smoke the cigarette.

00:54:15.180 --> 00:54:18.520
And as far as I have heard, the
first couple cigarettes

00:54:18.520 --> 00:54:22.285
people smoke, usually they
don't like it at all.

00:54:22.285 --> 00:54:25.260
They're like [COUGHING].

00:54:25.260 --> 00:54:28.910
But it's kind of
cool to do it.

00:54:28.910 --> 00:54:33.340
The movie stars do it, and
my idols do it, so

00:54:33.340 --> 00:54:36.500
I'm going to do it.

00:54:36.500 --> 00:54:40.650
And as you make that choice,
the inclination to smoke

00:54:40.650 --> 00:54:43.460
another one becomes more
and more and more.

00:54:43.460 --> 00:54:47.690
So we become habituated by
the choices we make.

00:54:47.690 --> 00:54:51.090
Similarly, when we do good for
others, doing good for others

00:54:51.090 --> 00:54:52.340
is addicting.

00:54:56.130 --> 00:54:59.640
When we criticize other people,
every time we choose

00:54:59.640 --> 00:55:04.180
to criticize someone, we become
more habituated to

00:55:04.180 --> 00:55:06.360
respond to a situation
through criticism.

00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:12.640
This is the laws of karma.

00:55:12.640 --> 00:55:16.170
Whatever choices we make, not
only does it create reactions

00:55:16.170 --> 00:55:19.240
as far as what comes to us in
this world, but it creates

00:55:19.240 --> 00:55:21.050
inclinations within us.

00:55:24.320 --> 00:55:30.520
So the greed and the arrogance
and the envy and even the

00:55:30.520 --> 00:55:34.660
cruelties of this world, as well
as the goodness and the

00:55:34.660 --> 00:55:38.010
compassion and the forgiveness,
these

00:55:38.010 --> 00:55:45.570
inclinations we have are very
much due to how we have

00:55:45.570 --> 00:55:51.150
programmed ourself, by
how we have chosen

00:55:51.150 --> 00:55:57.970
to act in the past.

00:55:57.970 --> 00:56:03.360
And the present moment is how
we're programming the way we

00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:06.980
experience and see the world for
the future, what is going

00:56:06.980 --> 00:56:08.230
to be our inclinations.

00:56:10.770 --> 00:56:15.070
You see, you can't change what
we've done in the past.

00:56:15.070 --> 00:56:18.050
But whatever comes as a
reaction, we have the free

00:56:18.050 --> 00:56:23.620
will how we're going
to respond.

00:56:23.620 --> 00:56:27.560
If something negative comes and
we choose to respond in a

00:56:27.560 --> 00:56:33.140
positive way, then we are
creating positive karma.

00:56:33.140 --> 00:56:37.060
And not only that, but we will
have a greater inclination.

00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:45.270
There's a Native American Indian
example, which I think

00:56:45.270 --> 00:56:50.740
very suitably addresses this
question, that there are two

00:56:50.740 --> 00:56:53.730
dogs within each of us.

00:56:53.730 --> 00:56:59.080
There's a good dog, and
there's a bad dog.

00:56:59.080 --> 00:57:05.570
The good dog represents our
divine nature, forgiveness,

00:57:05.570 --> 00:57:11.830
humility, kindness, responsible
self-control,

00:57:11.830 --> 00:57:14.020
decency in how we
do our business.

00:57:17.100 --> 00:57:19.460
I know some of the wealthiest
people.

00:57:23.780 --> 00:57:27.360
They earn their money with
integrity, and they spend it

00:57:27.360 --> 00:57:28.610
with compassion.

00:57:30.710 --> 00:57:34.100
And they're as competitive
as anybody could be and

00:57:34.100 --> 00:57:37.850
successful as anybody can be,
but they built on this

00:57:37.850 --> 00:57:41.235
foundation of love.

00:57:48.420 --> 00:57:55.130
You see, this bad dog, envy
and anger and hatred and

00:57:55.130 --> 00:57:59.680
vengeance and greed and
selfishness, and then the good

00:57:59.680 --> 00:58:04.150
dog is there, which is
our good character.

00:58:04.150 --> 00:58:09.950
And they're both trying to
demand our attention.

00:58:09.950 --> 00:58:13.270
I think we all have
that experience.

00:58:13.270 --> 00:58:15.940
For some people, that bad
dog really barks loud.

00:58:18.526 --> 00:58:21.250
[BARKING]

00:58:21.250 --> 00:58:25.582
And the good dog,
[WHIMPERING].

00:58:28.860 --> 00:58:32.700
Which dog is going
to control us?

00:58:32.700 --> 00:58:37.610
Which dog is going to bark
the loudest within us?

00:58:37.610 --> 00:58:40.120
It's the one we choose
to feed.

00:58:43.550 --> 00:58:48.210
Real culture, real humanity is
to learn the art in every

00:58:48.210 --> 00:58:52.130
situation, even if it's
challenging, to feed the good

00:58:52.130 --> 00:58:56.440
dog within us and neglect
the bad dog.

00:59:01.740 --> 00:59:04.770
We are inherently good.

00:59:04.770 --> 00:59:07.230
We are inherently godly.

00:59:10.340 --> 00:59:19.330
To reorient ourself to our true
nature, it's the greatest

00:59:19.330 --> 00:59:24.470
need for fulfillment within our
own lives, and it's the

00:59:24.470 --> 00:59:25.875
greatest need within
the world.

00:59:28.530 --> 00:59:33.100
Within our tradition, we chant
these mantras, or the

00:59:33.100 --> 00:59:36.170
beautiful sweet names of God.

00:59:36.170 --> 00:59:41.770
And the purpose of that is
simply like a mirror.

00:59:41.770 --> 00:59:42.890
When you look in a
mirror, you're

00:59:42.890 --> 00:59:43.990
supposed to see yourself.

00:59:43.990 --> 00:59:47.970
But when it's covered with
dust, you see dust.

00:59:47.970 --> 00:59:51.420
When we clean the mirror of
the heart through these

00:59:51.420 --> 00:59:55.290
beautiful spiritual practices,
then we see the beauty of the

00:59:55.290 --> 00:59:59.760
love of our true nature, and we
could reflect that love in

00:59:59.760 --> 01:00:01.720
whatever we do.

01:00:05.030 --> 01:00:07.450
I'm so grateful.

01:00:07.450 --> 01:00:09.720
Thank you so very, very much.
