00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.236
In these...

00:00:03.269 --> 00:00:05.104
In these very dark times,

00:00:05.137 --> 00:00:07.373
when there will no long be
an<i> @midnight</i>

00:00:07.406 --> 00:00:09.375
and Kid Rock
could soon be making laws

00:00:09.408 --> 00:00:12.345
and malt liquor dookies
on the Senate floor,

00:00:12.378 --> 00:00:14.947
giant icebergs are breaking free
from their ancient moors

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.449
and hauling ass to Miami,

00:00:16.482 --> 00:00:18.518
and health care
might soon just be

00:00:18.551 --> 00:00:21.654
Trump just throwing pills out
the window of<i> Air Force One.</i>

00:00:21.687 --> 00:00:24.157
Now we're all besieged
by the creeping premonition

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:25.758
that death will beckon sooner
than we thought

00:00:25.791 --> 00:00:28.261
and that the only sounds left
to echo in our skulls

00:00:28.294 --> 00:00:30.696
will be unholy wailing
and gnashing of teeth.

00:00:30.729 --> 00:00:32.932
But don't worry,
because every cartoon

00:00:32.965 --> 00:00:36.035
from the '90s
is getting a reboot! Yeah!

00:00:36.068 --> 00:00:38.337
-(cheers and applause)
-Yeah. (whoops)

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.176
-Yeah.
-I'm in that one. Mm.

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:44.644
HARDWICK: Uh, anyway,
we can all wrap ourselves

00:00:44.677 --> 00:00:46.579
in a warm nostalgia parka
for a few minutes

00:00:46.612 --> 00:00:49.415
'cause every cartoon we loved
as a kid will soon be back

00:00:49.448 --> 00:00:52.752
to remind us of a time when life
was like a box of chocolates.

00:00:52.785 --> 00:00:55.054
On the horizon, we got new
installments of<i> DuckTales,</i>

00:00:55.087 --> 00:00:56.756
We got your<i> Animaniacs, </i>
your<i> Hey Arnold!</i>

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.793
<i> -Rocko's Modern Life. </i>
-(cheers and applause)

00:01:03.863 --> 00:01:05.498
Where...

00:01:05.531 --> 00:01:07.667
-TOM KENNY: That was a hoot!
-The updated titular...

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.235
-(laughter)
-The updated tit...

00:01:09.268 --> 00:01:11.270
-Did you do a voice on<i> Rocko's
 Modern...?</i> -KENNY: I did.

00:01:11.303 --> 00:01:14.307
-That was my first series.
Heffer. Yeah. -You were Heffer.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.042
(applause and cheering)

00:01:16.075 --> 00:01:17.343
-HARDWICK: You were Heffer.
-I'm in the spotlight.

00:01:17.376 --> 00:01:19.445
HARDWICK: Anyway,
this is all updated, and

00:01:19.478 --> 00:01:21.881
the updated character will
reportedly listen to dubstep

00:01:21.914 --> 00:01:23.316
and pound energy drinks.

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:26.586
Basically, everything you'd do
at a baby shower in New Jersey.

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:28.855
So, comedians,
if classic cartoon characters

00:01:28.888 --> 00:01:30.690
keep getting crammed
down our modern age holes,

00:01:30.723 --> 00:01:32.692
what is the plot line
of a reboot

00:01:32.725 --> 00:01:35.328
that you would like to see?
Uh, Brandon.

00:01:35.361 --> 00:01:38.564
Uh, Fat Albert goes to jail
for what he did to those women.

00:01:38.597 --> 00:01:39.932
HARDWICK:
All right.

00:01:39.965 --> 00:01:42.802
-Points.
-(cheers and applause)

00:01:42.835 --> 00:01:46.606
Yup.

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:48.841
-(as Fat Albert): Hey, hey.
Oops! -(laughter)

00:01:48.874 --> 00:01:50.276
HARDWICK:
Tom Kenny.

00:01:50.309 --> 00:01:52.178
He-Man can't serve
in the armed forces

00:01:52.211 --> 00:01:55.014
-'cause he used to be She-Ra.
-All right, points. Very good.

00:01:55.047 --> 00:01:58.584
-(applause and cheering)
-Points.

00:01:58.617 --> 00:02:00.620
(in cartoon voice): By the power
of Castle Pig Skull.

00:02:00.653 --> 00:02:01.988
HARDWICK:
Dan Harmon.

00:02:02.021 --> 00:02:06.025
<i> Thundercats,</i> but with dogs,
so<i> Dog-cats</i> is...

00:02:06.058 --> 00:02:07.627
-(laughter)
-HARDWICK: Yes, points.

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.593
-...what I'm pitching.
-Yeah. -HARDWICK: Yes.
