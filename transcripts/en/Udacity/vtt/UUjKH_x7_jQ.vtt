00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:02.840
Zoomed down to the chromosomal level, I hope you

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:04.830
have a new appreciation for what the human genome

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.280
really is. We've zoomed all the way in and

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.680
looked at double-stranded DNA, naked by itself. But inside

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.980
a cell, DNA is almost always wrapped around histone

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.560
proteins and organized into a higher order structure called

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.910
a chromosome. And chromosomes are pretty much what we've

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:24.140
been dealing with for the last couple of exercises.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:25.880
&gt;&gt; Okay. Now, let me try if I have

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:26.190
this right.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:26.540
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:32.049
&gt;&gt; My genome, that's inside of one of my cells is made up of 2 copies of 3

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:37.080
Billion base pairs of letters? That are organized into 23 pairs of chromosomes?

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.430
&gt;&gt; That's exactly right. Almost.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:40.500
&gt;&gt; I thought I had it.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.640
&gt;&gt; You did, but I've left out one tiny detail. Actually there's more DNA than

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.170
just the 23 pairs of chromosomes in the nucleus. There's a little bit of DNA,

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.400
actually outside in the cytoplasm of the

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.900
cell, inside another organelle and scientists have figured

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.910
out that this organelle that has its own

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.112
DNA. Used to be its own free-living bacteria.

00:01:03.112 --> 00:01:04.900
&gt;&gt; Okay, but what's an organelle again?

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.700
&gt;&gt; Well, an organelle is just kind of like

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.460
an organ for a cell. They're membrane-bound structures that

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.370
perform particular functions inside a cell. So take a

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.520
look at this picture of a cell here. What

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:17.930
I want to see if you can do is

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.780
look this picture and pick out which organelle you think

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.490
has its own set of DNA. Now, this could be

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.430
a little difficult if you don't have a background or

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.030
know wher to look, but remember that this organelle

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.510
used to be it's own free living bacteria. And, bacteria

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.070
look like this. So, do you best and see if

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.390
you can figure out which organelle has it's own DNA.
