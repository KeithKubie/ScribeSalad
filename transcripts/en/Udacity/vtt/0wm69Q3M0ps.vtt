00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.660
So we're here again with Paul.

00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:04.740
Paul, why is it important to have
interactivity in your prototypes?

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.020
&gt;&gt; So it's important to have
interactivity in your prototypes because

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:10.020
one thing that I often see in demos or

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.820
in presentations is that I want
to say hey, here is my prototype.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.080
And unfortunately,
this doesn't give you a really good

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.520
understanding of how somebody's
actually going to use your prototype.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.980
I'm not the user,
you are not your user, right.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.130
And so if I use this prototype,
I am an expert in it,

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:28.970
I know how to get good results.

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.910
If I do this.

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:32.460
&gt;&gt; I take this.
&gt;&gt; The person, right, and

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.510
you can actually use it and
play with it and interact with it.

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.590
You have never seen this before.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.450
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; So you're going to be a much better

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.670
representation of how an end user
is actually going to use this.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:44.360
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.390
The other thing, if there's really
nobody else around what you can do is

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.350
get really drunk and
then use your prototype and

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.890
that's going to be actually
a fairly good approximation about

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.670
some random person on the internet,
using your device or using your website.

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.260
&gt;&gt; Hm-mm.
&gt;&gt; There are actually a few different

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.459
services that you can go online and find
where you will have a usability expert

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:09.070
get drunk and review your usability and
send you a report on it.

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.930
&gt;&gt; Awesome.

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:10.620
Thank you Paul.
&gt;&gt; You're welcome.
