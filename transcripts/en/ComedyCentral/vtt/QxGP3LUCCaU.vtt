-I have, like, body dysmorphia
so I... -You do? Why?

00:00:02.768 --> 00:00:05.838
Yeah, I just-I'm not
really into, like, my body.

00:00:05.871 --> 00:00:08.341
Me too. I don't like my body.

00:00:08.374 --> 00:00:10.043
-No! You look so good!
-Bro, are you kidding me?

00:00:10.876 --> 00:00:12.545
I'm telling you, dude,
after this thing

00:00:12.578 --> 00:00:15.114
I'll take off my clothes and I
look like a substitute teacher.

00:00:15.147 --> 00:00:18.885
-And I got a fat ass. -Alright,
alright, alright. Let me see.

00:00:21.654 --> 00:00:23.656
Christopher.
That thing is--okay!

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:27.694
Hell yes. Absolutely, dude.
It's like a cafeteria ass.

Welcome to Stupid Questions
with Chris DeStefano.

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.902 line:0%
We are in Los Angeles.
Good city.

00:00:35.935 --> 00:00:37.737 line:0%
Kim Kardashian, avocados,

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.306 line:0%
gangs, all that and we're
with Brian Moses.

00:00:42.074 --> 00:00:44.377
I want to do some
Stupid Questions

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.279
-that are in the theme of
roasting. -Okay.

00:00:50.282 --> 00:00:51.283
Andrew Jackson.

00:00:51.317 --> 00:00:53.352
You want to roast
Andrew Jackson from the 20?

00:00:53.385 --> 00:00:54.620
-Yeah.
-Why?

00:00:54.653 --> 00:00:56.355
Because he was, like, people
say he was a racist

00:00:56.388 --> 00:00:57.723
but I think it was more than
that.

00:00:57.756 --> 00:01:00.359
-He was just a man about money.
-Right. Right.

00:01:00.392 --> 00:01:01.494
And then I would go for that and
be like

00:01:01.527 --> 00:01:02.462
"Ah, you didn't make any money."

00:01:02.495 --> 00:01:03.896
-and he'd be like "Yes I did!"
-Yeah.

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:05.398
He's like
he's like Trump in that way.

00:01:05.431 --> 00:01:06.666
Well you know what
the interesting part

00:01:06.699 --> 00:01:07.900
about roasting
somebody like that

00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:09.202
is because he didn't
understand the rules

00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:10.503
so you would be roasting
and having a good time

00:01:10.536 --> 00:01:12.138
and he'd just take out
a shotgun and shoot you.

00:01:12.171 --> 00:01:14.740
That's true. He'd be like, "Get
this slave out of here!"

00:01:14.773 --> 00:01:17.310
-Yeah, he'd be like "Why is he
talking?" -Yeah.

00:01:20.412 --> 00:01:21.681
Here's a Stupid Question:

00:01:27.353 --> 00:01:29.822
Uh, the first person I had sex
with, um...

00:01:29.855 --> 00:01:31.090
is bipolar.

00:01:31.123 --> 00:01:32.325
So probably her.

00:01:32.358 --> 00:01:33.159
Probably her.

00:01:33.192 --> 00:01:33.960
Cause it would be more
interesting.

00:01:33.993 --> 00:01:35.261
I like to be stimulated a
little.

00:01:35.294 --> 00:01:38.464
First person who had sex with,
I was 17, an uh...

00:01:38.497 --> 00:01:39.265
Same, me too! 

00:01:39.298 --> 00:01:40.433
-17? -Yeah

00:01:40.466 --> 00:01:43.136
Yeah dude, she was great.
Half Jamaican half Italian.

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:45.171
-You like that diversity.
-Love it dude.

00:01:45.204 --> 00:01:45.938
-Yeah, why not?
-Love it dude. I love it dude!

00:01:45.971 --> 00:01:47.473
I remember she came over

00:01:47.506 --> 00:01:49.842
and she like rang the bell
she was like is your mom home.

00:01:49.875 --> 00:01:51.043
And I was like
"no."

00:01:51.076 --> 00:01:52.445
She was like
"you want to have sex?"

00:01:52.478 --> 00:01:54.013
I was like "no."

00:01:54.046 --> 00:01:55.781
And she was like "well I'm
horny," I was like "oh boy."

00:01:55.814 --> 00:01:57.717
So we walked up the stairs
I remember.

00:01:58.284 --> 00:01:59.852
-And then I lay down
-You laid down?

00:01:59.885 --> 00:02:00.653
I laid down, yeah.

00:02:00.686 --> 00:02:02.121
And then I just couldn't get it
up

00:02:02.154 --> 00:02:03.723
-And she punched me in the
chest. -No!

00:02:03.756 --> 00:02:05.358
I swear to god she did.

00:02:05.391 --> 00:02:07.860
That did it. Yes.
And that's still to this day

00:02:07.893 --> 00:02:09.462
I have these aggressive things.

00:02:09.495 --> 00:02:12.065
I'm going to kill somebody
some day... accidentally.

00:02:20.506 --> 00:02:21.741
-Wow.
-Yeah, dude.

00:02:21.774 --> 00:02:22.809
That's one of the greatest
Stupid Questions

00:02:22.842 --> 00:02:24.510
-in the history of Stupid
Questions. -Wild, cuz.

00:02:24.543 --> 00:02:27.446
-I bring the heat.
-You know, watching TV.

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:29.549
-I love TV. This show's on TV!
-You love TV?

00:02:29.582 --> 00:02:30.850
I want people to see Stupid
Questions on the Internet.

00:02:30.883 --> 00:02:32.785
Well, yeah. Some TV is also on
the Internet.

00:02:32.818 --> 00:02:35.855
-TV raised me. -But you
don't care about the ocean then?

00:02:37.156 --> 00:02:39.492
-I can see it on TV. -That's
true. You can see it on TV.

00:02:39.525 --> 00:02:40.460
So I won.

00:02:40.493 --> 00:02:41.961
I'm good with the-I
don't need the ocean.

00:02:41.994 --> 00:02:43.963
I also think my dad's
probably dumped people's bodies

00:02:43.996 --> 00:02:44.997
in the ocean.

00:02:45.031 --> 00:02:46.232
I think there's just some
natural connection.

00:02:46.265 --> 00:02:47.400
Yeah, like they'll come back and
get you?

00:02:47.433 --> 00:02:48.468
Yeah, yeah, yeah like aah!

00:02:49.902 --> 00:02:51.671
Okay, this right here

00:02:51.704 --> 00:02:52.705
This is a stupid question.

00:02:56.242 --> 00:02:59.178
-We'd be the foxes because foxes
are cunning -Okay.

00:02:59.211 --> 00:03:02.882
and they're kind of sexy,
and we'd be orange and green.

00:03:02.915 --> 00:03:04.684
Cool. I like that orange and
green.

00:03:04.717 --> 00:03:05.952
Kind of like The
Hurricanes.

00:03:05.985 --> 00:03:08.588
If I was a school, what would my
colors be? My colors

00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:11.324
would probably be just
the colors the Italian flag.

00:03:11.357 --> 00:03:12.358
Very on brand for you.

00:03:12.391 --> 00:03:14.260
And the mascot would just be a
garlic knot.

00:03:15.928 --> 00:03:17.630
Running and rolling around.

00:03:19.531 --> 00:03:21.234
Know what's a good part
Stupid Questions

00:03:21.267 --> 00:03:22.635
is at the end you
get a stupid gift.

00:03:22.668 --> 00:03:24.637
Really? What'd you get me?

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.572
Brian Moses, that's your name.

00:03:26.605 --> 00:03:28.140
-DeStefano's yours.
-Right.

00:03:28.173 --> 00:03:30.676
So what I got you... Ten
Commandments on DVD, baby.

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:32.645
Moses, moses.

00:03:32.678 --> 00:03:35.681
And I apologize
for him being white.

00:03:35.714 --> 00:03:37.617
-I just think that's just...
-I really appreciate this.

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.585
...that's what the movie
was back in the day.

00:03:39.618 --> 00:03:41.921
I just think, like, you
represent new Moses.

00:03:41.954 --> 00:03:42.989
We should make new
commandments.

00:03:43.022 --> 00:03:44.323
Let's make new
commandments.

00:03:44.356 --> 00:03:46.592
So what's the first commandment?
In our new commandments.

00:03:46.625 --> 00:03:48.861
Well what's the first
commandment in general.

00:03:48.894 --> 00:03:51.163
Thou shall not kill.

00:03:51.196 --> 00:03:52.398
If my mother is watching this.

00:03:52.431 --> 00:03:54.567
I literally have the rosary
beads tattooed on my arm.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:55.868
I don't know the ten
commandments.
