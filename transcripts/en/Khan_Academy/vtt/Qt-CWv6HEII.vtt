00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.339
So we already have some experience
with traditional fixed-rate mortgages,

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:08.221
but I'll give a little bit of a review
before we talk about a little variation,

00:00:08.221 --> 00:00:10.258
or maybe we could say
a big variation on it

00:00:10.258 --> 00:00:12.848
which is a &lt;i&gt;balloon payment loan&lt;/i&gt;.

00:00:12.848 --> 00:00:14.862
So right over here, what I have depicted

00:00:14.862 --> 00:00:19.492
are the different payments you would make
on a 30-year fixed mortgage.

00:00:19.492 --> 00:00:25.124
So this is a 30-year fixed mortgage

00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:31.975
where you have a fixed payment
every month of $1432.00

00:00:31.975 --> 00:00:36.233
and the loan amount is $300,000.

00:00:36.233 --> 00:00:42.923
So before you make your first payment
you owe the bank $300,000

00:00:44.053 --> 00:00:46.475
and you keep making these payments.

00:00:46.475 --> 00:00:50.608
And we've seen in previous videos
that your very first payment,

00:00:50.608 --> 00:00:53.637
as you see in magenta here,
is mostly interest.

00:00:53.637 --> 00:00:57.544
$1000 of that $1432.00 is interest.

00:00:57.544 --> 00:01:00.983
Then the next payment, you've
paid down the principal a little bit,

00:01:01.013 --> 00:01:06.023
not a lot, about 400-something dollars.

00:01:06.023 --> 00:01:09.363
Now your next payment,
$999.00 of it is interest.

00:01:09.363 --> 00:01:12.598
And the next payment,
$997.00 is interest.

00:01:12.598 --> 00:01:15.872
And you keep doing that
for all 360 payments.

00:01:15.872 --> 00:01:17.977
Remember, 30 years
times 12 months per year,

00:01:17.977 --> 00:01:19.606
you would have 360 payments,

00:01:19.606 --> 00:01:22.412
and as you get to the end
of your 30-year mortgage,

00:01:22.412 --> 00:01:25.282
most of your payment is principal.

00:01:25.282 --> 00:01:28.539
So on the 2 months before you pay it off,

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:31.912
that 358th payment,
only $14.00 is interest.

00:01:31.912 --> 00:01:36.144
Then the next one,
9 or 10 dollars is interest.

00:01:36.144 --> 00:01:38.518
Then, roughly $5 is interest

00:01:38.518 --> 00:01:41.043
and then you have paid off
the entire loan.

00:01:41.043 --> 00:01:45.243
So you have a fixed payment,
you also have a fixed interest rate.

00:01:45.244 --> 00:01:49.615
I haven't said what the interest rate is
for this mortgage,

00:01:49.615 --> 00:01:56.565
but then you pay it off over 30 years,
there's a 30-year amortization.

00:02:02.136 --> 00:02:06.947
And the word &lt;i&gt;amortization&lt;/i&gt; means
'spreading out' something.

00:02:06.947 --> 00:02:09.271
So in this case you're
spreading out the payments

00:02:09.271 --> 00:02:12.074
over 30 years.

00:02:12.074 --> 00:02:18.424
Why am I giving this as the preface
to a balloon loan,

00:02:19.976 --> 00:02:22.638
a balloon payment mortgage?

00:02:22.638 --> 00:02:23.723
In a balloon payment,

00:02:23.723 --> 00:02:27.183
this was a little confusing to me
the first time I learned about it,

00:02:27.184 --> 00:02:31.726
the &lt;i&gt;term&lt;/i&gt; is different
than the &lt;i&gt;amortization&lt;/i&gt;.

00:02:31.726 --> 00:02:39.036
So, for example, you could have
a 10-year-term balloon payment loan

00:02:41.546 --> 00:02:43.779
that still amortizes over 30 years.

00:02:43.796 --> 00:02:46.827
So what do I mean by that?

00:02:46.827 --> 00:02:51.208
Well, in this situation,
your payments could be exactly the same,

00:02:51.208 --> 00:02:53.709
but then after 10 years,
because it's a 10-year term,

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.908
you have the loan for 10 years,
after 10 years the loan is done for.

00:02:56.908 --> 00:03:03.598
So 10 years is 120 months,
this is the 10 years here.

00:03:03.598 --> 00:03:06.294
After 10 years, you amortize it.

00:03:06.295 --> 00:03:08.521
Remember this payment schedule
that we set up

00:03:08.521 --> 00:03:10.670
is based on a 30-year amortization,

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.490
just as if we were doing
a 30-year fixed rate mortgage.

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:16.976
But in the balloon payment,
if you had a 10-year term

00:03:16.976 --> 00:03:19.600
with a 30-year amortization,
the payments are the same,

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.499
but after the 10 years,
at the end of the loan

00:03:23.499 --> 00:03:25.407
you don't just make that 120th payment,

00:03:25.457 --> 00:03:28.058
you have to pay back
whatever the principal is,

00:03:28.058 --> 00:03:30.556
whatever is left on the loan.

00:03:30.556 --> 00:03:36.536
So we see that after 10 years,
what's left on the loan is $236,352.

00:03:40.797 --> 00:03:44.966
In a balloon payment, 
the loan lasts for 10 years

00:03:44.966 --> 00:03:47.858
even though the amortization,

00:03:47.858 --> 00:03:50.732
the rate at which
you're paying down the principal,

00:03:50.732 --> 00:03:54.102
is the same as for
whatever the amortization schedule is,

00:03:54.104 --> 00:03:55.856
the 30-year amortization.

00:03:55.856 --> 00:04:01.486
So the question is;
why does this thing exist?

00:04:01.486 --> 00:04:05.113
In some ways, this is like
what we talked about

00:04:05.113 --> 00:04:06.760
in the adjustable rate mortgages.

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.860
It's spreading the interest rate risk
between the bank and the lender.

00:04:10.881 --> 00:04:14.331
In a 30-year fixed loan,
all of the interest rate risk

00:04:14.331 --> 00:04:16.081
goes to the bank,

00:04:16.081 --> 00:04:19.416
while in an adjustable-rate mortgage,
all of the interest rate risk

00:04:19.416 --> 00:04:22.896
goes to the borrower.

00:04:22.906 --> 00:04:26.673
Here the bank is guaranteed
only to take on interest rate risk

00:04:26.673 --> 00:04:32.403
for 10 years, then after that
they get the balance of the loan.

00:04:32.413 --> 00:04:36.784
What does the borrower do,
or why would a borrower want to do this?

00:04:36.784 --> 00:04:38.148
They might want to do this

00:04:38.148 --> 00:04:40.646
because maybe they get
a slightly lower interest rate

00:04:40.646 --> 00:04:45.356
than with a 30-year mortgage,
while they get the exact same payments.

00:04:45.367 --> 00:04:46.878
They get a lower interest rate

00:04:46.878 --> 00:04:49.491
because the bank is taking on
less interest rate risk,

00:04:49.491 --> 00:04:54.561
they have less risk if interest rates
were to spike up 20 years from now.

00:04:54.564 --> 00:04:56.052
And a lot of people might say,

00:04:56.052 --> 00:04:59.942
"Well, I don't think I'm going to
own this property for more than 10 years

00:04:59.952 --> 00:05:04.615
as long as I get a 10-year fixed payment,

00:05:04.615 --> 00:05:09.015
if I sell the property in the 9th year,
then I just pay off the loan."

00:05:09.025 --> 00:05:13.168
Another possibility is that the person
thinks they'll end up with a lot of cash,

00:05:13.168 --> 00:05:16.659
maybe they expect an inheritance,
expect to earn more money.

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:18.832
Another possibility,
if none of that happens,

00:05:18.832 --> 00:05:20.378
if after the 10th year they say,

00:05:20.378 --> 00:05:22.955
"I still want to continue
paying this house down,

00:05:22.955 --> 00:05:24.284
I don't plan on selling it,

00:05:24.284 --> 00:05:29.174
haven't come up with some windfall of cash
to pay $236,000."

00:05:29.174 --> 00:05:35.550
Then they can just take out another loan
to borrow the $236,000.

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.652
And there's some risk involved there,

00:05:37.652 --> 00:05:39.295
because you have to feel good that

00:05:39.295 --> 00:05:41.821
at that time you'll still have 
a good credit history,

00:05:41.831 --> 00:05:47.021
you'll still have the level of income
necessary to get another mortgage.

00:05:47.026 --> 00:05:50.856
So hopefully this gives you a sense
of what a balloon payment mortgae is.

00:05:50.856 --> 00:05:56.776
It's not nearly as typical
as a fixed-rate 30 year

00:05:56.778 --> 00:05:59.478
or a 15-year fixed or 10-year fixed,

00:05:59.478 --> 00:06:03.918
or as common as an adjustable ARM
or a hybrid ARM, but they do exist

00:06:03.918 --> 00:06:07.232
so it's interesting to know about them.
