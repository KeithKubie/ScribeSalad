00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:02.320
- So hi, everybody.

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:03.220
My name is Sara.

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:04.740
And we are going to play a game.

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.600
What do guys think
this game is called?

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.268
- Simon Says.

00:00:07.268 --> 00:00:08.310
- How about we call it...

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:09.490
- Red light, green light.

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:11.070
- It's called The Shopping Game.

00:00:14.332 --> 00:00:16.040
How many of you like
to go food shopping?

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:16.340
You do?

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.715
How many of you guys like to
pick out things and put them

00:00:18.715 --> 00:00:19.330
in the cart?

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:20.170
Me, too.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:22.220
So today, you get to pick
out things and put them

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.720
in the cart.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.110
And there are three rules.

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:25.870
Rule number 1--

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:28.605
So this game is a nice
way of illustrating

00:00:28.605 --> 00:00:29.980
all the different
choices that we

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.160
have to make in our everyday
lives, which actually have

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.990
big implications for
the way that we eat

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:37.000
and our diets and
our long-term health.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.640
And so in this case, we took
a whole bunch of choices.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.210
And we said to the
kids, we're going

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:42.730
to put some rules
on those choices.

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.640
You can have five things,
but you get one treat.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.410
And you can't repeat
any of your choices.

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:48.640
And surprisingly,
there was actually

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.260
a fair amount of
variation among kids

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:51.670
who were roughly the same age.

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.970
All right.

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:52.990
Well, I think we
should go shopping.

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.860
What do you guys think?

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:54.360
- Yeah.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.238
- Grab your baskets.

00:00:55.238 --> 00:00:58.590
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.590
So how does this little game
relate to the broader research

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.110
that we do here at Harvard
at the Radcliffe Institute?

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.038
So number one, we are constantly
faced with food choices

00:01:07.038 --> 00:01:08.580
in the environments
in which we live.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.220
And it's more often the
case that the food choices

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.780
are unhealthy and not healthy.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.820
Particularly if you're
in a state or a city

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.695
where you have a large
low-income or minority

00:01:16.695 --> 00:01:18.642
population, those
populations tend

00:01:18.642 --> 00:01:20.100
to be at higher
risk for poor diet,

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.190
at higher risk for obesity, and
lots of conditions associated

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:24.730
with excess body weight.

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.330
And so there's a real interest
in thinking about, what

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.455
are the things that we can
do to change the broader

00:01:29.455 --> 00:01:31.620
environment to encourage
people to be healthier?

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.380
Can you tell me, of these
items, which is the treat?

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:36.010
- The soda.

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.720
- The soda.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.450
So one of these things
is a treat, Cecelia.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.370
Which one is the treat?

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.260
What is that again?

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.770
- Juice.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.530
- In life, one of the ways
that research becomes important

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.870
is, when we do put
rules in society--

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.390
like, for example, saying that
we're going to make beverages

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.760
cost more money if they
have added sugar, or saying

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.100
that we're going to put
calories on restaurant menus--

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.960
when we add those
sorts of rules,

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.240
does that either change
the way consumers behave,

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.640
or does that change the
way industries behave?

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.310
Why is juice a treat?

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.100
- Because it has--

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.105
because it has sugar.

00:02:07.105 --> 00:02:09.030
- And why is soda the treat?

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.949
- Because soda
has lots of sugar.

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:14.490
- So let me ask you a
question, if you were at school

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.380
and they served
juice all the time,

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.060
would you drink
juice all the time?

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.890
- Yes.

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:20.730
- You would?

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:21.330
You would drink it all the time?

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.780
Is that a good thing
or a bad thing?

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:23.250
- Bad.

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.125
- That's a bad thing.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.060
So when we think about
different examples of, is there

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.768
evidence to actually support
changes in our broader food

00:02:31.768 --> 00:02:34.310
environment that are actually
having an impact on our health,

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:35.490
the answer is yes.

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.360
And so if we start
with beverage taxes,

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.970
Berkeley was the first
US city to do this.

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.730
And what they've shown is that
about a year after the tax

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.150
has been in place, that people's
purchasing of those items

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.710
has dropped by about 10%.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.440
Sugary beverages are one
of the leading sources

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:52.880
of added sugar in our diet.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.130
And they are huge
contributors to weight gain.

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.650
They also cause dental
caries, or cavities.

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.670
Another example is on
the restaurant setting.

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.990
And so because there is this
federal rule now which says,

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:04.610
if you're a large
chain restaurant--

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.130
so if you have more than 20
outlets around the country--

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.590
you have to post
calories alongside price.

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.290
What the research shows
is, the impact of that

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.218
is not that you and I
make different choices

00:03:14.218 --> 00:03:15.260
at the point of purchase.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.370
There's a little bit
of that, but not much.

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.090
The impact is that restaurants
are changing the amount

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:21.380
of calories on their menu.

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.020
So for example, if you look
across these large chain

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.210
restaurants, the
average calories

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:28.640
in newly introduced
menu items has gone down

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.750
by about 70 calories or
12%, which may sound small,

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.790
but that difference
can actually really

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.020
have a big impact, particularly
because, on any given day,

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.770
a third of kids and a
third of adolescents

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:42.020
and a third of adults are
eating in these restaurants.

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.300
And so if you're carving
out calories and not

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:45.830
relying on people
to make choices,

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:47.960
you are going to have
more of an effect.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.820
- Thank you for playing.

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.220
- You're welcome.

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.950
- Thanks for playing
the shopping game.

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:55.906
- Thanks, Mom.

00:03:55.906 --> 00:03:57.810
- [LAUGHS]

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.240
- Bye.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.740
- 20 M&amp;Ms, that's it.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.290
- OK.
