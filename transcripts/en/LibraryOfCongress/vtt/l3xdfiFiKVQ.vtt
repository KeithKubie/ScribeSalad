00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.510
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:20.060
[ Silence ]

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.190
&gt;&gt; Maria Strong: So
welcome, everybody.

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:25.660
This is section six which is on
new ways to disseminate content

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.740
and the impact of moral rights.

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.630
My name is Maria Strong, I'm
with the copyright office.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.980
And we're joined here today
with, to my immediate left,

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.450
Scott Martin, who is Executive
VP of IP for Paramount Pictures;

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.790
followed by Alec French of
Thorsen-French Advocacy,

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.720
representing today the
Directors Guild of America.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.100
Next to him is Mr.
Stan Pierre-Louis

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.010
who is Senior Vice
President and General Counsel

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.490
of the Entertainment
Software Association.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:57.270
Next is Roxana Robinson,
author and President

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.770
of the Author's Guild.

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.640
And at the end is
Mr. Chris Castle

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.120
of Christian L. Castle
Attorneys.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.590
Today, as we've heard, we have
the opportunity to sort of wrap

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.210
up all of the exciting
things that we've heard

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.740
in the panels before us,
but also to really hear more

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.440
about the importance of
contracted transactions

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.260
and distribution practices.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.220
On this panel, we
have representatives

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.570
from private corporations,
from guilds,

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.070
from organizations
representing individual authors.

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.710
So this is an opportunity for
us to explore with you some

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.020
of the issues that
have been raised today,

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.290
as well as at the end, we'll
maintain some questions --

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.600
time for you all to ask us.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.440
So with that, what
I'd like to do is open

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.230
up with a question
for all of them.

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:42.800
We'll go down the line,
and then we'll start

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.940
up with more individual
questions just

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.820
to get the conversation going.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.800
So for everyone -- the question
that they have to consider

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.320
and answer for you all is:

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.390
what are the most
important elements present

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.620
in your industry that contribute
to supporting the concepts

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.660
of attributing author's
interest in the final work

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.860
and for protecting the integrity
of the author's contributions?

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.640
And what are the
biggest challenges

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.070
that you face in your sector?

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.890
And with that, we're going to
start with Mr. Scott Martin.

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.510
&gt;&gt; Scott Martin: And I should
probably note, Steve Marks,

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:12.470
who is supposed to be with
us, is under the weather,

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:13.850
which is why he's not here.

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.410
I really wanted to have
his placard in front of me,

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.590
because then I'd have
complete deniability.

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.880
"Did you hear what
Steve Marks said today

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.010
at the Copyright Office?"

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.130
[ Laughter ]

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.440
But they wouldn't give it to me.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.590
In order to answer the
question, I brought some visuals

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.500
because I come from
a visual world

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.260
and I can't speak
without images.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.730
And what I wanted to focus

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.630
on in answering Maria's
question is something

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.190
that we haven't really
touched on a lot today,

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:41.470
which is collective works.

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.130
We've been talking a lot
about individual work,

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:50.010
so works of things like
books, magazine articles,

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.010
photographs, sculptures.

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.280
I come from the world
of collective works,

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.650
which raises a lot of issues

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.940
that we haven't really
gotten into today.

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:04.490
And so what I wanted to do
was look quickly at how some

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:09.150
of these issues are
dealt with in Europe.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.020
So do European moral rights
apply to U.S. citizens?

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:15.670
The answer is yes.

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.400
No. Maybe.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.210
So even as we go through these,
when you're looking at countries

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:28.220
that are the home of hardcore
statutory moral rights,

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:29.510
there's not a lot of agreement.

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:30.970
For foreign work,

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.920
which country's law defines
the initial holders --

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.830
who is the initial holder
of the moral rights?

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.720
In other words, choice of law.

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.730
In some countries,
it's the local law.

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.680
In some countries, it's
the country of origin.

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.000
In some countries, it's
kind of unresolved.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.170
Who gets the moral rights in
a work created by an employee

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.530
on the job, in fact,
a work made for hire?

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.800
Some countries, it's
the employee.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.510
Some, it's the employee.

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.730
In still others, there
are no moral rights

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.750
in a true work for hire.

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:11.350
Who is the moral rights author
of an audio/visual work?

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:12.860
It's all over the place.

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.050
In almost every country,
it includes the director.

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:18.830
Some countries include
the composer; some do not.

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:22.230
Some include the
producer; some do not.

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:23.240
Several, as you see here,

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.600
France and Brazil
include possibly others.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.400
In some countries,
it's undefined.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.180
Who has the moral
rights in a performance?

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.400
Some countries, it's
the performers.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.530
As was mentioned, I think
it may have been Duncan

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.190
who mentioned it this morning.

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.340
In some countries, there are no
moral rights in a performance.

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:48.740
If there's more than one holder
of moral rights you will have

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.030
in a collective work, can one
holder alone block an act?

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:57.760
In some countries, yes;
some countries, no;

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.540
some countries, unresolved.

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:03.430
After the holder's death,
do moral rights survive?

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:04.830
This is an easy one.

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.900
Yes. In every country
that has moral rights,

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.090
they always survive death.

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:14.360
If post death, there's
more than one successor,

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.200
can that successor
alone block an act?

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.400
In some countries, yes;
some countries, no;

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.750
some countries, not so clear.

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:28.420
Is a contractual agreement to
waive moral rights enforceable?

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:32.190
Can you waive away
your moral rights?

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:35.910
In some countries, no; some
countries, yes; some countries,

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.930
no, but -- What about
limiting it?

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:42.830
Can you agree not to
waive it but to limit it?

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.350
Again, some countries, no;
a few more countries, yes,

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:49.380
but with limitations, usually
where it's a yes, but --

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:53.490
it's a yes, but for a
very specific agreement

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:57.840
to waive a very specific use.

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.780
So what all of this
does, I think,

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.190
is highlight the complicated
nature of moral rights

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:03.320
when you're talking about film

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.640
and television, and
collective works.

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:10.330
And that even in the countries
that have these robust,

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:13.740
long-standing statutory
moral rights regimes,

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.820
there's not agreement
on how you deal with it.

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:19.560
So what is the best
way to deal with it?

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.850
My view of the solution is --

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:24.490
and again, just talking
about film and television --

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:27.920
that effective collective
bargaining is the best way.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.460
And I'll stop there because I
think a little later we're going

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:32.050
to talk about collective
bargaining

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:34.970
and how it actually works.

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:36.340
&gt;&gt; Maria Strong:
Thank you, Scott.

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:37.300
Alec.

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.260
&gt;&gt; Alec French: Sure.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.090
Well, the Directors Guild
of America has long believed

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:45.610
that due to the unique
nature of filmmaking,

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:49.520
its members deserve recognized
statutory moral rights.

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:56.890
I think the best way to
explain this or to explain why,

00:06:56.890 --> 00:07:01.530
is I think a really eloquent
letter that the Directors Guild

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:04.160
and the Writers Guild submitted
to the House Judiciary Committee

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:07.080
for a hearing they did
in July 2014 on this.

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:09.100
Just to quote from it briefly,

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:11.480
"Funding a motion
picture is not the same

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.400
as actually creating it.

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:16.400
Holding a copyright does
not confer artistic talent

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.100
on a corporate entity.

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:21.120
Rather, it is the writer and
director's creativity and vision

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:23.850
that is decisive
to telling a story.

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:25.440
A myriad of intensely personal

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:29.180
and visionary creative decisions
give life to the motion picture.

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:31.590
Creative expression like
authorship is a human,

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:33.670
not a corporate, quality.

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:35.840
We believe that authorship has
to do with creative vision,

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:38.540
and that moral rights
reside with those

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:40.260
who have that vision."

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.280
So that's kind of
the starting point

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:46.370
for how the Directors Guild
looks at these issues.

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:49.050
And then to the second part
of the question Maria asked,

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:52.710
I think the biggest
challenge that directors face

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:57.050
in asserting moral rights is a
combination of two facts: one,

00:07:57.050 --> 00:08:00.290
there are no meaningful
statutory protections

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:02.110
for moral rights in the U.S.

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:06.320
; and two, and this is what
Scott pointed out, in the U.S,

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.470
motion pictures are
considered works made for hire.

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:11.610
And so directors effectively
don't have any statutory right

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:15.150
to control the motion
picture after creation.

00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:18.130
&gt;&gt; Scott Martin: Adding
to what Alex said,

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:20.320
not only do we not have
moral rights legislation

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:22.820
in this country, something
we haven't talked about today

00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:24.370
that affects the DGA
initial particular,

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:27.830
is we have anti-moral
rights legislation,

00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:30.490
which is the Family
Movie Act of 2005.

00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:33.510
I think Mary Beth
just passed out.

00:08:33.510 --> 00:08:36.040
[ Laughter ]

00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:40.120
That creates a right to
alter a motion picture

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:41.510
to take out the smutty bits.

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:44.060
[ Silence ]

00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:45.510
&gt;&gt; Stanley Pierre-Louis: I
hope that wasn't a lead-in.

00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:49.080
[ Laughter ]

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:51.980
So ESA represents the
video game industry,

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:56.690
and really it's U.S interests,
both on the U.S. publisher side

00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:57.860
and the game consoles.

00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:00.410
I'll touch a little bit on
international,but I'll veer

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:02.420
as much away from it as possible

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:04.590
since that's the province
of some other groups.

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:08.860
The interesting thing about the
way video game companies are set

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:12.500
up is that they are
partially like film studios,

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.150
television studios,
record companies.

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:16.980
And they are partially
like software companies.

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:20.660
So on the one hand there are
third-party collaborations

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:26.560
that occur where someone has
created a particular property

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:32.250
and that either gets acquired
or gets put into a larger work,

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:34.330
or maybe it is the work
that gets distributed.

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:36.950
On the other hand, many video
game companies actually hire

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:39.990
everyone, including the
composers and everyone else.

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:41.230
And so everyone is an employee.

00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:42.870
And so you've got this dichotomy

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:45.810
of both how specific
record companies are run,

00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:47.610
and how the industry may work

00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:50.770
in an acquisition
phase or otherwise.

00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:52.710
But under both models,

00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:56.620
what becomes difficult is
distribution if you need

00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:59.480
to get permissions all
along the way outside

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:00.040
of that initial model.

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:05.080
Because under the U.S. construct
at least, work for hire

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:08.230
and licensing of that nature
helps in terms of flexibility

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:11.800
and setting expectations
assembling the rights.

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:16.420
In other countries, as I talked
to some of my colleagues abroad,

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:19.820
particularly in France,
the key there is

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:22.240
to have good relationships
with third-party authors

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:26.010
because moral rights regimes are
so much stronger that you've got

00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:29.820
to make sure that you're
creating those relationships

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:30.960
to get things moving.

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:34.880
And that ends up being the
key beyond any contract

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:38.120
because if people feel like
you're using their work

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:41.760
in a positive light and a
way that they intended it

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:44.760
to be portrayed, things get
approved much more quickly.

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:47.370
And so the American side of
companies, when they look

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:50.250
at what happens, particularly
in Europe, are glad not

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:52.620
to have a moral rights regime
because it helps to be able

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:54.400
to assemble those
rights moving forward.

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:57.960
And I think the challenge
really is how do you change all

00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:00.910
of the expectations that
have built up over time

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:02.900
onto the construct, particularly
if you have a company

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:05.770
that hires lots of
the collaborators

00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:07.120
that make up a video game.

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:09.040
And I think that's going to
be one of the challenges,

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:11.570
is how you maintain
expectations while looking

00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:13.900
at the way the companies are
really set up in the U.S.,

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:15.110
at least in our industry.

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:19.630
&gt;&gt; Roxana Robinson: So I'll talk
a little bit about moral rights

00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:21.540
and also how they
affect the public.

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:23.450
Somebody raised that
question earlier saying,

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:24.860
"How does this benefit
the public

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:28.130
if we're protecting the moral
rights of the creators?"

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:32.650
We've heard that the moral right
accrues to a work that's created

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:34.590
by a single individual,

00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:38.030
only that individual could
create this particular piece

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:41.230
of work -- this book --
I'll talk about books.

00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:48.150
And as you have heard, the
Supreme Court has decided not

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:51.340
to hear our case, the case that
we brought up Google Books.

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:53.430
And I'll talk about that
a little bit in terms

00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:57.390
of the way it affects our
authors and their works.

00:11:57.390 --> 00:12:01.240
So one of the things that we
believe should be contained

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:02.930
within the idea of
moral rights is

00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:05.280
that you have control
over your work.

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:08.650
You created it and you
should be able to control it.

00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:11.690
At the very least, you
should be consulted,

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:16.110
your permission should be
asked for if your work is going

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:19.160
to be put into an enormous
database and disseminated

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:22.700
to the public at the
will of the aggregator

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:24.300
and it will have
nothing to do with you.

00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:27.940
So we feel that that is
a real problem in terms

00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:29.950
of the moral right
of the creator.

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:34.510
So what has happened,
the moral right

00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:39.890
and the fair use notions
have become sort of blurred.

00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:43.470
So what Google Books did
was to take 20 million texts

00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:46.210
without the permission of
the writers and put them

00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:51.790
into a database which is
accessible by anybody.

00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:55.950
So I'll describe a situation
in which that usage is made

00:12:55.950 --> 00:12:59.150
and how it affects the public,
and how it affects the writer.

00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:01.620
So we have a student who needs

00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:03.860
to write a paper
on "Anna Karenina".

00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:07.580
She goes to her computer
because it's easier than going

00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:12.590
to the library, and she types in
to Google Books "Anna Karenina,

00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:15.090
Leo Tolstoy, divorce".

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:16.690
She only needs to
know a little bit.

00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:18.660
She wants to write in
her paper about the fact

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:22.210
that Leo Tolstoy's sister
had a disastrous affair,

00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:25.200
she had a child out of wedlock,
and she considered suicide.

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:28.020
The student wants to
know when that happened,

00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:31.940
when Tolstoy died, and when
the book was published.

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:33.810
It's very easy on Google Books.

00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:37.330
A woman called Rosamund
Bartlett wrote a great biography

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:39.210
of Tolstoy and it's there.

00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:43.870
The student signs in, finds
those facts, and signs off.

00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:45.700
She doesn't need
to buy the book.

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:47.520
The library doesn't
need to buy the book.

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:49.550
So it's done.

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:52.790
However, Rosamund Barlett
-- I don't know her,

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:55.440
so I'm assuming this -- but
I'm assuming that she took

00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:57.460
at least five years to
write this biography.

00:13:57.460 --> 00:13:59.960
She went to Russia, she
interviewed Russians.

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:02.460
She might have learned
Russian for this biography.

00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:06.770
She read critical works,
she read Tolstoy's works.

00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:11.590
She created a unique
version of Tolstoy's life.

00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:15.050
She proffered that
to a publisher.

00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:19.000
The publisher gave
it peer review.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.720
The publisher edited
it, copyedited it,

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:27.540
made it into an object, and put
it out into the world for sale.

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:29.630
Now, as an economic model,

00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:33.820
the work of those two people
cannot be duplicated forever

00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:37.050
if there are no sales
transactions.

00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:40.040
Libraries traditionally have
been the great financial

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:42.760
supporters of non-fiction.

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:46.300
So academics have
depended enormously --

00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:49.500
people who write books
for the academic public --

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:52.650
have depended on the libraries
and the library systems.

00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:55.930
But Google Books can take
the work of anyone they want.

00:14:55.930 --> 00:14:59.260
They have taken the works of
20 million writers and put it

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:01.900
into a database that
gives no compensation

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:04.110
to the writers or
to the publishers.

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:06.960
That's a model that
cannot be sustained,

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:09.320
and that will cause
harm to the public.

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:16.210
If we cannot keep producing
excellent works that are created

00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:19.820
over periods of time through
a great deal of research

00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:23.330
and intellectual content,
that are peer-reviewed

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:28.670
and properly edited, the student
must find the right information.

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:34.110
She cannot rely on Wikipedia
or somebody's Facebook page.

00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:35.530
That is not going to do it.

00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:38.480
So she has to go to
a professional source

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:41.370
with material that is
absolutely reliable.

00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:43.140
She goes to a book
that's been published

00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:45.090
by a professional publisher.

00:15:45.090 --> 00:15:48.500
Interestingly, Chris sent me
an article about Google Books

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:53.230
that was published in 2009
when they were being accused

00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:57.870
of doing this in a way that
was damaging to the writers.

00:15:57.870 --> 00:16:00.680
And Sergey Brin, who is
a co-founder of Google,

00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:03.100
said ingenuously, "We feel

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:05.930
that this Google Books is
part of our core mission."

00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:07.410
This is news to all of you.

00:16:07.410 --> 00:16:10.510
"There is fantastic
information in books."

00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:13.120
[ Laughter ]

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:17.240
"Often when I do research, what
is in a book is miles ahead

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:19.340
of what I find on a website."

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:21.040
Who knew?

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:23.070
[ Laughter ]

00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:26.100
But the point is that books
are actually necessary

00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:27.210
for a society.

00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:30.240
It is necessary for the
culture to have access to them.

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.710
And in order to keep
producing good books,

00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:35.160
we have to have compensation.

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:36.580
That's all.

00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:38.550
&gt;&gt; Maria Strong: Thanks, Roxana.

00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:39.330
Chris.

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:43.840
&gt;&gt; Chris Castle: Well, I would
just add that one of the things

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:45.190
that doesn't get discussed a lot

00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:47.280
with Google Books is
the non-display uses,

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:49.540
also known as corpus
machine translation,

00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:54.710
for those of you reading
along, which is how they have

00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:56.190
such a translation engine.

00:16:56.190 --> 00:16:58.550
Because when you teach
a machine languages,

00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:01.210
you do it by comparing
text strings.

00:17:01.210 --> 00:17:03.060
And one of the ways you
get a lot of text strings

00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:05.050
that are identical
phrasing is to have books

00:17:05.050 --> 00:17:07.330
that have been translated
into a variety of languages

00:17:07.330 --> 00:17:10.300
which the publisher paid for,
which the author approved.

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:14.030
Right. So anyway, I can go on
for a long time about that.

00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:18.150
So I wanted to talk a little bit
specifically about songwriters

00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:25.350
and recording artists who are
subject in one way or another

00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:27.670
to -- some might call it the
boot heel of the government,

00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:30.260
or others might call
it compulsory licenses

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:33.390
under Section 114 and 115
in the Copyright Act --

00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:35.830
or what I would call
near compulsory licenses

00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:39.100
under the ASCAP/BMI
consent decrees.

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:41.690
So while there are
reporting requirements

00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:47.290
for royalty accounting in
these compulsory licenses,

00:17:47.290 --> 00:17:51.280
there's virtually no
attribution requirement in them.

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:55.180
So for example, if you were to
check, I would put even money

00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:58.180
on this, that the
most-used artists

00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:02.610
on Sirius XM is "various
artists".

00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:08.280
The reason it's various artists
is because Sirius doesn't go out

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:12.660
and buy the album for every
hit that they want to play

00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:16.220
on the radio; they go out and
they buy a compilation record.

00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:18.770
And then they rip that
compilation record --

00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:23.110
which they're allowed to
do -- into their system.

00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:27.890
And there's someone, usually
a minimum wage employee

00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:30.390
who we also used
to call a teenager,

00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:36.320
who is doing data entry,
right, in their system.

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:39.670
And they come to "who's
the artist," and they look

00:18:39.670 --> 00:18:43.280
on the label copy and it
says "various artists."

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:45.090
So they put in "various
artists."

00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:47.880
Right? And there's nothing
that requires Sirius

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:49.740
to do much more than that.

00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:52.750
So consequently, when that
kind of reporting comes

00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:55.850
to an organization like Sound
Exchange or somebody who has

00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:58.350
to figure out who to pay
and how much to pay them,

00:18:58.350 --> 00:19:00.220
they're looking at various
artists and they're trying

00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:01.810
to figure out well,
what does that mean?

00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:04.090
And so then they have to go
back and take the song title

00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:05.190
and so on, and so on, and so on.

00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:07.440
Whereas, if there had
just been a requirement

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:10.630
of proper attribution for
the artist, in that case,

00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:13.420
in the first place, that
wouldn't have been a problem,

00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:15.260
or would have been
less of a problem.

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:18.410
And it wouldn't have
turned so much on how

00:19:18.410 --> 00:19:21.100
that data entry person
was feeling that day.

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:26.400
I would also point out that
no digital retailer requires

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:27.910
delivery of songwriter credits,

00:19:27.910 --> 00:19:30.090
producer credits,
or musician credits.

00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:34.350
So iTunes has no
requirement that anybody,

00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:40.040
any label that's uploading --
or as they call it, rather,

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:46.400
discomfortingly, "ingesting"
music into their system,

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:49.840
actually provide them
with substantial credits.

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:53.050
In fact, there was not even
a place for composer credits

00:19:53.050 --> 00:19:56.890
in the iTunes info
section, which you can check

00:19:56.890 --> 00:20:00.130
when you go home, that even
had a slot for composer.

00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:03.460
Now they have a slot for
composer, but that's sort

00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:05.910
of voluntary on the part
of the record company

00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:08.290
as to whether they're going to
actually input any data there,

00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:12.430
and there's nobody that checks
whether it's right or not.

00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:15.620
This is really bizarre
when you stop and think

00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:18.850
that record companies have
extraordinarily detailed label

00:20:18.850 --> 00:20:22.020
copy management systems where
they keep track of all of this.

00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:26.680
Because when you put out a
CD, for example, someone,

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:29.440
mainly the artist
usually, approves all

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:30.990
of the credits that
go on that CD.

00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:34.100
And they want to have at
least the songwriter names,

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:36.650
they may put the publisher
names on there too.

00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:38.160
That lives in the background

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:39.620
in the label copy
management system.

00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:42.900
So if you see songwriter
names on the label,

00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:47.660
on the actual inlay card or
the actual credits in the CD,

00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:48.750
somewhere in the background

00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:51.060
in the label copy management
system, because it feeds

00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:54.370
into the mechanical royalty
system, there is the names

00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:57.450
of all of these publishers
that go with the songwriters.

00:20:57.450 --> 00:20:59.880
There's producer names,
there's musician names.

00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:02.840
There's a whole generation
of people that's growing

00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:06.770
up not knowing who
played on what.

00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:10.470
And that's mostly because
there's really no attribution

00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:13.860
requirements that are
meaningful for any

00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:15.390
of these digital retailers.

00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:18.690
Whereas on the label side,
you would tend to have them

00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:21.080
because they still put
out things in physical.

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:24.120
There's going to come a day
when that's no longer the case.

00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:26.170
Right. So we haven't
gotten that, you know,

00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:28.050
we're not at that
inflection point.

00:21:28.050 --> 00:21:29.360
But that day is coming.

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:34.740
Yet, on the song side, the
songwriters can't say no.

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:36.370
They have to license.

00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:38.590
They have to license
under those conditions.

00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:41.510
They have to license regardless

00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:44.680
of whether the person has paid
their mechanical royalties,

00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:47.130
knows who they are,
knows who to pay.

00:21:47.130 --> 00:21:50.350
That person can continue
getting compulsory licenses.

00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:53.040
If they've never
credited one songwriter,

00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:55.490
they can continue getting
compulsory licenses.

00:21:55.490 --> 00:21:59.240
Now, you can always sue, but
as we've heard earlier today,

00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:01.860
for the individual creator,
the individual songwriter,

00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:05.810
particularly as we go
circling down the drain

00:22:05.810 --> 00:22:10.100
in the declining revenues
of the digital reality

00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:11.300
in the music business,

00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:13.270
those people aren't
going to sue anybody.

00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:17.830
So I just wanted to point out
there's this nexus between --

00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:21.080
that would be I think
a pretty easy fix --

00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:23.760
although I'm sure the copyright
office is in full compliance --

00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:27.140
but it would be a pretty easy
fix to say well, if you're going

00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:28.650
to get a compulsory license,

00:22:28.650 --> 00:22:30.990
then here is what else
you have to do too.

00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:31.800
&gt;&gt; Maria Strong:
Thank you, Chris.

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:32.580
Thank you, all.

00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:35.520
What I'd like to do is -- we've
had a lot of conversation today

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:38.770
on a couple of issues:
contracts, technology,

00:22:38.770 --> 00:22:41.580
the role of fair use and how
it plays into moral rights,

00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:43.420
questions about commercial
speech.

00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:46.790
So as follow-up on what Scott
started, I'd like to kind

00:22:46.790 --> 00:22:48.640
of follow-up with
everybody a little bit more

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:52.450
on what do you think the key
contractual terms or elements

00:22:52.450 --> 00:22:53.700
that you have in your industry

00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:56.940
that offer these moral rights
type style of elements.

00:22:56.940 --> 00:22:58.430
I mean, we've heard
mentioned already some

00:22:58.430 --> 00:23:00.830
of the collective bargaining
and some guild contracts.

00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:02.720
But if we can maybe start
a little bit with that,

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:04.980
and if you can be specific
on what are the elements

00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:10.120
that support that kind of
morals rights like solution.

00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:12.970
&gt;&gt; Scott Martin: Well, in
my world, which is governed

00:23:12.970 --> 00:23:14.500
by collective bargaining,
which as I said,

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:18.460
I think where it's available and
applicable is the best solution.

00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:20.360
It comes out of the
guild agreements.

00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:23.190
So for example, the
WGA Agreement,

00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:25.880
the Writers Guild Agreement,
specifies the writing.

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:30.090
And as you know, we
cannot stop ourselves

00:23:30.090 --> 00:23:31.680
from hiring writers on movies.

00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:33.730
It's never good enough to
have one, you're going to have

00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:35.980
to have two or three or four.

00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:38.120
And then it becomes an
issue over who gets credit,

00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:41.340
who gets story by credit,
who gets written by credit.

00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:44.900
And all of that is
governed by the WGA.

00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:51.380
We submit a notice of proposed
credit, but it's the Guild

00:23:51.380 --> 00:23:53.670
who decides who gets the credit.

00:23:53.670 --> 00:23:56.510
Which is why no matter how
powerful Michael Bay is

00:23:56.510 --> 00:23:57.630
as a producer and director,

00:23:57.630 --> 00:23:59.850
you will never see him
get a writers credit on a

00:23:59.850 --> 00:24:05.670
"Transformers" film, because the
Guild will never give it to him.

00:24:05.670 --> 00:24:06.800
Just by a show of hands,

00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:08.620
how many people know
the difference --

00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:13.240
when you see a movie credit or
writers credit for two names,

00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:15.620
and there's an "and,"
A-N-D, between them

00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:17.260
or an ampersand between them?

00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:20.010
How many of you know
what the difference is?

00:24:20.010 --> 00:24:21.320
[ Laughter ]

00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:23.050
I see one and a half hands.

00:24:23.050 --> 00:24:25.080
[ Laughter ]

00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:27.610
An ampersand means that
they wrote as a team;

00:24:27.610 --> 00:24:31.940
and an and means they
wrote sequentially.

00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:36.260
Even a copyright/moral
rights-aware group doesn't

00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:36.750
know that.

00:24:36.750 --> 00:24:39.960
But believe me, the
writers know that.

00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:43.300
Similarly with SAG, with
the Screen Actors Guild

00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:47.540
for performers, we have a
whole list of requirements

00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:51.280
that there has to be a
separate card for the actors,

00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:53.970
it has to be readable
in terms of color, size,

00:24:53.970 --> 00:24:58.370
and speed, so we can't fly past.

00:24:58.370 --> 00:25:02.010
We are required to list
a minimum of 50 actors,

00:25:02.010 --> 00:25:04.710
and that's what's
called the SAG card.

00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:09.310
It's one of the first cards
you see in the end titles.

00:25:09.310 --> 00:25:12.610
There are very significant
financial penalties

00:25:12.610 --> 00:25:18.080
if we either don't do it at
all or don't list all 50.

00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:20.490
There is an obligation
to correct a print.

00:25:20.490 --> 00:25:25.980
So if we get it wrong, we
have to correct prints even

00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:28.020
after they're in distribution.

00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:31.880
Beyond that, we are required

00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:33.810
by the collective
bargaining agreement

00:25:33.810 --> 00:25:38.150
with the Screen Actors Guild
to obligate exhibitors,

00:25:38.150 --> 00:25:42.780
distributors, broadcasters,
not to cut the credits off.

00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:45.180
So AMC Theatres,
in order to squeeze

00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:48.840
in one more showing a day,
can't cut five minutes

00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:51.630
of credits off the
end of the film based

00:25:51.630 --> 00:25:53.910
on our contractual
obligation with them.

00:25:53.910 --> 00:25:55.470
Those are levels of protection

00:25:55.470 --> 00:25:57.840
that you'll never
get from a statute.

00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:02.400
And that's why I think where
it's available as it is

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:05.190
with commercial film
and television,

00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:08.170
the direct negotiation
is the best route.

00:26:08.170 --> 00:26:12.280
Just to say real quickly,
there's also integrity issues,

00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:14.480
integrity rights that
come out of this.

00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:17.220
We've been focused a
lot on attribution.

00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:19.970
But the Screen Actors
Guild has a reuse clause

00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:24.050
that we cannot reuse a
performance in any other work

00:26:24.050 --> 00:26:27.190
without the permission
of the performer.

00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:29.280
If we do it without the
permission of a performer,

00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:30.720
there's a financial penalty

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:33.490
which is three times
the daily rate

00:26:33.490 --> 00:26:36.020
for the actor times the
number of days it took

00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:39.200
to film the scene, times the
number of actors in the scene.

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:44.030
So it's a very significant
financial deterrent.

00:26:44.030 --> 00:26:46.530
But at the same time, there's
a bouncing because I talked

00:26:46.530 --> 00:26:50.390
about the veto right and
how does it work statutorily

00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:52.770
where you have a collective
work -- one author says,

00:26:52.770 --> 00:26:55.330
"I'm cool with this new
use," and another author

00:26:55.330 --> 00:26:57.340
of the same work says, "No."

00:26:57.340 --> 00:27:01.440
Under the Screen Actors
Guild, if there's a holdout,

00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:04.120
basically all of the actors
consent to the new use,

00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:07.430
consent to the financial
terms, but there's one holdout,

00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:12.850
we can submit it to the
SAG board of directors.

00:27:12.850 --> 00:27:15.360
And the SAG board of
directors decides whether

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:18.780
or not they can override
that one holdout actor.

00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:21.840
So there's a mechanism, and
it's a mechanism that's run

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:26.340
by the performers
to get around that.

00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:27.350
&gt;&gt; Maria Strong: Others?

00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:31.570
&gt;&gt; Alec French: I guess just
following up in the movie theme,

00:27:31.570 --> 00:27:33.780
Scott's absolutely right.

00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:37.600
Through collective bargaining,
some of the talent has managed

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:39.610
to secure creative rights.

00:27:39.610 --> 00:27:41.830
As I've become familiar with
over the last couple weeks,

00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:42.710
it's all right here

00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:46.860
in the Creative Rights
Handbook for Directors.

00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:52.350
And there are things that
are facsimiles of a right

00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:55.600
of attribution and rights
of integrity that you'd find

00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:57.320
in a moral rights regime.

00:27:57.320 --> 00:28:04.520
On the credit side,
"directed by" is the credit --

00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:06.070
the attribution that's
given to the director.

00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:09.310
There are very specific
rules on the lettering,

00:28:09.310 --> 00:28:10.520
the size of the lettering.

00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:13.310
It's either the last credit you
see before the movie starts,

00:28:13.310 --> 00:28:14.340
if the credits are
at the beginning,

00:28:14.340 --> 00:28:16.280
or the first credit you
see at the end if that's

00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:18.130
where the credits are.

00:28:18.130 --> 00:28:22.140
So that is a facsimile of
our right of attribution.

00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:25.540
And there's a facsimile on
the right of integrity side.

00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:28.240
There's something called the
director's cut where again,

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:32.930
through collective bargaining,
directors have the right

00:28:32.930 --> 00:28:38.380
to present the producer with
the version of the movie --

00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:43.040
their cut -- after a set
number of actual weeks

00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:45.180
that they're allowed to prepare
that cut, and they're allowed

00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:51.350
to present that to the person
in the production studio

00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:53.790
who has authority
basically over the movie,

00:28:53.790 --> 00:28:55.010
not over someone below them.

00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:56.510
And no one can cut
behind and kind

00:28:56.510 --> 00:28:58.560
of change it before
it goes to the person.

00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:02.570
So there are hard-fought
creative rights that are part

00:29:02.570 --> 00:29:05.220
of the collective bargaining
agreement that are similar

00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:07.720
to what you'd find in
a moral rights regime.

00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:10.840
But I want to be clear,
that still doesn't mean

00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:14.270
that Directors Guild
feels that it's complete,

00:29:14.270 --> 00:29:15.670
that all of the rights
that they'd

00:29:15.670 --> 00:29:18.310
like to be protected are
protected against all

00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:21.650
of the parties they'd like
them to be protected against.

00:29:21.650 --> 00:29:21.800
&gt;&gt; Stanley Pierre-Louis: Yeah.

00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:24.030
In our industry, it can
vary widely depending

00:29:24.030 --> 00:29:27.240
on the company, how
the game is made.

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:30.140
Often times, it'll be a lead
designer who leads the effort.

00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:31.680
There might be a producer --

00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:32.890
which I'll talk about
in one second.

00:29:32.890 --> 00:29:37.570
But there have been reports
that Grand Theft Auto,

00:29:37.570 --> 00:29:40.390
one of the big games put
out by Take-Two Interactive,

00:29:40.390 --> 00:29:43.640
it took 300 people to
put that game together.

00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:45.340
And they roll these
out every few years.

00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:47.820
And you can imagine
trying to figure out all

00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:49.180
of the various credits
of someone who came

00:29:49.180 --> 00:29:50.330
in for this portion
or that portion,

00:29:50.330 --> 00:29:51.930
it can get kind of complicated.

00:29:51.930 --> 00:29:56.220
But often times, a lead designer
or designers will be the ones

00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:57.750
who get a lot of the credit.

00:29:57.750 --> 00:30:00.560
In Japan, there's a
phenomenon of producers.

00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:04.750
Those of you who have not played
modern games probably aren't

00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:10.650
aware that they feel very much
like reality or like movies.

00:30:10.650 --> 00:30:14.660
They have storylines, they have
plots, and they change depending

00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:16.670
on what your character does.

00:30:16.670 --> 00:30:18.990
And they very much
are cinematic.

00:30:18.990 --> 00:30:22.540
Last year's E3, which is a
big expo for the retailers

00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:24.020
in the video game space,

00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:26.990
where retailers see the
new games coming out,

00:30:26.990 --> 00:30:29.470
there were lines out
the door for a few

00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:31.410
of the Japanese producers
who were visiting

00:30:31.410 --> 00:30:33.530
because people rarely
get to see them here.

00:30:33.530 --> 00:30:37.640
And so they really are treated
like rock stars and the likes

00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:41.790
of J. J. Abrams kind of comment
on works and play their games.

00:30:41.790 --> 00:30:44.080
It's very cinematic.

00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:45.400
But that's where it
becomes complicated;

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:47.710
is it more like a film or
is it more like software?

00:30:47.710 --> 00:30:52.220
And it will be very dependent
on the structure of the game

00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:55.780
and the structure
of the company.

00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:56.780
&gt;&gt; Roxana Robinson:
The best protections

00:30:56.780 --> 00:31:00.900
that authors have
traditionally enjoyed has been

00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:03.710
that of copyright, and
that has protected the work

00:31:03.710 --> 00:31:06.880
until we entered the
world of digitalization

00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:11.850
and electronic publications.

00:31:11.850 --> 00:31:16.190
So authors have lost a
good deal of protection

00:31:16.190 --> 00:31:18.840
that copyright offered once
their books can be taken

00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:20.630
without permission and put

00:31:20.630 --> 00:31:24.070
into other people's
databases and disseminated.

00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:27.810
What we would like to do at
the Guild is to create a system

00:31:27.810 --> 00:31:29.160
that will offer some kind

00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:33.460
of market-based collective
licensing,

00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:36.190
and we're working on that.

00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:42.520
Other than that, there
are other issues.

00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:46.170
Generally speaking, authors do
have the rights of integrity,

00:31:46.170 --> 00:31:49.420
but we're seeing
some kind of odd sort

00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:54.370
of piratical incursions
into people's books.

00:31:54.370 --> 00:31:57.240
And we're seeing
people's works translated

00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:58.860
into foreign countries --

00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:01.840
into foreign languages
and sold there,

00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:04.070
sometimes with a
gender reversal.

00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:07.930
So it will be a romance
book -- heterosexual --

00:32:07.930 --> 00:32:11.760
and it will turn up in
Germany being homosexual.

00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:18.080
Same book, same title, different
author, but a pirated version.

00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:19.910
So these are things
that are going

00:32:19.910 --> 00:32:23.190
to be very complicated
to deal with.

00:32:23.190 --> 00:32:25.650
I don't have a solution
right now

00:32:25.650 --> 00:32:29.670
where every time something new
comes up, we have to figure

00:32:29.670 --> 00:32:33.220
out a different way
of dealing with it.

00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:37.190
So I think the digital
era is just going to keep

00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:40.820
on offering new possibilities
in every direction;

00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:42.630
directions that we want
to go in and directions

00:32:42.630 --> 00:32:46.540
that we don't want to go in.

00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:49.470
&gt;&gt; Chris Castle: Speaking of --
I'm not sure it speaks generally

00:32:49.470 --> 00:32:52.000
about both songwriters
and recording artists

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:56.310
because you get at kind of
the same way in their deals.

00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:59.980
So if a recording artist is
signing with a major label

00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:01.990
in particular, but
really any label,

00:33:01.990 --> 00:33:05.390
and if a songwriter is
signing like a co-publishing

00:33:05.390 --> 00:33:06.980
and exclusive administration
agreement

00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:10.260
with a music publisher,
you typically will ask

00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:12.970
for something called
marketing restrictions.

00:33:12.970 --> 00:33:17.100
And these are sometimes
commercial in nature,

00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:23.890
but more often than not, they
are more in the integrity range.

00:33:23.890 --> 00:33:27.630
So you would say, for example,
you can't license my recording

00:33:27.630 --> 00:33:32.210
for advertising really of
any kind by the time you get

00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:34.170
through all of the
different examples.

00:33:34.170 --> 00:33:36.590
You can't license my
recording for a sample.

00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:39.230
You can't license my
recording in certain types

00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:41.790
of motion pictures
or television.

00:33:41.790 --> 00:33:48.440
You can't release my
recording in certain kinds

00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:50.050
of compilation records.

00:33:50.050 --> 00:33:53.330
So there'll be a number
of these exclusions

00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:58.470
that the record just is agreeing
upfront that they won't do.

00:33:58.470 --> 00:34:04.690
Now, that really comes
across in the first draft

00:34:04.690 --> 00:34:05.900
as a general rule.

00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:08.220
Now, there are things
that are leverage points

00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:09.950
that go beyond that.

00:34:09.950 --> 00:34:11.220
And depending on the artist,

00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:13.930
the artist may have some
particular bugaboos, you know,

00:34:13.930 --> 00:34:16.750
that they want to see
written in that contract,

00:34:16.750 --> 00:34:19.340
even though you say to yourself
there is no way the label is

00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:22.330
ever going to do this;
but they want to see it.

00:34:22.330 --> 00:34:26.270
And some of these are
not trivial either.

00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:30.330
I mean, there was a time
before the end of Apartheid

00:34:30.330 --> 00:34:34.440
where it was absolutely
standard to have your artist ask

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:36.810
to have their records
not distributed

00:34:36.810 --> 00:34:38.830
in South Africa,
and you'd get it.

00:34:38.830 --> 00:34:40.430
No one would argue with you.

00:34:40.430 --> 00:34:42.110
The leverage point really comes

00:34:42.110 --> 00:34:45.260
in more whether it's
during or after the term.

00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:48.210
So I'm not saying that
there's not a sense of leverage

00:34:48.210 --> 00:34:51.550
and how bad they want to sign
you, or if it's a renegotiation,

00:34:51.550 --> 00:34:54.440
how bad they want to
give you new terms.

00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:59.120
So realize, if you say it's
during the term, then that means

00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:01.750
as long as that artist is
a current roster artist,

00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:05.850
let's say, or is still in
contract with a publisher,

00:35:05.850 --> 00:35:08.420
then these restrictions
would apply.

00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:12.110
If it's after the term,
that means forever.

00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:17.010
Right. So when you stop and
think that record companies

00:35:17.010 --> 00:35:19.800
and music publishers
carry unrecouped balances

00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:22.620
that historical dollar
figures do not charge interest,

00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:27.340
and those will never
increase based on inflation.

00:35:27.340 --> 00:35:30.880
Telling somebody they can't
ever license your recording

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:33.500
for something that
might be a nice payday

00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:34.900
that would help you get recouped

00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:37.180
and help them recover
their investment is kind

00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:38.680
of a tough conversation.

00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:42.260
But it can be done, or it can
be done in a limited number

00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:43.430
of circumstances at least.

00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:45.350
So that's sort of
how it's addressed,

00:35:45.350 --> 00:35:47.490
similar to the way
the guilds do it.

00:35:47.490 --> 00:35:49.760
But it's addressed in a one-off

00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:54.940
because featured recording
artists don't have their

00:35:54.940 --> 00:35:57.000
own union.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:00.030
While they may be members of
the AFM or they may be members

00:36:00.030 --> 00:36:03.140
of SAG-AFTRA, they don't --
as in their capacities --

00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:05.500
featured recording artists
have anybody negotiating

00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:07.980
on their behalf in a
collective bargaining agreement.

00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:09.840
&gt;&gt; Maria Strong: I'd like to
follow-up on your point there,

00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:11.980
Chris, about market
restrictions.

00:36:11.980 --> 00:36:13.530
Earlier sessions
today have talked

00:36:13.530 --> 00:36:15.680
about issues involving
circumstances

00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:18.480
where the author may find
their work being used

00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:19.880
in objectionable circumstances,

00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:22.810
whether it's a commercial
speech issue, a political ad.

00:36:22.810 --> 00:36:26.530
I was curious to know, to those
of you who are copyright owners,

00:36:26.530 --> 00:36:30.990
maybe not the initial individual
artist, but can anyone chime

00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:33.140
in on your thoughts
about how you want to

00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:39.310
or how do you control or somehow
guide uses in those cases

00:36:39.310 --> 00:36:42.760
where maybe circumstances
involve objectionable contents

00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:46.160
that you might not want to
see your work associated with,

00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:47.240
your final work product?

00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:48.840
Anyone can chime in.

00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:51.510
&gt;&gt; Chris Castle: Well, I
can talk about samples.

00:36:51.510 --> 00:36:52.350
Right.

00:36:52.350 --> 00:36:52.780
&gt;&gt; Maria Strong: Yeah.

00:36:52.780 --> 00:36:57.850
&gt;&gt; Chris Castle: I used to work
at A&amp;M Records in Los Angeles

00:36:57.850 --> 00:36:59.180
for a number of years.

00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:07.190
And during sort of the 90s where
we had a lot of sort of the rise

00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:08.090
of hip hop and we had a lot

00:37:08.090 --> 00:37:10.460
of sample requests
that would come in.

00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:15.750
And so we had to decide what
we were going to do as a label

00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:17.170
about these sample requests

00:37:17.170 --> 00:37:20.220
and how we were going
to approach it.

00:37:20.220 --> 00:37:23.060
So basically what I
decided to was I said, "OK.

00:37:23.060 --> 00:37:26.600
I'm going to take my
cue from the artist

00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:30.010
who is being sampled," in
other words, our artist.

00:37:30.010 --> 00:37:32.590
"And if that artist, regardless
of whether they have the right,

00:37:32.590 --> 00:37:34.290
regardless of whether
they're in contract,

00:37:34.290 --> 00:37:39.160
regardless of anything; if
that artist wants to be sampled

00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:41.540
in this way and have
their recording used

00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:44.310
in the requested way,
then I will back them.

00:37:44.310 --> 00:37:48.090
I will then take over the
commercial terms, you know,

00:37:48.090 --> 00:37:52.670
so I'm not completely
giving up our control.

00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:55.350
But I will take my
initial cue from them.

00:37:55.350 --> 00:37:57.250
And I don't care how
much money they offer.

00:37:57.250 --> 00:37:59.230
I don't care what it is.

00:37:59.230 --> 00:38:00.920
If our artist doesn't
want to do it,

00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:02.130
we're going to back our artist.

00:38:02.130 --> 00:38:04.950
Or alternatively, if our artist
does want to do and I don't want

00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:07.020
to do it -- " which is
what happened with Sting

00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:10.490
on "Every Breath You Take"
that Puffy sampled, I thought,

00:38:10.490 --> 00:38:12.460
"That's like, karaoke, man.

00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:13.770
I mean, why do I
want to do that?"

00:38:13.770 --> 00:38:16.340
You know, but we did it
because Sting wanted to do it.

00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:17.080
And I said, "OK.

00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:19.040
In for a penny, in for a pound.

00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:21.070
That's how we do
things around here."

00:38:21.070 --> 00:38:22.780
But we didn't have to.

00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:24.420
Right. We made a
conscious decision

00:38:24.420 --> 00:38:26.650
that it's more important
to us --

00:38:26.650 --> 00:38:29.280
if we ever thought enough
of that artist to sign them

00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:31.990
to A&amp;M Records, you
know, if Herb Alpert

00:38:31.990 --> 00:38:35.600
and Jerry Moss wanted to be
in business with that artist,

00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:39.230
then we were going to back
the artist in that situation

00:38:39.230 --> 00:38:43.390
and let them control how
they wanted their persona

00:38:43.390 --> 00:38:45.580
to be replicated.

00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:46.550
&gt;&gt; Maria Strong: Thanks.

00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:47.200
Others?

00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:50.450
&gt;&gt; Scott Martin: I think because
of the season we're in right now

00:38:50.450 --> 00:38:53.930
where you hear some of these
claims is when works are used

00:38:53.930 --> 00:38:56.900
in political advertisements.

00:38:56.900 --> 00:39:00.390
And I think it's more often with
music when a candidate tries

00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:04.340
to use an iconic song as sort
of their anthem at rallies.

00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:06.350
And you've heard about
Bruce Springsteen going

00:39:06.350 --> 00:39:08.530
after politicians
who've done this.

00:39:08.530 --> 00:39:11.050
Neil Young has gone
after some people.

00:39:11.050 --> 00:39:14.640
It occasionally comes
up with movies and TV

00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:17.150
where clips are being
used in advertising.

00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:21.760
I would say most of it
is in local campaigns:

00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:25.660
school board campaigns,
local mayoral

00:39:25.660 --> 00:39:28.110
where they're creating
the campaigns themselves,

00:39:28.110 --> 00:39:29.750
there's not a big budget.

00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:34.700
And either they don't have
copyright or trademark advice,

00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:38.370
or they just don't think
anyone is ever going to see it.

00:39:38.370 --> 00:39:41.780
When we do get complaints
in those situations,

00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:45.010
99 percent of the time, it's
from the opponent in the race.

00:39:45.010 --> 00:39:46.040
[ Laughter ]

00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:47.170
As opposed to the talent.

00:39:47.170 --> 00:39:51.390
And for us it's a little
tricky because there is some --

00:39:51.390 --> 00:39:56.960
our works are generally
not being used like a theme

00:39:56.960 --> 00:39:58.680
of the campaign the
way a song might be.

00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:00.050
So we're not as concerned
about passing off.

00:40:00.050 --> 00:40:03.010
If you're talking
strictly about copyright,

00:40:03.010 --> 00:40:06.370
it might be a good
fair use argument.

00:40:06.370 --> 00:40:09.380
We also worry about going after
somebody who then gets elected

00:40:09.380 --> 00:40:11.110
to a very high office.

00:40:11.110 --> 00:40:14.110
I think in the 24 years
I've been at Paramount,

00:40:14.110 --> 00:40:18.340
I remember one incident where we
went after a national campaign,

00:40:18.340 --> 00:40:24.060
and it's because one of the
most iconic, famous directors

00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:29.960
in Hollywood, his granddaughter,
who actually moved in with him

00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:32.090
when she was 8 years old,
because she once told me

00:40:32.090 --> 00:40:34.840
that he was a lot more
interesting than her parents,

00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:39.990
was very upset in the last
election, a republican running

00:40:39.990 --> 00:40:43.210
against Obama was
using a clip from one

00:40:43.210 --> 00:40:46.520
of her grandfather's movies
and altering the clip.

00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:51.370
And this individual is a fairly
well-known lifelong republican,

00:40:51.370 --> 00:40:53.370
so it wasn't even
a political thing.

00:40:53.370 --> 00:40:56.850
She was very upset about her
grandfather's work being altered

00:40:56.850 --> 00:40:58.060
and misused.

00:40:58.060 --> 00:41:00.800
And we contacted the campaign.

00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:02.190
At that point we didn't
know who was going to win,

00:41:02.190 --> 00:41:03.980
so we were very friendly
with them.

00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:05.920
And they agreed to
stop running it.

00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:07.920
So we do ask.

00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:07.990
&gt;&gt; Maria Strong: Yeah.

00:41:07.990 --> 00:41:08.270
Alec.

00:41:08.270 --> 00:41:12.220
&gt;&gt; Alec French: I mean,
I guess I'm going to come

00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:16.160
at this a slightly different
way because objectionable is

00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:17.500
in the eye of the beholder.

00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:20.790
And Scott mentioned the Family
Entertainment and Copyright Act

00:41:20.790 --> 00:41:24.260
of 2005 which I had the
great pleasure of working

00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:26.640
on when I was on House
Judiciary Committee.

00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:27.840
And that's a case

00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:32.000
where directors found what
this company, ClearPlay,

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:37.030
was going to do with DVD
movies to be objectionable.

00:41:37.030 --> 00:41:38.460
They created software
that was going

00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:42.910
to enable the consumer using the
software to excise, as you said,

00:41:42.910 --> 00:41:48.290
all of the naughty bits: sex,
swear words, could have also

00:41:48.290 --> 00:41:51.720
in another generation of the
technology excise violence

00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:53.960
or whatever was considered
objectionable.

00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:56.940
Well, to a director,
obviously, you talk about right

00:41:56.940 --> 00:42:01.240
of integrity and attribution,
one, they don't maybe want

00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:03.160
to be associated
with what's presented

00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:06.060
on the consumer's screen that
is not their artistic vision;

00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:08.750
or two, they don't want
to let someone do this,

00:42:08.750 --> 00:42:14.060
basically destroy their movie
and their vision of their movie.

00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:17.740
Now, the problem is
that at that point

00:42:17.740 --> 00:42:20.030
in time the studios did not want

00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:22.260
to take a case against
ClearPlay.

00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:25.850
The copyright case probably
wasn't a very good one,

00:42:25.850 --> 00:42:29.500
and it was also a
politically-charged time,

00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:32.730
so going against companies
that are trying to clean

00:42:32.730 --> 00:42:36.550
up movies wasn't the
politically smart thing to do.

00:42:36.550 --> 00:42:40.490
But that left directors
with really no recourse

00:42:40.490 --> 00:42:42.840
because they don't have
statutorily recognized

00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:43.490
moral rights.

00:42:43.490 --> 00:42:47.060
And they did bring a Lanham
Act claim that wasn't --

00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:48.710
you know, they filed a suit.

00:42:48.710 --> 00:42:53.500
And of course, all of this ended
up exploding into legislation

00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:56.290
that actually, as Scott
said, rolled back, you know,

00:42:56.290 --> 00:42:58.400
made things worse for directors.

00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:00.760
But the point -- and I heard
this brought up, I wasn't able

00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:02.050
to be here all day --

00:43:02.050 --> 00:43:04.160
but clearly one thing
that's been discussed,

00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:06.700
and this is the core
of the concern,

00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:09.780
is in a collective bargaining
agreement with the studios,

00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:12.770
directors can secure certain
types of rights, attribution,

00:43:12.770 --> 00:43:17.650
and integrity, and have, and
can potentially even have those

00:43:17.650 --> 00:43:21.450
rights extend to parties with
whom the studios are in privity.

00:43:21.450 --> 00:43:23.090
And there are areas
where we've done that.

00:43:23.090 --> 00:43:25.670
But with regards to a third
party that has no privity

00:43:25.670 --> 00:43:30.040
with the copyright owner,
directors don't have any ability

00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:32.180
to protect what they
consider to be their rights

00:43:32.180 --> 00:43:33.490
of attribution and integrity.

00:43:33.490 --> 00:43:36.950
So there, really, when they
see something objectionable,

00:43:36.950 --> 00:43:39.820
there's not much
they can do about it.

00:43:39.820 --> 00:43:40.620
&gt;&gt; Scott Martin:
I always thought

00:43:40.620 --> 00:43:42.940
that was a very interesting
act by Congress,

00:43:42.940 --> 00:43:46.770
to say that you have a right to
watch a movie the way you want

00:43:46.770 --> 00:43:50.280
to watch, as opposed to
just not watching it at all.

00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:53.500
When we were making the
last "Jackass" movie

00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:55.750
and I would come home
at dinner and talk

00:43:55.750 --> 00:43:58.720
about the unbelievable things
the Jackass boys were doing

00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:02.060
that day, and my boys who
were in elementary school

00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:02.800
at the time would say, "Daddy,

00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:04.420
when do we get to
see the movie?"

00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:06.510
And the answer was, "Never."

00:44:06.510 --> 00:44:10.110
[ Laughter ]

00:44:10.110 --> 00:44:13.760
Actually, the answer was, "You
can watch it when hell freezes

00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:15.060
over or Mommy goes out of town."

00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:17.110
[ Laughter ]

00:44:17.110 --> 00:44:21.050
And about a year later, my
wife went out of town and one

00:44:21.050 --> 00:44:23.810
of the boys said to me, "OK,

00:44:23.810 --> 00:44:25.290
we're watching "Jackass"
tonight."

00:44:25.290 --> 00:44:26.320
And I said, "It was a joke."

00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:27.630
And they said, "No,
it was a contract."

00:44:27.630 --> 00:44:28.510
So clearly --

00:44:28.510 --> 00:44:31.050
[ Laughter ]

00:44:31.050 --> 00:44:33.430
-- there's a future
lawyer in the family.

00:44:33.430 --> 00:44:35.650
&gt;&gt; Maria Strong: Just to
follow-up, earlier today,

00:44:35.650 --> 00:44:38.650
Professor Ginsburg made some
interesting observations

00:44:38.650 --> 00:44:43.690
on the possibility of taking
a new look at the first prong

00:44:43.690 --> 00:44:45.820
of the Fair Use doctrine.

00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:48.250
What do you guys all think
about what she said today?

00:44:48.250 --> 00:44:52.730
And how might that
play into your issues

00:44:52.730 --> 00:44:55.950
in protecting moral rights
for your constituencies,

00:44:55.950 --> 00:44:59.270
to the extent -- I'm saying
moral rights moral rights-like.

00:44:59.270 --> 00:45:00.840
&gt;&gt; Scott Martin: One
thing that is interesting

00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:03.880
about that concept is
I think there are a lot

00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:05.840
of different impediments

00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:09.280
to get moral rights
legislation in this country.

00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:11.980
But one of the big
ones I think is the

00:45:11.980 --> 00:45:14.480
one-size-fits-all mentality.

00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:19.480
And to come up with a statute
that works for a photographer

00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:22.160
or an individual
writer, but also works

00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:24.940
with a collective work or work

00:45:24.940 --> 00:45:29.140
where there are very strong
collective bargaining rights --

00:45:29.140 --> 00:45:33.770
if you try to have one size
fits all, you're not going

00:45:33.770 --> 00:45:35.280
to satisfy all of those.

00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:38.730
And even when you look
to the European examples,

00:45:38.730 --> 00:45:42.050
essentially they do not have
effective collective bargaining

00:45:42.050 --> 00:45:43.970
in Europe for writers,
directors, and actors.

00:45:43.970 --> 00:45:46.630
And that's partly
for antitrust reasons

00:45:46.630 --> 00:45:47.650
that they're not allowed.

00:45:47.650 --> 00:45:49.700
My wife for many,
many years was head

00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:52.650
of the International
Federation of Actors in London.

00:45:52.650 --> 00:45:56.650
Worked on unionizing
performers around the world.

00:45:56.650 --> 00:46:00.520
And it's a real challenge
for them not to organize,

00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:04.140
but to bargain collectively
because of antitrust laws.

00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:09.500
And one thing I like about
the idea of working it

00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:15.480
into the fair use factor is
it's not one size fits all.

00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:16.700
You would be able
to look at things

00:46:16.700 --> 00:46:19.150
like is there a collective
bargaining agreement,

00:46:19.150 --> 00:46:21.190
or is it a collective work.

00:46:21.190 --> 00:46:23.920
So I think that's an
interesting concept.

00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:26.660
&gt;&gt; Stanley Pierre-Louis: I think
the other thing there would be

00:46:26.660 --> 00:46:30.140
what is this scope of what
we might call moral rights.

00:46:30.140 --> 00:46:33.950
So as I said before, in the U.S.
it's different than in Europe

00:46:33.950 --> 00:46:37.350
for our companies where a
moral rights question --

00:46:37.350 --> 00:46:40.610
if there's someone who's
owed the right of attribution

00:46:40.610 --> 00:46:41.770
and integrity, they confer.

00:46:41.770 --> 00:46:45.730
In the U.S., the issue
doesn't come up as much,

00:46:45.730 --> 00:46:48.760
but what does come up are right
of publicity claims in cases

00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:53.670
in which real life people claim
to be depicted in games just

00:46:53.670 --> 00:46:58.900
because their numbers, weight,
size in a game might be similar

00:46:58.900 --> 00:47:02.180
to how they actually play, and
the position might be the same.

00:47:02.180 --> 00:47:04.340
[ Laughter ]

00:47:04.340 --> 00:47:06.300
And how do you deal with that?

00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:09.810
And is that something that gets
codified in some different way

00:47:09.810 --> 00:47:11.840
than the way that it's
been dealt with now?

00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:12.650
And the way it's being dealt

00:47:12.650 --> 00:47:14.450
with now is actually
rather confusing.

00:47:14.450 --> 00:47:17.880
I think there was
a cert petition

00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:23.320
that was denied a few weeks ago
in the Electronic Arts case.

00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:26.060
But that would have been a nice
way to try to figure out which

00:47:26.060 --> 00:47:29.790
of the five various
tests was the one

00:47:29.790 --> 00:47:33.170
that was most applicable
depending on the jurisdiction

00:47:33.170 --> 00:47:35.230
in which you bring
your claim or reside.

00:47:35.230 --> 00:47:38.900
And so I think scope is going to
be very important there as well,

00:47:38.900 --> 00:47:41.310
because you're dealing not
only with personalities,

00:47:41.310 --> 00:47:45.520
but historical figures,
and all kinds of depictions

00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:47.700
that might require
a type of licensing

00:47:47.700 --> 00:47:53.500
that might make certain
games not feasible to make.

00:47:53.500 --> 00:47:55.600
&gt;&gt; Roxana Robinson: I agree with
the idea that it's not going

00:47:55.600 --> 00:47:57.090
to be one size fits all.

00:47:57.090 --> 00:47:59.320
And for writers -- I mean,

00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:04.010
what we're seeing is
this gradual dissolution

00:48:04.010 --> 00:48:05.810
of the notion that
writers have control

00:48:05.810 --> 00:48:08.340
of their work like
other creators.

00:48:08.340 --> 00:48:13.440
And the idea of moral
right is an inherent one.

00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:16.620
It's something that
you can't lose.

00:48:16.620 --> 00:48:19.650
This is something
that you have created.

00:48:19.650 --> 00:48:22.820
It didn't exist before
it existed in your mind.

00:48:22.820 --> 00:48:24.260
And you have a right

00:48:24.260 --> 00:48:27.120
of intellectual ownership
over that property.

00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:29.780
And we're seeing that
right being drained.

00:48:29.780 --> 00:48:34.240
And so for example,
with our authors who all

00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:35.690
of whose works were put

00:48:35.690 --> 00:48:38.390
into this database
without permission.

00:48:38.390 --> 00:48:42.310
The fact that piracy exists,
so that the owners now --

00:48:42.310 --> 00:48:44.770
the burden now is on the
writer to try to track

00:48:44.770 --> 00:48:48.680
down the pirates, the pirate
sites over and over and over,

00:48:48.680 --> 00:48:50.000
and request takedowns.

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:52.970
And the pirates simply
put them back up.

00:48:52.970 --> 00:48:55.210
So the idea of moral right --

00:48:55.210 --> 00:48:57.380
a kind of moral ownership

00:48:57.380 --> 00:49:00.590
of your work -- has
sort of vanished.

00:49:00.590 --> 00:49:02.430
So I think we're going to have

00:49:02.430 --> 00:49:06.790
to see more attention
being given to that notion

00:49:06.790 --> 00:49:11.760
of inherent right
that the creator has,

00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:14.500
which cannot be taken
away from him or her.

00:49:14.500 --> 00:49:16.930
And we have to figure
out solutions,

00:49:16.930 --> 00:49:22.010
collective licensing rights,
and situations in which it's not

00:49:22.010 --> 00:49:26.220
up to the writer to try to
track down the pirates all

00:49:26.220 --> 00:49:29.660
across the world and to
issue takedown notices.

00:49:29.660 --> 00:49:32.430
There has to be a better
sense of protection

00:49:32.430 --> 00:49:34.440
for the created works.

00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:38.890
&gt;&gt; Chris Castle: I think you'd
have to square the lens case

00:49:38.890 --> 00:49:43.510
with Article 27 of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights.

00:49:43.510 --> 00:49:45.350
Which, you know, in
the Ninth Circuit,

00:49:45.350 --> 00:49:50.230
we do a lot of considering,
but there's not consideration.

00:49:50.230 --> 00:49:55.630
So I think that David Lowery
actually wrote a comment,

00:49:55.630 --> 00:49:58.990
and I will speak for
him hopefully correctly,

00:49:58.990 --> 00:50:00.040
as he had to leave.

00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:03.990
He wrote a comment
on the 512 study

00:50:03.990 --> 00:50:09.560
that the Copyright Office
is doing, where he said

00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:14.050
that the way he reads the lens
case is he will essentially,

00:50:14.050 --> 00:50:16.830
as an individual copyright
owner, have to go out

00:50:16.830 --> 00:50:23.160
and get a legal opinion every
time he sends a takedown notice

00:50:23.160 --> 00:50:30.060
to make sure that he's properly
considered fair use aspects

00:50:30.060 --> 00:50:33.730
of the use by the
downstream user.

00:50:33.730 --> 00:50:39.170
So how the moral rights issue
would fit in, if that's the law

00:50:39.170 --> 00:50:42.570
and if the law is that
it's fair use for Google

00:50:42.570 --> 00:50:46.440
to copy 30 million
books, it's really hard

00:50:46.440 --> 00:50:53.670
to say exactly how moral rights
of any kind would fit into this.

00:50:53.670 --> 00:50:56.340
But the reason I mentioned
Universal Declaration

00:50:56.340 --> 00:51:01.090
of Human Rights is because that
article essentially acknowledges

00:51:01.090 --> 00:51:03.860
-- although it's the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights,

00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:07.790
so I don't know how much anybody
legally is really empowered

00:51:07.790 --> 00:51:08.250
by that.

00:51:08.250 --> 00:51:12.900
Although it's certainly
a relevant document

00:51:12.900 --> 00:51:20.570
for the good-and-evil
aspect of this.

00:51:20.570 --> 00:51:25.240
That article essentially states
that everyone is entitled

00:51:25.240 --> 00:51:28.600
to the moral and material
benefits of their work.

00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:31.030
So you know, if we're
going to go through

00:51:31.030 --> 00:51:35.370
and explain what the benefit is
to the public for moral rights,

00:51:35.370 --> 00:51:39.710
then let's start at Article
1 and kind of work our way

00:51:39.710 --> 00:51:42.370
down and see how we do.

00:51:42.370 --> 00:51:43.970
&gt;&gt; Maria Strong: Thanks, Chris.

00:51:43.970 --> 00:51:46.760
I think we've run out of
time for questions here

00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:50.010
from the dais, but we are going
to open it up to the floor,

00:51:50.010 --> 00:51:51.610
so if the mics can get ready.

00:51:51.610 --> 00:51:53.410
As the mics are coming
to you, I just wanted

00:51:53.410 --> 00:51:54.970
to let you know I
received some news

00:51:54.970 --> 00:51:57.890
that the resale royalty case

00:51:57.890 --> 00:52:00.940
in California was
dismissed this afternoon.

00:52:00.940 --> 00:52:04.660
Apparently the case -- it says
it was preempted by first sale.

00:52:04.660 --> 00:52:07.830
So for those of you who
are following royal rights,

00:52:07.830 --> 00:52:10.570
resale royalty, droit
de suite litigation.

00:52:10.570 --> 00:52:12.480
There's the second
interesting piece

00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:14.020
of litigation in the news today.

00:52:14.020 --> 00:52:16.680
So we open this to the floor.

00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:19.470
We did not get a chance to
talk about technology and CMI,

00:52:19.470 --> 00:52:23.550
so perhaps folks from the
floor might have a question.

00:52:23.550 --> 00:52:26.190
I'm looking.

00:52:26.190 --> 00:52:29.240
Oh. To Ben Ivans.

00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:30.290
&gt;&gt; Ben Ivans: Question
for Chris.

00:52:30.290 --> 00:52:33.360
You had -- if I understand
correctly --

00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:38.150
were noting that neither
compulsory licenses nor

00:52:38.150 --> 00:52:40.840
collective agreements --

00:52:40.840 --> 00:52:45.780
ASCAP/BMI consent
agreements address this issue.

00:52:45.780 --> 00:52:51.580
Do you know if the songwriter
community has ever sought either

00:52:51.580 --> 00:52:53.940
of those to be included?

00:52:53.940 --> 00:52:57.980
I mean, have they have said
in ASCAP/BMI negotiations,

00:52:57.980 --> 00:52:59.750
"We want to negotiate this"?

00:52:59.750 --> 00:53:01.920
Have they ever talked about 115

00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:05.330
or whatever saying this should
be an additional element,

00:53:05.330 --> 00:53:08.300
or have they not pushed that --

00:53:08.300 --> 00:53:09.130
&gt;&gt; Chris Castle:
I'm not aware of it.

00:53:09.130 --> 00:53:12.300
But then again, the compulsory
license rate was two cents

00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:14.520
for 65 years or so, you know.

00:53:14.520 --> 00:53:19.900
So I don't know why that is, but
I'm sure someone has an answer

00:53:19.900 --> 00:53:21.040
for it, but it is not me.

00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:26.530
Given that it would be -- if
you just applied inflation

00:53:26.530 --> 00:53:30.290
to the two-cent rate, I think
the compulsory license rate

00:53:30.290 --> 00:53:37.400
would now be something like
85 cents instead of 9.1.

00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:38.480
&gt;&gt; Maria Strong: Any
other questions out there?

00:53:38.480 --> 00:53:40.260
I can't see.

00:53:40.260 --> 00:53:44.820
Well, with that, let's stay on
tune and let's thanks the panel

00:53:44.820 --> 00:53:46.070
for their participation and --

00:53:46.070 --> 00:53:48.120
[ Applause ]

00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:49.950
Thank you all very much.

00:53:49.950 --> 00:53:53.030
We're going to start with the
close-up session right now,

00:53:53.030 --> 00:53:55.160
so our two moderators
will come right on up.

00:53:55.160 --> 00:53:58.650
Thank you so much.

00:53:58.650 --> 00:54:02.280
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
