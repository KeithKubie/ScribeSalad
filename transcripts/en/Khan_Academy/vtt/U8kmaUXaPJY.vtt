00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.060
Rewrite the following
expression as the product

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.360
of positive exponents, and
then evaluate the expression

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.410
when x is equal to 2.

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:09.810
So let's do this first part.

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.872
They want to rewrite it as a
product of positive exponents.

00:00:12.872 --> 00:00:14.330
So they don't like
the fact that we

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:16.890
have this negative
third power and the 5

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.300
to the negative second power.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.570
So we want to rewrite those
as negative exponents.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.920
And to do that, we just have
to remember that something

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.370
to a negative power is just--
let me write it over here.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.050
If I have x to the
negative two power,

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.630
this is the exact
same thing as 1

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.120
over x to the
positive two power.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.470
If I have a to the
negative b power,

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:48.164
this is the exact same thing
as 1 over a to the b power.

00:00:48.164 --> 00:00:50.330
You can get rid of that
negative by just putting a 1

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:51.246
over this whole thing.

00:00:51.246 --> 00:00:53.380
By taking the inverse
of the whole expression,

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:54.760
you can get rid
of that negative.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.680
So let's do that over here. x to
the negative three power, that

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.750
is equal to this-- let me
do this in different colors.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.430
x to the negative
third power, that's

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.440
the exact same thing as 1
over x to the third power

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.700
by definition.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.470
And we're going to multiply that
by 5 to the negative two power.

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.230
Well, 5 to the
negative two power.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:16.330
Same exact thing.

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:17.740
That's the same.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.240
That's the same thing as 1
over 5 to the second power,

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.150
or 1 over 5 to the
positive two power.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.520
And then finally, we have
just a straight up x squared.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.370
The exponent is
already positive there.

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:34.280
So, we could just leave
that as times x squared.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.340
So we did the first part.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.798
We rewrote the
following expression

00:01:36.798 --> 00:01:39.480
as the product of
positive exponents.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.070
Now let's evaluate
the expression

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.340
when x is equal to 2.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.430
So everywhere we see an
x, we should put a 2.

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.960
So this becomes 1
over 2 to the-- let

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.200
me do the same colors.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.450
This becomes 1 over
2 to the third power

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:04.550
times 1 over 5 squared
times 2 squared.

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.180
Every place we saw an x,
we're now putting a 2.

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.590
2 to the third power, just
a reminder, that's 2 times

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.620
2 times 2.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.190
That is equal to 8.

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.990
So this is equal to 1 over
8 times 1 over 5 squared.

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:26.980
5 squared is equal to 5 times
5, which is equal to 25.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.980
So this is equal to 25.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.070
And then we're going to
multiply that times 2 squared.

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:41.830
So 2 squared is 2 times 2,
which is equal to 4, so times 4.

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.886
And you could even do
this as times 4 over 1.

00:02:44.886 --> 00:02:46.510
And so you multiply
all the numerators.

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.470
That's what we do when
we multiply fractions.

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.510
You multiply all the
numerators, 1 times 1 times

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.300
4 is equal to 4.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:54.900
And you multiply
the denominators.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:01.970
8 times 25 is going to be 200.

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.326
And then you can simplify this.

00:03:03.326 --> 00:03:04.700
The numerator and
the denominator

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.510
are both divisible by 4.

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.870
Divide the numerator
by 4, you get one.

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.700
Divide the denominator
by 4, you get 50.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.589
So this is equal to 1 over 50.

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:16.130
And just so you see,
there's actually

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.730
a way to simplify it before
we even got to this stage

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:19.310
over here.

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.660
Actually from this stage, we
could have multiplied it out.

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.780
Let me just rewrite this thing.

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.690
So this product, if we multiply
it out, this 2 squared,

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.520
you could view it
as 2 squared over 1.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.580
So if we were to
multiply this out,

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.010
the numerator would
have been equal

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.250
to 1 times 1 times 2 squared.

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.010
2 squared is just 2 times 2.

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.570
So it would've been 2
times 2 in the numerator.

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.330
We can ignore the 1's, that
doesn't change the value.

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.610
And then the denominator would
have been 2 times 2 times 2.

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:50.110
That's what 2 to
the third power is.

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:54.720
2 times 2 times 2
times 5 times 5.

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.450
That's what 5 squared is.

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.334
And of course multiplying it
by 1 doesn't change this value.

00:04:02.334 --> 00:04:04.000
And then it would
have been more obvious

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.230
that you could divide the
numerator and denominator by 2

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.760
once, you could do
it again, and then

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:16.464
you'd just be left with
1 over 2 times 5 times 5.

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.339
And this, of course,
down here is 50.

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:23.840
This is 10 times 5, which is 50.

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.250
You would have gotten
the same result.
