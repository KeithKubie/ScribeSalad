Let's go back to Oliver at this point.

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:03.940
He has another interview question for

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:08.700
us that may help make this image creation process a bit easier.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.816
&gt;&gt; So one of the pain points of building an app is often that you

00:00:11.816 --> 00:00:15.720
have to handle having 1x images, 2x and 3x, and it's a real pain.

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.780
So how can you make it easier on yourself by using vector images?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.860
&gt;&gt; All right, I want you to think about this question for a bit.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:24.620
There are some links in

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.980
the instructor notes that will help you get to the answer.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.030
Here is your question one more time.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.830
