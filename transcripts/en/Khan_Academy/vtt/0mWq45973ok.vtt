00:00:00.569 --> 00:00:02.657
- [Voiceover] If this pages
was folded along the dotted

00:00:02.657 --> 00:00:04.811
line in the figure above,
the left half of the letter

00:00:04.811 --> 00:00:08.041
W would exactly coincide
with the right half of W.

00:00:08.041 --> 00:00:10.011
You see that right over there.

00:00:10.011 --> 00:00:11.950
If you fold it, this point
would go to that point

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:13.410
right over here, this
point would go to that

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.434
point right over there,
that point would go to that

00:00:15.434 --> 00:00:16.680
point right over there.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:17.795
And I could keep going.

00:00:17.795 --> 00:00:19.322
You have this axis of symmetry right

00:00:19.322 --> 00:00:21.448
over here right down the center.

00:00:21.448 --> 00:00:24.082
Which of the following letters, as shown,

00:00:24.082 --> 00:00:27.240
cannot be folded along
a vertical line so that

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.328
it's left half would
coincide with its right half?

00:00:30.328 --> 00:00:31.640
I encourage you to pause the video

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.182
and think about this on your own.

00:00:34.182 --> 00:00:35.947
Well, let's just think
about each of these.

00:00:35.947 --> 00:00:38.977
If I were to drop a vertical
line own the center of A,

00:00:38.977 --> 00:00:40.904
it looks like A is symmetric about that.

00:00:40.904 --> 00:00:42.575
There are mirror images on the left

00:00:42.575 --> 00:00:44.061
and the right hand side.

00:00:44.061 --> 00:00:48.541
Same thing for the letter I,
same thing for the letter O,

00:00:48.541 --> 00:00:50.596
mirror images on the two sides,

00:00:50.596 --> 00:00:53.533
same thing for the letter U.

00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:56.319
Now, E gets interesting.

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:58.963
We don't have a mirror image.

00:00:58.963 --> 00:01:00.403
If I were to take the
mirror image of this point

00:01:00.403 --> 00:01:01.331
right over here, we would get

00:01:01.331 --> 00:01:03.026
to this point right over there.

00:01:03.026 --> 00:01:04.826
If I were to take the
mirror image of that point

00:01:04.826 --> 00:01:06.601
right over there, well
that does get you to there,

00:01:06.601 --> 00:01:09.364
but this point over here,
there's no corresponding

00:01:09.364 --> 00:01:11.223
point on the other side here.

00:01:11.223 --> 00:01:12.837
If I were to go here, there's no

00:01:12.837 --> 00:01:14.860
corresponding point right over there.

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.240
In order for E to have been symmetric,

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.928
it should've either looked like this,

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.786
where if I were to drop
a vertical line there,

00:01:24.786 --> 00:01:28.805
this would be symmetric,
or if it looked like this.

00:01:30.718 --> 00:01:35.329
But obviously this is not
what the letter E looks like.

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:36.861
It does not look like
either of these symbols.

00:01:36.861 --> 00:01:38.763
It looks like this and this
one does not have a line

00:01:38.763 --> 00:01:41.702
of symmetry down its center axis.

00:01:41.702 --> 00:01:44.465
A vertical line cannot be drawn down

00:01:44.465 --> 00:01:47.459
its center to have a
line of symmetry here.

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:50.443
This is the one that cannot be
folded along a vertical line

00:01:50.443 --> 00:01:54.079
so its left half would
coincide with its right half.
