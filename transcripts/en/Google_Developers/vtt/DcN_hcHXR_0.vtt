00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:05.025
ERICA: Hi, I'm Erica.

00:00:05.025 --> 00:00:05.900
KOMAL: And I'm Komal.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.280
We're from Google Developers
and here to tell you

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.370
about Developer Student Clubs.

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:12.660
ERICA: Developer Student
Clubs train thousands

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.870
of student developers globally
and work with their communities

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.440
to solve real-life problems.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.440
SPEAKER 3: I'm sure you're
curious how it works.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.648
Google selects amazing
students from across the globe

00:00:21.648 --> 00:00:24.630
once a year to be a
Developer Student Club lead

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.520
and start a club
on their campus.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.260
SPEAKER 4: These
clubs host workshops

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.660
to help students learn
about Google technologies.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.090
SPEAKER 5: And they work with
local businesses, startups,

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.000
NGOs, even their universities,
to build real solutions

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.440
for real problems.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.810
SPEAKER 6: These leads
believe knowledge is power

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.060
and that technology can
do extraordinary things

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.720
for the world.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.310
ERICA: They take on
the responsibility

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.940
to help students learn and
empower these students to solve

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.452
real problems around them.

00:00:49.452 --> 00:00:50.910
SPEAKER 7: Through
this experience,

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.000
they not only bridge the gap
between theory and practice

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.760
for students, but leave
a legacy of impact.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.260
ERICA: Join us in building a
global community for students.
