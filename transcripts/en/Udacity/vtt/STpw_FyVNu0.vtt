00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Well, let's use this equation and plug in what we know.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Δy, the distance covered, is 10 m.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Plugging in the rest of what we know--

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
this is 0 because the initial velocity is 0.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Acceleration is what we're solving for, and we know the time.

00:00:11.000 --> 99:59:59.000
When we solve this equation for a, we get an acceleration of 1 m/s².
