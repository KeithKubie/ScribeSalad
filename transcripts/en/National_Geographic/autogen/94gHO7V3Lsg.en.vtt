that next is tunnel vision he told me

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800
that next is tunnel vision he told me
 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.720
that next is tunnel vision he told me
that I had got not as pigmentosum and I

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730
that I had got not as pigmentosum and I
 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.160
that I had got not as pigmentosum and I
didn't need to be having any more

didn't need to be having any more
 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.280

children and I didn't need to be driving

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290
children and I didn't need to be driving
 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:25.470
children and I didn't need to be driving
anymore and that was fat so I went home

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480
anymore and that was fat so I went home
 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.100
anymore and that was fat so I went home
and had to tell my husband you give it a

down his cheeks he said that he's dead

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.610
 
although here's notice the way this

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620
although here's notice the way this
 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.679
although here's notice the way this
array works is that it is placed on the

00:03:06.679 --> 00:03:06.689
array works is that it is placed on the
 

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:09.229
array works is that it is placed on the
surface of the retina on the inner

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239
surface of the retina on the inner
 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:12.140
surface of the retina on the inner
surface of the retina on the inside of

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150
surface of the retina on the inside of
 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.619
surface of the retina on the inside of
the eye the array really does not have

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:15.629
the eye the array really does not have
 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:17.899
the eye the array really does not have
any direct effect on the rod and cone

00:03:17.899 --> 00:03:17.909
any direct effect on the rod and cone
 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:20.599
any direct effect on the rod and cone
cells and in retinitis pigmentosa the

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:20.609
cells and in retinitis pigmentosa the
 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:22.899
cells and in retinitis pigmentosa the
Rodney cone cells are completely

00:03:22.899 --> 00:03:22.909
Rodney cone cells are completely
 

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:26.000
Rodney cone cells are completely
degenerated so what we're doing with the

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010
degenerated so what we're doing with the
 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.949
degenerated so what we're doing with the
array is we're stimulating areas of the

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959
array is we're stimulating areas of the
 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:35.270
array is we're stimulating areas of the
retina that are downstream from the rod

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280
retina that are downstream from the rod
 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.879
retina that are downstream from the rod
and cone cells specifically we're

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:37.889
and cone cells specifically we're
 

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:40.670
and cone cells specifically we're
stimulating a layer called the ganglion

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680
stimulating a layer called the ganglion
 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:46.009
stimulating a layer called the ganglion
cell layer and they form the optic

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019
cell layer and they form the optic
 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:49.849
cell layer and they form the optic
nerves and directly sends impulses to

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:49.859
nerves and directly sends impulses to
 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:57.350
nerves and directly sends impulses to
the brain

children my bridge just love to see the

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970
children my bridge just love to see the
 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.920
children my bridge just love to see the
beauty of nature however people talk to

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930
beauty of nature however people talk to
 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.190
beauty of nature however people talk to
me about what they're saying and some

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200
me about what they're saying and some
 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.000
me about what they're saying and some
areas I can picture my mouth because

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010
areas I can picture my mouth because
 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.120
areas I can picture my mouth because
I've been so blessed to be able to see

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130
I've been so blessed to be able to see
 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:51.740
I've been so blessed to be able to see
it my turn
