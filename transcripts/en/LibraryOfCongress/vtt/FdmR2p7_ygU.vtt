00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:04.506
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:08.990
&gt;&gt; I was tremendously impressed
by Slaughter's writing skill,

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:11.220
by her sense of place and character,
and most of all, by her seriousness.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.666
There was a lot of violence
against women in this novel,

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:20.696
but it was never gratuitous.

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.753
It was an angry woman saying
this is what is happening

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.280
in the world and we need to stop it.

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.370
I gave the novel a rave review

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.626
and predicted great
things for Karin Slaughter.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:32.580
Happily, I was right.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.580
I'm not always right.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.566
Her subsequent novels about
Sara Linton became bestsellers.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:41.570
And more recently, she has written
three excellent novels featuring

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.910
special agent Will Trent of the
Georgia Bureau of Investigation.

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.123
Her most recent novel
Broken, her 10th novel,

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.676
actually features both
Will Trent and Sara Linton.

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:59.276
There are a lot of outstanding
women crime novelists today.

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.636
We could mention Sue Grafton,
Sara Paretsky, Laura Lippman,

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.586
Elizabeth George, Martha
Grimes, Denise Mina in England.

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:16.470
Karin belongs on that list, and it's
a pleasure to present her to you.

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:17.510
[ Applause ]

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:23.250
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:24.933
Thank you readers and
people who are just inside

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.766
because this is the only shade.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.040
[Laughter] I've been
told it's getting cooler,

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.893
but I don't believe it.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.226
And I'm from Georgia so this
is sort of like winter for me.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.753
[Laughter] I wanna start
before I talk about myself

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.500
and how wonderful I am
by saying that we're

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.326
in a real national crisis here,

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.623
and probably you're
thinking, "In what area?"

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:50.070
because there are so many areas
in which we are in crisis.

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:51.723
But I wanna talk a
little bit about libraries

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.390
and how important our libraries are.

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:57.350
I don't know any writers who
didn't get a start in a library.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.223
And you know, in the south,
especially, because there's--

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:04.810
when we were growing up,
we're the only buildings

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.756
that had airconditioning.

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.230
But the library is the
center of every community.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.483
The people who use it in many cases
can't afford books, otherwise.

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.770
In rural areas, 85 percent of
the children in these areas,

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.240
the only time they have access
to technology or books outside

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.130
of school is in their
public library.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.850
And we really need to do our
best as a community to make sure

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.933
that libraries stay
open and fully staffed

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.366
because being a librarian is not
just a vocation, it's an art.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.066
And I know that I got my
start because the librarians

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.663
at my library saw what I was reading
and said, come over here, you know,

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.096
you need to stop reading
about the V.C. Andrews

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.926
and all these other books that are
routinely turned down in the corners

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.750
where the good parts are because
there are other books out there

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:02.863
for you, and they gave
me Gone with the Wind.

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:04.466
They gave me Nancy Drew,
Encyclopedia Brown.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.280
They gave me the gift of my life.

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.803
And there are so many kids out
there who are gonna be denied

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.443
that if we let libraries closed,
so I want it open for them.

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:16.510
[ Applause ]

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.586
&gt;&gt; Now, I also wanna speak in
phrase of the lowly thriller,

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.880
and this is something
that I ask usually

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.940
at the beginning of
events like this.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.640
Why is plot a bad thing?

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:39.363
The great thing about thrillers
is they have to have a plot.

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:42.270
They have to have a
beginning, a middle, and an end,

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:44.493
and that's what I like when I read
a story and that's what I write

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.006
when I sit down to write my books.

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.463
But it's interesting here because
the Library of Congress, of course,

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.216
is the center of this event.

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.750
And one of my favorite urban legends

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.386
or perhaps is not an urban
legend is the library of--

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.913
the catalog data for a book that
we all know, The Great Gatsby,

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.506
is filed in the Library of Congress
under Automobiles, Accidents.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.040
[Laughter] And I think of that

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:14.813
when people ask me what
sort of book she writes.

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:16.173
They'll take one look at
me and they say, "Well,

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.426
do you write children's books?"

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.980
And I always say, "Well, my
second book had children die."

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:27.473
So-- and generally, she had
some up, I don't know why, but--

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.890
or they'll say who's your
publisher and I'll say Random House

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.996
and they'll say, "Oh,
that's a real publisher."

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:35.556
So I don't know.

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.160
Maybe I should dress better or
they always want me to be taller.

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.526
But I think I'm writing in a genre
that is the best genre in the world.

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.366
And if I told you a story
about a local community leader

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:55.696
who was very charismatic
and angry at the government,

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:56.323
and this vicious prosecutor
who wanted to bring him down,

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.533
and paid off a snitch to turn
him in and framed him for a crime

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.343
and eventually gave this
community leader the death penalty,

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:07.670
you might think that's
a John Grisham book,

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.966
but it's actually the
story of Jesus Christ.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.973
Or if I told you about an alleged
rape in a small Alabama town,

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:19.173
of course, I would be thinking
of To Kill a Mocking Bird,

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.280
or a murderous elephant who
opens up like Water for Elephants

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:29.496
or the story of a pedophile
in Lovely Bones.

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:29.953
The interesting thing about
categorizing books is once a lot

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:34.140
of really smart and
educated people like them,

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:36.600
they stop calling them thrillers.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.413
And so my goal now is for you
to take away this one thing

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:43.646
that thrillers are the
best books in the world.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:46.600
[ Applause ]

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:48.600
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:51.440
When I think about what the
form really is meant to do,

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.000
it's meant to tell
the story of society.

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:57.620
And when I think about my favorite
thriller authors whether someone

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:02.853
like Denise Mina or Mike
Connelly, or James Lee Burke,

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:03.446
or if I go further back to someone

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:06.053
like Flannery O'Connor who'd
really use violence in the form

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:12.946
of the Southern Gothic to not
just talk about violence per se,

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:13.746
but to use it as a fulcrum to pull
the scab off the human condition,

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:18.166
because that's what's
people are really writing

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:20.033
about when they're
writing serious thrillers.

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:21.166
They're writing about humanity.

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:23.500
They're not just writing
about people

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:25.500
who have awful things
happen to them.

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:28.223
They're writing about the
aftermath of violence.

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:29.310
And you know, part of that interest
of mine comes from being raised

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:33.660
in the south during the time
of the Atlanta Child Murders,

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:37.160
and even though I was
not the profile

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:39.236
of the victim during the
Atlanta Child Murders,

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:45.816
I was probably the furthest thing
from it, I was terrified as a kid,

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:46.220
because when you're a
child, you don't realize

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:48.933
that bad things can
happen to children.

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:51.096
And it changed my life
in very meaningful ways.

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:53.366
I was no longer allowed
to play wherever I wanted.

00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:00.360
I started watching a lot more
television because, usually,

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:03.123
and anyone raised in the south knows
this, during the summer when you're

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:06.803
out of school, your mom kicks you
out of the house and locks the door

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:10.990
and says, "If you get
thirsty, there's the hose."

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:12.386
When they stopped doing
that, we were allowed to stay

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:13.663
in our houses during the day,
and so it really changed my life,

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:17.790
and it made me interested in writing

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:22.123
about how these life-changing
crimes occur

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:24.280
and what the violence leaves behind.

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:26.353
Another reason I think I'm drawn

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:28.390
to this genre is my grandmother
loved telling everybody secrets.

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:33.213
Now, she would have a heart attack
if we told hers, but, you know,

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:36.710
when I was a little girl she
loved taking us to church.

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:41.330
And my parents didn't like
me to go to her church

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:42.396
because they had basically
stopped handling snakes

00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:46.476
about a year before I was born.

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:47.756
[Laughter] And they put the
primitive in Primitive Baptist.

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:53.750
And my grandmother
loved showing me off.

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:54.140
And you know, every Easter Sunday
we would go to church with her

00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:58.670
and she would say,
you know, at the end.

00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:01.383
She would introduce me to
her friends and I'd be there

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:06.863
in my little Patent leather shoes
and my underwear with a little lace

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:07.773
on the back which is
very uncomfortable

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:11.320
in the seed I might add.

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:13.213
And she would say, you know, this
is Ms. Harris or this is Ms. Jones,

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:17.140
and then as soon as the woman
turned her back, she'd say, "Well,

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:19.620
you know, she's a drinker."

00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:22.763
[Laughter] Or you know,
"Her husband is cheating

00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:25.363
on her with the gardener."

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:26.830
You know, there was always
this dark, dark thing.

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:28.763
And another thing

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:31.296
that my grandmother loved was a
magazine called True Crime magazine.

00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:32.540
This probably is still published
today, but it's an awful,

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:39.520
awful magazine that's
basically violent pornography.

00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:40.160
And the covers would always have
a woman on the front, you know,

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:45.090
looking over her shoulder
and the headlines would be

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:46.616
"She Should Have Listened
to Her Husband"

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:50.683
or "She Should Have
Never Left the House."

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:51.246
And inside were all these
horrible true stories of women

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:54.866
who have left the house and
we're subsequently murdered.

00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:56.956
And this really tied in to stories
my dad told me when I grew up.

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:00.973
As the youngest of three girls, he
really realized early on he needed

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:05.013
to keep us in hand, and so most of
our stories that he's told us were

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:12.440
like the little girl who left open
the kitchen door and was killed,

00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:13.100
or the little girl who left
the heat on and was killed.

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:19.586
[Laughter] So you can see why
I come by this very honestly.

00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:20.413
But my grandmother loved reading
these True Crime magazines.

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:23.986
And one year, I had the great idea
that we would buy her a subscription

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:27.970
for Christmas because she
had to go to the trashy store

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:32.750
on the other side of town to get
the magazine 'cause it wasn't sold

00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:35.270
at our store.

00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:37.373
And so we bought her this gift and I
was right there at her knee waiting

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:40.586
for her to open up the little
card, and she read it and she burst

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:44.203
into tears, and she said,
"I don't want the mailman

00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:47.823
to know that I read that."

00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:52.023
[Laughter] And so I think that
here we are many years later,

00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:57.553
at a point in our lives, especially
as women where we can admit

00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:58.500
that we're interested in
reading about these things.

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:00.473
&gt;&gt; We wanna know about violence.

00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:02.873
We wanna know how people
respond to it.

00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:04.740
We want to know how it changes them.

00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:06.873
And that's really the
focus of my work.

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:09.003
Pat, who's a wonderful man, by the
way, a wonderful writer on his own

00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:12.563
and an excellent reviewer,
and I don't say

00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:15.223
that just 'cause he
gave me a nice review.

00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:20.956
But, you know, the wonderful thing
about crime fiction today is--

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:25.846
especially with women
writing about violent crime,

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:27.096
I think it's really changed
the tone of the genre.

00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:30.523
And I think in many
ways, it's made men

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:30.896
who write crime fiction even better
at what they do, because before,

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:35.510
I think, in the '80s and '90s,
women in crime fiction written

00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:41.790
by men were only there to be
saved or to have sex with.

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:44.346
And now, women go toe
to toe with men.

00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:45.000
And Lee Child is one
of my favorite authors

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:47.030
and I think he's an
excellent example of this.

00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:49.570
The women in his books are so
strong and they go to reach her

00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:53.473
and they face up to him,
and he respects them

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:59.600
and that's why I liked reading
a Lee Child book, you know,

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:01.143
as much as men can
identify with that sort

00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:05.390
of James Bond wonderful
Jack Reacher thing.

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:07.240
I think women can identify
with the fact

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:08.843
that Reacher really respects women.

00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:12.313
And that's a wonderful thing
to read about in crime fiction.

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:13.836
And I try to do that in mine
because I think it's important

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:17.560
when we're writing about topics such
as child abuse or domestic violence,

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:20.790
or that sort of thing, to
show that women are strong

00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:23.780
and that they're survivors,
and that they're quite capable

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:27.680
of saving themselves.

00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:29.036
And so I hope when you read
my books that you really see

00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:33.503
that that's what my focus is.

00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:33.836
And before I open up to questions,

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:37.103
which hopefully you guys
will have 'cause we got a lot

00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:41.703
of minutes left [laughter] and
warm up act for Scott Turow, so,

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.226
you know, throw me a bone here.

00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:49.043
My next book that's coming out
next summer is called Fallen.

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:50.666
And I got the idea for Fallen
because I was lucky enough to be

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:56.146
on a training exercise
with the agents

00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:56.953
of the Georgia Bureau
of Investigation.

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:00.103
And what they did is they took
over an abandoned school one day

00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:02.946
and they had a simulation where
there was a school shooter.

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:05.356
Now, before Columbine, and
actually during Columbine,

00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:09.776
the procedure when there
was a school shooting,

00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:10.866
was to go to the school
and establish a perimeter,

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:14.360
and then go from classroom
to classroom to classroom

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:17.066
and clear people out,
clear out the wounded.

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:22.293
Now, as we saw in Fort
Hood, the procedure is go

00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:23.740
and kill the person
who was killing people.

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:26.486
And so instead of being a standoff
that lasts for hours, it's something

00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:29.396
that only lasts usually
a few minutes.

00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:32.350
I think the shooter for the woman
who took him out, took him out maybe

00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:36.110
in three minutes after
she got the call.

00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:39.493
And so I was going with these agents
as they were being trained to go

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:42.613
through the school and look for the
shooter and take out the shooter,

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:45.936
sometimes kill him, sometimes just
subdue him and get him on the floor.

00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:49.596
And they have role players
and they had people screaming

00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:55.623
and people saying, oh,
this child's been injured

00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:56.603
or this teacher needs your help and
the agents had to ignore all of this

00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:02.303
and just find the shooter.

00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:02.770
And many of them were distracted.

00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:05.310
I was distracted as I
followed them through this.

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:07.270
And the remarkable thing to me
was the longest anyone took to go

00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:13.923
into the school and take
the shooter down was

00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:16.030
about a minute and 22 seconds.

00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:16.773
And if you think about
the lives that are saved,

00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:18.620
that's really a remarkable thing.

00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:21.620
And I think I feel-- I felt really
fortunate that someone who lives

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:24.446
in Georgi and has nieces
and nephews in schools

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:27.373
that they were doing this, that they
were practicing to do this because,

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:29.100
of course, unfortunately,
it's gonna happen one day.

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:32.706
And what I felt when
I was following them

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:35.106
through was this huge
rush of adrenaline.

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:38.103
And when I got home I thought,
I really wanna write about that.

00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:43.070
And so when I started
writing Fallen,

00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:44.003
I wanted my detective Faith Mitchell
to have a similar experience.

00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:49.010
It doesn't happen at a school.

00:13:49.010 --> 00:13:51.543
I haven't just ruined the plot for
you, so please still buy the book.

00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:54.943
[Laughter] But I wanted to talk
about that adrenaline I felt

00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:55.116
and really get in to the story.

00:13:57.050 --> 00:13:57.206
And it opened up so many different
avenues of this character just being

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:03.293
in that kind of situation.

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:03.740
And I think that's why I
love my research so much

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:08.050
because it gives me the opportunity
to walk in the shoes of someone

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:11.510
that I never would, otherwise.

00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:12.490
And it was just a thrill to do that.

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:15.013
So hopefully you guys
will enjoy and read it.

00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:19.646
And now I beg you, please,
have some questions.

00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:21.610
Anyone?

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.000


00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:24.110
[ Applause ]

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:33.440
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:35.286
I wanted to know-- well, I agree
with you that plot is important,

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:40.126
but it's your characterizations,
I think,

00:14:41.770 --> 00:14:41.836
is why I really buy your books.

00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:44.363
I just love them and I
wanna know two things.

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:49.110
One, are Will and Sarah
going to get together?

00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:50.930


00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:55.010
[Laughter] And two, Will's
disability and where that comes

00:14:57.420 --> 00:15:01.420
from in terms of-- perhaps your
background or interest or-- ?

00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:02.663
&gt;&gt; Well, I could only
answer one question,

00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:04.196
so I'll answer the one about Will.

00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:09.530
[Laughter] You'll have to
read the books for the other.

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:14.706
My sister had dyslexia and she
wasn't diagnosed until she was 30.

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:15.206
Well, not officially diagnosed.

00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:17.766
Before that, she was
diagnosed as stupid,

00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:19.603
and really that's what the
teachers told my parents

00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:25.156
and the great private
school system in Georgia.

00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:26.740
That's what they told my parents.

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:29.410
And so we did think that
she was just not very smart

00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:31.470
as we were growing
up and she's lived

00:15:33.070 --> 00:15:33.270
with that stigma for a long time.

00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:35.603
And when she finally
got the diagnosis,

00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:37.870
she said to the doctor,
"I can't read this.

00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:40.270
What does it say?"

00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:45.336
But she said, "Thank you because
all these years I just assumed I

00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:46.540
was stupid."

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:48.873
And she's really one of
the smartest people I know.

00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:50.590
And so, I wanted to write
a little bit about that

00:15:51.690 --> 00:15:51.933
and that's what got me
thinking about Will Trent

00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:57.313
and making him dyslexic
and making someone

00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:00.200
who has a disability the hero.

00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:01.440
Because, normally, in fiction,
when someone has a disability,

00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:03.153
they're either a maniacal killer

00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:05.150
or they are someone you
should feel sorry for.

00:16:07.890 --> 00:16:09.223
And I don't want anyone to
ever feel sorry for Will

00:16:09.890 --> 00:16:12.690
because he's really a
quite capable person.

00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:16.846
And as I was investigating
dyslexia to write more about it,

00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:19.743
I was looking at the
symptoms of dyslexia,

00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:21.916
and I thought these are
really the characteristics

00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:25.716
of a very good detective,
very puzzle oriented,

00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:30.743
very problem solving, very cued into
emotional cues, that sort of thing,

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:33.080
and so I wanted to incorporate

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:34.013
that into his character
and hopefully I have.

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:36.213
I've had a lot of positive
response from people.

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:41.146
And I think it's important
because in a lot of books, usually,

00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:42.526
you can tell who the bad guy is
because they don't like greeting.

00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:45.360
And it's sort of like in Hollywood
you know it's a bad person

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:48.960
if they smoke.

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:52.960
And so this is my double
bluff on people, too.

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:54.080
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:56.080
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:58.080
Yes ma'am.

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:00.946
&gt;&gt; Could you comment on the
character of Lena and the types

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:01.420
of complexities that
you've developed for her?

00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:07.006
She's difficult character
to actually engage with.

00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:09.820
&gt;&gt; She is.

00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:12.270
And you know, honestly, people
either love Lena or hate Lena,

00:17:13.370 --> 00:17:14.010
and that's how I wrote her because
I wanted you to know as a reader

00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:17.470
that it's okay not to like
a character sometimes.

00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:20.016
I want you to always read for her.

00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:23.516
I want you-- sometimes, you
may wanna shake her and say,

00:17:24.610 --> 00:17:24.680
"Why are you doing these
horrible stupid things?"

00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:28.286
But she's also a woman who
was sexually assaulted,

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:31.686
and I wanted to write realistically
about the recovery of someone

00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:34.503
who was sexually assaulted,
and I haven't ruined the plot

00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:37.473
for the first book because
that's what happens to her.

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:38.700
But a lot of people
assumed she wouldn't be

00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:42.940
in another book after that.

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:44.370
And to me that's when her
character got interesting,

00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:48.176
and she gets into a
really bad relationship.

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:49.653
She drinks too much.

00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:50.533
She does a lot of things that women
who are sexually assaulted do.

00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:55.920
And again, it was a response to
something I was reading in a lot

00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:57.920
of books where if a woman
was sexually assaulted,

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:00.713
you were either supposed
to just think of her

00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:06.700
as someone who's pitiful or you were
supposed to wait for the strong hero

00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:08.316
to come in and make beautiful
love to her and cure everything.

00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:13.196
And so, Lena was the
response to that.

00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:17.123
And I really worked hard to
make her as complex as she is

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:22.106
because this is something that has
defined her life for a long time,

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:22.756
but I think in the latest book,
she's learned to defined it

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:26.173
in other ways, maybe
not positive ways,

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:28.193
but she's certainly taken
more control of her life.

00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:31.780
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:33.780
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:35.780
Yes.

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:39.046
&gt;&gt; Hi. Thank you for your comments
about libraries, first of all.

00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:40.336
And also, people who read a lot
of series, sometimes they feel

00:18:41.290 --> 00:18:45.556
that there's maybe an agreement
with the audience and the author,

00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:50.003
and in one of your books,
I was completely shocked.

00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:52.016
&gt;&gt; Please don't spoil it.

00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:53.683
&gt;&gt; I'm not going to.

00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:54.816
But I wonder if you
had any resistance

00:18:56.350 --> 00:18:56.460
when you were thinking
about doing that.

00:18:58.840 --> 00:18:59.240
&gt;&gt; Well, it's hard to talk
about this without giving a way

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:02.663
of a major plot point,
but I did something

00:19:04.550 --> 00:19:06.816
that some people don't agree with.

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:07.620
And they-- you know, I got a
lot of nasty e-mails from people

00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:13.233
and I wrote back to all of them.

00:19:13.450 --> 00:19:14.713
And you know, the first thing
they said was, "Oh, wow.

00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:16.420
We didn't think you would write
back," which I thought, "Aha,

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:19.443
yeah [laughter] just goes to show
you you should be a little nicer

00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:24.930
when you write these e-mails."

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:25.170
We read these books to be
shocked and to be thrilled

00:19:28.090 --> 00:19:28.563
and to be surprised, and if you can
say I didn't do any of those things,

00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:33.286
then I would probably think in
my head that you were lying.

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:35.346
I wouldn't say it to your face.

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:38.946
But I-- here's the thing.

00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:41.570
No one wants to read
about happy people.

00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:45.823
You think you do, but
you really don't,

00:19:45.850 --> 00:19:46.580
even when you read Anne
Tyler, you're not reading

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:49.053
for the happy people,
you're reading for--

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:51.420
you know they're gonna be
happy somewhat in the end,

00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:53.033
but you want them not to be
happy for a really long time.

00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:56.600
[Laughter] And if she
was writing a series,

00:19:58.080 --> 00:19:58.146
they would never be happy ever.

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:00.813
You know, that guy,
that dog would be dead

00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:04.146
by now from accidental tourist.

00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:08.090
&gt;&gt; So that's a way of talking
around it, but I did on my--

00:20:08.690 --> 00:20:09.363
if you're friended with me in
Facebook, thank you very much, but--

00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:12.770
so I wrote a letter online
explaining why I did some

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:17.030
of the things I did in the books
that you can find, and if you can,

00:20:18.030 --> 00:20:18.683
just e-mail me and
I'll send you the link.

00:20:20.110 --> 00:20:21.910
&gt;&gt; Hi. Just for the record,

00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:24.320
that letter that you wrote online
was what kept me reading your books.

00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:28.513
&gt;&gt; Oh, it worked.

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:30.380
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I did.

00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:33.180
I was just-- because I've been
reading you for a long time

00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:33.586
and getting your newsletters
which are hysterical,

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:38.506
and you-- I mean you're a goof.

00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:41.090
[Laughter] How do you--
I don't know.

00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:47.653
It's just funny to find someone
who writes things that are so dark

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:50.880
and realistically horrible
that could be

00:20:55.450 --> 00:20:57.316
so nuts-- I mean [laughter].

00:20:57.450 --> 00:20:59.316
&gt;&gt; Well, thank you, I think.

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:00.940
&gt;&gt; I know.

00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:05.606
It didn't come out quite like
I mean it, but [laughter].

00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:07.190
&gt;&gt; I hope.

00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:09.923
[Laughter] Well, you know,

00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:11.523
maybe because I have this
sense of laid-backedness.

00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:15.990
If I could make up a word, I'm
able to write these things.

00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:19.570
Yeah. [Laughter] But,
well, that's a nasty laugh.

00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:21.376
Where did that come from?

00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:26.110
[Laughter] But all the crime writers
I know are great goofy people.

00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:26.606
I mean Michael Connelly,
Harlan Coben,

00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:29.086
I mean they're just silly guys.

00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:31.420
Stephen King is just a big old goof.

00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:36.820
On the other hand, no offense
to my colleagues here today,

00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:39.176
but romance writers can be some of
the nastiest people you've ever met.

00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:43.196
[Laughter] And I think--
we weren't even talked

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:44.020
about those drunks in
the children's booth.

00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:47.220
[ Laughter ]

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:54.490
&gt;&gt; But I think it's cathartic.

00:21:54.490 --> 00:21:56.956
I think we get it all
out on the page.

00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:58.180
And so it means that we can be
nice to people and open the doors

00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:01.486
for all ladies and do all the things
that you're supposed to do anyway.

00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:03.740
And for me, it is very cathartic,

00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:06.380
but I've always had this
interest in dark things.

00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:12.740
And I don't think that's in direct
opposition to my personality.

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:16.000
I think it's-- believe it or not,

00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:16.930
I think there's a lot
of humor in my books.

00:22:18.130 --> 00:22:19.000
I mean people maybe not--
few would ever think that.

00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:21.726
And I wrote a book called
Martin Misunderstood.

00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:22.756
And some of my Amazon reviews were
"Karin Slaughter, you're not funny."

00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:27.523
And you know, "Stick to writing
what you know" and all this stuff.

00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:34.270
So, when I've tried to
inject some of my humor

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:37.386
into this particular
book, it felt spectacular.

00:22:38.170 --> 00:22:42.236
So perhaps I should just keep
all my darkness in that one area

00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:42.846
and not cross over
though it's being made

00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:46.860
into a movie, the Second Monkeys.

00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:48.330
Yes.

00:22:49.330 --> 00:22:51.730
&gt;&gt; Do you have a routine
as a writer?

00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:52.583
You write in the morning
or in the afternoon?

00:22:54.170 --> 00:22:56.970
Do you do your research
first or as you go?

00:22:58.190 --> 00:23:00.723
&gt;&gt; Well, I research
all the sex myself.

00:23:01.290 --> 00:23:01.603
[Laughter] I wanted to see
what the sign was for that.

00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:05.510
[ Laughter ]

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:20.890
&gt;&gt; I wish I had a better
routine than the one I have

00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:22.726
because when I was writing
before I was published,

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:26.130
I had to do it whenever
I had the opportunity.

00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:29.246
And I was very careful to structure
time before work and after work,

00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:36.080
and-- 'cause I had a real
job and I had to do that job.

00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:39.806
So now, I kinda work that
same way, I have a cabin

00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:41.700
up in the Blue Ridge Mountains and
I go up there and sequester myself,

00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:45.593
and I just work from 8 in
the morning until 8 at night

00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:49.106
or however long I can and I do
this couple of weeks at a time,

00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:53.810
and then I'm so exhausted
I never wanna write again,

00:23:55.270 --> 00:23:56.000
and I have to go home and live a
normal life, and then I'm back.

00:23:58.740 --> 00:23:58.950
And, you know, about 5 years ago I
heard myself complaining about this

00:24:03.130 --> 00:24:03.933
and I thought, "Well, gosh,
it seems to be working.

00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:05.853
Maybe I should just keep doing it."

00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:12.200
So I wouldn't recommend anyone
write this way, but it works for me.

00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:14.020
Yes, ma'am.

00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:15.860
&gt;&gt; So I was curious that the
physician that you picked to be one

00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:18.640
of your main characters
was a pediatrician.

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:25.520
Could you talk about why you picked
a doctor that deals with children?

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:26.486
&gt;&gt; Well, when I first
made Sara a doctor,

00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:28.970
I thought that it would be good
for her to be a pediatrician.

00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:31.626
One because-- I mean, honestly,
women tend to be pediatricians

00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:38.580
and I wanted to use that construct
because when I was growing

00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:41.280
up in Jonesboro, Georgia which was
a very small town when I was there.

00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:47.600
The only role models we had were
school teachers, our nurses.

00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:48.593
And I remember when my mother
took me to the dentist once

00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:51.660
and there was a new dentist
and that was a woman,

00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:53.630
and I laughed because I didn't
think a woman could be a dentist.

00:24:55.490 --> 00:24:58.223
And so I wanted Sara
to be a pediatrician.

00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:00.330
I wanted her to deal with kids

00:25:00.330 --> 00:25:00.963
so she would know a
lot of people in town.

00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:02.956
Pediatricians know stuff about you
that you would not want them to know

00:25:06.570 --> 00:25:07.056
because your kids are
loudmouths and they're indiscreet,

00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:10.976
and they'll say things like
mommy was taking a shower

00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:12.450
with the postman this
morning or, you know,

00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:14.800
so anything you think is a secret
your pediatrician or your school,

00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:20.260
your child's teacher knows it.

00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:22.260
Maybe a librarian, be careful.

00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:23.836
But I thought it would be good
for her to have consciously chosen

00:25:25.930 --> 00:25:26.073
to leave Atlanta and
be in Grant County

00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:30.453
to be a role model for children.

00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:32.016
And in one of the earlier books, she
says that's one reason she doesn't

00:25:33.670 --> 00:25:34.113
like Lena Adams is because Lena
is the only female detective

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:38.033
on an all-male police force,
and she thinks "You're supposed

00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:41.026
to be a role model and
you're the worst role model

00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:42.813
for these little girls in town."

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:45.150
And I wanted Sara to have that
pride in what she was doing

00:25:48.010 --> 00:25:52.010
and to have made a conscious
choice to do what she was doing.

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:53.120
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:55.120
&gt;&gt; Anyone else.

00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:56.520
Well, I'm gonna get
the little things

00:25:58.120 --> 00:25:59.120
and this is all the time
you have pretty soon.

00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:00.823
So I would just like to say
thank you very much even--

00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:03.916
maybe if you're not happy with
some of the choices I made-- oop--

00:26:06.250 --> 00:26:08.250
wait, we got another question.

00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:09.450
&gt;&gt; I heard it too.

00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:11.050
I didn't get your signature
today because--

00:26:12.250 --> 00:26:14.006
I didn't get your signature
today because I didn't wanna be

00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:16.360
like cards blacked [phonetic].

00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:16.760
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, it was
hot over there.

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:19.560
I don't blame you.

00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:22.760
&gt;&gt; And then my next question is
are you gonna do a stand-alone book

00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:23.760
without Sara or Will?

00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:24.640
&gt;&gt; I made you a stand-alone book.

00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:27.116
I wanna write about
Amanda Wagner in Atlanta

00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:28.670
in the 1960s being a cop
'cause this was the time

00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:36.123
when the clans still ran the police
force, and this was the time--

00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:40.506
well, not until 1962 could a black
officer arrest a white person.

00:26:41.790 --> 00:26:41.800
And so-- I mean-- and you know,
this was shocking to me to realize.

00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:46.980
And I'd been investigating
the police force

00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:48.386
and doing a lot of
research into that.

00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:51.953
And I wanna write specifically about
what it's like for women to be cops

00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:54.623
because it hasn't changed that much
because women who survived during

00:26:57.230 --> 00:27:01.896
that time where the women who sort
of macho'd it up and didn't show any

00:27:03.930 --> 00:27:04.923
of their femininity because-- and a
lot of women here probably know this

00:27:07.670 --> 00:27:07.910
in their own line of work, but, you
know, it's okay for a man to throw

00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:12.403
up or be disgusted at a crime
scene, but a woman will not do that.

00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:17.163
And I thought to this one
police officer who just retired

00:27:18.550 --> 00:27:22.816
and was a cop in the 1960s and
she said, "I never peed on the job

00:27:23.910 --> 00:27:25.250
because if I knew if I asked to go
to the bathroom, they would say,

00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:29.770
'typical woman.'" And
I thought, well, one,

00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:30.910
your bladder must be
bigger than your head.

00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:36.123
[Laughter] But I thought it'd
be really interesting to write

00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:38.806
about that 'cause I grew up
on Cagney &amp; Lacey, you know.

00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:41.846
&gt;&gt; I have one more question.

00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:43.043
Every-- you only write once a year?

00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:44.720
&gt;&gt; One book a year, that's right.

00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:47.900
I'm sorry.

00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:49.166
You want it to be good, don't you?

00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:52.900
&gt;&gt; Yeah. [Laughter] Thank you.

00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:53.900
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:56.966
Well, let me-- so let me finish
it by saying I'm doing the job

00:27:56.900 --> 00:27:58.626
that I wanted to do since I was
a kid, and I don't think a lot

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:03.440
of people get to do that, but I
had a signing a little while ago

00:28:03.490 --> 00:28:03.956
and this woman came
up to me and said,

00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:05.756
"I went to kindergarten with you."

00:28:07.490 --> 00:28:08.156
And that's the worst
thing you wanna hear

00:28:09.490 --> 00:28:11.690
if you're an author 'cause you
don't remember them 'cause you're

00:28:11.490 --> 00:28:12.556
in kindergarten.

00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:15.913
And she said, "You know, I remember
you because when the teacher went

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:16.373
around and said, 'What do you
wanna be when you grow up?'

00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:22.626
You said you wanted to be a
writer and you're a writer today."

00:28:22.910 --> 00:28:23.626
And I'm the only other person in
class who answered that question

00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:26.893
that day and is doing exactly
what I said I wanted to do.

00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:31.076
