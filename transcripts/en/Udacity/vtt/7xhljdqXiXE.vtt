00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.422
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Since we know what points of intersection, the y value for the two lines that

00:00:04.422 --> 00:00:08.762
are crossing through there will be the same, we can set 0 equal to negative x

00:00:08.762 --> 00:00:13.370
squared over 8 plus 4x minus 14. And that's the equation we need to solve. The

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.843
solutions to this equation, values of x, will give us then the x values of the

00:00:17.843 --> 00:00:20.295
points where these two lines intersect.
