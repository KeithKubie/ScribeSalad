00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:04.500
SPEAKER: Police in
Russia recently pulled

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.410
over a hearse for speeding and
made an unexpected discovery--

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.290
$200,000 worth of contraband
hidden in the trunk.

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:13.790
And also the coffin.

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:15.540
The funny thing about
the accidental cost

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.200
is what was seized.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:17.925
It wasn't drugs.

00:00:17.925 --> 00:00:19.530
It wasn't weapons.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:20.710
It was caviar.

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.700
$200,000 worth of
illegal caviar.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.460
This report made
the rounds largely

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.930
on the strength of its
corkiness but it's actually

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.670
a small piece of a much larger,
ongoing story-- the story

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.940
of the illegal wildlife trade.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.700
That term covers a lot.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.300
Logging of exotic woods,
endangered animals

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.680
sold as pets, and
all sorts of wildlife

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.830
harvested for traditional
medicines and foods--

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:45.960
like caviar.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.350
It's a broad term but it
adds up to big business.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.950
In terms of money earned
for black marketers,

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.750
the wildlife trade is up there
with the drug and weapons

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:55.930
trades.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.710
Smuggling fish or
plants or exotic pets

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.440
is a classic high risk,
high margin outfit.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.660
In a lot of ways--
in fact-- it operates

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.390
a lot like the drug trade.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.080
There are petty, small time
dealers-- in South Africa,

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.320
for example, chameleons
are caught illegally

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.850
and sold as pets on
the side of the road.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.430
And then there's the big time.

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.450
Tiger skins reportedly go for
100 of thousands of dollars

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:18.510
a piece.

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:20.120
And profits like
that have attracted

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.040
the attention of
drug cartels looking

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.520
to diversify their businesses.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.140
In other words, the
drug and wildlife trades

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.570
are similar enough that they
are actually starting to merge.

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.390
For the most part,
wildlife smuggling

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.200
is something that
individual countries

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.170
have to manage themselves.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.150
The United Nations
did create a treaty

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.370
known as CITES, which lists
specific species under threat

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:42.460
of trafficking.

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.360
And recommends enforcement
policies to member countries.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.200
And the vast majority
of world governments

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.300
have signed on to that treaty.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.910
But CITES itself has almost
no enforcement power.

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.920
So like the UN, it's often
accused of impotence.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.446
Meanwhile in all those
CITES member countries,

00:01:58.446 --> 00:02:00.570
authorities are left to
their games of whack-a-mole

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.610
with wildlife smugglers.

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.510
That accidental caviar
bust is just one example

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.840
but it's actually
a pretty dire one.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.090
Caviar traditionally
comes from sturgeon

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.960
in the Caspian and Black Seas.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.120
Beluga sturgeon-- the largest
species in the family--

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.380
produce the most prized caviar.

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.310
And because of that they're
critically endangered.

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.810
In the 1990s and 2000s, beluga
experienced and 90% drop

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.310
in population.

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.880
In response, the US has
banned imports of it

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.240
and Russia has greatly
restricted beluga harvests.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.670
The root of the problem
is that eating caviar

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.870
is celebrated in Russia.

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.130
That wasn't always the case.

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.430
Back in the 13th century, it
was considered peasant food.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.390
But now caviar's popularity
is wrapped up in status.

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.710
And scarcity only inflames
it's exotic appeal.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.840
So what can be done about
demand for illegal caviar.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.089
Or for tiger skins or
chameleons for that matter.

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:56.880
Well one thing to do
at least, is make sure

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.250
that demand isn't meant.

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.540
Russian authorities are
taking this to heart

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.620
and doing with
seized caviar what

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.660
they'd be doing with seized
drugs-- they're destroying it.

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.370
Our profiting from-- and
disrupting of-- the environment

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.770
is not limited to wildlife.

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.270
Here's what happens when
natural resources are over

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:19.850
exploited as well.

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:24.780
This is a satellite image of
Padang, Indonesia in 2004.

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.170
This is that same place in 2008.

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.070
What happened in
between those two photos

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.720
wasn't an earthquake
or a typhoon,

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.200
it was one of the most
mysterious natural disasters

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.200
in memory.
