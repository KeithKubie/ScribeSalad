00:00:00.351 --> 00:00:02.510
- [Voiceover] The first
table above shows the number

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:05.971
of premium members at two
premium video rental stores.

00:00:05.971 --> 00:00:07.229
A number of premium members

00:00:07.229 --> 00:00:10.030
and then this is store A and store B.

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.870
During the years two
thousand to two thousand two

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.990
the second table shows the average,

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.710
arithmetic mean, number of video rentals

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:22.331
per premium member at store
B during each of those years.

00:00:22.331 --> 00:00:25.050
Based on this information,
which of the following

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.051
best approximates the total
number of video rentals

00:00:29.051 --> 00:00:31.131
by, let me underline this,

00:00:31.131 --> 00:00:34.691
the total number of video rentals

00:00:34.691 --> 00:00:37.531
by premium members at store B

00:00:37.531 --> 00:00:40.891
during the years two
thousand to two thousand two?

00:00:40.891 --> 00:00:44.849
So, we wanna concern
ourselves with store B

00:00:44.849 --> 00:00:48.930
between two thousand and
two thousand and two.

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.769
So, let's think about it a little bit.

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:54.689
In the year two thousand
how many total rentals

00:00:54.689 --> 00:00:56.129
would there have been?

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.088
Well, in the year two thousand you

00:00:58.088 --> 00:01:00.089
have five hundred premium members,

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:02.409
you have five hundred premium members

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:06.070
and on average they each rented twelve,

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.671
twelve rentals per year,

00:01:08.671 --> 00:01:12.470
so, the total number of
rentals per premium member

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.769
is going to be five hundred
times five hundred times twelve

00:01:16.769 --> 00:01:17.191
and you might be saying,

00:01:17.191 --> 00:01:20.900
"Hey, Sal, look, not all of
them rented exactly twelve."

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.061
But you have to realize this
average is actually created

00:01:24.061 --> 00:01:27.861
by taking the sum of all
the five hundred's rentals

00:01:27.861 --> 00:01:30.022
and then dividing by five hundred.

00:01:30.022 --> 00:01:32.901
So, if you multiplied
by five hundred again

00:01:32.901 --> 00:01:35.521
then you're going to get the
total number that were rented.

00:01:35.521 --> 00:01:38.127
Let me just, let me just, let me just,

00:01:38.127 --> 00:01:40.733
let me just clarify that for you.

00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:43.340
So, if you took, if you knew
the total that were rented,

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.801
total rented in two thousand,

00:01:46.801 --> 00:01:48.962
well, if you divided that by five hundred,

00:01:48.962 --> 00:01:51.262
if you divided that by five hundred,

00:01:51.262 --> 00:01:53.143
then you're going to get the average,

00:01:53.143 --> 00:01:54.544
you're going to get the average

00:01:54.544 --> 00:01:57.722
that were rented per or
the average videos rented

00:01:57.722 --> 00:01:59.263
per premium member.

00:01:59.263 --> 00:02:02.303
So, then if you multiply both
sides of this by five hundred,

00:02:02.303 --> 00:02:05.503
by five hundred, you're going
to get that the total rented

00:02:05.503 --> 00:02:07.799
is twelve times five hundred.

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.841
And you could view it as on average

00:02:09.841 --> 00:02:12.424
twelve videos were rented per member

00:02:12.424 --> 00:02:14.103
times five hundred members

00:02:14.103 --> 00:02:16.783
and that's exactly what
we did right over there.

00:02:16.783 --> 00:02:18.642
Let me clear this up.

00:02:18.642 --> 00:02:21.041
And so let me clear that up.

00:02:21.041 --> 00:02:24.318
So, now we can think about
the year two thousand and one.

00:02:24.318 --> 00:02:27.583
So, in two thousand, two thousand and one,

00:02:27.583 --> 00:02:29.463
and it's the same logic.

00:02:29.463 --> 00:02:31.303
You have a thousand premium members

00:02:31.303 --> 00:02:35.223
and they each rented on
average fifteen videos each.

00:02:35.223 --> 00:02:38.821
So, it's going to be one
thousand times fifteen

00:02:38.821 --> 00:02:41.001
and then finally in two thousand and two,

00:02:41.001 --> 00:02:44.652
two thousand and two you have one thousand

00:02:44.652 --> 00:02:46.591
two hundred and fifty premium members

00:02:46.591 --> 00:02:49.991
and they each rented twenty videos each

00:02:49.991 --> 00:02:52.230
or on average, twenty each.

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.230
So, if you sum these up
what're you going to get?

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.251
Let's see, five hundred times twelve.

00:02:56.251 --> 00:02:57.492
Five times twelve is sixty.

00:02:57.492 --> 00:02:59.654
Sixty, and then you have two more zeros.

00:02:59.654 --> 00:03:01.286
So, that's six thousand.

00:03:01.286 --> 00:03:05.599
One thousand times fifteen
is fifteen thousand

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:07.300
and then, let's see,
one thousand two hundred

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.264
and fifty times two would
be twenty five hundred

00:03:11.264 --> 00:03:13.464
but then you have another zero
so it's twenty five thousand,

00:03:13.464 --> 00:03:17.123
twenty five thousand, you
add these all together

00:03:17.123 --> 00:03:17.825
and what do you get?

00:03:17.825 --> 00:03:20.098
Six thousand plus fifteen thousand is

00:03:20.098 --> 00:03:23.465
twenty one thousand plus
twenty five thousand

00:03:23.465 --> 00:03:27.423
is equal to forty six, forty six thousand

00:03:27.423 --> 00:03:30.060
which is choice B.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.194
Choice B right over there.
