Jessica Tran: Mobile ASL is
an experimental application

00:00:07.167 --> 00:00:11.208
that provides real-time sign language
communication on cell phones.

00:00:11.208 --> 00:00:16.000
So this allows deaf people to communicate
in real-time using their mobile devices.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.250
And what makes us unique is
that we're able to transmit video

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.167
at very low bandwidth
using the 3G cellular network.

00:00:24.167 --> 00:00:25.292
Jaehong Chon: Well, about five years ago,

00:00:25.292 --> 00:00:30.125
we started the project for
different operating systems,

00:00:30.125 --> 00:00:32.208
but essentially we switched to Android

00:00:32.208 --> 00:00:38.292
because the most people used the Android
device than other existing platform.

00:00:38.292 --> 00:00:41.333
And then, the Android API
Android environment

00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:45.083
is much easier than other operating system.

00:00:45.083 --> 00:00:47.792
So I can easily access
to front-facing camera.

00:00:47.792 --> 00:00:52.375
I can easily access to some API
to display the video

00:00:52.375 --> 00:00:54.542
to send the data through the network.

00:00:54.542 --> 00:00:56.208
Jessica Tran: Since we're only
sending video,

00:00:56.208 --> 00:00:57.875
we're able to toss out the audio.

00:00:57.875 --> 00:01:00.333
So that already removes a lot of the data.

00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:03.917
And we're doing a lot of different video
compression techniques to send the video.

00:01:03.917 --> 00:01:05.750
For instance, we're sending video

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.917
at 30 Kilobits per second
at 15 frames per second.

00:01:09.917 --> 00:01:12.708
And we also do region
of interest encoding.

00:01:12.708 --> 00:01:15.417
So we identify the skin pixels,

00:01:15.417 --> 00:01:17.250
such as the hands and the face,

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.917
and when we transmit the video,

00:01:18.917 --> 00:01:22.167
there are more pixels devoted to
there as opposed to the background.

00:01:22.167 --> 00:01:24.125
So, the hands and the face
are more clear,

00:01:24.125 --> 00:01:25.542
but the background is sacrificed.

00:01:25.542 --> 00:01:26.083
Which is fine, 

00:01:26.083 --> 00:01:29.750
because it's really important for
people to see what's being conveyed

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.292
through the hands and the face.

00:01:31.292 --> 00:01:34.333
Jaehong Chon: Basically, there are a lot
of applications for the same purpose,

00:01:34.333 --> 00:01:37.167
like Skype, iPod, some of this program.

00:01:37.167 --> 00:01:42.125
But none of them provide the same
accessibility through the cellular network.

00:01:42.125 --> 00:01:48.750
So our goal is to provide the same
capability anywhere, anytime.
