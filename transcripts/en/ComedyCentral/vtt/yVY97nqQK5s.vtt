Is there anything funnier

00:00:37.303 --> 00:00:40.540
than a celebrity
pretending to sing a song

00:00:40.573 --> 00:00:43.910
that a different celebrity
originally sang?

00:00:43.943 --> 00:00:46.379
Yes, many things.

00:00:46.412 --> 00:00:48.181
You sheep would watch paint dry

00:00:48.214 --> 00:00:50.883
if it was called
<i> Celebrity Paint Drying.</i>

00:00:50.916 --> 00:00:53.319
Recently, a writer for Conan
got in some hot water

00:00:53.352 --> 00:00:55.154
for [bleep]
on other late night shows

00:00:55.187 --> 00:00:58.991
that rely on celebrity cameos
and games instead of jokes.

00:00:59.024 --> 00:01:01.394
Conan, of course, apologized
and told him to shut up.

00:01:01.427 --> 00:01:03.863
He deleted the tweets,
and all was forgiven.

00:01:03.896 --> 00:01:05.932
If any of my writers did that,

00:01:05.965 --> 00:01:10.736
I'd commend them for being
100% right for a change.

00:01:10.769 --> 00:01:11.971
Then I'd fire them

00:01:12.004 --> 00:01:14.507
just to show people
I'm in control.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:15.875
I never appear on talk shows

00:01:15.908 --> 00:01:17.677
because I don't want
to pretend to enjoy

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.345

Ah, you're right.
I am awesome.

00:01:24.016 --> 00:01:25.918
But if playing games
with celebrities

00:01:25.951 --> 00:01:27.487
is all it takes
to entertain you,

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.288
