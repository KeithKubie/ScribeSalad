00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.090
- [Instructor] In many
videos, we have talked about

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:04.860
how a bill can become a law.

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.890
It first gets introduced
into the Legislative Branch,

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.490
which in the United
States, is the US Congress

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.300
at the federal level, and
if it passes both Houses

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.840
of Congress, then the bill
will go to the president,

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.955
and if the president signs the bill

00:00:18.955 --> 00:00:21.140
or if the president vetoes the bill

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.160
but then it gets overruled
by Legislative, then,

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.870
let's just assume that the
president signs, signs the bill,

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.970
then that bill becomes a law.

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:32.550
It becomes a law.

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.000
But the question is is how is
this law actually implemented?

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.450
And you might guess that that is the work

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.340
of the bureaucracy, and
we've already talked about

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.980
the bureaucracy in
multiple videos already.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.750
The bureaucracy is part
of the Executive Branch.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.770
It's actually the bulk
of federal employees.

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.750
And as we'll see, as part of
this implementing process,

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.650
the bureaucracy has
authority on rulemaking

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.720
and it also has discretionary authority.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.020
Let me write that down.

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:07.650
So the bureaucracy, bureaucracy,

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.400
is going to implement the law,

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.003
and they have different
types of authority to do so.

00:01:14.003 --> 00:01:15.848
They have rulemaking authority,

00:01:15.848 --> 00:01:19.010
where for specific
circumstances, they must say,

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.390
"Hey. This is how it's going to work,"

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.130
that the law itself does not specify it,

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.270
but based on what that
law is trying to do,

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.450
they are going to set some
rules, and as we'll see,

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.470
the people working inside the bureaucracy,

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.568
many of whom are experts
on whatever policy

00:01:31.568 --> 00:01:34.637
they are trying to implement
have some discretion

00:01:34.637 --> 00:01:38.110
on how they actually implement this law.

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.020
So their authority, sometimes you'll hear

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.690
rulemaking authority and
discretionary authority.

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.220
And as an example of that,

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.840
we can look at what is
often known as Title IX.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.025
So this right over here is Title IX

00:01:51.025 --> 00:01:53.630
of the Education Amendments of 1972.

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.300
It passed through Congress
and then was signed into law

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.550
by President Nixon, and it says,

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.710
"No person in the United States
shall, on the basis of sex,

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.400
"be excluded from participation in,

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.400
"be denied the benefits of,

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.700
"or be subjected to discrimination

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.110
"under any education program or activity

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.240
"receiving Federal financial assistance."

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.990
So this gets through the legislature,

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.100
President Nixon signs it, becomes a law,

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.910
but then how does this thing
actually get implemented?

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.010
And so this, as we've
already talked about,

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.030
is the job of the bureaucracy.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.954
And it's not just one department.

00:02:29.954 --> 00:02:32.410
Many departments of the federal government

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:33.470
are going to have to think about

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.296
how do they implement this
statute right over here?

00:02:37.296 --> 00:02:40.920
And as an example of how, say
the Department of Education

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.230
thought about it, I'll give
you a little bit of an excerpt

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.830
from their rules and regulations.

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.370
So this right over here
is part of the rules

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.660
and regulations from the
Department of Education

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.100
in their attempt to implement Title IX.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.760
And as I really think
about what part of this

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.330
really shows the bureaucracy's
rulemaking authority

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.300
and what part shows its
discretionary authority?

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.840
"Every application for
Federal financial assistance

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.160
"shall as condition of
its approval contain

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.480
"or be accompanied by an
assurance from the applicant

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.970
"or recipient, satisfactory
to the Assistant Secretary,

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.230
"that the education program or activity

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.600
"operated by the applicant or recipient

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.800
"and to which this part
applies will be operated

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.660
"in compliance with this part."

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.310
So that is a mouthful.

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.110
I will help you parse it a little bit.

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.770
So in this document, the
term applicant and recipient,

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:40.570
these are the institutions that are either

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.020
applying for federal assistance

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.600
or have already received
financial assistance

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.360
and it's saying every application

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.800
for Federal financial assistance

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.193
shall as condition for
its approval contain

00:03:51.193 --> 00:03:54.490
or be accompanied by an
assurance from the applicant

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:55.460
or recipient.

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:56.600
So the big picture.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.810
This whole thing is a
rule that is being set up

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.700
by the Office of Civil Rights

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.010
within the Department of Education.

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.540
So it clearly shows rulemaking authority.

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.913
And this is just one part of
a much, much larger document

00:04:10.913 --> 00:04:14.520
full of rules on how just
the Department of Education

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.060
is thinking about Title IX.

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.770
And these things have the rule of law,

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:21.860
even though every detail
here has not been passed

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:23.150
through Congress.

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.510
Of course, Congress will have
forms of oversight over this

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.210
and the Supreme Court can
also deem certain rules

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:30.980
or regulations to be unconstitutional

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.811
if it thinks they are unconstitutional.

00:04:32.811 --> 00:04:35.480
Now another thing in this
clause right over here

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.330
that I just read, you might have noticed,

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.064
"satisfactory to the Assistant Secretary."

00:04:41.064 --> 00:04:44.152
So it's the Assistant
Secretary's discretion

00:04:44.152 --> 00:04:47.860
as to whether an institution
has met the requirements.

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.613
So once again, this shows
the discretionary authority

00:04:50.613 --> 00:04:52.700
of the bureaucracy.

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.977
So the big takeaway here is
it is the Legislative Branch

00:04:55.977 --> 00:04:58.820
that is responsible for passing laws,

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.330
and then you have the president
that would sign something

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.290
into law, but once it's a law,

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:05.230
but there's a lot of
details to be worked out

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:06.790
in terms of how it's implemented,

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:09.170
and that is the job of the bureaucracy.

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:12.990
And in order to do that, they
make rules and regulations,

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.810
and those rules and regulations
also have the force of law.

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.740
And top of that, there's
going to be opportunities

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.170
for them to exercise their discretion.
