00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:02.400
First, the problem.

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.640
Here's a simple website containing a
live stream of insightful gibberish from

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:06.890
multiple users.

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.120
It's a pattern you have seen on
multiple social networking sites.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.080
And we're calling it, Witter.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.070
Just in case lawyers are watching.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.080
I've added it to my home screen so it
looks like a native app I might get from

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.578
the Play Store, except it still
has all the benefits of the web.

00:00:20.578 --> 00:00:24.460
We call this a progressive app,
or we would if it weren't for

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.020
one little problem.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:31.280
If I open it when I don't have
an internet connection, I get this.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.980
This is a problem, but
not our biggest problem.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.450
This is.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.110
I call it Lie-Fi.

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.780
Let's enjoy the fruits of Lie-Fi for
a moment, shall we?

00:00:45.293 --> 00:00:50.424
This is it, just

00:00:50.424 --> 00:00:57.770
this forever and ever.

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.240
You're in connection limbo.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.890
You could just put your phone in your
pocket and get on with something else.

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.570
But you keep waiting because
it might suddenly load.

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.201
Maybe within the next five seconds.

00:01:12.852 --> 00:01:15.430
No, you should probably give up now.

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.580
But you know in your heart that
one second after you give up,

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.315
that would be the moment it would
have worked if only you'd waited.

00:01:24.315 --> 00:01:28.012
So you wait, and wait.

00:01:28.012 --> 00:01:32.000
This situation can be caused by a phone
barely holding on to a connection.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.550
But sometimes your phone thinks it's
acing it in the connection department,

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.280
but nothing is getting through.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.120
The problem is further down the line.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.300
Somewhere between you and the server,
where the app and data lives.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.850
There's a lot in between your phone and
the server.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.616
Your phone sends the request to
the Wi-Fi router or cell tower.

00:01:49.616 --> 00:01:53.870
Then onto the ISP, through
intermediate proxies and potentially,

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.080
across to the other side of the world.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.490
And eventually, the request
reaches the destination server.

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.990
But that's only half the journey,
because the server responds.

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.800
And that response needs to go all
the way back across the world through

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:12.140
proxies, through ISPs, over the air and
land safe and sound on your phone.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.430
But if something along the way, fails.

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:15.876
The whole thing fails.

00:02:15.876 --> 00:02:20.421
If something along the way run slowly,
then the whole thing run slow and

00:02:20.421 --> 00:02:21.955
there in lies lie-fi.

00:02:21.955 --> 00:02:25.846
Maybe you have bad signal or maybe you
have perfect signal but the router or

00:02:25.846 --> 00:02:28.440
tower you're connected to is overloaded.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.910
For example, a crowded stadium or

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.700
a train station that's just
been hit by major delays.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.890
Everyone's on their phone trying
to find another way home,

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.580
and the cell tower can't cope
when people need it most.

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.480
Or maybe there's a faulty or busy proxy.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.470
Maybe the destination server is busy or
has a bug.

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.300
Loads of stuff can go wrong and we can't
predict any of this ahead of time.

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.880
The only way to know if we can get
a response is to send a request and

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.920
see what happens.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.621
And that can take
a gruelingly long time and

00:02:58.621 --> 00:03:02.010
the worst thing we can leave
the user with is nothing.

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:04.200
Let's do better.
