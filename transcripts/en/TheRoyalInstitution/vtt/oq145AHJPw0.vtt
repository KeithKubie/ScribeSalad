00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.380
Dead on target.

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.849
Yes!

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.910
This is a simple toy cannon that's easy to
make.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.670
My boys have had loads of fun playing
with it. I'll explain how to make it

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.690
in a moment, but the thing I love about it

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.909
is the fact that it allows children to
explore energy,

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:07.159
forces, and motion all while making something.

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.450
You can fire different things out of it.
You can control how much

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.369
you pull the rubber bands back. You can
change the angle.

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:23.200
In other words you can explore projectile motion,

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.360
the way in which things fly through the air.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.619
To make one of these cannons, you need to start by cutting off the bottom

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:34.710
of one of these crisp tins. So we'll take
the scissors

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.810
and push them through.

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.880
You'll probably want to do this yourself
because it's a little tricky

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.600
We cut it right the way around.

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:52.929
Next you want to cut two slits

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:56.739
up close to the top first on one side,

00:01:56.739 --> 00:02:00.879
and then on the other. What these are
going to do

00:02:00.879 --> 00:02:05.160
is provide the attachment point
for your rubber bands.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.349
So here go two rubber bands: one on one
side,

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:15.729
and one on the other side like this.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.680
Then, with some masking tape you can secure

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.970
the rubber band in place and strengthen

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.250
the top of the can.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:32.200
So here we are, ready to go, and now tear that off.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.000
So the whole thing

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.860
is ready and in place. We can set that
aside

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.010
and now we're going to take a bottle.

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.450
Again we're going to use
scissors

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.860
to poke a little hole in the bottle like
that

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.019
and the same thing on the opposite side.

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:56.810
Again you want to be a little careful with
the scissors.

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.150
With that in place we're now going
to take a pencil

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.359
and push that through the
two holes.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.580
Force it through, and now our bottle is ready.

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:14.739
We can assemble the entire device by putting this plunger

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:18.159
in and securing it with

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:20.959
the two rubber bands.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:25.180
Our cannon is now made and ready to fire.

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.760
You can use any projectile you want and
I've got a variety of balls here.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.909
But of course if you're playing inside I
suggest you use

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:36.569
these scrunched up balls of tinfoil. You can drop them in

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:39.849
and using these you can actually
minimize the amount wreckage

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:40.620
that you're going to cause

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:43.149
in your house.

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.700
Okay let me try with this: whoops!

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.020
Oops, missed! Yay!

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.650
The cannon is a simple device to
transfer energy from one thing

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:58.300
 to another.

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:01.590
When I pull the bottle back, energy from
me

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.769
is stored in the rubber bands. When I
release the bottle

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:10.420
that energy is transferred into the
movement of the projectile,

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.409
in other words into kinetic energy.

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:17.889
Why don't we make a stack of stuff, where you have to try to knock everything down?

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:21.260
Simply asking a few questions while
you're doing this activity

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.620
might help you and your kids get a little
bit more out of it.

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.700
What do you think makes for the best catapult? 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.820
Maybe the one that goes furthest? 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.600
And one that goes highest?

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.960
But actually highest is really hard to measure...

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.440
So what is the tennis ball doing?

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.229
It's heavy, and it's just dropping.

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:50.639
So what does that mean, if it's really heavy? What happens? 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:54.130
It doesn't go high. It just goes up like that.

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.590
I like this activity because it's quite fun

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:03.020
and it's kind of cool when you have to go back and 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:06.870
remake your catapult and and make it better and better,

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:11.580
and see how it goes once you've done it.

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.580
I think they're easy to make,

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.639
they fire really well, and I think we should get them

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:20.779
into my school.
