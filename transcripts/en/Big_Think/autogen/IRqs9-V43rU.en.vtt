know so I'm not sure what the super

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649
know so I'm not sure what the super
 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.170
know so I'm not sure what the super
intelligent entity would be up to but to

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180
intelligent entity would be up to but to
 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.430
intelligent entity would be up to but to
give it to give you something to think

give it to give you something to think
 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.340
give it to give you something to think
about in contrast the reason you and I

that way there is not a super

that way there is not a super

and you and I are here because we're

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149
and you and I are here because we're
 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.380
and you and I are here because we're
good enough we are not super I don't

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390
good enough we are not super I don't
 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.149
good enough we are not super I don't
think doesn't seem to be there's no

evidence to support the idea that we

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720
evidence to support the idea that we
 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.359
evidence to support the idea that we
were designed by a super intelligent

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369
were designed by a super intelligent
 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:57.249
were designed by a super intelligent
designer

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259
designer
 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:01:59.929
designer
instead we're good enough to be here if

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939
instead we're good enough to be here if
 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.880
instead we're good enough to be here if
we weren't designed by a super

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890
we weren't designed by a super
 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.410
we weren't designed by a super
intelligent designer I mean wouldn't the

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420
intelligent designer I mean wouldn't the
 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.810
intelligent designer I mean wouldn't the
plumbing be a little different wouldn't

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820
plumbing be a little different wouldn't
 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:06.920
plumbing be a little different wouldn't
we have made some different choices

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930
we have made some different choices
 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:12.890
we have made some different choices
about things would we have six fingers

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900
about things would we have six fingers
 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.350
about things would we have six fingers
we have a bigger brain why would I

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360
we have a bigger brain why would I
 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.309
we have a bigger brain why would I
forget stuff why wouldn't I have super

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319
forget stuff why wouldn't I have super
 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:20.720
forget stuff why wouldn't I have super
eyesight why would why would I need

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730
eyesight why would why would I need
 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.050
eyesight why would why would I need
glasses later in life and so on so

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060
glasses later in life and so on so
 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.380
glasses later in life and so on so
that's a cool question but for me it it

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390
that's a cool question but for me it it
 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.009
that's a cool question but for me it it
fills me with reverence because because

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019
fills me with reverence because because
 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:34.399
fills me with reverence because because
you can ask it you and I are made of

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:34.409
you can ask it you and I are made of
 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:38.929
you can ask it you and I are made of
primordial Stardust we are somehow at

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:38.939
primordial Stardust we are somehow at
 

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:40.819
primordial Stardust we are somehow at
least one of the ways that the universe

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:40.829
least one of the ways that the universe
 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:41.929
least one of the ways that the universe
knows itself

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:41.939
knows itself
 

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:45.710
knows itself
that's a great question Matthew Garcias

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720
that's a great question Matthew Garcias
 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.349
that's a great question Matthew Garcias
carry on
