00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 in this capsule we see an example 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.839
 running the flu to the star 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.069
 step by step 

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:10.320
 then the example we will use is 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.750
 a simplified example we have to find the 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.150
 shortest way between two cities 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.070
 so in this case we have a very good example 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.119
 it's just six cities 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.820
 on our map 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:24.720
 we have a departure city and heroes 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:27.570
 our destination city your m6 la 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.869
 distance is where the blow is on the 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:34.230
 arcs var actually corresponds to the distance 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.450
 real between these cities there and notoriety 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.550
 we're going to use here it's going to be a 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.040
 distance as the crow flies on since it is 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.829
 not the graphics does not really say the 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.390
 true distance as the crow flies so in 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.070
 do you just have to do 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.110
 trust that it's rustic 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.930
 when she gives out it's beautiful and 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:55.590
 well the distance as the crow flies to other 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:59.579
 for example in this case the city n 0 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.859
 and the city m6 or in this case also the 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.220
 distance as the crow flies between the city 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:08.220
 m1 and the destination city so this 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.369
 would be ok so the figure I skip 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.369
 above do not match him ristic 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.799
 and the number associated with arcs 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:23.250
 corresponds to the actual distance between 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:24.840
 two adjacent cities so let's see 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.210
 step by step execution 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.610
 so what do you think I'm going 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.790
 give on each line it's actually the 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.189
 configuration of the variable open and 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.579
 of the closed variable at the beginning of each 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:42.290
 iteration of the loop in time to 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:45.390
 star specifically to be more 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.280
 accurate in open and enclosure what are we going 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.189
 to have it's not just 9th of May in 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.770
 more than one or state so here you have 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.320
 same things as we see also 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.049
 the value of f for this summer there so the 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.570
 fdn associated with the state and we will have 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:03.050
 also point to the parent who has 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.200
 generated as a child 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:10.250
 the nude in question ok so at the very beginning 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:13.970
 stars insert the initial name 1 0 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:17.060
 in open with additionally its value of f 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.700
 so the value of f here since the 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.110
 rustic is equal to 9 and then I have 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.660
 hate in that it would be zero 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.200
 since the distance between 0 and 1 0 and 2 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.920
 0 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.540
 the value of f maybe of neef then 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:34.280
 to point to the godfather but 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:36.230
 since no point release 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:40.400
 next what are we going to have done a 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:43.310
 iteration is to add the children of 1 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:48.170
 to 0 so the successors of 1.0 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:53.900
 then 3rd of n1 and noticed that in 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:56.240
 open here we will have put the draws in 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:00.650
 ascending order of the horror of f 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:05.390
 so for the nil n 1 actually his 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:08.390
 fc value the cost of these 30 from n 1 to 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:11.030
 know 3 plus the rustic which is two 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:14.420
 so 5 also 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.890
 so 5 that's right here actually the 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.870
 calculation for the other two for nde 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:23.050
 actually you are going to get 4 + 2 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:27.170
 so six reindeer husband 3-2 +5 so having 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:30.200
 after that we also put our 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:34.520
 we agree to treat the initial name 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:38.510
 in claude then of that we will take 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:41.420
 May 1 of the list at open cm1 so 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:44.180
 we are made to treat that here and then we 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:48.560
 will add her naked breasts line 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:50.750
 successor in open to know 25 and one 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.880
 go when we insert it in open on 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:56.420
 wants to insert it in the order of its value 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:04:01.370
 of f2m its value of f1 fota in this 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:04.430
 case 3 + 7 more so that's the 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.769
 value of jdm game dance regales to 10 plus 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.050
 logistics 2 so we should have a 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:10.970
 Nil to 12 for n 5 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:13.790
 if we finally introduce them 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:16.019
 inserting so as to maintain order one 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:19.289
 is going to have 25 and perfect last 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:21.750
 the open list and finally we will put 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:24.569
 it is not appropriate to treat namely 1 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:26.669
 will insert it in closer the clause of 

00:04:24.569 --> 00:04:27.770
 no need to keep in order 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:32.849
 growing f 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:35.069
 club interiors and we continue 

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:37.800
 we are now made to treat the 

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:41.849
 knot haendel so we must in that 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:43.919
 it's added his child who m 4 n 4 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:48.000
 is that they have justice there is 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:52.020
 associated a value of f which is 4 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.460
 more than +3 so the path that goes through 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.949
 haendel in what it's probably the 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:05:00.419
 generic in four it would be 4 + 2 so 

00:04:55.949 --> 00:05:02.509
 6 for j2m and three plus three for the 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:03.990
 ristic so new and inserting it 

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:07.490
 now the order 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:09.900
 it happens to be placed second 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:12.120
 then she will have to and added as 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:16.349
 usually the neutral and and add 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:18.030
 of next station pens we take the 

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:20.130
 first in open again which n 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:23.550
 3 and we generate his children because 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:25.080
 if we have two we've had two more 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:29.099
 times and a cape 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:32.610
 again so if we consider a 

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:36.930
 n 2 series then hard for the way 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:43.159
 which goes through m3 to actually have a cost of 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:45.569
 1 f so of the two plus a gift jdng of 

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:48.900
 haendel in this case for this way there 

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:51.509
 indulge in you + logistics dn2 to 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:55.729
 know two airlock had a total value 

00:05:51.509 --> 00:05:58.770
 of 5 and note that in close 

00:05:55.729 --> 00:06:00.120
 we had already m2 however its value of 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:01.680
 facts was greater 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:04.860
 so that's going to allow us to when 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:07.800
 even the agitated in opel ok otherwise we 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:14.159
 could not he then added two 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:15.930
 only other children cm 4 and 24 in this 

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:18.599
 case also for a path that goes through 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:23.789
 m3 the value of j2m case for this path 

00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:26.219
 there it would be + 1 and we will adjust its the 

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:28.950
 restic that would be 3 so would we have 

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:31.050
 would have a value of f that would be six 

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:33.090
 now notice that n 4 was already 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:35.130
 in open but again because 

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:38.070
 n 4 who was already in the country of avesnes 

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:39.960
 f value larger than the node 

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:41.850
 generated via another path the new 

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:46.500
 frame generim from our paths 

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:50.130
 in this case we will replace m49 ender 

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:52.920
 by m 4.6 m3 ok so we removed 

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:56.490
 a map and then we added instead 

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:59.970
 so we saw we removed this part 

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:05.130
 there here this tripled at the 24 and then we go 

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:06.810
 add that there instead and notice 

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:12.390
 also that we did the same thing 

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:15.330
 for m 2 it was removed from Klose on 

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:19.040
 no need to be there since we 

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:22.050
 has a triple duplicate partners in ok 

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:25.970
 I will remove lancre to do a little 

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:31.110
 of space by iterations next 

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:34.530
 so we have to add the child 

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:37.650
 of n2 in that so if only one 

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:39.720
 child who loves 4 when these in 

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:42.270
 this case the path that goes through 

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:47.030
 haendel and by m3 so it's like this 

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:49.950
 that since 1 2 by his parents 3 and n 4 

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:52.110
 by the way that wants am4 passed in this 

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:57.810
 case by m2 we have a way I have to 

00:07:52.110 --> 00:08:01.470
 hate associated with a plus-by-two + 1 + 2 

00:07:57.810 --> 00:08:05.300
 so 5 + logistics that is three this 

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:08.040
 who gives us eight sports n 4 is already 

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:10.290
 in open and the in this case 

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:11.430
 logistics predictions but the function 

00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:14.910
 of evaluations f 

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:18.210
 associated with number 4 that is already present 

00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:21.420
 in open in lower value so to 

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:25.320
 because of that we're not going to added m 4 nor 

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:28.740
 in open nor in close on 

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:33.090
 following alliterations and 4 will generate 

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:39.990
 his child who is m6 the path that has 

00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:42.080
 led to m4 pass him by m 3 years 84 so 

00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:47.240
 we act of n2 

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:49.280
 plus one adds to that now the 

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:52.190
 end of path level which is 4 us 

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:53.090
 that gives us the m6 gie who is going to be 

00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:55.490
 of 7 

00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:57.290
 we added on him ristic which is of zero 

00:08:55.490 --> 00:09:00.740
 since had destination logistic and 

00:08:57.290 --> 00:09:02.840
 to 0 and that gives us a value for m6 

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:05.150
 in their f1 based 

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:11.210
 of seven-year assessments the association 

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:16.250
 the parent who the generic and the more we have 

00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:20.470
 took a 4th we add it to claude after 

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:23.210
 have treated it next iteration 

00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:26.420
 well we see that it is not appropriate to 

00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:29.420
 go out who's the first of open donkey 

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:32.660
 clues lies to have one lies at 

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:36.620
 to be a shrapnel so golden if it would be 

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:39.170
 true hole and so we can stand out the 

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:42.890
 path that led to m6 going back to 

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:45.200
 from parents so m6 would have been 

00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:49.370
 reached from m 4 n 4 was 

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:52.490
 reached from n 3 and n 3 was 

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:57.710
 reached from 1 0 so it gives 

00:09:52.490 --> 00:10:00.740
 the path n 01 n3m cap and n 6 and that 

00:09:57.710 --> 00:10:03.490
 this is the solution will turn so part to 

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:03.490
 star 

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:11.360
 there are other algorithms of 

00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:12.949
 search there stay there is the algorithm 

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:14.899
 drop research that still makes 

00:10:12.949 --> 00:10:15.740
 much more general research 

00:10:14.899 --> 00:10:17.720
 heuristic 

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:19.220
 it's a variant everything is actually done 

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:21.350
 can take any form 

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:23.509
 we can say that to star is a 

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:25.970
 special case of best research 

00:10:23.509 --> 00:10:29.269
 but we dream of hate that breaks down 

00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:31.279
 in the sum of j2m and h2 helps young people 

00:10:29.269 --> 00:10:33.790
 it's the stroke to the bullring to buy 

00:10:31.279 --> 00:10:36.560
 a double blow of hand until the beginning 

00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:39.380
 our tourists hic for the moment 

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:40.910
 until the beginning we also have another 

00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:42.259
 variant which is the gray said drop 

00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:44.750
 research 

00:10:42.259 --> 00:10:46.639
 it is also a best research but 

00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:48.740
 who is voracious and to say that they are 

00:10:46.639 --> 00:10:49.399
 base for exploration only on 

00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:51.940
 the rustic 

00:10:49.399 --> 00:10:54.170
 so it misses the part if more gidel 

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:55.699
 in that if we are not guaranteed to 

00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:57.350
 find a path that is optimal 

00:10:55.699 --> 00:10:59.810
 unlike stars as we see 

00:10:57.350 --> 00:11:01.310
 when we talk about properties but 

00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:04.630
 it's an algorithm that sometimes work 

00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:04.630
 in practice 

00:11:05.079 --> 00:11:09.860
 so here's an example precisely or at 

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:13.690
 the star who would return a path 

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:15.949
 optimal and credit decline research 

00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:17.510
 gives different results 

00:11:15.949 --> 00:11:19.519
 so imagine we have a grid here where 

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:22.490
 each intersection corresponds to a 

00:11:19.519 --> 00:11:22.760
 it's rumors it would be a wall so 

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:25.819
 after 

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:28.699
 they wished to leave hesse and 

00:11:25.819 --> 00:11:31.610
 let's imagine we've got 

00:11:28.699 --> 00:11:34.060
 some roads where is so stopped 

00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:36.350
 between the draws they are blocked 

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:39.889
 well in that if we did a 

00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:41.420
 solution by willi betz spurs on the 

00:11:39.889 --> 00:11:44.000
 way that would be returned would be the 

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:45.199
 way here like that these paths light has 

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.569
 longer 

00:11:45.199 --> 00:11:49.730
 our path that the optimal path that 

00:11:47.569 --> 00:11:53.329
 would go under the bar 

00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:56.680
 like that and to etoy would return to him 

00:11:53.329 --> 00:11:56.680
 way there they do not have each other 

00:11:59.649 --> 00:12:04.389
 and finally if it tempts you to see 

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:07.300
 stars is that other algorithms 

00:12:04.389 --> 00:12:11.499
 from research into action you have a link 

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:13.839
 here for an online demo where you 

00:12:11.499 --> 00:12:15.160
 can do tests with the 

00:12:13.839 --> 00:12:17.050
 different algorithms for 

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:18.009
 labyrinths must go from one point to 

00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:20.019
 at a point b 

00:12:18.009 --> 00:12:25.139
 so I encourage you to go play 

00:12:20.019 --> 00:12:25.139
 with this demo there on the web
