00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.160
 I've never used cocaine, heroin or crystal meth because I get addicted to things very quickly 

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.440
 And I don't want to change into one of * these * people 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.600
 Hi! May I still have some drugs? 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:11.640
 Do you have money? 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.980
 Not really ... But I really like those drugs! 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.720
 No man, no money, no drugs 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.880
 That is just how the economy works 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.160
 Oh my God please! 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.140
 No! 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.120
 Very much please !? 

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:22.640
 No! 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.600
 Please please please !!! I really enjoyed those drugs! Please give me a little more drugs! 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.100
 Shut up! 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.180
 Alsjeblieeeeeeeeeffffffftttt! No! Please! No! Please! Shut up! PLEASE! 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.800
 NO! Fuck bitch! 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.240
 GIVE ME THE MOTHERFUCKING DRUGS YOU MOTHERFUCKING BUCKLE BEFORE I SHOOT YOU A MOTHERFUCKING BULLET THROUGH YOUR MOTHERFUCKING BRAIN 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.320
 But do you know what has always been my first choice for drugs? 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.720
 ~ Organize ~ 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.020
 Yes you are, you understood me well 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.980
 ~ Organize ~ 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.840
 I am certainly 100% addicted to ~ organizing ~ 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.820

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.560

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.680
 Sunday society ... * Check * 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.380
 * No idea what that chick is saying but it is probably not very relevant * 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.340
 HMHMHM HEU 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.100
 ...Oh no... 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.200
 THERE IS NIKS MORE TO ORGANIZE 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.200
 Oh no no no no ... there must be SOMETHING to organize! 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.700
 Just a little something! I just want to organize one more thing! Just one! Another one! 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.980
 I don't know exactly why, but I just really enjoyed it 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.260
 And I am not only very excited 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.420
 But ... Also a bit excited;) 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.420
 As a teenager I always went to Office Max 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:26.540
 And I almost finished when I looked at all rows of folders, color-coordinated folders and pens and the whiteboards with grilles on them that were arranged per month 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.360
 Hmmmmm yeahhh ... Mama likes that ... 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.660
 I know this video is pretty weird 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.940
 But I really enjoy organizing 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.300
 4 months ago I was organizing an event that would take place in April 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:39.140
 So next month 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.380
 And I made the mistake of organizing this much too late in the evening 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.340
 Because that meant I couldn't sleep anymore 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.480
 I was just so fucking excited 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.300
 OMG what goodies will I bring ?! 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:49.500
 Oh I'm going to bring meals every night! 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.520
 We really have to have a taco evening everyone loves tacos ... 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.980
 Oh yes but then I have to know everyone's diet in case someone eats gluten free or dairy free or something ... 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.920
 Ohhhh and carpooling! OHHH 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.720
 That will be so much fun! 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.280
 Will I allocate a room based on personality to everyone, or will I just let everyone choose for themselves? 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.100
 Omg there is so much to organize 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.360
 THAT MUCH 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.780
 Omg omg I have three months to make all these decisions! 

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.120
 And you? Do you have this too? 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.500
 Is this something that all type A people have? 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:20.120
 I just feel so satisfied when I have control over all these chaotic elements 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.060
 And to merge everything into one specific place and time 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.140
 I just feel like a God 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.840
 I'm Anna Akana, stay awesome Gotham 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
