example and there's two pieces of that
one<00:06:44.900><c> is</c><00:06:45.080><c> you</c><00:06:45.350><c> could</c><00:06:45.500><c> decrease</c><00:06:45.950><c> of</c><00:06:46.220><c> course</c><00:06:46.460><c> the</c>

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:46.760 align:start position:0%
one is you could decrease of course the
 

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:50.680 align:start position:0%
one is you could decrease of course the

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:50.690 align:start position:0%
wear and tear or you can increase the
 

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:52.870 align:start position:0%
wear and tear or you can increase the

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:52.880 align:start position:0%

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:54.430 align:start position:0%
repair so those are the two obvious
things<00:06:53.150><c> and</c><00:06:53.390><c> there</c><00:06:53.600><c> are</c><00:06:53.630><c> parameters</c><00:06:53.930><c> that</c>

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:54.440 align:start position:0%
things and there are parameters that
 

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:58.870 align:start position:0%
things and there are parameters that
determine<00:06:55.070><c> that</c><00:06:55.550><c> so</c><00:06:56.060><c> if</c><00:06:56.420><c> you</c><00:06:56.600><c> think</c><00:06:56.900><c> about</c><00:06:57.880><c> the</c>

00:06:58.870 --> 00:06:58.880 align:start position:0%
determine that so if you think about the
 

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:03.090 align:start position:0%
determine that so if you think about the
damage<00:06:59.480><c> that</c><00:06:59.810><c> is</c><00:07:00.110><c> occurring</c><00:07:00.500><c> from</c><00:07:01.000><c> metabolism</c>

so that means okay one way we could
 

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:12.670 align:start position:0%

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:12.680 align:start position:0%
there decrease damage is decrease the
 

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:16.060 align:start position:0%
there decrease damage is decrease the

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:19.140 align:start position:0%
