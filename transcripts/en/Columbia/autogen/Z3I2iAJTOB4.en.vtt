we're working on several in the last six
 

00:27:44.370 --> 00:27:45.950
we're working on several in the last six
years since our lab was developed I

00:27:45.950 --> 00:27:45.960
years since our lab was developed I
 

00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:47.240
years since our lab was developed I
think we've worked on over 30 different

00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:47.250
think we've worked on over 30 different
 

00:27:47.250 --> 00:27:49.280
think we've worked on over 30 different
projects and these are just the most

00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:49.290
projects and these are just the most
 

00:27:49.290 --> 00:27:52.520
projects and these are just the most
relevant so sensible cities work

00:30:50.650 --> 00:30:50.660
stay here the tags that we developed
 

00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:53.230
stay here the tags that we developed
were all monitored the level of toxins

00:30:53.230 --> 00:30:53.240
were all monitored the level of toxins
 

00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:55.720
were all monitored the level of toxins
in them was safe to be put into a

00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:55.730
in them was safe to be put into a
 

00:30:55.730 --> 00:30:57.610
in them was safe to be put into a
landfill or to be incinerated it was

00:30:57.610 --> 00:30:57.620
landfill or to be incinerated it was
 

00:30:57.620 --> 00:31:01.900
landfill or to be incinerated it was
below the US governmental regulations so

00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:01.910
below the US governmental regulations so
 

00:31:01.910 --> 00:31:03.760
below the US governmental regulations so
this is one of the first trash tags that

00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:03.770
this is one of the first trash tags that
 

00:31:03.770 --> 00:31:05.980
this is one of the first trash tags that
we developed it relied on gsm technology

00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:05.990
we developed it relied on gsm technology
 

00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:08.140
we developed it relied on gsm technology
it was able to communicate to the

00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:08.150
it was able to communicate to the
 

00:31:08.150 --> 00:31:10.419
it was able to communicate to the
nearest cell phone tower tower so we

00:31:10.419 --> 00:31:10.429
nearest cell phone tower tower so we
 

00:31:10.429 --> 00:31:12.340
nearest cell phone tower tower so we
could have sort of a rough estimate of

00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:12.350
could have sort of a rough estimate of
 

00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:16.960
could have sort of a rough estimate of
where it was located these are a series

00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:16.970
where it was located these are a series
 

00:31:16.970 --> 00:31:18.910
where it was located these are a series
of the tags we sealed them in plastic

00:31:18.910 --> 00:31:18.920
of the tags we sealed them in plastic
 

00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:22.840
of the tags we sealed them in plastic
and we number each one this project was

00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:22.850
and we number each one this project was
 

00:31:22.850 --> 00:31:24.970
and we number each one this project was
done in partnership with waste

00:31:24.970 --> 00:31:24.980
done in partnership with waste
 

00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:28.000
done in partnership with waste
management and eventually was done in

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:28.010
management and eventually was done in
 

00:31:28.010 --> 00:31:29.980
management and eventually was done in
partnership with qualcomm so you see the

00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:29.990
partnership with qualcomm so you see the
 

00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:31.630

phone it sends out text messages to us
 

00:31:37.910 --> 00:31:40.480
phone it sends out text messages to us
based on location so it can't make phone

00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:40.490
based on location so it can't make phone
 

00:31:40.490 --> 00:31:42.580
based on location so it can't make phone
calls but it can send us messages so we

00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:42.590
calls but it can send us messages so we
 

00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:44.350
calls but it can send us messages so we
know exactly where it is is at a given

00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:44.360

also partnered up with google so that

00:33:36.479 --> 00:33:36.489
also partnered up with google so that
 

00:33:36.489 --> 00:33:38.369
also partnered up with google so that
all the volunteers had an individual

00:33:38.369 --> 00:33:38.379
all the volunteers had an individual
 

00:33:38.379 --> 00:33:40.049
all the volunteers had an individual
number that they could go in and enter

00:33:40.049 --> 00:33:40.059
number that they could go in and enter
 

00:33:40.059 --> 00:33:42.089
number that they could go in and enter
online so they could follow their piece

00:33:42.089 --> 00:33:42.099
online so they could follow their piece
 

00:33:42.099 --> 00:33:44.549

ago I was at a conference and the

00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:17.490
ago I was at a conference and the
 

00:41:17.490 --> 00:41:18.650
ago I was at a conference and the
colleague of mine asked me if I was

00:41:18.650 --> 00:41:18.660
colleague of mine asked me if I was
 

00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:20.330
colleague of mine asked me if I was
going to be using PowerPoint i said no i

00:41:20.330 --> 00:41:20.340
going to be using PowerPoint i said no i
 

00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:23.540

different meanings of that one of them
 

00:41:27.540 --> 00:41:28.820
different meanings of that one of them
being that's going without power point

00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:28.830
being that's going without power point
 

00:41:28.830 --> 00:41:31.070

here as you can see in my little arrow
is that there are two sides there's this

is that there are two sides there's this
continuum here and there are a range of

governance simultaneously and what I'm
 

01:01:24.930 --> 01:01:26.989
governance simultaneously and what I'm
going to do you know in my work I look

01:01:26.989 --> 01:01:26.999
going to do you know in my work I look
 

01:01:26.999 --> 01:01:29.739
going to do you know in my work I look
at this in multiple types of

01:01:29.739 --> 01:01:29.749
at this in multiple types of
 

01:01:29.749 --> 01:01:33.019
at this in multiple types of
environmental issues but here today what

01:01:33.019 --> 01:01:33.029
environmental issues but here today what
 

01:01:33.029 --> 01:01:35.029
environmental issues but here today what
I'm going to do is provide two examples

01:01:35.029 --> 01:01:35.039
I'm going to do is provide two examples
 

01:01:35.039 --> 01:01:38.150
I'm going to do is provide two examples
that show that first of all there's a

01:01:38.150 --> 01:01:38.160
that show that first of all there's a
 

01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:39.949
that show that first of all there's a
diversity of ways that Marmol activism

01:01:39.949 --> 01:01:39.959
diversity of ways that Marmol activism
 

01:01:39.959 --> 01:01:42.380
diversity of ways that Marmol activism
takes place but second of all to show

01:01:42.380 --> 01:01:42.390
takes place but second of all to show
 

01:01:42.390 --> 01:01:44.029
takes place but second of all to show
that environmental activism even though

01:01:44.029 --> 01:01:44.039
that environmental activism even though
 

01:01:44.039 --> 01:01:45.739
that environmental activism even though
there are multiple scales at which it

there are multiple scales at which it
 

01:01:45.749 --> 01:01:48.079
there are multiple scales at which it
takes place it is extremely

01:01:48.079 --> 01:01:48.089
takes place it is extremely
 

01:01:48.089 --> 01:01:50.029
takes place it is extremely
geographically situated and i'll

01:01:50.029 --> 01:01:50.039
geographically situated and i'll
 

01:01:50.039 --> 01:01:52.039
geographically situated and i'll
hopefully prove that to today so i'm

01:01:52.039 --> 01:01:52.049
hopefully prove that to today so i'm
 

01:01:52.049 --> 01:01:53.689

wouldn't say are on the extreme points
 

01:01:58.079 --> 01:02:00.319
wouldn't say are on the extreme points
with regard to this arrow but definitely

01:02:00.319 --> 01:02:00.329
with regard to this arrow but definitely
 

01:02:00.329 --> 01:02:02.900
with regard to this arrow but definitely

01:05:30.220 --> 01:05:31.770
being honest here right okay one of the
other things that we've been doing with

01:05:31.770 --> 01:05:31.780
other things that we've been doing with
 

01:05:31.780 --> 01:05:33.450
other things that we've been doing with
this project and what these data are

01:05:33.450 --> 01:05:33.460
this project and what these data are
 

01:05:33.460 --> 01:05:35.850
this project and what these data are
looking at the connections among the

01:05:35.850 --> 01:05:35.860
looking at the connections among the
 

01:05:35.860 --> 01:05:37.500
looking at the connections among the
stewarts now I realize that this is

01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:37.510
stewarts now I realize that this is
 

01:05:37.510 --> 01:05:40.200
stewarts now I realize that this is
probably completely illegible but what I

01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:40.210
probably completely illegible but what I
 

01:05:40.210 --> 01:05:42.090
probably completely illegible but what I
wanted you to do is get a sense of the

01:05:42.090 --> 01:05:42.100
wanted you to do is get a sense of the
 

01:05:42.100 --> 01:05:44.220
wanted you to do is get a sense of the
map of the connections among this George

01:05:44.220 --> 01:05:44.230
map of the connections among this George
 

01:05:44.230 --> 01:05:46.620
map of the connections among this George
so we asked the group's how they connect

01:05:46.620 --> 01:05:46.630
so we asked the group's how they connect
 

01:05:46.630 --> 01:05:47.640
so we asked the group's how they connect
with one another and with whom they

01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:47.650
with one another and with whom they
 

01:05:47.650 --> 01:05:50.070
with one another and with whom they
connect and this is everybody all of the

01:05:50.070 --> 01:05:50.080
connect and this is everybody all of the
 

01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:51.360
connect and this is everybody all of the
civic groups and it doesn't talk about

01:05:51.360 --> 01:05:51.370
civic groups and it doesn't talk about
 

01:05:51.370 --> 01:05:53.360
civic groups and it doesn't talk about
how they connect with businesses or

01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:53.370
how they connect with businesses or
 

01:05:53.370 --> 01:05:55.890
how they connect with businesses or
government groups or government agencies

01:05:55.890 --> 01:05:55.900
government groups or government agencies
 

01:05:55.900 --> 01:05:58.920
government groups or government agencies
but we do have that as well and here's

01:05:58.920 --> 01:05:58.930
but we do have that as well and here's
 

01:05:58.930 --> 01:06:00.440
but we do have that as well and here's
what I want you to take away from this

01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:00.450
what I want you to take away from this
 

01:06:00.450 --> 01:06:03.060
what I want you to take away from this
very hard to read map the first thing is

01:06:03.060 --> 01:06:03.070
very hard to read map the first thing is
 

01:06:03.070 --> 01:06:05.280
very hard to read map the first thing is
that there's a big collection and claw

01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:05.290
that there's a big collection and claw
 

01:06:05.290 --> 01:06:06.900
that there's a big collection and claw
maury shin of ISIL it's in the middle

01:06:06.900 --> 01:06:06.910
maury shin of ISIL it's in the middle
 

01:06:06.910 --> 01:06:08.190
maury shin of ISIL it's in the middle
groups that really aren't connected too

01:06:08.190 --> 01:06:08.200
groups that really aren't connected too
 

01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:10.830
groups that really aren't connected too
much at all and they're relatively

01:06:10.830 --> 01:06:10.840
much at all and they're relatively
 

01:06:10.840 --> 01:06:12.840
much at all and they're relatively
disconnected and they tend to be rather

01:06:12.840 --> 01:06:12.850
disconnected and they tend to be rather
 

01:06:12.850 --> 01:06:15.450
disconnected and they tend to be rather
tend to be the smaller groups and then

01:06:15.450 --> 01:06:15.460
tend to be the smaller groups and then
 

01:06:15.460 --> 01:06:17.520
tend to be the smaller groups and then
on the outside we have the ring of

01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:17.530
on the outside we have the ring of
 

01:06:17.530 --> 01:06:20.400
on the outside we have the ring of
connected groups and the size here

01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:20.410
connected groups and the size here
 

01:06:20.410 --> 01:06:21.780
connected groups and the size here
represents the number of groups I

01:06:21.780 --> 01:06:21.790
represents the number of groups I
 

01:06:21.790 --> 01:06:23.580
represents the number of groups I
mentioned them right so we have probably

01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:23.590
mentioned them right so we have probably
 

01:06:23.590 --> 01:06:31.460
mentioned them right so we have probably
the most popular here

01:06:31.460 --> 01:06:31.470
 

01:06:31.470 --> 01:06:33.660
so you get a sense and one of the things

01:06:33.660 --> 01:06:33.670
so you get a sense and one of the things
 

01:06:33.670 --> 01:06:35.160
so you get a sense and one of the things
that's interesting and if I had more

01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:35.170
that's interesting and if I had more
 

01:06:35.170 --> 01:06:36.840
that's interesting and if I had more
time to talk I tell you about this is

01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:36.850
time to talk I tell you about this is
 

01:06:36.850 --> 01:06:39.600
time to talk I tell you about this is
that the groups tend to UM along

01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:39.610
that the groups tend to UM along
 

01:06:39.610 --> 01:06:41.100
that the groups tend to UM along
together with groups that focus on the

01:06:41.100 --> 01:06:41.110
together with groups that focus on the
 

01:06:41.110 --> 01:06:42.450
together with groups that focus on the
same types of environmental issues right

01:06:42.450 --> 01:06:42.460
same types of environmental issues right
 

01:06:42.460 --> 01:06:43.830
same types of environmental issues right
so the water groups are with the water

01:06:43.830 --> 01:06:43.840
so the water groups are with the water
 

01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:45.900
so the water groups are with the water
groups and the land groups tend to be

01:06:45.900 --> 01:06:45.910
groups and the land groups tend to be
 

01:06:45.910 --> 01:06:47.640
groups and the land groups tend to be
connected to the land groups and we're

01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:47.650
connected to the land groups and we're
 

01:06:47.650 --> 01:06:49.770
connected to the land groups and we're
digging much more into these data now so

01:06:49.770 --> 01:06:49.780
digging much more into these data now so
 

01:06:49.780 --> 01:06:51.240
digging much more into these data now so
that's what I can tell you at this point

01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:51.250
that's what I can tell you at this point
 

01:06:51.250 --> 01:06:53.850
that's what I can tell you at this point
but stay tuned if you're interested so

01:06:53.850 --> 01:06:53.860
but stay tuned if you're interested so
 

01:06:53.860 --> 01:06:55.080
but stay tuned if you're interested so
we're currently looking into the

01:06:55.080 --> 01:06:55.090
we're currently looking into the
 

01:06:55.090 --> 01:06:56.640
we're currently looking into the
characteristics of the network broadly

01:06:56.640 --> 01:06:56.650
characteristics of the network broadly
 

01:06:56.650 --> 01:06:58.260
characteristics of the network broadly
as well as the hybrid arrangements which

01:06:58.260 --> 01:06:58.270
as well as the hybrid arrangements which
 

01:06:58.270 --> 01:06:59.730
as well as the hybrid arrangements which
I'm very interested in terms of how the

01:06:59.730 --> 01:06:59.740
I'm very interested in terms of how the
 

01:06:59.740 --> 01:07:01.050
I'm very interested in terms of how the
groups are working with businesses as

01:07:01.050 --> 01:07:01.060
groups are working with businesses as
 

01:07:01.060 --> 01:07:03.690
groups are working with businesses as
well as government actors and then we're

01:07:03.690 --> 01:07:03.700
well as government actors and then we're
 

01:07:03.700 --> 01:07:05.670
well as government actors and then we're
also doing an organizational history of

01:07:05.670 --> 01:07:05.680
also doing an organizational history of
 

01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:07.230
also doing an organizational history of
the nodes and that's part of the work

01:07:07.230 --> 01:07:07.240
the nodes and that's part of the work
 

01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:09.990
the nodes and that's part of the work
that I'm doing with the the ultra X

01:07:09.990 --> 01:07:10.000
that I'm doing with the the ultra X
 

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:11.340
that I'm doing with the the ultra X
project that I leave here in New York

01:07:11.340 --> 01:07:11.350
project that I leave here in New York
 

01:07:11.350 --> 01:07:14.490
project that I leave here in New York
City so that gives you a little sense of

01:07:14.490 --> 01:07:14.500
City so that gives you a little sense of
 

01:07:14.500 --> 01:07:17.600
City so that gives you a little sense of
what's going on here in New York City

01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:17.610
what's going on here in New York City
 

01:07:17.610 --> 01:07:20.400
what's going on here in New York City
here's a very very different case but

01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:20.410
here's a very very different case but
 

01:07:20.410 --> 01:07:22.080
here's a very very different case but
I'm going to argue is certainly

01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:22.090
I'm going to argue is certainly
 

01:07:22.090 --> 01:07:23.970
I'm going to argue is certainly
geographically situated this is the case

01:07:23.970 --> 01:07:23.980
geographically situated this is the case
 

01:07:23.980 --> 01:07:26.610
geographically situated this is the case
of the climate movement now the climate

01:07:26.610 --> 01:07:26.620
of the climate movement now the climate
 

01:07:26.620 --> 01:07:27.750
of the climate movement now the climate
movement can be discussed in all

01:07:27.750 --> 01:07:27.760
movement can be discussed in all
 

01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:29.970
movement can be discussed in all
different ways is the global movement is

01:07:29.970 --> 01:07:29.980
different ways is the global movement is
 

01:07:29.980 --> 01:07:31.860
different ways is the global movement is
connected between transnational actors

01:07:31.860 --> 01:07:31.870
connected between transnational actors
 

01:07:31.870 --> 01:07:33.690
connected between transnational actors
some would argue actually that the

01:07:33.690 --> 01:07:33.700
some would argue actually that the
 

01:07:33.700 --> 01:07:34.980
some would argue actually that the
groups that you were talking about these

01:07:34.980 --> 01:07:34.990
groups that you were talking about these
 

01:07:34.990 --> 01:07:37.170
groups that you were talking about these
municipal municipalities are actually

01:07:37.170 --> 01:07:37.180
municipal municipalities are actually
 

01:07:37.180 --> 01:07:38.790
municipal municipalities are actually
part of the climate movement but we'll

01:07:38.790 --> 01:07:38.800
part of the climate movement but we'll
 

01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:40.470
part of the climate movement but we'll
just put them aside for now and just say

01:07:40.470 --> 01:07:40.480
just put them aside for now and just say
 

01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:42.510
just put them aside for now and just say
that I'm talking about the actors who

01:07:42.510 --> 01:07:42.520
that I'm talking about the actors who
 

01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:45.090
that I'm talking about the actors who
were involved specifically in climate

01:07:45.090 --> 01:07:45.100
were involved specifically in climate
 

01:07:45.100 --> 01:07:46.890
were involved specifically in climate
activists I'm around the climate

01:07:46.890 --> 01:07:46.900
activists I'm around the climate
 

01:07:46.900 --> 01:07:48.960
activists I'm around the climate
negotiations in Copenhagen in december

01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:48.970
negotiations in Copenhagen in december
 

01:07:48.970 --> 01:07:50.070
negotiations in Copenhagen in december
two thousand nine that was during the

01:07:50.070 --> 01:07:50.080
two thousand nine that was during the
 

01:07:50.080 --> 01:07:54.300
two thousand nine that was during the
the cop15 negotiations and here are some

01:07:54.300 --> 01:07:54.310
the cop15 negotiations and here are some
 

01:07:54.310 --> 01:07:56.100
the cop15 negotiations and here are some
pictures some of which i took the blurry

01:07:56.100 --> 01:07:56.110
pictures some of which i took the blurry
 

01:07:56.110 --> 01:07:58.230
pictures some of which i took the blurry
ones and some which i didn't take like

01:07:58.230 --> 01:07:58.240
ones and some which i didn't take like
 

01:07:58.240 --> 01:08:00.150
ones and some which i didn't take like
this one I wasn't that close to the guy

01:08:00.150 --> 01:08:00.160
this one I wasn't that close to the guy
 

01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:02.460
this one I wasn't that close to the guy
beating up the protester and what I

01:08:02.460 --> 01:08:02.470
beating up the protester and what I
 

01:08:02.470 --> 01:08:04.050
beating up the protester and what I
think is very important to note here is

01:08:04.050 --> 01:08:04.060
think is very important to note here is
 

01:08:04.060 --> 01:08:05.820
think is very important to note here is
that there were many different ways of

01:08:05.820 --> 01:08:05.830
that there were many different ways of
 

01:08:05.830 --> 01:08:07.620
that there were many different ways of
doing activism in Copenhagen okay we've

01:08:07.620 --> 01:08:07.630
doing activism in Copenhagen okay we've
 

01:08:07.630 --> 01:08:10.170
doing activism in Copenhagen okay we've
got outside the negotiations and outside

01:08:10.170 --> 01:08:10.180
got outside the negotiations and outside
 

01:08:10.180 --> 01:08:11.970
got outside the negotiations and outside
the negotiations involved marching this

01:08:11.970 --> 01:08:11.980
the negotiations involved marching this
 

01:08:11.980 --> 01:08:14.130
the negotiations involved marching this
is the huge March it involve 80,000

01:08:14.130 --> 01:08:14.140
is the huge March it involve 80,000
 

01:08:14.140 --> 01:08:16.860
is the huge March it involve 80,000
people it also involved a lot of billy

01:08:16.860 --> 01:08:16.870
people it also involved a lot of billy
 

01:08:16.870 --> 01:08:18.740
people it also involved a lot of billy
clubs and a little bit of teargas and

01:08:18.740 --> 01:08:18.750
clubs and a little bit of teargas and
 

01:08:18.750 --> 01:08:21.180
clubs and a little bit of teargas and
then there was an activism taking place

01:08:21.180 --> 01:08:21.190
then there was an activism taking place
 

01:08:21.190 --> 01:08:22.830
then there was an activism taking place
inside the negotiations and that's where

01:08:22.830 --> 01:08:22.840
inside the negotiations and that's where
 

01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:24.570
inside the negotiations and that's where
there were a lot of NGO observers and

01:08:24.570 --> 01:08:24.580
there were a lot of NGO observers and
 

01:08:24.580 --> 01:08:26.790
there were a lot of NGO observers and
researchers presenting their work trying

01:08:26.790 --> 01:08:26.800
researchers presenting their work trying
 

01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:28.440
researchers presenting their work trying
to speak to the regime more broadly and

01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:28.450
to speak to the regime more broadly and
 

01:08:28.450 --> 01:08:29.910
to speak to the regime more broadly and

anybody at any any of us who have
actually been the climate negotiations

01:08:33.060 --> 01:08:33.070
actually been the climate negotiations
 

01:08:33.070 --> 01:08:34.710
actually been the climate negotiations

from and i'm just starting to play with
 

01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:30.300
from and i'm just starting to play with
these data now so this is probably the

01:10:30.300 --> 01:10:30.310
these data now so this is probably the
 

01:10:30.310 --> 01:10:31.500
these data now so this is probably the
best i was able to show you here but

01:10:31.500 --> 01:10:31.510
best i was able to show you here but
 

01:10:31.510 --> 01:10:32.790
best i was able to show you here but

01:23:13.780 --> 01:23:16.859
and and and this is something that we
are very much concerned about as far as

01:23:16.859 --> 01:23:16.869
are very much concerned about as far as
 

01:23:16.869 --> 01:23:19.669
are very much concerned about as far as
India goes and how we will turn out

01:23:19.669 --> 01:23:19.679
India goes and how we will turn out
 

01:23:19.679 --> 01:23:22.789
India goes and how we will turn out
essentially what we're seeing is that

01:23:22.789 --> 01:23:22.799
essentially what we're seeing is that
 

01:23:22.799 --> 01:23:26.429
essentially what we're seeing is that
regardless of what the government

right which we live here in the United
 

01:23:57.459 --> 01:24:00.029
right which we live here in the United
States but in fact this is exactly the

01:24:00.029 --> 01:24:00.039
States but in fact this is exactly the
 

01:24:00.039 --> 01:24:02.009
States but in fact this is exactly the
lifestyle that has led us to this

01:24:02.009 --> 01:24:02.019
lifestyle that has led us to this
 

01:24:02.019 --> 01:24:03.629
lifestyle that has led us to this
climate crisis and this is this

01:24:03.629 --> 01:24:03.639
climate crisis and this is this
 

01:24:03.639 --> 01:24:05.939
climate crisis and this is this
lifestyle that is based primarily on

01:24:05.939 --> 01:24:05.949
lifestyle that is based primarily on

chain is very many times unsustainable

01:24:13.979 --> 01:24:13.989
chain is very many times unsustainable
 

01:24:13.989 --> 01:24:17.429
chain is very many times unsustainable
and so it has led us to this point today

01:24:17.429 --> 01:24:17.439
and so it has led us to this point today
 

01:24:17.439 --> 01:24:19.589
and so it has led us to this point today

and what's going to end up happening is
 

01:25:32.500 --> 01:25:34.020
and what's going to end up happening is
we're going to start looking more and

these kinds of things all across the
country i think if some if there is

01:25:48.480 --> 01:25:48.490
country i think if some if there is
 

01:25:48.490 --> 01:25:49.980
country i think if some if there is
anything the united states has taught us

01:25:49.980 --> 01:25:49.990
anything the united states has taught us
 

01:25:49.990 --> 01:25:53.370
anything the united states has taught us
it ND and europe is which is the path

01:25:53.370 --> 01:25:53.380
it ND and europe is which is the path
 

01:25:53.380 --> 01:25:56.040

not to go towards okay and that is
 

01:25:56.050 --> 01:25:58.740
not to go towards okay and that is
something that we need to learn from so

01:25:58.740 --> 01:25:58.750
something that we need to learn from so
 

01:25:58.750 --> 01:26:01.260
something that we need to learn from so
that was a long context but i do want to

01:26:01.260 --> 01:26:01.270
that was a long context but i do want to
 

01:26:01.270 --> 01:26:03.360
that was a long context but i do want to
talk about what we're doing with the

01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:03.370
talk about what we're doing with the
 

01:26:03.370 --> 01:26:04.950
talk about what we're doing with the
kogala company because i think it's very

01:26:04.950 --> 01:26:04.960
kogala company because i think it's very
 

01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:07.440
kogala company because i think it's very
illustrative of sort of where we're at

01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:07.450
illustrative of sort of where we're at
 

01:26:07.450 --> 01:26:10.800
illustrative of sort of where we're at
and where we're headed and and why it's

01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:10.810
and where we're headed and and why it's
 

01:26:10.810 --> 01:26:13.350
and where we're headed and and why it's
rather disastrous the coca-cola company

01:26:13.350 --> 01:26:13.360
rather disastrous the coca-cola company
 

01:26:13.360 --> 01:26:16.500
rather disastrous the coca-cola company

01:26:16.500 --> 01:26:16.510
as you know you know produces all their
 

01:26:16.510 --> 01:26:18.450
as you know you know produces all their
products whether it's coca-cola itself

and they actually came to india in 1991
 

01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:33.570
and they actually came to india in 1991
so relatively a new entry as far as you

01:26:33.570 --> 01:26:33.580
so relatively a new entry as far as you
 

01:26:33.580 --> 01:26:34.950
so relatively a new entry as far as you
know the world goes because most

01:26:34.950 --> 01:26:34.960
know the world goes because most
 

01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:38.580
know the world goes because most
countries by 1991 had coca-cola but

01:26:38.580 --> 01:26:38.590
countries by 1991 had coca-cola but
 

01:26:38.590 --> 01:26:40.980
countries by 1991 had coca-cola but
india did not and when they came in well

01:26:40.980 --> 01:26:40.990
india did not and when they came in well
 

01:26:40.990 --> 01:26:43.140
india did not and when they came in well
mean what did coca-cola do you know they

01:26:43.140 --> 01:26:43.150
mean what did coca-cola do you know they
 

01:26:43.150 --> 01:26:45.300
mean what did coca-cola do you know they
obviously looked around for places where

01:26:45.300 --> 01:26:45.310
obviously looked around for places where
 

01:26:45.310 --> 01:26:47.940
obviously looked around for places where
they could manufacture their products in

01:26:47.940 --> 01:26:47.950
they could manufacture their products in
 

01:26:47.950 --> 01:26:49.320
they could manufacture their products in
india and they weren't about it two

01:26:49.320 --> 01:26:49.330
india and they weren't about it two
 

01:26:49.330 --> 01:26:51.120
india and they weren't about it two
different ways and this is typical of

01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:51.130
different ways and this is typical of
 

01:26:51.130 --> 01:26:53.310
different ways and this is typical of
coca-cola the first strategy that

01:26:53.310 --> 01:26:53.320
coca-cola the first strategy that
 

01:26:53.320 --> 01:26:55.380
coca-cola the first strategy that
coca-cola used and he uses all over the

01:26:55.380 --> 01:26:55.390

groundwater so this is the story of

01:33:40.350 --> 01:33:40.360
groundwater so this is the story of
 

01:33:40.360 --> 01:33:42.780
groundwater so this is the story of
coca-cola in India and and you know one

01:33:42.780 --> 01:33:42.790
coca-cola in India and and you know one
 

01:33:42.790 --> 01:33:44.790
coca-cola in India and and you know one
is that they are depriving a lot of

01:33:44.790 --> 01:33:44.800
is that they are depriving a lot of
 

01:33:44.800 --> 01:33:46.320
is that they are depriving a lot of
people and I know we're talking about

01:33:46.320 --> 01:33:46.330
people and I know we're talking about
 

01:33:46.330 --> 01:33:48.689
people and I know we're talking about
India some of the villages that we work

01:33:48.689 --> 01:33:48.699
India some of the villages that we work
 

01:33:48.699 --> 01:33:50.580
India some of the villages that we work
with where we have active campaigns

01:33:50.580 --> 01:33:50.590
with where we have active campaigns
 

01:33:50.590 --> 01:33:53.100
with where we have active campaigns
against coca-cola the population of this

01:33:53.100 --> 01:33:53.110
against coca-cola the population of this
 

01:33:53.110 --> 01:33:55.170
against coca-cola the population of this
village for example in Rajasthan is

01:33:55.170 --> 01:33:55.180
village for example in Rajasthan is
 

01:33:55.180 --> 01:33:57.689
village for example in Rajasthan is
10,000 people okay in the United States

01:33:57.689 --> 01:33:57.699
10,000 people okay in the United States
 

01:33:57.699 --> 01:34:00.390
10,000 people okay in the United States
to the via town or errors you know but

01:34:00.390 --> 01:34:00.400
to the via town or errors you know but
 

01:34:00.400 --> 01:34:02.750
to the via town or errors you know but
in India it still remains a village

01:34:02.750 --> 01:34:02.760
in India it still remains a village
 

01:34:02.760 --> 01:34:05.729
in India it still remains a village
because of the characteristic of this

01:34:05.729 --> 01:34:05.739
because of the characteristic of this
 

01:34:05.739 --> 01:34:07.890
because of the characteristic of this
area which is largely still very

01:34:07.890 --> 01:34:07.900
area which is largely still very
 

01:34:07.900 --> 01:34:10.890
area which is largely still very
agrarian and so when we look at the

01:34:10.890 --> 01:34:10.900
agrarian and so when we look at the
 

01:34:10.900 --> 01:34:11.660
agrarian and so when we look at the
impacts

01:34:11.660 --> 01:34:11.670
impacts
 

01:34:11.670 --> 01:34:13.310
impacts
when we looked at the tallied of the

01:34:13.310 --> 01:34:13.320
when we looked at the tallied of the
 

01:34:13.320 --> 01:34:15.020
when we looked at the tallied of the
impacts it was dramatic I mean we're

01:34:15.020 --> 01:34:15.030
impacts it was dramatic I mean we're
 

01:34:15.030 --> 01:34:17.360
