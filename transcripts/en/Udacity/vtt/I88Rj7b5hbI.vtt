00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.500
Okay, Michael, so here's a quiz. Now it's a

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.270
pretty straightforward quiz. I just want you to use everything

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.350
that you've learned so far. Okay, so you have

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:11.420
three hypotheses. Let's call them h1, h2, and h3, okay?

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:11.480
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:17.980
&gt;&gt; For the sake of argument. Here's what each of these hypotheses Outputs

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:23.340
for some particular x. h1 says plus. h2 says minus. h3 says minus. Okay?

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.193
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:24.193 --> 00:00:24.990
&gt;&gt; Now here we've,

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.650
already made it easy for you and we've

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.880
computed the probability of, a particular hypothesis given some

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.660
set of data. I'm not showing you the data

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.870
but I'm showing you the answer for it. Okay?

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.436
So the probability of h1 given the data is 0.4, h2 is 0.3, and h3 is 0.3.

00:00:39.436 --> 00:00:41.550
Got it? Wait hang on, so, okay, I see

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.160
that corresponds here about this given data, what's x?

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.290
&gt;&gt; x is some input, it doesn't matter,

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:47.520
just like it doesn't matter what the date is.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.830
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] 'Kay.

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:50.300
&gt;&gt; Just

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.880
call it so that, that, x is x, okay? It's just some

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.740
object out in the world and each hypothesis labels it. Plus or minus.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.020
&gt;&gt; 'Kay.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.570
&gt;&gt; Or can label it plus or minus. And H1 decides if for

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.570
that X, it's positive, and the other two hypotheses decide that it is,

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.380
in fact, negative and H1 has probability that is the maximum a posterior

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.520
probability h1 is .4, h2 is .3 and h3 is .3. So my question

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.010
is, very simple. Using all of the magic we've done, this is just to make sure

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.440
you've got it, Michael, I dunno, we've done

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.230
a lot of derivations, we've walked away from some

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.800
things [LAUGH] we gotta make sure we get back to basics here. What is the best

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:32.300
label for x? Is it plus, or is it minus? I see why this is tricky. Okay.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.560
&gt;&gt; And go.
