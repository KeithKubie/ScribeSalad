00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.560
Well, I can't talk about this movie unless I show this clip.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.100
"Faster, Bambi!"

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.700
[gunshot]

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.120
There's really no point in hiding it; we all know what happens to Bambi's mom in this movie.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.600
And that messed up so many kids for life.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.420
But is that the only reason to enjoy "Bambi"? The answer is, obviously no.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:31.600
Not only is the art in this movie just fantastic--I mean, good god, you just feel like you're in nature throughout this entire film--

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.800
but it's the first time Disney's ever done a coming-to-age story.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.300
And it does it very well.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:43.520
Where Disney's always been good at creating villains and threatening obstacles to go up against, they knew to keep that to a minimum in this movie.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.000
The villain is man, and you never see him.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.200
But just the mere threat of him is enough to be intimidating.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.400
Everybody talks about the mother's death, but some of these other scenes can get pretty damn intense.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:59.000
"We better fly!"
-"No. No, don't fly."
-"Whatever you do, don't fly!"

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.300
-"He's almost here. I can't stand it any longer!"

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.480
[gunshot]

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.080
[another gunshot]

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.760
Like most of the early Disney films, it mixes bright and colorful with dark and--
[gunshot]

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.360
--mommy-killing.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:22.540
But let's be honest, it's not the death of the mother that gets us; it's the fact that there was such a strong connection between her and the son.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.540
That's why it messes us up.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.640
And I also like the fact that the father is almost never around, and when he is, Bambi is almost afraid of him.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:40.480
Sort of a fascinating, dysfunctional family that may or may not need to be, but again, that's sort of up for debate, and that's one of the reasons I do like this film so much.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.180
The answers are not clear-cut--hell, even the questions aren't clear-cut.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:52.340
It's just the life of this deer, and all those typical children's cliches you see in other films--oh hell, you see in other adult films for that matter--

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.680
are not here. And thank god, because you know what? This is enough.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.200
Sometimes, just showing someone or something live their life is all you need.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.860
Life is interesting, life has problems. Life doesn't always resolve itself in a clever and poetic way.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.820
Life doesn't always have heroes. Life doesn't always have villains.

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:15.180
So because of that, as you'd imagine, there's less of an emphasis on story and more on character.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.920
And while Bambi is not the most fascinating of characters, he's supposed to be sort of the everyguy.

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:26.740
He's the blank slate that's supposed to absorb love, fear, sadness, happiness, and whatever other emotions you can connect with.

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.500
I'd be lying if I said I watched this one a lot.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.540
In fact, it's probably one of the Disney films I watch the least, though I do own it.

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.300
But I definitely respect it more than I do view it.

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:42.920
I guess there's only so many cutesy-wootsy scenes I could sit through, but they are done well, and with purpose.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.840
The second half is actually where I start to get more interested.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.540
I mean, you know, after--
-[gunshot]
- --that scene.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.040
I like seeing Bambi grow up, I like seeing what he's become.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.260
And I like seeing what he's going to make of himself.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:01.580
It's another one of those films where the lack of really complex characters is made up for in how much complexity they put into the backgrounds and the colors.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.280
Half the time, the sceneries give you the emotions.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.620
I like a film that can do that without cheating on the character, necessarily.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.460
The emotions are there in the character; they're just emphasized by the surroundings.

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.840
And "Bambi is chock-full of that: heavy atmosphere and a heavy environment.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.140
It's easily one of Disney's finest.
