and why you don't like them there's
 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.030

something seductive about the idea of
 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.220
something seductive about the idea of

one age or they ran off and joined gangs
 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.770
one age or they ran off and joined gangs
so they ran off and did things that

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780
so they ran off and did things that
 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.200

later in life didn't seem very smart but
there was this seductive idea of

adventure and so those things wrapped
 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.530
adventure and so those things wrapped
together and suddenly give it this power

it should not have I think what we need
to understand is because it's this loose

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730
to understand is because it's this loose
 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.540
to understand is because it's this loose
set of franchises and it's not an

by the the things they can see in touch
in fact they've created the idea that

in fact they've created the idea that
 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.940
in fact they've created the idea that
it's an idea and it's an idea that is

Isis and they Boko Haram stamps

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300
Isis and they Boko Haram stamps
 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.740
Isis and they Boko Haram stamps
themselves we're Isis now and they may

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750
themselves we're Isis now and they may
 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.740
themselves we're Isis now and they may
not do anything directly with anyone in

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750
not do anything directly with anyone in
 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.810
not do anything directly with anyone in
Syria or any of the former al Qaeda

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820
Syria or any of the former al Qaeda
 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.690
Syria or any of the former al Qaeda
leadership but now they've adopted the

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700
leadership but now they've adopted the
 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.120
leadership but now they've adopted the
t-shirt and the brand and it gives this

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130
t-shirt and the brand and it gives this
 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.830
t-shirt and the brand and it gives this
sense that they have a new level of

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840
sense that they have a new level of
 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.450
