00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.692
You're so close to being done. Now we come up with our three intervals for which

00:00:04.692 --> 00:00:09.023
we need to test a value to figure out what the solution set for x is. So test

00:00:09.023 --> 00:00:13.496
values from within each of these intervals and then write what you think the

00:00:13.496 --> 00:00:17.200
solution for x is as an inequality and then also as an interval.
