00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:11.240
Why is a Typical Work Day is 8 Hours Long?

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.059
During the Industrial Revolution, companies
attempted to maximize the output of their

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:20.980
factories by keeping them running as many
hours as possible, typically implementing

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.570
a “sun up to sun down” work day.

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.919
Wages were also extremely low, so workers
themselves often needed to work these long

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:34.410
shifts just to get by, including often sending
their children to work in the factories as

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.859
well, rather than getting them educated.

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:41.550
With little representation, education, or
options, factory workers also tended to work

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.590
in horrible working conditions to go along
with the bad hours.

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:51.970
The typical work day at this time lasted anywhere
from 10-18 hours per day, six days a week.

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.670
This all began to change in the 19th century.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.079
The first to suggest an eight hour work day
for everyone was a British man by the name

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:03.149
of Robert Owen, who was also one of the founders
of socialism.

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.340
Owen felt that the work day should be divided
into thirds, with workers getting equal time

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.160
to themselves and to sleep as they do for
work.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:16.810
Thus, in 1817, he began campaigning for an
eight hour working day for all workers, coining

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.430
the phrase, “Eight hours labour, eight hours
recreation, eight hours rest.”

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:26.550
Unfortunately, this did not catch on for some
time, though throughout the 19th century a

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:32.329
series of Factories Acts were passed that
steadily improved working conditions and reduced

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:34.649
work hours for factory workers.

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:40.009
For instance, The Factories Act of 1847 stipulated
that women and children were to be granted

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:44.390
a ten hour work day, thus only having to work
60 hours per week.

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.329
The eight hour work day cause was taken up
once again in Britain in 1884 by Tom Mann

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:52.840
who was part of the Social Democratic Federation.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.390
Mann subsequently formed an “Eight Hour
League” whose sole goal was to get the eight

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.200
hour work day established.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.109
Their biggest victory came when they managed
to convince the Trades Union Congress, which

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:08.160
represents the majority of unions in Britain-
and does so even to this day- to establish

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.910
the eight hour work day as one of their primary
goals, which they subsequently began to work

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:13.910
towards.

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.330
The push for a shorter work day began earlier
in the United States, in 1791, with workers

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.120
in Philadelphia striking for a ten hour total
work day that would include two hours for

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.120
meals.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.411
By the 1830s, support for eight hour work
days was shared among the majority of the

00:02:29.411 --> 00:02:34.370
working class people in the United States,
but still failed to find support among business

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:35.370
owners.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.159
Over the next few decades, workers continued
to hold strikes demanding shorter working

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:43.280
hours and gradually things began improving.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.280
Momentum for the cause particularly picked
up with several “Eight Hour Leagues” forming

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.400
in the United States, as Mann had formed in
Britain around this same time.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:58.420
In 1884, the Federation of Organized Trades
and Labor Unions declared that May 1, 1886

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.150
would be the first day that an eight hour
work day would be made mandatory.

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.530
This, of course, was neither backed by any
federal mandate nor the businesses themselves

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:13.240
and relied on workers striking and raising
a general ruckus to drive the point home.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:19.620
When May 1, 1886 arrived, the first ever May
Day parade was held with 350,000 workers walking

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.030
off their jobs protesting for the eight hour
work day.

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:28.610
Progress was still slow though and it wasn’t
until 1905 that industries began implementing

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.290
the eight hour work day on their own accord.

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.170
One of the first businesses to implement this
was the Ford Motor Company, in 1914, which

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:41.040
not only cut the standard work day to eight
hours, but also doubled their worker’s pay

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.290
in the process.

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.360
To the shock of many industries, this resulted
in Ford’s productivity off of these same

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.500
workers, but with fewer hours, actually increasing
significantly and Ford’s profit margins

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.720
doubled within two years after implementing
this change.

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.989
This encouraged other companies to adopt the
shorter, eight hour work day as a standard

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:01.549
for their employees.

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:07.010
Finally, in 1937 the eight hour work day was
standardized in the United States and regulated

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.820
by the federal government according to the
Fair Labor Standards Act.

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:15.810
It stipulated that workers were not to work
more than 44 hours per week and any hours

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.570
over 40 required of the worker were to be
paid with overtime bonuses added to their

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:34.660
normal pay rate.
