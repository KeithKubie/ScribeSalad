00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.690
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Good afternoon,
everyone, and thank you all

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:28.500
for coming to the African
Middle-East Division.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.950
I'm Mary-Jane Deeb,
Chief of the Division,

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:32.810
and I'm delighted to see you all.

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:37.290
We have with us -- I want
to recognize Chris Murphy,

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.870
who is the Head of the Near East
Section here for many, many years,

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:47.810
and a colleague, and also Michael
Albin, who was a comrade in arms

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.120
when we went to Iraq together.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.060
And he was the Head of the
Anglo-American Acquisitions,

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.930
and also Director of
our office in Cairo.

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:06.040
I want just to say a few
words about our division.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.230
Our division is made
up of three sections,

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:12.060
as I think all of you know.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.180
But anyway, this is for the
camera, so I always say that.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.440
The African, the Near East
and the Hebraic Section.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:26.070
We collect from 78
different countries in Africa,

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.720
in the Middle East, in
Central Asia, in the Caucasus,

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:35.250
and we collect materials primarily

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.970
in this division, books,
and [inaudible].

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:46.170
But we also have CDs, DVDs,
music, photographs, et cetera,

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.100
which are in formats that
we don't usually collect,

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.690
because there are other
divisions that have them.

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.170
But we do have our own
series of materials,

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.830
and of course, we have manuscripts.

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.950
We have lithographs.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.350
And I'm mentioning
that in particular,

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.520
because this would be part of the
discussion of today's presenter.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:18.790
These materials, we preserve, we
keep, we share, we serve, but also,

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.290
we like to have discussed.

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.980
We like to have --
to bring scholars.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.530
We like to have people who have
worked with these materials come

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.590
to our reading room and talk
to us about these materials,

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.870
about the way they were made,

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.930
where they were made,
for whom they were made.

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.230
It gives greater depth
to our collections,

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.790
and it helps us understand
what we have.

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.530
And it helps our patrons also
get a better understanding

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.920
of how these materials can
be used, where they are,

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.690
how accessible they are, sometimes
how rare they are as well.

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.740
So we invite people
to make presentations.

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:04.460
We do displays, and very often, we
have displays in our reading room.

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:07.480
And we show icons that we collect.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:14.190
We've had major exhibitions,
both the Persian Book exhibit --

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.570
we had the Hebraic book exhibit.

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:21.010
We've had actually one on
Afghanistan, and these were letters

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:27.400
that were written by
Afghans to Radio Free Europe

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:32.500
that discussed various issues,
various personal problems

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:38.410
that people -- young people,
older people face in Afghanistan.

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:45.010
It's a unique collection of letters
that we have, in part, scanned,

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:51.280
and that will eventually be
made available digitally online.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.310
But they've already been
organized, collated,

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.760
but still not in a
fashion made available.

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.600
Afghanistan has been a very
special focus of our collections,

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:10.860
and we have acquired, from the
Afghan Media Research Center

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:18.450
in Kabul, over 95,000 photographs.

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.100
That's the largest
collection ever on Afghanistan,

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.920
which have been digitized.

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.400
Those photographs have
been digitized in Kabul

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.370 position:56%
by the Afghan Media Research Center.

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:36.790
They cover a period from
the late '70s to 2012.

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:41.970
We've got films -- a collection of
films and videos from that center

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:51.290
that are now in our research --
in our motion picture collection.

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:53.850
And we have sound recordings
as well.

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.950
That's in addition to the books,
the serials, the journals,

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.630 position:56%
and the lithographs and manuscripts.

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:03.140
I also want to recognize Hirad
Dinavari, who's been in charge

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:08.400
of our Afghan collection, who's
done a fantastic job in organizing

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.350
and having a lot of our
materials digitized and reviewed.

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:16.180
And we have here Jan
Lancaster, who, herself,

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:21.960
has gone through all our
manuscripts, Persian manuscripts

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.560
and Afghan manuscripts
and lithographs,

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.890
and identified the
problems with them.

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:32.350
We have the Preservation
Division here, that has looked

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:37.430
at our materials and advised
us about what to do with them.

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:43.330
So collecting is just the
beginning of the process

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:49.500
by which we integrate the new
collections into our system,

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:55.230
and sharing with us today is
Elham Bakhtary, who has worked

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:58.310
with these materials, and who
will be sharing his research

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:00.980
and his work on these materials.

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:05.700
And to introduce him today
is our own Hirad Dinavari,

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:10.040
our Persian specialist, who
has done tremendous work

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:15.020
in developing the collections
and preserving them.

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:16.530
So I'll pass it on to Hirad.

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:18.590
Thank you.

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:19.890
&gt;&gt; Hirad Dinavari:
Thank you, Mary-Jane,

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:22.420
for a wonderful introduction,
and I want to thank you all

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:25.490 position:56%
for being here on a busy lunch hour.

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:30.550
I'm sure you would be happier
with food, but I also want

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:34.050
to take a minute and echo what
Mary-Jane mentioned before

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:36.940
introducing our wonderful
speaker, Elham.

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:41.840 position:56%
This has been a personal passion for
me in the last few years of working

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:47.300
with materials, both manuscripts
and lithograph from the region

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:51.390
in a Persian language, as well
as other regional languages,

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:54.470
especially collections
from Afghanistan.

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:59.260
I'm very delighted to say we have
a good amount of lithographs,

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:02.970
as well as some manuscripts and
early imprints from Afghanistan

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:05.090
that now are being digitized.

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:08.680
I cannot mention enough
how the Upstarts work

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:12.790
with World Digital
Library began the process.

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:16.150
And we have a wonderful
representative, Chris Masciangelo,

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:21.120 position:56%
here, who worked with us closely as
we identified over 100 Afghan titles

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:26.410
that we digitized for that
project, in Pashtu and in Persian,

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:29.750
Dari Persian, that
are now being used.

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:34.230
And the positive side of that
is researchers like Elham,

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:38.840 position:56%
who are now coming and are using our
Afghan materials, and are delighted

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:41.650
that this material
is available online.

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:45.690
And whatever did not get under the
-- get done under the WDL project,

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:49.160
in the project we are
doing now, the Persian --

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:52.750
rare Persian language digitization
project, we are now going

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:56.090
to digitize in the next few
years, from the whole region.

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:58.130
Persian materials from
Iran, Afghanistan,

00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:00.680
Central Asia, India and beyond.

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:03.760
So with that, I want to take
a minute and introduce Elham.

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:07.890
Elham is a doctoral candidate who
was awarded a Mellon Fellowship

00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:11.580
in the past year at the
Library's Preservation Division

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:15.990
to conduct research on early Afghan
lithography and printing press.

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:20.570
He made extensive use of Ahmed's
rare Persian language materials,

00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:25.070
lithographic and early imprint,
as well as some Pashtu, and even,

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:28.030
I would say, some regional
publications in Persian

00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:32.770
from all over, as well as Arabic
and even Central Asian material.

00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:39.210
Prior to beginning his doctoral
program and GW in the fall of 2012,

00:08:39.210 --> 00:08:43.830
he completed a B.A. in History
at the University of California,

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:45.490
Davis Campus, where he focused

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:47.480
on Middle Eastern and
South Asian history.

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:52.910
After finishing his undergraduate
work, he went to complete his M.A.

00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:58.340
in History in San Francisco State
University, where he began to focus

00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:02.160
on Islamic intellectual
thought in the British Empire.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:07.310 position:56%
His research draws heavily on
English, Persian and Arabic sources,

00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:13.940
and I also want to mention that he
has published an official subaltern

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:18.570
in Islamic modernist narratives
of the first Anglo-Afghan War,

00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:21.970
the 44th Annual Conference
on South Asia.

00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:25.760
And this was done in Madison,
Wisconsin, produced by them,

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:30.800
Center for South Asian Studies
in Wisconsin University.

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:34.710
Thank you, Elham, and again, I
look forward to working with you.

00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:38.170
I hear that Elham will be coming
back soon to do some more work

00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:42.690
at the Library, and I am looking
forward to working with you on --

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:46.800
closely on better understanding
and appreciating our Afghan --

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:48.440
rare Afghan collections
here at the Library.

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.240
Thank you.

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:55.570
[ Applause ]

00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:57.410
&gt;&gt; Elham Bakhtary: Thank you,
Mary-Jane, and thank you, Hirad,

00:09:57.410 --> 00:09:58.710
for that wonderful introduction.

00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:02.060
I want to extend a warm thank-you
to the entire Library of Congress

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:05.730
for having afforded me the
opportunity to do this research.

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:08.580 position:56%
This has been an incredible
resource, and I've been so fortunate

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:12.740 position:56%
to be located at an institution so
close by to the Library of Congress.

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:15.340
I wouldn't have been able to do it
without the Library of Congress,

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:18.070
especially the African and
Middle-Eastern Division,

00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:20.520
and with the help of
wonderful staff.

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:24.130
I've done research in
England, Afghanistan, India,

00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:28.080
and I can tell you for sure that
there's not as helpful of a staff

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:31.260
as the staff here at the
African-Middle-Eastern Division.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:32.840
So thank you again, Mary-Jane.

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:36.130 position:56%
Thank you to Joan Weeks, and a
special thank-you to Hirad Dinavari.

00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:39.790
He really is the jewel in the
crown of my research, if you will,

00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:41.840
and he's been with me
every step of the way.

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:44.070
And I wouldn't be able to do it
without the help of these people.

00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:48.450 position:56%
And the Library of Congress has been
especially helpful when it comes

00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:50.100
to the history of print
in Afghanistan.

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:55.370
Now, print began during the
reign of Emir Sher Ali Khan.

00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:58.970
Let me pull up the
PowerPoint real quick.

00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:05.360 position:56%
This handsome individual right here.

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:09.500
He -- his reign was split into
two parts, because he was engaged

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:12.300
in a civil war with
his older brothers.

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:16.080
And he was the first one to
actually bring the printing press

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:18.420
to Afghanistan, but we don't
actually have a whole lot

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:21.800
of materials that are in
existence from that time period,

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:26.440 position:56%
because when the British invaded
Afghanistan in 1878 to dethrone him,

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:29.270
they shelled the Bala
Hissar, his fortress,

00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:32.560
where the printing
house was located.

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:36.480
And the printing house was
burned, and subsequently looted.

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:40.650
And so we don't have many
materials from that time period.

00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:46.060
Now, the Library of Congress
has shown incredible diligence

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:50.360
in collecting materials, and so
they only have a few materials

00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:51.660
from this time period.

00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:54.300
But I want you to understand
that this is a huge share

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:56.380
of the materials that exist.

00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:57.770
There aren't that many at all.

00:11:57.770 --> 00:12:01.020
And so I just want to quickly go
through the ones that I analyzed.

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:03.290
These are just the ones from the
period of Emir Sher Ali Khan.

00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:06.270
There are many more
materials from the --

00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:09.360
from Afghanistan, from the
reigns of Emir Abdur Rahman Khan,

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:12.050
Emir Habibullah Khan,
and going on forth.

00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:16.370
So these are specifically
amongst the first prints

00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:21.240
from Afghanistan's
-- from Afghanistan.

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:24.540
And so the first is
[foreign language],

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:29.430
meaning the conclusive argument
invalidating the misleading

00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:30.730
Wahabi creed.

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:35.050
The next item is "Shamsa Nihar,"
and we have two issues here

00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:36.990
at the Library of Congress,
two original issues.

00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:41.530
"Shamsa Nihar" meaning the morning
sun, Afghanistan's first newspaper.

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:43.940
And the last one is
[foreign language],

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:47.320
which means gift to the Ulama.

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:50.430
Now, the first item,
as the title suggests,

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:53.640
is a polemic written
targeting Wahabis.

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:57.570
The second two I would describe
as mirrors for subjects.

00:12:57.570 --> 00:12:59.430
These are materials that
are instructing subjects,

00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:02.430
including the Ulama, on
how to behave as Muslims,

00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:04.440
what are their duties and
obligations as Muslims,

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:07.060
and what are their
obligations to the ruler.

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:08.360
And in this talk, I
will suggest that,

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:11.270
although the Emir's Court
initially used propaganda

00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:13.580
to attack the Wahabis,
it was the Wahabis

00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:15.650
that inspired these
latter forms of propaganda

00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:17.580
in both form and substance.

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:21.450
Now, this project was a
bit difficult to undertake,

00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:23.460
since there wasn't much
existing scholarship

00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:25.520
on the history of print
in Afghanistan.

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:29.540 position:56%
There have been some developments
in recent years studying the history

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:31.830
of print in the Middle
East and South Asia.

00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:35.540
Unfortunately, Afghanistan
is treated like a square peg

00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:37.720
in the study of the
Middle East and South Asia,

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:39.590
so much of this scholarship --

00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:41.600
or, almost all of this
scholarship doesn't really touch

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:43.520
on Afghanistan at all.

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:45.690
And there have been recent
developments in the study

00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:48.140
of Afghanistan in the 19th century,

00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:50.300
but most of this scholarship
concerns the reign

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:54.090 position:56%
of Emir Sher Ali Khan's predecessor
and father, Emir Dost Mohammad Khan,

00:13:54.090 --> 00:13:58.000
as well as his successor and
cousin, Emir Abdur Rahman Khan.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.640
But Emir Sher Ali Khan
keeps getting skipped over.

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:03.060
So there wasn't really a whole lot

00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:05.620
of existing scholarship
for me to work with.

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:08.740
So I want to give a brief
survey of the history

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:11.970
of print during Emir
Sher Ali Khan's reign.

00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:14.140
According to colonial sources,

00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:18.350
Emir Sher Ali Khan imports
a printing press in 1869,

00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:21.160
and that's a lithographic
press, [foreign language],

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:22.870
as it's referred to in Persian.

00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:28.490
And he imported this press for
the purpose of printing stamps.

00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:33.330
You see in the image on the left of
a 19th century lithographic press

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:38.040
in operation, the operator is
rolling the ink onto the limestone,

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:41.750
and to the right, you see an image
of a stamp from Sher Ali's reign.

00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:44.310
And in the center is
actually the image of a lion,

00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:47.720
and this was a common symbol
used throughout Emir Sher Ali

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.020
Khan's reign.

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:51.370
His name, Sher, meaning lion.

00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:55.910
And that he imported the press
to print stamps is telling,

00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:58.540
in that it shows that the press
was not originally intended

00:14:58.540 --> 00:14:59.920
for propaganda.

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:02.390
It's not until two
years later, actually,

00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:04.480
that we have the first
works of propaganda.

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:08.280
So why did he decide to start
using the press for propaganda?

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:10.260
Well, to answer that question,
we look at the first works

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:13.480
of propaganda, both of which
were religious polemics targeting

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:14.780
the Wahabis.

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:17.440
Now, these are not the Wahabis
you might be thinking of,

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:23.120
the Arabian Wahabis founded by
Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab of Najd.

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:25.980
This is actually referring
to the Tariqah-i-Muhammadiyah

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:30.010
who were a militant revivalist
movement founded in India

00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:35.780
by Syed Ahmad of Raebareli,
and Shah Ismail of Delhi.

00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:38.960
And they were a militant
revivalist movement,

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:42.780 position:56%
and they were called Wahabis because
of the similarity of their ideas

00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:46.860
and actions to the Arabian Wahabis.

00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:49.010
But they actually had
no organizational ties.

00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:52.800
The actual forerunner to the
movement was a contemporary

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:54.330
of Mohammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab.

00:15:54.330 --> 00:15:56.140
They were actually
born in the same year,

00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:58.120
and his name was Shah
Wali Allah of Delhi.

00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:01.420
And Shah Wali Allah of Delhi,
we could describe more or less

00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:04.730
as a salafi, meaning someone
who believed that the society

00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:08.780
of the Prophet Mohammed and the
Rashidun Caliphate were a model

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:11.870
for contemporary Muslims, and
that contemporary Muslims could

00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:14.080
and should emulate that society.

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:17.350
And they would do that by
purging themselves of innovations

00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:20.610
that had cropped into the
religion since that time period.

00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:24.080
And some of these innovations, the
ones that he went after the most,

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:25.380
were what he referred

00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:29.770
to as pseudo-Sufi practices
in society at large.

00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:31.070
Oh, sorry.

00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:32.370
It's a little high.

00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:34.870
Okay. Sorry about that.

00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:38.170
So, some of the practices
that he went after he referred

00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:40.000
to as pseudo-Sufi practices

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.360
that were common throughout
British India.

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:47.870
And these practices revolved around
Sufi saints, both past and present,

00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:52.310 position:56%
and these included acts like asking
saints for intercession between them

00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:55.010
and God, shrine-oriented worship,

00:16:55.010 --> 00:16:57.710
the wearing of towels,
[inaudible] and charms.

00:16:57.710 --> 00:17:01.120
And Shah Wali Allah believed that
these practices were very prevalent

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:03.920
because Muslims actually
didn't know the Quran.

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:08.610
Very few Muslims actually
were able to read the Quran,

00:17:08.610 --> 00:17:09.910
because of it being in Arabic.

00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:13.010
And he believed that
if they knew the Quran,

00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:14.500
they wouldn't be doing
these practices.

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:18.610
If they actually knew what the
contents of the Quran were,

00:17:18.610 --> 00:17:21.580
they would immediately
stop all these kind

00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:25.300
of shrine-oriented
activities and what have you.

00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:29.560
Now, the issue was, in India
and most of the Islamic world,

00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:31.430 position:56%
it was taboo to translate the Quran.

00:17:31.430 --> 00:17:33.720
The consensus was that you
could not translate the Quran

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:36.160
without distorting the meaning.

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:40.320
But Shah Wali Allah, being very
confident in his skills in Arabic

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:43.620
and Persian, decided to translate
the Quran from Arabic to Persian.

00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:46.340
And this was really
the first translation

00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:48.920
of the Quran in South Asia.

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:51.890
And he translated this
Quran specifically

00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:56.550
for Mughal Court officials
and elite military officers.

00:17:56.550 --> 00:17:59.060
And my theory is that he did
it just specifically for them

00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:00.820
because they were the
decision makers in India.

00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:05.510
And he believed that the decline of
Muslim political power in India had

00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:07.980
to do with this improper
practice of Islam.

00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:10.720
He believed that if you get
the decision makers of India

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:14.220
to practice Islam correctly, they
could understand what Islam --

00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:15.910
the true message of Islam was,

00:18:15.910 --> 00:18:19.260
and they could potentially
administrate the country better

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:22.240
and right the ship, if you will.

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:25.790
The Tariqah-i-Muhammadiyah
take this message,

00:18:25.790 --> 00:18:27.750
but they want to expand
it beyond the court.

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:32.670 position:56%
They want to take it to the streets,
if you will, and they believed that,

00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:36.350
for society to change,
everyone needed to be involved.

00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:38.140
It couldn't just be
something that was top-down.

00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:41.430
It really had to be
bottom-up to a certain extent.

00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:45.960
And scholars theorize that they
believed that this was possible

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:48.470 position:56%
because of the printing press, okay?

00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:49.930
That the printing press
inspired them,

00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:52.810
that Shah Wali Allah's
reformation could be expanded

00:18:52.810 --> 00:18:54.890
to society at large.

00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:58.370
And so they used print
relatively early in their movement.

00:18:58.370 --> 00:19:01.700
Starting in 1824, they established
a printing press in Calcutta.

00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:04.590
Subsequently, they
established presses in Delhi,

00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:07.180
Lucknow, Lahore and other cities.

00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:10.460
And they write pamphlets that
almost anyone could understand.

00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:12.270
If they couldn't read them,
if they were read to them,

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:15.200
at least they would be able
to understand the language.

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:19.320
And they used a simplified form of
Persian in their initial pamphlets.

00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:21.750
Now, when Shah Wali Allah wrote,
he wrote in Arabic and Persian,

00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:25.200 position:56%
and he wrote in a very sophisticated
form of Arabic and Persian.

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:26.900
So even if it was read to you,

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:30.350
you might not actually understand
what he was talking about,

00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:33.190
but they wrote with
the masses in mind.

00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:36.310
And eventually, they
started writing in Urdu,

00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:40.560
which was a spoken language
among some Indian Muslims.

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:44.800
So it was not just simply an
acquired language like Persian was.

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:49.840
This is an image of a
Tariqah publication.

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:52.480
This is a work by Shah Abdul Aziz,

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:55.190
who was actually not a
member of the Tariqah.

00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:58.650
He was the son of Shah Wali Allah,
and he was revered by the Tariqah.

00:19:58.650 --> 00:20:01.410
And so they made efforts
to publish his work.

00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:02.710
This one, [foreign language],

00:20:02.710 --> 00:20:08.130
and most of their lithographs
look like this.

00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:12.620
And you kind of see the
variety of scripts being used,

00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:14.900
[foreign language]
here, and so this kind

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:17.470
of gives you the idea
of what they look like.

00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:18.810
But most of their publications,

00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:20.870
especially their initial
publications,

00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:26.570
were works that were dedicated
to attacking the pseudo-Sufism

00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:28.620
that Shah Wali Allah spoke of.

00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:30.560
And the most important work

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:32.700
in the initial period is a
work called [foreign language],

00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:36.510
"The Strengthening of
Faith," by Shah Ismail.

00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:38.860
So in this book, he
goes after these rituals

00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:41.690
that he considers innovations,
[foreign language] in Islam,

00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:46.050
but he also challenges
traditional theological positions.

00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:50.190
And what he does is, he accuses
scholars, past and present,

00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:52.070 position:56%
of having put limits on God's power.

00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:55.400 position:56%
He says that they mistake the
impossibility of God doing something

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:57.800
for being the inability
of God to do something.

00:20:57.800 --> 00:20:59.530
He gives the case, for example,

00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:02.270
that although God would
not create another prophet,

00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:05.400
Mohammed being the final
prophet, God still has the ability

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:08.500
to create another prophet,
even another Mohammed.

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:11.290 position:56%
Thousands of Mohammeds, if he wills.

00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:15.140
This sets off a firestorm
of debate in India.

00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:19.400
Some of the established Ulama,
like, flipped their lid over this,

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:23.870
and this debate rages
on for three decades,

00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:26.080
and even continues
to this day, really.

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:27.480
I mean, you can go on forums today,

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:29.780
and people are still having
these kinds of arguments.

00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:34.000
But really, from the 1830s to
the 1860s, all kinds of works,

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.980
massive volumes, are being
written about this subject.

00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:41.820
Now, Kabul, Afghanistan wasn't
really involved in these debates,

00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:44.830
but that didn't mean that they
weren't aware of these individuals.

00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:47.710
Emir Sher Ali Khan's father
actually, on two occasions,

00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:52.580
had military alliances with
the Tariqah-i-Muhammadiyah.

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:56.780 position:56%
So the Tariqah-i-Muhammadiyah
actually established a militant wing

00:21:56.780 --> 00:22:00.630
in the frontier between
the Punjab and Afghanistan.

00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:06.060
And the reason they did this is
because, in the early 19th century,

00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:08.270
the Sikhs had taken over
the city of Peshawar,

00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:12.150
and they had banned Muslims
there from consuming beef

00:22:12.150 --> 00:22:15.370
and performing the Adhan,
the public call to prayer.

00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:19.620
And the Tariqah had said that
these were grounds for jihad,

00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:20.920
and therefore they went there,

00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:23.430
and they set up a base
to fight the Sikhs.

00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:25.760
And the Afghans were
interested in fighting the Sikhs

00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:28.170
because they had last
Peshawar to the Sikhs.

00:22:28.170 --> 00:22:31.150
And so they found common
ground, and they allied.

00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:34.950 position:56%
But it doesn't seem like they really
had any theological discussions

00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:39.510
in all this chaos, jihad
being the priority.

00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:42.810
The effort fails.

00:22:42.810 --> 00:22:48.980 position:56%
Syed Ahmad and Shah Ismail are both
killed in 1831, and the Afghans give

00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:51.180
up on their attempt
to take back Peshawar.

00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:54.350
However, in 1839, when the
British invaded Afghanistan

00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:56.270
to dethrone Emir Dost
Mohammad Khan, again,

00:22:56.270 --> 00:22:58.410
they strike up another
brief alliance.

00:22:58.410 --> 00:23:01.600
Hundreds of Tariqah members go
to the city of Ghanzi to help put

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:05.330
up a stand with the locals
there, and that fails, as well.

00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:09.570
And, according to reports, they
all returned back to the frontier.

00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:12.190
So none of them remain
in Afghanistan.

00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:16.670
And Kabul doesn't really hear
about them much until 1871.

00:23:16.670 --> 00:23:20.720
And, according to those sources,
they state that in that year,

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:22.990
or sometime before, some Punjabi

00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:27.570
and Peshawari Ulama had forwarded
a request to the Kabul Court

00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:32.720 position:56%
for a refutation of the Tariqah's
beliefs, and the Tariqah's doctrine.

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:35.500 position:56%
Which raises the question, why would
they send this to the Kabul Court?

00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:37.440
There had already been volumes

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:40.430
of works refuting these
individuals' ideas,

00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:43.680 position:56%
authored by well-respected scholars,
scholars that were more imminent

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:46.520
than anyone in Kabul,
including Maulana Hidaboudi

00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:47.910
[assumed spelling].

00:23:47.910 --> 00:23:51.860 position:56%
My theory is that,
traditionally, if you read the works

00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:55.190
in Islamic scholasticism by
authors like Imam Ghazali

00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:58.030
or Fakhr al-Din al-Razi,
they make it very clear

00:23:58.030 --> 00:24:03.910 position:56%
that it's the prerogative of the
Islamic ruler to deal with heretics.

00:24:03.910 --> 00:24:08.330
It's the Islamic ruler that
has to commission the Ulama

00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:09.800
to right heresiographies.

00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:12.970
It's the job of the Ulama to
administer the punishment,

00:24:12.970 --> 00:24:18.340 position:56%
whether that be humiliating them,
imprisoning them, or executing them.

00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:21.400
And the problem for
the Punjabi Ulama is

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:23.030
that the British rule India,

00:24:23.030 --> 00:24:25.900
and they thus cannot give those
refutations the official stamp

00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:28.870
of approval that was
traditionally required.

00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:31.480
Emir Sher Ali Khan was the
nearest independent Muslim ruler

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:34.740
to the Punjab, and it helped that
he had a printing press as well.

00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:38.400
Therefore, he was the natural
choice to commission these works.

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:40.610
And so, two refutations were issued

00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:45.430
from the Kabul Court
in the same year, 1871.

00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:50.640
And so, the work on the
left is [foreign language],

00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:55.100
the one I mentioned earlier.

00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:57.360
This one was a scholarly work.

00:24:57.360 --> 00:24:59.920
It was authored by
Maulana Abdur Rahman,

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:02.300
who was the Chief Kazi [assumed
spelling] during the reign

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:05.570
of Emir Sher Ali Khan, and
it's in Persian and Arabic.

00:25:05.570 --> 00:25:11.330
It uses a lot of classic text,
scholarly sources, a lot of logic.

00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:15.810
The source on the right is [foreign
language], "The Piercing Flame."

00:25:15.810 --> 00:25:18.420
This one was actually
authored by the Emir himself,

00:25:18.420 --> 00:25:21.680
and it was not scholarly at all.

00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:25.180
And the Emir explains
in the tract as to why.

00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:29.140
He states, "In this tract, I
have not entered into discussion

00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:30.440
of many Islamic sciences.

00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:33.870 position:56%
I believe the Ulama in every country
have already crafted responses

00:25:33.870 --> 00:25:36.120
to this [foreign language],
this disbelief.

00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:39.060
But because those writings
include scientific terminology,

00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:41.120
the masses cannot understand them.

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:43.280
Hence, it is not the
Ulama that are falling

00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:45.080
into the claws of these owls.

00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:49.510
Rather, the hunt of these enslavers
is after the mice who are ignorant.

00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:52.670
This is a teeth-shattering response
to the infidels that no one has

00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:54.810
yet to give, which will
render the infidels

00:25:54.810 --> 00:25:58.010
without the strength
and ability to speak."

00:25:58.010 --> 00:26:01.280
And what's interesting about
that work is how much it mirrors

00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:03.420
Tariqah literature.

00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:06.000
The Tariqah, they would focus
on the Quran and Hadith.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.160
They wouldn't really use
the other materials --

00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:12.050
auxiliary materials for
understanding Quran, you know,

00:26:12.050 --> 00:26:13.930
these Tasfird [assumed
spelling] and so forth.

00:26:13.930 --> 00:26:17.600
They would try to make it all
about the Quran and Hadith.

00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:23.900
And if you look at the difference
in materials that are used

00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:25.220
in "Hijat a Kawia"
[assumed spelling] versus

00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:26.520
"Shihadist al Qib"
[assumed spelling],

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:27.820
the ones I have listed here

00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:29.910
for Hijat [assumed
spelling] are just a fraction.

00:26:29.910 --> 00:26:33.320
There are actually many
more sources that are used.

00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:36.070 position:56%
But in "Shahab es Alqib" [assumed
spelling] there are only two sources

00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:38.220
used, and they're not
even really cited.

00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:39.520
They're just kind of mentioned.

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:41.300
Like, I'm not a crazy
man making all this up.

00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:44.350
If you want to read further,
you can find these ideas

00:26:44.350 --> 00:26:47.110
in the Tasfird [assumed spelling]
and Eshapudi [assumed spelling]

00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:48.620
and Albezawi [assumed spelling].

00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:55.310
So otherwise, the text is
really very similar to the kinds

00:26:55.310 --> 00:26:57.020
of literature that are
produced by the Tariqah,

00:26:57.020 --> 00:26:58.410
such as "Taquiet el
Iman" [assumed spelling].

00:26:58.410 --> 00:27:00.400
It's written for society at large,

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:02.530
and it's written in
accessible language.

00:27:02.530 --> 00:27:07.170
And the Emir informs the reader
that he did this intentionally.

00:27:07.170 --> 00:27:10.140
"For the honor of the strong
Mohammed religion, I have decided

00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:14.320
to present in some plain words, in
simple, fluent Persian, the beliefs

00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:17.620
and opinions held by
these unfortunate people."

00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:23.030 position:56%
And so, he was essentially combating
Tariqah propaganda with the same --

00:27:23.030 --> 00:27:27.060
with a similar structure, if you
will, fighting fire with fire.

00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:30.430
Now, interestingly, after these
polemics, the Emir decides

00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:33.630
to produce more propaganda,
not to go after the Tariqah --

00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:38.360 position:56%
he actually never mentions them ever
again in the remaining publications.

00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:41.720
Who he does go after is
Afghanistan's own Ulama,

00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:46.360
and I suggest that, although
both of these texts went

00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:48.980
after the Tariqah viciously,
the Emir learned

00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:52.190
from the Tariqah just how
effective print propaganda could be

00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:56.890
in changing the minds of society,
and challenging recalcitrant Ulama.

00:27:56.890 --> 00:27:59.130
The Tariqah had really
shaken the authority

00:27:59.130 --> 00:28:01.260
of the traditional Ulama in India.

00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:05.090
They had drawn tens of
thousands of followers,

00:28:05.090 --> 00:28:07.960
including seminary students,
away from imminent Ulama.

00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:10.820
Some prominent scholars
even became members.

00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:12.210
As a result, some member --

00:28:12.210 --> 00:28:15.770
some major mosques were reoriented
towards Tariqah doctrine.

00:28:15.770 --> 00:28:19.520
The Tariqah also inspired
the non-militant Deobandi

00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:22.910
and Ahl al-Hadith movements, which
today are major schools of thought

00:28:22.910 --> 00:28:28.270
in India, throughout South Asia,
and including Afghanistan as well.

00:28:28.270 --> 00:28:32.470
Now, why was the Emir interested
in challenging the Ulama?

00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:35.220
Historically, the Ulama in
Afghanistan were central

00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:39.450
to the legitimacy of the Shahs
and Emirs, also instrumental

00:28:39.450 --> 00:28:41.880
in conscripting volunteers
to support them

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:44.200 position:56%
in civil wars, or foreign invasions.

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:46.300
Now, the Emir really needed
their help, because he was trying

00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:48.520
to centralize the government,

00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:51.100
primarily through a
central, modern army.

00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:52.550
And the problem was that a lot

00:28:52.550 --> 00:28:55.900
of Ulama were financially
independent of the Emir.

00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:58.450
They really didn't need
his support, and in turn,

00:28:58.450 --> 00:29:03.530
they really didn't have any need to
give him support for this project.

00:29:03.530 --> 00:29:05.190 position:56%
They had other sources of patronage.

00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:08.100
Tribal chieftains, local
rulers, even the Emir's brothers,

00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:10.970
who were rival claimants
to the throne.

00:29:10.970 --> 00:29:14.940
And these reforms threatened to
disenfranchise the Ulama's patrons

00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:17.960
of their traditional military
authority and revenue.

00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:20.920
Historically, these chieftains and
rulers provided military levies

00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:24.550
to the Shahs and Emirs in
exchange for revenue and autonomy,

00:29:24.550 --> 00:29:26.380
but the Emir was looking
to circumvent them

00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:28.460
and reduce them to pensionaries.

00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:30.820
And so the Ulama, almost
like representatives,

00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:33.410
articulated opposition
to the Emir's reforms,

00:29:33.410 --> 00:29:36.070
but rather than cry
disenfranchisement,

00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:37.680
they made a religious argument

00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:40.250
that the Emir's reforms
were actually innovations,

00:29:40.250 --> 00:29:44.000
[foreign language], with
no precedent in Islam.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.840
Therefore, the Emir was in need of
a way to respond to that argument,

00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:51.210
and after the Wahabi debates,
he begins printing materials

00:29:51.210 --> 00:29:53.520
that targeted that opposition.

00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:56.940
So we look at some of the
latter forms of propaganda,

00:29:56.940 --> 00:30:00.060
and this is the cover from an issue

00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:02.360
of "Shamsa Nihar,"
"The Morning Sun."

00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:05.060
"Shamsa Nihar" was
Afghanistan's first newspaper,

00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:07.590
but it was more --
really like a gazette.

00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:14.200
The earliest issue we have in
existence is from November 6, 1873.

00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:15.500
That's number five.

00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:18.450
This here is number
seven, which is housed here

00:30:18.450 --> 00:30:20.670
at the Library of Congress.

00:30:20.670 --> 00:30:25.560
And this newspaper only has
a run of about three years.

00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:32.130 position:56%
And my theory is that it was founded
on the Emir's intelligence network.

00:30:32.130 --> 00:30:34.230
The newspaper talks
about, for example,

00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:38.040
having foreign correspondents, but
these correspondents were actually

00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:43.570
in the same locations the Emir
would send envoys and diplomats to.

00:30:43.570 --> 00:30:47.560
And so I feel like these were --
these were likely the same people

00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:49.740
that were sending the
reports back to the Emir

00:30:49.740 --> 00:30:51.040
on the ongoing [foreign language],

00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:55.110
and then once the Emir was
done looking at these reports,

00:30:55.110 --> 00:30:58.700
he would then forward them to
the office of "Shamsa Nihar."

00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:03.420
Of course, edited for any
sensitive information.

00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:06.000
Now, when it came to
news around the world,

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.440
the Emir didn't have agents
beyond the neighboring countries

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:11.900
of Afghanistan, but what he
relied on were foreign newspapers,

00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:15.370
especially British
Indian newspapers.

00:31:15.370 --> 00:31:17.160
And I've provided here
a table of some

00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:18.850
of the newspapers that were used.

00:31:18.850 --> 00:31:21.250
There were many more that
were cited in "Shamsa Nihar."

00:31:21.250 --> 00:31:23.820
But you can see that
these newspapers come

00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:29.340
from many different parts of India,
Qureshi, Lehore, Bombay, Calcutta.

00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:31.830
You get a pretty good spread there.

00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:34.670
In different languages,
Persian, English, and Urdu,

00:31:34.670 --> 00:31:38.830 position:56%
and also there were a few newspapers
that have come from London itself,

00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:41.430
including "The Illustrated
London News."

00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:47.300
And "Shamsa Nihar" had a staff
to translate these materials.

00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:49.820
There were a few people there
that were educated in English.

00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:52.600
They had mostly been brought
over from British India

00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:54.940
to work specifically
in this respect.

00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:58.850
And so, although these -- although

00:31:58.850 --> 00:32:01.070
"Shamsa Nihar" would
reprint these stories --

00:32:01.070 --> 00:32:03.500
and they were clearly not original
stories in "Shamsa Nihar" --

00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:06.110
the selection of them
is quite interesting.

00:32:06.110 --> 00:32:09.160
There was news from
all over the world.

00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:11.570
For example, they would talk about
some of the wars that were going

00:32:11.570 --> 00:32:14.410
on in Europe, such as the
Carlist wars in Spain.

00:32:14.410 --> 00:32:17.160
They would also talk a lot about
imperialism going on in the rest

00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:19.390
of the world -- Dutch
Imperialism in East Asia,

00:32:19.390 --> 00:32:21.760
British Imperialism in West Africa.

00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:24.440
And so it really pushed the idea

00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:28.490
that imperialism was a
problem throughout the world,

00:32:28.490 --> 00:32:34.470 position:56%
and that Afghanistan likewise was
under a threat, both by the Russians

00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:36.650
and eventually by the
British as well.

00:32:36.650 --> 00:32:40.360 position:56%
There were also articles on science,
and articles for general knowledge.

00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:42.850
There's an article
about the Pacific Ocean,

00:32:42.850 --> 00:32:45.320
just explaining what the
Pacific Ocean is, how big it is,

00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:47.050
what are some of its features.

00:32:47.050 --> 00:32:50.100
But most importantly, there
were a number of think pieces

00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:53.440
in "Shamsa Nihar," and these were
reflections on the news items,

00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:55.970
or they were printed
speeches of the Emir,

00:32:55.970 --> 00:32:59.120
or his Chief Secretary Kazi Abdul
Khadr Khan [assumed spelling].

00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:01.430
Or they might've been --
even been original articles.

00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:05.340 position:56%
But all of them had the common theme
of enjoining the Emir's subjects

00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:08.250
to take the example of other
countries, and pursue knowledge,

00:33:08.250 --> 00:33:11.670
and show dedication and
loyalty to the Emir.

00:33:11.670 --> 00:33:15.250
And many of these think pieces
also contained criticism

00:33:15.250 --> 00:33:17.220
of the country's Ulama,
and responding

00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:19.720
to the opposition of
the country's Ulama.

00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:26.930
There was even a book published in
1875 specifically for this task,

00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:30.390
this book being called [foreign
language], "Gift to the Ulama."

00:33:30.390 --> 00:33:32.260
And you can see it's in
pretty rough condition.

00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:36.800
These lithographs have
been through wars,

00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:39.230
going back to the Second
Anglo-Afghan War,

00:33:39.230 --> 00:33:42.780
and up to the present
war today in Afghanistan.

00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:46.280
So I know they look rough,
but just try to understand

00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:49.880
that they've seen a
lot of destruction.

00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:55.100
And this work -- it opposes
the Ulama in a similar way

00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:59.360
to how the Tariqah
opposed the Ulama of India.

00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:02.220
And my dissertation will look
at the ways both "Shamsa Nihar"

00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:05.680
and [foreign language]
used the discursive methods

00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:07.240
of Tariqah literature.

00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:12.010
But for now, I just want to
discuss -- for the time remaining,

00:34:12.010 --> 00:34:14.120
I wanted to discuss the
staff that was involved

00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:17.080
in the production of
these lithographs.

00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:20.330
And we don't have a
lot of info about them.

00:34:20.330 --> 00:34:25.340
The British weren't very interested
in the press in Afghanistan,

00:34:25.340 --> 00:34:27.960
at least not until they started
producing materials talking

00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:29.260
about jihad.

00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:30.560
Once they started producing
materials about jihad,

00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:32.310
then they started paying
a little closer attention.

00:34:32.310 --> 00:34:35.100
But we don't really have much
knowledge about the staff

00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:38.310
that actually operated the
press, and was responsible

00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:40.310
for creating these materials.

00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:44.220
All we know is what we can gather
from these materials themselves.

00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:46.880
And it's -- very interesting is
that we see a very clear Shia

00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:51.310
and Iranian element in the
production of these lithographs.

00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:54.680
For example, the two
works against the Wahabis,

00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:56.140
"Hijat a Kawia" [assumed spelling]

00:34:56.140 --> 00:34:58.430
and "Shahab es Alqib"
[assumed spelling],

00:34:58.430 --> 00:35:02.740
were produced by a man named
Mirza Mohammed Saldit ab Izi

00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:04.040
[assumed spelling].

00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:06.680
Now, that he was from
Tabriz is not a surprise,

00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:10.020
because Tabriz was the first
site of printing in Iran,

00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:12.960 position:56%
both for typography and lithography.

00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:17.370
And Tabrizis would go to other
parts of the Islamic world,

00:35:17.370 --> 00:35:19.420
establish presses and newspapers.

00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:22.400
The newspaper "Akhtar"
in Istanbul, for example,

00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:25.670
was founded by a Tabrizi.

00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:30.630
And there was a Tabrizi diaspora
throughout the Ottoman Empire,

00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:31.930
also in parts of India.

00:35:31.930 --> 00:35:35.110
So the fact that Mirza Mohammed
Saldit [assumed spelling] was

00:35:35.110 --> 00:35:38.780
from Tabriz, and probably
helped found the printing press

00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:41.860
in Afghanistan and operate it,
shouldn't be that surprising.

00:35:41.860 --> 00:35:45.340 position:56%
There was another Iranian associated
with the production of this work,

00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:48.240 position:56%
"Tu Fatul Ulama" [assumed spelling],

00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:51.290
Mirza Baizahan Shirazi
[assumed spelling],

00:35:51.290 --> 00:35:55.570
and Shiraz also had printing
established there long

00:35:55.570 --> 00:35:56.870
before Afghanistan.

00:35:56.870 --> 00:36:01.660
So it probably appears that
the Emir sought out people

00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:02.960
that could help run the press.

00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:06.620
Since Afghanistan had not
had a press before his reign,

00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:10.080
there was no one there really
adequately trained to operate it,

00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:14.490
and so he needed to import labor
that was familiar with that.

00:36:14.490 --> 00:36:18.210
With "Shamsa Nihar," interestingly,
though, the name that is associated

00:36:18.210 --> 00:36:22.600
with it as the director and editor
is Mirza abd el Ali [assumed

00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:23.990
spelling], and he does not have
a nispa [assumed spelling].

00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:26.950
He is not identified
with a city in Iran.

00:36:26.950 --> 00:36:32.360
So my guess is that he was
Kizilbash, of the Kizilbashia,

00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:36.450 position:56%
Kizilbash community in Afghanistan
who had a long history in that area,

00:36:36.450 --> 00:36:40.340
since of the time of Nader
Shah Afsharid, as mercenaries,

00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:44.410
and then later as mirzas,
secretaries and clerks.

00:36:44.410 --> 00:36:49.090
And he was put in charge
specifically of "Shamsa Nihar,"

00:36:49.090 --> 00:36:51.830
and its content, and editing it.

00:36:51.830 --> 00:36:55.130 position:56%
I'm not sure if he was actually
involved in the process of producing

00:36:55.130 --> 00:36:57.770
"Shamsa Nihar," but it's
possible that he learned it

00:36:57.770 --> 00:37:00.190
from Mirza Mohammed Sald et
Tarbrizi [assumed spelling]

00:37:00.190 --> 00:37:03.630
or Mirza Baizah Han Sher
Azi [assumed spelling].

00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:08.980
Now, it's interesting how this
Shia individuals are helping the

00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:12.510
production of works that are
challenging the Tariqahalan Ulama.

00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:16.140
And it appears that their
religious beliefs might have risked

00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:20.070
discrediting the authority
of the materials produced.

00:37:20.070 --> 00:37:25.890
And what was interesting as I was
going through them, I noticed that,

00:37:25.890 --> 00:37:28.330
in the kalathan [phonetic] of
Shihab es Alhib [assumed spelling],

00:37:28.330 --> 00:37:34.930
the one authored by Emir Sher Ali
Khan, you read [foreign language],

00:37:34.930 --> 00:37:39.400
"by the effort of Mirza Mohammad
Sal et Tabrizi [assumed spelling]."

00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:40.700
However, in the kalathan
[assumed spelling]

00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:42.720
for "Hijat a Kawia"
[assumed spelling],

00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:44.020
we see [foreign language].

00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:50.120
The Tabrizi was left
out, interestingly.

00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:54.150
And the author of "Hijat a
Kawia" [assumed spelling] was an

00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:57.450
established Alim in
Afghanistan, a traditional Alim,

00:37:57.450 --> 00:37:59.060
Maulana Abdur Rahaman Khan.

00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:04.880
His father had actually written
heresiographies against the Shias

00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:09.880
of Iran during the Kadjar Sarazai
[assumed spelling] over Heerat

00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:12.320
in the early 19th century.

00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:15.770
And so, it seems that
he actually requested

00:38:15.770 --> 00:38:20.410
that the Tabrizi be left out,
because it would be a dead giveaway

00:38:20.410 --> 00:38:23.470
that a Shia was involved in
the production of this work.

00:38:23.470 --> 00:38:26.790
And that would highly
discredit its authority, almost.

00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:31.470
However, the Emir left it in, and
it kind of shows you the difference

00:38:31.470 --> 00:38:37.270
in mentalities between the Emir and
a traditional Alim in Afghanistan.

00:38:37.270 --> 00:38:38.570
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: And the styling.

00:38:38.570 --> 00:38:40.030
&gt;&gt; Elham Bakhtary:
And the style, yeah.

00:38:40.030 --> 00:38:42.040
[ Inaudible Speaker ]

00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:43.340
Very different, yeah.

00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:44.640
Absolutely.

00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:46.840 position:56%
Yeah. [Foreign language] Absolutely.

00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:48.140
Absolutely.

00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:51.250
So I hope this gave you some
understanding of the origins

00:38:51.250 --> 00:38:52.940
of print in Afghanistan,
and I look forward

00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:54.750
to any questions you might have.

00:38:54.750 --> 00:38:56.050
&gt;&gt; Hirad Dinavari: I have
[inaudible] question.

00:38:56.050 --> 00:39:01.030
A lot of what you were examining,
these [inaudible] prints, binding,

00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:07.740
things of that sort, and I know

00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:16.870
that you didn't have enough
time to focus on that.

00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:21.280
But just to give an overview,
what did you find from looking

00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:23.850
at all these Afghan and
other regional lithographs?

00:39:23.850 --> 00:39:27.460
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Could you repeat
the question for the [inaudible]?

00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:28.760
&gt;&gt; Elham Bakhtary: Okay.

00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:34.570
Okay. So Hirad is referencing my
research that I did this past year,

00:39:34.570 --> 00:39:37.780
working with the Preservation
Research Testing Division

00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:40.580
of the Library of Congress,
and we were trying

00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:43.000
to establish the provenance

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.590
of the printing press itself,
and of the papers used.

00:39:45.590 --> 00:39:48.240
And originally, I was
intrigued by this topic

00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:50.700
because of these Iranian staff
members of the printing press,

00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:53.300
because Iran really learned
the printing press from Russia.

00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:54.780
People were -- had been sent
there to learn the printing press.

00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:56.080
They'd imported the
printing press from Russia,

00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:57.380
and they also would import
materials from Russia.

00:39:57.380 --> 00:39:58.770
So I was curious if -- where
were the materials coming from?

00:39:58.770 --> 00:40:00.070
Were they coming more
from British India?

00:40:00.070 --> 00:40:01.370
Were they coming from Russia?

00:40:01.370 --> 00:40:02.670
Possibly Iran as well, because Iran
started producing its own paper

00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:04.200
in this time period as well.

00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:06.880
What we discovered is that more
or less, the materials did come

00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:10.070
from British India, and we had
a chance to look at a number

00:40:10.070 --> 00:40:14.060
of watermarks that
were in some of these,

00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:17.240
especially "Hijat a Kawia" [assumed
spelling] and "Shamsa Nihar."

00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:18.940
They had wonderful watermarks,

00:40:18.940 --> 00:40:22.320
and all of them came
from mills in London.

00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:24.860
And we believe that this paper
had been sent to British India,

00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:27.700
and then purchased
from British India.

00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:30.630
And this is a good indication

00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:33.270
that the printing press itself
also came from British India.

00:40:33.270 --> 00:40:36.550
It was definitely transported to
Afghanistan through British India,

00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:40.690
and it was prob -- it was likely
created in British India as well.

00:40:40.690 --> 00:40:45.140
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much
for a very good speech,

00:40:45.140 --> 00:40:47.040
and a very [inaudible] subject.

00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:48.340
&gt;&gt; Elham Bakhtary: Right, right.

00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:49.720
&gt;&gt; Full of questions.

00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:52.090
But what about Pashtu publications?

00:40:52.090 --> 00:40:54.870
Were there Pashtu publications?

00:40:54.870 --> 00:40:57.330
Were the publications sold?

00:40:57.330 --> 00:40:58.860
How were they distributed?

00:40:58.860 --> 00:41:03.170
In other instances, [inaudible]
primarily in the early days,

00:41:03.170 --> 00:41:09.530
where [inaudible] focus of
printing was a modernizing impulse.

00:41:09.530 --> 00:41:13.560
This doesn't seem to be
necessarily the case here.

00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:17.190
So could you discuss
Pashtu versus Persian,

00:41:17.190 --> 00:41:20.660
and how the materials were
distributed and [inaudible]?

00:41:20.660 --> 00:41:21.960
&gt;&gt; Elham Bakhtary: Okay.

00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:24.410
So in regards to Pashtu,
yes, in this period of time,

00:41:24.410 --> 00:41:27.360
the first materials of Pashtu
are being printed as well.

00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:30.750
But these were mostly
military manuals

00:41:30.750 --> 00:41:33.290
that were translated from English.

00:41:33.290 --> 00:41:37.150
The Emir wanted Pashtu to be the
official language of the military.

00:41:37.150 --> 00:41:40.540
Which is ironic, because all the
other publications are in Persian.

00:41:40.540 --> 00:41:43.540
So this -- you can kind of
see some of the contradictions

00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:48.490 position:56%
that are already starting to emerge
in the ideology of the Afghan state.

00:41:48.490 --> 00:41:50.930
And so you have one -- you have
Persian as sort of the language

00:41:50.930 --> 00:41:53.590
of culture, the language
of politics and diplomacy,

00:41:53.590 --> 00:41:54.890 position:56%
but on the other hand, you're trying

00:41:54.890 --> 00:41:57.500
to make Pashtu the
language of the military.

00:41:57.500 --> 00:42:03.330
And there are actually exams being
given in Pashtu as well, so --

00:42:03.330 --> 00:42:06.650
and a lot of the generals
and officers

00:42:06.650 --> 00:42:08.080
in the military were
actually Kizilbash

00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:10.490 position:56%
who were not really Pashtu speakers.

00:42:10.490 --> 00:42:13.510
And so you can kind
of imagine what kind

00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:15.560
of tensions these might
have created.

00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:18.540
Unfortunately, we don't
have any of these manuals,

00:42:18.540 --> 00:42:23.000
these military manuals
that are in Pashtu.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.970
But under Emir Abdur Rahman Khan,

00:42:25.970 --> 00:42:28.630
similar manuals were produced,
and those are available.

00:42:28.630 --> 00:42:29.950
The British Library
has some of those,

00:42:29.950 --> 00:42:32.080
and I had a chance to
look at some of them.

00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:35.290
But otherwise, they're really
just straight translations

00:42:35.290 --> 00:42:37.960
of the British Indian manuals.

00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:40.220
And as far as --

00:42:40.220 --> 00:42:41.520
&gt;&gt; Sale, sale.

00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:44.180
&gt;&gt; Elham Bakhtary: The
sales of these materials,

00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:49.640
I would say that the polemics were
distributed throughout Afghanistan

00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:54.550
to provincial rulers, to be read
in public, either in the bazaars

00:42:54.550 --> 00:42:56.560
or in the masjids, in the mosques.

00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:59.400
As for "Shamsa Nihar," it
was available for purchase.

00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:05.440
Actually, info about how to
subscribe was in every issue.

00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:08.740
Based on what I understand
about subsequent newspapers

00:43:08.740 --> 00:43:12.970 position:56%
in Afghanistan, and other newspapers
in the region, such as Iran,

00:43:12.970 --> 00:43:16.590
usually these newspapers
would be forced upon people

00:43:16.590 --> 00:43:17.890
in the government.

00:43:17.890 --> 00:43:22.070
And they would be automatically
docked from their pay.

00:43:22.070 --> 00:43:26.190
So there was that, but also, in
"Shamsa Nihar," it does mention

00:43:26.190 --> 00:43:30.960
that you could -- anyone could
kind of go to a seller of hundis

00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:35.250
in Kabul, a [foreign language],
and they could purchase a hundi,

00:43:35.250 --> 00:43:38.300
and they would get a subscription

00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:41.240
of "Shamsa Nihar" every
week, or every month.

00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:44.700
Actually, it was never printed
regularly, but the idea was

00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:47.730
that it was going to be printed
every week, at least initially.

00:43:47.730 --> 00:43:49.880
And that they could sign
up, and they could get it.

00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:52.180
It's not clear if that shop

00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:55.450
that gave the hundis also
had individual issues.

00:43:55.450 --> 00:43:57.920
It does list the price
of an individual issue,

00:43:57.920 --> 00:44:00.420
but we don't really
have much indication

00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:02.850
as to whether this was
something that would be sold

00:44:02.850 --> 00:44:05.700
on the streets, like
a modern newspaper.

00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:07.310
There was also the possibility

00:44:07.310 --> 00:44:10.390
of purchasing the newspaper
from British India.

00:44:10.390 --> 00:44:13.070
So it gives you instructions
on how to purchase it if you're

00:44:13.070 --> 00:44:17.750
in Peshawar, but it's not really
clear how far it was distributed

00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:19.050
into India.

00:44:19.050 --> 00:44:23.220 position:56%
You could purchase it from Peshawar,
but we don't really have any info --

00:44:23.220 --> 00:44:25.700
idea of how far or
widely it was distributed.

00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:30.680
So we could -- we would limit
the readership to the area

00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:34.870
of Afghanistan and the
immediate area in British India.

00:44:34.870 --> 00:44:36.190
&gt;&gt; One other question, please.

00:44:36.190 --> 00:44:40.720
The Ulama had no printing way of
rebutting this, or participating

00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:44.140
in print in a debate with the Emir?

00:44:44.140 --> 00:44:45.440
&gt;&gt; Elham Bakhtary: Not yet.

00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:46.740
No, not yet.

00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:48.040
Not the ones in Afghanistan.

00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:50.120
The Tariqah had the
capability, and it's interesting

00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:53.470
that they don't respond
to these polemics,

00:44:53.470 --> 00:44:56.010
at least not that I know of.

00:44:56.010 --> 00:44:58.000
And I think that part
of the reason is

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:04.430
because he was the lone independent
Islamic ruler in the area.

00:45:04.430 --> 00:45:06.100
This would open up
another can of worms,

00:45:06.100 --> 00:45:10.220
if they tried to challenge
him openly about his ideas,

00:45:10.220 --> 00:45:14.520
because he really is the
authority on what is orthodoxy.

00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:19.790
But they do not challenge him,
and it's not until much later

00:45:19.790 --> 00:45:22.710
that you have private
presses in Afghanistan,

00:45:22.710 --> 00:45:25.220
well into the 20th century.

00:45:25.220 --> 00:45:28.690
&gt;&gt; Hiram Dinavari: One more
thing that came up in the work

00:45:28.690 --> 00:45:33.170
that you were doing is, it was
curious that a lot of classics

00:45:33.170 --> 00:45:37.730
of Persian literature,
[inaudible], et cetera, were --

00:45:37.730 --> 00:45:41.690
we tend to find most of
them are from India, really,

00:45:41.690 --> 00:45:44.550
and then partially
Iran and Central Asia.

00:45:44.550 --> 00:45:48.140
With the Afghan material, it
seemed that there was an attempt

00:45:48.140 --> 00:45:52.720
to make it unique -- the content
and subject uniquely Afghan.

00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:56.300
Could you say a few words, as
far as what your theory is,

00:45:56.300 --> 00:45:59.860
why these classics which were
obviously used in Afghanistan

00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:03.530
and not in Afghanistan were
not being produced [inaudible]?

00:46:03.530 --> 00:46:04.830
&gt;&gt; Elham Bakhtary: Right, yeah.

00:46:04.830 --> 00:46:06.740
So this is going to be a big
part of my dissertation research,

00:46:06.740 --> 00:46:10.020
and most of those ideas
are still in beta mode.

00:46:10.020 --> 00:46:12.440
But I will speak to
that a little bit.

00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:17.480
So in [inaudible] Iran, for
example, you do have reproductions

00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:22.220
of these epic works, of
poets like Hafez-e Shirazi,

00:46:22.220 --> 00:46:23.600
of "The Shahnameh" being produced.

00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:26.410
You don't have that in Afghanistan.

00:46:26.410 --> 00:46:32.020
And my theory is that
the Emir Sher Ali Khan,

00:46:32.020 --> 00:46:37.320
when he talks about the history of
Afghanistan, he characterizes it

00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:41.000
as a terra nullius of savagery,

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.870
that Afghanistan was
basically an unknown land

00:46:43.870 --> 00:46:46.670
until he had come to power.

00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:47.970
Afghans were ignorant.

00:46:47.970 --> 00:46:52.690
Afghans lived in darkness, and
I believe that he did not want

00:46:52.690 --> 00:46:56.660
to print these great works
because it would remind people

00:46:56.660 --> 00:46:58.070
of Horsani [assumed
spelling] civilization.

00:46:58.070 --> 00:47:02.180 position:56%
It would remind people of a time
that, indeed, there was civilization

00:47:02.180 --> 00:47:04.090
in Afghanistan, and it
was certainly better

00:47:04.090 --> 00:47:06.950 position:56%
than anything the Emir was building.

00:47:06.950 --> 00:47:11.450
The Emir wanted to portray the
past as simply one of darkness,

00:47:11.450 --> 00:47:14.040
because it would sharpen the
contrast of his own rule.

00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:16.300
And I believe that, unlike
the Punjabs were trying

00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:21.630
to associate their rule with
earlier Iranian dynasties

00:47:21.630 --> 00:47:25.260
like the Saffarids, Emir Sher Ali
Khan did not want any association

00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:30.000
with any previous rulers,
both in Afghanistan and Islam.

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.670
Like the Tariqah, he
actually really tries

00:47:32.670 --> 00:47:35.710
to associate his rule most
closely with the Salaf,

00:47:35.710 --> 00:47:38.880
with the Prophet Mohammad
and the Rashidun Caliphate.

00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:42.420
That's really the history that
he tries to attach his rule,

00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:44.680
and that's how -- and that's
one of the connections I'm going

00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:50.340
to be trying to draw between the
Tariqah and Emir Sher Ali Khan.

00:47:50.340 --> 00:47:51.640
Sure.

00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:53.310
&gt;&gt; Do we have a full list of
the publications that came

00:47:53.310 --> 00:47:56.830
out of Sher Ali Khan's press?

00:47:56.830 --> 00:48:02.710
&gt;&gt; Elham Bakhtary: So there's a lot
of speculation about certain works

00:48:02.710 --> 00:48:05.160
that were produced, but
have been destroyed.

00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:09.770
So there are lists -- I have
a list of works that do exist.

00:48:09.770 --> 00:48:16.760 position:56%
Robert McChesney at NYU has compiled
a list of works that were produced

00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:19.140 position:56%
from the time of Emir Sher Ali Khan.

00:48:19.140 --> 00:48:22.640
But there are also other works that
we don't have any extant copies

00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:25.040
of them, but people speculate --

00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:29.870 position:56%
especially Afghan scholars speculate
them to have been produced.

00:48:29.870 --> 00:48:34.150
And I have some information on that
material, if you're interested,

00:48:34.150 --> 00:48:35.450
and I could share it with you.

&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: With respect to
using [inaudible] as the [inaudible]

00:48:43.150 --> 00:48:51.610
for propaganda, was he also
pushing for reform, organization,

00:48:51.610 --> 00:48:58.650
changes in the society, and
if so, what were the changes

00:48:58.650 --> 00:49:02.280
that he was trying to

00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:09.420
What social, economic, cultural
changes was he pushing for?

00:49:09.420 --> 00:49:11.760
&gt;&gt; Elham Bakhtary: Emir
Sher Ali Khan is trying

00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:16.850
to really just create a central
authority in Afghanistan.

00:49:16.850 --> 00:49:22.780
So the Afghan kingdom was really
founded on a series of partnerships

00:49:22.780 --> 00:49:27.610
with other chieftains
in the Durrani tribe.

00:49:27.610 --> 00:49:31.660
And so there was real no -- there
was not really any central kind

00:49:31.660 --> 00:49:33.180
of leadership throughout
the country.

00:49:33.180 --> 00:49:38.210
There was much autonomy divided
between the different tribes,

00:49:38.210 --> 00:49:44.180 position:56%
and also between the different
brothers, even, in the royal family.

00:49:44.180 --> 00:49:46.990
And he's trying to centralize the
entire country, and he's trying

00:49:46.990 --> 00:49:49.840
to do this primarily
through an army.

00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:52.130
And in "Shamsa Nihar,"
he tries to dress this

00:49:52.130 --> 00:49:56.030
up as creating civilization,
as educating people.

00:49:56.030 --> 00:49:58.880
But when you really look
at it, the civilization

00:49:58.880 --> 00:50:01.980
that he's talking about, the
education that he's talking about,

00:50:01.980 --> 00:50:09.040
the production in arts and crafts,
it all has to do with the military.

00:50:09.040 --> 00:50:13.340
When he talks about education,
for example, and creating scholars

00:50:13.340 --> 00:50:16.370
out of Afghans, he's just
talking about sending them

00:50:16.370 --> 00:50:18.750
to these military schools
that he's established,

00:50:18.750 --> 00:50:21.580
and having them learn
military formations,

00:50:21.580 --> 00:50:23.660
and drills along the
British-Indian model.

00:50:23.660 --> 00:50:27.360 position:56%
When he talks about arts and crafts,
right, bringing manufacturing,

00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:28.860
he's just talking about
the factories

00:50:28.860 --> 00:50:31.030
that he's established
to produce weapons.

00:50:31.030 --> 00:50:34.270
Okay? So even though he's trying
to dress it up as civilization,

00:50:34.270 --> 00:50:38.110
what he's really just talking about
is this militaries that he's trying

00:50:38.110 --> 00:50:40.430
to create, to consolidate
his authority

00:50:40.430 --> 00:50:43.420
