00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.260
the third plate came off of research

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270
the third plate came off of research
 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.670
the third plate came off of research
about the history of our food culture

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680
about the history of our food culture
 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.700
about the history of our food culture
and what I came to realize is that is

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710
and what I came to realize is that is
 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.459
and what I came to realize is that is
that we have a pretty bad history when

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469
that we have a pretty bad history when
 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.490
that we have a pretty bad history when
it comes to food culture and and really

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500
it comes to food culture and and really
 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.080
it comes to food culture and and really
what that means is that we eat off of

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090
what that means is that we eat off of
 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.849
what that means is that we eat off of
this or we have been eating off of what

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859
this or we have been eating off of what
 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.380
this or we have been eating off of what
I was calling the first plate which is

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390
I was calling the first plate which is
 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.570
I was calling the first plate which is
which is a protein centric plate of food

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580
which is a protein centric plate of food
 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.939
which is a protein centric plate of food
it's a it's a it's a steak a seven ounce

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949
it's a it's a it's a steak a seven ounce
 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.290
it's a it's a it's a steak a seven ounce
steak with a little bit of vegetable a

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300
steak with a little bit of vegetable a
 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.839
steak with a little bit of vegetable a
bit of grain on the side but essentially

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849
bit of grain on the side but essentially
 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.830
bit of grain on the side but essentially
it's a protein take center stage and the

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840
it's a protein take center stage and the
 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.430
it's a protein take center stage and the
second plate as I described in in in my

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440
second plate as I described in in in my
 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.650
second plate as I described in in in my
book is is sort of we've come out of the

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660
book is is sort of we've come out of the
 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.299
book is is sort of we've come out of the
first plate and enter the second plate

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309
first plate and enter the second plate
 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.100
first plate and enter the second plate
with is farm-to-table movement like the

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110
with is farm-to-table movement like the
 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.200
with is farm-to-table movement like the
good food movement is is really about

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210
good food movement is is really about
 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.000
good food movement is is really about
knowing where your ingredients come from

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010
knowing where your ingredients come from
 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.090
knowing where your ingredients come from
so so the steak is now grass-fed and the

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100
so so the steak is now grass-fed and the
 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.729
so so the steak is now grass-fed and the
vegetables are are organic and the grain

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739
vegetables are are organic and the grain
 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.350
vegetables are are organic and the grain
is you know instead of white rice it's

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360
is you know instead of white rice it's
 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.930
is you know instead of white rice it's
whole grains but the problem with the

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940
whole grains but the problem with the
 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.430
whole grains but the problem with the
second plate is that it looks very much

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440
second plate is that it looks very much
 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.229
second plate is that it looks very much
like the first plate the architecture is

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239
like the first plate the architecture is
 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.479
like the first plate the architecture is
the same so while it's a better plate of

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489
the same so while it's a better plate of
 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.060
the same so while it's a better plate of
food gastronomically it's better and

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070
food gastronomically it's better and
 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.100
food gastronomically it's better and
from an environmental perspective it's

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110
from an environmental perspective it's
 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.670
from an environmental perspective it's
better the the architecture dictates a

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680
better the the architecture dictates a
 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.560
better the the architecture dictates a
kind of carrying capacity that the land

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570
kind of carrying capacity that the land
 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.770
kind of carrying capacity that the land
can't support at least in our region it

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780
can't support at least in our region it
 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.120
can't support at least in our region it
can't support very long for a growing

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130
can't support very long for a growing
 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.969
can't support very long for a growing
population for a cuisine or for a

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979
population for a cuisine or for a
 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.660

pattern of eating you know two times a

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670
pattern of eating you know two times a
 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.789
pattern of eating you know two times a
day seven days a week to expect that

kind of Architecture from our diets is a

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229
kind of Architecture from our diets is a
 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.950
kind of Architecture from our diets is a
huge expectation and to export that diet

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960
huge expectation and to export that diet
 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.120
huge expectation and to export that diet
to the rest of the world the Western

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130
to the rest of the world the Western
 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.770
to the rest of the world the Western
diet the Emeritus really the American

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780
diet the Emeritus really the American
 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.880
diet the Emeritus really the American
diet is is unfortunate and also the true

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890
diet is is unfortunate and also the true
 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.649

definition of not sustainable

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659
definition of not sustainable
 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.510
definition of not sustainable
so the third plate is sort of a way to

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520
so the third plate is sort of a way to
 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.910
so the third plate is sort of a way to
to kind of circle out of that and take

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920
to kind of circle out of that and take
 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.240
to kind of circle out of that and take
the progress of knowing where our

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250
the progress of knowing where our
 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.889
the progress of knowing where our
ingredients come from but by changing

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899
ingredients come from but by changing
 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.380
ingredients come from but by changing
the architecture and looking at looking

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390
the architecture and looking at looking
 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.960
the architecture and looking at looking
at a plate of food not so much as what

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970
at a plate of food not so much as what
 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.109
at a plate of food not so much as what
we expect from our lunch or dinner but

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119
we expect from our lunch or dinner but
 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.539
we expect from our lunch or dinner but
what is the land telling us it can

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549
what is the land telling us it can
 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.929
what is the land telling us it can
provide and then figuring out a cuisine

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939
provide and then figuring out a cuisine
 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.420
provide and then figuring out a cuisine
a pattern of eating that response

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430
a pattern of eating that response
 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.770
a pattern of eating that response
landscape and actually improves

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780
landscape and actually improves
 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.680

farmlands

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560
farmlands
 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.020
farmlands
in any region are always about an

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030
in any region are always about an
 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.000
in any region are always about an
abundance of diversity those are the

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010
abundance of diversity those are the
 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.550
abundance of diversity those are the
healthiest landscapes because because in

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560
healthiest landscapes because because in
 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.770
healthiest landscapes because because in
a natural setting there's no such thing

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780
a natural setting there's no such thing
 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.210
a natural setting there's no such thing
as a monoculture is no such thing as

as a monoculture is no such thing as
 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.130

lack of diversity in fact the world a

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140
lack of diversity in fact the world a
 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.230
lack of diversity in fact the world a
natural environment is defined by its

environments and so what we need to do

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640
environments and so what we need to do
 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.680
environments and so what we need to do
is as eaters because as eaters we are

domestication is about disruption of a
 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.250
domestication is about disruption of a
natural system and and the the art in

art and farming all three the
 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.530
art and farming all three the
correspondence of all three is really

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540
correspondence of all three is really
 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.320
correspondence of all three is really
about disrupting that natural landscape

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330
about disrupting that natural landscape
 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.560
about disrupting that natural landscape
thoughtfully and with with a thought to

thoughtfully and with with a thought to
 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.240
thoughtfully and with with a thought to
the future how can it not only be

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250
the future how can it not only be
 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.000
the future how can it not only be
disrupted but disrupted well so that it

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010
disrupted but disrupted well so that it
 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:05.100
disrupted but disrupted well so that it
improves the ecological conditions and

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110
improves the ecological conditions and
 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.890
improves the ecological conditions and
functioning of nature and doesn't take

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900
functioning of nature and doesn't take
 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.660
functioning of nature and doesn't take
away from it that's really the true

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670
away from it that's really the true
 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.220
away from it that's really the true
definition of sustainability how do we

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230
definition of sustainability how do we
 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.530
definition of sustainability how do we
think about improving ecological

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540
think about improving ecological
 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.330

function water use diversity life both

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340

in the soil and above the soil diversity
 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:21.900
in the soil and above the soil diversity
of life it's always about diversity so

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910
of life it's always about diversity so
 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.900
of life it's always about diversity so
one surefire way to encourage that is to

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910
one surefire way to encourage that is to
 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.400
one surefire way to encourage that is to
eat with a diverse plate so if you're

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410
eat with a diverse plate so if you're
 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:27.960
eat with a diverse plate so if you're
cooking at home by the way if you're

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970
cooking at home by the way if you're
 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.730
cooking at home by the way if you're
cooking at home you're already doing a

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:29.740
cooking at home you're already doing a
 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:31.500
cooking at home you're already doing a
lot because it means somebody else isn't

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510
lot because it means somebody else isn't
 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:32.850
lot because it means somebody else isn't
cooking for you and someone else cooks

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860
cooking for you and someone else cooks
 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.760
cooking for you and someone else cooks
for you it generally means that they're

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:35.770
for you it generally means that they're
 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:38.190
for you it generally means that they're
cooking less delicious food and they're

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200
cooking less delicious food and they're
 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.170
cooking less delicious food and they're
