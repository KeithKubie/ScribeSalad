00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:03.770
Football is dividing America
in half.

00:00:03.803 --> 00:00:06.105
Half of this country wants to
talk about issues

00:00:06.138 --> 00:00:08.274
that are taking place
outside of the field.

00:00:08.307 --> 00:00:11.110
Things like race, inequality,
and police brutality.

00:00:11.143 --> 00:00:13.880
Things that affect
everyday Americans.

00:00:13.913 --> 00:00:16.949
And half the country just wants
to talk about flags,

00:00:16.982 --> 00:00:20.820
uncomplicated,
two-dimensional flags.

00:00:20.853 --> 00:00:23.222
Because what President Trump
is saying,

00:00:23.255 --> 00:00:26.526
and what these protesters don't
seem to get, is that America

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:30.630
is actually more important
than Americans.

00:00:30.663 --> 00:00:32.999
It's America first,

00:00:33.032 --> 00:00:37.336
and, to finish that thought,
Americans second.

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:40.239
-Now... Ameri...
-(applause)

00:00:40.272 --> 00:00:42.708
Listen up, listen up.

00:00:42.741 --> 00:00:46.145
Americans are complicated,
with issues and problems

00:00:46.178 --> 00:00:48.881
and allegations
of systemic racism.

00:00:48.914 --> 00:00:50.783
These are things
that make me sad.

00:00:50.816 --> 00:00:54.620
America, on the other hand
is unimpeachable.

00:00:54.653 --> 00:00:57.156
It's flawless, and easy to find
on a map.

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:59.759
That makes me happy.

00:00:59.792 --> 00:01:02.161
America is coleslaw, hot dogs,

00:01:02.194 --> 00:01:04.630
monster trucks and football.

00:01:04.663 --> 00:01:07.900
The idea of America
is what needs protecting.

00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:09.869
That flag has been perfect

00:01:09.902 --> 00:01:12.371
ever since Betsy Ross
sewed those 50 stars onto it

00:01:12.404 --> 00:01:15.641
back in 1770-something.

00:01:15.674 --> 00:01:18.544
She knew that America never
needed to change.

00:01:18.577 --> 00:01:20.947
It just needed to be protected.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.449
And I like to think that when
those New England Patriots

00:01:23.482 --> 00:01:25.985
took the field against those
regular England redcoats,

00:01:26.018 --> 00:01:28.588
none of them were kneeling.

00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:32.692
But now, America is facing
an enemy even scarier

00:01:32.725 --> 00:01:36.395
than a malnourished Brit
with a musket: Americans.

00:01:36.428 --> 00:01:39.198
And we here at<i> The Opposition</i>
 feel that we are the first line

00:01:39.231 --> 00:01:41.534
of defense for you people
of America

00:01:41.567 --> 00:01:44.570
against Americans
protesting America.

00:01:44.603 --> 00:01:48.608
So here are some effective ways
to reclaim football

00:01:48.641 --> 00:01:51.144
and make it uncomplicated
and enjoyable.

00:01:51.177 --> 00:01:52.678
Oppo-Tip one:

00:01:52.711 --> 00:01:56.782
Just watch the games in reverse.

00:01:56.815 --> 00:02:00.153
That way, players are so moved
by the national anthem

00:02:00.186 --> 00:02:03.990
that they stand up and run
backwards into the locker-room.

00:02:04.023 --> 00:02:07.026
Also, most of the game is just
a bunch of players hugging

00:02:07.059 --> 00:02:11.230
and then jumping away from each
other into organized formations.

00:02:11.263 --> 00:02:13.132
Oppo-Tip number two:

00:02:13.165 --> 00:02:15.067
We created this great
photo filter

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.702
over at the Shopposition

00:02:16.735 --> 00:02:19.172
that gives kneeling players
legs.

00:02:19.205 --> 00:02:21.774
Your favorite players may seem
a little shorter,

00:02:21.807 --> 00:02:25.578
but at least those jacked
Billbos will respect the flag.

00:02:25.611 --> 00:02:27.513
-Now...
-(laughter)

00:02:27.546 --> 00:02:29.382
Oppo-Tip three.

00:02:29.415 --> 00:02:31.217
Forget football, it's ruined.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.253
We need a new, even more
American sport.

00:02:34.286 --> 00:02:37.256
A sport that won't waste
players' legs kneeling.

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:39.358
In fact,
it will get them standing

00:02:39.391 --> 00:02:41.294
and using their legs
at all times.

00:02:41.327 --> 00:02:43.329
Also, ditch the pads
and helmets.

00:02:43.362 --> 00:02:46.432
Americans, we aren't afraid of
a little rough and tumble.

00:02:46.465 --> 00:02:48.534
Plus, a football
has two pointy ends,

00:02:48.567 --> 00:02:50.670
and after this whole debacle,
I'm sick and tired of points.

00:02:50.703 --> 00:02:52.772
Make that ball round.

00:02:52.805 --> 00:02:54.874
Now, yes.

00:02:54.907 --> 00:02:57.443
There's a football that
Americans can get behind.

00:02:57.476 --> 00:02:58.378
It's gonna be huge.
