00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:22.760 align:start position:0%
thought no case not a film it's
 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.340 align:start position:0%
thought no case not a film it's
definitely<00:01:23.270><c> a</c><00:01:23.330><c> book</c><00:01:23.480><c> and</c><00:01:23.660><c> I</c><00:01:23.720><c> went</c><00:01:23.900><c> back</c><00:01:24.140><c> and</c>

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 align:start position:0%
definitely a book and I went back and
 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:25.660 align:start position:0%

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.880 align:start position:0%
then we were in Ireland and I just
started<00:01:25.970><c> to</c><00:01:26.090><c> write</c><00:01:26.240><c> and</c><00:01:26.540><c> I</c><00:01:26.660><c> and</c><00:01:27.050><c> so</c><00:01:27.530><c> it</c><00:01:27.680><c> took</c><00:01:27.830><c> me</c>

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 align:start position:0%
started to write and I and so it took me
 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.110 align:start position:0%

about<00:01:28.070><c> two</c><00:01:28.310><c> and</c><00:01:28.430><c> a</c><00:01:28.490><c> half</c><00:01:28.610><c> years</c><00:01:28.790><c> and</c><00:01:28.880><c> I</c><00:01:28.910><c> just</c>

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:29.120 align:start position:0%

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 align:start position:0%
but I was starting to kind of add things
 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.170 align:start position:0%
but I was starting to kind of add things

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 align:start position:0%
and that's when I already knew so then I
 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.040 align:start position:0%
and that's when I already knew so then I
had<00:01:52.400><c> it</c><00:01:52.580><c> more</c><00:01:53.030><c> or</c><00:01:53.150><c> less</c><00:01:53.300><c> finished</c><00:01:53.480><c> and</c><00:01:53.750><c> I</c><00:01:53.810><c> wrote</c>

each other a little bit but I find them
for<00:02:01.250><c> me</c><00:02:01.340><c> the</c><00:02:01.520><c> best</c><00:02:01.730><c> thing</c><00:02:01.970><c> is</c><00:02:02.120><c> if</c><00:02:02.240><c> I'm</c><00:02:02.330><c> gonna</c><00:02:02.480><c> do</c>

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 align:start position:0%
for me the best thing is if I'm gonna do
 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.360 align:start position:0%
for me the best thing is if I'm gonna do
it<00:02:02.930><c> like</c><00:02:03.110><c> I</c><00:02:03.230><c> do</c><00:02:03.290><c> that</c><00:02:03.530><c> with</c><00:02:03.620><c> personal</c><00:02:04.010><c> velocity</c>

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:04.370 align:start position:0%
it like I do that with personal velocity
 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:05.830 align:start position:0%
it like I do that with personal velocity
to<00:02:04.550><c> that</c><00:02:04.700><c> I</c><00:02:04.730><c> it's</c><00:02:05.210><c> better</c><00:02:05.390><c> if</c><00:02:05.540><c> I'm</c><00:02:05.659><c> not</c>

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 align:start position:0%
to that I it's better if I'm not
 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.589 align:start position:0%
to that I it's better if I'm not
finished<00:02:06.640><c> I'm</c><00:02:07.640><c> almost</c><00:02:08.060><c> finished</c><00:02:08.300><c> with</c><00:02:08.450><c> the</c>
