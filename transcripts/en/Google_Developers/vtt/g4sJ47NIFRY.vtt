00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:11.950
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Oh, hi.

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:14.560
I'm just building a
paper prototype here

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.530
in the Design
Tent, and I'm going

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:19.490
to get this design
reviewed in a few minutes.

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:21.520
But first, let's take a
look around, shall we?

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:22.019
All right.

00:00:26.143 --> 00:00:26.710
Hey, Liam.

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:27.501
How are things?

00:00:27.501 --> 00:00:28.000
LIAM: Good.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.690
How about you?

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:29.800
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I'm doing great.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:30.850
I'm going to get
a design review.

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:33.430
I'm a little nervous, but we'll
save that for a few minutes

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:34.690
from now.

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.430
Before I get there,
I kind of want

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.800
to know what's going
on with these posters.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.540
It looks like you
had a Design Sprint.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.840
LIAM: Sure.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.840
So these posters are kind
of showcasing the work

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.719
that we did at the
Dimensions Sprint up in SF.

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.260
It was a three-day
event where Google

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.051
brought a bunch of
designers and developers

00:00:49.051 --> 00:00:52.060
together to kind of ideate and
come up with some solutions

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:53.350
around these five categories.

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:54.272
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Cool.

00:00:54.272 --> 00:00:55.480
Can we see some of the stuff?

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.250
What is this?

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.540
LIAM: Sure.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.040
So this one is
called Bae Window,

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.890
and basically the idea is
to keep two people connected

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:03.989
to each other.

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:04.905
It's a live wallpaper.

00:01:04.905 --> 00:01:06.113
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Oh, I get it.

00:01:06.113 --> 00:01:07.827
Bae, like B-A-E. OK.

00:01:07.827 --> 00:01:08.660
LIAM: Yeah, exactly.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.765
So you basically pair
with your partner.

00:01:11.765 --> 00:01:13.390
And then you can
upload photos directly

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:14.862
to their live wallpaper.

00:01:14.862 --> 00:01:16.570
And if you go a while
without connecting,

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.760
then you kind of see these
two circles like start

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:19.885
to drift away a little bit.

00:01:19.885 --> 00:01:21.620
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's not good.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:22.120
All right.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.995
What's another one of
your favorites up here?

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.449
LIAM: I think this
one is probably

00:01:28.449 --> 00:01:29.490
one of my most favorites.

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.364
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yeah?

00:01:30.364 --> 00:01:32.080
LIAM: It's around
self-activation.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.970
And the idea here is
just kind of a community

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.920
where you can share experiences
and get some support.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.030
It's made to serve
the needs of people

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.670
who are looking for a safe
place to talk about experiences

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.700
they've had, kind of document
their own progress of working

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.220
through those at their
own pace, and just keep

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.550
track of how they're doing.

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:53.980
So it kind of
allows you to track

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.770
how you're feeling each day,
some thoughts or experiences

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.620
you might have
throughout the day,

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:00.340
and just how you're
making progress.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.215
TIMOTHY JORDAN: It's a
beautiful design, too.

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.710
All right.

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:06.700
Let's look at one more.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.080
LIAM: Sure.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.080
So this is one that I
helped out with, actually.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.130
It's around productivity.

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.639
So the idea here is that a
lot of people, especially

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:16.180
if you work in a
consultancy setting,

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.330
you have a lot of different
tasks and project managers

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.800
and tools that you use.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.244
And you might spend a lot of
time jumping between those

00:02:24.244 --> 00:02:25.660
to figure out what
you're supposed

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:26.660
to be doing for the day.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.100
So this is an idea that
uses Android's ability

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.220
to share data between apps to
collect all of the tasks that

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.470
are assigned to you and then
allow you to kind of make

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.510
your schedule for the
day, regardless of where

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:38.552
that work is coming from.

00:02:38.552 --> 00:02:39.718
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's cool.

00:02:39.718 --> 00:02:41.920
And is this actually like
a working prototype here?

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.470
LIAM: Yeah, working-ish.

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.180
So you kind of just
triage the things

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.420
that you want to
add to your list

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.740
by swiping in one
direction or the other.

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.760
TIMOTHY JORDAN: It's fun.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.102
LIAM: So you make it all
the way through your list,

00:02:57.102 --> 00:02:58.810
and then you kind of
have your list here.

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.290
And if you want to, you can
reorganize some of them,

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.810
just based on the order that
you want to knock them out in.

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.768
TIMOTHY JORDAN: It's a
really beautiful design.

00:03:06.768 --> 00:03:07.810
This is very inspiring.

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.171
It's very material, too.

00:03:09.171 --> 00:03:09.670
LIAM: Yeah.

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.250
So a big focus of
Dimensions was also just

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.980
what makes Android
unique as a platform

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.459
and trying to solve
for these categories

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:17.500
based around those ideas.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:18.934
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's awesome.

00:03:18.934 --> 00:03:19.600
All right, Liam.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.320
Thank you so much.

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.550
LIAM: Yeah.

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.780
Thank you.

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.540
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I think I'm
going to go find Yasmine around

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:23.020
here somewhere.

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.590
LIAM: Awesome.

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:24.381
TIMOTHY JORDAN: OK.

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:28.559
Hi.

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:29.100
YASMINE: Hey.

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.590
How's it going?

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.030
TIMOTHY JORDAN: It's going well.

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:32.394
Yasmine, these are my friends.

00:03:32.394 --> 00:03:33.310
YASMINE: Hi, everyone.

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:34.990
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hi, friends.

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.010
So I'm a little nervous.

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.740
This is my first design
review in a long time.

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:40.240
I made--

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.410
YASMINE: Don't worry.

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:41.330
We'll be kind.

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:42.130
TIMOTHY JORDAN: OK.

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:43.670
This is my app.

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.930
It turns out, if you spend a few
minutes every day writing down

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.080
what you're grateful for, you
live a more stress-free life.

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.210
So I figured maybe I
could build an app that's

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:53.450
a gratitude journal.

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:54.700
And this is what I'm thinking.

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.357
This is the Home screen.

00:03:56.357 --> 00:03:58.360
And when you bring
up the app, it just

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.610
shows something that
you're grateful for,

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.910
which is rated based on
a thing I'll say later.

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.580
And so it just lists that so you
can kind of remember the things

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:07.390
that you did.

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.990
And then you go into this List
view, and this is your journal.

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:13.430
It's chronological,
and it's super simple.

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.940
It just shows the things you're
grateful for and the day.

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.991
And if you double tap
it, you add hearts to it.

00:04:18.991 --> 00:04:20.490
And you can add as
many as you want.

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:24.340
So as you go through your
journal, you can say, oh, yeah.

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:25.780
I remember that,
and I loved that.

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.760
And the more hearts
it gives, the more it

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.464
shows up on your home screen.

00:04:29.464 --> 00:04:30.880
YASMINE: Oh, so
it's like-- so you

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.073
can see the memories that
are most important to you

00:04:33.073 --> 00:04:34.070
and bring you most joy.

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.870
TIMOTHY JORDAN: You
can reinforce them.

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:35.410
YASMINE: OK, yeah.

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.780
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And then, if you
hit the plus icon, you go over

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.380
and you just type in
what you're grateful for.

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.300
And then it just automatically
puts it in your journal.

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.510
So you just go in any time
and say, you know what?

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:44.677
I'm grateful for this thing.

00:04:44.677 --> 00:04:45.260
YASMINE: Yeah.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:46.320
No, that sounds awesome.

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.174
And I love it.

00:04:47.174 --> 00:04:47.601
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's it.

00:04:47.601 --> 00:04:48.030
Just simple.

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:49.071
YASMINE: No, it's simple.

00:04:49.071 --> 00:04:50.630
That's the best way to start.

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:52.750
Can you tell me about
the other navigation

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:53.940
that you have going on here?

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.150
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So these
are just the buttons,

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.160
and I'm not really sure what
to do here, because I put three

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.320
of them each place,
but maybe instead it's

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.840
like a button that
expands into the options.

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.300
But these are just for getting
to the List view, the Home,

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:06.969
and this is a plus for--

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:08.260
that's actually a little house.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:09.280
I know it's hard to see.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:09.720
YASMINE: OK.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:10.410
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So
there's a little house.

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.400
And these are three lines
indicating the list.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.987
And that's just a
plus for adding it.

00:05:13.987 --> 00:05:15.070
YASMINE: Yeah, definitely.

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:16.300
TIMOTHY JORDAN: What do
you think about that?

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:17.110
YASMINE: So one of
the things that you

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.050
might want to consider doing
is using a floating action

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.270
button as the main component,
which you kind of have

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:23.140
going on right here.

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:26.320
But instead of-- you move it
out of the bottom navigation

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.612
and add it to the top so it's
always floating in there.

00:05:28.612 --> 00:05:30.861
One of the things with action
buttons, a lot of people

00:05:30.861 --> 00:05:32.700
think, all right, let's
add them everywhere.

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.240
But it should be
tied to an action.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.520
So you shouldn't use it
for navigation, mostly

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.687
for something like
creating a post.

00:05:38.687 --> 00:05:40.270
One thing that you
could add is if you

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:43.300
were adding as your journal,
as it expanded later on,

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:47.050
you would tap the Add button
for adding a new thing

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:48.127
that you're grateful for.

00:05:48.127 --> 00:05:49.960
And potentially maybe
then you could add one

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.220
where it's photos.

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:53.459
So it's maybe you want to
do a text one or a photos

00:05:53.459 --> 00:05:54.250
one or a video one.

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:55.840
So that can give
you quick access

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.141
to adding a new journal entry.

00:05:57.141 --> 00:05:58.140
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome.

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:00.445
YASMINE: So that's one
potential to think of.

00:06:00.445 --> 00:06:02.778
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I guess, now
that I'm thinking about it,

00:06:02.778 --> 00:06:05.420
and you say that, maybe I get
rid of the navigation buttons.

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:07.580
And the way you get
between this and the list

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:08.929
is you just scroll down.

00:06:08.929 --> 00:06:09.970
YASMINE: Yeah, you could.

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:11.469
You could, because
there isn't going

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:13.940
to be a whole lot, at
least in the beginning.

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:15.400
One of the things you might
want to consider adding

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.350
is some form of search,
because you'll probably

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:18.670
want to search through
all your memories--

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:18.860
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yeah.

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:20.859
YASMINE: --and remember
what made you happy.

00:06:20.859 --> 00:06:21.650
TIMOTHY JORDAN: OK.

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:24.111
Is there anything else about
this app you want to tell me?

00:06:24.111 --> 00:06:24.610
YASMINE: No.

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:26.860
I love that you started
off with sketching first.

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:27.880
That's one of the
things that we really

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:29.770
encourage everyone to
do, because then you're

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:31.270
not married to this solution.

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:34.150
Because you can go on
and think, hmm, maybe

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:35.890
I don't really like
how this is working.

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:38.170
Let's think of some
other iterations,

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:40.270
and you haven't spent time
coding or designing it

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:41.790
within a sketch or anything.

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:43.560
So this is a great way to start.

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:44.560
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome.

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:45.325
Well, thank you so much.

00:06:45.325 --> 00:06:45.580
YASMINE: All right.

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:46.420
Well, thank you.

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:48.128
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That
was really painless.

00:06:48.128 --> 00:06:48.685
I'm happy.

00:06:48.685 --> 00:06:49.090
YASMINE: You're good?

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:49.450
You're good.

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:49.860
All right, good.

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:50.180
TIMOTHY JORDAN: OK.

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.055
YASMINE: We try to make
it easy for everyone.

00:06:52.055 --> 00:06:52.690
So, yeah.

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:53.030
TIMOTHY JORDAN: All right.

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:54.740
Well, that's the Design
Booth, everybody.

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:57.220
I'm going to go start on my app.

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:59.670
