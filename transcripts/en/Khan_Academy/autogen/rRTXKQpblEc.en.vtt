00:00:00.339 --> 00:00:01.561
 We know we can find it 

00:00:01.561 --> 00:00:03.454
 the face of a rectangle, multiplying 

00:00:03.454 --> 00:00:05.053
 the base on the height. 

00:00:05.053 --> 00:00:08.184
 The face of a rectangle is the height of the base. 

00:00:08.184 --> 00:00:09.804
 In another video we saw that 

00:00:09.804 --> 00:00:12.190
 if we look for a parallelogram face 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:14.253
 and we know the length of the base, 

00:00:14.253 --> 00:00:16.042
 and we know its height, then the face 

00:00:16.042 --> 00:00:18.659
 will also be equal to the height base. 

00:00:18.659 --> 00:00:19.890
 It's not that obvious when you look 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.817
 parallelogram, but in that video 

00:00:21.817 --> 00:00:24.987
 we did some redesign of the person. 

00:00:24.987 --> 00:00:26.055
 We said, "Hey, let's get this one 

00:00:26.055 --> 00:00:28.086
 a small part here. " 

00:00:28.086 --> 00:00:31.256
 We took this small part there 

00:00:31.256 --> 00:00:35.726
 and then we moved it to the right, 

00:00:35.726 --> 00:00:37.618
 and thus see that 

00:00:37.618 --> 00:00:39.963
 provided the base and height are the same 

00:00:39.963 --> 00:00:41.786
 like this rectangle here, I can build 

00:00:41.786 --> 00:00:44.422
 same rectangle by moving this area here. 

00:00:44.422 --> 00:00:46.384
 That's why the face of this parallelogram 

00:00:46.384 --> 00:00:47.858
 is the base of height. 

00:00:47.858 --> 00:00:50.854
 I did not add or remove part of the face, but just shifted a piece 

00:00:50.854 --> 00:00:53.187
 on the left in the right, 

00:00:53.187 --> 00:00:55.460
 to show that the face of this parallelogram 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.159
 is the same as the face of this rectangle. 

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:01.317
 This will also be the height base. 

00:01:01.317 --> 00:01:03.693
 So I hope this will convince you, 

00:01:03.693 --> 00:01:07.595
 that the face of the parallelogram is the base at the height, 

00:01:07.595 --> 00:01:09.139
 because now we will use it, 

00:01:09.139 --> 00:01:13.591
 to get a sense of the face of a triangle. 

00:01:13.591 --> 00:01:16.656
 Here are some triangles. 

00:01:16.656 --> 00:01:17.852
 This is a triangle 

00:01:17.852 --> 00:01:20.853
 and we are given the foundation and the height, 

00:01:20.853 --> 00:01:21.915
 and we have to try to think about it 

00:01:21.915 --> 00:01:25.392
 what will be the face of this triangle. 

00:01:25.392 --> 00:01:26.390
 And you can guess it 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.480
 will depend on the base and the height. 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:29.989
 Well, to think about it, 

00:01:29.989 --> 00:01:33.856
 let me copy this triangle. 

00:01:33.856 --> 00:01:38.627
 Let me copy it and then put it here. 

00:01:38.627 --> 00:01:39.986
 And what I will do ... 

00:01:39.986 --> 00:01:41.425
 Now I have two triangles, 

00:01:41.425 --> 00:01:43.387
 so now we will have the face twice, 

00:01:43.387 --> 00:01:45.918
 and I will turn it 

00:01:45.918 --> 00:01:50.918
 here's how, 

00:01:52.025 --> 00:01:55.694
 and then add it to the original person. You will see, 

00:01:55.694 --> 00:01:57.958
 that something very interesting happened. 

00:01:57.958 --> 00:02:01.174
 Now I built a parallelogram, 

00:02:01.174 --> 00:02:03.252
 whose face is twice face 

00:02:03.252 --> 00:02:06.619
 of the original triangle. 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:08.279
 Since I have two initial triangles, 

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:09.754
 here, I saw how I did it, 

00:02:09.754 --> 00:02:12.354
 I copied it and put it here, and then I turned it over, 

00:02:12.354 --> 00:02:15.559
 and I built the parallelogram. 

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:17.358
 But why is this interesting? 

00:02:17.358 --> 00:02:20.621
 Well the face of the whole parallelogram, 

00:02:20.621 --> 00:02:23.453
 will be the length 

00:02:23.453 --> 00:02:28.388
 on this basis at this height. 

00:02:28.388 --> 00:02:29.478
 You also have the height written 

00:02:29.478 --> 00:02:31.694
 with the reverse side here. 

00:02:31.694 --> 00:02:32.994
 We will have the basis of height. 

00:02:32.994 --> 00:02:35.758
 This will be for the parallel, for the whole - 

00:02:35.758 --> 00:02:37.952
 let me draw a parallelogram here. 

00:02:37.952 --> 00:02:40.587
 This will be the face of the entire parallelogram. 

00:02:40.587 --> 00:02:43.420
 So what will the person be 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.354
 of the original triangle? 

00:02:48.354 --> 00:02:51.524
 Well we have already seen that face of the parallelogram 

00:02:51.524 --> 00:02:53.823
 is twice the face of the original triangle. 

00:02:53.823 --> 00:02:54.926
 So the original triangle just 

00:02:54.926 --> 00:02:56.725
 will have half the face. 

00:02:56.725 --> 00:02:59.419
 This area will be here 

00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:02.426
 1/2 of the parallelogram face. 

00:03:02.426 --> 00:03:06.485
 1/2 of the base - let me use the same colors. 

00:03:06.485 --> 00:03:10.757
 1/2 of the base height. 

00:03:10.757 --> 00:03:13.091
 1/2 of the base height. 

00:03:13.091 --> 00:03:15.157
 And maybe you will say, "Okay, maybe this is for this triangle, 

00:03:15.157 --> 00:03:18.118
 but I want this to happen for more triangles. " 

00:03:18.118 --> 00:03:19.778
 And to help you, 

00:03:19.778 --> 00:03:21.856
 I added another triangle here, 

00:03:21.856 --> 00:03:23.853
 you can see it as a triangular triangle. 

00:03:23.853 --> 00:03:26.721
 This angle here is greater than 90 degrees, 

00:03:26.721 --> 00:03:27.661
 but I will use the same trick. 

00:03:27.661 --> 00:03:30.064
 We have the foundation, we have the height. 

00:03:30.064 --> 00:03:30.993
 Now think so - 

00:03:30.993 --> 00:03:33.861
 if from this point here 

00:03:33.861 --> 00:03:35.928
 throw a ball, 

00:03:35.928 --> 00:03:39.051
 the length at which the ball will move - imagine a stretched rope, - 

00:03:39.051 --> 00:03:40.508
 to get to the ground, 

00:03:40.508 --> 00:03:41.791
 this is the level of the earth, 

00:03:41.791 --> 00:03:44.554
 will be the height. 

00:03:44.554 --> 00:03:46.818
 It is not within the triangle, as we saw last time, 

00:03:46.818 --> 00:03:49.760
 but also the height of the triangle. 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.060
 If it was a kind of building, 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.024
 you would say, "So that's the height." 

00:03:52.024 --> 00:03:53.928
 What is the distance from the ground? 

00:03:53.928 --> 00:03:55.484
 First, what will be the face of this? 

00:03:55.484 --> 00:03:56.424
 You can imagine, 

00:03:56.424 --> 00:03:58.990
 that it will be half the height of the base. 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:00.917
 Why are we so sure? 

00:04:00.917 --> 00:04:05.724
 Let's do the same trick here. 

00:04:05.724 --> 00:04:09.520
 Let me copy and put this. 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.353
 I will copy and paste this here. 

00:04:12.353 --> 00:04:14.489
 Oh, it did not work out. 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:19.489
 Let me copy it and then put it here. 

00:04:20.294 --> 00:04:23.185
 So now I have two triangles, 

00:04:23.185 --> 00:04:25.484
 but I will turn that back, 

00:04:25.484 --> 00:04:28.514
 so I can build a parallelogram. 

00:04:28.514 --> 00:04:31.951
 I will turn it back and move it here, 

00:04:31.951 --> 00:04:34.191
 I need to turn it a little. 

00:04:34.191 --> 00:04:37.628
 I think you get a basic idea. 

00:04:37.628 --> 00:04:39.694
 Now I built a parallelogram, 

00:04:39.694 --> 00:04:43.061
 who is twice the face 

00:04:43.061 --> 00:04:48.019
 of the original triangle. 

00:04:48.019 --> 00:04:49.157
 And the face 

00:04:49.157 --> 00:04:51.188
 of the entire parallelogram 

00:04:51.188 --> 00:04:56.188
 will be the foundation 

00:04:57.585 --> 00:04:59.327
 at the height of the parallelogram. 

00:04:59.327 --> 00:05:02.160
 But if we only talk about the face of ... 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.455
 If we talk only about that person 

00:05:06.455 --> 00:05:08.952
 here is the original triangle, 

00:05:08.952 --> 00:05:11.192
 it will be half the face of the parallelogram, 

00:05:11.192 --> 00:05:12.882
 we'll have half of that. 

00:05:12.882 --> 00:05:14.786
 So the face of the original triangle 

00:05:14.786 --> 00:05:17.352
 is half the height of the base. 

00:05:17.352 --> 00:05:18.861
 I hope you have confidence 

00:05:18.861 --> 00:05:21.218
 in this formula that you will encounter in geometry: 

00:05:21.218 --> 00:05:23.888
 the face of a triangle is half the height of the base, 

00:05:23.888 --> 00:05:26.117
 while the face of a rectangle or parallelogram 

00:05:26.117 --> 00:05:28.701
 will be the height base.
