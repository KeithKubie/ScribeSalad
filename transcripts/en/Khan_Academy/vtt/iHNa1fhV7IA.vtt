00:00:00.206 --> 00:00:03.086
- [Voiceover] So here we have
a set of parametric equations

00:00:03.086 --> 00:00:06.209
where x and y are both
defined in terms of t.

00:00:06.209 --> 00:00:08.647
So if you input all the
possible t's that you can

00:00:08.647 --> 00:00:11.073
into these functions and then plot

00:00:11.073 --> 00:00:14.115
the corresponding x and y's for each t,

00:00:14.115 --> 00:00:16.504
this will plot a curve in the x-y plain.

00:00:16.504 --> 00:00:19.429
What I wanna do in this
video is figure out

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:22.936
the first derivative
of y with respect to x

00:00:22.936 --> 00:00:27.046
and the second derivative
of y with respect to x.

00:00:27.046 --> 00:00:29.751
And in both cases it's
going to be in terms of t.

00:00:29.751 --> 00:00:31.608
So let's get to it.

00:00:31.608 --> 00:00:33.663
So first lets find the first derivative

00:00:33.663 --> 00:00:35.580
of y with respect to x.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.166
First derivative of y with respect to x.

00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:42.568
And we've seen this
before in other videos,

00:00:42.568 --> 00:00:44.344
where this is going to be the derivative

00:00:44.344 --> 00:00:46.806
of y with respect to t

00:00:46.806 --> 00:00:50.639
over the derivative of
x with respect to t.

00:00:51.786 --> 00:00:54.817
And so this is going to be equal to,

00:00:54.817 --> 00:00:58.996
well, what is the derivative
of y with respect to t?

00:00:58.996 --> 00:00:59.829
Dy, dt

00:01:01.411 --> 00:01:02.851
is equal to.

00:01:02.851 --> 00:01:06.264
Let's see, the derivative of either the 3t

00:01:06.264 --> 00:01:09.514
with respect to 3t is just e to the 3t.

00:01:10.452 --> 00:01:14.156
And then the derivative
of 3t with respect to t

00:01:14.156 --> 00:01:15.421
is going to be three,

00:01:15.421 --> 00:01:17.639
so I can say times three like that,

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:20.681
or I can put that three out front.

00:01:20.681 --> 00:01:23.188
And then the derivative of negative one,

00:01:23.188 --> 00:01:25.174
well, a constant doesn't change

00:01:25.174 --> 00:01:26.903
no matter what you do to your t,

00:01:26.903 --> 00:01:28.540
so that's just going to be zero.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.349
So that's dy, dt.

00:01:30.349 --> 00:01:31.740
So it's going to be equal to

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:32.823
3e to the 3t,

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:38.431
all of that over,

00:01:38.431 --> 00:01:42.007
well, what's the derivative
of x with respect to t?

00:01:42.007 --> 00:01:46.090
Derivative of x with
respect to t is equal to,

00:01:47.104 --> 00:01:49.124
well, we're gonna have
the three out front,

00:01:49.124 --> 00:01:53.106
and so the derivative of e
to the 2t with respect to 2t

00:01:53.106 --> 00:01:55.939
is going to be e to the 2t

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:58.981
and then we're going to
take the derivative of 2t

00:01:58.981 --> 00:02:01.733
with respect to t, which is just two,

00:02:01.733 --> 00:02:04.483
so this is gonna be 6e to the 2t.

00:02:07.965 --> 00:02:09.607
6e to the 2t.

00:02:09.607 --> 00:02:12.648
And lets see, we could
simplify this a little bit.

00:02:12.648 --> 00:02:14.448
I'll now go to a neutral color.

00:02:14.448 --> 00:02:15.865
This is equal to,

00:02:17.748 --> 00:02:19.916
so this is gonna be one half,

00:02:19.916 --> 00:02:21.844
that's three over six,

00:02:21.844 --> 00:02:23.594
e to the 3t minus 2t.

00:02:25.781 --> 00:02:26.781
3t minus 2t.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.649
And I'm just using exponent
properties right over here.

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:33.211
But if I have three t's and
I take away two of those t's,

00:02:33.211 --> 00:02:34.895
I'm just gonna have a t.

00:02:34.895 --> 00:02:39.132
So this is just going to
simplify to a t right over here.

00:02:39.132 --> 00:02:43.161
So now that we've now figured
out the first derivative of y

00:02:43.161 --> 00:02:46.168
with respect to x in terms of t,

00:02:46.168 --> 00:02:48.676
now how do we find the second derivative?

00:02:48.676 --> 00:02:51.184
How do we find the second derivative

00:02:51.184 --> 00:02:53.684
of y with respect to x now?

00:02:56.896 --> 00:02:58.045
And I'll give you a hint!

00:02:58.045 --> 00:03:00.100
We're going to use this same idea.

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.400
If you wanna find the rate of change

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.746
of something with respect to x,

00:03:03.746 --> 00:03:05.348
you find the rate of
change of that something

00:03:05.348 --> 00:03:07.937
with respect to t and divide it by

00:03:07.937 --> 00:03:10.201
the rate of change of x with respect to t.

00:03:10.201 --> 00:03:12.534
So what this is going to be,

00:03:14.058 --> 00:03:18.989
we wanna find the derivative
of the first derivative

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:23.517
with respect to t, so
let me write this down.

00:03:23.517 --> 00:03:25.140
We wanna take the derivative,

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.113
with respect to T in the numerator,

00:03:27.113 --> 00:03:29.946
of the first derivative,

00:03:29.946 --> 00:03:32.408
which I will put in blue now,

00:03:32.408 --> 00:03:33.241
of dy, dx,

00:03:40.513 --> 00:03:42.513
all of that over dx, dt.

00:03:46.486 --> 00:03:49.546
If it doesn't jump out at you
why this is the same thing

00:03:49.546 --> 00:03:51.357
that we did before, I encourage you

00:03:51.357 --> 00:03:53.784
to pause the video and think about it.

00:03:53.784 --> 00:03:56.001
Think about what we did
over here the first time.

00:03:56.001 --> 00:03:57.894
When we wanted to find the derivative

00:03:57.894 --> 00:03:59.811
of y with respect to x,

00:04:01.516 --> 00:04:05.127
we found the derivative
of y with respect to t

00:04:05.127 --> 00:04:06.601
and then divided that by the derivative

00:04:06.601 --> 00:04:08.540
of x with respect to t.

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.957
Here, we wanna find the second derivative

00:04:13.231 --> 00:04:14.563
of y with respect to x.

00:04:14.563 --> 00:04:16.118
Actually, let me just write it down

00:04:16.118 --> 00:04:17.732
out here a little bit clearer.

00:04:17.732 --> 00:04:19.984
What we really wanna do is we wanna find

00:04:19.984 --> 00:04:24.129
the derivative with respect,
let me write it this way:

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:26.428
When we wanted to find the derivative

00:04:26.428 --> 00:04:28.595
with respect to x of y,

00:04:31.362 --> 00:04:34.729
that was equal to derivative
of y with respect to t

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:38.468
over the derivative of
x with respect to t.

00:04:38.468 --> 00:04:43.100
Now we wanna find the
derivative with respect to x

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.600
of the first derivative with respect to x.

00:04:48.092 --> 00:04:50.391
And so everywhere we saw a y here,

00:04:50.391 --> 00:04:52.980
replace that with the first derivative.

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:55.407
So this is going to be equal to,

00:04:55.407 --> 00:04:57.055
in the numerator the derivative

00:04:57.055 --> 00:04:58.727
with respect to t

00:04:58.727 --> 00:04:59.560
of dy, dx.

00:05:03.368 --> 00:05:06.491
Notice this was derivative
with respect to t of y.

00:05:06.491 --> 00:05:09.161
In fact, let me write it that
way just so you can see it.

00:05:09.161 --> 00:05:11.078
So if I clear this out,

00:05:13.109 --> 00:05:16.069
if I clear that out we're gonna get,

00:05:16.069 --> 00:05:19.902
this is the derivative
with respect to t of y.

00:05:21.363 --> 00:05:23.871
So hopefully you see,
before we had a y there,

00:05:23.871 --> 00:05:25.621
now we have a dy, dx.

00:05:26.472 --> 00:05:27.305
Dx, dt.

00:05:28.643 --> 00:05:31.522
Now this might seem really
daunting and complicated

00:05:31.522 --> 00:05:32.970
except for the fact
that these are actually

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:35.827
fairly straight things to evaluate.

00:05:35.827 --> 00:05:37.521
Taking the derivative with respect to t

00:05:37.521 --> 00:05:39.832
of the first derivative,
well, that's just taking

00:05:39.832 --> 00:05:41.922
the derivative with respect to t of this,

00:05:41.922 --> 00:05:42.987
and this is pretty easy.

00:05:42.987 --> 00:05:46.597
This is the derivative,
it's just gonna be one half.

00:05:46.597 --> 00:05:48.487
And the derivative with
respect to t of e to the t

00:05:48.487 --> 00:05:50.890
is just e to the t.

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:52.411
And so that's going to be over

00:05:52.411 --> 00:05:54.068
the derivative of x with respect to t,

00:05:54.068 --> 00:05:57.179
which we already saw is 6e to the 2t.

00:05:57.179 --> 00:05:58.262
6e to the 2t.

00:06:03.475 --> 00:06:05.930
We can write this as,

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:09.749
one half divided by six is one over 12,

00:06:09.749 --> 00:06:12.166
and then e to the t minus 2t,

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:16.982
which is equal to, we could write this

00:06:16.982 --> 00:06:21.092
as 1/12th e to the negative t,

00:06:21.092 --> 00:06:22.810
or we could write this as

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:24.727
one over 12 e to the t.

00:06:27.211 --> 00:06:28.461
And we're done.
