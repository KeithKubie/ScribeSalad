00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.630
From the company who has the rights to Godzilla,
King Kong, and Pacific Rim --

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:16.920
so please, please, do a crossover where they
all fight each other &amp; stuff --

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.570
Comes the best American Godzilla movie ever
made...

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.230
which really isn't saying much...

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.180
"That's a lot of fish!"

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.050
Godzilla.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:34.460
Prepare for a movie that was sold as a face
off between Walter White and Godzilla

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.180
Yet barely contains any Bryan Cranston

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.830
and even less Godzilla.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.800
Seriously, there's less than 20 minutes
of him. We counted.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.560
Get ready for the tease of the summer,

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.850
bringing you the king of monsters like you've
never seen him before:

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.000
Obscured by water

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Hidden in smoke

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.340
Barely visible through masks

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.410
Shot from really long distances on television

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.160
And shrouded in near-constant darkness.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.470
Oh wait, here we go!

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:06.130
"Ahhhhhh!"

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.270
Awwww.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.480
In a movie called "Godzilla,"

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.899
spend 80% of the runtime with two monsters
that no one has ever heard of:

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:18.119
This gigantic spider monkey thing

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.179
And this moth who is totally not Mothra.

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:28.179
Then watch as they fight against all odds
to find a safe place to pork.

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:34.979
Take that, true love!

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.630
Instead of watching the title character kick
ass,

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.459
spend hours of screen-time with Kick Ass and
the rest of his boring family.

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:45.979
There's his dad, whose wig is almost as
bad as his Japanese.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.319
Kick Ass' wife, an emergency room nurse
who reacts to a crisis by abandoning her patients

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:57.840
and pawning off her only child on a coworker.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.229
And this guy:

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:05.869
He's a professional bomb disposal expert
who never defuses any bombs,

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:11.409
a magnet for every single giant monster,

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.800
an a-hole who keeps volunteering for dangerous
missions instead of coming home to his wife

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:16.360
and kid.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.219
"If you don't walk out, you don't come back
at all."

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:20.810
"Sir, I'll do whatever it takes."

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.379
and a hero who spends more time and effort
saving this random boy he met on a train than

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:27.150
he does trying to save his own family.

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.319
"I'm gonna be at the house by sunrise. Then
I'm gonna get you and Sam out."

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.739
Tell them to run, you idiot!

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:36.420
In a nod to the series' Japanese roots,

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.299
ride along with Ken Watanabe,

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:42.000
who's only in the movie to dramatically
say one name:

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.760
"We call him Gojira."

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.739
Deliver one cool line:

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:49.060
"Let them fight."

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:56.060
And, of course, stare.

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:21.959
Starring...

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.300
The Olsen Triplet

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.080
Discount Channing Tatum

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.380
Duhhhh

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.380
Crysenberg

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.140
and Real Kaiju Have Curves.

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.109
Godzilla. The Good One.

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:44.420
Man, if that's what his breath is like, I'd
hate to see his farts.
