00:06:59.269 --> 00:06:59.279
because every Android device is a
 

00:06:59.279 --> 00:07:00.980
because every Android device is a
preferred rate that is set by the system

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:00.990
preferred rate that is set by the system
 

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:04.339
preferred rate that is set by the system
and it's usually not forty four point

00:07:04.339 --> 00:07:04.349
and it's usually not forty four point
 

00:07:04.349 --> 00:07:06.499
and it's usually not forty four point
one kilohertz so so not only is this a

00:07:06.499 --> 00:07:06.509
one kilohertz so so not only is this a
 

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:07.850
one kilohertz so so not only is this a
fixed sample rate but it's usually going

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:07.860
fixed sample rate but it's usually going
 

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:09.589
fixed sample rate but it's usually going
to be the wrong one and if that if that

00:07:09.589 --> 00:07:09.599
to be the wrong one and if that if that
 

00:07:09.599 --> 00:07:11.659
to be the wrong one and if that if that
happens your audio is going to be on a

00:07:11.659 --> 00:07:11.669
happens your audio is going to be on a
 

00:07:11.669 --> 00:07:13.730
happens your audio is going to be on a
resampler and so it's not going to be

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:13.740
resampler and so it's not going to be
 

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:15.350
resampler and so it's not going to be
able to go through the fast path which

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:15.360
able to go through the fast path which
 

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:16.519
able to go through the fast path which
means you're not going to get the lowest

00:07:16.519 --> 00:07:16.529
means you're not going to get the lowest
 

00:07:16.529 --> 00:07:19.249
means you're not going to get the lowest
latency so how do we solve this we can

00:07:19.249 --> 00:07:19.259
latency so how do we solve this we can
 

00:07:19.259 --> 00:07:21.740
latency so how do we solve this we can
use the Audio Manager API and query for

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:21.750
use the Audio Manager API and query for
 

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:23.540
use the Audio Manager API and query for
the device audio property and pass that

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:23.550
the device audio property and pass that
 

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:25.459
the device audio property and pass that

exactly the problem not only that it's a
 

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:19.129
exactly the problem not only that it's a
fixed size so it's way too long

00:08:19.129 --> 00:08:19.139

the old days of Android back when I

00:08:25.369 --> 00:08:25.379
the old days of Android back when I
 

00:08:25.379 --> 00:08:27.020
the old days of Android back when I
first started ages ago that actually

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:27.030
first started ages ago that actually
 

00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:28.640
first started ages ago that actually
wasn't that big of a buffer but today

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:28.650
wasn't that big of a buffer but today
 

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:31.189

our devices are way faster than that so

00:08:31.189 --> 00:08:31.199
our devices are way faster than that so
 

00:08:31.199 --> 00:08:34.459
our devices are way faster than that so
we're talking about 83 milliseconds of

00:08:34.459 --> 00:08:34.469
we're talking about 83 milliseconds of
 

00:08:34.469 --> 00:08:36.170
we're talking about 83 milliseconds of
just in this buffer so you're not going

00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:36.180
just in this buffer so you're not going
 

00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:37.699
just in this buffer so you're not going
to get super low latency audio that way

00:08:37.699 --> 00:08:37.709
to get super low latency audio that way
 

00:08:37.709 --> 00:08:40.159
to get super low latency audio that way
so what's the solution of course what we

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:40.169
so what's the solution of course what we
 

00:08:40.169 --> 00:08:41.839
so what's the solution of course what we
want to do is go back and ask Audio

00:08:41.839 --> 00:08:41.849
want to do is go back and ask Audio
 

00:08:41.849 --> 00:08:44.449
want to do is go back and ask Audio

we should be using what's the optimal

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:45.750
we should be using what's the optimal

okay well this doesn't solve all of your
 

00:08:59.279 --> 00:09:02.030
okay well this doesn't solve all of your
problems because what happens if you're

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:02.040
problems because what happens if you're

that you wrote and you're and you're

00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:06.000
that you wrote and you're and you're
 

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.030
that you wrote and you're and you're
hearing glitches but you know it's like

00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:08.040
hearing glitches but you know it's like
 

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:10.040
hearing glitches but you know it's like
like wait I tap the screen and my

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:11.940
glitches go away okay so what you're
 

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:14.180

seeing here is Android trying to do

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:14.190
seeing here is Android trying to do
 

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:16.639
seeing here is Android trying to do
stuff about battery life okay and what

00:09:16.639 --> 00:09:16.649
stuff about battery life okay and what
 

00:09:16.649 --> 00:09:18.019
stuff about battery life okay and what
happens is if you're not touching the

00:09:18.019 --> 00:09:18.029
happens is if you're not touching the
 

00:09:18.029 --> 00:09:20.060
happens is if you're not touching the
screen Android goes well you're not

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:20.070
screen Android goes well you're not
 

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:21.710
screen Android goes well you're not
doing anything important no one's no

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:21.720
doing anything important no one's no
 

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:23.480
doing anything important no one's no
one's interacting with me and so it

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:23.490
one's interacting with me and so it

one's interacting with me and so it
scales back the CPU and this results in

00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:25.860
scales back the CPU and this results in
 

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:27.800
scales back the CPU and this results in
late callbacks because you aren't able

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:27.810
late callbacks because you aren't able
 

00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:30.079

to do as many work cycles this is

00:09:30.079 --> 00:09:30.089
to do as many work cycles this is
 

00:09:30.089 --> 00:09:31.069
to do as many work cycles this is
actually something we call the

00:09:31.069 --> 00:09:31.079
actually something we call the
 

00:09:31.079 --> 00:09:33.259
actually something we call the
interactive scheduler at work actually

00:09:33.259 --> 00:09:33.269
interactive scheduler at work actually
 

00:09:33.269 --> 00:09:34.550
interactive scheduler at work actually
trying to help you save battery

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:34.560
trying to help you save battery
 

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:35.930
trying to help you save battery
except you really don't want that

00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:35.940
except you really don't want that
 

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:37.220
except you really don't want that
because you really want cool audio

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:37.230
because you really want cool audio
 

00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:41.480
because you really want cool audio
playback so there is actually a way to

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:41.490
playback so there is actually a way to
 

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:44.300
playback so there is actually a way to
sort of work around this and it's it's

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:44.310
sort of work around this and it's it's
 

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:46.610
sort of work around this and it's it's
kind of a hack trick horrible thing that

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:46.620
kind of a hack trick horrible thing that
 

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:49.160
kind of a hack trick horrible thing that
will have a better solution for very

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:49.170
will have a better solution for very
 

00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:52.460
will have a better solution for very
soon um but creative workaround I like

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:52.470
soon um but creative workaround I like
 

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:54.650
soon um but creative workaround I like
that yeah so this is what happens so the

00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:54.660
that yeah so this is what happens so the
 

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:56.870
that yeah so this is what happens so the
system decides to throttle the CPU based

00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:56.880
system decides to throttle the CPU based
 

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:58.550
system decides to throttle the CPU based
upon how often the user is touching the

upon how often the user is touching the
 

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:01.340
upon how often the user is touching the
screen so what we can do is we send fake

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:01.350
screen so what we can do is we send fake
 

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:02.990
screen so what we can do is we send fake
touches and convinces of the screen is

00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:14.420
this this this and out now Android will
go okay the screen is constantly being

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:14.430
go okay the screen is constantly being
 

00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:15.710
go okay the screen is constantly being
touched thinks that it's in an

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:15.720
touched thinks that it's in an
 

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:17.269
touched thinks that it's in an
interactive mode and this is really

00:10:17.269 --> 00:10:17.279
interactive mode and this is really
 

00:10:17.279 --> 00:10:18.500
interactive mode and this is really
important if you're doing something like

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:18.510
important if you're doing something like
 

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:20.210
important if you're doing something like
input or if you're using even if you're

00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:20.220
input or if you're using even if you're
 

00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:21.650
input or if you're using even if you're
doing like a VR app and you're using

00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:21.660
doing like a VR app and you're using
 

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:23.449
doing like a VR app and you're using
sensors like you're not touching the

00:10:23.449 --> 00:10:23.459
sensors like you're not touching the
 

00:10:23.459 --> 00:10:24.889
sensors like you're not touching the
screen Android might say whoa I

00:10:24.889 --> 00:10:24.899
screen Android might say whoa I
 

00:10:24.899 --> 00:10:27.410
screen Android might say whoa I
shouldn't be doing anything now but so

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:27.420
shouldn't be doing anything now but so
 

00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:29.509
shouldn't be doing anything now but so
this does actually actually work it

00:10:29.509 --> 00:10:29.519
this does actually actually work it
 

00:10:29.519 --> 00:10:30.980
this does actually actually work it
convinces Android the screen is being

00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:30.990
convinces Android the screen is being
 

00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:33.079
convinces Android the screen is being
touched and seriously like yeah

00:10:33.079 --> 00:10:33.089
touched and seriously like yeah
 

00:10:33.089 --> 00:10:35.150

we're going to do something better okay

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:35.160
we're going to do something better okay
 

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:37.460
we're going to do something better okay
last problem is one I hear the most you

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:37.470
last problem is one I hear the most you
 

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:38.509
last problem is one I hear the most you
know it's we spend a lot of time

00:10:38.509 --> 00:10:38.519
know it's we spend a lot of time
 

00:10:38.519 --> 00:10:39.980
know it's we spend a lot of time
debugging we get audio glitches and

00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:39.990
debugging we get audio glitches and
 

00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:41.179
debugging we get audio glitches and
crackles they've done all the other

00:10:41.179 --> 00:10:41.189
crackles they've done all the other
 

00:10:41.189 --> 00:10:43.189
crackles they've done all the other
things right annual for example we've

00:10:43.189 --> 00:10:43.199
things right annual for example we've
 

00:10:43.199 --> 00:10:44.449
things right annual for example we've
got an app that's running at a device

00:10:44.449 --> 00:10:44.459
got an app that's running at a device
 

00:10:44.459 --> 00:10:46.910
got an app that's running at a device
with a you know 192 frame size buffer

00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:46.920
with a you know 192 frame size buffer
 

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:48.439
with a you know 192 frame size buffer
and it's sample rate of 48 kilohertz

00:10:48.439 --> 00:10:48.449
and it's sample rate of 48 kilohertz
 

00:10:48.449 --> 00:10:49.549
and it's sample rate of 48 kilohertz
which means you're going to get

00:10:49.549 --> 00:10:49.559
which means you're going to get
 

00:10:49.559 --> 00:10:52.549
which means you're going to get
callbacks every 4 milliseconds and in

00:10:52.549 --> 00:10:52.559
callbacks every 4 milliseconds and in
 

00:10:52.559 --> 00:10:53.809
callbacks every 4 milliseconds and in
those 4 milliseconds you have to

00:10:53.809 --> 00:10:53.819
those 4 milliseconds you have to
 

00:10:53.819 --> 00:10:57.439
those 4 milliseconds you have to
generate 192 frames of audio data and if

00:10:57.439 --> 00:10:57.449
generate 192 frames of audio data and if
 

00:10:57.449 --> 00:10:58.999
generate 192 frames of audio data and if
you don't you're going to get a glitch

00:10:58.999 --> 00:10:59.009
you don't you're going to get a glitch
 

00:10:59.009 --> 00:11:02.210
you don't you're going to get a glitch
but the problem is is that is it is it

00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:02.220
but the problem is is that is it is it
 

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:03.949
but the problem is is that is it is it
is that in fact the cause of it is that

00:11:03.949 --> 00:11:03.959
is that in fact the cause of it is that
 

00:11:03.959 --> 00:11:05.420
is that in fact the cause of it is that
you're not always able to supply it in

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:05.430
you're not always able to supply it in
 

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:07.429
you're not always able to supply it in
time and the reason the real question is

00:11:07.429 --> 00:11:07.439
time and the reason the real question is
 

00:11:07.439 --> 00:11:09.769
time and the reason the real question is
why why was your app not always able to

00:11:09.769 --> 00:11:09.779
why why was your app not always able to
 

00:11:09.779 --> 00:11:11.689
why why was your app not always able to
actually supply this data in time and

00:11:11.689 --> 00:11:11.699
actually supply this data in time and
 

00:11:11.699 --> 00:11:13.699
actually supply this data in time and
there are two possible causes you know

00:11:13.699 --> 00:11:13.709
there are two possible causes you know
 

00:11:13.709 --> 00:11:16.220
there are two possible causes you know
one of them is you might be blocking or

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:16.230
one of them is you might be blocking or
 

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:17.449
one of them is you might be blocking or
you might be doing too much work in the

00:11:17.449 --> 00:11:17.459
you might be doing too much work in the
 

00:11:17.459 --> 00:11:19.369
you might be doing too much work in the
callback and let's take a quick look at

00:11:19.369 --> 00:11:19.379
callback and let's take a quick look at
 

00:11:19.379 --> 00:11:22.340
callback and let's take a quick look at
some causes of those so first thing you

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:22.350
some causes of those so first thing you
 

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:24.470
some causes of those so first thing you
want to do is check for any blocks in

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:24.480
want to do is check for any blocks in
 

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:26.299
want to do is check for any blocks in
the audio callback this means going

00:11:26.299 --> 00:11:26.309
the audio callback this means going
 

00:11:26.309 --> 00:11:28.309
the audio callback this means going
through your code and just analyzing it

00:11:28.309 --> 00:11:28.319
through your code and just analyzing it
 

00:11:28.319 --> 00:11:30.290
through your code and just analyzing it
you know examining it and checking for

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:30.300
you know examining it and checking for
 

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:32.590
you know examining it and checking for
things like waiting on other threads

00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:32.600
things like waiting on other threads
 

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:35.059
things like waiting on other threads
j'ni calls which basically is kind of

00:11:35.059 --> 00:11:35.069
j'ni calls which basically is kind of
 

00:11:35.069 --> 00:11:36.259
j'ni calls which basically is kind of
like waiting on other threads because it

00:11:36.259 --> 00:11:36.269
like waiting on other threads because it
 

00:11:36.269 --> 00:11:38.150
like waiting on other threads because it
adds synchronization which could block

00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:38.160
adds synchronization which could block
 

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:40.790
adds synchronization which could block
you memory allocations believe it or not

00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:40.800
you memory allocations believe it or not
 

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:42.499
you memory allocations believe it or not
memory allocations actually can block

00:11:42.499 --> 00:11:42.509
memory allocations actually can block
 

00:11:42.509 --> 00:11:45.769
memory allocations actually can block
you not shocking system calls also can

00:11:45.769 --> 00:11:45.779
you not shocking system calls also can
 

00:11:45.779 --> 00:11:47.869
you not shocking system calls also can
block and of course you can use systrace

00:11:47.869 --> 00:11:47.879
block and of course you can use systrace
 

00:11:47.879 --> 00:11:49.790
block and of course you can use systrace
with audio scared and freaking out how

00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:49.800
with audio scared and freaking out how
 

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:51.530
with audio scared and freaking out how
do you feel here use systrace raise

00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:51.540
do you feel here use systrace raise
 

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:54.350
do you feel here use systrace raise
hands that is not nearly enough more

you need to figure out how much work

00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:09.300
you need to figure out how much work
 

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:10.549
you need to figure out how much work
you're doing and you can do this using

00:12:10.549 --> 00:12:10.559
you're doing and you can do this using
 

00:12:10.559 --> 00:12:12.590
you're doing and you can do this using
clock get time as this gives you

00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:12.600
clock get time as this gives you
 

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:15.049
clock get time as this gives you
nanosecond accuracy and logging inside

00:12:15.049 --> 00:12:15.059
nanosecond accuracy and logging inside
 

00:12:15.059 --> 00:12:16.579
nanosecond accuracy and logging inside
the callback is problematic so you want

00:12:16.579 --> 00:12:16.589
the callback is problematic so you want
 

00:12:16.589 --> 00:12:17.869
the callback is problematic so you want
to keep that to a minimum and a trick

00:12:17.869 --> 00:12:17.879
to keep that to a minimum and a trick
 

00:12:17.879 --> 00:12:19.369
to keep that to a minimum and a trick
you can use is to keep a calendar the

00:12:19.369 --> 00:12:19.379
you can use is to keep a calendar the
 

00:12:19.379 --> 00:12:21.679
you can use is to keep a calendar the
callbacks only log on every X number of

00:12:21.679 --> 00:12:21.689
callbacks only log on every X number of
 

00:12:21.689 --> 00:12:23.360
callbacks only log on every X number of
calls and there's even better tricks

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:23.370
calls and there's even better tricks
 

00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:25.009
calls and there's even better tricks
like keeping a ring buffer or you can

00:12:25.009 --> 00:12:25.019
like keeping a ring buffer or you can
 

00:12:25.019 --> 00:12:26.540
like keeping a ring buffer or you can
use the trace command with this trace

00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:26.550
use the trace command with this trace
 

00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:28.220
use the trace command with this trace
which is pretty cool to create trace

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:28.230
which is pretty cool to create trace
 

00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:30.379

and this is really great if you've ever
wanted to learn what compilers do and

00:13:15.879 --> 00:13:15.889
wanted to learn what compilers do and
 

00:13:15.889 --> 00:13:17.560

at the assembly that's generated it's
 

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:24.370
at the assembly that's generated it's
very very eye-opening ok this is kind of

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:24.380
very very eye-opening ok this is kind of
 

00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:25.840

mentioned that one of Android strengths
is the diversity of our ecosystem we

00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:51.360
is the diversity of our ecosystem we
 

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:52.910

things like that and for Android it's

00:18:56.420 --> 00:18:56.430
things like that and for Android it's
 

00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:58.940
things like that and for Android it's
not realistic at this point to expect

00:18:58.940 --> 00:18:58.950
not realistic at this point to expect

acknowledge that with the pro audio flag
so now we have something to shoot for

00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:05.640
so now we have something to shoot for
 

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:08.150
so now we have something to shoot for
something to differentiate and certainly

devices support that but initially it's
our first step and at the beginning we

00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:15.960
our first step and at the beginning we
 

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:17.900
our first step and at the beginning we
only had a few devices in the Nexus

00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:17.910

but things are changing I see hope now

00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:22.500
but things are changing I see hope now

in my career I'm happy to admit that one

there are some very good reasons for
that but on the on the app level we were

and I'm acknowledging that yes these are
 

00:27:41.550 --> 00:27:44.600
and I'm acknowledging that yes these are
problems and the good thing though is

00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:44.610
problems and the good thing though is
 

00:27:44.610 --> 00:27:46.070
problems and the good thing though is
despite these problems it is

despite these problems it is
 

00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:47.779
despite these problems it is
possible to get real work done on
