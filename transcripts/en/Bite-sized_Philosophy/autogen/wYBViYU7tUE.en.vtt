you<00:00:01.410><c> can</c><00:00:01.620><c> imagine</c><00:00:01.920><c> the</c><00:00:02.399><c> flood</c><00:00:02.750><c> and</c><00:00:04.310><c> then</c><00:00:05.310><c> you</c>

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 align:start position:0%
you can imagine the flood and then you
 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.600 align:start position:0%
you can imagine the flood and then you
can<00:00:05.640><c> set</c><00:00:06.000><c> yourself</c><00:00:06.210><c> straight</c><00:00:06.960><c> and</c><00:00:07.580><c> then</c><00:00:08.580><c> you</c>

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 align:start position:0%
can set yourself straight and then you
 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.790 align:start position:0%
can set yourself straight and then you
can<00:00:08.940><c> prepare</c><00:00:09.360><c> for</c><00:00:09.690><c> it</c><00:00:09.809><c> and</c><00:00:09.960><c> that</c><00:00:10.080><c> means</c><00:00:10.290><c> maybe</c>

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 align:start position:0%
can prepare for it and that means maybe
 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.100 align:start position:0%
can prepare for it and that means maybe
you<00:00:11.040><c> can</c><00:00:11.190><c> stave</c><00:00:11.490><c> it</c><00:00:11.639><c> off</c><00:00:11.759><c> but</c><00:00:12.150><c> it</c><00:00:12.630><c> also</c><00:00:12.809><c> means</c>

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 align:start position:0%
you can stave it off but it also means
 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.870 align:start position:0%
you can stave it off but it also means
that<00:00:13.290><c> maybe</c><00:00:13.620><c> even</c><00:00:14.040><c> if</c><00:00:14.130><c> you</c><00:00:14.219><c> don't</c><00:00:14.400><c> stave</c><00:00:14.700><c> it</c>

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
that maybe even if you don't stave it
 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.689 align:start position:0%
that maybe even if you don't stave it
off<00:00:15.059><c> you</c><00:00:15.809><c> can</c><00:00:16.020><c> ride</c><00:00:16.260><c> it</c><00:00:16.440><c> out</c><00:00:16.590><c> and</c><00:00:17.430><c> that's</c>

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 align:start position:0%
off you can ride it out and that's
 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.090 align:start position:0%

that's<00:00:33.270><c> what</c><00:00:33.450><c> Adam</c><00:00:33.750><c> did</c><00:00:33.870><c> before</c><00:00:34.230><c> he</c><00:00:34.320><c> got</c><00:00:34.440><c> all</c>

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 align:start position:0%
that's what Adam did before he got all
 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.170 align:start position:0%
that's what Adam did before he got all

self-conscious about the whole thing he
 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.880 align:start position:0%
self-conscious about the whole thing he
walked<00:00:36.420><c> with</c><00:00:36.600><c> God</c><00:00:36.660><c> we'll</c><00:00:37.320><c> talk</c><00:00:37.500><c> about</c><00:00:37.620><c> that</c>

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 align:start position:0%
walked with God we'll talk about that

walked with God we'll talk about that
more<00:00:37.950><c> next</c><00:00:38.280><c> time</c><00:00:38.430><c> but</c><00:00:39.030><c> what</c><00:00:39.180><c> that</c><00:00:39.300><c> would</c><00:00:39.480><c> mean</c>

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 align:start position:0%
more next time but what that would mean
 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.770 align:start position:0%
more next time but what that would mean
maybe<00:00:39.930><c> is</c><00:00:40.140><c> because</c><00:00:40.469><c> Noah</c><00:00:40.710><c> was</c><00:00:41.460><c> straight</c><00:00:42.090><c> and</c>

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 align:start position:0%
maybe is because Noah was straight and
 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.470 align:start position:0%
maybe is because Noah was straight and
he<00:00:43.350><c> put</c><00:00:43.559><c> himself</c><00:00:43.890><c> together</c><00:00:44.070><c> and</c><00:00:44.430><c> his</c><00:00:44.850><c> familial</c>

he put himself together and his familial
 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.060 align:start position:0%
he put himself together and his familial
relationships<00:00:46.140><c> were</c><00:00:46.320><c> good</c><00:00:46.530><c> because</c><00:00:46.680><c> it</c><00:00:46.920><c> also</c>

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 align:start position:0%
relationships were good because it also
 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.580 align:start position:0%
relationships were good because it also
says<00:00:47.430><c> that</c><00:00:47.460><c> that</c><00:00:48.149><c> his</c><00:00:48.360><c> antennae</c><00:00:48.840><c> were</c><00:00:49.110><c> working</c>

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 align:start position:0%
says that that his antennae were working
 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.189 align:start position:0%
says that that his antennae were working
and<00:00:49.800><c> he</c><00:00:50.610><c> could</c><00:00:50.789><c> see</c><00:00:51.239><c> a</c><00:00:51.270><c> little</c><00:00:51.570><c> farther</c><00:00:51.899><c> into</c>

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 align:start position:0%
and he could see a little farther into
 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.080 align:start position:0%
and he could see a little farther into

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 align:start position:0%
going to go well and so he prepared for
 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.090 align:start position:0%
going to go well and so he prepared for
it<00:01:04.409><c> and</c><00:01:04.619><c> because</c><00:01:05.100><c> he</c><00:01:05.339><c> prepared</c><00:01:05.820><c> for</c><00:01:05.909><c> it</c><00:01:07.100><c> well</c>

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 align:start position:0%
it and because he prepared for it well
 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.320 align:start position:0%
it and because he prepared for it well
then<00:01:08.280><c> things</c><00:01:08.549><c> actually</c><00:01:08.909><c> went</c><00:01:09.060><c> pretty</c><00:01:09.119><c> well</c>

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 align:start position:0%
then things actually went pretty well
 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.719 align:start position:0%
then things actually went pretty well
for<00:01:09.659><c> Noah</c><00:01:09.840><c> even</c><00:01:10.650><c> though</c><00:01:10.770><c> the</c><00:01:10.890><c> flood</c><00:01:11.130><c> came</c><00:01:11.460><c> and</c>

for Noah even though the flood came and
 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.609 align:start position:0%
for Noah even though the flood came and

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 align:start position:0%
so that's an interesting thing because
 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.580 align:start position:0%
so that's an interesting thing because
that's<00:01:13.740><c> a</c><00:01:13.920><c> that's</c><00:01:14.340><c> an</c><00:01:14.600><c> indeterminant</c><00:01:15.600><c> issue</c>
