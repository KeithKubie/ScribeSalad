00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.473
When the coefficient of the highest degree term in a polynomial isn't one we

00:00:03.473 --> 00:00:08.200
need to take some extra steps to be sure that we're factoring correctly. First

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.250
things first you should always look for a common factor between all of the

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.524
terms in the expression. So here for example we have f of x equals 10x squared

00:00:16.524 --> 00:00:21.106
Minus 30x minus 40. This might look kind of hard to factor but if we notice

00:00:21.106 --> 00:00:23.948
that there's a common factor that we can take out first, the rest of the

00:00:23.948 --> 00:00:28.625
function will be much more easy to factor. So what is the greatest common

00:00:28.625 --> 00:00:31.418
factor that is shared by all three terms on the right hand side of this

00:00:31.418 --> 00:00:37.226
equation. Note that I'm abbreviating greatest common factor as GCF. Please

00:00:37.226 --> 00:00:38.673
write that number in this box.
