00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480
 

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.040
Confusingly, we speak of love as one thing,

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:11.040
rather than discerning the 2 very different varieties that lie beneath the single word.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.120
Being loved, and loving.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.760
We can only make a relationship work when we're ready to do the latter

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.000
and are aware of our unnatural, immature fixation on the former.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.800
We start knowing only about being loved.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.680
It comes to seem, very wrongly, like the norm.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.980
To the child it feels as if the parent is simply spontaneously on hand:

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:38.320
to comfort, guide, tame, feed, clear up, and will remain almost always warm and cheerful.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.140
Parents don't reveal how often they've bitten their tongue, fought back the tears,

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.620
and been too tired to take off their clothes after a day of child care.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.820
The relationship is almost always entirely non-reciprocal,

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.600
the parent loves but they don't expect the favor to be returned in any significant way:

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.280
the parent doesn't get upset when the child doesn't notice the new haircut,

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:03.480
asks carefully calibrated questions about how the meeting at work went, or suggests that they go upstairs and take a nap.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:10.020
Parent and child may both love, but each party is on a very different end of the axis, unbeknownst to the child.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.600
This is why adulthood, when we first say we "long for love",

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.600
what we predominantly mean is that we want to be loved as we are once loved by a parent.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.180
We want a recreation in adulthood of what it felt like to be administered to and indulged.

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.160
In a secret part of our minds, we picture someone who will understand our needs, bring us what we want,

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.360
to be immensely patient and sympathetic to us, act selflessly, and make it all better.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.160
This is, naturally, a disaster; for any relationship to work

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.280
we need to move firmly out of the child and into the parental position.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.320
We need to become someone who can sometimes

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.520
subordinate their own demands to the needs of another.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.540
To be adults in love, we have to learn, perhaps for the very first time,

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.800
to do something truly remarkable, for a time at least, to put someone else ahead of us.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:02.540
That's what true, mature love actually is, much to everyone's initial surprise.
