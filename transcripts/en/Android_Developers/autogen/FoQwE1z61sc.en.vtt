00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.520
 MILES BARR: Hello everyone! I am Miles Barr on the Google Play team. 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.895
 Today, I will introduce you to some of the new tools we have developed. 

00:00:04.895 --> 00:00:08.780
 These tools can help you grow your user base and interact with your users on Google Play. 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:10.530
 Google Play lets you 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.060
 Opportunity to reach 1 billion potential users 

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:16.170
 As a developer, the challenge is to get the right users. 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.265
 Improve your app based on user feedback 

00:00:18.265 --> 00:00:19.791
 And keep the app attractive to users for a long time 

00:00:19.791 --> 00:00:21.540
 I will introduce some tools provided by Google Play. 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.750
 These tools can help you easily meet these challenges 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.550
 First, let’s first understand a great way to promote your brand. 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.119
 That is the developer page 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.760
 We recommend creating a unique page on Google Play. 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.140
 To promote all of your apps 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.140
 You can upload images from the developer page. 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.290
 Briefly introduce your company 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:43.962
 And pick an app for highlighting 

00:00:43.962 --> 00:00:45.420
 This way, you can be on one page 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.407
 Promote all your apps on Google Play 

00:00:48.407 --> 00:00:50.240
 We have a quarter of our top partners already 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.670
 Created a developer page 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:56.652
 At the I/O conference, we announced that we will launch a new report. 

00:00:56.652 --> 00:00:58.360
 Through this kind of report, you can better understand 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.950
 User acquisition channels and 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:01.770
 User's source 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.450
 If you want to know how many users there are 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:04.910
 Check your store listing 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:06.410
 Will be able to find the answer through this report 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.320
 You can track who has visited your store listing page 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.690
 Learn how many percent of them are users 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.645
 Installed your app 

00:01:18.645 --> 00:01:19.645
 And eventually made an in-app purchase 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.690
 This report will not only show your users’ access paths in the store. 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:28.980
 And will also provide you with 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:30.790
 Segmentation data by user acquisition channel 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.020
 Now you will be able to understand 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.292
 How much of the traffic comes directly from the Play Store 

00:01:35.292 --> 00:01:36.375
 And how much is from other sources 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.760
 Whether it's AdWords or Google search Urchin traffic monitor tag traffic 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.140
 Or other third parties 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.880
 You can see users before installing your app with a single click 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.235
 Search keywords used in Google Search 

00:01:53.235 --> 00:01:55.610
 Get the data you need 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.430
 To optimize your store listing page 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.860
 You may also be interested in tracking channel segments. 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.520
 If you use the Urchin Traffic Monitor code in your Play Store link 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.020
 You will be able to 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.690
 Segment users from mobile websites or other partners 

00:02:11.304 --> 00:02:13.470
 Now you understand the conversion rate between store listing visits and installs. 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.800
 Let’s take a look 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.637
 How to increase this conversion rate with Store Listing Experiments 

00:02:18.637 --> 00:02:20.470
 Product Listing Experiment is 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.880
 Another feature we launched at the Google I/O conference 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.620
 With Store Listing Experiments, you can rely on specific data 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.300
 Instead of relying on intuition to optimize your product listing page on Google Play. 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.701
 Text and pictures 

00:02:31.701 --> 00:02:33.450
 Product details page is 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.480
 The place where the user decides whether or not to install your app 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.170
 You can improve the performance of this page 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.480
 And increase conversion rates 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.280
 It can also help you improve over and over again 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.746
 Most likely to resonate with the user 

00:02:43.746 --> 00:02:44.995
 Marketing or product section 

00:02:47.861 --> 00:02:49.360
 Developers often ask us 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.000
 Conducting a store listing experiment 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.030
 What is the best practice? 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.910
 We think that everyone should mainly consider the following points 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.500
 First, make assumptions and test 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.210
 Test only one aspect at a time 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:05.510
 After obtaining the results, it is repeated and improved. 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.220
 You must make sure that the experiment is long enough 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.349
 The results obtained in this way are statistically significant. 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:12.890
 Please note the banner at the top of the page 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.270
 Your experiment results will be displayed there 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.680
 Remember, subtle adjustments may not work. 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.065
 So let's experiment boldly. 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:23.990
 Here is a good example 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:30.060
 Rovio's store listing experiment for Angry Birds: Transformers 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.310
 In the first experiment, they tried several different designs. 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.240
 Found that the third design increased the installed capacity by 7% 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.930
 Then they decided to make improvements over and over again 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.040
 They tried to make the icons appear differently inclined 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.180
 Then found the first slope 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.260
 Increase conversion rate by 3% 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:48.990
 Finally, they change the background color 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:50.554
 To verify the experiment 

00:03:50.554 --> 00:03:52.220
 As a result, they found that the original background color worked best. 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.511
 So they continue to use this icon 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.452
 This is what we got from Rovio. 

00:03:59.452 --> 00:04:02.147
 Alpha/Beta testing on Google Play is very important 

00:04:02.147 --> 00:04:03.730
 We are planning on Google Play now. 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.370
 Try to release most of our upcoming games 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.180
 Because we want to optimize and improve product page resources 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.952
 We hope you also think this feature is helpful to you. 

00:04:11.952 --> 00:04:14.410
 Try out apps and games for you on Google Play 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:15.280
 Help 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.926
 This way, when you fully publish apps and games 

00:04:16.926 --> 00:04:19.300
 Must be able to achieve the desired results 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.090
 we know 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.450
 Getting users is a top priority for everyone. 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.080
 In order to provide you with help in this regard 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.730
 We’re launching a universal app campaign in the Google Play Developer Console. 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:35.390
 For your convenience 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:38.860
 This feature will be launched at the end of this year 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.555
 Universal app campaigns streamline the campaign creation process 

00:04:41.555 --> 00:04:43.410
 And provide you with one-stop service 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.920
 Lets you target your app across all Google products and services 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.090
 Whether the user is performing a search on Google Search 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.230
 Using the Play Store or other related apps 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:52.920
 Or there is no problem watching the video on YouTube. 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.170
 Later in Bruce's speech, "Improve the installation of each channel as much as possible" 

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:58.280
 He will give you a detailed introduction to the universal app campaign. 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.620
 After getting the target user 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.330
 You will want to interact with them through ratings and reviews. 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.720
 This is one of the most important parts of the Play Store. 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.090
 Rating is the user to others 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:15.280
 One of the most common ways to recommend your app 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.100
 Ratings will also help you understand what users like and dislike about your app. 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.170
 And how users feel about your app over time 

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:24.530
 Responding to user reviews is a great way 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.530
 Allows you to build meaningful relationships with users 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:28.488
 And tell them that you will listen to their feedback 

00:05:28.488 --> 00:05:31.179
 To improve your product 

00:05:31.179 --> 00:05:32.595
 If you didn’t respond to the user’s review 

00:05:32.595 --> 00:05:34.390
 Then give it a try. 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:36.190
 Most users will be at 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:39.251
 Developers respond to them and update their reviews 

00:05:39.251 --> 00:05:41.500
 We listened to your feedback 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.550
 And added the features you need most. 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:46.080
 Then, the rating page will show the score sheet. 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.760
 You can easily track trends and ratings over a certain time period 

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:52.620
 You can search for specific group reviews 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.390
 Free text search in all of your reviews 

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:03.630
 I hope that everyone likes the tools I introduced today. 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:06.410
 These tools can help you promote your brand and developer page 

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:09.050
 Help you understand user acquisition channels 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:13.580
 Optimize your store listings and help you grow your user base 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.670
 And maintain good interaction with users 

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:17.840
 That way, you posted it on Google Play. 

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.380
 Apps and games will be a big success 

00:06:22.585 --> 00:06:24.460
 Your feedback helped me and the Play team 

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.130
 Understand what challenges you face 

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:28.900
 So we can develop these features to simplify your work. 

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:30.900
 Thank you very much for your feedback. 

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:32.330
 We hope to hear more from you. 

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:32.830
 thank you all! 

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:34.750
 I am Miles Barr.
