00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:06.450
Probiotics - they’re great for your gut,
but what else are they good for?

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:13.840
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and it seems
like probiotics are all the health rage lately.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:19.270
If you’re not familiar, probiotics are microorganisms,
like bacteria and yeast, that replenish all

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.990
the good flora in your gut - and help aid
your body in digestion.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.910
Every day we discover new benefits of probiotics,
so if you’re not yet convinced of all the

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.000
wonderful things they can do for your health
- then here are a couple more.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.650
A new study in PLOS ONE finds that eating
probiotics for just a month - can help diminish

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:36.790
the accumulation of fat in your liver.

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.010
Now before you get TOO excited, this study
was done on rats - so it’s not totally clear

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.650
how this translates to humans, but in any
case, it’s a good step towards the fight

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.510
against Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.010
NAFLD is a build-up of fat in the liver that’s
not caused by alcohol, and it’s closely

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.770
related to obesity and diabetes.

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.430
It’s a fairly common disease that most people
don’t even know they have, but in more extreme

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.850
cases, it can lead to scarring of the liver,
and liver failure.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.990
For their study, researchers administered
3 different strains of probiotics to obese

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.570
rats, for 30 days - and found that it significantly
reduced the amount of fat buildup in the liver,

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.170
compared to rats that were fed a placebo.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.200
Researchers say this doesn’t mean that probiotics
can cure liver disease, but it does demonstrate

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.679
their anti-inflammatory properties.

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:24.670
And it supports the idea that our intestinal
bacteria can directly influence our liver

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:25.799
metabolism.

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.549
This goes hand in hand with another study,
published this week in Hypertension, which

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.530
finds that regular probiotic intake can actually
improve your blood pressure.

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.909
Researchers analyzed 9 different studies,
and found that consuming at least a billion

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.700
CFUs of probiotics daily - which is about
how much you’d find in a supplement capsule

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:48.070
- lowered systolic blood pressure in patients
by around 3.5 points, and diastolic blood

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.539
pressure by about 2.5 points.

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:54.460
Not a massive difference, but the effect is
more pronounced in people with elevated blood

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.840
pressure levels, of at least 130/85.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.460
It’s also worth noting that probiotics with
multiple strains of bacteria are more effective

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.810
than those with just a single strain.

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.690
But no matter what kind you take, they do
have to be consumed for at least 8 weeks in

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.860
order to see the positive effects.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.950
Researchers believe that while probiotics
don’t directly influence someone’s blood

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.230
pressure - they do have other positive effects
on the body, that can lead to lower blood

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:18.230
pressure.

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.840
They improve your cholesterol, they reduce
blood glucose levels, and they help regulate

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.260
the hormone system responsible for regulating
blood pressure.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.329
So go ahead - eat all the yogurt you want!

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:31.990
And if you hate yogurt, let us know your preferred
method of getting your daily probiotics.

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.650
Just leave em in the comments below, and as
always - thank you guys for watching!
