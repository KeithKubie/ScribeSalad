00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.571
- [Voiceover] Smell perception
in mammals involves the

00:00:02.571 --> 00:00:05.808
interactions of airborne odorant molecules

00:00:05.808 --> 00:00:07.168
from the environment

00:00:07.168 --> 00:00:10.166
with receptor proteins
on the olfactory neurons

00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:11.865
in the nasal cavity.

00:00:11.865 --> 00:00:13.978
The binding of odorant molecules

00:00:13.978 --> 00:00:15.615
to the receptor proteins

00:00:15.615 --> 00:00:17.972
triggers action potentials
in the olfactory

00:00:17.972 --> 00:00:19.642
neurons and results in

00:00:19.642 --> 00:00:22.361
transmission of information to the brain.

00:00:22.361 --> 00:00:24.706
Mammalian genomes typically
have approximately

00:00:24.706 --> 00:00:26.856
one thousand functional

00:00:26.856 --> 00:00:28.838
odorant-receptor genes,

00:00:28.838 --> 00:00:32.926
each encoding a unique odorant receptor.

00:00:32.926 --> 00:00:34.520
Alright, part a,

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.570
describe how the signal
is transmitted across

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.751
the synapse from an activated olfractory

00:00:40.751 --> 00:00:43.351
sensory neuron to the interneuron

00:00:43.351 --> 00:00:46.742
that transmits the
information to the brain.

00:00:46.742 --> 00:00:49.354
Alright, so let's draw this out.

00:00:49.354 --> 00:00:52.973
So, this is part a, so
let's, let me draw the

00:00:52.973 --> 00:00:56.547
activated olfactory sensory neuron,

00:00:56.547 --> 00:01:01.547
so, it might, so those
are its dendrites, there,

00:01:03.112 --> 00:01:06.053
so, I'm not gonna draw a perfect,

00:01:06.053 --> 00:01:07.678
so those are its dendrites
right over there,

00:01:07.678 --> 00:01:10.945
and this is its axon,

00:01:10.945 --> 00:01:12.072
it's axon,

00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:15.694
and then this is the axon terminals.

00:01:16.995 --> 00:01:19.967
The axon terminals, just like that.

00:01:19.967 --> 00:01:22.576
And I could draw other details if I want,

00:01:22.576 --> 00:01:24.866
I don't think you'd have to
draw all of these details

00:01:24.866 --> 00:01:26.239
on the actual test.

00:01:26.239 --> 00:01:27.377
But, just to get a sense of things,

00:01:27.377 --> 00:01:28.840
we could also draw the

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.208
well, we could do it in a different color,

00:01:31.208 --> 00:01:32.616
we could also draw

00:01:32.616 --> 00:01:34.172
the nucleus right over there.

00:01:34.172 --> 00:01:38.150
So this is the activated
olfactory sensory neuron,

00:01:39.173 --> 00:01:42.191
so activated

00:01:43.345 --> 00:01:48.345
olfactory, olfactory sensory neuron.

00:01:48.381 --> 00:01:52.487
sensory neuron.

00:01:53.708 --> 00:01:58.181
And let me draw, let me
draw the interneuron.

00:01:58.181 --> 00:02:01.642
So, the interneuron,
so I'll draw one of its

00:02:01.642 --> 00:02:04.865
dendrites right over there.

00:02:06.356 --> 00:02:09.258
So this is the interneuron,

00:02:09.258 --> 00:02:10.449
drawing its dendrites,

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:13.100
and then its axon.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.460
I'll draw it a little
bit better than that,

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.515
its axon just like that
and it goes to the brain.

00:02:17.515 --> 00:02:20.537
And if we zoom in on the synapse,

00:02:20.537 --> 00:02:23.188
where we have to transmit
the signal between the two,

00:02:23.188 --> 00:02:25.994
so if we zoom in,

00:02:25.994 --> 00:02:27.681
if we zoom in,

00:02:27.681 --> 00:02:30.117
right over there,

00:02:30.117 --> 00:02:33.997
we would see the axon terminal of the

00:02:33.997 --> 00:02:35.868
sensory neuron.

00:02:35.868 --> 00:02:38.733
So, maybe it looks something like that.

00:02:38.733 --> 00:02:43.723
And then the, the, the interneuron

00:02:43.723 --> 00:02:45.060
right over that.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.389
Just like this.

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:48.849
And this is the synapse.

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:53.113
So, this is the zoomed in of the synapse.

00:02:55.197 --> 00:02:58.622
And the activated
olfactory sensory neuron,

00:02:58.622 --> 00:03:00.176
you have this activation potential

00:03:00.176 --> 00:03:03.626
that is going to go down the axon,

00:03:03.626 --> 00:03:05.588
and then when it gets to

00:03:05.588 --> 00:03:09.373
when it gets to the axon
terminal right over here,

00:03:09.373 --> 00:03:13.873
it will trigger the release
of neurotransmitters.

00:03:13.873 --> 00:03:16.079
So, these neurotransmitters are typically

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:20.932
hanging out in, in these, these vessels

00:03:20.932 --> 00:03:23.917
right over here, but then when
the action potential comes,

00:03:23.917 --> 00:03:28.526
they will get released
into the synaptic cleft.

00:03:28.526 --> 00:03:33.021
And then, the interneuron
is going to have,

00:03:33.021 --> 00:03:37.856
is going to have proteins
that sense, that sense

00:03:37.856 --> 00:03:39.626
those neurotransmitters,

00:03:39.626 --> 00:03:42.119
and that activates that neuron.

00:03:42.119 --> 00:03:45.224
So, once again this is the interneuron,

00:03:45.224 --> 00:03:49.787
interneuron, and we could
say that interneuron,

00:03:50.946 --> 00:03:54.192
interneuron

00:03:55.894 --> 00:04:00.604
gets activated, actually
it could be inhibited

00:04:00.604 --> 00:04:05.604
as well, but activated
by, by neurotransmitters

00:04:07.211 --> 00:04:10.800
neurotransmitters

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.182
released into synapse,

00:04:15.182 --> 00:04:19.344
released into synapse

00:04:20.514 --> 00:04:23.876
by the sensory neuron,

00:04:25.034 --> 00:04:30.034
by sensory neuron due to action potential,

00:04:30.954 --> 00:04:34.139
due to action,

00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:38.726
action potential.

00:04:38.726 --> 00:04:40.150
And this is probably enough, but I

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.114
went through a few more
pains to draw it out

00:04:42.114 --> 00:04:45.652
a little bit, and you
could draw other details.

00:04:45.652 --> 00:04:47.587
You could draw the myelin
sheath and all of that,

00:04:47.587 --> 00:04:49.792
you could draw the nuclei
of the different cells,

00:04:49.792 --> 00:04:52.149
but the basic idea is
that the signal goes from

00:04:52.149 --> 00:04:54.924
one neuron to another
with the release of these,

00:04:54.924 --> 00:04:57.260
these chemicals, these neurotransmitters,

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.837
which are actually fairly,
fairly small molecules,

00:04:59.837 --> 00:05:01.813
but then they trigger the next neuron,

00:05:01.813 --> 00:05:03.975
and then after that
signal goes they get all

00:05:03.975 --> 00:05:05.878
they get metabolized by enzymes and things

00:05:05.878 --> 00:05:08.074
and there might be a few
that just always stick around

00:05:08.074 --> 00:05:09.380
but for the most part they signal

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:11.229
from one neuron to another.

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:13.073
And they could activate the next neuron,

00:05:13.073 --> 00:05:14.979
or they actually could inhibit it as well,

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:17.252
but in this case, they
would probably activate.

00:05:17.252 --> 00:05:19.574
Alright, let's do part b.

00:05:19.574 --> 00:05:20.724
Let's do part b.

00:05:20.724 --> 00:05:23.080
Explain how the expression
of a limited number

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.611
of odorant receptor genes,
you see there's thousands,

00:05:25.611 --> 00:05:27.531
receptor genes, can lead
to the perception of

00:05:27.531 --> 00:05:29.111
thousands of odors.

00:05:29.111 --> 00:05:31.037
Use the evidence about
the number of odorant

00:05:31.037 --> 00:05:33.940
receptor genes to support your answer.

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.867
So, one way to think
about it is, and this is

00:05:37.867 --> 00:05:41.096
this is kind of a theory, here, is that

00:05:41.096 --> 00:05:43.477
you don't necessarily have a one-to-one

00:05:43.477 --> 00:05:47.372
mapping between odorant, odorant receptors

00:05:47.372 --> 00:05:50.555
and odorant molecules, so don't,

00:05:51.625 --> 00:05:55.096
don't necessarily,

00:05:55.963 --> 00:06:00.963
necessarily have one-to-one

00:06:01.545 --> 00:06:04.998
relationship

00:06:06.177 --> 00:06:11.130
between, between odorant molecules

00:06:12.101 --> 00:06:17.101
odorant molecules and receptor proteins.

00:06:18.412 --> 00:06:22.821
And receptor proteins.

00:06:22.821 --> 00:06:25.925
Maybe, maybe one protein can,

00:06:25.925 --> 00:06:30.079
can detect multiple molecules,

00:06:30.079 --> 00:06:34.295
maybe one, maybe a given

00:06:35.577 --> 00:06:38.727
protein can

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:44.720
detect multiple molecules.

00:06:47.322 --> 00:06:52.190
Or vice versa, or vice versa,

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:53.543
whoops I keep having trouble

00:06:53.543 --> 00:06:55.174
with my little pen here.

00:06:55.174 --> 00:06:56.923
or vice versa,

00:06:56.923 --> 00:07:01.923
or vice, vice versa.

00:07:02.236 --> 00:07:06.280
And so then, you could have this

00:07:07.589 --> 00:07:11.859
could lead to

00:07:11.859 --> 00:07:15.616
many combinations,

00:07:17.561 --> 00:07:22.561
combinations being detected.

00:07:22.948 --> 00:07:25.081
So even though you could
have, maybe these one

00:07:25.081 --> 00:07:27.761
thousand odorant genes,

00:07:27.761 --> 00:07:31.958
they code for one thousand
receptor proteins,

00:07:31.958 --> 00:07:32.934
and so you might say well,

00:07:32.934 --> 00:07:34.695
well those'll only be able
to detect one thousand

00:07:34.695 --> 00:07:37.057
different molecules, well, no,

00:07:37.057 --> 00:07:39.215
each of those could detect more than one,

00:07:39.215 --> 00:07:41.235
and then, and when they come
in different combinations

00:07:41.235 --> 00:07:44.867
they might trigger the
brain in different ways.

00:07:44.867 --> 00:07:47.143
And then, many, I mean

00:07:47.143 --> 00:07:47.983
I could even add that,

00:07:47.983 --> 00:07:51.225
this could lead to many
combinations being detected

00:07:51.225 --> 00:07:53.214
which would be different,

00:07:53.214 --> 00:07:57.478
different smells in the brain,

00:07:57.478 --> 00:08:02.329
different smells

00:08:02.329 --> 00:08:05.227
as perceived by brain,

00:08:06.345 --> 00:08:09.373
perceived by brain.

00:08:09.373 --> 00:08:12.864
Now, there is some possibility
that each of these genes,

00:08:12.864 --> 00:08:15.482
maybe they could be coded into proteins

00:08:15.482 --> 00:08:18.745
in different ways, but they
do tell us each encoding

00:08:18.745 --> 00:08:20.447
a unique odorant-receptor, so I like,

00:08:20.447 --> 00:08:21.898
I like going with this one,

00:08:21.898 --> 00:08:23.429
you don't necessarily have
a one-to-one relationship,

00:08:23.429 --> 00:08:26.560
each receptor could
recognize multiple molecules,

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:29.182
or one molecule could be
bound by multiple receptors,

00:08:29.182 --> 00:08:30.366
and then the different combinations

00:08:30.366 --> 00:08:31.748
of all of the above
means that you could have

00:08:31.748 --> 00:08:34.070
much more than one thousand molecules

00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:36.066
being detected, and
especially different molecules

00:08:36.066 --> 00:08:37.598
in different combinations,
you could have thousands

00:08:37.598 --> 00:08:41.344
upon thousands of smells quote, unquote,

00:08:41.344 --> 00:08:43.666
being detected.
