CHRIS BROADFOOT: We're
here today for

00:00:06.045 --> 00:00:07.140
Maps API Office Hours.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.120
I'm Chris.

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:09.240
LUKE MAHE: And I'm Luke.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.320
And we're from the Maps
Developer Team down in Sydney.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.490
CHRIS BROADFOOT: So today we'll
be answering some of

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.210
your questions.

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:19.005
Occasionally we'll do some sort
of presentation on some

00:00:19.005 --> 00:00:23.512
new features, but today we're
just answering questions.

00:00:23.512 --> 00:00:27.250
If we have time, we'll look at
some stackover flow questions,

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.250
and we'll go through all of the
ones that you guys have

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.090
added on to the Google Moderator
So first of all,

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:41.060
Kieran, have you got
any questions?

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.876
Share with us what you're
working on.

00:00:43.876 --> 00:00:45.910
KIERAN MCDONALD: Yeah, well,
I've just got the three that

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.660
I've posted on the
Google Moderator.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.500
One was just like a airy-fairy
question, and the other two

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.466
I've kind of got jsFiddle for
us so you can have a look at

00:00:56.466 --> 00:00:58.430
the working examples.

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:04.300
Basically, we're using the
Google API Version 3.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.900
And we've just gotten into using
the KML layer so that we

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:16.380
can take KMLs from clients and
draw stuff over our map.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.350
And we've found that--

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.350
it's in the documentation, so
it's still pretty clear.

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.360
But your KML has to be public
because the server's getting

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.320
KML, doing some stuff and then
sending that to our maps.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:39.460
So we think it's OK for now, but
there's not a whole lot of

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.550
sensitive data in there.

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.960
But there might be in the
future, and we're not 100%

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.910
sure on it, so we're just
wondering if there's any plans

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:50.630
for that in the future?

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.980
LUKE MAHE: Currently no, because
our servers have to

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.540
render that data center to be
able to access a KML file,

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.250
write it down, and then they
use blank files and send it

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:01.500
down to the browser.

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.057
Yeah, we have to be able to
access it for us to be

00:02:07.057 --> 00:02:08.610
able to render it.

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.850
There's probably a couple
techniques you can use if you

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.570
were to make it semiprivate,
where you could essentially

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:20.390
give the user a token that
expires after a certain time

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:21.050
in that CRL that loaded.

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.424
KIERAN MCDONALD: That's pretty
much our way around it because

00:02:24.424 --> 00:02:28.010
we have the route publicly
accessible and then we just

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:34.990
make the URL like a secretive
URL It'll probably suffice,

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.970
but I was just checking to see
if there is any future

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:39.570
uplighting.

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.820
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Yeah, so there
is one alternative, and

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.880
that's to render everything
client side, where you can

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.090
control how it gets sent
to the client.

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.460
So if you're running KMLs
specifically, there's a

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.030
client-side parser
called GGeoXml3.

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.840
And that will go and take
your KML file and

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.045
display it on layer.

00:03:04.045 --> 00:03:07.320
But everything's rendered client
side, so none of it

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.938
will serve as all three
of these sides.

00:03:09.938 --> 00:03:12.780
KIERAN MCDONALD: OK, so we would
parse the KML and then

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.260
add the features using
the Maps API.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.580
CHRIS BROADFOOT:
Yeah, exactly.

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.370
You don't get the benefits of
KML layers, such as being able

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.820
to render many, many points
and polygons.

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.080
Because it's rendered
server side, it can

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.520
be done very quickly.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.940
You've still got
the limits of--

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:41.350
so A, parsing the XML in
JavaScript, and B, adding

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:42.800
Google Maps overlays.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.630
So you come into the
same problems with

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.001
adding lots of overlays.

00:03:46.001 --> 00:03:46.410
KIERAN MCDONALD: Yeah.

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.050
And the problem's probably
not big enough

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:50.990
to worry about that.

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:53.012
We'll probably just
leave it as it is.

00:03:53.012 --> 00:03:53.776
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Yeah.

00:03:53.776 --> 00:03:54.550
Oh, definitely.

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:56.852
You take a look at
GGeoXml then.

00:03:56.852 --> 00:03:58.780
That's probably--

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.360
KIERAN MCDONALD: So that just
reads the KML, and then we'd

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:07.090
have to use the appropriate
part of the API to

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:08.730
put it on the map?

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:09.690
CHRIS BROADFOOT: I can't
really recall.

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:15.770
I think it might even just let
you add overlays directly into

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:20.351
Maps, or it might return you
an array of features.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.950
KIERAN MCDONALD: Cool.

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:24.670
I'll check that out.

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:25.920
Thanks for that.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:34.540
So the other two had to do
with KML layers as well.

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:40.880
One was to do with just error
handling and connectivity.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.630
So if our servers are
not responding, or--

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.670
LUKE MAHE: I haven't looked
at that one that you

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:49.820
posted about yet.

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.660
The connectivity, if we also
find one that actually doesn't

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.670
exist, it goes to a weird
position in zoom-in.

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:57.616
That definitely looks
like a bug.

00:04:57.616 --> 00:05:00.660
We should fix it.

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:01.970
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Yeah, that
sounds like a bug.

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:07.240
But there is a way to get some
sort of idea, client side,

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.090
whether the KML layer
has loaded or not.

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.970
There's an MVC property
called Status.

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:16.860
So if you listen to
eventstatus_change, you'll be

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:17.975
able to figure out whether--

00:05:17.975 --> 00:05:21.260
[TYPING]

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.450
CHRIS BROADFOOT: --whether the
KML layer was loaded, or

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:25.760
whether there was some sort
of error, like it

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.218
timed out, or not.

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.510
KIERAN MCDONALD: Yeah, I guess
we were thinking of doing

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:34.350
something like that, because we
noticed that the properties

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:35.685
were changed.

00:05:35.685 --> 00:05:38.940
We were going to look at if it
was zoomed right in and in a

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:44.680
weird position, and then if
it was, then fix it up.

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:49.310
Is this Status Changed thing
something so that you don't

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:51.380
have to get it into that state
in the first place?

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:54.490
Or is it just another thing
like the zoomed-in

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:57.930
state that you can--

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.350
CHRIS BROADFOOT: I mean, zooming
shouldn't happen.

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:01.660
That's definitely a bug.

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:05.810
But the Status Changed event
would let you maybe display an

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:07.710
error to these--

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:08.155
KEIRAN MCDONALD: Connect.

00:06:08.155 --> 00:06:09.130
CHRIS BROADFOOT: --
or possibly retry.

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:12.014
If there was a timeout,
you could retry.

00:06:12.014 --> 00:06:12.770
KIERAN MCDONALD: OK.

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:17.190
Does it have a Cancel, so you
can say, hey, actually don't

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:17.700
do anything.

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:20.426
Just leave it as it is, because
it didn't load right?

00:06:20.426 --> 00:06:21.180
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Yeah, sure.

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.050
You could just not
do anything.

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:23.790
KIERAN MCDONALD: OK, cool.

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:25.480
So that's probably the
advantage of query.

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:26.312
LUKE MAHE: Yeah.

00:06:26.312 --> 00:06:29.780
Because sometimes, if your
server is too slow to respond,

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:32.960
then we just want to go and
render it, so you can try

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.470
again for whatever reason.

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:36.100
KIERAN MCDONALD: Yeah, that's
kind of why we wanted to

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:39.372
handle it gracefully, just
in case of that.

00:06:39.372 --> 00:06:40.180
LUKE MAHE: Yeah.

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:44.309
But if you haven't yet, I would
tell you not to bother

00:06:44.309 --> 00:06:45.410
with the bugs.

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:47.750
The current one would
be just the pin.

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:51.231
And if nicely done, you include
a jsFiddle example,

00:06:51.231 --> 00:06:54.350
which makes our lives
a lot easier.

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:56.960
LUKE MAHE: So actually, file
an issue, and then we'll

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:57.824
follow it up.

00:06:57.824 --> 00:06:58.632
KIERAN MCDONALD: OK.

00:06:58.632 --> 00:07:03.430
So where do I file that one?

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:06.620
CHRIS BROADFOOT: So if you go
to the documentation, there

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:09.850
should be a thing on the
side that says Issues.

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:10.445
KIERAN MCDONALD: OK.

00:07:10.445 --> 00:07:15.410
Oh yeah, I think I've even seen
on the Maps API, it says

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:17.080
Report a Map Error
or something.

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:18.420
Is that--

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:18.592
LUKE MAHE: Oh.

00:07:18.592 --> 00:07:19.790
Report a Map Error is
slightly different.

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:22.312
That's actually report a
data error with a Map.

00:07:22.312 --> 00:07:25.238
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:07:25.238 --> 00:07:29.830
[TYPING]

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:30.150
KIERAN MCDONALD: OK.

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:34.000
I'll definitely check out that
Status Changed event.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.810
And the final one was
just some advice.

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:41.710
There's another Fiddle
there too.

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:44.730
So I played around
with Clickable,

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:45.700
setting it to False.

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:53.040
And that solves my issue with
right-clicking on polygons.

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:55.940
But then I can't click
on the layer.

00:07:55.940 --> 00:08:04.290
So my thoughts on solving that
was having clickable True,

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:06.615
grabbing the event, and
then re-raising it.

00:08:06.615 --> 00:08:10.200
I was just wondering if I was
doing something silly, if I

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:12.090
was going to do it that way.

00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:14.800
CHRIS BROADFOOT: So the Maps
API, if you're familiar with

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:22.435
the DOM in HTML5, there's no
concept of event bubbling in

00:08:22.435 --> 00:08:23.420
the Maps API.

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:27.380
So if you right-click on a
layer, that right-click event

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:31.140
won't be propagated
to the Map below.

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:33.100
KIERAN MCDONALD: That's
something.

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:36.455
LUKE MAHE: Yeah, so it sounds
like you've solved it the way

00:08:36.455 --> 00:08:39.390
that I think you should
by sort of

00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:42.151
bubbling it yourself manually.

00:08:42.151 --> 00:08:43.520
KIERAN MCDONALD: You
think that that's a

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:45.110
reasonable thing to do?

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:46.550
LUKE MAHE: Yeah, I think so.

00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:47.760
KIERAN MCDONALD: OK.

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:48.010
Great.

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:50.340
Well, that's all the
questions I had.

00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:56.505
CHRIS BROADFOOT: You might
find some lag as well.

00:08:56.505 --> 00:08:59.110
When you're right-clicking the
event, you probably won't get

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:00.270
fired straight away.

00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:04.430
But when you right-click on a
KML layer, it actually sends

00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:06.730
that to Google Service.

00:09:06.730 --> 00:09:10.365
So you might see that lagging
network, but it should

00:09:10.365 --> 00:09:13.010
function properly.

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:14.750
KIERAN MCDONALD: OK.

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:17.510
So that's because it's rendered
it on the server

00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:19.440
side, and it's also doing
a querying on the

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:20.960
server side as well?

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:21.320
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Yeah.

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:25.360
So it basically says what
feature have I clicked on?

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:28.630
It goes and asks the server
that, and then comes back and

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:30.210
returns it.

00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:32.360
KIERAN MCDONALD: So if I set
Clickable to False, it doesn't

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:33.115
do all that stuff.

00:09:33.115 --> 00:09:35.527
It just renders on the server,
and then that's the end of the

00:09:35.527 --> 00:09:36.672
communication?

00:09:36.672 --> 00:09:38.050
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Yeah.

00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:38.980
You'd usually--

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:40.230
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:44.072
KIERAN MCDONALD: Maybe
one work-around is--

00:09:44.072 --> 00:09:48.110
so the only reason I want it to
be clickable is so that if

00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:52.020
it has an info text on a
pin, you can see what

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:54.240
the info text is.

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:57.740
Could a work-around
be to put texts--

00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:00.650
is there another way of having
a pin and then a text next to

00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:02.970
it all the time or is that--

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:04.220
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:10:06.905 --> 00:10:08.155
KIERAN MCDONALD: OK.

00:10:14.108 --> 00:10:14.600
Great.

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:15.580
Thanks for that.

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:16.335
LUKE MAHE: No worries.

00:10:16.335 --> 00:10:17.890
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Feel free
to stick around.

00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:21.580
We'll be looking at some of
the questions that other

00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:23.324
people have asked.

00:10:23.324 --> 00:10:23.732
KEIRAN MCDONALD: Yep.

00:10:23.732 --> 00:10:25.000
Sure.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:25.780
LUKE MAHE: How should
we do this?

00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:29.860
Do you want to go from bottom
to top or top to bottom?

00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:31.750
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Let's
go from the top.

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:34.350
LUKE MAHE: OK. "Will Google
Maps/Earth API"--

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:34.920
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Oh, this one.

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:35.560
LUKE MAHE: Oh wait.

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:36.284
That one, yes.

00:10:36.284 --> 00:10:36.698
Sorry.

00:10:36.698 --> 00:10:37.526
CHRIS BROADFOOT: You've
got a presentation.

00:10:37.526 --> 00:10:38.776
LUKE MAHE: There we go.

00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:42.450
Loading.

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:44.301
Cool.

00:10:44.301 --> 00:10:48.080
OK. "What is the leanest method
for displaying many

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:50.890
placemarks on Maps with
various metadata?

00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:54.600
Loading via CSV, KML,
FusionTables, AppEngine?

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:59.080
By lean, I mean overhead
for device bandwidth."

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:00.772
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Interesting.

00:11:00.772 --> 00:11:03.560
So Luke and I wrote an article
about displaying

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:06.490
mini-placemarks on maps.

00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:08.645
And you can find that on
the documentation.

00:11:08.645 --> 00:11:13.040
If you go to Articles and go
to the "Too Many Markers"

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:16.330
article, we present a whole
bunch of different ways of

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:17.240
handling this.

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:20.596
LUKE MAHE: But really, this
depends on your use case and

00:11:20.596 --> 00:11:21.846
what your devices are.

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:28.100
If your user experience is that
I need to see all this

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:31.260
data at the same time, all
zoomed-out, then maybe

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:34.720
KML/FusionTables is a better
approach, because that'll

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:36.830
render all data to tiles.

00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:40.350
And it'll be quicker
and less overhead.

00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:43.060
If it's more you're querying
by some viewport and you've

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:45.190
got a lot of interaction with
the user, there may be

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:48.990
something like AppEngine with
JSON response that you send

00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:51.730
back, and you can just query
in the viewport and display

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:54.540
markers that's just relevant to
what you're currently doing

00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:56.170
at the time.

00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:56.560
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Yeah.

00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:01.240
So KML and FusionTables
render server side.

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:05.370
So for many amounts of markers,
you might have, say,

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:08.650
200 markers in one tile,
compared to rendering each of

00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:11.010
those 200 markers separately
on the client.

00:12:11.010 --> 00:12:13.840
On a mobile device, that
might be very slow.

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:15.380
If we can render it using
Canvas, it might

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:16.530
be reasonably quick.

00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:19.650
But if we're rendering 200
different DOM elements as

00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:24.000
opposed to one for one tile,
that could be quite slow.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:30.020
So I'd definitely look at KML
and FusionTables, or possibly

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:32.430
rolling your own tiles.

00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:34.860
If the data doesn't change at
all, then you can pre-generate

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:38.455
all of those tiles or even
generate them on the fly.

00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:42.670
Yeah.

00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:45.540
Cool.

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:47.350
LUKE MAHE: OK.

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:50.605
So that was a KML one.

00:12:50.605 --> 00:12:51.490
Try this one, Chris.

00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:53.690
CHRIS BROADFOOT: So "What is
the proper way to destroy a

00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:57.730
map instance?" So this is not
something that we really

00:12:57.730 --> 00:13:00.540
designed the API to do.

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:04.950
Generally, we see people create
one map and maybe

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:05.720
destroy it once.

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:09.870
If you're generating maps and
destroying them continuously,

00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:14.900
then this is not really a use
case that we support.

00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:16.880
It's about that, but it's
something that you probably

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:18.350
shouldn't be doing.

00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:20.430
LUKE MAHE: We recommend instead
why don't you keep the

00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:23.100
same map object around and
just keep reusing it.

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:23.760
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Yeah.

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:27.240
So if you need to keep hiding
and showing the map, it's

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:30.190
definitely better to just keep
that map instance around as

00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:34.225
opposed to trying to delete it
and create new ones, because

00:13:34.225 --> 00:13:38.080
I've looked into this, and yes,
there is memory leak.

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:38.750
So--

00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:41.560
LUKE MAHE: But your best option
are to make sure you've

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:44.100
cleared every listener that
you've added to anything that

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:45.720
was on the map.

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:49.270
Delete all the references to
the map object, and you can

00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:52.710
even cover the div
in your HTML and

00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:55.420
override its inner text.

00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:57.501
But some browsers
will still leak.

00:13:57.501 --> 00:13:59.345
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Yeah.

00:13:59.345 --> 00:14:00.180
Pretty much every browser.

00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:01.470
LUKE MAHE: Every browser.

00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:08.550
We try our best. There we go.

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:12.760
"Best practice for a large
Google Maps project, best use

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:16.720
of APIs with a large number of
markers, example code, or best

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:17.080
practices?"

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:19.050
CHRIS BROADFOOT:
Best practices.

00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:22.310
This is interesting.

00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:23.220
LUKE MAHE: This kind
of relates to

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:25.220
the question before.

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:28.970
It depends on your use case.

00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:30.820
What is the experience you're
trying to give to the user at

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:32.470
the end of day?

00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:36.300
If it's a lot of data, then
maybe something like KML or

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:36.870
FusionTables.

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:39.740
If there's not much data, then
just markers are actually

00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:41.100
really good.

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:45.250
Some best practices are to not
make your marker bounce in if

00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:46.350
you've got lots of them.

00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:48.810
Because that's individual DOM
elements bouncing in, and then

00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:50.670
we write it as Canvas.

00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:54.030
Setting Optimize to True,
because again, we'll be

00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:57.400
painting it in Canvas instead
of individual DOM elements.

00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:59.720
What else are you thinking?

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:00.390
CHRIS BROADFOOT: I
guess it depends

00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:01.590
what you mean by large.

00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:05.700
If you mean large in complexity,
you might consider

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:07.620
using MVC objects.

00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:12.590
So MVC objects are a way to
separate your view and your

00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:17.150
model to provide a clean
separation between those

00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:22.100
concepts, which gives a pretty
nice way of structuring a

00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:23.350
large project.

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:29.040
I mean, a large number of
markers, we answered. yeah,

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:31.860
definitely look at that article,
"Too Many Markers."

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:32.540
LUKE MAHE: Yeah.

00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:34.560
that's if you want to--

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:36.600
if it's just the Maps API, and
then you can do other stuff in

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:39.740
terms of using your JavaScript,
like using the

00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:42.710
Closure Library and
the Compiler.

00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:44.987
That'll look over your code to
make sure if there's any bugs

00:15:44.987 --> 00:15:46.440
or anything that
you can improve

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:49.080
performance in some areas.

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:51.164
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Yeah.

00:15:51.164 --> 00:15:53.240
LUKE MAHE: If you have any
specific questions, you can

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:54.910
add them later on
for next time.

00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:56.210
CHRIS BROADFOOT: I guess if
you're showing complex

00:15:56.210 --> 00:15:59.030
overlays, you might start to
consider rendering those

00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:01.900
server side and sending
down tiles.

00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:06.110
You can use Image Map type
if you're showing lots

00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:07.360
of things at once.

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:10.180
I've seen some pretty cool
stuff with that.

00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:12.050
LUKE MAHE: And some other things
that we see as a common

00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:14.880
mistake is, a lot of people,
when they're first starting

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:16.950
out will just load every single
marker in the entire

00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:18.735
world, and then just send that
down to the browser.

00:16:18.735 --> 00:16:21.430
So that's obviously, using JSON
or whatever, it's a lot

00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:23.530
of data anyway to send
down to the browser.

00:16:23.530 --> 00:16:25.880
You're creating a lot
of markers that

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:27.200
aren't actually visible.

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:29.555
So you can do some stuff by
getting the map bounds and

00:16:29.555 --> 00:16:31.815
then querying your service and
say just give me the markers

00:16:31.815 --> 00:16:36.500
that are in my bounds, and
then just render those.

00:16:40.950 --> 00:16:42.170
CHRIS BROADFOOT: By the way,

00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:46.275

hang out with us.

00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:08.720
LUKE MAHE: Cool.

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:09.670
Next one.

00:17:09.670 --> 00:17:12.250
"I'm using fitBounds to fit
all markers to the map.

00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:14.020
When I only have one
marker, the zoom

00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:15.700
automatically goes to 100%.

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:19.289
How can I fix it?"

00:17:19.289 --> 00:17:20.099
CHRIS BROADFOOT: What
does this mean?

00:17:20.099 --> 00:17:22.150
LUKE MAHE: It means, so if you
only have one marker with

00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:23.940
fitBounds, just that
one marker, and

00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:25.952
it's too zoomed in.

00:17:25.952 --> 00:17:29.560
What you could do is you could
obviously add an event to

00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:31.740
listen for Zoom Changed.

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:34.480
And then when you call
fitBounds, you could either

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:39.420
save it if your zoom is to high
and then zoom out, or

00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:41.420
beforehand you could look at--

00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:41.940
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:44.020
CHRIS BROADFOOT: You can set
the maxZoom property on the

00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:45.100
map as well.

00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:47.120
LUKE MAHE: You can set maxZoom
ending zoom on a map so you

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:48.330
don't go in too far.

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:50.010
CHRIS BROADFOOT: But really, I'd
just check if you have one

00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:52.320
marker, and then choose
a zoom level--

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:54.850
LUKE MAHE: That is
appropriate.

00:17:54.850 --> 00:17:57.550
Again, this is really hard,
depending on your use case.

00:17:57.550 --> 00:17:58.955
You may want to be
zoomed in far.

00:17:58.955 --> 00:18:00.205
You may want to be
zoomed out far.

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:12.030
"Will Google Maps and Google
Earth API v3 allow clickable

00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:15.910
3D models as per Google
Earth desktop?"

00:18:15.910 --> 00:18:18.036
CHRIS BROADFOOT: I'm not sure.

00:18:18.036 --> 00:18:20.660
Luke and I don't really work
on Earth, so I didn't even

00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:21.910
know there were clickable
3D models.

00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:28.955
LUKE MAHE: If you haven't yet,
file a feature request. We

00:18:28.955 --> 00:18:32.540
don't usually talk about what
we are working on or what's

00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:34.565
coming down the pipeline, but
definitely file a feature

00:18:34.565 --> 00:18:35.420
request for this.

00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:39.300
And if enough people want it, we
will look at seeing if it's

00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:40.550
feasible to implement.

00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:45.430
Chris is moving his laptop.

00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:46.680
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Ah,
that's better.

00:18:48.970 --> 00:18:50.620
Oh.

00:18:50.620 --> 00:18:51.870
Leon, how's it going?

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:55.540
Oh, I can't hear you.

00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:56.790
I think you're muted.

00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:00.470
LUKE MAHE: No, you're
still muted.

00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:11.370
CHRIS BROADFOOT: I can open up
Chat so you can chat to-- oh,

00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:12.620
he's chatting.

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:21.926
LUKE MAHE: Should we
carry on while--

00:19:21.926 --> 00:19:22.620
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Yep.

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:25.060
LUKE MAHE: No mic, dude.

00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:27.280
You can do hand signals.

00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:28.880
CHRIS BROADFOOT: You can
chat to us on the

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:30.870
side, if you like.

00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:32.620
LUKE MAHE: And Chris
will read out.

00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:35.320
CHRIS BROADFOOT: So for people
watching, Leon is our

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:39.595
organizer to the Melvin Google
Technology User Group.

00:19:39.595 --> 00:19:41.210
LUKE MAHE: Chris will try and
repeat your question, doing

00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:43.106
your voice as accurate
as possible.

00:19:43.106 --> 00:19:46.730
CHRIS BROADFOOT: I can't
remember what he sounds like.

00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:47.940
He's--

00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:50.570
we don't have to say that.

00:19:50.570 --> 00:19:52.670
Leon's using a Chromebook.

00:19:52.670 --> 00:19:56.780
Yeah, my microphone broke
on my Chromebook, too.

00:19:56.780 --> 00:20:01.160
I also broke the developer
switch as soon as I got it.

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:09.371
LUKE MAHE: Leon is typing.

00:20:09.371 --> 00:20:09.860
CHRIS BROADFOOT: OK.

00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:12.290
So let's go to the next one.

00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:13.330
LUKE MAHE: Let's go to this
one, and then we'll answer

00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:16.080
Leon's question.

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:16.770
Where are we?

00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:19.070
So "will we improve Google
Maps API for Android?

00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:21.130
The current API doesn't support
fragments, and it's

00:20:21.130 --> 00:20:25.018
difficult to include
it in a fragment."

00:20:25.018 --> 00:20:26.268
[INAUDIBLE PASSAGE].

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:32.910
Does that work on the Android
Maps API, the Android team?

00:20:32.910 --> 00:20:34.130
We could join one of
their Hangouts.

00:20:34.130 --> 00:20:36.780
I hear they do them once a
week, I think, as well.

00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:38.880
And you can ask them that,
and they'll have

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:41.270
better answers for you.

00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:43.210
CHRIS BROADFOOT: So
Leon is saying--

00:20:43.210 --> 00:20:45.060
oh, here's a better idea
about 3D models.

00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:48.550
He says "the person
was referring to

00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:52.010
Android and--" ah, right.

00:20:52.010 --> 00:20:52.700
Ah, right.

00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:55.980
So our buildings
that come out.

00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:56.950
LUKE MAHE: Oh, right.

00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:59.740
When you're in--

00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:01.520
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Yeah, I mean,
again, we can't really talk

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:03.010
about future plans.

00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:06.045
But that's something that
I'd really like to see.

00:21:06.045 --> 00:21:11.230
Now that we have pretty good
WebGL support, if we can start

00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:14.080
getting those 3D models down to
the API as well, that would

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:16.000
be brilliant.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.290
LUKE MAHE: File a feature
request, so we know how many

00:21:18.290 --> 00:21:19.540
people actually want it.

00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:27.130
CHRIS BROADFOOT: So Leon says,
"so can we--" wait.

00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:30.068
That doesn't make sense, Leon.

00:21:30.068 --> 00:21:35.761
"Can we build 3D models
using this?"

00:21:35.761 --> 00:21:38.000
LUKE MAHE: That would be cool,
if you could build a 3D model

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.230
and throw it into jsmaps.

00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:41.610
CHRIS BROADFOOT: OK.

00:21:41.610 --> 00:21:44.720
Let's go to the next one.

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:46.250
CHRIS BROADFOOT: So, "will you
improve Google Maps--"

00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:48.890
LUKE MAHE: That was
the second one.

00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:50.840
CHRIS BROADFOOT: "We've
developed a historical mapping

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:54.660
app using the deprecated Maps
API for Flash and like the 3D

00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:56.210
effects for visualization.

00:21:56.210 --> 00:21:58.500
Are there plans to enable 3D
effects in the future for

00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:04.600
JavaScript v3 API?" Not that
I'm aware of, although it's

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:08.080
certainly possible
with the new 3D

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:09.330
acceleration in browsers.

00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:14.550
So yeah, it's definitely
something we

00:22:14.550 --> 00:22:17.620
should take a look at.

00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:20.020
File a feature request.

00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:20.823
LUKE MAHE: That saves a bit--

00:22:20.823 --> 00:22:23.250
that should just be the subject
of this thing, "File a

00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:24.705
feature request."

00:22:24.705 --> 00:22:26.240
TOM: Hey, guys.

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:26.635
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Hey.

00:22:26.635 --> 00:22:27.030
LUKE MAHE: Hello.

00:22:27.030 --> 00:22:28.420
TOM: Sorry I'm late.

00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:32.396
We got caught up in
a furious meeting.

00:22:32.396 --> 00:22:34.150
I just ran over.

00:22:34.150 --> 00:22:37.790
CHRIS BROADFOOT: So for people
watching, Tom is a developer

00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:38.830
here in Sydney.

00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:40.340
He's working on GoCatch.

00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:43.380
LUKE MAHE: Which is a pretty
cool Android/iPhone app, where

00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:47.060
you can find a taxi, and it
will come pick you up.

00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:47.810
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Yeah.

00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:49.700
So they're doing some pretty
cool things with Maps.

00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:53.370
We had a look this morning,
had a chat to

00:22:53.370 --> 00:22:54.660
them, which is great.

00:22:57.582 --> 00:23:00.810
LUKE MAHE: You got any questions
for us, Tom?

00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:02.200
TOM: No, I don't actually,
I was just going to--

00:23:06.790 --> 00:23:07.200
CHRIS BROADFOOT: All right.

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:08.090
We've lost Tom.

00:23:08.090 --> 00:23:10.740
LUKE MAHE: We did lose Tom.

00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:11.010
CHRIS BROADFOOT: It's OK.

00:23:11.010 --> 00:23:12.460
He got his two minutes
of fame.

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:16.810
LUKE MAHE: Have we lost
Leon as well?

00:23:19.164 --> 00:23:21.610
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Is my
laptop not working?

00:23:21.610 --> 00:23:23.925
No, see, I've got you.

00:23:23.925 --> 00:23:25.070
Oh, Leon's still here.

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:26.350
OK, Leon, you're frozen.

00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:27.910
Tom, you're frozen.

00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:28.350
OK.

00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:29.405
Let's go to the next one.

00:23:29.405 --> 00:23:30.995
LUKE MAHE: OK.

00:23:30.995 --> 00:23:32.020
Do you want to read
the last one?

00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:35.550
CHRIS BROADFOOT: "Will Google
API v3 wrongly change again

00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:38.730
streets and location
Catalan's name?"

00:23:38.730 --> 00:23:43.930
LUKE MAHE: I think it means that
we've changed the name.

00:23:43.930 --> 00:23:47.890
On Maps will it come, and will
it also change in v3?

00:23:47.890 --> 00:23:52.130
CHRIS BROADFOOT: So the
locations we show in the Maps

00:23:52.130 --> 00:23:56.350
API are the same as the ones
on maps.google.com.

00:23:56.350 --> 00:23:59.510
So if you ever see a problem,
go down to the bottom right

00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:01.680
and hit Report a Map Error.

00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:05.610
And there's a really great team
working behind that to

00:24:05.610 --> 00:24:06.735
resolve issues.

00:24:06.735 --> 00:24:09.810
LUKE MAHE: We should also
mention out here that you can

00:24:09.810 --> 00:24:12.660
load the API in different
languages.

00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:16.940
So I'm not sure what the problem
actually was, but if

00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:20.280
we are showing you an English
version of it instead of

00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:22.774
Spanish or Catalonian--

00:24:22.774 --> 00:24:24.030
yep?

00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:24.200
Good.

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:27.780
The producer just told
me I said it right--

00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:30.390
that you can load the API
in that language.

00:24:30.390 --> 00:24:35.220
And you will probably see the
tiles in the correct way that

00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:36.680
you want them to.

00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:38.070
But if it is--

00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:41.145
CHRIS BROADFOOT: So load with
the Catalan localization.

00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:50.270
So Leon's asking about
optimization and lean

00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:52.470
techniques.

00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:56.090
He says, "the produced case
might be to Glocate user,

00:24:56.090 --> 00:25:02.050
create a server with map bounds,
and return some JSON."

00:25:02.050 --> 00:25:05.110
So this is a technique described
in that "Too Many

00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:07.030
Markers" article.

00:25:07.030 --> 00:25:09.500
And yeah, it's definitely
a way to go.

00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:11.310
LUKE MAHE: It's quite a common
way to do it, and that's quite

00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:14.170
a speedy way of doing it.

00:25:14.170 --> 00:25:16.930
CHRIS BROADFOOT: So you
want to avoid querying

00:25:16.930 --> 00:25:18.940
the server too often.

00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:23.300
So we've actually solved this
in the API by providing an

00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:26.790
Idle event, which basically
tells you whenever the user

00:25:26.790 --> 00:25:31.090
has stopped moving the map and
whenever they likely want to

00:25:31.090 --> 00:25:32.540
see some updated data.

00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:34.300
LUKE MAHE: Another option is
to just listen to the Bound

00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:36.156
Change event and
have a window--

00:25:36.156 --> 00:25:37.445
[TOM SNEEZES]

00:25:37.445 --> 00:25:38.185
LUKE MAHE: Bless you.

00:25:38.185 --> 00:25:41.970
But you have a window timeout
that you clear

00:25:41.970 --> 00:25:42.800
every time it's updated.

00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:45.720
And then if the bounce doesn't
change or a timeout expired,

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:47.640
then that person does your
iaddress period.

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:50.740
And then you can do some nice
things, where you go get your

00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:52.960
results back. and maybe
the user's only

00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:54.280
panned half a screen.

00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:56.662
So you also don't want to get
rid of the markers that are

00:25:56.662 --> 00:25:57.210
already on the screen.

00:25:57.210 --> 00:26:00.250
So if that person's got a
passion to go, is our marker

00:26:00.250 --> 00:26:01.170
already on the screen?

00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:03.210
If it is, I don't want to take
it off and put it on because

00:26:03.210 --> 00:26:05.690
it might actually be Flash
and other stuff.

00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:07.760
So that's sort of a nice
way to improve it.

00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:18.230
CHRIS BROADFOOT: So that's
what we've got.

00:26:21.545 --> 00:26:23.920
You guys on the Hangout
now-- oh, Leon's

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:25.840
got some more questions.

00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:29.490
"Have you seen any demo apps
with the Places Events API?"

00:26:29.490 --> 00:26:32.886
So the Places Events
API is quite new.

00:26:32.886 --> 00:26:33.380
LUKE MAHE: Yeah.

00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:36.890
We actually haven't seen any.

00:26:36.890 --> 00:26:38.770
But I'd love to see
some, actually.

00:26:38.770 --> 00:26:42.500
It'd be cool to see how people
are actually using that.

00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:45.650
The problem with the Places API
is, because it's mainly

00:26:45.650 --> 00:26:47.370
server side, it's really
hard to demo.

00:26:51.170 --> 00:26:54.600
We did have a Places Hangout
last week that is on YouTube,

00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:56.070
if you guys want to
go check it out.

00:26:56.070 --> 00:27:01.010
It was with Places TL, and they
had some stuff with that.

00:27:04.170 --> 00:27:05.210
And Kieran went and
filed a bug.

00:27:05.210 --> 00:27:06.460
Good hunting, Kieran.

00:27:09.786 --> 00:27:11.200
CHRIS BROADFOOT: The engineers
will be happy.

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:11.900
They love bugs.

00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:13.150
LUKE MAHE: They do.

00:27:19.234 --> 00:27:22.533
CHRIS BROADFOOT: So Tom, have
you got any comments?

00:27:25.450 --> 00:27:28.415
TOM: Yeah, I'm sorry.

00:27:28.415 --> 00:27:31.320
I lost my connection up there.

00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:34.800
Yeah I was just tuning
in to see what people

00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:36.480
were talking about.

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:39.670
So I don't have anything
specific I didn't talk to you

00:27:39.670 --> 00:27:42.580
about this morning.

00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:44.950
It's interesting about the
Places Events stuff.

00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:50.240
That's a brand new API.

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:50.520
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Yeah.

00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:54.670
So if you're interested in the
Places Events API, definitely

00:27:54.670 --> 00:27:58.370
go back and watch last
week's Hangout.

00:27:58.370 --> 00:28:01.800
I think they did a quick run
through of the Places API and

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:06.680
the new Events API.

00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:09.420
Essentially people can
check into events--

00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:12.420
LUKE MAHE: It's basically
temporary Places, so you don't

00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:16.210
pollute your event space with
the events or places that are

00:28:16.210 --> 00:28:17.620
no longer useful.

00:28:17.620 --> 00:28:19.520
So if there's like South
by Southwest--

00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:22.160
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:23.790
LUKE MAHE: --so you don't really
want that line to exist

00:28:23.790 --> 00:28:25.040
for another week.

00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:31.266
CHRIS BROADFOOT: So let's
go over to Steve.

00:28:31.266 --> 00:28:34.640
STEVE: Hey, guys.

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:36.480
Hey, I don't really have
any questions.

00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:40.290
I was just more kind of
popping in, as I do.

00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:41.540
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:49.630
LUKE MAHE: To jQuery or not to
jQuery for the mobile apps.

00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:50.580
What are your thoughts?

00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:51.490
STEVE: Whoa.

00:28:51.490 --> 00:28:52.610
Interesting question.

00:28:52.610 --> 00:28:54.730
LUKE MAHE: It is a very
interesting question.

00:28:54.730 --> 00:28:55.750
jQuery is cool.

00:28:55.750 --> 00:29:00.880
It solves a lot of annoying code
you have to write for a

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:02.530
lot of browsers.

00:29:02.530 --> 00:29:04.570
It can get a little
bloated, depending

00:29:04.570 --> 00:29:05.830
on what you're doing.

00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:08.880
You may have some specific tasks
where jQuery is trying

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:10.650
to solve too much
of the use case.

00:29:10.650 --> 00:29:12.470
But generally, I'd say if
you're going to use a

00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:14.820
framework, jQuery's up there
with one of the good ones.

00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:16.070
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Yeah.

00:29:17.650 --> 00:29:21.350
My advice would be to
use it selectively.

00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:21.790
LUKE MAHE: Yeah.

00:29:21.790 --> 00:29:24.590
It is about, I think,
107K or something.

00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:27.750
I could be completely
wrong, but--

00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:31.280
downloading that on a mobile
phone, if you're maybe

00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:33.820
somewhere in a country that
doesn't have great mobile

00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:36.050
data, that's some time.

00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:40.430
STEVE: I think a good use case,
if you're using jQuery

00:29:40.430 --> 00:29:42.430
is where you're using it
elsewhere as well.

00:29:42.430 --> 00:29:45.850
So like, Doug uses it just
specifically for your Maps.

00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:46.290
LUKE MAHE: Yeah, totally.

00:29:46.290 --> 00:29:50.340
Because if you're using just a
Maps API and most of the stuff

00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:53.470
you're doing is essentially
events, the Maps API provides

00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:56.780
an addListener and
addDomListener.

00:29:56.780 --> 00:29:58.390
And most of time,
people are just

00:29:58.390 --> 00:30:01.140
using events and selectors.

00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:03.990
So also your modern browsers,
especially in the mobile, have

00:30:03.990 --> 00:30:05.190
query selector.

00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:08.610
So using that and the Maps API
events, you really don't need

00:30:08.610 --> 00:30:10.350
jQuery for a lot of your
stuff anymore.

00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:13.140
And then CSS animations
is now remote as well.

00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:15.530
CHRIS BROADFOOT: If you want
the selector engine behind

00:30:15.530 --> 00:30:17.830
jQuery, you can use that
separately as well.

00:30:17.830 --> 00:30:18.010
LUKE MAHE: It's called Sizzle.

00:30:18.010 --> 00:30:19.600
CHRIS BROADFOOT: It's
called Sizzle.

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:20.940
So that's great.

00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:23.790
If that and events is basically
all you're doing,

00:30:23.790 --> 00:30:27.380
then you can use the Maps
API and Sizzle to--

00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:27.530
LUKE MAHE: Yeah.

00:30:27.530 --> 00:30:30.030
And they also have made
it JSON parsing now.

00:30:30.030 --> 00:30:30.320
CHRIS BROADFOOT: Oh.

00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:33.530
And Kieran's saying you
can use Zepto as well.

00:30:33.530 --> 00:30:35.300
So Zepto is pretty
lightweight.

00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:38.670
I think it's under 10K or
something like that.

00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:39.640
LUKE MAHE: So yeah.

00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:42.160
Again, it depends on
your use case.

00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:44.713
If you need everything that
jQuery has to offer and you're

00:30:44.713 --> 00:30:45.950
going to use it all,
then go for it.

00:30:45.950 --> 00:30:46.960
It's a really great library.

00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:49.840
If you don't, then maybe look
at something that only has

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:51.090
what you need.

00:30:55.150 --> 00:30:56.605
See, everyone nodding.

00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:01.860
Yeah.

00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:02.830
I like Node.js.

00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:06.000
The Chrome guys love Node.js.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.950
Go talk to Eric about Node.js.

00:31:09.950 --> 00:31:13.360
CHRIS BROADFOOT: So what
else should we do?

00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:13.862
LUKE MAHE: I don't know.

00:31:13.862 --> 00:31:16.965
Do you have anything cool
to show people?

00:31:16.965 --> 00:31:17.880
CHRIS BROADFOOT: I do not.

00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:18.810
Not this week.

00:31:18.810 --> 00:31:21.690
Maybe next week.

00:31:21.690 --> 00:31:23.910
LUKE MAHE: Does anyone got any
suggestions for a theme that

00:31:23.910 --> 00:31:26.240
we should do for the next one?

00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:31.098
Has anyone been wanting
something really cool, or you

00:31:31.098 --> 00:31:33.150
got any really crazy
questions?

00:31:33.150 --> 00:31:37.620
STEVE: Did you guys demo OpenGL
or WebGL last week?

00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:39.410
Or last month?

00:31:39.410 --> 00:31:39.790
LUKE MAHE: No.

00:31:39.790 --> 00:31:44.260
CHRIS BROADFOOT: So I
did a talk at CJS on

00:31:44.260 --> 00:31:46.680
WebSocket and WebGL.

00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:49.750
So maybe I'll demo that
in the next Hangout.

00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:51.968
That might be a bit of fun.

00:31:51.968 --> 00:31:53.330
We can do a bit of a--

00:31:53.330 --> 00:31:57.980
maybe a visualization-themed
Hangout, something like that?

00:31:57.980 --> 00:32:00.022
LUKE MAHE: Yeah.

00:32:00.022 --> 00:32:02.556
STEVE: Maybe get Anthony and
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] to show off

00:32:02.556 --> 00:32:05.105
some of the crisis mapping.

00:32:05.105 --> 00:32:08.380
CHRIS BROADFOOT: All right.

00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:12.340
So visualization's
a great topic.

00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:15.470
TOM: I wonder if we can get
you some of that data--

00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:16.720
[INAUDIBLE  PASSAGE].
