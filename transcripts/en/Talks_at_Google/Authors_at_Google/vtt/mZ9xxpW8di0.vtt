&gt;&gt; CATHERINE: Hi, everyone. Thank you so much
for coming to our authors@talk today on the

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:50.350
Civil War as you should have collected it.
I'm very happy to introduce a very good friend

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:57.440
of mine, Christopher Oates. We went to college
and graduate school together. Chris graduated

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:07.979
magna cum laude from Brown with a degree in
political science and classics in 2007, earned

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:14.380
a master's degree in International Relations
from Oxford and he's currently working at

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:23.710
his PhD at Oxford. He's here now to talk to
you about the Civil War. In 2007, he published

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:32.939
his first book, Fighting for Home: The story
of Alfred K. Oates &amp; the 5th Regiment. It's

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:41.630
also fabricated by his great, great, great
grandfather's experience in the Civil War.

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.700
Here is Chris Oates.
&gt;&gt; OATES: So thanks, Catherine. Thanks all

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:50.340
you guys for coming here, for taking time
out of your day. And I guess, if you're watching

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:57.670
this online. Thanks for, you know, procrastinating
with us. I'm here to tell you very quickly,

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:04.429
I've got about 45 minutes, the Civil War as
you should have learned it, I think you'll

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:11.900
find it as much more important thing than
you're ever were taught in school and I can

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:18.570
guarantee that you'll probably more entertained
than you're ever were in school. And I'm also--I'm

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:27.570
here also because I wanted to sell books.
I'll just lay-up my cards. I got some books

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:33.510
in the back, then, I've got a website fightingforhome.blogspot.com.
So, if you're watching this, there should

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:44.390
be a link over here, that little info box.
And the way it got started is that it is my--it's

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:50.730
largely based on letters from my great, great,
great grandfather. He came from England when

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:57.140
he was 12, signed up for the Union army when
he's 25, wrote a bunch of letters home, and

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:05.250
then about a hundred of those have been saved.
And when I was 11 years old, I can still remember

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:13.780
this. I was coming home from the battling
cages with my dad and I was telling him all

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:24.020
about the Civil War. I mostly read, like,
a book on it earlier that day. You know, how

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.860
kids are, like, they read something, they
start to tell everyone about it. Like, I mean,

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:37.290
a lot has changed in me since then. I don't
still talk about it. But, my dad had mentioned,

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:50.140
like, I think we have some Civil War stuff
at my sister's attic. And so, you know, yes,

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:58.960
we called her up and she came over and it
was like a black letter pouch, a hundred letters,

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:07.870
yellowed and laminated. And this is the book
that's in for 40 years. Here are some of the

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:16.879
letters that we think is Alfred Oates from
another thing we found in. This is I told

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:23.669
you, this amazing colorful letterheads, the
penmanship is incredible and then sitting

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:32.410
down to read this, these letters, the stories
in them were just fascinating. One letter

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:41.639
describes the execution of a number of deserters.
And you could just--you could feel them coming.

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:47.659
They're standing on their coffins so that
they just fall backwards into them when they

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:54.699
get shot. It talks about trading tobacco and
coffee with the Confederates across the river,

00:04:54.699 --> 00:05:02.900
ball games and camps, and then--so, I was
reading these letters and I got interested

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:11.600
in the Civil War and over the next few years
I just kind of kept learning about the Civil

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:19.190
War. It's just a hobby. I would read books.
I would read a letter. He mentioned a battle;

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:26.360
I'd go get a book from a library about that
battle. And then, summer before my senior

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:34.360
year in high school, I just decided I was
going write a book on it. My logic was, "I'll

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:43.340
probably write a book on it someday, you know,
I shall do it now to get on my college application.

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:54.509
So, I started on it and it wasn't, you know,
it wasn't that good. It was like a dry military

00:05:54.509 --> 00:06:06.260
history, and it was--it was okay. But then
I got to Brown University, I worked with a

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:12.550
professor and he's kept telling me, "You're
more Alfred Oates, more Alfred Oates." This

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:23.650
is the guy that's interesting. He is a compelling
character. So, I wrote that. So, it's the

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:35.129
possible appeal to, you know, history buff,
the unit he was in, the Excelsior Brigade

00:06:35.129 --> 00:06:39.620
was one of the hardest fighting of the war.
One of the most famous at that time, but there

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:43.620
hasn't been anything written on that mid over
century. And if you're just a casual reader,

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:51.159
I think it's still a good story. It is a very
compelling character. What goes through is,

00:06:51.159 --> 00:07:01.559
I think very interesting and I tried to set
it up so that each chapter is not a new topic,

00:07:01.559 --> 00:07:11.029
a new theme. So, if you read it, you get some
sense of what it was like to be a soldier

00:07:11.029 --> 00:07:22.330
fighting in the Civil War. Now, I came here
today and I'm saying that this is the Civil

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:33.500
War you should have learned it and find that
you didn't learn it the right way back in

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:41.289
high school. And I think that this is the
most misrepresented event in our nation's

00:07:41.289 --> 00:07:49.330
history. And as I was reading about it and
learning about it for the purposes of the

00:07:49.330 --> 00:08:00.080
book, I really came to believe that because
what I was learning about with the letters

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:08.240
and with the outside research I was doing
was not really what I learned in school. I

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:14.539
mean, even if you go to a great school and
you have a great history teacher, as I was

00:08:14.539 --> 00:08:20.819
fortunate enough to do and that's--so that
my old teachers who's watching this online,

00:08:20.819 --> 00:08:29.580
I want to say, you did a great job. But you're
still tied in the, you know, the curriculum

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:33.719
that the advance placement exam that helps,
you know, forces you into or suggest. You

00:08:33.719 --> 00:08:42.229
probably had learned the social history of
the world. You know, how in fact the women,

00:08:42.229 --> 00:08:46.520
blacks, immigrants, other groups, the political
histories of what President Lincoln did, what

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:53.861
Congress did, the Supreme Court, and maybe
the economic history, you know, how did it

00:08:53.861 --> 00:09:01.650
affect the agricultural self, the industrialization
of the North, and innovated development of

00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:12.660
the railroads, and if you're lucky some military
history battles in general and that sort of

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:18.040
thing. But you never get an understanding
of the central theme of the word. There's

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:25.610
never that, why was it fought? You know, what
is the over arching things that, you know,

00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:32.560
besides just the battles and the social groups
and what the president did, what was the--what

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:38.730
was the reason why this country went to war
with itself? And I think it's misrepresented

00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:45.100
and I say the most misrepresented in our nation's
history because we probably all think we know

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:53.650
that. We all ready--we think we know the answer
of why was the Civil War fought? Like, if

00:09:53.650 --> 00:10:04.959
I ask you, you know, what was the reason for
the Civil War? When you think Civil War, what's

00:10:04.959 --> 00:10:09.259
the one think you think about?
&gt;&gt; Slavery.

00:10:09.259 --> 00:10:17.790
&gt;&gt; OATES: Absolutely wrong. It was not about
slavery. I mean, this is something that I

00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:32.210
started to find in, you know, when I was reading
these letters, and I think it's understandable

00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:37.730
that we all assumed it's about slavery because
it general divided free stage versus slave

00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:43.672
stage. And when you're learning about history,
learn it chronologically. And slavery was

00:10:43.672 --> 00:10:51.149
without a doubt the biggest political issue
in this country for the 40 years previously.

00:10:51.149 --> 00:10:55.920
I mean, you're--you go to school and you learned,
you do the revolution and the constitution,

00:10:55.920 --> 00:11:02.160
and then you start getting into crisis after
crisis about slavery. The Missouri compromised

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:10.640
in 1820 about how to we administrate, it should
be a free state of slave state, the Dred Scott

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:18.130
judgment as a slave of legal improperty of
a person, the Fugitive Slave Act, the Kansas-Nebraska

00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:24.370
Act and then culminating with the Election
of 1860 when President Lincoln was elected

00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:33.459
and during which slavery was the single biggest
issue. I mean, I would say, it's really the

00:11:33.459 --> 00:11:40.290
only important issue in that presidential
election. So read all about those crisis,

00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:48.819
and then you'd read about Civil War and this
is the only, it's got to be about slavery.

00:11:48.819 --> 00:11:57.200
But I was--during my reading and was mentioned
in the book, there are couple examples that

00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:05.040
indicate it wasn't at all about slavery. One
of the letter is from Alfred K. Oates and

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:10.040
he'd talked about the Emancipation Proclamation.
And that was a bill that Lincoln signed. It's

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:17.220
about two years into the war and it said that
all slaves in Confederate held territories

00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:26.579
were now free. But Confederate held territories
are a very big quell of fact. So, slaves in

00:12:26.579 --> 00:12:32.210
the slave state that had seceded: Maryland,
Delaware, Kentucky, Missouri were not affected.

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:38.089
Slaves in territory, already captured by the
Union, not affected. So, it was only directed

00:12:38.089 --> 00:12:46.240
at the areas over which Lincoln had no direct
authority. So it was certainly a symbolic

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:51.819
victory for the anti-slavery movement and--but
it was designed as a military measure. If

00:12:51.819 --> 00:12:56.629
you cut out the slave power of the South,
that's a large portion of their manpower.

00:12:56.629 --> 00:13:03.100
Maybe some slaves will escape, maybe the South
working is hard and then you start to sap

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:07.519
the enemies right. So that's a big thing to
remember, the Emancipation Proclamation was

00:13:07.519 --> 00:13:13.750
originally a military pleasure. And this is
what one soldier reflecting his friends wrote

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:26.360
home about it, "That bill that President Lincoln
passed has turned our patriotism. And if I

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:41.720
had my will, I would not fire my gun. If by
firing it would save the unit." We look on

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:52.290
the war with indifference and do not care
of one opinion. He was--he wanted to quit

00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:58.370
the army when he found about the Emancipation
Proclamation. And that's a very paradoxical

00:13:58.370 --> 00:14:09.889
thing when you realize that Alfred Oates was
very much against slavery. In all of his letters

00:14:09.889 --> 00:14:21.911
he is negative about slavery as an institution.
The people who were connected with it on the

00:14:21.911 --> 00:14:33.120
slave owning side, he is extremely negative.
So he calls one of the most the most hateful

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:45.470
men I've ever met, a man who used to catch
fugitive slaves as a living. And whenever

00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:54.970
he mentions the slaves or free slaves, he's
very sympathetic. So, that they'll be thinking,

00:14:54.970 --> 00:15:11.319
"Why is that
that an anti-slavery person who's fighting

00:15:11.319 --> 00:15:24.949
in the Civil War which I always thought was
about slavery? Why does he want to quit and

00:15:24.949 --> 00:15:29.930
go home and let the Union break up because
of the Emancipation Proclamation?" So, I did

00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:38.040
some, some more reading and I started to understand
that you really need to understand the political

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:44.319
landscape of the times beyond just free state,
slave state. In the North, in the free states,

00:15:44.319 --> 00:15:50.930
they did not like slavery, but they also did
not like abolitionist because abolitionist

00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:57.850
or a very small fraction of the population,
they were getting slavery almost a single

00:15:57.850 --> 00:16:06.120
minute league. Some might say obsessive league.
Most men in the North and men were the only

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:12.779
ones that could vote at that time. They worked
against slavery but they're also political

00:16:12.779 --> 00:16:23.279
mavericks. So they thought, you know, let's
end this slavery but let's not do it right

00:16:23.279 --> 00:16:37.100
away. Let's certainly not push our country
into a war over it. It's just not that important.

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:42.279
And they thought the abolitionist by storing
things up, by threatening, you know, immediate

00:16:42.279 --> 00:16:51.850
abolition of slavery, they we're going to
alienate itself. And over the previous 40

00:16:51.850 --> 00:17:02.790
years when those crises that I've mentioned
happened, the South had always made it clear,

00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:09.900
"You try to abolish slavery, we might secede."
It wasn't in a direct threat but it would

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:14.860
just--they knew that was a possibility. And
the people in the North saw the abolitionist

00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:20.220
and the secessionist as the same thing. They
were radicals who were staking out their positions

00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:27.809
and who would drive the country to war rather
than lose their positions. So when the war

00:17:27.809 --> 00:17:37.169
started there was a fear, I mean, I don't
think it was a big fear, but there was a sentiment

00:17:37.169 --> 00:17:46.000
in the North that a concerned that this might
be an abolitionist plot, that this abolitionist

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:54.150
with Abraham Lincoln at their head forced
the South to secede, trigger--triggering a

00:17:54.150 --> 00:18:01.029
war during which they would abolish slavery.
And in so doing have a hundreds of thousands

00:18:01.029 --> 00:18:07.909
men who joined the army possibly died to further
their political agenda. And when the Emancipation

00:18:07.909 --> 00:18:17.210
Proclamation came up, I believe that Alfred
Oates saw this and saw this is evidence that

00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:26.360
that rumor was true. Now, he cools down a
couple of weeks afterwards, and I think once

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:34.539
they processed what it truly was they were
fine with it. But there was that fear and

00:18:34.539 --> 00:18:44.460
just one other example and one chapter of
the book, it's event, a recruiting event in

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:53.090
New York City and it's one of my favorite
chapters because you're in a big political

00:18:53.090 --> 00:19:02.060
hall and there's a rally and there's patriotic
speeches to get men to join up, and one man

00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:14.010
stands up and he shouts of, "General, if you
will only get the president of the United

00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:22.090
States to declare that this is not a war to
put down slavery in states where it exist,

00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:27.059
you will get 500,000 men in the North implying
that this fear that's actually about slavery

00:19:27.059 --> 00:19:34.080
is holding men back from joining up." I don't
think there was much truth of that because

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:41.630
Alfred Oates clearly had that fear but he
still joined up. But it said to me that it

00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:45.760
certainly was not about slavery. It certainly
was about freeing the slaves. I mean, the

00:19:45.760 --> 00:19:51.940
thought that millions of men would leave their
homes and risk their lives to free those they

00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:57.220
never met. That's extreme selfishness, selflessness
that I've never seen in political history,

00:19:57.220 --> 00:20:03.039
and it also wasn't about the institution of
slavery. So, that got me thinking, if it's

00:20:03.039 --> 00:20:09.340
not about freeing the slaves, not even about
slavery, what could it possibly be? What could

00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:15.230
be more important than the biggest political
issue of the previous 40 years? So, I read

00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:26.230
it more and I, you know, study that to try
to find the South and I came across the quote

00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:36.510
by Abraham Lincoln and I think some setup
perfectly. He says that, "A central idea pervading

00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:46.721
this struggle is the necessity that is upon
us, of providing that popular government is

00:20:46.721 --> 00:20:57.230
not an absurdity. We must settle this question
now, whether in a free government, the minority

00:20:57.230 --> 00:21:06.100
have the right to break up the government
whenever they choose. If we fail it will go

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:16.100
far to prove the incapability of the people
to govern themselves." What was truly at stake

00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:21.880
in the Civil War, at least from the Northern
perspective is the possibility that democracy

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:28.559
could actually work in the real world that
you could actually have a country without

00:21:28.559 --> 00:21:38.779
a king or a czar or an emperor and it would
stay together because the fear--and this goes

00:21:38.779 --> 00:21:42.030
back to the central dilemma of the constitutional
convention. I mean, do you think that your

00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:45.750
history about the Constitution, all the checks
and balances that divide between the house

00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:49.450
and the Senate, the legislative branch and
the presidential, the different election years

00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:54.790
was all to try to figure out how to keep a
democracy stable so that some sort of mob

00:21:54.790 --> 00:22:01.220
passion wouldn't overthrow it. So that some
dictator wouldn't come up but as I was saying

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:08.640
it wouldn't break up. Because what if there
is a big issue that people care passionately

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:15.590
about and thought, you know, for me this issue--and
majority want to do this without affecting

00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:24.010
me badly. It's better for me to just lead
the country. And that had been a concern throughout

00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:31.649
this time. I mean, the Whiskey Rebellion,
that was over--I believe it was alcohol taxes,

00:22:31.649 --> 00:22:38.000
and the people pass the Appalachian Mountains
felt that it hurt them. They tried to have

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:46.530
a rebellion. George Washington put it town.
It was the only time when the president actually

00:22:46.530 --> 00:22:55.950
fought the battle. There was a Shay's Rebellion
in Massachusetts over tax, New England actually

00:22:55.950 --> 00:23:02.241
thought about secession during the war of
1812 where the state did not get heard in

00:23:02.241 --> 00:23:09.910
their commerce. So the Civil war and the issue
of slavery as a political issue but not really

00:23:09.910 --> 00:23:15.080
the cause was made that the Civil--made the
Civil war an example of whether democracy

00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:22.590
could exist. I mean, democracy was not the--is
the main system of government at that time

00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:34.240
in 1860. Most of the world was run by a king
or its part in the colony. France had actually

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:40.850
tried out the democracy twice and they tried
a republic two times, and both times ended

00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:45.290
up with an [INDISTINCT] on the throne. So,
across the world, across Europe, all democratic

00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:47.790
performers had a point to because a successful
democracy was the United States. Everyone

00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:57.610
else would say, you know, if it won't work,
you can't work, you need that king. And so,

00:23:57.610 --> 00:24:09.779
Lincoln saw the Civil War as the test of whether
a democracy could stick together because if

00:24:09.779 --> 00:24:16.490
the South could succeed, the mid-west could,
New England could, the states could breakup

00:24:16.490 --> 00:24:22.809
from each other and then maybe democracy would
fade away in certain states, and probably

00:24:22.809 --> 00:24:33.309
it would fade away from the rest of the world.
So, I say that the Civil War is more important

00:24:33.309 --> 00:24:41.010
than you ever imagined. Not to--not to say
that the issue of slavery was not important.

00:24:41.010 --> 00:24:47.929
I mean, it affected millions of people and
the fact that it was abolished after the war

00:24:47.929 --> 00:24:56.350
was, you know, huge impact on the war. But
in fact that the North won the Civil War and

00:24:56.350 --> 00:24:59.110
proved that democracy could exist and could
actually work, I mean, that status—set the

00:24:59.110 --> 00:25:06.990
stage for democracy to take over the rest
of the world. Most of the countries in the

00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:15.860
world nowadays are democracies. And so, when
slavery affected millions, the Civil War is

00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:24.100
a test of democracy affecting billions and
that's why I think it's important, but there

00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:32.529
something else that we don't learn in school,
when we do the Socio-political Economic History,

00:25:32.529 --> 00:25:40.049
and that's the fact that the people who live
through those times were real people. They

00:25:40.049 --> 00:25:47.409
weren't just names of the book and I know
we--I mean, obviously we know that but knowing

00:25:47.409 --> 00:25:50.240
it intellectually is a lot different from
actually kind of realizing with it something

00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:57.289
from those people. And the Civil War just
as, I think slavery, the thought that we know

00:25:57.289 --> 00:26:02.330
but it's about slavery hurts us from finding
the true story, I think the letters that we

00:26:02.330 --> 00:26:14.920
do often see in public culture prevent us
from finding the full story because the typical

00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:28.289
Civil War letter that you'll see on a documentary
or a T.V. show are generally the one with

00:26:28.289 --> 00:26:40.090
the soldiers at a war and he's writing home
to his wife saying, why he's fighting, you

00:26:40.090 --> 00:26:58.020
know, maybe he is scared of death but he hopes
to see his family and if he dies she knows

00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:07.090
why he fought and knows why he believe so
much in this cause. And those were important

00:27:07.090 --> 00:27:14.820
letters and the one that's in the Ken Burns
Documentary is an amazing one. I recommend

00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:23.150
you all, you know, watch that documentary
but--and that's in the book as well, that

00:27:23.150 --> 00:27:27.740
sort of thing. But it's not—they didn't
do—they didn't sit around talking for three

00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:34.950
years every second of everyday about just
how patriotic they were and how willing to

00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:41.380
die. I mean, that got a little repetitive
after a while. And we often don't get the

00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:52.490
letters that show the full side of the war.
In fact that these people were patriotic,

00:27:52.490 --> 00:28:02.540
had their own daily dramas or envisions or
opportunities that they tried to get, and

00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:11.639
that's really what I tried to bring across
in the book. The fact that these soldiers

00:28:11.639 --> 00:28:21.709
would fight a battle, many of them would die,
the survivors would not just, be thankful

00:28:21.709 --> 00:28:32.290
that they're alive. But they would check the
newspapers to see what their media coverage

00:28:32.290 --> 00:28:50.250
was. And some of the letters were, you know,
granting, you know, I can't believe the Hometown

00:28:50.250 --> 00:28:56.080
Paper said, the 123 regiment fought, they
didn't have--their fingers were completely

00:28:56.080 --> 00:29:06.919
clean. No gun powder on. We fought. We didn't
get a matching like, that sort of thing, the

00:29:06.919 --> 00:29:15.070
daily life what actually goes on through these
men that are dismissed. And we get a very

00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:27.490
narrow view of these soldiers did. So, for
the last 20 minutes of this talk, instead

00:29:27.490 --> 00:29:35.909
of going a snapshot of what, you know, what
they did. I'm just going to tell you one story

00:29:35.909 --> 00:29:44.380
and it's the first chapter of my book. In
my mind it's about the most interesting general

00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:52.620
of the Civil War are—at least the most interesting
man who ever got the rank of general. And

00:29:52.620 --> 00:30:00.020
the hope is that if you'll like the story,
you'll get the book because there's a lot

00:30:00.020 --> 00:30:06.780
more in them. So, the man that I'm talking
about, his name is Daniel Edgar Sickles. And

00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:15.370
there he is, a handsome man. And this guy
is, I mean, he is amazing. So, let's just

00:30:15.370 --> 00:30:24.529
start, I'll go back, he was born on 1819.
His dad was a lawyer. So, middle class, his

00:30:24.529 --> 00:30:30.490
family was descended from the Dutch that colonized
Manhattan. So, you know, solid middle class

00:30:30.490 --> 00:30:39.409
maybe even upper middle class family. He was
apprenticed as a printer which is a very solid

00:30:39.409 --> 00:30:48.260
member of society. The printers were often
viewed as the editors that were in newspapers

00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:58.019
on those days. Attended what would become
New York University, NYU, and then was admitted

00:30:58.019 --> 00:31:02.930
to the Bar in 1846. He started practicing
law before he passed the Bar exam. That's

00:31:02.930 --> 00:31:09.100
going to be a trend you will find. They'll
be just a slight touch of corruption to it.

00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:18.120
But he's an ambitious man, he is a, you know,
he is a charismatic man, and you could see

00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:25.279
it from that photo, really he's a handsome
guy, nice mustache, and he gets started into

00:31:25.279 --> 00:31:34.130
politics. He's ambitious and politics in New
York City in mid 1800 means Tammany Hall.

00:31:34.130 --> 00:31:43.019
They controlled the Democratic Party and the
Democrats controlled the city. Now, whenever

00:31:43.019 --> 00:31:49.320
you've ever heard about urban political corruption,
so graft, kickbacks, votes for favors, you

00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:57.440
know, electoral fraud, Tammany Hall set the
gold standard for this. Nothing, nothing in

00:31:57.440 --> 00:32:08.000
Chicago ever came close to what Tammany could
do and if you saw the movie, Gangs of New

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:16.090
York, the guy, I can't remember the actor's
name but he was the father in the Bridget

00:32:16.090 --> 00:32:28.150
Jones movies. His character in The Gangs of
New York was a boss at Tammany Hall and they

00:32:28.150 --> 00:32:37.899
show scenes and this actually happened, immigrants
would come off the boat they would get maybe

00:32:37.899 --> 00:32:50.870
a roof over their heads, Tammany would help
them find the, you know, find the job and

00:32:50.870 --> 00:33:02.360
all they ask in return that very time people
at Tammany where their votes on election day,

00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:11.150
maybe their votes a few times, maybe the votes
of their friends, maybe the votes of their

00:33:11.150 --> 00:33:20.299
recently deceased. If there was--if there
a name on the rolls Tammany was going to get

00:33:20.299 --> 00:33:28.850
their vote. All the old political machines
operate the same ways, James Michael Curley

00:33:28.850 --> 00:33:38.230
in Boston, Richard Daley the elder in Chicago.
Basically, it was the same thing but Tammany

00:33:38.230 --> 00:33:47.920
was the best. They were the most outrageous.
So Dan Sickles joins Tammany Hall and he moves

00:33:47.920 --> 00:34:01.000
up very quickly. And then you can see 1853
Council for the city, same year serves at

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:07.630
the Embassy in London. The ambassador at that
time would be, was James Buchanan. He was

00:34:07.630 --> 00:34:15.220
the president before Lincoln. Then, New York
State Senate very quickly elected him as a

00:34:15.220 --> 00:34:23.270
U.S. congressman, so very rapid rise. I mean,
he was an ambitious man, he was a talented

00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:32.560
man, but he--wherever he went even in his
professional rise that took him from council

00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:41.080
to congressman in four years scandals always
followed him. I mean he just couldn't get

00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:53.760
away from them. First one is in his marriage,
and when your marriage is a scandal, you'll

00:34:53.760 --> 00:35:02.010
know that it's something was going on. So
this is Teresa Bagioli, his wife. I don't

00:35:02.010 --> 00:35:13.320
know which one is the more lifelike. I hope
for his sake it's the one in the right, he's

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:26.290
a handsome man. But he married Teresa in 1852
just before he came to be a city councilor.

00:35:26.290 --> 00:35:38.619
That was a big scandal at stake. And she was
also a member of society. Her grandfather

00:35:38.619 --> 00:35:45.240
had written the librettos for Mozart's operas.
Her father was a music teacher in New York

00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:54.250
City and she actually grew up speaking five
languages. She's a very intelligent girl,

00:35:54.250 --> 00:36:06.891
but the marriage was against the wishes of
both families. So it's a strange when you

00:36:06.891 --> 00:36:15.490
think that families were very good family
friends. Sickles was a friend of her father

00:36:15.490 --> 00:36:29.440
until the details started coming out. First
of all Teresa was pregnant at the time of

00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:51.170
her marriage, probably the cause of the marriage.
Dan Sickles, well, he was 33 at that time

00:36:51.170 --> 00:37:07.860
and Teresa was 16, and even in the 19th Century
that was not so great, even when they married

00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:33.950
young. And then finally this is just a rumor
but I really had to say because with Dan Sickles

00:37:33.950 --> 00:37:45.470
you never know, it was said that a couple
of years earlier Dan had had an affair with

00:37:45.470 --> 00:37:52.369
Teresa's mother. So, you wouldn't be friends
with Dan Sickles afterwards. I mean, first

00:37:52.369 --> 00:38:05.359
his wife and now his daughter. They got married
and they have a baby and Dan begins his political

00:38:05.359 --> 00:38:13.190
career but again the scandals keep coming.
When he was a state senator he was censured

00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:24.130
for bringing a prostitute under the floor
of the Senate. They were not allowed in the

00:38:24.130 --> 00:38:33.820
tours. He then takes the same prostitute on
an official trip to England, presented her

00:38:33.820 --> 00:38:43.540
to Queen Victoria and as a prostitute's name
gave the name of one of its political opponents.

00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:57.530
I'll be honest, I've actually studied this,
I tried to figure out, you know, I did political

00:38:57.530 --> 00:39:12.940
science what he was going for, I don't really
know. I think he was just him having fun with

00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:30.900
his political opponent. He knew this story
was going to come up. But all of this is

00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:42.069
the minor leagues for Dan Sickles. This is
just a warming up to one of the big scandals

00:39:42.069 --> 00:39:50.810
of his life, The Philip Barton Key Affair.
I don't say it's the biggest because he later

00:39:50.810 --> 00:40:03.900
was rumored to have had an affair of the Queen
of Spain as the ambassador but this was definitely

00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:22.550
number two at least. So Dan Sickles at 1857,
he has won the election to Congress from as

00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:29.990
a health representative from he New York State,
he travels down to Washington and immediately

00:40:29.990 --> 00:40:35.370
comes in with that, you know, Washington society.
He is a charismatic man from the largest city

00:40:35.370 --> 00:40:42.450
in the country and his wife is a beautiful
20-year-old, who speaks five languages, and

00:40:42.450 --> 00:40:51.230
so, they go in and they get into society and
they make plenty of friends and Philip Barton

00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:58.230
Key was one of them. He was a U.S. attorney
for the District of Columbia. His father wrote

00:40:58.230 --> 00:41:09.050
the Star Spangled Banner and his uncle was
the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, so

00:41:09.050 --> 00:41:19.170
a solid member of Washington society. He is
a handsome man, again, the mustache, back

00:41:19.170 --> 00:41:27.220
in those days they were amazing. He and Dan
Sickles become really great friends even to

00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:36.119
the point where Dan Sickles entrusts Philip
to take Teresa to all the balls and parties

00:41:36.119 --> 00:41:47.530
that she has to attend whenever Dan Sickles
is busy either with, you know, official work

00:41:47.530 --> 00:42:00.300
or, you know, a prostitute of his own. This
was not such a great idea because in--during

00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:08.339
the winter of 1858 to 1859, this is after
Dan Sickles' has won reelection before he

00:42:08.339 --> 00:42:13.609
was sworn in to his second term, Philip Barton
Key and Teresa begin an affair of their own,

00:42:13.609 --> 00:42:22.990
soon to become the talk of the capital. Everyone
knows about it except for Dan Sickles. And

00:42:22.990 --> 00:42:31.730
he can get the point where Philip Key rents
out a house on 15th Street, I think at the

00:42:31.730 --> 00:42:49.800
northwest quadrant as a love nest for him
and Teresa and it was not in a very good part

00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:56.690
of town and you could probably tell from this
drawing, you know, chick and dogs or something

00:42:56.690 --> 00:43:08.000
but, you know, it's not a great section of
town but Philip Key rented it up and it was

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:22.270
just--it was the talk of Washington society.
That ends at late February just before Dan

00:43:22.270 --> 00:43:37.660
Sickles is sworn into his second term. He
receives an anonymous note telling him of

00:43:37.660 --> 00:44:01.460
the affair. He was in the House of Representative
at that time, he goes into the cloakroom,

00:44:01.460 --> 00:44:20.980
brings the friend in who was the clerk and
he asks, "Is this true?" And he said, "It

00:44:20.980 --> 00:44:35.350
is." And Dan Sickles was reported to be distraught
and actually weeping at this news. I mean,

00:44:35.350 --> 00:44:46.990
whatever his own indiscretions, he did not
think that his wife would do this to him.

00:44:46.990 --> 00:44:56.950
So, he goes home, he confronts Theresa, he
forces her two days later to write a confession.

00:44:56.950 --> 00:45:08.310
A handwritten confession about what she did.
Some of the things just says, "I've been in

00:45:08.310 --> 00:45:20.670
a house on 15th St. with Mr. Key, how many
times, I don't know." And then later, I've

00:45:20.670 --> 00:45:29.940
written this with my bedroom door open and
my maid and child in the adjoining room and

00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:34.319
bringing the child into it." Just to stress
the fact that Theresa was a mother and she

00:45:34.319 --> 00:45:38.660
was having an affair. So, Sickles doesn't
know what to do. This actually—this letter,

00:45:38.660 --> 00:45:43.410
just here it is, this was flashed on the cover
of Harper's Weekly later, the biggest newspaper

00:45:43.410 --> 00:45:47.069
at that time. It was—it was the—one of
the few pieces of national media we had that

00:45:47.069 --> 00:45:49.640
had a circulations of 200,000 each copy, and
you can assume it was passed around a number

00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:51.180
of times. So, a sizable proportion of the
population read Theresa's confession, later

00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:54.770
on. And the reason that just became a big
deal. The reason that Harper's Weekly eventually

00:45:54.770 --> 00:45:55.770
got this is because the next day that came,
Dan Sickles is in his house, that's on Lafayette

00:45:55.770 --> 00:45:59.590
Square, which is, you know, Washington D.C.
is right next to the White House. He was sitting

00:45:59.590 --> 00:46:13.240
there and he had a couple of friends over,
political advisors, trying to fear or what

00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:23.569
to do with this whole thing. And he looks
out the window, and who does he see but Philip

00:46:23.569 --> 00:46:25.570
Barton Key. Key had a—we think had a rendezvous
with Theresa planned, she didn't show up.

00:46:25.570 --> 00:46:26.570
She was, you know, locked in her bedroom with
her maid and her child. You know, she didn't

00:46:26.570 --> 00:46:27.570
show up, he goes over to Lafayette Square.
And he's actually standing in the Square,

00:46:27.570 --> 00:46:31.350
outside of their house with a white handkerchief,
signaling to Theresa to get her attention.

00:46:31.350 --> 00:46:34.140
Dan Sickles sees this and whatever kind of
passionate nature he had that made him cry

00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:39.200
when he heard about the affair. He just freaked
out. And he grabs two guns—three guns, two

00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:47.100
Derringers and a revolver. He storms out of
the house. And Philip Key is a U.S. Attorney.

00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:52.240
He is no downy. He sees Dan Sickles with the
guns, figures up the gig is up and he starts

00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:59.670
running. Dan Sickles chases after him, through
Lafayette Square, I mean, shouting. One of

00:46:59.670 --> 00:47:16.730
the things that, you know, he was afforded
to say, I don't know if this was a reconstruction

00:47:16.730 --> 00:47:17.730
is, "Key, you scoundrel, you have disgraced
my home; you must die." He fires out. He grazes

00:47:17.730 --> 00:47:19.660
him with his first shot. He fires out again.
He hits him—Philip Key in the groin. Key

00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:20.660
is now on the ground on Lafayette Square.
He's crawling, he's actually begging for his

00:47:20.660 --> 00:47:24.030
life against this madman, who's running at
him with a gun. Dan Sickles chases after on

00:47:24.030 --> 00:47:28.140
him. And they think Key crawled to under a
tree. He was sitting there and kind of like

00:47:28.140 --> 00:47:31.380
propped up and begging for his life. Dan Sickles
spot aims at him. He pulls the trigger, has

00:47:31.380 --> 00:47:36.490
a misfire. Now, if it was a movie, maybe the
cops are rushing or he, you know, he comes

00:47:36.490 --> 00:47:38.700
to his sense, or things, whatever. But, this
isn't a movie. So, he takes the next gun,

00:47:38.700 --> 00:47:40.980
points at him, he pulls the trigger, boom.
Hits Philip Key in the chest as Dan Sickles

00:47:40.980 --> 00:47:42.490
turns to go home. A United States Attorney,
his uncle's a Chief Justice, is bleeding to

00:47:42.490 --> 00:47:43.490
death in Lafayette Park, in broad daylight
about 200 yards from the White House. So,

00:47:43.490 --> 00:47:44.490
as you can imagine, Dan Sickles eventually
turns himself into the Attorney General. And

00:47:44.490 --> 00:47:46.359
it becomes the biggest trial of the century.
And so, Harper's Weekly got the confession.

00:47:46.359 --> 00:47:48.980
They also made a lithograph of what they assumed
to be the affair. I just want—I just want

00:47:48.980 --> 00:47:54.180
to take one step at a time. I like this—yes,
like, the illustrator thought, "Oh I need

00:47:54.180 --> 00:48:00.020
a passers by," So he has a guy, coolly, you
know—leaning by the spiked iron fence, just

00:48:00.020 --> 00:48:02.349
leaning my elbow on just watching a dude get
murdered. You know, "Hi, honey, how was your

00:48:02.349 --> 00:48:07.140
day?" "Oh, nice, I took a walk, and so, I
got to get murdered, no big deal. My elbows

00:48:07.140 --> 00:48:09.700
are all thrown up." So, he came to trial,
the biggest trial of the year, or certainly

00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:12.190
the biggest trial of the decade. Daniel Sickles,
United States Congressman killing a man in

00:48:12.190 --> 00:48:15.750
broad daylight. But Dan Sickles, as I said,
he is ambitious. He's charismatic, and he

00:48:15.750 --> 00:48:20.809
is not going to let a little thing like a
murder, you know, slow him up. So, he gets

00:48:20.809 --> 00:48:24.180
as his lawyer, Edwin Stanton. One of the best
attorneys in the country later would be the

00:48:24.180 --> 00:48:26.800
Secretary of War under Abraham Lincoln, so,
a very smart man. They devised a strategy.

00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:31.950
First of all, they plead not guilty by means
of temporary insanity which was the first

00:48:31.950 --> 00:48:33.740
in the American jurisprudence; they had never
had temporary insanity. But really what they

00:48:33.740 --> 00:48:35.109
did was they realized this is a celebrity
trial, and so, they built it on character.

00:48:35.109 --> 00:48:38.440
Dan Sickles, you know, he was only—he was
an outstanding man. He was defending his home,

00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:39.470
he was defending his art. The real criminal
here was Philip Key, the evil Philip Key with

00:48:39.470 --> 00:48:40.470
his house in the bad section of town tempting
the innocent Theresa from her marital bliss

00:48:40.470 --> 00:48:43.150
into a life of sin. You know, that was the
real crime here. And so, they do this entire

00:48:43.150 --> 00:48:44.150
trial and as you can see he's covered in the
media, I mean, people were following this

00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:45.150
the—I'm sure, the arguments were printed
out in the newspapers of the day. And so,

00:48:45.150 --> 00:48:46.150
the verdict comes, he's not guilty, of course.
And the verdict comes to a cheering courtroom,

00:48:46.150 --> 00:48:47.150
who were all wildly in favor of Dan Sickles.
Now, he should have been at a peak of his

00:48:47.150 --> 00:48:48.150
career right now. He was a nationally known
figure, very popular. He had defended his

00:48:48.150 --> 00:48:49.150
home, you know, Victorian gentleman, defending
his honor. But then, he did something, I don't

00:48:49.150 --> 00:48:50.150
think, Dan Sickles, the wily politician realized
what effects this would have. He made a mistake

00:48:50.150 --> 00:48:51.150
right after the trial. Theresa came to him
and she asked for forgiveness. And he gave

00:48:51.150 --> 00:48:52.150
it to her. And now, all of the sudden, the
coin turned because, Theresa, wasn't she the

00:48:52.150 --> 00:48:53.150
one, who her sins had caused the man to die,
caused Sickles to go through this terrible

00:48:53.150 --> 00:48:54.150
ordeal, caused New York one of their congressmen
for a large part of 1859. And all of the sudden,

00:48:54.150 --> 00:48:55.150
I think, you know, Sickles or Tammany Hall,
or the folks at the district realized, you

00:48:55.150 --> 00:48:56.150
know, if you take the people who are now,
have the audacity of forgiving his wife. The

00:48:56.150 --> 00:48:57.150
people who still never got over the fact that
he killed a man, and then, those who just

00:48:57.150 --> 00:48:58.150
didn't like him anyway. Dan Sickles was not
winning reelection. So, 1860 comes, he's not

00:48:58.150 --> 00:48:59.150
reelected to another term. And when Dan—when
Abraham Lincoln comes into Washington in March

00:48:59.150 --> 00:49:00.150
of 1861, Dan Sickles is on a train back to
New York City, he's in political exile. He's

00:49:00.150 --> 00:49:01.150
a politician that no one—no one likes. But,
then something happens that I don't think

00:49:01.150 --> 00:49:02.150
Sickles knew what [indistinct] this would
have, the Civil War happens. Now, the story

00:49:02.150 --> 00:49:03.150
of how—I'm running out of time, a story
of how Dan Sickles became the General in Command

00:49:03.150 --> 00:49:04.150
of Excelsior Brigade, the great stories, it's
in the book. I don't have time to say it now,

00:49:04.150 --> 00:49:05.150
but it involves upstate New York versus New
York City, Democrats and Republicans in the

00:49:05.150 --> 00:49:06.150
Senate, the State versus Federal Bureaucracy.
And it ends up with a scandal involving President

00:49:06.150 --> 00:49:07.150
Lincoln, Mary Todd Lincoln, the White House
gardener and an undercover newspaper reporter

00:49:07.150 --> 00:49:08.150
who had previously been a spy for England
and France. Or at least, that's, is involved

00:49:08.150 --> 00:49:09.150
there—basically, the former spy was a kind
of the European version of Dan Sickles. Now,

00:49:09.150 --> 00:49:10.150
that—the fact is that Dan Sickles, because
he was in exile had to do something big. When

00:49:10.150 --> 00:49:11.150
the Civil War came along, he had to recruit
men—I mean, he's no longer a congressman

00:49:11.150 --> 00:49:12.150
and what's the only thing really better than
being a congressman, and that's being a general.

00:49:12.150 --> 00:49:13.150
So, he wanted to be a general. So, he puts
all of his efforts in 1861 into recruiting

00:49:13.150 --> 00:49:14.150
man, later into the political battles to get
himself to command them. Now, I mentioned

00:49:14.150 --> 00:49:19.330
this story and why it's part of the Civil
War that you should have learned. Because

00:49:19.330 --> 00:49:20.330
the fact that this man was a politician and
ambitious, and that his career was ruined.

00:49:20.330 --> 00:49:25.190
He is--I think 90% of why he recruited a brigade.
And he was a patriotic man, I think, that

00:49:25.190 --> 00:49:26.190
comes through that he actually care about
the country, but he was also a very ambitious

00:49:26.190 --> 00:49:27.190
man. And the brigade he formed, which my great,
great, great grandfather fought in. He fought

00:49:27.190 --> 00:49:28.190
about 20 battles; they did very well, certainly
made many contributions to the Union war effort.

00:49:28.190 --> 00:49:29.190
So, the fact that a murder trial impacted
5,000 men fighting for their country is something

00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:30.190
that we don't learn. And something we don't
realize the daily dramas and ambitions that

00:49:30.190 --> 00:49:31.190
are actually go into a national struggle like
the Civil War. But, and then, this is what

00:49:31.190 --> 00:49:32.190
happened in the end, the Excelsior Brigade
was called after Dan Sickles, that a murderer

00:49:32.190 --> 00:49:33.190
became kind of a patron of 5,000 Union soldiers.
But, I mentioned this not just because it's

00:49:33.190 --> 00:49:34.190
an interesting story and I hope you had, you
know, enjoyed hearing but wanted to hear more

00:49:34.190 --> 00:49:35.190
so you get my book. I say it because the two
parts of my talk today are connected. The

00:49:35.190 --> 00:49:36.190
fact is, the Civil War is more important that
we ever thought about. And also it can be

00:49:36.190 --> 00:49:37.190
more entertainment than we ever learned. And
I think, that's very—the connection between

00:49:37.190 --> 00:49:38.190
them is very, very big because I read about
the Civil War. And I started in it because

00:49:38.190 --> 00:49:39.190
of the letters I got from my ancestors. And
I read them because they were interesting.

00:49:39.190 --> 00:49:40.190
And I kept reading them because they were
interesting. And so, to better figure them

00:49:40.190 --> 00:49:41.190
out, I read more about the Civil War. I read
other books and I read, you know, the more

00:49:41.190 --> 00:49:42.190
difficult books about the political and economic
situation. So, it was the fact that it was

00:49:42.190 --> 00:49:43.190
entertaining that lead me to the importance.
I certainly—I would never have stayed with

00:49:43.190 --> 00:49:44.190
it long enough to get to the understanding
of the Civil War democracy's testing ground

00:49:44.190 --> 00:49:45.190
if it hadn't been for the letters I got and
for stories like this murder trial. And that's

00:49:45.190 --> 00:49:46.190
something that we don't get in our history
classes, like, we're—we don't give the human

00:49:46.190 --> 00:49:47.190
dramas, we don't give the entertaining value
that history can be. And so, we don't give

00:49:47.190 --> 00:49:48.190
kids the incentive to keep on reading outside
of school. And obviously we can't do it for

00:49:48.190 --> 00:49:49.190
every student for every era. But, if we start
to do it more and if we start to show them

00:49:49.190 --> 00:49:50.190
why it can be fun to read about history, I
think that would lead them to understand why

00:49:50.190 --> 00:49:51.190
it's important. And we'll lead them to things
that they wouldn't just get even if they got

00:49:51.190 --> 00:49:52.190
a perfect on their AP exam. So, that is I
think the fact that entertainment and historical

00:49:52.190 --> 00:49:53.190
importance to go together is the Civil War
as you should have learned it. And I'll take

00:49:53.190 --> 00:49:54.190
any questions that you have. Yes.
&gt;&gt; Your thesis is that Civil War's about preserving

00:49:54.190 --> 00:49:55.190
a national government that is, you know, not
like royalty or devolves into something where

00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:56.190
the people split apart.
&gt;&gt; OATES: Right. I mean, certainly like other

00:49:56.190 --> 00:49:57.190
factors were very important, but I think that's
the overall, okay.

00:49:57.190 --> 00:49:58.190
&gt;&gt; The Internet, how much do you interpret
the last part of Lincoln's Gettysburg Address

00:49:58.190 --> 00:49:59.190
where he says, "Government of the people,
by a people, for the people, shall not perish

00:49:59.190 --> 00:50:00.190
from the earth." Do you have any comments
about that because I've always wondered what

00:50:00.190 --> 00:50:01.190
the heck he really means by that? You can
interpret it as people, you know, on all of

00:50:01.190 --> 00:50:02.190
the people versus just white people. But,
in terms of the national government, do you

00:50:02.190 --> 00:50:03.190
have any feeling about what that means?
&gt;&gt; OATES: Oh, yeah, I just read that as an

00:50:03.190 --> 00:50:04.190
understanding for the Constitution and the
Democratic System of Government which they

00:50:04.190 --> 00:50:05.190
felt would fail if the Union as a unified
country failed. I mean, that's what I interpret

00:50:05.190 --> 00:50:06.190
as, if the Union divides itself, the democracy
will start to perish, not just in American,

00:50:06.190 --> 00:50:07.190
but across the world. I mean, I just saw this
as rhetoric, I didn't think it was anything

00:50:07.190 --> 00:50:08.190
more. I might be wrong and I'm not sure.
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:50:08.190 --> 00:50:09.190
&gt;&gt; I can answer that it's because at the time
when you're asking about strong and if the

00:50:09.190 --> 00:50:10.190
U.S. would really break up in half, it would
be vulnerable to foreign powers playing it

00:50:10.190 --> 00:50:11.190
off the other, because foreign powers do not
understand democracy. And that's—that's

00:50:11.190 --> 00:50:12.190
when Lincoln had--I'm glad you brought up
the Gettysburg Address because I can't totally

00:50:12.190 --> 00:50:13.190
agree with the thesis you made. And there's
two points I disagree with. The first is,

00:50:13.190 --> 00:50:14.190
you said that you sort of discovered the study
in the letters that a lot of people were more

00:50:14.190 --> 00:50:15.190
focused on preserving democracy rather than
eliminating slavery. But, that's not anything

00:50:15.190 --> 00:50:16.190
buried at all, it is the—it's the meat of
the Gettysburg address. I mean, that is the

00:50:16.190 --> 00:50:17.190
thesis that Lincoln talks about. I don't believe
he mentioned slavery in the Gettysburg address.

00:50:17.190 --> 00:50:18.190
&gt;&gt; OATES: Right.
&gt;&gt; It was very overt.

00:50:18.190 --> 00:50:19.190
&gt;&gt; OATES: That's what you learn about in school,
you often learn slavery as the Civil War that

00:50:19.190 --> 00:50:20.190
was I was talking about.
&gt;&gt; Well, that's the second part of the disagreement

00:50:20.190 --> 00:50:21.190
I had with you, I mean, I feel like I'm the
only one who still thinks the Civil War was

00:50:21.190 --> 00:50:22.190
about slavery. Every time people comment on
the Civil War in the media, they're always

00:50:22.190 --> 00:50:23.190
saying that, "Oh, the conventional wisdom
is—it was about slavery, but actually it

00:50:23.190 --> 00:50:24.190
wasn't," actually, everybody says that. This
is what I hear all commentators about the

00:50:24.190 --> 00:50:25.190
Civil War say. In my opinion, the only way
you can accept this thesis is you can just

00:50:25.190 --> 00:50:26.190
ignore all the evidences that speaks against
it. Look at the declarations of Independence

00:50:26.190 --> 00:50:27.190
of the individual states. Look at what they
said, their reasons for seceding in the war,

00:50:27.190 --> 00:50:28.190
they were very overt, they wanted to establish
a white supremacist state, that's what they

00:50:28.190 --> 00:50:29.190
have wrote. And also about democracy, the
Confederation was also a democracy, actually.

00:50:29.190 --> 00:50:30.190
It was not, though, they were not nominating
a king.

00:50:30.190 --> 00:50:31.190
&gt;&gt; OATES: Well, on that—I'm not, I mean,
I'm not an expert on the stuff. I know that

00:50:31.190 --> 00:50:32.190
slavery was much more important to them. I
only thought slavery in the South as the issue

00:50:32.190 --> 00:50:33.190
that led into what they thought is a perceived
political disenfranchisement. I think for

00:50:33.190 --> 00:50:34.190
them, the election of Lincoln, they already
were in the minority in the House. They, I

00:50:34.190 --> 00:50:35.190
think, were the minority in the Senate and
now, they lost—the president was against

00:50:35.190 --> 00:50:36.190
slavery. I thought for them slavery was the
issue that shows from here on out, the South

00:50:36.190 --> 00:50:37.190
was going to be voted down time and again
in Washington. So, it's better for them to

00:50:37.190 --> 00:50:38.190
get out of the country so they can have as
say, yeah.

00:50:38.190 --> 00:50:39.190
&gt;&gt; I think the two different things are being
said here. On the one hand, it's certainly

00:50:39.190 --> 00:50:40.190
true that the South seceded because they wanted
to maintain slavery. I mean, after the jury

00:50:40.190 --> 00:50:41.190
stopped the decision, there were people in
the South saying, "Oh, we're going to open

00:50:41.190 --> 00:50:42.190
a slave market on Boston Commons." So, they
envision not only having slavery, but it's

00:50:42.190 --> 00:50:43.190
sending them into the North. I think, it's
also valid to say this especially based on

00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:44.190
the letters that you have. And the comments
about people riding it at the time, that the

00:50:44.190 --> 00:50:45.190
majority of the people in the North did not
see the fight as being about slavery, they

00:50:45.190 --> 00:50:46.190
were uncomfortable with that. Okay, a lot
of them saw the fight as not necessarily being

00:50:46.190 --> 00:50:47.190
about slavery, or limiting slavery as being
about preserving the Union. I mean, and Lincoln

00:50:47.190 --> 00:50:48.190
certainly did not go into office saying I'm
going to eliminate slavery. So, you have to

00:50:48.190 --> 00:50:49.190
be clear that it's not that the North stood
up and said, "We're not going to get rid of

00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:50.190
the slavery and stop this." And thereby stop
the South, it's more Lincoln said, "We're

00:50:50.190 --> 00:50:51.190
going to preserve the Union and the South
gave us the reason for winning, we're going

00:50:51.190 --> 00:50:52.190
to maintain slavery." So, it's a—I think
the premise that it's a lot more complicated

00:50:52.190 --> 00:50:53.190
than saying somebody in the North decided
it's time to get rid of slavery.

00:50:53.190 --> 00:50:54.190
&gt;&gt; That's a good premise.
&gt;&gt; OATES: And what you said about slavery

00:50:54.190 --> 00:50:55.190
being a very big issue for the South, I think,
I mean,-it's that actually true that it was.

00:50:55.190 --> 00:50:56.190
What Lincoln was talking about, I think, is
that there are always going to be very important

00:50:56.190 --> 00:50:57.190
issues to groups of people. You know, you
have to make sure in a democracy for it to

00:50:57.190 --> 00:50:58.190
last that even if folks that lose out on a
specific issue don't leave the country because,

00:50:58.190 --> 00:50:59.190
I mean, as I've said in New England almost
you see, they talked about secession during

00:50:59.190 --> 00:51:00.190
the war of 1812 which they felt hurt commerce
with Britain because we were at war with Britain.

00:51:00.190 --> 00:51:01.190
And so, you know, it was hurting their interests.
So, I think it was that at any given point

00:51:01.190 --> 00:51:02.190
in time, there's going to be a big issue,
maybe not only it's because of bigots and

00:51:02.190 --> 00:51:03.190
slavery again. And I certainly think slavery's
is why it was between the states that was

00:51:03.190 --> 00:51:04.190
in 1860. But, for Lincoln it was about the
general idea that even a political issue can't—doesn't

00:51:04.190 --> 00:51:05.190
divide a country—into two different countries.
&gt;&gt; I think you see it's like today with the

00:51:05.190 --> 00:51:06.190
Healthcare debate too. I mean, I think a lot
of people react to, you know, like the imposition

00:51:06.190 --> 00:51:07.190
of some sort of healthcare program as even
though, a president was elected. The—it's

00:51:07.190 --> 00:51:08.190
still some, some sort of aggravation of democracy.
And it's an important issue and people feel

00:51:08.190 --> 00:51:09.190
that because their voices isn't the one that's
being represented that democracy is somehow

00:51:09.190 --> 00:51:10.190
being sacrificed, not counting on the validity
of that position at all. I think it's not

00:51:10.190 --> 00:51:11.190
something that's gone away. This sense that,
you know, like this is so important to me

00:51:11.190 --> 00:51:12.190
that, you know, screw democracy.
&gt;&gt; OATES: I mean, it's—a lot of democracies

00:51:12.190 --> 00:51:13.190
have split up, I mean, Yugoslavia's is split
up over, it wasn't a democracy, but you know,

00:51:13.190 --> 00:51:14.190
a lot of countries has split up over specific
issues. So yet, it's not unlikely but it might

00:51:14.190 --> 00:51:15.190
happen.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, I mean democracy is a corrupted

00:51:15.190 --> 00:51:16.190
republic, anyway. I mean, if you look at—if
you look at [INDISTINCT] of government, I

00:51:16.190 --> 00:51:17.190
mean, it's actually, essentially the majority
rule, it's not really the kind of thing that

00:51:17.190 --> 00:51:18.190
you want, it's mob rule.
&gt;&gt; Yes, two walls and a sheet voting on what's

00:51:18.190 --> 00:51:19.190
for dinner.
&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly.

00:51:19.190 --> 00:51:20.190
&gt;&gt; OATES: Are you—are you, you're right.
I mean, back in that time they talked much

00:51:20.190 --> 00:51:21.190
more in terms of the Republic and preserving
the Republic. Nowadays, they talk about democracy.

00:51:21.190 --> 00:51:22.190
And we have implicitly the idea of checks
and balances. So that's why, I use the term

00:51:22.190 --> 00:51:23.190
of majority rules because that's what, you
know, that we think of.

00:51:23.190 --> 00:51:24.190
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, they did, Lincoln talked about preserving

00:51:24.190 --> 00:51:25.190
the Republic and preserving popular government.
He didn't even ever use the term democracy.

00:51:25.190 --> 00:51:26.190
&gt;&gt; I supposed it devolved into a healthcare
debate, I don't know.

00:51:26.190 --> 00:51:27.190
&gt;&gt; No, I—I think you've made an excellent
point, though, because it's the whole thing

00:51:27.190 --> 00:51:28.190
is very complex and you can't simply say that
it is slavery and you can't simply say that

00:51:28.190 --> 00:51:29.190
it isn't. I mean, I thought about this a lot
and I think, you know, if slavery had not

00:51:29.190 --> 00:51:30.190
been an issue, there might not have been any
other issue newly to divide the section of

00:51:30.190 --> 00:51:31.190
states. On the other hand, it was—how are
we going to resolve this that was the primary

00:51:31.190 --> 00:51:32.190
cause in the Civil War. A lot of people thought,
okay, is where do we miss because they want

00:51:32.190 --> 00:51:33.190
to preserve the Union and then they eventually
changed the scene and that this was a way

00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:34.190
of getting beyond the usual slavery routes
and all those things that's been happening

00:51:34.190 --> 00:51:35.190
all over the country. And that there's still
the debate, you know, nobody's going to be

00:51:35.190 --> 00:51:36.190
able to answer something especially since
none of the people that moved to the Union

00:51:36.190 --> 00:51:37.190
at the time are alive anymore.
&gt;&gt; In your research, did you find another—and

00:51:37.190 --> 00:51:38.190
I always thought that it was about slavery,
but not in terms of the normal good or bad

00:51:38.190 --> 00:51:39.190
in that kind of system, and that the North
was winning over the South because they were

00:51:39.190 --> 00:51:40.190
more powerful. And then they secede because
they thought they were going to lose their

00:51:40.190 --> 00:51:41.190
economic place. And then they got rid of slavery
with the votes that describes this outcome.

00:51:41.190 --> 00:51:42.190
&gt;&gt; OATES: I mean, that's probably wasn't important.
I never—I never came across that. I came

00:51:42.190 --> 00:51:43.190
across the South thinking with slavery, you
need to expand westward or else it will eventually,

00:51:43.190 --> 00:51:44.190
you know, wither and die, I think that's the
term they used in the North, not wanting to

00:51:44.190 --> 00:51:45.190
let it to expand westward. And that was—that
was actually the main debate in the election

00:51:45.190 --> 00:51:46.190
that Lincoln was voted. Whether slavery would
expand westward and he came down and I know

00:51:46.190 --> 00:51:47.190
it's not going to expand at all. And those
in the South were against--very much against

00:51:47.190 --> 00:51:48.190
Lincoln, thought, well, he won't let it expand
west. Next thing he's going to do is eliminate

00:51:48.190 --> 00:51:49.190
where it already exists, and that's why the
man that stood up at the political rally said,

00:51:49.190 --> 00:51:50.190
get Lincoln to say it's not about putting
slavery where it already exists. I think,

00:51:50.190 --> 00:51:51.190
most of people in the North would agree that
it shouldn't expand—that's why they voted

00:51:51.190 --> 00:51:52.190
for Lincoln, but they weren't about to start
a war to put it down where it already was.

00:51:52.190 --> 00:51:53.190
&gt;&gt; And was their main reason for why the North
didn't want it to expand?

00:51:53.190 --> 00:51:54.190
&gt;&gt; OATES: I think the idea of the frontier
was very important back then, the fact that,

00:51:54.190 --> 00:51:55.190
you know, it gets too crowded in the east,
a man can always go-- a white man, can always

00:51:55.190 --> 00:51:56.190
go west and find new land. And that you have
slavery in the west. Then, you have the system

00:51:56.190 --> 00:51:57.190
of planting crop or an aristocrat with thousands
of slaves taking off the land from the humbled,

00:51:57.190 --> 00:51:58.190
you know, middle class white men, who would
have had that.

00:51:58.190 --> 00:51:59.190
&gt;&gt; I think that's a good point too, I mean,
it's—the whole dynamic as west versus east

00:51:59.190 --> 00:52:00.190
as much as it is North versus South. I mean,
Lincoln represented the west. The Republicans

00:52:00.190 --> 00:52:01.190
represented the west, I mean, the first Republican
candidate was John Freemont, who was a Californian.

00:52:01.190 --> 00:52:02.190
So, it's more of the attitude of the westerners,
which in those days with people from Iowa

00:52:02.190 --> 00:52:03.190
and Minnesota and things like that who said,
"We want to have the life out, life further

00:52:03.190 --> 00:52:04.190
west would be the same as what we have."
&gt;&gt; Well, I learned that at school, it sounded

00:52:04.190 --> 00:52:05.190
like that and the other side of it was that
it was a more of a conservative thing, a little

00:52:05.190 --> 00:52:06.190
more, and if they lost control of the South
and the South getting trade with Europe and

00:52:06.190 --> 00:52:07.190
that sort of thing.
&gt;&gt; OATES: I mean.

00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:08.190
&gt;&gt; Would be much worse than abolition.
&gt;&gt; In Atlanta?

00:52:08.190 --> 00:52:09.190
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; OATES: If the Europe is a big part. British,

00:52:09.190 --> 00:52:10.190
I go to school in Britain. So I've read, you
know, their history textbooks, occasionally.

00:52:10.190 --> 00:52:11.190
They wanted to establish an informal empire
in the South like what they had in Latin America

00:52:11.190 --> 00:52:12.190
at that time, where very favorable trade treaties
that they were basically dictating. They tried

00:52:12.190 --> 00:52:13.190
to do it in the South, but they were defeated
by the political power of Washington. And

00:52:13.190 --> 00:52:14.190
so, that maybe true, but the Southern tried,
you know, to put on the trade. And that's

00:52:14.190 --> 00:52:15.190
actually the way the North beat them was to
cut off the Southern trade routes. That's

00:52:15.190 --> 00:52:16.190
actually why cotton is grown in Egypt today
because the Brits couldn't get cotton from

00:52:16.190 --> 00:52:17.190
the South, so they planted it in Egypt where
they already had a colony. So, that is one

00:52:17.190 --> 00:52:18.190
of the reasons why the South was much very
poor after the war is that their main commodity,

00:52:18.190 --> 00:52:19.190
they have lost the market on it. And that
might be why those people in Atlanta are still

00:52:19.190 --> 00:52:20.190
bitter about it.
&gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Chris. This has been great.

00:52:20.190 --> 00:52:21.190
&gt;&gt; I have one more question. Does your book
attempt to explain what the heck General Sickles

00:52:21.190 --> 00:52:22.190
was doing on the second day at Gettysburg?
&gt;&gt; OATES: Sort of not really. Basically, in

00:52:22.190 --> 00:52:23.190
Gettysburg, the Union was—it was called
a fish hook, so, basically with one big line,

00:52:23.190 --> 00:52:24.190
Dan Sickles was at the end. He marched out
pretty far. And that's what got attacked and

00:52:24.190 --> 00:52:25.190
got driven back in and if it wasn't for the
fighting on the Round Top which is in the

00:52:25.190 --> 00:52:26.190
movie, Gettysburg, with Joshua Chamberlain,
they say the Union might have lost Gettysburg.

00:52:26.190 --> 00:52:27.190
The previous battle to that which was Chancellorsville,
Dan Sickles had the experience of being in

00:52:27.190 --> 00:52:28.190
the low ground, and having the Confederates
fighting by the high ground in front them.

00:52:28.190 --> 00:52:29.190
And then, just shell him, you know, shell
his lines to pieces and that bit of the Gettysburg

00:52:29.190 --> 00:52:30.190
ground. He was in the low bit, the whole line
was supposed to be on a ridge, but where Sickles

00:52:30.190 --> 00:52:31.190
was the ridge kind of died out. And in front
of him was very high ground. He was afraid

00:52:31.190 --> 00:52:32.190
that the same thing would happen. The Confederates
just walked up, get the high ground, shoot

00:52:32.190 --> 00:52:33.190
him and then, go. So, he took the high ground,
extending his lines directly contradicting

00:52:33.190 --> 00:52:34.190
an order from a superior. But, he later claimed
that by taking it even though his line was

00:52:34.190 --> 00:52:35.190
shattered and pushed back, he brought enough
time for the Union to form troops, and that

00:52:35.190 --> 00:52:36.190
if he had been pushed back to his original
position, and he would have been pushed back

00:52:36.190 --> 00:52:37.190
into defeat. So, I don't—I don't know if
that's true. Yeah, I think it's more on someone,

00:52:37.190 --> 00:52:38.190
so. But, that's—yeah, it's mentioned in
the book.

00:52:38.190 --> 00:52:39.190
&gt;&gt; I've finished reading the book compares
to the Two Players in the Attic, I don't know

00:52:39.190 --> 00:52:40.190
if you...
&gt;&gt; OATES: I've heard of it.

00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:41.190
&gt;&gt; But, it's a good [INDISTINCT] modern perception,
and so, probably of Civil War veteran perception.

00:52:41.190 --> 00:52:42.190
I'm wondering, how do you perceive Civil War
reenactment through the light of this novel,

00:52:42.190 --> 00:52:43.190
what's up with this novel?
&gt;&gt; OATES: I guess, I did I saw some books

00:52:43.190 --> 00:52:44.190
of Civil War reenactments. And you first,
you kind of think these guys are weird because

00:52:44.190 --> 00:52:45.190
they're dressing up, and they're shooting
up guns. But then you go there and you're

00:52:45.190 --> 00:52:46.190
like, they get to dress up and shoot up guns.
So, it's really cool, actually. I recommend

00:52:46.190 --> 00:52:47.190
you guys like attend one. It's actually a
lot of fun. I don't—I don't really, I can't

00:52:47.190 --> 00:52:48.190
go into like an analysis of that, I haven't
spent enough time, but...

00:52:48.190 --> 00:52:49.190
&gt;&gt; I mean, it's just only...
&gt;&gt; OATES: I just think it's kind of an interesting

00:52:49.190 --> 00:52:50.190
hobby that I have. And you know, it's better
than sitting around watching TV, so why not.

00:52:50.190 --> 00:52:51.190
And they also buy a lot of books. I really—I
really like you guys.

00:52:51.190 --> 00:52:52.190
&gt;&gt; I agree.
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much.

00:52:52.190 --> 00:52:52.193
&gt;&gt; OATES: Thank you.
