00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.780
These points would form a circle. I hope you knew that was coming. Great job if

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:10.718
you got it. When we think about a circle, we're really thinking about a

00:00:10.718 --> 00:00:15.968
particular relationship between any of the points. That is, the distance from

00:00:15.968 --> 00:00:21.396
any one of these points to the origin is always the same. In this case, any

00:00:21.396 --> 00:00:27.610
distance from the end point of a string to the origin represent 50 centimeters.

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:28.480
They're all constant.
