DANIEL ALEGRE: Good afternoon.

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:03.650
Thank you all for coming.

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:07.632
It is my incredible pleasure
to welcome Hiroshi "Mickey"

00:00:07.632 --> 00:00:11.200
Mikitani to Google yet again.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.310
He's been here on numerous,
numerous occasions, usually to

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:18.190
negotiate as hard as he possibly
can against me.

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:19.950
But this time actually
we're going to talk

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:22.000
about this his book.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.020
But Mickey is one of the most
worldly executives you're ever

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.310
going to come across.

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.320
I'll give you a little bit
of background on him.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.190
He was born in Kobe in Japan.

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:37.830
He is roughly my age,
though he looks

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:39.860
about 15 years younger.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.350
He attended Hitosubashi
University,

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.250
graduating in 1988.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.090
While working for the Industrial
Bank of Japan,

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:48.700
Mickey was transferred
to the US.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.610
And in 1983, studied at Harvard

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:54.660
University, earning an MBA.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.360
Correct me if I'm saying
anything wrong here.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.910
He worked at the Industrial Bank
of Japan from '88 to '96.

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.960
And his entrepreneurial
bug took hold.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.080
And it was in 1997 that he
decided to leave what was

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.130
going to be a very illustrious
career at the IBJ and founded

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.420
Rakuten, which is now the
third largest e-commerce

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.840
marketplace in the world, with
operations in over 12

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.940
countries across Europe, the
Americas, and in Asia.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.720
He's been president since
its founding.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.730
In 2001, became chairman.

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:31.590
He's also the head of the
e-commerce and banking

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.440
business units, head of
the development unit.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.070
He is director of Kobo, chairman
of Rakuten Card

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.490
Company, chairman of
Rakuten Travel.

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.270
His acquisitions throughout the
globe, including here in

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.730
the United States, Buy.com, Kobo
in Canada, PriceMinister

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:51.400
in France, and recent
investments in Pinterest.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.480
He has more than--

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.920
I know this number is now
outdated, more than 430,000

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.560
Twitter followers.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.440
Hiroshi Mickey Mikitani, and
welcome to Google, Mickey.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:01.690
HIROSHI MIKITANI: Thank you.

00:02:04.814 --> 00:02:08.479
So am I supposed to
introduce myself?

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.919
DANIEL ALEGRE: Yes, please do.

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:09.990
HIROSHI MIKITANI: OK.

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.620
So thank you for a great
introduction, Daniel.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.550
He has been my friend for
a long, long time.

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.590
The first time I acknowledged
him was at the business

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.740
conference in Singapore.

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.610
And I was on the stage
as a panel.

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:32.860
And so I basically described
as my future potential

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.810
competitor.

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.220
And somebody raised
their hand.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.680
And he said, he's very, very
disappointed that I said

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.700
Google can become
our competitor.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.030
But I think the internet is
evolving so rapidly and the

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.350
dynamics is so strong.

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:57.670
As Daniel introduced, I finally
left there in 1997 and

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.380
with five other younger
partners.

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:09.710
The difference between most
of the American start-ups,

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:13.770
internet ventures, and Rakuten,
is we started from

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:17.230
our own capital of
200,000 USD.

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.050
Never raised any
money from VC.

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.760
So if you're interested in
starting your company without

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.060
raising money from VC,
please email me.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:32.640
And went public in April
of year 2000.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.920
So we were the very last company
to catch the first

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.040
internet bubble to go public.

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:46.630
And the initial capitalization
of the market cap was about

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.610
the 3.7 billion USD.

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:55.410
We raised about $500 million
and immediately it crashed.

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:00.360
So we went public right
after the first

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.690
internet bubble crash.

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.630
But we managed to go public
and raise $500 million.

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.640
And then our market cap went
down to $5 million.

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.940
And it's now back to, I don't
know, $13 or $14.

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.760
It depends on the
exchange rate.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.450
It's changing so fast
these days.

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:26.510
The initial thinking of Rakuten
was how to help small

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:32.730
to medium size shops to sell
their product all over Japan.

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:37.870
Because there is a huge trend
of centralization of the

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.090
economy through [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.080
in Asia to Tokyo.

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:47.240
And it was very disappointing
to see all these small shops

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.320
in local town being shut down.

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:57.360
And we came up with the idea of
empowering small merchants

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.930
with what we call
the [JAPANESE]

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:08.240
of internet shop and create the
big marketplace, without

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.980
the deep knowledge about
the technology.

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:18.680
And we opened that store
on [JAPANESE]

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:23.200
in May of 1997.

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:28.780
And the first months our GND
gross transaction was about

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:33.060
3.7 USD, out of which
I was buying $2,000.

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:37.100
So there was just $1,000
of the transaction.

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:47.770
Now in Japan, we do about, how
much, about $16 to $17 billion

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:49.840
US dollars of transaction.

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:55.920
We have about 40,000 unique
shops, selling over 150

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.950
million SKUs.

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:03.420
The market share of e-commerce
in Japan is about 30%.

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:05.910
Our biggest competitor
over the company

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:09.290
now does about 13%.

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:15.150
And other than e-commerce,
we do internet travel--

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:17.150
we're number one--

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:22.000
online banking, and credit
card, online brokerage.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.400
And more than anything, we have

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:25.650
professional baseball team.

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:30.990
So one of the biggest
differences in Rakuten, than

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:36.010
the other internet companies, we
do the media, e-retailing,

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:36.900
including travel.

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:40.860
And we also have online
finance business.

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:44.840
So we use a balance sheet, not
just tracking the behavior of

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:46.060
the people.

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:49.770
We use all these data to analyze
the credibility of the

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:51.830
individuals.

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:56.600
We have about 81 million
members in Japan.

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.910
So about 90% of internet

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:01.990
populations are Rakuten members.

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:06.240
And now we use your program
very effectively

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:09.790
to retain the customers.

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:16.360
I decided to go global five
years ago and aggressively

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:20.190
building own business or buying

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:22.410
companies or creating JV.

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:26.180
I am very thrilled to be here
and looking forward to have a

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:28.500
deep discussion with you guys.

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:29.470
Thank you very much.

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:29.820
DANIEL ALEGRE: Great.

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:30.790
Thank you.

00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:32.040
Please have a seat, if you
don't mind, Mickey.

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:38.050
So I'll ask a few questions.

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:41.912
And then if anybody has any
questions, please do interrupt

00:07:41.912 --> 00:07:44.340
if you have any follow-ons
to the first question.

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:46.087
For those you haven't had a
chance to read "Marketplace

00:07:46.087 --> 00:07:52.210
3.0" that Mickey wrote, it has
some incredible nuggets of

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:55.080
wisdom and I think a lot
of similarities to

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:56.530
the way Google works.

00:07:56.530 --> 00:08:02.490
But particularly for a Japanese
company that has been

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:06.500
so successful in your home
country, for you to be able to

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:09.680
have such a global vision as
quickly as you did, as you

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:11.680
said in the last five years
you've made some very

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:14.860
significant not only
acquisitions, but also

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:19.940
start-ups throughout all of
Asia, what really got you to

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:22.490
think outside of Japanese
borders?

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:23.640
You're doing very
well in Japan.

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:25.240
Why not stop there?

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:29.420
HIROSHI MIKITANI: Well first of
all, of course the economy

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:31.040
is globalizing.

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:36.380
And I think mainly because of
the advancement of information

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:38.950
technology, the world has
become really flat.

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:45.585
And Japan used to have like 15%
of entire consumer market

00:08:45.585 --> 00:08:47.110
in the world.

00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:52.010
Now, it's down to single digit,
close to 6% or 7%.

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:56.970
And I'm sure that regardless of
how well we do, [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:56.970 --> 00:09:00.570
the share of the Japanese
consumer market will go down

00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:02.480
to somewhere between 3% to 5%.

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:07.030
So more 95% of the market will
be outside of Japan within 10

00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:08.500
to 20 years.

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:13.340
That means since I still own a
large portion of my company, I

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:14.680
better globalize my company.

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:16.090
That's one.

00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:22.580
Two, becoming global will give
us more global perspective

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:25.420
about where e-commerce
is going.

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:32.160
And I'm strong believer of the
diversity because there is so

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:35.080
many different views
and business models

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:35.930
all over the world.

00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:40.320
And to compete against them
and to be exposed to them,

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:42.970
will give us higher
perspective of

00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:45.420
where we should go.

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:45.870
DANIEL ALEGRE: Well.

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:50.140
I was talking to Karim, who runs
Asia Pacific at Google,

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:51.120
just before you walked in.

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:54.610
And we were talking about one
of the most difficult tasks

00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:59.750
that we have in Japan is to find
a Japanese executive who

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:05.220
speaks English well and who can
actually do well within

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:07.020
the Japanese business
environment.

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:12.280
And you took on something a
couple years ago that was

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:17.740
radical and maybe some people
would find somewhat offensive

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:23.110
to the Japanese culture, which
is to Englishize your office.

00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:23.450
HIROSHI MIKITANI: Yes.

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:27.740
DANIEL ALEGRE: Everybody
switched from being able to

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:32.160
speak Japanese, to the very
next day every business

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:36.490
meeting has to be
held in English.

00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:38.090
What was that like?

00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:39.920
HIROSHI MIKITANI: Well,
it's like US stocks.

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:41.670
It began [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:44.200
the case study of Harvard
Business School, now being

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:47.510
taught in the first year
[INAUDIBLE] class of most of

00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:50.540
the major business
schools globally.

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:54.450
So the language is not just
Japan specific issue, but I

00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:59.890
think it's a very globally
shared issue.

00:10:59.890 --> 00:11:07.750
But as you know, Japan is a very
advanced country in terms

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:09.080
of education.

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:13.090
But the English level of
Japanese is not that good.

00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:15.780
We are second from the
bottom in Asia.

00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:19.250
This is kind of a shame.

00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:23.610
And then the reason why we have
been so successful in

00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:28.220
Japan is we have been
cross-sharing our expertise

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:33.690
and key success factors across
the business units.

00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:36.920
Although it looks very different
from one business

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:40.290
unit to a different business
unit, like online brokerage,

00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:46.550
online travel, online shopping,
I think they have so

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:48.500
much similar ideas.

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:50.850
And the reason why Rakuten has
been successful is we are

00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:52.520
extremely open internally.

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:57.820
We share almost everything,
KPIs, the performance.

00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:00.740
This is very different from
American company, I think.

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:03.480
But I was trying to do the same
thing, but I couldn't

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:05.280
globally because of
the language.

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:10.050
And the only solution I thought
it may work is just

00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:12.150
speak one same language.

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:14.010
DANIEL ALEGRE: Who was more
reluctant, the French or the

00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:15.470
Japanese to speak English?

00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:20.700
HIROSHI MIKITANI: The Japanese,
unfortunately.

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:23.450
The Japanese are more stubborn
than French.

00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:24.300
DANIEL ALEGRE: Than French.

00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:26.600
HIROSHI MIKITANI: But I am
strong believer of Japanese

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:27.820
service mind.

00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:31.000
So that things about the
connections, creating new

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.060
connection of the Japanese
service mind.

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:35.050
But it's based on technology.

00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:37.370
DANIEL ALEGRE: You must have
gotten a lot of criticism

00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:39.830
within corporate circles
in Japan for doing

00:12:39.830 --> 00:12:42.300
this, or did you?

00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:44.410
HIROSHI MIKITANI: Well,
you were there.

00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:45.410
DANIEL ALEGRE: Well, I
was speaking English.

00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:46.610
I didn't speak the Japanese.

00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:49.870
But how did that impact
your decision?

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:51.530
What was your thought
process behind it?

00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:54.480
HIROSHI MIKITANI: Well, I just
tolds them to leave us alone.

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:56.250
It's none of your business.

00:12:56.250 --> 00:12:58.760
Some CEOs really attacked
me on the media,

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:00.670
that this guy is stupid.

00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:02.980
But now, everybody support it.

00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:04.910
As a matter of fact, I proposed
to the Prime Minister

00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:10.160
Abe that we should change
English entrance exam of

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:13.130
universities from
Japan-specific

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:17.550
translation-based grammar
oriented exam to the global

00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:19.100
test, which is TOEFL.

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:23.070
And basically, they kind of
agreed that they're going to

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:25.680
change within several years.

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:28.390
And I also asked them to we
should have a TOEFL for the

00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:29.510
bureaucrats as well.

00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:30.390
And they also agreed.

00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:32.620
So Japan is changing.

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:33.870
DANIEL ALEGRE: That's a great
way to change the bureaucrats.

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:39.070
Here at Google, we have
the concept of eating

00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:40.430
your own dog food.

00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:45.240
If you launch a product, then we
have to test it ourselves.

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:46.100
Did you eat your dog food?

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:49.100
Did your write this book in
English or in Japanese?

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:50.850
HIROSHI MIKITANI: I
wrote in English.

00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:52.715
And I think it's really
easy reading.

00:13:56.810 --> 00:13:59.050
Of course, I had
a great editor.

00:13:59.050 --> 00:13:59.926
DANIEL ALEGRE: Okay.

00:13:59.926 --> 00:14:02.130
You have a very interesting
story about a rice farmer in

00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:06.500
Japan using the marketplace
and how you got started.

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:10.090
And if you don't mind sharing
that story, I mean what that

00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:13.910
made you realize about the
power of the marketplace?

00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:19.310
HIROSHI MIKITANI: Well again,
initially, this is about 1977.

00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:21.960
Even this is before ADSL.

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:24.730
Many of the people didn't
know how to get

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:26.310
connected to the internet.

00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:28.180
And many of the Japanese people

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:30.230
didn't know how to type.

00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:38.520
So what we did is we installed
a PC, you know sign up with

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:41.930
ISP on behalf of
our merchants.

00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:45.860
And told them how to type
and create a shop.

00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:50.750
So one of the shop which
we had a contract

00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:53.490
was the rice shop.

00:14:53.490 --> 00:15:00.340
And his business obviously
was not integration,

00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:03.700
but he got into this.

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:09.390
He was so intrigued about the
PC, although it didn't look

00:15:09.390 --> 00:15:12.210
that great initially, but
he kept working on it.

00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:14.460
And of course his rice
was very good, so

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:16.100
he get really popular.

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:24.200
And then his son decided to come
back to his home town.

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:29.490
DANIEL ALEGRE: Now, it's really
fascinating when you'd

00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:33.380
meet Japanese with such a global
mindset and then more

00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:36.670
importantly such an
entrepreneurial mindset.

00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:41.000
You seem like you were on a
very well-written, done

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.550
before, but successful
career at the

00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:45.390
Industrial Bank of Japan.

00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:49.690
And something in you made you
turn away from corporate life

00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:53.440
and essentially start something
from scratch with no

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:58.580
venture capital funding, which
is somewhat rare in Japan.

00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:03.140
To what do you attribute that
virus of entrepreneurship

00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:04.800
that's inside of you?

00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:09.340
HIROSHI MIKITANI: Well, I think
from the beginning,

00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:13.290
Japanese was very
entrepreneurial.

00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:17.700
After World War II, Sony,
Panasonic totally took off.

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:20.290
And they are extremely
entrepreneurial.

00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:23.860
But through the
hyper-development period of

00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:28.780
our economy, they became really
conservative and big

00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:31.490
company mindset.

00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:35.880
And IBJ, that's the Bank of
Japan, was playing a leading

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:40.810
role in order to strategically
grow certain industries, such

00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:45.950
as steel, automobile, chemical,
and so forth.

00:16:45.950 --> 00:16:48.580
And I really liked the job.

00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:52.370
But I was kind of feeling
something is wrong and we are

00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:54.590
kind of left behind.

00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:56.310
And I went to business
school, Harvard

00:16:56.310 --> 00:16:59.570
Business School, in 1991.

00:16:59.570 --> 00:17:02.100
And before that, I didn't
even thought about

00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:03.840
starting my own company.

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:12.119
But I was influenced by the
true commitment to the

00:17:12.119 --> 00:17:16.430
entrepreneurship at Harvard
Business School and

00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:17.700
came back to Japan.

00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:22.239
DANIEL ALEGRE: Can
you describe what

00:17:22.239 --> 00:17:25.670
is the Rakuten Shugi?

00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:28.520
HIROSHI MIKITANI: It's basically
the Rakuten way.

00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:33.150
And it defines the mission.

00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:39.380
So where was the year I
was trying to buy TBS?

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:41.650
It was like six, seven
years ago.

00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:42.070
DANIEL ALEGRE: Yes.

00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:45.890
HIROSHI MIKITANI: So I thought
we should change TV industry.

00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:50.840
And we did a hostile takeover
action against the most

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:54.800
prestigious TV station
in Japan called TBS.

00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:57.330
And I got a huge backlash
from the media.

00:17:57.330 --> 00:17:59.000
The media really hated me.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.090
And they tried to
really crash up.

00:18:02.090 --> 00:18:08.550
And at that time, my father gave
me like five principles

00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:11.980
that you need to stick in order
to make a big change.

00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:19.970
And it became the sort of a
corporate brand, sort of a

00:18:19.970 --> 00:18:22.100
definition of the
corporate brand.

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:26.040
And it increased something
like you needed the big

00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:31.270
mission and the sense of high
integrating, a sense of

00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:35.350
teamwork, and so forth as far as
we define some of the very

00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:39.950
basic practices we share.

00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:42.010
DANIEL ALEGRE: So I'll highlight
a few of them that

00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:43.610
you talk about in the book.

00:18:43.610 --> 00:18:46.950
One, always improve and always
advance; be passionately

00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:51.580
professional; hypothesize,
practice, validate, shikumika,

00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:55.230
which is systematize; maximize
customer satisfaction; and

00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:57.180
speed, speed, speed.

00:18:57.180 --> 00:18:59.920
I'd like to touch on one of
those, always improve and

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:00.540
always advance.

00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:03.640
There's a quote in the book that
I love, which is myself

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:06.910
of today will triumph over
myself of yesterday.

00:19:06.910 --> 00:19:09.450
Can you tell people in
the audience what the

00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:12.140
Mikitani curve is?

00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:15.460
HIROSHI MIKITANI: So especially
on the internet,

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:19.840
there are so many similar
services, right?

00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:23.650
In terms of search, you had
Yahoo, you had Inktomi, and

00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:24.530
you had Google.

00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:30.580
So what made the difference is
immediately the very last

00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:37.230
effort and adhesive--

00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:42.520
the commitment to the
details to improve.

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:49.530
And we're in the retail
business.

00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:51.540
Our core business is
internet shopping.

00:19:51.540 --> 00:19:55.630
And all these small details
really matters.

00:19:55.630 --> 00:20:00.150
And the beauty of internet is
that you can always improve.

00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:04.560
Even if the first launch, the
big launch is not perfect, but

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:06.760
you can constantly improve.

00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:13.380
So it's really important for us
to make this final 0.5% of

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:19.320
last effort to make it as
perfect as possible and keep

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:20.890
improving it.

00:20:20.890 --> 00:20:22.630
DANIEL ALEGRE: So the concept
is do your best,

00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:25.374
then do 0.5% more.

00:20:25.374 --> 00:20:26.270
HIROSHI MIKITANI:
I suppose so.

00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:27.350
DANIEL ALEGRE: That's the
Mikitani curve, right?

00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:28.900
I had never heard of that,
but I like the way

00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:30.440
you think about it.

00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:35.260
But would you say that
throughout all of Rakuten

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:40.030
globally, this concept of I am
constantly needing to improve

00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:42.210
myself, and what I did yesterday
is not enough and I

00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:47.960
want to prove myself today from
the Daniel of yesterday,

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:50.800
how do you turn that into a
culture, into a living,

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:54.450
operational way of
doing business?

00:20:54.450 --> 00:21:00.350
HIROSHI MIKITANI: That is why I
felt we need to convert the

00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:04.050
internal communication language
in Japan to English

00:21:04.050 --> 00:21:10.060
because I felt there is a big
cultural gap between Japan and

00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:11.460
other countries.

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:16.940
And it was kind of difficult to
really create the same kind

00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:18.960
of the culture.

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:21.850
As you know, Japanese people
are extremely hard working.

00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:27.360
And they have a extremely high
level sense of teamwork.

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:30.500
But we couldn't really transfer

00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:32.820
those to other countries.

00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:38.500
And now, I think we're in a
process of gradually basically

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:45.450
transferring those culture
to other countries.

00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:47.020
DANIEL ALEGRE: We've got
Francois here, who runs our

00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:49.310
small and medium-sized
business globally.

00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:53.910
And one of the areas that we've
been focused on is how

00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:57.460
to increase service, service for
our customers, whether the

00:21:57.460 --> 00:22:00.290
largest, all the way down
to the smallest?

00:22:00.290 --> 00:22:04.060
What is omotenashi and what
does it mean to Rakuten?

00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:06.890
HIROSHI MIKITANI: Well,
omotenashi is really the

00:22:06.890 --> 00:22:08.680
Japanese hospitality.

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:10.800
You care about Japanese
people.

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:15.460
And Japanese society has a
embedded culture of a high

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:19.090
level of hospitality.

00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:22.460
We're not talking about going
to the Mischelin three-star

00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:23.760
restaurants.

00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:27.650
Even if you go to the
convenience store or the

00:22:27.650 --> 00:22:32.900
discount store, or you get onto
the bus or get into taxi,

00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:36.880
you feel the high level
of hospitality.

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:42.030
And I felt the internet is a
tool which we can amplify

00:22:42.030 --> 00:22:45.970
those hospitality to the mass,
instead of trying to

00:22:45.970 --> 00:22:50.970
standardize everything
and make it just

00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:53.730
convenient and efficient.

00:22:53.730 --> 00:22:57.710
Well, as for internet shopping,
of course price and

00:22:57.710 --> 00:23:01.890
convenience and product line-up

00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:04.160
is very, very important.

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:06.750
But I feel shopping is
not just about that.

00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:10.080
It's a very important
part of your life.

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:12.730
And that's why people like to
go to the small boutiques or

00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:15.320
go to a small shop
to buy stuff.

00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:21.760
And I thought we can basically
scale those experiences to the

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:23.740
mass by using the internet.

00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:27.160
So that's why I think kind
of omotenashi, Japanese

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:31.820
hospitality mindset is going to
be more and more important

00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:33.150
for internet.

00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:38.020
And I just don't want to bring
the convenience and

00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:39.770
efficiency to you.

00:23:39.770 --> 00:23:43.340
But I would like to create
richness to you life through

00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:45.920
internet shopping.

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:47.620
DANIEL ALEGRE: What I found
fascinating again about your

00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:52.620
book is how focused you are on
building that culture that

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:56.350
embodies omoetenashi, that at
every single level of the

00:23:56.350 --> 00:24:00.360
organization people do believe
in the mantra of service,

00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:03.380
servicing your customer,
service

00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:05.480
other Rakuten employees.

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:10.070
Would you say that if I were to
go to France or to Canada

00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:13.080
or here in the US, where you've
acquired companies,

00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:16.160
that there is that level of
attention to service that you

00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:19.030
see in Japan or do you do
Americans expect a different

00:24:19.030 --> 00:24:22.610
level of service than you would
in a country like Japan?

00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:24.650
HIROSHI MIKITANI:
Well, maybe not.

00:24:24.650 --> 00:24:30.350
But that is why we can bring
more how to go--

00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:35.400
emotional surprise
to the consumer.

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:37.400
The Japanese people--

00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:41.470
as you know, the Japanese
consumers are extremely picky,

00:24:41.470 --> 00:24:44.680
not only for the service, but
for the quality of the product

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:47.130
and the quality of
the service.

00:24:47.130 --> 00:24:53.690
And so I'm sure that Google
people feel the same way.

00:24:53.690 --> 00:24:55.740
Consider the service, if you
can become successful in

00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:57.840
Japan, you can become successful
in other countries

00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:00.974
because Japanese consumer
is so picky.

00:25:00.974 --> 00:25:09.520
And that's why if we can bring
a Japanese level of the high

00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:14.610
hospitality and high service
to other countries, we can

00:25:14.610 --> 00:25:18.480
differentiate ourselves more.

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:21.600
DANIEL ALEGRE: How do you
differentiate or how do you

00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:23.190
characterize a successful--

00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:25.760
because you've been very
aggressive in acquisitions

00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:28.060
recently at a global pace--

00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:30.630
between a successful
acquisition and a

00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:31.870
non-successful acquisition?

00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:35.625
I think Tokyo Broadcasting is
an example of something that

00:25:35.625 --> 00:25:37.750
has not worked out.

00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:40.580
What have you learned from your
failures and what have

00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:43.830
you learned from your successes,
as you go around

00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:46.220
the globe in acquiring
companies?

00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:49.330
HIROSHI MIKITANI: Well, of
course, after all you need to

00:25:49.330 --> 00:25:51.360
have a financial
positive return

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:52.530
when you buy the company.

00:25:52.530 --> 00:25:56.260
So the primary measurement
should be your financial

00:25:56.260 --> 00:25:59.800
performance, either
through the gain

00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:01.810
or through the synergy.

00:26:01.810 --> 00:26:07.410
Or sometimes you can hire more
talented people in the team to

00:26:07.410 --> 00:26:09.400
[INAUDIBLE].

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:15.630
But I think more than that, the
cultural fit is extremely

00:26:15.630 --> 00:26:18.830
important for longer term.

00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:22.360
Because if you have a different
culture in one

00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:25.660
organization, I think you are
going to lose the balance in

00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:27.740
the future.

00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:29.180
DANIEL ALEGRE: As again
part of the

00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:32.806
cultural fit, one of the--

00:26:32.806 --> 00:26:35.790
I learned this through
the book--

00:26:35.790 --> 00:26:38.230
having pride in your own
company and in your own

00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:43.830
business, how every Tuesday
everyone has to completely

00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:47.410
clean out and clean above
and below their desk.

00:26:47.410 --> 00:26:50.845
And no matter how low under the
desk you have to go, it

00:26:50.845 --> 00:26:54.570
has to be completely clean
and completely spotless.

00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:55.580
Do you clean your desk?

00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:56.710
HIROSHI MIKITANI: Yes.

00:26:56.710 --> 00:26:56.890
DANIEL ALEGRE: You do.

00:26:56.890 --> 00:26:59.500
HIROSHI MIKITANI: Thank
you for asking.

00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:01.600
DANIEL ALEGRE: I'm going down
the dog food questions.

00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:03.760
And is this something
that you have now

00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:05.090
instituted across the globe?

00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:05.570
HIROSHI MIKITANI: Yes.

00:27:05.570 --> 00:27:09.280
In some countries, we're in
still the process, because

00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:10.280
there is a culture gap.

00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:15.640
But I just feel that I want
everybody to feel your company

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:18.450
and your office is your
daytime house.

00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:22.110
And if you have dust on your
floor in your house, you're

00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:23.530
going to pick it up.

00:27:23.530 --> 00:27:28.660
So I think we need to remind
ourselves that this is our

00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:31.880
house for daytime.

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:35.180
But whatever, please do not
misunderstand, we hire

00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:38.050
professional cleaners as well.

00:27:38.050 --> 00:27:40.140
It's just a five or 10
minutes practice.

00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:48.940
DANIEL ALEGRE: But as a result,
do you feel that it

00:27:48.940 --> 00:27:53.390
gets people to feel ownership
over their job, over the

00:27:53.390 --> 00:27:57.800
happiness and fulfillment that
goes with their job, and also

00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:00.110
the service that they're
delivering, not only to the

00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:02.760
person sitting next to you, you
don't want someone with a

00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:07.240
dirty desk next to you, but also
it manifests itself in

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:09.740
the way they interact with
customers as well?

00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:14.470
HIROSHI MIKITANI: Well, the
different way to look at this

00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:23.720
is whenever I go to the company,
which is dirty, they

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:24.970
tend to be not very
successful.

00:28:29.599 --> 00:28:30.080
DANIEL ALEGRE: Sorry.

00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:32.930
There was a piece of
dirt on the ground.

00:28:32.930 --> 00:28:33.385
HIROSHI MIKITANI: I'm
not talking if

00:28:33.385 --> 00:28:34.210
it's one or two desk.

00:28:34.210 --> 00:28:39.930
But in general like in single
office, there's lots of dirt

00:28:39.930 --> 00:28:44.240
on the chair and a lot
of dirt on the desk.

00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:47.995
And I just feel very
uncomfortable.

00:28:53.570 --> 00:28:54.983
I haven't got to talk
about this, so this

00:28:54.983 --> 00:28:56.220
is the first time.

00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:59.560
So let me try.

00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:04.810
There's one Japanese, how do you
call, auto parts retailer,

00:29:04.810 --> 00:29:10.570
which the CEO cleans up the
bathroom by himself every

00:29:10.570 --> 00:29:11.440
single day.

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:12.700
DANIEL ALEGRE: Very good.

00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:17.160
HIROSHI MIKITANI: And the
company is very extremely

00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:17.570
successful.

00:29:17.570 --> 00:29:19.740
I don't know just
because of that.

00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:21.280
I'm not following that.

00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:27.000
It tells how the
CEO is serious.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:31.030
And many Japanese company, not
only in clean up jobs, we

00:29:31.030 --> 00:29:36.330
clean up the areas around
our building.

00:29:36.330 --> 00:29:41.510
Every quarter, we have the
volunteer clean up.

00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:47.890
And I feel that it's just
five, 10 minutes.

00:29:47.890 --> 00:29:52.460
If somebody kind of disagree
with spending five minutes to

00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:57.320
clean up your desk, I feel
uncomfortable working with

00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:58.300
that person.

00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:01.370
Because again, we're hiring
professional cleaners as well.

00:30:04.810 --> 00:30:07.630
DANIEL ALEGRE: And what you do
if I don't have my desk clean?

00:30:07.630 --> 00:30:08.610
HIROSHI MIKITANI: I will
teach you how to clean.

00:30:08.610 --> 00:30:11.660
DANIEL ALEGRE: OK, good.

00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:15.620
You have a comment here
that the internet is

00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:17.930
not a vending machine.

00:30:17.930 --> 00:30:22.440
And you show the difference
between the Amazon model,

00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:27.550
which is all about efficiency
and cost, versus e-commerce as

00:30:27.550 --> 00:30:29.960
a joyful experience,
as having fun.

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:30.840
What do you mean by that?

00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:31.760
What do you mean by
the internet is

00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:33.700
not a vending machine?

00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:37.130
HIROSHI MIKITANI: Well if you
come to Rakuten, for example

00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:43.790
we have a minimum level of
standardization for these

00:30:43.790 --> 00:30:44.975
experience.

00:30:44.975 --> 00:30:48.770
But at the same time, each
shop can create a totally

00:30:48.770 --> 00:30:52.140
different touch and
feel and design.

00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:56.830
And we let them get connected
to the end customer.

00:30:56.830 --> 00:30:59.780
So they can create
a mailing list.

00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:01.360
Of course, they can do
a straight basket.

00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:03.580
They can do private sales.

00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:05.120
They can do couponing.

00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:06.750
That they can do auction.

00:31:06.750 --> 00:31:12.420
We enable them to do build a
Facebook store, for example.

00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:15.770
So we are trying to really
facilitate the connection

00:31:15.770 --> 00:31:19.000
between the merchant
and the customer.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:24.050
And the reason why Rakuten
is so strong is we are an

00:31:24.050 --> 00:31:27.070
aggregation of 40,000
merchants.

00:31:27.070 --> 00:31:30.420
And those merchant are
the best curators.

00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:33.960
Because if you want to buy for
example a tennis racquet, do

00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:37.430
you want to ask your friend who
is good at tennis or do

00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:40.950
you want to ask the staff
at the pro shop?

00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:42.640
I'm a reasonably good
tennis player.

00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:46.730
But I don't know about the
female racquet at all.

00:31:46.730 --> 00:31:52.810
But we have professional
curators.

00:31:52.810 --> 00:31:58.110
And again, they have a very
high level of hospitality.

00:31:58.110 --> 00:32:01.930
Sometimes they handwrite
the letter and

00:32:01.930 --> 00:32:04.610
put it into the box.

00:32:04.610 --> 00:32:12.130
And those kind of sort of a
human touch to the internet

00:32:12.130 --> 00:32:18.990
shopping experience is what we
feel very, very important.

00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:21.390
DANIEL ALEGRE: So when you're
looking at acquisitions, I

00:32:21.390 --> 00:32:23.620
think one of the things they
say is learn from local

00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:24.840
success stories.

00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:26.840
And here in the United
States, a local

00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:28.620
success story is Amazon.

00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:30.920
Why do you think Amazon has been
so successful here in the

00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:34.590
United States and how are you
going to be able to compete

00:32:34.590 --> 00:32:35.690
against Amazon?

00:32:35.690 --> 00:32:38.100
HIROSHI MIKITANI: Well, first of
all, I don't think there is

00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:43.930
going to be one single company
dominating 100% of e-commerce.

00:32:43.930 --> 00:32:47.200
I think there will be several
different models.

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:57.430
And this is so large and it's
too complicated to simply

00:32:57.430 --> 00:33:01.610
generalize with one single
business model.

00:33:01.610 --> 00:33:04.210
And the reason they have
been so successful is

00:33:04.210 --> 00:33:04.740
they are very good.

00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:05.990
They are very good at--

00:33:08.670 --> 00:33:16.110
again, a very efficient user
experience, the price

00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:17.815
competitive, and they're
very good at logistics.

00:33:20.510 --> 00:33:22.920
So for internet shopping, there
is three components

00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:27.060
which I think is critical,
product selection, the price,

00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:28.800
and logistics.

00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:32.670
And on top of that, we have some
capitalist factors, such

00:33:32.670 --> 00:33:37.580
as the user experience
and the sense of

00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:39.550
security and so forth.

00:33:39.550 --> 00:33:44.910
So [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:44.910 --> 00:33:49.590
because you have competitive
price, competitive product

00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:54.320
line now, and competitive
logistic service.

00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:56.620
But this is going to
be a commodity.

00:33:56.620 --> 00:33:58.210
I know Google is
working on it.

00:33:58.210 --> 00:34:00.390
Other companies are
working on it.

00:34:00.390 --> 00:34:03.440
And in the future, this will
become the shared commodity

00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:04.990
service I think.

00:34:04.990 --> 00:34:09.960
So what's going to be the
biggest differentiator is the

00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:15.120
user experience and the other
practice I think.

00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:16.350
DANIEL ALEGRE: So what
is discovery

00:34:16.350 --> 00:34:17.199
shopping for you then?

00:34:17.199 --> 00:34:17.989
What does that mean?

00:34:17.989 --> 00:34:19.620
HIROSHI MIKITANI: Discovery
shopping, again--

00:34:19.620 --> 00:34:24.760
so the e-commerce community has
been really focusing on

00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:29.500
the transaction process
of the shopping.

00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:31.620
You know what you want to buy.

00:34:31.620 --> 00:34:33.460
Of course, you have the
recommendation and the search

00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:34.860
and other many things.

00:34:34.860 --> 00:34:40.110
But mostly, everybody focus on
check-out process and delivery

00:34:40.110 --> 00:34:41.460
of the product.

00:34:41.460 --> 00:34:44.679
But more and more, as you can
see the Pinterest, of course

00:34:44.679 --> 00:34:50.360
Google is working on it, but the
creation of the demand, or

00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:55.610
the creation of the trend will
become more valuable and more

00:34:55.610 --> 00:35:00.750
important from now on I think.

00:35:00.750 --> 00:35:01.450
DANIEL ALEGRE: I completely
agree.

00:35:01.450 --> 00:35:03.210
So I'd like to open it up for
questions, if there are any

00:35:03.210 --> 00:35:06.790
questions from the audience?

00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:11.010
Is there a microphone that
we've got going on?

00:35:11.010 --> 00:35:11.290
Sorry.

00:35:11.290 --> 00:35:12.740
Do you might identifying
yourself

00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:13.230
and asking you question?

00:35:13.230 --> 00:35:13.470
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:35:13.470 --> 00:35:16.440
My name is Momousa and I work
with Google Enterprise.

00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:20.010
One thing I noticed while I was
in Japan, there is very

00:35:20.010 --> 00:35:23.620
low tolerance for things that
get started that are not

00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:25.030
excellent from the get-go.

00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:27.690
And while in the US and
especially at Google, we have

00:35:27.690 --> 00:35:29.770
a culture of launch and
iterate, you just keep

00:35:29.770 --> 00:35:33.590
improving over time until it
becomes excellent, but that's

00:35:33.590 --> 00:35:37.270
not really usually what gets
accepted in Japan, especially

00:35:37.270 --> 00:35:38.780
in the consumer market.

00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:43.270
So how can you be competitive
if you're not doing this

00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:47.880
experimentation and not getting
to excellence from the

00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:50.620
get-go, because it saves
you a lot of time if

00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:52.630
you just keep improving?

00:35:52.630 --> 00:35:55.230
HIROSHI MIKITANI: I completely
agree with you.

00:35:55.230 --> 00:36:00.380
And I would like to know the
secrets of how to overcome

00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:01.300
those issues.

00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:09.460
And yes, Japanese people are
extremely critical against the

00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:12.600
initial launch of the
service as well.

00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:16.650
In the past, we made several
failures to be very honest.

00:36:16.650 --> 00:36:20.720
And it's kind of difficult
to come back.

00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:22.780
But you need to be patient.

00:36:22.780 --> 00:36:30.390
And I think in these days you
need to be open about all

00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:34.970
these, how do you call it,
shortcomings and the mistakes

00:36:34.970 --> 00:36:39.060
and very candid about it.

00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:43.670
So some US company says this
is better service.

00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:48.850
Why are you criticizing us so
much, kind of mentality.

00:36:48.850 --> 00:36:53.310
But I think in Japan, I
don't know why, but it

00:36:53.310 --> 00:36:54.170
doesn't work that way.

00:36:54.170 --> 00:37:02.110
I think you need to be, how do
you call it, closer to the

00:37:02.110 --> 00:37:07.330
final perfect service
before the launch.

00:37:07.330 --> 00:37:09.920
AUDIENCE: I guess as a quick
follow-up, in collaboration

00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:12.600
with international acquisitions
and things like

00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:15.990
that, so at Google for example,
we share a document

00:37:15.990 --> 00:37:18.860
with other team members
and then we keep

00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:20.600
improving on that document.

00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:23.670
I especially pay very special
attention when I'm sharing

00:37:23.670 --> 00:37:26.460
with a Japanese co-worker
because they expect a

00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:30.610
super-high level of quality,
not something that is

00:37:30.610 --> 00:37:31.560
growing over time.

00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:37.110
So I guess how do you enforce or
enable better collaboration

00:37:37.110 --> 00:37:39.630
between the Japanese employees
and the international

00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:41.180
counterparts?

00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:47.540
HIROSHI MIKITANI: So the first
step was this language, the

00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:51.370
project to communicate
in English.

00:37:51.370 --> 00:37:57.790
And two, I think not only just
sharing online, but really

00:37:57.790 --> 00:38:02.510
having a face-to-face
interaction is a very, very

00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:03.650
important I feel.

00:38:03.650 --> 00:38:07.670
That we need to build
the sense of team.

00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:11.280
And at the same time, I think
what is important is to

00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:17.050
educate, knowing the Japanese,
the engineers and the product

00:38:17.050 --> 00:38:21.240
managers in Japan has a
different expectation for

00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:23.025
level of the service.

00:38:26.210 --> 00:38:28.820
DANIEL ALEGRE: Do you reward
smart failure?

00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:29.770
HIROSHI MIKITANI: Of course.

00:38:29.770 --> 00:38:30.660
Of course, yes.

00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:33.120
DANIEL ALEGRE: How do you
do that in Japan?

00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:41.860
HIROSHI MIKITANI: Well first of
all, we have never punished

00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:48.240
the failure, unless it's the
intentional misconduct.

00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:52.340
Of course, we had some
system down.

00:38:52.340 --> 00:38:54.290
We had a big fraud [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:54.290 --> 00:38:55.340
in the past.

00:38:55.340 --> 00:39:02.270
But we never really punished
the mistake.

00:39:02.270 --> 00:39:06.580
But I think encouraging--

00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:10.450
we have the sort of
award every month.

00:39:10.450 --> 00:39:13.810
We give the [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:13.810 --> 00:39:16.690
award to many, many people.

00:39:16.690 --> 00:39:21.400
And we encourage
the sort of new

00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:24.420
innovation and new creation.

00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:27.740
AUDIENCE: Hi, Mickey.

00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:28.690
My name is Tony Kam.

00:39:28.690 --> 00:39:31.180
I'm responsible for working
with the US team.

00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:32.550
So I'm with [INAUDIBLE]
and [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:34.580
They have been great to us.

00:39:34.580 --> 00:39:37.210
I have a request and
a question for you.

00:39:37.210 --> 00:39:37.920
HIROSHI MIKITANI: Request, OK.

00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:40.000
AUDIENCE: The rumor is that
you're talking to the Dodgers

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:41.720
for potential ownership.

00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:43.090
We love the Giants here.

00:39:43.090 --> 00:39:46.210
Would you consider perhaps
a different team?

00:39:46.210 --> 00:39:49.940
We don't want them to have
better ownership there.

00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:52.770
My question is where do you
find your inspiration?

00:39:52.770 --> 00:39:55.770
You have some very different
idea, not very

00:39:55.770 --> 00:39:57.010
conventional ideas.

00:39:57.010 --> 00:39:59.390
How do you find your inspiration
along the way and

00:39:59.390 --> 00:40:02.750
how do you test them
along the way?

00:40:02.750 --> 00:40:06.340
HIROSHI MIKITANI: Well, it's a
difficult question because I

00:40:06.340 --> 00:40:08.680
never been the other person.

00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:11.920
And this is a very
natural for me.

00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:18.440
But I think it's all about
applying something you've seen

00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:22.670
in a different environment
to other fields and

00:40:22.670 --> 00:40:27.550
cross-applying the same
theory to it.

00:40:27.550 --> 00:40:31.230
And if you think about like
shopping, you need to step

00:40:31.230 --> 00:40:35.540
back and think why people buy
product, instead of thinking

00:40:35.540 --> 00:40:37.820
about how we can
compete against

00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:40.200
Amazon in terms of price.

00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:42.060
I think stepping back, standing

00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:45.020
back, and having this--

00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:45.290
holistic?

00:40:45.290 --> 00:40:46.260
DANIEL ALEGRE: Holistic.

00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:51.130
HIROSHI MIKITANI: --view
of the scene is

00:40:51.130 --> 00:40:52.500
very important I think.

00:40:55.470 --> 00:40:57.880
I don't know why, but
I have that kind of

00:40:57.880 --> 00:41:00.820
the habit and tendency.

00:41:00.820 --> 00:41:01.490
AUDIENCE: My name is Joel.

00:41:01.490 --> 00:41:03.880
I work on Google's new
product and service.

00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:09.900
So product listing ads is one
product that we're supporting.

00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:11.630
So I guess my question
has two part.

00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:15.210
One part is about the general
challenges for Rakuten itself.

00:41:15.210 --> 00:41:18.010
Like what do you think is the
main challenge for Rakuten,

00:41:18.010 --> 00:41:20.960
especially for example we talk
about competitions, like

00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:23.180
Google has its product
listing ads.

00:41:23.180 --> 00:41:25.320
I'm looking at the revenues
growing very fast.

00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:28.430
And what is other like
sorts of competition

00:41:28.430 --> 00:41:29.810
you can think of?

00:41:29.810 --> 00:41:32.630
And my second question is about
the opportunity for

00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:33.230
e-commerce.

00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:35.870
Because we know e-commerce has
been there for a long time,

00:41:35.870 --> 00:41:38.340
like I don't know, over
15 years probably.

00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:41.510
So what is new opportunities you
can think of e-commerce in

00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:43.190
general, for all
the companies?

00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:45.930
Like I really like to talk about
like taking for example,

00:41:45.930 --> 00:41:48.780
like in personal, more customer
service like the

00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:50.110
purchasing experience.

00:41:50.110 --> 00:41:53.230
And also you keep [INAUDIBLE]
more experience to personalize

00:41:53.230 --> 00:41:54.850
the way that they
sell products.

00:41:54.850 --> 00:41:57.580
But are there other
opportunities you can think of

00:41:57.580 --> 00:41:59.300
for e-commerce in general?

00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:01.030
Thank you.

00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:04.230
HIROSHI MIKITANI: First of all,
I think there are so many

00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:06.920
rooms for improvement
for Rakuten.

00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:10.660
And basically now we
are building our

00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:13.350
own logistic network.

00:42:13.350 --> 00:42:17.620
And we are building our last
one-mile delivery.

00:42:17.620 --> 00:42:20.930
I think we will be able
to do this in Japan.

00:42:20.930 --> 00:42:22.810
The question is whether we
can do this in other

00:42:22.810 --> 00:42:24.180
countries or not?

00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:26.750
Japan is relatively
dense country.

00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:29.680
It is a little bit larger the
size of California and we have

00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:31.920
130 million population
and delivery network

00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:32.640
is reasonably good.

00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:34.210
So we can do it.

00:42:34.210 --> 00:42:38.770
But if you go to other
countries, can we do as good

00:42:38.770 --> 00:42:42.390
logistic service, including in
the future last one-mile

00:42:42.390 --> 00:42:45.370
delivery or not?

00:42:45.370 --> 00:42:49.110
I think it's totally different
scale of story and we need to

00:42:49.110 --> 00:42:50.820
consider that.

00:42:50.820 --> 00:42:54.070
For the future opportunity,
I everybody talk

00:42:54.070 --> 00:42:55.920
about social shopping.

00:42:55.920 --> 00:43:03.170
And whether we can figure it out
to really how we can scale

00:43:03.170 --> 00:43:07.430
the social shopping or
not is really the

00:43:07.430 --> 00:43:10.000
opportunity and challenge.

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:13.870
That is the reason why we
invested in Pinterest.

00:43:13.870 --> 00:43:15.280
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:17.560
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much
for your time and your

00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:18.630
openness to talk to us here.

00:43:18.630 --> 00:43:19.130
I'm Manny.

00:43:19.130 --> 00:43:22.140
I work in our global team.

00:43:22.140 --> 00:43:24.090
I'm from Europe and
Play.com is one

00:43:24.090 --> 00:43:25.220
of my favorite websites.

00:43:25.220 --> 00:43:27.300
And I think what's amazing about
it is that it has free

00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:29.100
deliveries wherever
you are in Europe.

00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:31.700
And really, it has been a reason
to not buy anywhere

00:43:31.700 --> 00:43:34.630
else just because of this, even
though potentially it can

00:43:34.630 --> 00:43:36.660
be more expensive.

00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:38.690
How come the global [INAUDIBLE]
still haven't sold

00:43:38.690 --> 00:43:43.040
this delivery issue yet?s I
mean, it's maybe a follow-up

00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:44.355
on the previous question.

00:43:44.355 --> 00:43:49.170
But it's incredible that some
companies and some sites can

00:43:49.170 --> 00:43:51.110
offer completely free delivery
to wherever you are in the

00:43:51.110 --> 00:43:55.220
world, whereas you can pay
almost 30% to 40% of whatever

00:43:55.220 --> 00:43:57.535
your price is for the same
delivery in another company.

00:43:57.535 --> 00:44:01.370
I mean how come that this is
still such a big issue in the

00:44:01.370 --> 00:44:03.660
e-commerce world?

00:44:03.660 --> 00:44:06.480
HIROSHI MIKITANI: Well, so even
if you say free shipping,

00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:09.000
the question is is it really
shipping or not, right?

00:44:14.430 --> 00:44:19.350
Unless you find some arbitrage
opportunity by bundling or

00:44:19.350 --> 00:44:24.330
some creative way to make
your cost structure more

00:44:24.330 --> 00:44:25.840
competitive than
against other--

00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:30.910
it's really automation, for
example, or something--

00:44:30.910 --> 00:44:34.700
then you can absorb the
cost into your gross

00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:36.980
margin of your product.

00:44:36.980 --> 00:44:44.300
And that has not been
proven yet I think.

00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:49.150
So if you just keep buying
toothbrush, one toothbrush

00:44:49.150 --> 00:44:54.780
every single day, you're going
to be extremely unprofitable.

00:44:54.780 --> 00:44:59.720
So I think we need to
find a way to make

00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:02.720
economically work for that.

00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:05.760
And I think that's very,
very challenging.

00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:07.690
Because it's not free
as a matter of fact

00:45:07.690 --> 00:45:09.570
for the service provider.

00:45:09.570 --> 00:45:11.400
That means it's not
fundamentally

00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:13.050
free for the end customer.

00:45:13.050 --> 00:45:19.180
You are either paying the
membership fee, annual

00:45:19.180 --> 00:45:22.160
membership fee, like
Amazon Prime.

00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:29.160
Or your are basically paying a
higher price fundamentally

00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:35.630
speaking or maybe you are
getting other sort of a profit

00:45:35.630 --> 00:45:39.490
source for the service
provider.

00:45:39.490 --> 00:45:43.560
And that's all about
I think arbitrage.

00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:44.400
AUDIENCE: Hi, Mickey.

00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:45.310
My name is Jerry.

00:45:45.310 --> 00:45:48.200
I work in People Ops.

00:45:48.200 --> 00:45:50.110
I'm from Indonesia.

00:45:50.110 --> 00:45:53.550
And in the last couple years,
I've seen a lot of start-ups

00:45:53.550 --> 00:45:56.580
in Indonesia who tried to
provide online shopping

00:45:56.580 --> 00:45:57.540
service in Indonesia.

00:45:57.540 --> 00:46:00.860
And there hasn't been
much success.

00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:03.290
I mean there are a couple
of big ones.

00:46:03.290 --> 00:46:07.370
But a lot of the small ones
are trying hard, but they

00:46:07.370 --> 00:46:09.600
haven't been very successful.

00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:14.750
How do you envision Rakuten's
plan in Southeast Asia in the

00:46:14.750 --> 00:46:17.500
next five to 10 years?

00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:21.560
HIROSHI MIKITANI: I think the
Southeast Asia has opportunity

00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:26.140
to leapfrog the development
of the physical retail

00:46:26.140 --> 00:46:27.500
infrastructure.

00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:31.620
Like if you go there, they
leapfrog the fixed line

00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:34.980
internet and just jump
onto the smartphones.

00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:39.780
And the same thing can happen
to the retail as

00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:43.290
well, because it still--

00:46:43.290 --> 00:46:44.990
of course, there are massive

00:46:44.990 --> 00:46:47.710
development going on in Jakarta.

00:46:47.710 --> 00:46:51.780
But if you go to newer areas,
it's relatively weak.

00:46:51.780 --> 00:46:54.870
So for them, probably internet
and retail will become their

00:46:54.870 --> 00:47:00.620
primary shopping channel, rather
than building the very

00:47:00.620 --> 00:47:04.670
expensive shopping center.

00:47:04.670 --> 00:47:10.890
And for that, my strong belief
is in Southeast Asia from 15,

00:47:10.890 --> 00:47:15.020
10 to 20 years from now, the
share of e-commerce will be

00:47:15.020 --> 00:47:18.260
higher than the mature
countries.

00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:26.540
But still the internet
infrastructure, including

00:47:26.540 --> 00:47:30.160
wireless, is very weak.

00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:37.100
And also the physical
transportation infrastructure

00:47:37.100 --> 00:47:38.270
is relatively weak.

00:47:38.270 --> 00:47:41.270
That's a challenge, but we can
call it opportunity as well.

00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:45.600
DANIEL ALEGRE: Well Mickey,
thank you very, very much for

00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:46.730
taking the time to talk to us.

00:47:46.730 --> 00:47:49.050
I know it's been a very
busy book tour.

00:47:49.050 --> 00:47:50.060
HIROSHI MIKITANI: Thank you.

00:47:50.060 --> 00:47:51.480
This the last one, by the way.

00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:52.085
DANIEL ALEGRE: This
is the last stop.

00:47:52.085 --> 00:47:52.370
HIROSHI MIKITANI: Yes.

00:47:52.370 --> 00:47:53.010
DANIEL ALEGRE: Wonderful.

00:47:53.010 --> 00:47:53.710
OK.

00:47:53.710 --> 00:47:55.820
So we look forward to--

00:47:55.820 --> 00:47:58.700
for all of you to read
this great book.

00:47:58.700 --> 00:48:02.320
Easy reading, but actually very
in-depth and some really

00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:03.620
good nuggets of information.

00:48:03.620 --> 00:48:06.640
And I look forward to
Marketplace 4.0,

00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:09.000
whenever that comes out.

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.680
But I want to leave you with
one parting gift for you to

00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:13.560
remember this last stop
on your book tour.

00:48:16.524 --> 00:48:18.490
There you go.

00:48:18.490 --> 00:48:20.140
HIROSHI MIKITANI:
Oh, thank you.
