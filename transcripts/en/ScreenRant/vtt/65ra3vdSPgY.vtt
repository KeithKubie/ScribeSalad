Intro
Movies may get most of the attention when

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:13.210
it comes to easter eggs, hidden details, or
secret messages from the filmmakers, but they're

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:14.210
not alone.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.820
It may be harder to spot them in television
shows, but make no mistake: the minds behind

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.150
some of your favorite shows spend just as
much time planting secret nods, clues, or

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.260
details for fans to search for on repeat viewings.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.130
Here are 10 Amazing TV Show Easter Eggs You
Probably Missed.

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.970
The Flash
Comic book easter eggs are doled out every

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.910
episode, but one rose above all others.

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.980
In the original comics, the crossover of both
Flashes - Barry Allen and Jay Garrick - was

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.420
teased with iconic cover art featuring both
rushing to the rescue.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.120
So when both appeared on the TV show, they
recreated the moment perfectly - down to the

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.120
well-placed bricks.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.679
And not a single comic fan could have missed
it.

00:00:51.679 --> 00:00:54.300
Community
The show may be famous for its inside jokes

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.600
and subtle gags, but one actually took place
on another TV show - on another network.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.490
When Abed tells Jeff a tragic story about
appearing as an extra on Cougar Town, the

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.620
joke works on its own But if fans actually
tuned in to the ABC comedy two months later,

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.140
they could have seen it happen for themselves.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.080
How I Met Your Mother
The show packed more than a few surprises,

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.070
but none was more tragic than a character's
death in season 6 - a shock to even the cast.

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.140
But it wasn't as much of a twist for those
who spotted the numbers 50 and 49 early in

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.880
the episode - kicking off a countdown through
the entire running time, meant to clue fans

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.680
in that something big was about to happen.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.790
If they didn't catch it the first time, it's
hard to miss the second.

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.280
Fringe
The sci-fi series was famous for featuring

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.970
a mystery "Observer" in the background of
every episode, but they also featured clear

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.920
hints at the next story the team tackled.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.190
Like when a bit of graffiti reading "Brain
Freeze" hinted at the next episode's villain

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.320
freezing victims' brains.. which included
a book by "S. Pores" - the spores from the

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.280
next episode - and so on, and so on, you get
the idea.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.610
It's Always Sunny
No matter how pointless a secret you bury

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.430
in your show, someone will find it.

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.030
Like when the end credits for It's Always
Sunny featured three of the cast with initials

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.910
reversed, and random noises.

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.550
Someone took the hint and reverses the audio,
getting a clear message.

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:11.370
But they kept the tradition alive, even though
the messages were basically nonsense.

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.170
Arrested Development
The writers got plenty of mileage out of Michael

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.820
Cera's character sharing a name with famous
singer George Michael, but got even deeper

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.140
into the joke in Season 4.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.250
When the boy finally decides he's had enough
teasing due to the star's... criminal history

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.930
(tired of being compared), he decides to change
his name "George Ma--...haris" - another actor

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.290
charged with the same crime in 1974.

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.130
The other man involved was the totally-his-real-name
Perfecto Telles... who began dating his cousin

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.810
the episode before.

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.380
Homeland
A secret from fans is one thing, but what

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.480
about a secret from the cast and crew?

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.860
When the makers of Homeland called on artists
to decorate their sets with Arabic graffiti

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.670
- to really make it seem like a Syrian refugee
camp - they didn't miss the opportunity.

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.060
Believing the show to reinforce negative stereotypes
about terrorist groups, the artists spraypainted

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.500
phrases like "Homeland is racist" or "there
is no Homeland" instead.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.020
Scrubs
There weren't many appearances from J.D.'s

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.750
father, played by the late John Ritter, and
it's mainly because the actor got a more demanding

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.980
role on 8 Simple Rules around the same time.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.890
Which makes it even better when you realize
that J.D.'s flashback scene is actually SET

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.810
in the living room from that other TV show.

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.069
It was clearly to save time, but fans have
another theory: J.D.'s dad wasn't around because

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:21.209
he was actually living with his OTHER family.

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:22.880
Tragic.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.850
Game of Thrones
When Arya visits a stage production of King

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.880
Joffrey's death, fans get to see the events
of the show's early seasons re-enacted.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.190
But they also get a nod to the future, when
the actress playing Cersei claims that "I

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.290
feel the winds of winter as they lick across
the land" If the words ring a bell, they should:

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.709
it's a tease of George R.R. Martin's next
book "The Winds of Winter".

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:44.520
There's another Game of Thrones secret, but
be warned: SPOILERS AHEAD.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.430
The huge-but-simple servant Hodor became a
fan favorite carrying Bran Stark every step

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.239
of his journey, and he met an end that broke
every fan's heart, "holding the door" after

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:54.550
helping the boy escape down a massive corridor.

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.150
It was Hodor's last scene - and it ties back
to his first one, when he gets an order in

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:59.489
the show's fourth episode.

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:03.879
The writers didn't know it at the time, but
he would do just that as his last sacrifice.

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:07.430
Those are some of our favorite hidden easter
eggs and secret messages in hit TV shows,

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:08.650
but which ones did we miss?
