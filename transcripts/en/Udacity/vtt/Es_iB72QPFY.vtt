00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.260
So there are many ways you could improve this form. One of

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:05.800
the ideas you might have had as to improve the visual design

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.490
of the theme of the form, to make it look a little

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.590
bit more Android-y. Another thing we could of done is maybe making

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.570
the fonts a bit bigger, making the spacing a little bit wider,

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.080
just to make the form kind of flow better. Another idea would be

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.460
to validate the form, so the user knows what to type in

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.678
if they got something wrong. Nazmul, do you have any thoughts on this?

00:00:23.678 --> 00:00:25.840
&gt;&gt; Yeah actually, if I were to answer this

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.460
questions like six, seven, or even eight years ago when I

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.360
had my start up, I actually would completely agree with everything

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.790
you said. I probably, like you, created this really awesome sign

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.070
in form. But the correct answer is actually not to have

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.130
one. The most important thing to do in this situation is

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.930
to remove this form in it's entirety. And replace it with

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.270
Sign In with Google or Sign In with Facebook or Sign

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.510
In with LinkedIn, who, or whoever your favorite social identity provider is.

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.780
There's no reason to subject your user to having to

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.820
fill out all these long forms when all they want to do

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.420
is use your application. That's like the worst time to

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.390
actually bring this up. Instead by removing this entire flow and

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.490
having a single button that they can use to sign

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.470
in, it makes their life easy. And it also makes your

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.510
life easy, because you can now get out of the username

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.600
and password business. And use social identity providers who provide the

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.410
service for free, reducing the amount of work you have to do and

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.710
also what your user has to do in order to use your application
