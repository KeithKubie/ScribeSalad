00:00:00.281 --> 00:00:02.719
- [Voiceover] Consider the
curve given by the equation

00:00:02.719 --> 00:00:06.040
Y to the third minus XY is equal to two.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.501
It can be shown that the derivative of Y

00:00:08.501 --> 00:00:13.501
with respect to X is equal
to Y over three Y squared

00:00:13.527 --> 00:00:15.304
minus X.

00:00:15.304 --> 00:00:16.384
All right?

00:00:16.384 --> 00:00:19.403
Write an equation for the
line tangent to the curve

00:00:19.403 --> 00:00:22.967
at the point negative one comma one.

00:00:22.967 --> 00:00:25.602
All right, so we can figure
out the equation for the line

00:00:25.602 --> 00:00:27.599
if we know the slope of the line

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.248
and we know a point that it goes through

00:00:29.248 --> 00:00:30.502
so that should be enough to figure out

00:00:30.502 --> 00:00:32.359
the equation of the line.

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:34.519
So the line's going to have a form

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:38.164
Y is equal to MX plus B.

00:00:38.164 --> 00:00:43.164
M is the slope and is
going to be equal to DY/DX

00:00:44.538 --> 00:00:45.980
at that point,

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.292
and we know that that's
going to be equal to.

00:00:48.292 --> 00:00:50.557
We'll see Y is, when X is negative one,

00:00:50.557 --> 00:00:53.134
Y is one, that sits on this curve.

00:00:53.134 --> 00:00:54.991
So Y is one.

00:00:54.991 --> 00:00:58.300
So one over three Y squared.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.936
So three times one squared which is three,

00:01:00.936 --> 00:01:04.198
minus X, when Y is one,

00:01:04.198 --> 00:01:07.938
X is negative one, or when
X is negative one, Y is one.

00:01:07.938 --> 00:01:09.808
So X is negative one here.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:11.767
And so this is the same thing as

00:01:11.767 --> 00:01:13.812
three plus positive one,

00:01:13.812 --> 00:01:16.470
and so this is equal to one fourth

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.854
and so the equation of our line

00:01:17.854 --> 00:01:22.854
is going to be Y is equal
to one fourth X plus B.

00:01:23.287 --> 00:01:24.887
Now we need to solve for B

00:01:24.887 --> 00:01:26.605
and we know that point negative one

00:01:26.605 --> 00:01:27.929
comma one is on the line,

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:30.530
so we can use that
information to solve for B.

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.225
This line is tangent to the curve.

00:01:32.225 --> 00:01:34.732
So includes this point
and only that point.

00:01:34.732 --> 00:01:36.672
That's what it has in
common with the curve

00:01:36.672 --> 00:01:39.445
and so why is equal to one

00:01:39.445 --> 00:01:42.732
when X is equal to negative one,

00:01:42.732 --> 00:01:46.763
plus B and so we have one is equal to

00:01:46.763 --> 00:01:50.048
negative one fourth plus B.

00:01:50.048 --> 00:01:52.660
You add one fourth to both sides,

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.307
you get B is equal to,

00:01:55.307 --> 00:01:57.507
we could either write it
as one and one fourth,

00:01:57.507 --> 00:01:59.783
which is equal to five fourths,

00:01:59.783 --> 00:02:02.825
which is equal to 1.25.

00:02:02.825 --> 00:02:04.566
We could write it any of those ways,

00:02:04.566 --> 00:02:06.842
so the equation for the
line tangent to the curve

00:02:06.842 --> 00:02:10.243
at this point is Y is equal to

00:02:10.243 --> 00:02:14.469
our slope is one fourth X plus

00:02:14.469 --> 00:02:16.722
and I could write it in any of these ways.

00:02:16.722 --> 00:02:21.722
I'll write it as plus five over four

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.796
and we're done at least with
that part of the problem.
