00:00:05.317 --> 00:00:08.484
(gentle upbeat music)

00:00:31.406 --> 00:00:33.203
- Welcome to A Conversation With History,

00:00:33.203 --> 00:00:34.824
I'm Harry Kreisler of the

00:00:34.824 --> 00:00:37.020
Institute of International Studies.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.148
Our guest today is Niall Ferguson,

00:00:39.148 --> 00:00:42.397
who is a senior fellow
at the Hoover Institution

00:00:42.397 --> 00:00:44.381
at Stanford University.

00:00:44.381 --> 00:00:45.631
His new book is

00:00:46.947 --> 00:00:49.780
Kissinger 1923-1968: The Idealist.

00:00:52.797 --> 00:00:54.904
Professor Ferguson is at Berkeley

00:00:54.904 --> 00:00:58.488
to deliver the R Kirk Underhill lecture

00:00:58.488 --> 00:01:00.893
for the Anglo American Studies program

00:01:00.893 --> 00:01:04.097
at the Institute of Governmental Studies.

00:01:04.097 --> 00:01:05.929
Niall, welcome back to Berkeley.

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:07.478
- Nice to be back Harry.

00:01:07.478 --> 00:01:08.311
- Why are,

00:01:09.575 --> 00:01:12.606
Anglo American studies still important?

00:01:12.606 --> 00:01:14.014
- I don't think you can
understand the history

00:01:14.014 --> 00:01:17.783
of the United States if you
ignore its British origins

00:01:17.783 --> 00:01:18.863
for one thing.

00:01:18.863 --> 00:01:20.294
I don't think you can really understand

00:01:20.294 --> 00:01:22.585
the history of the world
unless you understand

00:01:22.585 --> 00:01:26.329
the extraordinary and
disproportionately role played

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:30.548
by what Churchill called the
English speaking peoples,

00:01:30.548 --> 00:01:33.748
and I think perhaps lastly,
it would be very difficult

00:01:33.748 --> 00:01:36.485
to make sense of contemporary developments

00:01:36.485 --> 00:01:39.586
in the United States if one knew nothing

00:01:39.586 --> 00:01:42.376
of the parallel developments in the UK.

00:01:42.376 --> 00:01:45.923
Populism is a word that's on
everybody's lips these days

00:01:45.923 --> 00:01:49.206
while we had a populist
moment in Britain this year

00:01:49.206 --> 00:01:51.726
with the vote to leave the European Union,

00:01:51.726 --> 00:01:53.732
and I don't think that's irrelevant

00:01:53.732 --> 00:01:55.597
to the kind of debates
that have been going on

00:01:55.597 --> 00:01:58.944
in the US around the
presidential election campaign.

00:01:58.944 --> 00:02:01.527
- And what is it about populism

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:06.583
as it's appearing all over
Europe and in Great Britain

00:02:06.583 --> 00:02:10.278
and in the United States
that invites a comparison?

00:02:10.278 --> 00:02:12.027
- Well I think there's
a global phenomenon,

00:02:12.027 --> 00:02:15.201
certainly a northern hemisphere
phenomenon at work here.

00:02:15.201 --> 00:02:17.919
A backlash against globalization,

00:02:17.919 --> 00:02:21.249
not only economically but one
might say also culturally,

00:02:21.249 --> 00:02:23.854
and one of the arguments I
want to make in my lecture

00:02:23.854 --> 00:02:25.095
is that if one looks closely at

00:02:25.095 --> 00:02:26.694
the case of the United Kingdom,

00:02:26.694 --> 00:02:30.510
one sees certain common features
of this populist backlash

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.966
that are also visible in the
United States and elsewhere.

00:02:34.966 --> 00:02:37.654
There is certainly an argument about

00:02:37.654 --> 00:02:41.259
the economic consequences
of global integration,

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:43.013
but in particular I think

00:02:43.013 --> 00:02:45.704
there's an argument about immigration,

00:02:45.704 --> 00:02:47.934
and not only its economic consequences

00:02:47.934 --> 00:02:50.613
but also its cultural consequences.

00:02:50.613 --> 00:02:53.423
So the Brexit vote back in June,

00:02:53.423 --> 00:02:56.925
the vote for Britain to
leave the European Union

00:02:56.925 --> 00:03:01.009
is a really interesting test
of the power of populism

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:04.083
and on of the striking
features of that vote

00:03:04.083 --> 00:03:06.437
was the way in which there
were big differentials

00:03:06.437 --> 00:03:09.512
both regionally and in terms of age groups

00:03:09.512 --> 00:03:12.019
in the way that people voted.

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:14.519
I'm a Scotsman, this
may still be detectable

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:17.338
in my idiosyncratic accent,

00:03:17.338 --> 00:03:19.518
Scotland voted to remain in the EU

00:03:19.518 --> 00:03:21.895
by quite a substantial margin.

00:03:21.895 --> 00:03:24.976
It was England and Wales
that voted strongly to leave.

00:03:24.976 --> 00:03:27.258
Even more strikingly, and this seems to me

00:03:27.258 --> 00:03:29.761
highly relevant to the United States,

00:03:29.761 --> 00:03:32.332
there was a huge differential in turnout

00:03:32.332 --> 00:03:34.965
and voting between age groups.

00:03:34.965 --> 00:03:38.714
So relatively young voters, the under 25s,

00:03:38.714 --> 00:03:41.825
turned out at a rate of around 60%,

00:03:41.825 --> 00:03:44.532
but voted by a large majority

00:03:44.532 --> 00:03:47.267
to remain in the European Union.

00:03:47.267 --> 00:03:51.434
Voters age 65 and older
turned out at a rate of 90%

00:03:52.534 --> 00:03:56.161
and they voted
disproportionately to leave.

00:03:56.161 --> 00:03:59.703
I think it's very interesting
to see how far populism

00:03:59.703 --> 00:04:02.292
is a partly regional phenomenon,

00:04:02.292 --> 00:04:05.369
but above all it's a
kind of demographically

00:04:05.369 --> 00:04:09.057
differentiated phenomenon
appealing to older voters,

00:04:09.057 --> 00:04:11.966
and it's those older
voters reaction against

00:04:11.966 --> 00:04:15.250
the cultural as well as economic
consequences of immigration

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.582
who seem really, that that seems really

00:04:17.582 --> 00:04:19.440
to be driving this movement.

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.684
- And what is it about globalization

00:04:22.684 --> 00:04:25.774
in addition to increased immigration

00:04:25.774 --> 00:04:29.418
that leads to this dissatisfaction

00:04:29.418 --> 00:04:31.884
among this cohort you're talking about?

00:04:31.884 --> 00:04:34.599
- Well I think if one
beings with the economics

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:38.026
one gets a sort of rough
idea of what's going on.

00:04:38.026 --> 00:04:41.026
What you've had in the last 25 years

00:04:42.135 --> 00:04:44.597
has been a really significant increase

00:04:44.597 --> 00:04:48.347
in international flows
of goods, commodities,

00:04:49.505 --> 00:04:53.355
capital, people and ideas,
and all of these things

00:04:53.355 --> 00:04:57.188
have really significantly
increased in volume.

00:04:58.095 --> 00:05:02.159
The migrant flows have
made the United Kingdom

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:05.172
really for the first time
in its modern history

00:05:05.172 --> 00:05:08.438
a major destination of immigrants

00:05:08.438 --> 00:05:12.605
with nets in migration running
at around 300,000 a year.

00:05:13.694 --> 00:05:14.634
That's a lot for--

00:05:14.634 --> 00:05:16.608
- And are these mainly
from Eastern Europe?

00:05:16.608 --> 00:05:17.456
- No, no.

00:05:17.456 --> 00:05:18.289
- No.

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:19.512
- No this is the interesting thing,

00:05:19.512 --> 00:05:21.695
when you actually look
at what's happening,

00:05:21.695 --> 00:05:23.224
about half of these people are not

00:05:23.224 --> 00:05:24.886
from the European Union at all,

00:05:24.886 --> 00:05:26.462
they're from all over the world,

00:05:26.462 --> 00:05:29.494
and the other half are indeed
from the European Union,

00:05:29.494 --> 00:05:32.323
but of that European
contingent, the East Europeans,

00:05:32.323 --> 00:05:34.980
the people from the relatively
new member states in the EU

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:36.950
are actually quite a small fraction,

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:39.271
but that's not how the world looks

00:05:39.271 --> 00:05:41.332
if you're a reader of the Daily Mail.

00:05:41.332 --> 00:05:42.732
If you're a reader of the Daily Mail,

00:05:42.732 --> 00:05:45.121
there's an enormous number
of people from Poland

00:05:45.121 --> 00:05:48.054
and other East European states
who are coming to the UK

00:05:48.054 --> 00:05:51.542
and they're taking British
jobs or they're lowering

00:05:51.542 --> 00:05:53.319
the wages of British workers,

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:55.259
and they're consuming public services,

00:05:55.259 --> 00:05:58.500
all of which is quite
wrong in fact it turns out.

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.897
If one looks at the
role of the EU migrants

00:06:01.897 --> 00:06:04.446
what they actually do is they they come

00:06:04.446 --> 00:06:08.613
and they they take jobs that
would otherwise not get done.

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:12.581
There's no zero-sum game here.

00:06:12.581 --> 00:06:16.372
Employment has increased
for UK citizens enormously

00:06:16.372 --> 00:06:20.927
in the period of recovery that
we've seen since 2008, 2009,

00:06:20.927 --> 00:06:23.297
and it's kind of hard to
understand how that recovery

00:06:23.297 --> 00:06:24.956
would have gone if there hadn't also been

00:06:24.956 --> 00:06:27.426
migrant workers from the rest of the EU

00:06:27.426 --> 00:06:31.278
to take some of the jobs
that were being created,

00:06:31.278 --> 00:06:34.361
and what's also very striking is that

00:06:35.416 --> 00:06:39.151
there are so many of these
European citizens in work

00:06:39.151 --> 00:06:43.613
that they are clearly net
contributors to the public purse.

00:06:43.613 --> 00:06:47.032
So there's a tremendous distortion

00:06:47.032 --> 00:06:51.335
when you get to the level
of the media and of politics

00:06:51.335 --> 00:06:53.315
about what exactly is going on,

00:06:53.315 --> 00:06:55.701
and that gets me to the second point.

00:06:55.701 --> 00:06:57.280
This isn't really about economics

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:00.622
or at least it's only superficially
an economic phenomenon.

00:07:00.622 --> 00:07:04.337
It's much more I think a reaction against

00:07:04.337 --> 00:07:09.048
the cultural changes that are
associated with globalization

00:07:09.048 --> 00:07:10.383
not just with immigration,

00:07:10.383 --> 00:07:12.253
but more broadly with globalization,

00:07:12.253 --> 00:07:13.927
and that's why it's significant

00:07:13.927 --> 00:07:17.712
that it's older voters in
the UK who voted for Brexit,

00:07:17.712 --> 00:07:20.901
not because they had a
tremendously sophisticated idea

00:07:20.901 --> 00:07:23.045
of the nature of Britain's relationship

00:07:23.045 --> 00:07:24.531
with the European Union,

00:07:24.531 --> 00:07:27.540
but more because they
wanted to protest against

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:29.914
changes that they have
seen in their country

00:07:29.914 --> 00:07:32.870
over the period of say 20 to 25 years,

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:34.947
that have been the course partly economic,

00:07:34.947 --> 00:07:38.045
but much I think it's
a cultural phenomenon

00:07:38.045 --> 00:07:39.192
that we're seeing here.

00:07:39.192 --> 00:07:42.203
A kind of rejection not just of a more

00:07:42.203 --> 00:07:46.339
multicultural society but a
rejection of a whole range

00:07:46.339 --> 00:07:48.168
of things that come with that.

00:07:48.168 --> 00:07:49.266
Some of the interesting polling

00:07:49.266 --> 00:07:52.276
that I'll talk about in
my lecture relates to

00:07:52.276 --> 00:07:56.350
how people thought
about a range of issues.

00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:58.997
Including for example feminism,

00:07:58.997 --> 00:08:03.333
and how they voted in
the Brexit referendum,

00:08:03.333 --> 00:08:05.400
and the correlations
are extremely striking.

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:08.125
Socially and culturally
conservative attitudes

00:08:08.125 --> 00:08:11.115
match up with voting for leaving the EU.

00:08:11.115 --> 00:08:13.785
So voting to leave the EU
is really a kind of proxy

00:08:13.785 --> 00:08:17.840
for a generalized protest
against things that people

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:20.582
just don't like about
modernity and not surprisingly

00:08:20.582 --> 00:08:23.564
if you're 65, and older and there's a lot

00:08:23.564 --> 00:08:25.181
you don't like about modernity

00:08:25.181 --> 00:08:27.719
'cause you remember things
being different in your day,

00:08:27.719 --> 00:08:30.073
and that was a big part of Brexit.

00:08:30.073 --> 00:08:34.218
If you look at the US the
slogan Make America Great Again

00:08:34.218 --> 00:08:38.418
clearly resonates with a
section of the population

00:08:38.418 --> 00:08:40.751
which is less well-educated,

00:08:41.986 --> 00:08:45.352
older, whiter, and
culturally conservative,

00:08:45.352 --> 00:08:48.177
and that I think is a
really important parallel

00:08:48.177 --> 00:08:53.033
between the Brexit phenomenon
and the Trump phenomenon.

00:08:53.033 --> 00:08:56.976
- To what extent should
we look at the elites,

00:08:56.976 --> 00:09:01.776
the global elite, both in the
United States and in Europe

00:09:01.776 --> 00:09:02.609
and,

00:09:03.747 --> 00:09:07.247
ask what, in what ways have they failed to

00:09:08.313 --> 00:09:13.216
getting ahead of the game
with regard to this response

00:09:13.216 --> 00:09:15.773
which has come upon us.

00:09:15.773 --> 00:09:18.190
- I think hostility to elites

00:09:19.555 --> 00:09:21.740
who are perceived to be out of touch

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:23.690
and perhaps even corrupt,

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:26.350
is a really important part of populism.

00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:29.029
I mean I came up with
a recipe for populism

00:09:29.029 --> 00:09:32.710
earlier this year that
had five ingredients.

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:35.012
The increase in immigration,

00:09:35.012 --> 00:09:37.845
the financial shock of the crisis,

00:09:39.448 --> 00:09:41.992
the increase of inequality,

00:09:41.992 --> 00:09:44.580
and at the sense that
the public institutions,

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:46.943
the elites are corrupt.

00:09:46.943 --> 00:09:48.777
Final ingredient is a demagogue,

00:09:48.777 --> 00:09:52.654
put all those things together and boom,

00:09:52.654 --> 00:09:56.056
you have something pretty
toxic in the kitchen.

00:09:56.056 --> 00:10:00.752
So I think the issue of
the elites have failed,

00:10:00.752 --> 00:10:04.010
played a really big part
in the populist movements,

00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:06.228
that we see all across
the world right now,

00:10:06.228 --> 00:10:08.702
and I think the some
justification for this.

00:10:08.702 --> 00:10:10.368
It's very easy for someone like me

00:10:10.368 --> 00:10:13.176
who's clearly a member
of the global elite,

00:10:13.176 --> 00:10:15.183
you're one too, I mean here we are,

00:10:15.183 --> 00:10:19.335
professors at elite institutions,
to condescend to voters

00:10:19.335 --> 00:10:21.998
who are attracted to populist causes,

00:10:21.998 --> 00:10:23.982
but we have to acknowledge that they have

00:10:23.982 --> 00:10:26.491
some right to be aggrieved.

00:10:26.491 --> 00:10:31.154
After all it was the elites
who brought you the Iraq War.

00:10:31.154 --> 00:10:35.020
It was the elites who brought
you the financial crisis,

00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:36.646
and I think from the vantage point

00:10:36.646 --> 00:10:41.587
of the imaginary median voter
in both the UK and the US,

00:10:41.587 --> 00:10:43.789
the last 16 years has not been

00:10:43.789 --> 00:10:45.977
a particularly edifying spectacle,

00:10:45.977 --> 00:10:49.919
and it hasn't given you too
much confidence in those elites

00:10:49.919 --> 00:10:52.903
who run the political
and economic systems.

00:10:52.903 --> 00:10:54.622
- Is there a,

00:10:54.622 --> 00:10:57.163
particular responsibility that falls

00:10:57.163 --> 00:10:59.445
on the United States and it's elite

00:10:59.445 --> 00:11:02.810
because of its role as a hegemon

00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:05.143
in the post World War world?

00:11:06.046 --> 00:11:09.375
Especially after the
fall of the Soviet union?

00:11:09.375 --> 00:11:13.921
- Obviously the United
States has played a key role,

00:11:13.921 --> 00:11:16.544
not just since the fall of the Berlin Wall

00:11:16.544 --> 00:11:17.949
and the end of the Cold War,

00:11:17.949 --> 00:11:21.707
but since World War II
and American leaders

00:11:21.707 --> 00:11:23.936
or American elites if you prefer,

00:11:23.936 --> 00:11:28.632
are the most important and
influential in the world.

00:11:28.632 --> 00:11:31.282
So when the elites blunder,

00:11:31.282 --> 00:11:35.615
which I think it's quite
reasonable to argue that they did,

00:11:35.615 --> 00:11:39.782
the rest of the world and not
only American voters suffers,

00:11:40.862 --> 00:11:44.782
so I think part of what we see here is

00:11:44.782 --> 00:11:48.310
an understandable popular reaction

00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:51.060
against major failures of policy,

00:11:52.144 --> 00:11:55.489
and the populist critique on
both sides of the Atlantic

00:11:55.489 --> 00:11:58.467
is not in that sense
without some foundation.

00:11:58.467 --> 00:12:01.284
I mean even if you take a specific example

00:12:01.284 --> 00:12:04.066
like immigration to the UK,

00:12:04.066 --> 00:12:08.688
you could argue that the
inflows of workers to the UK

00:12:08.688 --> 00:12:11.055
and the decline of immigration from the UK

00:12:11.055 --> 00:12:12.847
are both signs of success,

00:12:12.847 --> 00:12:15.516
the UK's economy has been
creating a lot of jobs,

00:12:15.516 --> 00:12:18.901
more than most of the
continental European economies,

00:12:18.901 --> 00:12:20.828
but Britain's leaders did not do

00:12:20.828 --> 00:12:24.801
a terribly good job of explaining that.

00:12:24.801 --> 00:12:27.498
In fact what they'd led people to expect

00:12:27.498 --> 00:12:30.373
was that they were going
to reduce net migration.

00:12:30.373 --> 00:12:31.988
They were going to actually bring it down

00:12:31.988 --> 00:12:34.104
to more like 30,000 a year.

00:12:34.104 --> 00:12:36.296
When the numbers were persistently running

00:12:36.296 --> 00:12:40.368
at an order of magnitude
larger at 300,000 a year,

00:12:40.368 --> 00:12:42.829
people understandably were angry

00:12:42.829 --> 00:12:45.217
and felt that they'd been lied to.

00:12:45.217 --> 00:12:46.885
I think the financial crisis was

00:12:46.885 --> 00:12:50.885
a particularly important
moment when the elites,

00:12:51.795 --> 00:12:54.059
both financial and political,

00:12:54.059 --> 00:12:56.822
were exposed for their incompetence.

00:12:56.822 --> 00:13:00.894
Hardly any of these
people foresaw the crisis.

00:13:00.894 --> 00:13:03.012
I was one of a tiny number
of people who argued

00:13:03.012 --> 00:13:05.692
in 2006, 2007 that we were heading

00:13:05.692 --> 00:13:09.976
for a major financial crisis,
and potentially a depression.

00:13:09.976 --> 00:13:12.520
So I think people are understandably angry

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:16.480
that the entire financial
system which enriched bankers,

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:18.914
and not only bankers,
enriched a whole class

00:13:18.914 --> 00:13:21.698
of financial asset managers,

00:13:21.698 --> 00:13:23.433
and sometimes enriched the politicians,

00:13:23.433 --> 00:13:27.006
happened and ordinary
people paid the penalty

00:13:27.006 --> 00:13:30.140
whether it was in the form of bank panics,

00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:32.628
lost houses, lost jobs.

00:13:32.628 --> 00:13:34.961
So I'm highly sympathetic to

00:13:36.529 --> 00:13:39.384
those people who are drawn to populists

00:13:39.384 --> 00:13:41.474
out of frustration with the status quo,

00:13:41.474 --> 00:13:44.802
because the status quo
has not served very well.

00:13:44.802 --> 00:13:46.552
- And were the elites

00:13:47.868 --> 00:13:50.576
in both Britain and here

00:13:50.576 --> 00:13:54.158
clueless about the political response

00:13:54.158 --> 00:13:57.101
that was coming from the
people who it were hurting?

00:13:57.101 --> 00:13:59.202
- Actually I think they
were rather clueless.

00:13:59.202 --> 00:14:02.298
It was quite hard to explain
in the immediate aftermath

00:14:02.298 --> 00:14:04.410
of the financial crisis,

00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:06.784
to politicians or to bankers,

00:14:06.784 --> 00:14:09.496
that a major backlash was coming,

00:14:09.496 --> 00:14:12.608
and I had conversations with people

00:14:12.608 --> 00:14:15.522
in Wall Street, in
Washington in which I said

00:14:15.522 --> 00:14:18.501
you do understand that
after something this big

00:14:18.501 --> 00:14:21.105
there's going to be a period
when people are just focused on

00:14:21.105 --> 00:14:24.546
economically coping and
then there's going to be

00:14:24.546 --> 00:14:26.472
a major political backlash,

00:14:26.472 --> 00:14:29.946
and I argued in an interview in 2009

00:14:29.946 --> 00:14:33.541
that there would be a populist response,

00:14:33.541 --> 00:14:35.701
and that in some parts of the
world this would actually go

00:14:35.701 --> 00:14:38.392
from populism into violence.

00:14:38.392 --> 00:14:40.700
My prediction was that
the post-crisis world

00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:43.038
would be a great deal more volatile

00:14:43.038 --> 00:14:46.178
simply because it was such
a large financial shock,

00:14:46.178 --> 00:14:48.870
and it not only cost people money,

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:51.011
but it undermined the legitimacy

00:14:51.011 --> 00:14:52.825
of the regime's they lived under.

00:14:52.825 --> 00:14:55.149
It produced full-blown revolution remember

00:14:55.149 --> 00:14:58.253
in Middle Eastern and
North African countries.

00:14:58.253 --> 00:15:00.294
We haven't gone that far,

00:15:00.294 --> 00:15:03.265
but if one looks at the
ways in which people

00:15:03.265 --> 00:15:06.169
express their disapproval in elections,

00:15:06.169 --> 00:15:08.413
it's very clear that we've got a major,

00:15:08.413 --> 00:15:10.587
major political shift going on,

00:15:10.587 --> 00:15:12.115
and it's interesting because populism

00:15:12.115 --> 00:15:14.880
is a two flavor product.

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:18.434
You can have the left-wing
flavor or the right-wing favor,

00:15:18.434 --> 00:15:22.745
and they're available from all
political ice cream stores,

00:15:22.745 --> 00:15:25.215
and so right now what
you've seen in the US

00:15:25.215 --> 00:15:26.462
has been the populism of the left

00:15:26.462 --> 00:15:27.810
in the form of Bernie Sanders,

00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:30.710
then the populism of the right
in the form of Donald Trump.

00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:33.579
To a historian of the Atlantic world,

00:15:33.579 --> 00:15:35.844
these are very familiar characters.

00:15:35.844 --> 00:15:38.067
You would have found very similar people

00:15:38.067 --> 00:15:41.326
in the late 19th century
making very similar arguments

00:15:41.326 --> 00:15:43.553
against globalization,

00:15:43.553 --> 00:15:46.370
and the case I like to
cite is Denis Kearney.

00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:48.147
Nobody has ever heard of Denis Kearney,

00:15:48.147 --> 00:15:50.370
but once upon a time Denis Kearney

00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:53.538
was the Donald Trump of
California in the 1870s.

00:15:53.538 --> 00:15:54.857
It was Denis Kearney and others

00:15:54.857 --> 00:15:57.578
who argued the Chinese must go.

00:15:57.578 --> 00:15:59.408
There should be an end
of Chinese immigration

00:15:59.408 --> 00:16:02.342
into the United States
and they were successful,

00:16:02.342 --> 00:16:06.081
because in 1882 the Exclusion
Act was passed by Congress

00:16:06.081 --> 00:16:08.124
and Chinese immigration basically stopped.

00:16:08.124 --> 00:16:10.499
They didn't build a
wall, but didn't need to.

00:16:10.499 --> 00:16:12.755
Metaphorically they did right across

00:16:12.755 --> 00:16:14.368
the San Francisco harbor.

00:16:14.368 --> 00:16:16.820
- And you've criticized the
United States in the past

00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:20.513
for various deficits, leadership deficit,

00:16:20.513 --> 00:16:22.836
a physical deficit, but you've also talked

00:16:22.836 --> 00:16:24.752
about a history deficit.

00:16:24.752 --> 00:16:28.411
So people don't know these
stories from the past.

00:16:28.411 --> 00:16:32.788
- It's astonishing that this
history of American populism

00:16:32.788 --> 00:16:35.212
seems largely to have been forgotten

00:16:35.212 --> 00:16:36.981
outside the academic world,

00:16:36.981 --> 00:16:41.896
and I've asked rooms full of
people in the last few months

00:16:41.896 --> 00:16:43.925
who has heard of Denis Kearney.

00:16:43.925 --> 00:16:47.626
Now maybe this being the
United States of amnesia

00:16:47.626 --> 00:16:50.619
and in a few decades time nobody

00:16:50.619 --> 00:16:52.465
will have heard of Donald Trump,

00:16:52.465 --> 00:16:54.996
but right now I think we do need to know

00:16:54.996 --> 00:16:57.866
about the early populists,
we need to recognize

00:16:57.866 --> 00:17:01.581
that we've seen a version
of this movie before,

00:17:01.581 --> 00:17:03.202
and in the late 19th century,

00:17:03.202 --> 00:17:05.248
which was an era of globalization,

00:17:05.248 --> 00:17:09.081
there were very profound
anti global movements

00:17:10.014 --> 00:17:12.226
on both the left and on the right.

00:17:12.226 --> 00:17:13.518
They were against immigration.

00:17:13.518 --> 00:17:15.232
They were against free trade.

00:17:15.232 --> 00:17:17.866
They were directed at financial elites,

00:17:17.866 --> 00:17:20.548
and they were actually pretty
politically successful.

00:17:20.548 --> 00:17:22.709
The US policy on immigration

00:17:22.709 --> 00:17:25.370
was radically altered by this backlash.

00:17:25.370 --> 00:17:28.044
So much so that although we love to say

00:17:28.044 --> 00:17:30.023
the United States is
a land of immigration,

00:17:30.023 --> 00:17:32.715
and we're all immigrants,
I'm an immigrant for sure,

00:17:32.715 --> 00:17:34.824
but in a long period of American history

00:17:34.824 --> 00:17:37.574
beginning in the 1880s and
continuing right through

00:17:37.574 --> 00:17:40.298
until the 1970s actually,

00:17:40.298 --> 00:17:42.965
immigration was much
reduced, much restricted.

00:17:42.965 --> 00:17:46.318
We've only really seen a return
to late 19th century levels

00:17:46.318 --> 00:17:49.360
of immigration in the last 20 or 30 years,

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:52.801
and we aren't yet quite back at that peak

00:17:52.801 --> 00:17:55.169
in terms of the percentage
of the population

00:17:55.169 --> 00:17:58.580
that is foreign-born that
was achieved in the 1880s,

00:17:58.580 --> 00:17:59.583
and guess what?

00:17:59.583 --> 00:18:01.730
It was in the 1880s that you had populism,

00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:03.300
and we're having it now.

00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:05.699
So I do think there's a
very very important analogy

00:18:05.699 --> 00:18:08.692
to be drawn here between
late 19th century populism

00:18:08.692 --> 00:18:10.634
and what we now see.

00:18:10.634 --> 00:18:13.851
Those people who say that it's fascism,

00:18:13.851 --> 00:18:16.483
who draw analogies with
the 1930s and 1940s

00:18:16.483 --> 00:18:18.662
I think are overstating the case,

00:18:18.662 --> 00:18:20.578
because I don't think this is fascism,

00:18:20.578 --> 00:18:22.531
I think that's a category error.

00:18:22.531 --> 00:18:25.452
Fascism is different,
fascism is about uniforms,

00:18:25.452 --> 00:18:27.452
parades, it's about war,

00:18:28.927 --> 00:18:31.198
but populism isn't about those things,

00:18:31.198 --> 00:18:33.908
and populists are not militaristic.

00:18:33.908 --> 00:18:38.170
No matter how many ways
you try to present him,

00:18:38.170 --> 00:18:40.531
I don't think Donald Trump is itching

00:18:40.531 --> 00:18:42.890
to launch a major war anywhere.

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:45.829
I mean beyond the
destruction of Islamic State

00:18:45.829 --> 00:18:49.569
he hasn't really offered us
much more than trade wars.

00:18:49.569 --> 00:18:51.801
I think that's much more
in the populist tradition.

00:18:51.801 --> 00:18:54.543
That you're not really
that attracted by empire,

00:18:54.543 --> 00:18:56.694
if anything you're an isolationist

00:18:56.694 --> 00:18:59.320
and you want to focus on domestic issues,

00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:00.549
and you want to build walls,

00:19:00.549 --> 00:19:02.319
you want to impose tariffs,

00:19:02.319 --> 00:19:04.374
and you want to bash
those guys on Wall Street

00:19:04.374 --> 00:19:07.810
who seem to be the
beneficiaries of globalization.

00:19:07.810 --> 00:19:09.933
- You've just in the last year

00:19:09.933 --> 00:19:12.323
published a book on Henry Kissinger,

00:19:12.323 --> 00:19:16.755
what did that journey,
which is still continuing,

00:19:16.755 --> 00:19:19.296
in what way does what you've learned

00:19:19.296 --> 00:19:22.897
contribute to the discussion
we're having right now?

00:19:22.897 --> 00:19:23.771
- A lot actually.

00:19:23.771 --> 00:19:27.188
I spent a large part of the last 10 years

00:19:28.072 --> 00:19:30.306
working my way through

00:19:30.306 --> 00:19:32.394
Henry Kissinger's private papers,

00:19:32.394 --> 00:19:34.720
and a whole bunch of
documents and other archives

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:36.939
that related to the
first half of his life,

00:19:36.939 --> 00:19:38.375
so this first volume covers the period,

00:19:38.375 --> 00:19:41.596
as you mentioned, up
until 1968 until the eve

00:19:41.596 --> 00:19:45.475
of his becoming Richard Nixon's
National Security Adviser.

00:19:45.475 --> 00:19:48.240
Part of his life that's
much less well known

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:51.365
and much less well covered
in other biographies.

00:19:51.365 --> 00:19:53.155
One of the documents that really

00:19:53.155 --> 00:19:56.516
caught my attention early
on was a diary that he kept

00:19:56.516 --> 00:20:00.591
of the 1964 Republican National Convention

00:20:00.591 --> 00:20:03.454
not very far from here in San Francisco.

00:20:03.454 --> 00:20:06.967
At which Barry Goldwater was nominated

00:20:06.967 --> 00:20:09.612
to run for president
against Lyndon Johnson,

00:20:09.612 --> 00:20:13.780
and Kissinger's diary account
of that event is fascinating,

00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:15.895
because it was one of those occasions

00:20:15.895 --> 00:20:17.289
in modern American history

00:20:17.289 --> 00:20:20.538
when the right of the Republican Party

00:20:20.538 --> 00:20:23.397
got the upper hand over
the more cosmopolitan

00:20:23.397 --> 00:20:26.567
centrist elements of the of the Northeast,

00:20:26.567 --> 00:20:29.557
and seeing Goldwater supporters

00:20:29.557 --> 00:20:33.724
in full cry denouncing
Kissinger's mentor in politics

00:20:35.391 --> 00:20:38.129
Nelson Rockefeller
really shocked Kissinger

00:20:38.129 --> 00:20:41.050
and reminded him as he
confided in his diary

00:20:41.050 --> 00:20:44.133
of his youth in Germany in the 1930s.

00:20:46.656 --> 00:20:49.909
Kissinger having been
born in Germany in 1923

00:20:49.909 --> 00:20:53.059
had come of age under Hitler.

00:20:53.059 --> 00:20:55.848
Had left Nazi Germany in 1938,

00:20:55.848 --> 00:20:58.831
not long before the disastrous and hideous

00:20:58.831 --> 00:21:02.848
program of November that year
the so-called Kristallnacht.

00:21:02.848 --> 00:21:06.502
Kissinger had seen fascism up close

00:21:06.502 --> 00:21:10.939
and his response to to seeing
the Goldwater supporters was

00:21:10.939 --> 00:21:14.487
goodness me this is are all
too reminiscent of the fascism,

00:21:14.487 --> 00:21:16.487
but I think then as now,

00:21:17.676 --> 00:21:19.928
we've got to be very
careful not to confuse

00:21:19.928 --> 00:21:22.434
populism and fascism because I don't think

00:21:22.434 --> 00:21:24.600
the Goldwater riots were fascists

00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:27.220
any more than the Trump
supporters mostly are.

00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:29.859
They're authentic American populists,

00:21:29.859 --> 00:21:33.432
and as an outsider who was
only really becoming familiar

00:21:33.432 --> 00:21:35.851
with American politics in the 1960s,

00:21:35.851 --> 00:21:37.730
Kissinger was making a mistake

00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:40.366
that we see commonly made today,

00:21:40.366 --> 00:21:42.494
confusing populism and its,

00:21:42.494 --> 00:21:44.776
which is an important part of
American political tradition

00:21:44.776 --> 00:21:47.155
with fascism which has never really been

00:21:47.155 --> 00:21:48.035
an important part at all.

00:21:48.035 --> 00:21:52.120
- How did you come to doing
this biography of Kissinger?

00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:53.991
- Well it was his idea.

00:21:53.991 --> 00:21:58.234
He and I met in London,
I think it was in 2000s,

00:21:58.234 --> 00:22:01.648
and had a conversation about
a book that I had written

00:22:01.648 --> 00:22:03.554
about the First World War,

00:22:03.554 --> 00:22:06.418
and in the course of
subsequent correspondence

00:22:06.418 --> 00:22:09.754
the idea came up that I
might consider writing

00:22:09.754 --> 00:22:12.778
a scholarly biography of him.

00:22:12.778 --> 00:22:15.383
I don't think I was the first
person he discussed this with,

00:22:15.383 --> 00:22:16.723
in fact I know I wasn't.

00:22:16.723 --> 00:22:18.494
Think I was number three on the list,

00:22:18.494 --> 00:22:22.930
but I was the one who was
mad enough to agree to do it.

00:22:22.930 --> 00:22:24.936
After an initial hesitation.

00:22:24.936 --> 00:22:26.779
I at first said no,

00:22:26.779 --> 00:22:30.574
because I felt this would
be enormously difficult

00:22:30.574 --> 00:22:33.064
which it was, and that at the end of it

00:22:33.064 --> 00:22:34.794
there would be a bunch of reviewers

00:22:34.794 --> 00:22:36.607
like Christopher Hitchens who would be

00:22:36.607 --> 00:22:39.189
extremely nasty about it whatever I did,

00:22:39.189 --> 00:22:41.712
and although Chris Hitchens
didn't live to review the book,

00:22:41.712 --> 00:22:46.641
there were a few reviewers
of that kind of variety.

00:22:46.641 --> 00:22:50.933
So I hesitated but then
he cleverly invited me

00:22:50.933 --> 00:22:52.760
to come and look at some of the material

00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:54.311
in his private papers,

00:22:54.311 --> 00:22:56.562
and I remember sitting in Connecticut

00:22:56.562 --> 00:22:59.281
and looking through boxes of stuff

00:22:59.281 --> 00:23:03.491
from that early period and
finding that diary from 1964

00:23:03.491 --> 00:23:05.733
and realizing that it really was

00:23:05.733 --> 00:23:08.696
a fascinating and untold story.

00:23:08.696 --> 00:23:11.359
It was that same day
that I saw some of his

00:23:11.359 --> 00:23:15.141
letters from the 1940s to his parents.

00:23:15.141 --> 00:23:17.905
Saw an essay that he'd
written during World War II

00:23:17.905 --> 00:23:19.650
at the time of his witnessing

00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:21.791
the liberation of a concentration camp,

00:23:21.791 --> 00:23:23.955
and I saw immediately
in this early material

00:23:23.955 --> 00:23:26.911
a completely different figure
from the Henry Kissinger

00:23:26.911 --> 00:23:30.498
of established accounts
and indeed popular legend.

00:23:30.498 --> 00:23:32.555
So I was attracted to the project

00:23:32.555 --> 00:23:36.722
because it seemed like an
opportunity to recast reputation,

00:23:38.776 --> 00:23:41.554
and that's what I, I guess
I'm in the midst of doing.

00:23:41.554 --> 00:23:43.836
I was right that it would be
an enormous amount of work.

00:23:43.836 --> 00:23:46.669
- And what's extraordinary in your

00:23:47.669 --> 00:23:51.256
extremely well-written book
which reads like a novel,

00:23:51.256 --> 00:23:54.673
is as you quote from Kissinger's writings

00:23:55.813 --> 00:23:58.910
when he's in the military and then when

00:23:58.910 --> 00:24:01.977
he's in military
intelligence after the war,

00:24:01.977 --> 00:24:03.227
the clarity and

00:24:05.909 --> 00:24:09.159
incisive writing that he was capable of

00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:14.673
at say the young age of 22
when some of this was written.

00:24:14.673 --> 00:24:16.103
- Writing of course in the language

00:24:16.103 --> 00:24:19.226
that he'd only begun
to learn really in 1938

00:24:19.226 --> 00:24:20.837
when he arrived in New York City.

00:24:20.837 --> 00:24:23.545
Yeah, these early
documents are fascinating,

00:24:23.545 --> 00:24:26.637
and I realized that I
was going to be telling

00:24:26.637 --> 00:24:29.817
the story of a really quite amazing life.

00:24:29.817 --> 00:24:32.714
Even the first half is a series of lives.

00:24:32.714 --> 00:24:34.047
Refugee in 1938,

00:24:35.505 --> 00:24:38.576
member of the proletariat in 39, 40.

00:24:38.576 --> 00:24:40.907
Working in a shaving brush factory--

00:24:40.907 --> 00:24:41.740
- [Harry] In New York.

00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:45.366
- In New York City working nights,

00:24:45.366 --> 00:24:48.405
and then he's a soldier,
then he's an infantryman,

00:24:48.405 --> 00:24:49.578
and then he's a Nazi hunter

00:24:49.578 --> 00:24:52.183
because he gets pulled out of the ranks

00:24:52.183 --> 00:24:54.155
around about the time of
the Battle of the Bulge

00:24:54.155 --> 00:24:56.727
and becomes a counterintelligence agent.

00:24:56.727 --> 00:24:58.789
Which meant in the final phase of the war

00:24:58.789 --> 00:25:02.563
in the early stage of the US
occupation of southern Germany,

00:25:02.563 --> 00:25:05.609
tracking down the most
egregious offenders.

00:25:05.609 --> 00:25:07.847
So even that early part of his life

00:25:07.847 --> 00:25:10.268
an extraordinary amount happened,

00:25:10.268 --> 00:25:13.598
and luckily for me the
biographer it was quite

00:25:13.598 --> 00:25:17.169
well-documented in
letters and other writings

00:25:17.169 --> 00:25:21.185
that survived, and then
there's a whole other chapter

00:25:21.185 --> 00:25:22.728
which is really a kind of chapter

00:25:22.728 --> 00:25:25.642
in American intellectual history.

00:25:25.642 --> 00:25:27.346
The chapter of his Harvard career

00:25:27.346 --> 00:25:29.769
as an undergraduate, a graduate,

00:25:29.769 --> 00:25:31.835
and then a junior faculty member

00:25:31.835 --> 00:25:33.671
and ultimately a tenured faculty member.

00:25:33.671 --> 00:25:36.304
That was a story that I also
found quite fascinating.

00:25:36.304 --> 00:25:37.559
- And we'll talk about that in a minute

00:25:37.559 --> 00:25:41.617
but I want to understand
the challenge that you face,

00:25:41.617 --> 00:25:44.430
because you're living in our times.

00:25:44.430 --> 00:25:48.597
you have a long list of
books on finance and power,

00:25:51.266 --> 00:25:53.469
and you're dealing with a

00:25:53.469 --> 00:25:56.136
man who's become a misunderstood

00:25:57.068 --> 00:25:58.464
very controversial figure.

00:25:58.464 --> 00:26:01.072
What are the challenges you face

00:26:01.072 --> 00:26:05.021
as you go through all
of this documentation,

00:26:05.021 --> 00:26:09.188
ordering it but then bringing
an interpretation to it?

00:26:10.724 --> 00:26:13.206
- I suppose in terms of its scale,

00:26:13.206 --> 00:26:15.953
this book is a little bit like the history

00:26:15.953 --> 00:26:18.405
of the Rothschild banks and family

00:26:18.405 --> 00:26:20.311
that I wrote in the 1990s,

00:26:20.311 --> 00:26:24.355
and it's similar in a couple
of other respects too.

00:26:24.355 --> 00:26:27.432
First this is a chapter in Jewish history

00:26:27.432 --> 00:26:30.906
and history of the Jewish Diaspora,

00:26:30.906 --> 00:26:33.239
and secondly it is a subject

00:26:35.121 --> 00:26:37.888
that is highly controversial.

00:26:37.888 --> 00:26:40.075
In the 19th century the
Rothschilds were seen

00:26:40.075 --> 00:26:43.660
as wielding a malign and excessive power

00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:47.465
because of the size of
their financial network.

00:26:47.465 --> 00:26:51.002
Well in the late 20th century
and it continues to this day,

00:26:51.002 --> 00:26:53.407
Henry Kissinger has come to be identified

00:26:53.407 --> 00:26:57.399
as wielding a kind of
malign and excessive power,

00:26:57.399 --> 00:27:00.732
and if you are a connoisseur
of conspiracy theory websites

00:27:00.732 --> 00:27:03.148
you'll find often that the
Rothschilds and Kissinger

00:27:03.148 --> 00:27:07.215
appear in the same
rather sinister diagrams

00:27:07.215 --> 00:27:11.099
that the conspiracy theorists like to draw

00:27:11.099 --> 00:27:14.192
with the Illuminati at the
top and the Bilderberg Group

00:27:14.192 --> 00:27:15.666
somewhere in the middle,

00:27:15.666 --> 00:27:19.333
so I think this is a
similar problem in that

00:27:20.309 --> 00:27:24.142
we have a phenomenon
that has been represented

00:27:25.078 --> 00:27:27.864
often in an extraordinarily
negative light,

00:27:27.864 --> 00:27:31.652
that was historically
significant and can be approached

00:27:31.652 --> 00:27:34.294
by the methods of historical scholarship.

00:27:34.294 --> 00:27:36.391
Using in both cases
documents that nobody else

00:27:36.391 --> 00:27:38.980
has ever really had access to.

00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:41.397
- As I went through the book,

00:27:43.847 --> 00:27:46.684
it's almost like there
are four themes in a way

00:27:46.684 --> 00:27:49.601
implicit in what you're discussing.

00:27:50.966 --> 00:27:53.204
Let me just throw these out at you.

00:27:53.204 --> 00:27:56.328
One is Kissinger's ambition,

00:27:56.328 --> 00:27:57.995
and how he climbs up

00:28:00.843 --> 00:28:05.676
the ladder of success in
the national security field.

00:28:05.676 --> 00:28:09.343
Another is the development
of his character.

00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:13.893
Thirdly is the history of ideas,

00:28:13.893 --> 00:28:15.998
because you call him an idealist

00:28:15.998 --> 00:28:17.924
and you explain why that is.

00:28:17.924 --> 00:28:22.420
So he is a man of ideas who
during this period really

00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:23.253
struggles

00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:25.910
with ideas,

00:28:25.910 --> 00:28:27.761
but then there's a body
of his experiences.

00:28:27.761 --> 00:28:29.288
You've listed some of them are,

00:28:29.288 --> 00:28:31.323
so all this time you're really

00:28:31.323 --> 00:28:36.136
tracking four lines of
development, is that fair?

00:28:36.136 --> 00:28:37.027
- I think it is.

00:28:37.027 --> 00:28:39.408
I mean part of the challenge
of writing a biography

00:28:39.408 --> 00:28:43.725
if one wants to just focus on
that as a technical problem,

00:28:43.725 --> 00:28:47.129
is that human beings are very complicated,

00:28:47.129 --> 00:28:50.796
and often do and think
contradictory things,

00:28:51.679 --> 00:28:55.906
but when we read about lives
we want them to make sense.

00:28:55.906 --> 00:28:58.731
We want there to be
some literary coherence,

00:28:58.731 --> 00:29:00.868
and so the biographers challenge,

00:29:00.868 --> 00:29:04.006
which distinguishes us
from writers of fiction is

00:29:04.006 --> 00:29:07.533
that we have to make sense
of the really complex

00:29:07.533 --> 00:29:09.568
and sometimes contradictory characters

00:29:09.568 --> 00:29:12.355
that we have to deal with
and we have to recognize

00:29:12.355 --> 00:29:14.818
that people change over time.

00:29:14.818 --> 00:29:17.676
That the Kissinger of say

00:29:17.676 --> 00:29:21.093
age 22 at the final phase of World War II

00:29:22.352 --> 00:29:26.519
is not the same Kissinger who
is running US foreign policy

00:29:27.822 --> 00:29:31.989
in 1973-74, so I think that's
a kind of technical challenge.

00:29:33.638 --> 00:29:36.235
The only way that I think
you can overcome that

00:29:36.235 --> 00:29:39.467
and retain the readers engagement,

00:29:39.467 --> 00:29:41.634
is very explicitly to show

00:29:42.819 --> 00:29:46.238
where you think the turning points were.

00:29:46.238 --> 00:29:49.231
I don't for example
think that Kissinger was

00:29:49.231 --> 00:29:53.518
driven by worldly ambition
throughout his life.

00:29:53.518 --> 00:29:55.888
If you read Walter
Isaacson's earlier biography

00:29:55.888 --> 00:29:57.567
you definitely think that,

00:29:57.567 --> 00:30:00.027
but it came to me as rather different

00:30:00.027 --> 00:30:02.077
as I went through the documents.

00:30:02.077 --> 00:30:04.760
I think there was an
intellectual ambition there

00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:07.509
that was inspired by
Fritz Kramer, his mentor,

00:30:07.509 --> 00:30:09.201
whom he got to know during the war,

00:30:09.201 --> 00:30:12.469
and that certainly
propelled him to Harvard

00:30:12.469 --> 00:30:14.867
and through some fairly intensive study

00:30:14.867 --> 00:30:16.922
as an undergraduate and graduate,

00:30:16.922 --> 00:30:19.354
but I don't think there was
much worldly ambition there

00:30:19.354 --> 00:30:23.136
until much later, and
in fact his early forays

00:30:23.136 --> 00:30:28.006
into the non-academic world of
power were quite disastrous.

00:30:28.006 --> 00:30:31.663
So the notion of somebody
carefully planning

00:30:31.663 --> 00:30:34.016
his ascent up the greasy
pole which I think you get

00:30:34.016 --> 00:30:37.259
in other earlier books
doesn't really seem to me

00:30:37.259 --> 00:30:39.774
to stand up to close scrutiny.

00:30:39.774 --> 00:30:41.745
Just to give you one example,

00:30:41.745 --> 00:30:44.828
why if you were ruthlessly ambitious,

00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:50.252
would you stick with Nelson
Rockefeller through three

00:30:50.252 --> 00:30:53.117
unsuccessful bids for the
Republican nomination?

00:30:53.117 --> 00:30:55.795
I mean surely after two failures

00:30:55.795 --> 00:30:57.930
you'd have jumped ship and signed up

00:30:57.930 --> 00:31:02.142
with the more likely winner
in 1968 Richard Nixon,

00:31:02.142 --> 00:31:05.258
but Kissinger you was
very reluctant to do that

00:31:05.258 --> 00:31:08.956
and indeed effectively asked
Rockefeller's permission

00:31:08.956 --> 00:31:11.522
to accept when Nixon offered him a job.

00:31:11.522 --> 00:31:15.817
So I think that story is not
the story that you're used to.

00:31:15.817 --> 00:31:20.629
It's a story of of a rather
academic and cerebral guy

00:31:20.629 --> 00:31:23.550
who ends up in the policy sphere

00:31:23.550 --> 00:31:25.547
because he kind of wants
to influence policy

00:31:25.547 --> 00:31:28.150
because he thinks mistakes are being made.

00:31:28.150 --> 00:31:30.319
It's not somebody I think
who's pursuing power

00:31:30.319 --> 00:31:32.213
as an end in itself,

00:31:32.213 --> 00:31:35.245
and that brings me to
one of your other themes,

00:31:35.245 --> 00:31:37.815
and that's the theme of the idealist.

00:31:37.815 --> 00:31:42.222
I think that subtitle is
not just a provocation,

00:31:42.222 --> 00:31:44.613
though some people have read as such.

00:31:44.613 --> 00:31:48.805
It's an attempt to show
that in strict terms,

00:31:48.805 --> 00:31:51.300
Kissinger was an idealist.

00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:54.029
He was not a realist in the
sense that we use the term

00:31:54.029 --> 00:31:56.817
and debates about international relations.

00:31:56.817 --> 00:32:00.267
He was an idealist in philosophical terms.

00:32:00.267 --> 00:32:02.245
He was somebody who criticized realism

00:32:02.245 --> 00:32:04.230
looking back on the 1930s.

00:32:04.230 --> 00:32:06.219
He says of Chamberlain,

00:32:06.219 --> 00:32:08.617
he thought of himself as a tough realist,

00:32:08.617 --> 00:32:10.786
that's not intended as a compliment.

00:32:10.786 --> 00:32:12.174
- And he's also critical of Bismarck.

00:32:12.174 --> 00:32:13.178
- Absolutely.
- Also, yeah.

00:32:13.178 --> 00:32:15.558
- So Bismarck is often
identified with Kissinger

00:32:15.558 --> 00:32:17.692
because Kissinger wrote
an essay about Bismarck

00:32:17.692 --> 00:32:20.051
and people who can't really
be bothered to read the essay

00:32:20.051 --> 00:32:22.810
say oh well, he was obviously
the American Bismarck,

00:32:22.810 --> 00:32:26.036
but when you read what
Kissinger wrote about Bismarck,

00:32:26.036 --> 00:32:30.751
including an unpublished book
that I found in his papers,

00:32:30.751 --> 00:32:34.247
you find that essentially
it's a critique of Bismarck

00:32:34.247 --> 00:32:36.887
which culminates in an
extraordinary passage

00:32:36.887 --> 00:32:39.940
in which Kissinger says
you can't base policy

00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:42.373
on cynicism and realism

00:32:42.373 --> 00:32:44.481
because the public won't be with you,

00:32:44.481 --> 00:32:47.198
and ultimately you'll
end up pursuing power

00:32:47.198 --> 00:32:50.388
as an end rather than as a means.

00:32:50.388 --> 00:32:54.816
So I think the young
Kissinger defined himself in

00:32:54.816 --> 00:32:57.983
contradistinction to realism.

00:32:57.983 --> 00:33:02.115
This is also true in his
interactions with Hans Morgenthau,

00:33:02.115 --> 00:33:04.067
it was true when it came to debating

00:33:04.067 --> 00:33:06.484
a whole series of practical policy issues,

00:33:06.484 --> 00:33:07.869
Vietnam in particular.

00:33:07.869 --> 00:33:08.796
- [Harry] Nuclear weapons.

00:33:08.796 --> 00:33:10.376
Nuclear weapons produced the,

00:33:10.376 --> 00:33:12.467
I suppose the reputation making book

00:33:12.467 --> 00:33:14.742
Nuclear Weapons and Foreign Policy,

00:33:14.742 --> 00:33:16.004
but in that book,

00:33:16.004 --> 00:33:18.757
which again there's been
much misrepresented,

00:33:18.757 --> 00:33:21.970
Kissinger's making an
argument about strategy

00:33:21.970 --> 00:33:23.843
which is essentially based on the notion

00:33:23.843 --> 00:33:27.332
that you have to have
some option in between

00:33:27.332 --> 00:33:30.829
surrender and blowing the
world to kingdom come.

00:33:30.829 --> 00:33:32.571
It's not that Kissinger was itching

00:33:32.571 --> 00:33:34.399
for a limited nuclear war,

00:33:34.399 --> 00:33:37.337
it was that he saw you had
to have a credible threat

00:33:37.337 --> 00:33:41.198
of an intermediate stage in
order to have any leverage

00:33:41.198 --> 00:33:42.827
in negotiations with the Soviets,

00:33:42.827 --> 00:33:44.562
and I actually think that
turned out to be right.

00:33:44.562 --> 00:33:48.123
- It's interesting
because in a way what this

00:33:48.123 --> 00:33:51.206
first volume indicates that was that,

00:33:52.233 --> 00:33:54.816
is that Kissinger was a student

00:33:57.017 --> 00:34:00.757
of the world that he would
inhabit in the second volume.

00:34:00.757 --> 00:34:04.168
And from all this reading in this march

00:34:04.168 --> 00:34:07.172
through his early years you're coming up

00:34:07.172 --> 00:34:09.242
with certain themes,

00:34:09.242 --> 00:34:13.684
certain conclusions that
he came up with about

00:34:13.684 --> 00:34:16.381
international politics and strategy,

00:34:16.381 --> 00:34:18.306
and I want to talk about those now,

00:34:18.306 --> 00:34:20.994
but we have yet to test them,

00:34:20.994 --> 00:34:23.439
and presumably that comes
in the second volume.

00:34:23.439 --> 00:34:26.867
Whether he will stick to those themes

00:34:26.867 --> 00:34:30.334
and whether he will, how he will deal

00:34:30.334 --> 00:34:32.743
with the contradictions
between those themes.

00:34:32.743 --> 00:34:34.502
- That's absolutely correct Harry.

00:34:34.502 --> 00:34:36.012
I mean volume two will probably

00:34:36.012 --> 00:34:38.914
be called The Realm of Power.

00:34:38.914 --> 00:34:41.595
I give my wife credit for this.

00:34:41.595 --> 00:34:44.325
I used the phrase in one
of the earliest talks

00:34:44.325 --> 00:34:46.308
I gave about the book
and afterwards she said

00:34:46.308 --> 00:34:48.778
that's your subtitle for volume two,

00:34:48.778 --> 00:34:51.172
and I think it's right
because in volume two

00:34:51.172 --> 00:34:53.710
he's no longer really the subject of,

00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:55.944
as it were, every sentence he's an object

00:34:55.944 --> 00:34:58.590
of this extraordinary
complex realm of power

00:34:58.590 --> 00:35:01.962
in Washington DC in which at first

00:35:01.962 --> 00:35:05.031
he's rather a small player.

00:35:05.031 --> 00:35:09.175
And I am very fascinated in
volume two to tell the story

00:35:09.175 --> 00:35:13.342
of his rise from real obscurity
as National Security Advisor

00:35:14.326 --> 00:35:16.991
to position of almost total dominance

00:35:16.991 --> 00:35:20.233
in the final phase of
the Nixon administration.

00:35:20.233 --> 00:35:24.024
I think that the real trick
here is to try to show

00:35:24.024 --> 00:35:27.344
how far the theories that he'd mapped out

00:35:27.344 --> 00:35:29.757
in the Academy while at Harvard,

00:35:29.757 --> 00:35:32.536
helped him in his time in government.

00:35:32.536 --> 00:35:34.885
Kissinger says in his own memoirs that

00:35:34.885 --> 00:35:37.605
you kind of live off your
existing intellectual capital

00:35:37.605 --> 00:35:41.242
from the moment that you enter government.

00:35:41.242 --> 00:35:44.120
You don't have time to add
to your intellectual capital,

00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:45.106
you don't have time to read,

00:35:45.106 --> 00:35:47.895
it's what you arrive
knowing that helps you,

00:35:47.895 --> 00:35:50.299
and I'm fascinated to to
look at the ways in which

00:35:50.299 --> 00:35:53.417
that intellectual capital helped him,

00:35:53.417 --> 00:35:55.449
and the ways in which he had ultimately

00:35:55.449 --> 00:35:58.148
to reject some of the more,

00:35:58.148 --> 00:35:59.708
some of the more idealistic notions

00:35:59.708 --> 00:36:03.233
that he'd acquired in the 1950s and 60s.

00:36:03.233 --> 00:36:06.650
- So in a way he's heading through time,

00:36:07.936 --> 00:36:12.103
through extraordinary
opportunities and experiences,

00:36:13.146 --> 00:36:16.063
networking with a series of mentors

00:36:17.485 --> 00:36:21.985
who contributed to his
intellectual development

00:36:21.985 --> 00:36:24.902
and his understanding of policy and

00:36:26.845 --> 00:36:31.012
ultimately reaching certain
very important conclusions

00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:36.397
about what policymaking and
strategic thinking was about.

00:36:40.174 --> 00:36:41.503
That's where we are basic.

00:36:41.503 --> 00:36:42.788
And I--

00:36:42.788 --> 00:36:43.714
- [Niall] Right.

00:36:43.714 --> 00:36:45.047
- Yeah go ahead.

00:36:46.618 --> 00:36:49.747
- Fritz Kraemer is this
extraordinary figure

00:36:49.747 --> 00:36:54.394
he meets in the US Army,
another exile from Nazi Germany,

00:36:54.394 --> 00:36:58.149
who's the one who spots
Kissinger's intellectual potential

00:36:58.149 --> 00:37:01.802
and says you know forget
accountancy at City College,

00:37:01.802 --> 00:37:02.964
you've got to go to Harvard

00:37:02.964 --> 00:37:04.948
and study philosophy and history,

00:37:04.948 --> 00:37:07.473
and I think that's very important
this moment of discovery

00:37:07.473 --> 00:37:10.679
by the somewhat Mephistophelean
figure of Kraemer

00:37:10.679 --> 00:37:11.921
who continues to play a part

00:37:11.921 --> 00:37:14.295
in the second half of the story,

00:37:14.295 --> 00:37:16.151
but then there's another
mentor at Harvard,

00:37:16.151 --> 00:37:17.712
the rather larger than life

00:37:17.712 --> 00:37:20.212
Professor William Yandell Elliott

00:37:20.212 --> 00:37:23.713
who sends Kissinger off to read
the works of Immanuel Kant.

00:37:23.713 --> 00:37:25.446
Kant's a big part of the early

00:37:25.446 --> 00:37:27.513
Kissinger's intellectual development.

00:37:27.513 --> 00:37:29.190
That's a sense in which he's really

00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:32.101
an idealist in philosophical terms.

00:37:32.101 --> 00:37:33.971
Then there's Nelson Rockefeller,

00:37:33.971 --> 00:37:37.092
completely different figure
who's attractive to Kissinger

00:37:37.092 --> 00:37:39.675
because he seems like a
kind of Renaissance prince

00:37:39.675 --> 00:37:41.604
and Kissinger sees himself as advising

00:37:41.604 --> 00:37:45.669
this politically powerful
and charismatic figure

00:37:45.669 --> 00:37:48.025
who's not terribly intellectual, cerebral,

00:37:48.025 --> 00:37:51.172
but quite likes to have
bright brains around him.

00:37:51.172 --> 00:37:54.461
At each stage in the
story there's somebody

00:37:54.461 --> 00:37:57.951
shaping and influencing
the young Kissinger,

00:37:57.951 --> 00:38:00.847
but there's also a kind of product.

00:38:00.847 --> 00:38:05.014
An idea takes wing and
produces some written work.

00:38:05.984 --> 00:38:08.380
The extraordinary book that he writes

00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:12.224
on the Congress of Vienna,
this is A World Restored,

00:38:12.224 --> 00:38:14.331
in many ways the best book he ever wrote,

00:38:14.331 --> 00:38:16.999
an astonishing the brilliant exposition

00:38:16.999 --> 00:38:19.822
of what the balance of power really means.

00:38:19.822 --> 00:38:22.439
A book that policymakers
should all be made to read

00:38:22.439 --> 00:38:25.041
because they mostly have
a completely false idea

00:38:25.041 --> 00:38:26.475
of the balance of power,

00:38:26.475 --> 00:38:28.923
and then later on you have other really

00:38:28.923 --> 00:38:30.405
quite influential books like

00:38:30.405 --> 00:38:32.702
Nuclear Weapons and Foreign Policy.

00:38:32.702 --> 00:38:36.128
I think the balance of
power is the central

00:38:36.128 --> 00:38:38.655
Kissingerian concept.

00:38:38.655 --> 00:38:41.626
If you look at his most
recent book World Order,

00:38:41.626 --> 00:38:45.598
it's still pretty much as it was defined

00:38:45.598 --> 00:38:47.265
in A World Restored,

00:38:48.155 --> 00:38:50.690
and there are two things
about the balance of power

00:38:50.690 --> 00:38:53.042
that Kissinger saw that very few

00:38:53.042 --> 00:38:55.262
of his contemporaries appreciated,

00:38:55.262 --> 00:38:57.249
and it's still not properly understood

00:38:57.249 --> 00:38:59.499
by most policymakers today.

00:39:00.403 --> 00:39:03.119
Number one it's not naturally occurring.

00:39:03.119 --> 00:39:05.282
There needs to be a balancer.

00:39:05.282 --> 00:39:07.958
There needs to be in
fact an active management

00:39:07.958 --> 00:39:10.553
of the balance in order
to achieve anything

00:39:10.553 --> 00:39:13.537
like an equilibrium in
the international system,

00:39:13.537 --> 00:39:16.866
and two, it needs to have legitimacy.

00:39:16.866 --> 00:39:20.423
The order, the balance,
needs to be legitimate

00:39:20.423 --> 00:39:23.463
in the eyes of all the different elements

00:39:23.463 --> 00:39:26.279
and if it's not, if there's
a revolutionary power

00:39:26.279 --> 00:39:28.767
that comes along and
questions that legitimacy,

00:39:28.767 --> 00:39:31.328
then it will be very hard
indeed to avoid conflict.

00:39:31.328 --> 00:39:34.357
That's a very useful way
of thinking about say,

00:39:34.357 --> 00:39:36.563
the modern Middle East.

00:39:36.563 --> 00:39:39.666
At a time when the Obama administration

00:39:39.666 --> 00:39:44.445
has placed a very big bet on
its nuclear deal with Iran,

00:39:44.445 --> 00:39:46.416
predicated on a notion of balance

00:39:46.416 --> 00:39:48.381
that the president made quite explicit

00:39:48.381 --> 00:39:50.932
in some of the interviews
he gave him the subject,

00:39:50.932 --> 00:39:54.513
the possibility exists
that in Kissinger's terms,

00:39:54.513 --> 00:39:56.722
you're not going to get balance at all

00:39:56.722 --> 00:39:58.989
because you're not
really achieving balance,

00:39:58.989 --> 00:40:00.523
you're achieving an arms race.

00:40:00.523 --> 00:40:03.853
You're destabilizing and
delegitimizing the order

00:40:03.853 --> 00:40:07.080
because Iran's a
revolutionary power itself.

00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:09.879
I think that's a very
helpful conceptual framework.

00:40:09.879 --> 00:40:11.800
One that I hadn't fully appreciated

00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:14.164
until I sat down and read my way

00:40:14.164 --> 00:40:15.751
through Kissinger's academic work,

00:40:15.751 --> 00:40:18.225
and I do think that even
if he'd never become

00:40:18.225 --> 00:40:20.321
Secretary of State, if
he'd been hit by a bus

00:40:20.321 --> 00:40:23.874
in January 1969 we would still have

00:40:23.874 --> 00:40:26.981
an incredibly important life to consider

00:40:26.981 --> 00:40:30.186
and a major contribution to the theory

00:40:30.186 --> 00:40:34.373
of international relations
and and indeed modern history.

00:40:34.373 --> 00:40:36.202
- Let me go over some of the themes

00:40:36.202 --> 00:40:38.374
that you pull out of there.

00:40:38.374 --> 00:40:40.928
As he's at the end of your book

00:40:40.928 --> 00:40:42.976
he's about to go to the White House,

00:40:42.976 --> 00:40:46.688
he's been picked as
National Security Advisor,

00:40:46.688 --> 00:40:49.481
and you say he brought to the White House

00:40:49.481 --> 00:40:53.156
his sense that most strategic choices

00:40:53.156 --> 00:40:56.239
are between lesser and greater evils.

00:40:57.315 --> 00:40:59.444
- This is a very important point.

00:40:59.444 --> 00:41:02.890
It may seem obvious, but
sometimes you get the impression

00:41:02.890 --> 00:41:07.049
in discussions of foreign
policy that people expect

00:41:07.049 --> 00:41:10.399
there to be a mother
who's an apple pie option,

00:41:10.399 --> 00:41:13.461
but there are very, very few
of those in foreign policy

00:41:13.461 --> 00:41:16.065
and most decisions are
choices between evils.

00:41:16.065 --> 00:41:18.854
Kissinger writes this in the 1950s

00:41:18.854 --> 00:41:21.485
long before he's anywhere
near the corridors of power.

00:41:21.485 --> 00:41:23.627
He says in the Cold War
we have to face the fact

00:41:23.627 --> 00:41:25.473
that most of the choices
we'll have to make

00:41:25.473 --> 00:41:29.452
will be between evils and
it will take a certain

00:41:29.452 --> 00:41:32.384
morality to be able to make those choices

00:41:32.384 --> 00:41:34.214
and recognize that they are,

00:41:34.214 --> 00:41:35.608
when we choose the lesser evil

00:41:35.608 --> 00:41:38.494
we are doing it in the
pursuit of a greater good.

00:41:38.494 --> 00:41:40.212
I think that's a really really important

00:41:40.212 --> 00:41:43.826
Kissingerian insight and I'm
constantly reminded of it,

00:41:43.826 --> 00:41:48.110
because most people who
write from the academic world

00:41:48.110 --> 00:41:51.928
about foreign policy, are
very good at criticizing

00:41:51.928 --> 00:41:55.715
the decisions that presidents
and secretaries of state take,

00:41:55.715 --> 00:41:59.678
but they very seldom
make explicit what this

00:41:59.678 --> 00:42:03.413
preferable alternative
would have looked like.

00:42:03.413 --> 00:42:05.681
They're far happier just pointing out

00:42:05.681 --> 00:42:08.892
that the act that was chosen was evil,

00:42:08.892 --> 00:42:10.872
but if the choice was between evils

00:42:10.872 --> 00:42:14.253
what you really have to show
is that it was more evil

00:42:14.253 --> 00:42:17.142
than some available realistic alternative,

00:42:17.142 --> 00:42:18.888
and very very few people who write

00:42:18.888 --> 00:42:20.823
about foreign policy do that.

00:42:20.823 --> 00:42:22.789
They just let you think as a reader

00:42:22.789 --> 00:42:24.645
that there was some much easier thing

00:42:24.645 --> 00:42:26.764
that would have, say,
ended the war in Vietnam

00:42:26.764 --> 00:42:29.656
sometime in February 1969.

00:42:29.656 --> 00:42:31.761
- The other point that he emphasizes

00:42:31.761 --> 00:42:36.256
is the importance of
historical self-understanding.

00:42:36.256 --> 00:42:41.153
To not only understand how
to deal with adversaries

00:42:41.153 --> 00:42:44.486
but how you can deal with them basically

00:42:45.334 --> 00:42:47.589
'cause of the pressures they're under.

00:42:47.589 --> 00:42:50.151
- I think at a time when
game theory was becoming

00:42:50.151 --> 00:42:54.179
increasingly fashionable
amongst nuclear strategists,

00:42:54.179 --> 00:42:57.928
Kissinger stood out as
somebody who studied history,

00:42:57.928 --> 00:43:00.919
and let's face it, if you
were an ambitious young man

00:43:00.919 --> 00:43:04.713
in the early 1950s you
probably wouldn't choose

00:43:04.713 --> 00:43:07.863
as a topic for your doctoral
dissertation the time of

00:43:07.863 --> 00:43:11.219
Castlereagh Metternich in
the Congress of Vienna,

00:43:11.219 --> 00:43:13.469
so Kissinger chose history,

00:43:14.539 --> 00:43:17.002
and focused on historical knowledge

00:43:17.002 --> 00:43:19.836
at a time when it was
far from fashionable,

00:43:19.836 --> 00:43:21.716
and I think this is
another argument against

00:43:21.716 --> 00:43:25.883
the scheming ambitious
figure in other biographies.

00:43:26.922 --> 00:43:30.605
The key insight that
Kissinger gleaned early on

00:43:30.605 --> 00:43:33.476
was that history is to states

00:43:33.476 --> 00:43:35.760
what character is to individuals.

00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:37.708
If you don't know the history of Russia,

00:43:37.708 --> 00:43:40.090
you will not be able to understand

00:43:40.090 --> 00:43:43.003
the way in which the Russian leader,

00:43:43.003 --> 00:43:46.134
in our time President Putin, thinks.

00:43:46.134 --> 00:43:50.374
You won't understand what
it is that he prioritizes,

00:43:50.374 --> 00:43:54.940
and therefore you won't
really understand your rival.

00:43:54.940 --> 00:43:58.620
You're negotiating with
somebody whose character

00:43:58.620 --> 00:44:01.491
has been shaped by
their country's history,

00:44:01.491 --> 00:44:03.746
and this importance
that Kissinger attaches

00:44:03.746 --> 00:44:06.007
to historical understanding
was one of the things

00:44:06.007 --> 00:44:07.901
that really drew me to the subject.

00:44:07.901 --> 00:44:11.439
There are very few people
with real historical knowledge

00:44:11.439 --> 00:44:13.571
who have entered the realm of power.

00:44:13.571 --> 00:44:16.109
Not many professors of history,

00:44:16.109 --> 00:44:17.761
although he was a professor of government,

00:44:17.761 --> 00:44:20.405
he was in effect a professor of history,

00:44:20.405 --> 00:44:23.227
not many people who have
worked in that field

00:44:23.227 --> 00:44:25.907
have ended up in the situation room,

00:44:25.907 --> 00:44:28.321
and in that sense it's quite interesting

00:44:28.321 --> 00:44:31.332
to ask how far historical knowledge

00:44:31.332 --> 00:44:34.090
really did give Kissinger an advantage.

00:44:34.090 --> 00:44:35.186
I think it did.

00:44:35.186 --> 00:44:37.570
I'm strongly of the view
that decision-makers benefit

00:44:37.570 --> 00:44:40.171
from historical knowledge if only because

00:44:40.171 --> 00:44:42.528
they understand their interlocutor better

00:44:42.528 --> 00:44:45.264
when they're negotiating
with someone from abroad.

00:44:45.264 --> 00:44:48.683
- And in making choices
a third theme is that

00:44:48.683 --> 00:44:52.648
you have to conjecture
basically about the situation.

00:44:52.648 --> 00:44:56.065
There are many known unknowns so to speak

00:44:57.727 --> 00:45:00.462
to quote Secretary Rumsfeld.

00:45:00.462 --> 00:45:02.415
- So the problem of conjecture,

00:45:02.415 --> 00:45:04.792
which is how Kissinger who describes it,

00:45:04.792 --> 00:45:08.235
is the most profound idea that I found

00:45:08.235 --> 00:45:10.175
in researching this book,

00:45:10.175 --> 00:45:13.510
and I still remember being very struck

00:45:13.510 --> 00:45:16.575
by the power of the idea
when I first encountered it

00:45:16.575 --> 00:45:19.213
in an essay from the early 1960s.

00:45:19.213 --> 00:45:22.263
This is how Kissinger explains
the problem of conjecture.

00:45:22.263 --> 00:45:26.117
He says at any given moment
a decision-maker confronts

00:45:26.117 --> 00:45:28.830
a line of least resistance which in effect

00:45:28.830 --> 00:45:30.704
involves doing nothing,

00:45:30.704 --> 00:45:33.387
or as we would say kicking
the can down the road,

00:45:33.387 --> 00:45:35.648
and hoping like Mister
Micawber and Dickens

00:45:35.648 --> 00:45:37.044
that something turns up.

00:45:37.044 --> 00:45:40.024
So you do the easy thing
and you hope for the best.

00:45:40.024 --> 00:45:43.558
The alternative is that you
take action in the here and now

00:45:43.558 --> 00:45:48.537
in the hope of averting
some disaster in the future,

00:45:48.537 --> 00:45:51.163
and that's hard to do because
if you act here and now

00:45:51.163 --> 00:45:54.973
you have to persuade people
to sacrifice resources,

00:45:54.973 --> 00:45:59.140
maybe even men to the course
of action that you've chosen.

00:46:00.220 --> 00:46:02.935
The asymmetry, and here's
the beauty of the idea,

00:46:02.935 --> 00:46:04.484
is as follows.

00:46:04.484 --> 00:46:07.148
If you are right in acting,

00:46:07.148 --> 00:46:09.587
in taking option two, the harder course

00:46:09.587 --> 00:46:13.712
and you avert disaster,
nobody will thank you,

00:46:13.712 --> 00:46:16.928
because nobody is grateful
for averted disasters,

00:46:16.928 --> 00:46:18.980
i.e. things that didn't happen.

00:46:18.980 --> 00:46:22.107
If you take the line of least
resistance and do nothing,

00:46:22.107 --> 00:46:24.551
kick the can down the
road, you may get lucky,

00:46:24.551 --> 00:46:27.954
and disaster may not happen,
but if it does happen

00:46:27.954 --> 00:46:30.413
then you'll have found out the hard way

00:46:30.413 --> 00:46:31.949
that you should have acted.

00:46:31.949 --> 00:46:33.576
So this is the central problem

00:46:33.576 --> 00:46:35.513
of conjecture for decision-makers.

00:46:35.513 --> 00:46:38.976
They cannot make the decision
on the basis of data.

00:46:38.976 --> 00:46:40.617
Kissinger's very clear about this.

00:46:40.617 --> 00:46:43.626
You can't just sit waiting for the data,

00:46:43.626 --> 00:46:45.776
for the information to
tell you what to do,

00:46:45.776 --> 00:46:47.879
because you're conjecturing
about the future

00:46:47.879 --> 00:46:49.531
at the point of decision.

00:46:49.531 --> 00:46:51.249
You have to take a decision.

00:46:51.249 --> 00:46:55.985
And he shows this I think
very elegantly with a case,

00:46:55.985 --> 00:46:57.989
historical example that
had greatly affected

00:46:57.989 --> 00:47:00.212
him and his family.

00:47:00.212 --> 00:47:01.462
He says in 1938

00:47:03.628 --> 00:47:05.294
nobody really knew if Hitler

00:47:05.294 --> 00:47:07.460
was just another German nationalist,

00:47:07.460 --> 00:47:09.964
or a genocidal maniac.

00:47:09.964 --> 00:47:12.824
Well, they opted to play for time,

00:47:12.824 --> 00:47:15.019
that was the essence of
the policy of appeasement,

00:47:15.019 --> 00:47:18.708
and they ultimately found out
that he was a genocidal maniac

00:47:18.708 --> 00:47:22.439
and tens of millions of people
lost their lives as a result,

00:47:22.439 --> 00:47:24.360
including of course least a dozen members

00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:26.869
of Kissinger's family who
died in the Holocaust.

00:47:26.869 --> 00:47:28.865
So for Kissinger the problem of conjecture

00:47:28.865 --> 00:47:32.038
was a very live, burning issue.

00:47:32.038 --> 00:47:34.197
He saw that the greatest error

00:47:34.197 --> 00:47:36.236
in 20th century international relations

00:47:36.236 --> 00:47:38.364
was the policy of appeasement,

00:47:38.364 --> 00:47:42.310
and he spent much of his career
in the 1950s and 60s and 70s

00:47:42.310 --> 00:47:46.606
trying to make sure that no
such mistake was made again.

00:47:46.606 --> 00:47:49.701
Acting rather than not acting.

00:47:49.701 --> 00:47:52.529
Rarely kicking the can down the road.

00:47:52.529 --> 00:47:54.967
Choosing between evils,

00:47:54.967 --> 00:47:58.117
and paying the price
in terms of the current

00:47:58.117 --> 00:47:59.937
and subsequent criticism,

00:47:59.937 --> 00:48:01.795
but I think always understanding clearly

00:48:01.795 --> 00:48:03.859
that there is a problem of conjecture

00:48:03.859 --> 00:48:05.574
with every decision that you take.

00:48:05.574 --> 00:48:07.580
You can never be sure you were right.

00:48:07.580 --> 00:48:09.629
You can never be sure
you averted disaster,

00:48:09.629 --> 00:48:12.076
you can never prove that detente

00:48:12.076 --> 00:48:15.906
successfully prevented World
War III from happening,

00:48:15.906 --> 00:48:17.289
to take just one example.

00:48:17.289 --> 00:48:19.513
You can't really prove that,

00:48:19.513 --> 00:48:22.337
and in that sense the statesman's fate

00:48:22.337 --> 00:48:25.145
is essentially that of a tragic hero.

00:48:25.145 --> 00:48:28.063
The statesman's trying to
conjecture about the future.

00:48:28.063 --> 00:48:31.261
The statesman as Kissinger
depicts him in A World Restored

00:48:31.261 --> 00:48:34.424
is essentially ahead of the electorate,

00:48:34.424 --> 00:48:36.287
ahead of the population,

00:48:36.287 --> 00:48:40.431
trying to see disasters that
nobody else is thinking about.

00:48:40.431 --> 00:48:43.674
If he successfully acts
to avert catastrophe,

00:48:43.674 --> 00:48:45.627
he will not be thanked for this.

00:48:45.627 --> 00:48:47.998
On the country are likely be blamed

00:48:47.998 --> 00:48:50.268
for whatever short-term action he took,

00:48:50.268 --> 00:48:52.140
and that's the tragic fate the Kissinger

00:48:52.140 --> 00:48:54.390
kind of foresaw for himself.

00:48:54.390 --> 00:48:56.342
- And finally,

00:48:56.342 --> 00:48:59.648
he came to recognize it
as his ideas develop,

00:48:59.648 --> 00:49:03.815
the importance of understanding
that you need to bring

00:49:05.494 --> 00:49:09.661
the public along with you as
you ventured into the world,

00:49:11.767 --> 00:49:13.874
and some would say he failed.

00:49:13.874 --> 00:49:16.299
We'll find out in the second volume,

00:49:16.299 --> 00:49:19.191
when he came to Vietnam
and he was in power.

00:49:19.191 --> 00:49:22.743
- This it seems to me is
another part of the tragedy.

00:49:22.743 --> 00:49:24.990
Kissinger's writing on Bismarck

00:49:24.990 --> 00:49:27.246
which we briefly talked about before

00:49:27.246 --> 00:49:31.715
identified a central problem
that if one is purely cynical

00:49:31.715 --> 00:49:34.364
and realistic in one's calculation,

00:49:34.364 --> 00:49:36.575
if one pursues a Bismarckian policy,

00:49:36.575 --> 00:49:39.476
you're unlikely to have public support

00:49:39.476 --> 00:49:41.773
because you'll be doing
things that require

00:49:41.773 --> 00:49:44.470
what Kissinger calls
the courage of cynicism,

00:49:44.470 --> 00:49:47.142
something notably lacking
in the American public.

00:49:47.142 --> 00:49:48.639
So you don't really have a choice.

00:49:48.639 --> 00:49:51.056
You've got to persuade voters

00:49:52.034 --> 00:49:55.245
that these lesser evils
really are lesser evils,

00:49:55.245 --> 00:49:56.459
and that they're worth doing to avoid

00:49:56.459 --> 00:49:59.471
future potential disasters.

00:49:59.471 --> 00:50:01.884
I think it's pretty clear already

00:50:01.884 --> 00:50:04.139
from the existing literature,

00:50:04.139 --> 00:50:08.805
that Kissinger's attempt
to sell detente politically

00:50:08.805 --> 00:50:11.044
in a series of speeches that he made

00:50:11.044 --> 00:50:13.643
all over the United States failed,

00:50:13.643 --> 00:50:15.456
and that the critique of detente

00:50:15.456 --> 00:50:19.453
that Ronald Reagan in
particular spearheaded,

00:50:19.453 --> 00:50:22.753
was very effective and ultimately detente

00:50:22.753 --> 00:50:26.206
was a dirty word by the late 1970s.

00:50:26.206 --> 00:50:28.531
So I think it's already obvious that part

00:50:28.531 --> 00:50:30.996
of what's tragic about Kissinger's story

00:50:30.996 --> 00:50:33.547
is that he can never
really persuade Americans

00:50:33.547 --> 00:50:37.502
that the strategy that he
and Richard Nixon devised

00:50:37.502 --> 00:50:40.391
in the early 1970s as a way
of dealing with America's

00:50:40.391 --> 00:50:43.562
profound problems at that
stage in the Cold War

00:50:43.562 --> 00:50:46.562
was legitimate, was the lesser evil.

00:50:48.159 --> 00:50:50.242
- So we're now positioned

00:50:51.441 --> 00:50:52.524
after reading

00:50:54.412 --> 00:50:57.412
the near 1,000 pages of your book to

00:50:58.484 --> 00:50:59.484
better judge

00:51:00.734 --> 00:51:04.745
whether Kissinger in
power in the next volume,

00:51:04.745 --> 00:51:07.328
lives up to the principles that

00:51:08.888 --> 00:51:10.388
he came to in this

00:51:12.491 --> 00:51:16.104
period when he laid the
foundation in history

00:51:16.104 --> 00:51:17.854
and in philosophy and

00:51:19.915 --> 00:51:22.414
in understanding that he came to himself.

00:51:22.414 --> 00:51:25.825
So I guess it would be to
preview for the preview,

00:51:25.825 --> 00:51:28.941
we need to go back to
Kraemer's warning to him.

00:51:28.941 --> 00:51:30.274
His mentor said,

00:51:32.385 --> 00:51:36.019
advises him that now that you
have assumed this position.

00:51:36.019 --> 00:51:40.186
it's much harder than academic
intrigue and ambition.

00:51:41.762 --> 00:51:42.929
You are tempt,

00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:46.160
gonna be tempted.

00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:48.132
You're beginning to behave in a,

00:51:48.132 --> 00:51:50.526
warns Kissinger, you're
beginning to behave in a way

00:51:50.526 --> 00:51:52.260
that there is no longer human,

00:51:52.260 --> 00:51:54.029
and people who admire you are starting

00:51:54.029 --> 00:51:57.605
to regard you as cool, perhaps even cold.

00:51:57.605 --> 00:52:01.688
You are in danger of
allowing your heart and soul

00:52:02.566 --> 00:52:05.399
to burnout in your incessant work,

00:52:06.652 --> 00:52:10.327
and he goes on to warn him
about maintaining his integrity,

00:52:10.327 --> 00:52:13.375
and respecting in the integrity of others,

00:52:13.375 --> 00:52:16.482
and to really maintain his own character.

00:52:16.482 --> 00:52:19.430
- It's not often the biographer gets

00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:22.167
documentation this good,

00:52:22.167 --> 00:52:24.589
because there's something
wonderfully literary

00:52:24.589 --> 00:52:27.637
about the way Kraemer writes,

00:52:27.637 --> 00:52:30.470
warning, admonishing, his protege.

00:52:31.417 --> 00:52:35.147
Kraemer saw himself as
a Mephistophelean figure

00:52:35.147 --> 00:52:38.647
and he clearly saw Kissinger as his Faust,

00:52:39.688 --> 00:52:41.034
so there's a sense in which Kraemer

00:52:41.034 --> 00:52:43.966
was somewhat dramatizing the relationship,

00:52:43.966 --> 00:52:46.205
but the story continues in volume two

00:52:46.205 --> 00:52:49.139
and ultimately produces a better breach

00:52:49.139 --> 00:52:52.005
between Kissinger and Kraemer,

00:52:52.005 --> 00:52:55.952
which for me is a really
critical moment in volume two.

00:52:55.952 --> 00:52:58.064
Those letters are wonderful,

00:52:58.064 --> 00:53:02.843
a wonderful source because
you see here personified

00:53:02.843 --> 00:53:06.010
that dialogue between that the worldly

00:53:07.399 --> 00:53:08.961
and the rather less worldly,

00:53:08.961 --> 00:53:12.407
between the pupil and the master,

00:53:12.407 --> 00:53:16.238
a dialogue that had begun in of all places

00:53:16.238 --> 00:53:20.405
a basic training camp in the
American South in World War II.

00:53:21.871 --> 00:53:22.704
I guess,

00:53:24.420 --> 00:53:28.016
part of the difficulty of
writing historical biography

00:53:28.016 --> 00:53:31.203
is often that you don't get the sources

00:53:31.203 --> 00:53:35.354
to give your story a real literary kick.

00:53:35.354 --> 00:53:37.453
Well thanks to Kraemer's letters

00:53:37.453 --> 00:53:41.294
I get quite a lot of literary kick here.

00:53:41.294 --> 00:53:44.082
It's really extraordinary to have

00:53:44.082 --> 00:53:47.983
the dilemmas of power
so starkly illustrated

00:53:47.983 --> 00:53:50.803
and to have somebody who
sets himself up in the role

00:53:50.803 --> 00:53:54.226
of Kissinger's conscience
and writes it all down.

00:53:54.226 --> 00:53:55.540
- One final question,

00:53:55.540 --> 00:53:58.276
we're almost out of
time so a brief answer,

00:53:58.276 --> 00:54:00.026
what have you learned

00:54:02.235 --> 00:54:03.485
from this work,

00:54:04.803 --> 00:54:07.492
over and above what you've
learned about Kissinger?

00:54:07.492 --> 00:54:10.742
How has it informed your understanding?

00:54:11.726 --> 00:54:14.395
- That's an easy question to answer.

00:54:14.395 --> 00:54:17.254
When I wrote a book called
Colossus about American power

00:54:17.254 --> 00:54:20.109
more than 10 years ago I thought
there were three deficits

00:54:20.109 --> 00:54:22.158
that constrained the United States.

00:54:22.158 --> 00:54:23.600
A man power deficit in the sense that

00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:26.292
Americans don't really
want to go abroad and work

00:54:26.292 --> 00:54:29.850
and fight in hot, poor,
dangerous countries.

00:54:29.850 --> 00:54:31.520
A fiscal deficit in the sense that

00:54:31.520 --> 00:54:34.616
the whole thing was getting
more and more unaffordable.

00:54:34.616 --> 00:54:36.276
And an attention deficit,

00:54:36.276 --> 00:54:37.942
because American voters lose interest

00:54:37.942 --> 00:54:40.595
in foreign policy after four years,

00:54:40.595 --> 00:54:43.370
but then I realized writing
the Kissinger biography

00:54:43.370 --> 00:54:46.744
that there was this fourth
deficit, the history deficit.

00:54:46.744 --> 00:54:50.628
That we actually live in the
United States of amnesia,

00:54:50.628 --> 00:54:54.010
and the lessons of Vietnam
haven't been learned at all.

00:54:54.010 --> 00:54:58.177
Somebody, I won't a name
him, who read this volume

00:54:59.080 --> 00:55:01.898
wrote to me saying couldn't
believe how familiar

00:55:01.898 --> 00:55:06.438
Kissinger's reflections on
Vietnam in the mid-1960s were,

00:55:06.438 --> 00:55:08.291
because they reminded
him of all the things

00:55:08.291 --> 00:55:12.391
that had been said about
Iraq in the mid-2000s.

00:55:12.391 --> 00:55:16.852
So part of the important
message this book conveys

00:55:16.852 --> 00:55:20.492
is that we need to make
the study of history

00:55:20.492 --> 00:55:23.236
mandatory for American decision-makers.

00:55:23.236 --> 00:55:26.759
It's not a sort of part of
the entertainment industry,

00:55:26.759 --> 00:55:29.073
it's central to how we should educate

00:55:29.073 --> 00:55:30.707
the people who run this country,

00:55:30.707 --> 00:55:34.131
and I'd say also the people
who run its major corporations.

00:55:34.131 --> 00:55:36.236
Ignorance of history turns out to be

00:55:36.236 --> 00:55:38.665
one of the most dangerous features

00:55:38.665 --> 00:55:40.426
of the American political system.

00:55:40.426 --> 00:55:44.688
We almost select out the
people who know their history

00:55:44.688 --> 00:55:46.964
and choose people who think that things

00:55:46.964 --> 00:55:49.658
can be figured out on first principles,

00:55:49.658 --> 00:55:52.435
and Kissinger saw this
problem in the 1960s.

00:55:52.435 --> 00:55:54.479
He regularly wrote about it and warned

00:55:54.479 --> 00:55:57.102
that you can't make
strategy with the techniques

00:55:57.102 --> 00:56:01.767
of a Wall Street lawyer
on a case-by-case basis.

00:56:01.767 --> 00:56:04.479
So I think that's really the big message

00:56:04.479 --> 00:56:08.515
that this book conveys,
that history is central.

00:56:08.515 --> 00:56:11.822
It's not peripheral,
it's central to strategy,

00:56:11.822 --> 00:56:13.492
and Kissinger was very unusual

00:56:13.492 --> 00:56:15.583
in his generation for seeing that.

00:56:15.583 --> 00:56:19.406
He's still unusual here in
2016 when he's 93 years old,

00:56:19.406 --> 00:56:21.871
he's still unusual for seeing that.

00:56:21.871 --> 00:56:24.782
- Well on that note Niall
I want to thank you for

00:56:24.782 --> 00:56:27.634
writing this book, which is a great read.

00:56:27.634 --> 00:56:29.722
I must tell our audience that

00:56:29.722 --> 00:56:32.048
it's like reading a novel, actually.

00:56:32.048 --> 00:56:33.200
So thank you very much.
- Praise indeed.

00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:34.073
Thank you.

00:56:34.073 --> 00:56:35.928
- And thank you very much for joining us

00:56:35.928 --> 00:56:38.997
for this Conversation With History.

00:56:38.997 --> 00:56:42.414
(gentle downbeat music)
