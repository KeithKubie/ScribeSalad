projects so the story I want to say
here's a great pleasure to have you back

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279
here's a great pleasure to have you back
 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:07.940
here's a great pleasure to have you back
here what's interesting I think about

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950
here what's interesting I think about
 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.799
here what's interesting I think about
the work of the office and actually this

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809
the work of the office and actually this
 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.390
the work of the office and actually this
goes almost back into the incubation

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400
goes almost back into the incubation
 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.240
goes almost back into the incubation
period there are not so many houses not

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250
period there are not so many houses not
 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.370
period there are not so many houses not
so many that's unusual maybe a sign like

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380
so many that's unusual maybe a sign like
 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.550
so many that's unusual maybe a sign like
don't do houses just do really big

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560
don't do houses just do really big
 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.070
don't do houses just do really big
institutions there so they have a lot of

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080
institutions there so they have a lot of
 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.089
institutions there so they have a lot of
institutions and in fact the

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099
institutions and in fact the
 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.089
institutions and in fact the
institution's to get bigger and bigger

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:28.099
institution's to get bigger and bigger
 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:30.140
institution's to get bigger and bigger
but interestingly they're kind of

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150
but interestingly they're kind of
 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.849
but interestingly they're kind of
architectural moves maybe get smaller

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859
architectural moves maybe get smaller
 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.220
architectural moves maybe get smaller
and smaller so some how is the scale of

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230
and smaller so some how is the scale of
 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.479
and smaller so some how is the scale of
the Commission the scale of the

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489
the Commission the scale of the
 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.250
the Commission the scale of the
opportunity gets bigger the actual

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260
opportunity gets bigger the actual
 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.400
opportunity gets bigger the actual
maneuvers and the precision gets more

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410
maneuvers and the precision gets more
 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.700
maneuvers and the precision gets more
these are kind of a quite simple

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710
these are kind of a quite simple
 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.750
these are kind of a quite simple
structures quite simple buildings but

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760
structures quite simple buildings but
 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.240
structures quite simple buildings but
with very complicated effects so maybe

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250
with very complicated effects so maybe
 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.880
with very complicated effects so maybe
and it's too easy to say it's I see

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890
and it's too easy to say it's I see
 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.100
and it's too easy to say it's I see
these architects very much in the in the

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110
these architects very much in the in the
 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.630
these architects very much in the in the
middle of the middle of the middle of

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640
middle of the middle of the middle of
 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.240
middle of the middle of the middle of
the mind of the architect which has

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250
the mind of the architect which has
 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.560
the mind of the architect which has
always been in mind that tries to

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570
always been in mind that tries to
 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.200
always been in mind that tries to
achieve a lot with a little bit like to

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210
achieve a lot with a little bit like to
 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.240
achieve a lot with a little bit like to
to achieve everything with almost

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250
to achieve everything with almost
 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.520
to achieve everything with almost
nothing and if the architect has not so

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530
nothing and if the architect has not so
 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.980
nothing and if the architect has not so
much big role in society nevertheless to

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990
much big role in society nevertheless to
 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.780
much big role in society nevertheless to
express the the big thoughts so

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790
express the the big thoughts so
 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.090
express the the big thoughts so
basically playing with input and output

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100
basically playing with input and output
 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.800
basically playing with input and output
like having actually quite small amount

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810
like having actually quite small amount
 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.080
like having actually quite small amount
of input and huge output quite small

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090
of input and huge output quite small
 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.770
of input and huge output quite small
elements but a big result very simple

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780
elements but a big result very simple
 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.800
elements but a big result very simple
geometry just a shifting of the color

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810
geometry just a shifting of the color
 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.080
geometry just a shifting of the color
and an explosion right so I think this

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090
and an explosion right so I think this
 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.109
and an explosion right so I think this
is in this sense they are it's gonna say

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119
is in this sense they are it's gonna say
 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.140
is in this sense they are it's gonna say
cliche but it's right in the cliche

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150
cliche but it's right in the cliche
 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.760
cliche but it's right in the cliche
understanding of what the modern

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770
understanding of what the modern
 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.010
understanding of what the modern
architect was trying to do right and so

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020
architect was trying to do right and so
 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.359
architect was trying to do right and so
in that sense I think it could be quite

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369
in that sense I think it could be quite
 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.710
in that sense I think it could be quite
simple to understand that the lecture

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720
simple to understand that the lecture
 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.920
simple to understand that the lecture
about to here is something like a kind

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930
about to here is something like a kind
 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.240
about to here is something like a kind
of update on the thinking of the

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250
of update on the thinking of the
 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.730
of update on the thinking of the
architect today working on the same

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740
architect today working on the same
 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.710
architect today working on the same
problem of all of all ways which is a

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720
problem of all of all ways which is a
 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.310
problem of all of all ways which is a
how to do a lot with a little

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320
how to do a lot with a little
 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.810
how to do a lot with a little
and I think that becomes a more

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820
and I think that becomes a more
 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.520
and I think that becomes a more
miraculous assignment when actually

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530
miraculous assignment when actually
 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.530
miraculous assignment when actually
society gives you a lot to do and right

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540
society gives you a lot to do and right
 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.899
society gives you a lot to do and right
now you have a very major role

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909

particularly I think with in the recent
 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.530
particularly I think with in the recent
thinking of the mega planning concepts

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540
thinking of the mega planning concepts
 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.660
thinking of the mega planning concepts

we remember when when we were when we
 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.660
we remember when when we were when we
were going when we were students of that

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670
were going when we were students of that

that's to say that is to say many many
years ago that we have a kind of

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670
years ago that we have a kind of
 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:18.240
years ago that we have a kind of
oppressive perplexity that we had when

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250
oppressive perplexity that we had when

when looking at the projects some

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:20.770
when looking at the projects some
 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:23.970
when looking at the projects some
sometimes we wonder if the ideas just

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980
sometimes we wonder if the ideas just
 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:31.050
sometimes we wonder if the ideas just
come and fall from the heat and so we

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060
come and fall from the heat and so we
 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.270
come and fall from the heat and so we
thought it would be interesting

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280
thought it would be interesting
 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.630
thought it would be interesting
I do interesting for you and also maybe

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640
I do interesting for you and also maybe
 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.900
I do interesting for you and also maybe
for us it will need Christine idea try

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910
for us it will need Christine idea try
 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.840
for us it will need Christine idea try
to explore where buildings come from

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850
to explore where buildings come from
 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.970
to explore where buildings come from
where architecture comes from well never

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980
where architecture comes from well never
 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:53.430
where architecture comes from well never
part well just we can after a while we

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440
part well just we can after a while we

can confirm what maybe you suspect that

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950
can confirm what maybe you suspect that

it's buildings don't come from Paris

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180
it's buildings don't come from Paris
 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.810
it's buildings don't come from Paris
directly so this is to talk about the

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820
directly so this is to talk about the
 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.840
directly so this is to talk about the
process about the making of of a of a

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:06.850
process about the making of of a of a
 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.570
process about the making of of a of a
project and we we try to speak about

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:09.580
project and we we try to speak about
 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:14.040
project and we we try to speak about
tools and strategies that we use

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:14.050
tools and strategies that we use
 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:18.510
tools and strategies that we use
throughout our work so the concerns that

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:18.520
throughout our work so the concerns that
 

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:24.480
throughout our work so the concerns that
that arise and how we went about them so

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490
that arise and how we went about them so
 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:25.409
that arise and how we went about them so
we

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:25.419
we
 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:28.800
we
we will begin at the beginning it would

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810
we will begin at the beginning it would
 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:29.850
we will begin at the beginning it would
have been at the beginning of this

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860
have been at the beginning of this

which well of course is not the truth we

00:08:05.939 --> 00:08:05.949
which well of course is not the truth we
 

00:08:05.949 --> 00:08:09.180
which well of course is not the truth we
are not giving you the truth not even we

are not giving you the truth not even we
 

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:11.909
are not giving you the truth not even we
are giving you our truth I mean we're

are giving you our truth I mean we're
giving just an idea of how it will be

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:15.880
giving just an idea of how it will be

possible to organize or to work with the

00:08:20.159 --> 00:08:20.169
possible to organize or to work with the
 

00:08:20.169 --> 00:08:23.550
possible to organize or to work with the
things we have around in order to form a

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:23.560
things we have around in order to form a
 

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:27.300
things we have around in order to form a
project so at a certain moment some part

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:27.310
project so at a certain moment some part
 

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:30.959
project so at a certain moment some part
of this huge world will have around it

00:08:30.959 --> 00:08:30.969
of this huge world will have around it
 

00:08:30.969 --> 00:08:34.440
of this huge world will have around it
will form part of the project and a

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:34.450
will form part of the project and a
 

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:38.639
will form part of the project and a
process of transformation it's needed in

00:08:38.639 --> 00:08:38.649
process of transformation it's needed in
 

00:08:38.649 --> 00:08:41.760
process of transformation it's needed in
order to put together all these things

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:41.770
order to put together all these things
 

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:46.380
order to put together all these things
so we will go in counterclockwise around

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:46.390
so we will go in counterclockwise around
 

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:51.170
so we will go in counterclockwise around
all this let's see all these six

00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:51.180
all this let's see all these six
 

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:52.920
all this let's see all these six
landscapes we call

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:52.930
landscapes we call
 

00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:56.519
landscapes we call
there are more but well with ordinary it

00:08:56.519 --> 00:08:56.529
there are more but well with ordinary it
 

00:08:56.529 --> 00:08:59.720
there are more but well with ordinary it
will interesting just to go through this

will interesting just to go through this
 

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:04.370
will interesting just to go through this
six aspects what first one is the

00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:04.380
six aspects what first one is the
 

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:08.160
six aspects what first one is the
personal one we don't like this world to

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:08.170
personal one we don't like this world to
 

00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:11.640

my personal the concerns would have as

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:22.360
my personal the concerns would have as
 

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:26.220
my personal the concerns would have as
human beings even if we're architectures

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:26.230
human beings even if we're architectures
 

00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:30.600
human beings even if we're architectures
or we are not architects so this is to

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:30.610
or we are not architects so this is to
 

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:35.730
or we are not architects so this is to
say the way we lay in this world the way

00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:35.740
say the way we lay in this world the way
 

00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:38.240

with art with culture or whatever and
that's very important because in our

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:45.520
that's very important because in our
 

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:48.930
that's very important because in our
opinion in general terms it will last

that in this bring this plan in this
 

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:34.110
that in this bring this plan in this
photograph there is a fight there is a

00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:34.120
photograph there is a fight there is a
 

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:38.820
photograph there is a fight there is a
fight this case say between the idea of

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:38.830
fight this case say between the idea of
 

00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:45.000
fight this case say between the idea of
putting the world in a kind of a struct

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:45.010
putting the world in a kind of a struct
 

00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:49.620
putting the world in a kind of a struct
order and making possible at the same

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:49.630
order and making possible at the same
 

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:53.370
order and making possible at the same
time the dynamism of the life and when

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:53.380
time the dynamism of the life and when
 

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:56.730
time the dynamism of the life and when
you see these two things happening in a

00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:56.740
you see these two things happening in a
 

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:59.519
you see these two things happening in a
plan you can point it and say well this

00:10:59.519 --> 00:10:59.529
plan you can point it and say well this
 

00:10:59.529 --> 00:11:00.070
plan you can point it and say well this
is

00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:00.080
is
 

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:04.660
is
by Al Grantham so let's say that when

00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:04.670
by Al Grantham so let's say that when
 

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:07.509
by Al Grantham so let's say that when
you start a project there is something a

00:11:07.509 --> 00:11:07.519
you start a project there is something a
 

00:11:07.519 --> 00:11:11.550
you start a project there is something a
kind of a probabilistic which is the way

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:11.560
kind of a probabilistic which is the way
 

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:17.079
kind of a probabilistic which is the way
you think about this world in our case

00:11:17.079 --> 00:11:17.089
you think about this world in our case
 

00:11:17.089 --> 00:11:20.380
you think about this world in our case
in our case we are always focusing in

00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:20.390
in our case we are always focusing in
 

00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:23.670
in our case we are always focusing in
this idea of equality and difference

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:23.680
this idea of equality and difference
 

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:30.180
this idea of equality and difference
which is maybe something that comes from

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:30.190
 
 

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:33.970
 
starting architecture when Franco died

00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:33.980
starting architecture when Franco died
 

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:37.000
starting architecture when Franco died
and it was a dictatorship or whatever so

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:37.010
and it was a dictatorship or whatever so
 

00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:40.329
and it was a dictatorship or whatever so
it's a social it's a political idea but

00:11:40.329 --> 00:11:40.339
it's a social it's a political idea but
 

00:11:40.339 --> 00:11:43.990
it's a social it's a political idea but
it's also an architectonic idea so our

00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:44.000
it's also an architectonic idea so our
 

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.900
it's also an architectonic idea so our
question is would it be possible to make

00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:46.910
question is would it be possible to make
 

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:49.870
question is would it be possible to make
visible somehow when you look up

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:49.880
visible somehow when you look up
 

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:54.600
visible somehow when you look up
architecture this idea of feeling like

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:54.610
architecture this idea of feeling like
 

00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:58.000
architecture this idea of feeling like
belonging to a group recognizing

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:58.010
belonging to a group recognizing
 

00:11:58.010 --> 00:12:02.680
belonging to a group recognizing
ourselves like a part of the group well

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:02.690
ourselves like a part of the group well
 

00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:06.100
ourselves like a part of the group well
we are part of the same group at the

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:06.110
we are part of the same group at the
 

00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:08.710
we are part of the same group at the
same time we can feel absolutely

00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:08.720
same time we can feel absolutely
 

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:10.569
same time we can feel absolutely
different and this idea of equality

00:12:10.569 --> 00:12:10.579
different and this idea of equality
 

00:12:10.579 --> 00:12:13.269
different and this idea of equality
difference it comes through all the

00:12:13.269 --> 00:12:13.279
difference it comes through all the
 

00:12:13.279 --> 00:12:16.560
difference it comes through all the

Museum of Samora of course there were a

00:12:44.829 --> 00:12:44.839
Museum of Samora of course there were a
 

00:12:44.839 --> 00:12:48.910
Museum of Samora of course there were a
lot of different problems but let's go

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:48.920
lot of different problems but let's go
 

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:51.910

thing is their family of skylines that
 

00:12:55.430 --> 00:13:00.480
thing is their family of skylines that
are absolutely identical but according

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:00.490
are absolutely identical but according

space it will make different lights and
different space in the interior

00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:17.190
different space in the interior
 

00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:21.380
different space in the interior
no that's but it's the mission of the

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:21.390
no that's but it's the mission of the

no that's but it's the mission of the
Mora in the roof in the top level but

00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:25.220
Mora in the roof in the top level but
 

00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:27.860
Mora in the roof in the top level but
let's see the Aldi torreón of caste on

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:27.870
let's see the Aldi torreón of caste on
 

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:31.400
let's see the Aldi torreón of caste on
there are a lot of things related with

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:31.410
there are a lot of things related with
 

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:35.330
there are a lot of things related with
with acoustics a lot of products we are

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:35.340
with acoustics a lot of products we are
 

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:37.160
with acoustics a lot of products we are
not going here to speak about this

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:37.170
not going here to speak about this
 

00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:39.650
not going here to speak about this
problem but again it's a family of

00:13:39.650 --> 00:13:39.660
problem but again it's a family of
 

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:42.860
problem but again it's a family of
windows they've recognized themselves as

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:42.870
windows they've recognized themselves as
 

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:45.050
windows they've recognized themselves as
belonging to a group that while there is

00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:45.060
belonging to a group that while there is
 

00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:48.530
belonging to a group that while there is
an Orthodox order you can see seven

00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:48.540
an Orthodox order you can see seven
 

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:53.000
an Orthodox order you can see seven
eight nine ten eleven divided and there

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:53.010
eight nine ten eleven divided and there
 

00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:55.310
eight nine ten eleven divided and there
is a proportion between this but the

00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:55.320
is a proportion between this but the
 

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:59.420
is a proportion between this but the
height and the depth of the windows and

00:13:59.420 --> 00:13:59.430
height and the depth of the windows and
 

00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:02.750
height and the depth of the windows and
in the interior of that there is a hole

00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:02.760
in the interior of that there is a hole
 

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:05.750
in the interior of that there is a hole
an actual window which is related with

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:05.760
an actual window which is related with
 

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:09.470
an actual window which is related with
the interior necessities but we are

00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:09.480
the interior necessities but we are
 

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:13.190
the interior necessities but we are
always focusing this idea of equality

00:14:13.190 --> 00:14:13.200
always focusing this idea of equality
 

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:15.290
always focusing this idea of equality
and difference or in the Museum of

00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:15.300
and difference or in the Museum of
 

00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:19.420
and difference or in the Museum of
Castilian we try to enter with this idea

00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:19.430
Castilian we try to enter with this idea
 

00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:22.490
Castilian we try to enter with this idea
in the interior of the building working

00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:22.500
in the interior of the building working
 

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:25.100
in the interior of the building working
with sections now we start saying we

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:25.110
with sections now we start saying we
 

00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:27.050
with sections now we start saying we
will start thing is a well we'll work

00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:27.060
will start thing is a well we'll work
 

00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:28.970
will start thing is a well we'll work
with with with the roof will work with

00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:28.980
with with with the roof will work with
 

00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:31.450
with with with the roof will work with
the way the facet what about working

00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:31.460
the way the facet what about working
 

00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:35.420
the way the facet what about working
inside inside with this idea so there

00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:35.430
inside inside with this idea so there
 

00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:37.400
inside inside with this idea so there
are like four different levels or

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:37.410
are like four different levels or
 

00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:40.540
are like four different levels or
different plans and then a double high

00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:40.550
different plans and then a double high
 

00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:46.430
different plans and then a double high
space it's supposed like a cascade that

00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:46.440
space it's supposed like a cascade that
 

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:49.670
space it's supposed like a cascade that
make every floor different when you go

00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:49.680
make every floor different when you go
 

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:54.380
make every floor different when you go
through it so in one hand you have the

00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:54.390
through it so in one hand you have the
 

00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:56.780
through it so in one hand you have the
same surface you start the same to

00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:56.790
same surface you start the same to
 

00:14:56.790 --> 00:15:00.440
same surface you start the same to
exaggerate the same screws in every plan

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:00.450
exaggerate the same screws in every plan
 

00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:03.790
exaggerate the same screws in every plan
but when going through it become

00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:03.800
but when going through it become
 

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:09.700
but when going through it become
different so in some how this idea of

00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:09.710
different so in some how this idea of
 

00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:13.850
different so in some how this idea of
equality and difference can be expressed

00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:13.860
equality and difference can be expressed
 

00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:17.180
equality and difference can be expressed
by a family of skylines by a family of

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:17.190
by a family of skylines by a family of
 

00:15:17.190 --> 00:15:22.670
by a family of skylines by a family of
windows by a family of double Heights

00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:22.680
windows by a family of double Heights
 

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:27.620
windows by a family of double Heights
all the projects we have done could be

00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:27.630
all the projects we have done could be
 

00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:31.800
all the projects we have done could be
explained through through this idea so

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:31.810
explained through through this idea so
 

00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:33.570
explained through through this idea so
you have here this this is like a kind

00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:33.580
you have here this this is like a kind
 

00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:36.690
you have here this this is like a kind
of map of what we have done in these 25

00:15:36.690 --> 00:15:36.700
of map of what we have done in these 25
 

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:39.480
of map of what we have done in these 25
years well there is the geometrical ones

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:39.490
years well there is the geometrical ones
 

00:15:39.490 --> 00:15:41.460
years well there is the geometrical ones
at the beginning we were speaking about

00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:41.470
at the beginning we were speaking about
 

00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:44.060
at the beginning we were speaking about
but you can work with this kind of

00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:44.070
but you can work with this kind of
 

00:15:44.070 --> 00:15:46.980
but you can work with this kind of
geometries very simple geometries that

also decide but let's put the skylight

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:04.050
also decide but let's put the skylight
 

00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:07.730
also decide but let's put the skylight
here and we will see and the incredible

00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:07.740
here and we will see and the incredible
 

00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:11.240
here and we will see and the incredible
thing the incredible thing is that when

thing the incredible thing is that when
we make that the pin is crossing this

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:17.130
we make that the pin is crossing this
 

00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:22.310
we make that the pin is crossing this
way as you can see so one skylight will

00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:22.320
way as you can see so one skylight will
 

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:27.320
way as you can see so one skylight will

an important and incredible lesson for
 

00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:44.600
an important and incredible lesson for
us in architecture we were dealing

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:44.610
us in architecture we were dealing
 

00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:48.530
us in architecture we were dealing
during 25 years about equality and

00:20:48.530 --> 00:20:48.540
during 25 years about equality and
 

00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:53.480
during 25 years about equality and
difference and just going ahead just

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:53.490
difference and just going ahead just
 

00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:57.290
difference and just going ahead just
going ahead with a technical problem it

00:20:57.290 --> 00:20:57.300
going ahead with a technical problem it
 

00:20:57.300 --> 00:21:02.990
going ahead with a technical problem it
appears in our opinion the nicest view

00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:03.000
appears in our opinion the nicest view
 

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.320
appears in our opinion the nicest view
of this quality and equality and

00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:06.330
of this quality and equality and
 

00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:09.110
of this quality and equality and
difference because one is later on in

00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:09.120
difference because one is later on in
 

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:11.750

done very quickly so we thought that we

00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:07.840
done very quickly so we thought that we
 

00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:09.989
done very quickly so we thought that we
have to think about a structural system

00:29:09.989 --> 00:29:09.999
have to think about a structural system
 

00:29:09.999 --> 00:29:13.289
have to think about a structural system
and construction system so this idea of

00:29:13.289 --> 00:29:13.299
and construction system so this idea of
 

00:29:13.299 --> 00:29:15.330
and construction system so this idea of
equality and difference it was very

00:29:15.330 --> 00:29:15.340
equality and difference it was very
 

00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:17.279
equality and difference it was very
useful for that because we built that

00:29:17.279 --> 00:29:17.289
useful for that because we built that
 

00:29:17.289 --> 00:29:20.879

a rhombus if it is a square it means
 

00:29:27.940 --> 00:29:31.259
a rhombus if it is a square it means
exactly the same so we decide to go to

00:29:31.259 --> 00:29:31.269
exactly the same so we decide to go to
 

00:29:31.269 --> 00:29:35.940
exactly the same so we decide to go to
this process of restriction of materials

00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:35.950
this process of restriction of materials
 

00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:39.060
this process of restriction of materials
and transformation so we decide well the

00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:39.070
and transformation so we decide well the
 

00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:41.340

know exactly how to do it so we will

00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:39.410
know exactly how to do it so we will
 

00:30:39.410 --> 00:30:43.540
know exactly how to do it so we will
have write this this space which was

00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:43.550
have write this this space which was
 

00:30:43.550 --> 00:30:48.910
have write this this space which was
actually very important so we were

00:30:48.910 --> 00:30:48.920
actually very important so we were
 

00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:52.360
actually very important so we were
displacing to this historical so what is

00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:52.370
displacing to this historical so what is
 

00:30:52.370 --> 00:30:54.520
displacing to this historical so what is
the relationship between the building

00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:54.530
the relationship between the building
 

00:30:54.530 --> 00:30:56.590
the relationship between the building
and the history of the city of the

and the history of the city of the
 

00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:59.980
and the history of the city of the
context we were very concerned from the

00:30:59.980 --> 00:30:59.990
context we were very concerned from the
 

00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:03.340

nineteenth about avoiding formal
 

00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:06.340
nineteenth about avoiding formal
relationships what but the things we

00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:06.350
relationships what but the things we
 

00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:09.640
relationships what but the things we
have around what was very important in

00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:09.650
have around what was very important in
 

00:31:09.650 --> 00:31:12.430
have around what was very important in
Europe and especially important in Spain

00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:12.440
Europe and especially important in Spain
 

00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:14.890
Europe and especially important in Spain
so there was a kind of fight of saying

00:31:14.890 --> 00:31:14.900
so there was a kind of fight of saying
 

00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:17.320
so there was a kind of fight of saying
well don't think about it you have this

00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:17.330
well don't think about it you have this
 

00:31:17.330 --> 00:31:20.050
well don't think about it you have this
kind of window you have to do this kind

00:31:20.050 --> 00:31:20.060
kind of window you have to do this kind
 

00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:22.090
kind of window you have to do this kind
of window just think about which is the

00:31:22.090 --> 00:31:22.100
of window just think about which is the
 

00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:24.190
of window just think about which is the
concept of this window and try to make

00:31:24.190 --> 00:31:24.200
concept of this window and try to make
 

00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:26.380
concept of this window and try to make
this the concept of this window at a

00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:26.390
this the concept of this window at a
 

00:31:26.390 --> 00:31:29.410
this the concept of this window at a
place no that was very interesting so at

00:31:29.410 --> 00:31:29.420
place no that was very interesting so at
 

00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:31.450
place no that was very interesting so at
that point and at this point maybe I

00:31:31.450 --> 00:31:31.460
that point and at this point maybe I
 

00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:37.410
that point and at this point maybe I
have to explain that it's very difficult

00:31:37.410 --> 00:31:37.420
 
 

00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:42.460
 
to explain a process which is not linear

00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:42.470
to explain a process which is not linear
 

00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:47.500
to explain a process which is not linear
in a linear way so I'm sorry about that

00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:47.510
in a linear way so I'm sorry about that
 

00:31:47.510 --> 00:31:50.290
in a linear way so I'm sorry about that
but a PowerPoint is something that after

00:32:43.499 --> 00:32:46.220
square so that's the explanation of this
part of the form so they form the

00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:46.230
part of the form so they form the
 

00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:48.739

00:35:44.690 --> 00:35:44.700
process of digitalization I think maybe
 

00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:47.660

here it can be expressed very well this
idea of transformation so you can

00:35:50.570 --> 00:35:50.580

maybe this digitalization it would be

00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:07.650
maybe this digitalization it would be
 

00:36:07.650 --> 00:36:09.950
maybe this digitalization it would be
impossible to be done 15 years ago

00:36:09.950 --> 00:36:09.960
impossible to be done 15 years ago
 

00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:12.890

wasn't important no so they are divided

01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:26.730
wasn't important no so they are divided
 

01:06:26.730 --> 01:06:32.359
wasn't important no so they are divided
and then in terms of efficiency what

01:06:32.359 --> 01:06:32.369
and then in terms of efficiency what
 

01:06:32.369 --> 01:06:36.589
and then in terms of efficiency what
it's more important we think that in

01:06:36.589 --> 01:06:36.599

traitor shadows we're late behind we
were behind and that means that that it

01:06:53.299 --> 01:06:53.309
were behind and that means that that it
 

01:06:53.309 --> 01:06:57.499

the importance of passive systems I mean

01:07:01.940 --> 01:07:01.950
the importance of passive systems I mean
 

01:07:01.950 --> 01:07:03.769
the importance of passive systems I mean
it's not is not a power country in

01:07:03.769 --> 01:07:03.779
it's not is not a power country in
 

01:07:03.779 --> 01:07:07.640
it's not is not a power country in
technology terms but it's actually a

01:07:07.640 --> 01:07:07.650
technology terms but it's actually a
 

01:07:07.650 --> 01:07:14.509
technology terms but it's actually a
power country using materials

01:07:14.519 --> 01:07:19.309
 
in passive terms so you have the the

01:07:19.309 --> 01:07:19.319
in passive terms so you have the the
 

01:07:19.319 --> 01:07:22.339
in passive terms so you have the the
concrete the the well concrete and then

you know something about it but it was

01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:52.770
you know something about it but it was
 

01:08:52.770 --> 01:08:55.820
you know something about it but it was
like a step forward on this one here

we'll have square of rhombus so we

01:08:58.729 --> 01:08:58.739
we'll have square of rhombus so we
 

01:08:58.739 --> 01:09:01.340
we'll have square of rhombus so we
decide it will be possible it will

01:09:01.340 --> 01:09:01.350

piece so the mission of Cantabria is no

01:09:07.099 --> 01:09:07.109
piece so the mission of Cantabria is no
 

01:09:07.109 --> 01:09:08.809
piece so the mission of Cantabria is no
there are not two different piece but is

01:09:08.809 --> 01:09:08.819
there are not two different piece but is
 

01:09:08.819 --> 01:09:11.090
there are not two different piece but is
the same piece and you can put it like

01:09:11.090 --> 01:09:11.100
the same piece and you can put it like
 

01:09:11.100 --> 01:09:18.470
the same piece and you can put it like
this but when we interchange this

01:09:18.470 --> 01:09:18.480
this but when we interchange this

don't know how to split that well you

01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:27.810
don't know how to split that well you
 

01:09:27.810 --> 01:09:31.340
don't know how to split that well you
make a building and appears a concern

01:09:31.340 --> 01:09:31.350
make a building and appears a concern
 

01:09:31.350 --> 01:09:33.920
make a building and appears a concern
and the concern of the Mossad it was

01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:33.930
and the concern of the Mossad it was
 

01:09:33.930 --> 01:09:37.039
and the concern of the Mossad it was
well okay you can work with that and

01:09:37.039 --> 01:09:37.049
well okay you can work with that and
 

01:09:37.049 --> 01:09:38.990
well okay you can work with that and
there are a lot of advantage that we can

01:09:38.990 --> 01:09:39.000
there are a lot of advantage that we can
 

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.390
there are a lot of advantage that we can
recognize but there is a kind of

01:09:41.390 --> 01:09:41.400
recognize but there is a kind of
 

01:09:41.400 --> 01:09:43.789
recognize but there is a kind of
limitation this is an extruded building

01:09:43.789 --> 01:09:43.799
limitation this is an extruded building
 

01:09:43.799 --> 01:09:47.959
limitation this is an extruded building
oh yeah if I had to make a criticism of

01:09:47.959 --> 01:09:47.969
oh yeah if I had to make a criticism of
 

01:09:47.969 --> 01:09:51.740
oh yeah if I had to make a criticism of
the musak no it's you cannot make

01:09:51.740 --> 01:09:51.750
the musak no it's you cannot make
 

01:09:51.750 --> 01:09:55.220
the musak no it's you cannot make
movements in sectional terms so we said

01:09:55.220 --> 01:09:55.230
movements in sectional terms so we said
 

01:09:55.230 --> 01:09:58.670
movements in sectional terms so we said
well next step we have to assure that we

01:09:58.670 --> 01:09:58.680
well next step we have to assure that we
 

01:09:58.680 --> 01:10:01.040
well next step we have to assure that we
have moving sectional terms and for

01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:01.050
have moving sectional terms and for
 

01:10:01.050 --> 01:10:03.920
have moving sectional terms and for
doing that you have to reduce the

01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:03.930
doing that you have to reduce the
 

01:10:03.930 --> 01:10:05.300
doing that you have to reduce the
complexity of the plan

01:10:05.300 --> 01:10:05.310
complexity of the plan
 

01:10:05.310 --> 01:10:08.270
complexity of the plan
so the idea it was to work with just one

01:10:08.270 --> 01:10:08.280
so the idea it was to work with just one
 

01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:10.490
so the idea it was to work with just one
figure and make him different lettuce

01:10:10.490 --> 01:10:10.500
figure and make him different lettuce
 

01:10:10.500 --> 01:10:12.350
figure and make him different lettuce
the section which is something that

01:10:12.350 --> 01:10:12.360
the section which is something that
 

01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:15.910
the section which is something that
doesn't exist that Moussa but you say no

01:10:15.910 --> 01:10:15.920
doesn't exist that Moussa but you say no
 

01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:18.140
doesn't exist that Moussa but you say no
you cannot say well police in the

01:10:18.140 --> 01:10:18.150
you cannot say well police in the
 

01:10:18.150 --> 01:10:19.850
you cannot say well police in the
section of the museum doesn't exist

01:10:19.850 --> 01:10:19.860
section of the museum doesn't exist
 

01:10:19.860 --> 01:10:23.450
section of the museum doesn't exist
because it just won't work so we will

01:10:23.450 --> 01:10:23.460
because it just won't work so we will
 

01:10:23.460 --> 01:10:28.730
because it just won't work so we will
have to deposit the expression

01:10:28.730 --> 01:10:28.740
have to deposit the expression
 

01:10:28.740 --> 01:10:31.730
have to deposit the expression
of the building into the plan that was

01:10:31.730 --> 01:10:31.740
of the building into the plan that was
 

01:10:31.740 --> 01:10:37.390
of the building into the plan that was
the power this another landscape I know

01:10:37.390 --> 01:10:37.400
the power this another landscape I know
 

01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:42.140
the power this another landscape I know
so the the idea is that if you can have

01:10:42.140 --> 01:10:42.150
so the the idea is that if you can have
 

01:10:42.150 --> 01:10:46.120
so the the idea is that if you can have
the same plan and then build in

01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:46.130
the same plan and then build in
 

01:10:46.130 --> 01:10:48.830
the same plan and then build in
different shapes that actually in her

01:10:48.830 --> 01:10:48.840
different shapes that actually in her
 

01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:53.030
different shapes that actually in her
just three different sayings but they

01:10:53.030 --> 01:10:53.040
just three different sayings but they
 

01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:56.900
just three different sayings but they
mean it's an economic thing I mean that

01:10:56.900 --> 01:10:56.910
mean it's an economic thing I mean that
 

01:10:56.910 --> 01:10:59.600
mean it's an economic thing I mean that
was possible it will reduce but it

01:10:59.600 --> 01:10:59.610
was possible it will reduce but it
 

01:10:59.610 --> 01:11:02.210
was possible it will reduce but it
appears to be all different but they are

01:11:02.210 --> 01:11:02.220
appears to be all different but they are
 

01:11:02.220 --> 01:11:04.820
appears to be all different but they are
known are no different they're like the

01:11:04.820 --> 01:11:04.830
known are no different they're like the
 

01:11:04.830 --> 01:11:07.610
known are no different they're like the
same but that interchange and that that

01:11:07.610 --> 01:11:07.620
same but that interchange and that that
 

01:11:07.620 --> 01:11:11.480
same but that interchange and that that
was there let's say the the problem but

01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:11.490
was there let's say the the problem but
 

01:11:11.490 --> 01:11:15.890
was there let's say the the problem but
when we shall the the building these

01:11:15.890 --> 01:11:15.900
when we shall the the building these
 

01:11:15.900 --> 01:11:18.520
when we shall the the building these
people say these are like the mountains

01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:18.530
people say these are like the mountains
 

01:11:18.530 --> 01:11:21.350
people say these are like the mountains
so we made that problem with the

01:11:21.350 --> 01:11:21.360
so we made that problem with the
 

01:11:21.360 --> 01:11:24.020
so we made that problem with the
mountains but when sometimes you have to

01:11:24.020 --> 01:11:24.030
mountains but when sometimes you have to
 

01:11:24.030 --> 01:11:28.790
mountains but when sometimes you have to
kind no he'd hide to to it is condemned

01:11:28.790 --> 01:11:28.800
kind no he'd hide to to it is condemned
 

01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:34.160
kind no he'd hide to to it is condemned
to hide but it was not it was not it was

01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:34.170
to hide but it was not it was not it was
 

01:11:34.170 --> 01:11:36.440
to hide but it was not it was not it was
more about the quality and different

01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:36.450
more about the quality and different
 

01:11:36.450 --> 01:11:39.250
more about the quality and different
so the idea it was a political idea

01:11:39.250 --> 01:11:39.260
so the idea it was a political idea
 

01:11:39.260 --> 01:11:43.910
so the idea it was a political idea
difference is just possible if there is

01:11:43.910 --> 01:11:43.920
difference is just possible if there is
 

01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:47.840
difference is just possible if there is
a common order the person from that but

01:11:47.840 --> 01:11:47.850
a common order the person from that but
 

01:11:47.850 --> 01:11:52.070
a common order the person from that but
later on it seems month times but but

01:11:52.070 --> 01:11:52.080
later on it seems month times but but
 

01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:55.970
later on it seems month times but but
but for or else it was not important it

01:11:55.970 --> 01:11:55.980
but for or else it was not important it
 

01:11:55.980 --> 01:11:58.670
but for or else it was not important it
was not important at all in the stadium

01:11:58.670 --> 01:11:58.680
was not important at all in the stadium
 

01:11:58.680 --> 01:12:00.380
was not important at all in the stadium
in the stadium it was just the

01:12:00.380 --> 01:12:00.390
in the stadium it was just the
 

01:12:00.390 --> 01:12:03.320
in the stadium it was just the
structural model it what they can so we

01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:03.330
structural model it what they can so we
 

01:12:03.330 --> 01:12:06.200
structural model it what they can so we
decided to make a study that was open

01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:06.210
decided to make a study that was open
 

01:12:06.210 --> 01:12:09.950
decided to make a study that was open
but it was very difficult to solve

01:12:09.950 --> 01:12:09.960
but it was very difficult to solve
 

01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:13.460
but it was very difficult to solve
instructional terms so there was someone

01:12:13.460 --> 01:12:13.470
instructional terms so there was someone
 

01:12:13.470 --> 01:12:15.230
instructional terms so there was someone
that they did they can say well this is

01:12:15.230 --> 01:12:15.240
that they did they can say well this is
 

01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:17.420
that they did they can say well this is
like the time but the photograph appears

01:12:17.420 --> 01:12:17.430
like the time but the photograph appears
 

01:12:17.430 --> 01:12:20.840
like the time but the photograph appears
but this as I was saying before there

lot of different things and that each
 

01:13:38.850 --> 01:13:43.610
lot of different things and that each
one of them are important not more
