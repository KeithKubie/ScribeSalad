00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.730
Let's say I run some
type of a factory,

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.690
and I've studied my operations.

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:07.670
And I'm able to figure
out how my cost varies

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:12.290
as a function of quantity over
a week, on a weekly period.

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.667
And so to visualize
that, let me draw it.

00:00:15.667 --> 00:00:17.000
I could draw this cost function.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.130
So this is my cost axis.

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.340
This right over here
could be my quantity axis.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.670
So that's quantity, or q,
let me just call that q.

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:29.282
That's my q-axis.

00:00:29.282 --> 00:00:31.240
And my function might
look something like this.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.900
It seems reasonable to me.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.980
Even if I produce nothing,
I still have fixed costs.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.620
I have to pay rent
on the factory.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.250
I have to probably pay people
even if we produce nothing.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.340
And so let's say that fixed
costs in the week is $1,000.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.230
And then as my quantity
increases, so do my costs.

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.270
So if I produce 100
units right over here,

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.340
then my cost goes up to $1,300.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.640
If I produce more than that,
you see my costs increase

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.510
and they increase at
an ever faster rate.

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.342
Now, I go into a lot more depth
on things like cost functions

00:01:10.342 --> 00:01:11.800
in the Economics
playlist, but what

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.580
I want to think about in the
calculus context is what would

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.730
the derivative of
this represent?

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:22.670
What would the derivative of c
with respect to q, which could

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.690
also written as c prime of
q, what does that represent?

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.450
Well, if we think
about it visually,

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.770
we know that we can think
about the derivative

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.210
as the slope of
the tangent line.

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.190
So, for example,
that's the tangent line

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:37.970
when q is equal to 100.

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:44.940
So the slope of that tangent
line you could view as c prime,

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.274
or it is c prime of 100.

00:01:48.274 --> 00:01:49.690
But what is that
slope telling us?

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:57.470
Well, the slope is the
change in our cost divided

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.670
by the change in our quantity.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.300
And it's the slope
of the tangent line.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.740
This is what we first
learned in calculus.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.081
As we get to smaller and
smaller and smaller changes

00:02:06.081 --> 00:02:07.830
in quantity, we
essentially take the limit

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.150
as our change in
quantity approaches 0.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:13.350
That's how we get that
instantaneous change.

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.360
So one way to think about it
is this is the instantaneous.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.590
This is the rate
right on the margin

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.550
at which is our cost is changing
with respect to quantity.

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.470
So if I were to produce just
another drop, another atom

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.200
of whatever I'm
producing, at what rate

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.690
is my cost going to increase?

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.760
And the reason why I'm
saying right on the margin

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.690
is we see that
it's not constant.

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.540
If our cost function
were aligned,

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.184
we would have a constant slope.

00:02:40.184 --> 00:02:41.600
The tangent line
would essentially

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.280
be the cost function.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.980
But we see it changes
right over here.

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.280
The incremental
atom to produce here

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.160
costs less than the incremental
atom right over here.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.650
The slope has gone up.

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:55.650
And it might make sense.

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.760
Maybe I'm using some
raw material out there

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:58.600
in the world.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:59.997
And as I use more
and more of it,

00:02:59.997 --> 00:03:01.330
it becomes more and more scarce.

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.120
And so the market price of
it goes up and up and up.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.790
But you might say,
well, why do I even

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:12.400
care about the rate at which
my costs are increasing

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.900
on the margin?

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.430
Which is why this is
called marginal cost.

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.530
Well, the reason why
you care about it is you

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.520
might be trying to figure
out when do I stop producing?

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.250
Let's say this is orange juice.

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.900
If I know that next gallon is
going to cost me $5 to produce

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.597
and I can sell it for $6,
then I'm going to do it.

00:03:34.597 --> 00:03:36.263
But if that next
gallon, if I'm up here,

00:03:36.263 --> 00:03:37.710
and I've already
produced a lot, and I'm

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:39.320
taking all the oranges
off the market,

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:40.890
and now I have to
transport oranges

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.710
from the other side of the
planet or whatever it might be,

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:49.340
and now if that incremental
gallon of oranges or gallon

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.270
of orange juice costs
me $10 to produce,

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.880
and I'm not going to be able
to sell it for more than $6,

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.260
it doesn't make sense for
me to produce it anymore.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.020
So in a calculus context, or
you can say in an economics

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:08.100
context, if you can model your
cost as a function of quantity,

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.470
the derivative of that
is the marginal cost.

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.920
It's the rate at which
costs are increasing

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.410
for that incremental unit.

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.510
And there's other similar ideas.

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.399
If we modeled our profit
as a function of quantity,

00:04:23.399 --> 00:04:25.940
if we took the derivative, that
would be our marginal profit.

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.530
If we modeled revenue, that
would be our marginal revenue.

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.290
How much does a
function increase

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.750
as we increase our
input, as we increase

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.680
our quantity on the margin?
