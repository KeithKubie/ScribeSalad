00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:12.110
Why British Singers Lose Their Accent When
Singing

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:17.770
Mick Jagger, Elton John, Rod Stewart, Ed Sheeran,
Phil Collins and George Michael all grew up

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.770
in or near London and have very recognizably
British accents.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:27.230
Once on stage, they sing like someone who
grew up in New England rather than old.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.570
Yet another example is Adele, who has a lovely
speaking voice, a very heavy cockney accent,

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.710
yet her singing pipes do not indicate her
dialect.

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.739
One might argue that Adele’s speaking and
singing voices were two different people if

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:41.500
listening without visuals.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.239
Going beyond the British, we see the same
thing with other non-American musicians, such

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:51.350
as the Swedish band ABBA, and many others
singing in English, yet from various places

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:52.700
around the world.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.170
It seems like no matter where you’re from,
if you’re singing in English, you’re probably

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.430
singing with an American accent, unless you’re
actively trying to retain your native accent,

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.449
which some groups do.

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:09.310
There are several reasons we notice accents
‘disappearing’ in song, and why those

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.700
singing accents seem to default to “American”.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.060
In a nutshell, it has a lot to do with phonetics,
the pace at which they sing and speak, and

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.939
the air pressure from one’s vocal chords.

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:25.049
As far as why “American” and not some
other accent, it’s simply because the generic

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.450
“American” accent is fairly neutral.

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.390
Even American singers, if they have, for instance,
a strong “New Yorker” or perhaps a “Hillbilly”

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:38.659
accent, will also tend to lose their specific
accent, gravitating more towards neutral English,

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:43.120
unless they are actively trying not to, as
many Country singers might.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:48.090
For the specific details, we’ll turn to
linguist and author, David Crystal, from Northern

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.140
Ireland.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:55.030
According to Crystal, a song’s melody cancels
out the intonations of speech, followed by

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.560
the beat of the music cancelling out the rhythm
of speech.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.249
Once this takes place, singers are forced
to stress syllables as they are accented in

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:07.340
the music, which forces singers to elongate
their vowels.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.070
Singers who speak with an accent, but sing
it without, aren’t trying to throw their

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:16.190
voice to be deceptive or to appeal to a different
market; they are simply singing in a way that

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.519
naturally comes easiest, which happens to
be a more neutral way of speaking, which also

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:26.959
just so happens to be the core of what many
people consider an “American” accent.

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:32.030
To put it in another way, it’s the pace
of the music that affects the pace of the

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.030
singer’s delivery.

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.970
A person’s accent is easily detectable when
they are speaking at normal speed.

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.909
When singing, the pace is often slower.

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:46.590
Words are drawn out and more powerfully pronounced
and the accent becomes more neutral.

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.580
Another factor is that the air pressure we
use to make sounds is much greater when we

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:52.580
sing.

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:57.760
Those who sing have to learn to breathe correctly
to sustain notes for the right amount of time,

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.459
and singing requires the air passages to expand
and become larger.

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:04.700
This changes the quality of the sound.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.799
As a result, regional accents can disappear
because syllables are stretched out and stresses

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:12.660
fall differently than in normal speech.

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.640
So, once again, this all adds up to singing
accents becoming more neutral.

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.150
So at this point, you might be wondering if
the musicians actually know they are losing

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.930
their accents when they sing.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.340
Working in radio, I’ve contemplated how
accents seem to disappear over my 20-year

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:26.340
career.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.269
Keith Urban isn’t British, though fans of
the Aussie singer swoon over his speaking

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:30.489
voice (many women could listen to him read
the dictionary) and have noticed that he sounds

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:31.921
more American when he sings.

00:03:31.921 --> 00:03:32.921
I have spoken to Keith a few times and decided
the good-natured Keith wouldn’t mind me

00:03:32.921 --> 00:03:33.921
posing the question: How is it you sing differently
than you talk?

00:03:33.921 --> 00:03:34.921
(Certainly not wanting to offend Keith, I
began with a few genuine compliments admiring

00:03:34.921 --> 00:03:35.921
his genius guitar skills.)

00:03:35.921 --> 00:03:36.921
He took it all in stride, laughed, then responded,
‘I don’t know.’

00:03:36.921 --> 00:03:37.921
(More like kneh-owww) ‘Good question,’
he said.

00:03:37.921 --> 00:03:38.921
Though I don’t think I have an accent.

00:03:38.921 --> 00:03:39.921
I think you do!’

00:03:39.921 --> 00:03:40.921
It’s quite reasonable to believe that a
Hoosier like me sounds a bit hillbilly to

00:03:40.921 --> 00:03:41.921
a guy from down under.

00:03:41.921 --> 00:03:42.921
Keith could not really explain the mystery
behind it, and instead went on to explain

00:03:42.921 --> 00:03:43.921
why he was wearing black toenail polish the
last time I chatted him up in person.

00:03:43.921 --> 00:03:44.921
(His wife, Nicole, has since been his inspiration
to stop, he says.)

00:03:44.921 --> 00:03:45.921
So it would seem, that at least with this
sample size of one, the artist in question

00:03:45.921 --> 00:03:46.921
is not aware of any accent change when he
sings.

00:03:46.921 --> 00:03:47.921
So what about others?

00:03:47.921 --> 00:03:48.921
Andy Gibson, a New Zealand researcher at AUT’s
University Institute of Culture, Discourse

00:03:48.921 --> 00:03:49.921
&amp; Communication also believes the change in
accent between speaking and singing is not

00:03:49.921 --> 00:03:50.921
a deliberate one, nor are artists even aware
of the change.

00:03:50.921 --> 00:03:51.921
A 2010 study he conducted of singers with
speaking accents showed indeed that they were

00:03:51.921 --> 00:03:56.019
not aware that they sounded any different;
they felt they were singing naturally.

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:01.640
Crystal says it is unusual for a singer to
hold a regional accent through an entire song,

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.550
resulting in what he calls ‘mixed accents’
for most.

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:07.640
And then there’s Kate Nash, the anti-norm.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:12.120
The English-singing sensation was an unknown
until Lily Allen mentioned her on a MySpace

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.310
page and now she boasts more than 100,000
followers on twitter.

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:21.060
She didn’t know she had talent until she
picked up her first guitar two years ago,

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.360
and the rest is history.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.990
Nash has garnered success on the music charts,
accent and all, and flat out refuses to even

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.670
attempt to sing with an American accent.

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:36.090
She makes no apologies for her background
and even themes her lyrics toward an English

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.090
audience.

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.520
She is as English as tea in the afternoon
and proud of bucking the trend that so many

00:04:41.520 --> 00:05:09.040
British artists seem to follow, whether intentionally,
or more likely in most cases, not.
