00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.090
With your head wrapped around routing we'll now take a look at

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:04.190
the nuts and bolts that make

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:06.970
routing possible. Naming, addressing and forwarding.

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:11.080
&gt;&gt; And you'll start your first significant may net project. In the project

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.350
you'll investigate switched buffer sizing which can

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:15.340
have an important effect on network performance.
