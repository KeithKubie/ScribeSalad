vitally important you really do have to

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390
vitally important you really do have to
 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.270
vitally important you really do have to
know the intensity of the hurricane

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280
know the intensity of the hurricane
 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.430

because the evacuation plans are based
 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.170
because the evacuation plans are based
on not just where the hurricane is going

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180
on not just where the hurricane is going
 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.329
on not just where the hurricane is going
to hit but on how strong it is and

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339
to hit but on how strong it is and
 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.460
to hit but on how strong it is and
there's a big big difference between the

there's a big big difference between the

what factors ultimately help in
 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.850
what factors ultimately help in
predicting a hurricane strength is the

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860
predicting a hurricane strength is the
 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.469
predicting a hurricane strength is the
first step

air layer this is the warm dusty air

air layer this is the warm dusty air
 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.039
air layer this is the warm dusty air
that blows off of Africa the dust in the

Saharan air layer can actually act to

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579
Saharan air layer can actually act to
 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.279
Saharan air layer can actually act to
change the microphysics in the clouds

00:01:37.279 --> 00:01:37.289
change the microphysics in the clouds
 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:39.350
change the microphysics in the clouds
and actually reduce the hurricane

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360
and actually reduce the hurricane
 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.580
and actually reduce the hurricane
activity and even the thunderstorm

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590
activity and even the thunderstorm
 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.830
activity and even the thunderstorm
activity it can also warm the Saharan

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840
activity it can also warm the Saharan
 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.149
activity it can also warm the Saharan
air layer and create what we call a

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159
air layer and create what we call a
 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.709
air layer and create what we call a
temperature inversion which makes it

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:45.719
temperature inversion which makes it
 

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:48.139
temperature inversion which makes it
very hard for the thunderstorm tops to

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149
very hard for the thunderstorm tops to
 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.149
very hard for the thunderstorm tops to
bubble up through the atmosphere it also

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159
bubble up through the atmosphere it also
 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.889
bubble up through the atmosphere it also
contains a lot of strong winds that

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899
contains a lot of strong winds that
 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.350
contains a lot of strong winds that
create vertical wind shear and very dry

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360
create vertical wind shear and very dry
 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.210

predicting which hurricanes boom and

predicting which hurricanes boom and
 

00:02:09.079 --> 00:02:14.720
predicting which hurricanes boom and
which ones go bust researchers can now

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730
which ones go bust researchers can now
 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.210
which ones go bust researchers can now
see both the hurricane and the Saharan

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220
see both the hurricane and the Saharan
 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.360
see both the hurricane and the Saharan
air layer at the same time we can track

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370
air layer at the same time we can track
 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.370

the Saharan air layer seeing it here in

orange and yellow and hurricane Aaron
 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.090
orange and yellow and hurricane Aaron
and you can see that the system actually

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100
and you can see that the system actually
 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.220
and you can see that the system actually
becomes enveloped by the Saharan air

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230
becomes enveloped by the Saharan air
 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.509
becomes enveloped by the Saharan air
layer and this could be one of the

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519
layer and this could be one of the
 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:31.430
layer and this could be one of the
reasons why this system struggled early

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440
reasons why this system struggled early
 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.830
reasons why this system struggled early
on but later in the time period you can

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840
on but later in the time period you can
 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.080
on but later in the time period you can
see Aaron pops out of the Saharan air

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090
see Aaron pops out of the Saharan air
 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.150
see Aaron pops out of the Saharan air
layer and rapidly intensifies into a

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160
layer and rapidly intensifies into a
 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.729
layer and rapidly intensifies into a
major hurricane the next step is for

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739
major hurricane the next step is for
 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:42.470
major hurricane the next step is for
researchers to learn more about the

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480
researchers to learn more about the
 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.319
researchers to learn more about the
Saharan air layer with this new

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:45.329
Saharan air layer with this new
 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:46.970
Saharan air layer with this new
satellite technology that we have we can

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980
satellite technology that we have we can
 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.470
satellite technology that we have we can
actually track this hair in air layer

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480
actually track this hair in air layer
 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.479
actually track this hair in air layer
and send our know and airforce hurricane

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489
and send our know and airforce hurricane
 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.220
and send our know and airforce hurricane
hunters out to the Saharan air layer and

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230
hunters out to the Saharan air layer and
 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.650
hunters out to the Saharan air layer and
sample it using GPS drop wind signs and

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660
sample it using GPS drop wind signs and
 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.270
sample it using GPS drop wind signs and
they can help us measure the strong

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280
they can help us measure the strong
 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.430
they can help us measure the strong
winds and very dry air in the air layer

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440
winds and very dry air in the air layer
 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.620
winds and very dry air in the air layer
and that may help us understand how the

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630
and that may help us understand how the
 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.240
and that may help us understand how the
Saharan air layer interacts with

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250
Saharan air layer interacts with
 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.900
Saharan air layer interacts with
hurricanes and ultimately this research

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910
hurricanes and ultimately this research
 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.180
hurricanes and ultimately this research
is all about making our lives a lot

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190
is all about making our lives a lot
 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.519
is all about making our lives a lot
safer
