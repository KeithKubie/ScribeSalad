00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
“President’s Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Iranian nuclear deal…”

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.240
“And imposing touch new sanctions on Iran instead…”

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.780
“The President gives some companies up to six months to wind down involvement with Iran…”

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.100
When the United States violated the Iran nuclear deal it didn’t happen in a vacuum.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.940
It was actually the result of a lobbying campaign backed by some of the richest people in the U.S.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.220
These are people that have really extreme views when it comes to Iran.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:31.740
And there’s ample evidence that they are willing to use their money to further their anti-Iran views.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.000
When President Trump withdrew the U.S. from the historic Iran nuclear deal in May 2018,

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:40.240
he undid years of diplomatic efforts that reset the U.S. - Iran relationship,

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.620
which - prior to that - had been non-existent since Iran’s 1979 Revolution.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
It also unraveled one of the Obama administration’s signature foreign policy achievements

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.460
and went against the U.S.’s European allies.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.820
The collapse of the Iran deal is a catastrophic missed opportunity for diplomacy.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:04.700
I think that this decision is going to be viewed similar to the decision to invade Iraq in 2003.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.820
So exactly how did this happen?

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:11.000
Hi guys, I’m Omar, and this Sunday we’re talking about how major lobbying efforts

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.600
orchestrated by corporate billionaires led to U.S.’s violation of the Iran nuclear deal.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.460
Ok, before we get into the why, where, and how,

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.100
let’s make sure we got the basics down.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.980
In 2015, Iran reached an agreement on its nuclear program with the P5+1

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.280
otherwise known as the U.S., Russia, France, the U.K., China, and Germany.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.000
The agreement severely restricted Iran’s ability to enrich uranium.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.740
It also ensured for the first time that Iran would not seek a nuclear weapon -

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.240
something it had already once pledged to do.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.760
It's a historic agreement involving the US, Iran, and other world powers

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.980
in which sanctions were exchanged for caps on Iran's nuclear program and strict inspections

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.660
to verify that Iran was not moving towards a nuclear weapons capability.

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:09.080
But, behind the scenes there was a furious dash of lobbying involving nearly a 150 million dollars,

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:13.720
and a large group of organizations working nonstop to kill the deal in Congress.

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.620
But who exactly were these groups?

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.180
We spoke to Eli Clifton who’s reported extensively on them and their activities.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:26.080
A unifying message that seemed to be coming out of groups opposing the Iran deal

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.360
was a series of talking points

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.800
talking about Iran's hegemonic ambitions in the region

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.040
and threat to U.S. regional allies like Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Israel.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.220
At the forefront of the fight was AIPAC,

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.540
or the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee.

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:48.060
It aggressively advocated that the deal was a bad idea that would hurt Israel and U.S. interests.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.580
AIPAC spent approximately $30 million on their campaign through a subsidiary group

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.320
known as Citizens for a Nuclear Free Iran.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.460
This included political ads on TV, flying in AIPAC members to DC to lobby members of Congress,

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.720
and organizing demonstrations.

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.880
Check out this ad by the Citizens for a Nuclear Free Iran:

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.600
Iran has violated 20 international agreements

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.680
and is the leading state sponsor of terrorism.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.340
AIPAC, incidentally, didn't originally want to be involved in this policy battle

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.740
but was pushed into it by their backers and funders

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.120
and ended up very much giving voice to Israeli concerns,

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:28.540
possibly at the expense of a discussion about American interests in the region.

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.140
But AIPAC wasn’t alone.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.760
The Republican Jewish Coalition, Foundation for the Defense of Democracies,

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:38.500
United Against Nuclear Iran, and The Israeli American Council all opposed the agreement.

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:44.000
Altogether, opposition groups were five times better-funded than their opponents supporting the deal.

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.140
The groups opposing the nuclear deal

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.380
went into this with an enormous financial advantage.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.140
All of them were preexisting in Washington,

00:03:53.140 --> 00:04:00.680
all of them were well-funded by Republican – in case of AIPAC - Republican and Democrat donors.

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.620
Back in 2015, Jamal Abdi was working with the National Iranian American Council

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.580
to make the Iran deal a reality.

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:12.560
As we were advocating for this, we knew, the other side was pushing back hard and they weren't going anywhere.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:17.000
You know, they lost because the White House was able to pull this off

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.320
and we were able to help put enough pressure on Congress that they didn't kill the deal.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:26.480
If you’re wondering where this windfall of anti-deal money and support for anti-deal groups came from,

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.360
the answer is billionaires.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.120
And Sheldon Adelson’s name tops the list of names funding these groups.

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.440
Adelson has been at the forefront of financially supporting Republican causes

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.720
and pro-Israel initiatives for decades.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:43.920
Sheldon Adelson and his wife Miriam are the Republican party's biggest donors.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:52.640
They were also Donald Trump's single largest backers in his campaign efforts in 2016.

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:53.920
That's something we often forget.

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:58.480
The Las Vegas billionaire even said that an “atomic weapon” should be fired at Iran.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:04.273
So, there’s an atomic weapon and ballistic missile in the middle of the desert

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:09.520
that doesn’t hurt a soul. Maybe a couple of rattlesnakes, scorpions, or whatever.

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.640
And then you say “See, the next one is in the middle of Tehran.”

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.880
Adelson has contributed millions of dollars to groups lobbying against the Iran deal.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.880
This includes half a million dollars to United Against Nuclear Iran,

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.400
one and a half million dollars to the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies,

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.320
and ten million dollars to the Israeli American Council.

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.720
He also happens to be a board member of the Republican Jewish Coalition (RJC)

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.560
and likely its largest financier.

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:40.000
According to Eli Clifton, the RJC's 2012 contributions showed one large donation

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.720
of over five million dollars from an unnamed donor.

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:46.560
Beyond Adelson, there’s also Home Depot co-founder Bernard Marcus

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.560
who’s also donated millions to anti-Iran groups.

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:52.700
Listen to what he says about Iran in this 2015 interview:

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.920
When you do business with the devil, you’re in deep trouble.

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.040
And I think that Iran is the devil.

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:03.180
Marcus gave more than ten million dollars to the hawkish Foundation for Defense of Democracies, or FDD,

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:07.940
between 2008 and 2011 and over three million dollars in 2015.

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:12.220
And AIPAC, which we told you about earlier -- he’s given millions to them as well.

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:14.160
There’s one more donor you should know about.

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:20.300
Paul Singer is a hedge fund billionaire who donated over three and a half million dollars to the FDD in 2011

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.620
and one and a half million to AIPAC between 2010 and 2011.

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:28.980
But despite the best efforts and deep pockets of the anti-Iran deal lobbyists,

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:32.960
they were unable to defeat the Iran deal in Congress in 2015.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
So, in 2016 the coalition and their billionaire backers tried a different approach:

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:39.840
Donald J. Trump.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.980
Never, ever, ever, ever in my life

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:49.280
have I seen any transaction so incompetently negotiated

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.320
as our deal with Iran.

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:56.000
We knew that once a new president came in, once the circumstances change,

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:01.500
there was going to be all this money sort of on the table in place to try to kill the deal.

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:04.280
And if not, kill the deal, at least contain it.

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:09.080
Adelson, Marcus, and Singer spent a lot of money to help elect Donald Trump.

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:13.820
Combined, they donated 40 million dollars to pro-Trump political groups.

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:17.840
They also worked to ensure he’d have a strong congress to back him by spending

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:21.800
65 million dollars backing Republican candidates in the House and Senate.

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:27.060
So, when you have three billionaires who prioritize -

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:32.360
based off of their public, private, as well as their philanthropic efforts and comments

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:34.560
- opposing the nuclear deal

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:39.900
and the United States pursuing a hawkish policy a series of policies in the Middle East,

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:43.000
it's hard to imagine that any Republican candidate -

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:47.000
doesn't listen very carefully to what these individuals have to say.

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.840
Fast-forward to early 2018:

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:53.780
Trump is president and he hasn’t yet reneged on the Iran Deal as he’d pledged during his campaign.

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:55.840
He’s actually renewed it more than once.

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:59.780
But John Bolton -Trump’s National Security Advisor - would change that.

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:03.040
John Bolton had been George W. Bush’s Ambassador to the UN.

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:08.160
He was known as a vocal proponent of the Iraq War, an open advocate of war with Iran,

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.600
and a long-time critic of the Iran nuclear deal.

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:15.360
There’s a lot we can do and we should do it. Our goal should be regime change in Iran.

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:20.000
And according to Politico, Trump’s Chief of Staff, John Kelly, had cut the president’s interactions

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.380
with Bolton prior to him joining the administration because of his fringe views.

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:26.000
Enter Sheldon Adelson.

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:32.060
By multiple accounts Sheldon Adelson is a big fan of John Bolton.

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:34.740
Adelson made sure to get Trump to listen to Bolton.

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:39.900
And with Bolton back in Trump’s ear, his influence on the president was felt almost instantly.

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:43.680
Just four weeks after Bolton assumed the role of National Security Advisor,

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:46.640
the U.S. violated the terms of the Iran deal.

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:52.780
This was a horrible one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made.

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:58.420
It didn’t bring calm, it didn’t bring peace, and it never will.

00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:03.242
So, money was a key factor in the campaign against a diplomatic breakthrough between two countries

00:09:03.242 --> 00:09:06.000
that hadn’t managed to agree on anything for decades.

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:08.420
All these groups with all these vested interests

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:13.080
kept busy and their, you know, moneyed interests and constituencies

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:17.080
stayed active and they ended up winning in the end

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:20.080
But where do Iran and the United States go from here?

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:25.740
Well, Iran is seeking to keep the deal alive between itself and European powers without the United States.

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:31.600
And if that were to fail, can we expect the huge influence of anti-Iran groups in the U.S. to lead us to war?

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:38.980
There's a real opportunity for the United States and Iran to wind up in direct heated conflict with one another.

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:42.840
We're going to need to have a to have more hearings and more public awareness

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:48.800
of the risk of that war and create legal and political barriers to an eventual war

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:51.060
and the means to escalate to that war.

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:53.280
So, what’d you guys think?

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:57.020
Were you guys aware that corporate billionaires had basically demolished the Iran deal?

00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:00.360
