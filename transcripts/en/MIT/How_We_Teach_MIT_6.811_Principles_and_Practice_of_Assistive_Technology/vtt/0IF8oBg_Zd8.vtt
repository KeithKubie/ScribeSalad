WILLIAM LI: So I
think our reason

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:11.300
for really giving a public
face to the class in the course

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.710
itself but also on
Open CourseWare,

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:18.070
I think there's a number of
different dimensions associated

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:19.030
with that.

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:22.600
First I think it's sort
of personal, I think,

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.160
that Professor Teller
started this class

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.300
and we really want to make these
materials available to people

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.170
and really kind of build
on that legacy of the work

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.360
that he's done.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.250
And if the work that we've
contributed this year

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.670
can help the class
continue on and continue

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.840
to grow and flourish, I think
that's a really exciting part.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.200
The second piece I think
is really for the students,

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.517
the opportunity to interact with
people in the wider community,

00:00:54.517 --> 00:00:56.600
to share their work, the
work that they have done.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.601
I think all of our students
are very proud of the work

00:00:59.601 --> 00:01:00.350
that they've done.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:01.724
They really got
into the projects

00:01:01.724 --> 00:01:03.220
and working with their clients.

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.180
And so in having a public
showcase at the end

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.900
and having them communicate
their work online, in video,

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:16.121
or through OCW, I think is part
of the learning experience,

00:01:16.121 --> 00:01:16.620
I think.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.010
And the third piece
is that we really

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.320
think there's a big
opportunity in terms

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.290
of assistive
technology education

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.140
or kind of
project-based education

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.740
that we work with
people with disabilities

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.120
in the Cambridge or Boston area.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.090
But in a lot of ways,
this model could

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.520
be applied to a lot of other
places, a lot of other colleges

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.260
or universities in other towns
or cities in the United States

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:45.540
or around the world.

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.590
There's really a huge need
or a huge opportunity,

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.340
I think, to work in
assistive technology.

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.500
A lot of potential partners
to spread geographically.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.320
And we want to kind of
communicate how we did here.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.490
And maybe share
some materials that

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.160
make it a little bit
easier for somebody

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.160
thinking about doing
this, or maybe just

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.789
to inspire them
to think about how

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:16.810
they might be able to work on a
course or a project like this.

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.850
GRACE TEO: I think one of
the more public aspects

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:21.930
of the class as
well was the fact

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.930
that we asked our
students to write up

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.810
blog posts over the semester.

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.540
So all of them had to write
four different blog posts

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.281
on a public blog for the class.

00:02:33.281 --> 00:02:37.390
And one thing that's
very important to me

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.670
when we teach about
disability is that we're not

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.430
coming in as saviors.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.340
And we're not coming
in to like, oh,

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.980
let's share our wonderful
engineering knowledge with you.

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.050
One of the central
aspects of this class

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.940
is that it user-centered design.

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.930
And we have to recognize
that the clients themselves

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.610
understand their
disability the best.

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.130
And they understand
the type of challenges

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.070
that come with living with
a disability the best.

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.150
So one of the great things about
having those blog posts was

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.850
that the community outside could
also engage with the students

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:12.680
and say, wow, this
is a good idea,

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.560
maybe this is not a
good idea, have you

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.290
considered this other aspect.

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.500
And so we think that
by engaging our users,

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.390
that also just makes the design
process a lot more rigorous.
