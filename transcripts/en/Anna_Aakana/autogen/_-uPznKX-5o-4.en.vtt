00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.260
There's something seriously wrong with the people here.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.740
Like that woman over there.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.340
What does she think she's doing?  I'll tell you what.  A disservice.

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:17.480
She is totally conforming to the image that man and society says that she needs to be.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.660
I'm pretty sure that's like the 3rd saddest thing I've seen all day.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.440
What was the saddest?

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.820
That documentary about how plants feel pain.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.940
And earlier today, I saw that this albino squirrel was trying to like mate with

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.720
regular brown furred squirrels

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.340
but they like wouldn't have him!

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.500
And it's not that I feel sad that he can't mate.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.600
But it's like how sad do you have to be to feel such a need to be part of an uneclectic  group?

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.240
You know?

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.540
I'm going to go ahead and challenge you right there, Jane

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.300
because I don't think "uneclectic" is a word.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.820
It's just "eclectic."

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.860
Uh, okay Oliver.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.800
Do you see what you just did to me, Oliver?

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:53.640
You attacked me.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.060
No Jane.  But, I do want to apologize if you feel attacked.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.920
Thank you, Oliver.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.640
Though you shouldn't because this, this right here that I'm doing

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.580
--it's a learning experience.

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:04.940
Not a battle.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:05.900
(scoffs) Okay

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.840
Well war is so far removed from my school of thought

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.760
that I'm not going to acknowledge that you just said the word "battle" to me.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:13.400
Atticus: Ok guys--

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.280
Oliver: Though you just did.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.240
Hypothetically.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.840
Reality.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:16.820
Rhetorically.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.180
Still just reality.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.700
"Uneclectic" is a word because it makes sense to me.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.640
Maybe when I self-publish my millennial new free-form dictionary you'll get that.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.980
Guys, if I could finish what I was saying.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.920
Oh I'm sorry Atticus, were you trying to say something?

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.500
I was.  Though Jane did have an excellent point about the woman in the suit.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.800
That's really gross.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.640
But I was actually talking about the people around Princeton in general.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.600
Like I was at this party last night, off Prospect Street,

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.160
just trying to have an intellectual discourse and these

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.560
Princetonian elitists come up to me and try to imply that I wasn't on their level.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.460
Wow.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:50.080
Yeah.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.520
So, you know what I said?

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.000
"Listen Sweetie, if you think that intelligence is something that can be measured in levels

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.140
then maybe you just need to reevaluate your entire life."

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.480
Wow, you actually said that?

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.040
I did.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.100
What did they say?

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.880
Well I mean they didn't get it but

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.020
at the risk of sounding hubristic, I don't think anybody at that entire party had the mental bandwidth

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.120
to even handle that kind of ideology.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.420
I can definitely relate to that.

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.360
I feel like that at every party I've ever attended, actually.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.580
Yeah, and even in class people aren't ready for new ideas.

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.900
It's sad, really, but what are you going to do?
