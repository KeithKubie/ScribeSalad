PAUL RASHIDI: Hello.

00:00:00.983 --> 00:00:03.630
I'm Paul Rashidi with the
Google Cloud Platform team.

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:06.030
Now that Compute Engine is
open for everyone to use,

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.330
I thought it'd be fun to
do a demo of using Compute

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:10.974
Engine to set up a
cloud-based web server.

00:00:10.974 --> 00:00:13.140
That way you can see the
process and then try it out

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:14.850
for yourself.

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:16.590
Let's get started by
pointing a browser

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.562
to cloud.google.com/console.

00:00:19.562 --> 00:00:21.270
When you first come
to the cloud console,

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.480
you'll be prompted to
create a new project.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.080
We're creating a
test web server,

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.080
so we'll call it
Web Server Project.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.240
We'll change the suggested
project ID as well.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.269
And then click Create.

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:36.810
That will start the
creation process.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.160
Now that the project's
been created,

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.410
we'll have access to all
of Google Cloud Platform's

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:45.750
services.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.282
Compute Engine is
a paid service.

00:00:47.282 --> 00:00:48.740
So the first thing
we'll need to do

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.450
is set up our
billing information.

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.030
You'll likely be
surprised at how

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.257
affordable experimenting
with Compute Engine can be.

00:00:55.257 --> 00:00:57.090
I'll go ahead and fill
in my billing details

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.957
and be right back.

00:00:58.957 --> 00:01:00.790
After we've entered our
billing information,

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.998
we'll navigate to the Google
Compute Engine Instances

00:01:02.998 --> 00:01:05.459
page, where we'll see a
list of virtual machines

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:06.730
that we've created.

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.609
We don't currently have
any, so let's add one.

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:11.650
We're going to create an
instance called Test Web

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:12.720
Server.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.627
Start by clicking the
New Instance button

00:01:14.627 --> 00:01:15.585
at the top of the page.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.930
We'll specify the name
as Test Web Server.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.990
For the zone, we'll
select US Central 1B.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.080
For machine type,
since this is a test,

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.810
we'll select the smallest
one available, the F1 micro

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.930
with one virtual CPU and just
over a half a gig of RAM.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.555
And we'll go with the suggested
default image, which is Debian.

00:01:42.692 --> 00:01:43.900
Our instance is almost ready.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.316
Some final health
checks are being

00:01:45.316 --> 00:01:47.630
run, which is the last
step before the server is

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:48.510
ready to use.

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.710
There, now our instance
has been created.

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.620
So by default,
Google Compute Engine

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:00.200
blocks all connections to an
instance from the internet.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.490
Since we want to serve web
pages from our instance,

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.460
we'll need to set up
a firewall to specify

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.700
that incoming HTTP traffic is
allowed on the network where

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.930
our newly created
virtual machine resides.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:12.740
We'll do that by
clicking Networks.

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.290
Select a default
network, which is

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.450
where we created
our virtual machine.

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.026
Click the new link that appears
at the top of the firewall

00:02:19.026 --> 00:02:19.525
section.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.330
Name the firewall http1.

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.210
In the Protocol and Ports
field, enter TCP 80.

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.050
Click the Create
button to complete

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.520
the creation of the firewall.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.010
Once this process
completes, we should

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.220
see the new firewall appear
in the firewalls list.

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.984
And there it is.

00:02:38.984 --> 00:02:40.900
Now that the network
where the virtual machine

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.230
instance resides has
a firewall configured

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.040
to allow internet access,
let's install a web server

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.380
on our virtual machine.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.515
In order to make changes
like installing software

00:02:50.515 --> 00:02:52.790
on our Compute Engine
virtual machine,

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.480
we need to remotely
access the machine.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.500
The Google Compute Engine
team has created a great tool

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.560
for doing this
called gcutil, which

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.950
is included in the
Google Cloud SDK.

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.310
The instructions for downloading
and installing Google Cloud SDK

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.250
can be found at
developer.google.com/cloud/SDK.

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.200
You'll essentially
download it as a file,

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.700
extract it, and run
an install script.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.210
Then run an
authentication script

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:18.810
and grant the tool access.

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.060
I'll go ahead and finish
speeding through this process

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.559
now.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.330
The authentication
command here is

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.900
what grants the SDK access
to work with your project.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.990
An OAuth2 token is
being issued and stored.

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.440
We're now set up to use gcutil.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.590
Once gcutil is installed
on our machine,

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.389
we can use it to remotely
access the instance we created.

00:03:58.389 --> 00:03:59.930
There's a quick way
to do this if you

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.820
go to the Instance Details page.

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.730
On the side,
there's an SSH link.

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.280
Copy the SSH command
that's provided there.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.980
Open a Terminal Window and
paste the SSH command into it.

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:18.800
You're prompted
for a pass phrase.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.049
Enter something you can
remember for SSH keys.

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.730
Here we are in the command
line of our virtual machine

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:30.280
instance.

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.000
Let's install some software,
specifically some web server

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.090
software.

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.690
The web server software we're
going to install is Apache.

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.870
A standard command used on Linux
to install software is apt-get.

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:41.910
We'll use that.

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.370
So we're going to type
sudo to run the command

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:49.892
as a super user,
apt-get install apache2.

00:04:49.892 --> 00:04:52.350
It's going to ask us to confirm
that we want to install it.

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.020
Hit y and type Enter.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.230
The installation
process has started.

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:09.060
And now Apache has
been installed.

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:10.560
As part of the
installation process,

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.550
Apache creates a
default web page.

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.750
We can try unloading that
default web page in a web

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.810
browser to confirm that we're
actually serving web pages.

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:19.605
So let's jump back
to a browser to test

00:05:19.605 --> 00:05:22.830
is we can load the default web
page that Apache has created.

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.980
Now, to find our
default page, we

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:26.980
need to know the internet
address of our server.

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:28.570
We'll get that on
the VM Instances

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:30.890
page of the Cloud Console.

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:33.640
We can see our external
IP address here.

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:36.980
Open a new tab and
type the IP address.

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:39.530
And here we have the
default Apache web page.

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:42.330
Great, our test web server
is serving up pages.

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.110
Now to prove that this
is our web server,

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.710
let's modify the
default web page.

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:50.100
We'll start typing sudo to run
the command as a super user,

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:53.400
then nano, which is a
text editor we'll use,

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.074
and then the location of
the Apache default web page,

00:05:56.074 --> 00:05:57.240
which is var/www/index.html.

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:02.820
When we run that, it
opens up the index.

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.130
file and the nano text editor.

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:07.090
We'll remove the default
text that's there.

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:08.730
And then we'll
paste in an image,

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:11.766
so that we can easily tell
the page has been modified.

00:06:11.766 --> 00:06:13.890
We'll save the page in nano
by pressing the Command

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:16.040
key and the X key
at the same time.

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:20.040
And then type y to save
the file and close nano.

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:22.730
Back in the browser, we should
be able to Refresh the page.

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:25.830
And there's our new
custom default web page.

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:27.770
Now, I would call
this test a success.

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:30.100
The final thing we need
to do to wrap up our test

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:33.910
is to delete the virtual machine
and persistent disk we created.

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:35.910
As I do that, let's
make a calculation

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:38.050
about how much this
whole test cost.

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:40.320
So to delete the virtual
machine and persistent disk,

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.840
first we'll select our
test web server VM.

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.790
Then scroll down and click the
Delete Disk Instance button.

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:49.040
We'll check the option for
deleting the boot disk as well.

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.560
And then click OK.

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.262
Our deletion
process has started.

00:06:53.262 --> 00:06:55.470
The current virtual machine
price for the type we use

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:57.620
is 1.9 cents per hour.

00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:59.840
We ran our server for
around 10 minutes.

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.440
So our virtual
machine usage cost

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.340
comes in at just under
a third of a cent.

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:07.700
And there we go.

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:10.060
The virtual machine
has just been deleted.

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:11.440
Now, back to pricing.

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.620
The persistent disk pricing is
$0.04 per gigabyte per month.

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:17.180
So that roughly comes to
just under half a cent

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:20.290
for a 500 gigabyte
boot disk, the default.

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:22.260
So everything we just
did on Compute Engine,

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.537
we did for less than $0.01.

00:07:24.537 --> 00:07:25.370
Thanks for watching.

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:26.380
Now, it's your turn.

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:28.580
Go try creating your own
cloud-based web server

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:30.780
on Compute Engine.
