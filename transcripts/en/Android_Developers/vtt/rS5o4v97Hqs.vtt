&gt;&gt; LEE: Hi, my name is Bob Lee. I'm the core
library lead for Android, and I'm here to

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.849
show off a couple of my favorite Android features.
I spend most of my time in the web browser.

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.570
I can keep up with my friends on Twitter,
or can switch windows using Android’s window

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:20.400
feature, and keep up with the latest news
on Google Reader. Here we go. We’re following

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.359
politics because we have the upcoming election.
I can scroll through and look at the items

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:29.890
until I find the item I'm interested in. Here’s
one by Esther Dyson, for example. I can click

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.880
on the item, and it automatically expands,
use an Ajax. I can scroll through the item

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.500
and I read it here, and with the size of the
screen and what not, it’s very easy to read

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:46.440
full stories. I can scroll down and I can—if
I want to look at the original webpage, all

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.050
I have to do is click the “See Original
Length,” and Android’s browser opens up

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.750
that webpage in a different window. When I'm
not coding on Android, I'm an aspiring photographer,

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.510
so I love the fact that you can copy—I can
copy my photos onto the ST card and pull them

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.110
up in the picture app, so… And then show
them off to my friends. Here’s a picture

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.720
of my favorite subject. And I just click the
error buttons, and I can navigate through

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:14.320
the pictures. Or I can click “Menu”, and
then tap “Slide Show.” It will go through

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.970
them automatically.
