Speaker 1:          00:06          [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          00:07          The most common pattern that I've seen after interviewing hundreds, 300400500 world class performers at this point is that at least 80% have some type of mindfulness or meditation practice and if you are like me, perhaps you've heard of this many times and perhaps you even tried many times and decided you do not meditate, you cannot meditate, you are not designed to meditate, which is what I concluded for a very, very long time until I tested a number of simple options that may work for you and I would anticipate that really one or two will stick and have some type of toehold and you'll be able to then develop the habit over a week or two of doing this and I would recommend trying it first thing in the morning. Here are a few different options. Number one is using an app of some type and there are several that are well designed.

Speaker 2:          00:58          Headspace would be one the 10 in 10 that's 10 minutes per day for 10 days straight is very effective. Calm is another insight timer is yet another. There are many on top of that. If you want to go straight to guided meditations, you could consider looking for Sam Harris. Uh, you could consider looking for Tara Brock, Vrac, ACH. There are many different options and they range in length so you can choose something that works for you. Next option is something like transcendental meditation where you actually take a course and you have that social accountability and you pay for it and then you will work with someone for four days straight. You will meditate in between those sessions and you will need to report back to them and it is 20 minutes per day, twice per day. Encourage most people, at least I do it once per day, normally in the morning.

Speaker 2:          01:47          That is mantra based meditation. Another option is picking one song that is very uplifting to you. Like we're going to party like it's 1999 by prince, which is the one I actually use in the early days. And you simply listen to that song first thing in the morning and focus on your breath and you want to sit in a comfortable position. So I would sit cross legged with my back against the wall. You could certainly sit in a chair, you could sit with your feet on the ground, hands on your thighs, it doesn't matter. You want it to be comfortable. Listen to that song, focus on your breath and when you focus on your breath, this is very common advice. What does that mean? All right, we should get specific. So a few recommendations. You could focus certainly on feeling it in your lower abdomen. You can focus on feeling in your chest.

Speaker 2:          02:31          What a lot of people find helpful is actually focusing on feeling the breath, the inhale and XL right on the edges of their nostrils. And you might even notice that on the inhale it's cooler and on the exhale it's warmer, right? Those are two tips that I find very, very helpful. And the last recommendation I would make is actually twofold. So there two super short options throughout the day. If you find yourself feeling stressed out or anxious or if about to say something you might regret, take a three breath break. This is actually something I started doing a, I had heard 10 breaths that seemed excessive to me, which I know is funny, but I would pause to just focus on taking three deep breaths. That is a form of meditation and mindfulness present state awareness training. The other is something called loving kindness meditation or Meta TTA meditation and this is very simple.

Speaker 2:          03:23          Instead of focusing on yourself that you're going to focus on other people. This was a breakthrough for me and actually made a big difference in my entire experience in practice meditation and really all you're going to do is sit down, eyes closed comfortably and focus on envisioning someone you care for. That's where you start a friend, family member, whoever it might be and wishing them joy and happiness. You can do that any way you want. All right? You're wishing them joy and happiness and a life free of pain and suffering and you do that for one or two minutes for one person and then you do it for one or two minutes for the next. And I've seen multiple friends try this and they do it for five minutes, either first thing in the morning or right before going to bed, and at the end of the week they tell me that is the best week I've had in years. All right, so that's another option that you can test out. So those are whatever it is, six, seven, eight different options. Try them all. You could try one a day for a week. Find one that sticks. And the imperfect program, the good program that you follow is better than the perfect program you don't follow. So pick something simple, get started, and you can always add to it later.
