I guess not all pixels cost the same to paint on the page. I

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:04.990
should really pay attention to what affects

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:06.970
I'm applying and everything else I'm doing.

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:10.680
&gt;&gt; Yep, exactly. Although remember the cardinal rule of web performance?

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.000
&gt;&gt; Let me think measure first then optimize.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.269
&gt;&gt; Exactly, let's take a look.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.650
Okay, we're looking at a trace of the New York Times

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.480
homepage. We want to look at Paint events, so let's filter out

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.640
the rest. As you can see, there are many Paint events,

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.270
but let me show you a handy trick. We can select a

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.830
time range that we want to show on the timeline by

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.250
dragging the sliders at the top here. Notice that as we do

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.000
this, the pie chart on the bottom is updated with the total

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.900
times. Yep, and also while we're here let's identify some expensive things.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.600
For example, this one took eight milliseconds.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.440
&gt;&gt; Hmm. So, let me see. We said that anytime we want to update the render tree,

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.080
there's a good chance we'll have to run layout,

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.740
and I'm guessing the same applies for painting, right?

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.410
&gt;&gt; That's right. The browser applies a lot

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.800
of smarts and tried to repaint the minimum required

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.360
area. But really it all depends on what kind

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.200
of updates are being applied to the render tree.
