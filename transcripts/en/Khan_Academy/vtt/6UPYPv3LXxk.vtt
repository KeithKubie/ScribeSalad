00:00:00.377 --> 00:00:03.052
- [Lecturer] We're told that
a ball attached to a string

00:00:03.052 --> 00:00:06.676
swings in a horizontal
circle at constant speed

00:00:06.676 --> 00:00:08.114
as shown below.

00:00:08.114 --> 00:00:12.728
The string makes an angle
theta with the horizontal.

00:00:12.728 --> 00:00:16.478
Which arrows show all
the forces on the ball?

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:22.832
So pause this video, and see
if you can figure that out.

00:00:22.832 --> 00:00:25.829
Okay, so let's work through this together.

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:28.173
So this ball is attached to the string,

00:00:28.173 --> 00:00:29.409
and it's currently hanging down,

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:31.279
and I think it's fair to say

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:33.841
that we are on some type of a planet.

00:00:33.841 --> 00:00:36.474
And so, if we're on some type of planet,

00:00:36.474 --> 00:00:38.765
you're definitely gonna
have the force of gravity

00:00:38.765 --> 00:00:42.434
acting on the ball, so
let me draw that vector.

00:00:42.434 --> 00:00:45.353
So the force of gravity,
I'll do in orange.

00:00:45.353 --> 00:00:47.910
Let's say it looks something like that.

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.485
Its magnitude, I'll denote as capital F

00:00:51.485 --> 00:00:54.247
with a sub g right over here.

00:00:54.247 --> 00:00:58.414
Now what's keeping that ball
from accelerating downwards?

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.554
And also, what's keeping that ball

00:01:01.554 --> 00:01:04.393
in this uniform circular motion?

00:01:04.393 --> 00:01:06.659
And the answer to both of those questions

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.501
is the tension in the rope.

00:01:09.501 --> 00:01:11.399
Remember, tension is a pulling force.

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:13.459
The rope is pulling on this ball.

00:01:13.459 --> 00:01:15.959
And so, we could say the force

00:01:16.967 --> 00:01:21.134
of the tension, so it might
look something like this,

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:24.986
the force, force of the tension.

00:01:27.385 --> 00:01:31.418
Now just with that, we have
constructed a free body diagram,

00:01:31.418 --> 00:01:33.688
and we can immediately
answer their question,

00:01:33.688 --> 00:01:35.821
what are the forces that
are acting on the ball,

00:01:35.821 --> 00:01:37.058
which arrows show it.

00:01:37.058 --> 00:01:38.217
So there is one downwards,

00:01:38.217 --> 00:01:41.102
and then there is one going in
the direction of the string,

00:01:41.102 --> 00:01:42.834
and if you look at these choices here,

00:01:42.834 --> 00:01:45.394
you would say it is that
one right over there.

00:01:45.394 --> 00:01:47.827
Now some of you might say,
"Wait, hold on a second.

00:01:47.827 --> 00:01:51.297
"Isn't there some type
of a centripetal force

00:01:51.297 --> 00:01:53.607
"that keeps the ball going in a circle,

00:01:53.607 --> 00:01:56.324
"that keeps it from
just going straight off?

00:01:56.324 --> 00:01:58.006
"And then isn't there some type of force

00:01:58.006 --> 00:02:01.094
"that counteracts the
actual force of gravity?"

00:02:01.094 --> 00:02:03.152
And the answer to the
question is yes, there is

00:02:03.152 --> 00:02:07.364
but those are really just
components of the tension.

00:02:07.364 --> 00:02:10.550
And so, if you look at the
X component of the tension,

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.968
I'll do that in a blue
color right over here,

00:02:13.968 --> 00:02:16.354
this X component of the tension,

00:02:16.354 --> 00:02:20.521
so I'll call that F sub Tx,
that is our centripetal force,

00:02:22.484 --> 00:02:24.985
or that its magnitude of
the X component of tension

00:02:24.985 --> 00:02:29.152
is the same thing as the magnitude
of our centripetal force.

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:34.833
If we look at the Y
component of our tension,

00:02:34.833 --> 00:02:36.688
the Y component of our tension,

00:02:36.688 --> 00:02:40.198
that's what counteracts
the force of gravity.

00:02:40.198 --> 00:02:44.940
So this right over here,
its magnitude is F sub Ty,

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.306
and F sub Ty, this magnitude
is going to be the same thing

00:02:48.306 --> 00:02:51.075
as the magnitude of the force of gravity.

00:02:51.075 --> 00:02:52.848
But we already answered our question,

00:02:52.848 --> 00:02:54.128
and we just got a little
bit more intuition

00:02:54.128 --> 00:02:57.045
of what's going on right over here.
