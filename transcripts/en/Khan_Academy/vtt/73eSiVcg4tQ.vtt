00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:04.550
Part b-- find the slope
of the tangent line

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:09.180
to the path of the particle
at time t is equal to 3.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.350
So the slope of the
tangent line is just

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.690
going to be equal to
the rate of change of y

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.330
with respect to x at that point.

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:26.349
And this is the same
thing as dy/dt over dx/dt.

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:28.640
And dealing with differentials
is a little bit strange,

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.810
especially when you want
to deal with rigorously,

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.820
but you can view them as very
little, small changes in y,

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.560
small changes in,
t small changes in

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.050
x, small changes in t.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.290
When you view it this way,
you could say, hey, look.

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.460
If I just multiply both
sides, both the numerator

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.190
and the denominator,
by dt over dt-- which,

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.950
if you do view them as
the same small change--

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.620
then they would
cancel out, and you

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.467
would get back to
the dy over dx.

00:00:52.467 --> 00:00:54.050
And the reason why
I wrote it this way

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.980
is that they actually
give us these values.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.650
They give us dy/dt and
they give us dx/dt.

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:11.040
So if you want to find the
slope at time equals 3,

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.230
we just have to find dy/dt at
time equals 3 and dx/dt at time

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:17.710
equals 3.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.320
So dy/dt at time
equals 3-- well,

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.480
this is dy/dt right over here.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.650
It's just going to be sine
of 3 squared, or sine of 9.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.423
And dx/dt at time 3, that's
just going to be-- they

00:01:33.423 --> 00:01:35.560
tell us what dx/dt is
as a function of time.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.270
4 times 3 plus 1.

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.429
Well, that is equal to 13.

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:42.220
And then we can just
get our calculator out

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.030
and evaluate this.

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.020
We did a lot of this work
in the first problem.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.644
But let's just actually
take the value.

00:01:47.644 --> 00:02:01.035
So we have sine of 9 divided
by 13 gets as 0.0317.

00:02:01.035 --> 00:02:01.660
And we're done.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.480
That's the slope
of the tangent line

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.020
to the path of the particle
at time t is equal to 3.

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:11.020
I think we have time.

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.930
We could crank out
part c as well.

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.170
Part c-- find the position
of the particle at time t

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.040
is equal to 3.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:25.990
So they give us x prime of t,
and they give us y prime of t.

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:27.180
This is x prime of t.

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.800
This is y prime of t.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.320
We need to figure out
x of x of 3 and y of 3.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:40.730
So if we can, let's
write x of t and y of t

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.000
and then try to
evaluate them at 3.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.050
So let's see. x of
t is going to be

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.420
equal to the antiderivative
of this right over here.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:56.529
So the antiderivative of 4t
is going to be 2t squared.

00:02:56.529 --> 00:02:57.570
Take the derivative here.

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:58.790
You'll just get 4t.

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.620
Antiderivative of
1 is t, plus t,

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.620
and then you're going to
have a plus a constant.

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.870
Or essentially, we just
took the indefinite integral

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.450
of this side, of 4t plus 1.

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:10.700
So you get your constant here.

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:11.680
Because if you take
the derivative,

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.304
this constant will
obviously disappear.

00:03:13.304 --> 00:03:14.810
You'll lose that information.

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.430
Lucky for us, they also gave
us this initial condition.

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:26.130
x of 0 is 0, when t is 0,
this term is going to be 0.

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.244
This term is going to be 0.

00:03:28.244 --> 00:03:29.660
And they're saying
the whole thing

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:30.743
is going to be equal to 0.

00:03:30.743 --> 00:03:32.930
So c is going to be 0, as well.

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.920
Let me do that explicitly
just so we don't get confused.

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:41.190
So x of 0 is going to be equal
to 0 plus 0 plus c, which

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.510
they're telling
us is equal to 0.

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.150
So c is equal to 0.

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.870
So that tells us
that x of t is going

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.660
to be equal to 2t
squared plus t.

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.860
So if you want to
find x of 3, you just

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.050
evaluate it right over here.

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.470
So if you want to
find x of 3, it's

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.510
going to be 2 times 9 plus 3.

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.700
2 times 9 is 18, plus 3 is 21.

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.750
So x of 3 is 21.

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.320
Now let's try to do y of t.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.320
I'll do it in a different color.

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.060
So let me scroll over to
the right a little bit.

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.829
So let's say y of t is
equal to-- so if you

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:23.745
try to take the
antiderivative of this,

00:04:23.745 --> 00:04:26.370
this is not simple to
take the antiderivative

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:27.674
of this right over here.

00:04:27.674 --> 00:04:29.590
It's actually very hard
to do it analytically.

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:31.750
Not even clear if you
can do it analytically.

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.180
Lucky for us, this
part of the AP exam,

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.070
we are allowed to
use calculators.

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:37.839
So we could just say
this is equal to--

00:04:37.839 --> 00:04:39.880
and this is straight from
the fundamental theorem

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.520
of calculus-- y of t is equal
to the integral from 0 to t.

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:50.000
And I'll just write it
as sine of x squared dx.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.100
I didn't want to use a t here
and then use a t, as well.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:54.337
That would make it confusing.

00:04:54.337 --> 00:04:56.170
So you integrate with
respect to x, and then

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:58.350
one of the upper bound
is going to be t.

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:59.454
And this is y of t.

00:04:59.454 --> 00:05:01.870
And of course, you're going
to have to put a constant over

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.339
here, because if you took
the derivative of this,

00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:06.380
you would get y of t, and
you'll lose information

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:07.226
from this constant.

00:05:07.226 --> 00:05:09.100
Now, we can figure out
what that constant is,

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.670
because they tell
us what y of 0 is.

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:15.600
So y of 0 is going to be equal
to the integral from 0 to 0.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.630
So this part right over
here is going to be 0.

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:20.656
So it's going to be equal to
c, which they tell us y of 0

00:05:20.656 --> 00:05:22.820
is also equal to negative 4.

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:27.730
So we get y of t is equal
to the integral from 0

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:33.130
to t of sine of x
squared dx minus 4.

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:35.330
So that's y as a function of t.

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:39.050
And we already figured
out what x of 3 is.

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:41.470
Now we have to figure
out what y of 3 is.

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:45.000
y of 3 is going to be
equal to the integral

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:51.610
from 0 to 3 of sine of x
squared dx and then minus 4.

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:55.040
And, once again, lucky for us,
we can use calculators here.

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:58.660
So let's get the
calculator out, and we

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:02.075
want to go to the
catalog of functions.

00:06:02.075 --> 00:06:04.430
So I press 2nd
Custom here, which

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.145
gives us this little
catalog thing.

00:06:06.145 --> 00:06:07.770
And I want to do the
definite integral.

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:09.930
And it's actually FN INT.

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:10.960
So let me go to the F's.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:15.420
FN INT.

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:18.400
So I have to go a
little bit further down.

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:18.999
A little bit.

00:06:18.999 --> 00:06:19.540
There you go.

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:21.690
That's my function
that I want to use.

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:23.820
This is a definite
integral, and then I

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:25.490
want to evaluate the
definite integral

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:26.780
of this right over here.

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:32.484
So the function is going
to be sine of x squared--

00:06:32.484 --> 00:06:34.650
that's what I want to
evaluate the definite integral

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:39.635
of-- from 0 to 3.

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:44.500
And my variable--
I need to see what

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.690
the variable of
integration is first--

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:48.350
so my variable of
integration is x,

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:51.880
and I'm going to go from 0 to 3.

00:06:51.880 --> 00:07:00.210
And this gives me-- let the
calculator think a little bit--

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:04.530
0.77356, and then to
that-- so that's just

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:05.900
this first part right over here.

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:07.760
And then I need to subtract 4.

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:15.020
So minus 4 gives negative
3.226, I'll go with.

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:18.384
So this is equal
to negative 3.226.

00:07:18.384 --> 00:07:19.550
Did I write that down right?

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:20.480
I have a bad memory.

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:23.580
Negative 3.226, and we're done.

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:26.850
So y of 3 is equal
to negative 3.226.

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:29.290
So the position of
the particle at time t

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:32.740
equals 3, if you
wanted a coordinate,

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:36.490
it would be 21, negative 3.226.
