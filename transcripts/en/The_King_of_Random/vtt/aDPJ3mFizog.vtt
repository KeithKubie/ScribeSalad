Can proto puddy protect an iPhone 7 from a 100-foot drop?

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.360
Let's check it out guys, I'm here with Brandon from Gizmo Slip.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.640
I do all kinds of videos: creative

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.020
durability tests on the latest tech

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.400
products, from dropping stuff off

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.070
of buildings inside of homemade cases to

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.410
weapon testing, all that good stuff. Since

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.060
I made my proto puddy video a lot of you

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:30.619
reached out asking if you can turn a

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:32.780
proto putty into a cell phone case, so we

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:33.770
thought this might be a good opportunity

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.150
to see if we could make a cell phone

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.440
case that was durable enough to survive a 100-foot drop.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:39.160
Yes...

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.020
Ooh, shiny.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:40.640
I know.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.480
Brand new iphone 7 never been used. No fingerprints on

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:45.200
it yet but the way the glass looks it's

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.790
just so awesome! I'm gonna marr that up with

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.740
finger prints inside all right now I'm

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:49.730
not going to show you how to make proto

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.260
putty in this tutorial you can go back

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.790
and see how to make it step by step in

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:53.870
another video we're going to throw this

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.310
together really quick for you there

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:56.720
won't be a lot of time to talk because

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:57.950
we're going out of 5 to 10 minutes or

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:58.940
time we're going to throw this together

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.380
and then show you the finished result

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.470
I think what we're going to do is take

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.090
these two different colors and rip off

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.470
chunks of them and then meld them

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.060
together so we can get kind of a

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.160
multicolored effect and then just take

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.050
our iPhone 7 and push it right

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.390
down in the middle. That's going to

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.780
work the best. I like the finger look here we

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.650
go *shoop* Nice, that looks good. Alright

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.090
cool now we just have to give that five

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.620
to ten minutes to set and we should be in

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.200
business. Alright guys time for the

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.460
reveal let's see what we got. Now this thing

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.560
is stuck solid to my workbench but it

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.180
should be rubbery, it should be able to peel up

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.010
so Bran is going to work a little saw

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.170
blade under there there's going to pull

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.440
up gently oh there we go check it out

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.820
all right actually the rest of that just

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.050
popped off no problem. Handmade iPhone 7

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.050
case! nice pun now for all the porn

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:08.040
stars we're just going to run that

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.869
underwater a little bit and clean it up

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.160
and see what our final product looks

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.130
like alright guys so update we have

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.170
arrived at a random parking lot we got

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.150
our proto putty case which is extremely

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.700
flexible extremely bendy it's got a cool

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.860
marble texture to it got the blue and

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.040
the purple which melded together really

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.829
well so originally when we had the the

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:28.629
phone in there there was not enough

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:30.549
putty in front of the phone we were

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:32.049
worried it might pop out so we add

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:34.180
another layer of blue putty and meld it

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.859
really well it looks like it was part of

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:37.150
the original case except for the color

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.799
so I think the chances of survival have

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:40.390
gone from about twenty percent to maybe

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.239
45 how do you think well I think

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:44.500
probably seventy percent chance to

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:45.609
survive all this thing's looking really

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:47.349
good so here's the contraption we got

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:48.489
set up we're just using a piece of

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:50.230
paracord dangling from the underside of

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.599
this inspire one there's a 2 loop system

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:54.250
where we use a loop on the phone and a

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.780
loop on the drone the only thing holding

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.489
these together is this fuse cord so by

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:59.170
the time this burns through the loops

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.209
will disconnect and drop our phone down

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:03.040
to the ground we are all set up cameras

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.180
ready to go drones ready to fly so it's

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.909
action time. It's action time!

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.750
alright check it out, drone's in the air

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.400
got my propane torch let's light this

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.760
thing off

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.680
the phone has impacted and I think

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:49.470
probably in the worst way possible

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.500
pretty I saw that hit face down so let's

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.480
go check the Phantom and then check if

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.010
the phone survived. We got high speed

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.240
footage right over here come check this out

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.520
guys so this is a Phantom v1611 I film

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.230
all my videos with it now we're

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.000
recording at five thousand frames per

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.430
second okay so so we got this little bit

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.290
of fuse that drops out over here and

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.330
there an impact see it comes down hits

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.830
the left side oh wow and that proto putty is

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:15.840
wigglin' like crazy it looks like a giant

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.660
water bed that's like "bloop bloop bloop" and it

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.100
bounced like freakin three or four feet

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.260
in the air oh dude that went way higher than I thought

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.710
yeah out of the shot even. Yeah, and then

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.080
the follow-up impact here oh yeah it's

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.850
almost like a whole other drop test yeah

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.560
it is so maybe so let's go find out

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.260
we're going to check out the damage

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.630
let's go check it out okay so this thing

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.550
bounced out of the proto putty and then

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.560
landed over here question I guess for

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.510
this is did it survive so it's face down

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:48.720
right now it's damaged right here

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.050
damaged right here and it's still going

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:53.940
it still recording that means we got the

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.160
footage guys what's up nice to see you

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.430
oh I'm seeing some twists some been oh

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.770
yeah I see that too yeah okay when it

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.330
impacted here you know that probably was

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.250
like a whole 'nother 15-foot drop after

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.440
it bounced out of that case huh huh that is really

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.660
impressive so when the phone came down

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.760
impacted with this side and that's where

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.530
we had the reinforcements but this side

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:15.090
wasn't reinforced to the phone popped

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.280
out and it was almost like a springboard

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.840
wasn't it flipping through the air yeah

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.640
about 15 feet high and we got a whole

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.560
nother drop test out of it but can't

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.120
believe it survived the second drop

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.440
that's actually pretty impressive which

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.020
uh well definitely bent it but this is

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.820
still a functional phone still usable

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.010
really still recording huge shout out to

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:33.479
Brandon from Gizmo Slip for making the

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:34.919
trip up here and making this video

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:37.080
possible guys this is so much fun glad I

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.630
could be here experiencing your lab it's

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:41.370
pretty awesome I'm super stoked that we

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.350
got to do this experiment first of all

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:44.969
and then to drop it from a drone

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:46.649
the epic as well. Brandon's going to have a

00:05:46.649 --> 00:05:48.599
lot more content with epic slow-mo so

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:49.769
make sure you head over to Gizmo Slip

00:05:49.769 --> 00:05:51.389
give them a subscribe and look for the

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:52.379
things that he puts out in the future

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:53.999
and thank you guys for joining us for

00:05:53.999 --> 00:05:55.229
this experiment we looking for in the

00:05:55.229 --> 00:05:57.080
next video talk to you then :)
