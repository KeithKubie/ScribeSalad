00:00:00.376 --> 00:00:02.257
- [Voiceover] We are told the square below

00:00:02.257 --> 00:00:04.138
represents one whole.

00:00:04.138 --> 00:00:06.831
So this big square here
represents a whole.

00:00:06.831 --> 00:00:11.831
Express the shaded area as
both a fraction and a decimal.

00:00:11.939 --> 00:00:13.495
So let's see, we've taken the whole

00:00:13.495 --> 00:00:17.233
and we've divided it into
one, two, three, four,

00:00:17.233 --> 00:00:22.156
five, six, seven, eight,
nine, ten, equal sections.

00:00:22.156 --> 00:00:24.872
Each of these columns or
each of these tall rectangles

00:00:24.872 --> 00:00:28.355
represent one tenth of the whole because

00:00:28.355 --> 00:00:31.838
they are ten equal sections
that it has been split into.

00:00:31.838 --> 00:00:34.485
So each of these is a tenth and let's see

00:00:34.485 --> 00:00:38.479
we have filled in one,
two, three, four, five,

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:40.777
six, of those tenths.

00:00:40.777 --> 00:00:43.030
So if I wanted to
represent it as a fraction

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.652
I would say this is 6/10 and
if I were to represent it

00:00:46.652 --> 00:00:49.577
as a decimal I would say, okay, well,

00:00:49.577 --> 00:00:53.525
I have zero ones and I have six tenths,

00:00:53.525 --> 00:00:56.938
so as a decimal it is 0.6.

00:00:56.938 --> 00:00:59.329
Let's do a couple more of these examples.

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.393
So let's say, so okay, look at that.

00:01:03.393 --> 00:01:06.388
Now I have, let's see, the big
square represents one whole.

00:01:06.388 --> 00:01:07.746
Express the shaded area as both a fraction

00:01:07.746 --> 00:01:09.037
and a decimal.

00:01:09.037 --> 00:01:10.732
So what's going on over here?

00:01:10.732 --> 00:01:15.732
So I have ten rows and in
each row I have ten squares.

00:01:16.075 --> 00:01:17.953
So ten times ten.

00:01:17.953 --> 00:01:20.553
This has a hundred squares in it.

00:01:20.553 --> 00:01:23.990
So I've divided my whole into
a hundred equal sections.

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.774
So each of these little
squares is one hundredth.

00:01:27.774 --> 00:01:30.468
So here I have shaded in one, two,

00:01:30.468 --> 00:01:34.972
three, four, five out of
the hundred hundredths,

00:01:34.972 --> 00:01:38.223
or I could say I have five
hundredths right over here.

00:01:38.223 --> 00:01:42.356
So as a fraction, I
could write this as 5/100

00:01:42.356 --> 00:01:45.166
and as a decimal I could
say, oh, I have no ones.

00:01:45.166 --> 00:01:50.065
I have no tenths and I
have five hundredths.

00:01:50.065 --> 00:01:54.848
Let's do a couple more examples of this.

00:01:54.848 --> 00:01:58.472
So let's say that I wanted to...

00:01:58.472 --> 00:02:01.303
Let's see, it says, express
the location of the point

00:02:01.303 --> 00:02:05.714
on the number line as both
a fraction and a decimal.

00:02:05.714 --> 00:02:07.502
All right. So let's think about it.

00:02:07.502 --> 00:02:11.055
So this is 2/10, this is 3/10.

00:02:11.055 --> 00:02:13.446
And you see it is 0/10, 1/10,

00:02:13.446 --> 00:02:15.954
or this is 0, 1/10, 2/10, 3/10,

00:02:15.954 --> 00:02:19.367
and before each, or between each tenth

00:02:19.367 --> 00:02:21.294
they've split it into ten equal sections.

00:02:21.294 --> 00:02:26.294
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

00:02:26.565 --> 00:02:29.142
So each of these, each
of these little hashmarks

00:02:29.142 --> 00:02:31.905
represent one hundredth.

00:02:31.905 --> 00:02:33.182
So one way you could view this is

00:02:33.182 --> 00:02:36.572
we're at two tenths,
so we have two tenths,

00:02:36.572 --> 00:02:39.800
and then we're going to
have one, two, three,

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.629
four, five, six, seven hundredths.

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:46.742
So we could view this point as two tenths

00:02:46.742 --> 00:02:48.716
and seven hundredths.

00:02:48.716 --> 00:02:50.806
So actually let me write
it as a decimal first.

00:02:50.806 --> 00:02:55.806
So we have two tenths and
we have seven hundredths.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.562
Now another way to think about this

00:02:57.562 --> 00:02:59.536
is we have 27 hundredth.

00:02:59.536 --> 00:03:00.372
You can count them.

00:03:00.372 --> 00:03:02.485
Remember each of these is one hundredth.

00:03:02.485 --> 00:03:06.269
So zero, one, two, three, four, five, six,

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:11.269
seven, eight, nine, ten,
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16,

00:03:11.494 --> 00:03:16.494
17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23,
24, 25, 26, 27, 27 hundredths.

00:03:19.899 --> 00:03:21.571
And most people when they see this number

00:03:21.571 --> 00:03:23.869
they won't say two tenths
and seven hundredths.

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:26.331
They'll just say 27 hundredths.

00:03:26.331 --> 00:03:30.464
Well how do you write 27
hundredths as a fraction?

00:03:30.464 --> 00:03:33.691
Well, it's 27/100.

00:03:33.691 --> 00:03:38.637
27 over, over 100.

00:03:38.637 --> 00:03:40.703
Let's do, I don't know,
I'm kind of in the mood.

00:03:40.703 --> 00:03:42.863
Let's do one more of these.

00:03:42.863 --> 00:03:44.279
The big square represents one whole.

00:03:44.279 --> 00:03:45.928
Express the shaded area as both a fraction

00:03:45.928 --> 00:03:47.599
and a decimal.

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:49.666
So we've already seen,
there's a hundred of these.

00:03:49.666 --> 00:03:53.752
The whole is split into a
hundred equal, smaller sections.

00:03:53.752 --> 00:03:56.283
So each of these small
squares is a hundredth

00:03:56.283 --> 00:03:58.837
and so how many hundredths
do we have shaded in?

00:03:58.837 --> 00:04:02.227
So this is going to be ten
hundredths, 20 hundredths,

00:04:02.227 --> 00:04:04.062
21 hundredths.

00:04:04.062 --> 00:04:07.962
So as a fraction I'd write that as 21/100.

00:04:07.962 --> 00:04:10.772
Now, you could, there's a couple
of ways to think about it.

00:04:10.772 --> 00:04:12.676
If we're familiar with it
already we would say okay,

00:04:12.676 --> 00:04:16.484
look, two tenths is the
same thing as 20 hundredths,

00:04:16.484 --> 00:04:18.991
so it's going to be two
tenths and one hundredth,

00:04:18.991 --> 00:04:20.338
or 21 hundredth.

00:04:20.338 --> 00:04:21.522
Another way to think about it is

00:04:21.522 --> 00:04:24.866
this first row right over
here, that's a tenth,

00:04:24.866 --> 00:04:28.465
then this next one is a
tenth, so you have two tenths,

00:04:28.465 --> 00:04:30.020
and then you have a hundredth over here.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.088
So any way you want to think about it.

00:04:31.088 --> 00:04:35.448
This is 21 hundredths or two
tenths and one hundredth.
