00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:05.520
Yeah, this one actually
has very subtle symptoms.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.710
About 45% of the loss
in cocoa in West Africa

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.630
is by pests and pathogens.

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:19.020
Of that, 15% in 2009 was
attributed to the virus.

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.870
It's spreading so fast
that it's hard to fathom

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:26.220
how we can really
stop it right now.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.940
It's fun to play with chocolate.

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:32.100
Getting all messy, and the
smell of it is just sensational.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.410
It makes me happy
to work with it.

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.480
There's just been
some real crises

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.800
at the level of the farmers,
of their socioeconomic status.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.000
So we're worried about
having our chocolate crop.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.510
But if they're
leaving the business

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.100
because they can't
make a living,

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.350
or they're diversifying
into other crops, which

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.310
is what they're doing,
over the period of time

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.350
that we see in the
near future there

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.240
could be less and less
chocolate planted there.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.750
Chocolate is in
almost every dessert

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.620
we think of, and is one of those
staples of any type of dessert

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:12.060
we talk about, from birthdays to
holiday celebrations and things

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.930
like that.

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.970
If we think about
Valentine's Day,

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.530
pretty much it's
all about chocolate

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.442
on that particular holiday.

00:01:18.442 --> 00:01:20.550
And we're able to show
that, in fact, this

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.560
is a complex of viruses, as
many as six and probably more.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.560
I'm optimistic.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.370
I think we can do this.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:30.960
We hope that the
contribution we're making

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.330
is going to make a
difference to the farmers

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.579
and downstream, of course,
to the supply of chocolate.

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:39.120
Chocolate isn't just
used for sweets.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.080
It's also used for
savory items too.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.940
It is one of those interesting
flavors that adds enhancements

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.600
to a lot of different foods.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.270
So, say a world
without chocolate,

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.520
it's almost like taking
salt away and saying

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.530
you can use it forever again.

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.350
Back in the day, if you will,
when the Mayans and things

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.720
like that were the only ones
that was doing the cocoa bean

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.810
itself, it was used as currency.

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.400
Because you can imagine
chocolate becoming maybe

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.171
a currency again,
if you would, or one

00:02:05.171 --> 00:02:07.170
of those really special
gifts that you give only

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.440
on special occasions.
