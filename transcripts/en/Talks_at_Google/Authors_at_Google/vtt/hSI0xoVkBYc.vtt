DAVID GRINSPOON: Thanks a lot.

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:08.525
I'm going to talk for
just a couple of minutes,

00:00:08.525 --> 00:00:10.316
and Alan will talk for
a couple of minutes.

00:00:10.316 --> 00:00:12.550
And then we will
entertain your questions

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:15.260
and have a discussion.

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.660
It's a thrill for us
to be here talking

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.500
to you guys about this
book, "Chasing New

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.800
Horizon", and the mission,
and the effort that led up

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.800
to the mission that finally,
after a long journey, much

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.740
of which was spent on Earth,
we finally made it to Pluto.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:44.940
And of course, Google is a part
of this story in various ways.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.450
In fact, one of the
really cool things

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:55.550
that happened after, finally,
the success of the mission

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.550
was achieved and New
Horizons made it to Pluto

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.260
was that there was a Google
Doodle about the New Horizons

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:04.760
mission.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.550
A really cool one
the next day was

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.030
part of the global
outpouring of interest

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.520
that reflected back on the
team that had achieved this.

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.570
And of course, the
connectivity of the world

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.870
that your company
has been so much

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.420
a part of is also an
interesting part of the story

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.460
because unlike other first
planetary flybys, historically,

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:34.100
that happened in the late 20th
century, the flyby of Pluto

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.490
happened in an age
where it could instantly

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.100
be shared and collectively
experienced around the world.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.530
And it really made
the experience

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.780
different for those
of us who happened

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.650
to be there at the Applied
Physics Laboratory in Laurel,

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.190
Maryland, where the team was
controlling the spacecraft

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.070
and getting the data down first.

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.480
It made the experience
different there because there

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.469
was this reaching out to the
world and feedback coming back.

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:01.010
And of course, it
made the experience

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:02.920
different for people
around the world.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.190
It was truly the first
21st century experience

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:08.900
of exploration
that was like that.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:17.731
So this book, "Chasing New ",
is the story of how Pluto was

00:02:17.731 --> 00:02:18.230
explored.

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.790
And a lot of it's
really the back story,

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.190
the aspects of
planetary exploration

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.280
and of this adventure,
this very human adventure,

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.720
that most people don't know.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.460
Everybody knows we
made it to Pluto.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.960
And like you said, in a way
it's like a spoiler alert.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.550
On the cover of the book there's
a beautiful picture of Pluto.

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.680
So a lot of this is
the drama of will they

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.419
make it against all odds.

00:02:44.419 --> 00:02:46.460
And then, of course, you
know how the story ends.

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:51.050
But it's like a lot of good
historical movies and novels

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.680
and stories.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.352
Even though you know
how it came out,

00:02:54.352 --> 00:02:56.060
you can still be on
the edge of your seat

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.210
with the drama and
all the close calls.

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:02.870
And that's the kind
of story we tell here.

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.030
I've been in love with
the story for a long time.

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.480
Way before there was a
New Horizons mission,

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.710
there was a small group, Alan
and some of his colleagues, who

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:14.660
were quite young
when they started,

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.570
just out of grad school
in their 20s and 30s,

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.910
who got this idea that
after Voyager made it

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.920
to Neptune, which was the last
of the sort of previous era

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.180
of planetary exploration.

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.030
After that in 1989, you
know, what was next?

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.720
We had had our first flybys
of all the classically known

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.030
planets except for Pluto.

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.460
And these guys said,
let's keep going.

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:40.740
And at first, they had a lot
of doors slammed in their faces

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.910
and a lot of doubters
and naysayers.

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.040
And then, as they
started going, there

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.750
were a lot of near calamities
and a lot of seeming dead ends.

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.560
But it's really a story of
overcoming obstacles and a team

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.770
that just got fixated on
an idea and didn't give up,

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.040
and eventually gathered
more and more people

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.200
to realize it was a
good idea, rallied

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.600
the scientific
community behind it.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.620
And there's a whole story there
of how the skepticism gave way

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.619
to widespread endorsement.

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:14.660
And then there were a lot
of political intrigues,

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.180
and it was canceled by
two successive political

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.899
administrations.

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:23.450
26 years from when Allen started
working on this, got the idea

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.010
and started rallying
people together,

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.520
to the actual flyby of Pluto.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.610
So you hear it took nine years
to cross the solar system.

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.290
And that is an
impressive time, and it's

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:35.960
longer than most of
our missions and did

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.640
require a lot of technical
innovation to succeed at that.

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:45.140
And yet that's like only a
small part of the long struggle

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:46.100
to make this happen.

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.140
So I was excited
to tell that story

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:51.770
and excited to work
with Alan, who lived it,

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.470
and work together to
combine our voices

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.160
and really try to narrate what
is essentially an adventure

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:03.030
story, sort of a techie, nerdy,
very human adventure story.

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.380
And it's not just Alan.

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.370
Want to make sure and
point out, he was obviously

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:09.584
the leader of the mission.

00:05:09.584 --> 00:05:11.250
But there were a lot
of people involved.

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.120
As Alan says, it's a team sport.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:18.990
And so we included the voices
of a lot of other people,

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:24.155
members of the science team,
engineers, some NASA officials,

00:05:24.155 --> 00:05:26.280
different people that were
involved in this history

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.113
and in this mission.

00:05:27.113 --> 00:05:29.820
So in the book, in
addition to our narrative,

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.660
you'll see a lot of Alan's
voice in the first person

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.050
sort of set aside
relating his experience,

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.690
but also a lot of other
voices kind of weaving in.

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:41.790
And you'll get to know
some of the characters.

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:45.210
So I've loved this
story for a long time.

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:49.110
When I got the opportunity
to actually work

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:52.950
with Alan on this book, it
was a dream come true for me

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:56.100
because I live to tell stories
of planetary exploration.

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.110
And in my view there's
no better story

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:00.510
in our time of exploration.

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:02.430
And then, of course,
Pluto itself turned out

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:07.650
to be just tremendous
scientifically, aesthetically.

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:10.210
It's beautiful, it's mysterious.

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:13.410
It's so much more active and
dynamic than anybody expected.

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:15.780
And that has taught us
a lot that we didn't

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:17.310
know about planetary science.

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.460
And it feeds back on
just our awareness

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:21.120
of what kinds of
planets there can

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.800
be in the universe in general.

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.590
So it was a huge payoff.

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:31.380
And the only person
who knows what

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:35.220
needed to be known to tell
this story, really, in full

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:36.450
is Alan Stern.

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:38.370
And it was a privilege
for me to get

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:42.296
to work with Alan to combine
our voices to tell the story.

00:06:42.296 --> 00:06:43.920
And with that, I want
to introduce Alan

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:45.830
to come up and say a few words.

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:46.930
ALAN STERN: Sure.

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:52.050
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:54.040
It's great to be here.

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:56.820
Thank you, David.

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:58.620
I don't know how many
of you know this.

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:00.870
David is the best
writer in our field.

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:04.590
As a planetary scientist, no
one has written better books

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:08.760
from "Venus Revealed", about
the radar missions that

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:11.700
uncovered the geology of Venus,
to "Earth in Human Hands",

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:15.890
his most recent work
before "Chasing",

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:17.530
and quite a number of others.

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:19.134
And it's been a
privilege for me.

00:07:19.134 --> 00:07:20.550
We've known each
other a long time

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:24.300
in a lot of different modes
over the years since we met.

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:25.900
He lived in Boulder
for a long time

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:27.847
and then in Denver,
where I'm based.

00:07:27.847 --> 00:07:29.680
DAVID GRINSPOON: He
used to be my boss, too.

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:31.320
ALAN STERN: There's that, too.

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:33.280
That's true.

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:38.780
So this is a really
interesting story.

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:40.586
I hope you get a
chance to read it,

00:07:40.586 --> 00:07:42.210
and I hope the people
watching on video

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:43.209
get a chance to read it.

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:50.680
When I was a boy I was swept off
my feet by the early planetary

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:51.430
exploration.

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:55.540
All I ever wanted to do was
grow up and get through--

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:59.290
I'm 11 years old, and just
the idea of going to a

00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:01.499
is like light year
in the future.

00:08:01.499 --> 00:08:03.040
I wanted to go to
college, and then I

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:05.790
found out you have to
go to graduate school.

00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:09.010
And then I went to graduate
school four different times.

00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:15.820
But at the time I emerged
in 1989 with my PhD,

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:17.680
Voyager was finishing.

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:20.290
And all the planets
from Mercury to Neptune

00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:24.620
had been explored, at
least first reconnaissance.

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:29.230
Pluto was kind of unfinished
business and scientifically

00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:29.900
fascinating.

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:31.480
We knew that it
had an atmosphere

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:34.216
and a giant satellite that
made it a double planet.

00:08:34.216 --> 00:08:35.799
We'd never been to
anything like that.

00:08:35.799 --> 00:08:39.730
We knew that its surface
composition was really exotic.

00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:43.122
We knew a number of really
enticing, very basic facts.

00:08:43.122 --> 00:08:45.580
But I think you could put them
all on a three by five card.

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:51.730
But to be a planetary
scientist at the beginning

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:57.040
of the age of space exploration,
the most prized missions

00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:00.340
to be on were always
the first missions.

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:03.040
Only the best got to be
on the first missions

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:06.860
to Mars or Venus or Jupiter or
Mercury or on down the line.

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:09.190
And those are the missions
where scientifically

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:14.500
you can say the result is
like taking candy from a baby.

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:18.160
Everything, every
image, is just big news,

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:21.100
every spectra, every data type.

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:25.930
And for me, and
for my generation,

00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:27.720
Pluto was the last
train to Clarksville.

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:29.470
It's like that's the only one.

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:33.490
When do we get a chance to be
on something that momentous?

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:35.410
And Voyager was just finishing.

00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:38.960
And we thought, well, NASA's
in the exploration business.

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:40.520
This will be a cinch.

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:42.490
This will be a
15-minute conversation.

00:09:42.490 --> 00:09:44.470
Who wouldn't want to
make the first mission

00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:47.350
to the last planet?

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:51.130
And 14 years later we
finally achieved funding

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:55.060
after crazy experiences,
which you read about.

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:57.490
This book is really-- you
know, if you picture the DNA

00:09:57.490 --> 00:10:01.990
double helix, picture like
a hecta helix or something,

00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:05.530
because the book is the
political story of how this all

00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:06.940
came to be.

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:11.140
And it's the scientific story
of why it was important to do

00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:14.260
and how it was transformed by
the discovery of the Kuiper

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.077
Belt into being
the first mission

00:10:16.077 --> 00:10:17.660
to the third zone
of the solar system,

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:19.540
and then these
fantastic results.

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:23.320
But it's also an under-the-hoof
look at how you build--

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:27.460
what we had to do was we had
to basically rebuilt Voyager

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:29.650
much lighter and much faster.

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:31.200
And you'll appreciate
this, I think,

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:33.370
because of some of
the projects you do.

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:37.600
We had to do it in half
the time and 1/5 the cost.

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:39.610
So we had to make a
lot of innovations.

00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:41.350
Took 2,500 men and women.

00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:44.440
I realize at Google, that's
a hobby shop project.

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:46.690
But a lot of people
worked on this,

00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:50.200
and they worked very
hard, under the gun,

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:52.390
with what some
folks thought were

00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:56.560
impossible boundary conditions.

00:10:56.560 --> 00:11:00.520
I know when we won it, we
won it against the Goliath

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:01.750
of planetary exploration.

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:04.180
Our team wanted against
JPL, Jet Propulsion Lab

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:06.520
at Cal Tech, who had been
first to every planet

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:07.930
in the solar system.

00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:11.410
We wrote the better proposal,
we marketed it better, we

00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:12.940
did have the better team.

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:15.790
And NASA, I think, made the
right choice because I do

00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:17.800
think--

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:20.740
it's uncertain to me whether the
other guys could have pulled it

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:23.020
off given all the constraints.

00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:26.650
They were really old school
and we were new school.

00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:29.290
But they were a talented
group, and I had many friends

00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:31.210
on those competing teams.

00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:32.620
Nonetheless, we got it.

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:36.905
And when we won it,
I can't tell you

00:11:36.905 --> 00:11:38.530
how many phone calls
I got from friends

00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:40.770
that were colleagues that
said you won, but you lost.

00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:42.580
And that story is in the book--

00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:44.020
David wrote it in the book--

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:45.730
because they'd say,
great, you've won.

00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:47.980
You're now in charge of the
mission to Pluto that will

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:50.950
never get launched because
either you will fail

00:11:50.950 --> 00:11:52.790
on schedule-- it
won't be your fault,

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:54.790
it will be some
vendor somewhere,

00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:56.424
some critical part you need--

00:11:56.424 --> 00:11:58.090
or you won't get
nuclear launch approval

00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:01.710
because no one's done it ever
in four years, or even close.

00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:03.610
That's 42 state and
federal agencies.

00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:07.830
You guys use the phrase
we use about herding cats?

00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:08.830
Yeah, this is different.

00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:10.766
This is cats herding themselves.

00:12:10.766 --> 00:12:11.890
It's a whole another level.

00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:15.140
It's like
three-dimensional chess.

00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:17.890
And then people
would say, what do

00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:21.520
you mean, 20%, two
dimes on the dollar?

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:24.220
You're never going to figure
that out and get it done.

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:25.920
And one of these
traps will bite you.

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:27.670
You might get through
some of these hoops,

00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:29.780
but you'll never get
through all of them.

00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:32.316
And fortunately our
team was very dedicated,

00:12:32.316 --> 00:12:34.120
dedicated to nights
and weekends.

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:41.320
The primary players were
Southwest Research Institute,

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:43.810
where I work, the
Applied Physics Lab, APL,

00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:46.730
at Johns Hopkins,
and Lockheed Martin

00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:49.490
for the launch vehicle,
the Department of Energy

00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:52.100
for the nuclear power supply.

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:56.030
By the way, because
Google is a restaurant,

00:12:56.030 --> 00:13:01.410
we used to call APL,
always a pizza lunch.

00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:03.950
It's the only thing they
would ever serve, pizza.

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:11.390
The number of pizzas I eat
are in scientific notation.

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:14.180
Anyway, this book tells
all those stories.

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:17.550
And the stories
are woven together,

00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:20.060
the science, the politics,
the how you build this,

00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:22.070
how you fly an
interplanetary mission

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:24.890
across the solar system, some
of the technologies we invented,

00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:28.040
like spacecraft hibernation,
the navigation requirements that

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:31.760
were super stringent, hit a
40- by 60-kilometer window

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:33.740
from three billion miles away.

00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:36.110
And by way, do
that while arriving

00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:37.880
within nine minutes
of the time you

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:40.700
aimed for when you
launched nine years before.

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:42.677
Do all that.

00:13:42.677 --> 00:13:43.760
And you only get one shot.

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:44.930
There's no Voyager 2 here.

00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:46.660
There's no New Horizons
2 to back it up.

00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:48.230
There's no making a U turn.

00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:50.150
We're going 4,000
kilometers a second.

00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:52.820
Get it right or go home.

00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:56.210
And it all worked out, although
we had a near-death experience,

00:13:56.210 --> 00:14:00.410
which the book begins with,
July 4th 2015, a day meant

00:14:00.410 --> 00:14:01.870
for other kinds of fireworks.

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:04.760
And my cell phone
rings, and I pick it up.

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:07.200
Even picking it up, I
saw it was the guy that's

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:08.740
our project manager.

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:10.490
And he's not calling
me on the 4th of July

00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:11.989
because he's having
a great barbecue

00:14:11.989 --> 00:14:13.730
and wants me to come over.

00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:16.040
Before he ever got the
sentence through his mouth,

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:18.620
I could tell from the gravity
of his voice, he said, Alan,

00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:21.099
we've lost contact
with the spacecraft.

00:14:21.099 --> 00:14:22.140
That just doesn't happen.

00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:25.590
It's not like when
your computer reboots.

00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:28.260
It'll be fine in five minutes.

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:31.310
So it's a really
interesting read,

00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:35.060
and I don't think there's
any book that's like it.

00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:39.020
We were on the John Bachelor
Show in Manhattan this weekend.

00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:42.620
And he kept saying,
you wrote a movie.

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:44.660
And we hope we wrote
a movie because it's

00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:48.590
a really interesting story, and
it's not just for tech heads.

00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:52.730
But it's also a story
of drama and persistence

00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:56.330
by people with a dream
that actually managed,

00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:59.630
despite a lot of
issues along the way,

00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:03.080
to pull off what they didn't
know how to do when we started.

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:06.420
And I'd be happy to answer
questions if you have some

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:07.490
and talk about this.

00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:09.950
But I want to tell one
story before I stop.

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:16.500
I've never told
this story before.

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:19.190
But I worked at NASA for a time.

00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:20.150
And when I left--

00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:21.280
this is NASA headquarters--

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:22.730
I ran the science program.

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:25.032
And that's a big enterprise.

00:15:25.032 --> 00:15:26.990
It's about five and 1/2
billion dollars a year.

00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:28.700
Not big by Google standards.

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:32.600
But I hadn't left about
10 days, and Eric Schmidt

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:37.620
invited me to come out to
Palo Alto to offer me a job.

00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:41.010
And I said no,
which may have made

00:15:41.010 --> 00:15:42.860
the difference between
whether we explored

00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:43.950
the Pluto system or not.

00:15:43.950 --> 00:15:48.740
I mean, in the end, thank
you, Eric, if you're watching.

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:51.364
The was a really enticing job.

00:15:51.364 --> 00:15:53.030
But you know, I'll
be back on the market

00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:55.960
after we finish exploring
the Kuiper Belt.

00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:59.630
Anyway, so I thought I'd just
tell that little anecdote.

00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:01.880
And then Dave, why don't
you come back up here?

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:03.779
And I don't know if--

00:16:03.779 --> 00:16:05.320
the book's been out
less than a week,

00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:07.130
so probably no one in
the room has read it.

00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:10.850
But if you have any questions
about planetary exploration,

00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:16.250
certainly astrobiology or
Pluto or the Kuiper Belt or New

00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:17.362
Horizons, have at it.

00:16:17.362 --> 00:16:19.820
DAVID GRINSPOON: I just have
to say one of the great things

00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:21.320
about working with
Alan on this book

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:24.350
is that he got a lot
of great stories.

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:27.800
And the first step of us writing
this book together was we

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:31.130
talked every Saturday,
really, for a year and a half.

00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:32.495
And he just told me stories.

00:16:32.495 --> 00:16:34.370
And I asked him questions,
and we figured out

00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:36.400
the structure of the book.

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:40.400
But I never heard
that story before.

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:41.300
That's a new one.

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:42.180
ALAN STERN: There
are a lot of stories.

00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:43.160
DAVID GRINSPOON: Yeah.

00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:44.580
ALAN STERN: We could have
written a 1,000-page book

00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:44.680
and no one would read it.

00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:46.330
DAVID GRINSPOON: What do
you guys want to know?

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:46.980
Yeah.

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:49.580
AUDIENCE: So obviously
there was a ton of buildup

00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:51.170
to actually launching.

00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:54.890
But once it actually launched,
what was that nearly a decade

00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:56.112
waiting?

00:16:56.112 --> 00:16:59.270
Like every day you have to
check in and make adjustments.

00:16:59.270 --> 00:17:01.430
Or is it just it manages
itself and you just

00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:02.856
stress for nine years?

00:17:05.544 --> 00:17:06.950
Can you explain
what that's like?

00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:08.450
ALAN STERN: The
most succinct answer

00:17:08.450 --> 00:17:11.329
would be yes to
all those things.

00:17:11.329 --> 00:17:13.819
It was intimidating to think
about nine and 1/2 years.

00:17:13.819 --> 00:17:18.079
When we first launched it, that
just seemed to me like forever.

00:17:18.079 --> 00:17:19.970
I mean, my 12-year-old's
going to be 21.

00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:23.930
I can't even picture Jordan 21.

00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:24.990
That kind of thing.

00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:26.960
And I think all of
us felt that way.

00:17:29.970 --> 00:17:33.140
One thing people don't know,
and the book does describe it,

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:37.034
is that while people think--

00:17:37.034 --> 00:17:39.200
a lot of people know the
spacecraft was hibernating,

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:41.420
so they think we
were hibernating.

00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:43.260
We had nothing to do.

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:44.600
But let me put this in context.

00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:47.110
When Voyager flew
cross the solar system,

00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:50.530
they had a staff of 450
people to run the spacecraft,

00:17:50.530 --> 00:17:52.840
to do the science team,
to do the management,

00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:54.580
to do everything.

00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:57.880
My team was large when
we were building it.

00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:01.634
But within a month of launching
it, we let everybody go.

00:18:01.634 --> 00:18:03.550
We didn't need a launch
vehicle team any more.

00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:05.720
We didn't need the
Department of Energy anymore.

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:06.650
We didn't need a
big engineering.

00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:07.983
There was nothing left to build.

00:18:07.983 --> 00:18:10.390
We just put a lot of spares
in controlled inventory,

00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:12.640
and we had already done
all the documentation,

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:15.430
and we just kept some
engineering leads.

00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:18.160
And so we were 50 people--

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:20.350
that's like the number
of people in this room--

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:22.780
to do every part of it,
from the flight controllers,

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:25.630
to the engineers, to the science
team, to the management team,

00:18:25.630 --> 00:18:28.420
to the public affairs, all that.

00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:31.700
And we were incredibly busy.

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:34.480
There's a chapter-- it's one
of my couple of favorites

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:37.240
in the whole book-- called
Battle Plan Pluto, where

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:41.217
we tell the story of how you
actually plan a flyby like this

00:18:41.217 --> 00:18:43.050
where the spacecraft
is operating completely

00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:43.870
by remote control.

00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:46.150
All the software and
all the support files

00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:52.090
have to be completely tested
in every way you can think of,

00:18:52.090 --> 00:18:55.630
and how we had to plan four
flybys because we were worried

00:18:55.630 --> 00:18:58.736
we would find hazardous
debris that could strike

00:18:58.736 --> 00:18:59.860
the spacecraft on approach.

00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:01.960
So we picked
different aim points,

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:03.500
and we could choose among them.

00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:05.380
But the point at
which you would choose

00:19:05.380 --> 00:19:07.022
was so close to
the moment of flyby

00:19:07.022 --> 00:19:08.980
that you had to have the
software on the shelf.

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:11.680
There was no oh, now we'll
write a different plan.

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:14.480
Each plan takes like a
year to develop and test.

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:16.210
So we had to do this four times.

00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:19.960
And on top of it, we
put intelligent software

00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:23.860
up on the bird that could
detect 160 something faults--

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:26.290
the fuel is leaking
or the computer's

00:19:26.290 --> 00:19:30.250
getting bad messages for this
or that, we lost com, whatever--

00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:31.960
and then would run
down a checklist.

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:34.340
It could even, as it ran
down the checklist, decision

00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:36.460
and branch based upon data.

00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:39.400
So it would act as if you
had a crew member on board.

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:41.470
We had to write and
test all that stuff.

00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:43.270
We conducted mission
simulations in which

00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:45.620
we faked the clocks
out on the bird,

00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:47.260
in flight, in the
middle of nowhere

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:48.760
between Uranus and Neptune.

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:49.990
It thinks it's 2015.

00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:52.090
It's doing nine days
of every pointing.

00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:54.490
We ship all that data back,
make sure every star field is

00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:57.064
exactly the one you intended.

00:19:57.064 --> 00:19:59.230
Every instrument was operating
at the right voltage,

00:19:59.230 --> 00:20:00.970
every little thing.

00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:02.500
We had 40 mission simulations.

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:04.300
The bottom line to all this--
and I'm only telling you part

00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:05.170
of the story--

00:20:05.170 --> 00:20:09.700
is we worked our butts
off for nine years.

00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:14.900
Alice Bowman, the woman who
runs my mission control,

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:16.570
many times came to
me and said, there's

00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:18.220
too much work for this team.

00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:20.240
We have to take content out.

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:22.440
We've got to separate
icing from cake.

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:26.710
And she called it a nine
and 1/2-year sprint.

00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:27.610
It was tough.

00:20:27.610 --> 00:20:29.620
And the spacecraft
was hibernating a lot.

00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:34.810
But this little team,
it was incessant.

00:20:34.810 --> 00:20:36.570
And all of a sudden
Pluto was there.

00:20:36.570 --> 00:20:39.010
And a lot of people were coming
and saying, wait a minute.

00:20:39.010 --> 00:20:41.030
Can we put the brakes on?

00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:42.460
I actually want to savor this.

00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:44.020
It's coming too fast.

00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:45.750
So thanks, it's
a great question.

00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:48.880
DAVID GRINSPOON: And by the
way, the hibernation mode

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:53.230
that Alan mentioned was itself
a really innovative part

00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:57.400
of this mission that was a
brilliant solution to how

00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:59.905
do you have a spacecraft
traveling for nine and 1/2

00:20:59.905 --> 00:21:01.780
years and not be worn
out when you get there,

00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:03.807
and also have the human
resources to do all

00:21:03.807 --> 00:21:05.890
that planning and simulating
that Alan was talking

00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:07.181
about with a really small team.

00:21:07.181 --> 00:21:10.150
It was part of how they
answered this question,

00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:13.000
how do we do something on a tiny
fraction of Voyager's budget?

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.340
And a lot of them have
a smaller ground team

00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:17.110
because they weren't running
the spacecraft the whole time.

00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:19.280
But it was something they
had to learn how to do.

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:20.170
And we talk about
that in the book.

00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:21.700
They practice
hibernation at first.

00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:23.866
They put it to sleep
for a couple of days,

00:21:23.866 --> 00:21:25.240
and then a week,
and then a month

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:26.920
to make sure that it works.

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:28.920
And that innovation, and
a lot of the other ones

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:31.750
they came up with, are now
part of space exploration,

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:34.482
and other missions
are using them.

00:21:34.482 --> 00:21:35.940
ALAN STERN: I'll
just say one thing

00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:37.481
and then I'll call
on this gentleman.

00:21:37.481 --> 00:21:39.820
But [INAUDIBLE] asked
me before you all

00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:42.040
came in the room
about how long it took

00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:43.930
to get the data to the ground.

00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:47.530
The dirty little secret is
we did it to save money.

00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:49.480
We intentionally
chose that if you

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:51.550
could take nine
years to reach Pluto,

00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:54.700
you could spend one more year
to get all the data back.

00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:57.460
Voyager, with 70s
technology at Neptune,

00:21:57.460 --> 00:22:00.030
almost as far as
Pluto, had ten times--

00:22:00.030 --> 00:22:01.150
DAVID GRINSPOON: There's an
antenna right there behind you.

00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:02.900
ALAN STERN: Little
two-meter dish antenna.

00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:03.890
DAVID GRINSPOON: Small.

00:22:03.890 --> 00:22:06.280
ALAN STERN: We had 1/10
the data rate of Voyager,

00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:10.330
intentionally, because we
realized what an enormous cost

00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:11.456
savings it was.

00:22:11.456 --> 00:22:13.830
You say, well, how much cheaper
can a smaller antenna be?

00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:15.160
It's not the antenna.

00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:18.700
So how much cheaper can lower
powered transmitters be?

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:20.440
They save you
millions, but millions

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:23.950
is small in an 800 and something
million dollar project.

00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:26.320
What it really was was
that if we had lower power

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:31.420
transmitters, I could graduate
down from two like Voyager

00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:33.790
to one nuclear power supply.

00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:36.820
And those babies cost
$80 million apiece.

00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:39.610
So by accepting
lower data rates,

00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:42.580
we made this very
intelligent compromise

00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:45.030
that we would take a whole
year and a little more

00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:47.890
to get the data back
in exchange for--

00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:50.529
that's almost $100
million right there.

00:22:50.529 --> 00:22:51.820
So there were a bunch of those.

00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:52.750
And we talk about them.

00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:53.624
Sorry for the detour.

00:22:53.624 --> 00:22:55.490
Yes.

00:22:55.490 --> 00:22:58.000
AUDIENCE: In your opinion,
what was more significant,

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.440
the scientific
knowledge we gained

00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:05.000
about Pluto or the
technological achievement

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.600
of having this kind
of incredible mission?

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:11.325
ALAN STERN: Oh, God,
which one of my children?

00:23:11.325 --> 00:23:14.630
AUDIENCE: My own
personal thought is OK,

00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:18.740
so it doesn't have, or does have
a core that is liquid or not.

00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:23.240
Interesting piece of
information, but not

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:24.470
Earth-shattering.

00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:27.360
But you know what
this mission entailed.

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:29.090
ALAN STERN: Yeah.

00:23:29.090 --> 00:23:31.287
I don't think there's an
answer to that, actually.

00:23:31.287 --> 00:23:33.120
Different people would
say different things.

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:34.411
And there's a third thing, too.

00:23:34.411 --> 00:23:37.950
And actually, the book ends--
the last two and 1/2 pages is

00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:39.509
a coda to the book--

00:23:39.509 --> 00:23:42.050
that actually talks about the
biggest impact and the greatest

00:23:42.050 --> 00:23:45.290
discovery was how much
it affected people, just

00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:48.230
people, just inspired
people to STEM careers

00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:55.220
and was a moonshot for a new
generation of millennials,

00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:58.880
basically, and how
it affected them.

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:00.130
But all those things are good.

00:24:00.130 --> 00:24:01.490
We don't have to
choose between them.

00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:03.057
We got all the
scientific knowledge,

00:24:03.057 --> 00:24:04.890
all the breakthroughs
in how you do low cost

00:24:04.890 --> 00:24:06.890
spaceflight to the planets.

00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:09.260
We got all the
engineering advances.

00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:11.910
And we got all the inspiration.

00:24:11.910 --> 00:24:15.130
So there's no
reason to rank them.

00:24:15.130 --> 00:24:15.880
They're all great.

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:18.338
DAVID GRINSPOON: And you'd
never have one without the other

00:24:18.338 --> 00:24:20.549
because without the motivation
for the exploration,

00:24:20.549 --> 00:24:22.340
you're not going to
have a mission with all

00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:23.360
that technical innovation.

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:24.740
But without all the
technical innovation,

00:24:24.740 --> 00:24:26.480
you're not going to have a
mission and get the science.

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:29.070
But you know, it wasn't just,
oh, it has a core or something.

00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:33.650
It actually was fundamental what
we learned there and changed

00:24:33.650 --> 00:24:36.180
our paradigms and will truly--
it sounds like cliche--

00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:40.010
but will truly require textbooks
to be rewritten because we did

00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:45.110
not expect a small planet on
the fringes of the solar system

00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:49.376
to be so geologically active
and diverse and vibrant,

00:24:49.376 --> 00:24:50.750
and parts of it
to be quite young

00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:52.670
and still currently forming.

00:24:52.670 --> 00:24:55.910
And that was something we had
to go back to the drawing boards

00:24:55.910 --> 00:24:59.180
and now have some
provisional explanations.

00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:03.710
But that's really
what drives science

00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:09.560
is this exploration that then
leads to results that shows us

00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:12.200
that our prediction and our
previous knowledge was wrong

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:15.261
and requires us
to really reinvent

00:25:15.261 --> 00:25:16.760
our theories of
planetary evolution.

00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:18.692
And New Horizons has done that.

00:25:18.692 --> 00:25:20.150
ALAN STERN: You
might imagine this.

00:25:20.150 --> 00:25:22.650
But as a science team, everybody
wanted to make predictions.

00:25:22.650 --> 00:25:24.247
And we actually
had a poll, and we

00:25:24.247 --> 00:25:26.330
had a meeting a couple of
months before the flyby.

00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:29.000
And one of my post-docs,
Amanda Zangari, ran the poll.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.290
There were like 30 questions.

00:25:30.290 --> 00:25:33.231
And we had a little team that
put together the questions.

00:25:33.231 --> 00:25:34.230
Everybody answered them.

00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:36.230
And we put the results in
the computer, of course

00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:37.771
and we were plotting
the distribution

00:25:37.771 --> 00:25:40.639
of the histogram of
how many satellites

00:25:40.639 --> 00:25:42.680
do you think we'll find,
or how many people think

00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:45.560
we'll find evidence for active
volcanism on the surface,

00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:48.380
or whatever the questions were.

00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:50.090
And then we showed
that to everybody.

00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:52.010
And then, a couple of
months after the flyby,

00:25:52.010 --> 00:25:53.884
when we had enough data
to sort of understand

00:25:53.884 --> 00:25:59.060
the lay of the land, I scored
that against the real Pluto.

00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:01.590
And it was pitiful.

00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:03.230
And so I gave the team--

00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:06.030
I literally passed
out report cards.

00:26:06.030 --> 00:26:06.530
Yes.

00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:09.530
And they gave all A's
for exploration and F's

00:26:09.530 --> 00:26:12.490
for scientific
predictive ability.

00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:13.070
Yes.

00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:13.695
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:26:13.695 --> 00:26:16.820
Firstly, thank you for
the monkeys reference.

00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:21.380
Is your subtitle optimistic
about first mission?

00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:23.695
Or you know of upcoming
missions and planets?

00:26:23.695 --> 00:26:24.320
ALAN STERN: Oh.

00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:26.101
Well, both.

00:26:26.101 --> 00:26:26.600
Both.

00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:28.430
And we actually almost-- we
had a debate about whether--

00:26:28.430 --> 00:26:30.013
I mean, there's more
been one mission,

00:26:30.013 --> 00:26:31.401
so I would just say first.

00:26:31.401 --> 00:26:32.900
It's just the epic
mission of Pluto.

00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:35.750
Isn't that enough?

00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:38.790
But first is one of those words
that it's like an SEO thing,

00:26:38.790 --> 00:26:39.290
right?

00:26:39.290 --> 00:26:41.480
It's going to get
people to look at it.

00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:45.410
But we do expect that there
will be more missions because we

00:26:45.410 --> 00:26:50.330
originally thought that we
could go in with 21st century

00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:53.150
instrumentation and
accomplish, and we did,

00:26:53.150 --> 00:26:55.340
about the equivalent of
the first 20 years of Mars

00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:58.460
exploration in one fell swoop.

00:26:58.460 --> 00:26:59.570
And we did.

00:26:59.570 --> 00:27:04.850
But we learned many things
that make my head hurt.

00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:09.020
And so we're working very hard
to see an orbiter fly there

00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:09.810
and follow up.

00:27:09.810 --> 00:27:12.764
And I think there'll be, now,
other missions to small planets

00:27:12.764 --> 00:27:14.180
in the Kuiper Belt
because we want

00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:16.660
to sample the diversity
of this new population.

00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:18.160
I think if Pluto
is that interesting

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:21.040
and some of the things we know
from ground-based and Hubble,

00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:24.000
soon we'll know from James Webb.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.060
I think that we'll also
want to look at some

00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:28.080
of the others for comparison.

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:30.140
So I expect there'll
be a lot more of this.

00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:31.640
Yes.

00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:34.500
AUDIENCE: At the risk of being
a little bit obnoxious here,

00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:37.840
I'd like you to weigh on
the merits of manned space

00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:40.680
exploration versus
robotic space exploration.

00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:44.490
And I ask this in
earnest because we,

00:27:44.490 --> 00:27:48.550
living in a quasi-democratic
country, perhaps, as citizens,

00:27:48.550 --> 00:27:50.860
get to weigh in on where
we put our dollars.

00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:53.100
Do you think the public's
perception of this

00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:55.134
is aligned with your
perception of this?

00:27:55.134 --> 00:27:57.050
ALAN STERN: Well, that's
a different question.

00:27:57.050 --> 00:27:58.790
But I will weigh in.

00:27:58.790 --> 00:28:00.530
So you said weigh
in on the merits

00:28:00.530 --> 00:28:06.290
of robotic spaceflight versus
human space flight Right.

00:28:06.290 --> 00:28:07.880
So I might translate
that question

00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:08.963
to an equivalent question.

00:28:08.963 --> 00:28:13.770
Would you please weigh in for
me on the merits of a knife,

00:28:13.770 --> 00:28:16.405
a fork, and spoon at the table?

00:28:16.405 --> 00:28:18.030
My point is they're
all different tools

00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:18.988
for different purposes.

00:28:18.988 --> 00:28:21.450
And at the table, you
really need all three.

00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:23.910
It's really hard to do
your soup with a fork,

00:28:23.910 --> 00:28:27.120
and it's really hard to
cut your steak with just

00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:28.980
the spoon or the fork.

00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:34.020
And so human space flight
and robotic space flight

00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:37.480
are really very different tools.

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:40.650
I don't know anybody
in this time that

00:28:40.650 --> 00:28:42.870
would say you need
human space flight

00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:45.840
to do weather satellites and
communications satellites

00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:47.430
and a lot of the applications.

00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:50.970
But it's still the case that
humans make much better field

00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:55.560
analysis teams than the
rovers that we have now.

00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:59.910
Apollo teams would cover about
as much ground scientifically

00:28:59.910 --> 00:29:02.340
in a three-day expedition
as a Rover mission can

00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:04.410
in five years.

00:29:04.410 --> 00:29:08.220
And they can make on the spot
discoveries that robots can't.

00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:10.067
So I think we need
all the tools.

00:29:10.067 --> 00:29:12.150
And you know, we're not
going to be sending people

00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:15.300
to Pluto anytime soon.

00:29:15.300 --> 00:29:17.730
But on the other hand, at
places like the moon and Mars,

00:29:17.730 --> 00:29:20.630
and maybe series and
smaller asteroids,

00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:23.230
the humans can really push
the pedal to the metal.

00:29:23.230 --> 00:29:25.890
And the humans do something--
even though New Horizons

00:29:25.890 --> 00:29:29.430
was a good example of
being inspirational,

00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:31.510
it's hard for the
23rd mission to Mars,

00:29:31.510 --> 00:29:35.130
for that particular robot to
really light people's fire,

00:29:35.130 --> 00:29:40.110
whereas when we
send men and women,

00:29:40.110 --> 00:29:45.010
it will be unbelievable in
terms of the worldwide response.

00:29:45.010 --> 00:29:46.710
And that's what fuels
the tech economy.

00:29:46.710 --> 00:29:50.000
You know, space is the gateway
drug to engineering and science

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:50.500
careers.

00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:54.460
Well, dinosaurs, too, but
dinosaurs always lose.

00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:56.150
So it's really space.

00:29:56.150 --> 00:29:56.700
Who else?

00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:58.200
Yes.

00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:00.090
AUDIENCE: How long did
it take after launch

00:30:00.090 --> 00:30:04.750
for you to read a paper
or see a tech report

00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:06.865
and wish that was
something you had had?

00:30:06.865 --> 00:30:07.740
ALAN STERN: On board?

00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:08.323
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:12.800
ALAN STERN: So we've
talked about that, too.

00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:16.960
And so there are two
ways to look at that.

00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:19.330
And the only realistic
way to look at it is,

00:30:19.330 --> 00:30:24.280
given the boundary conditions on
money and schedule and the era

00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:27.951
that we built it, between 2001
and '05, what would you do

00:30:27.951 --> 00:30:28.450
differently?

00:30:28.450 --> 00:30:30.250
That means a zero sum game.

00:30:30.250 --> 00:30:33.340
You have to find the money,
the mass, the resources

00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:35.680
by taking something else off.

00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:40.330
And there's no instrument or
capability on New Horizons

00:30:40.330 --> 00:30:43.126
that we wish we would trade,
that we would lose in order

00:30:43.126 --> 00:30:44.000
to do something else.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.710
Now with the Orbiter,
which will be

00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:50.770
a much more capable spacecraft
and a much wider variety

00:30:50.770 --> 00:30:53.542
of payloads,
onboard instruments,

00:30:53.542 --> 00:30:55.000
we'll do lots of
things we couldn't

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:56.830
do with a simple flyby.

00:30:56.830 --> 00:31:02.059
But I wouldn't trade If I
really could just have my wish,

00:31:02.059 --> 00:31:03.850
it would have been that
we had enough money

00:31:03.850 --> 00:31:08.211
to fly two because the far side
of Pluto and its satellites,

00:31:08.211 --> 00:31:10.210
we can only see them from
millions of kilometers

00:31:10.210 --> 00:31:13.990
away as we were screaming up,
and then they turned away.

00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:15.220
And it's frustrating.

00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:17.020
You look at the
other side of Pluto

00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:20.810
and it looks completely
different and fascinating.

00:31:20.810 --> 00:31:23.230
And what does that
have to teach us?

00:31:23.230 --> 00:31:26.080
And I'm really betting
on life extension

00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:29.500
so that I can BPI
that next mission.

00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:31.225
Yeah, right here.

00:31:31.225 --> 00:31:33.350
AUDIENCE: The mission was
a publicly funded success

00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:37.090
at a time when it's not clear
what the future holds for that.

00:31:37.090 --> 00:31:38.674
What do you think
is likely to happen.

00:31:38.674 --> 00:31:40.756
What do you think should
happen in terms of public

00:31:40.756 --> 00:31:42.890
versus private funding
for the [INAUDIBLE]??

00:31:42.890 --> 00:31:45.460
ALAN STERN: Well, fortunately--
and everybody here probably

00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:50.740
knows this-- is that commercial
space is coming on very strong.

00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:54.560
And I admit I am
very highly biased.

00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:58.990
And I also happen to be the
board chair of the Commercial

00:31:58.990 --> 00:32:01.640
Space Flight Federation, which
is the industry federation

00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:06.830
that Blue Origin and
SpaceX and everybody else

00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:10.480
is in, 80 corporations, from
small mom and pop, almost,

00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:15.310
shops all the way up to
SpaceX and Blue Origin.

00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:17.890
But I think, again,
it's not a choice

00:32:17.890 --> 00:32:20.890
between one and the other.

00:32:20.890 --> 00:32:25.570
This is a huge solar system
with dozens of worlds.

00:32:25.570 --> 00:32:31.900
And I don't know how we would
do all the things that we

00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:35.980
do on the seas and in the air if
it was all done by just the Air

00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:38.320
Force and the Navy.

00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:40.630
And besides that, if
it's one organization,

00:32:40.630 --> 00:32:42.790
you can't possibly have
the level of innovation

00:32:42.790 --> 00:32:45.130
that you get
through competition.

00:32:45.130 --> 00:32:50.350
And so I think all that's going
on at places like Blue Origin

00:32:50.350 --> 00:32:54.250
and SpaceX and all the
others is it's finally

00:32:54.250 --> 00:32:57.370
the 21st century, where we don't
just have one space program,

00:32:57.370 --> 00:32:58.790
but lots of them.

00:32:58.790 --> 00:33:02.620
And now we're starting to
have the asteroid miners

00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:06.550
and the moon miners and
lots more applications being

00:33:06.550 --> 00:33:07.350
talked about.

00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:09.700
I think the 20s are going
to be just spectacular.

00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:12.070
But also what NASA is going
to be doing in the 20s,

00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:17.140
which you would not see
commercial enterprises

00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:20.350
exploring Europa for
scientific knowledge.

00:33:20.350 --> 00:33:23.440
But you might see
commercial enterprises

00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:28.450
sending payloads to Mars
because they can find customers

00:33:28.450 --> 00:33:30.045
that want to fly those.

00:33:30.045 --> 00:33:32.170
So sort of the vanguard,
the leading edge, I think,

00:33:32.170 --> 00:33:36.790
is always going to be the
government in most respects.

00:33:36.790 --> 00:33:40.090
But private industry is what
comes in and really turns it

00:33:40.090 --> 00:33:44.080
into part of the
economy and what we do.

00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:46.060
And we need both.

00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:48.580
DAVID GRINSPOON: And nobody
at NASA that I know--

00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:50.470
we both know a lot
of people at NASA--

00:33:50.470 --> 00:33:53.680
nobody there is bummed
out that oh, now we

00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:56.050
have these competitors
from private industry.

00:33:56.050 --> 00:33:57.640
They're like, oh, great.

00:33:57.640 --> 00:33:59.440
We don't have to be
the trucking service up

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:01.810
to orbit, or the bus service.

00:34:01.810 --> 00:34:04.760
We can focus on other things
that only NASA can do.

00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:07.720
And so the private
public partnership

00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:10.659
is really being sought by
both sides in that equation

00:34:10.659 --> 00:34:15.429
and is shaping up to really
accelerate space exploration

00:34:15.429 --> 00:34:16.761
in this century.

00:34:16.761 --> 00:34:17.469
ALAN STERN: Yeah.

00:34:17.469 --> 00:34:20.350
And Jim Bridenstine, who's
the new NASA administrator,

00:34:20.350 --> 00:34:23.319
really gets it with public
private partnerships.

00:34:23.319 --> 00:34:24.610
I think he's going to be great.

00:34:24.610 --> 00:34:26.199
I'm left-handed, so
I've been biasing

00:34:26.199 --> 00:34:27.300
to this side of the room.

00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:28.633
Is there any question over here?

00:34:28.633 --> 00:34:29.920
Yes.

00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:34.090
AUDIENCE: So this is not the
only recent exploratory mission

00:34:34.090 --> 00:34:35.980
to an icy body in
the solar systems,

00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:38.830
because we also had the
Rosetta probe to the comet.

00:34:38.830 --> 00:34:41.409
I was wondering if there
is anything especially

00:34:41.409 --> 00:34:45.600
in the astrobiology sector,
maybe, that stood out,

00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:47.050
like that was
either surprisingly

00:34:47.050 --> 00:34:50.500
different or surprisingly
the same between and Pluto

00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:52.500
and the comet, whose
name I've forgotten?

00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:57.844
ALAN STERN: Well, can I just
say Churyumov-Gerasimenko.

00:34:57.844 --> 00:34:59.260
DAVID GRINSPOON:
Very nicely done.

00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:03.160
ALAN STERN: Well, I was on the
Rosetta mission for 22 years.

00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:05.860
We do call it C-G.
It's too much.

00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:08.230
DAVID GRINSPOON: So
Alan can probably

00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:11.372
comment in a more sophisticated
way about the comet

00:35:11.372 --> 00:35:12.580
since he was on that mission.

00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:15.300
But I will say, from an
astrobiology perspective, one

00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:17.250
of the amazing things
about New Horizons

00:35:17.250 --> 00:35:20.910
and Pluto is the
evidence that there

00:35:20.910 --> 00:35:27.060
is an ocean of liquid water
beneath the icy crust of Pluto.

00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:30.180
It seems like there's
circumstantial evidence

00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:32.520
that there are features
of the planet that

00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:35.312
are easiest to explain if
there is a liquid water ocean.

00:35:35.312 --> 00:35:37.020
And one of the things
we would definitely

00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:39.390
want to do with this orbiter
Alan is talking about

00:35:39.390 --> 00:35:43.980
if we go back is map
the gravity field

00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:45.934
and do other things
to really make sure we

00:35:45.934 --> 00:35:47.100
understand that that's true.

00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:50.070
But it's seeming like there is
an ocean of liquid water, which

00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:52.200
is amazing from an
astrobiology perspective

00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:55.470
because any place where
there's an ocean of water

00:35:55.470 --> 00:35:57.930
is a candidate for
extraterrestrial life.

00:35:57.930 --> 00:36:01.140
So just as you've heard
about Europa and Enceladus

00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:03.810
as possible homes for
life underneath the ice,

00:36:03.810 --> 00:36:06.562
we really have to add
Pluto to that list now.

00:36:06.562 --> 00:36:07.270
ALAN STERN: Yeah.

00:36:07.270 --> 00:36:08.850
And keep in mind--

00:36:08.850 --> 00:36:12.210
so I PI of the ultraviolet
spectrometer on Rosetta.

00:36:12.210 --> 00:36:16.320
So we won that project
in the beginning in 1996

00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:19.656
and the flight
mission ended in 2016.

00:36:19.656 --> 00:36:21.780
And actually, the data
analysis part of the project

00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:24.270
is still ongoing.

00:36:24.270 --> 00:36:27.600
But you know, the comet C-G,
the one with all the syllables,

00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:30.240
is about the size
of Cambridge, Mass.

00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:32.670
And Pluto's the surface
area of the United States.

00:36:32.670 --> 00:36:34.320
So it's a different
scale, and the kind

00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:36.550
of science you're doing
is very different.

00:36:36.550 --> 00:36:38.240
Who else?

00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:39.130
Yep.

00:36:39.130 --> 00:36:41.958
AUDIENCE: What was the biggest--

00:36:41.958 --> 00:36:44.910
what was the most
frustrating mistake

00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:48.120
that you look back on of,
oh, we didn't do this right.

00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:50.030
If I could go back
and change one thing.

00:36:50.030 --> 00:36:52.550
What was the biggest takeaway?

00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:56.040
ALAN STERN: Wow,
that's a good question.

00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:58.110
I ought to say the
thing that nearly killed

00:36:58.110 --> 00:37:00.210
the spacecraft 10 days out.

00:37:00.210 --> 00:37:04.050
But it sure brought
a lot of viewership.

00:37:04.050 --> 00:37:07.792
The last minute, all of a
sudden it's life or death.

00:37:07.792 --> 00:37:09.750
DAVID GRINSPOON: There
were some other mistakes

00:37:09.750 --> 00:37:11.370
that we describe in the book.

00:37:11.370 --> 00:37:13.710
But fortunately none
of them were fatal

00:37:13.710 --> 00:37:17.210
because we have a success story.

00:37:17.210 --> 00:37:20.730
But they're illustrative.

00:37:20.730 --> 00:37:23.430
I mean, one thing you learn
in this book is how carefully

00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:26.640
everything was checked by
independent teams, and just

00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:28.067
a lot of amazing
troubleshooting.

00:37:28.067 --> 00:37:29.400
And very little slipped through.

00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:32.340
But there was one
spreadsheet where

00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:37.620
one thruster had the wrong
specs and was built and flown

00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:39.300
with the wrong
specs so that it was

00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:43.530
going to fire too many times
and exhaust its lifetime

00:37:43.530 --> 00:37:44.820
before they got to Pluto.

00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:47.400
And they discovered this
when they were in flight.

00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:50.400
And they were able to
make some workarounds.

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:52.590
But that was sort of
almost the exception

00:37:52.590 --> 00:37:54.420
that proves the
rule because there

00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:56.150
was almost nothing like that.

00:37:56.150 --> 00:37:58.110
But it was really
illustrative of why

00:37:58.110 --> 00:38:01.140
it was so important that they
do all that ridiculous amount

00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:04.170
of checking and double checking
because so little slipped

00:38:04.170 --> 00:38:04.740
through.

00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:07.435
But that was maybe
not the worst mistake,

00:38:07.435 --> 00:38:08.810
but it's an
illustrative mistake.

00:38:08.810 --> 00:38:09.518
ALAN STERN: Yeah.

00:38:09.518 --> 00:38:11.040
Yeah.

00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:11.540
I'm sorry.

00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:13.260
I really don't
have a good answer

00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:15.960
because most of the things
that I think I did wrong

00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:20.190
or we did wrong actually, in
the end, worked out better.

00:38:20.190 --> 00:38:23.970
So for example, if I could do
it again, some of the things

00:38:23.970 --> 00:38:26.310
I was doing in the
90s to lead the effort

00:38:26.310 --> 00:38:28.560
to get a mission to
Pluto, I think now,

00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:31.970
with more experience, I
could have made it happen.

00:38:31.970 --> 00:38:33.810
But then I would have
just been a bit player

00:38:33.810 --> 00:38:36.400
on that mission instead of being
able to lead the whole thing.

00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:38.650
So I don't want to
make that happen.

00:38:38.650 --> 00:38:41.290
This was a lot more fun.

00:38:41.290 --> 00:38:42.337
Yeah, you go.

00:38:42.337 --> 00:38:44.670
AUDIENCE: I have a question
with regard to [INAUDIBLE]..

00:38:44.670 --> 00:38:48.710
A lot of the story here
revolves around politics

00:38:48.710 --> 00:38:49.995
and political struggle.

00:38:49.995 --> 00:38:52.470
And I was wondering, the fact
that Pluto, at some point,

00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:56.160
was demoted, was it part
of a political game?

00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:58.950
How could you explain it?

00:38:58.950 --> 00:39:01.640
ALAN STERN: I don't think
it was a political game.

00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:04.420
There are really two
things that were going on.

00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:07.849
One is, I think, appreciated
by a lot of people, which is--

00:39:07.849 --> 00:39:10.015
I think especially here,
you have the sophistication

00:39:10.015 --> 00:39:12.240
to know astronomers are
not planetary scientists.

00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:13.640
Different expertise.

00:39:13.640 --> 00:39:17.070
When I give a public talk, I say
neurologists and podiatrists.

00:39:17.070 --> 00:39:19.357
Don't go to one for a
problem with the other.

00:39:19.357 --> 00:39:20.190
Different expertise.

00:39:20.190 --> 00:39:22.890
But people in the public,
including my own mother,

00:39:22.890 --> 00:39:26.160
confuses that all astronomers
must know everything

00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:27.720
about everything in space.

00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:31.710
They were really trying to cope
with large numbers of planet

00:39:31.710 --> 00:39:34.766
discoveries and thinking
in a 20th century way,

00:39:34.766 --> 00:39:36.390
I would say, that
the number of planets

00:39:36.390 --> 00:39:37.770
should be small
so schoolchildren

00:39:37.770 --> 00:39:38.811
can remember their names.

00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:45.779
I wish that they'd just
been consistent and gone on

00:39:45.779 --> 00:39:47.820
and had motions they'd
voted on other things they

00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:50.289
don't know about, and just
gone ahead and legislate it.

00:39:50.289 --> 00:39:52.830
We're only also going to have
eight elements and eight states

00:39:52.830 --> 00:39:53.730
now.

00:39:53.730 --> 00:39:54.780
But they didn't.

00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:56.220
So the press picked up on it.

00:39:56.220 --> 00:40:01.290
And the press, also naively,
took it as expertise

00:40:01.290 --> 00:40:04.980
and sort of made
it a fait accompli,

00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:07.800
when people like David
and myself and others

00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:10.250
in planetary science,
a joining profession

00:40:10.250 --> 00:40:13.599
of a different expertise, never
said that, and don't buy it,

00:40:13.599 --> 00:40:15.140
and don't even buy
the idea of voting

00:40:15.140 --> 00:40:18.560
in science because it's sort
of an illegitimate process.

00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:21.960
We could all vote that the
theory of evolution is wrong.

00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:25.250
It doesn't matter how many
Nobel Laureates vote for it.

00:40:25.250 --> 00:40:29.090
That doesn't mean that the data
doesn't support the theory.

00:40:29.090 --> 00:40:31.850
The other thing that was going
on-- and it's very rarely

00:40:31.850 --> 00:40:37.490
discussed-- but it's the fact
that in 1980, an astronomer

00:40:37.490 --> 00:40:40.520
named Brian Marsden, who
was very accomplished,

00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:43.580
had a very public with
the man who discovered

00:40:43.580 --> 00:40:46.490
Pluto named Clyde Tombaugh.

00:40:46.490 --> 00:40:49.550
And he actually
said at a meeting

00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:52.140
in front of a lot of people,
you're older than me,

00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:56.290
and when you're gone, I
will erase your legacy.

00:40:56.290 --> 00:40:59.750
And Marsden is the person
that led the IAU week

00:40:59.750 --> 00:41:04.580
to pass that resolution
which took Pluto

00:41:04.580 --> 00:41:07.430
off the astronomers' list.

00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:10.975
And so there's a
lot of bad blood.

00:41:10.975 --> 00:41:12.350
DAVID GRINSPOON:
Yeah, and if you

00:41:12.350 --> 00:41:18.650
look at the specific technical
description in the IAU's

00:41:18.650 --> 00:41:21.410
attempt at redefining
planet, just

00:41:21.410 --> 00:41:25.610
from a scientific,
quantitative perspective,

00:41:25.610 --> 00:41:27.390
it doesn't make any sense.

00:41:27.390 --> 00:41:29.150
They did a sloppy job.

00:41:29.150 --> 00:41:31.760
Well, for one thing, they said
a planet has to orbit the sun.

00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:34.280
They ignored all the
exoplanets, which is ridiculous.

00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:36.890
But also even within
our own solar system,

00:41:36.890 --> 00:41:38.510
they had this
criterion that a planet

00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:41.510
must-- supposedly they said
it must clear its zone.

00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:43.400
So they defined
a planet in terms

00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:47.420
of what orbits around it and not
its own intrinsic properties.

00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:51.290
And that leads to some very
silly, absurd conclusions,

00:41:51.290 --> 00:41:55.190
like that Earth was not a planet
for its first 500 million years

00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:57.860
because it was orbiting in a
swarm of material left over

00:41:57.860 --> 00:41:59.270
from the formation of the sun.

00:41:59.270 --> 00:42:01.900
And if you took Earth today
and moved it somewhere else,

00:42:01.900 --> 00:42:03.980
say out in the asteroid
belt or something,

00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:06.060
it would not be a planet.

00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:08.600
So there are a lot of just
sort of unsatisfying aspects

00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:09.710
of the definition.

00:42:09.710 --> 00:42:12.190
So it certainly
made sense to them

00:42:12.190 --> 00:42:15.560
to talk about classifying
Pluto and other small planets

00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:19.150
like it as a different subclass
of planets, dwarf planets.

00:42:19.150 --> 00:42:19.895
That's fine.

00:42:19.895 --> 00:42:21.270
But then they sort
of added this,

00:42:21.270 --> 00:42:23.120
and a dwarf planet
is not a planet.

00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:25.760
And it was kind of
vindictive and nonsensical.

00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:28.770
And so in planetary
science, at our meetings,

00:42:28.770 --> 00:42:31.760
you'll hear us referring
to Pluto a planet.

00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:34.280
And we almost kind
of don't really

00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:36.700
even want to talk about
this, except for it is worth

00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:38.450
talking about because
people are confused,

00:42:38.450 --> 00:42:39.650
and they want to know.

00:42:39.650 --> 00:42:41.710
And so we have to
try to clarify it.

00:42:41.710 --> 00:42:42.960
ALAN STERN: He said we
don't want to talk about it.

00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:45.168
But yesterday in "The
Washington Post", the two of us

00:42:45.168 --> 00:42:46.350
had an Op Ed.

00:42:46.350 --> 00:42:47.300
DAVID GRINSPOON: Yeah.

00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:50.922
AUDIENCE: So how many plants
are there on your list?

00:42:50.922 --> 00:42:52.130
DAVID GRINSPOON: Uncountable.

00:42:52.130 --> 00:42:55.800
ALAN STERN: So yeah,
that's really the answer.

00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:56.300
Oh, known?

00:42:56.300 --> 00:42:57.680
It's in the mid 20s.

00:42:57.680 --> 00:42:58.490
DAVID GRINSPOON: In
our solar system.

00:42:58.490 --> 00:42:59.510
ALAN STERN: In our solar system.

00:42:59.510 --> 00:43:01.593
But of course there are
thousands of known planets

00:43:01.593 --> 00:43:02.540
around other stars.

00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:04.890
But you know, who cares?

00:43:04.890 --> 00:43:06.890
There's countless mountains
and rivers and stars

00:43:06.890 --> 00:43:09.290
and asteroids and galaxies
and all those things.

00:43:09.290 --> 00:43:13.670
Space is all about, oh,
astronomical numbers.

00:43:13.670 --> 00:43:16.160
So we really need to
get over the notion.

00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:19.070
The notion that there were
a small number of planets,

00:43:19.070 --> 00:43:21.350
I think, is
equivalent to somebody

00:43:21.350 --> 00:43:22.850
who grew up on a
desert island where

00:43:22.850 --> 00:43:24.999
there were a countable
number of palm trees.

00:43:24.999 --> 00:43:26.540
And you think that's
it for the world

00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:28.302
because you don't see
any other islands.

00:43:28.302 --> 00:43:29.510
They're all over the horizon.

00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:33.620
Then you develop the
technology for ocean travel,

00:43:33.620 --> 00:43:35.130
and you can now go
to other places.

00:43:35.130 --> 00:43:39.440
And you discover that all those
trees, you gave them names.

00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:41.630
There's so many you
can't name them all.

00:43:41.630 --> 00:43:43.130
So you decide those
aren't actually

00:43:43.130 --> 00:43:47.480
palm trees for whatever
reason, just to keep it small.

00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:48.810
So it's kind of crazy.

00:43:48.810 --> 00:43:49.310
OK.

00:43:49.310 --> 00:43:52.730
I guess we're going to say thank
you for coming out at lunch.

00:43:52.730 --> 00:43:54.580
