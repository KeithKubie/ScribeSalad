you so formally had had raised some

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530
you so formally had had raised some
 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.430
you so formally had had raised some
questions about basically saying when I

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440
questions about basically saying when I
 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.990
questions about basically saying when I
use my my spinner the the spinner

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000
use my my spinner the the spinner
 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.160
use my my spinner the the spinner
drop-down will change pages

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:26.170
drop-down will change pages
 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:29.190
drop-down will change pages
but when I actually swipe across pages

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200
but when I actually swipe across pages
 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.700

it doesn't update the spinner for me so

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710
it doesn't update the spinner for me so
 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.430

I need do you want to take this one yeah
 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.840

so I think the viewpager is not wired up

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:39.850
so I think the viewpager is not wired up
 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.630
so I think the viewpager is not wired up
to spinner so that the viewpager events

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:42.640
to spinner so that the viewpager events
 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.490
to spinner so that the viewpager events
are propagated back to spinner so

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500
are propagated back to spinner so
 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.970
are propagated back to spinner so
there's one thing you can do is you can

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:47.980
there's one thing you can do is you can
 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:50.430
there's one thing you can do is you can
try obtaining the so when you swipe and

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440
try obtaining the so when you swipe and
 

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.650
try obtaining the so when you swipe and
move to a certain fragment you can try

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660
move to a certain fragment you can try
 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.020
move to a certain fragment you can try
obtaining the the item from the spinner

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030
obtaining the the item from the spinner
 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.210
obtaining the the item from the spinner
adapter which is basically what's

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220
adapter which is basically what's
 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.490

backing up the spinner can try obtaining

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500
backing up the spinner can try obtaining
 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.260
backing up the spinner can try obtaining
that fragment from the spinner adapter

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270
that fragment from the spinner adapter
 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.210
that fragment from the spinner adapter
the position of their fragment and then

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.220
the position of their fragment and then
 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.650
the position of their fragment and then
manually called spinner dot said

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:04.660
manually called spinner dot said
 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.650
manually called spinner dot said
selection and provide that position to

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:07.660
selection and provide that position to
 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.150
selection and provide that position to
the spinner so I think that should

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160
the spinner so I think that should
 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.710
the spinner so I think that should
change up the spinner view but you may

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:13.720
change up the spinner view but you may
 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.510
change up the spinner view but you may
want to check if the event is again

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520
want to check if the event is again
 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.400
want to check if the event is again
fight back and tries to again you know

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:17.410
fight back and tries to again you know
 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:19.170
fight back and tries to again you know
switch to that fragment in that case you

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180
switch to that fragment in that case you
 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:20.760
switch to that fragment in that case you
can overwrite that I went to say hey

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.770
can overwrite that I went to say hey
 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:22.800
can overwrite that I went to say hey
it's a swipe so don't really change the

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:22.810
it's a swipe so don't really change the
 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:28.680
it's a swipe so don't really change the
fragment fair enough thank you hey

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:28.690
fragment fair enough thank you hey
 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:31.590
fragment fair enough thank you hey

before we move on to add what's Dana
office car listening and today okay no

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:37.330
office car listening and today okay no
 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:42.720
office car listening and today okay no
worries I'll just screen share again the

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:42.730
worries I'll just screen share again the
 

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:46.890
worries I'll just screen share again the
the set of questions so I'm he had also

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:46.900
the set of questions so I'm he had also
 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:51.480
the set of questions so I'm he had also
asked us some questions last week and we

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:51.490
asked us some questions last week and we
 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:53.930
asked us some questions last week and we
didn't have the questions the answers

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:53.940
didn't have the questions the answers
 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:56.250
didn't have the questions the answers
available for him live at the time so I

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:56.260
available for him live at the time so I
 

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.800
available for him live at the time so I
i asked him afterwards to post them on

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:58.810
i asked him afterwards to post them on
 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:00.990
i asked him afterwards to post them on
the moderator so that we could answer

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:01.000
the moderator so that we could answer
 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.700
the moderator so that we could answer
them that in the the next office hours

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:02.710
them that in the the next office hours
 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:04.830
them that in the the next office hours
so let's look at his question he said

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:04.840
so let's look at his question he said
 

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:06.780
so let's look at his question he said
first but thanks for the follow up on

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:06.790
first but thanks for the follow up on
 

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:09.180
first but thanks for the follow up on
this he had two questions what is the

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:09.190
this he had two questions what is the
 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:11.250
this he had two questions what is the
optimal way to get the existing fragment

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:11.260
optimal way to get the existing fragment
 

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.320
optimal way to get the existing fragment
from a view pager it's question number

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:13.330
from a view pager it's question number
 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.560
from a view pager it's question number
one and question number two is what is

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:16.570
one and question number two is what is
 

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:18.360
one and question number two is what is
the difference between a few animator

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:18.370
the difference between a few animator
 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:21.930
the difference between a few animator
and a view flipper okay so first

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:21.940
and a view flipper okay so first
 

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:23.910
and a view flipper okay so first
question what's the optimal way to get

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:23.920
question what's the optimal way to get
 

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:26.060
question what's the optimal way to get
the existing fragment from the viewpager

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:26.070
the existing fragment from the viewpager
 

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:28.980
the existing fragment from the viewpager
the viewpager can actually give you you

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:28.990
the viewpager can actually give you you
 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:32.190
the viewpager can actually give you you
can get the ID of your fragment from the

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:32.200
can get the ID of your fragment from the
 

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.420
can get the ID of your fragment from the
viewpager that's the one that's

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:33.430
viewpager that's the one that's
 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:35.580
viewpager that's the one that's
currently being displayed and then you

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:35.590
currently being displayed and then you
 

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:37.050
currently being displayed and then you
can use your fragment manager to

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:37.060
can use your fragment manager to
 

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:39.519
can use your fragment manager to
basically go and pull that pull

00:06:39.519 --> 00:06:39.529
basically go and pull that pull
 

00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:42.119
basically go and pull that pull
in itself now I remember Abby had also

00:06:42.119 --> 00:06:42.129
in itself now I remember Abby had also
 

00:06:42.129 --> 00:06:45.369
in itself now I remember Abby had also
had some questions around well if I've

00:06:45.369 --> 00:06:45.379
had some questions around well if I've
 

00:06:45.379 --> 00:06:47.049
had some questions around well if I've
already instantiated a bunch of

00:06:47.049 --> 00:06:47.059
already instantiated a bunch of
 

00:06:47.059 --> 00:06:50.049
already instantiated a bunch of
fragments how do I ask the viewpager to

00:06:50.049 --> 00:06:50.059
fragments how do I ask the viewpager to
 

00:06:50.059 --> 00:06:52.359
fragments how do I ask the viewpager to
go return me those fragments now you

00:06:52.359 --> 00:06:52.369
go return me those fragments now you
 

00:06:52.369 --> 00:06:53.649
go return me those fragments now you
have to be a little bit careful here

00:06:53.649 --> 00:06:53.659
have to be a little bit careful here
 

00:06:53.659 --> 00:06:55.569
have to be a little bit careful here
because the way the viewpager works is

00:06:55.569 --> 00:06:55.579
because the way the viewpager works is
 

00:06:55.579 --> 00:06:59.049
because the way the viewpager works is
that it it actually will will

00:06:59.049 --> 00:06:59.059
that it it actually will will
 

00:06:59.059 --> 00:07:02.049
that it it actually will will
instantiate those fragments when it

00:07:02.049 --> 00:07:02.059
instantiate those fragments when it
 

00:07:02.059 --> 00:07:03.939
instantiate those fragments when it
needs to and it will keep bits and

00:07:03.939 --> 00:07:03.949
needs to and it will keep bits and
 

00:07:03.949 --> 00:07:06.219
needs to and it will keep bits and
pieces of them around depending on

00:07:06.219 --> 00:07:06.229
pieces of them around depending on
 

00:07:06.229 --> 00:07:09.309
pieces of them around depending on
whether you're using a fragment page

00:07:09.309 --> 00:07:09.319
whether you're using a fragment page
 

00:07:09.319 --> 00:07:12.659
whether you're using a fragment page
adapter or a fragment state page adapter

00:07:12.659 --> 00:07:12.669
adapter or a fragment state page adapter
 

00:07:12.669 --> 00:07:15.939
adapter or a fragment state page adapter
so there's two ways you can actually try

00:07:15.939 --> 00:07:15.949
so there's two ways you can actually try
 

00:07:15.949 --> 00:07:18.159
so there's two ways you can actually try
and fetch you know these fragments that

00:07:18.159 --> 00:07:18.169
and fetch you know these fragments that
 

00:07:18.169 --> 00:07:19.949
and fetch you know these fragments that
have been proved pre instantiating the

00:07:19.949 --> 00:07:19.959
have been proved pre instantiating the
 

00:07:19.959 --> 00:07:22.539
have been proved pre instantiating the
first is that when you instantiate the

00:07:22.539 --> 00:07:22.549
first is that when you instantiate the
 

00:07:22.549 --> 00:07:25.209
first is that when you instantiate the
fragment add it to your fragment manager

00:07:25.209 --> 00:07:25.219
fragment add it to your fragment manager
 

00:07:25.219 --> 00:07:27.939
fragment add it to your fragment manager
using a tag you know give it a name and

00:07:27.939 --> 00:07:27.949
using a tag you know give it a name and
 

00:07:27.949 --> 00:07:30.369
using a tag you know give it a name and
then you later on you can you can query

00:07:30.369 --> 00:07:30.379
then you later on you can you can query
 

00:07:30.379 --> 00:07:32.019
then you later on you can you can query
the framer manager to go return that

00:07:32.019 --> 00:07:32.029
the framer manager to go return that
 

00:07:32.029 --> 00:07:34.779
the framer manager to go return that
particular fragment the other way you

00:07:34.779 --> 00:07:34.789
particular fragment the other way you
 

00:07:34.789 --> 00:07:36.429
particular fragment the other way you
can do it is that when you instantiate

00:07:36.429 --> 00:07:36.439
can do it is that when you instantiate
 

00:07:36.439 --> 00:07:38.859
can do it is that when you instantiate
your fragments you can track it in your

00:07:38.859 --> 00:07:38.869
your fragments you can track it in your
 

00:07:38.869 --> 00:07:41.859
your fragments you can track it in your
own you know array or vector or map

00:07:41.859 --> 00:07:41.869
own you know array or vector or map
 

00:07:41.869 --> 00:07:44.559
own you know array or vector or map
yourself and hold onto it there so when

00:07:44.559 --> 00:07:44.569
yourself and hold onto it there so when
 

00:07:44.569 --> 00:07:46.209
yourself and hold onto it there so when
you need to go and fetch it you can go

00:07:46.209 --> 00:07:46.219
you need to go and fetch it you can go
 

00:07:46.219 --> 00:07:47.789
you need to go and fetch it you can go
and return the one that's already been

00:07:47.789 --> 00:07:47.799
and return the one that's already been
 

00:07:47.799 --> 00:07:50.709
and return the one that's already been
instantiated so that's question one

00:07:50.709 --> 00:07:50.719
instantiated so that's question one
 

00:07:50.719 --> 00:07:52.329
instantiated so that's question one
question two is what is the difference

00:07:52.329 --> 00:07:52.339
question two is what is the difference
 

00:07:52.339 --> 00:07:55.449
question two is what is the difference
between the the view flipper and the

00:07:55.449 --> 00:07:55.459
between the the view flipper and the
 

00:07:55.459 --> 00:07:58.779
between the the view flipper and the
view animator well the view animator is

00:07:58.779 --> 00:07:58.789
view animator well the view animator is
 

00:07:58.789 --> 00:08:00.159
view animator well the view animator is
actually the base class for the view

00:08:00.159 --> 00:08:00.169
actually the base class for the view
 

00:08:00.169 --> 00:08:01.959
actually the base class for the view
flip but so the view flippers is a

00:08:01.959 --> 00:08:01.969
flip but so the view flippers is a
 

00:08:01.969 --> 00:08:04.269
flip but so the view flippers is a
specialized version of the view animator

00:08:04.269 --> 00:08:04.279
specialized version of the view animator
 

00:08:04.279 --> 00:08:07.239
specialized version of the view animator
and it's it's really there so that you

00:08:07.239 --> 00:08:07.249
and it's it's really there so that you
 

00:08:07.249 --> 00:08:09.729
and it's it's really there so that you
can have a set of views that you can you

00:08:09.729 --> 00:08:09.739
can have a set of views that you can you
 

00:08:09.739 --> 00:08:11.409
can have a set of views that you can you
know really go from one to the next and

00:08:11.409 --> 00:08:11.419
know really go from one to the next and
 

00:08:11.419 --> 00:08:13.539
know really go from one to the next and
the next and have some sort of animation

00:08:13.539 --> 00:08:13.549
the next and have some sort of animation
 

00:08:13.549 --> 00:08:15.969
the next and have some sort of animation
play now so the view animator allows you

00:08:15.969 --> 00:08:15.979
play now so the view animator allows you
 

00:08:15.979 --> 00:08:17.949
play now so the view animator allows you
to specify things like which which

00:08:17.949 --> 00:08:17.959
to specify things like which which
 

00:08:17.959 --> 00:08:19.689
to specify things like which which
particular animation you want you want

00:08:19.689 --> 00:08:19.699
particular animation you want you want
 

00:08:19.699 --> 00:08:22.209
particular animation you want you want
to to use when you transition from one

00:08:22.209 --> 00:08:22.219
to to use when you transition from one
 

00:08:22.219 --> 00:08:25.539
to to use when you transition from one
view to the next and view flipper itself

00:08:25.539 --> 00:08:25.549
view to the next and view flipper itself
 

00:08:25.549 --> 00:08:28.829
view to the next and view flipper itself
actually specializes in the sense that

00:08:28.829 --> 00:08:28.839
actually specializes in the sense that
 

00:08:28.839 --> 00:08:31.719
actually specializes in the sense that
the main thing that it can do is that

00:08:31.719 --> 00:08:31.729
the main thing that it can do is that
 

00:08:31.729 --> 00:08:34.480
the main thing that it can do is that
you can actually say hey I want a

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:34.490
you can actually say hey I want a
 

00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:37.299
you can actually say hey I want a
specific time interval go to the next

00:08:37.299 --> 00:08:37.309
specific time interval go to the next
 

00:08:37.309 --> 00:08:39.279
specific time interval go to the next
view automatically so you could say

00:08:39.279 --> 00:08:39.289
view automatically so you could say
 

00:08:39.289 --> 00:08:41.439
view automatically so you could say
maybe every five seconds it might be a

00:08:41.439 --> 00:08:41.449
maybe every five seconds it might be a
 

00:08:41.449 --> 00:08:44.230
maybe every five seconds it might be a
photo a photo gallery app right so you

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:44.240
photo a photo gallery app right so you
 

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:45.939
photo a photo gallery app right so you
might be wanting to show a slideshow so

00:08:45.939 --> 00:08:45.949
might be wanting to show a slideshow so
 

00:08:45.949 --> 00:08:48.340
might be wanting to show a slideshow so
you can say every five seconds go to the

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:48.350
you can say every five seconds go to the
 

00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:51.400
you can say every five seconds go to the
next view so you know the view flipper

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:51.410
next view so you know the view flipper
 

00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:52.810
next view so you know the view flipper
just kind of

00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:52.820
just kind of
 

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:55.060
just kind of
provides some of that nice stuff for you

00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:55.070
provides some of that nice stuff for you
 

00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:58.510
provides some of that nice stuff for you
in terms of the timing and before we

00:08:58.510 --> 00:08:58.520
in terms of the timing and before we
 

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:00.100
in terms of the timing and before we
just wrap that question up there is

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:00.110
just wrap that question up there is
 

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:01.210
just wrap that question up there is
actually something called a view

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:01.220
actually something called a view
 

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:05.580
actually something called a view
switcher as well the view switcher also

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:05.590
switcher as well the view switcher also
 

00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:09.010
switcher as well the view switcher also
has a base class of view animator the

00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:09.020
has a base class of view animator the
 

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:11.590
has a base class of view animator the
view switcher is special in that it only

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:11.600
view switcher is special in that it only
 

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:13.990
view switcher is special in that it only
supports two views whereas the view

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:14.000
supports two views whereas the view
 

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.720
supports two views whereas the view
flipper supports two or more now the

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:16.730
flipper supports two or more now the
 

00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:19.330
flipper supports two or more now the
reason you might use a view switcher is

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:19.340
reason you might use a view switcher is
 

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:21.190
reason you might use a view switcher is
literally when you're just toggling back

00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:21.200
literally when you're just toggling back
 

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.840
literally when you're just toggling back
and forth between those two views but

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:22.850
and forth between those two views but
 

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:24.490
and forth between those two views but
the view switcher also allows you to

00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:24.500
the view switcher also allows you to
 

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:27.580
the view switcher also allows you to
specify your own view factory so by

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:27.590
specify your own view factory so by
 

00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:28.810
specify your own view factory so by
doing that you can choose how you

00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:28.820
doing that you can choose how you
 

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:31.690
doing that you can choose how you
instantiate her then use a factory

00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:31.700
instantiate her then use a factory
 

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:34.780
instantiate her then use a factory
patented to implement it that way all

00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:34.790

when you add those new fragments you

00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:03.200
when you add those new fragments you
 

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:06.160
when you add those new fragments you
need to have them put into a trance

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:06.170
need to have them put into a trance
 

00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:09.370
need to have them put into a trance
so that when when you went to use I hit

00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:09.380
so that when when you went to use I hit

to the previous record yeah and there's
 

00:11:41.779 --> 00:11:44.740
to the previous record yeah and there's
also overrides that you can implement in

00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:44.750
also overrides that you can implement in
 

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:46.600

your activity to say on back button

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:46.610
your activity to say on back button
 

00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:47.889

pressed as well so if you want to

00:11:47.889 --> 00:11:47.899
pressed as well so if you want to
 

00:11:47.899 --> 00:11:50.019
pressed as well so if you want to
specialize even further just keep in

00:11:50.019 --> 00:11:50.029
specialize even further just keep in
 

00:11:50.029 --> 00:11:53.280
specialize even further just keep in
mind that that override came in to API

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:53.290

might have been a different API version

00:11:58.600 --> 00:11:58.610
might have been a different API version
 

00:11:58.610 --> 00:12:01.360
might have been a different API version
so but certainly add to back stack is

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:01.370
so but certainly add to back stack is
 

00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:03.430
so but certainly add to back stack is
there the the only other thing that will

00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:03.440
there the the only other thing that will
 

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:05.319
there the the only other thing that will
add is that we've made this a little bit

00:12:05.319 --> 00:12:05.329
add is that we've made this a little bit
 

00:12:05.329 --> 00:12:07.300
add is that we've made this a little bit
nicer in jellybean you can now specify

xml so in your layout files you can

00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:14.540
xml so in your layout files you can
 

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:16.090
xml so in your layout files you can
actually there's a there's an XML

00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:16.100
actually there's a there's an XML
 

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:18.870
actually there's a there's an XML
attribute where you can say that

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:18.880

basically what you're saying is when you
when you're on this particular element

00:12:22.449 --> 00:12:22.459
when you're on this particular element
 

00:12:22.459 --> 00:12:24.370
when you're on this particular element

00:13:02.889 --> 00:13:02.899
adt plugin so our for testing using a
 

00:13:02.899 --> 00:13:06.610
adt plugin so our for testing using a
real phone you need to enable USB

00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:06.620
real phone you need to enable USB
 

00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:08.829
real phone you need to enable USB
debugging on your phone I wonder whether

00:13:08.829 --> 00:13:08.839
debugging on your phone I wonder whether
 

00:13:08.839 --> 00:13:12.490
debugging on your phone I wonder whether
people can see this Oh No so yeah we can

00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:12.500
people can see this Oh No so yeah we can
 

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:15.329
people can see this Oh No so yeah we can
see that yeah it is under setting so um

00:13:15.329 --> 00:13:15.339
see that yeah it is under setting so um
 

00:13:15.339 --> 00:13:18.550
see that yeah it is under setting so um
there is a option called enable USB

00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:18.560
there is a option called enable USB
 

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:19.810
there is a option called enable USB
debugging so

00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:19.820
debugging so
 

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:22.440
debugging so
to enable that you just plug your phone

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:22.450
to enable that you just plug your phone
 

00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:25.450
to enable that you just plug your phone
through USB to your to your to your

00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:25.460
through USB to your to your to your
 

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:30.720
through USB to your to your to your
laptop or desktop one thing about a

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:30.730
laptop or desktop one thing about a
 

00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:33.070
laptop or desktop one thing about a
window involvement you may need to

00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:33.080
window involvement you may need to
 

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:36.490
window involvement you may need to
install a driver are you for for that

00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:36.500
install a driver are you for for that
 

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:39.160
install a driver are you for for that
and but other than that you can just use

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:39.170
and but other than that you can just use
 

00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:42.130
and but other than that you can just use

your wheel phone so cool thanks Tony
 

00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:51.780
your wheel phone so cool thanks Tony
alright the next question is from Abby

00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:51.790
alright the next question is from Abby
 

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:56.040
alright the next question is from Abby
again and I intentionally didn't cover

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:56.050
again and I intentionally didn't cover
 

00:13:56.050 --> 00:13:58.600
again and I intentionally didn't cover
in my previous answer tin cover a

00:13:58.600 --> 00:13:58.610
in my previous answer tin cover a
 

00:13:58.610 --> 00:14:00.430
in my previous answer tin cover a
particular topic because I was waiting

00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:00.440
particular topic because I was waiting
 

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:02.080
particular topic because I was waiting
for this question and it's basically

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:02.090
for this question and it's basically
 

00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:03.370
for this question and it's basically
what's the difference between the

00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:03.380
what's the difference between the
 

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:05.380
what's the difference between the
fragment pager adapter and the fragments

00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:05.390
fragment pager adapter and the fragments
 

00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:08.050
fragment pager adapter and the fragments
state pager adapter and also when should

00:14:08.050 --> 00:14:08.060
state pager adapter and also when should
 

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:12.160
state pager adapter and also when should
either of them be used so basically what

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:12.170
either of them be used so basically what
 

00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:15.150
either of them be used so basically what
it is is that the fragment pager adapter

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:15.160
it is is that the fragment pager adapter
 

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:17.560
it is is that the fragment pager adapter
when the fragments are no longer

00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:17.570
when the fragments are no longer
 

00:14:17.570 --> 00:14:19.450
when the fragments are no longer
required what it will do is relinquish

00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:19.460
required what it will do is relinquish
 

00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:21.250
required what it will do is relinquish
the view hierarchy for that for that

00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:21.260
the view hierarchy for that for that
 

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:25.570
the view hierarchy for that for that
fragment but it'll keep the fragment

00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:25.580
fragment but it'll keep the fragment
 

00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:27.880
fragment but it'll keep the fragment
around in the case of the fragment

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:27.890
around in the case of the fragment
 

00:14:27.890 --> 00:14:30.310
around in the case of the fragment
state-paid your adapter what it will do

00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:30.320
state-paid your adapter what it will do
 

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:32.020
state-paid your adapter what it will do
is actually call save state on the

00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:32.030
is actually call save state on the
 

00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:33.940
is actually call save state on the
fragment and it will release the

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:33.950
fragment and it will release the
 

00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:36.520
fragment and it will release the
fragment itself so when the frame once

00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:36.530
fragment itself so when the frame once
 

00:14:36.530 --> 00:14:39.580
fragment itself so when the frame once
again needs to be reinstated what it

00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:39.590
again needs to be reinstated what it
 

00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:41.230
again needs to be reinstated what it
will do is restore the state that it

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:41.240
will do is restore the state that it
 

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:45.570
will do is restore the state that it
that it saved earlier now that's a

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:45.580
that it saved earlier now that's a
 

00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:47.320
that it saved earlier now that's a
reasonably subtle difference but

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:47.330
reasonably subtle difference but
 

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:50.080
reasonably subtle difference but
basically what it is it's about it's a

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:50.090
basically what it is it's about it's a
 

00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:52.210
basically what it is it's about it's a
trade-off between performance versus

00:14:52.210 --> 00:14:52.220
trade-off between performance versus
 

00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:54.970
trade-off between performance versus
memory requirements memory usage sorry

00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:54.980
memory requirements memory usage sorry
 

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:57.910
memory requirements memory usage sorry
so a fragment pager adapter because it

00:14:57.910 --> 00:14:57.920
so a fragment pager adapter because it
 

00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:59.800
so a fragment pager adapter because it
only really quizzes the view hierarchy

00:14:59.800 --> 00:14:59.810
only really quizzes the view hierarchy
 

00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:02.980
only really quizzes the view hierarchy
it stays resident in your app so it's

00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:02.990
it stays resident in your app so it's
 

00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:05.320
it stays resident in your app so it's
obviously consuming more memory but it

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:05.330
obviously consuming more memory but it
 

00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:06.730
obviously consuming more memory but it
means that when that fragment is

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:06.740
means that when that fragment is
 

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:09.220
means that when that fragment is
required again it has to do less work to

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:09.230
required again it has to do less work to
 

00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:12.520
required again it has to do less work to
go and show that fragment so that's one

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:12.530
go and show that fragment so that's one
 

00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:14.260
go and show that fragment so that's one
that performs slightly better but

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:14.270
that performs slightly better but
 

00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:17.020
that performs slightly better but
because it consumes more memory it's

00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:17.030
because it consumes more memory it's
 

00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:18.640
because it consumes more memory it's
less scalable and that's where the

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:18.650
less scalable and that's where the
 

00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:20.530
less scalable and that's where the
fragment state pager adapter comes in

00:15:20.530 --> 00:15:20.540
fragment state pager adapter comes in
 

00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:22.270
fragment state pager adapter comes in
where if you have lots and lots of

00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:22.280
where if you have lots and lots of
 

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:24.250
where if you have lots and lots of
fragments you're better off using the

00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:24.260
fragments you're better off using the
 

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:26.170
fragments you're better off using the
state paid your adapter which is going

00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:26.180
state paid your adapter which is going
 

00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:27.460
state paid your adapter which is going
to be more aggressive about

00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:27.470
to be more aggressive about
 

00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:29.620
to be more aggressive about
relinquishing memory so it's a bit of a

00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:29.630
relinquishing memory so it's a bit of a
 

00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:31.960
relinquishing memory so it's a bit of a
trade-off see how many fragments you

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:31.970
trade-off see how many fragments you
 

00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:33.410
trade-off see how many fragments you
you're expecting to have in your

00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:33.420
you're expecting to have in your
 

00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:35.360
you're expecting to have in your
app I wouldn't even say that there's a

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:35.370
app I wouldn't even say that there's a
 

00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:37.970
app I wouldn't even say that there's a
magic number but have a look at it I say

00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:37.980
magic number but have a look at it I say
 

00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:39.260
magic number but have a look at it I say
if you've got more than a handful of

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:39.270
if you've got more than a handful of
 

00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:40.970
if you've got more than a handful of
fragments that you're you're you're

00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:40.980
fragments that you're you're you're
 

00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:43.700
fragments that you're you're you're
displaying and then move to the state

00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:43.710
displaying and then move to the state
 

00:15:43.710 --> 00:15:45.680
displaying and then move to the state
Patriot after otherwise try and

00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:48.050
Patriot after otherwise try and
otherwise stick with the just the pager

00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:48.060
otherwise stick with the just the pager
 

00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:53.570

com is it would start also we have

00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:40.800
com is it would start also we have
 

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:44.150
com is it would start also we have
plenty of videos on YouTube and there's

00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:44.160
plenty of videos on YouTube and there's
 

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:46.700
plenty of videos on YouTube and there's
a lot of resources around which you can

00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:46.710
a lot of resources around which you can
 

00:16:46.710 --> 00:16:49.130
a lot of resources around which you can
check up I see I think that would be a

00:16:49.130 --> 00:16:49.140
check up I see I think that would be a
 

00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:51.050
check up I see I think that would be a
good place to start that'll be our

00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:51.060
good place to start that'll be our
 

00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:54.350
good place to start that'll be our
developer site yeah adding to that I

00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:54.360
developer site yeah adding to that I
 

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:58.510
developer site yeah adding to that I
think in terms of designing enjoy style

00:16:58.510 --> 00:16:58.520
think in terms of designing enjoy style
 

00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:01.730
think in terms of designing enjoy style
avocation we have under under the carpet

00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:01.740
avocation we have under under the carpet
 

00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:04.010
avocation we have under under the carpet

really depends on your applications like

00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:17.480
really depends on your applications like
 

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:20.260
really depends on your applications like
what time of features you need for our

00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:20.270
what time of features you need for our
 

00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:24.160
what time of features you need for our
for your particular application so the

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:24.170
for your particular application so the
 

00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:26.590
for your particular application so the
strength of like native apps is you have

00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:26.600
strength of like native apps is you have
 

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:30.840
strength of like native apps is you have
a tighter integration access to our

00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:30.850
a tighter integration access to our
 

00:20:30.850 --> 00:20:35.710
a tighter integration access to our

catching up but I thing is still like
 

00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:40.420
catching up but I thing is still like
native apps can do a better job in from

00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:40.430
native apps can do a better job in from
 

00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:42.040
native apps can do a better job in from
of assessing like different sensor on

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:42.050
of assessing like different sensor on
 

00:20:42.050 --> 00:20:45.280
of assessing like different sensor on
you if that's what you what you need in

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:45.290
you if that's what you what you need in
 

00:20:45.290 --> 00:20:48.010
you if that's what you what you need in
your particular application probably are

00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:48.020
your particular application probably are
 

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:50.590
your particular application probably are
you you may want to consider more on

00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:50.600
you you may want to consider more on
 

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:55.180
you you may want to consider more on
native at the html5 application of

00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:55.190
native at the html5 application of
 

00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:57.880
native at the html5 application of
cotton the benefit is you can we use

00:20:57.880 --> 00:20:57.890
cotton the benefit is you can we use
 

00:20:57.890 --> 00:21:00.970
cotton the benefit is you can we use
what you develop already offer for your

00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:00.980
what you develop already offer for your
 

00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:04.060
what you develop already offer for your
phone for a desktop web application so

00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:04.070
phone for a desktop web application so
 

00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:08.430
phone for a desktop web application so
we can use that we use a lot of the web

00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:08.440
we can use that we use a lot of the web
 

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:11.680
we can use that we use a lot of the web
stuff you have already through webview

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:11.690
stuff you have already through webview
 

00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:15.730
stuff you have already through webview
so it I guess it really depends on your

00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:15.740
so it I guess it really depends on your
 

00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:18.190
so it I guess it really depends on your
environment what you already have and

00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:18.200
environment what you already have and
 

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:19.720
environment what you already have and
what kind of features we are planning to

00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:19.730
what kind of features we are planning to
 

00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:23.440
what kind of features we are planning to
you to add to your application yeah

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:23.450
you to add to your application yeah
 

00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:27.310
you to add to your application yeah
might just just add on that that there

00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:27.320
might just just add on that that there
 

00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:29.170
might just just add on that that there
is no one-size-fits-all so when you ask

00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:29.180
is no one-size-fits-all so when you ask
 

00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:32.830
is no one-size-fits-all so when you ask
this sort of question I I can't say that

00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:32.840
this sort of question I I can't say that
 

00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:35.290
this sort of question I I can't say that
it's very you know clear-cut that you

00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:35.300
it's very you know clear-cut that you
 

00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:37.330
it's very you know clear-cut that you
should go one way or another depends
