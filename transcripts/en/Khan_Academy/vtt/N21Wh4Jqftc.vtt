00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.812
Let's figure out
7/12 minus 6/13.

00:00:04.812 --> 00:00:06.270
And in order to be
able to do this,

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.550
we need to find a
common denominator.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.810
We notice that they're not
common right over here.

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:12.470
Here, the denominator is 12.

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:14.380
Here, it is 13.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.590
And the common
denominator is going

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.466
to be the least common
multiple of 12 and 13.

00:00:20.466 --> 00:00:24.690
And 12 and 13 share no
common factors other than 1,

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:26.440
so their least common
multiple is actually

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.856
just going to be 12 times 13.

00:00:28.856 --> 00:00:30.230
Actually, I'm just
going to leave

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.570
it written as 12 times 13.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.850
So let's first try to
rewrite this right over here.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.660
And I'll do the
denominator first.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:38.875
So 7/12.

00:00:38.875 --> 00:00:40.790
Instead of the
denominator being 12,

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.250
I'm going to write
it as 12 times 13.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.920
Well, if we multiply the
denominator by 13 in order

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.060
to not change the
value of the fraction,

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.690
we need to multiply
the numerator times 13.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.350
So notice, all I
did is I multiplied

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.740
the numerator and
the denominator

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.520
by the same number that's
equivalent to just multiplying

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.930
it by 13/13, or 1.

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.190
And so this is still
equivalent to 7/12.

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.740
Similarly-- let me do this
one in blue right over here--

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.760
the common denominator,
we want is 12 times 13.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.800
So here in the
denominator, we multiply--

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.510
let me now write
it as 13 times 12.

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.140
13 times 12.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.490
Well, if we multiply
the denominator by 12,

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.500
we have to multiply the
numerator by 12 as well.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.060
So I'll write the
numerator as 6 times 12.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.870
Notice, here we multiplied the
numerator and the denominator

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:32.912
by 13.

00:01:32.912 --> 00:01:35.120
Here, we multiplied the
numerator and the denominator

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.100
by 12.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.700
How did I know to
multiply this by 12?

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.150
Well, the common
denominator is 13 times 12.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.330
So here, I multiplied
the denominator by 12

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:45.990
so I have do the
numerator by 12.

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.210
The common denominator
here is 13 times 12.

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.900
But here, I had to multiply
it by 13 to get it,

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.250
so I have to multiply the
numerator by 13 as well.

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.430
But now we are
ready to subtract.

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:58.440
You might say, hey, Sal.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.939
Hold on.

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:00.680
Wait, what do these
actually evaluate to?

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:01.971
Well, maybe that's a good idea.

00:02:01.971 --> 00:02:03.470
Let's figure that out first .

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.310
So this is equal to 7 times 13.

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.660
Let's see, 7 times
13 is 70 plus 21.

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.960
It's 91 over 12 times 13.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.200
Let's see, I haven't
memorized my 13 times tables.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.360
So we know that 12
times 12 is 144.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.950
You put on one more
12, you get to 156.

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.240
156.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:32.270
So 91/156 is the exact
same thing as 7/12.

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.230
I just multiplied the numerator
and denominator by 13.

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:42.510
And from that we are going
to subtract 6 times 12.

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.310
6 times 12 is 72.

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.940
72 over.

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.690
Well, we already figured
out what 12 times 13 is

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.080
or what 13 times 12 is.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.800
It is 156.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.550
And now that we have
a common denominator,

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:13.440
we can rewrite this as being
equal to 91 minus 72 over 156.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.980
I'll just write that in a
neutral color, over 156.

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.910
Let's see, if it was 92
minus 72, it would be 20.

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.260
That's 1 less, so it's
going to be 19/156.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:31.200
So this is going to
be equal to 19/156.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.230
And as far as I can
tell, let's see.

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.150
19 does not go into 156.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.640
Let me just make sure of that,
that somehow, magically, 156

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.540
isn't a multiple of 19
so I could simplify this.

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.570
So let's see, 19 is almost 20.

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:50.130
So maybe, let's see
if it will go 7 times.

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.670
7 times 9 is 63.

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.570
7 times 1 is 7.

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:56.270
Plus 6 is 13.

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:57.520
Let's see the difference here.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.120
Actually, I could have
gone in one more time.

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.810
So let's do it eight times.

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.550
8 times 9 is 72.

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:07.650
8 times 1 is 8.

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.800
Plus 7 is 15.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.210
Yeah, you have a remainder here.

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:12.690
So this doesn't go evenly.

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.014
This isn't divisible by 19.

00:04:15.014 --> 00:04:16.930
And they don't share any
other common factors,

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.029
so we've simplified it
about as much as we can.

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:22.210
This is equal to 19/156.
