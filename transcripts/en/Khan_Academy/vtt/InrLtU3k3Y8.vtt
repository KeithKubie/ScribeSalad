00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.390
You may think that the
mean value theorem is just

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:07.180
this arcane theorem that
shows up in calculus classes.

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:09.100
But what we will
see in this video

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.520
is that it has actually been
used-- at least implicitly

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.930
used-- to give people
speeding tickets.

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:16.309
So let's think of an example.

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.070
So let's say that this is
a toll booth, right here.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.190
You're on the turnpike, and
this is a toll booth at point A.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:28.120
And you get your toll-- you
reach it at exactly 1:00 PM,

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.040
and then the highway's computers
and stuff register that.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.279
Let's say you have some type
of-- one of those devices

00:00:34.279 --> 00:00:36.570
so that when you pay the toll
it just knows who you are

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.050
and it registers-- it takes
your money from an account

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:39.890
someplace.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:46.120
So it sees that you got
there at exactly 1:00 PM.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.460
And then, let's say
that you get off

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.770
of the toll highway,
the turnpike.

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.990
Let's say you get
off of it at point B,

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.040
and you get there
exactly 2:00 PM.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.290
I'm making these numbers
very easy to work with.

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.810
And let's say that they
are 80 miles apart.

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.255
So this distance right
over here is 80 miles.

00:01:09.524 --> 00:01:10.940
And let's say that
the speed limit

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.100
on this stretch of highway
is 55 miles per hour.

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.090
So the question is,
can the authorities

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.070
prove that you went
over the speed limit?

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.510
Well, let's just graph this.

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.780
I think you know
where this is going.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.040
So let's graph it.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.630
So let's say this right
over here is our position.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.670
So I'll call that the
s-axis, s for position.

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.480
And that's going to be in miles.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.280
And s is, obviously, s doesn't
really stand for position.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.360
But p, you know, it kind of
looks like rho for density.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.840
And d we use for differentials
for distance or displacement.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.440
So s is what gets used
for position very often.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.670
So let's say s is our position.

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.740
And let's see,
this is t for time.

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.110
And let's say this is in hours.

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.040
And let's see, we care
about the interval

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:22.560
from time going from
time 1 to time 2.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.730
I'm not really drawing the
axes completely at scale.

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.160
Would you let me just assume
that there's a gap here

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.190
just because I
don't actually want

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.301
to make you think that I'm
drawing it completely at scale.

00:02:37.301 --> 00:02:39.800
Because I really want to focus
on this part of the interval.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.210
So this is time
equals to 2 hours.

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:48.375
And so at time equal 1,
you're right over here.

00:02:48.375 --> 00:02:53.670
And let's say this position is,
we'll just call that s of 1.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:59.885
And at time 2, you're at this
position right over here.

00:02:59.885 --> 00:03:02.200
You're right over there.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.860
And so your position is s of 2.

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.460
You're at that coordinate
right over there.

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.739
And that's all we know.

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:12.530
That's all we know.

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:13.905
Well, we know a
few other things.

00:03:13.905 --> 00:03:17.310
We know what our change in
time is, it's 2 minus 1.

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.570
And we know what our
change in position is.

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:24.760
We know that our
change in position,

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:35.000
which is equal to s of 2 minus
s of 1, is equal to 80 miles.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.725
The change in
position is 80 miles.

00:03:37.725 --> 00:03:39.850
So let me write that, and
we'll just for simplicity

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:41.224
assume it was a
straight highway.

00:03:41.224 --> 00:03:43.640
So our change in distance
is the same as our change

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.260
in position, same as
change in displacement.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.905
So this is 80 miles.

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:54.000
And then what is
our change in time?

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.825
Over our change in time, well
that's going to be 2 minus 1.

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.115
Which is just
going to be 1 hour.

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.000
Or we could say that the
slope of the line that

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.650
connects these two
points-- let me

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.670
do that in another color--
that's the same color--

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:24.180
the slope of this line right
over here is 80 miles per hour.

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:30.900
Slope is equal to
80 miles per hour.

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.810
Or you could say that your
average velocity over that hour

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.710
was 80 miles per hour.

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.180
And what the authorities
could do in a court of law,

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.270
and I've never heard
a mathematical theorem

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:43.620
cited like this, but they could.

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.170
And I remember reading about
this about 10 years ago,

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:47.540
and it was very controversial.

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:50.000
The authorities said
look, over this interval,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.360
your average velocity was
clearly 80 miles per hour.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.760
So at some point in that hour--
and they could have cited,

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.500
they could have said by
the mean value theorem--

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.120
at some point in
that hour, you must

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.210
have been going at exactly
80 miles, at least,

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.887
frankly, 80 miles per hour.

00:05:07.887 --> 00:05:09.720
And it would have been
very hard to disprove

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.200
because your position
as a function of time

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.640
is definitely continuous
and differentiable

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:16.890
over that interval.

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:18.920
It's continuous,
you're not just getting

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.630
teleported from one
place to another.

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:22.520
That would be a
pretty amazing car.

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:23.770
And it is also differentiable.

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.500
You always have a
well defined velocity.

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.790
And so I challenge anyone.

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:30.550
Try to connect these
two points with

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:33.530
a continuous and differentiable
curve, where at some point

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:37.080
the instantaneous velocity,
the slope of the tangent line,

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.050
is not the same thing as
the slope of this line.

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:41.370
It's impossible.

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.730
The mean value theorem
tells us it's impossible.

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:45.030
So let me just draw.

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:46.050
So we could imagine.

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:50.670
Say I had to stop to
pay, to kind of register

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:52.880
where I am on the
highway, then I

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.460
start to accelerate
a little bit.

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:57.452
So right now, my
instantaneous velocity

00:05:57.452 --> 00:05:59.510
is less than my
average velocity.

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:00.840
I'm accelerating.

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.550
The slope of the tangent line.

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:05.710
But if I want to get
there at that time,

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:08.310
and especially because I have
to slow down as I approach it,

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:09.904
as I approach the tollbooth.

00:06:09.904 --> 00:06:12.320
The only way I could connect
these two things-- well let's

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.695
see, I'm going to have to--
at some point, at this point,

00:06:14.695 --> 00:06:17.360
I'm actually going faster
than the 80 miles per hour.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.710
And the mean value theorem
just tells us, that look,

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:22.130
that this function is
continuous and differentiable

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:23.010
over this interval.

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:24.850
Continuous over the
closed interval.

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:26.580
Differentiable over
the open interval.

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:29.420
That there's at least one point
in the open interval, which

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:33.070
it calls c, so there's
at least one point where

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:34.810
your instantaneous
rate of change, where

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:36.550
the slope of the
tangent line, is

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:39.260
the same as the slope
as the secant line.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.726
So that point right
over there, that point

00:06:41.726 --> 00:06:43.100
looks like that
right over there.

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:45.760
And so if this is time c,
that looks like it's like

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:49.370
at around 1:15, this-- the
mean value theorem says

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:54.610
that at some point, there
exists some time where

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:59.920
s prime of c is equal to
this average velocity,

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.356
is equal to 80 miles per hour.

00:07:02.356 --> 00:07:04.230
And it doesn't look like
that's the only one.

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:05.700
It looks like this
one over here,

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:10.856
this could also be
a candidate for c.
