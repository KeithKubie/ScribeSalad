00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.700
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:19.950
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Hello.

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:21.250
My name is Stephen Winick
and we're here at the Library

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.420
of Congress where we will
be interviewing Billy Bragg.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.900
I should also introduce
my co-interviewer.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.890
This is Mary Sue Twohy
of SiriusXM Radio.

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.190
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Thank you.

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:32.490
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
So, Billy you're here

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.340
because you have written a book
about skiffle and so we're going

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.780
to talk a bit about
folk music and skiffle

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.190
and their interrelations.

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.190
So, I'm going to start
out by, by mentioning

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:43.490
that I'm pretty sure that back

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.800
in the 80s I saw you perform
some traditional songs

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.630
in your sets way back then.

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.660
So, when did you first become
aware of traditional song

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.500
and did you always
incorporate them

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.800
into your gigs a little bit?

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.100
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Well,
I became aware

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.400
of a traditional
song [inaudible].

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.660
I was really into Simon and
Garfunkel when I was like 12

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.820
or 13 and they kind
of introduced me

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.130
to "Scarborough Fair" which
is an English folksong;

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:08.430
two guys from Brooklyn.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.730
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:11.940
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: We're going to
get a lot of that stuff I think,

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.650
um and that kind of led
me to sort of dealing

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.740
with other American
singer-songwriters,

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.150
but I was always aware that
they had drawn some inspiration

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.750
from British folk music.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.280
In 1973 or 4, our local
library had a record section

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.910
and it was predominantly
classical music,

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:36.750
but they had a lot of album
samplers from the Topic label.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.670
Topic it was just a
great British folk label

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.240
from the 1930s.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.790
It was originally the
Communist Party record label.

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.350
It was a worker's record label

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.860
and what they did was
they anthologized folks

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.500
from a surrounded theme, so
they would have war, work,

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.240
the sea you know, and I sort of
avidly listened to these songs

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.240
and so that introduced
me to people like Shirley

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.600
and Dolly Collins, The
Watersons, Bert Lloyd

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.520
and so I kind of then had a
sort of knowledge of folk music,

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.270
but when punk happened
in 1977 being year zero.

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.570
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:14.870
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: All that
kind of went out the window

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.970
until in 1984 when the
coalminers were on strike

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.380
for a year, because I was a sort
of performer, I was able to go

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.640
into the coal fields
and do gigs.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.870
On the very first shows
that I did up in Sunderland,

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.050
there was an old guy named
Jock Purdon an old miner,

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.350
retired miner who soundstage,
who was opening for me,

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.930
soundstages hand cupped over
his ear and his songs were

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.870
so much more radical than mine

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.340
and I felt a bit embarrassed
really, because I'm supposed,

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.970
you know, I'm the little
punk rocker and everything,

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.270
you know, come up here.

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:47.570
And I felt really embarrassed
about it and he was so kind

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.570
to me, because what he said
explicitly to me was that,

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:52.870
you know, whatever
my relationship

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.410
to this material now that I've
done a gig for the miners,

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.510
I was part of this tradition and
that's the way it's always been.

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:00.960
I mean, you know, since
then I've always thought

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.780
of myself I'm not of the
tradition clearly, but I am part

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.510
of it and I, I kind of went back
to those records that I knew

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.910
and those songs I remembered and
started to bring that influence

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.490
into my own songwriting.

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.030
The first example of that
would be "Between the Wars",

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.940
and that kind of became the
defining, the song got me

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.510
in the charts right
on top of the pops,

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.420
so it was the miner's strike
really that reconnected me

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:25.720
with my own traditional music.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.020
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:28.320
That's great.

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.620
Although, I should say
many people noticed

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:30.920
that the beginning of

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.880
"A New England" sounds
suspiciously like Paul Simon.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.290
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Well, I may
have borrowed those two lines,

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.620
but in my defense, I
started writing that song

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.600
when I was 21 years old
and then I came back

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.420
to it when I was 22, so.

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:43.720
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
So, it defines.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.020
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: At the
time, it made a lot of sense

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:46.750
and also I didn't realize
that Kirsty MacColl was going

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.370
to have a top ten hit with
it and make it famous.

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.480
I just thought it would be
some obscure little song

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.250
that I played at parties,
so that's my defense,

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.450
and [inaudible] harmonies
too, he spoke to me about that

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.460
and he was pretty cool with
it, so I think I got away it.

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:00.760
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Great.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.100
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: So, as you
referenced you're involvement

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.450
with punk, how did you
actually get started in punk?

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:07.980
How did that leap happen?

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:14.650
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Well, in the
summer of 1977, I might be,

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:15.950
it must have been
earlier than that,

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.480
it must have been summer
1976; the summer of 1976,

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.220
there was something
going on the UK, yeah,

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.130
there was a band called
Dr. Feelgood who were kind

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.970
of playing sort of
maximum R and B

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.190
and had a lead guitar player
called Wilko Johnson who looked

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.370
like the sort of
kid at my school

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:34.670
that would get beat
up all the time.

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:36.200
You know, he had sort
of a weird haircut

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.810
and he had his top bandana up,

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.530
but he was cool,
somehow he was cool.

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:43.270
How is this geeky looking
bloke incredibly cool?

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.620
And in some way it was like
a, it was like a precursor

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.630
of punk rock, because
within 12 months lots

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:53.520
of unprepossessing blokes like
Elvis Costello, and Ian Dury

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.570
and Johnny Rotten, and Joe
Strummer were suddenly cool.

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.050
So, there was hope
for all of us.

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.070
And what happened was
that summer I was playing

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:05.350
in a little band with my mates
in our parent's backrooms

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.260
and we went out and bought
the first Who record,

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.870
the first Stones record, and
the first Small Faces record

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.260
and we kind of getting, sort
of trying to aim for that sort

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.650
of sound and then we heard
The Jam who were kind of right

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.290
in that nexus but they were our
age which just blew our minds.

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:22.030
So, we went to see The Jam play

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.410
in a little pub called
Nashville Rooms

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:29.050
and in shows the Rainbows a
sort of prime London rock place

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:30.520
where we've been to see,

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.140
we'd seen the Small Faces
there the year before;

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.090
the Small Faces revival, but
they were playing with The Clash

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:37.070
and we went along to that
gig really extensively

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.650
to see The Jam, but The
Clash just blew us away

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.060
because they were,
they were our age.

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:43.360
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Yeah.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.730
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: And they were
doing all the things we liked

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:46.800
about the Stones, and the
Small Faces, and The Who,

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.270
so it kind of a catalytic
moment.

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:52.680
We had been to see the
Stones and The Who that year

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.350
and the Stones were I'll just
call, it was this massive array

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:59.030
and it was the first proper
arena show in the UK and The

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:00.790
Who played at a giant
football club.

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:04.490
It was like, you know, they were
miles away and here was The Jam

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:07.130
and The Clash not only
physically close to us,

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:09.100
but close to us culturally
as well

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:10.440
and I think that was a catalyst.

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:13.590
You know, I went home and gave
away all of my Eagles albums,

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:14.890
cut my hair, and bought a pair

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:16.190
of plastic trousers
[brief laughter].

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:17.490
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: That simple.

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:19.530
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Yeah, it didn't
really change my songwriting

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:20.870
much, but it was

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:22.680
that straightforward
in those days, yeah.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.210
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: So, it was
the miner's strike that got you

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:27.370
to do political songs
though specifically?

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:28.670
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: No.

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:29.970
Well, I think I was
doing political songs.

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:31.270
I think punk was
quite political.

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:32.570
The political side of punk
I had always been into.

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:35.790
The first political activism
I was a part in was this Rock

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:37.400
Against Racism and
that was in 78.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.260
So, I was clearly at a kind

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.580
of what you might call
personal politics I suppose.

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:43.800
What's significant about
the miner's strike that got

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:47.340
to my songwriting is it turns me
into an ideological songwriter,

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:50.410
because at the same time this
miner strike happens in 1984,

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:51.780
I come to America
for the first time.

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:55.150
Now, in the UK people had seen
me on my own playing guitar.

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:57.170
They call me a one man
clash and, you know,

00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:00.080
in American people compared
me to Woody Guthrie.

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.380
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:02.680
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Woody
Guthrie I knew.

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:03.980
Woody Guthrie was, of
course, a big [inaudible] fan,

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:06.240
but it was very difficult
to find Woody's records

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:10.090
in where I lived anyway
in London in the 70s.

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:12.380
Eventually, to just to
hear what he sounded

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:16.290
like I eventually managed
to track down a cassette

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:19.040
on the Disk du Monde [phonetic];
the French Disk du Monde,

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:23.320
well they even spelled
his name wrong.

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:26.210
On the cover the spelled his
name with "ie" Woodie with an

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:28.430
"ie", and there was no
details just a track.

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:32.420
So, and I can remember playing
it and it sounded so primal

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:34.820
that I thought I can't
do this, this is awful.

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:36.120
This is before punk.

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:37.420
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:38.720
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: So, when I
came to the United States

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:41.570
of America was; one of the most
amazing things about coming

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:43.410
to the United States of
America was record shops,

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:45.930
because there's so much great
music that you don't get

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:47.300
in English record
shops and, of course,

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:48.620
there were Woody's records.

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:51.630
So, I was able to now
buy Woody's records

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:54.320
and buy perhaps the greatest
of all of his records

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:56.310
which is the Library of
Congress recordings they did

00:07:56.310 --> 00:08:00.930
for Alan Lomax in I
think 1941 I think;

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:04.410
that really where Woody's just
sitting there talking weirdly

00:08:04.410 --> 00:08:05.710
similar to what we're
doing now Stephen.

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:07.010
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:08.310
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: It's
just occurred to me.

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:09.610
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:10.910
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: It's
a bit strange.

00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:12.210
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:13.510
Well, some of, some of that was
done in this suite of rooms.

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:14.810
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Yes.

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:16.110
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
Although, some of it was done

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:17.410
in a different building.

00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:18.710
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Yeah, yeah
I mean that's, that's just.

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:20.010
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:21.310
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Wow.

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:22.610
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: That
just occurred

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:23.910
to me there for a second.

00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:25.210
So, but yeah that, that those
recordings really helped me

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:26.510
to understand Woody, but also
I also came across "Joe Hill."

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:27.810
I had never across this,
I didn't know anything

00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:29.110
about Joan whatsoever

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:31.020
and I think I bought
Utah Phillips' album,

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:33.620
"You Have Fed Us; We Have Fed
You All For A Thousand Years."

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:34.920
What a great record that is.

00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:36.220
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:38.360
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: And I think that
has "There Is Power in a Union"

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:41.840
on it, and I took that home
and in the midst of the strike,

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:47.130
I needed to write a union song
and I was familiar with the song

00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:49.240
of the Americas "Rally
'Round the Flag"

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:53.320
which Ry Cooder had recorded
for the "Long Riders" soundtrack

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:55.140
and I sort of borrowed
the tune from that.

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:56.440
The chorus of that song is

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:58.720
"the union forever,
hurrah, boys hurrah."

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:03.940
So, I borrowed that tune; I
borrowed Joe Hill's title "Power

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:06.630
In A Union" and I wrote a
new set of lyrics for that,

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:09.600
so and was elated, I was very
happy to find subsequently

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:12.190
that the tune for "Rally
'Round the Flag" was stolen

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:13.490
from an English hymn.

00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:15.290
So once again, what goes
around comes around.

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:16.590
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Exactly.

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:17.890
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:19.190
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: We're
going to say that a lot

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:20.490
in this conversation I feel.

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:21.790
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:23.090
I guess another example of that
is that, is that much later

00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:25.820
in your career you were
approached by Nora Guthrie

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:29.540
and the Guthrie family to
write music to Woody's lyrics,

00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:30.890
so how did that come about?

00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:33.150
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Well, that
came about I was doing a gig

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:38.750
in Central Park for Woody's
90th birthday with Pete Seeger

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:41.660
and Arlo, and the Disposable
Heroes of Hyphoprisy."

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:45.310
I had had a few run-ins with
the Guthrie legend before.

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:49.320
One of the most daunting
moments that I ever faced

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:52.250
as a performer was at the
Vancouver Folk Festival in 1987

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:55.030
where I had been asked
if I would be interested

00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:57.100
to do a Woody Guthrie
workshop, you know,

00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:00.430
a workshop is a workshop you
know where 3 or 4 artists sit

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:03.130
around and are taking turns to
play songs and there's a theme.

00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:05.560
And I thought, you know,
you have to play 3 songs,

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:06.900
so I thought I know
3 Woody songs

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:08.200
and hard can that be, you know?

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:10.670
I didn't think any more
about it until the day.

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:15.400
And when I got there, the other
3 participants were Pete Seeger,

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:18.910
Arlo Guthrie, and
Ramblin' Jack Elliott.

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:20.210
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Uh-oh.

00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:22.390
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Yeah, I suddenly
though I am so busted here.

00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:24.910
If any of these played
the 3 songs on our office,

00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:27.550
but Jack who sat next to
me on top of his guitar,

00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:31.560
on top of the body of his guitar
he had a bit of papers taped

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:33.440
on it with loads of Woody
titles which I suppose was

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:35.330
like having a memoire for him.

00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:36.940
So, I was looking at them,
"Oh yeah, I know that one",

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:38.580
you know, because you
know them most distinctly

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:40.530
because you've listened to all
of those, "Oh, yeah, yeah."

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:41.860
So, I kind of got away with it.

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:45.050
I got away with it until old
mad Seeger stood up at the end

00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:48.340
like a sort of tall
redwood tree and began

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:50.440
in his beautiful clear
tone began singing

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:53.310
"This Land is Your Land"
and then he threw it to Arlo

00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:55.690
for the next verse and I thought
uh-oh and then he threw it

00:10:55.690 --> 00:10:58.430
to Jack, it's getting closer
to me and I'm like this is it,

00:10:58.430 --> 00:11:00.400
so I just had to say
look I'm really sorry

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:01.700
that we don't sing
this in England,

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:04.670
this land ain't my land
clearly and I apologized.

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:11.070
And I think Nora took pity on
me and by inviting me to come

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:13.030
and look at the songs
in the archives she kind

00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:14.330
of brought me into the family.

00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:15.770
It was a really amazing
experience,

00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:18.240
because not only was Nora
there with the archivists,

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:21.990
with at the time
2000 complete lyrics

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:23.970
that Woody had written as songs.

00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:27.530
The only reason nobody had
played them was because,

00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:31.310
like myself, Woody didn't
write musical notation.

00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:32.610
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:33.910
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: When
he writes to sing;

00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:35.210
if I write a song what you get
is a piece of paper with words

00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:38.260
on it, the words they rhyme and
they have a meaning to them,

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:40.490
you know, but you, there's
no hint of what the tune is

00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:41.790
because I've got here.

00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:43.670
It's easy to me, because I
always record it on my computer.

00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:46.610
So, you know, but for Woody
he only actually recorded 10%

00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:48.020
of the songs he wrote.

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:51.840
So, all of these songs were
languishing in files waiting

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:55.060
to be brought back to life,
and Nora's genius idea was

00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:57.330
to bring some people
in to do that.

00:11:57.330 --> 00:11:58.630
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Yeah.

00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:01.110
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: But it wasn't
just Nora, because also

00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:06.360
in the office was, was a Woody's
old manager Harold Leventhal.

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:07.660
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:08.960
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: And the
thing about Harold was

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:11.250
because he was there, if I found
a lyric referring to something

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:13.160
that happened in the 30s,
I can go in to see Harold

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.550
and he could explain to
me what the context was.

00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:16.850
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Oh.

00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:18.270
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: You know, I
found a song about Hanns Eisler

00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:20.440
who was the guy who wrote the
East German National Anthem;

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:21.740
that's all I know.

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:23.040
And I'm like, why is
Woody writing a song

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:24.340
about Hanns Eisler?

00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:25.640
So, I go in to see Harold

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:27.730
and he tells me this
incredible story verse,

00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:30.740
each of the verses
there's another note

00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:34.390
of Eisler's brother
was the Comintern agent

00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:37.170
in Hollywood in the 1940s.

00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:40.270
and their sister betrayed them

00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:42.140
to the House Un-American
Activities Committee

00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:48.590
and another character was
Dixiecrat senator who was,

00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:54.170
you know, pushing this kind of
what man had really pugrum on,

00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:56.650
you know, Jewish-American
intellectuals.

00:12:56.650 --> 00:12:59.630
I mean, the whole thing
just came out of Harold

00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:03.370
and this song, it was just an
incredible, incredible privilege

00:13:03.370 --> 00:13:05.440
to sit and talk to him
and all he ever asked me

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:08.420
to do was whenever I came
he asked to bring him a copy

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:11.260
of the British Communist
newspaper The Morning Star.

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:12.560
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Wow.

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:13.980
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Now I don't
know if he was like testing me

00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:15.950
or anything, but and it
wasn't easy to find either.

00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:18.690
You can't find it everywhere
only particular shops,

00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:20.970
but I always tried
to find a copy of it

00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:22.500
and he would always
ask me about, you know,

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:23.800
what's happening with
the Communist Party,

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:26.320
"I'm not that, Harold
it's like."

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:30.080
It's [inaudible], but he was
an amazing, amazing character.

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:34.740
He was the cofounder of
the Newport Folk Festival

00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:39.670
and he had a huge, huge
history and he had been a,

00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:42.630
he'd been a song-plugger
for Irving Berlin.

00:13:42.630 --> 00:13:43.930
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:45.230
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: There's a
picture on the wall behind him

00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:49.460
of him with like a 19-year-old
Frank Sinatra in the 1940s.

00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:51.720
The skinniest Frank Sinatra
you have ever seen in this suit

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:54.700
that like was drowning him
and so Harold was like a,

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:57.630
was one of the, he was just
a, it was a real privilege

00:13:57.630 --> 00:13:59.860
to have sat and talked to
him and listen to him talk;

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:01.930
amazing guy, amazing guy.

00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:04.190
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: So,
you spoke of Pete Seeger

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:09.070
and when we saw you at the
Folk Alliance International

00:14:09.070 --> 00:14:13.530
Conference in Kansas City,
you referenced Pete Seeger.

00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:16.110
What is your relationship
with him?

00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:18.070
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Well, I
think Pete is the person

00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:21.900
who really first probably
connected me to Woody, you know.

00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:23.200
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Nice.

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:24.500
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: He, he,
I first encountered him

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:25.800
in East Germany actually

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:29.170
at a political folk song
festival there in 1987.

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:30.470
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Wow.

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:33.000
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: A peace
concert and he was, you know,

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.300
he was aware of who I was.

00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:36.690
I'm not sure he knew much
of my material, but again,

00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:40.190
he was someone else who
always encouraged me

00:14:40.190 --> 00:14:41.950
to write political songs.

00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:48.150
At another folk festival
in Vancouver in 89,

00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:50.290
just after Tiananmen
Square had happened,

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:55.130
I was in the artist's chow tent
and uncle Pete came and sat down

00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:56.430
and said, "Listen I want,

00:14:56.430 --> 00:15:00.470
I'm going to finish my set
tomorrow night on the mainstage

00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:03.640
by singing "The Internationale"
to Ireland in respect

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:05.580
to the students who
had been singing it

00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:08.770
in the Tiananmen Square, and he
said and Bruce Cockburn is going

00:15:08.770 --> 00:15:11.660
to come sing the Canadian
version, someone is going

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:14.120
to come sing the Mexican
version, I'd like you to come

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:16.220
and sing the British
version Billy."

00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:18.570
I was like "Oh, Pete
give me a break mate."

00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:21.420
The lyrics, the lyrics
are "Arise, ye starvelings

00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:24.920
from your slumbers/arise you
criminals of want/for reason

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:28.200
and revolt now thunders/and
here ends the age of can't."

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:31.370
I said, "Pete, it doesn't
even rhyme", you know.

00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:37.210
So, he said "Well, maybe you
should just write a new verse."

00:15:37.210 --> 00:15:39.310
And in folk music there's
some people you can't tell

00:15:39.310 --> 00:15:42.600
to "piss off" and uncle
Pete is one of them.

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:45.610
So, before I had even had a
chance to say [inaudible] Pete,

00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:47.620
rewrite "The Internationale"
he found a flier,

00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:49.440
there actually was a
flier by a demonstration

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:50.750
in [inaudible] Square.

00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:54.350
He got a pencil and he closed
his eyes and he began singing

00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:57.230
under his breath the
original French lyrics;

00:15:57.230 --> 00:16:00.060
"C'est la lutte finale"
and he would write

00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:03.080
down verbatim the first verse
and chorus, said "There you go.

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:05.600
You got 24 hours."

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:07.480
Like I said, you can't
really say it's like humbug

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:08.780
from a professor sulk.

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:11.130
I wrote a verse and a chorus
and I came back and I sang it

00:16:11.130 --> 00:16:14.330
and it was all good, and
then the Berlin Wall had come

00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:17.570
down the same year and,
and all of our sort

00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:21.900
of leftwing culture was
being put in the a skip

00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:23.280
out in the back, everything.

00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:25.760
Not just the bad stuff
that guiding it was stuff

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:28.810
that was tarnished
with totalitarianism,

00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:30.650
but the good stuff was
kind of skip as well.

00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:34.180
So I thought well maybe
I should write, you know,

00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:35.830
rewrite "The Internationale"
and record it.

00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:37.130
Maybe that's what, so I--

00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:39.350
I wrote small verses and I
sent them to Pete and I went

00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:43.610
to see Ewan MacColl and Peggy
and sort of said something

00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:45.150
"I've written these
versus what do you think?"

00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:48.670
And I recorded and put it out
on an album in 1990 and now

00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:52.010
if you get the IWW little
red songbook, my version is

00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:53.550
in there next to the original.

00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:54.850
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Right on.

00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:56.150
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Isn't
that incredible?

00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:57.450
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
That's amazing.

00:16:57.450 --> 00:16:58.750
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: That's great.

00:16:58.750 --> 00:17:00.050
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: It's uncle Pete.

00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:01.350
That's Pete.

00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:02.650
You can't say no to Pete Seeger.

00:17:02.650 --> 00:17:03.950
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: So, as I
mentioned one of the reasons

00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:05.830
that we're interviewing
you is your book on skiffle

00:17:05.830 --> 00:17:09.440
and you talked before the
interview about how skiffle kind

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:11.150
of throws the American
audience people

00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:13.490
and this country don't
really know what skiffle is.

00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:14.890
So, give us a little
introduction.

00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:19.230
What is skiffle and what led
you to become interested in it?

00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:22.340
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Well, the 140
characters answer that question,

00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:25.580
is skiffle is basically
American, a British school boys

00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:29.180
in the 1950s playing Lead
Belly songs basically.

00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:30.480
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Alright.

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:32.080
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: What
it represents,

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:34.780
it represents the
introduction of the guitar

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:38.560
into British pop
culture and it's among

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:43.820
when our pop music goes from
being a jazz-based confection

00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:46.810
for grownups in which anyone
who's not a grownup is offered

00:17:46.810 --> 00:17:49.730
novelty songs like "How Much
is That Doggy in the Window?"

00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:54.470
It changes from that to being a
guitar led music for teenagers,

00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:57.120
and skiffle, the catalyst

00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:59.980
for this is a guy named Lonnie
Donegan who has a hit in 1956

00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:02.650
with a version of Lead
Belly's "Rock Island Line."

00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:07.350
Now, Donegan is the banjo
player in a trad jazz band,

00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:11.170
the Chris Barber Jazz Band and
he records "Rock Island Line"

00:18:11.170 --> 00:18:17.500
for a trad jazz album called
"New Orleans Joy" in July 1954

00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:23.280
and skiffle emerges
from trad jazz

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:26.830
because the British trad
guys who are interested

00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:28.130
in playing New Orleans;

00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:30.040
trad jazz means jazz
from New Orleans.

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:35.410
Predominantly that
was made before 1915.

00:18:35.410 --> 00:18:40.180
What's significant in 1958 is
when bands started going north

00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:42.980
and recording, you know, the
original Dixieland jazz bands

00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:46.330
and these groups;
start recording jazz

00:18:46.330 --> 00:18:48.050
and the thing starts
moving forward.

00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:51.230
New Orleans jazz
has no soloists.

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:52.530
It's a collective effort.

00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:54.950
Everyone plays around the
rhythm and around the turn.

00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:59.140
So someone like Louis Armstrong
playing solos that's a different

00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:02.560
topic of jazz as far as
the purists are concerned.

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:08.620
And but the British trad
jazz fans, they were unable

00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:10.260
to find anyone to teach
them play this stuff

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:11.560
so they only had the records

00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:12.860
that were made predominantly
made

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:16.450
in the 1920s; 20s recordings.

00:19:16.450 --> 00:19:18.330
And because of the
primitive nature

00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:22.030
of the recording
equipment, the musicians had

00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:24.330
to blow really hard to be heard

00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:26.440
which is partly the reason
why jazz has that pep,

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:27.740
they used to call pep to it.

00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:30.320
You know, it's kind of
like they're blasting out.

00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:33.410
So, the British guys
didn't have much technique,

00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:37.720
so they just blew like Billy
goats on their instruments,

00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:40.310
and as a result after 30
minutes their lips were

00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:41.850
so numb they couldn't
play anymore.

00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:44.470
So, in order not to
lose their audience,

00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:48.060
they would pick-up acoustic
guitars, a washboard for rhythm,

00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:50.590
and use the drum base
from the jazz band

00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:53.320
and they would play broadly
Lead Belly's repertoire,

00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:57.860
and Lead Belly is significant
because, steady now,

00:19:57.860 --> 00:20:01.200
he's the greatest folk singer
that America ever produced both

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:04.020
as a writer of songs,
an interpret of songs,

00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:05.320
and a collector of songs.

00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:06.920
And I was arguable to
say that in his place

00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:08.510
and on your show, but.

00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:09.810
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: We
can go along with that.

00:20:09.810 --> 00:20:11.110
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: As an
outsider I think, you know,

00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:14.060
you got to remember as far
as Woody was concerned,

00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:17.340
Lead Belly was to him
as Woody was to Bob.

00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:20.310
You know, he was physically
a giant, but also I think

00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:23.560
in American culture
he's a giant as well.

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:24.860
He's the folk Shakespeare.

00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:27.530
He's that, you know, that
guy that always wanted to,

00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:31.320
because you know Woody was a
genius too, but Woody read,

00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:34.160
he wrote, he typed
you know, he could,

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:36.040
he had a decent education
than Lead Belly.

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:38.660
Lead Belly just had
made himself,

00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:42.610
he had made himself you know
and you can hear in the music.

00:20:42.610 --> 00:20:45.830
So, so Lead Belly's vast
repertoire which includes,

00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:48.430
I mean, I read somewhere
about Lead Belly

00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:50.340
and Blind Lemon Jefferson
playing a song called

00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:53.840
"Seven Drunken Nights"
which is an old [inaudible]

00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:55.610
drinking song.

00:20:55.610 --> 00:20:58.270
Where they got it from I have no
idea, but if they were playing

00:20:58.270 --> 00:21:00.910
that and "Rock Island
Line", you know,

00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:02.210
that's a pretty broad scope.

00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:08.510
So, the jazzes decided to play
these Lead Belly songs partly

00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:13.300
because they believed that the
blues predated traditional jazz,

00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:14.920
which I don't think
is actually true.

00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:19.700
The 12-bar performers as we know
it I think postdates trad jazz,

00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:21.830
but I think it was because
the trad jazzes used,

00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:23.890
in New Orleans used
the phrase "blues."

00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:25.190
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:26.910
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: When they made
an informal jam and I think

00:21:26.910 --> 00:21:28.560
that slightly confused
them, anyway,

00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:33.530
so they started playing these
what they called a breakdown

00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:37.230
session; breakdown session with
the acoustic guitars and stuff

00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:38.890
and that became really popular.

00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:41.160
In some cases in some events
it became more popular

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:45.080
than the trad jazz itself,
particularly with teenagers,

00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:48.270
because teenagers wanted to
jive and they couldn't do

00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:50.840
that in a ballroom in the
UK because ballroom dancing,

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:53.750
I don't know if it's true in
the United States of America,

00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:56.800
but in the UK ballroom
dancing is processional.

00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:00.440
It kind of, the dancers you know
go in a huge sweeping circle.

00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:03.100
Whereas, jiving is more stag,
right, they move back and forth

00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:05.470
but they don't move
around procession.

00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:06.970
So, if you got kids jiving

00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:09.930
and adults ballroom
dancing you're going to get,

00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:12.620
you're going to get a
traffic jam, a snarl up.

00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:14.840
So, jiving was banned.

00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:17.320
So, these kids went to these
trad jazz gigs and they kind

00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:19.640
of jived and then along
comes Lonnie Donegan

00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:22.390
and he's giving it loads with
"Rock Island Line" and it's,

00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:25.800
it's you know, it's up
tempo enough to engage them.

00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:28.860
So, so it become
really, really popular.

00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:30.160
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy:
Can you expand

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:31.680
on "Rock Island Line" the song?

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:33.250
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Yeah,
of course, yeah.

00:22:33.250 --> 00:22:36.250
The song "Rock Island
Line" begins its life

00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:41.020
as a glee club song for the
Rock Island Line Railway written

00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:43.870
by engineers in the Biddle Shops

00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:46.070
which is the engineering
workshops in the suburbs

00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:48.660
of Little Rock, Arkansas.

00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:50.920
And they were encouraged by the,

00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:53.810
they're African-American
workers, they were encouraged

00:22:53.810 --> 00:22:59.930
by the company to form a vocal
group and to go to public events

00:22:59.930 --> 00:23:04.270
like picnics or to
meetings or church, socials

00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:07.060
and sing the praises of
the "Rock Island Line."

00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:12.200
And there are quite a few
songs about Rock Island.

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:16.670
The, there's one that, the
original tune to, I'm not going

00:23:16.670 --> 00:23:19.000
to be able to remember
the name of it now,

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.300
the one of the great American;

00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:23.720
one of the early great American
railroad songs about the train

00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:26.630
that takes the hobos to heaven.

00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:27.930
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:29.230
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Help me out here

00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:30.530
and I'll think of
it in a minute.

00:23:30.530 --> 00:23:31.830
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:33.130
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: It was original,

00:23:33.130 --> 00:23:34.430
but tune of that was
originally "Wabash Cannonball."

00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:35.730
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Yes.

00:23:35.730 --> 00:23:37.030
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:38.330
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: "Wabash
Cannonball" was originally the

00:23:38.330 --> 00:23:39.630
tune that was originally

00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:40.930
about the great Rock Island
route that was [inaudible].

00:23:40.930 --> 00:23:42.230
So, you know, it's not a
one-off, it's something

00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:43.530
that was going on from in
the golden age of railway.

00:23:43.530 --> 00:23:44.970
That's how they promoted
the railways.

00:23:44.970 --> 00:23:48.880
But we first come
across it outside those

00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:52.050
of us outside Arkansas
when it's recorded

00:23:52.050 --> 00:23:54.730
by John A. Lomax accompanied
by Lead Belly who is kind

00:23:54.730 --> 00:23:57.830
of rodeoing for him
in Cummins Prison Farm

00:23:57.830 --> 00:24:03.920
in Southern Arkansas in 1935.

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:07.990
Lomax is recording songs for the
Library of Congress, work songs

00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:12.670
and he believes that people
who are in prison are closer

00:24:12.670 --> 00:24:15.470
to the folk source, because
he said nobody listened

00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:17.780
to the radio for the last
10 years; he's concerned

00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:21.690
about radio may undermine
the folk process.

00:24:21.690 --> 00:24:25.760
So, he's recording these work
songs and an architect led

00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:30.950
by an inmate named Kelly Pace
comes before the microphone

00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:37.910
and they sing "Rock Island Line"
as a call and response song.

00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:41.960
And unfortunately Lomax or Lead
Belly never actually asked him

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:44.460
if it's a work song or not,
so the question of whether

00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:46.590
or not it's a work song
or just a song they sung,

00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:49.280
I think it's still
debatable because I'm not;

00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:50.650
it's quite a fast song.

00:24:50.650 --> 00:24:52.150
What work you could possibly do?

00:24:52.150 --> 00:24:53.640
You certainly couldn't
chop an axe.

00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:56.180
Lead Belly turned it
into a chopping song.

00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:58.130
He started it off as
a chopping song, but.

00:24:58.130 --> 00:25:03.360
So anyway, John Lomax records
the song on a piece of equipment

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:04.660
on the size of a sort

00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:07.840
of domestic fridge
and he needs that.

00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:09.690
That's how he, that's
how he records songs.

00:25:09.690 --> 00:25:11.830
Lead Belly, I mean, he sung
the song a couple of times

00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:13.150
and he's got it,
he takes it away.

00:25:13.150 --> 00:25:16.040
He steals a couple of
lines from nursery rhymes;

00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:18.900
The Cat in the Cupboard and
some traditional blues lines

00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:20.770
and he turns it into
the song we know.

00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:22.330
He kind of adds to it.

00:25:22.330 --> 00:25:29.170
He bolts stuff onto it and
when he goes out with Lomax to,

00:25:29.170 --> 00:25:32.490
to give talks to
academics at universities,

00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:35.010
he's on the East Coast,
he's in a bit of a quandary

00:25:35.010 --> 00:25:38.940
with this song because for
those songs that he learned

00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:41.260
through the old tradition,
he has a context for them.

00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:44.120
He says, you know, when we sang
this song we did this, you know,

00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:45.810
this is; I mean, he's the
first vernacular singer

00:25:45.810 --> 00:25:50.210
to ever do this kind of
thing in American culture.

00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:52.230
And so, he's you know,

00:25:52.230 --> 00:25:56.210
the academics said they had
never seen a blues singer

00:25:56.210 --> 00:25:58.800
like this in front of them, so
they want to know the context,

00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:01.120
but he has no context
for "Rock Island Line."

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:03.050
He's got a great song,
but he's got no context.

00:26:03.050 --> 00:26:05.850
So, he remembers that they
recorded by the wood pile,

00:26:05.850 --> 00:26:08.930
so he starts off talking
about as a chopping song,

00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:12.100
but then after a couple of years
it kind of transforms himself

00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:16.220
into this story about
a train driver and,

00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:20.600
or he calls them a
depot agent I think,

00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:22.760
but he's actually will
be a signal man I imagine

00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:25.800
and he's telling the train
driver that the train's got

00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:29.110
to holt, because there's
an express train coming in;

00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:33.310
the golden age of railroad,
freight trains have to give way

00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:36.380
to express trains, but
there's an exemption

00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:38.740
on animal welfare grounds if
you're carrying livestock.

00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:40.440
So, he says to the,
Lead Belly says

00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:42.930
to the depot agent,
"I've got pigs.

00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:44.230
I've got horses, I've
got all livestock."

00:26:44.230 --> 00:26:45.560
He says, "Okay, you can go."

00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:47.460
And then he goes down the
line and shouts back to him,

00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:48.780
"Fooled yeah, I've fooled yeah,

00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:52.260
I've got pig iron"
which maybe a pun.

00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:55.340
And it's that version which
finally develops into the story

00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:56.970
that we're familiar with.

00:26:56.970 --> 00:27:01.650
And Donegan I think uses one
of the later versions recorded

00:27:01.650 --> 00:27:07.660
in the 1940s as his model, but
he adds to the story again by,

00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:12.050
by introducing a
tollgate into the story.

00:27:12.050 --> 00:27:16.870
The train has got to pay a toll
because of what it has on it,

00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:18.170
it's like a tariff really.

00:27:18.170 --> 00:27:20.620
It's like the idea of a tariff
trying to cross the border,

00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:22.070
but of course, there
never was a tollgate

00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:24.010
on American railroads, you know.

00:27:24.010 --> 00:27:27.980
So, Donegan is kind of adding to
it in a way that Lead Belly did.

00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:30.580
But the interesting thing about
Donegan's version is by bringing

00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:34.160
in the tollgate, he's kind of
watermarked it as his version.

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:36.770
So, if you ever hear a
version of "Rock Island Line"

00:27:36.770 --> 00:27:40.140
and it's got a tollgate in it,

00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:42.210
that person is not been
listening to Lead Belly,

00:27:42.210 --> 00:27:43.510
they listened to Lonnie Donegan.

00:27:43.510 --> 00:27:46.640
And I have to say,
Johnny Cash's first album

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:48.610
with Sun Records opens
with "Rock Island Line"

00:27:48.610 --> 00:27:53.200
and he mentions the tollgate, so
that's very interesting for me;

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:56.150
that's a very, very interesting;
there is a saying with folks,

00:27:56.150 --> 00:27:57.580
"What goes around comes around."

00:27:57.580 --> 00:27:58.880
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:00.180
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: I don't know

00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:01.480
if you ever really
heard that Steve.

00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:02.780
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yep.

00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:04.080
Absolutely.

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:05.380
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Yeah.

00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:06.680
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
Yeah, it's interesting

00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:07.980
because you know Johnny
was not necessarily aware

00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:09.280
that he learned it from
someone who had learned it

00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:10.580
from Lonnie Donegan if
you know what I mean.

00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:11.880
It became so much a
part of popular culture.

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:13.180
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Well, it was a.

00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:14.480
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
For that short time.

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:15.780
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: It
was a huge hit.

00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:17.080
I mean.

00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:18.380
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:19.680
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: It got up to
number 8 in the American charts

00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:20.980
and there were a dozen copies.

00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:22.280
If I remember rightly,

00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:23.580
Rod Mckuen's first
band he recorded it.

00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:26.620
The guy who became the voice of
the Jolly Green Giant he did it.

00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:29.940
There was a kind of
Uncle Dave Macon type

00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:31.950
of guy he recorded a
version of it as well

00:28:31.950 --> 00:28:33.440
and they all mention
the tollgate.

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:35.100
They all mention the tollgate.

00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:36.400
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yes.

00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:37.700
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: It's,
I mean you know,

00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:39.510
I don't if Lonnie
knew this but he kind

00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:41.640
of like recast the song
for a new generation.

00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:42.940
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:45.040
I think he just didn't
understand what the situation

00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:46.340
was that led [multiple
speakers].

00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:47.640
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: I
think he was trying

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:48.940
to make sense of it, yeah.

00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:50.240
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:51.540
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: I think he was
trying to make sense of it.

00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:52.840
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Yeah.

00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:54.140
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: In his own mind.

00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:55.440
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:56.740
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Because the
old song says the train goes

00:28:56.740 --> 00:28:58.040
to New Orleans and "Rock Island
Line" it went to New Orleans

00:28:58.040 --> 00:28:59.340
and it's possible that Lead
Belly might be saying Moline.

00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:00.640
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:01.940
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: And
Moline is the county

00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:03.240
in which Rock Island is.

00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:04.540
It's one of the tri-cities
I think Davenport,

00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:05.840
so he might have been
talking about that.

00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:07.140
Nobody.

00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:08.440
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Speaking of
what goes around comes around,

00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:10.150
I mean one of the reasons
that, that we at the Library

00:29:10.150 --> 00:29:12.810
of Congress are so interested
in this skiffle story is

00:29:12.810 --> 00:29:16.940
that Lead Belly and John Lomax
were making that recording

00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:18.500
for the Library of Congress.

00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:19.800
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: That's right.

00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:21.160
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: And so,
that recording is here.

00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:24.680
It was made for us
and we still have it

00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:26.190
and you were actually
able to look at the.

00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:27.490
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: The sleeve.

00:29:27.490 --> 00:29:28.790
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: At
the sleeve from it.

00:29:28.790 --> 00:29:30.090
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Yeah, that
was an amazing thing to see.

00:29:30.090 --> 00:29:31.390
To see John Lomax's
handwriting on there.

00:29:31.390 --> 00:29:32.690
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:29:32.690 --> 00:29:34.030
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: And his notes
from that day was kind of,

00:29:34.030 --> 00:29:37.240
that was a sort of
a wow moment for me.

00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:40.000
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: So, one of
the things that's interesting

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:45.190
to us is the question of how
this recording from the Library

00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:48.200
of Congress ends up in
Lonnie Donegan's repertoire.

00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:49.500
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Yeah.

00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:52.790
Well, in the years
after World War II,

00:29:52.790 --> 00:29:55.880
the American Government created
something called the United

00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:58.840
States Information
Service which was setup

00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:02.540
to propagate American
culture around the world

00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:04.070
and it mostly took the form

00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:07.460
of libraries closely
associated with your embassies.

00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:11.030
In Grosvenor Square in London,
directly across the road

00:30:11.030 --> 00:30:14.270
from the, or across the
square from the Embassy,

00:30:14.270 --> 00:30:17.540
there was a USIS
building and, again,

00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:19.060
it was predominantly books,

00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:21.640
but in the basement there
was a record library

00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:24.550
and the record library was the
Library of Congress recordings;

00:30:24.550 --> 00:30:26.530
the entire catalog was the
Library of Congress recordings

00:30:26.530 --> 00:30:27.830
and if you gave them your name

00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:31.280
and address you could borrow
one of those recordings.

00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:35.420
So, it's highly likely that the
skifflers would get them there,

00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:38.100
because you couldn't kind
of buy Lead Belly records.

00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:40.530
You know, Lead Belly
wasn't released in,

00:30:40.530 --> 00:30:41.830
you know, in the UK.

00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:46.850
You could get him in import and
you had to then know somebody

00:30:46.850 --> 00:30:50.190
who went to America in order
to do that, so to be able

00:30:50.190 --> 00:30:53.430
to have access to
those records on a,

00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:58.280
on a library basis was very,
very important to those guys

00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:04.990
and a number of them I spoke to
were very angry about Donegan

00:31:04.990 --> 00:31:08.260
because he used to borrow
the records and keep them,

00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:13.560
and Ron Gould who was one
of the interviewees told me

00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:16.880
that he went into the Library of
Congress and they checked for;

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:19.710
I think it was, he said I think
he said it was Muddy Waters

00:31:19.710 --> 00:31:21.930
that used to over farm
and Lomax's recordings,

00:31:21.930 --> 00:31:23.430
but Muddy used to over farm.

00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:24.750
And he looked at it
and he said, "Well,

00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:26.730
it's been loaned out
to a T. Donegan."

00:31:26.730 --> 00:31:28.860
His real name is
Tony, Tony Donegan

00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:34.740
and unfortunately he's lost
it and Ron Gould was like,

00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:38.820
but so Donegan's rationale
was that the library,

00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:40.810
the American Embassy could
always buy a new copy.

00:31:40.810 --> 00:31:42.110
He couldn't.

00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:43.410
Where was he going to
get it, so he happily,

00:31:43.410 --> 00:31:45.510
I think it was a 4 shilling
fine or something like that

00:31:45.510 --> 00:31:48.960
and he said he was happy to pay
the fine and he had the record.

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:50.260
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: One

00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:52.360
of the things that's funny is
I later looked up a history

00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:55.970
of the USIS and the librarians
were actually quite explicit

00:31:55.970 --> 00:31:57.840
about the fact that
they didn't much mind

00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:00.150
if people stole materials
from the library,

00:32:00.150 --> 00:32:01.450
because the whole point was to.

00:32:01.450 --> 00:32:02.750
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Yeah.

00:32:02.750 --> 00:32:04.050
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Get the
American message out there.

00:32:04.050 --> 00:32:05.350
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Yeah.

00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:06.650
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: And
if someone stole it

00:32:06.650 --> 00:32:07.950
that meant they really
liked it and they'd share it

00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:09.250
with their friends and
that's exactly what happened.

00:32:09.250 --> 00:32:10.550
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: And
Donegan really did that well.

00:32:10.550 --> 00:32:11.850
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: I'll
tell Ron Gould that,

00:32:11.850 --> 00:32:15.050
but I don't think it will
make him feel any better.

00:32:15.050 --> 00:32:18.600
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: So, the
punk movement in the 1970s

00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:22.160
and the skiffle emergence
in the 1950s;

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:24.450
how do you see them connected?

00:32:24.450 --> 00:32:26.030
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Well, I think
they're connected in the sense

00:32:26.030 --> 00:32:29.570
that skiffle was an
empowering movement.

00:32:29.570 --> 00:32:33.680
You know, it was young
people making their own music

00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:36.800
in the same way that
punk was in 1977.

00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:39.070
In some ways tried to been
a kind of a little like punk

00:32:39.070 --> 00:32:42.560
in the sense that the trad
guys were trying to get away

00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:47.130
from the commerciality of
contemporary jazz which had sort

00:32:47.130 --> 00:32:50.510
of mutated the kind that called
swing, big bands you know,

00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:54.120
crooners they wanted to get back
to the basics of it and that,

00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:56.250
in that sense it's very
similar to what the Ramones

00:32:56.250 --> 00:32:58.910
and the [inaudible] were
trying to do just before punk

00:32:58.910 --> 00:33:02.060
when they were a pulled by the
commerciality of guitar rock

00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:04.070
and they were trying to get
back to something purer.

00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:06.540
So, this, that kind of
is a little bit like,

00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:11.140
like punk as well, but the thing
about skiffle is it touches

00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:13.600
in so many of the founding
ideas of punk world.

00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:17.060
One of the key tenants of punk
was here's 3 chords now form a

00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:19.740
band, and of course that
was true of skiffle,

00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:22.510
because you only needed 3
chords to play almost all

00:33:22.510 --> 00:33:24.190
of Donegan's repertoire.

00:33:24.190 --> 00:33:30.670
It was very much a hands on the
[inaudible] music, in the sense

00:33:30.670 --> 00:33:35.190
that you know they were
building their own instruments.

00:33:35.190 --> 00:33:38.930
A key aspect of skiffle is
something called a tea chest

00:33:38.930 --> 00:33:40.910
bass which I think you
call a washtub bass,

00:33:40.910 --> 00:33:47.870
but a tea chest base was a, if
can imagine a box like a crate

00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:51.170
about a meter by a meter
by just less than a meter.

00:33:51.170 --> 00:33:55.510
It was used for importing
loose leaf tea from India

00:33:55.510 --> 00:33:59.960
and they used to literally cut
the top off and then use them

00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:02.620
as storage cases; all of us
have them in our attics at home

00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:05.670
so used for storage, but
if you tip it upside-down

00:34:05.670 --> 00:34:10.890
so the base now becomes the top
and you, you mount a broom pole

00:34:10.890 --> 00:34:13.860
to the edge and run a piece of
twine to the center and pull it

00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:16.170
through and tie it, you
can get a kind of a doom,

00:34:16.170 --> 00:34:17.940
doom, doom, doom noise.

00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:22.210
It's not very in pitch, but
it has the effect of that,

00:34:22.210 --> 00:34:23.550
so this is what they did.

00:34:23.550 --> 00:34:27.450
They made these, they made
their musical instruments

00:34:27.450 --> 00:34:29.110
with stuff they could
buy in a hardware shop.

00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:31.200
What could be more
DIY than that?

00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:32.740
You know, there's
something about DIY.

00:34:32.740 --> 00:34:37.850
But I think most important of
all was the sense of empowerment

00:34:37.850 --> 00:34:40.270
that came with skiffle.

00:34:40.270 --> 00:34:41.570
The thing to me that
was really attractive

00:34:41.570 --> 00:34:43.390
about punk was it
was at year zero.

00:34:43.390 --> 00:34:47.050
It was like everything else that
came before, out the window.

00:34:47.050 --> 00:34:48.350
Forget it.

00:34:48.350 --> 00:34:50.470
I mean, obviously we've, we
thought that, but at the time,

00:34:50.470 --> 00:34:55.150
it was like this is us, we
are, we identify with this

00:34:55.150 --> 00:34:56.780
and we're different
from what went before.

00:34:56.780 --> 00:35:01.170
Skiffle is that times a
hundred, because we're talking

00:35:01.170 --> 00:35:03.760
about the first time it
happened in our culture,

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:07.860
and what the symbol of
it is is the guitar.

00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:09.840
The guitar is not
an instrument common

00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:11.930
in British culture
up to that point.

00:35:11.930 --> 00:35:13.410
Our folk music was predominantly

00:35:13.410 --> 00:35:15.510
if it was singing it
was unaccompanied,

00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:19.170
it was instrumental,
it was fiddles

00:35:19.170 --> 00:35:22.350
and a squeeze box stuff
like that, you know.

00:35:22.350 --> 00:35:26.540
It wasn't; guitars were
played by outsiders

00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:29.630
like singing cowboys, or
calypsonians, or bluesmen.

00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:33.150
So, in taking the guitar,
Donegan was introducing,

00:35:33.150 --> 00:35:36.560
he was the first Britain to get
on the charts playing guitar,

00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:43.310
and it kind of gave that
generation of young men a symbol

00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:47.490
of their difference from
the previous generation.

00:35:47.490 --> 00:35:49.660
So, the guitar becomes
the symbol of year zero.

00:35:49.660 --> 00:35:53.480
And I think that if you were
a kid in 57 and you saw a sign

00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:57.030
that said "Tonight Skiffle", you
wouldn't necessarily just expect

00:35:57.030 --> 00:35:58.330
to hear Donegan songs.

00:35:58.330 --> 00:36:00.640
You would expect to hear
music played on a guitar.

00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:02.530
Skiffle means guitar music.

00:36:02.530 --> 00:36:04.910
Skiffle means a new beginning.

00:36:04.910 --> 00:36:07.670
Skiffle means, you know, that
punk meant a number of things,

00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:10.910
it meant you had the Pistols
and The Clash, but also Ian Dury

00:36:10.910 --> 00:36:12.250
by the Blockheads
and stuff like that.

00:36:12.250 --> 00:36:13.550
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: But,

00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:15.770
punk didn't have the
never-ending contest,

00:36:15.770 --> 00:36:17.070
punk contest.

00:36:17.070 --> 00:36:18.370
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: No, that's true.

00:36:18.370 --> 00:36:20.530
That's true, but the, one of the
problems for the skifflist was

00:36:20.530 --> 00:36:22.270
that they didn't,
they were so young,

00:36:22.270 --> 00:36:23.570
many of them were so young.

00:36:23.570 --> 00:36:24.870
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Yeah.

00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:26.170
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: You
know, Van Morrison was 12

00:36:26.170 --> 00:36:27.470
when he heard Lead Belly.

00:36:27.470 --> 00:36:31.870
George Harrison was 13, Paul
McCarthy was 14, Lennon was 16

00:36:31.870 --> 00:36:35.010
when Donegan played in Liverpool
and they all, you know,

00:36:35.010 --> 00:36:38.660
Lennon formed the Quarrymen
within 2 weeks of seeing him.

00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:40.800
They were so young that
they never did proper gigs

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:42.100
like I do gigs.

00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:43.400
A lot of punk bands did gigs.

00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:49.150
They were just playing in school
halls, you know, scout huts,

00:36:49.150 --> 00:36:51.400
church halls, coffee bars.

00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:52.700
They didn't make records.

00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:55.000
You know, there's an
estimated between 30

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:59.040
and 50,000 skiffle bands playing
at [inaudible] in 1957, but.

00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:00.340
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Wow.

00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:01.640
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Their
all under 18.

00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:02.940
They're not making records.

00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:04.240
They don't have a career,

00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:06.190
but what they do
have is competitions.

00:37:06.190 --> 00:37:08.630
They had skiffle contests
organized which ended

00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:13.380
up with some of the, some of
these bands appearing on TV

00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:16.470
and some were promised
record deals,

00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:18.710
but really it's how they all
cut the teeth playing live.

00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:21.950
And you know, all those
guys, I mean the skiffle,

00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:23.560
The Beatles failed
their skiffle band,

00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:25.630
The Quarrymen failed
their audition

00:37:25.630 --> 00:37:27.040
for a national skiffle contest.

00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:30.040
They weren't up to
speed, but interestingly.

00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:32.100
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy:
That's amazing.

00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:33.400
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Yeah.

00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:34.700
Interestingly, it was a whole,

00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:37.590
the whole thing was just a
complete con, because the person

00:37:37.590 --> 00:37:40.750
who had the loudest applause
won, so it was you know,

00:37:40.750 --> 00:37:42.050
you wanted to bring
all your friends

00:37:42.050 --> 00:37:44.230
so the promoters made a fortune,
but it was very serious.

00:37:44.230 --> 00:37:47.480
I mean, the finals,
the finals was

00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:50.960
in a primetime TV program
called Come Dancing which went

00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:54.110
out on 7 O'clock on a Friday
night which was a huge,

00:37:54.110 --> 00:37:57.620
it's a ballroom dancing and
my parents watched it avidly.

00:37:57.620 --> 00:38:01.120
But the skiffle competition
final was in that program.

00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:03.170
It wasn't in some kids program.

00:38:03.170 --> 00:38:04.470
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:05.770
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: It was
the absolute center

00:38:05.770 --> 00:38:07.070
of our, of our culture.

00:38:07.070 --> 00:38:08.370
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Wow.

00:38:08.370 --> 00:38:09.830
And there's lots of
skiffle clubs too in.

00:38:09.830 --> 00:38:11.130
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Yeah.

00:38:11.130 --> 00:38:12.430
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: In Soho.

00:38:12.430 --> 00:38:13.730
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Yeah, there,

00:38:13.730 --> 00:38:15.100
well and around the country
Donegan encouraged people

00:38:15.100 --> 00:38:16.550
to form clubs.

00:38:16.550 --> 00:38:20.660
He had a sort of a
newsletter which explained how

00:38:20.660 --> 00:38:23.350
to form a club and if you came
to play in town he would sort

00:38:23.350 --> 00:38:24.650
of try and get down there

00:38:24.650 --> 00:38:27.170
and they would get a
pre-released copy of his record

00:38:27.170 --> 00:38:28.750
and how to play it
and stuff like that.

00:38:28.750 --> 00:38:30.570
Which in some ways led
to the formation of some

00:38:30.570 --> 00:38:32.910
of the early folk clubs in my
country, you know, that are sort

00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:35.290
of the folk revival kind
of came out of skiffle.

00:38:35.290 --> 00:38:36.590
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy:
Can you talk to us

00:38:36.590 --> 00:38:39.600
about the Flexi recordings,
those little plastic ones?

00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:40.900
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Yeah
I can, yeah.

00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:44.780
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: That
was kind of fascinating.

00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:47.510
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Again, there
are obviously similarities

00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:50.020
with punk rock in that
they were fanzines.

00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:52.580
People made, you know, Xerox
fanzines that they sold

00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:56.010
around clubs and this one
band made some Flexi discs;

00:38:56.010 --> 00:38:58.090
Flexi discs for those of you who
aren't old enough to remember is

00:38:58.090 --> 00:39:01.780
like a transparent plastic
square with record grooves in it

00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:04.250
and you can staple it
to a magazine and sell.

00:39:04.250 --> 00:39:08.060
And the Eden Street skiffle
group made the entire album;

00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:10.300
it's one of the very few skiffle
albums actually they made an

00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:12.370
entire album of.

00:39:12.370 --> 00:39:13.670
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Wow.

00:39:13.670 --> 00:39:14.970
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: These Flexis and
what you had to do is you had

00:39:14.970 --> 00:39:18.590
to fold the corners into the
sleeve of the 7-inch sleeve

00:39:18.590 --> 00:39:21.780
which gave it some rigidity
and then, and then put it on

00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:26.270
and put an old English penny
which is like a cartwheel

00:39:26.270 --> 00:39:28.590
and put it on top of the
needles and it would bounce up

00:39:28.590 --> 00:39:29.890
and down and they still play.

00:39:29.890 --> 00:39:32.070
I bought some on eBay and
you can still play them.

00:39:32.070 --> 00:39:35.850
They still work after over 60
years; 60-year-old technology.

00:39:35.850 --> 00:39:37.150
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:39:37.150 --> 00:39:38.450
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Very
similar to punk then.

00:39:38.450 --> 00:39:39.750
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
Yeah, I think the point

00:39:39.750 --> 00:39:41.050
of the Flexi was you could
put it inside the magazine.

00:39:41.050 --> 00:39:42.350
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Yeah.

00:39:42.350 --> 00:39:43.650
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: And
the magazine would flex,

00:39:43.650 --> 00:39:44.950
it wouldn't crack
the way a regular.

00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:46.250
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Or stick it on
the back of a Corn Flakes box.

00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:47.550
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:39:47.550 --> 00:39:48.850
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: They
were very popular

00:39:48.850 --> 00:39:50.150
to put kid's music
on Corn Flakes boxes.

00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:51.450
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:39:51.450 --> 00:39:52.750
So, so you mentioned the
importance of Lead Belly

00:39:52.750 --> 00:39:54.050
and other traditional
American songs

00:39:54.050 --> 00:39:55.590
which was a big part of skiffle.

00:39:55.590 --> 00:39:57.750
There was this other thing
that happened sort of late

00:39:57.750 --> 00:40:01.270
in skiffle that, that I
wonder if you think of it

00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:04.300
or how you think of it that
it's a those songs like

00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:05.980
"My Old Man's a Dustman" or.

00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:07.280
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Yeah.

00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:08.580
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: "Does Your
Chewing Gum Lose its Flavor?"

00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:09.880
The.

00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:11.180
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Yeah.

00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:12.480
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: The
novelty songs of ended skiffle.

00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:13.780
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Yeah.

00:40:13.780 --> 00:40:15.080
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Is that kind

00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:16.380
of a betrayal of
the skiffle idea?

00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:17.680
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: I'm not sure
they're technically they're

00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:18.980
skiffle really Stephen.

00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:20.280
I think what happens is
Lonnie Donegan becomes an

00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:21.580
all-round entertainer.

00:40:21.580 --> 00:40:22.880
You guys see, Lonnie in
some ways is our Elvis.

00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:26.480
You know, he's the very first
and, and it's worth mentioning

00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:29.680
that he recorded "Rock
Island Line" on the 13th

00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:32.880
of July 1954 just a week
after Elvis Presley recorded

00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:36.640
"It's Alright Mama" in
Memphis with Sam Phillips,

00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:39.280
so they're almost simultaneous.

00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:40.580
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
You could argue it's

00:40:40.580 --> 00:40:42.070
like the most important
week in pop music.

00:40:42.070 --> 00:40:43.370
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Yeah.

00:40:43.370 --> 00:40:44.670
You could.

00:40:44.670 --> 00:40:45.970
What came out of that?

00:40:45.970 --> 00:40:47.270
But it's, and it's
amazing that the,

00:40:47.270 --> 00:40:48.570
that it happened so closely.

00:40:48.570 --> 00:40:51.220
But just as Elvis kind of
didn't really know where to go

00:40:51.220 --> 00:40:53.490
and ended up going to Vegas,
well Donegan kind of goes

00:40:53.490 --> 00:40:55.830
to these sort of novelty songs

00:40:55.830 --> 00:40:58.820
and so it betrays the
credibility he had,

00:40:58.820 --> 00:41:00.780
because he has amazing
credibility

00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:03.080
in his early years among the,

00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:05.720
the young people
playing his music,

00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:10.990
so I think that because Donegan
is the only real superstar

00:41:10.990 --> 00:41:15.500
and his career sustains
after the skiffle star wanes.

00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:17.800
What happens is it's
superseded by rock and roll.

00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:23.100
I don't think we can, My Old
Man's a Dustman" kind of sort

00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:24.740
of finishes it for
all the skifflers,

00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:26.850
it's like it's over;
that's 1960.

00:41:26.850 --> 00:41:30.660
Although, I have to say, that
same year The Beatles went

00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:35.530
to Hamburg and as
constituted at the time,

00:41:35.530 --> 00:41:37.490
The Beatles were
Harrison, McCarthy,

00:41:37.490 --> 00:41:41.760
and Lennon the 3 guitar
players from the Quarrymen,

00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:45.240
Pete Best who was the son of
a woman they knew played a bit

00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:47.610
of drums and their
friend who looked great

00:41:47.610 --> 00:41:50.430
but couldn't really play
the bass, but when they got

00:41:50.430 --> 00:41:55.490
to Hamburg there was a,
Koschmider put a wrestler

00:41:55.490 --> 00:41:58.130
out to look after them, a big
old German wrestler to keep them

00:41:58.130 --> 00:42:01.070
out of trouble and he
was interviewed by a DJ,

00:42:01.070 --> 00:42:03.890
an American DJ at the height
of Beatle mania in the 1960s

00:42:03.890 --> 00:42:05.190
and the guy asked
him, "What were they

00:42:05.190 --> 00:42:07.370
like when they first
came to Hamburg?"

00:42:07.370 --> 00:42:11.480
And he said, "They played too
much of that washboard music."

00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:14.030
You know, he said,
"Those British bands,

00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:16.460
they thought Lonnie
Donegan was Elvis."

00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:17.760
I mean, the implication
of that is

00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:19.810
that The Beatles were still
more or less a skiffle band

00:42:19.810 --> 00:42:21.110
when they got to Hamburg.

00:42:21.110 --> 00:42:22.990
I mean, because that's not
the way the legend goes,

00:42:22.990 --> 00:42:26.230
and I think you got to
accept that skiffle did carry

00:42:26.230 --> 00:42:29.700
on after Donegan disappeared,
because those kids are still,

00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:31.430
they're still playing,
they've got the bug now.

00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:34.420
They're playing guitars and
they still, they're still,

00:42:34.420 --> 00:42:37.030
it's still as accessible as
it was, but it was like a,

00:42:37.030 --> 00:42:38.970
it was kind of like
a school ground,

00:42:38.970 --> 00:42:41.060
a playground crying skiffle.

00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:42.890
It wasn't like a scene.

00:42:42.890 --> 00:42:46.440
It was like every [inaudible]
school boy could play 3 chords

00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:49.260
on a guitar, you know,
and you had a choice,

00:42:49.260 --> 00:42:53.040
you could play football
and impress your mates

00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:54.580
or play guitar and
impress girls.

00:42:54.580 --> 00:42:55.880
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Exactly.

00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:57.180
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: You can see
the attraction can't you?

00:42:57.180 --> 00:42:58.480
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Exactly.

00:42:58.480 --> 00:42:59.780
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: What
if you could both I mean?

00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:01.270
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: That
would be impossible.

00:43:01.270 --> 00:43:02.570
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:43:02.570 --> 00:43:03.870
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: I've
never seen anybody do both

00:43:03.870 --> 00:43:05.470
at the same time.

00:43:05.470 --> 00:43:07.720
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: So,
skiffle, skiffle has roots

00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:12.400
in traditional jazz and we'd
like to ask you about that

00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:17.540
and also talk about the 20-year
Musician's Union embargo.

00:43:17.540 --> 00:43:19.200
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Oh, dear
that's a shameful episode.

00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:20.500
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Yes.

00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:21.800
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: In our history.

00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:23.100
Well, where would you
like me to start on that?

00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:24.400
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Let's
start with traditional jazz

00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:25.700
and then we'll move
over to the embargo.

00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:27.000
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: What can I
tell you about trad jazz?

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:28.300
The a just sort of?

00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:33.100
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: I think the
fact that, that it has roots,

00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:35.080
it's a major root of skiffle.

00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:36.380
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: It is yes.

00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:37.680
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Maybe
the Ken Colyer story.

00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:38.980
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: The
Ken Colyer story.

00:43:38.980 --> 00:43:40.540
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Yeah,
yeah that's a great, yes.

00:43:40.540 --> 00:43:41.990
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: It's
such a great story, yeah.

00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:43.290
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: And
the jail scene too.

00:43:43.290 --> 00:43:44.860
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Yeah
that whole thing.

00:43:44.860 --> 00:43:47.070
Well, the driving
force behind trad jazz

00:43:47.070 --> 00:43:50.090
in the UK was a guy named Ken
Colyer who's a trumpet player.

00:43:50.090 --> 00:43:53.880
And he was hugely frustrated
by the fact that he was unable

00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:55.840
to see any of these
jazz bands play,

00:43:55.840 --> 00:44:00.810
because there was a band on,
American bands touring in the UK

00:44:00.810 --> 00:44:03.450
between 1935 and 1955.

00:44:03.450 --> 00:44:06.500
It was a reciprocal
band that originated

00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:12.140
with the American Federation
of Musicians who in 1934 said

00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:15.310
that British band leaders,

00:44:15.310 --> 00:44:18.020
jazz band leaders could
only tour the United States

00:44:18.020 --> 00:44:21.570
of America if A, they use
only American musicians and B,

00:44:21.570 --> 00:44:24.390
if they took out
American citizenship.

00:44:24.390 --> 00:44:25.860
It's the worst kind
of protectionism

00:44:25.860 --> 00:44:28.250
and as someone who's always
been a supporter of unions,

00:44:28.250 --> 00:44:30.100
you can imagine how
disappointed I was particularly

00:44:30.100 --> 00:44:31.400
with music as well.

00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:32.700
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Yeah.

00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:34.060
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: So, the British
Ministry of Labour reciprocated

00:44:34.060 --> 00:44:35.590
on that and nobody toured.

00:44:35.590 --> 00:44:38.790
So, so for the jazzers
after the war,

00:44:38.790 --> 00:44:41.460
they couldn't learn
really how to play,

00:44:41.460 --> 00:44:42.760
because you see you only learn

00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:44.060
by seeing someone
physically do it.

00:44:44.060 --> 00:44:45.360
That's how you learn.

00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:46.660
You sat on the edge of the
stage, that's what Donegan did,

00:44:46.660 --> 00:44:48.740
it's what Chris Barber
did, all those guys did.

00:44:48.740 --> 00:44:51.860
They sat there every night and
watched as close as you and I

00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:54.370
as they could to the
guys who were playing.

00:44:54.370 --> 00:44:58.700
So, Ken Colyer realized that
some of the original players,

00:44:58.700 --> 00:45:01.710
although they're in their
60s and 70s, were still alive

00:45:01.710 --> 00:45:04.840
and playing in dives
in New Orleans.

00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:08.510
So, he hatched a plot
to get to New Orleans.

00:45:08.510 --> 00:45:11.570
Except the only way you could
really get to New Orleans

00:45:11.570 --> 00:45:15.740
in those days was, well it
was almost impossible really,

00:45:15.740 --> 00:45:19.490
because not only because
the travel and the distance

00:45:19.490 --> 00:45:22.270
and the cost, but the British
Government wouldn't let you go

00:45:22.270 --> 00:45:24.430
out of the country with
more than about 10 pounds

00:45:24.430 --> 00:45:26.810
because of currency smuggling.

00:45:26.810 --> 00:45:28.260
So it was impossible.

00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:30.360
So he comes up with
this brilliant plan.

00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:35.110
He joins the Merchant Navy, the
Merchant Marines and goes all

00:45:35.110 --> 00:45:37.320
around the world until
eventually he gets,

00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:40.720
he gets a job in on a boat
and goes to Mobile, Alabama.

00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:42.490
Now when he gets to
Mobile he jumps ship,

00:45:42.490 --> 00:45:47.200
gets the tourist fees for a
month and goes to New Orleans,

00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:51.330
and he finds George
Lewis Band who backup on,

00:45:51.330 --> 00:45:56.190
backed up Bunk Johnson
on Ken's favorite record.

00:45:56.190 --> 00:45:58.730
And there it just pleases
Chuck to see some kid

00:45:58.730 --> 00:46:00.400
from England who's interested
in what they're doing,

00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:01.820
because they're playing
to people their age;

00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:03.380
they're playing to 70-year-olds.

00:46:03.380 --> 00:46:07.400
You know, British, American,
African-American guys

00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:08.870
in their 20s are
listening to beep-bop.

00:46:08.870 --> 00:46:10.540
They're not listening to
old time jazz, you know,

00:46:10.540 --> 00:46:12.050
that's grandad's music.

00:46:12.050 --> 00:46:14.750
So, not only does
he know his stuff,

00:46:14.750 --> 00:46:16.890
he knows it so well he
can sit in with them.

00:46:16.890 --> 00:46:19.340
So, they invite him to get
on the bandstand and play

00:46:19.340 --> 00:46:21.230
which is just incredible when
you think about it, isn't it?

00:46:21.230 --> 00:46:23.550
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: How
radical was that in itself?

00:46:23.550 --> 00:46:27.330
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Well that was
very radical for a, you know,

00:46:27.330 --> 00:46:30.140
a White guy to play
with Black musicians

00:46:30.140 --> 00:46:32.780
and it ultimately cost him is
liberty, because when he went

00:46:32.780 --> 00:46:34.990
to renew his Visa
he was a day late

00:46:34.990 --> 00:46:37.280
because his renewal date
was the 25th of December.

00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:39.070
Now normally you might think,

00:46:39.070 --> 00:46:41.140
sorry about that
mate we weren't open,

00:46:41.140 --> 00:46:43.280
or you might say I'm
afraid that's a misdemeanor

00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:45.880
and if you have a misdemeanor
what happens to you?

00:46:45.880 --> 00:46:48.520
They put you in-house arrest
in a hotel in a hostile

00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:49.940
and then they deport you.

00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:51.410
But they put Ken in jail.

00:46:51.410 --> 00:46:55.900
They jailed him and the
implication is really that they,

00:46:55.900 --> 00:46:59.780
you know, this is punishment
for, for associating

00:46:59.780 --> 00:47:01.670
with African-American musicians.

00:47:01.670 --> 00:47:03.110
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: And he
was in jail for a while.

00:47:03.110 --> 00:47:04.410
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: He was in jail

00:47:04.410 --> 00:47:06.200
for a longtime, 38
days without bail.

00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:09.600
This is a completely
unprecedented for someone

00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:11.350
on a Visa violation, you know.

00:47:11.350 --> 00:47:13.400
And whenever they ask him what
we'd do if they let him out,

00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:14.700
he said I'll go and
play with those guys.

00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:16.000
I've come to learn.

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.370
So, they just kept him
locked up as a subversive,

00:47:18.370 --> 00:47:23.070
because in those days to make
a stand against Jim Crow was

00:47:23.070 --> 00:47:24.810
to be a subversive,
was to be a Communist.

00:47:24.810 --> 00:47:26.950
I mean, I have to say Ken
was a bit of left-winger,

00:47:26.950 --> 00:47:30.440
but he was never a member of
or any of that kind of stuff,

00:47:30.440 --> 00:47:32.470
but he knew exactly
what he was doing.

00:47:32.470 --> 00:47:37.310
But the other side of the story
is, being in jail in Louisiana,

00:47:37.310 --> 00:47:40.090
you know, that's like Lead Belly
territory isn't it, you know?

00:47:40.090 --> 00:47:42.720
When he comes back to
England who is going

00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:44.020
to be able penitentiary blues

00:47:44.020 --> 00:47:45.510
with more authority
than Ken Colyer?

00:47:45.510 --> 00:47:47.150
So it was like amazing.

00:47:47.150 --> 00:47:48.510
So, he writes to his brother.

00:47:48.510 --> 00:47:50.050
His brother gets all
these letters printed

00:47:50.050 --> 00:47:53.730
in the Melody Maker, so his
stories is one is well-known,

00:47:53.730 --> 00:47:57.980
and when he comes home to, to
England he comes like the kind

00:47:57.980 --> 00:48:00.080
of trad jazz Moses coming
down from the mountain

00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:02.170
with the tablets, you know.

00:48:02.170 --> 00:48:05.720
And Chris Barber, and Lonnie
Donegan, and Monty Sunshine,

00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:10.240
Ron Bowden formed a band around
him, The Ken Colyer Jazz Band

00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:15.170
and they go on to carry
forward the flag of trad jazz,

00:48:15.170 --> 00:48:16.770
the best trad jazz
and it's, of course,

00:48:16.770 --> 00:48:20.310
that band that institute
the breakdown sessions.

00:48:20.310 --> 00:48:21.610
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:

00:48:21.610 --> 00:48:23.710
And so skiffle comes
directly out of there.

00:48:23.710 --> 00:48:25.010
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Yes,
out that session yeah.

00:48:25.010 --> 00:48:27.390
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: So, another
great connection that you found

00:48:27.390 --> 00:48:31.750
for the book which you put
in the book and which comes

00:48:31.750 --> 00:48:34.070
from the Library of Congress,
is that there happens

00:48:34.070 --> 00:48:36.310
to be a terrific
photo in our Prints

00:48:36.310 --> 00:48:38.840
and Photographs Division
of Bunk Johnson who.

00:48:38.840 --> 00:48:40.140
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Yeah.

00:48:40.140 --> 00:48:41.440
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
Was the trumpet player

00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:42.740
that Ken Colyer went
to look for.

00:48:42.740 --> 00:48:44.040
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: The hero, yeah.

00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:45.340
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: With
Lead Belly playing.

00:48:45.340 --> 00:48:46.640
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Yeah.

00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:47.940
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
Guitar for him.

00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:49.240
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Yeah.

00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:50.540
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Oh!

00:48:50.540 --> 00:48:51.840
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: And he
[multiple speakers].

00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:53.140
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: That's great.

00:48:53.140 --> 00:48:54.440
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: In
1947 I think, yeah.

00:48:54.440 --> 00:48:55.740
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy:
Oh, I love it.

00:48:55.740 --> 00:48:57.040
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Yeah, 2
verses, 1 [inaudible].

00:48:57.040 --> 00:48:58.340
I was real pleased to see
that to find photograph,

00:48:58.340 --> 00:48:59.640
yeah and it's public
domain as well even better.

00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:00.940
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:49:00.940 --> 00:49:02.240
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Wow.

00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:03.540
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Yeah.

00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:04.840
So, you know, it's an interest;
I didn't really know anything

00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:06.140
about jazz period and
certainly not trad jazz,

00:49:06.140 --> 00:49:07.440
so I found it really interesting
to sort of follow Ken.

00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:10.130
You know, Ken was my kind
of; there's a great book

00:49:10.130 --> 00:49:14.870
about his life called "Goin'
Home; The Uncompromising Life

00:49:14.870 --> 00:49:18.420
and Times of Ken Colyer" which
kind of goes in-depth in all

00:49:18.420 --> 00:49:22.550
that and he kind of like gave
me enough points of reference

00:49:22.550 --> 00:49:25.940
to be able to sort of work,
you know, get off and check

00:49:25.940 --> 00:49:28.820
out a few other names and try
and draw together a chapter

00:49:28.820 --> 00:49:31.880
that introduces English
audiences to the significance

00:49:31.880 --> 00:49:33.600
of New Orleans in our music.

00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:35.370
I think it's probably more
important than New York

00:49:35.370 --> 00:49:37.270
and more important
than Chicago really.

00:49:37.270 --> 00:49:41.300
It doesn't get that credibility,
but, and it's like no other city

00:49:41.300 --> 00:49:42.940
in the United States as
far as I'm concerned.

00:49:42.940 --> 00:49:48.310
It's significance in those
days was considerable,

00:49:48.310 --> 00:49:52.720
but when it was at the mouth
of the Mississippi, you know,

00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:56.390
it was the kind of
permeable membrane

00:49:56.390 --> 00:49:58.680
that the coach would pass

00:49:58.680 --> 00:50:00.850
through on its way
to the interior.

00:50:00.850 --> 00:50:02.980
You know, it wasn't the West
Coast that, or the East Coast

00:50:02.980 --> 00:50:04.600
or the West Coast that
influenced the interior.

00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:08.130
It was big Muddy and New
Orleans at end of it.

00:50:08.130 --> 00:50:12.350
I think people, they lost
sight of that a little bit.

00:50:12.350 --> 00:50:13.670
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy:
And benignets too.

00:50:13.670 --> 00:50:15.320
Can't forget them.

00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:16.620
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: No.

00:50:16.620 --> 00:50:18.480
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: So, we
talked about a couple of groups

00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:22.950
of people, the trad jazz people
and Lonnie Donegan and his crew,

00:50:22.950 --> 00:50:25.350
but there was one other group of
people that you mentioned a lot

00:50:25.350 --> 00:50:26.950
in the book and that
you talk about a bit

00:50:26.950 --> 00:50:29.190
which is the American
expats who happen to be.

00:50:29.190 --> 00:50:30.490
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Yeah.

00:50:30.490 --> 00:50:31.790
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: In
London at that time.

00:50:31.790 --> 00:50:33.090
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: By
coincidence, yeah.

00:50:33.090 --> 00:50:34.580
By incredible coincidence,
just at a time

00:50:34.580 --> 00:50:35.880
when Lead Belly's music

00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:39.390
and Woody Guthrie's music is
becoming significant in the UK,

00:50:39.390 --> 00:50:42.810
there were 3 characters who just
so happened to be in London,

00:50:42.810 --> 00:50:45.630
the first and perhaps the
most important was Alan Lomax

00:50:45.630 --> 00:50:48.550
who having worked for
the Library of Congress

00:50:48.550 --> 00:50:52.450
since the 1930s came under
suspicion in the years

00:50:52.450 --> 00:50:57.240
after the Second World War of
during the Red Scar basically

00:50:57.240 --> 00:50:59.050
because he was promoting
African-American culture.

00:50:59.050 --> 00:51:01.390
I think that's all
it could have been.

00:51:01.390 --> 00:51:04.690
And he decided that it might
be in his best interest

00:51:04.690 --> 00:51:06.280
to go abroad for a while.

00:51:06.280 --> 00:51:11.460
He got a gig making an
anthology of world music for CBS

00:51:11.460 --> 00:51:13.700
which involved him scouring
Europe for recordings

00:51:13.700 --> 00:51:15.290
and he based himself in London.

00:51:15.290 --> 00:51:17.130
He was actually in London
when "Rock Island Line" got

00:51:17.130 --> 00:51:19.230
in the charts which must
have been really weird

00:51:19.230 --> 00:51:21.540
for him not only, you know,
did he know Lead Belly,

00:51:21.540 --> 00:51:23.990
but he was kind of,
you know, wasn't there

00:51:23.990 --> 00:51:26.400
when it was recorded but
obviously he took part

00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:29.280
in the propagation
of all that stuff.

00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:32.930
Ramblin' Jack Elliott was
also in London at the time.

00:51:32.930 --> 00:51:35.590
He really didn't have any
profile in the UK at all;

00:51:35.590 --> 00:51:37.630
he wasn't even Ramblin'
in those days,

00:51:37.630 --> 00:51:41.940
but he and his new wife June
Hammerstein were traveling

00:51:41.940 --> 00:51:46.560
around the world or trying to
travel around the world busking

00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:50.640
and playing guitar and he
kind of turned up at the time

00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:54.530
when people, you know, nobody
had ever seen a real cowboy.

00:51:54.530 --> 00:51:57.940
I know Jack wasn't a real
cowboy, but he had been

00:51:57.940 --> 00:51:59.620
in a rodeo; he did run away
to [multiple speakers].

00:51:59.620 --> 00:52:01.550
He was a rodeo cowboy,
yeah, yeah.

00:52:01.550 --> 00:52:04.570
And his cowboy persona,
I mean again,

00:52:04.570 --> 00:52:10.440
Ron Gould who saw him play
said, he said he had Levis on.

00:52:10.440 --> 00:52:11.970
I'm like, yeah wow.

00:52:11.970 --> 00:52:14.660
That's incredible Ron and,
you know, and he had a hat.

00:52:14.660 --> 00:52:17.660
So, it was like clearly what; he
had a flat top Martin as well,

00:52:17.660 --> 00:52:19.620
he had a flat top Martin
which nobody had seen

00:52:19.620 --> 00:52:21.200
and he could just play
in a lot of styles.

00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:23.200
He just was brilliant at it.

00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:25.140
And Peggy Seeger was also.

00:52:25.140 --> 00:52:26.440
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Peggy Seeger.

00:52:26.440 --> 00:52:27.740
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: In
the UK at that time.

00:52:27.740 --> 00:52:33.280
She'd in some ways the red
scale [inaudible] in her family,

00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:36.320
her father Charles Seeger
who was a very similar

00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:38.810
to John Lomax was a
collector of songs.

00:52:38.810 --> 00:52:41.790
He had his, I think he had
his passport impounded.

00:52:41.790 --> 00:52:48.430
So, she decided to cut out
and went to study in Europe

00:52:48.430 --> 00:52:53.570
and Lomax hooked up with her and
brought her to London and so,

00:52:53.570 --> 00:52:57.530
yeah they all kind of,
they took the opportunity

00:52:57.530 --> 00:53:03.950
that you know the first skiffle
club opened in Soho in 1955,

00:53:03.950 --> 00:53:08.030
well the first one that we
have records for, there was a,

00:53:08.030 --> 00:53:10.920
a specific skiffle club rather
than a jazz club with skiffle

00:53:10.920 --> 00:53:14.200
in it which was the
previous experience of it.

00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:16.810
The first standalone
skiffle-blues club

00:53:16.810 --> 00:53:20.850
at the Roundhouse opened in
the late 1955 just before

00:53:20.850 --> 00:53:22.150
"Rock Island Line" came out.

00:53:22.150 --> 00:53:24.110
So, there was already
a scene, you know.

00:53:24.110 --> 00:53:29.260
Donegan's record appears on
the back of a of scene there,

00:53:29.260 --> 00:53:34.780
but you have to, the one thing
you have to grasp about all

00:53:34.780 --> 00:53:37.740
that stuff is the context
for British youth, you know.

00:53:37.740 --> 00:53:40.490
These are kids who had grown up
in a time of war and rationing.

00:53:40.490 --> 00:53:45.700
The war ended in 1945,
rationing didn't end until 1954.

00:53:45.700 --> 00:53:52.400
So, there was all this kind of
suppressed sort of want that was

00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:54.480
as simple as not being
able to go in a sweet shop

00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:55.780
and buy whatever you want.

00:53:55.780 --> 00:53:57.500
I mean, John Lennon
was a born in 1940.

00:53:57.500 --> 00:53:58.970
He was 14, he could do that.

00:53:58.970 --> 00:54:01.600
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: And they
had income too, the teenagers.

00:54:01.600 --> 00:54:02.900
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Well, yeah.

00:54:02.900 --> 00:54:04.200
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Yeah.

00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:05.500
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: They kind
of left school at 15.

00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:06.800
Lennon didn't.

00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:08.660
He went to art school,
but a whole car drive

00:54:08.660 --> 00:54:12.630
of working class youth
left school in 54-55

00:54:12.630 --> 00:54:14.480
and they easily found
employment.

00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:15.780
They had money.

00:54:15.780 --> 00:54:18.510
The young women went out and
bought cosmetics and clothes

00:54:18.510 --> 00:54:21.210
and records, and the
young men bought guitars.

00:54:21.210 --> 00:54:23.550
And I think that's sort of,

00:54:23.550 --> 00:54:26.280
and one of the reasons why
I think they bought guitars,

00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:28.010
and it's just a theory of mine,

00:54:28.010 --> 00:54:32.610
but when in 1955 is significant
is because when "Rock

00:54:32.610 --> 00:54:35.790
Around the Clock" becomes a
hit and that's on the back

00:54:35.790 --> 00:54:39.680
of the movie "Blackboard Jungle"
which is the opening titles.

00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:41.960
But it also doesn't really
get played on the BBC.

00:54:41.960 --> 00:54:44.190
It gets played in Luxembourg,
which is [inaudible]

00:54:44.190 --> 00:54:48.370
from Central Europe and AFN and
the American Forces' Network,

00:54:48.370 --> 00:54:51.900
but the BBC kind of ignores
it and I'm just thinking

00:54:51.900 --> 00:54:56.100
that maybe there was an impulse
from them kids;" you're going

00:54:56.100 --> 00:54:57.530
to ration rock and
roll as well?"

00:54:57.530 --> 00:54:58.830
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:54:58.830 --> 00:55:00.130
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: "You
think you're going

00:55:00.130 --> 00:55:01.430
to ration rock and roll, right.

00:55:01.430 --> 00:55:02.730
I tell you what we're going to
do, we're going to buy guitars

00:55:02.730 --> 00:55:04.030
and we're going to play
this shit whether you

00:55:04.030 --> 00:55:05.330
like it or not."

00:55:05.330 --> 00:55:06.630
I think there was a bit of
that in there, you know.

00:55:06.630 --> 00:55:07.930
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:55:07.930 --> 00:55:09.230
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Because they
had been deprived for so long.

00:55:09.230 --> 00:55:10.530
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Yeah.

00:55:10.530 --> 00:55:11.830
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Of the
sort of comforts of life

00:55:11.830 --> 00:55:14.250
and now they had some money
to spend, and they were able

00:55:14.250 --> 00:55:17.540
through that to define
themselves.

00:55:17.540 --> 00:55:20.460
That's how first teenagers
and they define themselves,

00:55:20.460 --> 00:55:22.500
for the young men
they define themselves

00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:24.090
by playing the guitar.

00:55:24.090 --> 00:55:27.560
They become visible; a different
culture from their parents

00:55:27.560 --> 00:55:29.910
and for the young women,
they define themselves

00:55:29.910 --> 00:55:32.860
by colonizing the coffee
bars, the cappuccino bars.

00:55:32.860 --> 00:55:34.400
They go into those spaces.

00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:37.980
They want their own social
space and they don't want to go

00:55:37.980 --> 00:55:40.010
into tea rooms with the mums
still come and they can't go

00:55:40.010 --> 00:55:41.640
in a pub on their
own without geezers,

00:55:41.640 --> 00:55:45.250
so they go into the cappuccino
bars and what's significant

00:55:45.250 --> 00:55:49.330
about that, is that the
cappuccino bars are looking

00:55:49.330 --> 00:55:52.450
to Milan and Paris and Rome.

00:55:52.450 --> 00:55:53.810
They're not looking at New York.

00:55:53.810 --> 00:55:56.830
It's quite sophisticated
for that time, you know.

00:55:56.830 --> 00:56:01.290
This is Jean Seberg, Robert
[phonetic], and Marilyn Monroe.

00:56:01.290 --> 00:56:05.150
I think that, that's how the
young women turned their back

00:56:05.150 --> 00:56:07.070
on what had been predominantly

00:56:07.070 --> 00:56:09.980
since the 30s really an
American-based culture

00:56:09.980 --> 00:56:11.490
and they looked towards Europe.

00:56:11.490 --> 00:56:14.110
That's how they defined
themselves as different.

00:56:14.110 --> 00:56:17.810
So, these, this context
is really important

00:56:17.810 --> 00:56:21.090
for that first generation to
sort of say, "We are different

00:56:21.090 --> 00:56:23.180
and this is how we're going
to express our difference."

00:56:23.180 --> 00:56:24.810
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: But a really
interesting point that you make

00:56:24.810 --> 00:56:26.670
in the book and that
you just made here

00:56:26.670 --> 00:56:29.910
which I think seems weird
to modern people is the idea

00:56:29.910 --> 00:56:32.610
that this was the first
generation of teenagers;

00:56:32.610 --> 00:56:35.530
that teenagers, as a thing,
didn't exist before that.

00:56:35.530 --> 00:56:36.830
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: No, no.

00:56:36.830 --> 00:56:40.770
And in some ways, even
after 55 for middleclass

00:56:40.770 --> 00:56:43.990
and upper class kids,
teenagers still didn't exist,

00:56:43.990 --> 00:56:47.820
because what happened for the
middle class kids they tended

00:56:47.820 --> 00:56:51.220
to go to university and
then into professions

00:56:51.220 --> 00:56:53.580
which deferred earnings until
they were adults, you know,

00:56:53.580 --> 00:56:56.340
law or medicine or
something like that.

00:56:56.340 --> 00:56:58.840
So, that; because the
thing that you know

00:56:58.840 --> 00:57:01.960
as always what defines
teenagers is what they buy,

00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:05.110
what they consume, what they
wear, you know, their style.

00:57:05.110 --> 00:57:08.150
So, this was the first time
working class youth had been

00:57:08.150 --> 00:57:10.090
visible to popular culture.

00:57:10.090 --> 00:57:13.880
If we look between the
wars, there are teenagers,

00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:16.880
the flappers and that, but
they are almost all upper class

00:57:16.880 --> 00:57:20.400
or middleclass girls who are
visible to the mainstream media

00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:23.360
of the day, you know, working
class youth are just you know

00:57:23.360 --> 00:57:26.250
they're just a blur, they're not
really; they may have some sort

00:57:26.250 --> 00:57:30.310
of culture, but you don't
really see it, you don't really,

00:57:30.310 --> 00:57:32.110
it's not a, it's not
a mainstream culture.

00:57:32.110 --> 00:57:35.100
The thing about skiffle
is it's in, it's straight

00:57:35.100 --> 00:57:36.790
down the mainstream, you
know, it kind of breaks

00:57:36.790 --> 00:57:39.460
into public consciousness
in a way

00:57:39.460 --> 00:57:41.810
that youth culture
had never done before.

00:57:41.810 --> 00:57:44.510
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Even with
guitars, the 'Skiffle Junior.'

00:57:44.510 --> 00:57:45.810
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Yeah.

00:57:45.810 --> 00:57:47.110
Toy guitars.

00:57:47.110 --> 00:57:48.410
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Did you ever
see one of them and hold it?

00:57:48.410 --> 00:57:49.710
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: I've seen,

00:57:49.710 --> 00:57:51.010
yes I have seen a
'Skiflle Junior' guitar.

00:57:51.010 --> 00:57:54.360
There's one in a record shop in
Demark Street in London going

00:57:54.360 --> 00:57:57.110
up on a wall in a
record shop there.

00:57:57.110 --> 00:57:58.410
And.

00:57:58.410 --> 00:57:59.710
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: This
is the one with the ears?

00:57:59.710 --> 00:58:01.010
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Yeah.

00:58:01.010 --> 00:58:02.310
Of course, they're all the
ones with the ears yeah.

00:58:02.310 --> 00:58:04.670
It's got ears on it because
it was originally a Mickey

00:58:04.670 --> 00:58:05.970
Mouse guitar.

00:58:05.970 --> 00:58:07.270
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

00:58:07.270 --> 00:58:10.260
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Made as a Disney
spinoff and then they kind

00:58:10.260 --> 00:58:13.150
of repurpose it by putting
illustrations in the ears,

00:58:13.150 --> 00:58:15.930
the [inaudible] ears; the
body of the guitar it looks

00:58:15.930 --> 00:58:19.640
like Mickey Mouse's face face-on
and it's more like a ukulele

00:58:19.640 --> 00:58:22.820
than a guitar, it's only got 4
strings and it's a toll wreck

00:58:22.820 --> 00:58:24.850
of getting tuned, but yeah.

00:58:24.850 --> 00:58:28.330
Everybody, it was a total craze;
it was a really skiffle was more

00:58:28.330 --> 00:58:29.690
like the, you know the
fidget spinners things

00:58:29.690 --> 00:58:30.990
that going on in the moment.

00:58:30.990 --> 00:58:32.290
You aware of that
in the playgrounds?

00:58:32.290 --> 00:58:33.590
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:58:33.590 --> 00:58:34.890
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Yeah.

00:58:34.890 --> 00:58:36.190
It was much more like that

00:58:36.190 --> 00:58:37.490
than it was punk rock
in the way it grew.

00:58:37.490 --> 00:58:38.790
You know, it was a craze.

00:58:38.790 --> 00:58:41.580
Every sentient school boy could
play 3 chords on the guitar,

00:58:41.580 --> 00:58:44.300
and what's significant
about that,

00:58:44.300 --> 00:58:47.310
is that when Chuck Berry comes
along 5 months later playing

00:58:47.310 --> 00:58:50.910
guitar like ringing a bell,
everyone can play his repertoire

00:58:50.910 --> 00:58:55.610
and then what happens then is
that the, when your teenagers,

00:58:55.610 --> 00:58:57.610
because of that, our
teenagers have learned this

00:58:57.610 --> 00:58:59.840
when they're 13-14-15.

00:58:59.840 --> 00:59:02.180
When your teenagers are
thinking about playing guitars

00:59:02.180 --> 00:59:06.150
when they're 17-18-19, they
contend with our teenagers,

00:59:06.150 --> 00:59:07.450
they're already in Hamburg.

00:59:07.450 --> 00:59:08.750
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

00:59:08.750 --> 00:59:10.050
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: They're
already in Hamburg.

00:59:10.050 --> 00:59:12.430
So, what happens is when The
Beatles break America in 64,

00:59:12.430 --> 00:59:16.080
there's a whole cohort of
road-hardened bands ready

00:59:16.080 --> 00:59:18.810
to come piling in and take
the American charts by storm

00:59:18.810 --> 00:59:20.950
and it's skiffle that gives
our kids that [inaudible]

00:59:20.950 --> 00:59:25.590
after 2 years edge on your
teenagers who were kind

00:59:25.590 --> 00:59:27.820
of playing guitars, but
they're not writing songs

00:59:27.820 --> 00:59:29.120
and they're not, you
know, they're kind

00:59:29.120 --> 00:59:30.420
of playing the pops of the day.

00:59:30.420 --> 00:59:32.490
They're not thinking of
it as a, as a career.

00:59:32.490 --> 00:59:36.290
Where our kids have already
focused on flying, you know.

00:59:36.290 --> 00:59:38.020
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah, what
was the George Harrison quote

00:59:38.020 --> 00:59:40.440
that you mentioned that
connects skiffle, right,

00:59:40.440 --> 00:59:41.910
with, with rock and roll?

00:59:41.910 --> 00:59:43.340
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: It's one of
my favorite quotes actually.

00:59:43.340 --> 00:59:46.070
George Harrison was asked if
The Beatles were influenced

00:59:46.070 --> 00:59:49.190
by the blues, and he said,
"Yeah, of course we were.

00:59:49.190 --> 00:59:51.810
No Lead Belly, nNo
Lonnie Donegan,

00:59:51.810 --> 00:59:53.930
no Lonnie Donegan, no Beatles."

00:59:53.930 --> 00:59:57.640
And that sort of sums
it up really, you know.

00:59:57.640 --> 00:59:59.990
That sums up how
the process worked

00:59:59.990 --> 01:00:04.710
and how skiffle was the kind of
nursery for the British invasion

01:00:04.710 --> 01:00:10.950
of the American charts
between, between 1964

01:00:10.950 --> 01:00:13.330
when The Beatles had their first
number 1 in January and the end

01:00:13.330 --> 01:00:17.370
of 65, there's a British
group at number 1 in America

01:00:17.370 --> 01:00:19.610
for 52 weeks out of 104.

01:00:19.610 --> 01:00:20.910
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Wow.

01:00:20.910 --> 01:00:22.210
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: And
every single one

01:00:22.210 --> 01:00:23.510
of those bands was originally
a skiffle group apart

01:00:23.510 --> 01:00:25.300
from Petula Clark
who is the exception,

01:00:25.300 --> 01:00:27.240
because she when rock
[inaudible] she had kind

01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:28.540
of actually already put

01:00:28.540 --> 01:00:29.840
out a dozen singles
under her own name.

01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:31.350
She didn't need Lonnie
Donegan to.

01:00:31.350 --> 01:00:32.980
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: But there
are some women in skiffle.

01:00:32.980 --> 01:00:34.280
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: There are.

01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:35.580
There are some women in

01:00:35.580 --> 01:00:36.880
and important women,
very important women.

01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:38.810
Nancy Whiskey who sings
"Freight Train" which was a hit

01:00:38.810 --> 01:00:43.230
in the United States, as well
as, in the UK; Hilda Simms

01:00:43.230 --> 01:00:47.580
and Shirley Bland in the City
Ramblers absolute key aspects

01:00:47.580 --> 01:00:53.500
of that, but what they are a lot
of, because the skifflers were

01:00:53.500 --> 01:01:00.470
so young, 98% of them never
made in the recordings.

01:01:00.470 --> 01:01:03.050
It just, it was skiffle was
gone by the time they were,

01:01:03.050 --> 01:01:05.630
they were still playing.

01:01:05.630 --> 01:01:09.550
So what is left is loads
and loads and loads of black

01:01:09.550 --> 01:01:12.870
and white photographs of Kalo
[phonetic] youths playing,

01:01:12.870 --> 01:01:18.120
you know, cheap old
guitars and tea-chest bass.

01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:21.370
There are literally
every local newspaper

01:01:21.370 --> 01:01:24.630
in the UK has a file
full of these bands,

01:01:24.630 --> 01:01:26.760
because they were big
news in the, you know,

01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:29.140
in the 50s, so a good copy.

01:01:29.140 --> 01:01:31.220
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: And they
were, they were having a ball.

01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:32.520
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: They
were having a ball.

01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:33.820
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Yeah.

01:01:33.820 --> 01:01:35.120
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: But I've seen
loads and loads and loads

01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:36.420
of those pictures and I don't
think I've seen a handful

01:01:36.420 --> 01:01:38.040
of women in any of
those pictures.

01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:40.460
One or 2 bands have,
might have a woman

01:01:40.460 --> 01:01:42.860
at the back playing
the tea-chest bass.

01:01:42.860 --> 01:01:47.100
I did one, come across
an entire band of women,

01:01:47.100 --> 01:01:51.710
but on a closer inspection they
were actually RS travelers.

01:01:51.710 --> 01:01:53.970
It was the mom and
the 3 daughters

01:01:53.970 --> 01:01:56.500
and they were just dressing up
playing skiffle for the picture.

01:01:56.500 --> 01:02:00.620
There's a story attached to
it, and I don't know why,

01:02:00.620 --> 01:02:10.800
but it was something that really
connected with, with kids.

01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:15.710
It may be that it was guys
who were playing guitars;

01:02:15.710 --> 01:02:17.640
I saw where it was
Lead Belly, or Broonzy,

01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:20.090
or Elvis, or Bill Halley.

01:02:20.090 --> 01:02:21.390
There weren't, you know,

01:02:21.390 --> 01:02:23.570
there was no Wonder
Jacks' in the UK, you know.

01:02:23.570 --> 01:02:24.870
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Exactly.

01:02:24.870 --> 01:02:26.170
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: So,
there wasn't,

01:02:26.170 --> 01:02:29.550
the girl singers were you know
mostly singing with big bands

01:02:29.550 --> 01:02:32.920
like Petula Clark and
they were, you know,

01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:35.950
I have to say they were
rather sort of simpering.

01:02:35.950 --> 01:02:39.740
Whereas, the guitar players were
outcasts; they were dynamic;

01:02:39.740 --> 01:02:41.040
they were roustabouts.

01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:42.340
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Yes.

01:02:42.340 --> 01:02:43.640
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: And
you can see that sort

01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:44.940
of attachment for that.

01:02:44.940 --> 01:02:46.240
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Yeah.

01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:47.540
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: And it's hard
to go back and, it's very hard

01:02:47.540 --> 01:02:48.890
to go back and get into the
mindset of what it would be

01:02:48.890 --> 01:02:50.380
like to hear rock online
for the first time.

01:02:50.380 --> 01:02:51.680
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:52.980
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: We're
so, we're so you know,

01:02:52.980 --> 01:02:54.280
we're so past that, you know.

01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:55.580
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Yeah.

01:02:55.580 --> 01:02:56.880
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: We've not
lived down to our lives

01:02:56.880 --> 01:02:58.180
in a time of ration and war.

01:02:58.180 --> 01:03:01.760
We've not had to listen to the
everything mediated by the BBC

01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:04.990
and rationed out to us,
so it's hard to get back.

01:03:04.990 --> 01:03:08.800
You can only really sort of try
and look at what the evidence is

01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:10.220
and extrapolate how and why.

01:03:10.220 --> 01:03:12.830
So, I may totally be
wrong, but I do believe

01:03:12.830 --> 01:03:15.700
that young women were a key
driving force in skiffle,

01:03:15.700 --> 01:03:18.220
because their colonization

01:03:18.220 --> 01:03:21.170
of the coffee bars is what draws
skiffle into the coffee bars

01:03:21.170 --> 01:03:22.470
and it's only when skiffle comes

01:03:22.470 --> 01:03:23.780
into coffee bars
it really starts

01:03:23.780 --> 01:03:25.150
to evolve into rock and roll.

01:03:25.150 --> 01:03:26.450
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Yeah.

01:03:26.450 --> 01:03:27.750
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: In that sense,
in terms of British rock

01:03:27.750 --> 01:03:32.270
and roll, skiffle is kind of
the noise you hear on the track

01:03:32.270 --> 01:03:34.320
when a train is coming
in a tube station.

01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:38.970
That's what skiffle is
to British rock and roll.

01:03:38.970 --> 01:03:40.270
It's the standalone thing.

01:03:40.270 --> 01:03:41.570
It's a completely
different thing.

01:03:41.570 --> 01:03:44.190
It's not, it wasn't supposed
to lead to rock and roll,

01:03:44.190 --> 01:03:46.020
but that's the role it plays.

01:03:46.020 --> 01:03:48.790
It kind of lets you
know it's coming

01:03:48.790 --> 01:03:50.380
and it's coming soon, you know.

01:03:50.380 --> 01:03:52.460
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: And
what about Stan Freberg

01:03:52.460 --> 01:03:54.110
and His Sniffle Group?

01:03:54.110 --> 01:03:57.550
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Well, this is
another very interesting thing.

01:03:57.550 --> 01:04:00.880
When Lonnie Donegan has a
hit in the United States

01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:03.350
of America with, with his
version of "Rock Island Line",

01:04:03.350 --> 01:04:06.900
the great Stan Freberg
does a Mickey-take record

01:04:06.900 --> 01:04:08.470
of it, joking with it.

01:04:08.470 --> 01:04:09.770
But what's significant

01:04:09.770 --> 01:04:13.120
about that is the flipside
is a Mickey-take of Elvis

01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:15.600
and Donegan and Elvis again.

01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:16.900
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

01:04:16.900 --> 01:04:18.520
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: They're
as equals as far

01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:21.450
as Stan was concerned, you
know, and Donegan significantly,

01:04:21.450 --> 01:04:25.520
Donegan was marketed in the US
in 56 as the Irish Hillbilly.

01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:27.600
He was neither Irish, he was
actually born in Scotland.

01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:28.900
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Exactly.

01:04:28.900 --> 01:04:30.200
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: And
lived most of his life

01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:32.930
in London nor was a
hillbilly, but the significance

01:04:32.930 --> 01:04:36.260
of that term is that at the time
Elvis Presley was being called a

01:04:36.260 --> 01:04:38.900
Hillbilly Cat, so this
was putting Donegan

01:04:38.900 --> 01:04:42.160
in the same category,
the Hillbilly category

01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:46.940
and I mean even people
like, you know,

01:04:46.940 --> 01:04:49.520
Slim Whitman was
called a hillbilly.

01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:52.650
Anyone with a guitar at the time
in the charts was a hillbilly.

01:04:52.650 --> 01:04:54.300
It was hillbilly
music, the guitar.

01:04:54.300 --> 01:04:55.600
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Wow.

01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:56.900
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Yeah.

01:04:56.900 --> 01:05:00.570
The jazz magazines in Britain
dismissed Donegan having a hit

01:05:00.570 --> 01:05:01.960
with "Rock Island Line" in terms

01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:04.430
of his dreadful hillbilly music
that's coming from America.

01:05:04.430 --> 01:05:07.810
Bobby [inaudible], Slim
Whitman, and you know,

01:05:07.810 --> 01:05:11.060
a Tennessee Ernie
Ford "Sixteen Tons."

01:05:11.060 --> 01:05:15.890
There was a number of hits
in 55 sort of cowboy songs

01:05:15.890 --> 01:05:20.960
that are going to the charts and
the jazzers saw Donegan as parts

01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:23.570
of that and it may be why
"Rock Island Line" was put

01:05:23.570 --> 01:05:27.790
out that Decca Records
were looking for someone

01:05:27.790 --> 01:05:31.120
to match these guys, because
all the British singers were,

01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:33.580
even they were singing
country songs,

01:05:33.580 --> 01:05:36.800
would wear a dinner jacket and
a bow tie and they had no one

01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:40.490
who looked like, you know, they
kind of ridden off the plains

01:05:40.490 --> 01:05:44.090
and that's Donegan, and that
might have been, you know,

01:05:44.090 --> 01:05:46.210
that might have been some of the
reason why, because as I said,

01:05:46.210 --> 01:05:48.500
it was originally recorded in
the context of a jazz record

01:05:48.500 --> 01:05:54.610
in 1954 and then suddenly
gets released in late 1955.

01:05:54.610 --> 01:05:56.430
Obviously it had "rock"
in the title and "Rock

01:05:56.430 --> 01:05:57.730
Around the Clock"
had been a hit,

01:05:57.730 --> 01:05:59.030
so it might have been
something to do with that.

01:05:59.030 --> 01:06:02.050
But it really is a complete
fluke, no one sat down

01:06:02.050 --> 01:06:04.800
and said right, let's have
a skiffle before, you know,

01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:06.100
the skiffle burst, no.

01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:07.410
It's not, it's not like that.

01:06:07.410 --> 01:06:10.290
In fact, the actual
record the 10-inch single

01:06:10.290 --> 01:06:13.420
of "Rock Island Line" says the
word "jazz" on the label twice.

01:06:13.420 --> 01:06:14.720
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Wow.

01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:17.550
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: So, you
know and it's a, you know,

01:06:17.550 --> 01:06:21.630
an American folk song
sung by a blues guy,

01:06:21.630 --> 01:06:22.930
I mean you know, it's kind of.

01:06:22.930 --> 01:06:24.230
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:25.530
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Although,

01:06:25.530 --> 01:06:27.700
but the way it comes together
it's all just classic sort

01:06:27.700 --> 01:06:29.000
of cut-cut thing.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.300
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

01:06:30.300 --> 01:06:31.600
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: And it's
interesting, at one point

01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:34.070
in the book you describe
Fred Hellerman.

01:06:34.070 --> 01:06:35.370
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Yeah,
poor old Fred.

01:06:35.370 --> 01:06:36.910
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Right on
stage with Lonnie Donegan.

01:06:36.910 --> 01:06:38.210
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Yeah.

01:06:38.210 --> 01:06:39.510
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy:
And then what happens?

01:06:39.510 --> 01:06:41.130
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Well, when
Donegan comes to the US,

01:06:41.130 --> 01:06:45.500
although the band aren't
touring, American musicians tour

01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:48.940
in the UK and the UK
musicians tour in the US.

01:06:48.940 --> 01:06:50.240
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Because
the embargos were lifted.

01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:51.540
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Yeah, the
embargo has ended, yeah.

01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:52.840
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Yeah.

01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:54.140
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: In 55.

01:06:54.140 --> 01:06:55.440
Donegan's one of the first
to benefit from that.

01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:56.740
He's not allowed to
bring his guitar.

01:06:56.740 --> 01:06:58.040
He's not allowed
to play his guitar.

01:06:58.040 --> 01:07:00.300
The AFN won't let
him play his guitar.

01:07:00.300 --> 01:07:01.600
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy:
Can you imagine?

01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:02.900
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Yeah, exactly.

01:07:02.900 --> 01:07:04.200
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: So he has
to hire someone to play guitar

01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:05.500
for him [multiple speakers]?

01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:06.800
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: He has
to hire someone to play.

01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:08.680
On the Ed Sullivan Show the guy
who plays guitar in the band

01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:11.420
on the Ed Sullivan Show is the
same guy who plays the intro

01:07:11.420 --> 01:07:13.360
to Mrs. Robinson by
Simon and Garfunkel.

01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:14.660
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Oh my.

01:07:14.660 --> 01:07:15.960
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: That's a
sort of side fact there.

01:07:15.960 --> 01:07:22.970
But yeah, he does a kind of a
stand supper club in Brooklyn

01:07:22.970 --> 01:07:25.690
and they get Fred Hellerman
to come and play for him;

01:07:25.690 --> 01:07:27.110
Fred Hellerman from the Weavers.

01:07:27.110 --> 01:07:28.410
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Yes.

01:07:28.410 --> 01:07:29.710
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: I suppose

01:07:29.710 --> 01:07:31.010
because he's singing
Lead Belly songs.

01:07:31.010 --> 01:07:32.910
Fred Hellerman, you
know, I mean he played

01:07:32.910 --> 01:07:37.590
at Lead Belly's funeral, I mean
he knew Lead Belly very well,

01:07:37.590 --> 01:07:39.300
but he didn't really appreciate

01:07:39.300 --> 01:07:41.210
of what Lonnie was
doing with his songs.

01:07:41.210 --> 01:07:43.270
So, Lonnie's wife
singing was to speed up;

01:07:43.270 --> 01:07:44.570
that was his whole thing.

01:07:44.570 --> 01:07:46.380
That's what made him so
exciting to the British kids

01:07:46.380 --> 01:07:48.440
to get a kind of runaway
train theme to it.

01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:50.380
Hellerman didn't like that.

01:07:50.380 --> 01:07:51.680
He didn't like that,

01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:53.580
so or actually he suddenly
passed away last year,

01:07:53.580 --> 01:07:57.310
but I spoke to him
before he passed away

01:07:57.310 --> 01:07:59.980
and he didn't like
Lonnie at all.

01:07:59.980 --> 01:08:02.980
He didn't like him and
I can understand that,

01:08:02.980 --> 01:08:05.530
because you know, he said
he didn't you know he didn't

01:08:05.530 --> 01:08:08.530
respect the material and the
audience didn't respect it

01:08:08.530 --> 01:08:10.310
and I, you know.

01:08:10.310 --> 01:08:11.700
It's understandable.

01:08:11.700 --> 01:08:13.000
The audience who came

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:15.060
to see Donegan were Elvis'
audience; there weren't.

01:08:15.060 --> 01:08:16.360
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

01:08:16.360 --> 01:08:17.830
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Lead Belly and
the Weavers audience you know.

01:08:17.830 --> 01:08:21.340
So, what happens is Lead
Belly, Donegan goes out on tour

01:08:21.340 --> 01:08:24.210
on a rock and roll tour with
Chuck Berry and Clyde McPhatter

01:08:24.210 --> 01:08:28.130
and a lot of other bands, and
he's allowed to play the guitar

01:08:28.130 --> 01:08:31.550
but he has to, he's
backed up the pit orchestra

01:08:31.550 --> 01:08:32.850
in every place they play.

01:08:32.850 --> 01:08:36.400
They played 11 shows a day and
he plays 2 songs starting at 11

01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:41.030
in the morning, no food
until nighttime and he,

01:08:41.030 --> 01:08:44.010
he's not getting on
very well with this.

01:08:44.010 --> 01:08:47.020
And when they get to
Detroit the, Johnny Burnette

01:08:47.020 --> 01:08:48.320
from the Rock and Roll Trio,

01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:50.350
perhaps the greatest rockabilly
band that side of Sunshine

01:08:50.350 --> 01:08:53.150
and Elvis to ever perform,
say to him "Listen man,

01:08:53.150 --> 01:08:55.320
why don't you let us back you
up on these songs, you know,

01:08:55.320 --> 01:08:56.650
because we love what
you're doing."

01:08:56.650 --> 01:09:00.570
And Donegan was like "Oh,
I couldn't afford that."

01:09:00.570 --> 01:09:02.100
And Johnny Burnette says, "Man,

01:09:02.100 --> 01:09:06.030
it's not about money
just let us back you up."

01:09:06.030 --> 01:09:07.330
So, they do.

01:09:07.330 --> 01:09:08.710
They work together and I
think this is significant

01:09:08.710 --> 01:09:13.270
that skiffle meets
rockabilly in 56 in Detroit

01:09:13.270 --> 01:09:16.300
and they recognize one
another as kings, you know,

01:09:16.300 --> 01:09:19.200
and the fit together like
hand and glove, you know.

01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:22.250
And in some ways rockabilly
is similar to skiffle

01:09:22.250 --> 01:09:26.060
in that it too was
superseded by rock and roll.

01:09:26.060 --> 01:09:29.150
What we said, rockabilly needs
no drums, percussive bass,

01:09:29.150 --> 01:09:33.180
a couple of guitars you know, no
piano and those kinds of things.

01:09:33.180 --> 01:09:35.230
But what is significant
about skiffle in terms

01:09:35.230 --> 01:09:37.240
of what happened in
the United States

01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:42.150
of America why skiffle isn't
the same, it's not you know,

01:09:42.150 --> 01:09:45.800
because there are artists
who were inspired by that.

01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:49.990
I mean, Dave Van Ronk and some
friends make a skiffle album

01:09:49.990 --> 01:09:52.310
inspired by "Rock Island
Line" that's really more

01:09:52.310 --> 01:09:54.190
or less a junk band album.

01:09:54.190 --> 01:09:57.520
So, you can say that it was
influenced, but what is missing,

01:09:57.520 --> 01:09:59.620
the significant thing that is
missing in the United States

01:09:59.620 --> 01:10:03.040
of America to make skiffle
an indigenous British thing,

01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:04.440
is an entire cohort

01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:06.850
of 12-year-olds playing
Lead Belly songs.

01:10:06.850 --> 01:10:08.180
You never, you never had that.

01:10:08.180 --> 01:10:09.690
And I'm not saying
that out of disrespect,

01:10:09.690 --> 01:10:10.990
I'm just saying this
is the thing.

01:10:10.990 --> 01:10:12.290
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Yeah.

01:10:12.290 --> 01:10:13.980
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: That makes
skiffle different and special.

01:10:13.980 --> 01:10:15.690
That's missing in the
United States of America.

01:10:15.690 --> 01:10:20.540
I can't think of any 50s
movement that had that kind

01:10:20.540 --> 01:10:25.040
of reach so far into youth
culture as skiffle did,

01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:26.340
because that's the
most significant thing

01:10:26.340 --> 01:10:27.640
about skiffle as well.

01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:30.420
It's not what happened
in 55-56-57,

01:10:30.420 --> 01:10:33.830
it's what happens
in 64-65-66-67.

01:10:33.830 --> 01:10:35.460
That's the significance of it.

01:10:35.460 --> 01:10:36.970
It's what they go on to do.

01:10:36.970 --> 01:10:38.270
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Yeah.

01:10:38.270 --> 01:10:39.570
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: And I don't
think there's, you know,

01:10:39.570 --> 01:10:41.740
you may know better than
me, but I can't think of a,

01:10:41.740 --> 01:10:46.250
of a genre in American music
that had that same dynamic.

01:10:46.250 --> 01:10:47.550
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
Like prepared kids for.

01:10:47.550 --> 01:10:48.850
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: That dynamic.

01:10:48.850 --> 01:10:50.150
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah, yeah.

01:10:50.150 --> 01:10:51.450
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Yeah, so
I mean you know it's all,

01:10:51.450 --> 01:10:52.750
and it hasn't happened
since in my country.

01:10:52.750 --> 01:10:54.210
It was a, it was a unique moment

01:10:54.210 --> 01:10:59.870
and that's the real reason why
we need to understand skiffle

01:10:59.870 --> 01:11:01.170
and appreciate skiffle.

01:11:01.170 --> 01:11:03.020
It has that depth to it.

01:11:03.020 --> 01:11:05.310
It's not just a guy
made a record and.

01:11:05.310 --> 01:11:06.610
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

01:11:06.610 --> 01:11:07.910
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: By
The Beatles, you know.

01:11:07.910 --> 01:11:09.210
It was just the usual
way the story is told.

01:11:09.210 --> 01:11:10.510
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

01:11:10.510 --> 01:11:11.990
Well, let's talk a little
bit about the process

01:11:11.990 --> 01:11:15.410
of writing the book
of doing a book.

01:11:15.410 --> 01:11:18.910
So, one of the things
that I found interesting

01:11:18.910 --> 01:11:22.560
in your description to me
was your use of social media

01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:24.340
to connect with former
skifflers.

01:11:24.340 --> 01:11:25.640
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Yeah.

01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:27.980
That was, that was
really great that was,

01:11:27.980 --> 01:11:31.780
because there's a photographic
archive of some of which I use

01:11:31.780 --> 01:11:33.090
in the book that
was put together

01:11:33.090 --> 01:11:38.670
by a guy called Eric Winsor
who ran a folk magazine,

01:11:38.670 --> 01:11:41.880
and that had been inherited
by Ian Anderson at Folk Roots

01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:44.770
and he has a really great
Facebook page where he puts

01:11:44.770 --> 01:11:48.400
up all these old photographs and
he had a specific skiffle album

01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:51.860
which had some lovely
pictures of Jack Elliott,

01:11:51.860 --> 01:11:56.390
Big Bill Broonzy, and the City
Ramblers and all these guys

01:11:56.390 --> 01:12:01.310
and at the, at the Skiffle and
Blues Club, the original Skiffle

01:12:01.310 --> 01:12:03.700
and Blues Club and, of
course, under these photographs

01:12:03.700 --> 01:12:07.310
in the conversation there were
people saying "I was there."

01:12:07.310 --> 01:12:08.610
You know, "I remember these.

01:12:08.610 --> 01:12:09.910
That's me in the corner."

01:12:09.910 --> 01:12:11.210
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: My goodness.

01:12:11.210 --> 01:12:12.510
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: You
know, I'm like,

01:12:12.510 --> 01:12:13.810
so I just contacted
those people.

01:12:13.810 --> 01:12:15.110
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

01:12:15.110 --> 01:12:16.410
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: And was able
to go interview them and find

01:12:16.410 --> 01:12:17.710
out from their perspective
what was going

01:12:17.710 --> 01:12:20.180
on which I don't think I would
been able to do otherwise.

01:12:20.180 --> 01:12:24.870
But also, I did a lot
of research on eBay.

01:12:24.870 --> 01:12:26.230
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

01:12:26.230 --> 01:12:29.420
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: British eBay,
In the UK if you put "skiffle"

01:12:29.420 --> 01:12:33.460
into the search engine and
"vinyl" it throws up all EPs

01:12:33.460 --> 01:12:35.920
because they're, you know,
they're cheap as chips

01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:37.220
and I was interested in them.

01:12:37.220 --> 01:12:40.250
You can pick them
for you know a fiver.

01:12:40.250 --> 01:12:41.550
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Wow.

01:12:41.550 --> 01:12:43.440
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: And because
skiffle comes at a time

01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:46.650
when they were moving
between the 10-inch 78 format

01:12:46.650 --> 01:12:49.560
to the 7-inch vinyl format

01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:53.020
and so what I did was
every time Donegan put

01:12:53.020 --> 01:12:56.410
out 2 singles they complied
them on to an EP and put it

01:12:56.410 --> 01:12:57.710
out in the 7-inch version.

01:12:57.710 --> 01:12:59.390
And to encourage
people to buy it,

01:12:59.390 --> 01:13:03.030
it comes in a very nice picture
sleeve with a lot of details

01:13:03.030 --> 01:13:04.690
on the back; a lot
of information

01:13:04.690 --> 01:13:06.420
where it's recorded
and stuff like that.

01:13:06.420 --> 01:13:08.920
So, there's a lot of these
skiffle EPs out there

01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:12.330
and it was very, very helpful
for chronology and dating

01:13:12.330 --> 01:13:14.390
and you know who
played what and so.

01:13:14.390 --> 01:13:15.690
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: So
people scan the whole sleeve

01:13:15.690 --> 01:13:16.990
[multiple speakers].

01:13:16.990 --> 01:13:18.290
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Of course,
they're trying to search it.

01:13:18.290 --> 01:13:19.590
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
Yeah, right, yeah.

01:13:19.590 --> 01:13:20.890
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Yeah,
[multiple speakers].

01:13:20.890 --> 01:13:22.190
Sometimes they scan the label.

01:13:22.190 --> 01:13:23.490
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

01:13:23.490 --> 01:13:24.790
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: That's
even better.

01:13:24.790 --> 01:13:26.090
So, yeah that was
you know the amount

01:13:26.090 --> 01:13:27.390
of screenshots I got from, I
probably got more screenshots

01:13:27.390 --> 01:13:28.690
from skiffle than I did
from the British library.

01:13:28.690 --> 01:13:29.990
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

01:13:29.990 --> 01:13:31.290
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: It's
funny isn't it?

01:13:31.290 --> 01:13:32.590
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: That is,
that's really strange right

01:13:32.590 --> 01:13:33.890
&gt;&gt;

01:13:33.890 --> 01:13:35.190
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: That's
really strange.

01:13:35.190 --> 01:13:36.490
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: And
'Pete' Frame, he has.

01:13:36.490 --> 01:13:37.790
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Yeah,

01:13:37.790 --> 01:13:39.090
'Pete' Frame is a key
character for me in this.

01:13:39.090 --> 01:13:40.390
He wrote a book called
"A Restless Generation."

01:13:40.390 --> 01:13:41.800
'Pete' Frame is famous in
the UK for constructing rock

01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:43.350
and roll family trees.

01:13:43.350 --> 01:13:44.650
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Yes.

01:13:44.650 --> 01:13:45.950
Handwritten.

01:13:45.950 --> 01:13:47.250
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Handwritten.

01:13:47.250 --> 01:13:48.550
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Those
are amazing, yeah, yeah.

01:13:48.550 --> 01:13:49.850
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Yeah.

01:13:49.850 --> 01:13:51.150
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: My
favorite one he did,

01:13:51.150 --> 01:13:52.450
he did a Billy Bragg once.

01:13:52.450 --> 01:13:53.750
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Very nice.

01:13:53.750 --> 01:13:55.050
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Which
was just me.

01:13:55.050 --> 01:13:56.350
Just me in the middle.

01:13:56.350 --> 01:13:57.650
It just said "Billy
Bragg guitar, vocal."

01:13:57.650 --> 01:13:58.950
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: That's nice.

01:13:58.950 --> 01:14:00.250
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: But
he gave that a number,

01:14:00.250 --> 01:14:01.550
because he gives them all
numbers and everything.

01:14:01.550 --> 01:14:02.850
He did it for a songbook
of mine,

01:14:02.850 --> 01:14:04.150
Billy Bragg family
tree, just me on my own.

01:14:04.150 --> 01:14:05.450
I was so proud of it, yeah.

01:14:05.450 --> 01:14:06.750
And he's a lovely geezer, so
he's a lovely geezer and he's,

01:14:06.750 --> 01:14:08.050
he wrote "The Restless
Generation"

01:14:08.050 --> 01:14:10.250
which is probably the
best book on that period

01:14:10.250 --> 01:14:12.860
in our musical history.

01:14:12.860 --> 01:14:14.730
And he dealt with skiffle,

01:14:14.730 --> 01:14:19.030
but he didn't follow Ken
Colyer to New Orleans.

01:14:19.030 --> 01:14:22.700
He referred to that and he, you
know, he put all the characters

01:14:22.700 --> 01:14:25.090
in there and it was a
guiding light for me,

01:14:25.090 --> 01:14:27.730
but I kind of took a chunk
of what he was doing and dug

01:14:27.730 --> 01:14:30.100
down from there,
you know, dug down.

01:14:30.100 --> 01:14:33.560
And some, well a couple of the
reviews have compared my book

01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:34.860
to "The Restless Generation"

01:14:34.860 --> 01:14:36.190
and I'll tell you
that's a great honor.

01:14:36.190 --> 01:14:37.490
A real honor.

01:14:37.490 --> 01:14:39.260
And there's a couple of
good books on skiffle,

01:14:39.260 --> 01:14:41.890
one written by Chas
McDevitt whose skiffle inside

01:14:41.890 --> 01:14:43.190
of the story.

01:14:43.190 --> 01:14:45.870
Chas was actually a rival of
Donegans and he had a hit with

01:14:45.870 --> 01:14:48.100
"Freight Train" here in the
US and another one called the

01:14:48.100 --> 01:14:52.890
"The Skiffle Craze" by
Mike Dewe who's an academic

01:14:52.890 --> 01:14:56.110
at the University
of Aberystwyth,

01:14:56.110 --> 01:15:00.440
but both of them experienced
skiffle and their books are

01:15:00.440 --> 01:15:02.690
from the perspective of
someone who was there.

01:15:02.690 --> 01:15:04.850
What I didn't have was
context and often what I do

01:15:04.850 --> 01:15:07.380
with the book is
put it into context.

01:15:07.380 --> 01:15:10.240
I'm most proud of the fact that

01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:13.470
"Rock Island Line"
comes out in chapter 13.

01:15:13.470 --> 01:15:14.770
You know, halfway
through the book.

01:15:14.770 --> 01:15:16.070
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

01:15:16.070 --> 01:15:17.390
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: It doesn't
start with Donegan, you know.

01:15:17.390 --> 01:15:20.120
Most of the, most
of the biographies

01:15:20.120 --> 01:15:23.480
of British rock stars
mentioned skiffle and the treat

01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:26.370
"Rock Island Line" as a
singularity whereas, it wasn't.

01:15:26.370 --> 01:15:29.000
It was a moment of many
forces coming together

01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:33.590
over a long period suddenly
sparking something and I tried

01:15:33.590 --> 01:15:36.550
to put skiffle in and that's
the little point of the book is

01:15:36.550 --> 01:15:39.530
to put it in its proper
context in British pop culture.

01:15:39.530 --> 01:15:40.830
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Wow.

01:15:40.830 --> 01:15:42.130
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

01:15:42.130 --> 01:15:44.540
Well, there seems to be
kind of a, a cyclical nature

01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:47.910
to your becoming an expert
on skiffle in the sense that,

01:15:47.910 --> 01:15:52.060
you know, you started out
with this interest in Simon

01:15:52.060 --> 01:15:54.220
and Garfunkel who had learned
from Martin Carthy who.

01:15:54.220 --> 01:15:55.520
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Yeah.

01:15:55.520 --> 01:15:56.820
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Was
a skiffler and something

01:15:56.820 --> 01:15:59.980
that also struck me was that,
was that one of the first hits

01:15:59.980 --> 01:16:02.250
that was made out of one
of your songs was made

01:16:02.250 --> 01:16:03.550
by Kirsty MacColl.

01:16:03.550 --> 01:16:04.850
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: That's right.

01:16:04.850 --> 01:16:06.150
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: And
her dad is in your book.

01:16:06.150 --> 01:16:07.450
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Ewan
MacColl yeah.

01:16:07.450 --> 01:16:08.750
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

01:16:08.750 --> 01:16:10.050
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Yeah.

01:16:10.050 --> 01:16:11.350
It is very strange actually
the way "what goes around,

01:16:11.350 --> 01:16:12.650
comes around" in folk music,

01:16:12.650 --> 01:16:13.950
but I mean I've always
been interested in skiffle

01:16:13.950 --> 01:16:19.090
in the sense that it always
had so many similarities to me

01:16:19.090 --> 01:16:21.290
with punk rock and I think
it really helped me to look

01:16:21.290 --> 01:16:23.300
at skiffle through that
prism when I was writing it

01:16:23.300 --> 01:16:28.610
to understand how, because of
my own experience with punk,

01:16:28.610 --> 01:16:32.420
how a musical movement
might empower someone;

01:16:32.420 --> 01:16:35.950
it might me think, you
know, I am now at the center

01:16:35.950 --> 01:16:38.730
of our culture which is
how I felt with punk,

01:16:38.730 --> 01:16:40.470
you know, had a dynamic to it.

01:16:40.470 --> 01:16:42.370
So, I think that,
that really helped.

01:16:42.370 --> 01:16:47.170
And in trying to articulate
it to a young generation

01:16:47.170 --> 01:16:50.990
and to you know Americans
and other people from abroad,

01:16:50.990 --> 01:16:53.020
I think using punk as
a point of reference

01:16:53.020 --> 01:16:56.920
at least we have something that
we, you know, a common framework

01:16:56.920 --> 01:16:58.960
in which to explain
where this is going.

01:16:58.960 --> 01:17:04.400
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: The, in the
mid50s, there were over 25,

01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:06.420
actually more than 25.

01:17:06.420 --> 01:17:07.720
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Fifty
thousand possibly,

01:17:07.720 --> 01:17:10.400
50, up to 30 to 50,000.

01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:12.310
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: So
where are they today?

01:17:12.310 --> 01:17:13.770
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Well, one
of them, one of them was

01:17:13.770 --> 01:17:16.630
on the cliff just before I came
here, an old bald guy passed me

01:17:16.630 --> 01:17:18.050
and he said "I've just
read your book sonny."

01:17:18.050 --> 01:17:19.420
And I was like, "Oh, great."

01:17:19.420 --> 01:17:20.750
And he told me about when he was

01:17:20.750 --> 01:17:23.200
in a skiffle band he
didn't [inaudible] doing it.

01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:25.870
And most of them just,
that was their moment.

01:17:25.870 --> 01:17:27.600
Their moment was, I mean,
the band on the front cover.

01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:28.960
I mean this is a stock picture.

01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:30.260
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy:
I love this picture.

01:17:30.260 --> 01:17:31.560
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Yeah.

01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:33.820
We chose this, this is a
brilliant picture of us,

01:17:33.820 --> 01:17:35.450
but part of the reason why
is because in the background,

01:17:35.450 --> 01:17:36.750
you probably can't
see it, there's lots

01:17:36.750 --> 01:17:38.050
of old people laughing.

01:17:38.050 --> 01:17:39.350
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah,
yeah [multiple speakers].

01:17:39.350 --> 01:17:40.650
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: It really
sums up the generation.

01:17:40.650 --> 01:17:43.400
Well about 2 weeks ago I got
a Tweet from the son-in-law

01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:45.310
of the bloke playing
the washboard,

01:17:45.310 --> 01:17:48.180
and last week just before I came
I had chat with him on the phone

01:17:48.180 --> 01:17:50.450
and the band are called
The Wild Five and they're

01:17:50.450 --> 01:17:54.150
from Stockport in, just
outside of Manchester.

01:17:54.150 --> 01:17:57.710
So yeah, they kind of in their,

01:17:57.710 --> 01:18:00.980
in their youth they were
touched by a fire, you know.

01:18:00.980 --> 01:18:04.490
And they didn't all
go on to play music.

01:18:04.490 --> 01:18:06.910
They, very few of them
went on to have careers,

01:18:06.910 --> 01:18:08.840
but all of them were
there in that moment

01:18:08.840 --> 01:18:10.140
and that was their moment.

01:18:10.140 --> 01:18:11.850
It was the thing
that we a part of

01:18:11.850 --> 01:18:13.150
and they have never
forgotten it.

01:18:13.150 --> 01:18:14.450
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

01:18:14.450 --> 01:18:15.750
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: And they're
still proud of it and you talk

01:18:15.750 --> 01:18:17.770
to these old guys and they,
you know, they remember

01:18:17.770 --> 01:18:19.070
as if it was yesterday.

01:18:19.070 --> 01:18:20.370
I mean, they won one
of the competitions,

01:18:20.370 --> 01:18:21.670
one of the skiffle competitions.

01:18:21.670 --> 01:18:22.970
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy:
Oh, that's right.

01:18:22.970 --> 01:18:24.270
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: That's what
this photograph celebrates.

01:18:24.270 --> 01:18:26.750
It was them coming back from
winning a competition, you know.

01:18:26.750 --> 01:18:28.850
And it really meant something
to them and in some ways it kind

01:18:28.850 --> 01:18:31.390
of defined their youth in
the way punk defines my youth

01:18:31.390 --> 01:18:33.890
and I know I bore my
family with talking

01:18:33.890 --> 01:18:35.190
about The Clash and The Jam.

01:18:35.190 --> 01:18:36.820
My son's like "Awe,
dad you know I can't.

01:18:36.820 --> 01:18:38.120
Will you stop?"

01:18:38.120 --> 01:18:41.360
He's only jealous he never saw
them, you know, it's like a lot

01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:46.470
of those things, but so you
know they most of them went

01:18:46.470 --> 01:18:48.960
on with their lives, but they
all somewhere have a picture

01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:51.310
they show their grandchildren
of the day they,

01:18:51.310 --> 01:18:52.800
they played on Six-Five Special

01:18:52.800 --> 01:18:54.100
or something like
that, you know.

01:18:54.100 --> 01:18:55.400
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: That's right.

01:18:55.400 --> 01:18:56.700
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Yeah.

01:18:56.700 --> 01:18:58.000
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Are there
any skiffle clubs still

01:18:58.000 --> 01:18:59.300
in existence?

01:18:59.300 --> 01:19:00.600
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: No not really.

01:19:00.600 --> 01:19:03.520
No. I would say that impulse
has moved on to other forms

01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:05.890
of music now, Grime would
be the nearest to skiffle

01:19:05.890 --> 01:19:10.190
in the UK [inaudible] in
its invigorating dynamic,

01:19:10.190 --> 01:19:16.650
empowerment and allows that
urban, Black urban youth

01:19:16.650 --> 01:19:20.120
to communicate with the
rest of the world in a way

01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:22.420
that the skifflers sent
out a message there.

01:19:22.420 --> 01:19:25.500
The Grime community is still
using music to do that.

01:19:25.500 --> 01:19:29.680
Most teenagers now are using
digital social media platforms,

01:19:29.680 --> 01:19:32.510
but Grime still has edge
and still has power.

01:19:32.510 --> 01:19:35.050
It was the Grime I [inaudible]
Corbyn in the election.

01:19:35.050 --> 01:19:38.330
Nobody else did a pop only
the weird folkies like me.

01:19:38.330 --> 01:19:40.550
But, yeah it was very
interesting because it seems,

01:19:40.550 --> 01:19:45.230
it says to me that they're
still, they still believe

01:19:45.230 --> 01:19:47.230
that music has something to say.

01:19:47.230 --> 01:19:48.530
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

01:19:48.530 --> 01:19:49.830
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: You know,

01:19:49.830 --> 01:19:53.020
because it's people keep asking
where's all the protest music,

01:19:53.020 --> 01:19:54.320
but they're problem is
I think they're looking

01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:55.870
for White boys with guitars.

01:19:55.870 --> 01:19:57.170
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

01:19:57.170 --> 01:19:58.470
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: The cheering
is over there with itself.

01:19:58.470 --> 01:19:59.770
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

01:19:59.770 --> 01:20:01.070
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy:
It certainly exists.

01:20:01.070 --> 01:20:02.370
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

01:20:02.370 --> 01:20:03.670
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: It does.

01:20:03.670 --> 01:20:04.970
Yeah, it is everywhere.

01:20:04.970 --> 01:20:06.270
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy:
It's everywhere, yeah.

01:20:06.270 --> 01:20:07.570
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: But it
just doesn't have the same,

01:20:07.570 --> 01:20:08.870
the same cultural force.

01:20:08.870 --> 01:20:10.170
I think, I think music
has lost its van Gogh

01:20:10.170 --> 01:20:11.470
with the new culture.

01:20:11.470 --> 01:20:12.770
It's still there and it still
has important things to say

01:20:12.770 --> 01:20:14.070
and bring people together

01:20:14.070 --> 01:20:15.370
or make them feel
they're not alone,

01:20:15.370 --> 01:20:16.670
but it's not the social medium,

01:20:16.670 --> 01:20:17.970
the single soul searching
medium was in the 20th century

01:20:17.970 --> 01:20:20.260
where they actually encapsulate
everything from skiffle

01:20:20.260 --> 01:20:23.040
to you know politics
and football

01:20:23.040 --> 01:20:24.340
and love and everything.

01:20:24.340 --> 01:20:26.280
You know, that, that
time has passed.

01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:27.580
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

01:20:27.580 --> 01:20:28.990
Well, let's talk
about a couple of sort

01:20:28.990 --> 01:20:30.330
of maybe related projects.

01:20:30.330 --> 01:20:31.630
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Sure.

01:20:31.630 --> 01:20:33.690
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: I'm
assuming that the album

01:20:33.690 --> 01:20:37.620
"Shine a Light" was, it came
out of the research textbook.

01:20:37.620 --> 01:20:38.920
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: It did, yeah.

01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:41.480
I was looking at the
repertoire of the skifflers.

01:20:41.480 --> 01:20:44.020
I became aware of
the huge number

01:20:44.020 --> 01:20:46.660
of American railroad songs that
there were and the importance

01:20:46.660 --> 01:20:48.510
of the railroad in
American culture.

01:20:48.510 --> 01:20:53.150
That kind of got me thinking
about, about making them

01:20:53.150 --> 01:20:57.650
and I was already writing
the book when I got invited

01:20:57.650 --> 01:21:03.750
to do a photo documentary to
celebrate the 90th birthday

01:21:03.750 --> 01:21:07.000
of Robert Frank, a
Swiss-American photographer.

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.590
And this magazine called
"Aperture" hooked me

01:21:09.590 --> 01:21:13.080
up with an American photographer
named Alec Soth to go

01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:15.130
on a journey and Alec wanted
to come out on the road with me

01:21:15.130 --> 01:21:17.680
and I'm like "Alec,
that is so boring mate."

01:21:17.680 --> 01:21:18.980
You know, day-after-day.

01:21:18.980 --> 01:21:22.250
He said, "Well, why don't
we go somewhere then.

01:21:22.250 --> 01:21:25.260
Where have you always wanted
to go and you've never been

01:21:25.260 --> 01:21:26.560
in the United States
of America?"

01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:28.040
I was already writing the
book them, and I said,

01:21:28.040 --> 01:21:29.340
"I tell you where I want to go."

01:21:29.340 --> 01:21:31.260
And I said, "I want
to go to Rock Island

01:21:31.260 --> 01:21:32.560
where the Rock Island
Line comes from."

01:21:32.560 --> 01:21:33.860
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

01:21:33.860 --> 01:21:35.160
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: And he
said, "Where is that in?"

01:21:35.160 --> 01:21:36.510
I said, "I don't know.

01:21:36.510 --> 01:21:37.960
Go and find out."

01:21:37.960 --> 01:21:39.620
So, it turns out
it's on the Illinois.

01:21:39.620 --> 01:21:40.920
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: That's right.

01:21:40.920 --> 01:21:42.220
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Iowa
border on the Mississippi.

01:21:42.220 --> 01:21:43.900
It's significance is that's
where the first bridge was built

01:21:43.900 --> 01:21:48.390
out of the Mississippi and
we did a drive from there

01:21:48.390 --> 01:21:51.410
to Cummins Prison Farm where
"Rock Island Line" was recorded.

01:21:51.410 --> 01:21:52.710
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Oh, wow.

01:21:52.710 --> 01:21:54.010
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: In 1935.

01:21:54.010 --> 01:21:55.690
We followed the route of the
railway, there was nobody there.

01:21:55.690 --> 01:21:59.060
And it was during that
that I came to realize

01:21:59.060 --> 01:22:02.060
that there was only one
passenger train a day

01:22:02.060 --> 01:22:05.610
in Little Rock, through Little
Rock which really blew my mind,

01:22:05.610 --> 01:22:08.980
because you know I live in a
country where I'm 140 miles

01:22:08.980 --> 01:22:10.750
from London in a rural area

01:22:10.750 --> 01:22:12.420
and there's 2 trains
every hour to London.

01:22:12.420 --> 01:22:14.700
It's just like I
couldn't believe it.

01:22:14.700 --> 01:22:17.590
And when the train came,
the train came at midnight;

01:22:17.590 --> 01:22:19.940
the train guy out of Los
Angeles, they're going

01:22:19.940 --> 01:22:21.460
to Chicago from Los Angeles.

01:22:21.460 --> 01:22:24.590
So, we went down there to play
Midnight Special while it left,

01:22:24.590 --> 01:22:26.670
you know, because we thought it
was funny and the train came in

01:22:26.670 --> 01:22:29.920
and it just sat there
for 20 minutes.

01:22:29.920 --> 01:22:32.170
People with their smokes
and freight trains went by

01:22:32.170 --> 01:22:37.790
and it transpired that
there's so few passenger trains

01:22:37.790 --> 01:22:39.880
that when they get to a railway
station there is a couple

01:22:39.880 --> 01:22:44.040
of platforms, they have a wait
time while the freight trains

01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:45.340
go by.

01:22:45.340 --> 01:22:46.690
They don't just stop and
pick-up passengers and leave.

01:22:46.690 --> 01:22:47.990
They stop and just sit there

01:22:47.990 --> 01:22:51.420
until all the freight behind
them has gone by, and then they.

01:22:51.420 --> 01:22:53.470
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: So, they go
in the hole essentially like.

01:22:53.470 --> 01:22:54.770
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Exactly.

01:22:54.770 --> 01:22:56.980
And I realized then that
we would have, you know,

01:22:56.980 --> 01:22:59.380
you would have time to
get off and find a space

01:22:59.380 --> 01:23:02.330
and record a song if
you were so inclined.

01:23:02.330 --> 01:23:05.110
So, I played with Joe Henry
to do that and that's more

01:23:05.110 --> 01:23:09.290
or less what we did from Chicago
to Los Angeles via San Antonio

01:23:09.290 --> 01:23:10.590
in March of last year.

01:23:10.590 --> 01:23:11.890
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Wow.

01:23:11.890 --> 01:23:14.060
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Thanks to
coordinating with the porters.

01:23:14.060 --> 01:23:15.590
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Well, yeah
we had to talk to the porters

01:23:15.590 --> 01:23:17.630
on the train and explain to them
we weren't actually getting off,

01:23:17.630 --> 01:23:19.520
that we were you
know making a record.

01:23:19.520 --> 01:23:20.820
Nobody seemed to mind.

01:23:20.820 --> 01:23:22.650
We didn't, we didn't get
permission from anyone.

01:23:22.650 --> 01:23:23.980
We just went and did it.

01:23:23.980 --> 01:23:26.770
But you know, 2 guys
playing acoustic guitars

01:23:26.770 --> 01:23:29.050
in a railway station is not a
big deal anyway is it really?

01:23:29.050 --> 01:23:30.350
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

01:23:30.350 --> 01:23:31.650
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Yeah,
That's kind of like.

01:23:31.650 --> 01:23:32.950
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: No.

01:23:32.950 --> 01:23:34.250
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: That
happens all the time.

01:23:34.250 --> 01:23:35.550
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Yeah, exactly.

01:23:35.550 --> 01:23:36.850
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Exactly.

01:23:36.850 --> 01:23:38.150
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: I was
surprised no one came over

01:23:38.150 --> 01:23:39.450
and gave us a couple
of quarters, yeah.

01:23:39.450 --> 01:23:40.750
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: It's the
recording equipment that's a

01:23:40.750 --> 01:23:42.050
little weird.

01:23:42.050 --> 01:23:43.350
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Well,
but that's.

01:23:43.350 --> 01:23:44.650
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: But, yeah.

01:23:44.650 --> 01:23:45.950
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: You know, but
that was just like a tree thing

01:23:45.950 --> 01:23:47.250
with a couple of mics on them.

01:23:47.250 --> 01:23:48.550
It was.

01:23:48.550 --> 01:23:49.850
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

01:23:49.850 --> 01:23:51.150
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Of
guys videoing;

01:23:51.150 --> 01:23:52.450
no one really paid us any mind.

01:23:52.450 --> 01:23:53.750
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

01:23:53.750 --> 01:23:55.050
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: There was

01:23:55.050 --> 01:23:56.350
so few people getting
on and off anyway.

01:23:56.350 --> 01:23:57.650
Yeah, some of the passengers
who were having a smoke kind

01:23:57.650 --> 01:23:58.950
of watched us, you know,
they'd follow us in

01:23:58.950 --> 01:24:00.250
and watch us doing it, but
really, no one really cared.

01:24:00.250 --> 01:24:01.550
I mean, they were all busy doing
what they were doing, you know,

01:24:01.550 --> 01:24:02.850
buying coffee and stuff like
that, get back on the train.

01:24:02.850 --> 01:24:04.150
It was a lot of fun actually.

01:24:04.150 --> 01:24:08.060
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Okay, you
know a lot of people who tour

01:24:08.060 --> 01:24:13.770
like yourself and make brand new
recordings regularly are usually

01:24:13.770 --> 01:24:17.620
not riding 400-page
historical books,

01:24:17.620 --> 01:24:18.920
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Yeah.

01:24:18.920 --> 01:24:20.220
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy:
Can you illuminate us

01:24:20.220 --> 01:24:21.520
on how this happened?

01:24:21.520 --> 01:24:23.090
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Well, I've been
doing it for a longtime now.

01:24:23.090 --> 01:24:26.250
You know, sort of 33 odd years
really since I first came

01:24:26.250 --> 01:24:28.590
to America and I was
already doing it for 5 years

01:24:28.590 --> 01:24:30.800
in a little punk
band before that,

01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:34.700
and when you've done
something like "Tooth and Nail"

01:24:34.700 --> 01:24:38.260
which is quite a big project,
you know, there's a lot of blood

01:24:38.260 --> 01:24:40.030
and silver involved in that.

01:24:40.030 --> 01:24:42.540
You need to do something to take
your mind off of it, you know,

01:24:42.540 --> 01:24:43.970
just fall into the next project.

01:24:43.970 --> 01:24:46.700
You need to sort of
clear the air a bit.

01:24:46.700 --> 01:24:53.690
So, in order to just sort
of slow things down a bit,

01:24:53.690 --> 01:24:54.990
being able to say I'm sorry

01:24:54.990 --> 01:24:58.020
but he's not available
he's writing a book,

01:24:58.020 --> 01:25:01.710
isn't actually a bad way to
putting off possibly being

01:25:01.710 --> 01:25:03.010
at one's beck and call.

01:25:03.010 --> 01:25:05.180
So, I had already
written a book before.

01:25:05.180 --> 01:25:10.510
I wrote a book called "The
Progressive Patriot" in 2006.

01:25:10.510 --> 01:25:13.120
This book actually I was a
lot more disciplined on it.

01:25:13.120 --> 01:25:15.440
I worked out how to do it
in a way that was practical

01:25:15.440 --> 01:25:19.230
to family life and
getting things done.

01:25:19.230 --> 01:25:22.690
What I basically did was I'd
go once a month to London

01:25:22.690 --> 01:25:27.240
to the British library where
they have all old music papers

01:25:27.240 --> 01:25:28.760
and jazz magazines
and stuff like that,

01:25:28.760 --> 01:25:34.630
and I would some research there
and then most days I would write

01:25:34.630 --> 01:25:40.350
from 3 until 5 and
then from 6 until 8.

01:25:40.350 --> 01:25:42.950
So, you know, I did all the sort
of day-to-day stuff before that.

01:25:42.950 --> 01:25:45.320
I didn't always, you
know, in the 3 until 5,

01:25:45.320 --> 01:25:47.820
I didn't always get my thread,
find my thread, but generally

01:25:47.820 --> 01:25:51.230
from 6 until 8 I usually got
to write you know 500 words,

01:25:51.230 --> 01:25:52.690
sometimes better than that.

01:25:52.690 --> 01:25:53.990
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Great.

01:25:53.990 --> 01:25:55.290
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: So, yeah.

01:25:55.290 --> 01:25:56.780
So, it was a you know and then
I would have a break on weekends

01:25:56.780 --> 01:26:00.490
and so I would come back to it
on Monday again all, you know.

01:26:00.490 --> 01:26:01.790
There's a lot of
reading involved.

01:26:01.790 --> 01:26:03.090
I'm kind of, that's kind

01:26:03.090 --> 01:26:04.390
of one my favorite
hobbies anyway reading,

01:26:04.390 --> 01:26:06.530
so I kind of enjoy that

01:26:06.530 --> 01:26:12.020
and because I didn't know a huge
amount about traditional jazz

01:26:12.020 --> 01:26:14.920
or jazz period, it was a lot
of discovery for me as well

01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:18.520
which was interesting, you
know, and sort of reading.

01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:22.930
A key text was Samuel Charters'
book about New Orleans A Trumpet

01:26:22.930 --> 01:26:25.270
on the Corner, "A Trumpet Around
the Corner" which just came

01:26:25.270 --> 01:26:28.420
out about 3 or 4 years ago
which is just brilliant.

01:26:28.420 --> 01:26:31.330
I was hoping to speak
to Sam because he played

01:26:31.330 --> 01:26:33.370
on that Dave Van
Ronk skiffle record,

01:26:33.370 --> 01:26:34.670
but sadly he passed away.

01:26:34.670 --> 01:26:37.640
He passed away last year I
think and he was in Sweden.

01:26:37.640 --> 01:26:40.940
I was trying to get over there
to talk to him, but yeah that's,

01:26:40.940 --> 01:26:44.410
that's really, really
a great book.

01:26:44.410 --> 01:26:47.750
And so yeah, it was,
it was very engaging.

01:26:47.750 --> 01:26:50.020
I really enjoyed it, you know.

01:26:50.020 --> 01:26:51.870
It was something that
I; I already sort

01:26:51.870 --> 01:26:53.800
of knew the Ken Colyer story.

01:26:53.800 --> 01:26:56.930
I knew, for the 50th
anniversary of the recording

01:26:56.930 --> 01:26:58.440
of "Rock Island Line" I
had written an article

01:26:58.440 --> 01:27:00.760
for the Guardian because
Lonnie Donegan had passed away

01:27:00.760 --> 01:27:05.010
and there was a big, big
gig at the Royal Albert Hall

01:27:05.010 --> 01:27:07.540
and his widow had got in touch
with me and asked me if I come

01:27:07.540 --> 01:27:10.360
and represent Woody, because
Donegan was the first person

01:27:10.360 --> 01:27:11.690
that put Woody in
the charts at home.

01:27:11.690 --> 01:27:12.990
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Yes.

01:27:12.990 --> 01:27:14.630
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: And I sang "Dead
or Alive" with his whole band,

01:27:14.630 --> 01:27:17.190
and the Guardian asked if I
would write something about,

01:27:17.190 --> 01:27:20.380
about Donegan and it was
literally was the week

01:27:20.380 --> 01:27:21.850
of the 50th anniversary.

01:27:21.850 --> 01:27:24.420
So, I went back to the
studio which is still there.

01:27:24.420 --> 01:27:28.950
It's now the English [inaudible]
Space, and I managed to get

01:27:28.950 --> 01:27:31.620
in touch with Hugh
Mendl the producer.

01:27:31.620 --> 01:27:34.780
So, I had a firsthand account
of the recording session

01:27:34.780 --> 01:27:37.690
which I think is as fair a
recount, there's a number

01:27:37.690 --> 01:27:41.160
of different recounts about
what happened, but Hugh sounds

01:27:41.160 --> 01:27:44.480
to me the most likely
turn of events.

01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:46.370
So, yeah so I had
kind of those pieces,

01:27:46.370 --> 01:27:51.020
but I wasn't really sure
how they fit together.

01:27:51.020 --> 01:27:55.000
And the story of
the first generation

01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.850
of British teenagers is kind
of out there and, you know,

01:27:57.850 --> 01:28:01.040
some of my relatives
were involved in that.

01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:05.550
My uncle Dave and my auntie
Chris when they were dating went

01:28:05.550 --> 01:28:09.230
to see the "Rock Around the
Clock" movie and were involved

01:28:09.230 --> 01:28:12.090
in turning on the hoses in the
cinema when the riot broke out.

01:28:12.090 --> 01:28:13.390
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Oh,
so they were there.

01:28:13.390 --> 01:28:14.690
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: They
were there, yeah.

01:28:14.690 --> 01:28:15.990
So.

01:28:15.990 --> 01:28:17.290
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Wow.

01:28:17.290 --> 01:28:18.590
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: So,
I got to sit down

01:28:18.590 --> 01:28:19.890
and talk to them about that.

01:28:19.890 --> 01:28:21.190
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
That's great, yeah.

01:28:21.190 --> 01:28:22.490
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: That
was really interesting.

01:28:22.490 --> 01:28:23.790
Much to my cousin's
annoyance when she found

01:28:23.790 --> 01:28:25.090
out that I had this long
chat, I said to my cousin

01:28:25.090 --> 01:28:26.390
"I've got it on the phone now.

01:28:26.390 --> 01:28:27.690
I'll mail it to you."

01:28:27.690 --> 01:28:28.990
And they never told
me about that,

01:28:28.990 --> 01:28:30.290
so I'm like okay alright I'm
going to, I'll mail it to you.

01:28:30.290 --> 01:28:32.240
So, yeah but it was
great, because they did,

01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:34.090
they had seen Buddy
Holly as well

01:28:34.090 --> 01:28:36.800
and they saw Cliff Richard you
know it was really great talking

01:28:36.800 --> 01:28:38.100
to them.

01:28:38.100 --> 01:28:40.340
So, yeah I really enjoyed it
and I met some amazing people.

01:28:40.340 --> 01:28:41.640
Hilda Simms.

01:28:41.640 --> 01:28:42.940
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

01:28:42.940 --> 01:28:45.450
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Who's was in
the City Ramblers, you know,

01:28:45.450 --> 01:28:53.130
she was sort of a, she was not
so Irish, she was a Communist

01:28:53.130 --> 01:28:55.540
and she had been to the Soviet
Union and stuff like that.

01:28:55.540 --> 01:28:59.680
And what she wanted to show
me where their original house

01:28:59.680 --> 01:29:02.110
where they lived was was
near the science museum

01:29:02.110 --> 01:29:05.240
and the science museum added an
exhibit of Russian cosmonauts

01:29:05.240 --> 01:29:07.880
from the 1960s, so I took Hilda.

01:29:07.880 --> 01:29:09.340
We went all around there.

01:29:09.340 --> 01:29:10.660
The exhibition was
just brilliant,

01:29:10.660 --> 01:29:12.340
we had such a great time and
then we did the interview

01:29:12.340 --> 01:29:14.560
in the science museum canteen.

01:29:14.560 --> 01:29:15.860
She was great.

01:29:15.860 --> 01:29:17.160
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Wow.

01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:18.460
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: And still is.

01:29:18.460 --> 01:29:19.760
She's still going gigs actually.

01:29:19.760 --> 01:29:21.060
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Did you
record those interviews or?

01:29:21.060 --> 01:29:22.360
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Yeah,
I did yeah.

01:29:22.360 --> 01:29:23.660
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Oh.

01:29:23.660 --> 01:29:24.960
So you have an archive.

01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:26.260
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: I do have
a little archive, yeah.

01:29:26.260 --> 01:29:27.560
In fact, I think my, I
might have my Van Morrison

01:29:27.560 --> 01:29:28.860
on interview still
on my phone actually.

01:29:28.860 --> 01:29:30.620
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Well you know
Todd whom you met earlier is our

01:29:30.620 --> 01:29:31.950
acquisitions coordinator.

01:29:31.950 --> 01:29:33.250
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Oh.

01:29:33.250 --> 01:29:34.550
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: So, we
might get in touch with him.

01:29:34.550 --> 01:29:35.850
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Oh, alright.

01:29:35.850 --> 01:29:37.150
Well.

01:29:37.150 --> 01:29:38.450
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: That
cat is out of the bag.

01:29:38.450 --> 01:29:39.750
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: The good
news is I still have them.

01:29:39.750 --> 01:29:41.680
The bad news is I'm a
really bad interviewer,

01:29:41.680 --> 01:29:42.980
because I talk across people.

01:29:42.980 --> 01:29:46.270
I listen back and I say,
"What are you doing?"

01:29:46.270 --> 01:29:48.750
Why do you, there's a memory
coming there and you just talk,

01:29:48.750 --> 01:29:50.540
because I'm used to
being interviewed.

01:29:50.540 --> 01:29:51.840
You can't help it.

01:29:51.840 --> 01:29:53.140
I'm like, I'll sit
back and think "Oh,

01:29:53.140 --> 01:29:54.680
why don't you just shut up?"

01:29:54.680 --> 01:29:56.100
"Shut up already."

01:29:56.100 --> 01:29:58.580
"Don't talk."

01:29:58.580 --> 01:30:01.320
But yeah, I was, it was great
having that sort of opportunity

01:30:01.320 --> 01:30:03.420
to talk one-to-one with people.

01:30:03.420 --> 01:30:05.560
It threw-up some strange things.

01:30:05.560 --> 01:30:09.380
One British rock star of
the 1960s who I had a point

01:30:09.380 --> 01:30:12.550
of reference of him in the 1960s
saying how much Lonnie Donegan

01:30:12.550 --> 01:30:14.370
was a huge influence on him.

01:30:14.370 --> 01:30:18.230
Pointblank denied he
ever even played skiffle

01:30:18.230 --> 01:30:19.580
and I had to say okay.

01:30:19.580 --> 01:30:21.560
It's not in the book, but.

01:30:21.560 --> 01:30:23.240
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: But I've got
this picture here in the book.

01:30:23.240 --> 01:30:24.990
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: I just
have to accept that.

01:30:24.990 --> 01:30:26.290
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Wow.

01:30:26.290 --> 01:30:27.590
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

01:30:27.590 --> 01:30:28.890
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: I
couldn't really.

01:30:28.890 --> 01:30:30.190
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Wow,
yeah that's interesting.

01:30:30.190 --> 01:30:31.490
Yeah.

01:30:31.490 --> 01:30:32.790
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: But I
have spoke to other people

01:30:32.790 --> 01:30:34.090
who interviewed him and said
yeah he's always winding people

01:30:34.090 --> 01:30:35.390
up, so.

01:30:35.390 --> 01:30:36.690
I was like, okay.

01:30:36.690 --> 01:30:37.990
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Wow.

01:30:37.990 --> 01:30:39.290
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: He
shall remain nameless.

01:30:39.290 --> 01:30:40.590
It's not fair on him.

01:30:40.590 --> 01:30:41.890
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

01:30:41.890 --> 01:30:43.190
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Yeah.

01:30:43.190 --> 01:30:44.490
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: But, yeah
I was like, "Come on man.

01:30:44.490 --> 01:30:45.790
Don't do this to me."

01:30:45.790 --> 01:30:47.090
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

01:30:47.090 --> 01:30:48.390
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Oh, yeah.

01:30:48.390 --> 01:30:49.690
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: So, you've
got a recent song out as well.

01:30:49.690 --> 01:30:50.990
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: I do, yeah.

01:30:50.990 --> 01:30:52.290
I just released a new
song based on the events

01:30:52.290 --> 01:30:53.590
of last year called the
"The Sleep of Reason"

01:30:53.590 --> 01:30:55.410
which is I actually
started from an etching

01:30:55.410 --> 01:31:00.690
by the Spanish artist Francisco
Goya called the "The Sleep

01:31:00.690 --> 01:31:04.150
of Reason Produces Monsters"
and it kind of resonated

01:31:04.150 --> 01:31:09.710
with the events of last year
what with Brexit and Trump's a;

01:31:09.710 --> 01:31:11.890
you know I started sort
of dropping singles now.

01:31:11.890 --> 01:31:14.840
I've got another one coming out
next month and the month after.

01:31:14.840 --> 01:31:17.580
It seems to be a practical
way of getting stuff

01:31:17.580 --> 01:31:19.690
out that has too much
[inaudible] than making records.

01:31:19.690 --> 01:31:20.990
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Right.

01:31:20.990 --> 01:31:22.290
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Just put the
songs out when they're ready.

01:31:22.290 --> 01:31:23.590
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: So, is
that what you're doing now?

01:31:23.590 --> 01:31:24.890
You're doing?

01:31:24.890 --> 01:31:26.190
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Yeah.

01:31:26.190 --> 01:31:27.490
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Song-by-song?

01:31:27.490 --> 01:31:28.790
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: One
of them will come

01:31:28.790 --> 01:31:30.090
out between now and Christmas.

01:31:30.090 --> 01:31:31.390
And we'll probably compile
them on a CD probably.

01:31:31.390 --> 01:31:32.690
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Alright.

01:31:32.690 --> 01:31:33.990
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy:
When you heard a band

01:31:33.990 --> 01:31:37.740
at the Tonder Festival
in 2008, what was going

01:31:37.740 --> 01:31:39.070
on when you heard this band?

01:31:39.070 --> 01:31:40.560
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: I was walking
around the festival having a,

01:31:40.560 --> 01:31:42.610
trying to sauce out what
the audience might be

01:31:42.610 --> 01:31:45.180
like for my performance which
I usually do when I turn

01:31:45.180 --> 01:31:48.070
up at a festival, and in the
main tent I heard this skiffle

01:31:48.070 --> 01:31:49.370
band playing.

01:31:49.370 --> 01:31:50.670
I thought, "Blimey.

01:31:50.670 --> 01:31:51.970
I didn't know they had
skiffles still in Denmark."

01:31:51.970 --> 01:31:54.030
And the main stage is
well-above, it was Carolina

01:31:54.030 --> 01:31:55.580
and the Chocolate Drops.

01:31:55.580 --> 01:31:57.760
And I finally realized
that, you know,

01:31:57.760 --> 01:31:59.570
what they were doing
is the same intention.

01:31:59.570 --> 01:32:01.050
I mean, it's not
exactly the same sound.

01:32:01.050 --> 01:32:03.130
I think they're moving
towards to sort

01:32:03.130 --> 01:32:08.420
of a classic string band sound,
but the material and the vibe

01:32:08.420 --> 01:32:12.120
and the enthusiasm, I
you know, close your eyes

01:32:12.120 --> 01:32:15.030
and you would listen to
the skifflers really.

01:32:15.030 --> 01:32:17.110
I was really surprised by it.

01:32:17.110 --> 01:32:18.410
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: And
they come straight here

01:32:18.410 --> 01:32:19.710
to do their research.

01:32:19.710 --> 01:32:21.010
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Yeah, I bet.

01:32:21.010 --> 01:32:22.310
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: They've been
in our Reading Room quite a bit.

01:32:22.310 --> 01:32:23.610
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Yeah, yeah.

01:32:23.610 --> 01:32:24.910
Yeah and I do a great
job of it yeah.

01:32:24.910 --> 01:32:26.580
I do a great job too.

01:32:26.580 --> 01:32:27.880
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
Alright, so what is next

01:32:27.880 --> 01:32:30.660
in your, in your agenda?

01:32:30.660 --> 01:32:31.960
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Well,
I'm putting these things

01:32:31.960 --> 01:32:37.680
out over the next 6 months, so
I've got the first 3 written,

01:32:37.680 --> 01:32:41.870
I've got to write the next 3.

01:32:41.870 --> 01:32:47.270
And then next year I'm sort
of looking at, you know,

01:32:47.270 --> 01:32:48.670
doing a bit of festivals
over the summer.

01:32:48.670 --> 01:32:50.380
I've got some very
interesting opportunities there

01:32:50.380 --> 01:32:52.660
and the possibility of making
a documentary about skiffle.

01:32:52.660 --> 01:32:53.960
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Ah yes.

01:32:53.960 --> 01:32:55.260
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Oh.

01:32:55.260 --> 01:32:56.560
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: We'll
see if it comes off.

01:32:56.560 --> 01:32:57.860
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick:
That would be great.

01:32:57.860 --> 01:32:59.160
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: I mean,
people talk about these things

01:32:59.160 --> 01:33:00.460
and they don't happen, but
it would be a lovely thing

01:33:00.460 --> 01:33:01.760
to do particularly now,
because a lot of the, you know,

01:33:01.760 --> 01:33:04.310
60 years ago and a lot of the
protagonists are old now those

01:33:04.310 --> 01:33:07.370
that are still with us, so it
would be great to get that done

01:33:07.370 --> 01:33:08.780
and maybe talk to
some of the, you know,

01:33:08.780 --> 01:33:10.400
people like Paul McCarthy.

01:33:10.400 --> 01:33:12.700
I did have an interview booked
with Paul, but we couldn't;

01:33:12.700 --> 01:33:14.000
the two of us couldn't
make it happen.

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:15.780
I never did get around
to talking to him,

01:33:15.780 --> 01:33:17.360
but he was willing
to talk about it

01:33:17.360 --> 01:33:19.440
so I might be able
to engage him.

01:33:19.440 --> 01:33:20.740
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Yeah.

01:33:20.740 --> 01:33:22.040
Wonderful.

01:33:22.040 --> 01:33:23.340
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Yeah.

01:33:23.340 --> 01:33:24.640
&gt;&gt; Mary Sue Twohy: Thank you.

01:33:24.640 --> 01:33:25.940
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: Alright,
well I would like to thank you

01:33:25.940 --> 01:33:27.240
for doing this interview
with us.

01:33:27.240 --> 01:33:28.540
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Yeah.

01:33:28.540 --> 01:33:29.840
&gt;&gt; Stephen Winick: And to thank
Mary Sue also for being part

01:33:29.840 --> 01:33:32.720
of it and this has
been an interview

01:33:32.720 --> 01:33:34.020
for the American
Folk Life Center

01:33:34.020 --> 01:33:35.590
at the Library of Congress.

01:33:35.590 --> 01:33:36.890
Thank you Billy Bragg.

01:33:36.890 --> 01:33:38.190
&gt;&gt; Billy Bragg: Thank you.
