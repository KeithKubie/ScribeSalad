00:00:12.803 --> 00:00:15.238
Have you every had to break
your family's rules?

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.794
Today, I'm breaking mine,

00:00:18.818 --> 00:00:22.119
around money, secrecy and shame.

00:00:23.922 --> 00:00:27.763
In 2006, on my brother Keith's
40th birthday, he called.

00:00:29.017 --> 00:00:31.572
"Tam, I'm in dire straits.

00:00:32.514 --> 00:00:35.267
I wouldn't ask unless I had to.

00:00:36.381 --> 00:00:38.823
Can I borrow 7,500 dollars?"

00:00:40.611 --> 00:00:43.365
This wasn't the first time
he needed quick cash,

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:45.714
but this time, his voice frightened me.

00:00:47.664 --> 00:00:51.727
I had never heard him
so beaten down and shameful,

00:00:54.321 --> 00:00:56.408
and it was on his 40th birthday.

00:01:01.723 --> 00:01:04.651
After a few basic questions
that we would all ask,

00:01:05.737 --> 00:01:09.230
I agreed to loan him the money,
but under one condition:

00:01:10.421 --> 00:01:12.865
that as the financial
professional in the family,

00:01:12.889 --> 00:01:14.843
I wanted to meet with him and his wife

00:01:14.867 --> 00:01:16.793
to see what was really happening.

00:01:17.983 --> 00:01:21.206
Weeks later, we met
at the local Starbucks,

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:25.427
and I started right in
with the tough-love budget conversation.

00:01:26.336 --> 00:01:30.615
"You should sell the house,
downsize to something you can afford,

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:32.605
sell the toys.

00:01:32.629 --> 00:01:34.115
And Starbucks?

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:36.139
Give up the five-dollar-a-day coffee."

00:01:37.343 --> 00:01:41.154
You know, all the trappings that we do
to keep up with the Joneses.

00:01:42.811 --> 00:01:46.050
Quickly, my brother and his wife
went into a fearsome blame game,

00:01:47.348 --> 00:01:48.637
and it got messy.

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:54.589
I vacillated between therapist
and pissed-off sister.

00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:58.092
I wanted them to be better than this.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.370
"Come on, you two. Get your shit together.

00:02:02.025 --> 00:02:03.531
You're parents.

00:02:03.555 --> 00:02:05.920
Grow up and buck up."

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.801
After we left, I called my mom,

00:02:12.484 --> 00:02:14.414
but Keith beat me to it,

00:02:14.438 --> 00:02:16.825
and he told her that I wasn't helpful.

00:02:17.955 --> 00:02:21.415
In fact, he was hurt
and felt ganged-up on.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:30.800
Of course he did. I shamed him
with my tough-love budget conversation.

00:02:33.091 --> 00:02:35.607
Two months went by when I received a call.

00:02:36.669 --> 00:02:39.250
"Tam? I have bad news.

00:02:40.646 --> 00:02:42.709
Keith committed suicide last night."

00:02:47.747 --> 00:02:51.421
Days later, at his home,
I went looking for answers,

00:02:52.626 --> 00:02:54.811
in his "office" -- the garage.

00:02:56.416 --> 00:03:00.647
There, I found a stack
of overdue credit card bills

00:03:00.671 --> 00:03:05.361
and a foreclosure notice served to him
on the day that he died.

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:29.488
My brother left behind
his beautiful 10-year-old daughter,

00:03:29.512 --> 00:03:34.853
his brilliant 18-year-old son,
weeks before his high school graduation,

00:03:34.877 --> 00:03:36.527
and his wife of 20 years.

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:39.576
How did this happen?

00:03:42.276 --> 00:03:46.856
My brother was caught
in our family's money-shame cycle,

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.974
and he was far from alone in this.

00:03:50.087 --> 00:03:55.517
Suicide rates among adults ages 40 to 64

00:03:55.541 --> 00:03:59.246
have risen nearly 40 percent since 1999.

00:04:00.141 --> 00:04:03.673
Job loss, bankruptcy and foreclosures

00:04:03.697 --> 00:04:06.910
were present in nearly
40 percent of the deaths,

00:04:06.934 --> 00:04:12.323
with white middle-aged men
accounting for seven out of 10 suicides.

00:04:13.823 --> 00:04:16.014
What I've learned

00:04:16.038 --> 00:04:22.660
is that our self-destructive
and self-defeating financial behaviors

00:04:22.684 --> 00:04:26.585
are not driven
by our rational, logical minds.

00:04:27.434 --> 00:04:33.728
Instead, they are a product
of our subconscious belief systems

00:04:33.752 --> 00:04:35.943
rooted in our childhoods

00:04:35.967 --> 00:04:38.451
and so deeply ingrained in us,

00:04:38.475 --> 00:04:43.356
they shape the way that we deal with money
our entire adult lives,

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:49.609
and so many of you are left believing
that you're lazy,

00:04:49.633 --> 00:04:53.833
crazy or stupid -- or just bad with money.

00:04:55.027 --> 00:04:57.638
This is what I call money shame.

00:04:59.216 --> 00:05:02.903
Dr. BrenÃ© Brown,
a well-known shame researcher,

00:05:02.927 --> 00:05:09.229
defines shame as "the intensely
painful feeling or experience

00:05:09.253 --> 00:05:12.578
of believing that we are flawed,

00:05:12.602 --> 00:05:16.181
and therefore unworthy
of love and belonging."

00:05:17.746 --> 00:05:22.012
Based on this definition,
here's how I'm defining money shame:

00:05:23.499 --> 00:05:26.182
"the intensely painful
feeling or experience

00:05:26.206 --> 00:05:29.002
of believing that we are flawed,

00:05:29.026 --> 00:05:32.191
and therefore unworthy
of love and belonging,

00:05:32.215 --> 00:05:34.437
based on our bank account balances,

00:05:35.546 --> 00:05:40.094
our debts, our homes, our cars

00:05:40.118 --> 00:05:41.569
and our job titles."

00:05:43.833 --> 00:05:46.421
Let me give you a couple
of examples of what I mean.

00:05:47.756 --> 00:05:50.383
I believe that we all have money shame,

00:05:50.407 --> 00:05:54.302
whether you earn
10,000 dollars a year or 10 million,

00:05:54.326 --> 00:05:57.637
and it's because we give money
all of our power.

00:05:59.737 --> 00:06:03.928
Here's what it would look like
if someone that you love, or you,

00:06:03.952 --> 00:06:06.076
might have money shame.

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:09.430
They play the big shot,
always picking up the check,

00:06:09.454 --> 00:06:12.303
financially rescuing family and friends.

00:06:12.327 --> 00:06:14.581
They are financially secure,

00:06:14.605 --> 00:06:18.279
but they live in a state
of chronic not-enoughness.

00:06:20.433 --> 00:06:26.893
They drive a Mercedes, but their budget
really only can afford a Honda.

00:06:28.234 --> 00:06:31.391
And they're looking good at every cost.

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:36.841
I know that we can break free
from the grips of money shame,

00:06:36.865 --> 00:06:38.054
because I did.

00:06:39.267 --> 00:06:42.957
Shortly after my brother's death,
the Recession hit.

00:06:43.976 --> 00:06:47.033
I lost my business and faced bankruptcy.

00:06:48.447 --> 00:06:52.208
Secretly, I was terrified.

00:06:53.409 --> 00:06:59.076
I stayed in my home for a year,
thinking I did something wrong,

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:02.607
told myself, "What did you do?
What happened?"

00:07:03.852 --> 00:07:09.137
I stayed silent, while all along,
I went outside and smiled.

00:07:09.767 --> 00:07:10.917
Nobody knew.

00:07:11.692 --> 00:07:13.013
That's money shame.

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:19.998
So what I had to do
was let go of the grip that I had

00:07:20.022 --> 00:07:22.021
on knowing all the answers.

00:07:22.045 --> 00:07:23.925
I was the know-it-all in my family,

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:30.172
and I had to give up the idea
that a new financial plan

00:07:30.196 --> 00:07:31.552
was the solution.

00:07:33.188 --> 00:07:38.459
And so just like everything
in my life, for me,

00:07:38.483 --> 00:07:41.714
I was sent a human to help,

00:07:42.896 --> 00:07:44.546
and I accepted the help,

00:07:46.038 --> 00:07:49.333
but I had to do major self-inquiry

00:07:49.357 --> 00:07:52.594
about my family's money history

00:07:52.618 --> 00:07:54.484
and my money beliefs.

00:07:56.777 --> 00:08:00.746
We have to start having this conversation.

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:03.451
Money can no longer be a taboo topic.

00:08:04.202 --> 00:08:10.306
We have to get honest with each other
that we're suffering with money issues,

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:14.758
and let's get real -- we have to stop
numbing out our pain.

00:08:16.484 --> 00:08:19.533
In order to uncover the painful parts

00:08:19.557 --> 00:08:22.298
of your money story
and your money history,

00:08:23.481 --> 00:08:24.774
you can't be numb.

00:08:25.998 --> 00:08:31.180
We have to let go of our past
in order to be free.

00:08:32.823 --> 00:08:36.514
Letting go of the past
happens through surrender,

00:08:36.538 --> 00:08:38.521
faith and forgiveness.

00:08:39.334 --> 00:08:44.183
Debt is the tangible manifestation
of not forgiving.

00:08:44.893 --> 00:08:49.100
If you have debt, you've not
completely forgiven your past,

00:08:49.124 --> 00:08:52.884
so it's our work
to forgive ourselves and others

00:08:52.908 --> 00:08:54.670
so that we can live freely.

00:08:54.694 --> 00:08:57.923
Otherwise, our history
will continue to repeat.

00:08:59.648 --> 00:09:03.712
This is not a quick fix,
and I know we all want one,

00:09:03.736 --> 00:09:05.664
but it's a slow wake-up.

00:09:05.688 --> 00:09:08.053
This is another level of work.

00:09:08.413 --> 00:09:11.704
We have to go higher to get it,

00:09:11.728 --> 00:09:12.997
to get at it.

00:09:14.014 --> 00:09:16.760
So try this: follow your dollars.

00:09:17.302 --> 00:09:20.530
Your money will show you
right away what you value.

00:09:21.491 --> 00:09:22.968
Where's it going?

00:09:22.992 --> 00:09:27.494
And then ask yourself:
Do I really value all this stuff?

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:31.409
And get curious about
what you're feeling when you're spending.

00:09:31.433 --> 00:09:33.030
Are you lonely?

00:09:33.054 --> 00:09:34.386
Are you bored?

00:09:34.868 --> 00:09:37.479
Or are you just excited?

00:09:39.424 --> 00:09:41.733
But there's deeper work
that needs to happen.

00:09:42.063 --> 00:09:44.951
How did you get all these
money beliefs to begin with?

00:09:46.623 --> 00:09:49.383
I call this your money autobiography,

00:09:49.407 --> 00:09:53.684
and as a money coach, this is
the first step I take with my clients.

00:09:54.773 --> 00:09:57.963
Think back to your earliest
childhood money memory.

00:09:58.685 --> 00:10:00.788
What did it feel like when you got money?

00:10:01.235 --> 00:10:05.038
Were you excited, proud or confused?

00:10:06.051 --> 00:10:08.148
And what did you do with the money?

00:10:08.172 --> 00:10:11.870
Did you run with the candy store,
or did you run to the bank?

00:10:12.899 --> 00:10:15.363
And what did you hear your parents say,

00:10:15.387 --> 00:10:18.466
and what did you see
your parents do with the money?

00:10:19.548 --> 00:10:21.768
My brother and I heard,

00:10:21.792 --> 00:10:23.649
"More money will make us happy."

00:10:24.506 --> 00:10:25.697
Every day.

00:10:25.721 --> 00:10:27.930
"More money will make us happy."

00:10:27.954 --> 00:10:31.381
And we internalized that
into the money belief

00:10:31.405 --> 00:10:35.193
that our self worth was equal
to our net worth

00:10:35.217 --> 00:10:40.514
as we watched our mom live in a state
of chronic not-enoughness.

00:10:41.064 --> 00:10:45.206
And she numbed the pain
with sugar and shopping.

00:10:46.441 --> 00:10:47.873
So what did we do?

00:10:48.941 --> 00:10:50.973
Keith played out my mother's life.

00:10:51.514 --> 00:10:55.505
He was an underearner,
longed to be financially rescued,

00:10:55.529 --> 00:10:57.854
and he numbed out the pain with alcohol.

00:10:59.058 --> 00:11:00.386
I did the opposite.

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:03.513
I became a high earner,

00:11:03.537 --> 00:11:06.871
rescuer,

00:11:06.895 --> 00:11:10.378
and I numbed the pain out
with self-help books.

00:11:11.699 --> 00:11:14.525
But what we had in common
was our money belief.

00:11:14.549 --> 00:11:17.166
We both believed
that our bank account balance

00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:18.881
was equal to our self worth.

00:11:20.904 --> 00:11:24.047
Looking back at the Starbucks
meeting with my brother ...

00:11:25.603 --> 00:11:28.763
he didn't need a budget and my judgment.

00:11:29.692 --> 00:11:32.788
He needed a breakthrough
from his suffering,

00:11:32.812 --> 00:11:34.818
and he needed my compassion.

00:11:36.037 --> 00:11:38.904
Keith was not able
to be the one to speak up

00:11:38.928 --> 00:11:41.418
and break our family money shame cycle,

00:11:41.442 --> 00:11:45.068
so he left me to do the work
and share his legacy.

00:11:46.759 --> 00:11:48.386
Change is difficult,

00:11:49.792 --> 00:11:53.181
but in my family, not changing is fatal.

00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:56.324
So I did the work,

00:11:56.348 --> 00:12:01.070
and I have experienced deep
and profound forgiveness,

00:12:03.096 --> 00:12:05.477
and as I stand here today,

00:12:05.501 --> 00:12:07.834
I am living on purpose,

00:12:09.473 --> 00:12:12.536
I serve, and money serves me.

00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:18.008
It only takes one person in your family

00:12:18.032 --> 00:12:20.508
to break through the money-shame cycle.

00:12:21.416 --> 00:12:23.777
I want you to be the one.

00:12:24.608 --> 00:12:25.759
Thank you.

00:12:25.783 --> 00:12:29.230
(Applause)
