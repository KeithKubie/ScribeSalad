00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.680
Hi, I'm Craig, and this is Crash Course Government
and Politics, and today I'm gonna talk about

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.730
an aspect of American elections that is probably
most familiar to you, at least if you're an

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.080
American and you sometimes watch TV, or look
at the internet, or read a newspaper, or breathe air.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.960
I'm talking about elections, which get a lot of
attention here in the US, and on Crash Course,

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.380
possibly because they present a relatively straight forward narrative, and it's easy for the media to cover.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.180
But we're not going to focus on media coverage today.
No, instead, we're going to look at why we have elections

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.540
in the first place, and the institutions and procedures that structure the way elections work in America.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.020
We might even compare them to elections in other places, but I can't make any promises.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:45.940
[Theme Music]

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.239
Before we get into the nitty-gritty of how
elections work in the U.S., it might be a

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:53.139
good time to ask a question that rarely gets asked,
"Why do we have elections in the first place?"

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.860
A simple answer is, "Complexity." America's
too big and complex to hold public referendums

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.000
on individual issues, although some states,
like California, try to do it. So, instead, we choose

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.340
representatives. In other words, we vote for people,
not policies. Elections are as good a system holding

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.420
these representatives accountable as any. Well, 
at least they're better than violence or public shaming.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.680
Political scientists and economists have a
more complicated way of describing this in

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.080
terms of "adverse selection." Because why
would we want a simple answer when we have

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.939
political scientists and economists around?
Well, they gotta do somethin'. Adverse selection

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.280
is a problem that can arise when we make a
choice but do not necessarily have all the

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.440
information we need to make that choice. Kind
of like when you buy a used car.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.180
Elections help to solve this problem because
they are ideally competitive. The competition

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.900
creates incentives for candidates to provide
information about themselves and to make most

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.460
of that information accurate since their opponent
will call them out for any statements that

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.460
are less than truthful. At least, that's what
we hope will happen.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.159
Elections also supposedly make candidates
more accountable since they provide voters

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:48.860
a chance to get rid of bad actors. Of
course, this only works when elections are

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.660
competitive, and, as we'll see in a later
episode, many elections in the U.S. really aren't.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.420
You might think that since elections are so
important to our politics that they would

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.649
be featured prominently in the Constitution,
but yeah, no. The Constitution does set up

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:03.350
a few basic guidelines that structure American
elections, but most of the important rules

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.090
that define the way elections are carried
out come out of state laws, legal decisions,

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.450
and local administrative practices. So what
does the Constitution say about elections?

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.070
Not a lot, as it turns out, except when it
comes to choosing the president.

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.080
President just gets everything...
President's so important.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.800
The Constitution does lay out the qualifications
for running for federal office--which we already

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.120
when over in our episodes on Congress and
the President -- and it describes the number

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.790
of Representatives and Senators. But mostly
the Constitution leaves elections up to the

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.420
states. Article 1, Section 4 says, "The times,
places and manner of holding elections for

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.140
Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in
each state by the legislature thereof; but the Congress

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.160
may at any time by law make or alter such regulations,
except as to the places of choosing Senators. "

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.260
And the Constitution was later changed to
allow for direct election of Senators with

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.099
the Seventeenth Amendment, so that last clause
doesn't matter so much anymore. The Constitution

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:52.319
does say more about the way the President
is chosen indirectly through the Electoral

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.840
College, but the framers messed that up so
badly that they had to amend the Constitution

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:59.689
after the election of 1800. The Twelfth Amendment,
which basically means that the President and

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:03.540
Vice-President come from the same political
party -- although it doesn't actually say that -- fixed

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.950
the electoral process. So now it's flawless.
But it's still indirect and the qualifications

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.790
for the electors who choose the president
are still left up to the states.

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.480
Some Constitutional amendments also help to
structure American elections. The Twenty-Fourth

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.060
Amendment outlawed poll taxes, which made
it easier for poor people to vote, and the

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.739
Twenty-Sixth Amendment lowered the voting
age from twenty-one to eighteen. In general,

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:25.179
when Congress addresses voting issues, it's
to try to expand the pool of voters.

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.720
Although the Constitution doesn't specify
when elections happen, it does give Congress

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.310
the power to do so, and it requires that the
day on which the electors choose the president

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.480
has to be one single day. This is in Article
Two: "The Congress may determine the time

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.180
of choosing the electors, and the day on which
they shall give their votes; which day shall

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.060
be the same throughout the United States."

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.930
Congressional laws also help structure elections
by making them more fair. The Voting Rights

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.690
Act of 1965 set up a number of systems to
increase voter participation by minority groups,

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.690
especially African Americans. And Congress
also set up the Federal Election Commission,

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:00.410
which has some say over elections. I'll tell
you who should never be allowed to vote: eagles!

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.100
You're gerrymandered out of here.

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.879
But generally, following the Constitution,
most aspects of elections are under the control

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:10.819
of the states. State laws define how candidates
are nominated and get on the ballot, and they

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:14.939
can influence the operation of political parties.
State laws also determine registration requirements

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:19.419
for voting and set up the location and hours of
polling places, which vary a lot from state to state.

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.160
Probably most important for federal elections,
state decide the boundaries of Congressional

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.900
election districts, although not the number
of representatives each state has, which is

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.220
determined by the state's population. We'll talk
more about election districts in a future episode.

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.300
That's what gerrymandering has to do with.
Remember when I gerrymandered the eagle?

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.100
Yeah, that's a preview for what's coming.

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.460
Although this is not always true in every
case, as a general rule of thumb, the federal

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.740
government is more likely to pass laws that expand
voting, and states are the government that restrict

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:48.500
voting, especially through registration requirements and
taking the vote away from people convicted of felonies.

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.800
One important aspect of American elections
that has been set up by state laws

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:56.060
is the way that winners have been decided.
We like to say that in America, majority rules.

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.389
But for the most part, this isn't really true,
at least as far as elections are concerned.

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:03.020
In most states, and in most elections, we
follow the Plurality Rule, and this has important

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.800
consequences for American politics. Let's
go the Thought Bubble.

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.380
Under the Plurality Rule, the candidate with
the most votes wins. The number does not have

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:13.860
to be a majority, and the more candidates in the
race, the less likely anyone will get the majority.

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:18.919
Suppose your election has four candidates:
A, B, C, and D. Candidate A gets 20% of the

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:24.740
vote, Candidate B gets 30%, candidate C gets
25%, and Candidate D also gets 25%. That should

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:29.260
add up to 100%. It does? Thank goodness! Okay,
so no one has a majority here, so who wins?

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.960
Candidate B, of course, because she has the
most votes, 30%. Now you'll notice something

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.430
about this election that may be a bit of a
paradox: the significant majority of voters

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:40.729
in this election, 70% in fact, have chosen
Not B. Yet, B is that one that wins. This

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:45.000
is why we need to be very careful when we say
that majority rules, because in many cases, it doesn't.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.960
But in some cases, it does. Some states do
have a majority rule in their elections. In

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:53.600
these states, if no candidate gets more than
50% plus 1 of the vote, then the top two vote-getters

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:58.100
go on to what's called a run-off election. In this
second election, you almost always get a majority.

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:02.039
In many cases, we also say that American elections
are "Winner take all." This is the case in

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:05.630
forty-eight out of fifty states when it comes
to electoral votes. What this means is that

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:09.800
the winner of the election gets 100% of the
state's electoral votes, even though it's

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:13.560
likely they wouldn't have carried 100% of
the votes. It is possible for a state to decide

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:18.080
to award its electoral delegates proportionately, based
on the percentage of votes that a candidate receives,

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:22.700
or even by electoral district, although the latter rule
causes some problems, as we'll see in another episode.

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:26.240
Thanks, Thought Bubble. So, the Plurality
Rule can result in the majority of people

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.479
being represented by someone they voted against.
This seems like a bad system, so why do we

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:34.550
have it? The main reason is efficiency. Under
plurality rule, you get a definite winner

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:38.479
that you might not have under a majority rule.
It also allows for a greater variety of candidates

00:06:38.479 --> 00:06:42.699
to win, at least potentially. And it has one
key result for America's political system:

00:06:42.699 --> 00:06:45.789
it pretty much ensures that we will only have
two viable political parties.

00:06:45.789 --> 00:06:50.720
The concept that plurality rules create two-party
systems is explained by something called Duverger's Law.

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:55.060
Here's how it works. Imagine political parties
on a continuum from extreme right to extreme left.

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:59.360
Most voters will not fall into either extreme,
so the masses of party followers will coalesce

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:03.820
around the center-right and center-left. In these
conditions, there's no incentive to form a third party

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:08.040
because it's likely to take votes away from the centrist
party, and thus throw the election to the other party.

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:11.020
Let's say that you're on the right of the
political spectrum. You like the ideas of

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:14.050
the center right party, but you think they're
a little bit weak, and you'd like to see someone

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:18.020
speak up more for your right-most ideas. You
could vote for the candidate whose ideology

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:21.639
and policies are more to your liking, but
they're not likely to win. Remember, most

00:07:21.639 --> 00:07:25.990
people prefer center-right ideas over extreme-right
ideas. That's why they're extreme. So, the

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:28.860
candidate you would most like to support isn't
going to win, but what's worse for you is

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:32.260
that by voting for them, you take away votes
from the candidate you partially agree with.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.880
Since people know that third-parties almost never
win, we're left with only two parties in the U.S.

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:39.600
Now, Duverger's Law is important for political
scientists, and it explains broadly why we

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:43.419
have two parties, but a look at American politics
in the second decade of the twentieth century

00:07:43.419 --> 00:07:47.289
suggests that parties are more extreme than
the model would lead us to believe. The polarization

00:07:47.289 --> 00:07:50.870
of parties is the subject of another episode
on the composition of parties and how they

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:54.729
reflect political ideologies. But for now,
it's still useful to understand how elections

00:07:54.729 --> 00:07:58.490
themselves work to shape the party system
we have in the U.S. This is what we sometimes

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:02.139
call a structural or institutional view of
politics, and it's the kind of thing political

00:08:02.139 --> 00:08:06.139
scientists really, really like. We'll look
closely at the actual political parties and

00:08:06.139 --> 00:08:09.660
who votes for which one in other episodes.
But I hope we've provided a little bit of

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:11.500
insight into how elections work in the U.S.

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:13.039
