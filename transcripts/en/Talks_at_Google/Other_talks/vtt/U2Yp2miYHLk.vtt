&gt;&gt;Julie: I'm Julie Westcurkin from The Author's
Team in Santa Monica. Today we are very excited

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.490
to welcome The Beer Chicks: Christina Perozzi,
and Hallie Beaune.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.009
[audience cheers and applauds]

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:22.770
They are coming to do a beer tasting for us
and to talk about their book, "The Naked Pint:

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:28.810
An Unadulterated Guide to Craft Beer". Christina
was named "Best Beer Sommelier" in Los Angeles

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.279
by Los Angeles Times Magazine in 2008.

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.190
[audience cheers and applauds]

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.410
She managed The Original Father's Office here
in Santa Monica, which I think a few of you

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:40.789
have been to.

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:41.789
[clapping]

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:45.219
Um, and she seeing the need for beer education
everywhere, she founded the popular website:

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:50.230
beerforchicks.com and started working as a
consultant, a beer educator, a writer, and

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:56.339
beer sommelier in 2006. And Hallie is also
a beer sommelier and the resident beer expert

00:00:56.339 --> 00:01:01.899
on the hit cable foodie show After Hours with
Daniel Boulud. She met Christina working at

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:06.560
Father's Office and started the popular FO
Beer School there. So, please join me in welcoming

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.420
Hallie and Christina.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:09.420
[clapping]

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.910
&gt;&gt;Christina: Thanks guys

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:12.150
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Hi

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.760
&gt;&gt;Christina: Well, the reason I quit corporate
America was because you couldn't drink beer

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.650
at work and now I see that it has changed
in a couple of years.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.370
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Thank God.

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:21.370
[laughing]

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.660
&gt;&gt;Christina: Anyway, thank you so much for
coming; and thank you so much for having us.

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:29.170
Um, when we started this beer journey, we
never ever imagined in a million years that

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:35.040
we would be standing some place like this
talking about beer, or talking about our book.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.000
But, um, we decided that the best way to talk
about our book since the book is about beer

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.480
is just to talk about beer and you can read
the book later.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:42.480
[laugh]

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:43.480
&gt;&gt;Hallie: And drink it

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.390
&gt;&gt;Christina: Yeah, and we wanted it to be
fun; we want beer, beer is supposed to be

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:53.750
fun. I mean you can evaluate it, you can appreciate
it; um, you can differentiate flavors and

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.600
tastes etc. But it shouldn't be so snooty,
it should be inclusive.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.940
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Yeah, it kind of sets itself from
the wine world in that way. There aren't as

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.670
many rules and at the end of the day it is
just supposed to be fun. So we always try

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:11.620
to drink our way through any speech, any events,
anything we are doing, lucky for all of us.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:12.620
So hahaha.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.450
&gt;&gt;Christina: Yah the reason actually why we
did this was so that we could drink and call

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.450
it work.

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:17.450
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Yeah.

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.530
&gt;&gt;Christina: So it is very important if any,
we are looking for any interns if anyone is

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.299
interested, I'm just saying. Um, let's start
with the first beer and then we can start

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:29.340
talking about what beer actually is. The first
beer we want you guys to drink is a wonderful

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.340
lager.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.239
&gt;&gt;Hallie: You may have heard of it, it's got
a red label

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.849
&gt;&gt;Christina: --It's from my home town ah,
from a little place called St. Louis, Missouri,

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:38.959
called Budweiser. If you haven't heard of
it, I don't know?

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:39.959
[giggling]

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.870
&gt;&gt;Hallie: So there's uh, little purple openers
somewhere on your table, so crack that open

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.040
&gt;&gt;Christina: And pour this much, pour about
this much you guys.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.630
&gt;&gt;Hallie: By the time you get to the end,
you will definitely feel the beer because

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.080
the alcohol percentage will rise in each beer.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.080
&gt;&gt;Christina: Yes.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.590
&gt;&gt;Hallie: So, don't feel like you're getting
cheated. We're looking out for ya.

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.450
&gt;&gt;Christina: We wanted you guys to start with
this one because we want to give you a frame

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.409
of reference. This is the beer that most people
in America are drinking. This is the style

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:11.269
of beer and it is made in a way, they call
it mass produced industrialized beer. And

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:12.739
this is about 95 --

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:13.739
[inaudible voice from the audience]

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:14.739
&gt;&gt;Christina: What?

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:15.739
&gt;&gt;Male 1: Why?

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:16.739
[laughter]

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:19.379
&gt;&gt;Christina: Why do we call it that, I don't
know -- because they made 500 billion trillion

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:25.980
barrels of it a year. Um, it does have its
purpose. It is truly consistent beer; um,

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:32.249
but it is one style of beer and this style
of beer, it makes up 95% of what we Americans

00:03:32.249 --> 00:03:33.249
drink as beer.

00:03:33.249 --> 00:03:37.020
&gt;&gt;Hallie: And, that is, that is a light lager,
so a light lager is what you are generally

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:42.560
used to. Your Coronas, your Heinekens, your
Budweisers, your Coors, this is all one style.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.790
So , you know we try to tell people, you know,
if you if you haven't gotten into craft beer,

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.739
you've probably only had one style of beer,
a lager or a light pilsner, which is which

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:56.950
is also a lager; and that would be like having
one kind of wine for the rest of your life.

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:57.950
So it's like --

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:58.950
&gt;&gt;Christina: --I'll have a white zinfandel
please.

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.109
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Yeah, and that is it. Just like
saying, l'll, I'll just have white zinfandel

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:04.720
for the rest of my life. That is it, done.
Doesn't matter what I'm eating, doesn't matter

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.099
what I'm in the mood for; so, we're, we're
trying you know to show you as we go through

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:13.549
this beer journey together. Um, we'll show
you that there is so many different flavors

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:17.980
in beer and so you can have more variety and
that's what excites us about craft beer. That's

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:22.350
why we wrote the book. That's why we got into
it. There's such a great vast variety of flavors

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:23.350
in beer.

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:27.389
&gt;&gt;Christina: You know we get all the time,
"I'm not a beer drinker....I don't drink beer.....I'm

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:30.430
not a beer drinker" and we call those people,
we say that they are in denial....

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:31.490
[audience laughter]

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.199
&gt;&gt;Christina: because there, there is a beer
out there for everyone, so maybe some people

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:41.020
just haven't found it yet. Because like Hallie
said there are 150 different styles of beer.

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.210
This beer can taste like chocolate, it can
taste like fruit, it can taste like citrus,

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:50.650
it can taste toasty, nutty, it, it runs the
gamut as far as flavor profile is concerned.

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:55.370
And, it it goes to show if, if you have tried
95% of the beers that are out there. If you've

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.470
tried Beks, you've tried Heineken, you've
tried Coors, you've tried Budweiser, not that

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.550
these are bad breweries; I am just saying
if you've tried all of those beers and you

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:07.760
don't like a pilsner style lager, you are
going to deduce that you don't like beer because

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:12.000
you've tried everything that is out there
and you don't like it. You know we get a lot

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.150
of women all the time that, I don't like beer,
I don't want to drink beer. Well it is because

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:17.150
they're --

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:18.150
[inaudible comment from the audience]

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.919
&gt;&gt;Hallie: that was a pretty mean, uh --

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:28.259
&gt;&gt;Christina: I had one person in mind; I had
one person in mind. Um, but a lot of times

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:33.259
you know women don't like hoppy, bitter beer.
Sometimes they do. I happen to and I know

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:37.300
you do too Hallie; but a lot of times women
don't like that bitter flavor in beer and

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:42.461
all the pilsners have that little bitter flavor
and so a lot of women then deduce that they

00:05:42.461 --> 00:05:43.461
don't like beer.

00:05:43.461 --> 00:05:45.690
So we are starting out with the Budweiser.

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:49.230
&gt;&gt;Hallie: So open your Budweisers. Have you
poured your two ounces you guys --

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:50.599
&gt;&gt;Christina: Have you already drank them?

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:53.610
&gt;&gt;Hallie: you're slacking, you guys are slacking
in the front there, come on pick it up, pick

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:59.330
it up. So, uh, you wanna evaluate beer just
like wine. So, uh, a lot of time we actually

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.810
use wine glasses. We don't have those today,
but we will use a glass that you would use

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:09.159
just, just for a Pinot Noir, whatever. So,
just swirl the glass, get your nose down in

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:13.409
there, like way down in there to get familiar
with your beer. See what you pick up on your

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:18.139
nose. If it is not pretty that is ok because
you know, this is a particular kind of beer;

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:23.939
so maybe you don't like what you smell. And
then take a sip and kinda let it, you know,

00:06:23.939 --> 00:06:28.479
move around in your mouth, let a little air
in just you would when you are tasting wine.

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:32.470
Get, get your initial flavors, Yeah, make
that sound, that weird sound and that weird

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:38.180
face that Christina is making right now um
and then take a second sip, see what the secondary

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:43.210
flavors are and this is how you will evaluate
the beer; so it is not about pounding beers.

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:44.210
&gt;&gt;Christina: No.

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:47.990
&gt;&gt;Haille: It is not about drinking it from
the bottom of the can like we all did. It

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:50.190
is just about drinking it or maybe that was
me...

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:51.190
[laughter]

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:53.270
&gt;&gt;Hallie: um, it is just about about high
school? Anyone? No.

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:54.270
[laughter]

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:57.210
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Um, you know just drink it just
like a wine, if you get a craft beer and it

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:01.060
comes in a nice glass, it's supposed to come
in a nice glass because you want to get all

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:04.500
the flavors, you wanna get all the aromatics
in there.

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:08.310
&gt;&gt;Christina: Um, and also you know with wine
when you're when people are evaluating wine

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:13.719
they already have, there is a certain set
of descriptors that are already defined. You

00:07:13.719 --> 00:07:19.930
know there's a wheel that tobacco and spice
and you know fruity and dark cherries; but

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:25.650
in beer there isn't that yet. It, it can be
completely subjective, if you smell band aids,

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:29.199
you smell band aids, if you smell asphalt,
you smell asphalt and I'm not necessarily

00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:34.009
saying these are bad things in beer; but have
your, make sure your mind is open to these

00:07:34.009 --> 00:07:38.530
flavors in beer. And really with beer it is
just a matter of paying attention. Because

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:42.039
people don't pay attention to beer, people
pound beer. You know we've all done a keg

00:07:42.039 --> 00:07:45.531
stand. I hope, do it once, put it on your
bucket list if you haven't --

00:07:45.531 --> 00:07:47.349
&gt;&gt;Hallie: you could, you could see what we,
we both grew up on...

00:07:47.349 --> 00:07:48.349
[laughter]

00:07:48.349 --> 00:07:50.729
&gt;&gt;Hallie: we've both mentioned, like pounding
beers and keg stands.

00:07:50.729 --> 00:07:55.900
&gt;&gt;Christina: so anyway so we're gonna go into
really quickly what the uh, ingredients of

00:07:55.900 --> 00:08:01.499
beer. Most people have no idea what beer even
is. I still don't know what Diet Coke is

00:08:01.499 --> 00:08:03.669
&gt;&gt;Haille: No one does. It's scary.

00:08:03.669 --> 00:08:04.669
[laughter]

00:08:04.669 --> 00:08:09.379
&gt;&gt;Christina: Um, but basically beer consists
of four ingredients. Obviously there is water,

00:08:09.379 --> 00:08:14.860
which makes up about 95% of beer; there is
an ingredient called malts, which are grains

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:20.960
and that is what provides the fermentable
sugars in beer. Um, there is yeast, which

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:27.249
is a single cell organism which eats the sugars
and malts and creates alcohol and CO2 and

00:08:27.249 --> 00:08:32.010
then there is hops, which provide a bitterness
and balance in beer.

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:37.340
&gt;&gt;Hallie: So the way that these work together
and make a very happy beverage is that the

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:42.409
yeast eats the malts and creates the alcohol
and CO2. So that's, the that's the science

00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:45.970
behind beer, that's what we call the birds
and the bees of beer. So, now that you know

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:50.980
those two things, the ingredients and how
beer is made, you know more than like 90%

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:55.240
of the population, which is sad. But is true,
like people if you ask someone on the street

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:57.510
"What is in beer?" They are like "I don't
know."

00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:01.290
They might say barley because you hear that
word but you know people just aren't familiar

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:02.290
with how it's made --

00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:06.560
&gt;&gt;Christina: and each one of the ingredients
parts many different permutations of flavors

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:11.620
in beer. For instance there are 100s of different
varietals of hops: there are hops that are

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:15.730
grassy; there are hops that are really bitter;
there are hops that are urbascious; there

00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:20.950
are hops that are citrusy. Um, with malts
uh, the malts are the grains, so there's rye,

00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:25.970
there's oats, there's wheat, there's rice,
um, and all of these and many other grains

00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:30.500
and all these grains can be roasted to varying
levels. They can be roasted really dark where

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:35.800
they take on chocolaty, toasty, nutty qualities
and they can be dried very quickly where they

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:41.130
are very pale and have kind of biscuity, bready
qualities. Um . . . also water plays a difference.

00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:45.630
You have very hard water with a lot of minerals
and those kinds of waters are better for stronger

00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:50.339
flavored beers, more bitter beers. You can
have very soft water like in Munich, is a

00:09:50.339 --> 00:09:54.680
good example of very soft water and beers
that come from there are very light, pilsner,

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:59.220
Czech style you know light lagers. Things
like that, and am I missing, oh and yah then

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:00.220
there is yeast.

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:01.220
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Yeast.

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:02.510
&gt;&gt;Christina: --which the next you're going
to have is going to be a good example of what

00:10:02.510 --> 00:10:05.290
yeast can do; so open the Franziskaner the
Hefeweizen.

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:12.560
&gt;&gt;Hallie: And you can dump your um, beers
in the sand castle bucket, um, you don't have

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:16.320
to finish. You, you may not like all the beers.
It's ok, you don't have to pretend like you

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.339
like them.

00:10:17.339 --> 00:10:20.900
[audience chatting going on the background]

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:25.199
&gt;&gt;Hallie: So, uh, so with those four ingredients
there's a also um obviously there are many

00:10:25.199 --> 00:10:28.600
different ways you could put these together.
So you could have you could have a yeast that

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:33.720
brings out a lot of fruit and a dark chocolaty
malt so you're having a combination of some,

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:38.510
some fruity coffee flavors or you could have
something that is a little lighter, a little

00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:43.449
biscuit; so you can see there are a plethora
of flavors in beer. You will never run out

00:10:43.449 --> 00:10:47.570
of new combinations between the hops, the
malt, and the yeast so we will never run out

00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:51.670
of, of a new variety of craft beer which is
what makes it kind of exciting.

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:55.750
So get your nose in there again, make sure
you are not just thowin' it down, thowin'

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:58.140
back. Smell it. You smell a difference?

00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:03.040
&gt;&gt;Christina: So, this is a good example of
yeast what yeast can do in beer. So, there

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:08.760
are also many hundreds of different hybrids
of yeast, some are proprietary, some people

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:13.420
have developed their own specific hybrid of
yeast that has specific flavors that they

00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:20.510
want for their beer. Uh, this is a good example
because this German beer has to uh, falls

00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:22.360
under the law called Reinheitsgebot.

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:23.820
&gt;&gt;Hallie: I'm so glad you say that because
I don't know how to say that.

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:27.910
&gt;&gt;Christina: It's a hard word, Reinheitsgebot
,which is the German purity law, which means

00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:31.870
that you can only have four ingredients in
beer; you can't add anything else other than

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:34.279
water, yeast, malt, and hops.

00:11:34.279 --> 00:11:39.120
&gt;&gt;Hallie: So, what do you guys smell? Just
yell somethin' out, no wrong answers.

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:40.120
[pause]

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:41.560
[inaudible audience comment]
&gt;&gt;Hallie: What? Citrus?

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:42.610
&gt;&gt;Christina: Who said --

00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:44.880
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Someone said banana? Yeah.

00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:45.880
&gt;&gt;Christina: Yes.

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:46.880
[inaudible audience chatter]

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:51.360
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Yes, so this is a Hefeweizen pronounced
Hefeweizen by the way. A lot of people say

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:52.360
Hefeweizer.

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:53.360
&gt;&gt;Christina: No Hefenweizen, no Hefeweizer.

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:54.360
&gt;&gt;Christina: We don't know why

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:55.360
&gt;&gt;Hallie: No Hefeweizen.

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:56.360
&gt;&gt;Christina: There is no "r" at the end.

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:57.360
[Hallie and Christina laughing]

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:58.480
&gt;&gt;Christina: Hefe, if you don't know for sure.

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:06.180
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Um, so yes banana and clove are
very traditional uh, uh tastes, flavors, aromatics

00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:10.800
of this style of Hefeweizen and definitely
a little citrus there too. Every Hefeweizen

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:15.441
is slightly different but the banana and clove
is a very traditional uh, smell that you should

00:12:15.441 --> 00:12:16.441
get and flavor --

00:12:16.441 --> 00:12:19.699
&gt;&gt;Christina: --and that is coming specifically
from the yeast flavor that they are using.

00:12:19.699 --> 00:12:23.550
There are no bananas added, there is no clove
added in the boil. It is coming from that

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:29.459
specific Hefeweizen yeast that they are using
in the beer. So a lot, go ahead --

00:12:29.459 --> 00:12:34.449
[inaudible question from the audience]

00:12:34.449 --> 00:12:37.639
&gt;&gt;Christina: it just means that Canadians
are cooler than we are.

00:12:37.639 --> 00:12:38.639
[laughing]

00:12:38.639 --> 00:12:39.639
&gt;&gt;Christina: Um --

00:12:39.639 --> 00:12:43.380
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Well there's, you know there is
not all I would say we have a lot of strong

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:49.750
beers here. Um, so that is the alcohol percentage,
A-B-V, um, and that can be connected to the

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:53.290
malt. The amount of, you know, we said that
the yeast eats the sugar, creates the alcohol

00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:54.399
and CO2 so --

00:12:54.399 --> 00:12:58.000
[inaudible question from the audience]

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.029
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Oh, ok. So, the question was, "why
is it when you go to Canada the exact same

00:13:03.029 --> 00:13:06.329
brand will be stronger in alcohol than here?"

00:13:06.329 --> 00:13:10.561
&gt;&gt;Christina: It is just honestly, it's just
laws. Um, for a long time, uh I don't know

00:13:10.561 --> 00:13:13.490
if you guys know uh, of a beer style called
malt liquor um.

00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:14.490
[laughing]

00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:16.019
&gt;&gt;Hallie: You have seen pictures --

00:13:16.019 --> 00:13:21.550
&gt;&gt;Christina: --Anyone, anyone? Um, I don't
know that beer came about because of government

00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:26.139
regulations. It was a beer that was high in
alcohol. Originally, it was a pretty decent

00:13:26.139 --> 00:13:30.310
beer that was high in alcohol because it was
too high in alcohol to be called a beer according

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:35.130
to our government standards it was called
a malt liquor. And so that is basically why

00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:39.200
it comes from the tradition of them being
able to make a higher a higher percentage

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:43.240
beer to send to Canada and now they don't
want to change it, they don't want to do the

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:47.851
New Coke thing. You know, they don't wanna,
Budweiser is not gonna change their you know

00:13:47.851 --> 00:13:53.430
recipe. They are not going to add more alcohol
and call it Budweiser and have you know 50

00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:54.430
million Americans…

00:13:54.430 --> 00:13:57.460
&gt;&gt;Hallie: It is like 3-2 beer in Utah and
I know they have that rule. There were wider

00:13:57.460 --> 00:13:59.269
spread rules, you know, a while back.

00:13:59.269 --> 00:14:02.130
[inaudible audience question]

00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:09.360
&gt;&gt;Christina: OK, so the way you get more alcohol
in beer is the malt to yeast ratio. The more

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:13.810
malt you have, the more yeast you have; the
more yeast eats the malt, and the more CO2,

00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:15.389
and the more alcohol you are going to have.

00:14:15.389 --> 00:14:18.560
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Right, so it is just adding that
into that chemical equation basically.

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:23.630
&gt;&gt;Christina: So we were talking about Hefeweizen,
we were talking about the yeast and the yeast

00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:29.730
strain. Um, there are lots of, did we talk
about how there is a yeast strain for almost

00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:34.130
every different kind of beer? There is a yeast
strain for pale ale; there is a yeast strain

00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:39.740
for I-P-A; and there is also you know people
combine all these yeasts, they combine all

00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:42.899
these different kinds of hops. They combine
all these different kinds of malts to make

00:14:42.899 --> 00:14:47.940
as Hallie said, an endless endless, I'm going
to use permutation. How many times can I use

00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:48.940
permutation? Is that --

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:49.940
&gt;&gt;Hallie: As many times as you want.

00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:50.940
&gt;&gt;Christina: I'm at Google -- I feel like
I should.

00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:53.680
&gt;&gt;Hallie: We have like five words we love
and you are going to hear them a million times

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:57.160
and one of them is tasty, one is delicious,
and we just repeat it.

00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:58.160
&gt;&gt;Christina: --Amazing.

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:00.550
&gt;&gt;Hallie: So, this is a good time also to
tell you the difference between an ale and

00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:05.149
a lager. Uh, so the first beer we had was
a lager. Have you guys heard these terms?

00:15:05.149 --> 00:15:10.140
So everyone has heard of ale and lager, but
we find that people don't necessarily know

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:14.649
what that means because they will come up
and ask us, I think I want an ale, but they,

00:15:14.649 --> 00:15:15.839
they really don't know where they are coming
from.

00:15:15.839 --> 00:15:17.090
&gt;&gt;Christina: I don't want something too aley.

00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:18.740
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Yah, we don't know what that means

00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:19.740
[laughing]

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:24.930
&gt;&gt;Hallie: And here's why, this is why, be,
so all beer can be separated into two categories:

00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:32.110
ale or lager. So, um, the reason they fall
under one or the other is the process. So,

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:38.129
there are ale yeasts and there are lager yeasts.
If a beer is a lager it uses a lager yeast,

00:15:38.129 --> 00:15:42.170
it is brewed at a lower temperature, and that
actually means that it, it is brewed at the

00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:46.459
bottom so you will see that that fermentation
happening at the bottom of the barrel or whatever

00:15:46.459 --> 00:15:47.459
you are brewing it in.

00:15:47.459 --> 00:15:48.570
&gt;&gt;Christina: It is a bottom fermenting yeast.

00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:52.940
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Bottom fermenting, um, at a lower
temperature for a longer amount of time. That

00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:58.440
is kind of how I remember lager, lower temperature,
longer, lager. Um, an ale yeast will brew

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:03.920
at a higher temperature at the top, for a
shorter amount of time. So, it is a process.

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:08.170
And then underneath ale and lager are all
the styles you have heard of. So, pilsner

00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:14.829
is a lager; um, a porter is an ale; uh, you
know, so that's, those are like the two big

00:16:14.829 --> 00:16:19.170
categories and underneath are all the small
ones. So, you don't really want to ask for

00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:22.600
beer, you know just "I'll have an ale" or
"I'll have a lager." You wanna get a little

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:26.399
more specific. It is kinda like saying "I'll
have a red wine" or "I'll have a white wine".

00:16:26.399 --> 00:16:30.120
You know, it doesn't really tell you what
the beer is going to taste like.

00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:35.210
&gt;&gt;Christina: So, one of the misconceptions
that people have about uh, beer, number one

00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:40.850
misconception is that a beer that is dark
in color is bitter and heavy. Uh, the only

00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:45.040
thing that the color of a beer tells you is
to what degree the malt has been roasted that

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:49.269
was used in the making of the beer. You can
have very dark beer that is light in body

00:16:49.269 --> 00:16:53.220
and light in alcohol content. Hops are the
only thing that provides the bitterness in

00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:59.240
beer and they are completely invisible in
beer. So, you know, a color of beer tells

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:02.780
you nothing about how bitter it is, it tells
you nothing about how much alcohol content

00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:09.491
it is cuz that has to do with the amount of
malt versus yeast. So, that is uh, misconception

00:17:09.491 --> 00:17:10.491
number one.

00:17:10.491 --> 00:17:11.491
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Very important.

00:17:11.491 --> 00:17:15.449
&gt;&gt;Christina: Very important...the second misconception
is that a Hefeweizen is lemony and you should

00:17:15.449 --> 00:17:22.289
have a piece of citrus in it. We have a little
saying that is called N-F-L...can we swear?

00:17:22.289 --> 00:17:23.289
&gt;&gt;Hallie: No

00:17:23.289 --> 00:17:24.289
&gt;&gt;Christina: Can we swear?

00:17:24.289 --> 00:17:25.289
&gt;&gt;Hallie: No, we won't.

00:17:25.289 --> 00:17:26.289
[Christina laughing]

00:17:26.289 --> 00:17:27.289
&gt;&gt;Hallie: You can u . . use the "f" the "f-ing"
lemon

00:17:27.289 --> 00:17:30.340
&gt;&gt;Christina: No - don't put it in the beer.
You can apply that to lime --

00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:31.740
[laughing]

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:35.730
&gt;&gt;Christina: And the reason we do that is
because smell this beer - right? You have

00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:39.840
the banana; you have the clove; there is a
little bit of citrus sour in it but not enough

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:46.409
to put a lemon in it. It would ruin the balance
of a very finely made beer and these brewers

00:17:46.409 --> 00:17:50.890
that are brewing a craft beer and, and are
and are artists. They are craftsman and they

00:17:50.890 --> 00:17:54.500
take their work very seriously. And sometimes
there are traditions that have gone on for

00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:59.780
hundreds of years and a yeast they've propagated
for hundreds of years. So, when you squeeze

00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:04.330
a lemon into it not only are you ruining the
balance of the beer but you are also destroying

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:08.360
the head of the beer. The citric acid destroys
the head of the beer and that is where you

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:12.309
get all of the aromatics. Um . . . if you
don't get aromatics you are not going to taste

00:18:12.309 --> 00:18:17.210
the beer. Aromatics are 80% of what we perceive
as flavor, and so -

00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:21.460
&gt;&gt;Hallie: --So, you know if a German comes
up to us and says they want a Hefeweizen and

00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:24.130
we put a lemon in it, they might have a heart
attack.

00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:25.130
[laughing]

00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:28.370
&gt;&gt;Hallie: And pretty much anyone from Europe
if they ask us for a Hefeweizen, we put a

00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:30.280
lemon they are like "what are you doing?"

00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:31.280
[laughing]

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:35.750
&gt;&gt;Hallie: So you know those that has really
become popular for the more mass produced

00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:41.210
wheat beers in America. And those beers are
a different style basically and they often

00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:45.250
don't have the esters, which is the smell
from the yeast where you are getting the banana

00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:49.100
and clove. They don't have that. So, they
are saying you know, it is really more of

00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:54.559
a, a body that they have that the wheat comes
through because these are wheat beers so then

00:18:54.559 --> 00:18:57.650
you know then you are throwing a lemon in
there because you don't have a lot of other

00:18:57.650 --> 00:19:00.910
flavors that you are going to destroy. So,
that is how that became popular.

00:19:00.910 --> 00:19:09.630
[inaudible question from the audience]

00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:10.630
&gt;&gt;Christina: Yeah.

00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:11.630
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Uh ha - uh ha, good question.

00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:12.630
&gt;&gt;Christina: Hefeweisen --

00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:15.250
&gt;&gt;Hallie: So the question is uh, with the
esters from the Hefeweizen the banana and

00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:17.340
clove, what would we eat with a Hefeweizen?

00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:18.881
&gt;&gt;Christina: A banana

00:19:18.881 --> 00:19:19.881
[laughing]

00:19:19.881 --> 00:19:20.881
&gt;&gt;Hallie: A banana and a clove --

00:19:20.881 --> 00:19:21.881
[laughing]

00:19:21.881 --> 00:19:22.881
&gt;&gt;Hallie: OK, scene.

00:19:22.881 --> 00:19:23.881
&gt;&gt;Christina: Scene.

00:19:23.881 --> 00:19:28.929
&gt;&gt;Christina: No, you know I would do something
you know you could do something like a tropical

00:19:28.929 --> 00:19:33.350
dish like a seafood with some papayas or a
chutney or something like that. Uh, there

00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:38.130
are a couple of ways that we pair food with
beer and one is to kind of think of the beer

00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:44.500
as the sauce in a way and to incorporate the
beer into the food so that the beer enhances

00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:48.460
the food and the food enhances the beer. So,
it is just a matter of thinking about the

00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:50.380
spices that are in it. You can even have this
with dessert.

00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:51.380
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Oh yeah.

00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:55.460
&gt;&gt;Christina: I mean you could have this with
banana cake even. We've tried that it was

00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:56.460
pretty good.

00:19:56.460 --> 00:20:01.080
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Yeah, we've tried beer with everything
we eat so um but you can also use beer as

00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:04.130
an ingredient so another way you could use
this is would be like in a vinaigrette. Sometimes

00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:08.260
people use a Hefeweizen in vinaigrette and
you can tell how that would work really well.

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:12.340
So, just think about you know, just break
down what your smelling and what you are tasting

00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:16.760
and associate it with food the way you would
you know a spice rack or any ingredient. And

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:20.840
it is kind of fun. I mean that is the crazy
thing about what we love about beer is you

00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:23.900
can you can use it with food and such and
you know such interesting ways.

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:26.501
&gt;&gt;Christina: The other thing we love about
beer is drinking it.

00:20:26.501 --> 00:20:27.851
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Oh yeah. Let's open the next one
 --

00:20:27.851 --> 00:20:28.851
&gt;&gt;Christina: Open the next one and move quickly.

00:20:28.851 --> 00:20:29.851
&gt;&gt;Hallie:-- Open to the next one.

00:20:29.851 --> 00:20:33.840
&gt;&gt;Christina: So the next one is a Hitachino
White. It is another German beer. But this

00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:38.020
time we are going to Belgium for German, for
German, this time we are going to Belgium

00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:44.980
for the wheat beer. Um, so they said before
German, in Germany there is a rule where you

00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:48.820
can only have four ingredients and in Belgium,
there is no such rule so you can add anything

00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:49.820
you want to, to the beer.

00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:50.820
[inaudible audience question]

00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:54.650
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Yes, and there is a little owl on
the front? Little bottle? Cutest bottle ever,

00:20:54.650 --> 00:21:01.020
it is from Japan. It is from Japan. Yes ,it
is a Belgian, Wit Bier from Japan, so whoa.

00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:07.049
This is the other awesome thing about beer,
you can have a very um, tasty traditional

00:21:07.049 --> 00:21:14.360
Hefeweizen or porter or, you know, Wit Bier
or whatever made in a variety of countries,

00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:19.890
a variety of places because you can have all
the ingredients brought to you basically.

00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:23.900
You know, you can make a really authentic
Saison, which we are going to taste later.

00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:29.320
Here in the states it doesn't have to be in
uh, Belgium, so this made in Japan --

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:30.659
&gt;&gt;Hallie: In a saki brewery --

00:21:30.659 --> 00:21:32.409
&gt;&gt;Christina: and uh, in a place that was a
saki brewery--

00:21:32.409 --> 00:21:36.730
&gt;&gt;Hallie: throw it in there, saki brewery--

00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:40.840
&gt;&gt;Christina: Yeah, so really smell it, I see
some of you throwing it back, smell it first.

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:43.090
&gt;&gt;Audience 2: Get the primary --

00:21:43.090 --> 00:21:47.850
&gt;&gt;Christina: Get the primary aromatics, take
a moment, get the secondary aromatics--

00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:53.480
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Different than the last one? Yes?
Get anything you want to yell out?

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:54.870
&gt;&gt;Audience 3: Sour--

00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:55.870
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Sour, mmhmm.

00:21:55.870 --> 00:21:56.870
&gt;&gt;Christina: Sour.

00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:57.870
&gt;&gt;Audience 4: Orange

00:21:57.870 --> 00:21:58.870
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Orange

00:21:58.870 --> 00:22:03.169
&gt;&gt;Christina: So this is a Wit Bier or a while
ale. This beer is traditionally brewed with

00:22:03.169 --> 00:22:09.820
coriander and with bitter orange peel. Um,
it should be more citrus. It is called a white

00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:13.159
ale because it is unfiltered, it is a little
bit lighter in color, it uses pale malts.

00:22:13.159 --> 00:22:18.860
Um, when people think of wheat beer you know
traditionally they think of very citrusy because

00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:23.960
they are thinking of that lemon. This style
is a little bit closer to that citrus kind

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:29.381
of flavor that a lot of people are looking
for in wheat beers. Hallie had mentioned that

00:22:29.381 --> 00:22:32.679
there are American styles of wheat beer too
that have a more citrus quality like Pyramid

00:22:32.679 --> 00:22:38.480
and uh, Widmer and uh, those uh, we call those
America style wheat beers and this is a Belgian

00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:39.480
style wheat beer.

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:45.490
&gt;&gt;Hallie: So uh we uh, should we tell them
the secret?

00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:50.220
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Yeah, ok I guess we have to now
I said that in microphone so um, this, this

00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:55.380
beer actually is not, not, not usually this
sour. So, sometimes um, this is the other

00:22:55.380 --> 00:23:00.870
interesting thing about craft beer is it's
a it's a living thing a lot of times, craft

00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:04.600
beer, the smaller produced beer with the true
ingredients. We are not talking about the

00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:09.919
big pasteurized beers. So you know each batch
can be slightly different. So, this beer traditionally

00:23:09.919 --> 00:23:15.429
for us has a lot of pear to it and some nice
spice. This is a little more sour than usual,

00:23:15.429 --> 00:23:18.730
so it is this batch, so when we tasted it,
we were like oh, this is different --

00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:23.309
&gt;&gt;Christina: very, it is a lot more lemony
than it usually is.

00:23:23.309 --> 00:23:30.490
[audience comment/question inaudible]

00:23:30.490 --> 00:23:37.470
&gt;&gt;Christina: I'll pour it in, it is total
personal preference. Like for instance you'll

00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:41.220
see this beer it is unfiltered. It means the
yeast is still in the beer and there is still

00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:43.770
some proteins in the beer, which is fine.
It won't hurt you.

00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:45.140
&gt;&gt;Hallie: It won't kill you.

00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:48.580
&gt;&gt;Christina: It won't kill you. There is nothing
dangerous about it. Really, it is just a personal

00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:53.309
preference in flavor. I tend to like a courser
mouth feel and I like the taste of these so

00:23:53.309 --> 00:23:57.470
I'll pour it and then I'll swirl it and I'll
pour the rest of it in. Some people, Mark

00:23:57.470 --> 00:24:01.179
from Craftsman, the owner of Craftsman Brewing
Company says not to do that. He doesn't do

00:24:01.179 --> 00:24:02.720
it. We've had arguments about it.

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:07.309
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Sometimes, sometimes it can add
a touch of funky earthy sour to it, so if

00:24:07.309 --> 00:24:12.169
you like that which we both do actually we
kind of like earthy flavors, so we, we kind

00:24:12.169 --> 00:24:15.820
of swirl it up and pour it in; but you will
you will definitely see that sediment, sometimes

00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:18.840
you will see it in the, the bottle cap, you
might see it in the cap actually if you look

00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:22.649
at the cap of this one. You might see some
goopy stuff and that is the yeast and it is

00:24:22.649 --> 00:24:23.649
ok.

00:24:23.649 --> 00:24:24.649
&gt;&gt;Christina: It is fine.

00:24:24.649 --> 00:24:25.649
&gt;&gt;Hallie: There is nothing wrong there.

00:24:25.649 --> 00:24:26.649
[Christina and Hallie giggle]

00:24:26.649 --> 00:24:29.809
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Ok, so you can move on to your next
beer, your fol, it's in the, by the way your

00:24:29.809 --> 00:24:30.809
list is right there.

00:24:30.809 --> 00:24:32.179
&gt;&gt;Christina: Yeah, the list, the order that
we are.

00:24:32.179 --> 00:24:33.179
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Yeah.

00:24:33.179 --> 00:24:34.179
&gt;&gt;Christina: Going in is here if you guys
want to.

00:24:34.179 --> 00:24:35.179
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Yeah.

00:24:35.179 --> 00:24:36.179
&gt;&gt;Christina: Make notes on them.

00:24:36.179 --> 00:24:37.179
&gt;&gt;Hallie: It's the Saison, right?

00:24:37.179 --> 00:24:38.179
&gt;&gt;Christina: Yes, the next beer is the Saison
Dupont...

00:24:38.179 --> 00:24:39.179
&gt;&gt;Hallie: mmmmmmmm

00:24:39.179 --> 00:24:42.580
&gt;&gt;Christina: which is another Belgian. This
isn't a true Belgian. You can have, if a beer

00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:45.941
is a Belgian in style but not from Belgium,
you have to call it a Belgian style.

00:24:45.941 --> 00:24:46.941
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Yeah.

00:24:46.941 --> 00:24:47.941
[inaudible audience response]

00:24:47.941 --> 00:24:48.941
&gt;&gt;Christina: Please do not aim....it at your
eye.

00:24:48.941 --> 00:24:53.940
&gt;&gt;Christina: Don't open it at, Yeah, be careful
but it's got a lovely sound. Yes, hear that

00:24:53.940 --> 00:24:54.940
pop.

00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:59.760
[popping sound from opening a bottle]

00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:00.890
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Yeah, Whew!

00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:01.890
&gt;&gt;Christina: Yeah.

00:25:01.890 --> 00:25:02.890
[Christina laughing]

00:25:02.890 --> 00:25:03.960
&gt;&gt;Christina: Best sound in the world.

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:04.960
[another bottle popping sound]

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:05.960
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Yeah.

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:06.960
&gt;&gt;Christina: So, Saison is another style of
beer. It is a style of ale and once again

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:11.220
it is a little bit lighter in color. It's
unfiltered. it does have some wheat in the

00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:16.779
beer. A lot of people assume that wheat beers
are made with 100% wheat malt and they can

00:25:16.779 --> 00:25:21.350
be made with any percentage of wheat malt
from 30 to 70% it just really depends on the

00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:27.270
style and depends on the brewer. This is made
with a little less wheat than a Wit Beir or

00:25:27.270 --> 00:25:28.270
a Hefeweizen.

00:25:28.270 --> 00:25:31.679
&gt;&gt;Hallie: So the, I won't tell you the notes,
I was going to tell you the notes of Saison

00:25:31.679 --> 00:25:35.140
but do you guys get a really different smell
here? From the last one?

00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:36.140
[audience chatter]

00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:37.140
&gt;&gt;Hallie: What did you get? Leather?

00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:38.140
&gt;&gt;Christina: That is good because she says
leather, that is really good because --

00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:39.140
&gt;&gt;Hallie: There is no wrong answers.

00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:41.830
&gt;&gt;Christina: That is a very earth...this is
a very earthy beer.

00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:43.710
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Yeah, so that is true --

00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:45.760
&gt;&gt;Christina: Unless you are also smelling
your shoe at the same time.

00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:46.760
[laughing]

00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:51.520
&gt;&gt;Hallie: So, that is true. So, this, I mean,
for us you know we taste a lot more of that

00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:55.460
earthiness, which is kind of where you are
getting that leather from than the last one,

00:25:55.460 --> 00:26:00.720
not as bright and fruity, more earthy. They
call this often a ,a farmhouse ale and it

00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:04.640
kind of recalls those flavors of like hay
and dirt and....

00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:05.640
&gt;&gt;Christina: --horses

00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:07.899
&gt;&gt;Hallie: --barnyard, flannel --

00:26:07.899 --> 00:26:11.890
&gt;&gt;Christina: --horses, I don't know, I never
lived on a farm. And this often has a citrus

00:26:11.890 --> 00:26:13.340
element to it...a little pepper.

00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:18.669
&gt;&gt;Hallie: We love this beer with food. This
is great with food. You can only imagine with

00:26:18.669 --> 00:26:23.680
some seafood and it is nice and dry on the
end, a little earthy, and that dryness again

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:29.409
comes from the hops. So, when you are getting
that, that hops actually have tannin in them,

00:26:29.409 --> 00:26:34.760
just like grape skins in wine. So, hops are
sometimes used to balance the sweetness of

00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:40.029
a beer and all beer has hops, pretty much,
and if it didn't it would be really sweet.

00:26:40.029 --> 00:26:46.340
It would be like a syrupy, sweet beer so sometimes
it is used to balance the sweetness and sometimes

00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:51.850
they put it in there to make a really bitter,
slap you in the face, beer and we will get

00:26:51.850 --> 00:26:52.850
to that later.

00:26:52.850 --> 00:26:53.850
[laughing]

00:26:53.850 --> 00:26:56.080
&gt;&gt;Hallie: We are going to slap you in the
face later.

00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:57.080
[laughing]

00:26:57.080 --> 00:27:01.860
[Inaudible question from the audience]

00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:04.750
&gt;&gt;Christina: Yes, yes

00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:10.510
&gt;&gt;Christina: It can be a lot. He was saying
that um, Belgian beers have a very distinct

00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:15.299
flavor and he is trying to figure out what
it is, is it in the hops or the yeast. Yep,

00:27:15.299 --> 00:27:19.220
in the doubles and the triples which are bigger
beers, so we are going to be trying later,

00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:26.169
those are Belgian styles, they typically use
a Belgian candy sugar in addition to the malts

00:27:26.169 --> 00:27:32.169
to pump up that malt level to get a higher
alcohol content. And so you are also going

00:27:32.169 --> 00:27:36.940
to get what's call residual sugar in the beer.
So that sweetness, kinda like a port quality,

00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:41.850
almost like a brandyish kind of quality, you
get some heat in the exhaust. Most of the

00:27:41.850 --> 00:27:46.289
time it comes from either that, or it comes
from the yeast, the specific yeast strain

00:27:46.289 --> 00:27:47.669
that they are using, the esters.

00:27:47.669 --> 00:27:53.440
&gt;&gt;Hallie: And also we find that the hops that
a lot of people use in American styles, the

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:57.850
bigger sort of west coast pale ales, are,
are a different kind of hops and so they can

00:27:57.850 --> 00:28:01.220
give you some of that piney citrus that we
are going to taste later. And sometimes the

00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:06.130
Belgians, they are using hops more too to
try to dry out the end and it can be a funkier

00:28:06.130 --> 00:28:11.809
kind of dry hop. So, it is going to give it
a really different balance, a different um,

00:28:11.809 --> 00:28:15.480
profile, flavor profile than the American
styles. That might be what you are tasting

00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:19.260
as well. They are kind of going for different
things in the same way that you know a true

00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:24.919
burgundy is going for something different
than a Pinot Noir in California. So, you know,

00:28:24.919 --> 00:28:28.260
they have a different idea of how to use all
of the ingredients so that, that's part of

00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:30.200
it. Ok, so moving on.

00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:32.799
&gt;&gt;Christina: Let's move on, let's get hoppy.

00:28:32.799 --> 00:28:36.911
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Terrible, I can't believe you just
said that.

00:28:36.911 --> 00:28:38.409
&gt;&gt;Christina: I know, that's bad, I apologize
for that that. I should have apologized in

00:28:38.409 --> 00:28:39.409
advance.

00:28:39.409 --> 00:28:41.650
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Although our our title for this
chapter was "A Hoppy Ending", --

00:28:41.650 --> 00:28:42.650
&gt;&gt;Christina: Hoppy ending.

00:28:42.650 --> 00:28:45.440
&gt;&gt;Hallie: So really, you could see what level
we are working at.

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:46.440
[laughing]

00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:49.190
&gt;&gt;Hallie: You could see at the bottom there
we gave you a reference for the book if you

00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:50.190
want to follow along.

00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:53.200
&gt;&gt;Christina: Yeah, each one of these styles
we put a page for the book or Hallie did actually.

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:57.919
Put a page for the book with each one. But
we are going to deal with the Racer 5 I-P-A,

00:28:57.919 --> 00:28:59.701
which stands for India Pale Ale.

00:28:59.701 --> 00:29:02.030
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Anybody have this? Nice!

00:29:02.030 --> 00:29:03.030
&gt;&gt;Christina: Yeah.

00:29:03.030 --> 00:29:06.700
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Very California beer here. This
is our favorite I-P-A. I'm just speaking for

00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:07.700
both of us.

00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:08.740
&gt;&gt;Christina: Let's have some, so --

00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:10.120
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Yeah, speaking of that --

00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:11.490
&gt;&gt;Christina: Can I have some?

00:29:11.490 --> 00:29:16.210
&gt;&gt;Hallie: We love Stone actually too, but
this, I just love this beer.

00:29:16.210 --> 00:29:19.630
&gt;&gt;Christina: This is from Healdsburg, California,
very public. Oh, nice.

00:29:19.630 --> 00:29:20.630
[laughing]

00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:25.909
&gt;&gt;Hallie: That's why we picked you to pour
it.

00:29:25.909 --> 00:29:31.230
&gt;&gt;Christina: Um, so a lot of people at India
Pale Ale obviously, this style of ale.

00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:36.019
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Yeah, you tell them, I'll tell the
Russian -

00:29:36.019 --> 00:29:41.100
&gt;&gt;Christina: So, India Pale Ale is a style
of beer and it is a very interesting style

00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:49.769
of beer. It was invented in the early 1800s
when uh, the English were colonizing India.

00:29:49.769 --> 00:29:55.710
And these are the days before the Suez Canal,
these were the days before refrigeration,

00:29:55.710 --> 00:30:01.299
these were the days before stainless steel.
And in order to get beer to their colonist

00:30:01.299 --> 00:30:08.210
and to their soldiers, they put beer in wooden
barrels and put them on ships. And sailed

00:30:08.210 --> 00:30:14.309
them down around the horn of Africa past the
equator and back up past the equator. And

00:30:14.309 --> 00:30:21.710
by the time the beer was getting to uh, India
it was going bad. And so, what they discovered

00:30:21.710 --> 00:30:27.190
in England, was that they already knew actually
that alcohol had a preservative quality and

00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:31.470
they discovered that hops, which put the bitterness
in beer and dryness in beer, have a preservative

00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:36.669
quality as well and so they added more hops
and added more malt which gave more alcohol

00:30:36.669 --> 00:30:41.100
and the beer ended up making the journey.
So, the India became a very popular style

00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:44.190
and then the Brits really fell in love with
this style as well.

00:30:44.190 --> 00:30:49.750
We should tell you that the British I-P-A
version is a lot less hoppy and a lot less

00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:53.549
dry and a lot less alcoholic than the American
versions because we Americans do things bigger

00:30:53.549 --> 00:30:54.549
and better ?

00:30:54.549 --> 00:30:55.549
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Louder

00:30:55.549 --> 00:30:57.350
&gt;&gt;Christina: Than anyone could possibly imagine.

00:30:57.350 --> 00:31:02.850
&gt;&gt;Hallie: We call American I-P-A is like the
hair band of I-P-A. It is like turn it up,

00:31:02.850 --> 00:31:07.740
slam down your uh, guitar, get some reverb.
I don't know, I don't play guitar, but you

00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:12.600
know something like that. You know the drum
solo? That is what you think of when you think

00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:17.340
of hoppy American. It is very....so if a British
person asks us for an I-P-A, we don't even

00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:21.941
go this hoppy because we know that in their
country it's just gonna hit them in the face.

00:31:21.941 --> 00:31:22.941
This is a slap --

00:31:22.941 --> 00:31:23.941
&gt;&gt;Christina: We are gonna slap you in the
face.

00:31:23.941 --> 00:31:24.941
&gt;&gt;Hallie: You feel slapped a little bit?

00:31:24.941 --> 00:31:25.941
Christina&gt;&gt;Just a little bit--

00:31:25.941 --> 00:31:26.941
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Taste it, smell it

00:31:26.941 --> 00:31:30.429
&gt;&gt;Christina: So, smell it make sure you get,
so, to finish up an I-P-A will always have

00:31:30.429 --> 00:31:34.120
more alcohol content and will always be hoppier
or more bitter and dry than a pale ale. So,

00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:37.610
that's when people are asking what is the
difference between a pale ale and an I-P-A

00:31:37.610 --> 00:31:38.610
that is what it is.

00:31:38.610 --> 00:31:44.240
&gt;&gt;Hallie: And a lot of the names for the styles
come from these you know these stories from

00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:47.970
history and just the way it came about. So
it is kinda another cool thing about beer

00:31:47.970 --> 00:31:53.130
is it, it, you know, you go back to these
old stories and over time these names just

00:31:53.130 --> 00:31:59.019
stick. But a lot of people that we find they
say I-P-A but they don't know why is it India

00:31:59.019 --> 00:32:00.019
and so it is kind of a cool -

00:32:00.019 --> 00:32:04.390
[audience inaudible question or comment]

00:32:04.390 --> 00:32:07.159
&gt;&gt;Christina: I think they then eventually
did

00:32:07.159 --> 00:32:08.179
[Christina laughs]

00:32:08.179 --> 00:32:13.081
They figured it out, but over land was a longer
journey than sailing at the time.

00:32:13.081 --> 00:32:15.320
[audience inaudible question or comment]

00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:17.549
&gt;&gt;Christina: Yeah, yeah, no refrigeration.

00:32:17.549 --> 00:32:21.110
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Well, also, what are they going
to drink on the ship if they don't?

00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:22.110
[laughing]

00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:26.221
&gt;&gt;Hallie: I mean long journey I'm just saying;
but you know back in those days a lot of beer

00:32:26.221 --> 00:32:31.340
did go bad, it did go sour and obviously you
probably know that beer needs to be kept at

00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:35.200
a pretty good temperature. It should be in
a dark glass, if you see a beer and it has

00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:36.200
a clear bottle--

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:37.650
&gt;&gt;Christina: Dark glass bottle--

00:32:37.650 --> 00:32:41.460
Yeah, dark glass bottle, sorry, than you know
that is not good for beer. It is just like

00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:45.470
wine so it, it should be kept at a constant
temperature, not a lot of heat and then a

00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:49.600
lot of freezing. You don't wanna, that's gonna,
you know, get in the way of the flavors and

00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:51.010
could make the beer go bad.

00:32:51.010 --> 00:32:54.971
&gt;&gt;Christina: But you also notice that we are
not serving these beers ice cold. You know

00:32:54.971 --> 00:33:00.269
you hear all those commercials "Ice Cold!"
and the label turns a color when it's cold

00:33:00.269 --> 00:33:04.330
you know like that's not necessarily good
for beer. That is good for bad beer because--

00:33:04.330 --> 00:33:05.330
[laughing]

00:33:05.330 --> 00:33:11.340
&gt;&gt;Christina: Well, it is because cold inhibits
flavor. If you have something really cold

00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:17.010
you are not going to taste a lot of it. Also
if you can't smell the flavor once again,

00:33:17.010 --> 00:33:20.179
you are not going to taste very much of it,
which is why some of these mass produce companies

00:33:20.179 --> 00:33:25.150
say, "drink this beer ice cold out of the
bottle." You can't smell it, you can't taste

00:33:25.150 --> 00:33:27.590
it....isn't that great! It quenches your thirst...it's
awesome.

00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:31.659
But we are not you know we're about actually
being able to evaluate and being able to taste

00:33:31.659 --> 00:33:37.000
the beer, which is why, generally, you want
beer warmer. You want it around we found kind

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:43.740
of an average temperature around about around
51 degrees, which is, we say take it out of

00:33:43.740 --> 00:33:45.380
the frig and let it sit about 2-3 minutes--

00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:48.090
&gt;&gt;Hallie: And it is going to warm up in your
hands while you are drinking a beer and you

00:33:48.090 --> 00:33:51.429
can notice the change from the first sip to
the last and that is ok. I mean it is going

00:33:51.429 --> 00:33:54.779
to bring out a little more of the malt, maybe
a little less of the bitterness and that that

00:33:54.779 --> 00:34:01.659
is a cool journey -- you are supposed to kinda
taste different things.

00:34:01.659 --> 00:34:09.380
[inaudible audience question/comment]

00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:15.890
&gt;&gt;Hallie: No, you can do that--

00:34:15.890 --> 00:34:19.440
Christina&gt;&gt;I mean don't warm it up to 100
degrees and then put it in the freezer.

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:20.590
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Extreme temperatures are bad.

00:34:20.590 --> 00:34:24.700
&gt;&gt;Christina: But you know, you can be going
from room temperature and back into the frig

00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:28.300
and vice versa. That happens all the time
in shipping.

00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:30.260
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Uh ha

00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:34.790
&gt;&gt;Christina: Refrigerated trucks to unrefrigerated
trucks, ok the thing that will cause a beer

00:34:34.790 --> 00:34:39.630
to go off or taste skunky, you hear skunky,
you hear that born on date a lot which is

00:34:39.630 --> 00:34:40.630
also, you know --

00:34:40.630 --> 00:34:41.630
&gt;&gt;Hallie: BS

00:34:41.630 --> 00:34:42.630
[laughing]

00:34:42.630 --> 00:34:44.280
&gt;&gt;Hallie: BS, BS, I gonna say it

00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:48.550
&gt;&gt;Christina: Um, the thing that will really
affect your beer more than anything is uh,

00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:53.180
when it is light struck and that what causes
it to go skunky. It is not the age, it is

00:34:53.180 --> 00:34:56.660
not oxidation, that is something different.
What it is, is when light hits it and it's

00:34:56.660 --> 00:35:01.850
when light hits the chemicals that hops have
put in the beer so all those beers that you

00:35:01.850 --> 00:35:05.000
see in the light colored bottles that Hallie
was talking about in clear bottles, when the

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:10.670
light hits them that is what reduces, it is
almost a, it's a chemical compound that mimics

00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:14.390
what a skunk smells like, truly.

00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:16.880
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Same compound which is really interesting.

00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:18.110
[inaudible question from the audience]

00:35:18.110 --> 00:35:21.350
&gt;&gt;Christina: Oxygen is a different thing and
you can have oxidization from uh, the cap

00:35:21.350 --> 00:35:27.960
uh, going bad, which is why generally when
you have beer we talk about aging beer sometimes.

00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:32.320
You can age beers that generally have a higher
alcohol content than, a lot of them have corks

00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:37.540
now corks and caps so you don't have the rust
or that oxidation issue. Um, but some beers

00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:42.270
with caps, you know, I've tasted beers that
have aged 10 years with you know a cap and

00:35:42.270 --> 00:35:46.420
it was fine but that is the risk that you
run a little bit with older beers and aging

00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:52.630
beers that have the cap, brown cap on it.
But you know the born on date, this is from

00:35:52.630 --> 00:35:54.530
the brewery last week I mean that is not going
to make it.

00:35:54.530 --> 00:35:57.790
&gt;&gt;Hallie: No, don't be reading that, like,
don't be reading that like you would your

00:35:57.790 --> 00:36:03.130
milk carton, please. Um, so what do you guys
think of this beer? Anybody like it? Yeah?

00:36:03.130 --> 00:36:07.040
So this is sometimes the, the flavors in this,
the bitterness like I think Christina said

00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:11.780
earlier sometimes people new to beer are kind
of turned off by that but uh, and that is

00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:15.380
fine...whatever, you know; but we do find
that you know when I started drinking craft

00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:18.700
beer I was kinda like ewe that bitterness
freaks me out; but now I crave it. So your

00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:24.060
palate will change, your palate will absolutely
change. Whatever you like now, let's all get

00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:28.700
together again in about 6 months and see.
You will feel differently about every single

00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:33.700
one of these beers and that is pretty cool.
Your palate grows. Because you, once you understand

00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:38.550
what the ingredients are and what these styles
are supposed to taste like, it changes you

00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:42.480
know all the sort of programming that we have
had about beer in this country, which is you

00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:47.390
know it is all supposed to be light and flavorless.
But why would that be? So, this you know if

00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:52.320
you drink this with like a big nice burger,
like a burger at Father's Office, something

00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:57.080
that has a lot of fat and cheese, this, this,
the crispness of this hops are gonna cut right

00:36:57.080 --> 00:37:02.030
through that and it's gonna pair so well with
that food. So, you can see how the different

00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:06.550
styles work better with different meals and
different situations. Situation.

00:37:06.550 --> 00:37:13.110
&gt;&gt;Christina: Alright let's move on, um, let's
go to the porter. So we gave you the IPA and

00:37:13.110 --> 00:37:18.830
it was named because of where it was going
to. This beer is named after who was drinking

00:37:18.830 --> 00:37:23.650
it. It was the porters on the shipyards of
uh England that were doing all the

00:37:23.650 --> 00:37:24.650
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Portering--

00:37:24.650 --> 00:37:27.630
&gt;&gt;Christina: moving and shaking and they drank
this beer for breakfast, they drank it for

00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:33.150
lunch, they drank it for dinner. This was
the style of beer before lighter styles. The

00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:38.040
porters and the stouts, and a stout was named
a stout because it was supposed to be a darker,

00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:39.040
stouter porter.

00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:44.670
&gt;&gt;Hallie: But now the stouts and the porters
when the brewer makes one, they kinda pick

00:37:44.670 --> 00:37:48.050
whether they want to call it a stout or a
porter. They're pretty much the same so there

00:37:48.050 --> 00:37:52.800
is not, not a lot of difference between the
two because uh, Guinness was actually Guinness

00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:55.120
stout porter initially.

00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:56.120
Yes

00:37:56.120 --> 00:38:00.300
[inaudible question/comment room the audience]

00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:03.570
Hallie&gt;&gt;No, no, the question was do porters
have more alcohol than stouts, No. A stout

00:38:03.570 --> 00:38:06.080
can have more it is really it's really um,
it's been--

00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:09.370
[inaudible audience comment]

00:38:09.370 --> 00:38:12.600
They're not, they're not necessarily strong.
We are going to get to a Russian imperial

00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:17.440
stout, which will more alcohol, someone over
here is very excited about that, um , yeah.

00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:18.440
But, but no--

00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:20.110
&gt;&gt;Christina: Be curious in a minute. This
is child's play.

00:38:20.110 --> 00:38:24.080
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Actually when you guys, you know,
we've said that you should not judge a beer

00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:28.540
by its color, please do not look at the glass
and say, "wow, this a meal and I already ate

00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:33.940
and I can't handle this" yah know; taste this
beer, smell this beer. This beer is actually

00:38:33.940 --> 00:38:40.620
lighter in a way than the last beer you had.
It is lighter in alcohol for sure. So, the

00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:45.210
other beer was lighter in color but this is
this is lighter in alcohol. So you can't,

00:38:45.210 --> 00:38:49.470
you can't just look at beer and say this is
stronger because it uses a darker malt. So

00:38:49.470 --> 00:38:52.371
again, the malt is just roasted to a darker
color.

00:38:52.371 --> 00:38:55.740
&gt;&gt;Christina: Yeah this beer is going to feel
lighter on your tongue, it is going to be

00:38:55.740 --> 00:38:59.610
less astringent, it is going to be less hoppy,
it is going to be less bitter and you know

00:38:59.610 --> 00:39:03.720
many people would put those characteristics
into a beer that looks like this.

00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:07.270
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Sorry, I'm, I'm getting some, a
little behind, a little behind.

00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:13.400
&gt;&gt;Christina: Actually if you put your nose
into it, you get those kind of coffee, chocolaty.

00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:16.270
Anyone else, any other flavors you're picking
up?

00:39:16.270 --> 00:39:17.370
&gt;&gt;Audience 4: Molasses

00:39:17.370 --> 00:39:18.380
&gt;&gt;Christina and Hallie: Molasses

00:39:18.380 --> 00:39:22.190
&gt;&gt;Christina: Yes, it comes from the malt and
the residual sugar and a little bit of it

00:39:22.190 --> 00:39:27.372
comes from the actual gross level of the malt.
You'll be able to you know when you say you

00:39:27.372 --> 00:39:31.420
can't judge a beer by its color you can't
judge the bitterness and you can't judge the

00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:36.270
alcohol content but you can do some judging
based on the color.

00:39:36.270 --> 00:39:39.060
[audience inaudible comment]

00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:44.090
I like it, that is like hipster cool, I get
vinyl, I only get vinyl

00:39:44.090 --> 00:39:45.090
[laughing]

00:39:45.090 --> 00:39:47.390
&gt;&gt;Hallie: I get tapered jeans out of this,
um, and a pork pie hat.

00:39:47.390 --> 00:39:51.360
&gt;&gt;Christina: It's like an analogue to me ya
know,

00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:56.271
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Yeah, I know, I mean, ya know, you
like, we said like there is no wrong answer

00:39:56.271 --> 00:40:00.630
with your palate and your nose what you are
getting. Especially you also have to think

00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:04.381
when we are tasting through beers what you
had last is going to influence what you smell

00:40:04.381 --> 00:40:08.420
in this beer. So, you know, if you are going
from an I-P-A there some of those flavors

00:40:08.420 --> 00:40:11.530
might come out in comparison to that, so that's

00:40:11.530 --> 00:40:14.360
[inaudible audience comment/question]

00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:19.960
&gt;&gt;Christina: Well, ya know, sometimes the
yeast will drop out, sometimes they'll change

00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:22.360
the temperature so that the yeast stops being
active.

00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:23.550
&gt;&gt;Hallie: It can only eat so much.

00:40:23.550 --> 00:40:27.050
&gt;&gt;Christina: And sometimes the time...ya know
they'll be...we're just gonna ferment this

00:40:27.050 --> 00:40:31.280
for five days and then they will stop the
process so that--

00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:32.280
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Wow--

00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:33.320
&gt;&gt;Christina: And they also eat each other.

00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:37.440
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Yeah, they're cannibals and that
is when you start getting into all flavors.

00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:40.820
They want to stop before any of that starts.
You can get all flavors from dead yeast you

00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:42.880
can get all flavors from cannibalistic yeast
as well.

00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:47.490
&gt;&gt;Hallie: So, you want some of that sugar
for the flavor too sometimes. But part of

00:40:47.490 --> 00:40:51.340
the reason you taste, you know there is malt
and sugar in the last beer but probably the

00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:54.990
reason you taste it more in this one is because
this doesn't have as many hops. So, if this

00:40:54.990 --> 00:40:59.460
beer if we if this beer had as many hops as
the last one, it would be a totally different

00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:04.310
situation, right? So, so you know, sometimes
it's the preserved sweetness it is not necessarily

00:41:04.310 --> 00:41:09.190
more malt because it is not more alcohol but,
you know, fewer hops are going to make it

00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:10.190
taste sweeter.

00:41:10.190 --> 00:41:14.500
&gt;&gt;Christina: Yeah, that is a good point too
that she brought up about preserved sweetness

00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:18.870
and preserved dryness. When we are drinking
these and we saying oh this is very dry because

00:41:18.870 --> 00:41:23.360
there are a lot of hops in it, it is not that
it actually is dry because dryness in beverages

00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:27.860
and wine and beer really means an absence
of sugar and obviously there is a lot of sugar

00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:30.380
in here. What we are talking about is a preserved
dryness that the tannins and the hops. And

00:41:30.380 --> 00:41:37.560
sometimes there is tannins in the husks of
the grains as well. There is a preserved dryness

00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:40.640
that it will give us to balance out the sweetness
that is always there.

00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:47.130
&gt;&gt;Hallie: We'd also like to take this moment
to tell you that beer does not have more calories

00:41:47.130 --> 00:41:48.280
than every beverage.

00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:49.280
&gt;&gt;Christina: No

00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:53.571
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Um, a lot of people say like, "oh,
I can't drink beer I'm watching what I'm drinking."

00:41:53.571 --> 00:41:58.640
But they'll go have a margarita, so I don't
get it. They're like but it's Cinco de Mayo

00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:04.070
and then I'll have five more margaritas but
I can't have a stout. So, a margarita has

00:42:04.070 --> 00:42:06.580
way more calories than what you are drinking
now--

00:42:06.580 --> 00:42:07.580
&gt;&gt;Christina: 450

00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:08.580
&gt;&gt;Hallie: 450

00:42:08.580 --> 00:42:09.580
&gt;&gt;Christina: I'm just saying.

00:42:09.580 --> 00:42:13.860
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Think about it, think about it,
so you know. Yes some, light beers you know

00:42:13.860 --> 00:42:17.850
have fewer calories but that is all they are
going for by the way is just, not flavor,

00:42:17.850 --> 00:42:18.850
but fewer calories.

00:42:18.850 --> 00:42:20.070
[audience inaudible comment]

00:42:20.070 --> 00:42:22.771
&gt;&gt;Hallie: A regular margarita, a regular margarita.

00:42:22.771 --> 00:42:31.040
&gt;&gt;Christina: Well the same, the 16 oz of,
it is not 16 ounces, 12 ounces maybe 16 ounces

00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:35.410
of margarita vs. a 12 ounce beer generally
a beer is about 250 calories that is not light.

00:42:35.410 --> 00:42:41.080
&gt;&gt;Hallie: You know or people will drink a,
um, you know, a Jack and Coke, I mean how

00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:44.620
many calories are in Coke? Why would that
be fewer than a beer you know it doesn't,

00:42:44.620 --> 00:42:50.390
it is just again, just like the market thing.Anything
that tells you like beer or beer bellies and

00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:53.070
all of that, you know that is just not, just
not fair.

00:42:53.070 --> 00:42:57.420
&gt;&gt;Christina: OK, let's move on. Chimay people,
open the Chimay.

00:42:57.420 --> 00:42:59.290
[audience chatter]

00:42:59.290 --> 00:43:04.501
&gt;&gt;Christina: It's the style. Ok, he said,
"what is it that makes a beer a porter or

00:43:04.501 --> 00:43:05.501
a stout?"

00:43:05.501 --> 00:43:06.501
&gt;&gt;Christina: So--

00:43:06.501 --> 00:43:07.501
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Yeah watch out.

00:43:07.501 --> 00:43:08.501
[laugh]

00:43:08.501 --> 00:43:13.340
&gt;&gt;Christina: It's uh, you know it's a style,
it's the style. So, it's a certain, so he

00:43:13.340 --> 00:43:16.770
asked a good question actually and we haven't
explained this yet like what makes a style

00:43:16.770 --> 00:43:21.490
a style. So every beer is either an ale or
a lager and then there are all these different

00:43:21.490 --> 00:43:27.390
styles underneath it. And uh, really it is
a parameters. There are color parameters,

00:43:27.390 --> 00:43:32.440
um, the type of malt used parameters, uh,
bittering units. They are called I-B-Us, International

00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:37.840
Bittering Units parameters, alcohol content
parameters and so they are kinda set. Like

00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:47.170
a porter will be you know 5 to 7 to 7 1/2
 % alcohol, it will be dark to this kind of

00:43:47.170 --> 00:43:52.560
color. It will be this certain percentage
of bitter. It will have toasty, roasty, nutty

00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:54.760
characteristics. I mean it is not cut and
dry.

00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:58.420
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Very general because, you know,
you'll find some people are making porters

00:43:58.420 --> 00:44:03.490
will vanilla beans in them or they are smoking
the malt and making a smoked porter. So, you

00:44:03.490 --> 00:44:08.370
know, there is a huge variety within the style
profile but it is the general style profile.

00:44:08.370 --> 00:44:13.810
[inaudible audience question]

00:44:13.810 --> 00:44:21.130
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Well, I mean porter isn't an ale.
So, the styles will be either an ale or a

00:44:21.130 --> 00:44:22.130
lager; but um,

00:44:22.130 --> 00:44:27.460
&gt;&gt;Christina: You are saying it is not as easy
to differentiate a porter, between a porter

00:44:27.460 --> 00:44:29.000
and a stout.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:30.030
[inaudible comment]

00:44:30.030 --> 00:44:33.970
&gt;&gt;Christina: Right, no, it is not. That is
when you start getting into the little technicalities.

00:44:33.970 --> 00:44:38.480
What kind of hops did we use? When did we
add them? How bitter is it? Did we add, you

00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:43.510
know, how aromatically hoppy is it? How high
in alcohol? How sweet is it? And that is when

00:44:43.510 --> 00:44:45.134
you will start getting into that evaluating.
It is definitely you know it is very...it's

00:44:45.134 --> 00:44:48.030
a nuance process at that point. The style,
I mean some are just very quintessential,

00:44:48.030 --> 00:44:54.690
like the Saison you guys had is a quintessential
Saison. Like, that is the style that other

00:44:54.690 --> 00:45:03.400
styles move from. Um, this anchor porter,
I think, is a very quintessential American

00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:06.250
style porter.
&gt;&gt;Hallie: And you all know Anchor Brewing

00:45:06.250 --> 00:45:07.250
from San Francisco.

00:45:07.250 --> 00:45:09.010
&gt;&gt;Christina: It just got sold yesterday; I'm
just saying.

00:45:09.010 --> 00:45:10.140
&gt;&gt;Hallie: and we were upset.

00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:12.190
&gt;&gt;Christina: Yeah, we were kinda sad.

00:45:12.190 --> 00:45:13.190
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Um

00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:14.190
[audience chatter]

00:45:14.190 --> 00:45:15.440
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Griff something. Like a big company

00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:17.180
&gt;&gt;Christina: We'll see, we'll see

00:45:17.180 --> 00:45:21.010
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Ok, so you've got your Chimay? Everyone
got their Chimay?

00:45:21.010 --> 00:45:22.010
&gt;&gt;Christina: Chimay!

00:45:22.010 --> 00:45:26.121
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Sniff this one. Now, really try
to, this is you know again this is a darker

00:45:26.121 --> 00:45:31.860
in color beer so you know they are using a
darker roasted malt but totally different

00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:34.290
flavor profile, we think.

00:45:34.290 --> 00:45:37.900
&gt;&gt;Christina: So we talked about before how
you can't say a beer is a Belgian beer if

00:45:37.900 --> 00:45:41.120
it doesn't come from Belgian; you call it
a Belgian style like the Hitachino Belgian

00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:47.400
style white ale. Um, and then we had a Belgian
beer with a Saison Dupont. There are also

00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:50.750
Abbey Ales and Trappist Ales. You may have
heard of that.

00:45:50.750 --> 00:45:56.460
Abby Ales are beers that were made, used to
be made maybe back in the day by monks in

00:45:56.460 --> 00:46:01.010
Abbeys but now they are no longer controlled
by monks. They are, you know they are either

00:46:01.010 --> 00:46:05.110
secular people in the same buildings or maybe
they sold proprietary rights, their yeast,

00:46:05.110 --> 00:46:09.020
and their recipe and somebody else is brewing
it for them in that same kind of tradition

00:46:09.020 --> 00:46:10.020
and style.

00:46:10.020 --> 00:46:15.770
But there are also traps breweries and there
are only seven Trappist breweries in the world

00:46:15.770 --> 00:46:20.070
and Chimay happens to be one of them. And
Trappist breweries are ones that are still

00:46:20.070 --> 00:46:24.780
controlled by monks and Trappist breweries,
in theory, should only be brewing the beer

00:46:24.780 --> 00:46:31.750
really to sustain themselves as a monastery.
They should be monks first and brewers second.

00:46:31.750 --> 00:46:35.040
And it is, you know, kind of the way they
made bread or they made cheese or made chocolate

00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:38.790
and sold it to the public and then they could
raise money to live as monks.

00:46:38.790 --> 00:46:41.990
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Yeah, and a lot of times they brewed
this beer to sustain themselves while they

00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:44.650
were fasting which we think is interesting.

00:46:44.650 --> 00:46:45.650
[laughing]

00:46:45.650 --> 00:46:48.850
&gt;&gt;Hallie: I don't know if you have ever gone
three days with just drinking beer but, um,

00:46:48.850 --> 00:46:51.760
we've come pretty close actually I'd have
to say, but uh--

00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:52.760
[laughing]

00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:56.630
&gt;&gt;Christina: We think that is the reason for
fasting actually is like, let's just drink

00:46:56.630 --> 00:46:57.630
beer.

00:46:57.630 --> 00:46:59.910
&gt;&gt;Hallie: We also think that is the reason
for keeping the doors closed to the outer

00:46:59.910 --> 00:47:03.650
public because you know they are taking off
those robes and dancing on the tables, I'm

00:47:03.650 --> 00:47:05.100
just sayin'--

00:47:05.100 --> 00:47:06.250
[laughing]

00:47:06.250 --> 00:47:10.120
&gt;&gt;Audience 5: Yeah, every day is a toga party.

00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:11.120
&gt;&gt;Hallie: What is that?

00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:12.120
&gt;&gt;Audience comment5: Every day is a toga party.

00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:13.120
&gt;&gt;Christina: Yeah, let's just wear togas all
the time.

00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:14.120
&gt;&gt;Hallie: yeah, yeah

00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:15.120
[laugh]

00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:16.770
&gt;&gt;Hallie: I think they are hiding some beers
under those robes.

00:47:16.770 --> 00:47:18.820
&gt;&gt;Christina: Nip of this; nip of that.

00:47:18.820 --> 00:47:22.940
&gt;&gt;Hallie: But they also make you know cheese;
and they make bread; and they make all these

00:47:22.940 --> 00:47:29.160
things, wonderful things, to sustain the birds,
whatever the monastery. I'm like, the birds.

00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:32.720
&gt;&gt;Christina: The way we remember there are
7 Trappist breweries and the way we remember

00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:33.720
them is --

00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:35.500
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Oh, I love this. Wow, what a rack.

00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:37.950
&gt;&gt;Christina: Mnemonic device, wow what a rack.

00:47:37.950 --> 00:47:39.530
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Will you forget that?

00:47:39.530 --> 00:47:40.530
&gt;&gt;Christina: Never.

00:47:40.530 --> 00:47:41.530
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Never.

00:47:41.530 --> 00:47:46.820
&gt;&gt;Christina: So, there is wow there is Westmalle
or Westvleteren and then what a and rack,

00:47:46.820 --> 00:47:49.270
Rochefort, Achel, Chimay and Koningshoeven.

00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:50.270
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Whew!

00:47:50.270 --> 00:47:54.000
&gt;&gt;Christina: That is in the book too. Wow,
are you impressed?

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:55.000
[clapping]

00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:57.590
&gt;&gt;Hallie: We have to thank our friend Charlie
Farrell, who is a dear friend of ours, who

00:47:57.590 --> 00:48:03.500
is really good at mnemonic device so you will
never forget that now. So, those are the only

00:48:03.500 --> 00:48:08.240
ones where the beer is made by monks in a
monastery, so that is how it sets apart. And

00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:11.810
it is pretty cool because a lot of these recipes
are very old and like Christina said they

00:48:11.810 --> 00:48:16.070
might have their own proprietary yeast which
is a secret, you know a secret yeast, secret

00:48:16.070 --> 00:48:17.070
recipe.

00:48:17.070 --> 00:48:18.070
&gt;&gt;Christina: Almost, actually all of them
do.

00:48:18.070 --> 00:48:19.070
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Yeah, yeah.

00:48:19.070 --> 00:48:20.070
&gt;&gt;Christina: The traps

00:48:20.070 --> 00:48:21.070
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Right

00:48:21.070 --> 00:48:23.090
&gt;&gt;Christina: And in addition to that, they
you know there is one Velmala which we've

00:48:23.090 --> 00:48:30.390
only had once or twice that actually isn't
even sold in the United States. Because the

00:48:30.390 --> 00:48:37.150
Trappist community is you know it's like A-L-C
like with the wine in France, except even

00:48:37.150 --> 00:48:42.790
more strict. And they keep very tight tabs
on each other and, for instance, Chimay is

00:48:42.790 --> 00:48:46.590
the biggest. You see Chimay all over the place
and Chimay, you know, some people are starting

00:48:46.590 --> 00:48:50.670
to be like how could you possibly be making
that much beer if you are concentrating on

00:48:50.670 --> 00:48:55.400
like being a monk, you know? So, you know
there is some kind of people who are looking

00:48:55.400 --> 00:49:02.590
into that. They've moved to an abstract form
base recipe which is kinda also dicey in the

00:49:02.590 --> 00:49:05.000
traps world you know but they have to do that
because of the space that they have. You are

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:07.360
not allowed to have a traps brewery that has
a plant and you know Sheboygan.

00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:08.360
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Right.

00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:14.290
&gt;&gt;Christina: You have to have your own, you
know, you have to be everything has to be

00:49:14.290 --> 00:49:18.820
under control of the monastery. You can have
a couple of secular people working for you;

00:49:18.820 --> 00:49:22.910
but everything really has to be very tightly
under the monastic control.

00:49:22.910 --> 00:49:24.850
&gt;&gt;Hallie: So, what do you guys get from this
one?

00:49:24.850 --> 00:49:26.840
[inaudible audience comments]

00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:29.190
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Different fruit, like dark fruit
perhaps?

00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:30.190
&gt;&gt;Christina: Figs?

00:49:30.190 --> 00:49:31.190
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Plums?

00:49:31.190 --> 00:49:32.190
&gt;&gt;Christina: Anyone?

00:49:32.190 --> 00:49:33.190
&gt;&gt;Hallie: A little spice?

00:49:33.190 --> 00:49:34.780
&gt;&gt;Christina: Old world, fruit…

00:49:34.780 --> 00:49:35.780
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Cork?

00:49:35.780 --> 00:49:36.780
&gt;&gt;Christina: Raisin, very good.

00:49:36.780 --> 00:49:41.260
&gt;&gt;Hallie: A little earthiness there, yeah
a little wood. I get some anise when I drink

00:49:41.260 --> 00:49:42.260
this.

00:49:42.260 --> 00:49:43.260
&gt;&gt;Christina: Careful--

00:49:43.260 --> 00:49:44.280
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Like some of that licorice comes
through for me.

00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:45.280
[laughing]

00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:50.650
&gt;&gt;Hallie: I'm just sharing, um but again this
is very different from the last style, right?

00:49:50.650 --> 00:49:57.970
I mean you can definitely tell this is higher
alcohol content also. Um, and it, this is

00:49:57.970 --> 00:50:02.820
good because it opened next beer. We have
the St. Bernardus. So the St. Bernardustriple.

00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:03.820
This was um--

00:50:03.820 --> 00:50:05.580
&gt;&gt;Christina: Let's talk about the double.

00:50:05.580 --> 00:50:06.640
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Double triple, right.

00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:09.580
&gt;&gt;Christina: So, open the next beer and we
will get started on that and we will tell

00:50:09.580 --> 00:50:11.471
you the difference between doubles and triples.

00:50:11.471 --> 00:50:18.840
&gt;&gt;Hallie: And it is counter intuitive, you
guys got that open? The St. Bernardus triple?

00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:25.700
It's the large bottle. I know,it gets a lot
harder towards the end, it gets warmer and

00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:28.680
it gets a lot harder to follow

00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:31.870
&gt;&gt;Christina: OK, so a double and triple, these
are both um

00:50:31.870 --> 00:50:32.870
[audience chatter]

00:50:32.870 --> 00:50:39.910
Guys, these are both styles that were rooted
in the monastic tradition of brewing beer.

00:50:39.910 --> 00:50:48.750
Um, actually the monks themselves brew "single."
They don't call it a "single" but it is their

00:50:48.750 --> 00:50:52.430
table ale, like a table beer and that is the
beer that they drink themselves, lower alcohol

00:50:52.430 --> 00:50:58.470
content than what we are having. Then they
go through another fermentation generally

00:50:58.470 --> 00:51:05.234
and make a stronger darker, higher alcohol
content called the double and the double is

00:51:05.234 --> 00:51:12.250
a style. It is a style of beer. It has parameters,
it has color parameters, flavor parameters,

00:51:12.250 --> 00:51:15.270
bittering parameters, um, and it can mean
a couple of different things.

00:51:15.270 --> 00:51:18.810
&gt;&gt;Hallie: So, it is not necessarily double
the alcohol, it is not necessarily double

00:51:18.810 --> 00:51:24.850
the ingredients which is a little confusing;
but doubles typically typically tend to be

00:51:24.850 --> 00:51:29.170
darker in color and have a little more of
that dark fruit and spice like we just had

00:51:29.170 --> 00:51:35.990
in the Chimay . They tend to be fairly high
in alcohol, sometimes around 6, 7, to 8%.

00:51:35.990 --> 00:51:42.090
But again it is a style parameter so it doesn't
necessarily mean double some original ale.

00:51:42.090 --> 00:51:46.850
Sometimes it can; but, but typically it is
a darker color and spice and then you pour

00:51:46.850 --> 00:51:53.860
this triple and sort of counter intuitively
the triple is, thank you, a lighter in color,

00:51:53.860 --> 00:52:00.800
right? So triples tend to have a malt that
has not been roasted as dark, so it is a lighter

00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:07.780
colored malt. Um, and have a different sometimes
biscuity, sometimes some fruit and spice but

00:52:07.780 --> 00:52:11.930
not so much your plums and figs, maybe a little
citrus/orange rind.

00:52:11.930 --> 00:52:17.940
&gt;&gt;Christina: Also strangely enough, with the
fermentation process uh, beers get lighter

00:52:17.940 --> 00:52:22.110
with each fermentation process. So, you know
like she said before a triple can mean a lot

00:52:22.110 --> 00:52:25.421
of different things. It could mean that it
was triple the strength of the pale ale that

00:52:25.421 --> 00:52:30.130
they meant. It could mean that it was fermented
three times. It could mean a lot of things;

00:52:30.130 --> 00:52:35.070
but what it does definitely mean is that it
is pretty light color, it's high alcohol content,

00:52:35.070 --> 00:52:41.050
it's got flavors of lemon and pepper and,
and it can have a little bit of sourness and

00:52:41.050 --> 00:52:44.370
you know it is really the parameters; but
it is an interesting style. It's one that

00:52:44.370 --> 00:52:48.190
has been duplicated all over Belgian that
was started at these monasteries, these doubles

00:52:48.190 --> 00:52:53.210
and triples styles.

00:52:53.210 --> 00:53:00.730
[inaudible audience talk]

00:53:00.730 --> 00:53:09.060
&gt;&gt;Christina: So he is saying "how do you get
such high alcohol content um . . . when alcohol

00:53:09.060 --> 00:53:14.990
is actually toxic and can kill the yeast in
the beer?" Well, they just add more sugar

00:53:14.990 --> 00:53:20.390
and add more yeast. So, they also add a candy
sugar that we had talked about before that

00:53:20.390 --> 00:53:25.980
speeds that process up so that the yeast can
do their thing before it gets to the point

00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:26.980
that,

00:53:26.980 --> 00:53:31.160
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Yeah, so there is a lot of different
ways that they could accomplish that. Sometimes

00:53:31.160 --> 00:53:36.150
different yeasts can handle more sugar and
that is called what you were saying, a secondary

00:53:36.150 --> 00:53:40.590
fermentation. So, sometimes you will see that
beers were fermented in the bottle, so they

00:53:40.590 --> 00:53:45.860
will add some of that sugar um, for the yeast
to create more alcohol in the bottle. Add

00:53:45.860 --> 00:53:50.830
some sugar maybe, sometimes add some yeast
and then you have another fermentation happening

00:53:50.830 --> 00:53:51.830
in the bottle.

00:53:51.830 --> 00:53:55.740
&gt;&gt;Christina: And those are more robusty strength.

00:53:55.740 --> 00:53:59.130
[inaudible audience comment or question]

00:53:59.130 --> 00:54:00.480
&gt;&gt;Christina: Yes?

00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:07.930
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Open the last beer while we are
talking about this....

00:54:07.930 --> 00:54:11.990
&gt;&gt;Christina: Alright, open them all up.

00:54:11.990 --> 00:54:12.990
[laughing]

00:54:12.990 --> 00:54:14.650
&gt;&gt;Hallie: I also can't count.

00:54:14.650 --> 00:54:15.650
&gt;&gt;Christina: Right

00:54:15.650 --> 00:54:18.620
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Ok, yeah, open all the beers, yeah
and let's move through them.

00:54:18.620 --> 00:54:19.620
&gt;&gt;Christina: I keep this prize underneath
the Lambic.

00:54:19.620 --> 00:54:23.620
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Well, I'll....you want me to go
first?

00:54:23.620 --> 00:54:28.500
&gt;&gt;Christina: Yeah, you go first, favorite
beer for Hallie.

00:54:28.500 --> 00:54:38.270
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Ok, here, here is what I like. I
like really earthy, funky, sour, dirty flavors,

00:54:38.270 --> 00:54:42.330
I know that sounds gross; but if someone says
I have a beer and it tastes like dirty socks,

00:54:42.330 --> 00:54:48.761
I will order that beer. So, one of my favorites
is Orval, which is a Trappist beer so it is

00:54:48.761 --> 00:54:54.650
a Belgian beer made by monks in a monastery.
It is really earthy, really dry, very complex,

00:54:54.650 --> 00:55:01.130
not super high in alcohol, 6.9 so I can drink
several of them and um, the complexity is

00:55:01.130 --> 00:55:05.240
so good that I could definitely desert island
that beer. That would be my answer.

00:55:05.240 --> 00:55:07.180
&gt;&gt;Christina: Did you get yours open already?

00:55:07.180 --> 00:55:09.850
[audience voice] I passed it around - yeah

00:55:09.850 --> 00:55:13.740
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Now don't mix the last three,

00:55:13.740 --> 00:55:14.740
&gt;&gt;Christina: Yeah, don't mix them.

00:55:14.740 --> 00:55:18.840
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Just try them. That would be a beer
cocktail, which we will get into another time.

00:55:18.840 --> 00:55:19.840
Christina, your favorite beer?

00:55:19.840 --> 00:55:24.920
&gt;&gt;Christina: If I had to, you know, I would
say that my favorite beer is not the one that

00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:30.024
I would take on a desert island with me because
my favorite beer would kill my palate and

00:55:30.024 --> 00:55:35.140
I can't, I wouldn't be able to have it a lot.
Do you know what I mean? Um, I'm a big fan

00:55:35.140 --> 00:55:40.030
of the session beer which is one that is a
little more nuance. It doesn't kill your palate.

00:55:40.030 --> 00:55:44.120
You can have 2 or 3 and not loose…it's called
a session because you can actually have a

00:55:44.120 --> 00:55:48.440
conversation, you know, it doesn't necessarily
break your train of thought. Um, I really

00:55:48.440 --> 00:55:53.080
love this E-S-B from AleSmith in San Diego.
It is really delicious. E-S-B means Extra

00:55:53.080 --> 00:55:58.980
Special Bitter. It is a style. It is not especially
bitter; it is just a style of beer. It is

00:55:58.980 --> 00:56:04.501
more bitter than like the porter or the sweeter
porters and stouts. And also a white ale,

00:56:04.501 --> 00:56:09.940
like the Hitachino that we tried, you know
that is the same style that Hoegaarden is,

00:56:09.940 --> 00:56:15.831
blue moon is, that you know um, Lost Coast
Great White. That is a great beer. It is fermented

00:56:15.831 --> 00:56:20.040
with lemongrass. I'd take that with me on
a desert island.

00:56:20.040 --> 00:56:21.430
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Christina wants like, eight beers
then.

00:56:21.430 --> 00:56:25.141
&gt;&gt;Christina: I actually wrote an article,
what would you, you know, when you say take

00:56:25.141 --> 00:56:29.370
five beers on a desert island and it was twenty
beers that I ended up with. I said that I

00:56:29.370 --> 00:56:31.900
actually had to have a Kegerater system and
some kind of electric generation.

00:56:31.900 --> 00:56:34.730
&gt;&gt;Hallie: She really doesn't want to go to
a desert island.

00:56:34.730 --> 00:56:35.730
[laugh]

00:56:35.730 --> 00:56:38.650
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Ok, so you guys have the Palm, are
you drinking the Palm? What are you drinking?

00:56:38.650 --> 00:56:41.830
I'm drinking half and half ha half Palm, half--

00:56:41.830 --> 00:56:43.980
&gt;&gt;Christina: Who is drinking the fruit beer,
it smells like apples?

00:56:43.980 --> 00:56:50.180
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Now, you know we have a combination
right now. Let's just go over the apple right

00:56:50.180 --> 00:56:51.180
now.

00:56:51.180 --> 00:56:53.190
&gt;&gt;Christina: So we are going to go through
the fruit beers and apple beer. Someone had

00:56:53.190 --> 00:56:57.911
mentioned before about sour beers. This is
also Belgian beer. This is called a Lambic

00:56:57.911 --> 00:57:02.500
and a lot of times in America we think of
Lambic as super sweet, fruity beers, which

00:57:02.500 --> 00:57:07.310
is what this beer is. This is made for us
Americans because the Belgians don't think

00:57:07.310 --> 00:57:12.190
that we are sophisticated enough to understand
a sour beer, which is true.

00:57:12.190 --> 00:57:13.190
[laugh]

00:57:13.190 --> 00:57:18.470
But we are starting to be able to understand
it. A Lambic is a beer that is fermented.

00:57:18.470 --> 00:57:23.710
It is wild fermented, which means that they
don't add yeast to the beer artificially.

00:57:23.710 --> 00:57:30.360
They just open up the top of the vat, literally,
and let whatever yeast and anything else that

00:57:30.360 --> 00:57:33.410
exists in the air fall into the beer. We are
talking bugs--

00:57:33.410 --> 00:57:39.410
&gt;&gt;Hallie: We are talking bugs, dirt, spiders,
cobwebs. Some hair from the guy making the

00:57:39.410 --> 00:57:42.330
beer, whatever, let it all in, it is very
earthy.

00:57:42.330 --> 00:57:47.410
&gt;&gt;Christina: But it makes a really, really
delicious beer, super but super sour and funky.

00:57:47.410 --> 00:57:49.100
Yeah, Winter Wheat has something--

00:57:49.100 --> 00:57:53.021
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Well, yeah that is the yeast. Yeah,
the yeast that is naturally occurring in the

00:57:53.021 --> 00:57:57.680
air uh, you know changes from region to region.
It is kind of like if you think of sour dough

00:57:57.680 --> 00:58:01.710
bread from San Francisco it is the yeast that
in the air that kinda got into that bread

00:58:01.710 --> 00:58:06.970
and made it sour. Same thing happens to beer.
So, there are beers that are intentionally

00:58:06.970 --> 00:58:10.900
a sour and earthy flavor and people often
when they taste it are like this is gross;

00:58:10.900 --> 00:58:12.270
but it is meant to be that way. Yeah.

00:58:12.270 --> 00:58:13.370
[inaudible audience question]

00:58:13.370 --> 00:58:14.500
&gt;&gt;Hallie: They are

00:58:14.500 --> 00:58:15.500
&gt;&gt;Christina: Yeah

00:58:15.500 --> 00:58:19.610
&gt;&gt;Hallie: So, this is beer then it is a Lambic
that is then blended with apple, some apples

00:58:19.610 --> 00:58:24.340
and they have different varieties so there
is a peach flavor of this beer and so they'll,

00:58:24.340 --> 00:58:28.510
Lambics they will combine with cherries or
peach or apples --

00:58:28.510 --> 00:58:32.600
Christina&gt;&gt;like if you heard of a Creek beer,
that is combine with cherries. If you heard

00:58:32.600 --> 00:58:38.430
of a Framboise, that is combined with raspberry;
um, this one is combined with apple. And this

00:58:38.430 --> 00:58:44.270
is a beer that is supposed to be really, really
sour and tart and then they add the fruit

00:58:44.270 --> 00:58:50.980
so that it is palatable. So, fruit beer isn't
necessarily a bad thing and if you had a true

00:58:50.980 --> 00:58:54.470
Lambic beer in Belgium it would be both very,
very sour and both very sweet.

00:58:54.470 --> 00:58:58.050
&gt;&gt;Hallie: It is really about the ingredients.
If you are using real apples, if you are using

00:58:58.050 --> 00:59:02.270
real cherries it is just like fruit juice,
it has a sour element if you eat a cherry

00:59:02.270 --> 00:59:06.990
it has a sour element. It is not just sugar.
So when you have a sour ale if it is using

00:59:06.990 --> 00:59:11.850
those true ingredients it is going to have
that full body. So, uh, next beer.

00:59:11.850 --> 00:59:20.000
&gt;&gt;Christina: Well, it is a whole thing they
do a lot of combining they do have a negociant

00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:25.570
the same way that Champaign does to figure
out how much fruit to add. They'll add a little

00:59:25.570 --> 00:59:29.130
bit of the batch that they made before or
maybe the batch they made three years ago

00:59:29.130 --> 00:59:32.610
to kind of to make sure that the consistency
is there.

00:59:32.610 --> 00:59:38.880
&gt;&gt;Hallie: So, you guys the, the Lambics, I
would swirl it out maybe with uh, a little

00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:44.110
water or something and dump it cause it is
uh, going to get into your next beer and then

00:59:44.110 --> 00:59:46.130
pour the next Russian Imperial stout, right?

00:59:46.130 --> 00:59:48.350
Christina&gt;&gt;Whose having what?

00:59:48.350 --> 00:59:52.550
&gt;&gt;Hallie: So, pour the Russian imperial stout
for those of you who don't have it and some

00:59:52.550 --> 00:59:55.420
of you are going backwards. Ok, whatever,
that is cool.

00:59:55.420 --> 01:00:00.960
&gt;&gt;Christina: The Russian Imperial stout is
uh, um, a stout that is even bigger and stronger

01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:05.910
than a stout and so it has a similar uh, story
as the I-P-A;

01:00:05.910 --> 01:00:10.600
&gt;&gt;Hallie: So it is the same thing when they
went to Russia with the stouts they have the

01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:14.760
same problem. They went sour, they went bad
so they are like we are going to add we're

01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:17.880
gonna make it a higher alcohol; we're going
to add some more hops. So, they ended up with

01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:22.910
the Russian imperial stout and uh, the Russians
liked it. And apparently uh, Catherine the

01:00:22.910 --> 01:00:26.590
Great was a great fan of this beer, which
we love because a lot of women say, "I don't

01:00:26.590 --> 01:00:30.270
like big, dark beers!" But Catherine, if it
is good enough for Catherine the Great, I'm

01:00:30.270 --> 01:00:31.270
sorry people.

01:00:31.270 --> 01:00:34.100
&gt;&gt;Christina: We call her the first beer chick,
Catherine the Great.

01:00:34.100 --> 01:00:37.190
&gt;&gt;Hallie: Yeah there is actually a, a Russian
Imperial stout from Portsmith Brewery called

01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:38.710
Kate the Great. It's delicious!

01:00:38.710 --> 01:00:39.710
&gt;&gt;Christina: Really good, It's really good.

01:00:39.710 --> 01:00:40.710
&gt;&gt;Hallie: So, uh…

01:00:40.710 --> 01:00:41.710
[inaudible comment from the audience]

01:00:41.710 --> 01:00:42.710
&gt;&gt;Christina: What? Yeah, that's why.

01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:47.260
&gt;&gt;Hallie: That's why, cause Germans will drink
beer. Yeah, so, you know, smell this, think

01:00:47.260 --> 01:00:49.190
about how it is different than the porter
we had.

01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:53.870
&gt;&gt;Christina: This is also about 10.2 or is
it less?

01:00:53.870 --> 01:00:56.430
&gt;&gt;Hallie: 9 I think, 9 or 10% alcohol.

01:00:56.430 --> 01:01:00.720
&gt;&gt;Christina: So this is big alcohol, this
tastes like coffee, tastes like espresso,

01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:03.920
it tastes sweet, it tastes malty it is huge!

01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:08.300
&gt;&gt;Hallie: If you pour this over vanilla gelato,
you will be very happy!

01:01:08.300 --> 01:01:09.570
&gt;&gt;Christina: A little off lagato action.

01:01:09.570 --> 01:01:13.690
&gt;&gt;Hallie: So we like to do beers at the end
of a meal sort of in place of an expresso

01:01:13.690 --> 01:01:18.720
or in place of a bourbon, which you will see
in the next beer. It is fun to play with beer

01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:23.380
with desserts. You can have this with a chocolate
flowerless chocolate cake. You know, beer

01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:28.780
does much better with desserts and cheese
plates than wine because you know it has more

01:01:28.780 --> 01:01:32.501
of those, some beers can have more of those
expresso chocolate elements. You can have

01:01:32.501 --> 01:01:36.630
a chocolate stout, you can have a beer aged
in bourbon. These are things that you know

01:01:36.630 --> 01:01:40.380
you can't necessarily do with wine. So, it
opens it up to all these flavors, or you could

01:01:40.380 --> 01:01:41.981
have that that Lambic with cheesecake.

01:01:41.981 --> 01:01:42.981
&gt;&gt;Christina: Lambic with a cheesecake

01:01:42.981 --> 01:01:48.420
&gt;&gt;Hallie: I mean think about how awesome this
would be. You guys like this? Anyone? Yeah,

01:01:48.420 --> 01:01:52.700
it is strong, yeah, it'll definitely uh, it'll
hit you, in a good, good way.

01:01:52.700 --> 01:01:57.730
&gt;&gt;Christina: Sooner or later, Ok, so last
beer is one of our very, very favorites. It

01:01:57.730 --> 01:02:03.960
is called the Allagash Cru. It is from Portland,
Maine. A good friend of ours, Rob Todd is

01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:05.360
the brewer. Great guy.

01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:07.190
&gt;&gt;Hallie: You might've had his Allagash White.

01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:11.930
&gt;&gt;Christina: Which is the same style as the
Hitachino white that we had here. Um, this

01:02:11.930 --> 01:02:16.250
beer is different. It's a triple in style.
It's a Belgian style triple and then it is

01:02:16.250 --> 01:02:22.323
aged in Bourbon barrels. It's aged in Jim
Beam barrels and that is kind of a trend right

01:02:22.323 --> 01:02:25.230
now with craft beer. You can get a lot of
different styles, especially ones with high

01:02:25.230 --> 01:02:29.570
alcohol content. They are being aged in Pinot
Noir barrel, bourbon barrels, whiskey barrels,

01:02:29.570 --> 01:02:35.030
scotch barrels and it really imparts a couple
interesting things. It imparts the woodiness,

01:02:35.030 --> 01:02:40.640
the dryness from the tannins in the wood,
and it also just imparts awesome whiskey notes

01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:45.520
and you can really feel it in the exhaust.
I used to call it the air in my mouth until

01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:49.090
somebody told me it was called the exhaust.

01:02:49.090 --> 01:02:50.090
[laugh]

01:02:50.090 --> 01:02:57.560
But you can really get some nice whiskey aromatics
comin in and goin out.

01:02:57.560 --> 01:03:02.550
&gt;&gt;Hallie: It adds a really nice dimension;
it adds a really nice dimension to beer. So,

01:03:02.550 --> 01:03:07.200
this again instead of having your Jim Bean
or having any bourbon at the end of a meal,

01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:13.550
you have this with your dessert or after your
meal. I mean you could imagine it is delicious,

01:03:13.550 --> 01:03:16.030
high alcohol, I think it is 11, is that right?

01:03:16.030 --> 01:03:17.251
&gt;&gt;Christina: Yeah, it's 11.2%, I think.

01:03:17.251 --> 01:03:23.060
&gt;&gt;Hallie: OK, so, the alcohol, so mimics having
some liquor at the end of a meal. This is

01:03:23.060 --> 01:03:28.660
a very popular....but it also has you know
the barrels can also impart some vanilla notes.

01:03:28.660 --> 01:03:33.330
Again, if you put some vanilla gelato with
this, which we've had, obviously we've done

01:03:33.330 --> 01:03:38.100
a lot of beer and dessert mixing and uh, haha,
it is delicious.

01:03:38.100 --> 01:03:39.690
&gt;&gt;Christina: Cheese, cheese is really good
too.

01:03:39.690 --> 01:03:42.901
&gt;&gt;Hallie: We have a recipe in the book using
this with a chocolate cake

01:03:42.901 --> 01:03:46.390
&gt;&gt;Christina: Almost all these beers are in
the book. Definitely all the styles are in

01:03:46.390 --> 01:03:51.690
the book. Uh, it goes into much more detail
and much more detail about the ingredients

01:03:51.690 --> 01:03:55.960
in beer and all of that. It will be much more
understandable than the two of us swilling

01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:57.200
away, trying to explain it.

01:03:57.200 --> 01:03:58.200
[laughing]

01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:00.280
&gt;&gt;Christina: But thank you so much for coming
and listening to us and....

01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:01.280
[clapping and audience chatter]

01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:02.280
