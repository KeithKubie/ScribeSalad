00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
Today's video is sponsored by NordVPN. Hey guys I'm Nate welcome back to the workshop today. We're gonna take something

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.268
That's not normally very secure and see if we can build something strong out of it

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.519
We're gonna make a puzzle box using Lego pieces

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.709
This is not supposed to be an exact set of

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:18.840
Step-by-step instructions because the different building blocks that everyone may have available will change from place to place

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:25.439
But the ideas that we're gonna be using should be able to be used and expanded on with what you've got available

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.069
We've got a bunch of our Lego bricks. Let's get started assembling the first thing

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.579
I want to do is make the inner box that will eventually hold our prize

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.459
Start by giving ourselves a base and you may notice

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.390
I'm not wearing gloves today, and it's because my gloves are black and most of these pieces are black and I'd

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.239
I just don't want everything to blend together on camera. We want to give ourselves the most inside space on this box

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.739
We're gonna need some walls

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.299
I like these large pieces with a flat open areas partly because if we install them with

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:54.029
Open side in it gives us a little bit more

00:00:54.309 --> 00:01:00.659
Interior space than we would get if we just built up the walls with normal bricks. I've got a few of these

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.519
different styles that

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:05.728
Should give us a little bit more interior space

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.580
Build up some walls around this

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.879
Alright, there's a box that will hold some stuff. We're gonna want our box to be removable from whatever security

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:15.880
We build around it

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.930
So let's use some of these smoother pieces to attach onto the top and then hopefully that will let us

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.409
Slide the box in and out of its case more easily now

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.739
We need to build a larger box that goes around this one and can lock in place

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.250
So it's not just a box in a box, but it's a box locked in a box

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:38.400
So let's use some more of these smooth pieces to give ourselves a little bit of a sliding surface

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:43.859
Those are the same length as our box so that way we should be able to have the box slide nicely on those rails

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.929
Nice and slidey perfect lets throw a slider on the front

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.550
That's not really gonna help with the movement much

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:56.910
But it is gonna make it more of a continuous flat plane our box doesn't look like it's just sort of

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:03.899
Floating over the rails. It's not quite so obvious where the access point is gonna be so this is a good sliding base

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.400
But it's not gonna secure it much, so let's start adding a little bit onto the sides

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.029
We've now extended our base with a larger square underneath it

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.640
I think we'll be able to use that to build more walls and a ceiling around our strongbox

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.980
While that plastic wall is getting built, let's talk about our sponsor for today's video NordVPN

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.619
Which helps build a digital wall around your data online

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.340
use of unsecured or public Wi-Fi at places like coffee shops

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:38.580
airports or hotels is among the easiest ways for hackers to access your sensitive info in the time it takes for you to check a

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:44.699
Few emails or your social media someone can easily scrape logging or other sensitive info passed beyond the really bad guys

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.120
recent changes to net neutrality

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:52.770
Laws mean your ISP can start throttling bandwidth as well as collecting and selling more info about your browsing all stuff

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.679
That's easy to prevent with a VPN Virtual Private Networks

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.589
Essentially build a wall around your info a little stronger than a lego lockbox protecting it from such prying eyes

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.850
Nord double encrypts all your info regardless of whether you're on your phone laptop

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.110
or at home on a desktop

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:12.660
And they do not keep any logs of your activity like some other VPNs and as an added bonus it even comes with a free

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.839
Ad blocker Nord received an Editors Choice Award and was the only

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:35.550
I Think by using some of these bricks with the holes in it we may be able to add something of a locking mechanism

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.589
onto our box let's take out one of the bricks in our inner box and

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:45.149
add in a brick that has a hole in it and maybe then we can get them to line up and work as a

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.150
lock

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:55.589
Those holes lining up if we put in this three brick wide peg

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.280
That should lock it in place now

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.159
It's lined up flush with the front of our secure box

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.219
But it can't move anywhere until that peg is pulled out

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:09.718
This isn't very flush right now the sides aren't coming up as high as our inner box

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:13.829
Let's just add a little bit more on to that we can add a ceiling on to it

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:19.829
Now our inner box is entirely contained, and it doesn't move until we pull out our lock once we pull out the lock

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:28.258
That can slide out so that's level one of our security, but we can go more secure instead of just pushing it out

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:33.299
I think we can build a mechanism that will push it out for us in fact since it's a lock box

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.829
I really kind of like the idea of having a key something you put into a slot and turn

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:42.749
To really get the box out got here one of our little plus cross-section little

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:49.919
Sticks. I don't really know the name for all the different terms, but it should work pretty well to make our skeleton key

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:51.930
Let's add a tooth on to it

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.919
Lets add some of these little pegs just to hold that tooth right where we want it in place

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.310
I've Got one of these little wheel pieces that has the same

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:05.369
Plus cross-section designed to fit over these so let's add that on and that to me looks like a key

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.679
It's as I said not the fanciest key in the world

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:13.349
but it will turn and it'll be a key let's try and build something that lets us twist our key and

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.769
Have that be the mechanism that pushes the box out

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.109
He goes in here we want to stop it from going any farther

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.549
And now it has a nice little spot that it will lock into place

00:05:34.069 --> 00:05:38.289
Build a back wall on so our key doesn't fly out in the wrong spot

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.420
We've got these side bricks that are full of the holes

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:51.140
And I kinda want to just keep using that aesthetic a little bit, I'm gonna put of those pieces on the back here

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:58.320
Just need to

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:59.640
There you go

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:05.299
So now we've added a keyhole on to the back of our box, and we still have the whole thing as one

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:10.070
Entire integral unit well our key is working and our lock is working

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.039
But our key is still just sort of you know

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:17.779
Where do you keep the key to make sure that's secure I don't want to just carry it on my pocket

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:21.140
This is a lego key. I might break it. I might lose it I

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:25.730
Think I would like to have it with the box, but I want the key to be secure as well

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:31.159
To just have it sitting on top. It's a little easy to find so I think we can build a whole

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.950
Disguising mechanism for our key as well

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:36.529
So our key has space to fit on top

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:40.730
We would need to build walls around it and then like I said I want the key to be hidden

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:44.899
I don't want the key to just be sitting there. I think what I want to do is have a lid that

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:53.359
conceals itself flush with the rest of the pieces and then a secret button that we can push that will lift the lid or

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:57.289
Reveal the lid so we can access our key inside

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:04.429
Push on this piece it will lift the top up out of the way that way we can have the top

00:07:04.949 --> 00:07:08.989
Attached and flush to what's around it with our push of a secret button

00:07:09.449 --> 00:07:12.109
It can lift up and show us the access point

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:16.280
At the moment our button is shorter than our key so we're gonna need to lift that up

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:19.669
Just make the walls taller than that the walls of course need to be at least

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.369
high enough to hide our key inside

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:31.820
You do want the button to slide nicely, let's add in a smooth panel

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:36.530
That can let our button just sort of slide where we want it to go

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:51.679
When we push our button in it does tend to pop out entirely we don't want to lose our button

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.840
We just want to be able to push in and then come back out

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.919
Let's see if we can build sort of a retaining wall something will hold it in on the sides

00:07:58.289 --> 00:08:00.799
Don't really want the outside of our box to have much color

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:03.919
But this is gonna be on the inside so I think we can afford just a little bit

00:08:04.979 --> 00:08:06.979
brighter colors

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:09.560
Some brighter colored pieces

00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:17.450
Nice

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:20.130
I'm liking how that's looking

00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:25.309
Now our our lid like I said, it doesn't really go on very well

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:30.589
We need to add some attachment points where it's something that will just hold it in place where we want it to go

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:32.479
We don't want to get in the way of our key

00:08:32.479 --> 00:08:36.709
So let's try and just go through the corners where it's not gonna be interfering with our key at all

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:40.939
And our lid still isn't quite as wide as the whole wall going around our box

00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:47.510
So let's take one side of our wall in by one brick layer, and then add some corner supports

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:56.210
Let's get a little bit more support in this corner

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:03.830
Now it's sturdy it doesn't fall off and let's try pushing our button here

00:09:04.589 --> 00:09:06.589
Hey that pops right off

00:09:06.779 --> 00:09:11.958
Now our plate is not very well disguised at this point and there's still a little Ridge where you can grab it

00:09:12.209 --> 00:09:17.419
So I want to cover the whole plate and the border using some smooth pieces

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:23.300
And I hope that we'll just sort of disguise it and make it so you can't get your fingers on to it or just take

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:26.180
Another brick push it down onto the plate and peel it up like that

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:44.479
Our secret pop top design is working pretty nicely

00:09:45.149 --> 00:09:49.008
At this point our puzzle box is mostly done, but there's one more thing

00:09:49.009 --> 00:09:51.109
I want to do just to make it a little more secure

00:09:51.389 --> 00:09:56.539
This one peg is very obvious people are gonna know that you need to do something with this pegs

00:09:56.540 --> 00:10:02.629
So let's take all of these other holes going around our whole box and fill those with pegs as well

00:10:03.179 --> 00:10:08.119
This particular peg is three bricks wide and we know that it extends through one layer

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:13.189
Into our interior box to hold it securely in place quite a fill on the rest of them

00:10:13.189 --> 00:10:15.829
We just use these two brick wide pegs

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:21.230
They'll look the same from the outside, but disguise the functionality of the important one

00:10:25.949 --> 00:10:29.329
We now have a secured compartment with three stages to get inside

00:10:29.339 --> 00:10:34.039
We first have to hit the secret button to pop off the lid we can then remove the key from

00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:35.850
inside the top compartment

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:38.809
But as we know our hidden key isn't going to do anything

00:10:39.149 --> 00:10:42.469
Until we know which of these pegs going around is our secret lock

00:10:42.689 --> 00:10:49.189
When you pull that out of the way it disengages and at that point we can turn our key to reveal our hidden compartment

00:10:49.649 --> 00:10:54.049
Everything easily resets gets put back in place and is hidden once again

00:10:54.749 --> 00:10:58.789
For unlimited reuse and remember you don't have to follow this exact design

00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:02.329
This is showing you the kind of things you can do to make a cool little

00:11:02.850 --> 00:11:05.120
multistage puzzle out of some Legos

00:11:05.249 --> 00:11:09.799
