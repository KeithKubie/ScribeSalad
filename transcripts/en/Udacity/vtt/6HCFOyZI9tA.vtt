00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.340
So, what's a bit? And a bit is the smallest

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.160
unit of information. So suppose I tell you that there are

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.550
two boxes. There's a green box and a blue box, and

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:14.530
in one of those two boxes, there's a gold star. And

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:16.570
it's equally likely to be in either the green box or

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.100
the blue box. One bit is the answer to one yes

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.750
or no question. So if you ask one yes or no

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.170
question, you ask, is the gold star in the green box,

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.140
then you get one bit back as the response. You get an

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.820
answer that's either yes or no. And when you learn which one it

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.350
is, that's one bit of information that allows you to go from

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.590
having two choices down to one choice and then you know, well, if

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.710
the answer was yes, the gold star's in the green box, that's

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.230
the one you should open. So when we think about bits in computing,

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.362
we don't usually call them yes or no. We call them 0

00:00:46.362 --> 00:00:51.180
and 1. 0 more readily maps to no, and 1 to yes. So

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.730
I switched blue and green here. But we could

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.240
pick any two things. We could use green and blue.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.010
We could use yes or no. If we have two

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.019
things And we can choose one of them. Knowing which

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.990
one to choose is one bit of information. So that's

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.720
what one bit can do. It allows us to decide

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.160
between two things. For the ancient Greeks network, maybe that's

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.230
all it could transmit. There was either the no bit,

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.260
which said there weren't any enemies arriving. Or if there was a

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.660
smoke signal, that was one bit saying, yes there is an enemy

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.135
arriving. So it's possible if it was only able to transmit that

00:01:26.135 --> 00:01:30.210
1 message, that it only conveyed 1 bit of information. If all we

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.396
can do is send bits, we can send either a 0 or

00:01:32.396 --> 00:01:34.518
a 1, or a yes or a no. But let's think of

00:01:34.518 --> 00:01:37.890
it as 0 and 1s now. Can we send anything more interesting?

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.240
Can we just send one thing? And it turns out that we can

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.340
actually send everything that we want, just

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.290
using bits. So instead of just picking between

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.780
two boxes, now let's suppose there are four

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.530
boxes. So let's say, there's, a purple box,

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:00.910
and there's a dark red box. So now there're four boxes. There's still only one

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:06.400
gold star. So can we figure out which box the gold star is in with just yes,

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.030
no questions? Well one way to do that would be to ask

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.770
four questions, right? We could say is it in the green box?

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.520
We could ask is it in the purple box? We could ask

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.370
is it in the blue box and as long as we know there is

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.950
at least one gold star. We don't really need to ask if

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.420
it's in the dark red box, because if we got no for all

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.760
three of these well then we know the answer to that next question,

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.560
if we asked if it was in the red box, would be yes.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.040
So here we needed up to three questions, to figure out which box the gold star

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:42.690
was in. Can we do better? So the question is, how many bits do we need to

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.700
find the gold star? And remember each bit

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.190
is the answer to one, yes or no question.

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.210
And we have four possible boxes and the

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:51.940
gold star could be any anyone of those four.
