1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,870
Do you think there's ever going
to be a time in, in humans,

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:08,110
like whether it's a hundred years from
now or a thousand years now where there's

3
00:00:08,111 --> 00:00:10,100
no war?
Yes,

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,740
yes I do. How do you see
that happening? Well,

5
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:21,460
it's going to start with the cop cars
with flags on them and then they're going

6
00:00:22,311 --> 00:00:23,450
to patrol her hat.

7
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:27,440
I think it would be technology and I
think it's a matter of everybody becoming

8
00:00:27,441 --> 00:00:30,950
more comfortable if you can,
if you can have people,

9
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,100
this is like a Thomas
Friedman idea that if,

10
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:37,790
if you want to stop like people
fighting in the Middle East, uh,

11
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:40,430
give them all the comforts
of a good society,

12
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,480
let them be able to go eat McDonald's
and sit in a coffee shop and all of a

13
00:00:44,481 --> 00:00:47,360
sudden you don't want to fight as much.
And that means prosperity.

14
00:00:47,361 --> 00:00:49,670
That means popping.
So I think technology,

15
00:00:49,671 --> 00:00:51,980
if you can bring more water to
people and there's less suffering,

16
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:54,770
if climate change doesn't
Jim ruin all of that?

17
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,580
I think if you can prop these
people up and give all these people,

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,580
if they can rise, then
there's no sense. I mean,

19
00:01:01,581 --> 00:01:05,810
we're in a point now where there's fewer
wars than ever before on the planet.

20
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:09,580
Sure. So we're headed in that
direction. So I don't see why not. Well,

21
00:01:09,581 --> 00:01:11,800
as a thought exercise,
let's look at it this way.

22
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:17,080
What makes anybody
decide to act as a group?

23
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:22,350
What makes anybody like if, why
would we decide to go? Like if,

24
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:23,380
if right,

25
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:28,360
what negotiations should we be having
with someone in Germany? Like why, why,

26
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:32,200
why are we having a conversation about
anything you live way the fuck over there

27
00:01:32,201 --> 00:01:33,310
on the other side of the ocean.

28
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:39,150
What would make people act as a group
and go over and try to fuck with somebody

29
00:01:39,671 --> 00:01:43,370
else that's in another
place? Well, people can be,

30
00:01:43,371 --> 00:01:48,371
people can definitely be rallied
for any cause most certainly.

31
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:50,680
But do you think this is my thought,

32
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:55,600
that there will come a time where
that kind of rallying doesn't work,

33
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:58,990
that people will stop believing?
I mean,

34
00:01:58,991 --> 00:02:03,991
this is one of those very bizarre ideas
that the systems that we've established

35
00:02:05,171 --> 00:02:09,610
for, for human civilizations, whether
it's countries or cities or, um,

36
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:13,300
continents, right? Whatever
it is. These systems,

37
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,290
once all the boundaries that kept
people from freely traveling,

38
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,310
although once those are dissolved the
country anymore, they keeping this,

39
00:02:21,311 --> 00:02:24,130
keeping it together now is the fact
that it's air travel so they know when

40
00:02:24,131 --> 00:02:26,410
you're coming in and they
get to check your papers. Oh,

41
00:02:26,411 --> 00:02:30,340
you're flying in from overseas. Arguments
to papa was only one way. Motherfucker,

42
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,920
you've gotta land right here,
right in this spot.

43
00:02:32,921 --> 00:02:36,100
And then we take each individual and
we say, can I see your paperwork?

44
00:02:36,101 --> 00:02:38,530
What do you got? Who are you? Where
are you from? Where are you born?

45
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:40,930
Do you have money or you're a drug addict.
You ever been arrested?

46
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:45,280
And then they're allowed. They could still
do that that way. If that didn't exist,

47
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,410
if it was way easier to go to Germany,

48
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:50,140
there was a technology
that would allow you,

49
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:52,930
like a person like you or made the
same way we could drive places.

50
00:02:52,931 --> 00:02:55,030
We could just fly into
somewhere and land anywhere.

51
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,930
You don't have to go to a fucking
specific location like an airport or get

52
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:02,020
through a road that takes you to some,
you know,

53
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,770
some checkpoints station like when
you're trying to drive from Mexico.

54
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,860
Just if people could fly. Yeah. If people,

55
00:03:08,861 --> 00:03:13,060
if people flew anywhere they wanted to go,
if that technology existed,

56
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:18,700
good fucking luck keeping people from
coming into your city. Good luck.

57
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:20,050
All those rules are out the window.

58
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:24,400
All those immigration rules that
doesn't exist anymore. Can't exist.

59
00:03:24,401 --> 00:03:25,970
People can go anywhere.
They want to write it,

60
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,150
but what are you saying that gives you,
well,

61
00:03:28,151 --> 00:03:32,820
the gives you the interaction with
human beings like and that in a way you,

62
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:36,610
you won't be able to get them as a group
as easily to go after another group.

63
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,590
Right. Because now there's no country
basically. There's no like thing to,

64
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:43,700
we're not part of this that has to
go fight that. Right. We're all in.

65
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:47,470
We're all one now here's the do have one
person lives in a great spot and didn't

66
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,920
want to give up their oil. Right. Right.
Then it becomes a problem. Right. Come on.

67
00:03:50,921 --> 00:03:54,400
Resources. We're all in this
together. Those people in Alaska,

68
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:58,170
you know they got all that
fucking oil, bro, here's happened.

69
00:03:58,330 --> 00:03:59,740
Here's two things though.

70
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:04,600
Here's two things of why it might not
work once technology thousand things,

71
00:04:04,601 --> 00:04:07,690
but yeah, but I only two
that I can think of. Okay,

72
00:04:07,691 --> 00:04:09,880
let me hear a one.

73
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,940
Italians are Italians and Germans are
Germans and Mexicans are Mexicans and you

74
00:04:15,941 --> 00:04:19,420
get around your people and you feel it
and you know it and I know who you are

75
00:04:19,421 --> 00:04:23,440
and we're part of that tribe and we're
part of that thing and it doesn't matter

76
00:04:23,441 --> 00:04:24,550
that we grew up somewhere.

77
00:04:24,551 --> 00:04:28,630
I just know you as an Italian and I'm
an Italian and I am with you and that is

78
00:04:28,631 --> 00:04:32,290
very different from that Turkish
guy over there. That thing,

79
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:36,820
that very human thing.
Chemistry thing of your own blood,

80
00:04:36,821 --> 00:04:40,240
your own thing. I don't think
that's going to go away for Bro.

81
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:44,350
You're old school and you bake bread.
I didn't. You're talking nonsense.

82
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:49,000
You're really into old things. You know
what I mean? I do love all the time.

83
00:04:49,001 --> 00:04:51,700
You fix your eyes without glasses,
you'd be like, Nah, I like the class.

84
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:55,720
Make you feel like, I think I put
them on and get ready to go to work,

85
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:01,760
but I think that's a real thing. I think,
of course, than cars and your friend did,

86
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:03,250
your friend, you give him, hey,

87
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:06,400
it's not that bad and the shit is
actually really good for fertilizer.
