00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.980
So in summary, I presented how a camera operates.

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.220
Brought together the concepts of aperture opening,

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:11.700
shutter speed, and film sensitivity, for optimized photographic exposure.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.530
And we discussed the impact of exposure triangle and

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:16.850
it combines various aspects of photography.

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.960
Now, this part of the lecture was much more driven by the basic concept

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.140
of photography.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.060
Do remember, we are interested in being able to kind of generate images and

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.510
also understand the computational aspect of how we can control various sets of

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.270
parameters which would then allow us to do computational photography.
