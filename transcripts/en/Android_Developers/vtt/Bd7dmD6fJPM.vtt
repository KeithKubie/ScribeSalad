&gt;&gt; ERIC: Hi, I’m Eric. As you can tell,
I’m an avid cyclist but I’m also the lead

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:13.880
product manager for Google products on the
world’s first Android phone, the T-Mobile

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:19.470
G1. I’m here to tell you about the Google
goodies that come pre-loaded on this phone.

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:29.150
There's search, maps, YouTube, Gmail, contacts,
calendar, and talk. With an Android phone,

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:34.950
everything is made simple. Once you log in
with a single sign in, all your Google apps

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.200
are available and automatically synchronized
with the web. You’ll never have to log in

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.380
again. You can still protect all your stuff
by creating a screen lock pattern like these

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:51.800
one. Let’s say you just met a new friend
and you want to add her as a contact. Let

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:57.330
me add Kate, a cyclist I met on my ride last
weekend. I can add Kate’s phone number,

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:05.720
email, address, and more. All Google apps
on Android are fully synchronized so whatever

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.650
you do on your phone appears on your computer
and vice versa. So when I save Kate’s info

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:18.540
on the phone, in a matter of seconds, it will
appear on the web. This also means that all

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:26.240
of Kate’s info is safe and always available.
So even if you lose or break your phone, there’s

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:32.820
no need to panic because you’re always synched
to your Google account. So after I log in

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:40.190
and unlock my new Android phone, all my information
is safe and immediately available. See? Kate’s

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:47.950
info is still there. This is true for more
than just your contacts, your calendar events,

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:55.119
emails, IM chats are all synched between the
phone and the web. If I create an event on

00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:01.479
my computer like my bike ride with Kate this
afternoon, shortly after, it will appear on

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:07.920
my phone. There. I just got a notification
on my status bar. The status bar is where

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:15.660
I get notified of new emails, new IM messages,
calendar events, text messages, and so on.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:22.120
In a single swipe, you get an update on everything
without the need to check each and every one

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:28.890
individually. Oh, here. Kate’s just confirmed
our bike ride plans. To answer Kate, I’ve

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:35.209
got many options and you can find them all
on the contacts app. I can text; IM, email

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:44.980
and, of course, call. I’ll reply with Google
Talk. One last cool thing about Google apps

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.680
on Android, with just a couple of clicks,
you can get a map of your contact's address.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.250
Now, Kate said we should meet near the second
cement anchor on the Golden Gate Bridge. I’m

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:01.810
not exactly sure what that is so I’ll use
Street View to find the exact location. Ah,

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:11.360
that’s where it is. Time to hit the road.
