1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:04,510
Make your luck. Yeah, you gotta
make your luck. And if you make it,

2
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:05,403
if you keep,

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:10,300
if you keep putting forth the maximal
effort that luck's gonna come,

4
00:00:10,301 --> 00:00:12,730
you're gonna make your
luck happen. You know that,

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,030
you know that actually
when we, when we came,

6
00:00:16,031 --> 00:00:21,010
when tasking a bruiser came home from
Iraq, there was, there was, you know,

7
00:00:21,011 --> 00:00:21,610
people were like,

8
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:25,510
oh you guys got super lucky on that
deployment because we got a lot of action.

9
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:26,373
Right.

10
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:30,400
And there was two like immediate thoughts
behind that was number one like, hey,

11
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,120
you know, first of all we lost our bros.

12
00:00:34,121 --> 00:00:39,121
Like there nothing lucky about that was
the first immediate thought in my head

13
00:00:39,251 --> 00:00:40,270
was like, hey man,

14
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:44,080
like cause cause the bottom line is
seals want to go into combat bad.

15
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:48,250
And that's just a broad statement.
And so when we came home,

16
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:53,310
had been in a lot of combat and killed a
lot of bad guys and people were kind of

17
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:59,200
saying, Hey, you guys got
lucky. And, and again,

18
00:00:59,201 --> 00:01:03,130
the first thought was, hey man, you
did. If this is luck, I don't want it.

19
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:08,800
The second thought was just like the
same thing. Like, oh, we got lucky.

20
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,020
We didn't like crush ourselves into
workup and try and be the most, you know,

21
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,770
prepared we could be and then get overseas
and form relationships with all the

22
00:01:17,771 --> 00:01:22,240
conventional forces and do good work
for them and continue to w you know,

23
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:25,300
just get, go as hard as we
could the whole time. No,

24
00:01:25,301 --> 00:01:26,260
that didn't have anything to do with.

25
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,500
It was just luck and it kind of fell
into our lap. But you know, of course,

26
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:34,220
just nod your head and say thanks man.
Appreciate it. Yeah, good times. Uh,

27
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,390
so luck is definitely a part of it.

28
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,720
A little part because where
was I lucky to be in Ramadi?

29
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,930
Cause I could have deployed a year later
and a year later Ramadi was pacified.

30
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:47,200
So is there a lock there?
There absolutely is. So,

31
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:51,370
I don't want to sound
arrogant, but luck is a part,

32
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:56,710
it's like foot locks. It's like heel
hooks. They're a part of the game.

33
00:01:56,770 --> 00:02:00,070
They're not a game changer.
They're a part of the game.

34
00:02:00,071 --> 00:02:03,250
They're not a game changer. We, we
had a group come in, and this is

35
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:06,730
back in the day, a group came in,

36
00:02:06,731 --> 00:02:11,731
a guys that we're known for foot
locking and heel hook and what they did,

37
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:14,740
they thought we were Jujitsu
guys, normal [inaudible] guys,

38
00:02:14,741 --> 00:02:16,870
but we weren't because
we were dean, right?

39
00:02:16,871 --> 00:02:21,871
So we were foot locker and heel hugging
all the time and these guys came in and

40
00:02:22,481 --> 00:02:24,250
immediately they were going for,

41
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:26,350
these are the kind of guys that
would go and I don't know if you,

42
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,900
I don't know if you remembered
this time period in Jujitsu,

43
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:33,190
it was like immediate. They're going for
a full lock, like just diving for it.

44
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,100
But they didn't know that we did
for the longest all the time.

45
00:02:36,101 --> 00:02:40,720
And you weren't going to just grab a
full lock on Dean lister or me like that.

46
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:43,980
There's wasn't going to happen.
And it kind of Inventables also,

47
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:47,050
they didn't have the rest of Jujitsu.
You have the rest of the game.

48
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,140
So then it was not good for them because
they only had this one dimensional

49
00:02:50,141 --> 00:02:52,900
game. And that's what taught me
that foot locks aren't important,

50
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:57,700
but they're not more important
than a choke or a guard pass.

51
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:00,310
They are definitely part of
game. You can't leave out,

52
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:03,700
but they're not a game
changer. And you see that now,

53
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:09,300
now that you see everyone broadly
getting good at at the whole leg,

54
00:03:09,701 --> 00:03:11,650
locking foot, locking heel looking game.

55
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:15,460
Now you see it coming back around where
you have to have the rest of Jujitsu as

56
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:19,270
well. Even though even as much as
like a year ago, it was like, oh,

57
00:03:19,271 --> 00:03:21,850
this guy got this crazy heel hook and
the guy tapped and you didn't know what

58
00:03:21,851 --> 00:03:25,000
was happening. That very
rapidly changes into, okay,

59
00:03:25,001 --> 00:03:27,160
the guy went for a heel hook, the
other guy got out. Now we've got to,

60
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:31,930
where are we back to? We're back
to the Jujitsu, so same thing.

61
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,360
Luck is a factor. It's
not the factor. Yeah.
