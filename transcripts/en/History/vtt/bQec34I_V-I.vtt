00:00:01.543 --> 00:00:05.755
300 miles from the ancient
site of Gobekli Tepe.

00:00:05.755 --> 00:00:11.219
December 28th, 2014.

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.806
A local crew excavating for
an urban renovation project

00:00:14.806 --> 00:00:19.144
stumbles across a strange series
of carved rooms and tunnels

00:00:19.144 --> 00:00:21.896
deep underground.

00:00:21.896 --> 00:00:26.443
Upon further exploration, they
find the subterranean network

00:00:26.443 --> 00:00:30.155
spans several miles and
extends hundreds of feet

00:00:30.155 --> 00:00:34.075
below the surface of the earth,
much like the nearby caves

00:00:34.075 --> 00:00:36.244
of Derinkuyu.

00:00:36.244 --> 00:00:38.079
ANDREW COLLINS:
What they discovered

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:41.791
was that these caves
extended for a distance

00:00:41.791 --> 00:00:46.504
of 370 feet down into the rock.

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:53.720
NARRATOR: Archaeologists
estimate that more than 5

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.388
million square feet of rock--

00:00:55.388 --> 00:00:59.601
the volume of over 370
Olympic-sized swimming pools--

00:00:59.601 --> 00:01:03.646
was removed to carve out
this subterranean city,

00:01:03.646 --> 00:01:09.819
yet there is no evidence of the
extracted material in the area.

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:13.948
This mysterious cave system
is still under excavation

00:01:13.948 --> 00:01:16.201
and closed to the public.

00:01:16.201 --> 00:01:21.372
But in June 2017, author and
researcher Andrew Collins

00:01:21.372 --> 00:01:25.210
was granted access to the site.

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.837
The sheer size of
some of these rooms

00:01:27.837 --> 00:01:29.422
is absolutely amazing.

00:01:29.422 --> 00:01:34.093
I mean, this one that we're
in now is 120 feet in length.

00:01:34.093 --> 00:01:37.806
And yet, it's just one of
hundreds of similar rooms

00:01:37.806 --> 00:01:42.101
that we find inside
this great hill.

00:01:42.101 --> 00:01:46.064
These tunnels that you
see seem to go on and on.

00:01:46.064 --> 00:01:49.442
And yet, what's incredible
is that not only

00:01:49.442 --> 00:01:51.236
were they full of
people, but there

00:01:51.236 --> 00:01:54.155
was also livestock down here.

00:01:54.155 --> 00:01:58.409
And we're told that as
many as 20,000 people,

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.329
perhaps even as much
as 60,000, could have

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:04.833
lived here at any one time.

00:02:04.833 --> 00:02:07.752
NARRATOR: Not only is there
evidence that these caves once

00:02:07.752 --> 00:02:11.840
housed thousands of people,
but archaeologists have found

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.092
air vents and water
wells that would

00:02:14.092 --> 00:02:16.553
have made it possible
to live underground

00:02:16.553 --> 00:02:19.305
for years at a time.

00:02:19.305 --> 00:02:22.016
These were cut
deeply into the rock,

00:02:22.016 --> 00:02:26.062
sometimes for hundreds
of yards in depth.

00:02:26.062 --> 00:02:29.190
And at the base
of them were wells

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.152
that provided water to these
underground populations.

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:42.620
This is what is known
as a self-sealing door.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.915
And they are, in fact,
huge, great stone wheels,

00:02:45.915 --> 00:02:49.836
made of a volcanic
rock known as basalt.

00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:54.173
Their function was that they
would be wheeled into position

00:02:54.173 --> 00:02:58.595
so that they would lock so
that nobody was able to get

00:02:58.595 --> 00:03:00.555
inside the underground cities.

00:03:05.894 --> 00:03:07.478
NARRATOR: When it
was discovered,

00:03:07.478 --> 00:03:11.357
historians recovered artifacts
that suggest the cave system

00:03:11.357 --> 00:03:15.570
was used by the early Christians
to escape persecution,

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:21.784
so they dated the site to be
approximately 1,500 years old.

00:03:21.784 --> 00:03:27.332
But based on new evidence,
the caves might be much older.

00:03:27.332 --> 00:03:30.960
ANDREW COLLINS: A few years ago,
I interviewed an archaeologist

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.797
by the name of Omer
Demir, and he found

00:03:34.797 --> 00:03:37.258
within it paleolithic tools.

00:03:37.258 --> 00:03:39.761
Tools that went
back at least 10,000

00:03:39.761 --> 00:03:44.223
to 12,000 years, and
arguably even earlier still.
