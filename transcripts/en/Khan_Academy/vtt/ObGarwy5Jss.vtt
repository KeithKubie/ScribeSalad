00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160
- [Instructor] Anatomically
modern human beings

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:07.040
have been on this planet
for roughly 200,000 years.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.200
And even though that's a small fraction

00:00:09.202 --> 00:00:11.344
of the amount of time the
Earth has been around,

00:00:11.344 --> 00:00:13.545
which is over 4 billion years,

00:00:13.545 --> 00:00:16.843
on a human scale it's an
incredibly long amount of time.

00:00:16.843 --> 00:00:20.383
Just to put it in perspective,
if this is present time,

00:00:20.383 --> 00:00:23.183
if you wanted to put,
when was the Roman Empire?

00:00:23.183 --> 00:00:25.542
Well, if we're talking
about 2000 years ago,

00:00:25.542 --> 00:00:29.960
it would show up on our
timeline right about there.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.080
If you wanted to talk about

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.098
when the pyramids were constructed,

00:00:33.098 --> 00:00:35.133
it would be right about there.

00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:37.092
You could hardly see the time difference

00:00:37.092 --> 00:00:40.973
between now and several
thousand years ago.

00:00:40.973 --> 00:00:43.280
If you want to see how
long we've had writing,

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.591
about 5000 years is our
current best estimate.

00:00:46.591 --> 00:00:49.146
Once again, it barely
shows up on this timeline.

00:00:49.146 --> 00:00:50.922
How long have we had agriculture?

00:00:50.922 --> 00:00:52.442
Well, 10 to 15 thousand years.

00:00:52.442 --> 00:00:55.191
Once again, it's a small fraction of this.

00:00:55.191 --> 00:00:56.650
Another way to think about it,

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:58.974
think about all of our ancestors,

00:00:58.974 --> 00:01:01.315
the various generations that have passed

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.480
since the first appearance

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.280
of anatomically modern human beings.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.580
This is over 6 or 7 thousand
generations into the past.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.480
Think about all of the stories
that must have happened.

00:01:18.483 --> 00:01:19.885
A lot of simple things.

00:01:19.885 --> 00:01:22.885
It might be a founding of a village,

00:01:23.856 --> 00:01:28.460
a killing of an animal,
a very simple courtship,

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.215
a tenderness between a
mother and their child.

00:01:31.215 --> 00:01:32.705
And think about the big things,

00:01:32.705 --> 00:01:36.115
the wars, the battles,
the natural disasters.

00:01:36.115 --> 00:01:38.301
It's hard for us to imagine
how much has occurred

00:01:38.301 --> 00:01:41.387
even in the last hundred or
two hundred or thousand years,

00:01:41.387 --> 00:01:44.160
much less 200,000 years.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.400
But we seek to understand regardless.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.360
And that is what history is all about.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.192
And as we'll see, history is in general

00:01:54.192 --> 00:01:56.990
trying to understand
the stories of our past.

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.850
And if we want to get a
little bit more technical,

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.177
we can also think about
prehistory, which is, technically,

00:02:03.177 --> 00:02:06.678
the things that happened
before we had writing.

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.020
Because writing is our
main tool for history.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.773
What I have right over here, this picture,

00:02:13.773 --> 00:02:15.999
this is Egyptian hieroglyphs.

00:02:15.999 --> 00:02:20.236
And Egyptian hieroglyphs
are over 5000 years old.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.460
I could write 5000
years before the present.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.540
But even when you have
writing, it's not enough

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.160
as we'll see not only in this video,

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.160
but in many videos as we study
history and world history.

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.937
It's really a lot of science
and a lot of detective work

00:02:34.937 --> 00:02:36.898
to make sense of what has happened.

00:02:36.898 --> 00:02:39.647
And that understanding
will constantly evolve.

00:02:39.647 --> 00:02:42.700
For example, we didn't know
what these hieroglyphs said

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.020
until 1799 when we
found the Rosetta Stone.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.000
And what was useful
about the Rosetta Stone

00:02:51.002 --> 00:02:55.584
is that they had some text
written in the hieroglyphs

00:02:55.584 --> 00:02:58.237
and they had the same text
then written in a Greek

00:02:58.237 --> 00:02:59.978
that we were able to understand

00:02:59.978 --> 00:03:03.900
and that started to help unlock
what these hieroglyphs said.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.755
But even once you have
a sense of what they say

00:03:06.755 --> 00:03:08.528
or even if you understand it quite well,

00:03:08.528 --> 00:03:10.683
you still have to do a
lot of detective work

00:03:10.683 --> 00:03:13.482
and take everything with a grain of salt.

00:03:13.482 --> 00:03:14.732
You can imagine

00:03:16.815 --> 00:03:19.766
if there's a bunch of
groups of people here

00:03:19.766 --> 00:03:23.661
and we get the history from this group,

00:03:23.661 --> 00:03:26.578
for some reason we were able
to find what they wrote,

00:03:26.578 --> 00:03:28.848
well it might not be completely unbiased.

00:03:28.848 --> 00:03:32.672
They might have a negative view
of this group or that group.

00:03:32.672 --> 00:03:34.553
And so you have to take it
all with a grain of salt.

00:03:34.553 --> 00:03:37.393
At the extreme form, they
might have eliminated

00:03:37.393 --> 00:03:40.509
some of these groups and
then only they were around

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:42.982
to say what actually happened.

00:03:42.982 --> 00:03:45.195
You also have to be skeptical
because you don't know

00:03:45.195 --> 00:03:47.372
whether these stories are actual accounts

00:03:47.372 --> 00:03:50.813
or whether someone just made
it up to fit a worldview.

00:03:50.813 --> 00:03:52.623
You also have to keep in
mind that these stories,

00:03:52.623 --> 00:03:55.867
whether they were transmitted
written or orally,

00:03:55.867 --> 00:03:57.852
they're oftentimes retransmitted

00:03:57.852 --> 00:04:01.489
from generation to generation,
and especially in the oral case.

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:03.503
But even in the written,
you've gotta wonder

00:04:03.503 --> 00:04:06.330
what's added over each generation.

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:07.759
You can imagine people embellishing,

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:09.384
making the story a little bit better.

00:04:09.384 --> 00:04:11.798
Or taking out things of the story

00:04:11.798 --> 00:04:16.138
that really doesn't fit
in with their worldview.

00:04:16.138 --> 00:04:18.801
So even when we have the writing,

00:04:18.801 --> 00:04:21.878
and this is once again, some
images of early writing.

00:04:21.878 --> 00:04:26.625
This is the famous Sumerian
cuneiform tablet here.

00:04:26.625 --> 00:04:27.727
Even when we have it, obviously,

00:04:27.727 --> 00:04:29.343
we have much much more writing

00:04:29.343 --> 00:04:31.409
as we get to the more recent past,

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:33.665
we have to be very very very skeptical.

00:04:33.665 --> 00:04:34.641
We know, today,

00:04:34.641 --> 00:04:37.974
even if two observers
observed something yesterday,

00:04:37.974 --> 00:04:40.088
something that just
happened, they might have

00:04:40.088 --> 00:04:42.439
very very different
perceptions of what happened.

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:45.158
So even though there's writing,
we have to be skeptical.

00:04:45.158 --> 00:04:48.098
But things get, in some
ways, even more interesting

00:04:48.098 --> 00:04:52.612
before we have writing,
when we go into prehistory.

00:04:52.612 --> 00:04:55.710
You might wonder how do we know
anything about what happened

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.207
if there's no written accounts?

00:04:58.207 --> 00:04:59.649
Well that's where the science

00:04:59.649 --> 00:05:01.560
and we get even more detective work.

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.630
For example, this is a Neanderthal skull.

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.700
And the type of people, the
sciences that will study this,

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.020
you'll hear terms like anthropologists.

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.280
Anthropologists or anthropology.

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.800
This is the study of
present and past humans

00:05:19.811 --> 00:05:21.182
and human society.

00:05:21.182 --> 00:05:23.297
And then a subset of anthropology,

00:05:23.297 --> 00:05:26.808
which is really delving into prehistory

00:05:26.808 --> 00:05:30.141
and even history itself, is archaeology.

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:35.920
Archaeology which is the
subset of anthropology

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:40.251
that focuses on the past study
of humans and human society

00:05:40.251 --> 00:05:42.835
and they're mainly going
to do it through remains.

00:05:42.835 --> 00:05:45.781
Now there's other fields,
you might associate,

00:05:45.781 --> 00:05:48.114
the field of paleontologist.

00:05:50.982 --> 00:05:52.232
Paleontologist.

00:05:59.357 --> 00:06:00.440
Paleontology.

00:06:01.548 --> 00:06:05.751
You might associate this with
things like dinosaur bones,

00:06:05.751 --> 00:06:09.918
but their techniques are also
useful for old human remains

00:06:10.952 --> 00:06:12.946
or even pre-human remains.

00:06:12.946 --> 00:06:16.670
And so it might inform
archaeology and anthropology.

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:18.364
So for example, an archaeologist

00:06:18.364 --> 00:06:20.626
might unearth this Neanderthal skull.

00:06:20.626 --> 00:06:23.051
They will use some science
in order to figure out:

00:06:23.051 --> 00:06:26.590
When did this skull enter into the ground?

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:30.486
They might use a technique
like radiocarbon dating.

00:06:30.486 --> 00:06:33.980
Radiocarbon dating,

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.214
which could be used for things

00:06:36.214 --> 00:06:39.376
up to around 50,000 years old,

00:06:39.376 --> 00:06:43.197
so around that time span on our timeline.

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.180
And it's based on this idea

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:47.380
that you have this atmospheric carbon-14

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:51.820
that actually comes from nitrogen-14

00:06:51.824 --> 00:06:55.662
that gets between interactions
with the solar wind

00:06:55.662 --> 00:06:56.942
and these cosmic particles

00:06:56.942 --> 00:06:59.610
becomes this radioactive carbon-14.

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:02.440
And the carbon-14 which can
become part of carbon dioxide

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.600
incorporate into plants
through photosynthesis

00:07:04.609 --> 00:07:06.342
which then get eaten into animals.

00:07:06.342 --> 00:07:07.983
So while something is living,

00:07:07.983 --> 00:07:12.089
they'll have a certain amount
of carbon-14 in their tissue.

00:07:12.089 --> 00:07:13.576
But then once they die,

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:16.320
they're now no longer
adding more carbon-14.

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:21.080
And the carbon-14 decays into
the more stable carbon-12.

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:22.598
And so based on the ratio

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:25.180
between the carbon-14 to the carbon-12,

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:31.060
and it takes roughly 5,000
years, 5,730 years to be exact,

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:34.240
for roughly half of the carbon-14 to decay into carbon-12.

00:07:34.241 --> 00:07:35.595
So based on this ratio,

00:07:35.595 --> 00:07:37.713
and I go into much more
detail in other videos,

00:07:37.713 --> 00:07:40.327
you can figure out how
old these things are

00:07:40.327 --> 00:07:42.054
and you get reasonably precise,

00:07:42.054 --> 00:07:45.611
within a couple of a
hundred, hundreds of years.

00:07:45.611 --> 00:07:48.085
If you want to go further into the past,

00:07:48.085 --> 00:07:52.720
there's things like
potassium-argon dating,

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:57.112
which is once again taking a
radioactive form of potassium

00:07:57.112 --> 00:08:00.862
and using the idea that
it decays into argon.

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:06.680
And that when a volcano
releases the argon in that rock,

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:10.080
is able to go into the atmosphere,
but then once it hardens,

00:08:10.081 --> 00:08:11.816
you have the decay and so you can see

00:08:11.816 --> 00:08:15.904
how long since that volcanic
eruption are we looking at.

00:08:15.904 --> 00:08:17.265
And so for example, you can dig,

00:08:17.265 --> 00:08:20.860
you can do stratographic
techniques right over here.

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:25.278
Stratigraphy, I have
trouble saying these words.

00:08:25.278 --> 00:08:28.122
That's looking at the
various layers of the earth.

00:08:28.122 --> 00:08:29.868
And you might use some dating techniques,

00:08:29.868 --> 00:08:31.717
for example potassium-argon.

00:08:31.717 --> 00:08:33.985
Say: "Okay, this is that,
a certain amount of age,

00:08:33.985 --> 00:08:36.141
"that is a certain amount of age,

00:08:36.141 --> 00:08:39.938
"this was volcanic rock
from a volcanic eruption."

00:08:39.938 --> 00:08:41.554
And then you can look at the fossils.

00:08:41.554 --> 00:08:43.202
You can say: "Okay, a
fossil that I found here"

00:08:43.202 --> 00:08:45.605
"is going to be newer than the stuff here"

00:08:45.605 --> 00:08:47.279
"and it's gonna be older
than the stuff here"

00:08:47.279 --> 00:08:49.665
"and this might be the newest of all."

00:08:49.665 --> 00:08:50.993
So you can look at relative dating

00:08:50.993 --> 00:08:52.751
and if you're lucky enough
to have some volcanic rock,

00:08:52.751 --> 00:08:55.790
you could do some of this
potassium-argon dating

00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:58.744
and there's many many
many other techniques.

00:08:58.744 --> 00:09:01.330
And it isn't just about
saying: "Oh, this skull

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:04.418
"was in this place in
the world at this time."

00:09:04.418 --> 00:09:06.388
You can start to infer other things.

00:09:06.388 --> 00:09:08.900
You can look for fossils
of the type of animals,

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:11.379
the type of plants near
these burial sites.

00:09:11.379 --> 00:09:13.441
You could see how dense
these burial sites were,

00:09:13.441 --> 00:09:15.049
what type of cultures were there.

00:09:15.049 --> 00:09:16.779
You could start to make inferences.

00:09:16.779 --> 00:09:19.695
You can try to infer
how these people died.

00:09:19.695 --> 00:09:22.033
You might have some trauma fractures here

00:09:22.033 --> 00:09:23.689
and you might say: "Okay,
that was a violent death."

00:09:23.689 --> 00:09:25.612
You might look at their
teeth to think about the type

00:09:25.612 --> 00:09:28.869
of things they might have
eaten or their general health.

00:09:28.869 --> 00:09:32.107
You might look at the tools
that are buried near them.

00:09:32.107 --> 00:09:36.095
This right over here, these
are Paleolithic arrow,

00:09:36.095 --> 00:09:38.663
I guess, spearheads or
tools right over here.

00:09:38.663 --> 00:09:41.688
Paleolithic is defined by
more of these harder edges.

00:09:41.688 --> 00:09:43.270
You have Neolithic tools

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:45.239
which have more of these smoother edges.

00:09:45.239 --> 00:09:48.561
Then Old Stone Age, New
Stone Age right over here.

00:09:48.561 --> 00:09:50.153
And by looking at all of that,

00:09:50.153 --> 00:09:52.822
you have all of these
scientists, you have these

00:09:52.822 --> 00:09:55.164
anthropologists,
archaeologists, paleontologists,

00:09:55.164 --> 00:09:58.417
who are starting to piece
together prehistory.

00:09:58.417 --> 00:10:00.217
And sometimes these
techniques are done together.

00:10:00.217 --> 00:10:02.882
Sometimes we have writing
and we have these technique

00:10:02.882 --> 00:10:05.843
to try to get a more complete picture.

00:10:05.843 --> 00:10:09.332
Now I want to end with
just a note of caution.

00:10:09.332 --> 00:10:11.529
Even though we have all
of these techniques,

00:10:11.529 --> 00:10:14.743
we're learning more
everyday, our understanding

00:10:14.743 --> 00:10:18.687
of all that has happened
is very very incomplete.

00:10:18.687 --> 00:10:21.332
And even more, it
constantly gets challenged

00:10:21.332 --> 00:10:22.509
the more we learn.

00:10:22.509 --> 00:10:25.022
There are things that very
serious people believed

00:10:25.022 --> 00:10:28.872
50 or 100 years ago that we
have now proven to be false.

00:10:28.872 --> 00:10:31.102
And things that we now
take very seriously,

00:10:31.102 --> 00:10:32.879
it's likely that in 50 or 100 years

00:10:32.879 --> 00:10:35.239
people might prove some of that wrong.

00:10:35.239 --> 00:10:37.330
So history, even though
it's about the past,

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:39.035
it is constantly evolving.

00:10:39.035 --> 00:10:40.555
We're constantly learning more

00:10:40.555 --> 00:10:43.346
and we should have a very solid humility

00:10:43.346 --> 00:10:46.120
about what we know and what we don't know.
