00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
This question is about the double inclined plane.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
What we have here is a pretty intimidating setup.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
We have what we could view as 2 inclined planes--

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
one inclined at an angle α and one inclined at an angle β.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
We have two masses--m1 and m2--and of course we're pretending there's no friction,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
because we just don't want to deal with that right now.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I want to know if I set this system up and then release it, how is it going to accelerate.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Just to be consistent, let's call clockwise direction,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
so if this one's moving up then this one's moving down the plane.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
We'll call that positive acceleration-- +a.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.000
For this question I'm going to tell you that the acceleration looks something like this.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Now, what's going on here?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Well, the acceleration is g--the acceleration due to gravity--

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
times this modifier of some sort.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
What I want you to do is in each of the red boxes

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
put either a 1 or a 2 if the relevant mass is mass 1 you put a 1, 2 you put a 2.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
In the blue boxes, I want you to put either a plus, a minus, multiplication sign,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
or division sign, depending on what you think makes sense.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Now, you could just solve this equation.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
You could do F = ma for both of the blocks and get an answer.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Or you could try using your intuition.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
See what makes sense. Think of limiting cases.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
What happens when m1 gets really big or m2 gets really big.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
What happens if β is really small or α is really small?

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Thinking this way should be able, in theory, to tell you exactly

00:01:25.000 --> 99:59:59.000
what symbols go in the blue and red boxes. Good luck.
