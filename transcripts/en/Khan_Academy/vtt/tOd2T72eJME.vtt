00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:05.150
The scale on a map is 7
centimeters for every 10

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.130
kilometers, or 7 centimeters
for 10 kilometers.

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:11.730
If the distance
between two cities

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.110
is 60 kilometers-- so
that's the actual distance--

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.360
how far apart in centimeters
are the two cities on the map?

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.290
Well, they give us the scale.

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:25.300
For every 10 kilometers
in the real world,

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.692
the map is going to
show 7 centimeters.

00:00:29.692 --> 00:00:31.150
Or another way to
think about it is

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.650
if you see 7 centimeters
on the map, that represents

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.640
10 kilometers in the real world.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.312
Now, they're saying that the
distance between two cities

00:00:39.312 --> 00:00:40.020
is 60 kilometers.

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:51.380
So it's essentially 6 times
10 kilometers, so times 6.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.580
So if you have to 6 times
10 kilometers on the map,

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:59.100
you're going to have 6 times
7 centimeters, so times 6.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.710
And 6 times 7 centimeters
gets you to 42 centimeters.

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.560
So how far apart in centimeters
are the two cities on the map?

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.202
Well, 42 centimeters.
