Now that you know the basic layout of RStudio,

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:05.520
you're welcome to customize it, by going to Tools, and then

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.090
Options. From here you can choose the default directory if you'd

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.880
like. You can change formatting options for editing code, or you

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.090
can even change the font and the appearance. Here, I'm using

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.390
the tomorrow theme, but there are of course some others. You

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.080
can also make adjustments to the panes so, feel free to

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.960
play around with this to get a configuration that you like.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.380
Now, you might not have any idea what you like first

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.830
so just wait until you play with R a bit, and

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.740
then you'll find a configuration that suits you. I'm going to

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.180
leave this as is. Alright, we've got R set up, so

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.410
let's start using the programming language. To get started, I want

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.680
you to download the R script from the instructor notes and

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.480
open it here. When you open the file, it should look

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.960
like this. This R script contains both comments as plain text and

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.150
R code. You can run R commands by highlighting a chunk of

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.030
the code and then hitting Cmd and Enter on a Mac, Or Ctrl+Enter

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.440
on a PC. The lines of text that start with a hash or

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.830
a pound symbol are comments. There lines are plain text that we don't

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.150
want to run as R code. It's the standalone text that you really want

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.410
for the R code. Now, your task is to read through this file

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.080
and run and write code when you're prompted to do so. When you

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.660
get to the end of the file, you'll get to a question, and

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.250
you'll need to answer this question to move on to the next video

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.420
in this lesson. Now, if you're already familiar with R, I suggest trying

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.860
to answer the questions, and then you might want to go back to the

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.280
files to see if you missed anything. We know you learn best by

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.290
doing, so it's important that you execute and run this code as you

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.610
go, and that you make sense of the output. Any output will appear

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.070
down here in the console. I also hope that you have moments of

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.670
inspiration. So if something does come to mind I want you to code

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.490
it up and just run it in R. You won't break anything and the

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.410
worse thing that would happen would be an error message or a warning message

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:51.490
in this box. If you do happen to get stuck at any point post

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.790
in the discussions so that way your peers or one of the instructors can help.
