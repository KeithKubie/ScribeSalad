00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:04,050
You are listening to radiolab radiolab

2
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:07,470
from [inaudible], w.

3
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:15,900
N. Y. S. E. N. N. P. R. Hey, I'm
Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich,

4
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:20,730
Radiolab and today we have a story that
actually kind of seems to stick with

5
00:00:20,731 --> 00:00:23,460
those who hear it. Can you hear us
now? Hello? Hello. Hello. Hello.

6
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:25,190
Like this Guy Walter Merge.

7
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,850
I'm a film editor and sound designer
and I've been working in film since the

8
00:00:29,851 --> 00:00:33,890
late 1960s the resume includes, I'm
going to make them and off we go.

9
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,610
The Godfather apocalypse now.

10
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,370
I love the smell of that pump in
the morning. Ton of other films,

11
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,770
the thing we're talking about it,

12
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:47,340
so you should know is the one of the
more spectacular stories I've ever heard.

13
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,540
How did you bump into this tail?

14
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:54,080
Well, I was in Leon in
France doing a film,

15
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,970
unbearable lightness of being.

16
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:00,230
This is back in 1986 I was supposed to
be there for a week on it. Wound up,

17
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,400
I was there for a month and
I ran out of things to read.

18
00:01:04,401 --> 00:01:09,401
So I went down the street from the
hotel and there was a bookstore and a,

19
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:13,670
I was interested and
still am in cosmology.

20
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:18,590
So I picked up a book by the,
uh, Carl Sagan of France,

21
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:23,270
a man named Hubert Reeves. [inaudible]
actually, he's French Canadian.

22
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:27,590
He translates this Gulf Sago. Anyway,
merchant ends up buying Reeves book,

23
00:01:27,591 --> 00:01:29,570
goes back to the hotel, finds a cozy spot.

24
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:34,710
I was happily reading away and he was
trying to explain with some difficulty

25
00:01:35,541 --> 00:01:37,430
because it was a difficult topic.

26
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:43,300
How did matter condense out of the sort
of cork soup that we believe happened

27
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:51,530
right after the big bang.
And He tried various,

28
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:56,530
uh, attempts scientifically, but
then he said, to give you a sense of,

29
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:58,820
uh, the poetry of this moment,

30
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,200
the best thing is the story
that Muller Parte tells.

31
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:04,310
[inaudible]

32
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:06,260
who is Mela party? Well,

33
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:07,440
[inaudible]

34
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:12,150
he was a journalist, a
poet, a diplomat soldier,

35
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,540
prisoner film director
and somebody who, uh,

36
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:20,880
got around. Yeah. And speaking
of getting around in 1942,

37
00:02:20,881 --> 00:02:23,910
a Melanie's newspaper
[inaudible] the loss,

38
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,120
Sarah sent Malaparte Day to report, um,

39
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,910
on the eastern and
northern fronts of the war.

40
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:35,060
Specifically the Russian Finnish border
and he had a front row seat of the siege

41
00:02:35,251 --> 00:02:36,084
of Leningrad,

42
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,650
the agony of the Nazi bombardment
of that city and it's from there.

43
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:42,630
Then Malaparte he tells his story.

44
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:47,710
So this one day, this
was an in the winter,

45
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,040
Mala party was posted with the Finnish
army who were fighting along with the

46
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:56,041
Nazis and they were perched just north
of linen ground on the shores of Lake

47
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:01,390
Ladoga, which is this big lake
abutting the city and on this day

48
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:05,850
[inaudible],

49
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:08,790
the Nazis are bombarded
area around the lake.

50
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:14,460
This started a forest fire,
everyone ran for cover,

51
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,230
soldiers ran every which way.

52
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:20,460
In the middle of the forest there were
Soviet forces that were locked up in a

53
00:03:20,461 --> 00:03:21,840
stable and

54
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:28,790
fortunately panicked and broke out of
the stable hundreds of them and they just

55
00:03:28,831 --> 00:03:31,800
started running in Russian to get
away from the fighting. Right.

56
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:35,620
So you have hundreds of horses bolting
through this flaming forest heading

57
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,470
towards the open space I head,

58
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:40,800
which was the lake and all the ones
they burst out in the forest and go

59
00:03:40,801 --> 00:03:42,270
barreling into the lake.

60
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:47,730
Stampeding one on top of the other is
y'all get deeper and deeper up to their

61
00:03:47,731 --> 00:03:48,360
heads.

62
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,330
And it is this moment when they enter
the length that according to this story,

63
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:54,640
something very weird happens in
the blink of an eye, but like

64
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:00,330
snaps them shot, it just freezes,

65
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,790
suddenly turns to ice with a bang.

66
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:07,780
It goes from water to ice
with this violence snap and
suddenly the horses are in

67
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:08,963
two

68
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,470
mellow parte writes that even the waves
on the lake were gripped in midair and

69
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:15,210
sort of suspended there.

70
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:19,863
[inaudible]

71
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:26,490
the next morning when Mullah
party in the fins woke up,

72
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:30,210
they discovered the forest fire had
burned itself out. And look at that,

73
00:04:30,211 --> 00:04:35,070
the lake has frozen solid overnight
and his finished friends said yes,

74
00:04:35,071 --> 00:04:40,071
that sometimes happens and then they are
looking to see what are those bumps on

75
00:04:40,891 --> 00:04:42,120
the ice over there.

76
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:47,220
They go to investigate and
I find themselves in this
horrific sculpture garden

77
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:52,310
of horses' heads sticking up out of
the solid marble like floor of ice,

78
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:57,540
like you said, hundreds. So hundreds
of course heads on roads, abortions,

79
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:00,730
these are the, these are not going to
decay, right? Cause it's freezing cold.

80
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,310
So they look there,

81
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:06,310
they s those horses stayed there all
winter and Muller Party was there in that

82
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,310
region of the world. Uh,

83
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:15,380
during that winter and every so often
he and the other soldiers would go and

84
00:05:15,931 --> 00:05:20,931
have a smoke and they'd go into the
sculpture garden and wander around looking

85
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:24,300
up this miraculous thing.

86
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:29,180
So the [inaudible] of the
horses frozen in this lake,

87
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:33,130
there's image beautiful and
strange and disturbing and

88
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,510
the profound in some way made us
wonder, made me wonder. I should say,

89
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:40,300
I told you at the time,
it don't trust this story.

90
00:05:40,301 --> 00:05:45,010
It's not scientifically impossible.
And I hold keeping an open heart.

91
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:49,360
You could this possibly be true.
Could, could there be a grain,

92
00:05:49,361 --> 00:05:52,840
perhaps several grains, perhaps
eight lakes worth of grains of truth.

93
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:57,160
Your heart is story. Just your mind
is like loose, like a thick. Anyway,

94
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:58,003
I do

95
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,680
this for a year. Yeah. And
you know what? We're going to,

96
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:03,530
we're going to reconstruct that
argument right now and take this uptown.

97
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:06,230
All right. All right. Let's do this too.

98
00:06:06,231 --> 00:06:09,060
A real scientist [inaudible] this.

99
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,480
In the course of our argument,

100
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:15,800
we ended up going uptown to Rockefeller
University to meet a couple people who

101
00:06:15,801 --> 00:06:16,561
know about ice,

102
00:06:16,561 --> 00:06:21,110
so we're going to go play with
some super cool of ice among them.

103
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:24,200
This fellow. Okay. I'm Alexandra Petroff.

104
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:27,020
I am the Raymond and
Beverly Sackler fellow.

105
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,600
Who did you ever wonder who are
Raymond and Beverly Sackler?

106
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:34,220
They occasionally almost show up and I
almost meet them, but I never have. Yeah.

107
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:38,780
In any case, Alex, who must
be said is an amazing dude,

108
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:43,820
graciously agreed to demonstrate that
you can in fact create the conditions of

109
00:06:43,821 --> 00:06:46,700
that massive lake inside a
tiny little test tube. Okay.

110
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:49,880
Could somebody hold this road in
here and I'll get the tube set up?

111
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:52,280
Reached inside his freezer,
grabbed his trusty Falcon.

112
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:55,700
This is called a falcon tube. Just a
blessing too. Filled with water. No,

113
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,940
this is not normal water. This is
the really nice water. It's very,

114
00:06:58,941 --> 00:07:01,490
very pure water. No minerals, no Dustin.

115
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:04,670
There's like super distilled and he says
when you take water like that and you

116
00:07:04,671 --> 00:07:05,510
cool it down,

117
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:10,810
you can get it far below its freezing
point and it won't freeze unless that is,

118
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:14,820
you happen to have a horse.
You have a tiny horse here.

119
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:18,900
We have a tiny hole and we're going to
drop that into the Falcon Tube and do

120
00:07:18,901 --> 00:07:23,310
that. That's going to be awesome.
So he handed us the tube.

121
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:27,860
I'm holding a little vile of
super cooled water. What else?

122
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:31,050
What temperature do you think this is
that am I gonna make money? This is mine.

123
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:34,660
Minus 20 c c Celsius. Wait,

124
00:07:34,661 --> 00:07:39,090
when does water freezes at zero. So
it's 20 degrees below freezing point.

125
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:42,450
It's still water. But now for a long
cause we unscrewed the cap. Are you,

126
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:43,403
are you filming?

127
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:48,060
We held the little plastic horse over
the tube countdown or something. Okay.

128
00:07:48,061 --> 00:07:52,500
On the count, three guilty.
All right. Three, two, one.

129
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:01,820
[inaudible]

130
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:04,910
for Jad because the moment that
little plastic course hit the water,

131
00:08:04,911 --> 00:08:06,930
the water slammed into ice.

132
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:13,760
Suddenly that little guy was
trapped in an ice cube. Oh my God.

133
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:17,000
It's Thor's is frozen. That's amazing.

134
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,410
Please remember the horse was plastic.

135
00:08:21,411 --> 00:08:24,770
No animals were harmed in this
experiment. Is this honestly breathtaking?

136
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,240
Like it happens so fast. Catastrophic
ice formation just like that.

137
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:32,420
Did you hear the c word? Robert?
Say it again. Catastrophic.

138
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:36,710
This is Virginia Walker and I'm in the
department of Biology Queens University.

139
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:40,550
Virginia was one of the many people that
we called up to ask like what the hell?

140
00:08:40,551 --> 00:08:42,680
Like why does this happen? It shouldn't.

141
00:08:42,681 --> 00:08:46,340
This water just freeze gradually the
way that most water does, you know,

142
00:08:46,341 --> 00:08:50,420
at 32 degrees Fahrenheit or
whatever. No, actually, so you see,

143
00:08:50,421 --> 00:08:54,140
this is why we have to start at the
beginning. As Julie Andrews said,

144
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:57,400
a very good to start. Right? Alright.

145
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:02,570
So the only reason that water freezes
normally at zero Celsius and 32 Fahrenheit

146
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:09,930
is that the something there that makes
it freeze, we call that a nuclear later.

147
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:15,140
Sounds like a superhero. Yeah. All
right, so it's a nuclear later.

148
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:18,740
A nuclear is like a seed, right?

149
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:23,780
Didn't know this but it turns out water
almost always needs a seed in order to

150
00:09:23,781 --> 00:09:28,781
grow ice because it turns out water
by itself is not actually that good at

151
00:09:29,091 --> 00:09:32,240
remembering how to become
ice. That is Erin pedit.

152
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:36,650
She's a glaciologist at the University
of Alaska Fairbanks and what she means is

153
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:40,040
that when water cools down, the
molecules start to slow their movement.

154
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:43,700
They get a little bit closer together and
at that point they want all hold hands

155
00:09:43,701 --> 00:09:44,600
and become ice.

156
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:48,770
The water molecules don't quite remember
very well how they're supposed to be

157
00:09:48,771 --> 00:09:51,920
organized. They're like, wait, do
you stand here a nice day in here?

158
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:52,940
How do we do this? Again,

159
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
they need to be shown what combination
of angles work the best to create a nice

160
00:09:58,971 --> 00:10:03,050
stable structure. What they
need is say a speck of dust.

161
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:07,040
That's the nuclear. If you throw in
some dust into otherwise pure water,

162
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:11,400
now they have a guide because ice
can start to mimic whatever the, the,

163
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:14,750
the shape of the dust particle is who
had happens is that the water molecules

164
00:10:14,751 --> 00:10:17,240
start to form a cage
around the dust particle.

165
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:21,650
And that cage shape is very similar
to the shape they need to make ice.

166
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:25,010
And suddenly they're like,
oh, that's how we do it.

167
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:30,250
So in a sense the dust
particle is reminding the
water molecules how to freeze.

168
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:34,060
Well, no, I don't think of it like that.

169
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:36,970
Virginia says it's actually
a not quite so gentle.

170
00:10:36,971 --> 00:10:41,140
Really what's happening is
the dust particle is forcing
the water molecules into

171
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:44,560
the rate shape around it. It's
like a, it's like a command.

172
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:47,680
It's nothing about memory. It's,
it's, it's a physical thing.

173
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,610
They just get jammed in it. Wow.
That's just like Julie Andrews,

174
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:54,370
like a Nazi [inaudible].
So then these, these,

175
00:10:54,371 --> 00:10:58,930
these meetings you'll get.

176
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,640
So if as we just learned water needs
a catalyst to nucleate or in order to

177
00:11:03,641 --> 00:11:04,540
freeze,

178
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:09,930
does it this at least raise
the possibility that that
Finnish Russian lake had

179
00:11:10,421 --> 00:11:14,200
reached a super cooled state along
come these horses and they were the

180
00:11:14,201 --> 00:11:17,170
nucleators maybe they had dust on
their hair or whatever, I don't know.

181
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,510
Whatever it was, it
started a chain reaction.

182
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:24,430
Ice Spread outward from these horses
shot across the entire lake and froze the

183
00:11:24,431 --> 00:11:27,040
whole damn thing at once.

184
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:34,710
[inaudible]

185
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:36,050
if you'll excuse me for just a second,

186
00:11:36,051 --> 00:11:38,030
because this is like a
tyrading like impulse. I have

187
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:44,290
[inaudible] now we can continue
close yours there. Alright,

188
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,220
we'll get to your skepticism in a moment,

189
00:11:46,221 --> 00:11:51,221
but I want to talk a little bit more
about nucleators for a second because when

190
00:11:51,261 --> 00:11:54,070
we were talking with Virginia, she
told us something kind of cool.

191
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:59,680
We asked her like, what else? Uh,
nucleates ice, like we learned about dust,

192
00:11:59,681 --> 00:12:04,630
but what else can do it? Okay, so
the best nuclear later is ice itself.

193
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:05,250
She says,

194
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:08,920
if a little bit of snow falls into some
water or a little bit ice forms in the

195
00:12:08,921 --> 00:12:12,610
water, organically, the water molecules
will rush around that and Bam,

196
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:14,290
if you don't have ice,

197
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:19,590
what is the second best thing to
nucleate this ice happens to be bacteria

198
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:22,730
today.

199
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:26,440
She says there are three different kinds
of bacteria that can generate these

200
00:12:26,441 --> 00:12:31,240
special proteins, big honkin proteins
that can instantly turn water into ice.

201
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:31,751
In fact,

202
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:35,080
when we were reporting the story of
video started circulating on the Internet

203
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:38,130
that showed a scientist taken a
bottle of water squirting coat,

204
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:42,430
a little bit of this bacteria in, and
then the thing just shot in the ice.

205
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:47,490
And the cool thing is these bacteria
are actually plant pathogens or plant

206
00:12:48,071 --> 00:12:48,610
killers.

207
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:53,020
So you've probably seen grass growing in
your backyard or whatever and it can be

208
00:12:53,021 --> 00:12:54,370
all covered with frost,

209
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:57,720
but then you know the frost can
melt and it's still green. Yeah,

210
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:00,490
but if those bacteria present,

211
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:03,430
she says they'll spit out
their proteins onto the plant,

212
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:06,640
which generates these ice
crystals, the ice crystals,

213
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:10,810
then slice the plant open and
expose the inside of the plant.

214
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:15,540
At the bacteria say, mm, yummy.
He lunch and the eat the uh,

215
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:19,270
eat the inside of the plant. It's a good
strategy, but that's not the cool part.

216
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:23,950
Virginia says she has also found these
proteins in bacteria that don't kill

217
00:13:23,951 --> 00:13:26,620
plants. So that made me
think, made her wonder why,

218
00:13:26,621 --> 00:13:28,750
like why would they need to make ice?

219
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:31,720
And that's when it occurred to
her and a few other researchers.

220
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:37,250
Maybe it's about transportation.
Exactly what we're thinking about.

221
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:41,180
These bacteria are just sitting on these
plants and what happens is the wind

222
00:13:41,181 --> 00:13:42,014
comes along,

223
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:47,120
blows up this little bacteria
into the upper atmosphere,

224
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:49,370
blows them literally up into the clouds.

225
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:52,970
[inaudible] not particularly cold
hardy. So now they have a situation,

226
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:54,890
they do not want to be
all the way up there.

227
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,990
They got to get back down to the earth.

228
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:01,250
And unless they hit your ride on those
horses that you keep talking about,

229
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:05,660
they're so light, they might not
come down to earth. So what they do,

230
00:14:05,661 --> 00:14:07,640
she suspects is they use the plant trick.

231
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:11,780
They spit out these proteins
into the cold wet cloud,

232
00:14:11,781 --> 00:14:15,740
which galvanizes the water
molecules around them to form

233
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:22,770
a snowflake around their body.

234
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:28,350
So now they've got this little hovercraft
that they can use to coast on down 15

235
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,230
meek ice.

236
00:14:29,231 --> 00:14:33,610
They can get back down and they can get
back down in a different place and start

237
00:14:33,611 --> 00:14:37,330
a new colony of bacteria somewhere
else. And so by this way,

238
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,720
they get dispersed around the
whole earth. Think about that.

239
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:44,060
The next time it's winter and it's snows.

240
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:47,960
Apparently if you melt each snowflake,

241
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:52,190
you will find a little bacterium
inside it. You're saying all of them,

242
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:56,240
all the stuff I eat, I haven't looked
at every single snowflake of course,

243
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:00,440
but it makes perfect sense, doesn't
it? But that's a myth. That's a very,

244
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:02,090
very cool idea. Yeah.

245
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:05,330
I suddenly like the bacteria Movio hell
of a lot better than the horse movie.

246
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:09,860
So at least I've, you know, and, and
it at least has a shot at being true.

247
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:16,160
Yeah. The horses.

248
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:21,440
So when we were reporting this story
and talking to Erin Pettit and Virginia

249
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,810
Walker and a bunch of other
scientists, when we asked them,

250
00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:29,170
could an entire league have flash frozen
in an instant trapping all those horses

251
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:34,940
uniformly? The answer that we got
was no. Did you hear her? No. There.

252
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,960
Did you hear the sound of it?
Let me ask it to a different way.

253
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:43,100
When you say absolutely not,
just to kind of a gentle no,

254
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:47,800
I'd say that's an absolutely
not because as Aaron,

255
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:51,430
you told us when you're talking
about freezing an entire lake, oh,

256
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:53,800
you've got a lot of
problems to consider. First,

257
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:58,870
the process of freezing actually is a
source of heat itself because like when

258
00:15:58,871 --> 00:16:01,210
water molecules form bonds to make ice,

259
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:05,830
that's a lot of activity and activity
produces energy and now that's going to

260
00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:07,090
make things a little bit warmer.

261
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:10,570
Not to mention the fact that
horses are warm blooded animals,

262
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,800
so they also would slow down
the process of freezing. Right.

263
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:17,110
Also the water would never have been
pure enough to super cool in the first

264
00:16:17,111 --> 00:16:18,100
place because there's,

265
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:23,430
there's too many things in the lake that
would provide that initial nucleation,

266
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:27,790
plants, organisms, dirt. Dammit.
Did somebody actually see this?

267
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:31,600
What is the actual evidence that um, no,

268
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:33,363
nobody saw

269
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:37,180
any of this as it actually happened
when we told Walter merge with the

270
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:42,510
scientists, told us in typical a
multi merge fashion, he was icy,

271
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:43,540
calm,

272
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:47,260
and you reminded us that he never told
us it was true that mallow parte often

273
00:16:47,261 --> 00:16:51,280
mixed fact and fiction and that the real
reason he was attracted to this story

274
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:56,110
was because it offered a metaphor for
cosmology right at the beginning of the

275
00:16:56,111 --> 00:16:56,944
universe.

276
00:16:57,370 --> 00:16:59,750
Really. I mean, I feel,

277
00:16:59,751 --> 00:17:04,580
excuse me if a small bit of skepticism
do things. It's true for the universe.

278
00:17:04,581 --> 00:17:09,140
Metaphor, metaphor, the metaphor even.
So what does he mean? What do you mean?

279
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:12,560
Here's what he means. And if you're
a physicist listening right now,

280
00:17:12,561 --> 00:17:13,610
just turn off the radio.

281
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:17,780
We're just talking among ourselves here,

282
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:20,430
right? So you can think of
it in one of two ways, right?

283
00:17:20,431 --> 00:17:24,900
The first is that idea of super cooling
that we saw at Rockefeller where under

284
00:17:24,901 --> 00:17:29,070
the right circumstances, water can
cool down way below its freezing point,

285
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,820
not freeze, and then all of a sudden,

286
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:34,083
oh

287
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:38,430
[inaudible]

288
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:41,370
and he can certainly do that, which we
saw at Rockefeller in the test tube. Now,

289
00:17:41,371 --> 00:17:45,480
according to Jan 11 professor of
physics and astronomy, Foreign College,

290
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:50,160
Columbia University, the
metaphor holds because that flash

291
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,770
freezing phenomenon actually
happened repeatedly.

292
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:56,040
She says in the moments
after the Big Bang, yes,

293
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:59,700
Super Cooling is definitely something
that happens in the early universe.

294
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:04,780
She says, right when the universe
got its start, he was still small,

295
00:18:04,781 --> 00:18:07,690
like the size of a grapefruit
inside that grapefruit.

296
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:12,700
It was extremely hot back then. It was
probably a million, trillion, trillion,

297
00:18:12,701 --> 00:18:16,870
trillion times hotter, million,
trillion, trillion, trillion,

298
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:21,760
10 to the 32 times hotter. But as a
little grapefruit began to expand,

299
00:18:21,761 --> 00:18:25,840
the temperature started to drop and it
dropped and dropped to a point where the

300
00:18:25,841 --> 00:18:29,740
universe should freeze, so
to speak, but it didn't,

301
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,650
and it's waiting. It's waiting to freeze
and you're like, what's happening?

302
00:18:32,651 --> 00:18:36,020
Why aren't you freezing? Then
suddenly, yeah. Oh, there it goes.

303
00:18:36,021 --> 00:18:40,490
Phase change the, go ahead. Okay. I
don't know exactly what you're saying.

304
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:42,530
We keep going. All I'm saying is
there's a lot of face changes.

305
00:18:42,531 --> 00:18:44,630
Some of them were super cool.
Don't worry about it. Okay.

306
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:48,410
There's another parallel, which I think
is actually even more interesting, um,

307
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:52,440
has to do with those seeds
we talked about. So if you
go back to the grapefruit,

308
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,400
okay,

309
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,230
inside, it's very, very hot.

310
00:18:56,231 --> 00:19:00,820
You've got this wash of energy
and this energy is uniform, right?

311
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:05,850
It's all [inaudible] the
same thing spread evenly,

312
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:08,980
everywhere, the same.
But then as things cool,

313
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:13,220
you begin to get these tiny fluctuations,

314
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:18,440
little variations in temperature
and density [inaudible]
a little bit hotter and

315
00:19:18,441 --> 00:19:21,530
denser in one point than another.
We're talking about clumps,

316
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,710
like maybe over here is a
little bit more mattered, right?

317
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:29,850
He'd been over there
and these are RC. I see.

318
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:31,580
I don't think that
you're describing seeds.

319
00:19:31,581 --> 00:19:36,350
Like I understand seed seeds are little
things, things that attract other stuff.

320
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:36,740
No, no.

321
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:41,630
But these behave just like seeds because
as the universe cools down and expands

322
00:19:41,631 --> 00:19:45,680
and begins to add all these new forces
and all these new particles, gravity,

323
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,690
electrons, photons, atoms,

324
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,730
those little bits of variation
from the beginning are still there.

325
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,450
And now they're growing bigger
because now we have gravity, right?

326
00:19:54,451 --> 00:19:58,680
So little concentrations of stuff are
now attracting more stuff and then more

327
00:19:58,681 --> 00:20:01,260
stuff and then more stuff.
And as the universe expands,

328
00:20:01,261 --> 00:20:05,670
they expand into ultimately those
little blips have become these massive

329
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:06,210
objects.

330
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:10,680
It's amazingly the largest structures
that we know about in the universe have

331
00:20:10,681 --> 00:20:15,430
their seeds in these tiny fluctuations.
Does that mean when you yeah,

332
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:17,530
go on a,

333
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,310
on a star wars kind of voyage.

334
00:20:21,311 --> 00:20:24,780
So you're in your spaceship and you're
going at some incredibly high speeds.

335
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:29,810
You're rushing through the universe
and you see huge clouds of gas with

336
00:20:30,581 --> 00:20:34,690
nurseries for stars and you leave them
and you go to a galaxy and then another

337
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:36,790
galaxy [inaudible] galaxy over
here and galaxy over there.

338
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:40,240
And collectively here you're saying
that these massive structures,

339
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:43,870
walls of galaxies, neighborhoods of stars,

340
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:48,340
that's gonna are reflections of very early

341
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:50,170
moment when something went

342
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,130
in the initial broil of stuff like this.

343
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:58,090
Some beautiful structures that you're
describing are like the snowflakes around

344
00:20:58,091 --> 00:20:59,140
the little bit of dust.

345
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:03,751
What does that mean?

346
00:21:03,751 --> 00:21:08,280
That the empty spaces that we see when
we gaze at the current universe are

347
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:13,020
actually filled with something that hasn't
cooled yet or that his quote or isn't

348
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:17,070
visible to us or is working
under different rules? I
can hijack your question.

349
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,250
I can say we might not have seen
the last of the phase transitions.

350
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:24,170
Our Universe is absolutely continuing
to cool. Is it really? Yeah,

351
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:28,400
it's cooling very cold
right now. We have this, uh,

352
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:33,440
dark energy driving the universe to expand
at an ever accelerated rate and it's

353
00:21:33,631 --> 00:21:37,380
conceivable that in the future that
energy will endorse some phase transition

354
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:39,540
and it will go away or,

355
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:42,900
or decay to something else
in this new state of matter.

356
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:46,140
It might do something different
to the evolution of universe.

357
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:48,420
So we might have a phase
transition in our future.

358
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:56,650
[inaudible] [inaudible]

359
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:58,630
suddenly they get a little

360
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:02,830
[inaudible].
