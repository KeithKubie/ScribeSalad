00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.179
Why Nana, what giant nose you have!

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.990
Why Pop-pop, what giant ears you have!

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:13.299
Are there parts of your body that never stop
growing?

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:15.589
Hey there irregular growths, Trace here for
DNews!

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:20.100
If today is your 21st birthday, then I’ve
got some bad news for you -- have a drink.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.380
Chances are that if you’re like most of
the population, you’ve stopped growing in

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:25.570
the last few years.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.870
Maybe even the last few months, if you’re
a male, because females undergo puberty earlier,

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:34.010
and subsequently reach the end of their development
a few years before males do.

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.969
When I say development, I don’t just mean
puberty, I mean all the development you’ve

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:41.211
gone through starting as a single-celled zygote,
and ending around age 21.

00:00:41.211 --> 00:00:45.180
Now, to be clear, you don't actually stop
growing.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.359
You probably have between 50 and 75 trillion
cells in your body at any one time, and each

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:55.010
of those has a limited lifespan, and will
almost certainly be replaced by a new cell,

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.208
unless it's a neuron in your brain; those
don’t regenerate on their own.

00:00:56.208 --> 00:00:59.330
Of course, your hair and nails keep growing
right up until you die, and by the way, your

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:03.989
hair and nails don’t continue growing after
death, as is the popular urban legend.

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.150
No actually, your SKIN shrinks when you die
thanks to dehydration, and it only looks like

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.180
things are growing.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.660
Ok, so by now it sounds like you really do
stop growing at the end of the puberty train,

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:19.170
but what’s the BIGGEST difference between
an adult man and an old man.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.480
Take a look at this picture.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.710
You might notice two… or I guess, three
big differences.

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.100
The schnozz and the two catcher’s mitts.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.460
The nose and the ears.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.090
They are noticeably larger on older people.

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.970
So do your nose and ears really keep growing
forever?

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.200
Would immortality mean that we all end up
looking like a giant Elephant person, trunk

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.200
included?

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.680
Well, the nose and the ears are made up of
something called “cartilage”.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.960
Cartilage is a type of tissue; and your body
has four kinds: connective, epithelial, muscular,

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.230
and nervous tissue.

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.880
That covers pretty much everything from skin
to the stuff between your bones, to your muscles

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:53.990
and nerves.

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.240
Each kind of tissue is unique.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.110
Cartilage is called “connective” tissue
which is the most abundant kind in your body

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.920
. That’s because cartilage is basically
like multi-purpose lubricant, glue, and duct

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.340
tape all in one.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.649
Cartilage can be worn down, stretched out,
serve as padding for things like your ribs,

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.209
the ends of your bones, and your spinal vertebrae,
as well as construct things outside of your

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:14.209
body.

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:17.870
Specifically, the nose and the ears, which
are made up of elastic cartilage.

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.319
And cartilage is special; it doesn’t have
blood vessels or nerves in it, which gives

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.010
it some interesting properties.

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.790
For one, when the tissue starts to break down,
and needs to repair itself… it can’t.

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.120
At least, not as easily or cleanly as the
rest of your tissue.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.120
Instead, cartilage ends up healing by scarring.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.810
The formerly elastic structure ends up harder,
and thicker, and droopier, especially as you

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:38.810
age17,.

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.599
It's not that cartilage keeps growing as you
get old; it's that it breaks down, sags, drips,

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:49.200
and noticeably enlarges when compared to the
more repairable skin of your face, lips, eyes,

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.200
and forehead.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.049
Those stay more or less tight while your ears
and nose slowly but surely succumb to entropy

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:56.049
and gravity.

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:57.049
So, yes.

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:01.019
Parts of the body do get larger in adulthood,
by comparison, like the ears and nose, and

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:04.500
some parts never stop growing while you’re
alive, like your hair and nails.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.959
But, if it’s your 21st birthday, then you’re
almost done developing and you’re stuck

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:10.959
this way…

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:12.079
well for a while.

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:15.879
Which makes sense from an evolutionary standpoint;
after puberty you’re ready to make a baby,

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:19.299
and once you're ready to make a baby, your
genetic structure basically gives up on trying

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:20.689
to make you better.

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:22.370
You might even get smaller.

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:23.830
Sorry big-nosed shorties.

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:25.450
But what if you want to build muscle mass.

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.019
Are you actually growing the muscle?

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:28.019
How does that work?

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:30.469
Amy has the answer for you right here.

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:33.550
So what are you the most afraid about in terms
of aging?
