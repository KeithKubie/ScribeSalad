and went to elementary school like all

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420
and went to elementary school like all
 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.830

children Harold all sort of classes
 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.260
children Harold all sort of classes
including some science classes that were

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270
including some science classes that were
 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.560
including some science classes that were
very boring at that time because they

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570
very boring at that time because they
 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.649
very boring at that time because they
consisted mostly of just memorizing but

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:25.659
consisted mostly of just memorizing but
 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:28.020

young 10 11 years old I liked to read so

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280
young 10 11 years old I liked to read so
 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.340
young 10 11 years old I liked to read so
I started to read some biographies of

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350
I started to read some biographies of
 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.649
I started to read some biographies of
scientists and came fascinated with that

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:37.659
scientists and came fascinated with that
 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:40.980
scientists and came fascinated with that
then I got my parents were very nice

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990
then I got my parents were very nice
 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.789
then I got my parents were very nice
with me at that time and they gave me a

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799
with me at that time and they gave me a
 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.039
with me at that time and they gave me a
chemistry set to do experiments and I

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:47.049
chemistry set to do experiments and I
 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:49.649
chemistry set to do experiments and I
was fascinated actually doing science

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659
was fascinated actually doing science
 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:51.719
was fascinated actually doing science
and doing experiments rather than just

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729
and doing experiments rather than just
 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.830
and doing experiments rather than just
memorizing issues and I remember I also

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840
memorizing issues and I remember I also
 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.889
memorizing issues and I remember I also
got a toy a microscope and discovered in

00:01:58.889 --> 00:01:58.899
got a toy a microscope and discovered in
 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:02.760
got a toy a microscope and discovered in
from I had some lettuce that I let rot

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770
from I had some lettuce that I let rot
 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.819
from I had some lettuce that I let rot
in water and when it started to smell I

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:05.829
in water and when it started to smell I
 

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:07.940
in water and when it started to smell I
was able to take a little drop of that

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950
was able to take a little drop of that
 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.970
was able to take a little drop of that
water and I was fascinating because

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:10.980
water and I was fascinating because
 

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:13.650
water and I was fascinating because
fascinated because with a microscope you

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660
fascinated because with a microscope you
 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.120
fascinated because with a microscope you
could see a different world

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130
could see a different world
 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.550
could see a different world
it's not visible to your naked eyes lots

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560
it's not visible to your naked eyes lots
 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.950
it's not visible to your naked eyes lots
of little creatures we know now the fair

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:19.960
of little creatures we know now the fair
 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.020
of little creatures we know now the fair
emission and amoeba and all sorts of

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030
emission and amoeba and all sorts of
 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.780
emission and amoeba and all sorts of
things and so at that point I decided I

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790
things and so at that point I decided I
 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.540
things and so at that point I decided I
wanted to become a scientist I thought

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550
wanted to become a scientist I thought
 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.880
wanted to become a scientist I thought
you could only do that that's a hobby

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890
you could only do that that's a hobby
 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.810
you could only do that that's a hobby
that will be my hobby I later realized

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820
that will be my hobby I later realized
 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.760
that will be my hobby I later realized
you could actually earn a living being a

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770
you could actually earn a living being a
 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.460
you could actually earn a living being a
scientist and of course I decided I

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470
scientist and of course I decided I
 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.090
scientist and of course I decided I
remained a scientist so I continued with

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100
remained a scientist so I continued with
 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.840
remained a scientist so I continued with
my interests basically reading and doing

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850
my interests basically reading and doing
 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.440
my interests basically reading and doing
experiments on my own then went to

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450
experiments on my own then went to
 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.500
experiments on my own then went to
college in Mexico I studied Chemical

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510
college in Mexico I studied Chemical
 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.770
college in Mexico I studied Chemical
Engineering because I like chemistry and

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780
Engineering because I like chemistry and
 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.120
Engineering because I like chemistry and
chemical engineering was very much

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130
chemical engineering was very much
 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:58.860
chemical engineering was very much
connected with the sort of things I was

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870
connected with the sort of things I was
 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:06.000
connected with the sort of things I was
interested in and it was many years ago

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010
interested in and it was many years ago
 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.080
interested in and it was many years ago
the century imagine but it was a

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090
the century imagine but it was a
 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.270
the century imagine but it was a
reasonably good school except that I

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280
reasonably good school except that I
 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.660
reasonably good school except that I
didn't get very up-to-date education at

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670
didn't get very up-to-date education at
 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.690
didn't get very up-to-date education at
that time modern science was not really

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700
that time modern science was not really
 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.020
that time modern science was not really
part of Chemical Engineering as it is

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030
part of Chemical Engineering as it is
 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.560
part of Chemical Engineering as it is
now what I learned a lot it was a good

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570
now what I learned a lot it was a good
 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.960
now what I learned a lot it was a good
education but then I decided at that

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970
education but then I decided at that
 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.140
education but then I decided at that
time I wanted to change from engineering

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150
time I wanted to change from engineering
 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.260
time I wanted to change from engineering
to basic science so first type I was

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:34.270
to basic science so first type I was
 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.240
to basic science so first type I was
able to get a scholarship and went to

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250
able to get a scholarship and went to
 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:39.690
able to get a scholarship and went to
Europe I spent almost two years in

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700
Europe I spent almost two years in
 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.140
Europe I spent almost two years in
Germany and then in France getting a

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150
Germany and then in France getting a
 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.990
Germany and then in France getting a
master's degree and so on but I realized

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000
master's degree and so on but I realized
 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.020
master's degree and so on but I realized
what I really wanted was to this change

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030
what I really wanted was to this change
 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.360
what I really wanted was to this change
from engineering to science was not easy

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370
from engineering to science was not easy
 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.450
from engineering to science was not easy
to carry out in Europe and I made the

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:54.460
to carry out in Europe and I made the
 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:57.210
to carry out in Europe and I made the
right decision and did manage to get a

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220
right decision and did manage to get a
 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.100
right decision and did manage to get a
scholarship to story in the United

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.110
scholarship to story in the United
 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.530
scholarship to story in the United
States so I went to Berkeley because

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540
States so I went to Berkeley because
 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.720
States so I went to Berkeley because
education there was at that time much

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730
education there was at that time much
 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.060
education there was at that time much
more flexible the Europeans have now

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.070
more flexible the Europeans have now
 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:07.800
more flexible the Europeans have now
tried to change in that direction

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810
tried to change in that direction
 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.070
tried to change in that direction
because here in the US when you go to

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.080
because here in the US when you go to
 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.880
because here in the US when you go to
you get you may get a PhD you become a

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890
you get you may get a PhD you become a
 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.270
you get you may get a PhD you become a
good friend of your mentor okay and you

good friend of your mentor okay and you
 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.910
good friend of your mentor okay and you
talk by first names and whatnot and then

talk by first names and whatnot and then
 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.659
talk by first names and whatnot and then
and you become involved with your mentor

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:24.669
and you become involved with your mentor
 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:26.400
and you become involved with your mentor
and with a group of students that will

these books next year come and see me

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:45.979
these books next year come and see me
 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:47.920
these books next year come and see me
and see what you've learned okay so that

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930
and see what you've learned okay so that
 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.739
and see what you've learned okay so that
doesn't work for me very well but in the

00:04:50.739 --> 00:04:50.749
doesn't work for me very well but in the
 

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:53.050
doesn't work for me very well but in the
United States was great because I

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060
United States was great because I
 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.769
United States was great because I
learned and I learned a lot of science

00:04:56.769 --> 00:04:56.779
learned and I learned a lot of science
 

00:04:56.779 --> 00:04:59.499
learned and I learned a lot of science
but it was my passion to do research to

00:04:59.499 --> 00:04:59.509
but it was my passion to do research to
 

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:03.399
but it was my passion to do research to
experiments finding new things and you

00:05:03.399 --> 00:05:03.409
experiments finding new things and you
 

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:05.409
experiments finding new things and you
know if the some of you here in a

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:05.419
know if the some of you here in a
 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:09.159
know if the some of you here in a
science museum how satisfying it is if

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:09.169
science museum how satisfying it is if
 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:11.920
science museum how satisfying it is if
you do things and you see that they work

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:11.930
you do things and you see that they work
 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.140
you do things and you see that they work
experience that they work but it's even

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.150
experience that they work but it's even
 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:16.769
experience that they work but it's even
more fascinating when you're working

00:05:16.769 --> 00:05:16.779
more fascinating when you're working
 

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:19.899
more fascinating when you're working
like I was with a very well-known mentor

00:05:19.899 --> 00:05:19.909
like I was with a very well-known mentor
 

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:22.240
like I was with a very well-known mentor
and you things that are new that you're

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:22.250
and you things that are new that you're
 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:25.089
and you things that are new that you're
the first one in this planet that finds

00:05:25.089 --> 00:05:25.099
the first one in this planet that finds
 

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:27.070
the first one in this planet that finds
out in my case it was some chemical

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.080
out in my case it was some chemical
 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.409
out in my case it was some chemical
lasers how some reactions take place and

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:29.419
lasers how some reactions take place and
 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:32.350
lasers how some reactions take place and
so on so I was very happy but it was

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:32.360
so on so I was very happy but it was
 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.040
so on so I was very happy but it was
very hard work but I did finish my PhD

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.050
very hard work but I did finish my PhD
 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:37.719
very hard work but I did finish my PhD
at Berkeley

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:37.729

doing very basic science and then with a
 

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:43.329
doing very basic science and then with a
colleague that I had met before that was

00:05:43.329 --> 00:05:43.339
colleague that I had met before that was
 

00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:45.159
colleague that I had met before that was
also doing very basic science his name

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:45.169
also doing very basic science his name
 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:48.550
also doing very basic science his name
was sherry Rowland decided to work with

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:48.560
was sherry Rowland decided to work with
 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.829
was sherry Rowland decided to work with
him and we both decided to do something

00:05:50.829 --> 00:05:50.839
him and we both decided to do something
 

00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:53.980
him and we both decided to do something
more applied something where we could

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:53.990
more applied something where we could
 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:55.990
more applied something where we could
apply this fundamental science perhaps

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:56.000
apply this fundamental science perhaps
 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.510
apply this fundamental science perhaps
so that it would have some impact on

00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:58.520
so that it would have some impact on
 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:04.779
so that it would have some impact on
society and we chose just to work on out

00:06:04.779 --> 00:06:04.789
society and we chose just to work on out
 

00:06:04.789 --> 00:06:08.019
society and we chose just to work on out
of curiosity to pick up an example of

00:06:08.019 --> 00:06:08.029
of curiosity to pick up an example of
 

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:11.379
of curiosity to pick up an example of
something that was new in the atmosphere

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:11.389
something that was new in the atmosphere
 

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:13.269
something that was new in the atmosphere
we were not almost very excited at that

00:06:13.269 --> 00:06:13.279
we were not almost very excited at that
 

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:16.059
we were not almost very excited at that
time so we chose a problem so we would

00:06:16.059 --> 00:06:16.069
time so we chose a problem so we would
 

00:06:16.069 --> 00:06:18.249
time so we chose a problem so we would
learn about it the problem that we chose

00:06:18.249 --> 00:06:18.259
learn about it the problem that we chose
 

00:06:18.259 --> 00:06:20.679
learn about it the problem that we chose
is what happens to certain industrial

00:06:20.679 --> 00:06:20.689
is what happens to certain industrial

chemicals that were just being developed
 

00:06:24.649 --> 00:06:26.980
chemicals that were just being developed
that they are not natural you heard a

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:26.990
that they are not natural you heard a
 

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:30.100
that they are not natural you heard a
very nice presentation as you as before

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:30.110
very nice presentation as you as before
 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:33.249
very nice presentation as you as before
we were talking that describe what went

00:06:33.249 --> 00:06:33.259
we were talking that describe what went
 

00:06:33.259 --> 00:06:35.589
we were talking that describe what went
on and then afterwards but essentially

00:06:35.589 --> 00:06:35.599
on and then afterwards but essentially
 

00:06:35.599 --> 00:06:38.259
on and then afterwards but essentially
we realize that these chemicals we

00:06:38.259 --> 00:06:38.269
we realize that these chemicals we
 

00:06:38.269 --> 00:06:39.939
we realize that these chemicals we
didn't know that that they would have a

00:06:39.939 --> 00:06:39.949
didn't know that that they would have a
 

00:06:39.949 --> 00:06:42.020
didn't know that that they would have a
very strong environmental impact

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:42.030
very strong environmental impact
 

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:44.090
very strong environmental impact
because they would affect the ozone

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:44.100
because they would affect the ozone
 

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:46.280
because they would affect the ozone

skin cancer okay so we certainly realize

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:55.050
skin cancer okay so we certainly realize
 

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:57.650
skin cancer okay so we certainly realize
that we had a big problem that was not

00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:57.660
that we had a big problem that was not
 

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:00.710
that we had a big problem that was not
we had the science but first the science

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:00.720
we had the science but first the science
 

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.870
we had the science but first the science
had to be checked by our colleagues and

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:02.880
had to be checked by our colleagues and
 

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:08.260
had to be checked by our colleagues and
then we had a big challenge of trying to

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:08.270
then we had a big challenge of trying to
 

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:11.030
then we had a big challenge of trying to
convince society to do something about

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:11.040
convince society to do something about
 

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:15.440
convince society to do something about
it but we managed because we had friends

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:15.450
it but we managed because we had friends
 

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:17.660
it but we managed because we had friends
in the scientific community other

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:17.670
in the scientific community other
 

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:19.970
in the scientific community other
atmospheric scientists that really

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:19.980
atmospheric scientists that really
 

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:22.250
atmospheric scientists that really
realized that it was indeed a serious

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:22.260
realized that it was indeed a serious
 

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.800
realized that it was indeed a serious
problem and they helped us but then we

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:24.810
problem and they helped us but then we
 

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:27.350
problem and they helped us but then we
we decided we have to communicate this

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:27.360
we decided we have to communicate this
 

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:29.300
we decided we have to communicate this
to society that was a challenge we

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:29.310
to society that was a challenge we
 

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:31.520
to society that was a challenge we
didn't know how to do that but we

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:31.530
didn't know how to do that but we
 

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:34.010
didn't know how to do that but we
learned we communicated with decision

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:34.020
learned we communicated with decision
 

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:37.760
learned we communicated with decision

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:40.670
makers in government first Congress man
and so on and then eventually we were

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:40.680
and so on and then eventually we were
 

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:43.190
and so on and then eventually we were
able to get even to heads of state but

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:43.200
able to get even to heads of state but
 

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:44.900
able to get even to heads of state but
together with some other friends that

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:44.910
together with some other friends that
 

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:47.000
together with some other friends that
were diplomats and so on and that's how

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:47.010
were diplomats and so on and that's how
 

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:49.550
were diplomats and so on and that's how
this international agreement the

this international agreement the
 

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:53.150
this international agreement the
Montreal Protocol came about and it was

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:53.160
Montreal Protocol came about and it was
 

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:56.450

that this international agreement was
agreed upon and by that time the

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:53.990
begins to come up which again takes
several months to before the night comes

00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:54.000
several months to before the night comes
 

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.389
several months to before the night comes
again

00:08:55.389 --> 00:08:55.399
again
 

00:08:55.399 --> 00:08:58.930
again
at that time with the light and we later

00:08:58.930 --> 00:08:58.940
at that time with the light and we later
 

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:01.960
at that time with the light and we later
found out exactly why and so on also

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:01.970
found out exactly why and so on also
 

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:03.990
found out exactly why and so on also
started to disappear at those altitudes

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:04.000
started to disappear at those altitudes
 

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.670
started to disappear at those altitudes
99 percent of the ozone was going away

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:06.680
99 percent of the ozone was going away
 

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:08.920
99 percent of the ozone was going away
in a matter of weeks okay so it was a

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:08.930
in a matter of weeks okay so it was a
 

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:12.100
in a matter of weeks okay so it was a
very spectacular effect that in some

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:12.110
very spectacular effect that in some
 

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:15.129
very spectacular effect that in some
sense it helped us to convince the world

00:09:15.129 --> 00:09:15.139
sense it helped us to convince the world
 

00:09:15.139 --> 00:09:17.079
sense it helped us to convince the world
that something was happening fortunately

00:09:17.079 --> 00:09:17.089
that something was happening fortunately
 

00:09:17.089 --> 00:09:20.230
that something was happening fortunately
not many people live under the Antarctic

00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:20.240
not many people live under the Antarctic
 

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:23.889
not many people live under the Antarctic
ozone hole but in the southern countries

00:09:23.889 --> 00:09:23.899
ozone hole but in the southern countries
 

00:09:23.899 --> 00:09:28.150

Chile and Argentina and so on people are

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:28.160
Chile and Argentina and so on people are
 

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:29.860
Chile and Argentina and so on people are
indeed affected and it's even in

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:29.870
indeed affected and it's even in
 

00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:33.400
indeed affected and it's even in
Australia and so on so it was very clear

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:33.410
Australia and so on so it was very clear
 

00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:35.829
Australia and so on so it was very clear
that it was an important problem and

00:09:35.829 --> 00:09:35.839
that it was an important problem and
 

00:09:35.839 --> 00:09:39.790
that it was an important problem and
anyhow we succeeded not just we but we

00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:39.800
anyhow we succeeded not just we but we
 

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:42.250
anyhow we succeeded not just we but we
were able to work together with the rest

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:42.260
were able to work together with the rest
 

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:43.810
were able to work together with the rest
of the first a scientific community

00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:43.820
of the first a scientific community
 

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:46.090
of the first a scientific community
protein also people in government and

00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:46.100
protein also people in government and
 

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:48.310
protein also people in government and
industries we were very closely to the

00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:48.320
industries we were very closely to the
 

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:50.710
industries we were very closely to the
industries that were manufacturing these

00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:50.720
industries that were manufacturing these
 

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:52.210
industries that were manufacturing these
chemicals that initially of course

00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:52.220
chemicals that initially of course
 

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:53.490
chemicals that initially of course
didn't want to do anything but

00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:53.500
didn't want to do anything but
 

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:55.660
didn't want to do anything but
afterwards when we convinced them that

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:55.670
afterwards when we convinced them that
 

00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:58.600
afterwards when we convinced them that
the science was correct they very

00:09:58.600 --> 00:09:58.610
the science was correct they very
 

00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:01.300
the science was correct they very
creatively came up with other chemicals

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:01.310
creatively came up with other chemicals
 

00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:03.850
creatively came up with other chemicals
that would not affect the ozone layer so

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:03.860
that would not affect the ozone layer so
 

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:07.300
that would not affect the ozone layer so
in a nutshell the mantra protocol is a

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:07.310
in a nutshell the mantra protocol is a
 

00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:10.180
in a nutshell the mantra protocol is a
very big success because it's the first

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:10.190
very big success because it's the first
 

00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:12.460
very big success because it's the first
time that we have a truly global problem

00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:12.470
time that we have a truly global problem
 

00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:14.860
time that we have a truly global problem
why global because it doesn't matter who

00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:14.870
why global because it doesn't matter who
 

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:16.689
why global because it doesn't matter who
are you manufacturer for you emit these

00:10:16.689 --> 00:10:16.699
are you manufacturer for you emit these
 

00:10:16.699 --> 00:10:19.480
are you manufacturer for you emit these
chemicals they mix all over the planet

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:19.490
chemicals they mix all over the planet
 

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:22.000
chemicals they mix all over the planet
and they affect this layer that protects

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:22.010
and they affect this layer that protects
 

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:23.650
and they affect this layer that protects
all over the planet

00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:23.660
all over the planet
 

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:25.810
all over the planet
so unless all the countries were

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:25.820
so unless all the countries were
 

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:27.939
so unless all the countries were
together you're not sure you're going to

00:10:27.939 --> 00:10:27.949
together you're not sure you're going to
 

00:10:27.949 --> 00:10:32.050
together you're not sure you're going to
be able to solve it but now we did it

00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:32.060
be able to solve it but now we did it
 

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:35.230
be able to solve it but now we did it
and the ozone layer is recovering hasn't

00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:35.240
and the ozone layer is recovering hasn't
 

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:37.569
and the ozone layer is recovering hasn't
recovered yet but we know why because

00:10:37.569 --> 00:10:37.579
recovered yet but we know why because
 

00:10:37.579 --> 00:10:40.090
recovered yet but we know why because
the CFCs remain in the atmosphere for

00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:40.100
the CFCs remain in the atmosphere for
 

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:42.550
the CFCs remain in the atmosphere for
many decades so we're still seeing the

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:42.560
many decades so we're still seeing the
 

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:45.040
many decades so we're still seeing the
effects what was emitted last century

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:45.050
effects what was emitted last century
 

00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:48.639
effects what was emitted last century
but it's very clearly recovering so that

00:10:48.639 --> 00:10:48.649
but it's very clearly recovering so that
 

00:10:48.649 --> 00:10:51.850
but it's very clearly recovering so that
that's essentially why we're sort of

00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:51.860
that's essentially why we're sort of
 

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:54.699
that's essentially why we're sort of
very happy we got also a Nobel Prize

00:10:54.699 --> 00:10:54.709
very happy we got also a Nobel Prize
 

00:10:54.709 --> 00:10:57.220
very happy we got also a Nobel Prize
which is extremely rewarding work but

00:10:57.220 --> 00:10:57.230
which is extremely rewarding work but
 

00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:59.769
which is extremely rewarding work but
it's a big responsibility because we

00:10:59.769 --> 00:10:59.779
it's a big responsibility because we
 

00:10:59.779 --> 00:11:02.470
it's a big responsibility because we
realized that having a Nobel Prize we

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:02.480
realized that having a Nobel Prize we
 

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:07.750
realized that having a Nobel Prize we
have access to different layers if you

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:07.760
have access to different layers if you
 

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:08.500
have access to different layers if you
want you

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:08.510
want you
 

00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:11.019
want you
in policy issues all the way to heads of

00:11:11.019 --> 00:11:11.029
in policy issues all the way to heads of
 

00:11:11.029 --> 00:11:16.329
in policy issues all the way to heads of
state and we are trying to use what we

00:11:16.329 --> 00:11:16.339
state and we are trying to use what we
 

00:11:16.339 --> 00:11:18.189
state and we are trying to use what we
learned to deal with climate change

00:11:18.189 --> 00:11:18.199
learned to deal with climate change
 

00:11:18.199 --> 00:11:20.050
learned to deal with climate change
that's another very big issue I could

00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:20.060
that's another very big issue I could
 

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:22.120
that's another very big issue I could
keep talking for hours about that you

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:22.130
keep talking for hours about that you
 

00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:24.939
keep talking for hours about that you
heard a little bit and we haven't done

00:11:24.939 --> 00:11:24.949
heard a little bit and we haven't done
 

00:11:24.949 --> 00:11:29.350
heard a little bit and we haven't done
that yet we in a big summary finally

00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:29.360
that yet we in a big summary finally
 

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:33.180
that yet we in a big summary finally
after many years we have a similar

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:33.190
after many years we have a similar
 

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:35.740
after many years we have a similar
international agreement which is the the

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:35.750
international agreement which is the the
 

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:39.389
international agreement which is the the
Paris Accord which practically all the

heads of state in the planet agree that

00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:43.100
heads of state in the planet agree that
 

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:45.160
heads of state in the planet agree that
we have to follow that to solve the

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:45.170
we have to follow that to solve the
 

00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:48.129
we have to follow that to solve the
problem there is one exception only one

00:11:48.129 --> 00:11:48.139
problem there is one exception only one

I'm talking about wrong and that's for

00:11:56.819 --> 00:11:56.829
I'm talking about wrong and that's for
 

00:11:56.829 --> 00:11:59.019
I'm talking about wrong and that's for
irrational reasons we consider that to

00:11:59.019 --> 00:11:59.029
irrational reasons we consider that to

be a very high Eva sponsibility to
future generations so we're going to do

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:04.370
future generations so we're going to do
 

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:05.410
future generations so we're going to do
something about it

00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:05.420
something about it
 

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:07.900
something about it
but we think this is temporary because

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:07.910
but we think this is temporary because
 

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:11.949
but we think this is temporary because

Massachusetts we need majors of all the

00:12:15.819 --> 00:12:15.829
Massachusetts we need majors of all the

Massachusetts we need majors of all the
big city we're all working together and

00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:17.750
big city we're all working together and
 

00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:20.350
big city we're all working together and
the bottom line is when we work together

00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:20.360
the bottom line is when we work together
 

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:22.660
the bottom line is when we work together
and when we have something that we can

00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:22.670
and when we have something that we can
 

00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:26.530
and when we have something that we can
justify with science and we can do it

00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:26.540
justify with science and we can do it
 

00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:29.680
justify with science and we can do it
very clearly then we know that the

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:29.690
very clearly then we know that the
 

00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:31.629
very clearly then we know that the
problem can be solved because we have

00:12:31.629 --> 00:12:31.639
problem can be solved because we have
 

00:12:31.639 --> 00:12:33.819
problem can be solved because we have
done it before but we have to work very

00:12:33.819 --> 00:12:33.829
done it before but we have to work very
 

00:12:33.829 --> 00:12:36.670
done it before but we have to work very
hard so I invite all of you to keep

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:36.680
hard so I invite all of you to keep
 

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:37.480
hard so I invite all of you to keep
working hard

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:37.490
working hard
 

00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:40.180
working hard
for the benefit of everybody in summary

so you talked a lot about working with

00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:49.180
so you talked a lot about working with
 

00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:51.600

talk a lot about teamwork right do you

00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:56.770
talk a lot about teamwork right do you
 

00:12:56.770 --> 00:12:59.160
talk a lot about teamwork right do you

see yourself as a change maker and what
 

00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:03.240
see yourself as a change maker and what
is a change maker to you change maker is

became much clearer there are now

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:36.370
became much clearer there are now
 

00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:39.120
became much clearer there are now
scientific papers and groups that are

they are not disappearing naturally they

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:27.340
they are not disappearing naturally they
 

00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:29.720
they are not disappearing naturally they
are disappearing because we humans are

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:29.730
are disappearing because we humans are
 

00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:33.000
are disappearing because we humans are
doing a lot of deforestation and using a

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:33.010
doing a lot of deforestation and using a
 

00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:35.850
doing a lot of deforestation and using a
lot of land for agriculture so the point

00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:35.860
lot of land for agriculture so the point
 

00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:37.650
lot of land for agriculture so the point
is where you should be much more careful

00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:37.660
is where you should be much more careful
 

00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:39.780
is where you should be much more careful
now because those are very important

00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:39.790
now because those are very important
 

00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:42.510
now because those are very important
components of ecology that it will be

00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:42.520
components of ecology that it will be
 

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:45.420
components of ecology that it will be
very important for future generations to

very important for future generations to
 

00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:47.130
very important for future generations to
make sure that we don't deplete all the

00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:47.140
make sure that we don't deplete all the
 

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:49.440
make sure that we don't deplete all the
natural resources that we have to count

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:49.450
natural resources that we have to count
 

00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:54.140
natural resources that we have to count
on for our survival and for to achieve a

that you did did you have a mentor and

00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:07.910
that you did did you have a mentor and
 

00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:09.640
that you did did you have a mentor and
how important is mentorships between

00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:09.650
how important is mentorships between
 

00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:11.800
how important is mentorships between
young people and adults I think it's

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:11.810
young people and adults I think it's
 

00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:13.660
young people and adults I think it's
it's very important of course the main

about explaining science to the public

00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:28.580
about explaining science to the public
 

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:32.140
about explaining science to the public
but I became very good friends and so

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:32.150
but I became very good friends and so
 

00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:35.800
but I became very good friends and so
that was a very important relationship

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:35.810
that was a very important relationship
 

00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:38.350
that was a very important relationship
if you were at that time not connected

00:15:38.350 --> 00:15:38.360
if you were at that time not connected
 

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:40.240
if you were at that time not connected
with environmental issues but just with

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:40.250
with environmental issues but just with
 

00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:42.610
with environmental issues but just with
learning science he was passionate about

00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:42.620
learning science he was passionate about
 

00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:44.530
learning science he was passionate about
science and of course I was passionate

00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:44.540
science and of course I was passionate
 

00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:47.560
science and of course I was passionate
about science as a graduate students

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:47.570
about science as a graduate students
 

00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:51.160
about science as a graduate students
before that in Mexico and college many

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:51.170
before that in Mexico and college many
 

00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:53.950
before that in Mexico and college many
of my teachers were not particularly

00:15:53.950 --> 00:15:53.960
of my teachers were not particularly
 

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:57.130
of my teachers were not particularly
good because at that time the University

00:15:57.130 --> 00:15:57.140
good because at that time the University
 

00:15:57.140 --> 00:15:59.140
good because at that time the University
of Mexico was just growing the National

00:15:59.140 --> 00:15:59.150
of Mexico was just growing the National
 

00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:02.140
of Mexico was just growing the National
University now it's become more like

00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:02.150
University now it's become more like
 

00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:05.050
University now it's become more like
American European universities where the

00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:05.060
American European universities where the
 

00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:08.290
American European universities where the
professors do research but at a time in

00:16:08.290 --> 00:16:08.300
professors do research but at a time in
 

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:10.210
professors do research but at a time in
chemical engineering some of them were

00:16:10.210 --> 00:16:10.220
chemical engineering some of them were
 

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:14.710
chemical engineering some of them were
just working in industry maybe not

00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:14.720
just working in industry maybe not
 

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:16.120
just working in industry maybe not
necessarily doing science or engineering

00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:16.130
necessarily doing science or engineering
 

00:16:16.130 --> 00:16:19.480
necessarily doing science or engineering
and they lectured just a little bit as a

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:19.490
and they lectured just a little bit as a
 

00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:22.870
and they lectured just a little bit as a
hobby and I never realized not all of

00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:22.880
hobby and I never realized not all of
 

00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:25.030
hobby and I never realized not all of
them understood science very well okay

00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:25.040
them understood science very well okay
 

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:28.060
them understood science very well okay
but a few of them were magnificent those

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:28.070
but a few of them were magnificent those
 

00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:31.270
but a few of them were magnificent those
were also my mentors I became friends

00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:31.280
were also my mentors I became friends
 

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:36.310
were also my mentors I became friends
and so on and it as I go back in time in

00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:36.320
and so on and it as I go back in time in
 

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:38.290
and so on and it as I go back in time in
high school I've had a couple of also

00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:38.300
high school I've had a couple of also
 

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:42.610
high school I've had a couple of also
very good teachers but not very many and

00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:42.620
very good teachers but not very many and
 

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:43.660
very good teachers but not very many and
that's what we were trying to change

00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:43.670
that's what we were trying to change
 

00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:47.440
that's what we were trying to change
because we realize that the way science

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:47.450
because we realize that the way science
 

00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:50.080
because we realize that the way science
is taught in schools has to change it's

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:50.090
is taught in schools has to change it's
 

00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:52.510
is taught in schools has to change it's
already changing with what we call

00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:52.520
already changing with what we call
 

00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:55.450
already changing with what we call
active learning namely we don't just

00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:55.460
active learning namely we don't just
 

00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:59.590
active learning namely we don't just
expect that the teacher will tell the

00:16:59.590 --> 00:16:59.600
expect that the teacher will tell the
 

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:01.420
expect that the teacher will tell the
students what science is all about and

00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:01.430
students what science is all about and
 

00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:04.660
students what science is all about and
expecting to memorize it but the the

00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:04.670
expecting to memorize it but the the
 

00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:06.460
expecting to memorize it but the the
actually you get the students to do

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:06.470
actually you get the students to do
 

00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:08.590
actually you get the students to do
science to do experience and then

00:17:08.590 --> 00:17:08.600
science to do experience and then
 

00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:10.120
science to do experience and then
discuss it among them sir

00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:10.130
discuss it among them sir
 

00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:12.640
discuss it among them sir
and then form groups and then you

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:12.650
and then form groups and then you
 

00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:15.189
and then form groups and then you
discuss it with the teacher and you do

00:17:15.189 --> 00:17:15.199
discuss it with the teacher and you do
 

00:17:15.199 --> 00:17:17.590
discuss it with the teacher and you do
actual experiments you go and plant

00:17:17.590 --> 00:17:17.600
actual experiments you go and plant
 

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:20.529
actual experiments you go and plant
seeds and see how plants grow as animals

00:17:20.529 --> 00:17:20.539
seeds and see how plants grow as animals
 

00:17:20.539 --> 00:17:22.569
seeds and see how plants grow as animals
grow and in that way you also learn to

00:17:22.569 --> 00:17:22.579
grow and in that way you also learn to
 

00:17:22.579 --> 00:17:25.000
grow and in that way you also learn to
appreciate nature it's not just the

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:25.010
appreciate nature it's not just the
 

00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:27.340
appreciate nature it's not just the
science but you develop the values

00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:27.350
science but you develop the values
 

00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:30.130
science but you develop the values
working together with other students

00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:30.140
working together with other students
 

00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:32.500
working together with other students
also you also develop this very

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:32.510
also you also develop this very
 

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:35.289
also you also develop this very
important component of the solutions

00:17:35.289 --> 00:17:35.299
important component of the solutions
 

00:17:35.299 --> 00:17:36.669
important component of the solutions
we're talking about this working

00:17:36.669 --> 00:17:36.679
we're talking about this working
 

00:17:36.679 --> 00:17:40.570
we're talking about this working
together we all end up winning that's

00:17:40.570 --> 00:17:40.580
together we all end up winning that's
 

00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:43.149
together we all end up winning that's
very clear there always somebody that

00:17:43.149 --> 00:17:43.159
very clear there always somebody that
 

00:17:43.159 --> 00:17:44.950
very clear there always somebody that
tries to cheat and so on but if you can

00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:44.960
tries to cheat and so on but if you can
 

00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:48.430
tries to cheat and so on but if you can
avoid that we can do much better when we

00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:48.440
avoid that we can do much better when we
 

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:50.560
avoid that we can do much better when we
do it together and that's what we're

00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:50.570
do it together and that's what we're
 

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:54.430
do it together and that's what we're
trying to to change starting in

00:17:54.430 --> 00:17:54.440
trying to to change starting in
 

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:56.110
trying to to change starting in
elementary school but going all the way

00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:56.120
elementary school but going all the way
 

00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:58.810
elementary school but going all the way
to college levels so sounds like

00:17:58.810 --> 00:17:58.820
to college levels so sounds like
 

00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:03.370
to college levels so sounds like
education is key and at the KYC we do a

00:18:03.370 --> 00:18:03.380
education is key and at the KYC we do a
 

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:04.750
education is key and at the KYC we do a
lot of active learning hands-on

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:04.760
lot of active learning hands-on
 

00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:07.180
lot of active learning hands-on
activities but there are still barriers

00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:07.190
activities but there are still barriers
 

00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:09.700
activities but there are still barriers
when it comes to doing this kind of

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:09.710
when it comes to doing this kind of
 

00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:11.590
when it comes to doing this kind of
scientific work so what's it like being

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:11.600
scientific work so what's it like being
 

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:14.110
scientific work so what's it like being

up in Mexico and went to college in
 

00:18:20.929 --> 00:18:23.399
up in Mexico and went to college in
Mexico I was lucky in the sense that

00:18:23.399 --> 00:18:23.409
Mexico I was lucky in the sense that
 

00:18:23.409 --> 00:18:26.950

to begin with so if it was sort of

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:32.210
to begin with so if it was sort of
 

00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:37.230
to begin with so if it was sort of
natural that you didn't have to be a

later of course realized and is learning

00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:45.470
later of course realized and is learning
 

00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:48.100
later of course realized and is learning
about our society functions that can be

00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:48.110
about our society functions that can be
 

00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:52.450
about our society functions that can be
a very big barrier in the same way that

00:18:52.450 --> 00:18:52.460
a very big barrier in the same way that
 

00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:54.399
a very big barrier in the same way that
it is let me give you an example which

00:18:54.399 --> 00:18:54.409
it is let me give you an example which
 

00:18:54.409 --> 00:18:56.529
it is let me give you an example which
is sort of connected for that the role

00:18:56.529 --> 00:18:56.539
is sort of connected for that the role
 

00:18:56.539 --> 00:19:01.060

Mexico studying engineering we had just

00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:04.460
Mexico studying engineering we had just
 

00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:06.190
Mexico studying engineering we had just
a handful of women studying engineering

00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:06.200
a handful of women studying engineering
 

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:10.289
a handful of women studying engineering
as well women normally they studied

00:19:10.289 --> 00:19:10.299
as well women normally they studied
 

00:19:10.299 --> 00:19:13.169

perhaps form a suitable chemistry or so

00:19:13.169 --> 00:19:13.179
perhaps form a suitable chemistry or so
 

00:19:13.179 --> 00:19:16.720
perhaps form a suitable chemistry or so
things have changed now what the best

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:16.730
things have changed now what the best
 

00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:22.270
things have changed now what the best
example is at the MIT they got very well

00:19:22.270 --> 00:19:22.280
example is at the MIT they got very well
 

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:23.500

years in this aspect and so the fact is

00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:26.900
years in this aspect and so the fact is
 

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:29.860
years in this aspect and so the fact is
that now you have as many women as men

00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:29.870
that now you have as many women as men
 

00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:35.740
that now you have as many women as men
as male engineers that's fascinating but

00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:35.750
as male engineers that's fascinating but
 

00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:37.720
as male engineers that's fascinating but
there's one more very interesting aspect

00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:37.730
there's one more very interesting aspect
 

00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:40.150
there's one more very interesting aspect
this is already a decade ago or so at

00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:40.160
this is already a decade ago or so at
 

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:43.180
this is already a decade ago or so at
MIT they realized we already done the

00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:43.190
MIT they realized we already done the
 

00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:46.330
MIT they realized we already done the
right thing with students but something

00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:46.340
right thing with students but something
 

00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:48.850
right thing with students but something
is wrong because practically all the

00:19:48.850 --> 00:19:48.860
is wrong because practically all the
 

00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:52.510
is wrong because practically all the
managers the president the Chancellor

00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:52.520
managers the president the Chancellor
 

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:56.200
managers the president the Chancellor
they were all male something is wrong so

00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:56.210
they were all male something is wrong so
 

00:19:56.210 --> 00:19:59.050
they were all male something is wrong so
they decided to actively change it the

00:19:59.050 --> 00:19:59.060
they decided to actively change it the
 

00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:01.990
they decided to actively change it the
next president was a woman a very nice

00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:02.000
next president was a woman a very nice
 

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.670
next president was a woman a very nice
and very efficient president of MIT and

00:20:06.670 --> 00:20:06.680
and very efficient president of MIT and
 

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:10.450
and very efficient president of MIT and
so nowadays half of the leaders are

00:20:10.450 --> 00:20:10.460
so nowadays half of the leaders are
 

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:13.060
so nowadays half of the leaders are
women as well so you have to actively

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:13.070
women as well so you have to actively
 

00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:14.920
women as well so you have to actively
realize that there's a problem and

00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:14.930
realize that there's a problem and
 

00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:18.880
realize that there's a problem and
change that not just starting and with

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:18.890
change that not just starting and with
 

00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:20.890
change that not just starting and with
the students but at all levels okay

00:20:20.890 --> 00:20:20.900
the students but at all levels okay
 

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:23.230
the students but at all levels okay
that's what is still missing in society

00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:23.240
that's what is still missing in society
 

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:24.910
that's what is still missing in society
we need to do that in with our

00:20:24.910 --> 00:20:24.920
we need to do that in with our
 

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:27.880
we need to do that in with our
politicians and so on and we know that

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:27.890
politicians and so on and we know that
 

00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:29.530
politicians and so on and we know that
there are still difference in salaries

00:20:29.530 --> 00:20:29.540
there are still difference in salaries
 

00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:31.720
there are still difference in salaries
so we have to keep working with it

00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:31.730
so we have to keep working with it
 

00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:34.450
so we have to keep working with it
but in terms of minorities I better

00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:34.460
but in terms of minorities I better
 

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:38.800
but in terms of minorities I better
don't talk a lot because you know that

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:38.810
don't talk a lot because you know that
 

00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:41.290
don't talk a lot because you know that
we do have a problem with the central

00:20:41.290 --> 00:20:41.300
we do have a problem with the central
 

00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:44.950
we do have a problem with the central
government that is terrible okay and so

00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:44.960
government that is terrible okay and so
 

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:47.800
government that is terrible okay and so
that I think that poor misunderstanding

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:47.810
that I think that poor misunderstanding
 

00:20:47.810 --> 00:20:52.150
that I think that poor misunderstanding
and it has to do in the in the running

00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:52.160
and it has to do in the in the running
 

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:55.570
and it has to do in the in the running
it really has to do with ignorance I've

00:20:55.570 --> 00:20:55.580
it really has to do with ignorance I've
 

00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:57.490
it really has to do with ignorance I've
got to tell you something but there's no

00:20:57.490 --> 00:20:57.500
got to tell you something but there's no
 

00:20:57.500 --> 00:21:01.450
got to tell you something but there's no
press around I hope it turns out this is

00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:01.460
press around I hope it turns out this is
 

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:06.060
press around I hope it turns out this is
sort of known by by Mexicans that

00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:06.070
 
 

00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:08.410
 
President Trump you know he's a

00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:08.420
President Trump you know he's a
 

00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:11.530
President Trump you know he's a
businessman so some years before he ran

00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:11.540
businessman so some years before he ran
 

00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:14.260
businessman so some years before he ran
for president one of his business

00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:14.270
for president one of his business
 

00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:16.540

expansions had to do with building a

00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:16.550
expansions had to do with building a
 

00:21:16.550 --> 00:21:20.590
expansions had to do with building a
resort in Mexico in Baja California but

00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:20.600
resort in Mexico in Baja California but
 

00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:24.210
resort in Mexico in Baja California but
it was in a place that was sort of

00:21:24.210 --> 00:21:24.220
it was in a place that was sort of
 

00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:26.620
it was in a place that was sort of
government controlled because you wanted

00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:26.630
government controlled because you wanted
 

00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:29.290
government controlled because you wanted
to protect by diversity where so they

00:21:29.290 --> 00:21:29.300
to protect by diversity where so they
 

00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:32.880
to protect by diversity where so they
did not allow him to build his

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:32.890
did not allow him to build his
 

00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:36.990
did not allow him to build his
his project and he was very upset so I

00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:37.000
his project and he was very upset so I
 

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.900
his project and he was very upset so I
think that explains in part

00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:39.910
think that explains in part
 

00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:42.160
think that explains in part

00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:51.460
 
so I see that a few hands already up so

00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:51.470
so I see that a few hands already up so
 

00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:53.139
so I see that a few hands already up so
we can get to a question answer but

00:21:53.139 --> 00:21:53.149
we can get to a question answer but
 

00:21:53.149 --> 00:21:54.879
we can get to a question answer but
before I do that I forgot to do

00:21:54.879 --> 00:21:54.889
before I do that I forgot to do
 

00:21:54.889 --> 00:21:56.470
before I do that I forgot to do
something because I'm a little nervous

00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:56.480
something because I'm a little nervous
 

00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:58.990
something because I'm a little nervous
up here but I have five brothers and

00:21:58.990 --> 00:21:59.000
up here but I have five brothers and
 

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.299
up here but I have five brothers and
brothers well my brothers and I'm the

oldest and only girl and so we're always
 

00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:05.350
oldest and only girl and so we're always
like competing to see who's like the

00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:05.360
like competing to see who's like the
 

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:08.139
like competing to see who's like the
coolest kid or whatever and so one of my

00:22:08.139 --> 00:22:08.149
coolest kid or whatever and so one of my
 

00:22:08.149 --> 00:22:09.789
coolest kid or whatever and so one of my
brothers was just named like one of the

00:22:09.789 --> 00:22:09.799
brothers was just named like one of the
 

00:22:09.799 --> 00:22:11.590
brothers was just named like one of the
best baseball players in Minnesota cool

00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:11.600
best baseball players in Minnesota cool
 

00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:14.590
best baseball players in Minnesota cool
whatever and then my other brother is

00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:14.600
whatever and then my other brother is

so that's cool too but I'm up here with

00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:22.190
so that's cool too but I'm up here with
 

00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:28.529
so that's cool too but I'm up here with
Mario Molina and I think that's cool so

00:22:28.529 --> 00:22:28.539
Mario Molina and I think that's cool so
 

00:22:28.539 --> 00:22:31.720
Mario Molina and I think that's cool so

haven't it's a microphone and so you

00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:36.520
haven't it's a microphone and so you
 

00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:39.419
haven't it's a microphone and so you
just put it up to you and it works as a

00:23:39.419 --> 00:23:39.429
just put it up to you and it works as a
 

00:23:39.429 --> 00:23:41.360
just put it up to you and it works as a
microphone so it's really cool science

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:41.370
microphone so it's really cool science
 

00:23:41.370 --> 00:23:43.680
microphone so it's really cool science
so I'm gonna throw it to someone ask

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:43.690
so I'm gonna throw it to someone ask
 

00:23:43.690 --> 00:23:45.330
so I'm gonna throw it to someone ask
your question and then we're just gonna

00:23:45.330 --> 00:23:45.340
your question and then we're just gonna
 

00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:47.250
your question and then we're just gonna
have you answer it and then keep going

have you answer it and then keep going
sound good okay all right um I play

00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:50.710
sound good okay all right um I play
 

00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:54.270
sound good okay all right um I play
softball for 14 years but I this is

00:23:54.270 --> 00:23:54.280
softball for 14 years but I this is
 

00:23:54.280 --> 00:24:01.850
softball for 14 years but I this is
different there you go you said that

00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:01.860
different there you go you said that
 

00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:06.149
different there you go you said that
slowly the ozone layer is the hole in

00:24:06.149 --> 00:24:06.159
slowly the ozone layer is the hole in
 

00:24:06.159 --> 00:24:08.460
slowly the ozone layer is the hole in
the ozone layer is repairing how exactly

00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:08.470
the ozone layer is repairing how exactly
 

00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:10.070
the ozone layer is repairing how exactly
is it repaired

00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:10.080
is it repaired
 

00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:12.450
is it repaired
did I get the questions that's over the

00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:12.460
did I get the questions that's over the
 

00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:15.299
did I get the questions that's over the
ozone layer is okay you said slowly the

00:24:15.299 --> 00:24:15.309
ozone layer is okay you said slowly the
 

00:24:15.309 --> 00:24:17.520
ozone layer is okay you said slowly the
hole in the ozone layers repairing how

00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:17.530
hole in the ozone layers repairing how
 

00:24:17.530 --> 00:24:20.220
hole in the ozone layers repairing how
exactly is it repairing itself it's okay

00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:20.230
exactly is it repairing itself it's okay
 

00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:23.010
exactly is it repairing itself it's okay
because we can measure that this part of

00:24:23.010 --> 00:24:23.020
because we can measure that this part of
 

00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:27.140
because we can measure that this part of
the way the science works we know that

00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:27.150
the way the science works we know that
 

00:24:27.150 --> 00:24:30.360
the way the science works we know that
something was happening to it not when

00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:30.370
something was happening to it not when
 

00:24:30.370 --> 00:24:34.020
something was happening to it not when
we first started suggesting that it that

00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:34.030
we first started suggesting that it that
 

00:24:34.030 --> 00:24:37.310
we first started suggesting that it that
these chemicals were affected but then

00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:37.320
these chemicals were affected but then
 

00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:40.230
these chemicals were affected but then
measurements from satellites from at

00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:40.240
measurements from satellites from at
 

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:42.779
measurements from satellites from at
that time they were balloon measurements

00:24:42.779 --> 00:24:42.789
that time they were balloon measurements
 

00:24:42.789 --> 00:24:45.510
that time they were balloon measurements
okay do you send a balloon up filled

00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:45.520
okay do you send a balloon up filled
 

00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:49.560
okay do you send a balloon up filled
with helium all the way up to 40 50

00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:49.570
with helium all the way up to 40 50
 

00:24:49.570 --> 00:24:51.600
with helium all the way up to 40 50
kilometers altitude and they were doing

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:51.610
kilometers altitude and they were doing
 

00:24:51.610 --> 00:24:54.240
kilometers altitude and they were doing
measurements later in Antarctica you

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:54.250
measurements later in Antarctica you
 

00:24:54.250 --> 00:24:56.970
measurements later in Antarctica you
know that that was not in Antarctica so

00:24:56.970 --> 00:24:56.980
know that that was not in Antarctica so
 

00:24:56.980 --> 00:24:59.190
know that that was not in Antarctica so
the first set of measurements were in

00:24:59.190 --> 00:24:59.200
the first set of measurements were in
 

00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:05.310
the first set of measurements were in
other parts of the planet but then if

00:25:05.310 --> 00:25:05.320
other parts of the planet but then if
 

00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:07.380
other parts of the planet but then if
you have the story also had been

00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:07.390
you have the story also had been
 

00:25:07.390 --> 00:25:11.760
you have the story also had been
measured before mostly by not by

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:11.770
measured before mostly by not by
 

00:25:11.770 --> 00:25:14.340
measured before mostly by not by
chemists but what people in meteorology

00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:14.350
chemists but what people in meteorology
 

00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:16.320
chemists but what people in meteorology
and we call Earth Sciences because they

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:16.330
and we call Earth Sciences because they
 

00:25:16.330 --> 00:25:17.850
and we call Earth Sciences because they
wanted to understand how the

00:25:17.850 --> 00:25:17.860
wanted to understand how the
 

00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:20.700
wanted to understand how the
stratosphere functions and also is made

00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:20.710
stratosphere functions and also is made
 

00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:23.549
stratosphere functions and also is made
at the tropics and then moves to higher

00:25:23.549 --> 00:25:23.559
at the tropics and then moves to higher
 

00:25:23.559 --> 00:25:25.980
at the tropics and then moves to higher
latitudes so it was very interesting to

00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:25.990
latitudes so it was very interesting to
 

00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:29.760
latitudes so it was very interesting to
measure also used to see how things move

00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:29.770
measure also used to see how things move
 

00:25:29.770 --> 00:25:32.070
measure also used to see how things move
so they were sort of annoyed that we

00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:32.080
so they were sort of annoyed that we
 

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:34.409
so they were sort of annoyed that we
chemists then came along I say hey

00:25:34.409 --> 00:25:34.419
chemists then came along I say hey
 

00:25:34.419 --> 00:25:36.480
chemists then came along I say hey
something's happening to it

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:36.490
something's happening to it
 

00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:38.790
something's happening to it
over Antarctica it's very interesting

00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:38.800
over Antarctica it's very interesting
 

00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:41.820
over Antarctica it's very interesting
how it was measured because balloons are

00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:41.830
how it was measured because balloons are
 

00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:43.620
how it was measured because balloons are
difficult it's difficult to do that but

00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:43.630
difficult it's difficult to do that but
 

00:25:43.630 --> 00:25:45.830
difficult it's difficult to do that but
you could measure ocean from the ground

00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:45.840
you could measure ocean from the ground
 

00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:49.550
you could measure ocean from the ground
because the ultraviolet radiation that

00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:49.560
because the ultraviolet radiation that
 

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:52.950
because the ultraviolet radiation that
destroys our DNA makes it to this

00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:52.960
destroys our DNA makes it to this
 

00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:54.540
destroys our DNA makes it to this
instrument so you can measure it from

00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:54.550
instrument so you can measure it from
 

00:25:54.550 --> 00:25:57.030
instrument so you can measure it from
the ground what does were not very easy

00:25:57.030 --> 00:25:57.040
the ground what does were not very easy
 

00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:59.040
the ground what does were not very easy
experiments if you want to measure it in

00:25:59.040 --> 00:25:59.050
experiments if you want to measure it in
 

00:25:59.050 --> 00:26:01.380
experiments if you want to measure it in
the morning what you have to do get up

00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:01.390
the morning what you have to do get up
 

00:26:01.390 --> 00:26:04.230
the morning what you have to do get up
early have breakfast and do what over

00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:04.240
early have breakfast and do what over
 

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:06.870
early have breakfast and do what over
Antarctica you have to spend the night

00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:06.880
Antarctica you have to spend the night
 

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:10.170
Antarctica you have to spend the night
there and that's several months okay

00:26:10.170 --> 00:26:10.180
there and that's several months okay
 

00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:11.640
there and that's several months okay
three or four months

00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:11.650
three or four months
 

00:26:11.650 --> 00:26:14.310
three or four months
so if spend the night then you were up

00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:14.320
so if spend the night then you were up
 

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:16.320
so if spend the night then you were up
to suddenly have time for breakfast but

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:16.330
to suddenly have time for breakfast but
 

00:26:16.330 --> 00:26:18.360
to suddenly have time for breakfast but
then you start measuring and the first

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:18.370
then you start measuring and the first
 

00:26:18.370 --> 00:26:20.280
then you start measuring and the first
few weeks that's when the ozone hole

few weeks that's when the ozone hole
 

00:26:20.290 --> 00:26:23.100
few weeks that's when the ozone hole
appeared and it turns out that then

00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:23.110
appeared and it turns out that then
 

00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:24.690
appeared and it turns out that then
later to make sure that we understood

00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:24.700
later to make sure that we understood
 

00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:27.540
later to make sure that we understood
what was happening you could measure it

00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:27.550
what was happening you could measure it
 

00:26:27.550 --> 00:26:30.870
what was happening you could measure it
with an airplane the airplane could not

00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:30.880
with an airplane the airplane could not
 

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:32.700
with an airplane the airplane could not
take off from Antarctica because there

00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:32.710
take off from Antarctica because there
 

00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:35.400
take off from Antarctica because there
are no good Airport there so it took off

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:35.410
are no good Airport there so it took off
 

00:26:35.410 --> 00:26:37.980
are no good Airport there so it took off
from Punta Arenas which is the southern

00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:37.990
from Punta Arenas which is the southern
 

00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:41.580
from Punta Arenas which is the southern
tip of Chile in South America and the

00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:41.590
tip of Chile in South America and the
 

00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:43.890
tip of Chile in South America and the
airplane I mentioned that because sort

00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:43.900
airplane I mentioned that because sort
 

00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:46.830
airplane I mentioned that because sort

airplane poor you have only one pilot
 

00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:51.600
airplane poor you have only one pilot
but it's designed to fly at very high

but it's designed to fly at very high
 

00:26:51.610 --> 00:26:54.800
but it's designed to fly at very high
altitudes but it was not designed for us

scientists it was the plane that was

00:26:57.900 --> 00:26:57.910
scientists it was the plane that was
 

00:26:57.910 --> 00:27:02.010
scientists it was the plane that was
designed to spy over Russia okay and one

time I the pilot was trapped in Russia

00:27:06.570 --> 00:27:06.580
time I the pilot was trapped in Russia
 

00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:08.880

it was a big scandal but that was what

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:08.890
it was a big scandal but that was what
 

00:27:08.890 --> 00:27:11.340
it was a big scandal but that was what
the Soviet Union was there so we used

00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:11.350
the Soviet Union was there so we used
 

00:27:11.350 --> 00:27:14.790
the Soviet Union was there so we used
the same airplane used to spy over

00:27:14.790 --> 00:27:14.800
the same airplane used to spy over
 

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:18.840
the same airplane used to spy over
Russia to spy over Antarctica and it

00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:18.850
Russia to spy over Antarctica and it
 

00:27:18.850 --> 00:27:22.620
Russia to spy over Antarctica and it
worked extremely well one pilot all

00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:22.630
worked extremely well one pilot all
 

00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:24.030
worked extremely well one pilot all
sorts of instruments that had to

00:27:24.030 --> 00:27:24.040
sorts of instruments that had to
 

00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:26.880
sorts of instruments that had to
function on the road and it became very

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:26.890
function on the road and it became very
 

00:27:26.890 --> 00:27:29.040
function on the road and it became very
very clear from those measurements that

00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:29.050
very clear from those measurements that
 

00:27:29.050 --> 00:27:31.350

people was indeed the CFCs that were
 

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:34.140
people was indeed the CFCs that were
causing the the ozone hole but it's all

00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:34.150
causing the the ozone hole but it's all
 

00:27:34.150 --> 00:27:35.820
causing the the ozone hole but it's all
based on measurements okay that's the

a lot of science at MIT having a group
of students doing research and we

00:29:16.970 --> 00:29:16.980
of students doing research and we
 

00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:19.070
of students doing research and we
learned a lot first of all the

00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:19.080
learned a lot first of all the

hole and so on but then we switch to air

00:29:24.170 --> 00:29:24.180
hole and so on but then we switch to air
 

00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:26.240
hole and so on but then we switch to air
quality and we'll be lost on air quality

00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:26.250
quality and we'll be lost on air quality
 

00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:30.140
quality and we'll be lost on air quality
stories for example in Mexico City we

00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:30.150
stories for example in Mexico City we
 

00:29:30.150 --> 00:29:32.690
stories for example in Mexico City we
work at a Mexican city was the most

00:29:32.690 --> 00:29:32.700
work at a Mexican city was the most
 

00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:34.760
work at a Mexican city was the most
polluted city in the planet for a while

00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:34.770
polluted city in the planet for a while
 

00:29:34.770 --> 00:29:37.940
polluted city in the planet for a while
but then we were able with with MIT help

00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:37.950
but then we were able with with MIT help
 

00:29:37.950 --> 00:29:39.500
but then we were able with with MIT help
and with him working with the Mexican

00:29:39.500 --> 00:29:39.510
and with him working with the Mexican
 

00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:43.010
and with him working with the Mexican
government to improve that quite

00:29:43.010 --> 00:29:43.020
government to improve that quite
 

00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:45.170
government to improve that quite
dramatically just like Los Angeles okay

00:29:45.170 --> 00:29:45.180
dramatically just like Los Angeles okay
 

00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:49.310
dramatically just like Los Angeles okay
but later I'm after getting the Nobel

00:29:49.310 --> 00:29:49.320
but later I'm after getting the Nobel
 

00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:51.440
but later I'm after getting the Nobel
Prize I decided I had to change somewhat

00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:51.450
Prize I decided I had to change somewhat
 

00:29:51.450 --> 00:29:53.450
Prize I decided I had to change somewhat
because you get this responsibility that

00:29:53.450 --> 00:29:53.460
because you get this responsibility that
 

00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:56.720
because you get this responsibility that
you realize you can access people at

00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:56.730
you realize you can access people at
 

00:29:56.730 --> 00:30:00.740
you realize you can access people at
higher levels so I decided to have this

00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:00.750
higher levels so I decided to have this
 

00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:05.090
higher levels so I decided to have this
story Center in Mexico in which we would

00:30:05.090 --> 00:30:05.100
story Center in Mexico in which we would
 

00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:08.030
story Center in Mexico in which we would
do more science policy projects and

00:30:08.030 --> 00:30:08.040
do more science policy projects and
 

00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:09.560
do more science policy projects and
that's the sort of thing I've been doing

00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:09.570
that's the sort of thing I've been doing
 

00:30:09.570 --> 00:30:12.950
that's the sort of thing I've been doing
in Mexico with energy issues as well as

00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:12.960
in Mexico with energy issues as well as
 

00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:14.870
in Mexico with energy issues as well as
environmental issues air quality but

00:30:14.870 --> 00:30:14.880
environmental issues air quality but
 

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:17.090
environmental issues air quality but
also climate change Mexico was sort of a

00:30:17.090 --> 00:30:17.100
also climate change Mexico was sort of a
 

00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:20.000
also climate change Mexico was sort of a
leader among developing countries in

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:20.010

setting up the something like the Paris

00:30:22.670 --> 00:30:22.680
setting up the something like the Paris
 

00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:23.690
setting up the something like the Paris
agreement okay

00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:23.700
agreement okay
 

00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:25.760

I'm more involved with collaborating

00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:30.570
I'm more involved with collaborating
 

00:30:30.570 --> 00:30:32.600
I'm more involved with collaborating
with my research colleagues finding out

00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:32.610
with my research colleagues finding out
 

00:30:32.610 --> 00:30:36.290
with my research colleagues finding out
that how particles that come out of the

that how particles that come out of the
 

00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:39.770
that how particles that come out of the
ocean form you know particles and also

00:30:39.770 --> 00:30:39.780
ocean form you know particles and also
 

00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:43.190
ocean form you know particles and also
are the two things that that you're

00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:43.200
are the two things that that you're
 

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:45.920
are the two things that that you're
going to have with poor air quality so

00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:45.930
going to have with poor air quality so
 

00:30:45.930 --> 00:30:47.600

very closely so that the Paris agreement
 

00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:44.070

in the winter months when it's dark and
 

00:33:07.390 --> 00:33:10.350
in the winter months when it's dark and
it gets very cold because you don't

it gets very cold because you don't
 

00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:13.320
it gets very cold because you don't
because that air is not mixed with air

00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:19.900
to like mines come like three questions
in one but like okay so basically I

00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:19.910
in one but like okay so basically I
 

00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:22.569
in one but like okay so basically I
wanted to know like how did you like how

00:35:22.569 --> 00:35:22.579
wanted to know like how did you like how
 

00:35:22.579 --> 00:35:24.700
wanted to know like how did you like how
do you pick research like how do you

00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:24.710
do you pick research like how do you
 

00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:27.099
do you pick research like how do you
pick a topic to research research off of

00:35:27.099 --> 00:35:27.109
pick a topic to research research off of
 

00:35:27.109 --> 00:35:30.849
pick a topic to research research off of
and then like what advice do you give us

00:35:30.849 --> 00:35:30.859
and then like what advice do you give us
 

00:35:30.859 --> 00:35:33.790
and then like what advice do you give us
give to us youth on picking activities

00:35:33.790 --> 00:35:33.800
give to us youth on picking activities
 

00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:36.520
give to us youth on picking activities
and stuff like that to research on yes

00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:36.530
and stuff like that to research on yes
 

00:35:36.530 --> 00:35:39.490
and stuff like that to research on yes
you have to look around if your students

00:35:39.490 --> 00:35:39.500
you have to look around if your students
 

00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:41.380
you have to look around if your students
say first you have to choose what to

00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:41.390
say first you have to choose what to
 

00:35:41.390 --> 00:35:42.450

you can go to college and in the first

00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:51.710
you can go to college and in the first
 

00:35:51.710 --> 00:35:52.450
you can go to college and in the first
few years

00:35:52.450 --> 00:35:52.460
few years
 

00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:54.160
few years
you take subject in many different

00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:54.170
you take subject in many different
 

00:35:54.170 --> 00:35:57.400
you take subject in many different
topics and so you don't really have to

00:35:57.400 --> 00:35:57.410
topics and so you don't really have to
 

00:35:57.410 --> 00:36:00.339
topics and so you don't really have to
choose as you enter college what you're

00:36:00.339 --> 00:36:00.349
choose as you enter college what you're
 

00:36:00.349 --> 00:36:03.280
choose as you enter college what you're
going to do because you take some

00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:03.290
going to do because you take some
 

00:36:03.290 --> 00:36:05.670
going to do because you take some
sciences but you can also take some

00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:05.680
sciences but you can also take some
 

00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:08.460
sciences but you can also take some
social science courses and even some

00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:08.470
social science courses and even some
 

00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:11.319
social science courses and even some
literature or what have you so you have

00:36:11.319 --> 00:36:11.329
literature or what have you so you have
 

00:36:11.329 --> 00:36:14.349
literature or what have you so you have
more time to choose but keep looking for

00:36:14.349 --> 00:36:14.359
more time to choose but keep looking for
 

00:36:14.359 --> 00:36:16.680
more time to choose but keep looking for
the sort of things that you like and

advice I have is try to find the sort of

00:36:30.819 --> 00:36:30.829
advice I have is try to find the sort of
 

00:36:30.829 --> 00:36:35.770
advice I have is try to find the sort of
things you like and then find out what's

00:36:35.770 --> 00:36:35.780
things you like and then find out what's
 

00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:38.950
things you like and then find out what's
new what sort of challenges are in there

00:36:38.950 --> 00:36:38.960
new what sort of challenges are in there
 

00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:41.890
new what sort of challenges are in there
in that field but once you start doing

00:36:41.890 --> 00:36:41.900
in that field but once you start doing
 

00:36:41.900 --> 00:36:45.339
in that field but once you start doing
research make sure that what you can try

00:36:45.339 --> 00:36:45.349
research make sure that what you can try
 

00:36:45.349 --> 00:36:47.620
research make sure that what you can try
you can try something if you don't like

00:36:47.620 --> 00:36:47.630
you can try something if you don't like
 

00:36:47.630 --> 00:36:49.180
you can try something if you don't like
it try something else it's okay to

00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:49.190
it try something else it's okay to
 

00:36:49.190 --> 00:36:52.450
it try something else it's okay to
change but find the sort of things that

00:36:52.450 --> 00:36:52.460
change but find the sort of things that

okay because then you're going to become

00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:09.440
okay because then you're going to become
 

00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:12.039
okay because then you're going to become
very good at it but it has to be

00:37:12.039 --> 00:37:12.049
very good at it but it has to be
 

00:37:12.049 --> 00:37:13.839
very good at it but it has to be
something that you like and be flexible

that when we first started worrying

00:38:17.059 --> 00:38:17.069
that when we first started worrying
 

00:38:17.069 --> 00:38:19.609
that when we first started worrying
about it it wasn't there and it sort of

00:38:19.609 --> 00:38:19.619
about it it wasn't there and it sort of
 

00:38:19.619 --> 00:38:23.029
about it it wasn't there and it sort of
suddenly appeared and what's happening

00:38:23.029 --> 00:38:23.039
suddenly appeared and what's happening
 

00:38:23.039 --> 00:38:27.259
suddenly appeared and what's happening
now is that because we still have a lot

00:38:27.259 --> 00:38:27.269
now is that because we still have a lot
 

00:38:27.269 --> 00:38:29.989
now is that because we still have a lot
of CFCs that were emitted last century

00:38:29.989 --> 00:38:29.999
of CFCs that were emitted last century
 

00:38:29.999 --> 00:38:32.839
of CFCs that were emitted last century
it their concentration is only slowly

00:38:32.839 --> 00:38:32.849
it their concentration is only slowly
 

00:38:32.849 --> 00:38:36.589
it their concentration is only slowly
decreasing and it's now at scuse me at

00:38:36.589 --> 00:38:36.599
decreasing and it's now at scuse me at
 

00:38:36.599 --> 00:38:39.289
decreasing and it's now at scuse me at
the stage where some years you can see

00:38:39.289 --> 00:38:39.299
the stage where some years you can see
 

00:38:39.299 --> 00:38:40.819
the stage where some years you can see
that the ozone hole is no longer there

00:38:40.819 --> 00:38:40.829
that the ozone hole is no longer there
 

00:38:40.829 --> 00:38:43.279
that the ozone hole is no longer there
and some other still comes up because

00:38:43.279 --> 00:38:43.289
and some other still comes up because
 

00:38:43.289 --> 00:38:45.620
and some other still comes up because
you have a lot of fluctuations but there

00:38:45.620 --> 00:38:45.630
you have a lot of fluctuations but there
 

00:38:45.630 --> 00:38:48.319
you have a lot of fluctuations but there
are clear indications that it's no

00:38:48.319 --> 00:38:48.329
are clear indications that it's no
 

00:38:48.329 --> 00:38:50.630
are clear indications that it's no
longer as stable as it has been for the

longer as stable as it has been for the
 

00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:54.049
longer as stable as it has been for the
last decade or two okay so that means

00:38:54.049 --> 00:38:54.059
last decade or two okay so that means
 

00:38:54.059 --> 00:38:55.819
last decade or two okay so that means
that something is happening and of

00:38:55.819 --> 00:38:55.829
that something is happening and of
 

00:38:55.829 --> 00:38:58.460
that something is happening and of
course we know that the concentration of

00:38:58.460 --> 00:38:58.470
course we know that the concentration of
 

00:38:58.470 --> 00:39:02.420
course we know that the concentration of
the CFCs has gone down as expected they

the CFCs has gone down as expected they
 

00:39:02.430 --> 00:39:04.700
the CFCs has gone down as expected they
have not it hasn't gone down to zero

00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:04.710
have not it hasn't gone down to zero
 

00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:07.220
have not it hasn't gone down to zero
because of this long lifetime but it has

molecular oxygen that's how you get a

00:39:26.749 --> 00:39:26.759
molecular oxygen that's how you get a
 

00:39:26.759 --> 00:39:28.849
molecular oxygen that's how you get a
Tomic oxygen and that's how you make

00:39:28.849 --> 00:39:28.859
Tomic oxygen and that's how you make
 

00:39:28.859 --> 00:39:34.819
Tomic oxygen and that's how you make
also okay so in in a nutshell you have

00:39:34.819 --> 00:39:34.829
also okay so in in a nutshell you have
 

00:39:34.829 --> 00:39:38.079
also okay so in in a nutshell you have
to admit that there are all sorts of

00:39:38.079 --> 00:39:38.089
to admit that there are all sorts of
 

00:39:38.089 --> 00:39:41.450
to admit that there are all sorts of
changes from year to year changes have

00:39:41.450 --> 00:39:41.460
changes from year to year changes have
 

00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:43.579
changes from year to year changes have
to do with the climate that it doesn't

00:39:43.579 --> 00:39:43.589
to do with the climate that it doesn't
 

00:39:43.589 --> 00:39:44.420
to do with the climate that it doesn't
change smoothly

00:39:44.420 --> 00:39:44.430
change smoothly
 

00:39:44.430 --> 00:39:47.089
change smoothly
but considering those changes the

00:39:47.089 --> 00:39:47.099
but considering those changes the
 

00:39:47.099 --> 00:39:50.089
but considering those changes the
observations very clearly indicate that

00:39:50.089 --> 00:39:50.099
observations very clearly indicate that
 

00:39:50.099 --> 00:39:53.989
observations very clearly indicate that
it is already healing and we need to

00:39:53.989 --> 00:39:53.999
it is already healing and we need to
 

00:39:53.999 --> 00:39:57.529
it is already healing and we need to
probably wait another decade or two

00:39:57.529 --> 00:39:57.539
probably wait another decade or two
 

00:39:57.539 --> 00:40:00.979
probably wait another decade or two
before you see a really very big change

00:40:00.979 --> 00:40:00.989
before you see a really very big change
 

00:40:00.989 --> 00:40:03.589
before you see a really very big change
and it's going back to normal

00:40:03.589 --> 00:40:03.599
and it's going back to normal
 

00:40:03.599 --> 00:40:06.319
and it's going back to normal
with there are some caveats I just

00:40:06.319 --> 00:40:06.329
with there are some caveats I just
 

00:40:06.329 --> 00:40:08.870
with there are some caveats I just
mentioned one climate change the fact

00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:08.880
mentioned one climate change the fact
 

00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:09.660
mentioned one climate change the fact
you you

00:40:09.660 --> 00:40:09.670
you you
 

00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:11.039
you you
changing the composition of the

00:40:11.039 --> 00:40:11.049
changing the composition of the
 

00:40:11.049 --> 00:40:12.960
changing the composition of the
atmosphere that means that you're

00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:12.970
atmosphere that means that you're
 

00:40:12.970 --> 00:40:15.059
atmosphere that means that you're
changing the climate so it's actually

00:40:15.059 --> 00:40:15.069
changing the climate so it's actually
 

00:40:15.069 --> 00:40:16.650
changing the climate so it's actually
getting warmer down here but it's

00:40:16.650 --> 00:40:16.660
getting warmer down here but it's
 

00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:18.779
getting warmer down here but it's
getting colder in the stratosphere

00:40:18.779 --> 00:40:18.789
getting colder in the stratosphere
 

00:40:18.789 --> 00:40:21.839
getting colder in the stratosphere
that's what you would expect if you do

00:40:21.839 --> 00:40:21.849
that's what you would expect if you do
 

00:40:21.849 --> 00:40:24.569
that's what you would expect if you do
the energy balances and that means that

00:40:24.569 --> 00:40:24.579
the energy balances and that means that
 

00:40:24.579 --> 00:40:26.849
the energy balances and that means that
you're going to be lay the covering of

00:40:26.849 --> 00:40:26.859
you're going to be lay the covering of
 

00:40:26.859 --> 00:40:30.299
you're going to be lay the covering of
the ozone layer because of climate

00:40:30.299 --> 00:40:30.309
the ozone layer because of climate
 

00:40:30.309 --> 00:40:33.750

change how much it depends of whether we

00:40:33.750 --> 00:40:33.760
change how much it depends of whether we
 

00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:37.769
change how much it depends of whether we
tackle the the emission of carbon

00:40:37.769 --> 00:40:37.779
tackle the the emission of carbon
 

00:40:37.779 --> 00:40:39.569

wanted to know how exactly the CFC is
affected the ozone layer so what how

00:40:55.769 --> 00:40:55.779
affected the ozone layer so what how
 

00:40:55.779 --> 00:40:58.950
affected the ozone layer so what how
exactly did CFCs ozone okay

dramatically that's why it was a very

00:42:11.609 --> 00:42:11.619
dramatically that's why it was a very
 

00:42:11.619 --> 00:42:16.019
dramatically that's why it was a very
big success to find chemicals that you

00:42:16.019 --> 00:42:16.029
big success to find chemicals that you
 

00:42:16.029 --> 00:42:18.150
big success to find chemicals that you
could use instead of these nasty

00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:18.160
could use instead of these nasty
 

00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:22.410
could use instead of these nasty
chemicals and one proof that they work

00:42:22.410 --> 00:42:22.420
chemicals and one proof that they work
 

00:42:22.420 --> 00:42:23.520
chemicals and one proof that they work
is that you could

00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:23.530
is that you could
 

00:42:23.530 --> 00:42:26.940
is that you could
use them also in spray cans imagine

00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:26.950
use them also in spray cans imagine
 

00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:31.230
use them also in spray cans imagine
using a spray can with ammonia you I

00:42:31.230 --> 00:42:31.240
using a spray can with ammonia you I
 

00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:33.540
using a spray can with ammonia you I
mean you just couldn't think of that

00:42:33.540 --> 00:42:33.550
mean you just couldn't think of that
 

00:42:33.550 --> 00:42:35.910
mean you just couldn't think of that
okay so spray cans only became available

00:42:35.910 --> 00:42:35.920
okay so spray cans only became available
 

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:38.700
okay so spray cans only became available
they were used with hydrocarbons to some

00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:38.710
they were used with hydrocarbons to some
 

00:42:38.710 --> 00:42:42.030
they were used with hydrocarbons to some
extent but they became readily available

chlorofluorocarbons or CFCs were
 

00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:49.530
chlorofluorocarbons or CFCs were
invented and that's why they were used

00:42:49.530 --> 00:42:49.540
invented and that's why they were used
 

00:42:49.540 --> 00:42:50.880

worry about them

00:43:00.630 --> 00:43:00.640
worry about them
 

00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:03.120
worry about them
yeah because mixed in the entire

chemicals that you can breathe why worry

00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:13.690
chemicals that you can breathe why worry
 

00:43:13.690 --> 00:43:16.620
chemicals that you can breathe why worry
but that's why we decided to find out

00:43:16.620 --> 00:43:16.630
but that's why we decided to find out
 

00:43:16.630 --> 00:43:19.920
but that's why we decided to find out
where will they be destroyed and with

00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:19.930
where will they be destroyed and with
 

00:43:19.930 --> 00:43:22.110
where will they be destroyed and with
something else happened so we found out

00:43:22.110 --> 00:43:22.120
something else happened so we found out
 

00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:23.490
something else happened so we found out
they would be destroyed at high

00:43:23.490 --> 00:43:23.500
they would be destroyed at high
 

00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:26.420
they would be destroyed at high
altitudes just like oxygen itself when

00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:26.430
altitudes just like oxygen itself when
 

00:43:26.430 --> 00:43:29.820

if you move enough above the normal

00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:29.830
if you move enough above the normal
 

00:43:29.830 --> 00:43:32.070
if you move enough above the normal
atmosphere then you get this very short

00:43:32.070 --> 00:43:32.080
atmosphere then you get this very short
 

00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:33.630
atmosphere then you get this very short
wavelength radiation that breaks

00:43:33.630 --> 00:43:33.640
wavelength radiation that breaks
 

00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:36.390
wavelength radiation that breaks
everything eventually you can even break

00:43:36.390 --> 00:43:36.400
everything eventually you can even break
 

00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:39.240
everything eventually you can even break
atoms okay and ionize them but you break

00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:39.250
atoms okay and ionize them but you break
 

00:43:39.250 --> 00:43:42.690
atoms okay and ionize them but you break
molecules long before that and you can

00:43:42.690 --> 00:43:42.700
molecules long before that and you can
 

00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:45.090
molecules long before that and you can
break the oxygen molecule and that's how

00:43:45.090 --> 00:43:45.100
break the oxygen molecule and that's how
 

00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:47.580
break the oxygen molecule and that's how
awesome is made and the same wavelengths

00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:47.590
awesome is made and the same wavelengths
 

00:43:47.590 --> 00:43:50.670
awesome is made and the same wavelengths
break the CFC molecule so that's what we

00:43:50.670 --> 00:43:50.680
break the CFC molecule so that's what we
 

00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:53.370
break the CFC molecule so that's what we
found but then we went further what

00:43:53.370 --> 00:43:53.380
found but then we went further what
 

00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:55.950
found but then we went further what

that's how we came about this idea that
 

00:45:01.810 --> 00:45:04.230
that's how we came about this idea that
that the ozone layer was gonna be

that the ozone layer was gonna be
 

00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:06.360
that the ozone layer was gonna be
affected and that was indeed what came

00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:06.370
affected and that was indeed what came
 

00:45:06.370 --> 00:45:10.170
affected and that was indeed what came
out from measurements so that's the idea

00:45:10.170 --> 00:45:10.180
out from measurements so that's the idea
 

00:45:10.180 --> 00:45:12.860

hemisphere Australians were very worried

00:46:21.870 --> 00:46:21.880
hemisphere Australians were very worried
 

00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:25.830
hemisphere Australians were very worried
about that and I you know something

00:46:25.830 --> 00:46:25.840
about that and I you know something
 

00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:27.830
about that and I you know something
changed in Australia because they

00:46:27.830 --> 00:46:27.840
changed in Australia because they
 

00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:30.810
changed in Australia because they
weren't people that they could not be

00:46:30.810 --> 00:46:30.820
weren't people that they could not be
 

00:46:30.820 --> 00:46:34.020
weren't people that they could not be

exposed to the Sun without worrying
 

00:46:34.030 --> 00:46:36.150
exposed to the Sun without worrying
about it so the Australians were to use

00:46:36.150 --> 00:46:36.160
about it so the Australians were to use
 

00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:37.920
about it so the Australians were to use
hats when they go to the beach and

00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:37.930
hats when they go to the beach and
 

00:46:37.930 --> 00:46:40.530

clothes that were not transparent to
 

00:46:40.540 --> 00:46:42.690
clothes that were not transparent to
ultraviolet so the Australians did

00:46:42.690 --> 00:46:42.700
ultraviolet so the Australians did
 

00:46:42.700 --> 00:46:45.390
ultraviolet so the Australians did
change because the incidence of skin

00:46:45.390 --> 00:46:45.400
change because the incidence of skin
 

00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:50.460
change because the incidence of skin
cancer was changing but I'm I'm most at

00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:50.470
cancer was changing but I'm I'm most at

it's quite interesting what I'll be very
fast you know that people with dark skin

00:46:58.880 --> 00:46:58.890
fast you know that people with dark skin
 

00:46:58.890 --> 00:47:02.910
fast you know that people with dark skin
they evolve mostly closer to the tropics

00:47:02.910 --> 00:47:02.920
they evolve mostly closer to the tropics

and people with very light skin at much
 

00:47:06.460 --> 00:47:10.890
and people with very light skin at much
higher latitudes why well because close

00:47:10.890 --> 00:47:10.900
higher latitudes why well because close
 

00:47:10.900 --> 00:47:12.960

there you know where they came from

00:47:33.750 --> 00:47:33.760
there you know where they came from
 

00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:36.180
there you know where they came from
mostly from England ok so you have these

00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:23.650
and I have bad news the bad news is I
 

00:48:23.650 --> 00:48:26.309
and I have bad news the bad news is I
can only take one more question but the

00:48:26.309 --> 00:48:26.319
can only take one more question but the
 

00:48:26.319 --> 00:48:28.440
can only take one more question but the
good news is that after this I need

00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:28.450
good news is that after this I need
 

00:48:28.450 --> 00:48:29.670
good news is that after this I need
everyone to come down through those

00:48:29.670 --> 00:48:29.680
everyone to come down through those
 

00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:34.450
everyone to come down through those
steps because we have 3m goody bags

00:48:34.450 --> 00:48:34.460
 
 

00:48:34.460 --> 00:48:38.869
 
[Laughter]

00:48:38.869 --> 00:48:38.879
 
 

00:48:38.879 --> 00:48:43.279
 
so we can ask the last question now I

00:48:43.279 --> 00:48:43.289
so we can ask the last question now I
 

00:48:43.289 --> 00:48:45.089
so we can ask the last question now I
want to give it to one other person

00:48:45.089 --> 00:48:45.099
want to give it to one other person
 

00:48:45.099 --> 00:48:48.659
want to give it to one other person
after I'm done doing it I hope I could

00:48:48.659 --> 00:48:48.669
after I'm done doing it I hope I could
 

00:48:48.669 --> 00:48:52.049
after I'm done doing it I hope I could
fit this question in between that yeah

00:48:52.049 --> 00:48:52.059
fit this question in between that yeah
 

00:48:52.059 --> 00:48:55.649
fit this question in between that yeah
my question is uh like you know how the

00:48:55.649 --> 00:48:55.659
my question is uh like you know how the
 

00:48:55.659 --> 00:48:57.779
my question is uh like you know how the
axis the axis I heard in a science

00:48:57.779 --> 00:48:57.789
axis the axis I heard in a science
 

00:48:57.789 --> 00:49:00.329
axis the axis I heard in a science
lecture that the axis of the earth is

00:49:00.329 --> 00:49:00.339
lecture that the axis of the earth is
 

00:49:00.339 --> 00:49:03.659
lecture that the axis of the earth is
moving kind of like of our planet you

00:49:03.659 --> 00:49:03.669
moving kind of like of our planet you
 

00:49:03.669 --> 00:49:07.469
moving kind of like of our planet you
mean yeah okay and then they're like

00:49:07.469 --> 00:49:07.479
mean yeah okay and then they're like
 

00:49:07.479 --> 00:49:11.039
mean yeah okay and then they're like
related to the Oh

00:49:11.039 --> 00:49:11.049
related to the Oh
 

00:49:11.049 --> 00:49:12.989
related to the Oh
how does that connect the global born

00:49:12.989 --> 00:49:12.999
how does that connect the global born
 

00:49:12.999 --> 00:49:15.839
how does that connect the global born
okay let me see if I understood the

00:49:15.839 --> 00:49:15.849
okay let me see if I understood the
 

00:49:15.849 --> 00:49:20.059
okay let me see if I understood the
question but it's a very interesting one

00:49:20.059 --> 00:49:20.069
 
 

00:49:20.069 --> 00:49:23.759
 
the it it's actually the answer to the

00:49:23.759 --> 00:49:23.769
the it it's actually the answer to the
 

00:49:23.769 --> 00:49:28.109
the it it's actually the answer to the
question why do we have ice ages it's

00:49:28.109 --> 00:49:28.119
question why do we have ice ages it's
 

00:49:28.119 --> 00:49:30.569
question why do we have ice ages it's
not connected to global warming

00:49:30.569 --> 00:49:30.579
not connected to global warming
 

00:49:30.579 --> 00:49:34.709
not connected to global warming
very clearly but I'll explain you first

00:49:34.709 --> 00:49:34.719
very clearly but I'll explain you first
 

00:49:34.719 --> 00:49:38.099
very clearly but I'll explain you first
what happens is our planet of course has

00:49:38.099 --> 00:49:38.109
what happens is our planet of course has
 

00:49:38.109 --> 00:49:41.609
what happens is our planet of course has
a tilted axis and it has a p-orbital

00:49:41.609 --> 00:49:41.619
a tilted axis and it has a p-orbital
 

00:49:41.619 --> 00:49:45.659
a tilted axis and it has a p-orbital
around the Sun it's elliptical but if

00:49:45.659 --> 00:49:45.669
around the Sun it's elliptical but if
 

00:49:45.669 --> 00:49:48.629
around the Sun it's elliptical but if
you look in great detail why this

00:49:48.629 --> 00:49:48.639
you look in great detail why this
 

00:49:48.639 --> 00:49:51.839
you look in great detail why this
happens it's influenced by gravity and

00:49:51.839 --> 00:49:51.849
happens it's influenced by gravity and
 

00:49:51.849 --> 00:49:55.049
happens it's influenced by gravity and
by other planets that sometimes come

00:49:55.049 --> 00:49:55.059
by other planets that sometimes come
 

00:49:55.059 --> 00:49:57.149
by other planets that sometimes come
close and so on so it turns out that you

00:49:57.149 --> 00:49:57.159
close and so on so it turns out that you
 

00:49:57.159 --> 00:50:00.449
close and so on so it turns out that you
can calculate that there is what we call

00:50:00.449 --> 00:50:00.459
can calculate that there is what we call
 

00:50:00.459 --> 00:50:02.699
can calculate that there is what we call
periodicities every ten thousand

00:50:02.699 --> 00:50:02.709
periodicities every ten thousand
 

00:50:02.709 --> 00:50:04.439
periodicities every ten thousand
probably ten thousand every forty

00:50:04.439 --> 00:50:04.449
probably ten thousand every forty
 

00:50:04.449 --> 00:50:07.439
probably ten thousand every forty
thousand years the geometrical aspects

00:50:07.439 --> 00:50:07.449
thousand years the geometrical aspects
 

00:50:07.449 --> 00:50:12.419
thousand years the geometrical aspects
change and you get the orbit to change

00:50:12.419 --> 00:50:12.429
change and you get the orbit to change
 

00:50:12.429 --> 00:50:15.029
change and you get the orbit to change
its ellipticity but you get also the

00:50:15.029 --> 00:50:15.039
its ellipticity but you get also the
 

00:50:15.039 --> 00:50:17.009
its ellipticity but you get also the
axis because it's it's it's moving

00:50:17.009 --> 00:50:17.019
axis because it's it's it's moving
 

00:50:17.019 --> 00:50:20.489
axis because it's it's it's moving
around okay and when the axis and they

00:50:20.489 --> 00:50:20.499
around okay and when the axis and they
 

00:50:20.499 --> 00:50:22.919
around okay and when the axis and they
are the orbit changes in certain ways

00:50:22.919 --> 00:50:22.929
are the orbit changes in certain ways
 

00:50:22.929 --> 00:50:26.459
are the orbit changes in certain ways
you get sufficiently less some solar

00:50:26.459 --> 00:50:26.469
you get sufficiently less some solar
 

00:50:26.469 --> 00:50:29.339
you get sufficiently less some solar
radiation directly hitting the planet as

00:50:29.339 --> 00:50:29.349
radiation directly hitting the planet as
 

00:50:29.349 --> 00:50:31.409
radiation directly hitting the planet as
it normally does that you get ice ages

00:50:31.409 --> 00:50:31.419
it normally does that you get ice ages
 

00:50:31.419 --> 00:50:34.139
it normally does that you get ice ages
and how is that tested because you can

00:50:34.139 --> 00:50:34.149
and how is that tested because you can
 

00:50:34.149 --> 00:50:38.359
and how is that tested because you can
calculate from physical laws as

00:50:38.359 --> 00:50:38.369
calculate from physical laws as
 

00:50:38.369 --> 00:50:42.569
calculate from physical laws as
essentially just classical physics how

00:50:42.569 --> 00:50:42.579
essentially just classical physics how
 

00:50:42.579 --> 00:50:45.659
essentially just classical physics how
often should this change and that has

00:50:45.659 --> 00:50:45.669
often should this change and that has
 

00:50:45.669 --> 00:50:47.730
often should this change and that has
been done by planetary science

00:50:47.730 --> 00:50:47.740
been done by planetary science
 

00:50:47.740 --> 00:50:50.160
been done by planetary science
is extremely carefully and the

00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:50.170
is extremely carefully and the
 

00:50:50.170 --> 00:50:52.740
is extremely carefully and the
periodicities coincide very well with

00:50:52.740 --> 00:50:52.750
periodicities coincide very well with
 

00:50:52.750 --> 00:50:57.210
periodicities coincide very well with
those that you measure with with by

00:50:57.210 --> 00:50:57.220
those that you measure with with by
 

00:50:57.220 --> 00:51:00.060
those that you measure with with by
geologists that know exactly when the

00:51:00.060 --> 00:51:00.070
geologists that know exactly when the
 

00:51:00.070 --> 00:51:02.580
geologists that know exactly when the
ice ages came about and so on the

00:51:02.580 --> 00:51:02.590
ice ages came about and so on the
 

00:51:02.590 --> 00:51:04.140
ice ages came about and so on the
interesting thing about that is that

00:51:04.140 --> 00:51:04.150
interesting thing about that is that
 

00:51:04.150 --> 00:51:07.200
interesting thing about that is that
that's not quite enough to explain the

00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:07.210
that's not quite enough to explain the
 

00:51:07.210 --> 00:51:09.330
that's not quite enough to explain the
big climate change but if you have

00:51:09.330 --> 00:51:09.340
big climate change but if you have
 

00:51:09.340 --> 00:51:12.540
big climate change but if you have
feedback from carbon dioxide that if you

00:51:12.540 --> 00:51:12.550
feedback from carbon dioxide that if you
 

00:51:12.550 --> 00:51:14.190
feedback from carbon dioxide that if you
cool a little bit it begins to condense

00:51:14.190 --> 00:51:14.200
cool a little bit it begins to condense
 

00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:16.680
cool a little bit it begins to condense
so you could you pull more and if you

00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:16.690
so you could you pull more and if you
 

00:51:16.690 --> 00:51:19.320
so you could you pull more and if you
warm up then there's more co2 than you

00:51:19.320 --> 00:51:19.330
warm up then there's more co2 than you
 

00:51:19.330 --> 00:51:22.859
warm up then there's more co2 than you
warm up more so that explains the ice

00:51:22.859 --> 00:51:22.869
warm up more so that explains the ice
 

00:51:22.869 --> 00:51:25.830
warm up more so that explains the ice
ages but this all these things happened

00:51:25.830 --> 00:51:25.840
ages but this all these things happened
 

00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:27.060
ages but this all these things happened
very slowly

00:51:27.060 --> 00:51:27.070
very slowly
 

00:51:27.070 --> 00:51:31.230
very slowly
10,000 40,000 years or so so climate

00:51:31.230 --> 00:51:31.240
10,000 40,000 years or so so climate
 

00:51:31.240 --> 00:51:33.030
10,000 40,000 years or so so climate
change that we're looking at it's a

00:51:33.030 --> 00:51:33.040
change that we're looking at it's a
 

00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:36.030
change that we're looking at it's a
matter of few decades okay so all these

00:51:36.030 --> 00:51:36.040
matter of few decades okay so all these
 

00:51:36.040 --> 00:51:40.859
matter of few decades okay so all these
explanations do not function for climate

00:51:40.859 --> 00:51:40.869
explanations do not function for climate
 

00:51:40.869 --> 00:51:45.330
explanations do not function for climate
change so one of the big characteristics

00:51:45.330 --> 00:51:45.340
change so one of the big characteristics
 

00:51:45.340 --> 00:51:46.980
change so one of the big characteristics
of climate change that is very well

00:51:46.980 --> 00:51:46.990
of climate change that is very well
 

00:51:46.990 --> 00:51:48.930
of climate change that is very well
understood and so on is that we're

00:51:48.930 --> 00:51:48.940
understood and so on is that we're
 

00:51:48.940 --> 00:51:51.780
understood and so on is that we're
changing the climate at the speed that

00:51:51.780 --> 00:51:51.790
changing the climate at the speed that
 

00:51:51.790 --> 00:51:54.120
changing the climate at the speed that
is not natural okay it hasn't changed at

00:51:54.120 --> 00:51:54.130
is not natural okay it hasn't changed at
 

00:51:54.130 --> 00:51:57.690
is not natural okay it hasn't changed at
first in geological large geological

00:51:57.690 --> 00:51:57.700
first in geological large geological
 

00:51:57.700 --> 00:52:00.840
first in geological large geological
timescales so that's part of the of the

00:52:00.840 --> 00:52:00.850
timescales so that's part of the of the
 

00:52:00.850 --> 00:52:03.870
timescales so that's part of the of the
reason I'm not sure I was answering the

00:52:03.870 --> 00:52:03.880
reason I'm not sure I was answering the
 

00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:06.390
reason I'm not sure I was answering the
same questions you are asking but anyhow

00:52:06.390 --> 00:52:06.400
same questions you are asking but anyhow
 

00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:09.240
same questions you are asking but anyhow
it's a very interesting point I hope

00:52:09.240 --> 00:52:09.250
it's a very interesting point I hope
 

00:52:09.250 --> 00:52:10.890
it's a very interesting point I hope
that's what you were asking about it

00:52:10.890 --> 00:52:10.900
that's what you were asking about it
 

00:52:10.900 --> 00:52:13.650
that's what you were asking about it
it's the geometry of the of the orbits

00:52:13.650 --> 00:52:13.660
it's the geometry of the of the orbits
 

00:52:13.660 --> 00:52:15.450
it's the geometry of the of the orbits
all right so as I said that does

00:52:15.450 --> 00:52:15.460
all right so as I said that does
 

00:52:15.460 --> 00:52:17.460
all right so as I said that does
conclude our night thank you all for

00:52:17.460 --> 00:52:17.470
conclude our night thank you all for
 

00:52:17.470 --> 00:52:17.870
