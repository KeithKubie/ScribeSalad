00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:06.210
 Do you know that bees are talking to each other outside? 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.850
 Bees swing and dance to share information about the location 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:15.350
 Distance to nearby attractions. Suppose you are trapped in a beehive, and 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:20.360
 The friendly and busy bees in your hive go out for food. On her journey she found a flower 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.110
 Powdered pollen. She turned back to tell you where the rest of the hive is. 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.119
 How to tell? Distance and direction, my friend. 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:33.800
 She wobbled and swayed when she walked in. It was really fast. 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.230
 This line. When she reached the end, she turned to the left and returned to the circle 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.730
 The beginning. I wobbled again, now I turn to the right, back to the beginning, swing again, turn around 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:50.730
 Go to the left... Did you know? Are we really? Need to mix like the entire electronic bee dance? 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.120
 What's really cool is that its length varies from swing to swing. 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:03.120
 This way is completely related to the distance traveled by the bees. The closer the destination, the shorter the swing. 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:09.859
 In fact, every second has a wave of running, the bee tells you to travel 1 km. and so, 

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:14.499
 What, we have kilometers, miles, and bees have rickety swings? 

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:21.499
 Ok, 1 km, ready! But where are you going? Like a compass, up is a comparison of bees 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.929
 Reference, that is, the sun. Upward means toward the sun. The angle of the swing operation tells us 

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:33.569
 On the way, you can keep the sun above you. Combine this angle with your distance, 

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:37.659
 You are ready now! Other information may actually be hidden here 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:43.289
 "Shake the 'rotate' routine, just like familiar: experienced bees may pay special attention 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:47.590
 The dancers who came to the smell of familiar flowers came down 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:53.419
 Or maybe itâ€™s dangerous, the dancers are hovering around the destination, doing less swing around 

00:01:53.419 --> 00:01:57.049
 It is a dangerous goal. If we compare other bees in other parts 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:02.310
 In the world, we even found the possibility of swinging dialects and social learning. 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:08.610
 The bee can accept a lot of things. Click on the buzz to talk about animal communication, and
