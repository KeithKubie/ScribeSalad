The Differences Between Us

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:09.720
I go through life thinking that there's a right way to do things and a wrong way to do things,

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:16.040
and, uh, there's isn't a whole lot of room for subjectivity from my perspective.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:23.860
I've always been...kind of a person that...there is a gray area, and that like if things aren't black or white, that's okay.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:31.260
Zack and I are, right now, in different places as far as intimacy; we want intimacy at different times,

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:40.120
uh, you know, at different, sort of, intensities of intimacy, um, and everything from cuddling to sex.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:47.320
I like getting up, like, super early, and I have the most energy when I wake up, and I'm like,

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:54.360
the most intimate feeling, for lack of better words

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.780
in the morning, um, so, and that's hard 'cause John doesn't want to get up until God knows when,

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.380
um, so then if I try to wake him up, it's just going to be a bad situation,

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:13.340
and, on vice versa it's the same thing, like John is, uh, feels very intimate at night and

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.880
I want to sleep at night and get a good rest so I can get up at six o'clock, you know, as i do.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.140
I'm like a volcano, I erupt.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.260
And when I erupt,

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:29.240
I...want to immediately deal with the situation,

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.960
and Tim is...the ostrich, with his head in the sand...

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:43.660
I worry that my pace...will... start to affect the way Kate sees me,

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:49.360
that if my productivity doesn't start to, at least, catch up to her's,

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:58.780
that...the weight that she feels dragging behind her, that is me, will start to, uh, take it's toll on her.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.740
I feel like sometimes it's this unnecessary weight being put on the relationship;

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.680
she's part way through talking to me about something and sort of realizes that she's projecting

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:14.040
or transposing stresses in her professional life, or in another relationship,

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:20.040
and wants to fix it by somehow fixing us, or fixing something that's not really a problem.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:26.420
The last little while we've been in a bit of a dynamic, where Cary tends to be the one who gets to say,

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.540
"I want to blow off work today and go do something crazy fun!",

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.120
and I feel like I'm in the position of saying, "No".

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.740
But it's like if we can identify something here and talk it through and fix it,

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:44.360
I know the relation-like, that somehow everything is going to be okay if the relationship's okay.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:50.720
And...that might be true to a certain degree, but sometimes that's not actually about the relationship,

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.700
and we're making things about the relationship...that aren't.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.100
It's really easy with someone else to fall into patterns of behavior,

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:06.880
but if you don't reflect on them and negotiate about them..., I think that they can become stultifying,

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:12.100
and I think that you can find yourself being someone that you're not happy being,

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:18.780
or exhibiting behaviors that you're not really interested in exhibiting, but that's just the vibe you're in.

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.900
Chris had come out of a serious relationship, where someone had been unfaithful to him.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:30.540
Not long after Chris and I, uh...got into a relationship, so I knew this would be something that would emerge.

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.020
What bothers me about Leah is her aversion to conflict...

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:41.480
um...I find that when we're in a situation where conflict might arise,

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.900
rather than going into that situation, she'll try to find a way to navigate around it.

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:53.560
It has come up in situations where I'm hanging out with, uh, a male friend that, um, I had had a history with,

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:59.500
um, but, uh, I hadn't gotten in touch with Chris and obviously he had, uh,

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:06.620
he'd...had very strong feelings, so not just some feelings of jealousy, but uh, really strong reactions-

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.660
you know, "are we going to break up? Is this something..." you know, "What went wrong?"

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:19.460
Um, and then the result of that is: by avoiding conflict I'm-we're driving right into another conflict, which is the aversion.

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:26.740
Lid is more of a free spirit than I am, and my natural inclination when-when it comes to planning a trip

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:36.560
or even, ah....going to an appointment or something like that is always to organize it in my mind.

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:44.680
Well I suspect from Ross it age, where he thinks...much more negative thoughts than I do.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:50.020
Um...I think it's quite a sore point, actually.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.520
And...and at eighty-five I doubt that it's going to be resolved.
