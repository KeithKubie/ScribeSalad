DZOGCHEN PONLOP RINPOCHE:
So good afternoon

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.292
and welcome everyone for
our short discussion here.

00:00:14.292 --> 00:00:15.750
And so first of
all, thank you very

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:23.170
much for having me here at
Google and for your time

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:28.794
to listen more about Googling.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:39.570
And so if you look
at our world today,

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.280
it's changing faster than what
we can get hold of, the things

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.860
that we already have.

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.650
The moment we think we
got hold of something,

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.950
it's already changed for
the next, and the next,

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:56.960
and the next.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:04.040
And so it's moving so fast
that becoming harder and harder

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.510
for our mind to catch up with.

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:14.640
And we have so much information
online, especially on Google,

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:22.290
so that if you think about
the information that we have,

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.890
the amount of
information that we have,

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.250
and the mind that
we experience here,

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.920
who can process
that information,

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.632
there's actually a big
gap between the two--

00:01:35.632 --> 00:01:38.880
the world out there
in the internet

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.450
and the world in general
and the changing pace here

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.620
and the mind that is
trying to catch up

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.820
with this, the whole thing.

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.470
And so at the end,
what we're really

00:01:53.470 --> 00:02:00.580
chasing after in
this high speed--

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.700
I'm not talking about the
internet, but high speed

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.840
mentally and physically-- that
what we are really chasing

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.180
after throughout
the generations,

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:11.800
throughout the
centuries is like-- it

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.030
seems like we're chasing
after some kind of happiness,

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.585
isn't it?

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:28.950
And so that chasing
after happiness is--

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.830
there's nothing wrong with that.

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.260
It's OK.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.160
And we want it to happen
faster and faster.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.310
We want to get to happy faster.

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.240
We want to get happy now.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:49.840
And we want to have instant
happiness like instant noodle

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.640
that we have.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:58.520
Instant gratification that we
are all seeking for actually

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.680
is becoming a big
problem for us.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.810
Because of this
mentality of looking

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:11.650
for instant gratification
and the fast-- or faster

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.900
than our mind can
achieve something

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.960
that we want to achieve-- that
is becoming a problem for us

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:21.570
in terms of achieving
that sense of happiness.

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:26.980
What it actually is doing
is counterproductive.

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.800
It's actually bringing us more
suffering because of that,

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:37.550
because of this sense of speed,
sense of instant gratification

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.190
that we are looking for.

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.480
So anyway, everybody seems to
be talking about happiness.

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.920
In countries like
Bhutan, they talk

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.500
about gross national happiness.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.360
And then, of course,
in Google you

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.690
have a lot of discussions
about happiness

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.530
and who's the happiest
man and so on.

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:07.740
So I think we all agree on
chasing after happiness.

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.080
Anybody disagrees?

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.580
Anybody don't want happiness?

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.190
I was recently talking
to some of my friends.

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:21.060
And one of them told me they
actually don't want happiness.

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.690
So I was a little shocked.

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.090
And I didn't know what to say.

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:29.000
If you think about
how one becomes happy,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:36.750
can you take a moment and
think about how you usually

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.790
experience happiness?

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:43.040
What makes you happy?

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.000
Take a moment and
think about it.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:54.830
What does that happiness look
like when you say happiness?

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.870
We're looking for
something, happiness.

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:58.810
So what is it?

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.230
What do you feel when you
think about happiness?

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:04.310
What is it that
you're looking for?

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:15.370
Is it the next Google phone?

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.540
Another car?

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:21.355
Another friend?

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:31.910
When you think about it,
happiness is actually

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:37.360
something that depends on the
individual mind, isn't it?

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:46.480
What is happiness for me is not
necessarily happiness for you.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:52.960
What is happiness for you is not
necessarily happiness for me.

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.280
And so we all think we're
looking for the same thing

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:56.450
called happiness.

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:59.710
But actually, we're not sure
what we're talking about.

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:00.720
What is this happiness?

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:05.420
What is this happiness
we're looking for?

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:14.350
But at the end, it really
depends on your own mind state,

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:15.490
doesn't it?

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:20.690
Whether you can be happy or
not depends on your mind state.

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:29.550
It's not dependent on the
outer environment, gadgets,

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:34.570
material wealth, even friends.

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:36.940
It's not really that.

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:40.100
At the end, it's
really something

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.970
we are talking about-- what
we're really talking about here

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:44.590
is a state of mind.

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:48.220
Happiness is a state of mind.

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:53.100
Since it is a state of mind,
it is your individual state

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:54.150
of mind, isn't it?

00:06:56.910 --> 00:07:02.180
It cannot be a
national state of mind.

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:06.080
Fortunately or unfortunately, we
can't have that national state

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:06.627
of mind.

00:07:06.627 --> 00:07:08.210
That's kind of scary,
isn't it, if you

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:12.000
have a national state of mind?

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.430
It's an individual
state of mind.

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:19.460
And so it really depends
on individual mind.

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:29.260
And so what is
happiness is something

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:34.340
that you have to find it
in your own state of mind.

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:37.500
It's not something that
someone else can give you.

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:41.220
Someone else can
help you to find it.

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:44.420
But at the end, we
are the ones who

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:49.330
have to actually discover that,
to find that in our own mind

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:50.490
state.

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:56.850
And so, therefore, the
key here for achieving

00:07:56.850 --> 00:08:00.710
our goal of happiness,
the key here for us

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:04.790
to achieve the
state of mind that

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:10.760
is capable of achieving anything
we want to achieve in our life

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:12.680
depends on how
healthy your mind is.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.770
Whether we're talking about
in relationship-- relationship

00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:27.130
with our parents, our children,
our partners, co-workers--

00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:29.010
or whether we talk
about in relationship

00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:33.950
with our achievement and
our goal in a mundane life,

00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:35.559
or whether we talk
about achievement

00:08:35.559 --> 00:08:38.590
in your spiritual
journey individually,

00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:43.861
it all really
depends on how well

00:08:43.861 --> 00:08:44.985
we can work with our minds.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:53.060
And so mind is the
important piece here

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:58.030
that we usually miss in
our equation of thinking

00:08:58.030 --> 00:09:02.350
about who we are or what we can
achieve or how we can achieve.

00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:07.960
Usually the mind is
something really ignore.

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:09.840
Isn't that the case?

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:12.630
When we're talking
about getting somewhere,

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:18.610
we always thinking about car,
public transportation, and most

00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:22.590
importantly the Google app.

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:23.910
Maybe we want to get somewhere.

00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:26.700
We're not thinking
about our minds at all.

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:32.730
We're thinking about all these
other things but our mind.

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:38.620
And so therefore, what's the
most important thing here

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:41.350
in terms of achieving anything
we want to achieve here

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:46.160
is to first-- the first
thing we need to do

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:51.215
is we need to
Google what is mind.

00:09:51.215 --> 00:09:54.020
We need to Google what is mind.

00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:56.680
And many times when I give
public talks and stuff like

00:09:56.680 --> 00:10:00.140
that, people ask me, like,
how can I find my teacher?

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:02.450
Or where can I find a guru
or something like that?

00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:03.525
And I say Google it.

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:10.050
And so the first thing
we need to Google

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:11.990
here is we need to
Google our mind.

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:14.170
What is mind?

00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:17.170
What is mind?

00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:23.450
Mind is our most precious
and a valuable resource

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:28.210
that we have through which we
experience every single moment

00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:31.590
of our life with this mind.

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:38.710
And the mind that we
rely upon to be happy--

00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:41.420
when we think about
"I want to be happy,"

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:46.590
we're relying on our
mind to be happy.

00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:50.280
And we're relying on
our mind to be content.

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:56.090
And we're relying on our minds
to be emotionally stable--

00:10:56.090 --> 00:11:01.580
if there are such things,
emotionally stable individuals.

00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:07.150
And at the same time,
to be kind, thoughtful,

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:13.910
considerate in our
relationships with others.

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:24.960
And this is the same mind that
we depend upon to be focused,

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:30.075
to be creative,
to be productive.

00:11:30.075 --> 00:11:33.630
When we want to be productive,
we're talking about, actually,

00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:38.490
our mind, looking at our
mind to be more productive.

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:48.300
And we're looking at our mind
to be spontaneous and perform

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:54.080
at our best, the very
best in everything we do.

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:59.880
But, at the same time,
we don't take time

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:06.120
to look after this
mind at all, do we?

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:07.910
Look, we have 24 hours a day.

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:14.400
Where do you spend
most of your time?

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:18.150
We take care of our body
quite well in general,

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:26.628
especially at the two coasts,
East Coast and the West Coast,

00:12:26.628 --> 00:12:35.970
a lot of Whole Foods,
whole paycheck.

00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:38.980
And we take care of our body.

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:44.380
And we do really take care
of our cars, don't we?

00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:45.520
We take care of our cars.

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:50.250
And we make sure we take it
to the what do you call that?

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:51.059
AUDIENCE: Mechanic?

00:12:51.059 --> 00:12:52.350
DZOGCHEN PONLOP RINPOCHE: Yeah.

00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:53.242
AUDIENCE: Car wash?

00:12:53.242 --> 00:12:53.690
AUDIENCE: Detailer?

00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:55.450
DZOGCHEN PONLOP
RINPOCHE: Maintenance?

00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:56.276
Detailer?

00:12:56.276 --> 00:12:56.775
Maintenance.

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:02.910
Actually, recently
I got a used truck--

00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:05.940
I live in Washington state.

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:10.300
I got a used truck
from, strangely,

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:14.230
I got a used Chevy truck
at a Cadillac dealer.

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:16.690
And what I was
really happy about

00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:19.060
is lifetime free car wash.

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:25.650
That was a part of the deal.

00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:28.480
And so I was so happy.

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:30.597
And I was talking to
my friends and people.

00:13:30.597 --> 00:13:32.055
And then at some
point, I realized,

00:13:32.055 --> 00:13:37.120
like, this is how we
take care of our mind.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:41.010
We worry about the truck getting
washed every now and then.

00:13:41.010 --> 00:13:46.630
But do we ever think about
taking care of our mind?

00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:49.440
We do take pretty
good care of clothes.

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:52.010
We have different baskets.

00:13:52.010 --> 00:13:53.980
Some goes into dry cleaning.

00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:56.730
Some goes into laundry.

00:13:56.730 --> 00:13:58.510
And some goes into whatever.

00:13:58.510 --> 00:14:04.400
But our minds, in 24 hours,
we pay very little attention

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:07.570
to our minds.

00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:13.230
We do very little about
taking care of the maintenance

00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:14.660
of this mind.

00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:18.940
But we still expect so
much from our minds.

00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:22.790
The mind is like
our slave for 24/7.

00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:24.210
We want our mind to work.

00:14:24.210 --> 00:14:26.380
We want our mind to be happy.

00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:29.950
We want our mind to
be a high achiever.

00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:31.790
We want our mind to be focused.

00:14:34.006 --> 00:14:35.380
But there's no
maintenance that's

00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:39.370
done in terms of our mind.

00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:41.660
And so, therefore,
first thing that

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:45.480
becomes really important in
terms of development of joy,

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:54.390
of happiness, of getting any
kind of compassionate action

00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:59.800
or any kind of productivity
is to have a healthy mind.

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:06.980
And so how we can
work with our mind,

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:10.070
it's for us to Google
your mind before you

00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:11.275
Google anything else.

00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:15.630
What is Rinpoche's mind?

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:22.980
And so when you Google,
Google will actually

00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:29.840
tell you what is your
mind, your individual mind.

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:32.810
I think you all
know Google, so I

00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:34.130
think you know better than me.

00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:41.080
But if you look at
your search history,

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:47.840
if you look at the history
of your computer, the usage,

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:53.770
and can you imagine if you
saved all the search histories

00:15:53.770 --> 00:15:56.406
ever since you were born?

00:15:56.406 --> 00:15:57.030
Think about it.

00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:59.430
Like your mind's
always searching

00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:02.750
something outside all the time.

00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:08.800
If you think about the whole
search history together,

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:11.750
look at your own
search history, that

00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:17.430
is the result when you
Google what is your mind.

00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:19.150
You can see there.

00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:21.840
You can see a pattern there.

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:22.990
Isn't it?

00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:25.800
In that search history,
there's a program

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:30.970
that can actually show how many
times your history is related

00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:38.180
to what kind of emotions or
what kind of thought frame--

00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:40.650
positive thought,
negative thought.

00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:43.930
If you look at it, you can see
a whole history of your mind

00:16:43.930 --> 00:16:48.000
right there in the
search history.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:55.290
And so search is
not only in terms

00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:59.690
of physical search on a
computer, on a device,

00:16:59.690 --> 00:17:03.220
but search in terms of in
your own thought processes.

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:07.900
If you look at the search
that you do in your mind,

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:09.150
you're searching for truth.

00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:10.490
You're searching for happiness.

00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:12.160
You're searching for this.

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:13.660
You're searching
for a used truck.

00:17:18.116 --> 00:17:19.490
Actually, I must
tell you, Google

00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:24.530
was helpful finding
my used truck to buy.

00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:27.910
And so like that,
we're searching.

00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:32.120
Our mind is searching
outside all the time.

00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:36.960
So if you look at your
mind's search history,

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:38.940
so to speak-- if
there's a program

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:41.860
that can put together the
history of your search

00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:46.830
interests on categories
that you can tell clearly

00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:49.410
from that search
history your identity.

00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:58.010
can you tell, define
your mind frame,

00:17:58.010 --> 00:18:02.190
your identity, and your profile?

00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:05.930
It can also tell your habits,
how many times you have

00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:07.150
searched for certain things.

00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:14.690
It can actually tell
our mind's behavior.

00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:25.130
And so who are you when
you search your mind?

00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:25.680
Who are you?

00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:30.330
Who are we?

00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:34.870
When we search what is
our mind, who are we,

00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:39.220
is it-- are you
defined by your skill?

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:40.080
Your talent?

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:42.480
Is that who you are?

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:48.636
Or are you defined
by your family's

00:18:48.636 --> 00:18:51.860
or religious background?

00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:53.270
Or just simply a such history?

00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:57.706
So who are we?

00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:08.070
But actually, what you
can find from searching

00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:16.580
our mind is that we can
actually find who we are, who is

00:19:16.580 --> 00:19:18.600
this person, what is our mind.

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:24.890
And so, therefore-- I
think I shouldn't go on

00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:27.510
too long about searching here.

00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:31.500
And so, therefore, from the
search history, you can tell.

00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:36.880
Actually, it kind
of shows your mind

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:45.391
or your habitual tendencies
and can define who you are,

00:19:45.391 --> 00:19:45.890
the profile.

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:51.080
So don't they anyway--
don't they profile you

00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:54.670
from your search history?

00:19:54.670 --> 00:19:59.210
And so you can tell from
there if your search insight,

00:19:59.210 --> 00:20:03.060
as Ming has pointed
out so many times--

00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:08.260
if you search yourself
inside, you can see clearly.

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:12.030
And so anyway, when
you look in that way,

00:20:12.030 --> 00:20:17.040
you can see that our mind is
so empowered and controlled

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:22.890
by our habit all the time.

00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:26.120
Our biggest problem
is habit, isn't it?

00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:27.550
It's not about our wisdom.

00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:29.180
We have very smart people.

00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:29.980
People are smart.

00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:31.200
People have wisdom.

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:35.330
And people know what they
want to do, what's good to do,

00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:37.520
what's most beneficial to do.

00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:39.830
But the problem
here is the habit

00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:45.170
that is the obstructing us
from achieving that goal,

00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:49.650
achieving that
positive state of mind.

00:20:49.650 --> 00:20:52.770
And so, therefore, habit
is not being-- for example,

00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:58.950
habit is not being able
to sit in the present.

00:20:58.950 --> 00:21:03.110
Being in the present,
sitting quiet, doing nothing,

00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:05.920
it's very scary, isn't it?

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:08.810
That's the most scariest thing.

00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:11.890
If you have to sit in the
present moment and do nothing,

00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:13.430
that's scary.

00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:16.030
That's why we always
like to do something.

00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:24.290
What I've heard recently on NPR,
some cyber psychology research

00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:28.350
showed that the average person
in America looks at their phone

00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:31.010
200 times a day.

00:21:31.010 --> 00:21:33.790
OK they're looking at
the phone 200 times-- not

00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:36.820
about how much time you spend,
but picking up the phone

00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:42.050
and looking at it, like
200 times, average people.

00:21:42.050 --> 00:21:44.650
So from that, you
can tell that we

00:21:44.650 --> 00:21:48.920
like to do something and
get distracted rather

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:54.340
than being focused whether we
talk about working, whether we

00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:56.820
talk about working
with our mind,

00:21:56.820 --> 00:21:58.940
working with our
projects, anything.

00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:04.670
Our mind is more habituated
in scattered thoughts

00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:06.420
and distraction.

00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:11.900
And some recent research
from Harvard University

00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:18.580
shows that the average person is
distracted or lost in thoughts

00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:23.460
or distracted 47% each day.

00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:26.540
47% is distracted
or lost in thought.

00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:29.410
Can you imagine that, 47%?

00:22:29.410 --> 00:22:32.756
So that gives us how much left?

00:22:32.756 --> 00:22:33.700
AUDIENCE: 53?

00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:36.230
DZOGCHEN PONLOP
RINPOCHE: 53% left.

00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:40.210
And out of 53%, we have
to sleep a little bit.

00:22:40.210 --> 00:22:42.400
So take out some
time for sleeping.

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:44.390
And then how much is left?

00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:49.220
And then from there-- so if you
really narrow it down, look,

00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:53.350
our mind being focused,
it's very little.

00:22:53.350 --> 00:23:01.530
So can you imagine if you can
focus 47% of the time in a day,

00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:03.900
how much productive can you be?

00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:07.110
You can be really productive
in any kind of achievement

00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:10.280
you want to achieve--
compassionate action, love,

00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:16.630
kindness, or a good app.

00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:21.570
I'm talking about
meditation now, but any app.

00:23:21.570 --> 00:23:26.250
And so, therefore, you can see
our mind is very distracted.

00:23:26.250 --> 00:23:28.000
And the problem
with the distraction

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:35.940
is a mind wandering in all
scattered places is actually

00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:40.370
the direct cause of unhappiness.

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:45.471
It's a direct cause
of unhappiness.

00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:57.090
We feel that we would be happier
somewhere else all the time,

00:23:57.090 --> 00:23:58.859
don't we?

00:23:58.859 --> 00:24:00.400
We've been sitting
here in this room.

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:02.380
We feel like, oh,
I'll be much happier

00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:06.506
if I'm sitting in the sun
out there drinking beer.

00:24:06.506 --> 00:24:08.030
And when you're out
there in the sun

00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:10.060
drinking beer and
looking inside here,

00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:15.070
you might feel I'll be
much happier if I'm there

00:24:15.070 --> 00:24:16.200
doing something else.

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:20.540
And so, our mind's
always jumping and moving

00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:21.940
around all the time.

00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:26.400
And this is what we call
in the Buddhist teachings

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:30.700
or philosophy poverty mentality.

00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:39.440
And there's a sense of
discontentment all the time.

00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:43.820
The sense of discontentment
makes our mind move.

00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:48.770
Because we are discontent, we're
looking for something else.

00:24:48.770 --> 00:24:50.900
Because we are looking
for something else,

00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:53.860
you know, then we-- our mind
getting more distracted.

00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:57.510
Then it becomes 47% or more.

00:24:57.510 --> 00:25:00.840
47% is average.

00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:04.760
And recent studies
at also UC-Davis

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:11.510
have found that our
mind is primarily

00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:15.090
stuck in negative thinking.

00:25:15.090 --> 00:25:19.490
Our mind feels more comfortable
in negative thinking

00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:22.440
than positive thinking.

00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:25.470
So our mind is more deeply
rooted in negative thought

00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:29.560
patterns usually.

00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:32.700
So the UC-Davis studies
showed that-- th

00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:37.230
they did research with
the usually Group A,

00:25:37.230 --> 00:25:40.130
Group B, same amount of people.

00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:49.150
And then they had this
medical treatment as a thing

00:25:49.150 --> 00:25:50.490
to do the research here.

00:25:50.490 --> 00:25:54.130
And so they asked
Group A and told them

00:25:54.130 --> 00:26:02.200
that this medical treatment
has 70% of success.

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:04.820
And so everybody had
positive thought about it.

00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:10.500
They all say if I have to
do it, in that situation,

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:14.729
I would definitely
take this treatment.

00:26:14.729 --> 00:26:16.520
And then they went to
Group B and told them

00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:23.760
that this treatment has
30% chance of failure,

00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:25.380
like in the research,
how they do.

00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:29.420
And so that group thought-- they
had negative thought about it.

00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:32.220
And they thought
they really don't

00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:35.187
want to do it if they have to
do it, and so forth and so on.

00:26:35.187 --> 00:26:36.770
And then they went
back to the Group A

00:26:36.770 --> 00:26:41.870
and told them that not
only is 70% success rate,

00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:44.280
but does there's a
30% chance of failure.

00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:49.250
And then they changed
their mind right away

00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:52.960
from positive to negative.

00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:57.620
So most of them in Group A, they
had a negative thought about it

00:26:57.620 --> 00:27:01.490
now, even though their
first thought was positive.

00:27:01.490 --> 00:27:04.780
And then they went back to
the Group B and told them,

00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:13.490
it's not only 30% failure
rate, but also 70% success.

00:27:13.490 --> 00:27:15.020
But you know what?

00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:16.780
That didn't change their mind.

00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:18.770
They stayed negative.

00:27:18.770 --> 00:27:20.950
They stayed negative.

00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:24.150
And so the studies
showed that changing

00:27:24.150 --> 00:27:26.950
from positive to negative
is just an instant.

00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:29.480
And our mind is
habituated in that way.

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:31.170
It flips right away.

00:27:31.170 --> 00:27:34.040
It doesn't take
that long to flip,

00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:36.560
but flipping from
negative to positive

00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:40.220
is extremely
difficult. That's what

00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:45.230
we call habit, repetitive
habit, habitual pattern here.

00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:49.300
And so the UC-Davis
studies show also

00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:57.390
that it takes three
positive thoughts to balance

00:27:57.390 --> 00:27:59.050
with the one negative thought.

00:27:59.050 --> 00:28:02.860
Just to balance-- we're not
talking about transforming

00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:04.240
or changing or anything.

00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:07.480
Even just a balance, you
need three positive thoughts

00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:10.980
for one negative thought.

00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:14.870
And so, therefore, if you
don't take care of our mind

00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:20.790
here, and direct
our mind positively,

00:28:20.790 --> 00:28:26.670
it is pretty clear that our
usual habit, in general,

00:28:26.670 --> 00:28:28.840
is to get stuck in
a negative space.

00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:35.800
And then that's where you don't
find any sense of happiness,

00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:38.670
joy, or achievement.

00:28:38.670 --> 00:28:48.100
So, therefore, the
reason why we get

00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:49.870
stuck in such a
negative thought pattern

00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:54.350
is because of our habitual mind.

00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:57.170
And what we are
habituated usually

00:28:57.170 --> 00:29:00.865
is we are habituated
in labeling process.

00:29:05.290 --> 00:29:08.530
Anything we experience,
we need to label.

00:29:08.530 --> 00:29:13.450
What we see, what we hear,
what we experience-- we always

00:29:13.450 --> 00:29:15.800
mix that with labels.

00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:19.940
And we mix that with
thought processes.

00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:23.150
And so when you mix them
with thought processes here,

00:29:23.150 --> 00:29:28.610
then you lose the original power
or the original experience.

00:29:28.610 --> 00:29:35.660
So what you're experiencing
here is a labeled experience,

00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:39.560
which is like experiencing
a processed food.

00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:41.780
When you have a
processed food that

00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:46.750
has been mixed with colors and
artificial flavor, of course

00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:47.980
it tastes much better.

00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:49.800
I love them better.

00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:52.360
I love them better than
the raw vegetables.

00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:54.480
But you see the difference.

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:56.140
The nutrition is different.

00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:58.220
The power is different.

00:29:58.220 --> 00:30:00.670
And so, therefore, when
our mind is habituated

00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:03.430
in labeling everything,
especially negative

00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:05.840
labeling, as you can
see from the studies,

00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:11.660
then that's how we get
actually stuck in unhappiness.

00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:14.510
That's how we get
stuck in confusion.

00:30:14.510 --> 00:30:18.510
That's how we get stuck
in the sense of spinning

00:30:18.510 --> 00:30:22.990
around, chasing after own
tail, going around and around

00:30:22.990 --> 00:30:26.210
like our cats do.

00:30:26.210 --> 00:30:31.970
And so one of the key elements
in our everyday life when

00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:37.130
you search mind is
you find so much, so

00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:39.590
many experiences of emotions.

00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:45.950
Emotion is a big piece in
our experience of mind.

00:30:50.790 --> 00:30:52.710
Do you agree?

00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:53.660
Or is it just me?

00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:59.385
Emotion is a big piece in
our experience of mind.

00:31:06.450 --> 00:31:08.716
I've had a lot of experiences
with emotions myself.

00:31:14.190 --> 00:31:23.770
When I was young, especially
when I was in teenage,

00:31:23.770 --> 00:31:27.760
after the-- anyway, I
want to go into details,

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:30.520
but I had a lot
of emotions when I

00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:36.970
was a teenage and struggling
like anyone else with emotions

00:31:36.970 --> 00:31:39.370
during my teen.

00:31:39.370 --> 00:31:40.420
But I got time.

00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:49.590
I met my teacher and had
some help and support

00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:58.050
from his love and wisdom, and
through which I managed to work

00:31:58.050 --> 00:32:02.890
with my emotions a little bit.

00:32:02.890 --> 00:32:05.420
I'm not saying I'm
free of emotions now.

00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:11.350
So please don't test
me, but I managed

00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:15.730
to work with my
emotions a little bit.

00:32:15.730 --> 00:32:24.720
And so, therefore,
working with emotions

00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:28.570
becomes part of actually
working with our mind.

00:32:28.570 --> 00:32:31.440
When you search mind,
you see a lot of emotions

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:36.400
there because every
thought has some emotions.

00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:39.810
Every thought has some color.

00:32:39.810 --> 00:32:43.670
Every thought has some
touch of certain emotions.

00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:52.060
Whether they are
obvious or dormant,

00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:54.620
there is an emotion
behind every thought.

00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:05.660
It usually reminds me of
this "Godfather" novel.

00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:07.770
You know "Godfather"?

00:33:07.770 --> 00:33:11.600
I read this novel in India
when I was quite young.

00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:14.950
The first page,
there's a quotation

00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:20.490
saying behind every great
fortune there is a crime.

00:33:20.490 --> 00:33:22.910
So every time when I think
about emotion, it's like that.

00:33:25.730 --> 00:33:29.420
Behind every thought, behind
every motion into our mind,

00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:33.760
there's a little emotion going
on there, little emotions.

00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:40.340
And so life is full of
emotions, which is a good thing.

00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:46.170
It's not a bad thing because
life without emotions

00:33:46.170 --> 00:33:47.610
is like a flat soda.

00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:55.860
Who wants a drink of flat soda?

00:33:55.860 --> 00:34:01.060
So life with emotions is like
a real soda with bubbles.

00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:07.230
And so, therefore, emotions are
not really negative by nature,

00:34:07.230 --> 00:34:09.380
but they become
negative when they are

00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:13.590
mixed with thought processes.

00:34:13.590 --> 00:34:16.810
When they're mixed
with thought processes,

00:34:16.810 --> 00:34:23.350
when our experience of emotion
becomes searching outside

00:34:23.350 --> 00:34:27.630
towards the object of
emotions rather than looking

00:34:27.630 --> 00:34:32.590
at the energy and the power
of emotions themselves.

00:34:32.590 --> 00:34:36.610
That's when the
emotions become problem.

00:34:36.610 --> 00:34:39.540
When you experience
emotions, usually you're

00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:42.362
focusing on the object
of that emotion.

00:34:42.362 --> 00:34:46.170
You're not looking at the
emotion or emotional energy

00:34:46.170 --> 00:34:47.050
inwardly.

00:34:47.050 --> 00:34:50.730
But we're always looking
outside towards the object

00:34:50.730 --> 00:34:54.139
of that emotion and thinking,
oh, what he did wrong,

00:34:54.139 --> 00:34:59.800
or what she did wrong, or what
the world did wrong to you.

00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:04.580
And so then there's
so much focus outside.

00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:07.930
And so you lose the
perspective of true experience

00:35:07.930 --> 00:35:11.647
of this energy of our emotions.

00:35:11.647 --> 00:35:13.730
And so when you look at
the energy of the emotions

00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:20.650
themselves, it is actually
quite awakening energy.

00:35:20.650 --> 00:35:24.630
Energy of emotions is like
the electrical current that

00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:28.510
is always present in the wire.

00:35:28.510 --> 00:35:35.586
But whether we can tap into
that energy or not is up to us.

00:35:38.850 --> 00:35:46.370
So anyway, I think there's a lot
to talk about here, but maybe

00:35:46.370 --> 00:35:47.150
not much time.

00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:58.140
So what I want to say here is
not only we search our mind

00:35:58.140 --> 00:36:02.210
or Google the mind, but we
should also Google the Googler.

00:36:05.590 --> 00:36:07.670
We should also
search the searcher.

00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:10.550
Who's searching?

00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:13.920
First, we search
the mind outside

00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:19.710
and then search-- not search,
but look at-- the searcher

00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:24.920
or the Googler.

00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:27.430
Does that make sense?

00:36:27.430 --> 00:36:30.900
And then see what you find
when you Google the Googler.

00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:31.650
Who's the Googler?

00:36:35.490 --> 00:36:40.220
These days, we have a lot
of awareness about our mind

00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:42.450
and mindfulness.

00:36:42.450 --> 00:36:45.610
So I don't feel
like, I think, I need

00:36:45.610 --> 00:36:47.310
to speak about mindfulness.

00:36:47.310 --> 00:36:51.900
I think you have great
classes here and training

00:36:51.900 --> 00:37:01.290
with the search yourself inside,
Ming and the Google team here.

00:37:01.290 --> 00:37:05.300
And so I don't need to talk
about mindfulness here.

00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:11.920
But what I feel compelled
to say a little bit here

00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:14.780
is that sometimes our
mindfulness becomes

00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:20.330
too focused, too squeezed,
squeezed attention.

00:37:20.330 --> 00:37:23.550
When you focus too
much on mindfulness,

00:37:23.550 --> 00:37:25.345
sometimes that has
a counterproductive.

00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:34.280
For example, when you think too
much about not making mistake,

00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:37.580
that's when you
make more mistakes.

00:37:37.580 --> 00:37:43.840
Do remember writing with
pen and paper in old days?

00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:45.520
Now you can delete
and stuff like that.

00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:46.570
It's easy.

00:37:46.570 --> 00:37:51.590
My life in India when I grew
up is just pen and paper.

00:37:51.590 --> 00:37:53.620
We even had to
make our own pens.

00:37:53.620 --> 00:37:58.080
That's how I was trained,
making these bamboo pens

00:37:58.080 --> 00:37:59.740
and calligraphy.

00:37:59.740 --> 00:38:02.142
And so, I mean, I love it.

00:38:02.142 --> 00:38:03.350
And there's a beauty to that.

00:38:03.350 --> 00:38:06.580
You can smell the bamboo.

00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:10.210
You're making a
pen, your own pen.

00:38:10.210 --> 00:38:14.740
I didn't quite learn how to make
paper, but they do teach that.

00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:18.490
And so, anyway, so remember
when you write calligraphy

00:38:18.490 --> 00:38:21.850
in that way, the more you
focus, the more you think,

00:38:21.850 --> 00:38:23.990
like, I shouldn't
make mistake, then

00:38:23.990 --> 00:38:27.240
that's when you make a mistake.

00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:30.040
That's when I make the mistake.

00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:38.820
And so the more we think we need
to be mindful, focus narrowly,

00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:43.250
squeeze your attention so
hard, when you try so hard,

00:38:43.250 --> 00:38:46.350
sometimes that has
counter-productive.

00:38:46.350 --> 00:38:51.650
And so mindfulness needs
some sense of relaxation,

00:38:51.650 --> 00:38:52.905
the balance of relaxation.

00:38:58.330 --> 00:39:03.380
In fact, some tradition
of meditation in the East,

00:39:03.380 --> 00:39:06.010
like from Tibetan
tradition, even

00:39:06.010 --> 00:39:11.990
say that one and only thing
you really need is relaxation.

00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:13.186
That's all you need.

00:39:13.186 --> 00:39:15.510
If you can relax, that's enough.

00:39:15.510 --> 00:39:20.355
But can you imagine
totally relaxing?

00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:27.450
Totally relaxing is
almost not possible.

00:39:27.450 --> 00:39:29.480
But when somebody tells
you to be mindful,

00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:33.250
you feel, like, no,
I can't be mindful.

00:39:33.250 --> 00:39:35.290
But when somebody
tells you to relax,

00:39:35.290 --> 00:39:36.780
then we feel like,
I can't relax.

00:39:36.780 --> 00:39:38.750
I have to focus.

00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:40.670
[INAUDIBLE] all this focus.

00:39:40.670 --> 00:39:45.360
And so you can see the shifts
between focusing and relaxing

00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:50.120
is already there in
your mind's make-up.

00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:53.020
It's nothing new you need
to find from outside.

00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:55.690
It's already there.

00:39:55.690 --> 00:39:56.940
Can you see?

00:39:56.940 --> 00:39:59.860
That when someone tells you
to one point of your focus,

00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:04.030
you feel like, I can't do that,
My mind kind of a spacious--

00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:06.490
goes into all this
kind of space.

00:40:06.490 --> 00:40:09.250
But then when somebody tells
you to completely relax

00:40:09.250 --> 00:40:12.650
and don't focus at all, then
we feel, I can't do that.

00:40:12.650 --> 00:40:16.390
My mind goes into
this-- mind goes

00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:21.360
to this object or flower or
person or whatnot, a thought.

00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:25.320
And so these two things
are already there

00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:26.730
as part of your mind's make-up.

00:40:29.550 --> 00:40:35.980
And so you need to balance
the two in terms of finding,

00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:43.200
in terms of discovering our
mind and the awareness that's

00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:44.810
looking at the mind.

00:40:44.810 --> 00:40:50.830
You need to balance between
mindfulness and relaxation,

00:40:50.830 --> 00:40:55.440
focus yet relaxed, relaxed
but not distracted.

00:40:58.280 --> 00:40:59.120
That's the key.

00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:03.660
And that's the hardest piece
here because just to do one

00:41:03.660 --> 00:41:04.970
is easy.

00:41:04.970 --> 00:41:09.020
But to have the balance is not.

00:41:09.020 --> 00:41:10.200
It's not that easy.

00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:12.970
And so working with
our emotions begins

00:41:12.970 --> 00:41:16.060
with working with a
sense of mindfulness.

00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:20.840
Mindful, we need
the sense of a gap.

00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:24.380
And when we have the gap
or the space between you

00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:28.120
and your emotions, then
you have an opportunity

00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:31.980
or a possibility of seeing
your emotions clearly.

00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:34.687
And once you can see
your emotions clearly,

00:41:34.687 --> 00:41:36.270
then you have a
possibility of letting

00:41:36.270 --> 00:41:42.945
go of that emotion
that's bothering you.

00:41:42.945 --> 00:41:46.440
There's no way we can
let go without seeing

00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:49.110
that emotions clearly.

00:41:49.110 --> 00:41:53.997
And so I want to read you this
last thing, letting go piece.

00:41:57.480 --> 00:41:58.442
I like this story.

00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:05.090
Is it OK I read this to you?

00:42:05.090 --> 00:42:07.470
A psychologist
walked around a room

00:42:07.470 --> 00:42:12.130
while teaching stress
management to an audience.

00:42:12.130 --> 00:42:16.460
As she raised a glass
of water, everyone

00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:22.140
expected Debbie asked the half
empty, half full question.

00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:24.690
Instead, with a
smile on her face,

00:42:24.690 --> 00:42:30.690
she inquired, how heavy
is the glass of water?

00:42:30.690 --> 00:42:35.460
Answers called out ranged
from eight ounce to 20 ounce.

00:42:35.460 --> 00:42:40.770
She replied, the absolute
weight doesn't matter.

00:42:40.770 --> 00:42:43.332
It depends on how
long I hold it.

00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:51.370
If I hold it for a minute,
it's not a problem.

00:42:51.370 --> 00:42:57.210
If I hold it for an hour,
I'll have an ache in my arm.

00:42:57.210 --> 00:43:04.010
If I hold it for a day, my arm
will feel numb and paralyzed.

00:43:04.010 --> 00:43:08.560
In each case, the weight of
the glass doesn't change,

00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:13.050
but the longer I hold it,
the heavier it becomes.

00:43:13.050 --> 00:43:15.300
She continued.

00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:17.980
The stresses and
warriors in life

00:43:17.980 --> 00:43:20.270
are like that glass of water.

00:43:20.270 --> 00:43:24.420
Think about them for a
while and nothing happens.

00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:30.110
Think about them a bit longer,
and they begin to hurt.

00:43:30.110 --> 00:43:34.300
And if you think about
them all day long,

00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:38.810
you'll feel paralyzed,
incapable of doing anything.

00:43:38.810 --> 00:43:42.120
It's important to remember
to let go of your stresses

00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:44.850
as early in the
evening as you can.

00:43:44.850 --> 00:43:46.590
Put all your burdens down.

00:43:46.590 --> 00:43:50.380
Don't carry them through the
evening and into the night.

00:43:50.380 --> 00:43:54.130
Remember to put the glass down.

00:43:54.130 --> 00:43:58.790
So I like this
analogy of letting go.

00:43:58.790 --> 00:44:02.510
The Buddhist meditation
teaching always

00:44:02.510 --> 00:44:09.170
says that we need to let go
of our clinging, our grasping,

00:44:09.170 --> 00:44:10.530
and holding on to things.

00:44:13.090 --> 00:44:18.050
And so the letting
go piece is really

00:44:18.050 --> 00:44:20.540
the hardest part
of our practice,

00:44:20.540 --> 00:44:25.870
I think, hardest thing to
do in our life, letting go.

00:44:25.870 --> 00:44:31.910
That's where you can see how
many junk we collect at home.

00:44:31.910 --> 00:44:34.050
Some of your empty
yogurt containers,

00:44:34.050 --> 00:44:36.580
we'll wash them and
keep them, think you

00:44:36.580 --> 00:44:40.340
we will use them for
flour or something.

00:44:40.340 --> 00:44:43.170
So we collect all kinds of junk.

00:44:43.170 --> 00:44:46.000
In the same way, we collect all
kinds of junk in our thought,

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:48.600
in our mind that
we need to let go.

00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:53.450
Otherwise, we become
a mental hoarder.

00:44:53.450 --> 00:44:55.820
We're hoarding all kind
of negative thoughts,

00:44:55.820 --> 00:44:57.580
all kind of emotions.

00:44:57.580 --> 00:45:00.700
If we don't clean,
if we don't let go,

00:45:00.700 --> 00:45:03.635
then it becomes problematic.

00:45:03.635 --> 00:45:05.860
Like you need to clean the
search history from time

00:45:05.860 --> 00:45:07.670
to time.

00:45:07.670 --> 00:45:08.754
Or what do you call that?

00:45:08.754 --> 00:45:09.254
Cache?

00:45:13.970 --> 00:45:16.230
I mean, I'm not really
a computer person,

00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:22.352
but I'm one of the
persons that you

00:45:22.352 --> 00:45:31.890
are trying to make me use the
products that you develop.

00:45:31.890 --> 00:45:35.550
So I've been using a
lot of Google products.

00:45:35.550 --> 00:45:36.560
It's been pretty good.

00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:45.290
Is there a complaint
department somewhere?

00:45:45.290 --> 00:45:46.150
I'm just kidding.

00:45:46.150 --> 00:45:47.280
No, no complaints.

00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:49.170
It's good.

00:45:49.170 --> 00:45:50.669
Google Maps are excellent.

00:45:50.669 --> 00:45:52.460
And so I'd like to
thank you all very much.

00:45:52.460 --> 00:45:57.120
And especially I want to
thank our host here, Tom,

00:45:57.120 --> 00:45:58.670
for having me here.

00:45:58.670 --> 00:46:05.500
And I want to thank you,
Ming, for you excellent work

00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:09.010
with the search inside yourself
and all the program that

00:46:09.010 --> 00:46:13.330
continues here at
the Google campus.

00:46:13.330 --> 00:46:18.490
And so one last thing I want to
say is when you do meditation,

00:46:18.490 --> 00:46:24.510
if you are a meditator,
you're usually working

00:46:24.510 --> 00:46:26.730
with the breath, for example.

00:46:26.730 --> 00:46:29.810
Breathing in, breathing out,
you're focusing on the breath.

00:46:29.810 --> 00:46:32.370
You're trying to
concentrate your mind there.

00:46:32.370 --> 00:46:34.300
You're trying to
relax your mind there

00:46:34.300 --> 00:46:37.840
through breathing, through
one point of focus,

00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:39.750
through relaxation.

00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:44.640
And then from time to
time, look at the looker

00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:48.910
inwardly, not always looking
at the breath or any kind

00:46:48.910 --> 00:46:53.290
of meditative techniques you use
from all kind of world wisdom

00:46:53.290 --> 00:46:54.590
tradition.

00:46:54.590 --> 00:46:59.890
But sometimes you look at
the observing mind itself,

00:46:59.890 --> 00:47:01.760
observer.

00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:05.830
And sometimes when you have
emotions, don't just label it.

00:47:05.830 --> 00:47:08.830
Don't just look at the
object of your emotions,

00:47:08.830 --> 00:47:11.760
but look at the energy,
the experience of emotion

00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:18.390
that you feel inside of your
heart and see the energy,

00:47:18.390 --> 00:47:24.582
connect with the energy,
and pause right there.

00:47:24.582 --> 00:47:32.800
One of the biggest problems
we see in our American culture

00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:35.975
is that all of us try
to express everything.

00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:39.520
That is good.

00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:40.380
Expressing is good.

00:47:40.380 --> 00:47:41.670
It's nothing bad.

00:47:41.670 --> 00:47:44.165
But expressing can take
place a little bit later.

00:47:48.450 --> 00:47:53.350
Just take a few moments
before you express.

00:47:53.350 --> 00:47:57.875
That can save you a lot
of trouble and money.

00:48:00.930 --> 00:48:02.700
Sometimes you express
too early, and that

00:48:02.700 --> 00:48:03.960
causes so much therapy.

00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:06.620
And that's expensive.

00:48:06.620 --> 00:48:11.510
So I think it's important
for us to take a minute

00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:15.050
and look at our own
experience of emotions

00:48:15.050 --> 00:48:21.070
before we try to share or
experience that with anyone.

00:48:21.070 --> 00:48:23.340
Positively or negatively,
it doesn't matter.

00:48:23.340 --> 00:48:25.390
Just take a moment to feel it.

00:48:25.390 --> 00:48:27.550
Good emotions, feel
it for a moment.

00:48:27.550 --> 00:48:30.040
Bad emotions, feel
it for a moment.

00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:31.790
And then you have
plenty of time to share.

00:48:31.790 --> 00:48:32.638
Thank you.

00:48:32.638 --> 00:48:34.510
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:41.330
AUDIENCE: Rinpoche,
I really want

00:48:41.330 --> 00:48:43.040
to thank you for
your teaching today.

00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:46.350
I really like your teaching
on [INAUDIBLE] and also

00:48:46.350 --> 00:48:47.850
[INAUDIBLE].

00:48:47.850 --> 00:48:51.300
But it's really hard to
achieve happiness all the time

00:48:51.300 --> 00:48:52.840
in your life.

00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:53.940
It's really hard.

00:48:53.940 --> 00:48:55.680
Especially when we
see that sometimes

00:48:55.680 --> 00:49:00.476
even though some of our greatest
masters will have troubles.

00:49:00.476 --> 00:49:02.700
Maybe you are aware
that something happened

00:49:02.700 --> 00:49:04.034
to [INAUDIBLE] recently.

00:49:04.034 --> 00:49:05.450
DZOGCHEN PONLOP
RINPOCHE: Oh, yes.

00:49:05.450 --> 00:49:07.610
AUDIENCE: Do you have
any comments on that?

00:49:07.610 --> 00:49:09.026
DZOGCHEN PONLOP
RINPOCHE: On what?

00:49:09.026 --> 00:49:12.250
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
his problem.

00:49:21.625 --> 00:49:23.000
DZOGCHEN PONLOP
RINPOCHE: I think

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:26.350
the challenge is, as
myself being a Buddhist

00:49:26.350 --> 00:49:28.560
and practitioner
and also teacher,

00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:31.800
the challenges are
across the board.

00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:32.961
It's the same thing.

00:49:32.961 --> 00:49:34.710
It doesn't matter
whether you're a teacher

00:49:34.710 --> 00:49:39.930
or not, or whether you're
in a monastery or not.

00:49:39.930 --> 00:49:45.620
The challenges are the same, but
they appear in different forms.

00:49:45.620 --> 00:49:48.070
Sometimes you feel
like, oh, it would

00:49:48.070 --> 00:49:49.740
be so nice to become a monk.

00:49:49.740 --> 00:49:54.122
But the monk was worse than
where you are now sometimes.

00:49:54.122 --> 00:49:55.580
And sometimes you
feel like, oh, it

00:49:55.580 --> 00:49:58.660
would be so nice to be a
lay person and do something.

00:49:58.660 --> 00:50:01.550
But then probably it's better
for you to be at the monastery.

00:50:01.550 --> 00:50:08.210
And so the challenges come
in all different forms.

00:50:08.210 --> 00:50:12.170
And we all need to find
a way to do with them.

00:50:12.170 --> 00:50:15.300
And recently, I think, you're
talk about the one young lama

00:50:15.300 --> 00:50:16.730
leaving the monastery.

00:50:16.730 --> 00:50:19.550
I think that happens
quite often in general.

00:50:19.550 --> 00:50:26.070
And I think, I mean, it's
nothing wrong in some sense

00:50:26.070 --> 00:50:29.890
because it's
individual choice, what

00:50:29.890 --> 00:50:35.520
kind of path that each teacher
wants to manifest or chooses

00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:36.910
is up to that person.

00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:43.045
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:50:43.045 --> 00:50:44.045
Thanks for coming today.

00:50:44.045 --> 00:50:45.545
DZOGCHEN PONLOP
RINPOCHE: Thank you.

00:50:45.545 --> 00:50:49.740
AUDIENCE: What's a useful way
to view emotions, in general,

00:50:49.740 --> 00:50:51.060
in a balanced way?

00:50:51.060 --> 00:50:54.320
In the sense that
I'm not particularly

00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:55.770
in touch with my
own emotions, it

00:50:55.770 --> 00:50:58.817
might take some effort to
detect and be aware of them.

00:50:58.817 --> 00:51:01.400
And some people I know are very
much driven by their emotions,

00:51:01.400 --> 00:51:03.150
and they're very
present and at the front

00:51:03.150 --> 00:51:06.360
of their consciousness.

00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:10.930
And so I tend to think that
with less emotional drive,

00:51:10.930 --> 00:51:12.597
I act more rationally
or more carefully.

00:51:12.597 --> 00:51:14.055
DZOGCHEN PONLOP
RINPOCHE: Oh, I see

00:51:14.055 --> 00:51:15.960
AUDIENCE: But maybe
that's not necessarily

00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:17.740
a positive balanced way.

00:51:17.740 --> 00:51:20.540
What's a good way, you
would say, to view emotions?

00:51:25.110 --> 00:51:27.540
DZOGCHEN PONLOP RINPOCHE:
I think it's no problem.

00:51:27.540 --> 00:51:30.820
If there is no emotion,
it's good news.

00:51:30.820 --> 00:51:33.130
I mean, no bad emotions,
it's good news.

00:51:33.130 --> 00:51:35.370
There's no problem with that.

00:51:35.370 --> 00:51:38.780
But if you are intentionally
blocking out emotion thinking

00:51:38.780 --> 00:51:40.800
it's not good to
have emotions, then

00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:43.010
I think there's a problem there.

00:51:43.010 --> 00:51:46.430
If the emotions are coming,
and you have this presence of,

00:51:46.430 --> 00:51:50.740
let's say, anger all the time
or some sense of jealousy,

00:51:50.740 --> 00:51:53.850
then it's good to
connect with that energy

00:51:53.850 --> 00:51:59.280
rather than pushing it down,
or rather than thinking

00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:02.580
some philosophically or
religiously that this is not

00:52:02.580 --> 00:52:05.150
right or not a
good thing to have.

00:52:05.150 --> 00:52:07.540
But, actually, the energy
of anger is beautiful.

00:52:07.540 --> 00:52:09.170
It's positive.

00:52:09.170 --> 00:52:10.610
There's nothing wrong with that.

00:52:10.610 --> 00:52:13.540
So the balance here
is if they're present,

00:52:13.540 --> 00:52:17.560
appreciate them and try
to work with that energy.

00:52:17.560 --> 00:52:19.680
And when they're not
present, appreciate

00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:23.450
the absence of the
emotions and then

00:52:23.450 --> 00:52:26.810
work with the rational
mind and what have you.

00:52:26.810 --> 00:52:31.440
So not invite them necessarily
when they're not there,

00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:34.190
but then not reject them
when they're present.

00:52:34.190 --> 00:52:37.090
That's the balance I think.

00:52:37.090 --> 00:52:39.840
