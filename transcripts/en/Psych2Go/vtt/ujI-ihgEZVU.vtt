00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.610
Moving on from a breakup is a difficult process.

Following the shock of the initial separation, our feelings of anger, sadness and grief that is often crippling and mind-numbing.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.709
The pain of a breakup is so profound that it sometimes leaves us not knowing what to do next.

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.599
1) Steer clear and keep distance.

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:49.619
After the initial shock of a breakup, and on occasions, the somewhat empty promise to remain friends,

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:57.419
It is important to remember to distance yourself of them. No communication whatsoever, including calls, texts and IMs.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.349
Even contact with the same friends or families should be avoided.

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:03.779
It doesn't mean that you have to avoid them forever,

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.879
But it is important to keep away for a while in order for you to heal your heart and move on.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.119
2) Surround yourself with support

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:17.279
When hurting, it is easy to distance yourself from others and just keep the pain away.

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.209
You begin to question your self-worth. Are you really good enough?

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:27.299
However, it is important that you surround yourself with positivity and people who will support you fully.

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:30.449
Not only will this help you in moving on from your ex,

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:36.719
But it will also be good for your bruised ego, as it reinforces your self-concept and rebuilds your self-worth.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.679
3) Manage your Anger and avoid lashing out.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.740

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:52.080
Some people deal with it with grace and passiveness that epitomises maturity. There are also people who would burn closets worth of clothes,

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.420
Destroyed furniture and memorabilia,

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:57.599
Cut out and shred album after album of photos,

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:03.959
Lash out at friends who mentioned something triggering, and on occasions come up to their ex and make a scene.

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:07.649
It is important to find a way to deal with the anger of a breakup.

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.999
Some can easily fall the deep end and resort to alcohol and drugs.

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.969
One healthy way of coping is to try and write a journal of everything negative in the relationship.

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.700
This way not only are you letting out your hidden frustrations and angers,

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.320
You can also help justify the reasons why the break-up happened in the first place.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.986
4) Feel your emotions and deal with them.

00:02:29.986 --> 00:02:34.779
It's a natural reaction to push everything down and pretend that nothing happened,

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.099
Because whether we like it or not, the world doesn't stop if we are hurt.

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.600
After a breakup, it is important to remember that as humans, we feel.

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:51.460
The anger, the pain, the confusion, the frustration and the worry that you are not good enough, and you may never be happy again.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:03:00.010
Acknowledging these emotions are frightening. However, it is necessary to face them sift through them and deal with them in order to move on.

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.659
Set time to grieve the relationship for what it was and what it should have been.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.570
Cry and mope, but don't let the negative emotions consume you and hold you back from living your life.

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.750
5) Talk it out.

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.000
There are certain days for the overwhelming feeling of pain and loneliness reaches its limits.

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.649
You feel helpless, at the same time, you feel like your chest is going to burst.

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:30.010
Many people are capable of bouncing back from a breakup on their own, but this isn't possible for most.

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.249
Some people have trouble coping with their emotions.

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.790
If you're having trouble coping and feel that you're depressed, seek help immediately.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.000
6) Self reflection

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.329
Even if you're enjoying each other's company, something probably went wrong along the way.

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:09.040
Thinking of the reasons why the relationship failed can help you realize the mistakes you probably made, and help you understand where, and why

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.270
the relationship didn't work out

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:18.939
This can also help avoid making the same mistakes in future relationships. By this time it is important to take good care of yourself.

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:24.760
Take a look in the mirror and learn more about yourself. You might realize something you never thought possible.

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.569
7) Organize your living space.

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:34.560
Seeing things the two of you shared will bring forth torrents of fears and pain memories.

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.030
To remedy this, you can change things up and redecorate your environment.

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:45.869
It can be as simple as rearranging the sofa and coffee table, to painting the whole room a different color and changing the drapes.

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:49.019
Remove painful triggers that remind you of the past.

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:57.539
Regardless if your home reminds you of your past lover, it is important to acknowledge change. Embrace it and accept it to learn from it.

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:00.719
8) Go out and have fun.

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.549
Sometimes it's easy to forget that there's a whole world outside of your own.

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:13.000
While breakups suck, and it feels like the end of the world, it is important not to let yourself be eaten by the negativity of it.

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:20.788
Eat meals with your family, go outside and hang out with friends, jog around the block or just meet new people and dogs out in the park.

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:23.190
Go out and have fun!

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:26.489
9) Be aware of rebound relationships.

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.789
Rebound simply doesn't work most of the time.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:35.200
For some people, jumping in on another relationship just shortly after a breakup,

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:41.460
Is simply a way of masking the negative emotions. It may sound nice to be embraced and appreciated by another person,

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:47.430
But ultimately, when the relationship fails, the amount of negative emotions you have to deal with, will double.

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:55.349
It is important to settle things first and remain single to reflect on yourself in a relationship before jumping in on an unsteady relationship.

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:58.559
Have fun and mingle, but don't commit to easily.

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:01.289
10) Stand by your decision.

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:10.700
Regardless, if it was you or them that chose to end the relationship, it is important to stand by the break-up and respect the decision to separate.

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:15.959
It is easy to focus on the good side of the relationship and completely dismiss the negative side.

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:22.229
However, it is a balance of looking at the relationship with objective eyes that can help romanticize the break-up.

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:27.719
Cherish the good moments you have with each other. Learn from the painful mistakes you did together.

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:30.869
Accept the situation and move forward with your life.

00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:33.749
Greater things wait for those who strive.

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:40.000
Remember, a broken heart is a painful ordeal that affects us at one time or another,

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.430
It is perfectly normal to cry, mope, and feel depressed about it.

00:06:44.919 --> 00:06:48.959
However, one must always remember that there is always a rainbow after the rain.

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:53.579
That even though it feels like the world around you is collapsing to destruction,

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:59.699
It's just a part of life. Each heartbreak is a chance to learn more about yourself, and how you deal with it.

00:07:00.789 --> 00:07:07.919
