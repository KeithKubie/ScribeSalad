(calm electronic music)

00:00:12.412 --> 00:00:13.713
- Hey, come on in!

00:00:13.713 --> 00:00:16.282
(upbeat music)

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:22.188
Yes, Push &amp; Believe, you got it!

00:00:22.188 --> 00:00:24.791
Can I get you some water,

00:00:24.791 --> 00:00:26.993
a Zima, a Kirkland flat?

00:00:26.993 --> 00:00:29.195 line:0%
Brody, you've researched me.

00:00:29.195 --> 00:00:30.497
I know I have.

00:00:30.497 --> 00:00:32.832
It's easy to find you, I
just type it in on Bing.

00:00:32.832 --> 00:00:34.401
Bing, yes!

00:00:34.401 --> 00:00:37.370
Hangover one, in it,
Hangover II, in it.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:38.872
Due Date, in it.

00:00:38.872 --> 00:00:40.740 align:start size:97% position:3%
Funny People, let me guess,
you were cut out of it.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:41.775
How did you know?

00:00:41.775 --> 00:00:42.942
Because I'm you.

00:00:42.942 --> 00:00:44.210
What?

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.812 align:start size:84% position:16%
That's right, Brody,
I'm in your head.

00:00:45.812 --> 00:00:47.080
Really?

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.248 align:start size:84% position:16%
Did you take your
Lamictal last night?

00:00:48.248 --> 00:00:49.516
How do you know I'm on Lamictal?

00:00:49.516 --> 00:00:50.884
Cause all you do
is talk about it.

00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:51.718
Really?

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:52.685
Yes!

00:00:52.685 --> 00:00:54.087
It's amazing that we connect.

00:00:54.087 --> 00:00:55.555
You know what, I know.

00:00:55.555 --> 00:00:57.891 align:start size:94% position:6%
I am preparing for a
half hour comedy special,

00:00:57.891 --> 00:00:59.292
and I know it's gonna go well.

00:00:59.292 --> 00:01:01.561
It did go well, I'm
from the future.

00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:02.395
Are you serious?

00:01:02.395 --> 00:01:03.930
You got it.

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.498
Is there anything that you
don't like about yourself?

00:01:05.498 --> 00:01:08.168
I don't like the way
I appear on camera,

00:01:08.168 --> 00:01:09.803
and I gotta get over that.

00:01:09.803 --> 00:01:11.671
You do, and I wanna get over it,

00:01:11.671 --> 00:01:14.274 align:start size:97% position:3%
and that's why I'm
meditating, I'm doing yoga,

00:01:14.274 --> 00:01:16.843 align:start size:84% position:16%
I'm doing therapy, I'm
walking the stairs.

00:01:16.843 --> 00:01:20.747
Yeah, I don't wanna have the
ailments that my father had.

00:01:20.747 --> 00:01:22.816
Exactly, I didn't
wanna go there,

00:01:22.816 --> 00:01:25.885 align:start size:97% position:3%
but you did lose your father
at a point in your life

00:01:25.885 --> 00:01:28.154
where maybe you needed him.

00:01:28.988 --> 00:01:29.823
Yeah.

00:01:31.291 --> 00:01:33.693 align:start size:84% position:16%
(sniffs) I promised
myself I wouldn't cry.

00:01:33.693 --> 00:01:35.495 align:start size:88% position:13%
I understand what you're
going through, Brody.

00:01:35.495 --> 00:01:38.932 align:start size:84% position:16%
What I didn't share
with my father,

00:01:38.932 --> 00:01:40.567
I share with my mother.

00:01:40.567 --> 00:01:42.235
I feel that connection with you.

00:01:42.235 --> 00:01:44.437
Like, she was there
with me for Conan.

00:01:44.437 --> 00:01:48.041 align:start size:97% position:3%
I know that, Brody, I watched
season one of Enjoy It!.

00:01:48.041 --> 00:01:49.476
You had HBO GO?

00:01:49.476 --> 00:01:50.677
Yes, I have an iPad.

00:01:50.677 --> 00:01:52.212
Really?

00:01:52.212 --> 00:01:54.981
You know, I'm very good
online, I have AppleCare.

00:01:54.981 --> 00:01:56.649
You have AppleCare?

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:57.684
Who gets AppleCare?

00:01:57.684 --> 00:01:59.152
I got it, you know why?

00:01:59.152 --> 00:02:00.253
Because I care.

00:02:00.253 --> 00:02:01.488
You do care.

00:02:01.488 --> 00:02:03.523
Exactly, Brody,
that's what I do.

00:02:03.523 --> 00:02:05.592
You've walked me through
a lot of things today.

00:02:05.592 --> 00:02:08.828
Yeah, you grew, I know you
have adult onset autism.

00:02:08.828 --> 00:02:11.464
How dare you do that to me?

00:02:11.464 --> 00:02:12.799
That's my secret!

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:13.900
Well, you know what?

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.635
It's on Wikipedia.

00:02:15.635 --> 00:02:17.237
Take it down, I can't take it,

00:02:17.237 --> 00:02:19.205
I can, and then they
can put it back up.

00:02:19.205 --> 00:02:21.307 align:start size:84% position:16%
It's open for
everybody to add it.

00:02:21.307 --> 00:02:22.542
Really?

00:02:22.542 --> 00:02:24.344
Yeah, I know that
about Wikipedia.

00:02:24.344 --> 00:02:26.146 align:start size:88% position:13%
Okay, then why don't you
follow me on Twitter?

00:02:26.146 --> 00:02:28.414
Cause I'm not into it
anymore, I do Vine.

00:02:28.414 --> 00:02:30.150
What, don't get aggressive.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.086
I wouldn't do that, Dr.
Tabori would be upset.

00:02:33.086 --> 00:02:34.020
Dr. Tabori?

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.455
Yeah, she's my therapist.

00:02:35.455 --> 00:02:37.056
Steven, I get emotional, Brody,

00:02:37.056 --> 00:02:38.791
twice I charged a
mound in T-Ball.

00:02:38.791 --> 00:02:40.560
(laughs) That's a funny joke.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.897
I follow up, I don't just
quit when I'm feeling good.

00:02:43.897 --> 00:02:46.299
You know what, I made
that mistake one time.

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:50.103 align:start size:97% position:3%
I was feeling good, and I,
too, got off my meds, you did?

00:02:50.103 --> 00:02:51.070
Yes, I did.

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.338
And what happened?

00:02:52.338 --> 00:02:53.673
I had an episode.

00:02:53.673 --> 00:02:55.575
But you're better now?

00:02:55.575 --> 00:02:57.110
I am better now,
I have structure.

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.712
And because of that,
you and I will crush

00:02:59.712 --> 00:03:03.816 align:start size:94% position:6%
at Comedy Central's
half-hour, yearly taping.

00:03:03.816 --> 00:03:05.118
You got it, Brody.

00:03:05.118 --> 00:03:07.320
No, you got it, Steven.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.154
Push

00:03:08.154 --> 00:03:09.055
&amp; Believe?

00:03:09.055 --> 00:03:10.290
Yeah!

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.193
You got it, alright, one
more time, for safety.

00:03:13.193 --> 00:03:15.161
Three, two, one,

00:03:15.161 --> 00:03:17.096
Push &amp; Believe!

00:03:17.096 --> 00:03:17.931
Whew!

00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:20.833
Pretty good, right?

00:03:20.833 --> 00:03:21.734
That was okay.

00:03:21.734 --> 00:03:23.336
Hold that thought.

00:03:23.336 --> 00:03:24.537 line:0%
We'll be right back

00:03:24.537 --> 00:03:26.873 line:0%
with the Steven Brody
Stevens Interview.
