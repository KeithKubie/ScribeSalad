00:00:13.868 --> 00:00:17.487
I've been trying to figure out
what I was going to say here for months.

00:00:19.146 --> 00:00:22.375
Because there's no bigger stage than TED,

00:00:22.399 --> 00:00:24.884
it felt like getting my message right
in this moment

00:00:24.908 --> 00:00:27.129
was more important than anything.

00:00:28.223 --> 00:00:30.860
And so I searched and searched
for days on end,

00:00:30.884 --> 00:00:33.732
trying to find the right
configuration of words.

00:00:34.927 --> 00:00:36.491
And although intellectually,

00:00:36.515 --> 00:00:41.818
I could bullet point the big ideas
that I wanted to share about Me Too

00:00:41.842 --> 00:00:43.510
and this movement that I founded,

00:00:44.578 --> 00:00:48.694
I kept finding myself
falling short of finding the heart.

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:53.285
I wanted to pour myself into this moment

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:59.178
and tell you why even the possibility
of healing or interrupting sexual violence

00:00:59.202 --> 00:01:01.264
was worth standing and fighting for.

00:01:02.652 --> 00:01:06.295
I wanted to rally you to your feet
with an uplifting speech

00:01:06.319 --> 00:01:12.669
about the important work of fighting
for the dignity and humanity of survivors.

00:01:15.051 --> 00:01:16.575
But I don't know if I have it.

00:01:18.692 --> 00:01:20.741
The reality is,

00:01:20.765 --> 00:01:24.652
after soldiering through
the Supreme Court nomination process

00:01:24.676 --> 00:01:27.155
and attacks from the White House,

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:29.571
gross mischaracterizations,

00:01:29.595 --> 00:01:31.875
internet trolls

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:34.311
and the rallies and marches

00:01:35.585 --> 00:01:37.764
and heart-wrenching testimonies,

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.897
I'm faced with my own hard truth.

00:01:43.902 --> 00:01:45.052
I'm numb.

00:01:46.839 --> 00:01:48.521
And I'm not surprised.

00:01:49.458 --> 00:01:52.577
I've traveled all across
the world giving talks,

00:01:52.601 --> 00:01:55.236
and like clockwork, after every event,

00:01:56.125 --> 00:01:57.796
more than one person approaches me

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.887
so that they can
say their piece in private.

00:02:01.355 --> 00:02:03.443
And I always tried to reassure them.

00:02:05.403 --> 00:02:08.403
You know, I'd give them local resources

00:02:09.774 --> 00:02:13.755
and a soft reassurance
that they're not alone

00:02:13.779 --> 00:02:15.321
and this is their movement, too.

00:02:17.042 --> 00:02:19.492
I'd tell them that we're stronger together

00:02:19.516 --> 00:02:24.038
and that this is a movement
of survivors and advocates

00:02:24.062 --> 00:02:26.791
doing things big and small every day.

00:02:28.708 --> 00:02:31.082
And more and more people
are joining this movement

00:02:31.106 --> 00:02:32.326
every single day.

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:33.541
That part is clear.

00:02:34.765 --> 00:02:37.135
People are putting
their bodies on the line

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:40.709
and raising their voices to say,
"Enough is enough."

00:02:42.627 --> 00:02:44.294
So why do I feel this way?

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.210
Well ...

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:53.079
Someone with credible accusations
of sexual violence against him

00:02:53.103 --> 00:02:56.753
was confirmed to the Supreme Court
of the United States of America,

00:02:58.153 --> 00:02:59.303
again.

00:03:00.973 --> 00:03:02.343
The US President,

00:03:02.367 --> 00:03:06.859
who was caught on tape talking
about how he can grab women's body parts

00:03:06.883 --> 00:03:09.560
wherever he wants, however he wants,

00:03:09.584 --> 00:03:12.332
can call a survivor a liar
at one of his rallies,

00:03:12.356 --> 00:03:13.695
and the crowds will roar.

00:03:15.817 --> 00:03:18.833
And all across the world,
where Me Too has taken off,

00:03:18.857 --> 00:03:20.913
Australia and France,

00:03:20.937 --> 00:03:24.301
Sweden, China and now India,

00:03:24.325 --> 00:03:28.381
survivors of sexual violence
are all at once being heard

00:03:28.405 --> 00:03:29.825
and then vilified.

00:03:31.267 --> 00:03:35.870
And I've read article
after article bemoaning ...

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.110
wealthy white men

00:03:40.134 --> 00:03:43.429
who have landed softly
with their golden parachutes,

00:03:43.453 --> 00:03:46.402
following the disclosure
of their terrible behavior.

00:03:47.745 --> 00:03:50.872
And we're asked to consider their futures.

00:03:52.096 --> 00:03:53.800
But what of survivors?

00:03:55.374 --> 00:04:00.498
This movement is constantly
being called a watershed moment,

00:04:00.522 --> 00:04:01.945
or even a reckoning,

00:04:02.934 --> 00:04:07.164
but I wake up some days feeling
like all evidence points to the contrary.

00:04:11.707 --> 00:04:13.263
It's hard not to feel numb.

00:04:14.825 --> 00:04:17.032
I suspect some of you may feel numb, too.

00:04:19.158 --> 00:04:20.999
But let me tell you what else I know.

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:24.299
Sometimes when you hear the word "numb,"

00:04:24.323 --> 00:04:28.090
you think of a void,
an absence of feelings,

00:04:28.114 --> 00:04:30.915
or even the inability to feel.

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:33.565
But that's not always true.

00:04:35.534 --> 00:04:40.281
Numbness can come from those memories
that creep up in your mind

00:04:40.305 --> 00:04:42.867
that you can't fight off
in the middle of the night.

00:04:43.863 --> 00:04:46.793
They can come from the tears
that are locked behind your eyes

00:04:46.817 --> 00:04:49.260
that you won't give yourself
permission to cry.

00:04:50.453 --> 00:04:55.662
For me, numbness comes
from looking in the face of survivors

00:04:55.686 --> 00:04:57.492
and knowing everything to say

00:04:58.395 --> 00:05:00.213
but having nothing left to give.

00:05:01.694 --> 00:05:06.004
It's measuring the magnitude
of this task ahead of you

00:05:06.028 --> 00:05:08.217
versus your own wavering fortitude.

00:05:09.675 --> 00:05:12.397
Numbness is not always
the absence of feeling.

00:05:13.371 --> 00:05:16.290
Sometimes it's
an accumulation of feelings.

00:05:18.386 --> 00:05:20.081
And as survivors,

00:05:20.105 --> 00:05:23.195
we often have to hold
the truth of what we experience.

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:26.538
But now, we're all holding something,

00:05:26.562 --> 00:05:28.130
whether we want to or not.

00:05:29.363 --> 00:05:32.835
Our colleagues are speaking up
and speaking out,

00:05:32.859 --> 00:05:36.550
industries across the board
are reexamining workplace culture,

00:05:37.558 --> 00:05:41.709
and families and friends
are having hard conversations

00:05:41.733 --> 00:05:43.565
about closely held truths.

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:46.681
Everybody is impacted.

00:05:48.953 --> 00:05:51.013
And then, there's the backlash.

00:05:51.037 --> 00:05:52.585
We've all heard it.

00:05:52.609 --> 00:05:54.536
"The Me Too Movement is a witch hunt."

00:05:55.197 --> 00:05:56.347
Right?

00:05:56.371 --> 00:05:59.737
"Me Too is dismantling due process."

00:05:59.761 --> 00:06:02.459
Or, "Me Too has created a gender war."

00:06:04.467 --> 00:06:10.214
The media has been consistent
with headline after headline

00:06:10.238 --> 00:06:12.906
that frames this movement in ways
that make it difficult

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:15.175
to move our work forward,

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:17.873
and right-wing pundits and other critics

00:06:17.897 --> 00:06:23.127
have these talking points
that shift the focus away from survivors.

00:06:23.978 --> 00:06:26.756
So suddenly, a movement
that was started to support

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:29.206
all survivors of sexual violence

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:32.587
is being talked about
like it's a vindictive plot against men.

00:06:33.211 --> 00:06:34.618
And I'm like, "Huh?"

00:06:34.992 --> 00:06:36.745
(Laughter)

00:06:37.741 --> 00:06:39.015
How did we get here?

00:06:41.984 --> 00:06:44.304
We have moved so far away

00:06:44.328 --> 00:06:48.418
from the origins of this movement
that started a decade ago,

00:06:48.442 --> 00:06:52.808
or even the intentions of the hashtag
that started just a year ago,

00:06:52.832 --> 00:06:56.923
that sometimes, the Me Too movement
that I hear some people talk about

00:06:56.947 --> 00:06:58.919
is unrecognizable to me.

00:07:00.777 --> 00:07:02.062
But be clear:

00:07:03.111 --> 00:07:06.813
This is a movement
about the one in four girls

00:07:06.837 --> 00:07:08.818
and the one in six boys

00:07:08.842 --> 00:07:11.163
who are sexually assaulted every year

00:07:11.187 --> 00:07:13.416
and carry those wounds into adulthood.

00:07:14.403 --> 00:07:18.664
It's about the 84 percent of trans women
who will be sexually assaulted this year

00:07:20.082 --> 00:07:21.575
and the indigenous women

00:07:21.599 --> 00:07:25.241
who are three-and-a-half times
more likely to be sexually assaulted

00:07:25.265 --> 00:07:26.470
than any other group.

00:07:27.601 --> 00:07:29.371
Or people with disabilities,

00:07:29.395 --> 00:07:32.505
who are seven times more likely
to be sexually abused.

00:07:34.825 --> 00:07:37.840
It's about the 60 percent
of black girls like me

00:07:38.904 --> 00:07:42.927
who will be experiencing
sexual violence before they turn 18,

00:07:44.618 --> 00:07:48.528
and the thousands and thousands
of low-wage workers

00:07:48.552 --> 00:07:50.751
who are being sexually harassed right now

00:07:50.775 --> 00:07:53.012
on jobs that they can't afford to quit.

00:07:55.422 --> 00:07:59.517
This is a movement about
the far-reaching power of empathy.

00:08:01.045 --> 00:08:05.189
And so it's about the millions
and millions of people

00:08:05.213 --> 00:08:09.187
who, one year ago,
raised their hands to say, "Me too,"

00:08:09.211 --> 00:08:11.282
and their hands are still raised

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:15.005
while the media
that they consume erases them

00:08:15.835 --> 00:08:19.684
and politicians who they elected
to represent them

00:08:19.708 --> 00:08:21.724
pivot away from solutions.

00:08:23.009 --> 00:08:28.059
It's understandable that the push-pull
of this unique, historical moment

00:08:28.083 --> 00:08:31.996
feels like an emotional roller-coaster
that has rendered many of us numb.

00:08:33.989 --> 00:08:36.830
This accumulation of feelings

00:08:37.509 --> 00:08:41.858
that so many of us are experiencing
together, across the globe,

00:08:43.318 --> 00:08:44.786
is collective trauma.

00:08:46.759 --> 00:08:47.909
But ...

00:08:48.807 --> 00:08:52.457
it is also the first step

00:08:52.481 --> 00:08:55.829
towards actively building a world
that we want right now.

00:08:57.758 --> 00:09:01.227
What we do with this thing
that we're all holding

00:09:01.251 --> 00:09:04.187
is the evidence that this
is bigger than a moment.

00:09:04.211 --> 00:09:07.147
It's the confirmation
that we are in a movement.

00:09:09.123 --> 00:09:11.547
And the most powerful movements

00:09:11.571 --> 00:09:14.758
have always been built
around what's possible,

00:09:15.968 --> 00:09:19.555
not just claiming what is right now.

00:09:21.676 --> 00:09:24.120
Trauma halts possibility.

00:09:26.152 --> 00:09:27.755
Movement activates it.

00:09:29.347 --> 00:09:32.653
Dr. King famously quoted
Theodore Parker saying,

00:09:32.677 --> 00:09:36.868
"The arc of the moral universe is long,
and it bends toward justice."

00:09:36.892 --> 00:09:38.470
We've all heard this quote.

00:09:39.502 --> 00:09:41.422
But somebody has to bend it.

00:09:42.997 --> 00:09:46.961
The possibility that we create
in this movement and others

00:09:46.985 --> 00:09:50.258
is the weight leaning that arc
in the right direction.

00:09:50.735 --> 00:09:52.909
Movements create possibility,

00:09:53.896 --> 00:09:55.734
and they are built on vision.

00:09:57.138 --> 00:09:59.393
My vision for the Me Too Movement

00:09:59.417 --> 00:10:04.209
is a part of a collective vision
to see a world free of sexual violence,

00:10:05.013 --> 00:10:07.379
and I believe we can build that world.

00:10:07.403 --> 00:10:08.754
Full stop.

00:10:10.117 --> 00:10:12.311
But in order to get there,

00:10:12.335 --> 00:10:17.857
we have to dramatically shift
a culture that propagates the idea

00:10:17.881 --> 00:10:20.788
that vulnerability
is synonymous with permission

00:10:21.991 --> 00:10:25.514
and that bodily autonomy
is not a basic human right.

00:10:27.017 --> 00:10:32.000
In other words, we have to dismantle
the building blocks of sexual violence:

00:10:33.151 --> 00:10:35.611
power and privilege.

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:40.375
So much of what we hear
about the Me Too Movement

00:10:40.399 --> 00:10:45.454
is about individual bad actors
or depraved, isolated behavior,

00:10:46.705 --> 00:10:49.062
and it fails to recognize

00:10:49.086 --> 00:10:53.040
that anybody in a position of power
comes with privilege,

00:10:53.064 --> 00:10:55.517
and it renders those without that power

00:10:55.541 --> 00:10:56.699
more vulnerable.

00:10:57.952 --> 00:11:01.356
Teachers and students,
coaches and athletes,

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:05.063
law enforcement and citizen,
parent and child:

00:11:05.943 --> 00:11:10.253
these are all relationships that can have
an incredible imbalance of power.

00:11:12.475 --> 00:11:18.499
But we reshape that imbalance
by speaking out against it in unison

00:11:18.523 --> 00:11:21.332
and by creating spaces
to speak truth to power.

00:11:22.917 --> 00:11:26.513
We have to reeducate ourselves
and our children

00:11:26.537 --> 00:11:32.563
to understand that power and privilege
doesn't always have to destroy and take --

00:11:33.286 --> 00:11:35.817
it can be used to serve and build.

00:11:37.019 --> 00:11:43.038
And we have to reeducate ourselves
to understand that, unequivocally,

00:11:43.062 --> 00:11:46.634
every human being has the right
to walk through this life

00:11:46.658 --> 00:11:48.744
with their full humanity intact.

00:11:51.554 --> 00:11:54.255
Part of the work of the Me Too Movement

00:11:54.279 --> 00:11:57.491
is about the restoration
of that humanity for survivors,

00:11:59.059 --> 00:12:01.479
because the violence
doesn't end with the act.

00:12:02.633 --> 00:12:06.077
The violence is also the trauma
that we hold after the act.

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:10.302
Remember, trauma halts possibility.

00:12:11.437 --> 00:12:15.987
It serves to impede,

00:12:16.011 --> 00:12:19.209
stagnate, confuse and kill.

00:12:21.498 --> 00:12:24.997
So our work rethinks
how we deal with trauma.

00:12:26.241 --> 00:12:28.432
For instance, we don't believe

00:12:28.456 --> 00:12:33.502
that survivors should tell the details
of their stories all the time.

00:12:35.063 --> 00:12:38.460
We shouldn't have to perform
our pain over and over again

00:12:38.484 --> 00:12:40.316
for the sake of your awareness.

00:12:42.006 --> 00:12:47.354
We also try to teach survivors
to not lean into their trauma,

00:12:47.378 --> 00:12:51.164
but to lean into the joy
that they curate in their lives instead.

00:12:52.302 --> 00:12:55.801
And if you don't find it,
create it and lean into that.

00:12:57.286 --> 00:13:00.420
But when your life
has been touched by trauma,

00:13:00.444 --> 00:13:05.237
sometimes trying to find joy
feels like an insurmountable task.

00:13:06.598 --> 00:13:08.940
Now imagine trying to complete that task

00:13:08.964 --> 00:13:12.603
while world leaders
are discrediting your memories

00:13:12.627 --> 00:13:15.857
or the news media
keeps erasing your experience,

00:13:15.881 --> 00:13:18.809
or people continuously
reduce you to your pain.

00:13:21.201 --> 00:13:24.390
Movement activates possibility.

00:13:27.299 --> 00:13:31.290
There's folklore in my family,
like most black folks,

00:13:31.314 --> 00:13:34.227
about my great-great-grandaddy,
Lawrence Ware.

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:37.321
He was born enslaved,

00:13:38.186 --> 00:13:40.203
his parents were enslaved,

00:13:40.227 --> 00:13:43.450
and he had no reason to believe
that a black man in America

00:13:43.474 --> 00:13:44.964
wouldn't die a slave.

00:13:46.434 --> 00:13:47.584
And yet,

00:13:48.404 --> 00:13:51.848
legend has it that when he was freed
by his enslavers,

00:13:51.872 --> 00:13:56.888
he walked from Georgia to South Carolina

00:13:56.912 --> 00:14:00.332
so that he could find the wife and child
that he was separated from.

00:14:01.114 --> 00:14:04.255
And every time I hear this story,
I think to myself,

00:14:04.279 --> 00:14:05.880
"How could he do this?

00:14:05.904 --> 00:14:09.921
Wasn't he afraid that he would be captured
and killed by white vigilantes,

00:14:09.945 --> 00:14:12.117
or he would get there
and they would be gone?"

00:14:13.106 --> 00:14:15.147
And so I asked my grandmother once

00:14:15.171 --> 00:14:18.353
why she thought
that he took this journey up,

00:14:18.377 --> 00:14:19.527
and she said,

00:14:20.491 --> 00:14:22.658
"I guess he had to believe
it was possible."

00:14:24.518 --> 00:14:28.066
I have been propelled by possibility
for most of my life.

00:14:29.542 --> 00:14:33.721
I am here because somebody,
starting with my ancestors,

00:14:33.745 --> 00:14:35.454
believed I was possible.

00:14:38.193 --> 00:14:40.827
In 2006, 12 years ago,

00:14:41.789 --> 00:14:46.238
I laid across a mattress on my floor
in my one-bedroom apartment,

00:14:47.109 --> 00:14:51.326
frustrated with all the sexual violence
that I saw in my community.

00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:55.061
I pulled out a piece of paper,
and I wrote "Me Too" on the top of it,

00:14:56.224 --> 00:14:58.867
and I proceeded
to write out an action plan

00:14:58.891 --> 00:15:03.463
for building a movement
based on empathy between survivors

00:15:03.487 --> 00:15:05.566
that would help us feel like we can heal,

00:15:06.369 --> 00:15:09.623
that we weren't the sum total
of the things that happened to us.

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:13.874
Possibility is a gift, y'all.

00:15:14.443 --> 00:15:16.592
It births new worlds,

00:15:16.616 --> 00:15:18.573
and it births visions.

00:15:20.419 --> 00:15:21.981
I know some of y'all are tired,

00:15:23.107 --> 00:15:24.257
because I'm tired.

00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:26.490
I'm exhausted,

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:29.070
and I'm numb.

00:15:30.542 --> 00:15:32.851
Those who came before us
didn't win every fight,

00:15:34.255 --> 00:15:36.477
but they didn't let it kill their vision.

00:15:37.087 --> 00:15:38.237
It fueled it.

00:15:39.578 --> 00:15:40.826
So I can't stop,

00:15:41.942 --> 00:15:44.577
and I'm asking you not to stop either.

00:15:45.795 --> 00:15:51.271
We owe future generations
a world free of sexual violence.

00:15:52.121 --> 00:15:54.216
I believe we can build that world.

00:15:55.202 --> 00:15:56.352
Do you?

00:15:57.684 --> 00:15:58.835
Thank you.

00:15:58.859 --> 00:16:05.859
(Applause)
