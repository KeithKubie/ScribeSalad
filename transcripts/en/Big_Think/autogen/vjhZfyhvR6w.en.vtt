behavior now the amygdala on the other
 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.550
behavior now the amygdala on the other
hand really causes behavior and normally

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560

they're in balance they inhibit each
 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.430
they're in balance they inhibit each
other now in a psychopath they're both

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440
other now in a psychopath they're both
 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.960
other now in a psychopath they're both
turned off so they don't inhibit each

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970
turned off so they don't inhibit each
 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.210
turned off so they don't inhibit each
other and they don't regulate it so the

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220
other and they don't regulate it so the
 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.570

there's a time for aggression there's a

there's a time for aggression there's a
time for killing even so time for sex

time for killing even so time for sex

and part of it is how the rest of the

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930

now Psychopaths don't have that they're

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:35.519
now Psychopaths don't have that they're
 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:37.280
now Psychopaths don't have that they're
doing things completely out of context

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290
doing things completely out of context
 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.840
doing things completely out of context
out of social context and that's the

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850
out of social context and that's the
 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.030
out of social context and that's the
problem usually the question is what

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040
problem usually the question is what
 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.190
problem usually the question is what
percent do you think it's due to

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200
percent do you think it's due to
 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.780
percent do you think it's due to
genetics and what percent is due to

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790
genetics and what percent is due to
 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.280
genetics and what percent is due to
environment and it turns out not to be

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290
environment and it turns out not to be
 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.040
environment and it turns out not to be
the great question to ask because the it

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050
the great question to ask because the it
 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.560
the great question to ask because the it
looks like the answer is if you are born

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570
looks like the answer is if you are born
 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.979
looks like the answer is if you are born
with the biological markers for

with the biological markers for
 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.289
with the biological markers for
psychopathy for example that is the

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299
psychopathy for example that is the
 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:00.110
psychopathy for example that is the

early on if you are a susceptible kid

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769
early on if you are a susceptible kid
 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.640
early on if you are a susceptible kid
then environment means everything it

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650
then environment means everything it
 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.220
then environment means everything it
means a lot maybe 80% because those kids

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230
means a lot maybe 80% because those kids
 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:11.870
means a lot maybe 80% because those kids
can be really thrown off track and they

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880
can be really thrown off track and they
 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.220
can be really thrown off track and they
can be helped by a good environment too

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.990
 
back in the early 90s some of my college

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000
back in the early 90s some of my college
 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
back in the early 90s some of my college
was studying these killers real bad guys

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010
was studying these killers real bad guys
 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.280
was studying these killers real bad guys
but some serial killers nest to get guys

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290
but some serial killers nest to get guys
 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.170
but some serial killers nest to get guys
and they asked me to come in to look at

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180
and they asked me to come in to look at
 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.970
and they asked me to come in to look at
the brains so I put myself and some

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980
the brains so I put myself and some
 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.280
the brains so I put myself and some
other people in his normals I got to the

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290
other people in his normals I got to the
 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.380
other people in his normals I got to the
last scan and I looked at it and it was

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390
last scan and I looked at it and it was
 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.960
last scan and I looked at it and it was
like completely pathological and I told

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970
like completely pathological and I told
 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.640
like completely pathological and I told
the technician I said you got this mixed

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650
the technician I said you got this mixed
 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.280
the technician I said you got this mixed
up this obviously you know a psychopath

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290
up this obviously you know a psychopath
 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:39.960
up this obviously you know a psychopath
or one of the killers we just mix the
