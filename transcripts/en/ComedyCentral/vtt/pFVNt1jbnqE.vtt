00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.154
Tonight I'ma tell you how
my big titties saved my life.

00:00:54.188 --> 00:00:58.158
[cheers and applause]

00:00:58.192 --> 00:01:02.496
So, it was the summer of 1988.

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:06.166
I'm 16 years old,

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.901
I got two kids,
two and one years old,

00:01:07.935 --> 00:01:09.970
and I'm living in the hood
in Atlanta.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.273
And in this hood, you know,
I'm trying to survive.

00:01:13.307 --> 00:01:15.976
So, I go out
and start me a small business.

00:01:16.076 --> 00:01:17.511
Well, I was selling crack,

00:01:17.544 --> 00:01:20.080
but we gonna call it
a small business tonight.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.283
Okay, white people?

00:01:23.317 --> 00:01:25.352
'Cause when you 16 years old
in the hood

00:01:25.385 --> 00:01:26.920
and you got two kids,

00:01:26.954 --> 00:01:29.089
there's only two things
you can do for a job.

00:01:29.089 --> 00:01:30.858
Either sell drugs
or sell your body.

00:01:30.891 --> 00:01:34.528
So, I did the one
that paid the most.

00:01:34.561 --> 00:01:36.463
So, I had to advertise
this business.

00:01:36.496 --> 00:01:38.198
And I couldn't go out, you know,

00:01:38.232 --> 00:01:40.367
and try to get no [bleep]
commercial or no flashy signs

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.102
or no shit like that.

00:01:42.135 --> 00:01:44.771
So, I had to advertise the way
we do in the hood.

00:01:44.805 --> 00:01:49.443
I went out and bought me
a 1980 Fleetwood Cadillac

00:01:49.476 --> 00:01:52.312
from the junkyard for $500.

00:01:52.346 --> 00:01:55.215
And I put $9,500 into it.

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:57.217
Rims and paint.

00:01:57.251 --> 00:02:00.320
So, I take this car
and I paint it pearl white,

00:02:00.354 --> 00:02:02.523
with 1,001 gold flakes in it.

00:02:02.556 --> 00:02:04.691
And white people, you probably
don't know what the hell

00:02:04.725 --> 00:02:06.293
I'm talking about,
but when you got a paint job

00:02:06.326 --> 00:02:10.497
with 1,001 gold flakes,
you the shit in the hood.

00:02:10.531 --> 00:02:13.400
So, I'm sitting in my car
one day with one of my clients,

00:02:13.433 --> 00:02:18.639
running inventory
through my small business.

00:02:18.672 --> 00:02:20.474
I always had to keep a client
in the car with me,

00:02:20.507 --> 00:02:22.743
'cause I was 16 years old
with a learner's permit,

00:02:22.776 --> 00:02:23.977
and I didn't want to risk
the chance

00:02:24.077 --> 00:02:26.980
of losing my [bleep] permit.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.417
[laughter]

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.253
So, I'm sitting there one day,
and one of my rivals walk up,

00:02:33.287 --> 00:02:34.855
and he hit the back of my car.

00:02:34.888 --> 00:02:36.990
And he's just yell, Rabbit,

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.993
get the hell out of the car
with your fat ass.

00:02:40.093 --> 00:02:41.762
Now, Rabbit is my hood name.

00:02:41.795 --> 00:02:43.597
'Cause you can't go
by your real name in the hood.

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.934
Patricia don't sound tough
at all.

00:02:46.967 --> 00:02:48.702
I get out the car
and we arguing,

00:02:48.735 --> 00:02:51.171
and he [bleep] spit on my car.

00:02:51.205 --> 00:02:52.739
Now, it wasn't a regular spit,
people.

00:02:52.773 --> 00:02:54.608
'Cause I wouldn't have got mad.

00:02:54.641 --> 00:02:59.413
It was the type of spit that
he pulled from his damn navel.

00:02:59.446 --> 00:03:01.048
The first thing
I'm thinking, like,

00:03:01.081 --> 00:03:06.286
this [bleep] done [bleep]
chipped one of my gold flakes.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.755
I paid a lot of money
for that paint job.

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:11.225
So, I go to my car
'cause I got to be tough,

00:03:11.258 --> 00:03:12.793
and I'm a girl.
I reach in the car

00:03:12.826 --> 00:03:14.595
and grab my baby bag,

00:03:14.628 --> 00:03:15.796
and I move the Pampers over.

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:17.531
Then I move the crack over.

00:03:17.564 --> 00:03:21.368
Then I get my pistol.

00:03:21.401 --> 00:03:22.736
'Cause you know
I'm a good mama.

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.306
You got to keep all the shit
together.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.774
And so I take my gun

00:03:27.808 --> 00:03:29.743
and I stick it to his dick.

00:03:29.776 --> 00:03:32.212
And I said, now,
get that shit off of my car

00:03:32.246 --> 00:03:36.283
before I turn your dick
into a blooming onion.

00:03:36.316 --> 00:03:38.285
[laughter]

00:03:38.318 --> 00:03:39.720
He wiped the spit off.

00:03:39.753 --> 00:03:41.455
And I said, now,
get the hell out of here.

00:03:41.488 --> 00:03:42.956
He walks away.

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:44.458
He get halfway up the hill
and he turn around

00:03:44.491 --> 00:03:45.759
and he was, like,
when I come back, bitch,

00:03:45.792 --> 00:03:47.461
I'ma kill you.

00:03:47.494 --> 00:03:48.962
Now, I'm from the hood.
You hear that shit every day.

00:03:48.996 --> 00:03:51.665
You don't believe it
till they lay you down.

00:03:51.698 --> 00:03:54.601
White people, don't let
this white guilt get you, okay?

00:03:54.635 --> 00:03:58.972
Relax, this shit is funny.

00:03:59.006 --> 00:04:00.474
And five minutes later,

00:04:00.507 --> 00:04:01.775
I'm serving customers
and he come back.

00:04:01.808 --> 00:04:03.443
Now, he's shooting.

00:04:03.477 --> 00:04:04.845
Now, I don't know
if you ever been in a shootout

00:04:04.878 --> 00:04:06.480
with black people before,

00:04:06.513 --> 00:04:08.115
but when they come
down the hill and they running

00:04:08.148 --> 00:04:11.852
and they shoot, I think
that make the bullets go faster.

00:04:11.885 --> 00:04:14.621
[laughter]

00:04:14.655 --> 00:04:16.156
But I want to shoot back

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:17.925
'cause I got my pistol
in my hand.

00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:19.626
But what I realized,

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.329
my pistol wouldn't shoot
because the shit was on safety.

00:04:22.362 --> 00:04:24.264
Now, I don't know if you ever
been in a shootout before,

00:04:24.298 --> 00:04:26.066
but if you're ever in a shootout
and you shooting,

00:04:26.066 --> 00:04:29.369
and your shit on safety, you
not in a shootout any longer.

00:04:29.403 --> 00:04:31.505
[laughter]

00:04:31.538 --> 00:04:34.141
You being shot at.

00:04:34.174 --> 00:04:36.844
So, I take off running,
and I'm running down the hill,

00:04:36.877 --> 00:04:40.514
and my [bleep] titties
just flying in my face.

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:43.650
And I'm trying
to hold my titties down.

00:04:43.684 --> 00:04:44.985
'Cause you know,
these titties young.

00:04:45.085 --> 00:04:49.356
They took off running
before I did.

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:51.825
I run down the hill,
and I jumped over this fence,

00:04:51.859 --> 00:04:53.660
and I run into
my girlfriend house.

00:04:53.694 --> 00:04:56.363
She was, like, why you got blood
all over your shirt?

00:04:56.396 --> 00:04:58.498
And I look down
and I'm, like, damn.

00:04:58.532 --> 00:05:02.703
I done snagged
my [bleep] nipple on the fence.

00:05:02.736 --> 00:05:05.506
She called 911, y'all,
and the EMT pull up.

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:07.741
A little white guy, and he
was, like, ma'am, what happened?

00:05:07.774 --> 00:05:11.311
I'm, like, I think I snagged
my [bleep] nipple on the fence.

00:05:11.345 --> 00:05:13.580
[laughter]

00:05:13.614 --> 00:05:15.883
So, the EMT guy
tried to take my bra off.

00:05:15.916 --> 00:05:17.584
And, you know,
I got a big set of titties.

00:05:17.618 --> 00:05:21.522
I've had these same titties
since the third grade.

00:05:21.555 --> 00:05:23.390
So, he's back there
trying to take my bra off

00:05:23.423 --> 00:05:25.192
and he's struggling like hell.

00:05:25.225 --> 00:05:26.927
I was, like, oh, evidently, you
never dealt with real titties.

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.098
Let me give you a hand, EMT.

00:05:31.131 --> 00:05:32.766
So, I had to bend my back in

00:05:32.799 --> 00:05:36.270
where my back titties
will help him unbutton my bra.

00:05:36.303 --> 00:05:38.572
[laughter]

00:05:38.605 --> 00:05:41.074
So, he take my bra loose,
and then my right titty

00:05:41.074 --> 00:05:45.212
just fall out
like it was in a drive-by.

00:05:45.245 --> 00:05:48.515
So, he picked it up and he was,
like, I think you've been shot.

00:05:48.549 --> 00:05:50.584
I was, like,
you think I've been shot?

00:05:50.617 --> 00:05:52.853
So, he lift my arm up and he
was, like, you got an entrance

00:05:52.886 --> 00:05:54.421
and it came out
through your nipple.

00:05:54.454 --> 00:05:56.089
That's your exit.

00:05:56.123 --> 00:06:00.827
So, I'm thinking, like,
this [bleep] blew my nip off?

00:06:00.861 --> 00:06:03.830
Like a bull's-eye?

00:06:03.864 --> 00:06:05.065
And so he's, like,

00:06:05.098 --> 00:06:06.667
I need to get you
to the hospital.

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:08.335
So, I get to the hospital,
y'all,

00:06:08.368 --> 00:06:10.370
and the doctor examined
my titty and he was, like,

00:06:10.404 --> 00:06:12.039
ma'am, he blew your nip off.

00:06:12.072 --> 00:06:16.210
I'm, like, I [bleep] heard.

00:06:16.243 --> 00:06:19.046
He was, like, well, ma'am,
you really lucky.

00:06:19.046 --> 00:06:23.050
Because if you was a A-cup,
you would have died.

00:06:23.083 --> 00:06:27.754
Them little titties
would've got you killed, baby.

00:06:27.788 --> 00:06:32.059
These real titties.
They save life.

00:06:32.059 --> 00:06:32.125
Thank you all so much.
I'm Ms. Pat.
