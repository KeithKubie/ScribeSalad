the for the they are a very small
segment of the market and the rest of

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060
segment of the market and the rest of
 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.070
segment of the market and the rest of
the market 95% plus of the people it

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.080
the market 95% plus of the people it
 

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.920
the market 95% plus of the people it
just wasn't so appealing to them so the

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930
just wasn't so appealing to them so the
 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.649
just wasn't so appealing to them so the

and are very green and they're sort of
 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.300
and are very green and they're sort of
that whole markets soul too so I figured

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310
that whole markets soul too so I figured
 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.149
that whole markets soul too so I figured
if it was to going to go larger then it

00:04:38.149 --> 00:04:38.159
if it was to going to go larger then it
 

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:40.129
if it was to going to go larger then it
really need to become more modern and

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:40.139
really need to become more modern and
 

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:43.219
really need to become more modern and
contemporary and and and have an

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:45.350
contemporary and and and have an
aesthetic that would appeal to much more

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360
aesthetic that would appeal to much more
 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.700
aesthetic that would appeal to much more
of the population so that was sort of

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710
of the population so that was sort of
 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:53.390
of the population so that was sort of
the first one the second problem i saw

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400
the first one the second problem i saw
 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:59.059
the first one the second problem i saw
was that I'm a busy guy and I live in

00:04:59.059 --> 00:04:59.069
was that I'm a busy guy and I live in
 

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:02.659
was that I'm a busy guy and I live in
New York and I work very hard and so I'm

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:02.669
New York and I work very hard and so I'm
 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:06.469
New York and I work very hard and so I'm
running from thing to thing and on the

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:06.479
running from thing to thing and on the
 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:09.499
running from thing to thing and on the
weekends if I'm able to get any time off

00:05:09.499 --> 00:05:09.509
weekends if I'm able to get any time off
 

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:12.140
weekends if I'm able to get any time off
you know I want to want to relax and see

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150
you know I want to want to relax and see
 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.200
you know I want to want to relax and see
my friends and do this sort of stuff so

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.210
my friends and do this sort of stuff so
 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:17.480
my friends and do this sort of stuff so
real challenge at that point was it

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490
real challenge at that point was it
 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:19.999
real challenge at that point was it
really wasn't convenient so convenience

00:05:19.999 --> 00:05:20.009
really wasn't convenient so convenience
 

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:22.159
really wasn't convenient so convenience
is the real killer and I think you

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:22.169
is the real killer and I think you
 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:24.920
is the real killer and I think you
really need to make it easy so if I

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930
really need to make it easy so if I
 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:26.659
really need to make it easy so if I
needed to find that pair of organic

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:26.669
needed to find that pair of organic
 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:29.779
needed to find that pair of organic

00:05:32.209 --> 00:05:32.219
figure out you know posted by a hybrid
 

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:34.159
figure out you know posted by a hybrid
car or something these are activities

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:34.169
car or something these are activities
 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:36.589
car or something these are activities
that would take hours and hours and so

00:05:36.589 --> 00:05:36.599
that would take hours and hours and so
 

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:38.240
that would take hours and hours and so
ultimately they just wouldn't end up

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.250
ultimately they just wouldn't end up
 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:40.159
ultimately they just wouldn't end up
happening or wouldn't end up happening

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:40.169
happening or wouldn't end up happening
 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:42.559
happening or wouldn't end up happening
enough so the second problem that I saw

00:05:42.559 --> 00:05:42.569
enough so the second problem that I saw
 

00:05:42.569 --> 00:05:44.240
enough so the second problem that I saw
was just one of convenience we really

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.250
was just one of convenience we really
 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:50.180
was just one of convenience we really
needed to make it convenient

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:50.190
 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:56.810
the third was a lot of environmentalism

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:56.820
the third was a lot of environmentalism
 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:59.990
the third was a lot of environmentalism
to that point had been about no had been

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000
to that point had been about no had been
 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.810
to that point had been about no had been
about the sky is falling had been about

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:02.820
about the sky is falling had been about
 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:06.680
about the sky is falling had been about
inspired by fear and I actually think

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:06.690
inspired by fear and I actually think
 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:09.350
inspired by fear and I actually think
that's we need a whole bunch of

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.360
that's we need a whole bunch of
 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.640
that's we need a whole bunch of
approaches to this problem and that

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:10.650
approaches to this problem and that
 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:12.110
approaches to this problem and that
approach is actually really important

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:12.120
approach is actually really important
 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.610
approach is actually really important
it's important for you to understand the

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:13.620
it's important for you to understand the
 

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:15.740
it's important for you to understand the
gravity of the situation and that there

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:15.750
gravity of the situation and that there
 

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:17.810
gravity of the situation and that there
are major issues and all that's very

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:17.820
are major issues and all that's very
 

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:19.820
are major issues and all that's very
important but I think there are also

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:19.830
important but I think there are also
 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:23.450
important but I think there are also
people who are looking for great so what

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:23.460
people who are looking for great so what
 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.070
people who are looking for great so what
next how do we move how to move forward

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:25.080
next how do we move how to move forward
 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.530
next how do we move how to move forward
and they're looking for yes that are

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:27.540
and they're looking for yes that are
 

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:30.230
and they're looking for yes that are
looking for inspired by hope and I think

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.240
looking for inspired by hope and I think
 

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:33.680
looking for inspired by hope and I think
I'm one of those people and so what I

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:33.690
I'm one of those people and so what I
 

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:37.190
I'm one of those people and so what I
figured was if one could create a site

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:37.200
figured was if one could create a site
 

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:41.030
figured was if one could create a site
that would aggregate all this modern

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:41.040
that would aggregate all this modern
 

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:43.130
that would aggregate all this modern
green sort of different aesthetic that

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:43.140
green sort of different aesthetic that
 

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:44.840
green sort of different aesthetic that
was starting to appear on a global basis

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:44.850
was starting to appear on a global basis
 

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:48.290
was starting to appear on a global basis
in one place make it very convenient for

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:48.300
in one place make it very convenient for
 

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.570
in one place make it very convenient for
people such that they could not spend a

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:50.580
people such that they could not spend a
 

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:52.160
people such that they could not spend a
ton of time and still no their lives in

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:52.170
ton of time and still no their lives in
 

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:53.690
ton of time and still no their lives in
the green direction and just make it

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:53.700
the green direction and just make it
 

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:56.260
the green direction and just make it
really positive and solutions oriented

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:56.270
really positive and solutions oriented
 

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:59.720
really positive and solutions oriented
that it would appeal to a market and it

00:06:59.720 --> 00:06:59.730
that it would appeal to a market and it
 

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:02.840
that it would appeal to a market and it
would really help green go mainstream so

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:02.850
would really help green go mainstream so
 

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:07.040
would really help green go mainstream so
that was the basic thinking and so I in

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:07.050
that was the basic thinking and so I in
 

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:12.650
that was the basic thinking and so I in
94 94 in 2004 really got together and

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:12.660
94 94 in 2004 really got together and
