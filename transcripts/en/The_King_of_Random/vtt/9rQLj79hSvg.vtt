00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
Hey Good Morning my friends Welcome Back Today I have A very Short and Sweet Video for you I've got an Experimental Prototype of A

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.949
Project I was working With last nights that I want to reveal and Share With you for the first Time now you might Remember These

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.080
Things These Are Silicone Pokeball Molds that

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.580
We made in A previous Project and ever Since I made them I've Been Inundated with requests to cast

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.420
Chocolate Pokeballs so Last Night I did Decide To try Something on in Those lines but

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.819
Was a little bit of A twist let me Show you what i mean I?

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:26.939
Love the Way that this Just Peels Apart

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.769
Almost Effortlessly and That Looks Pretty Cool Right There

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:34.529
other Side Here

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.480
Oop There, We go there it Is that Looks Pretty cool?

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:45.719
Looking Good

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:47.950
and

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.719
There's The Relief

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:56.309
Look at that Guy's A beautiful Battle-Tested Chocolate Pokeball that Looks Amazing but There's One other Characteristic that I'm Really Proud

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.759
Of that I want to show you next the cool thing about These pokÃ©balls not only are They

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.340
Made of Dark Chocolate but if you listen Closely and Give Them a shake

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.719
You Can Actually Hear a liquid Sloshing Around on the Inside

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.950
Actually does Sound Really cool

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.780
So what Could Possibly be on the Inside this Is what I'm Most excited to show you?

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.409
Now I just went out and Randomly Found this Rock with a relatively Sharp

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.589
Edge On it and I like the curve on this Because i Can stick my finger on it for Leverage

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.629
Let's Use This Little Improvised tool to go Ahead and Crack the pokeball so, we Can split it Into Two Halves, oh?

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:32.009
Look at that Look at that

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.000
On the inside We Actually Have Coconut Water and

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.699
Different Layers of Colors Too we've Got Brown white we've got this Liquidy stuff as, well

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:47.630
Hmm

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.330
The Really Cool Thing About This Liquidy Stuff

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:54.549
Is it's not Water it's Actually Sprite you Can see where I cracked it on the Top There it just Kind of Flaked away

00:01:54.799 --> 00:02:00.879
But it Made A Relatively Clean Crack Around the rest of it the chocolate wasn't super Thick but that Could be Easily?

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.279
Accomplished By Just Leaving the Chocolate in A little bit Longer

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:05.090
So that's good to know

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.489
Now Just for fun I did go Ahead and Make two of These that means we've got a second, one We Can crack here

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:11.489
We go chi who

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:19.300
Oops There Goes There, We go beautiful the coolest thing is the Shell Is Edible as well?

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.090
And what I really love about These things They Emulate a coconut very

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.580
Well the Only Difference Is They're Completely Made of Candy?

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.350
Dark Chocolate on the Outside White Chocolate on the inside and Fill the Sprite how cool Is that

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:40.059
But We Made These using pokeball molds so rather than Calling them Coconut I think it might [Be] more Appropriate to Call them pokey nut

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:41.170
So how

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.230
do

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.220
We get the Sprite to stay Inside I'm not going to tell you in This Video Because I think you're smart Enough to Figure it
