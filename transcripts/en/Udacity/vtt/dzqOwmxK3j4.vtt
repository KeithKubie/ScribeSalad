00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.620
The most important thing to keep in mind

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.370
about data cleaning, is that it's an iterative process.

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.610
We iterate on first detecting, and then correcting bad

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.750
records. Let's look at some examples. We might have

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.580
text where we expect to find numeric data. So

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.900
the word two instead of the number two. Some

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.190
data items might not be designed according to our

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:25.160
specification. They might be missing entire fields. They might

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.450
have extra fields. Or, for example with JSON documents, fields

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.150
might not have the structure we expect at all. We

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.380
might have numbers that are out of range. How many

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.880
people do you know who are minus three years of age?

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.890
The mighty outliers compared to a standard distribution. We might

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.780
have an American expatriate in the London office who did

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.440
some data entry, and coded in a few dates using

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.970
the U.S. format when the system was expecting the European format.
