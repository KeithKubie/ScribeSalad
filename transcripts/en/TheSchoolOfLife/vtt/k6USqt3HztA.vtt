00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.140
Given how things are with ourselves and the world,

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.460
one of the great questions we face is

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.800
should we laugh or should we cry?

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.100
The history of philosophy has an interesting take on the choice.

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.560
Two of the greatest thinkers of ancient Greece

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.080
were Democritus and Heraclitus.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.180
Both men, who lived to a very old age, had a deep knowledge of people and the world

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.100
but responded to what they knew

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.100
in strikingly different ways.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.600
Heraclitus couldn't stop weeping.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.740
Democritus couldn't stop laughing.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.740
It's obvious why Heraclitus cried.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.900
Once we open our eyes fully to the reality of existence

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.440
it's astonishing we can ever carry on.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.260
There is simply so much to be sad about.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.960
The human animal is a benighted, deluded, uncontrolled monster,

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.520
perfectly suited to the error of meanness and suffering.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.640
The greater question is how and why one would ever laugh.

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.420
There is of course always the option of idiotic laugh, the plastic laugh

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.800
the sentimental callous foul.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.360
But this wasn't the philosopher Democritus' way,

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.920
he laughed richly and generously

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.820
not because some privileged position led him to naively misunderstand how bad things could be.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.320
His good humor wasn't delusional

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.620
nor was it simply a random quark of temperament.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.380
Democritus, laughed in a very particular

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.300
and highly admirable style because of the way he thought about the world.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.540
He was a profound realist.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.780
He knew everything there is to know, about the human tendency to greed, murder and lust

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.880
and of our constant exposure to random accident and misfortune.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.880
And ultimately Democritus was so convinced of the darkness,

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.560
he knew so much about suffering and risk,

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.240
he no longer felt he had to register this constantly at the front of his mind

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.240
in order to do them justice.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.220
They seem to him an entirely obvious baseline fact about existence.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.980
He could be cheerful, because anything nice, sweet or charming that came his way,

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.500
was immediately experienced as a bonus,

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.960
a gratifying addition to an originally bleak starting point.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.480
By keeping the dark backdrop of life always in mind,

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.880
Democritus sharpened his appreciation

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.900
of whatever stood out against it.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
A pleasant thing that happened to him

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.800
wasn't taken to be a feeble compensation for his larger dashed hopes.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.500
It was a delightful, slightly improbable, but very noteworthy backing

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.340
of an always expected tragic trend.

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.640
Democritus who's learned to enjoying parties

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:38.900
wine and drinking.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.920
"A life without festivity is a long road without an inn" he wrote.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.960
He didn't believe that he had to feel constantly sad

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.620
to prove that he recognized life to be sad.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.700
He danced and drunk because of a rightful confidence that he had already done justice

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.200
and would in the future again have to fully do justice

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.440
to the sadness of things.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.140
Democritus was aiming at an intelligent kind of cheerfulness

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.900
one that admits from the outset that life is fundamentally grim

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.720
but that uses this despair as a catalyst

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.800
for a more vivid engagement with the beautiful or kind moments that do come ones way.

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:23.080
Like an English person who is especially adept to drawing value from the last day of summer

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:28.880
or a condemned man who perfectly savors the last meal before being let to the firing squad.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.000
Democritus was a master practitioner of that highly admirable state of mind:

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.380
Cheerful despair.

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.700
Once we've acquired the skill of cheerful despair

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.900
life acquires a distinctive new kind of sweetness

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.900
in all its pleasant structures.

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.560
Every pain free day is a blessing.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.300
We're amazed and touched

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.660
when once in a while someone seems to understand a few things we say or

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.040
does something unexpectedly kind.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.620
We enjoy the distinctive cheerfulness of those who've done all the crying they can

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.340
and are determined, for a while at least,

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.620
to hold on to the light.
