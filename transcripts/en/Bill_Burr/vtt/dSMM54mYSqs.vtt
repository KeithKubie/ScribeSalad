This is the one and only comic legend rich shiner who has a new book.

13
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.570
He's here to plug,
um,
that I actually got a couple months ago,

14
00:00:41.571 --> 00:00:43.070
but my wife was so goddamn pregnant.

15
00:00:43.071 --> 00:00:46.100
I've only been able to read bits and pieces of it.
I read all of,

16
00:00:46.101 --> 00:00:50.930
I killed in 2006.
He's got a book called,
uh,
kicking through the ashes,

17
00:00:50.931 --> 00:00:54.950
my life as a standup in the 1980s comedy boom,

18
00:00:54.951 --> 00:00:57.650
which personally is my favorite,
Eric,

19
00:00:57.651 --> 00:01:02.180
because I watched all of it and that was in,
that made me want to be a comedian.

20
00:01:02.181 --> 00:01:06.380
And all that.
So rich,
welcome.
Welcome to the podcast bill.
Um,
I got to ask,

21
00:01:06.381 --> 00:01:09.860
so what year did you start officially as a comedian?

22
00:01:09.861 --> 00:01:11.530
Cause everybody always has their,
yeah,
yeah,

23
00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.450
well I did two open mics and I went to college for a semester.

24
00:01:14.451 --> 00:01:16.920
People always tried it.
They always tried to delay when they stuff.

25
00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.680
So I feel I really want me doing it six months.
They're like fucking 52.

26
00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:23.690
So when is your official?

27
00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.690
Uh,

28
00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.390

D C there are no comedy clubs.
I was going to say like w where was their to Gig?

30
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.100
Yeah,

a friend of mine,

it was funny and he said,
you're funny,

31
00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.761
you've got to do this.

32
00:01:37.761 --> 00:01:39.830
I don't even know if we knew to call it stand up cause it's gonna take you down

33
00:01:39.831 --> 00:01:43.040
dude,
we can do this.
You know,
you could do it that comedy at this plan,

34
00:01:43.041 --> 00:01:46.610
you were in law school and law school and a,
and a,

35
00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.360
it was an ego on a coffee house.
It was just this basement in a church.

36
00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.500
You know what mean?
Just all talent nights.
Right.
And I and I found a poet,

37
00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.760
I still had the tape cause my brother didn't have the tape and the tape,

38
00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.870
the audio,
video,
audio,
just audio,
just you know,
his big black box cassettes,

39
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.550
like a shoe box size cassette player recorder and uh,
and,
and the poet,

40
00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:12.620
his last line was like the mango.
We are ripe for the revolution.
Oh God.

41
00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:13.723
Right.

42
00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.170
<v 1>Okay.
Too late.
Huh?
Zach please.</v>

43
00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.590
<v 2>Mango.
Nobody's talking mango in 77 but you're right way by [inaudible].</v>

44
00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.190
<v 1>Yeah,
the Vietnam was over,
war was over.
He was still trying to do that shit.
Yeah.</v>

45
00:02:25.191 --> 00:02:26.110
So when you guys went,

46
00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.600
that was what fascinated back then because it because of you guys that there was

47
00:02:29.601 --> 00:02:30.381
a comedy club,

48
00:02:30.381 --> 00:02:34.070
your whole generation is the reason why there's a comedy club scene and I've

49
00:02:34.071 --> 00:02:37.520
always like read stuff about Jay Leno and it was just like,
yeah,

50
00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.590
you need to be like,
yeah,
I'd go down to the combat zone,

51
00:02:39.591 --> 00:02:41.060
which was worded like the red light district,

52
00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.670
what Boston used to be and you'd go on between like strip

53
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.380
<v 2>anywhere,
anywhere,
anywhere.
This guy,
Howard Vine,
who took me at first time,</v>

54
00:02:48.381 --> 00:02:50.390
he was like my unofficial,
he says,
I found another place,

55
00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.630
like a talent night called the gay cabaret.
And we were,
so we had,

56
00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.490
we just thought like gay cabaret,
like the Flintstones,

57
00:02:55.491 --> 00:02:58.460
this is the 77 minute closet was packed,
packed.

58
00:02:58.461 --> 00:03:00.220
There was nobody out the closet except

59
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.370
<v 1>my overpopulation pushed out.
Right.
So we could end there.
And it was,
you know,</v>

60
00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.470
it was a gay gay club and the guy was right.
And I said,
hey fellows,
you know,

61
00:03:08.471 --> 00:03:11.680
it's normally a great soap and talent night,
you know,
but,
uh,
this was,

62
00:03:11.681 --> 00:03:14.200
this is ladies night.
We don't want some months we have ladies day and again,

63
00:03:14.201 --> 00:03:17.250
we're so clueless.
We don't get it.
We're like,
ladies,
like,
fantastic man.

64
00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.660
I still don't get it.
What does that mean?
It was lesbians bottoms.

65
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.640
It was lesbians.
Oh,
so lesbian bottoms.
Yeah.
Ladies Nights.
So yeah.

66
00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.060
Wow.
And I go in front of this lesbian crowd.
I mean,
they,
you know,

67
00:03:28.061 --> 00:03:31.820
I'm the reason they're there to hide,
get away from guys like me.
How did it come?

68
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.780
Just a swing.
Oh my God.
I mean,
you know what I mean?
Chill.
I mean,
chill,

69
00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.400
freezing cold.
I mean,
I,
woman took me off stage finally,
just,
I mean,

70
00:03:39.401 --> 00:03:43.300
I got one.
I did,
I was,
I did,
like my buddy told me,
he said,
you said like,

71
00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.980
I guess some of your worst nightmare something and got a kind of a laugh,

72
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.950
but you know,
you know,
student Joy,
I thought,
oh,

73
00:03:47.951 --> 00:03:51.360
that's encouragement to do more instead of take that as your exit.
Yeah.

74
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.730
As a cue that w we,
we didn't come here for this.
Yeah,
you're done.

75
00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.780
And the woman just walked up on stage,
took me by the arm and led me off.

76
00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.590
Just let me up.
Just like [inaudible] I've had that,
you know,
when I started out,

77
00:04:02.591 --> 00:04:05.530
I,
I had a Gig and I,
I didn't know it was a,
I didn't always the gay club,

78
00:04:05.531 --> 00:04:06.364
I just got a Gig.

79
00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.820
The fucking guy didn't tell me the place was called Queen of hearts.

80
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.130
And what killed me was there's only a couple of towns over from,
uh,

81
00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.870
from where I lived.
And,
uh,
like,
yeah.
And that was like still,
it was the eighties,

82
00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.860
early nineties.
I was still like totally like,
uh,
um,
you know,
not accepted.

83
00:04:23.861 --> 00:04:25.480
There was no Billy crystal played,

84
00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.850
but it was like the only guy played a gay character and that whole thing just

85
00:04:27.851 --> 00:04:30.490
like went away.
So when I found out I was all like parenthood,

86
00:04:30.491 --> 00:04:34.390
my trucks out there,
it was all like homophobic,
come over to suck a Dick,
right?

87
00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.560
So I um,
I went there and I was wearing my college,

88
00:04:38.561 --> 00:04:41.620
like sweatshirt came walking in like a 23,

89
00:04:41.621 --> 00:04:45.520
24 year old and I walked by this guy and I forget what the hell he said.

90
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.240
He just said like,
oh my God,
my fantasy or something like that.

91
00:04:49.241 --> 00:04:51.640
And I was just like,
I was like,
wow,
that was really forward.

92
00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.810
So I went down to the end of the bar and uh,

93
00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.030
one of the women I was working with that was like,
I walked in,
she goes,
hey bill,

94
00:04:58.031 --> 00:04:59.620
how are you doing?
I said,
hey.
I said,
guys,

95
00:04:59.621 --> 00:05:02.770
hey that guy down the end of the bar go,
he's a little happy.
She goes,
why?

96
00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.340
I got a guy,
I go down the other bar,
he goes,
I go,
he's a little happy.

97
00:05:06.341 --> 00:05:09.670
And she finally got,
she goes,
bill,
everybody's a little happy here.

98
00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:13.810
This is a gay bar.
And then I looked around,
I was like,
Oh shit,

99
00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.200
I was totally freaked the fuck out there.
Then you know,

100
00:05:17.201 --> 00:05:19.210
by the time I get to New York,
I was just like,
I,
you know,

101
00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:21.870
you start broadening horizons.
You don't give a shit.
But uh,

102
00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.340
so you started out there.
So when I,

103
00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:28.960
what made it blow up the way it did that all of a sudden there was just,

104
00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:30.310
you could,
you know,

105
00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:34.630
instead of having to go on after a poet or a stripper or whatever you had to do,

106
00:05:34.631 --> 00:05:38.260
like I was always interested like what,
what,
like what years?

107
00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:41.380
Then all of a sudden these scenes started all these independent,

108
00:05:41.381 --> 00:05:44.350
like Boston had a comedy scene,
right?
The Ding Ho,
you know those guys,

109
00:05:44.351 --> 00:05:47.800
those Lenny Clarke and Barry Crimmins and these,
there was a scene up there.

110
00:05:47.801 --> 00:05:49.750
There was a scene in Washington DC.
We found this bar.

111
00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:53.530
This guy started doing comedy at this bar.
So Louis Black,
myself,

112
00:05:53.531 --> 00:05:57.070
Kevin Rooney runs them,
all of these guys showed up to start doing,

113
00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.070
stand up as a little bar

114
00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.480
<v 2>in southeast Anacostia like there was.</v>

115
00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:04.100
And the fact that it was stand up exclusively must have been like oh yeah,

116
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.220
oh yeah.
It became packed immediately.
It became like wild immediate.

117
00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:10.280
And there was a scene in San Francisco with the holy city zoo and that comedy

118
00:06:10.281 --> 00:06:10.820
scene,

119
00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:13.820
there was one in Houston and comedy workshop with Hicks and Kennison and those

120
00:06:13.821 --> 00:06:15.330
guys were starting now did Elliot,

121
00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:19.100
cause I know Dangerfield was around since like the 60s so like New York and La

122
00:06:19.101 --> 00:06:22.550
actually,
hey had seen like I was doing it for like a year or so.

123
00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:23.930
And a friend of mine said,
she goes,

124
00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.930
you know there are comics like you doing this up in New York City.
I was like,

125
00:06:26.931 --> 00:06:30.080
what?
She goes,
he had a comedy clubs.
So she took me up there and there were,

126
00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:33.770
you know,
the Improv,
the comic strip and catch a rising star.

127
00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:35.150
But I didn't know about until I went up there.

128
00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:37.940
That's so fast and cause like there's no internet,
there's no inner knowing.

129
00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:40.760
Nobody knew anything.
Like this guy comes in one night,
comes into l,

130
00:06:40.761 --> 00:06:43.630
Brooklyn's like,
you know what I mean?
And he walks up to me,
he goes,
hey,

131
00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:46.060
I want to do a some standup communists.
Yeah,

132
00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.130
we at the end of the show he like put guys on,
no,

133
00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:49.550
I'm a comic out in San Francisco.

134
00:06:49.551 --> 00:06:52.880
We were doing like this out in San Francisco was like what?
She had got a place,

135
00:06:52.881 --> 00:06:56.180
a holy city zoo.
His name was Tony de Paul and he was running a holy cities.

136
00:06:56.181 --> 00:06:58.160
Let's say you tell me you're going to come out of here man,

137
00:06:58.161 --> 00:07:01.460
we're doing this out there too.
And I was like,
what?
People are doing this?

138
00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:04.760
You didn't think like people are doing it,
we're just doing it.

139
00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:07.130
And you don't know.
Nobody was talking to,
there's a scene in Philly.

140
00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:10.640
There were about six or seven cities that had scenes percolate,
percolate.

141
00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:12.440
So how did those guys back in the day,

142
00:07:12.441 --> 00:07:14.570
like if they had to do way back to like Ed Sullivan,

143
00:07:14.571 --> 00:07:16.400
like how did you put your set together?

144
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:18.920
I know this guys did Vegas and they did casinos.

145
00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:24.140
I guess you just had to be based in New York or La to get stage time to
actually,

146
00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:27.460
yeah,
but those guys,
they,
but they didn't there.
There were places all over there.

147
00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:28.040
You know,
the,

148
00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:33.040
the nightclubs started happening right after World War One when like supper

149
00:07:33.231 --> 00:07:35.840
clubs and stuff,
they started doing the speakeasies and all when,

150
00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:38.870
when prohibition came in,
so the comics moved in,
out of Belleville,

151
00:07:38.871 --> 00:07:41.840
started moving into these nightclubs to make real money.
Right.

152
00:07:41.841 --> 00:07:44.390
So that's where it started.
So they're always,
you know,

153
00:07:44.391 --> 00:07:47.120
back in the fifties and sixties they call them the toilets where he's guys would

154
00:07:47.121 --> 00:07:49.130
train,
you know,
they go,
you've got to work the toilets.

155
00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:52.550
A little little bar out in Jersey though.
It was a little comedy,
a little show.

156
00:07:52.551 --> 00:07:55.430
You'd be part of a show,
you know,
there's a singer,
dancer.
Right,
right.

157
00:07:55.431 --> 00:07:58.880
It wasn't exclusively comedy that for danger fields wasn't exclusively stand up.

158
00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:03.070
You know,
they try to singers and stand ups and also they were,
yeah,

159
00:08:03.071 --> 00:08:06.740
they still got the piano.
They haven't changed shit.
Oh hell no man.

160
00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:10.640
No,
no.
So what year did,
so then I guess,

161
00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:12.800
imagine as a supper club started to go away,

162
00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:17.310
then your guys' scene then created that cdot comedy club.
That's right.

163
00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:20.360
To my generation.
They weren't going out to the dinner clubs.

164
00:08:20.361 --> 00:08:23.290
You don't go out and have a dinner and see a show.
Nobody was doing anymore.

165
00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:25.820
That was out.
You don't get dressed up as old people stuff.

166
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.030
So we were in rock concert.
So then that kind of like started fading.
Right.

167
00:08:29.031 --> 00:08:31.190
You know,
you're going get a little older,
you want to date,

168
00:08:31.191 --> 00:08:32.530
you just can't go date,
you know,

169
00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:34.730
so everybody's kind of looking for the next thing.

170
00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:37.610
And it happened like some guy opens up a comedy club,
you know,

171
00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:41.090
there's the three paint comedy clubs out here in the late seventies in

172
00:08:41.091 --> 00:08:41.924
California.

173
00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:46.970
Those Mitzi opened a place down in Pacific beach and 76 and moved over to s into

174
00:08:46.971 --> 00:08:50.960
La Jolla 77 and there was a guy,
Mike Kelly opened up place.

175
00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:53.960
The laugh stopped down in Newport beach.
And then Mike Lacey,

176
00:08:53.961 --> 00:08:55.160
which you've been out of comedy magic.

177
00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:59.070
I've done her most speech in 78 there were a first three paying like paying,

178
00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:03.270
they bring Cummings in from La and pay him a couple hundred bucks.
Wow.

179
00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:08.300
And then Garvin's in Washington DC opens 79 January 79 start paying comics from

180
00:09:09.001 --> 00:09:11.010
New York to come down and do it.
So at this point,

181
00:09:11.011 --> 00:09:13.050
you've been doing it like two years or two years.

182
00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:15.610
And I became the MC there and that's why I met olders comics.

183
00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:19.610
I started working with Seinfeld and Bill Maher and Overton and all that.

184
00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:23.010
What time,
at what point did you,
did you start to sense like,
wow man,

185
00:09:23.011 --> 00:09:27.240
like I sort of jumped into this thing that has just taken off.

186
00:09:27.241 --> 00:09:30.750
Like what point did it really seem like,
like this?
Like the sky's the limit.

187
00:09:30.751 --> 00:09:33.600
It was almost like a real estate boom.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You know,
I didn't,
you know,

188
00:09:33.601 --> 00:09:36.780
it didn't,
it took me while,
I mean it sucked into it.
We weren't making money,

189
00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:42.050
you know the comic Strip in Fort Lauderdale open like January or so 80 and I

190
00:09:42.151 --> 00:09:45.870
remember going down there and I'm working with my first wife Caralee for Joe

191
00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:47.770
Bolster and mark Schiff and Kelly Rogers.
And,

192
00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:51.870
and Kelly pulls me over in a comedy Condo,
right?
That the first comedy condo.

193
00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:55.800
So it's clean,
it's clean and it's gonna float.
It's gonna float inside.

194
00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:59.280
We've got a boat and he goes cakes at the port.
He goes,
come here,
come here.

195
00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:02.820
And he goes,
whatever this guy says you can do,
tell him you can do it.

196
00:10:02.821 --> 00:10:05.470
If he asks whatever he has told me,
you can do it.
So I got a phone,
guy goes,
hey,

197
00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:07.950
I just opened up this club in Ottawa,
Canada.

198
00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:11.850
I need a guy who could go do two 45 minutes sets.
Can you do two separate?

199
00:10:11.851 --> 00:10:15.490
45 minutes shows that,
oh yeah,
Jesus Christ.
I hang up the phone,
I go,
come on.

200
00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:17.160
I've got like a half a half.
They buy everything,

201
00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:21.240
they take everything I'm killing,
right?
I'm killing everything.
He says,

202
00:10:21.241 --> 00:10:24.930
don't worry,
you'll do it.
Go do it.
So I go up there,
I do two a week.
Right.

203
00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:25.620
You don't have,

204
00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:29.010
my strategy was do all the meetings you need to because he's the same crown.

205
00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:31.950
He didn't,
it was a big bar.
It was just a big board.
These comedy rooms.

206
00:10:31.951 --> 00:10:34.200
At first it wasn't like they slept.
Oh we're going to be,
you know,

207
00:10:34.201 --> 00:10:36.300
we're open up a new club.
We want to build this club.
They just,

208
00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:40.050
there was a rock bar.
He wasn't getting a lot of business in rock bar.

209
00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:43.110
I don't know where he got the idea.
Some will do comedy.
Right.

210
00:10:43.111 --> 00:10:46.590
So once or twice a month he was doing comedy brought a comedian in.

211
00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:50.370
So I'm going to guess what happened cause they don't really pay attention to how

212
00:10:50.371 --> 00:10:52.470
long you're up there.
It's just how well you're doing.

213
00:10:52.471 --> 00:10:56.160
Did you pull up short on your sets or did you do think I was counting back there

214
00:10:56.161 --> 00:10:57.720
man.
I'm drinking shots.

215
00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:00.540
Sometimes I'm trying to come up with dumped smoking weed between the sets,

216
00:11:00.541 --> 00:11:01.380
trying to come up with new,
you know,

217
00:11:01.381 --> 00:11:04.140
I'm just up there doing whatever I can do to try to,
you know what I mean?

218
00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:05.980
I did all the material I could do that.

219
00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:09.300
I had up front and then just ran around the room like Jerry Lewis,
you know,

220
00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:13.490
like I was out of my mind.
Wow.
You know,
did you save a bit for the end to close?

221
00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:18.500
I didn't have any thoughts about saving bit closer opener is like just funny and

222
00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:23.520
hold them,
just hold the stage and then you pulled it off,
pulled off.

223
00:11:23.521 --> 00:11:27.060
So then the week the guy goes,
he's paying me.
He goes,
this was great man.

224
00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:29.460
It was like a weekend,
you know,
like three days or something.
He said,

225
00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:32.310
guys on the phone wants to talk to you.
I pick up the phone.
This guy goes,

226
00:11:32.311 --> 00:11:35.010
I got a,
I got a club in Montreal.
I heard you're great.

227
00:11:35.011 --> 00:11:38.340
You want to come down here,
come win now.
Come on Dover.
Just come over now.

228
00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:42.210
And I did the next week of Montreal and then he puts me in the phone with,

229
00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:45.520
with um,
uh,
mark,
um,
uh,

230
00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:48.660
from yucks president from our president from [inaudible],
same thing I want,

231
00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:49.920
right.
The Breslin and Toronto.

232
00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:53.590
So I went up there and I did like three weeks in a row and it came back.

233
00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:57.100
I'm a headliner.
I thought I'm a headliner.
Wow.
I didn't know what it was,

234
00:11:57.130 --> 00:12:01.420
but I'm like,
I was at two,
three years in.
I was,
yeah,
it was like in 1980.

235
00:12:01.421 --> 00:12:05.190
So I'm like three years in,
but I was opened up for a lot of rock bands.
I,

236
00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:08.890
that was it.
At that point you could quit your day job.
I didn't have a day job.

237
00:12:08.891 --> 00:12:13.210
My,
my last,
yeah.
My last day job was,
yeah.
About then because I was,

238
00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:15.160
my last day job was working in New York City.

239
00:12:15.161 --> 00:12:18.070
I was cleaning out apartments for the mob.
I didn't know that's what I was doing,

240
00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:22.540
but that's what I was doing.
Cleaning them out.
What?
After all down,
down,
down,

241
00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:25.600
down.
Tax got shot for another turn.
The fucking truck.

242
00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:31.270
What would you do this?
You don't remember this,
but 77 on that era.
My,

243
00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:33.760
my first apartment was in a base was in rural apartment,

244
00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:37.000
which she slept some walls thrown up every other building was abandoned.

245
00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:40.120
Squatters everywhere.
Oh,
that's the one that's out of the East village.
Bankrupt,

246
00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:43.390
right?
It's bankrupt.
Dinero in taxi era.
Exactly.

247
00:12:43.391 --> 00:12:46.450
So they start selling buildings for a buck.

248
00:12:46.570 --> 00:12:49.990
But you had to promise to rehab the building within a year to turn it into a

249
00:12:49.991 --> 00:12:54.230
rental property.
Oh my God.
Right?
So the $10.
So I'm,

250
00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:57.010
I could be set for a while,
but you had to fix them money,
right?

251
00:12:57.011 --> 00:12:59.500
You had to fix them up.
So I'm having a hard time paying the rent.

252
00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:03.180
So the landlord goes,
hey man,
you do carpet,
you work Nitel.
I go,
yeah,
yeah,

253
00:13:03.181 --> 00:13:05.920
I can do carpentry work.
He says like,
well,
we're gonna help these guys.

254
00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:08.160
How much of your life has been like,
yeah,
I can do that.

255
00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.630
They just fucking showing up and right around like Jeffrey Lewis.

256
00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:14.650
So that's amazing.
So you say,
yeah,
that will show up.
I go over there.

257
00:13:14.651 --> 00:13:16.870
These guys in New York guys,
they forgot in three seconds.

258
00:13:16.871 --> 00:13:20.440
I can't really do carpentry,
but they,
I'm,
I'm,
you know,
I'm an okay guy,
you know,

259
00:13:20.441 --> 00:13:22.930
get some cigarettes and beer.
Go get some cigarettes and beer force,
you know,

260
00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:25.930
go do this,
go do that,
you know,
go for it.
And for them.
Right.

261
00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:28.350
So at the end of the day the guy goes,
yeah,
you can't do carpet you,

262
00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:31.440
but can you clean out an apartment?
I go,
well yeah I can,
you know,
my family,

263
00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:34.480
I can tell me on manual labor,
man,
that's,
that's how we stay on the planet.

264
00:13:34.481 --> 00:13:37.450
Manual labor.
So I show up the next morning,

265
00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:40.180
there's three young Italian guys that even though there stand outside of

266
00:13:40.181 --> 00:13:43.960
building or pass around a half point,
they go,
hey,
you're ready.
But yeah,

267
00:13:43.961 --> 00:13:47.170
I'm the new guy.
Yeah,
yeah.
Okay,
let's go.
We went,
we're throwing squatters out,

268
00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:49.350
we're cleaning out apartments.
Oh God.

269
00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:52.770
And we're throwing people out of apartments,
you know,
we're going in with flow.

270
00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:55.900
We're going into the shooting galleries.
Man,
people are shooting up,

271
00:13:55.901 --> 00:13:59.350
we're throwing stuff out the windows.
We're are hustling people out.

272
00:14:00.410 --> 00:14:03.850
Well Shit,
five bucks an hour,
five bucks an hour under the table,

273
00:14:03.851 --> 00:14:04.560
five bucks in there.

274
00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:07.000
Old people out on the street and I'll break down the whole emotion of that.

275
00:14:07.001 --> 00:14:09.330
You walk up to the door,
is it unlocked as it locked?

276
00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:13.180
You walk up the door and I'd been in a squatter place when I first moved up

277
00:14:13.181 --> 00:14:16.960
there,
so I kind of understood it,
you know?
But you see it like extension cables,

278
00:14:16.961 --> 00:14:18.610
running him from building a building.
They were,
you know,

279
00:14:18.611 --> 00:14:21.490
just stealing from everybody to back up with your life.

280
00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:24.790
So how the fuck do you see you go up to,
you live in,
you got water building.

281
00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:26.620
When I first,
how does that go down?
That was,

282
00:14:26.650 --> 00:14:30.550
that was 74 when I went to New York and 74 but I had no plan and you had no

283
00:14:30.551 --> 00:14:33.170
money and then you'll see an abandoned building.
You walk in,

284
00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:36.700
there's other people in there yet guy,
I was escaped from New York.

285
00:14:38.650 --> 00:14:42.310
People crawling up out of manholes.
People,
people,
they'd get a building,

286
00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:45.430
they don't,
they put you see locks on outside of the door.
There were no locks,

287
00:14:45.431 --> 00:14:48.730
like a key lock.
I would have a padlock,
you know a padlock,
right?

288
00:14:48.731 --> 00:14:51.010
That's how he got in and get out.
And then he'd locked inside it,

289
00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:51.920
have bolts and lock

290
00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:55.850
<v 1>the inside and they have electricity stealing from one building or another</v>

291
00:14:55.851 --> 00:14:58.460
building,
whatever.
They were running cables or some places had no electricity.

292
00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:01.830
They would just carry,
that wasn't a fire hazard.
I love this.

293
00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:04.160
Some guy that actually could be working as an electrician,

294
00:15:04.161 --> 00:15:07.790
but he's deciding to live for free in this fucking building if people are

295
00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:12.050
fascinating.
All right,
so now at night,
now you're on the other side.
Okay,

296
00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:14.600
the fucking student has become the master.

297
00:15:14.601 --> 00:15:17.000
Now you're going to throw someone out like yourself as we went on drugs.

298
00:15:17.001 --> 00:15:21.150
But so what was,
what was that Po was crying,
screaming,
fighting.
No.

299
00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:24.740
People were like,
okay,
cool.
Cause they'd gotten notice.
It wasn't like surprised.

300
00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:26.590
They did notice it.
Put those,

301
00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:29.190
this building is been bought and you've got to leave,
evacuate,
you know,

302
00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:33.470
or get out whatever it is.
And they were ignoring it or they,

303
00:15:33.471 --> 00:15:36.530
and so some people were cool,
okay,
we're going.
Some people that kicked in doors,

304
00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:39.280
we go running and we thrown their stuff out the windows.
Right.

305
00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:41.840
It was one where there's so many abandoned buildings and they'd be like,
I have,

306
00:15:41.841 --> 00:15:42.171
fuck it.

307
00:15:42.171 --> 00:15:44.600
I'll just grab my shit and just go down the street and around the corner.

308
00:15:44.601 --> 00:15:47.210
I'll have another one.
Yeah.
I don't know what their attitude was.
I mean,

309
00:15:47.211 --> 00:15:50.300
I didn't really care.
I mean,
it was pretty hectic.
It was pretty.

310
00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:54.950
Did you have to physically do a couple times we had to like fight off people or

311
00:15:54.951 --> 00:15:58.220
push them around.
But you had some guys in the rough.
These guys were rough.

312
00:15:58.221 --> 00:16:00.200
They were young and rough man.
Oh,
okay.

313
00:16:00.410 --> 00:16:04.460
Did they have the Joe Pesci suits and shit?
No.
I watch too many movies.

314
00:16:04.461 --> 00:16:05.940
They were trade suits.
They were dressed.

315
00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:09.610
They were dressed and ready for business.
Oh,
the three quarter letters.

316
00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:14.560
Plastic quote,
a leather,
but every jerk-off like Warren.

317
00:16:14.570 --> 00:16:18.860
I was not that guy,
man.
Wow.
That's fucking amazing.
So,
um,

318
00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:22.550
I didn't want to spend too much on your past because we're here to,
to,
to,
to,
uh,

319
00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:25.460
I mean we're definitely going to go back because I'm a geek for all of this
shit.

320
00:16:25.461 --> 00:16:29.090
But,
uh,
let's talk about the presence here.
You're kicking through the ashes.

321
00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:31.910
The parts that I read,
what I loved about it is you,

322
00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:36.470
you do not sugar coat any like the what happened?

323
00:16:36.471 --> 00:16:39.650
The odds of you making it anything.
It was really kind of like,

324
00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:43.610
like you just kind of laid it out there.
Yeah.
Like how do,
um,

325
00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.450
I know you've done books in the past and stuff and how did this whole thing
like,

326
00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:50.510
I mean it had to be through just telling stories that guys like me,

327
00:16:50.511 --> 00:16:52.640
no one how interested I am in this shit.
You know,

328
00:16:52.641 --> 00:16:53.780
you tell these stories for years,

329
00:16:53.781 --> 00:16:56.690
you tell these stories and sometimes I hear stories come back and go,

330
00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:59.400
well that's,
that's my story.
That's not how it went.
You know,

331
00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:00.530
you'd tell the story or whatever.

332
00:17:00.531 --> 00:17:02.750
Like the Allie Jo Prater story on hear stories and be like,

333
00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:05.750
like the Comey had that one.
Cause I've always seen his now he's now full.

334
00:17:05.751 --> 00:17:08.570
You guys listening,
he's a legendary comic from the comedy story,

335
00:17:08.571 --> 00:17:11.360
I believe had a cowboy hat and the beard.
He was,
you're right.

336
00:17:11.361 --> 00:17:16.100
He was doing the Larry the cable guy,
sort of country western comic before.

337
00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:19.220
And I always read his first name is oily cause I'm,

338
00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:21.980
I have like a learning disability or I'm just a moron.

339
00:17:22.190 --> 00:17:24.110
And then someone finally said the name.
I'm like,
Oh shit.

340
00:17:24.111 --> 00:17:27.260
That's how you say his name.
So that guy,
Gilbert Hertzog was his real name.

341
00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:31.580
Gilbert Hertz.
Hartsock heartsong and he went by Ali,
Joe Prater,
Ali,

342
00:17:31.581 --> 00:17:33.490
Joe printed look like your somebody Sam.

343
00:17:33.491 --> 00:17:36.980
He just short guy was heavy and cowboy boots,
a cowboy hat,
you know,

344
00:17:36.981 --> 00:17:39.950
he looked like a cartoon character and he was a classic.

345
00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:43.250
See back when these clubs started popping,
the places were packed.

346
00:17:43.251 --> 00:17:47.600
They didn't need guys to draw.
They had packed,
they wanted guys to sell alcohol.

347
00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:49.130
We were liquor pimps.

348
00:17:49.530 --> 00:17:53.340
You know who sold the most and Allie Joe would drink on stage and what crowd

349
00:17:53.341 --> 00:17:54.174
would drink with him?

350
00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:57.840
What would they pay you guys back then had started escalating fast.
I mean,

351
00:17:57.841 --> 00:17:58.950
you first go out,
they go,
you know,

352
00:17:58.951 --> 00:18:03.090
it's an 800 bucks a week and then they will want you back.

353
00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:06.240
We want you back when these other clubs want you.
So these will pay you twice.

354
00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:09.480
Twice.
I went up by about 400 bucks 20 years later when I started.

355
00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:13.110
That's what I loved in New York when we almost had that strike,
it was like,

356
00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:17.700
it was 50 bucks for a weekend spot for like 2030 years,

357
00:18:17.701 --> 00:18:21.810
50 bucks,
50 bucks and everything else up,
all the corners were multimillionaires.

358
00:18:21.811 --> 00:18:22.920
And finally we're like,
what the fuck?

359
00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:26.760
And we asked for a hundred just knowing that we'd get like 75 and then

360
00:18:26.761 --> 00:18:31.410
completely freaked out.
But uh,
anyways,
getting penalties on escalating fast.
But,

361
00:18:31.411 --> 00:18:35.210
but,
but guys like Ali,
Joe Word,
you know,
he was a real,
he sold that.

362
00:18:35.370 --> 00:18:39.210
You'd come in,
they go,
Ali,
Joe just sold like $13,000 worth of liquor last week.

363
00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:42.510
And what was his style?
Was it?
So,
uh,
he was like,
you know,

364
00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:47.700
they look it Larry the cable guy.
Foxworthy.
No,
he was blue.

365
00:18:47.701 --> 00:18:50.190
He was little and he was,
and he was,
you know,

366
00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:54.000
he would chug a beer and he'd start his act by just like chugging a beer and

367
00:18:54.210 --> 00:18:57.390
going and then he belch and he go,
that's everything I learned in college.

368
00:18:57.990 --> 00:19:02.280
Oh Jesus.
So he set the tone early.
I would not want to follow that guy today.

369
00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:04.360
And he,
he was any,

370
00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:07.320
and he would liberally took anybody's act and there's an old line and I don't

371
00:19:07.321 --> 00:19:09.270
know whose line this was,
but somebody wants,

372
00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:11.610
says if Ali Joe came up and bought your beer.

373
00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:15.540
I mean she just did one of your jokes and Ali,
Joe shared a joint with you.

374
00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:17.100
He did a couple of your jokes.

375
00:19:17.370 --> 00:19:20.550
If Allie Joe laid down in the line of coke for you,
you just played Cleveland.

376
00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:23.910
Yeah,
he didn't care.

377
00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:27.900
And it seemed like back then like certainly through like Vaudeville,

378
00:19:27.901 --> 00:19:30.750
like people just taking other people's shit.

379
00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:34.020
It was always seemed to knowing,
but like,

380
00:19:34.021 --> 00:19:36.600
it wasn't like the way it is now where it's just like,
it's,

381
00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:40.830
it's like I don't post nine 11 like why are you being hostile?
Like I,

382
00:19:40.831 --> 00:19:45.831
I remember seeing George Burns one time on 60 minutes or something and he said,

383
00:19:46.450 --> 00:19:49.590
you know,
you know,
I used to do this bit,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
You know,

384
00:19:49.591 --> 00:19:52.700
he tells the joke,
he goes,
you know,
you know,
it's,
he goes,
yeah man,

385
00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:55.260
it's not a great choke.
I don't think melody would steal it.
And like,

386
00:19:55.261 --> 00:19:59.010
he threw that out there on TV and years later I was just thinking like,
oh,

387
00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:01.770
he's just ribbon.
And then years later when I became a comedian,
I was just like,

388
00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:05.700
wow.
Like he,
he really meant something by that.
And that guy must've been,

389
00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:09.630
you know,
at least fucked with his act on some level that if he's,

390
00:20:09.631 --> 00:20:13.990
that George Barnes is on 60 minutes and fucking call somebody out for,

391
00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:17.580
for taking his shit.
So yeah.
But it didn't matter to him like it does now.

392
00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:22.680
She did not see the Milton omen that it used to call him the thief of bed gags.

393
00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:26.730
He owned it.
He like,
he was like,
I,
I didn't steal this one or I stole that one.

394
00:20:26.731 --> 00:20:29.340
Or they didn't care like we did.
Right.
You know,

395
00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:32.640
they did worry about stealing or acts back involved though.
They used to,

396
00:20:32.790 --> 00:20:35.910
the only way to like prevent it was they would pay stage hands to protect their

397
00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:39.030
act.
So if you came in and I just played there and then you came in,

398
00:20:39.031 --> 00:20:43.460
you started doing my bits,
Sam backdrops near you.
Oh Shit.

399
00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:46.470
Like give you a warning,
you know,
they get like a heavy warning.

400
00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:48.130
But then see that air

401
00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:50.770
<v 2>shoots you could get away with before cell phone cameras and stuff.</v>

402
00:20:50.771 --> 00:20:53.800
You could literally deliberately drop it on the guy's head.
He dies out.

403
00:20:53.801 --> 00:20:57.070
We know what happened to him.
He never showed up as fucking underneath the stage.

404
00:20:57.760 --> 00:20:59.920
Wow.
It changed.
And Lenny Bruce's time.

405
00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:02.920
See before that the comics were just kind of Shtick,
you know,

406
00:21:02.921 --> 00:21:04.410
and so you're doing some shtick and it,

407
00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:07.690
people were buying jokes and selling jokes and they were pretty interchangeable.

408
00:21:07.691 --> 00:21:10.770
I'm from California,
boy,
my arm is tired.
It was just all shit like that.

409
00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:11.733
It didn't matter.

410
00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:15.400
So when Lenny and those guys started to make them what the comic said was

411
00:21:15.401 --> 00:21:20.140
important,
it became artful and it mattered and you became tied to material.

412
00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:23.560
So like what you said mattered and people wanted to believe that that was really

413
00:21:23.561 --> 00:21:27.940
you,
right,
was really your opinion.
That was really your life.
Then it mattered.

414
00:21:27.941 --> 00:21:31.600
Then you started taking things and it mattered.
Okay.
So when you come along,

415
00:21:31.601 --> 00:21:34.390
I mean that's,
that's 25 years after Lenny Bruce.

416
00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:38.680
The thing that it didn't matter with you guys was because there's no youtube,

417
00:21:38.681 --> 00:21:41.560
there's none of that shit and you guys are just going up after poets and

418
00:21:41.561 --> 00:21:44.560
strippers and stuff.
So once I got into this,
go up and survive,

419
00:21:44.561 --> 00:21:47.530
or once I fucking got in the business,
it mattered.
It started matter.

420
00:21:47.531 --> 00:21:50.920
But there were so few comics we could police the community ourselves.

421
00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:55.360
That's the difference.
You know,
like a guy became a thief.
He doesn't get to work,

422
00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:58.750
the clubs,
he doesn't get the work that a rooms.
It was like when I stopped,

423
00:21:58.751 --> 00:22:01.810
when I started in Boston,
dude,
if you,
if you,
if you went over your time,

424
00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:05.530
you went over your time and by over your time,
like you know,

425
00:22:05.531 --> 00:22:07.090
we told you to do 25 minutes,

426
00:22:07.091 --> 00:22:11.320
you did 28 28 like you were in the fucking dog house.
Like dude,
what the,

427
00:22:11.410 --> 00:22:13.150
you did three extra minutes.
Like,

428
00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:17.620
like it was such a huge thing and forget about stealing jokes [inaudible] like,

429
00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:21.850
like I'm so fortunate that I started in Boston and all those Ding Ho guys like

430
00:22:21.851 --> 00:22:26.620
so set the bar so high that if you are any hack,

431
00:22:26.621 --> 00:22:29.920
if you any like derivative,
they'd let you go for like two,
three years.

432
00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:33.670
You're okay.
You're influenced by Gavin Sweeney or Nazi or something.

433
00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:35.890
But then after that it was just like,
dude,

434
00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:38.140
you need to come up with your own shit.
And,
but,

435
00:22:38.141 --> 00:22:40.810
and it was one of those things like Boston's an unforgiving place.

436
00:22:40.811 --> 00:22:45.660
So it's just like once you will labeled,
you will,
you had to leave.
So,
um,

437
00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:49.330
see that's it.
That's it.
You got trained,
you got trained,

438
00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:51.010
there's nobody doing that training anymore,

439
00:22:51.011 --> 00:22:52.630
but you got trained and that's how he did.
Involved.

440
00:22:52.631 --> 00:22:55.660
Built to the same sort of things,
man.
They trained you,
they trained,

441
00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:56.800
the guys would be coming up,

442
00:22:56.930 --> 00:22:59.110
they'd have to learn to do it the right way or you wouldn't get any time.

443
00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:02.620
What was the first like real comedy club like a lot like,
you know,

444
00:23:02.621 --> 00:23:05.020
going up to Ottawa,
but like you,
you weren't,
you felt like,

445
00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:08.740
like when did all like those a room start coming up?
Like the punchlines,

446
00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:11.560
the talent started around 82.
They all started,
you know,

447
00:23:11.561 --> 00:23:14.410
there's some great rooms have started.
A lot of these rooms they started at,

448
00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:17.170
I mean I wrote in the book,
there's one like you go,

449
00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:18.860
you went up to Minneapolis to play a room.

450
00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:20.440
I'm going to play place called Mickey Fins.

451
00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:22.720
Now all of these rooms rejected just to them together.

452
00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:26.530
So I get out there and you know,
I felt like the gunslinger coming to town,

453
00:23:26.531 --> 00:23:28.660
I'm like one of the first acts they bring in.
I'm from New York.

454
00:23:28.661 --> 00:23:31.120
I see all those guys.
Jeff says Stereo Louis Anderson,

455
00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:34.340
Ross standing in the back while bill bower are standing in the back.
I said that,

456
00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:38.380
knew that there was a local comics there.
Guys were all from,
from Minneapolis,

457
00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:42.160
Minnesota.
They're all back in the room.
They're all staying.
I see.
I can see them.

458
00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:45.500
You gotta get pim,
you go there.
They are.
They're here to check me out.
Right?

459
00:23:45.501 --> 00:23:46.010
So I'm going to

460
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:47.990
<v 1>hit that stage,
man.
I'm,
and we'll let him know I'm here man.</v>

461
00:23:47.991 --> 00:23:50.060
I'm going to rub their man.
I'm going to rock,
you know?
Right.

462
00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:53.660
So I hadn't checked anything out so I go running up and jump on the stage.

463
00:23:53.690 --> 00:23:57.200
The stage was just a bunch of milk cartons,
right?

464
00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:00.830
No crates with a sheet of plywood on top God.
So I go fly.

465
00:24:00.831 --> 00:24:02.870
I just surfed the whole thing.
The whole thing just takes off.

466
00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:05.540
I just go flying today,
blow to a couple of tables,

467
00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:08.090
hit the wall partially separate my shoulder,

468
00:24:08.091 --> 00:24:11.180
jump up like probably the biggest laugh.
You've got that right.
Juge they're like,

469
00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:14.540
everybody's laughing at you.
They put the stage back in place and I did my set.

470
00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:19.190
Oh my God.
So who else?
Now who else was a part of that Minneapolis scene?

471
00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:22.190
That was a big names to say.
Oh yeah,
I understand.
Yeah.

472
00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:24.950
You've been watching Lujan Zach guy.
Yeah,
he's great.

473
00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:28.700
That's what I love about comedy is is this sometimes is like,
dude,

474
00:24:28.701 --> 00:24:30.350
you should do something with this person,

475
00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:33.110
but who would ever would have thought that we should play?

476
00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:34.940
Zach's dad and Zach was,

477
00:24:34.941 --> 00:24:39.350
I went to clown college in France and ends up in Bakersfield,

478
00:24:39.351 --> 00:24:42.530
California.
I was talking to my wife about that last night.

479
00:24:42.531 --> 00:24:46.730
We were a laying in bed and then the commercial came on for it and that just

480
00:24:46.731 --> 00:24:50.760
like this fucking like perfect casting together going like who to have like

481
00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:53.210
night.
That's it in the way that they,
they go back and forth.

482
00:24:53.211 --> 00:24:55.460
It's like they've been working together for like 50 years.

483
00:24:55.550 --> 00:24:56.720
They're like an old comedy team.

484
00:24:57.530 --> 00:24:59.960
That's one of the things that one of my favorite things as like a,

485
00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:03.380
cause I eat despite how long I've been in this business,
I've always just,

486
00:25:03.381 --> 00:25:07.510
I've maintained that whole nerd,
sorta huge fan of,
um,

487
00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:12.200
of stuff like that.
So,
um,
who is a guy that when you was in the early eighties,

488
00:25:12.201 --> 00:25:14.660
like,
you know,
there's always those guys that,
you know,
when you start out,

489
00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:18.140
you're just like,
there's no fucking way this person,
this person doesn't make it.

490
00:25:18.141 --> 00:25:19.790
Nobody's going to make it.
Like those guys,

491
00:25:19.890 --> 00:25:22.610
you could be the worst manager in a world and you knew that someone was gonna

492
00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:26.390
make a,
do you remember seeing anybody like that?
Well,
you knew this is,
you know,

493
00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:29.500
a lot of guys don't realize it,
but you do look it back.
You go like Leno,

494
00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:33.200
Jay Leno,
first time I saw him,
I go,
this guy's a killer.
I've always heard that.

495
00:25:33.201 --> 00:25:36.700
I heard.
He's like,
I mean,
just destroyed rooms.
He had the belt for like,
what?

496
00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:38.570
Yeah,
15 years before he,
basically,

497
00:25:38.571 --> 00:25:41.300
before he had to do the tight show every night.
Yeah.
I mean,
you know,

498
00:25:41.301 --> 00:25:44.300
I'd go into clubs and I'd be like,
I'd go in.
First thing I'd say is,

499
00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:47.630
who's got the record?
Who's got the time?
You know,
who's done the longest here?
Eh,

500
00:25:47.631 --> 00:25:52.200
this Guy Colin it down and 45 it's done tonight.
It's over tonight.
You know,

501
00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:55.550
I'm doing it too easy,
you know,
and I'd go gun them for everybody.

502
00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.710
And then I'd go into town and after Leno started working at close,

503
00:25:58.711 --> 00:26:01.220
right when he started doing Letterman start popping,
[inaudible] going to go.

504
00:26:01.370 --> 00:26:04.400
Who's got the other that Jay Lin just at three hours,
three hours.

505
00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:06.500
What did you lock the doors like Wagnerian opera.

506
00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:08.900
What they do hold the audience in it at you have four ovations.

507
00:26:08.901 --> 00:26:12.170
They brought him back four times and he still had the materials.

508
00:26:12.171 --> 00:26:14.030
That's what's always blown my mind about those people.
Like man,

509
00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:17.480
that was a period where people were trying to like set the record and they've

510
00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:19.760
gone on stage for like seven,
eight,
nine hours.

511
00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:23.240
I was just always picturing like eight hours in you just like,
Hey,

512
00:26:23.241 --> 00:26:26.300
what's up with chairs?
You know,
just like,

513
00:26:26.510 --> 00:26:28.940
like how do you still have yeah,
yeah.

514
00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:33.140
At that point it's just like you're just not getting off stage.
That's,
you know,

515
00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:36.370
like world.
Right.
You might as well you sitting on a fucking flagpole it,

516
00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:38.770
that's not exactly excellent kills me.

517
00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:41.870
Somebody actually sat there and watched all of that and there's a fucking,

518
00:26:41.871 --> 00:26:44.160
you know,
two people left from the waitstaff that have to stay

519
00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:47.850
<v 2>there.
This was,
but this was a legit show.
This was a legit show.</v>

520
00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:50.230
Cause people were drinking and doing coke and they had,
they,

521
00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:51.530
the crowd could hang right.

522
00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:54.310
This will legit this for the drunk driving laws change.

523
00:26:54.311 --> 00:26:56.880
This was a little different.
What class were you from as far as like,

524
00:26:56.881 --> 00:26:59.290
so I know you were in New York.
How long were you in neutral?

525
00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:03.780
Belzer was the king in New York stand up comedy back then?
Yeah,
he was,
I mean,

526
00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:06.280
you'd seen him work that room catch.
He just owned it,
you know,
he,

527
00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:08.350
he just set the record for playing like a,

528
00:27:08.351 --> 00:27:11.310
a TV character for the longest time on a show or something like that.

529
00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:16.020
He said something and I remember being in Nick's comedy stop and the early

530
00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:18.150
nineties and he was headlining and he was going,
yeah,
you know,

531
00:27:18.151 --> 00:27:19.640
they want me to do this,
uh,

532
00:27:19.670 --> 00:27:22.080
this procedural show or something like that and I know what you think you can

533
00:27:22.081 --> 00:27:23.520
think of actually.
Should I do it?
Should I do it?

534
00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:26.160
I remember sitting in the back club going,
what the fuck is this guy asking us?

535
00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:28.860
Course you're going to do it.
Should I be on TV?
Absolutely.

536
00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:31.980
I didn't realize how much money he was making as a comedian,
but like,
uh,

537
00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:33.291
it's Kinda cool that I,

538
00:27:33.291 --> 00:27:37.770
I remember reading that like within like the last like few weeks that he just

539
00:27:38.010 --> 00:27:41.670
set some fucking record for playing the same guy in the same show since

540
00:27:41.671 --> 00:27:44.700
basically my entire standup career,
like almost last 25,

541
00:27:45.390 --> 00:27:49.860
25 years had been that long.
Yeah.
So you are a,
he was the guy,
he was the guy,

542
00:27:49.861 --> 00:27:52.710
Gilbert Godfrey I saw when he,
you saw him.
We were like that,

543
00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:54.730
that he's the guy I want to,

544
00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:57.990
I once watched him too many nights in a row and went down to the East River and

545
00:27:57.991 --> 00:28:02.160
burned all my material burned on my notebooks.
Oh Geez.
Burned them all.
I said,

546
00:28:02.161 --> 00:28:04.260
I'm just hack.
I've always told this story.

547
00:28:04.261 --> 00:28:05.460
One of my favorite ones I ever saw him,

548
00:28:05.461 --> 00:28:09.270
he went up at Nick's comedy stop one time in front of a bunch of fucking drunk

549
00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:13.560
Boston morons and they were not getting him and he didn't waiver at all.

550
00:28:13.890 --> 00:28:17.400
He did his shit.
He had this little old man,
yellow sweater on.

551
00:28:17.910 --> 00:28:20.910
And I remember one of his jokes,
cause all the comics were dying laughing.

552
00:28:20.911 --> 00:28:23.670
He was just bombing in front of this crowd.
I remember he goes,
yeah,

553
00:28:23.671 --> 00:28:28.671
I went to a party the other night and I ran into Jackie Onassis and I said,

554
00:28:28.741 --> 00:28:31.500
Jackie,
do you remember where you were?

555
00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:36.870
And we're all dying laughing and nobody got it.
Nobody got the joke.

556
00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:40.620
And then he would just go onto the next one and do fucking dead like silence.

557
00:28:40.621 --> 00:28:45.000
And he toughed his way through that.
But,
uh,
first time I saw him,

558
00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:47.780
I wasn't in the business was I saw him in one of the,
uh,

559
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.670
Beverly hills cops movies.
You weren't in Beverly Hills cop two.

560
00:28:51.150 --> 00:28:53.430
What was that like?
Uh,
you know,
it's funny,
I mean,

561
00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:57.150
I think I've filmed for like four days,
for five seconds of screen time.

562
00:28:57.210 --> 00:29:00.060
A couple of times.
It usually works and it was fun.
It was hanging out,
you know,

563
00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:03.570
it was that time when I saw it.
Wow.
This is the star Eddie,
Eddie Murphy.

564
00:29:03.571 --> 00:29:06.830
There was a scene where to going,
all right Eddie,
we've got a hold on me.

565
00:29:06.831 --> 00:29:09.090
And we got changed some lighting and he goes,
I'm ready.
He goes,
yeah,

566
00:29:09.091 --> 00:29:12.060
but the director said,
hold on a minute and we'll get you Mitzvah.
He goes,

567
00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:14.340
and he goes,
come on,
let's go.
So he goes,

568
00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:18.210
grabs it like a bag of bread off the prep table,
and we'd go down to the,

569
00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:19.441
the playboy mansion.

570
00:29:19.441 --> 00:29:22.110
So we just go down and start feeding the geese or just telling bread to them.

571
00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:25.740
So I'm about five,
10 minutes later,
one of the 80s comes into the Eddie.

572
00:29:25.741 --> 00:29:27.580
They're ready for you now.
Eddie just study can turn around.

573
00:29:27.610 --> 00:29:32.430
Just keep seating at the feeding them the geese.
Eddie,
we're ready.
We're ready.

574
00:29:32.910 --> 00:29:36.780
He does ignore them.
They leave.
They come back five minutes later.
Eddie.
Well,

575
00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:39.840
you ready now?
And he says he made them wait.
They made him wait.

576
00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:42.150
He made them wait.
Oh Shit.
That's,

577
00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:46.090
<v 1>I go,
that's power.
That's,
you know,
he's like the fucking balls.</v>

578
00:29:46.330 --> 00:29:50.560
That guy would never,
I would never,
I'd be like,
ready?
No.
Go home schooling.

579
00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:55.120
How high jump.
Yeah.
Hat in hand.
I'll never get a no,

580
00:29:55.270 --> 00:29:57.490
I've never understood like people that uh,
what's,

581
00:29:57.491 --> 00:30:02.491
what's funny and tragic is watching people pulling those moves when they don't

582
00:30:02.561 --> 00:30:06.550
have the power,
which,
which I,
I've seen a lot,

583
00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:11.870
especially now where so many aspects of the entertainment bill business because

584
00:30:12.401 --> 00:30:16.150
of the Internet have just gone down this shit like the entire music business.

585
00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:16.871
You know,

586
00:30:16.871 --> 00:30:19.630
anybody nowadays who complains when be it all the good music girl sucks.

587
00:30:19.631 --> 00:30:22.570
I always go,
well,
you get what you pay for.
I'm guilty of it too.
I,

588
00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:26.640
I stole pipe Lyme wired a lot of shit.
I lie.
Yeah.

589
00:30:26.650 --> 00:30:31.570
A couple of fucking laptops that just got virus out before somebody finally went

590
00:30:31.571 --> 00:30:33.310
like,
dude,
you're in this business,
you should pay for it.

591
00:30:33.310 --> 00:30:34.770
Like I think it might've been Russman,

592
00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:37.510
eve in New York said that to me and I haven't,

593
00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:41.740
I haven't illegally downloaded a song or anything and like let a thousand years

594
00:30:41.770 --> 00:30:45.970
way back to like a Napster limewire was the last one that I use.
So,
um,

595
00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:50.230
but anyways,
yeah,
I've seen people like,
um,
try to pull that too.

596
00:30:50.231 --> 00:30:52.330
You know who I am and all of that.

597
00:30:52.331 --> 00:30:54.580
And in the people who do that now it's just like,
dude,

598
00:30:54.810 --> 00:30:58.660
you're not paying attention to this business where like remember like back in

599
00:30:58.661 --> 00:31:02.260
the day to try to get,
if they got like two major stars in a movie,

600
00:31:02.530 --> 00:31:05.890
it was just like,
holy fuck,
this is going to be like a blockbuster.

601
00:31:05.891 --> 00:31:10.260
Forget about now where like every movie is like Ocean's 11 I'm like,
I got like,

602
00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:13.180
like everybody got just bumped down.
Like,
like,

603
00:31:13.390 --> 00:31:17.230
like the shit that I would go in and audition for in like the nineties you'll

604
00:31:17.231 --> 00:31:20.170
have now a guy who like used to star in fucking movies,

605
00:31:20.171 --> 00:31:22.930
like B level movies is going and taking that spot.

606
00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:25.630
All these stars are on TV and you just see these people pulling them moves.

607
00:31:25.631 --> 00:31:30.090
But um,
that I,
I can't,
I mean that happens on a movie set.
Like,

608
00:31:30.170 --> 00:31:33.720
like the lighting isn't right.
It's a lot of waiting around.
I mean there,

609
00:31:34.050 --> 00:31:39.010
there's an entire crew film crew there,
people all over.
They had,
you know,

610
00:31:39.250 --> 00:31:44.230
the scene was they were going to shoot Eddie just walking past a bunch of women

611
00:31:44.290 --> 00:31:46.750
playing volleyball in Bikini's.
Right,
right.

612
00:31:46.751 --> 00:31:51.280
So we get up to the scene and they start doing it and the director's yelling,

613
00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:54.490
he goes,
jump higher,
girls jump higher,
jump higher.

614
00:31:54.770 --> 00:31:57.880
He's trying to get jiggled going.
And I see,
I go to Eddie Ego,

615
00:31:57.881 --> 00:32:00.670
there's too much dupont out there,
man and Eddie,

616
00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:03.970
cause I love you don't have Draeger's what?
Then he goes,

617
00:32:03.971 --> 00:32:05.950
he tells me what he said,
director lady goes,
yeah,
you're right.
All right,

618
00:32:05.951 --> 00:32:08.920
let's shoot the scene and forget it.
Oh,
it's all silicon man.

619
00:32:08.921 --> 00:32:12.990
Ain't no jiggling happen.
Now.
How was Eddie handling a,
I mean,

620
00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:16.180
did you know Eddie before?
Yeah.
Knowing from back in New York in the day.

621
00:32:16.210 --> 00:32:20.440
I mean the first time he came in the,
in Provos I was the MC on Sunday night.

622
00:32:20.441 --> 00:32:22.510
I was like the regular when I was in town,
I wasn't,

623
00:32:22.610 --> 00:32:25.450
when I was down like 46 or 45th street on the west side.

624
00:32:25.510 --> 00:32:28.810
It was on 44th 44th and ninth.
Right.
Right there.
Yeah.

625
00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:32.060
Cause I used to live in that neighborhood and we used to go down and uh,

626
00:32:32.530 --> 00:32:33.430
I read this whole thing.

627
00:32:33.431 --> 00:32:36.160
It might've been something I heard from you or something and it's almost like

628
00:32:36.161 --> 00:32:38.560
it's a pizza place or something.

629
00:32:38.561 --> 00:32:42.950
And that's where prior that really robbed video of him just standing when he was

630
00:32:43.130 --> 00:32:46.800
stopped being the bill Cosby clone and he was turned into Richard.

631
00:32:46.801 --> 00:32:51.200
Like he literally was turning in to Richard Pryor the greatest of all time.

632
00:32:51.201 --> 00:32:55.790
And like that always blew my mind that that was within like 15 blocks of where I

633
00:32:55.791 --> 00:32:58.940
lived.
And I would go in there and get the pizza.
The pizza was only okay,

634
00:32:59.350 --> 00:33:01.490
but I just wanted to be like set like see that wall.

635
00:33:01.670 --> 00:33:04.430
Well just wondering where the fucking stage was.
Yeah.

636
00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:07.340
Can I ask a total key question when you walked into that,

637
00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:11.930
because it's basically the same space,
right?
Where was the stage walk in

638
00:33:12.130 --> 00:33:14.140
<v 2>the stage is all in the back of the room.
There was a,</v>

639
00:33:14.141 --> 00:33:18.850
there was an emergency door exit right by the stage and the stage is a little,

640
00:33:18.910 --> 00:33:21.720
you know,
was it all one room?
There was no walls.
He didn't want them.

641
00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:24.880
There's one room,
there was a bar,
there's a,
there's a bar out there.

642
00:33:24.881 --> 00:33:27.400
Everybody hung out in the bar.
It was a good bar,
cool bar.

643
00:33:27.401 --> 00:33:31.120
Everybody hung out there and then you'd walk through this little narrow noodle,

644
00:33:31.121 --> 00:33:32.920
narrow hallway but short,
you know,

645
00:33:32.921 --> 00:33:36.300
and the men's bathroom was on the right hand side of literally like a toilet and

646
00:33:36.301 --> 00:33:39.310
a in a sink in,
in like a windows little closets.

647
00:33:39.850 --> 00:33:43.300
And then you'd walk in this little hall and the light was right there.

648
00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:44.680
It's like by the service bar.

649
00:33:45.130 --> 00:33:48.220
So if you're on stage and you see Rodney come under that light,
you know,

650
00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:51.130
you go danger fields here,
it got to get off,
got to get into riding on quick.

651
00:33:51.131 --> 00:33:53.650
He's making the rounds,
getting ready to do a tonight show or something.

652
00:33:53.651 --> 00:33:56.060
So you'd see people pop up into that light area,

653
00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:58.960
probably see his fucking silhouette too.
And you know who he was?
Oh yeah.

654
00:33:58.961 --> 00:34:01.900
You just see him.
You just see me.
Just he pop any man.
As soon as you saw him,

655
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.520
he pop out and you know,
get up.
And Rodney,
I was like,

656
00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:07.680
because I saw Rodney and I was on the stage.
I'd cut mid joke,
you know,

657
00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:09.970
and then that,
hey,
we've got a special guest here.

658
00:34:11.730 --> 00:34:15.090
<v 1>And right away I remember going off and Rodney coming on and goes,
hey,</v>

659
00:34:15.091 --> 00:34:17.640
you know how to fucking move the kid though has moved,
man.
He moves.

660
00:34:17.850 --> 00:34:20.340
He goes on a move.
That's awesome man.
You know,
like that,

661
00:34:20.430 --> 00:34:25.280
it just reminded me one time I did a,
uh,
I did a benefit at this,
um,

662
00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:28.170
theater in beacon,
beacon theater.

663
00:34:28.171 --> 00:34:29.700
I forgot what the hell the goddamned benefit was.

664
00:34:29.701 --> 00:34:33.720
What was the sickest lineup I was ever on.
It was a,
John Stewart was hosting,

665
00:34:33.721 --> 00:34:37.380
Max Weinberg brought his band.
Tony Bennett goes on first,

666
00:34:37.410 --> 00:34:38.850
then Bruce Springsteen,

667
00:34:39.810 --> 00:34:44.700
then the auctioned off one of his guitars to this rich crowd that goes for like

668
00:34:44.701 --> 00:34:48.240
a hundred grand.
Then fucking Joe Mchale had to follow that.

669
00:34:49.410 --> 00:34:53.760
Like I,
Joe McHale's got,
he has to have the,
I followed fucking story.
Right.

670
00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:57.720
Um,
and then I went up after him,
which,
you know,

671
00:34:57.721 --> 00:35:01.170
he was the total buffer to get it back to,
all right.
Settle down here.
Right.

672
00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:04.350
Your expectations.
This is what you paid for you.
Right.

673
00:35:04.770 --> 00:35:07.910
And Seinfeld was closing.
That was the lineup.
And um,

674
00:35:08.010 --> 00:35:09.960
I remember when I was doing my set,

675
00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:13.350
I was conscious about not being too dirty cause I mean Seinfeld's like the king.

676
00:35:13.351 --> 00:35:15.060
And I remember looking over,

677
00:35:15.061 --> 00:35:18.900
I was getting close to the end of my set and he was standing on the side of the,

678
00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:23.940
uh,
the stage and you know,
the light was behind him.
So he was like back lit.

679
00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:29.100
And I,
I knew who he was with his silhouette.
Like that's how famous this guy is.

680
00:35:29.101 --> 00:35:32.640
And to me,
and it wasn't just Jerry hanging out,
he had the suit on,

681
00:35:32.641 --> 00:35:36.810
it was Jerry ready to go to work.
And I was immediately thinking like,
oh my God,

682
00:35:36.811 --> 00:35:39.990
am I too blue?
Is he going to hate me?
Am I pissing him off?

683
00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:43.530
Am I going over [inaudible]?
And I remember when I got off stage,

684
00:35:44.010 --> 00:35:46.890
he went like a,
I walked by him and I was just,
and I was just,

685
00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:50.130
I was almost afraid to say hello.
I just like walked by and east went very funny,

686
00:35:50.131 --> 00:35:54.140
very funny.
And then I apologize for working,
you know the way I do.
I said,

687
00:35:54.170 --> 00:35:57.300
oh sorry,
blah blah blah.
And he goes,
I don't care.
You almost like laugh.

688
00:35:57.301 --> 00:35:59.610
Like dude,
I don't give a shit.
And I'm thinking like,
that's right.

689
00:35:59.611 --> 00:36:03.750
This guy always worked clean and he worked cleaned before there was even comedy

690
00:36:03.751 --> 00:36:04.290
clubs.

691
00:36:04.290 --> 00:36:08.430
So I can't imagine him going on after these guys who would chug a beer and then

692
00:36:08.431 --> 00:36:10.770
burp and be like,
that's what I learned in college.

693
00:36:10.771 --> 00:36:12.840
And like that's sorta energy is fun,

694
00:36:12.990 --> 00:36:16.740
but it whips them into like this Fred Frat boy frenzy.

695
00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:21.060
And then you gotta go up there and if you have like a more of a,
you know,

696
00:36:21.090 --> 00:36:24.360
just straight lace kinda like,
yeah,
I mean I have a beer every once in a while,

697
00:36:24.361 --> 00:36:27.150
but guys,
like I'm not letting this totally affect my life,
you know.

698
00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:30.490
<v 2>Well first of all,
I love the fact that you did that.
That's the training.</v>

699
00:36:30.610 --> 00:36:34.180
Got in Boston and go,
I'm part of this show.
I know I'm not closing,

700
00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:37.040
so I'm going to respect the headliner.
Oh yeah.
How it works here.

701
00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:39.510
<v 1>Oh,
that was another,
that was another way that you would get,</v>

702
00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:43.380
you would get blackballed.
I remember,
uh,
there was a comedian up there,

703
00:36:43.530 --> 00:36:47.010
Mike Donovan,
you ever work with them?
I know who he is.
Fucking hilarious guy.

704
00:36:47.011 --> 00:36:49.890
And he used to always say this thing was hilarious and it'd be like,

705
00:36:49.891 --> 00:36:53.280
it'd be like,
yeah,
just go up there,
uh,
you know,
do like 20 minutes,
you know,

706
00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:57.900
keep it like,
you know,
three to five fucks is,
what are you saying?
It is a thing.

707
00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:03.300
He wasn't bullshitting.
He was just like,
people in Boston counted the fucks.

708
00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:08.430
So I remember,
uh,
you know,
sometimes going over it and being in a panic,
like,

709
00:37:08.431 --> 00:37:09.240
oh my God,

710
00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:13.230
that was my sixth fuck Donovan's going to call my Clark and I'm going to be,

711
00:37:13.231 --> 00:37:17.850
I'm going to be ruined in this town.
I said fuck six times.
So,
um,
I mean,

712
00:37:17.851 --> 00:37:20.310
I don't want to sit there and be like the old guys and just cause I don't know

713
00:37:20.311 --> 00:37:24.900
what it is like for kids coming up now and mindset kids to me now or anyone up

714
00:37:24.901 --> 00:37:28.230
to like 32,
33,
um,
coming up now.

715
00:37:28.231 --> 00:37:31.500
But I'm sure that they have their,
uh,
their whole way that,

716
00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:34.060
<v 2>that they don't always change it.
But I like that.
But you know,</v>

717
00:37:34.510 --> 00:37:37.200
Seipel always had that discipline.
I remember working with him again,

718
00:37:37.210 --> 00:37:41.110
these Jersey gigs,
so he's,
Jersey gigs were like $55 Jersey.
This started,

719
00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:44.290
there was like the first paying gigs we could get,
go out to Jersey and some bar.

720
00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:46.990
Right.
And so,
you know,
it's survival time in a bar.

721
00:37:46.991 --> 00:37:49.360
So a lot of guys would be like,
what do I gotta do to get by,
you know,

722
00:37:49.570 --> 00:37:53.590
fuck with a garage,
shit,
Dick Jokes,
whatever I gotta do to get by.
Right.

723
00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:58.380
And I remember working with Jerry on time and he goes on and he'd follow all of

724
00:37:58.381 --> 00:38:02.740
that and he stays right to what he's doing.
Man Works Clean.
Brings him to him.

725
00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:06.040
No,
but he wasn't killing it.
It's not like all,
they all came to him.

726
00:38:06.041 --> 00:38:09.670
They were like,
oh wait,
the parties over it,
it wasn't great,
but he never broke.

727
00:38:09.671 --> 00:38:12.790
He never wavered.
And afterwards I'd go,
wow man.
He goes,
he goes,

728
00:38:12.850 --> 00:38:15.700
I'm getting ready to do it tonight.
Shows that's what I'm preparing to do.

729
00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:17.950
He had the folks who had the long reach focus.
He was like,

730
00:38:17.951 --> 00:38:21.100
I'm practicing this material here now because I'm going to do this on the

731
00:38:21.101 --> 00:38:23.530
tonight show.
I'm working this out now.

732
00:38:23.531 --> 00:38:27.280
I'm not worried about my $55 Jersey Gates.
Well,
he's one of those guys,

733
00:38:27.281 --> 00:38:31.360
long range view.
He's one of those guys that he just fucking knew where you I've,

734
00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:33.130
yes,
he,
I knew

735
00:38:33.130 --> 00:38:35.860
<v 1>where he was going and he just,
uh,</v>

736
00:38:35.890 --> 00:38:38.650
you'll never meet a guy that doesn't suffer fools the way he does.

737
00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:40.880
I still want to get around.
Am I getting nervous?
I'm like,
I'm like,

738
00:38:40.890 --> 00:38:44.200
I'm going to say one stupid thing and this guy is going gonna I'm going to get

739
00:38:44.201 --> 00:38:48.520
that look.
And that's just going to be,
you'll try the long,
the same way.

740
00:38:48.521 --> 00:38:51.820
Like his act is the way he lives his life.
There's no fat,

741
00:38:52.180 --> 00:38:54.520
there's no extra words or any of that type of shit.

742
00:38:54.521 --> 00:38:58.870
And then the guy just fucking,
just like,
he just walks towards what he wants,

743
00:38:58.871 --> 00:39:01.660
walks right through it.
I mean,
not,
not,
not like in a malicious way.

744
00:39:01.930 --> 00:39:05.230
Just like he just,
I on the fucking prize.
That guy,

745
00:39:05.350 --> 00:39:07.840
you don't go back in the day guys,
we're going like,
you know,
and I'm like,

746
00:39:07.841 --> 00:39:10.360
is that cause you don't really know who he is up there go.

747
00:39:10.450 --> 00:39:12.910
Are you fucking paying attention?
Yeah.
You know?
Exactly.

748
00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:16.090
You know what pissed this guy off the missing sock in a fucking dryer.

749
00:39:16.990 --> 00:39:19.540
That's who he is,
man.
I just paid attention.

750
00:39:19.541 --> 00:39:22.750
He's fucking paying attention to the details.
That's what's irritating.
This guy,

751
00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:25.870
I did his web series one time and I told them that.
I told them I hated that.

752
00:39:25.871 --> 00:39:28.510
They said his show is a show about nothing.
It's like,
no it isn't.

753
00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:33.840
This guy has contempt for 90% of people and activities.

754
00:39:34.090 --> 00:39:36.250
I was actually nervous saying it to him and he laughed and he goes,

755
00:39:36.251 --> 00:39:40.150
I think you're being generous by saying you know that it's only 90% percent.

756
00:39:40.151 --> 00:39:44.710
Yeah.
Um,
that's so fucking cool.
So when did like,

757
00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:49.630
uh,
Oh God,
there's so many things I want to ask you this as far as,
so the Improv,

758
00:39:49.690 --> 00:39:53.200
the Improv started in New York City and then they opened the La one,
right?

759
00:39:53.230 --> 00:39:56.500
Cause they opened the la one because he realized everything was moving out to
la.

760
00:39:56.501 --> 00:40:00.580
When Johnny moved with Carson,
moved,
that was when he moved to the 72.

761
00:40:00.581 --> 00:40:03.790
The whole thing shifted.
The axis shifted,
right?

762
00:40:03.791 --> 00:40:07.570
Everybody had to go out to La and the comedy stores just opened them.

763
00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:11.590
So La comedy store became people going on on the tonight show going,
yeah,

764
00:40:11.591 --> 00:40:15.850
I work out the comedy store in La.
That became the place.
Wow.
Right.

765
00:40:15.851 --> 00:40:17.820
So buddy's like I got to get out there.
Yeah.

766
00:40:18.070 --> 00:40:21.540
And then the cause he wasn't getting the brand recognition and no,

767
00:40:21.550 --> 00:40:22.061
he was getting the,

768
00:40:22.061 --> 00:40:25.270
when he was in New York and the comics go on the tonight show in New York and
go,

769
00:40:25.271 --> 00:40:28.870
I've worked out the Improv here in New York,
like Klein or those comics.

770
00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:32.870
But then it shifted immediately it,
that's why Leno went right out to La la,

771
00:40:32.871 --> 00:40:36.690
no salt,
Freddie Prinze go on the tonight show and say,

772
00:40:36.691 --> 00:40:38.380
I'm working at the comedy store and Linda Goes,

773
00:40:38.850 --> 00:40:41.230
I've got to get out to the economy store.
Yeah.
Right.

774
00:40:41.350 --> 00:40:46.350
And so the franchise didn't start opening until the eighties like 84 when Mark

775
00:40:46.750 --> 00:40:48.850
Anderson opened one in San Diego.
Then that started,

776
00:40:48.851 --> 00:40:50.830
he started opening up this franchise.

777
00:40:50.831 --> 00:40:55.590
Did Bud like bud franchise out franchise that when he saw the whole boom happen,

778
00:40:55.950 --> 00:40:58.060
that's when he made money.
That's when he really made money.

779
00:40:58.061 --> 00:41:02.140
Mark Anderson opened his clubs and bud was making you,
it's like the Trump thing.

780
00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:04.360
Well I've heard a lot of that stuff that says Trump on it.
They're,

781
00:41:04.361 --> 00:41:06.670
they're paying for the name for the name.
That's so,

782
00:41:07.490 --> 00:41:10.650
so bud was getting like a gross of every club.
I think I gotta ask him,

783
00:41:11.170 --> 00:41:15.670
cause like I,
you know,
you're doing the tonight show with Johnny Carson,

784
00:41:15.671 --> 00:41:19.930
which has to be the most nerve wracking.
Huge possible thing.

785
00:41:19.931 --> 00:41:23.060
Like sleepless nights and like,
yeah.
What year did you,

786
00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:26.060
did you first do 84 you didn't [inaudible] 85 oh my God.

787
00:41:26.470 --> 00:41:27.370
So you're going to go on there.

788
00:41:27.371 --> 00:41:31.240
I mean it's just at that point it's that show like I feel bad for young people.

789
00:41:31.241 --> 00:41:35.780
They don't understand how huge that fucking show was.
It was just like,
it was,

790
00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:39.410
it was everything.
Everybody's was the Beatles on Ed Sullivan.

791
00:41:39.411 --> 00:41:43.250
It was comic,
it was everything.
It was everything.
So you,

792
00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:47.180
they tell you,
you're getting the show.
So you must be like over the moon,
excited.

793
00:41:47.181 --> 00:41:51.020
And then for me,
what were immediately hit would be the dread of like,

794
00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:51.861
I'll fuck now,

795
00:41:51.861 --> 00:41:56.861
I have to do this and I have to somehow compartmentalize the fucking terror of

796
00:41:57.801 --> 00:42:01.100
this guy who can either invite me over,
give me the okay.

797
00:42:01.490 --> 00:42:06.490
Or all of my peers are going to see that he didn't like me cause I watch that

798
00:42:07.181 --> 00:42:09.770
shit.
So everybody watched it.
Yeah.
So here's the deal,
how it worked,

799
00:42:09.771 --> 00:42:13.550
and correct me if I'm wrong here,
he would give you,
what would he give you?
The,

800
00:42:13.551 --> 00:42:17.000
okay.
He didn't call you.
You need to call you over.
That was the highest.

801
00:42:17.001 --> 00:42:20.120
That's it all you got the,
okay,
so you still coming back,
right,

802
00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:21.880
which is accepted for the first time.
You'll know.

803
00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:26.570
But then there was the one where he would just be like [inaudible] drumming his

804
00:42:26.571 --> 00:42:30.740
pencil on the table and take his pencil and just drumming it and not looking at

805
00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:35.450
you.
And that was like it.
Man.
That was the worst.
Uh,
and he knew he was,

806
00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:38.360
he knew what he was doing to the comment.
Cut that down.
I read it.

807
00:42:38.361 --> 00:42:41.330
I read that book that his lawyer read.
I mean it was great book.

808
00:42:41.390 --> 00:42:44.780
How ice cold his mother was like the ability to do that.

809
00:42:44.781 --> 00:42:47.960
It's like that's the trickle down effect.
Um,

810
00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:52.460
I'll tell you how I dealt with doing Letterman because Letterman was my Carson.

811
00:42:52.850 --> 00:42:54.800
Like I literally had to,

812
00:42:55.460 --> 00:42:58.520
I was so fucking like thinking,
what am I gonna do?

813
00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:02.780
I had to like work up like a healthy level of hatred cause that's just how I'm

814
00:43:02.781 --> 00:43:06.140
wired.
I'd be like,
yeah,
fuck this guy for making me so fucking that name.

815
00:43:06.190 --> 00:43:07.910
He was a great guy,
came over,
shook my hand and everything.

816
00:43:07.911 --> 00:43:12.890
But like I had to literally be thinking,
fuck this guy and then to go out there.

817
00:43:12.891 --> 00:43:13.940
So I went out there and I had,

818
00:43:13.941 --> 00:43:17.390
thank God I had a great set and I remember like you see it on TV and you think

819
00:43:17.391 --> 00:43:20.090
he's fucking 80 yards this way and the band's a hundred yards.

820
00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:21.500
They're all right there.

821
00:43:21.501 --> 00:43:25.040
Like you could take two steps over and shake Paul's hand.
Another three.

822
00:43:25.070 --> 00:43:28.190
You could shake days.
And I remember doing my set,
hearing Dave laugh.

823
00:43:28.430 --> 00:43:33.140
And it was such a fucking,
it was more of a relief.
It's like,

824
00:43:33.141 --> 00:43:35.390
oh my God,
he's laughing and he's laughing.
And I was,
you know,

825
00:43:36.290 --> 00:43:36.921
[inaudible] getting married.

826
00:43:36.921 --> 00:43:39.140
So it was like in the wheelhouse cause he wasn't married or anything like that

827
00:43:39.230 --> 00:43:41.060
as it was.
I don't know.
I just remember thinking like,

828
00:43:41.270 --> 00:43:45.620
I was so fucking relieved when it was over matter.
I was just so relieved.

829
00:43:45.621 --> 00:43:48.560
So tell me what that was it,
but sort of a Letterman show,

830
00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.650
Letterman was always behind you on camera.
So the orange could,
you were,

831
00:43:51.710 --> 00:43:53.540
they were letting me,
it was in the sight line.

832
00:43:53.570 --> 00:43:55.730
So they're looking at you and seeing Letterman over your shoulder.

833
00:43:56.210 --> 00:44:00.290
So if you'd have Letterman laughing,
you could die.
Oh Wow.
You know,

834
00:44:00.291 --> 00:44:04.680
so by the time I did,
and they didn't have,
like,
he was already over at cvs says,

835
00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:09.830
I'm talking bout the NBC show.
Okay.
So anyway,
84 I was in New York of,
because,

836
00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:13.010
uh,
I left the summer Olympics,
we're out here and I said,

837
00:44:13.011 --> 00:44:14.720
I'm going to get out of La.
There's going to be a mess.

838
00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:19.870
And so Kennison and I booked over to New York for the summer and I was there and

839
00:44:20.331 --> 00:44:22.430
I was working out and Jim McCauley,
the tonight show,

840
00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:24.470
booker saw me in New York and said and said,

841
00:44:24.620 --> 00:44:28.340
your ready man want to do it in two weeks.
It was all funny.
I like to,

842
00:44:28.430 --> 00:44:31.980
so you know what,
as you cobble this block,
people don't understand.
It's

843
00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:33.510
<v 2>a very unnatural set back then.</v>

844
00:44:33.511 --> 00:44:35.850
I don't know how to do it then maybe they just pull five minutes out of the rack

845
00:44:36.020 --> 00:44:38.460
in tack on five.
But you pull like a greatest hits thing.

846
00:44:38.670 --> 00:44:40.200
You pull a joke from this bit,

847
00:44:40.201 --> 00:44:43.800
you pull the two hours and you cobbled together with these weird segues.
Right.

848
00:44:43.801 --> 00:44:45.150
You know you do a skiing,

849
00:44:45.180 --> 00:44:47.040
water skiing joke than you and you know when you come out on water,

850
00:44:47.130 --> 00:44:49.220
your hair's messed up.
You know what,
I get my haircut and then was like

851
00:44:51.180 --> 00:44:52.990
torture speaking hair.
Oh,
it's horrible.
Yeah.

852
00:44:53.470 --> 00:44:56.850
And so I put this set together,
you know,

853
00:44:56.851 --> 00:44:59.610
that he helped me with and then I'm practicing it every night.
You know,

854
00:44:59.611 --> 00:45:02.940
just going into clubs every night.
Then many times I could run out to Jersey Gig,

855
00:45:02.941 --> 00:45:05.610
coming back,
doing a bunch of monitoring while you're brushing your teeth,

856
00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:09.320
the whole fucking thing.
Completely freaking out.
And I,
I,

857
00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:12.600
I was drinking and doing a lot of blow back then.
So I was like,
I've got to quit.

858
00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:15.700
I've got to quit.
So a week before I thought this,

859
00:45:15.930 --> 00:45:17.250
I'm not going to drink and do drugs.

860
00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:19.740
But you high when they told you you got the Gig?
Oh yeah.

861
00:45:19.741 --> 00:45:22.290
We went out to a bar afterwards.
Macaulay and I went up to a bar when he said,

862
00:45:22.291 --> 00:45:25.140
you got it.
Let's go talk about it.
We went out to a bar drinking.

863
00:45:25.141 --> 00:45:28.010
I didn't do blown in front of him cause I didn't know whether he did it or not.

864
00:45:28.030 --> 00:45:32.910
I wasn't gonna risk that,
you know,
but we were drinking.
Yeah.
Hell yeah.
And uh,

865
00:45:32.911 --> 00:45:36.690
I got so stressed out,
I got shingles,
I broke out in shingles.
Oh my God.
You know,

866
00:45:36.860 --> 00:45:37.290
buy my,

867
00:45:37.290 --> 00:45:40.530
my ass and my leg would just blistered up and I didn't know what that was.

868
00:45:40.531 --> 00:45:43.470
I went to the doctor said you got shingles,
man,
and all that.
Yeah,

869
00:45:43.471 --> 00:45:45.240
you got shingles.
That's an old man's thing.
What are you,

870
00:45:45.241 --> 00:45:48.800
what are you stressed out about?
Some,
yeah.
Let me see.
I'm doing the tonight shit.

871
00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:52.260
Yeah.
Then he's probably like,
wait,
when is it?
Yeah,
answer the stress.

872
00:45:52.410 --> 00:45:54.600
Cause now I know you're watching it.
You're going to be at home going like,

873
00:45:54.810 --> 00:45:59.730
and it's funny,
I got shingles.
He's got blisters on his ass.

874
00:45:59.790 --> 00:46:03.780
Wow.
Yeah.
And so you're standing backstage,
right?

875
00:46:04.530 --> 00:46:07.620
This is Burbank,
obviously 80 before the shooting of Burbank.

876
00:46:07.621 --> 00:46:10.410
So the fucking curtain was iconic.

877
00:46:11.070 --> 00:46:14.670
That fucking golden blue and weird ass.
All those weird colors.

878
00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:18.000
All I could think about was fucking up.
I mean,
literally,
I'm like going,

879
00:46:18.060 --> 00:46:21.900
I can't fuck up.
You're not thinking about how much fun you're going to have.

880
00:46:22.380 --> 00:46:25.020
I didn't think like,
Oh,
I'm gonna put this coming fun man.

881
00:46:26.190 --> 00:46:28.800
I earned this.
I deserve this.

882
00:46:28.801 --> 00:46:31.530
I'm going to go out and go in and have a good time and say,
what's up Johnny?

883
00:46:31.531 --> 00:46:34.400
You're not just like,
yeah,
yeah.
Did you have the panic thought of what if I,

884
00:46:34.470 --> 00:46:36.930
what if I forget where I am?
What if I forget what I'm saying?

885
00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:38.140
Cause I then had it,

886
00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:41.370
didn't that happen to somebody say happened to me all my HBO special,

887
00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:45.840
I blanked on my HBO special.
Oh God.
For how long?

888
00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:51.570
When I had to stop taping I just went,
I'm lost,
I'm lost.

889
00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:54.810
Because it was getting,
it was now instead of a five minutes unnatural,

890
00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:59.100
I cobbled together a half hour out of like hours of material and posted that,

891
00:46:59.130 --> 00:47:02.730
you know,
like just all together.
Just kind of just cut and paste,
cut and paste.

892
00:47:03.060 --> 00:47:05.490
And I was practicing that for a long time and I got out there and I just went,

893
00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:07.010
what am I doing?
What's the,
you know,

894
00:47:07.110 --> 00:47:09.000
it's like one of those things where you going,
what the fuck am I doing?

895
00:47:09.180 --> 00:47:12.130
Is almost like diff from death of a salesman.
What am I,

896
00:47:12.310 --> 00:47:13.740
what is contentious bid here?

897
00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:17.310
What happens is you go out there and rather than just doing a show,

898
00:47:17.550 --> 00:47:20.820
you know you're being watched and then you start watching yourself and then you

899
00:47:20.821 --> 00:47:23.610
leave yourself.
And then you're sitting in the crowd going,

900
00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:27.750
why is he moving his arm like that?
Cause you're literally thinking,
oh,

901
00:47:27.751 --> 00:47:29.900
I'll do it.
We've all fucking bet.
Yeah.

902
00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:32.050
So when you're standing behind that curtain and you just,

903
00:47:32.430 --> 00:47:35.920
it just adrenaline was unbelievable.
It was unbelievable.

904
00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:38.640
Then you walk out and then you hit it.
And as soon as it,

905
00:47:38.650 --> 00:47:40.120
but it's like every other time,

906
00:47:40.150 --> 00:47:43.600
I mean my literally my mind went blank like every time before I go on stage,

907
00:47:43.601 --> 00:47:47.110
my mind goes blank.
If you go,
what?
Jokingly the what joke?
I don't have any jokes.

908
00:47:47.290 --> 00:47:49.570
I can't remember anything.
Yeah,
totally blank.
Right.

909
00:47:49.930 --> 00:47:53.710
It walk out there to that first joke,
get the first laugh and go,
yeah,

910
00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:57.370
you're locked in that first laugh and you're locked in.
So you went out,

911
00:47:57.371 --> 00:48:01.120
you did your first joke.
Yeah.
How did it do?
Good laugh.
Got a good laugh.

912
00:48:01.150 --> 00:48:03.790
And you know when you're doing it,
you're playing it.
Everybody says,

913
00:48:03.791 --> 00:48:06.280
the first joke is just I'm seeing you and hearing you for the first time.

914
00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:08.560
So don't expect that big laugh so you don't put your,
you know,

915
00:48:08.561 --> 00:48:12.100
you know I always was told that the three jokes in,

916
00:48:12.101 --> 00:48:15.520
that's your first killer joke,
right?
You know,
three jokes in.

917
00:48:15.521 --> 00:48:17.650
That should be your first killer joke.
That's how you kind of planned it.

918
00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:21.310
I know they all right fucking guys write their ideas and then the fifth joke

919
00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:25.330
should be this.
Then you'd sell more shit to think about.
It is so natural.

920
00:48:25.340 --> 00:48:28.330
It's so,
it was unnatural.
You go out there and you end up,

921
00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:31.370
you end up having had this,
I would really good set.
Have a really good set set.

922
00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:36.000
You'll now you're like,
how long did it feel to look over at Johnny?
Like fuck,
oh,

923
00:48:36.230 --> 00:48:40.330
I'm going to lock eyes with this guy that looked over big smile,
you know,

924
00:48:40.331 --> 00:48:43.430
big smile and a circle finger like you said,
like big.
Okay.
And I go,
oh,

925
00:48:43.431 --> 00:48:47.780
can I came back stage?
And Jim McCauley greets me.
Got a beer,
hands be a beer.

926
00:48:48.100 --> 00:48:50.800
Great.
Fantastic man to stand over here.
Stand over here.

927
00:48:50.890 --> 00:48:53.380
The end to show you stand here.
And when Carson walks back,

928
00:48:53.381 --> 00:48:56.950
the way he walks back a re after we show this route,

929
00:48:56.951 --> 00:49:00.250
he takes backstage,
you're going right there on the route.
He stops,

930
00:49:00.251 --> 00:49:04.080
shakes your hand.
That was great.
Get a photo op,
fantastic.
Come back soon.

931
00:49:04.081 --> 00:49:05.530
You can come back.
So yeah,
got a picture.

932
00:49:05.531 --> 00:49:08.530
You know you got a picture and you're to stand there going.
Okay.

933
00:49:08.531 --> 00:49:13.300
And then he is fantastic.
He moves on right?
And you're like,

934
00:49:13.510 --> 00:49:18.160
this is it.
And then you go back into the Improv that night in on Melrose,

935
00:49:18.161 --> 00:49:22.540
in West,
you know West Hollywood,
right?
Everybody was there.
They turn the TV up,

936
00:49:22.750 --> 00:49:24.890
everybody in a bar standing there,
you're standing there.

937
00:49:25.020 --> 00:49:27.460
It kills me about how they redid that.
Now they got the bar upstairs.

938
00:49:27.461 --> 00:49:29.320
It's like all,
all that history,
you guys,

939
00:49:29.530 --> 00:49:32.510
all those people had stood there watching that friends to height show sex.

940
00:49:32.620 --> 00:49:34.630
Everybody who leaned on that fucking bar kills me.

941
00:49:34.631 --> 00:49:36.860
At least they didn't end demolish.
And John,

942
00:49:37.060 --> 00:49:38.650
Johnny used to say the same thing when a new comic,

943
00:49:38.651 --> 00:49:41.980
I'm glad you're in a good mood tonight because we've got a new comic coming on,

944
00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:44.470
right?
And the comics would mouth it and,

945
00:49:44.530 --> 00:49:46.690
and some would actually say it out loud with Johnny.

946
00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:51.310
That's how much everybody knew that.
Wow.
That,
that,
that routine.
Right,

947
00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:53.780
right.
And you stand there and it's like,
yeah.

948
00:49:53.790 --> 00:49:57.910
Everybody saw how much bloated you do that night when you to fucking pass that

949
00:49:57.911 --> 00:50:01.780
Jesus Christ.
I had coke in my pocket when I walked out onto the set that day.

950
00:50:03.430 --> 00:50:06.220
That's how much I knew.
I was like,

951
00:50:06.221 --> 00:50:10.570
when you watch run like fucking Ron Burgundy and all those fucking movies that I

952
00:50:10.571 --> 00:50:13.630
look more like a documentary to you than rather than a comedy.
It's like,
yeah,

953
00:50:13.631 --> 00:50:16.330
we did all that.
I had a suit like that.
I wore that on the tonight show.

954
00:50:16.331 --> 00:50:20.980
I had blow in my pocket.

956
00:50:22.260 --> 00:50:25.570

957
00:50:25.571 --> 00:50:27.880
that's never going to end.

960
00:50:35.601 --> 00:50:37.280
I could ask you a Zillion,

961
00:50:37.910 --> 00:50:41.630
how do you not talk to a guy who fucking had coke in his pocket when he does the

962
00:50:41.631 --> 00:50:45.830
fucking tonight show?
You're like,
I'm doing this either way.

963
00:50:45.860 --> 00:50:48.680

myself.
So his book is called kicking through the ashes.

<v 4>I was riding on the Mayflower when a photo spots and the land.</v>

1082
00:57:31.880 --> 00:57:36.880
I am for captain a rep a have you on the stand who came running to the deck?

1083
00:57:39.590 --> 00:57:42.440
Zed Boys.
Forget the whale.
What?
Going on?

1084
00:57:43.620 --> 00:57:48.620
Young Kathy and engines changed to see how on the bowline noise sang then

1085
00:57:50.030 --> 00:57:54.860
Melodie tough sailors do and the fire with Red Sea.

1086
00:57:55.230 --> 00:57:59.770
<v 5>Yeah.
Have yourself a merry little Christmas</v>

1087
00:58:02.170 --> 00:58:05.230
led.
The you tied glow.

1088
00:58:06.370 --> 00:58:09.450
I don't know though was bad.

1089
00:58:10.050 --> 00:58:11.560
I'm gonna keep going.

1090
00:58:13.170 --> 00:58:18.170
Here we are playing patty cake with some mistletoe and a

1091
00:58:22.630 --> 00:58:23.463
[inaudible].

1092
00:58:24.580 --> 00:58:29.580
Santa Claus has in itchy beard and big black boots sit in his lab.

1093
00:58:35.080 --> 00:58:39.250
I don't know why.
I can't say merry Christmas.

1094
00:58:39.251 --> 00:58:44.251
Somewhere along the line it became offensive even though I don't mean anything

1095
00:58:45.401 --> 00:58:48.820
bad by a
lot of,

1096
00:58:48.821 --> 00:58:52.690
some Mexican came up to you and said,

1097
00:58:52.691 --> 00:58:56.020
happy Cinco de my.
Yo,

1098
00:58:56.770 --> 00:58:59.770
what'd you say?
Dude?
What the fucking fuck.

1099
00:59:00.580 --> 00:59:03.550
It's all just April to me.

1100
00:59:08.970 --> 00:59:09.150
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

1101
00:59:09.150 --> 00:59:13.130
<v 5>friends.
It's that time of year again.</v>

1102
00:59:13.400 --> 00:59:15.000
<v 6>Oh
boom.</v>

1103
00:59:16.470 --> 00:59:21.120
<v 5>When the fuck did you know,
say a merry Christmas,
become offensive,
Bah,
Bah,</v>

1104
00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:25.910
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah by Buddha.
You know,

1105
00:59:26.540 --> 00:59:29.150
I don't understand that shit.
Just cause they say it that,
you know,
I,

1106
00:59:29.190 --> 00:59:32.570
it's like if somebody Jewish said Happy Hanukkah to me,
uh,
you know,

1107
00:59:32.571 --> 00:59:37.040
I wouldn't be like,
you know,
what the fuck dude,
blah blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,

1108
00:59:37.041 --> 00:59:41.330
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
You know,
what the fuck?

1109
00:59:41.420 --> 00:59:44.600
I don't understand that.
I like seeing my Christmas makes me feel good,

1110
00:59:44.601 --> 00:59:45.810
makes me feel good right in my chest.

1111
00:59:45.900 --> 00:59:48.350
Feel a little warm feeling just like the Grinch,
you know,

1112
00:59:48.440 --> 00:59:53.090
when his little heart kind of broke out of that little box.
Doo,
Doo,
Doo Doo,

1113
00:59:53.091 --> 00:59:57.080
Doo Doo.
This is a little holiday break down is a,
as I,

1114
00:59:57.360 --> 01:00:02.090
as I kick knowledge about the holidays,
um,

1115
01:00:02.150 --> 01:00:05.910
whatever.
So have yourselves,
and maybe a little Christmas he is,

1116
01:00:06.660 --> 01:00:11.660
I don't hate Muslims or Jews when I say merry Christmas.

1117
01:00:12.980 --> 01:00:17.270
So whatever group he's walking around saying it's offensive,

1118
01:00:17.510 --> 01:00:21.740
go fuck yourself.
Then you're fucking con.
Even if you're male,

1119
01:00:21.741 --> 01:00:26.741
you have a con because you've ruined part of my holiday.

1120
01:00:27.020 --> 01:00:31.490
I would never do that to you.
All right,
that's enough.

1121
01:00:31.491 --> 01:00:35.060
Jesus Christ.
Sorry.
You know.
Anyways,
how are you?

1122
01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:37.340
I know I'm tone deaf,
but you know,

1123
01:00:38.300 --> 01:00:40.970
I told you I was going to embrace the holidays and shit when I was at the

1124
01:00:40.971 --> 01:00:45.971
airport coming back from a Vancouver listen to this week that I had,

1125
01:00:46.671 --> 01:00:48.770
first of all,
this is the Monday morning podcast.

1126
01:00:49.460 --> 01:00:54.050
Usually if I'm going to sing badly,
I only do it for a couple of seconds,
but,
uh,

1127
01:00:54.140 --> 01:00:58.580
you know,
I don't know.
I just so I can,
I of felt it,
um,

1128
01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:01.010
and I was just in Canada and they say merry Christmas up there,

1129
01:01:01.011 --> 01:01:05.630
which makes me feel good because you know what?
That's what I say,
you know,

1130
01:01:06.380 --> 01:01:10.010
do I have to go to Canada now?
They listen to somebody say merry Christmas.

1131
01:01:10.370 --> 01:01:12.680
I don't know.
What if the fuck are these?
How big are these groups?

1132
01:01:12.681 --> 01:01:16.850
I think you just need like literally 18 people and they just,
you know,

1133
01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:21.410
they just hold up signs and they talk,
Oh,
what up?
Fuck Nah,
fuck.

1134
01:01:21.620 --> 01:01:23.180
And the way they frame it on the news,

1135
01:01:23.181 --> 01:01:27.890
they make it look like it's a zillion people.
You know,
I,
you know,
I don't know.

1136
01:01:29.780 --> 01:01:33.020
It's weird.
I'm trying to think of whatever said Merry Christmas to the two.

1137
01:01:33.050 --> 01:01:35.510
A friend of mine who's Jewish and he ever got offended.

1138
01:01:35.511 --> 01:01:39.830
I don't think they ever did
so well.
So what?

1139
01:01:39.860 --> 01:01:42.740
18 Una teeny of friends get offended by this shit.

1140
01:01:42.741 --> 01:01:46.040
And then you get to call yourselves a group and then you get to start walking

1141
01:01:46.041 --> 01:01:48.380
around telling people what's offensive and what isn't.

1142
01:01:48.381 --> 01:01:49.650
These are the holidays you can,

1143
01:01:50.990 --> 01:01:55.610
once you fucking open your hearts to another religion.
All right?
So anyways,

1144
01:01:55.611 --> 01:01:58.230
this is,
um,

1145
01:01:58.340 --> 01:02:01.760
listen to this fucking week that I had.
All right,

1146
01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:05.180
you want to talk about busy cause my brain is going to be all over the place.

1147
01:02:05.300 --> 01:02:07.580
I'm already telling you that.
All right?

1148
01:02:07.581 --> 01:02:12.370
And I might even sing another holiday fucking song if I feel like I'm eight

1149
01:02:12.380 --> 01:02:15.500
though.
Nobody's saying he can.
You know,
I don't understand the hostility.

1150
01:02:15.560 --> 01:02:18.170
Why don't you relax?
Okay.
You just got back from the airport.

1151
01:02:18.171 --> 01:02:21.660
You haven't showered yet.
You know,
you should have taken a little bit of time,

1152
01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:23.580
showered,
you know,

1153
01:02:24.060 --> 01:02:28.110
treated yourself and gotten yourself in a mindset where you can relax a little

1154
01:02:28.111 --> 01:02:30.510
more and do a happier podcast.
But you didn't,

1155
01:02:30.750 --> 01:02:33.780
you ordered a grilled cheese sandwich and some chicken noodle soup and you

1156
01:02:33.781 --> 01:02:37.740
fucking went right in wearing the clothes that you've been sitting in since last

1157
01:02:37.740 --> 01:02:41.280
night at the Canuck game and now you're laying on your bed.
That's disgusting.

1158
01:02:42.890 --> 01:02:44.820
Um,
anyways,
this is my week.
See what I did.

1159
01:02:44.821 --> 01:02:48.150
I just talked myself down thought more calmer tone.

1160
01:02:49.580 --> 01:02:52.710
I like this.
This is the new me.
This isn't the new me.

1161
01:02:52.711 --> 01:02:56.670
This is the guy I'm trying to be.
This is the person I think I was before.

1162
01:02:56.671 --> 01:02:58.680
A bunch of fucked up shit happened to me and became me.

1163
01:02:58.681 --> 01:03:01.740
This make me become like the screaming maniac than I am.

1164
01:03:02.340 --> 01:03:05.850
So I'm trying to get back in touch to me circuit in 1972,

1165
01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:11.310
um,
anyways,
um,
this is my week.
Monday

1166
01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:14.330
I saw,
uh,

1167
01:03:14.730 --> 01:03:19.730
I flew back from New York City after a wonderful engagement at Caroline's comedy

1168
01:03:20.071 --> 01:03:22.530
club.
And,
uh,
I landed,

1169
01:03:23.130 --> 01:03:28.130
I had a sandwich and then me and three of my friends all went down to the La

1170
01:03:31.650 --> 01:03:34.620
Forum.
We saw ACDC that was Monday,
you know,

1171
01:03:34.621 --> 01:03:38.940
most people would call it a fucking week right there and be like,
wow,

1172
01:03:38.970 --> 01:03:42.360
I just saw one of the most legendary rock bands of all time.

1173
01:03:43.590 --> 01:03:45.180
Brian Johnson's voice sounded unbelievable.

1174
01:03:45.450 --> 01:03:47.700
He looked like he was having the time of his life.

1175
01:03:48.030 --> 01:03:51.660
Angus was still jumping around and I'm sick of people on this tour going,
you,

1176
01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:56.180
you know,
Anglesey you know,
he's great,
but you know,
he kind of admit,
you know,

1177
01:03:56.190 --> 01:03:59.460
he kind of,
he's kind of lost a step.
It's like,
dude,
so have you,

1178
01:04:00.390 --> 01:04:03.990
I don't understand how people feel like,
you know,

1179
01:04:04.770 --> 01:04:08.460
they look at famous people like they're not supposed to age,
you know,

1180
01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:09.370
and you know,
if,

1181
01:04:09.371 --> 01:04:13.890
if people fucking videotaped you taken out your trash seven years ago,

1182
01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:15.720
the last time ACDC was on tour,

1183
01:04:15.900 --> 01:04:18.540
I bet you don't have such a big spring and y'all fucking step either.

1184
01:04:19.380 --> 01:04:22.980
Stop making fun of Angus,
the guys jumping around.
It's 53 years of age.

1185
01:04:23.010 --> 01:04:27.510
Never missing a note.
Try doing that at 16.
Tried doing the shit that he does.

1186
01:04:27.690 --> 01:04:31.470
I dare you to try that on you.
Fucking a you a little playstation game,

1187
01:04:31.471 --> 01:04:32.340
Guitar Hero.

1188
01:04:32.850 --> 01:04:36.090
You think you could do that for an hour and a half and then do a strip cheese

1189
01:04:36.091 --> 01:04:38.730
and moon the crowd and then come right back in.

1190
01:04:38.731 --> 01:04:42.360
Jump up a fucking drum riser and be right on the fucking one.

1191
01:04:42.390 --> 01:04:46.800
I don't think you could do that.
Leaving us alone.
They were the shit.

1192
01:04:47.070 --> 01:04:51.060
That was my Monday.
Right?
And then,
um,

1193
01:04:52.740 --> 01:04:56.070
Tuesday I began three straight,

1194
01:04:56.071 --> 01:04:59.160
12 hour days shooting my pilot for comedy central,

1195
01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:02.600
which could not have gone better.
I think.
Uh,

1196
01:05:02.610 --> 01:05:07.350
we got a lot of fucking hilarious stuff.
Um,
I made a very smart move.

1197
01:05:07.351 --> 01:05:12.120
I pulled the Seinfeld,
I learned a lot from Jerry Seinfeld.
You know,
he uh,

1198
01:05:12.121 --> 01:05:13.170
you know,
what did he do?

1199
01:05:13.171 --> 01:05:17.560
One time I watched him like and accept that accept an Emmy for his show and he

1200
01:05:17.561 --> 01:05:20.620
said something to the effect of,
Hi,

1201
01:05:20.621 --> 01:05:25.621
I'm Jerry Seinfeld and I am a bad actor but I've proven if you surround yourself

1202
01:05:26.351 --> 01:05:29.410
with enough talent,
youtube and,
but Davita did it,
whatever.

1203
01:05:30.580 --> 01:05:33.250
So I went out and tried to find the funniest fucking people I could.

1204
01:05:33.251 --> 01:05:35.920
So hopefully if I suck,

1205
01:05:36.490 --> 01:05:40.750
the people around me are okay.
So that was my Monday,
Tuesday,

1206
01:05:40.750 --> 01:05:45.010
Wednesday we wrapped at about 9:00 PM Thursday,

1207
01:05:45.850 --> 01:05:48.220
smoked a fucking stokey as men do.

1208
01:05:49.210 --> 01:05:54.210
And then I got my little Prius reeking of Dutch masters and a went home and the

1209
01:05:56.980 --> 01:05:59.530
next day I bought it a fucking Air Canada flight to Calgary

1210
01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:04.810
and proceeded Friday,
Saturday,
Sunday I went to a Calgary flame game,

1211
01:06:05.380 --> 01:06:08.950
then an Edmonton Euler game and then a Vancouver Canuck game.

1212
01:06:09.010 --> 01:06:12.060
I always wanted to go up there and uh,
I got to tell you,

1213
01:06:12.061 --> 01:06:14.710
it was pretty fucking amazing and pretty God damn cold.

1214
01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:18.670
Do you remember that shit when you were a kid?
Wherever the hell you live.
Like,

1215
01:06:18.671 --> 01:06:19.331
I might not,

1216
01:06:19.331 --> 01:06:23.950
my nose has not stuck together when inhaling since I went collecting on my paper

1217
01:06:23.951 --> 01:06:27.670
route and like the fifth grade,
um,

1218
01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:31.150
Calgary,
I don't know what the fuck is in Calgary.
Okay,

1219
01:06:31.151 --> 01:06:35.110
let me do my little review of the western part of Canada.
All right.

1220
01:06:35.111 --> 01:06:39.670
Calgary first stop.
Um,
I dunno,

1221
01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:42.970
I can't tell.
I don't know what the fuck the deal was.
I didn't see a skyline.

1222
01:06:43.030 --> 01:06:45.790
It was snowing like I haven't seen it snow in years.

1223
01:06:46.180 --> 01:06:47.980
And then I got on a little fucking trolley,

1224
01:06:47.981 --> 01:06:51.640
which was really confusing and I went the long way,
like seven times.

1225
01:06:51.641 --> 01:06:56.641
But the Saddledome was the shit and I sat next to some guy from Canada who said

1226
01:06:58.331 --> 01:07:01.930
a after everything,
you know,
like that strange brew Shit.

1227
01:07:01.990 --> 01:07:06.700
Like oh they got to get it out a a means everything up there.

1228
01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:10.960
It means,
you know,
it means like,
you know what I'm saying?
It means,

1229
01:07:10.990 --> 01:07:15.790
what did you say?
It means how,
I guess that also means what he's,

1230
01:07:15.791 --> 01:07:16.930
I don't know,
it's like seven different,

1231
01:07:17.020 --> 01:07:20.890
it's like Donnie Brasco when he fucking explained a forget about it.

1232
01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:25.480
That's what a is in fucking Alberta.
You've got to get it out.
Hey,

1233
01:07:25.481 --> 01:07:28.000
and they all sounded like they almost sound like the fucking Irish.

1234
01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:30.550
I don't know what I'm talking about.
But the game was great.

1235
01:07:31.060 --> 01:07:35.650
There was a shootout at the end of the game,
a and a panthers one that one,

1236
01:07:35.651 --> 01:07:36.400
and then I,

1237
01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:41.400
the next fucking day I drove up to Edmonton through towns like the towns out

1238
01:07:41.891 --> 01:07:46.270
there and I was looking at the weather map.
It was like a,
you know,

1239
01:07:46.271 --> 01:07:49.060
fucking red deer,
yellow knife,

1240
01:07:50.590 --> 01:07:55.060
you know those Indian names,
the classic White Guy Thing,
you know,

1241
01:07:55.090 --> 01:07:57.040
you murder a bunch of people,

1242
01:07:57.041 --> 01:08:01.000
you commit genocide and then you name towns after him,
you know,

1243
01:08:01.420 --> 01:08:04.630
did we destroy the,
want the fucking punk upon people.

1244
01:08:04.870 --> 01:08:08.050
Let's name a street after him,
maybe even a golf course.

1245
01:08:08.110 --> 01:08:10.090
I think that that's only the right thing to do,

1246
01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:12.610
considering none of them exist anymore.

1247
01:08:12.610 --> 01:08:17.610
Let's do something here to remember these people after we've massacred them and

1248
01:08:18.021 --> 01:08:20.780
put small pockets on their phone,
in their sleeping bags.

1249
01:08:21.410 --> 01:08:24.140
Did any of have sleeping bags?
I don't think they did.

1250
01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:25.920
What did they use for sleeping bags?

1251
01:08:26.030 --> 01:08:30.470
Did they sleep in the fucking end trails of an animal like Luke Skywalker?

1252
01:08:31.350 --> 01:08:35.420
This podcast went off the rails about fucking two minutes ago cause I got in my

1253
01:08:35.421 --> 01:08:38.840
head going,
did I just calm myself down like five minutes ago?

1254
01:08:38.841 --> 01:08:40.520
And then all of a sudden I stopped being funny.

1255
01:08:40.970 --> 01:08:43.910
I mean his podcast started off great.
I Sang Christmas carols,

1256
01:08:44.300 --> 01:08:48.350
you know what I mean?
I defended saying Merry Christmas,
you know,

1257
01:08:48.380 --> 01:08:50.750
and then all of a sudden I was like,
wait a minute,
I'm coming off angry,

1258
01:08:51.050 --> 01:08:52.490
let's take it down a little bit.

1259
01:08:52.700 --> 01:08:56.990
And then all of a sudden I felt like I was doing the traffic.
You know,

1260
01:08:58.310 --> 01:09:02.120
I like to traffic down the south when you listen to it.
Cause they,
they,

1261
01:09:02.330 --> 01:09:05.540
they still say,
uh,
when there's an accident they call it a wreck.

1262
01:09:05.900 --> 01:09:07.840
And that always makes me feel like I'm watching NASCAR.

1263
01:09:08.870 --> 01:09:12.740
We've got a lick down there all,
no,
not a farm.
They don't talk like that.

1264
01:09:12.741 --> 01:09:15.680
But that's all I hear at that point when someone says,
Libby got a wreck,

1265
01:09:16.420 --> 01:09:19.640
there's a car all Tory up on the side of the fucking road.

1266
01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:22.730
Um,
and anyways,
then when I drove up,

1267
01:09:22.731 --> 01:09:27.320
yeah I was going to stop off in red deer to get something eat to eat just on my

1268
01:09:27.321 --> 01:09:32.030
way up to Edmonton just to say I fucking did it.
And then I was like,

1269
01:09:32.031 --> 01:09:34.880
you know what,
red deer sounds like it reminds me of one of those,

1270
01:09:35.330 --> 01:09:40.330
those A&amp;E murder mystery that I watched where these two hunters had gone up to

1271
01:09:40.761 --> 01:09:44.120
some fucking place to go hunting.
They stopped off in a bar,

1272
01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:46.010
they exchanged words with people,

1273
01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:50.300
they got killed and then somebody in the bar fed their bodies to pigs.

1274
01:09:51.140 --> 01:09:55.460
And it was one of the most creepiest fucking stories I've ever seen.
You know,

1275
01:09:55.490 --> 01:10:00.290
just that whole fucking feeding them person to pigs and they all look like they

1276
01:10:00.291 --> 01:10:03.830
were in like Creedence Clearwater revival.
So it was really fucking with my head.

1277
01:10:04.460 --> 01:10:08.420
And um,
I don't know,
red deer just sounded like that kind of shit can happen.

1278
01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:12.290
So I bypassed it and I continued on up to Edmonton.

1279
01:10:13.490 --> 01:10:16.520
I'm going to tell this story in real time.
Let's fly forward.
Okay?

1280
01:10:16.521 --> 01:10:17.354
I had a great time.

1281
01:10:18.050 --> 01:10:20.600
Edmonson was an awesome game coming up there and seeing all the championship

1282
01:10:20.601 --> 01:10:25.601
banners in the fucking retired jerseys at Gretzky and Messiaen and all you gotta

1283
01:10:25.830 --> 01:10:26.990
do it.
Okay.

1284
01:10:27.260 --> 01:10:32.260
Not to mention both the Saddledome and Northlands coliseum are just basically a,

1285
01:10:35.780 --> 01:10:37.640
I don't know,
they're like no frills.

1286
01:10:37.670 --> 01:10:41.720
They made an ice rink and they put seats around it and that's it.

1287
01:10:42.410 --> 01:10:45.650
There's no,
uh,
none of that shit.
You know what I mean?
Although,
you know what,

1288
01:10:45.651 --> 01:10:50.651
Calgary definitely had the horse skating around on the ice in between and I'm,

1289
01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:55.580
Oh God,
what am I get to questions?
I just bored the shit out of myself.

1290
01:10:55.581 --> 01:10:58.040
But there was such a fucking good time.
I had an awesome time up there.

1291
01:10:58.041 --> 01:10:59.630
You know what it is?
I just,

1292
01:10:59.690 --> 01:11:03.110
I woke up at fucking eight in the morning and I just got on a plane and I had to

1293
01:11:03.111 --> 01:11:06.950
come back and do the podcast.
So I'm skipping over a bunch of good details.

1294
01:11:07.610 --> 01:11:08.840
You know?
What did I see up there?

1295
01:11:08.841 --> 01:11:12.380
I saw some guy in like minus 90 million degrees Celsius,

1296
01:11:12.381 --> 01:11:13.380
whatever the fuck that is.

1297
01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:18.440
I think that's like five degrees American and he was fixing a four wheeler with

1298
01:11:18.871 --> 01:11:23.040
no hat on
and no gloves.
You standing out there.

1299
01:11:23.070 --> 01:11:26.280
Do you remember Arthur funds a rally used to dress when they gave him a garage,

1300
01:11:26.910 --> 01:11:28.890
when they ran out of shit to do with this character.

1301
01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:30.360
It was before he became a teacher.

1302
01:11:30.540 --> 01:11:34.500
But after him just hanging out at Arnold's when they were finally like,
okay,

1303
01:11:34.501 --> 01:11:37.890
this guy's like 30 he needs a job.
You know what I mean?

1304
01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:39.810
How does he afford to live in that attic?

1305
01:11:40.770 --> 01:11:45.300
He was dressed like that and it was fucking cold out and he was fixing a four

1306
01:11:45.301 --> 01:11:46.470
wheeler and I was,
it was,

1307
01:11:46.471 --> 01:11:50.040
I actually videotaped it and if I knew how to upload it,
I put it on there.

1308
01:11:50.700 --> 01:11:53.130
But anyways,
this is my podcast and we get to the questions here.

1309
01:11:53.550 --> 01:11:55.410
People send me questions all this week.

1310
01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:59.010
I think I shot my load with that fucking song right up the front,
you know?

1311
01:11:59.100 --> 01:12:00.660
And if I sucked the rest of the way out.

1312
01:12:00.690 --> 01:12:04.620
You gotta admit three minutes of Christmas.
Carolyn,
isn't that,

1313
01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:07.140
am I defending my podcast?
I mean,
this is ridiculous.

1314
01:12:07.141 --> 01:12:11.250
Second bombing is a comedian.
Go.
Come on,
man.
No,
no.
It was a funny joke.
Well,

1315
01:12:11.330 --> 01:12:15.480
it was funny.
You know,
I mean a,
Hey,
this guy,
you know,

1316
01:12:15.481 --> 01:12:19.160
and they set up,
I didn't have any extra words.
I disguise the punchline.

1317
01:12:19.161 --> 01:12:20.520
I took a left at the last second.

1318
01:12:21.130 --> 01:12:24.000
Can't help if you guys don't want to go along for the ride.
All right,

1319
01:12:24.001 --> 01:12:26.640
question number one.
Um,
Bill,
since you're,

1320
01:12:27.090 --> 01:12:30.060
you're a struggling actor trying to make it,

1321
01:12:30.061 --> 01:12:34.800
have you ever thought about doing gay porn?
You know,

1322
01:12:34.801 --> 01:12:37.020
you guys have really been assholes lately,
but you know what?

1323
01:12:37.080 --> 01:12:39.840
I'm going to go fucking be a man about it.
Hillary.
Kay.
Let's go.

1324
01:12:39.841 --> 01:12:42.150
Since you're a struggling actor trying to make it,

1325
01:12:42.151 --> 01:12:44.700
have you ever thought about doing gay porn to make ends meet?

1326
01:12:45.210 --> 01:12:48.780
You already have the iconic shaved head and like hockey.

1327
01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:53.520
Do you have a shaved head and you like hockey?
You Gay?
Okay.
Speaking of hockey,

1328
01:12:53.521 --> 01:12:55.290
Sean Avery is underrated.

1329
01:12:55.530 --> 01:12:58.710
Anyone who calls a woman a con and then tells her that he wouldn't even,

1330
01:13:00.390 --> 01:13:02.010
I can't read your fucking typing.

1331
01:13:02.070 --> 01:13:06.300
He wouldn't come in her face because she's too old.
Is Cool with me.

1332
01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:10.090
All right,
let's get back to your first question.
As a struggling,

1333
01:13:10.140 --> 01:13:14.850
you have ever thought about doing gay porn?
Obviously?
No.
Um,

1334
01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:18.300
what is the worst thing I have considered doing?

1335
01:13:18.301 --> 01:13:21.600
I consider doing commercials back when commercials weren't funny.

1336
01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:25.680
Remember back in the day,
like 10,
12 years,
10,
12 years ago,

1337
01:13:25.681 --> 01:13:30.540
they started to get funny,
but it was that awkward middle ground where,
you know,

1338
01:13:30.541 --> 01:13:35.541
you could be in a really funny commercial or you could just be like a budding

1339
01:13:36.181 --> 01:13:40.110
into a sandwich.
And then given that look to the camera,
like boil boy,

1340
01:13:40.111 --> 01:13:42.390
was that tasty.
You know,

1341
01:13:45.030 --> 01:13:46.370
I remember back in the day,
like I,

1342
01:13:46.371 --> 01:13:51.060
I refuse to do a commercial because I listened to that Bill Hicks rant about

1343
01:13:51.061 --> 01:13:53.400
that.
And then,
then after a while I was like,

1344
01:13:53.670 --> 01:13:57.930
why am I making a difficult business even harder?
You know,

1345
01:13:58.860 --> 01:14:01.200
granted,
I don't go out for commercial auditions,

1346
01:14:01.201 --> 01:14:03.210
but it's not because I'm against doing commercials.

1347
01:14:03.211 --> 01:14:05.850
I just don't do commercial additions because I'm lazy.

1348
01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:09.420
Plus they're all the way out in Santa Monica and I'm not driving all the way

1349
01:14:09.421 --> 01:14:11.950
over there to fucking act like I'm eating a bowl of fruit loops.

1350
01:14:12.010 --> 01:14:15.820
I'm not doing that,
you know?
I do have a little pride.
All right,

1351
01:14:15.821 --> 01:14:19.510
question number two,
Bill.
Hey,
I'm a big fan of the podcast.

1352
01:14:19.511 --> 01:14:21.940
I listened to most of them traveling over the Thanksgiving break.

1353
01:14:21.941 --> 01:14:26.320
I did notice that you have a few favorite words and since I lead a sad but etic

1354
01:14:26.321 --> 01:14:30.460
life,
I thought it would be funny to count them during last week's podcast.

1355
01:14:30.461 --> 01:14:31.570
So here we go.
Okay.

1356
01:14:31.571 --> 01:14:36.020
Evidently this is the list of my favorite words and how many times I say them a

1357
01:14:36.070 --> 01:14:40.510
cunt.
Three times.
Wow.
That's pretty low.
We are in a recession.

1358
01:14:41.410 --> 01:14:46.270
Um,
I don't know.
I said 27 times shit.
I said 42 times.

1359
01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:49.870
Fuck,
I said 127 times.

1360
01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:55.960
Wow.
How many?
27 times.
Let's do the math there.
That's about three times a minute.

1361
01:14:56.560 --> 01:15:00.400
Four times a minute.
Do what?
A half hour podcast.
Wow.

1362
01:15:00.610 --> 01:15:03.640
I'm the Wayne Gretzky of the f word.
All right.
Choke out a pheasant.

1363
01:15:04.060 --> 01:15:08.590
I say one time.
I said one time.
Okay.
You're Popeye Popeye.

1364
01:15:08.591 --> 01:15:13.570
Like bump up,
chuckle to yourself nine times.
Okay.

1365
01:15:14.100 --> 01:15:15.610
I don't know if that was interesting to anybody.

1366
01:15:15.700 --> 01:15:20.660
That was kind of interesting to me that somebody that fucking lonely.
Um,

1367
01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:25.370
all right.
Underrated.
Overrated.
Overrated.
Brendan Frasier.
Oh,

1368
01:15:25.390 --> 01:15:29.260
underrate a Brendan Frazier.
Eric Lindros.
When he first came into the league,

1369
01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:31.540
completely bald,

1370
01:15:31.541 --> 01:15:36.190
Vagina and college are overrated.
I would go with you.

1371
01:15:36.191 --> 01:15:39.400
They had the ball.
Vagina is just fucking creepy.

1372
01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:45.610
It's really fucking creepy.
Um,
yeah.
Not a fan.

1373
01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:50.150
Not a fan.
No.
I don't want to go down to a thatched hut either.
Scene.

1374
01:15:50.190 --> 01:15:53.660
I don't do this shit.
I'm like,
I'm not taking it in this direction,
goddammit.
Um,

1375
01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:58.090
all right.
Three bill.
If you could have one superpower,
what would it be?

1376
01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:03.160
Also,
how would you use it?
Um,
would you fight crime?

1377
01:16:03.190 --> 01:16:06.500
Would you commit crimes or would you just use it to beat the shit out of people

1378
01:16:06.501 --> 01:16:11.440
who heckled you?
Um,
you know,
when I would do,
I would use it to,

1379
01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:15.990
uh,
freak people out who had power.
You know,
like,
if I was like,
I mean,

1380
01:16:15.991 --> 01:16:17.980
I can't just have one super power.
I gotta have a couple.

1381
01:16:17.981 --> 01:16:20.950
Like if I put it this way up,
I was like,
Superman.
I could fly.
I could,

1382
01:16:20.980 --> 01:16:25.540
I could see through,
you know,
walls and I was bulletproof.

1383
01:16:25.870 --> 01:16:28.960
I would,
I would,
yeah,
I would fuck with people who had power.

1384
01:16:29.950 --> 01:16:33.220
I'd fly into the Oval Office,
you know,

1385
01:16:33.250 --> 01:16:35.160
right in the middle of them talking about shit.
You know,

1386
01:16:35.310 --> 01:16:38.610
I'd just be standing outside the window,
you know,

1387
01:16:38.620 --> 01:16:41.980
just staring at him like Michael Myers and like Halloween,
I would just do that.

1388
01:16:42.010 --> 01:16:46.630
I would just freak people the fuck out.
Um,
I wouldn't use it to fight crime.

1389
01:16:47.350 --> 01:16:51.850
I would use it to get to my gigs a little quicker rather than flying southwest.

1390
01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:55.180
And I would just wear my superhero outfit the whole week,
you know,

1391
01:16:55.181 --> 01:16:57.460
like Steve Martin,
you know,
he always wore that white suit.

1392
01:16:57.760 --> 01:17:02.200
I would just wear whatever my superhero fucking suit was,

1393
01:17:02.290 --> 01:17:06.550
and I just slide at my gigs.
And then I'd fly home,
no security,

1394
01:17:06.790 --> 01:17:08.260
no fucking bags.

1395
01:17:08.680 --> 01:17:12.950
I'd have a little toothbrush in my utility belt board.
I do with my,

1396
01:17:12.980 --> 01:17:16.780
I dunno what I would do with it.
I would fuck with corporations and,

1397
01:17:16.781 --> 01:17:19.550
and leaders of the world.
Um,

1398
01:17:19.580 --> 01:17:24.580
and all my information would be shit that I read on Youtube and Wikipedia and

1399
01:17:24.890 --> 01:17:29.390
uh,
yeah,
that's what I would do.
Um,
wow.
Just no fucking energy this week.

1400
01:17:29.450 --> 01:17:30.283
What is wrong with me?

1401
01:17:30.300 --> 01:17:34.190
I was so excited about this podcast and I just really feel like this is a bill

1402
01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:38.570
borough woefully miscast and the Monday morning podcast.
I'm number six.
Bill,

1403
01:17:38.571 --> 01:17:43.190
I was wondering if there are any situations that you steer away from when you

1404
01:17:43.191 --> 01:17:44.150
work?
Audiences.

1405
01:17:44.510 --> 01:17:48.080
I'm not talking about something as profound as a racial observation,

1406
01:17:48.410 --> 01:17:53.060
but any social subjects that crowds really don't respond to or is everything up

1407
01:17:53.061 --> 01:17:57.740
for grabs as,
okay.
These,
these are two things.
I don't really do sex,
sex material.

1408
01:17:58.580 --> 01:18:02.990
I just feel like the crowd absolutely loses their mind if you talk about sex,

1409
01:18:02.991 --> 01:18:05.070
no matter what you're saying.
And I gotta admit,

1410
01:18:05.090 --> 01:18:08.630
I always feel a little crude when I'm talking about it.
You know,

1411
01:18:08.631 --> 01:18:11.390
even that's why he kind of broke off the whole ball.
The Vagina think it's just,

1412
01:18:12.370 --> 01:18:14.670
there's no class,
you know?
I don't know.

1413
01:18:14.770 --> 01:18:19.730
It's just crude unless you have a really unique fucking story to tell.
You know,

1414
01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:20.990
I'm not like a prude or anything,

1415
01:18:20.991 --> 01:18:24.020
but a lot of times like when I go to see movies and you know,

1416
01:18:24.260 --> 01:18:27.470
two actors I are having a love scene and then some guy sucking on the girls

1417
01:18:27.471 --> 01:18:31.550
titties,
it's ridiculous to me.
I always look at the first like that,

1418
01:18:31.580 --> 01:18:35.660
that's not even necessary to moving the story along.

1419
01:18:36.500 --> 01:18:36.890
You know,

1420
01:18:36.890 --> 01:18:40.070
back in the day they would just show the cup of gold in the room and they would

1421
01:18:40.071 --> 01:18:44.070
close the door and then they would just play that saxophone because the Saks

1422
01:18:45.140 --> 01:18:48.700
always back in the day,
always meant someone was going to some book.

1423
01:18:48.710 --> 01:18:51.290
People were fucking,
that's what the saxophone meant.

1424
01:18:51.291 --> 01:18:54.710
It either meant that or someone was going to do a strip striptease and you had

1425
01:18:54.711 --> 01:18:58.730
to play with that really fucking wow fucking sound.

1426
01:18:58.731 --> 01:19:01.910
And everybody knew that somebody was getting some Dick.
Right.

1427
01:19:02.300 --> 01:19:05.210
But you didn't have to show it.
You know,

1428
01:19:05.420 --> 01:19:07.400
that was my whole thing with like Brokeback mountain.

1429
01:19:07.430 --> 01:19:10.010
I don't love my watching a movie about a couple of gay cowboys,

1430
01:19:10.250 --> 01:19:13.550
but I don't want to watch a couple of dudes fucking at 10 you know,

1431
01:19:15.060 --> 01:19:16.790
I don't understand that.
And then like what?

1432
01:19:16.791 --> 01:19:21.050
That makes me a more comfortable with my sexuality,
cause I look at that,

1433
01:19:21.230 --> 01:19:24.980
I gotta admit half the time there's two things that really grossed me out in

1434
01:19:24.981 --> 01:19:27.890
movies.
It's like over the top.

1435
01:19:27.891 --> 01:19:31.880
Kissing is fucking gross to me and act.

1436
01:19:32.060 --> 01:19:36.130
People who eat during scenes,
I don't know if you've,
I've probably talked about,

1437
01:19:36.140 --> 01:19:38.150
this is my number one pet peeve in a movie.

1438
01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:43.220
Like I've gone out to lunch with people and they're eating and they talk and

1439
01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:47.090
they,
they take their moments when to do it.
Something about actors,

1440
01:19:47.091 --> 01:19:51.320
the second they're in a movie and they start eating,
they start over acting,

1441
01:19:51.350 --> 01:19:54.980
eating.
You only start fucking pointing with bread.
Yeah.

1442
01:19:56.080 --> 01:19:59.450
Y'All gonna fucking dude one,
they got shit hanging out of their mouth.
It's like,

1443
01:19:59.451 --> 01:20:03.650
dude,
why don't you finish what you're eating,
collect your fucking thoughts,

1444
01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:06.650
swallow,
and then present your line.
Okay.
I don't need you.

1445
01:20:06.740 --> 01:20:11.130
You fucking sorry.
I don't even,
what the fuck I'm talking about now?

1446
01:20:11.340 --> 01:20:14.700
There's two subject.
Okay.
So sex and um,

1447
01:20:15.990 --> 01:20:19.830
I don't make fun of a,
the mentally handicapped.
I just don't,

1448
01:20:20.370 --> 01:20:21.750
it just crosses the line.

1449
01:20:21.780 --> 01:20:25.200
I've done it before in the opion Anthony Show I've piled on,

1450
01:20:25.470 --> 01:20:29.550
I've definitely said some shit on stage if it just pops into my head.

1451
01:20:29.551 --> 01:20:33.870
But generally speaking,
I don't write bits.
I just don't,
you know,

1452
01:20:33.900 --> 01:20:37.860
half of it cause I think,
you know,
that's just brutal to me.
And then secondly,

1453
01:20:38.100 --> 01:20:41.160
I haven't had any kids yet and I really feel like I'm jinxing myself.

1454
01:20:41.940 --> 01:20:46.320
A long time ago I did do comic view and I did do a bit about movies,

1455
01:20:47.370 --> 01:20:51.900
about the mentally handicapped.
I don't know if you can find that on youtube.

1456
01:20:52.800 --> 01:20:53.790
And uh,

1457
01:20:53.820 --> 01:20:57.270
my parents saw it and they weren't happy and I'm still looking for approval.

1458
01:20:57.300 --> 01:21:02.000
So I took that to,
I don't know.

1459
01:21:02.040 --> 01:21:04.710
There's too many details.
I,
yeah,
those are the two subjects.
I really don't,

1460
01:21:05.220 --> 01:21:06.300
I don't do shit like that.

1461
01:21:06.870 --> 01:21:11.520
And I also try not to do a stuff that will reinforce more ironic thought,

1462
01:21:12.690 --> 01:21:16.740
you know,
as far as like,
uh,
racial shit.
I try not to do that,

1463
01:21:16.830 --> 01:21:18.360
but everything else,
yeah,

1464
01:21:18.361 --> 01:21:22.890
I don't care other than I really enjoy pissing people off in the crowd,
you know?

1465
01:21:24.420 --> 01:21:28.650
Um,
like whatever,
whatever group I was divided,
beg if that Merry Christmas group,

1466
01:21:29.340 --> 01:21:32.850
you know,
the people who find that offensive where at my show,
like,
you know,

1467
01:21:33.420 --> 01:21:38.420
it would just basically be your duty as a comedian to just make their night as

1468
01:21:38.881 --> 01:21:43.260
miserable as fucking possible.
So I'm definitely an asshole.
But yeah,

1469
01:21:43.261 --> 01:21:47.820
those are the sex,
sex in the retarded,
right.
There you go.
Those are,

1470
01:21:47.821 --> 01:21:52.650
those are the lines.
All right,
number eight,
bill,
do you fish?
Uh,
no I don't.

1471
01:21:52.651 --> 01:21:57.590
Occasionally I have,
I've gone fishing,
but now I don't own a rod or a real,
um,

1472
01:21:57.600 --> 01:22:01.290
my favorite part of it is going on,
on the boat and hoping to see,

1473
01:22:01.580 --> 01:22:06.390
I like looking at wildlife.
I don't like,
uh,
killing it,
you know,

1474
01:22:07.470 --> 01:22:10.560
even if the fish,
it just fucking bothers me.
Like,
you know,

1475
01:22:10.590 --> 01:22:13.200
there's already dead fish in the supermarket.
Why don't you just eat that?

1476
01:22:13.980 --> 01:22:16.680
But then I read all the survival stuff,
like I should know how to do this.

1477
01:22:16.681 --> 01:22:21.000
But then you go up deep sea fishing and they fucking do everything for you.

1478
01:22:22.020 --> 01:22:26.460
You just sit down.
They're like annual rotten real sir.
They just hand it to you.

1479
01:22:26.461 --> 01:22:30.870
They tell you what to do.
They know where to go,
where the fish are.
And it's like,

1480
01:22:30.871 --> 01:22:32.400
you know,
you feel like,
I feel like,
you know,

1481
01:22:32.401 --> 01:22:36.480
when you're like five years old and your dad lets you sit in his lap and steer

1482
01:22:36.481 --> 01:22:39.720
the fucking car and you're like,
Hey,
I'm driving the car.
No,
you're not.
No,

1483
01:22:39.721 --> 01:22:44.130
you're not.
You're fucking child.
Um,
and I also really enjoy the drinking.

1484
01:22:44.940 --> 01:22:46.650
Uh,
that's the part of the fishing that I like,

1485
01:22:46.680 --> 01:22:51.360
even though boos and boats don't miss mix according to the posters.
All right,

1486
01:22:51.361 --> 01:22:55.410
Bill,
who do you think are the top three electrical garter guitarists that are

1487
01:22:55.411 --> 01:23:00.300
currently performing?
I have no fucking idea.
I'm 40 years old.
I should know that.

1488
01:23:01.120 --> 01:23:04.110
All right.
My favorites of all time.
Or Stevie Ray Vaughan.

1489
01:23:04.350 --> 01:23:06.850
And recently I really got back into Jimmy page.

1490
01:23:07.540 --> 01:23:11.980
I really got back into his shit and um,
I don't know who the third one is.

1491
01:23:11.981 --> 01:23:14.560
Take your pick,
but it's definitely,
I don't like the Steve Vai,

1492
01:23:14.561 --> 01:23:18.580
Joe Satriani kind of guys,
those guys who can play really fast,

1493
01:23:18.581 --> 01:23:22.390
but it sounds like they're playing on a Casio keyboard.
Um,

1494
01:23:22.510 --> 01:23:27.160
I'm not into really fast guys.
Um,
I'm into those guys.
You know,
those,

1495
01:23:27.190 --> 01:23:31.090
you know those guys,
guys that give you chills.
Speaking of which,

1496
01:23:31.091 --> 01:23:32.560
the best part of,
that's what I wanted to,

1497
01:23:32.561 --> 01:23:36.610
the best part of the fucking hockey trip that I took was when I went to

1498
01:23:36.611 --> 01:23:41.611
Vancouver and they sang Oh Canada and the guy comes out and he sings the first

1499
01:23:41.681 --> 01:23:46.681
verse or whatever and then he stops and then he just sort of conducts the crowd

1500
01:23:46.781 --> 01:23:48.100
as they sang the second half.

1501
01:23:48.130 --> 01:23:51.910
I got literally goosebumps listening to the people up in Vancouver singing o

1502
01:23:51.911 --> 01:23:54.760
Canada cause I never heard it sung like that.
You know,

1503
01:23:55.360 --> 01:23:58.930
people in America at the hockey games sing o Canada,

1504
01:23:59.230 --> 01:24:04.230
the way they sing the fucking national American national anthem in Canada.

1505
01:24:05.140 --> 01:24:08.380
There's no passion.
You don't give a fuck.
You know,

1506
01:24:08.470 --> 01:24:10.710
you should have heard them sing.
And they were like,
uh,

1507
01:24:10.750 --> 01:24:15.370
say can you hello blah blah.

1508
01:24:15.940 --> 01:24:18.670
And then they get to this song and they just like,
oh

1509
01:24:20.510 --> 01:24:22.880
they fucking,
you know,
milk and every note they're into it.

1510
01:24:25.890 --> 01:24:29.530
[inaudible]
all right,
enough thing here.
All right,
bill number nine.

1511
01:24:29.560 --> 01:24:32.020
At Caroline's Caroline's show,

1512
01:24:32.021 --> 01:24:35.590
you mentioned that your grandmother is 101 years old at her age.

1513
01:24:35.591 --> 01:24:39.430
Does she still have any messed up out of date reasonings?

1514
01:24:39.431 --> 01:24:42.970
My grandfather is 86.
He's typical old Italian man,

1515
01:24:43.840 --> 01:24:44.890
sharp for his age,

1516
01:24:44.891 --> 01:24:49.390
but recently in an interracial couple moved next door to him and we had to stop

1517
01:24:49.391 --> 01:24:52.630
him from going to city hall because he wanted to have his property taxes lower

1518
01:24:52.631 --> 01:24:56.860
due to the fact as he put it,
a colored woman is living next door.

1519
01:24:57.890 --> 01:24:59.560
[inaudible] swear to God.
That's true.
No bullshit.

1520
01:24:59.561 --> 01:25:02.110
What do you think fucked up fucking classic are a little both.

1521
01:25:04.910 --> 01:25:07.840
Um,
that's a hard one.
Obviously,
if somebody you know,

1522
01:25:07.841 --> 01:25:11.110
below the age of 60 thinks something like that,
yeah,
that's fucked up.

1523
01:25:11.890 --> 01:25:16.090
But um,
I mean the guy's fucking,
let's,
let's do the math here.

1524
01:25:16.091 --> 01:25:20.350
He's 86 years old.
All right,
let's smell,
how do we do this?

1525
01:25:20.351 --> 01:25:25.351
Here is six plus four is 94 years from now is 2012 so he was born in 1922.

1526
01:25:28.990 --> 01:25:33.880
All right.
The guy's born in 19 fucking 22.
Um,

1527
01:25:34.610 --> 01:25:37.090
all right.
He's 18 in 1940.

1528
01:25:38.050 --> 01:25:41.410
They didn't even let black people in the fucking army when they did,

1529
01:25:41.411 --> 01:25:43.850
they put them in a special unit.

1530
01:25:46.100 --> 01:25:49.120
It's like fucking 15 years before

1531
01:25:52.300 --> 01:25:56.500
when the fuck was civil rights.
No,
it was like 25 fucking years after that.
23.

1532
01:25:56.920 --> 01:26:00.730
Yeah.
No,
I mean that's got,
yeah,
that's his wheelhouse.
You know what I mean?

1533
01:26:00.850 --> 01:26:05.570
The same way.
I don't know,
like what Best Guitar Star that are playing today.

1534
01:26:05.780 --> 01:26:09.470
Cause now I'm 40.
I'm off like you,
you just,
you're,
you're,
you're awake.

1535
01:26:09.500 --> 01:26:10.910
You shoved off to see,

1536
01:26:11.420 --> 01:26:15.740
I got my fucking 10 albums in my head that I'm going to listen to for the rest

1537
01:26:15.741 --> 01:26:20.660
of my life.
The same way old people still listen to in the mood that it a debt,

1538
01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:24.050
debt,
debt.
They fucking love that song.
I hate that song drives me nuts.

1539
01:26:24.330 --> 01:26:26.540
It makes me want to kill somebody.
But when I'm 80,

1540
01:26:26.541 --> 01:26:31.541
I'll still be listening to back in black and I think you take how you think

1541
01:26:31.911 --> 01:26:35.120
along with you.
So,
um,
I dunno.

1542
01:26:36.050 --> 01:26:39.530
And at that point he's 86 is he really gonna start a hate group.

1543
01:26:40.610 --> 01:26:42.800
You know,
it's kind of funny.

1544
01:26:44.060 --> 01:26:48.890
Racism becomes funny only when you're so fucking old that you couldn't do

1545
01:26:48.891 --> 01:26:50.240
anything about it,
you know?

1546
01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:53.870
Then you just become this crazy old guy who's just saying a bunch of shit.

1547
01:26:54.230 --> 01:26:57.740
So I guess,
yeah,
it is.
That is funny.
That is funny.
But you know,
it's weird.

1548
01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.560
This is getting back to that with that kid was asking me about what you talk

1549
01:27:00.561 --> 01:27:01.251
about right now.

1550
01:27:01.251 --> 01:27:05.660
I feel like I have a social responsibility because I'm talking to 14 people over

1551
01:27:05.661 --> 01:27:08.990
the goddamn phone to now say that that's fucked up.
Okay.
You know what,

1552
01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:13.250
in public on television,
if the guy did that,
that's definitely fucked up.

1553
01:27:13.430 --> 01:27:16.610
But sitting in your living room and your grandparents said something fucking

1554
01:27:16.611 --> 01:27:19.190
racist.
It's hilarious.
You know,

1555
01:27:19.220 --> 01:27:22.790
not cause you can don't it just because they're so uncensored and they don't

1556
01:27:22.791 --> 01:27:26.780
give a fuck.
And uh,
yeah,
I probably would've laughed.
I would've left.

1557
01:27:27.680 --> 01:27:31.940
I'm not saying I'm condoning it on any level.
All right,
question number 10,
uh,

1558
01:27:32.120 --> 01:27:35.310
know what's really,
really overrated.
Oh,
over eight and under eight.
Um,

1559
01:27:36.590 --> 01:27:40.430
this assumption that all gay men are funny.
You know what,

1560
01:27:40.431 --> 01:27:43.610
that's just hilarious right there because you really do picture them like that.

1561
01:27:43.700 --> 01:27:45.620
I've actually said that.
Defense it gay people,

1562
01:27:45.621 --> 01:27:48.890
like I don't understand why people have such a problem with them.
You know,

1563
01:27:49.010 --> 01:27:51.470
they fucking hilarious and exactly.
You know,

1564
01:27:51.471 --> 01:27:54.290
I don't want to watch two of them fucking a tent,
you know,
I have my,

1565
01:27:54.650 --> 01:27:57.230
but this guy says basically I work in a restaurant,
we have our share,

1566
01:27:57.231 --> 01:28:00.020
a gay guys that have a great sense of humor,

1567
01:28:00.050 --> 01:28:04.520
but just because you're gay doesn't mean describing what you'd let Clive Owen do

1568
01:28:04.521 --> 01:28:08.690
to you in great detail is funny.
Yeah,
that's Kinda nasty.

1569
01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:11.690
I've known a couple of gay guys who get a little over the top with the fucking

1570
01:28:11.691 --> 01:28:15.050
description of this sexual shit that they want to do.
You know,

1571
01:28:16.770 --> 01:28:20.060
it does get creepy,
you know,
but you know what it is.

1572
01:28:20.061 --> 01:28:25.061
That's Karma for straight guys because how that makes you feel as a straight

1573
01:28:25.221 --> 01:28:28.010
guy.
That's how women feel when you,
when you know,

1574
01:28:28.011 --> 01:28:29.510
some girl walks by and you're like,
yeah,

1575
01:28:29.511 --> 01:28:31.730
I'd love to fucking been here a little or you know,
whatever.

1576
01:28:31.731 --> 01:28:36.320
Fucking Evil Shit you say.
So.
Um,
yeah.

1577
01:28:37.550 --> 01:28:40.340
Wow.
That's a lot of awful images in my head.
All right,
let's get to the next one.

1578
01:28:40.341 --> 01:28:42.290
Overrated cable TV,

1579
01:28:43.370 --> 01:28:47.060
especially the movie channels because they just rerun all the same suck ass

1580
01:28:47.061 --> 01:28:50.510
movies like kindergarten,
kindergarten,
cop are under siege.

1581
01:28:51.500 --> 01:28:55.610
They still run van Damme movies and the worst are the cheesy pornos.

1582
01:28:57.770 --> 01:28:59.000
Um,
yeah.
You know what I gotta admit,

1583
01:28:59.001 --> 01:29:02.670
the only reason why I watch a fucking movie TV is just to watch the fights.

1584
01:29:03.660 --> 01:29:08.070
And I watched that show.
Dexter,
is anybody even still listening to this podcast?

1585
01:29:08.071 --> 01:29:12.210
I'm so fucking jet lag right now from flying to seeing three hockey games and

1586
01:29:12.211 --> 01:29:14.480
three nights I think.
I feel like I'm just a,

1587
01:29:15.180 --> 01:29:18.630
I'm reading like the fucking stock report.
All right.
Underrated.
Oh,

1588
01:29:18.631 --> 01:29:23.370
this should wake you up.
The sex swing.
The sex swing is underrated.

1589
01:29:23.910 --> 01:29:25.570
Really?
I didn't know people were out there.

1590
01:29:26.140 --> 01:29:29.970
[inaudible] think fucking blows or maybe you're saying it's underrated because

1591
01:29:29.971 --> 01:29:33.900
no one really talks about it.
Okay.
Let's hear the review.
The sex swing.
Really,

1592
01:29:33.901 --> 01:29:38.370
I'm not trying to be scandalous or anything.
Um,

1593
01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:42.420
if this is something people have not yet tried,
for Christ's sake,
try it.

1594
01:29:42.750 --> 01:29:46.710
I promise.
It makes it fun and easy to fuck.
Yes.

1595
01:29:46.711 --> 01:29:49.020
Because the rest of us find it tedious

1596
01:29:52.050 --> 01:29:54.480
and not fun.
You know what?
That's the way you should,
you know what?

1597
01:29:54.510 --> 01:29:55.450
I think that that's,
uh,

1598
01:29:55.900 --> 01:29:59.760
the sex swing should be for old people who get Viagara and they still want to

1599
01:29:59.761 --> 01:30:03.510
fuck.
All right.
Oh Wow.
I just said I wasn't going to do sex material,

1600
01:30:03.511 --> 01:30:08.040
but you really just fucking,
you know,
he just fucking lobbed it over and that,

1601
01:30:08.310 --> 01:30:11.610
okay,
this is what you do.
Okay.
You fucking lube up grandma.
All right.

1602
01:30:11.940 --> 01:30:14.490
Not Grandma your wife.
Now.
It's really disgusting.
All right.

1603
01:30:14.820 --> 01:30:17.550
You fucking take a little by Agra

1604
01:30:19.950 --> 01:30:23.730
and then you just push her away.
Like just when you like a little kid,

1605
01:30:23.731 --> 01:30:25.980
you just push,
your wage keeps coming to you.
Ah,

1606
01:30:26.130 --> 01:30:31.030
and then you just push her away again.
Whew.
All right.

1607
01:30:31.860 --> 01:30:36.540
You fucking bag away.
And what else?
What if you am pregnant?
You know,

1608
01:30:38.380 --> 01:30:41.220
Sherry,
you'd be dead by the time the kids fucking in kindergarten,
but you know,

1609
01:30:41.221 --> 01:30:43.020
yeah,
you'll fucking be on good day America.

1610
01:30:44.340 --> 01:30:47.760
They think of that act like it was cute.
Like when Tony Randall had a kid at 72.

1611
01:30:48.150 --> 01:30:52.050
Oh that Tony and Tony fucking Randall,
you don't,

1612
01:30:52.051 --> 01:30:55.440
even if you have a kid at 72,
you know,
especially if it's a boy,

1613
01:30:55.470 --> 01:30:59.760
what you basically just had is a future felon.
All right?

1614
01:30:59.761 --> 01:31:04.761
Because the fucking confusion of having a 72 year old gay man is your dad who

1615
01:31:04.951 --> 01:31:08.400
dies when you're in the fourth grade.
You know,
at the very least,

1616
01:31:08.430 --> 01:31:10.440
you know you're going to rob a convenience store.

1617
01:31:12.030 --> 01:31:15.840
I don't know that I was just,
that was really,
I thought it was a,

1618
01:31:16.500 --> 01:31:19.530
that was an asshole move on his part and I've never been able to enjoy the odd

1619
01:31:19.531 --> 01:31:24.450
couple the way I used to.
Um,
all right.
All right.

1620
01:31:24.451 --> 01:31:27.000
Overrated.
I like this one.
This is a great one song.

1621
01:31:27.240 --> 01:31:30.000
This is overrated songs for causes.

1622
01:31:30.540 --> 01:31:34.920
You know those hacky collaboration's with a bunch of stars in the same studio.

1623
01:31:36.370 --> 01:31:40.350
I'm,
you're a singer.
Lead the life and death shit to someone else.
All right.

1624
01:31:40.351 --> 01:31:44.400
That's sort of a two part thing there.
I hate songs for causes.
Um,

1625
01:31:44.820 --> 01:31:48.900
I didn't mind that we are the world kind of Shit just because that actually

1626
01:31:48.901 --> 01:31:50.160
seemed like a,

1627
01:31:50.520 --> 01:31:54.720
there was so many people involved that no one really got the credit.

1628
01:31:55.320 --> 01:31:58.410
But like,
um,
you know,
when all those rednecks will make on those,

1629
01:31:58.411 --> 01:32:02.080
let's go to war song songs and protect the boys.

1630
01:32:02.890 --> 01:32:06.040
Those songs were really,
really fucking cheesy.
Oh,

1631
01:32:06.130 --> 01:32:09.970
is that Warren and Uncle Sam's going to put a boot in your ass or whatever the

1632
01:32:09.971 --> 01:32:10.621
fuck that one was.

1633
01:32:10.621 --> 01:32:15.430
I was just really one of the most ignorant songs I think I've ever heard.

1634
01:32:16.270 --> 01:32:18.280
And uh,
and plus,
you know,

1635
01:32:18.310 --> 01:32:22.420
like who the fuck is not gonna like a song that says,
you know,

1636
01:32:23.710 --> 01:32:26.110
support the troops and let's go fuck up some people.

1637
01:32:28.150 --> 01:32:31.360
I guess they've always done that.
Right?
The bogo Boogie Woogie bugle boy.

1638
01:32:31.540 --> 01:32:36.070
Remember that?
About the name of the day,
the DAB at that.
All right.
Um,

1639
01:32:36.160 --> 01:32:38.920
and you said you were a singer.
Leave the life and death shit to someone else.

1640
01:32:39.250 --> 01:32:42.070
I disagree with that.
I don't think just because you're in the public eye,

1641
01:32:42.071 --> 01:32:45.220
therefore you shouldn't talk about who you vote for or you shouldn't have

1642
01:32:45.221 --> 01:32:49.420
opinions.
All right?
Be honest with yourself.
All right,
the F,

1643
01:32:49.710 --> 01:32:52.480
there's every bar.
You walk into this,
people talking politics,

1644
01:32:52.750 --> 01:32:55.780
they're talking life and death shit.
People sitting there going,
dude,
you know,

1645
01:32:55.781 --> 01:32:57.240
we should know.
You know,

1646
01:32:57.250 --> 01:33:01.360
we should write some fucking more on down the end of the bar.
You listen to him,

1647
01:33:01.570 --> 01:33:04.720
you'll actually fucking wait until he's finished.
You'll never call him a moron,

1648
01:33:04.900 --> 01:33:07.830
but then all of a sudden you have a fucking hit song and you,

1649
01:33:07.831 --> 01:33:10.450
you don't want to hear somebody talking about it.
You know what it is.

1650
01:33:10.660 --> 01:33:14.170
This is what it is.
I should've just said,
this is what it is.
Rather than go,

1651
01:33:14.171 --> 01:33:18.730
you know what it is.
All right.
I'm like,
you could actually respond to me.

1652
01:33:19.120 --> 01:33:19.901
It's the fact,

1653
01:33:19.901 --> 01:33:24.430
it's very hard to do stuff like that without coming off as preachy.
And um,

1654
01:33:25.540 --> 01:33:28.210
that's another thing in my act that I tried to never do.

1655
01:33:28.420 --> 01:33:32.950
I never use the word we because I saw a comedian do it one time and it annoyed

1656
01:33:32.951 --> 01:33:35.560
the shit out of me.
He was like,
do we do this now?

1657
01:33:35.740 --> 01:33:39.670
We want a country where we a blind.
I immediately was like,
dude,

1658
01:33:39.671 --> 01:33:43.990
I want to fucking choke you.
I'm with the Mike Court.

1659
01:33:44.560 --> 01:33:47.410
Oh God.
Just the references are just done flying out.
You know?

1660
01:33:48.310 --> 01:33:50.650
That's really is a train wreck.
This is like a,
what was that?

1661
01:33:50.680 --> 01:33:52.500
What was that fucking album that,
that dude,

1662
01:33:52.660 --> 01:33:57.070
I'd not from the beach boys never put up.
What was it called?

1663
01:33:57.071 --> 01:34:01.150
A fucking pet sounds.
It finally,

1664
01:34:01.151 --> 01:34:03.040
finally just put it out when he was just going nuts.

1665
01:34:03.041 --> 01:34:04.780
This is my podcast version of this.

1666
01:34:06.040 --> 01:34:08.710
I'm saw that let George Michael one where he's just like,

1667
01:34:08.711 --> 01:34:10.570
I'm not going to be in the videos dialing.

1668
01:34:10.571 --> 01:34:13.840
I'm just going to put other people in and I want the music to stand on itself,

1669
01:34:14.140 --> 01:34:17.870
and then his career just takes a fucking nose dive.
It's like,
listen.
Um,

1670
01:34:18.820 --> 01:34:22.150
listen.
Okay.
Even gay or Tom Cruise,
if you're not,

1671
01:34:23.790 --> 01:34:28.450
if you're not fucking wearing shaking your ass in the TV with your little

1672
01:34:28.451 --> 01:34:32.680
fucking stupid little scruff going,
nobody gives a fuck.
You know?

1673
01:34:33.040 --> 01:34:36.070
I know I didn't give a fuck as much.
I was like,

1674
01:34:36.071 --> 01:34:40.720
if I couldn't see George Michael's ass,
um,
he would.

1675
01:34:40.721 --> 01:34:43.960
That was a very confusing artists for me cause I really liked how we sang on

1676
01:34:43.961 --> 01:34:48.790
some songs.
Um,
like when he redid that Elton John Song,
he fucking destroyed it.

1677
01:34:48.791 --> 01:34:52.750
But he was just so fucking a feminine.
It just made me uncomfortable.

1678
01:34:54.100 --> 01:34:56.950
You know,
if he just said,
listen,

1679
01:34:56.951 --> 01:35:00.500
I'm gay and I just got done blowing somebody and I'd really love to do it again,

1680
01:35:00.680 --> 01:35:02.870
that would destroy the tension.
And he'd be like,
okay,

1681
01:35:02.871 --> 01:35:04.910
he's out in the open and then he can laugh about it.
You know,

1682
01:35:05.480 --> 01:35:09.320
he did I just blow somebody and I was singing a song,
oh,
I'm going to guy.

1683
01:35:10.340 --> 01:35:15.080
But it's a fact that he doesn't bring it up and how we singing.
And occasionally,

1684
01:35:15.081 --> 01:35:17.930
you know,
he does a little fucking twinkle toes move.

1685
01:35:18.320 --> 01:35:21.950
It just makes it fucking uncomfortable and very hard to enjoy the music.

1686
01:35:22.400 --> 01:35:26.240
All right.
Another thing that is underrated,
a good waiter and or bartender,

1687
01:35:27.920 --> 01:35:30.290
um,
just some guys really good at his job,

1688
01:35:30.350 --> 01:35:32.780
especially when you don't have to ask him for anything.

1689
01:35:32.780 --> 01:35:34.970
And he's right on top of it.
Absolutely.

1690
01:35:35.720 --> 01:35:39.120
Like the fucking waiters in the bartenders over at Smith and one Lidsky.

1691
01:35:39.830 --> 01:35:42.860
You ever want to go there and have a fucking professional waiter?
Slash.

1692
01:35:42.861 --> 01:35:46.700
Bartender?
I told you guys I was over there last,
I was just fucking great.

1693
01:35:46.701 --> 01:35:49.580
You felt like a god to him.
It felt like you were really in the rat pack,

1694
01:35:50.330 --> 01:35:55.250
but he was dressed nice.
Um,
get married.
Let people know you're not a homo.

1695
01:35:56.130 --> 01:35:58.310
Um,
thanksgiving,
uh,
is overrated.

1696
01:35:58.311 --> 01:36:01.670
A day involved with nothing but gorging yourself and watching high school and

1697
01:36:01.671 --> 01:36:05.930
pro football,
junk food,
breasts,
breakfast,
cereals,
overrated.

1698
01:36:06.470 --> 01:36:07.221
I don't know about you,

1699
01:36:07.221 --> 01:36:11.780
but a bowl of fruity pebbles or cookie cookie crisp is just as good when you

1700
01:36:11.781 --> 01:36:16.460
first wake up as when you shit faced.
You know what?
I gotta agree with you,

1701
01:36:16.461 --> 01:36:18.440
but I would definitely go with fruity pebbles,

1702
01:36:19.640 --> 01:36:24.500
cookie crisp and captain crunch.
You know,
as much as I liked him as a kid.

1703
01:36:24.860 --> 01:36:28.730
Do you ever get a mouthful of those things and you that when you bite down,

1704
01:36:29.210 --> 01:36:30.740
there's like three of them.
One of them,

1705
01:36:30.741 --> 01:36:34.790
just one of them turned sideways on your tongue and it misses your teeth and it

1706
01:36:34.791 --> 01:36:39.440
hits the roof of your mouth.
I mean,
dude,
that is a fucking pain.
Like,

1707
01:36:39.441 --> 01:36:42.230
I mean in Guantanamo they should do that.

1708
01:36:42.260 --> 01:36:46.910
They should fucking put fucking Coco Crisp on fucking people's tongues and make

1709
01:36:46.911 --> 01:36:50.210
them bite down.
You get all the information you want.
I don't like those series.

1710
01:36:50.211 --> 01:36:51.830
I don't like cereals that,
you know,

1711
01:36:51.980 --> 01:36:55.160
are they going on the outside of your teeth and they go right up in between.

1712
01:36:55.161 --> 01:36:58.760
You know that that skin that covers your teeth,
whatever.

1713
01:36:58.761 --> 01:37:03.440
That's I guess that's called your face.
Yeah.
Gets,
gets underneath that,

1714
01:37:03.441 --> 01:37:05.630
you know,
and just fucking drives it in there.

1715
01:37:05.960 --> 01:37:08.000
And then that night you forget that you did it,

1716
01:37:08.250 --> 01:37:12.620
then you're brushing your teeth and of course the toothbrush goes off your teeth

1717
01:37:12.621 --> 01:37:14.630
and goes right into that raw fucking place.

1718
01:37:15.200 --> 01:37:20.090
I don't like those series fruity pebbles.
I like,
what else do I like?

1719
01:37:20.091 --> 01:37:21.500
You know,
fruity pebbles is one of the few ones.

1720
01:37:22.250 --> 01:37:25.940
I don't get that fucking crazy with breakfast series.
I like it.
I like classics.

1721
01:37:26.570 --> 01:37:31.460
Cheerio's raisin brand,
grape nuts flakes.
I like great nuts.

1722
01:37:32.600 --> 01:37:34.940
You know,
and I know you think,
okay,
those things are so granulated,

1723
01:37:34.941 --> 01:37:38.000
they can't cut,
cut up your fucking mouth.
I really have to end this podcast.

1724
01:37:38.330 --> 01:37:41.930
I gotta apologize to you guys.
One of the worst podcasts I've had.
I've just,

1725
01:37:41.931 --> 01:37:42.764
you know,

1726
01:37:42.920 --> 01:37:47.920
probably nine times during this podcast have literally just kinda come to

1727
01:37:49.310 --> 01:37:52.490
feeling like I passed out for three minutes and I know I continued talking,

1728
01:37:52.491 --> 01:37:56.790
so I apologize for any photo and any sort of,
I can't even talk with them.
Me,

1729
01:37:57.960 --> 01:38:02.580
I said any Fordham instead of any sort of,
alright,
here we go.
Let's get,
let's,

1730
01:38:02.581 --> 01:38:07.230
let's wrap this up bill and get on with it.
Okay.
Um,
another thing,

1731
01:38:07.231 --> 01:38:08.370
overrated.
Uh,

1732
01:38:08.470 --> 01:38:13.410
a doodle as the balls to wear for that is fucking hilarious.
All right,

1733
01:38:13.411 --> 01:38:14.041
here's a story.

1734
01:38:14.041 --> 01:38:18.060
I saw a guy the other day wearing a full length raccoon coat and it looked so

1735
01:38:18.061 --> 01:38:19.230
fucking bad ass.

1736
01:38:19.470 --> 01:38:23.730
And the best part was that he also had the fox head scarf to go with it.

1737
01:38:24.270 --> 01:38:27.420
Maybe you want to get one of my own.
You know what?
That's fucking hilarious.

1738
01:38:28.050 --> 01:38:31.440
There's not enough people out there dressed like fur trappers,
you know,

1739
01:38:32.700 --> 01:38:34.050
that's also,
you know,
because that's,

1740
01:38:34.080 --> 01:38:38.040
that's one of those things like merry Christmas now it's just become taboo to

1741
01:38:38.280 --> 01:38:42.840
wear for,
which,
you know,
I wouldn't wear for,
but uh,
you know,
I would never,

1742
01:38:42.900 --> 01:38:47.400
you know,
spray ketchup at somebody who was wearing a all of a sudden pheasant.

1743
01:38:47.550 --> 01:38:50.850
I almost said a pheasant.
That really is my default animal,
isn't it?

1744
01:38:51.870 --> 01:38:54.990
God dammit.
You know what?
Whoever wrote that in,
you got me.

1745
01:38:55.110 --> 01:39:00.060
You got one of my ticks.
We played poker.
You'd know exactly what my hand was.
Um,

1746
01:39:00.210 --> 01:39:01.620
all right.
One more overrated,

1747
01:39:01.621 --> 01:39:04.680
underrated Sidney Crosby of the Pittsburgh Penguins.

1748
01:39:05.640 --> 01:39:09.180
And Am is overrated is hype of being the next one in hockey.

1749
01:39:09.181 --> 01:39:12.480
I'm so fucking sick and tired of hearing this out be it,

1750
01:39:12.510 --> 01:39:14.220
it's died down the past year.

1751
01:39:14.610 --> 01:39:18.090
Hearing that he's the next [inaudible] I'm sick of hearing that he's next.

1752
01:39:18.120 --> 01:39:22.470
The next Greski he's not.
Um,
yeah,
well I mean that's Kinda like,

1753
01:39:23.460 --> 01:39:24.400
that's not his fault,
dude.

1754
01:39:24.480 --> 01:39:27.990
That's because everyone wants someone to be the next Gretzky.
You know,

1755
01:39:28.500 --> 01:39:31.350
he's not writing the articles.
That's like after Michael Jordan retired,

1756
01:39:31.890 --> 01:39:33.210
there was a nice,
you know,

1757
01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:35.790
there's always going to be that hangover and saying someone's going to be the

1758
01:39:35.791 --> 01:39:40.470
next fucking Jordan because you want to see it and I ain't going to happen.

1759
01:39:42.660 --> 01:39:47.010
Um,
and I think,
uh,
that's it.
Some quick ones.
Underrated or overrated,
underrated.

1760
01:39:47.011 --> 01:39:51.600
Vinyl.
Overrated.
The compact disc.
Um,

1761
01:39:51.870 --> 01:39:55.980
I think compact this or underrated,
you know,
all you people going out,

1762
01:39:56.080 --> 01:39:58.170
they just get your music digitally and then what happens?

1763
01:39:58.171 --> 01:40:01.020
You fucking iPod dies and you lose your entire collection.

1764
01:40:01.660 --> 01:40:03.420
I've talked about this.
You want the comp.

1765
01:40:03.421 --> 01:40:07.980
Having a compact disc is like having the gold behind your paper money.
All right?

1766
01:40:07.981 --> 01:40:12.981
You need to back up your digital shit cause it's not worth anything compact.

1767
01:40:13.561 --> 01:40:18.000
This are tangible.
You have the vinyl,
definitely underrated.

1768
01:40:18.030 --> 01:40:21.660
It definitely gets hot and sticky in the sun,
but if you spill something,

1769
01:40:21.661 --> 01:40:24.690
it's very easy to clean and a,
that's it.

1770
01:40:24.720 --> 01:40:27.450
That's still your Monday morning podcast for this week.

1771
01:40:27.451 --> 01:40:30.030
I really apologize for being so fucking jet lag.

1772
01:40:30.031 --> 01:40:35.031
I hope I can get some sort of points for getting right off the Goddamn plane and

1773
01:40:35.790 --> 01:40:40.590
um,
you know,
doing the project.
Jesus Christ.

1774
01:40:40.591 --> 01:40:44.770
Listen to me.
Just family.
I'm like a fucking old woman.
Um,
all right here.

1775
01:40:44.771 --> 01:40:47.400
Here we go.
Here we go.
What do I have the hype here?

1776
01:40:47.430 --> 01:40:51.420
I'm literally taking off my hooded sweatshirt.
That's how right in the door.

1777
01:40:51.421 --> 01:40:56.320
I was when I fucking started doing this podcast.
Um,
I am going to be,

1778
01:40:57.910 --> 01:41:00.280
I'm going to be,
let me get on the fucking website here.

1779
01:41:00.430 --> 01:41:04.150
If you're still hanging in here,
I really should send you some sort of a gift.
Uh,

1780
01:41:04.180 --> 01:41:07.660
would you like to hear another holiday song?
And it's like fucking a,

1781
01:41:07.750 --> 01:41:10.240
I don't know the words.
You know,

1782
01:41:11.680 --> 01:41:15.730
you don't mind mother fucking holiday song I hate the most is silver belts.

1783
01:41:17.650 --> 01:41:22.650
It's just the sum of about the tempo or that song just sucks the life out of the

1784
01:41:22.810 --> 01:41:25.020
lower half of my body and I just have to,
you know,

1785
01:41:25.040 --> 01:41:29.500
it always comes on when I'm in the mall and I really just don't want to shop

1786
01:41:29.501 --> 01:41:34.501
anymore and it just comes on Silverado silver

1787
01:41:38.790 --> 01:41:42.070
[inaudible] that one.
And I don't like a Jingle Bell Rock.

1788
01:41:42.760 --> 01:41:45.010
I hate any sort of jazzing up

1789
01:41:47.650 --> 01:41:51.760
[inaudible] jingle bell rock POW Jenga Bell time.
Yeah.
I fucking hate that song.

1790
01:41:51.820 --> 01:41:56.230
And I hate that Michael Jack Jackson.
Santa Claus is coming to town.

1791
01:41:57.850 --> 01:42:02.260
I hate the way he phrases it and I know I'm making fun of a fucking seven year

1792
01:42:02.261 --> 01:42:05.380
old and I should just be happy that he was able to go into the studio and

1793
01:42:05.381 --> 01:42:07.090
perform that day.
But I didn't

1794
01:42:10.840 --> 01:42:14.020
shut the fuck.
Just shut up Michael,

1795
01:42:15.610 --> 01:42:20.020
the seven year old.
You pleased you shut the fuck up.
I hate that song.

1796
01:42:20.410 --> 01:42:25.150
I really hate that song.
Um,
I like the classic slower once the Bing Crosby once.

1797
01:42:26.710 --> 01:42:31.330
Does anybody care?
All right.
I'm on my website.
Ah,
my,
when he got here.
All right.

1798
01:42:31.331 --> 01:42:34.990
I'm in January.
I'm taking a break until January.
I right.
Uh,

1799
01:42:35.070 --> 01:42:38.230
I fuck with January 8th.
I'm already back out on the road.

1800
01:42:39.880 --> 01:42:42.880
Wait,
what's today?
The 15th is 60 more days.

1801
01:42:42.881 --> 01:42:46.900

1802
01:42:46.901 --> 01:42:51.490

1803
01:42:51.491 --> 01:42:55.110
Florida.
January 8th,
ninth and 10th now.

1804
01:42:55.111 --> 01:42:59.080
I haven't been there in a long fucking time and uh,

1805
01:42:59.440 --> 01:43:01.940
that they'd scare the shit out of me because,
um,

1806
01:43:02.470 --> 01:43:06.370
Florida is a crazy animal man.
I don't know what to do with it.

1807
01:43:06.400 --> 01:43:10.750
I don't know how to sell tickets and Florida,
I've gone down there.

1808
01:43:11.170 --> 01:43:13.250
I've done what I can fucking do.
And I,

1809
01:43:13.280 --> 01:43:16.150
right now I have people around the country or like why speaking in that redneck

1810
01:43:16.180 --> 01:43:18.820
fucking southern voice.
You talking about Florida,

1811
01:43:19.460 --> 01:43:23.770
Florida's and part of the south.
Yes it is.
Yes it is.
If you get out of Miami,

1812
01:43:23.860 --> 01:43:28.600
that entire,
that entire state is,
is,
you know,
you could film

1813
01:43:30.400 --> 01:43:34.030
400 seasons of cops,
dog,
the Bonnie Hunter.

1814
01:43:34.780 --> 01:43:37.690
And if you ever really,
you know,
look at Dexter.

1815
01:43:37.691 --> 01:43:40.000
Dexter is his fucking tape down there,
right?

1816
01:43:40.060 --> 01:43:43.630
Isn't it Miami vice splitting.
My told me that.

1817
01:43:43.631 --> 01:43:47.380
What do they have on those tee shirts down there?
Florida.
Uh,

1818
01:43:47.980 --> 01:43:52.910
what do they call it?
A cool place for shady,
something like that.

1819
01:43:54.230 --> 01:43:56.600
Hot Place for shady people too.
One of those play on words.

1820
01:43:56.690 --> 01:43:57.770
I'm not good at that shit.
All right.

1821
01:43:57.800 --> 01:44:01.670
I'm going to be at the Improv Tam in Tampa on January 8th,

1822
01:44:01.671 --> 01:44:06.671
ninth and 10th and a Oh and January 8th is the show your tits show.

1823
01:44:07.520 --> 01:44:08.840
Just to let you know,
uh,

1824
01:44:08.930 --> 01:44:11.780
that's something new that that's an added on to do with me.
You know,

1825
01:44:11.781 --> 01:44:12.800
I'm actually against it.

1826
01:44:12.830 --> 01:44:16.070
I don't want girls to show me their titties during my show,
you know,

1827
01:44:16.071 --> 01:44:19.100
but you know,
it's something that the Improv's are coming up with.
You know,

1828
01:44:19.101 --> 01:44:23.660
I think it's sexist,
but you know,
I don't want to cause any static.
So,
you know,

1829
01:44:23.661 --> 01:44:27.170
just know that when you're showing me your tips during that show that uh,

1830
01:44:27.171 --> 01:44:29.960
you know,
there wasn't my call.
Uh,
I don't condone it,

1831
01:44:29.961 --> 01:44:33.500
but I was powerless to stop it.
So,
you know,

1832
01:44:34.980 --> 01:44:38.360
yeah,
I guess I'll go along with it.
I'll sign some titties after the show,

1833
01:44:38.361 --> 01:44:41.350
you know,
show me a phone.
I mean,
whatever you mean.

1834
01:44:42.050 --> 01:44:45.260
I mean I'm just there for the art,
you know.
Okay.
Uh,

1835
01:44:45.261 --> 01:44:49.220
and then after that I'm going to be at the Improv in Houston,
Texas.

1836
01:44:49.820 --> 01:44:52.490
January 22nd,
23rd and 24th.

1837
01:44:53.240 --> 01:44:56.450
I really excited to go back to that one because I'm,

1838
01:44:57.170 --> 01:45:01.130
I'm actually going to hit this guitar store out there called South Park Guitars.

1839
01:45:01.640 --> 01:45:05.090
They have nothing but lefthanded guitars there and I'm going to go there and

1840
01:45:05.091 --> 01:45:08.240
spend some money,
mother fucker.
Um,
after that.

1841
01:45:08.241 --> 01:45:13.210
And we had the Wilbur Theater in Boston and the comedy connection in Chickopee,

1842
01:45:13.260 --> 01:45:15.350
Massachusetts February 6th through the seventh.

1843
01:45:17.030 --> 01:45:21.800
And that is that wow.
47 minute podcast.
That's how fucking jet lag that was.

1844
01:45:21.801 --> 01:45:24.950
I knew I just fell asleep for like 10 minutes in the middle of that.
I apologize.

1845
01:45:24.951 --> 01:45:29.540
This is way too fucking long.
Um,
everybody have a merry Christmas.
Okay?

1846
01:45:30.170 --> 01:45:32.000
And I mean that in a nice way.
Heaven.
Merry Christmas.

1847
01:45:32.001 --> 01:45:34.400
Even if you're not fucking celebrating Christmas,

1848
01:45:35.810 --> 01:45:40.140
have a fucking merry Christmas.
God Damn.
It's not a bad thing.
It's not a real,

1849
01:45:40.570 --> 01:45:44.510
some fucking real.
How did that become bad?
I don't know.
Bill,

1850
01:45:44.511 --> 01:45:47.420
why don't you fucking analyze it for another 47 minutes.
All right,

1851
01:45:47.450 --> 01:45:50.900
I'm outta here.
Um,
God bless all of you.
I'll talk to you next Monday.

1852
01:45:51.320 --> 01:45:52.153
Have a great [inaudible].

1853
01:45:52.180 --> 01:45:56.410
<v 4>Okay.
Take it easy again.
Took a deep breath.</v>

1854
01:45:56.411 --> 01:46:00.310
I fell down.
I could not stand captain a Ram.

1855
01:46:00.700 --> 01:46:05.700
He started writing up some needs he said was set up for right here.

1856
01:46:06.190 --> 01:46:10.510
I find a place with beads.
Then his cop homes down the street.

1857
01:46:10.780 --> 01:46:15.780
Crazy as alone and throws us all in jail for Carrion.

1858
01:46:16.031 --> 01:46:20.480
Huh?
Mia Bust,
busted out.

1859
01:46:21.210 --> 01:46:24.960
Don't even asked me how I went to get some help.

1860
01:46:24.961 --> 01:46:29.961
I walk by and Guernsey cow who directed me down to the Bowery slums where people

1861
01:46:32.831 --> 01:46:36.230
carried signs around saying,
Ban the bombs.

1862
01:46:36.520 --> 01:46:40.410
I realized right away and I said,
I hope that I'm not late.

1863
01:46:40.900 --> 01:46:44.680
When I realize I hadn't eaten for five days.

1864
01:46:46.780 --> 01:46:51.780
I went to restaurants looking father told him I was the editor of a famous ed to

1865
01:46:54.960 --> 01:46:57.780
get the the waitress.
He was handsome.

1866
01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:02.430
He wore a powder blue Cape and some Suzette.
I said,

1867
01:47:02.431 --> 01:47:04.530
could you please make that great?

1868
01:47:05.790 --> 01:47:08.670
Justin Lowe kitchen exploded from boiling fat.

1869
01:47:09.240 --> 01:47:12.990
Food was frying everywhere.
I left with that hat.

1870
01:47:16.080 --> 01:47:19.310
Didn't mean to be nosy,
but I went into it.

1871
01:47:19.320 --> 01:47:24.210
Bank did get some feel for a rab and all the boys back in the tank.

1872
01:47:24.690 --> 01:47:28.770
They asked me for collateral,
pulled down my pants.

1873
01:47:28.920 --> 01:47:31.440
They threw me in the alley,
went up,

1874
01:47:31.830 --> 01:47:36.150
comes this girl from France who invited me to her house.
I went,

1875
01:47:36.151 --> 01:47:41.151
but you had a friend who are not my boots and I was on the street again.

1876
01:47:48.850 --> 01:47:49.190
<v 7>[inaudible].</v>

1877
01:47:49.190 --> 01:47:53.560
<v 4>Then I wrapped up on at her house with the u s flag upon display.</v>

1878
01:47:53.770 --> 01:47:57.790
I said,
could you help me out?
I got some friends down in the wait,

1879
01:47:58.150 --> 01:48:02.350
the man says,
and get out of here,
Terry,
you them from them.

1880
01:48:02.560 --> 01:48:03.640
I've said,
you know,

1881
01:48:03.641 --> 01:48:08.641
they refuse Jesus to the city or not him out of here before I break your phones

1882
01:48:09.611 --> 01:48:10.660
ain't your pop.

1883
01:48:11.020 --> 01:48:14.820
I decided to have him arrested and I went looking for a

1884
01:48:20.800 --> 01:48:20.930
<v 7>[inaudible].</v>

1885
01:48:20.930 --> 01:48:25.370
<v 4>Well ran outside and I hopped inside a cab.</v>

1886
01:48:25.630 --> 01:48:28.880
I went up the other door,
this Englishman,

1887
01:48:29.250 --> 01:48:32.630
stiff fam as he saw me leave a hotdog stand in,

1888
01:48:32.631 --> 01:48:34.310
a cheery in that stood,

1889
01:48:35.210 --> 01:48:38.600
walked across from the building advertising brotherhood.

1890
01:48:38.980 --> 01:48:43.040
I ran right through the front door
[inaudible],

1891
01:48:43.370 --> 01:48:47.540
but it was just a funeral planner and the man asked me who I was.

1892
01:48:49.100 --> 01:48:53.360
I repeated that my friends were all in jail with a sigh.

1893
01:48:53.690 --> 01:48:57.740
They gave me his card.
He said,
call me if they died.

1894
01:48:58.070 --> 01:49:03.070
I shook his hand and said goodbye and ran up to the street when a bowling ball

1895
01:49:03.711 --> 01:49:06.680
came down the road and knocked me off my feet.

1896
01:49:07.100 --> 01:49:09.170
The pay phone was ringing.

1897
01:49:09.620 --> 01:49:13.760
Just about blew my mind when I picked it up and said,
hello,

1898
01:49:13.880 --> 01:49:15.650
if foot game through the line

1899
01:49:22.650 --> 01:49:23.400
<v 7>[inaudible].</v>

1900
01:49:23.400 --> 01:49:28.400
<v 4>By this time I was fed up at trying to make it stab at bringing back some help</v>

1901
01:49:29.250 --> 01:49:33.780
from my friends and captain,
a rat.
I decided to flip a coin,

1902
01:49:34.320 --> 01:49:39.320
either hips of chills would let me know if I should go back to the ship or back

1903
01:49:39.550 --> 01:49:44.550
to jail.
So sealer suit.
Matt got a crime to flip.

1904
01:49:45.330 --> 01:49:49.070
It came up,
tails around with.
So I made it back in the shit.

1905
01:49:51.520 --> 01:49:55.880
When I got back and took the parking ticket off the mask,

1906
01:49:56.170 --> 01:50:00.460
I was ripping it to shreds.
When his coast guard boat went past,

1907
01:50:00.790 --> 01:50:04.960
they asked me [inaudible] name and I said,
Captain Kid,

1908
01:50:05.140 --> 01:50:10.110
they believe me.
But they wanted to know what exactly that I did.
I said,

1909
01:50:10.210 --> 01:50:13.240
for the Pope of you route,
I was employed.

1910
01:50:13.540 --> 01:50:16.760
They let me go right away.
They were very pan or

1911
01:50:26.130 --> 01:50:26.963
<v 7>[inaudible].</v>

1912
01:50:27.660 --> 01:50:29.910
<v 4>Well,
the last I heard of a rabbi,</v>

1913
01:50:29.930 --> 01:50:34.930
he was stuck on a whale that was married to the deputy sheriff of the jail.

1914
01:50:36.510 --> 01:50:41.510
But the funniest thing was when I was leaving the baby as far three ships

1915
01:50:42.601 --> 01:50:43.434
sailing,
and

1916
01:50:45.630 --> 01:50:49.560
I asked the captain what his name was and have come,
he didn't drive a truck.

1917
01:50:50.640 --> 01:50:53.730
Niece's name was Columbus.
Good luck.

1918
01:51:00.500 --> 01:51:00.500
<v 7>[inaudible].</v>
