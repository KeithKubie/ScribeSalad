Hey it's me Destin welcome back to Smarter Every Day. You remember a few weeks ago I did a bullet time video

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.090
in my back yard with a bonfire? Well this week it's a little bit different.

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:12.090
Check it out. This is a 20 camera setup. Got a software package

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.110
that syncs it all together. This is how you do it right,

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:20.160
you know, I did OK in my back yard. So this is Henry from MinutePhysics and he's about to do a

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.190
bullet time exhibit here at the US Space and Rocket Center.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.220
(Computer voice) 3..2..1.. Like your style!

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.230
(Henry) I think I jumped too soon.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.740
(Destin) That's awesome.
(Henry) That's so amazing. It worked!

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:40.260
Cool it can email your videos.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.280
- No way.
- Yes, yes, yes, OK.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.300
You gotta do this, you gotta do it Destin. [laugh]

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.300
You gotta do it.
- Why?
-Cause it's amazing.
- Of course I'm gonna do it.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.360
Alright I'm gonna do it.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.360
(Computer voice) 5..4..

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.390
- So this is exactly what happens. Check this out.
- 2..1..

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.440
[music]

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:22.740
  

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.580
That was bad. I didn't time it right.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:44.710
    

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.730
The Matrix gun scene where they fight each other,

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.780
Neo and Mr Smith, go see what he does.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.980
(Computer voice) 3..2..1..

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.950
So what did we learn here.

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.980
On the last video we learned three things. First of all the radius from the center

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
of all the cameras has to be exactly the same. Secondly the angular offset of each

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.040
camera needs to be the same so it doesn't look like it's jittery. And third the exposure

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.080
and white balance needs to be the same which requires similar devices. This time our setup

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.120
was even better, and that means we can learn more. The first thing that we learned is that

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.160
inconsistent lighting is a problem. So there's a flash, there's a flash,

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.180
there's a flash. So one bad thing about this setup is you get shadows

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.240
at different points. So if we had it to do over again we'd probably bounce some light up into those shadows.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.280
Secondly the cameras have to be pointed at the exact same spot. If you'll

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.290
notice on the left, the dot on the carpet kinda jumps around and it throws your eye off.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.310
But on the right, Henry went in and corrected this for every single clip in the video,

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:05.340
which made for a nice smoother turn. So a big thank you to the

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.360
US Space &amp; Rocket Center for letting us goof off at your Math Alive exhibit. If you want

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.390
to subscribe to Henry's MinutePhysics channel check him out right here. If you want to subscribe to my channel

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:14.410
I'll do what Henry's doing.

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:17.410
Get it?

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.430
It's like bullet time in my chair. Anyway it's 2am. It's probably

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.440
way more funny to me. I have another channel. You may or may not know that.

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:29.470
It's called Funner Every Day. This week I have a question for you on it. I'm making

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:33.510
posters, it involves lasers and cats. But I have a question as to what words need to go on there.

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.560
I'll leave a link somewhere. I'm Destin, you're getting Smarter Every Day.

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:38.570
Thanks.
