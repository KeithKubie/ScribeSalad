00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:08.280
After Apollo 13’s near disaster, the fate
of the lunar program was back on rocky ground.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.410
Apollo 14 was scheduled to launch before the
end of the year and it would provide the most

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.180
extensive scientific exploration yet,

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.500
but if it was ever going to take off,

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.380
investigators needed to determine what exactly went wrong on Apollo 13.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.160
And NASA had to make sure that it wouldn’t happen again.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.060
The investigation found that the
near-disaster was a combination of

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:37.940
human and design error.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.460
The source of the explosion was an oxygen
tank inside the Service Module.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.900
Before it made it onto Apollo 13, the tank
went through a series of problems.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.220
In 1968, it was scheduled to fly on Apollo
10

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.300
but was accidentally dropped on the ground before the mission.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.360
After it passed a series of tests, it was
cleared to fly on Apollo 13.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.040
But then, in 1970, during pre-flight testing,
the tank wasn’t emptying as it should.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:09.000
So, to gasify the liquid oxygen, technicians
turned on the tank’s heater using 65 volts

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.060
which should have been fine since the spacecraft
components were all modified

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.320
to handle increased power in 1965.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.660
But unfortunately, the thermostatic switch
within the oxygen tank

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.660
was still geared for just 28 volts.

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:28.060
It was later found that the excess power caused
the switch to weld shut, and the temperature

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:34.320
inside the tank rose to over 500 degrees Celsius
and damaged insulation on the wires inside

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.140
the tank, leaving a high risk for a short
circuit.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.680
From the outside, though, everything appeared
to be... good enough to fly.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:50.520
So on April 11, 1970 Apollo 13 essentially
lifted off with a time bomb inside the service module.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.520
After the near disaster,
NASA had to make major structural changes

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.060
to the Command-Service Module and the Lunar
Module.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.320
Improvements were also made to the astronauts
airtight spacesuits

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.000
and the lunar surface experiment equipment.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.660
Apollo 14 would be the first crewed mission
to put these upgrades to the test.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.810
NASA selected Astronaut Alan Shepard as the
mission’s commander.

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:18.380
Almost ten years prior, Shepard became the
first American in space during Project Mercury.

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.660
Apollo 14 would mark his triumphant return
after a rare disease

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.740
kept him grounded for many years.

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:28.580
Joining Shepard, were rookies Edgar Mitchell
and Stuart Roosa.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.300
About nine months after Apollo 13, NASA was
headed back to the moon.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.180
Apollo 14 was en route to the Fra Mauro formation
- a ridged region that was believed to be

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.360
made up of an ejecta blanket from a collision
between a huge mass and the Moon.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.100
This made it an ideal landing location for
science.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.420
But getting there wasn’t as smooth as NASA
hoped.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.780
Once in lunar orbit, it took six attempts before the crew could dock the Command and Lunar Modules.

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.640
And then during the descent to the Moon, the
lunar module signaled an abort.

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.500
Mission control and the astronauts worked
through the problems though, and the crew eventually

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.720
pulled off a high precision landing within
target range.

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:22.000
On the surface, Shepard and Mitchell attempted
a trek to the rim of the Cone Crater, collecting

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.880
lunar rocks in their space wagon along the
way.

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.270
They also measured the strength of the Moon’s
magnetic field, collected samples of the solar

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:33.020
wind and studied the properties of lunar soil.

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:38.400
Additional experiments were deployed that
enabled scientists to monitor activity from Earth.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.459
Some of these experiments would go on to detect
lunar "moonquakes", providing information

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:45.090
about the internal structure of the Moon.

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.680
And others would study the lunar ionosphere
and measure the precise distance

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.740
between Earth and the Moon.

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:55.730
Back on the CSM, Roosa conducted orbital science
activities that measured regional variations

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:02.220
in the Moon's gravitational acceleration and
the scattering of radar waves from the lunar surface.

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.080
Apollo 14 packed in more science than any
mission before it,

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.440
pushing the astronauts to new extremes.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.990
They collected over 40 kilograms of rocks
and soil from the lunar surface including

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:15.720
this one nicknamed "Big Bertha."

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.350
And Shepard, the oldest man to get to the
moon, set a new distance-traveled record on

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:25.820
the lunar surface equivalent to about 55 laps
in an Olympic-sized pool.

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:31.020
But aside from the extensive experiments and
massive terrain covered, Apollo 14 is best

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.630
remembered for this moment when Alan Shepard
broke out a modified six iron and hit two

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.900
golf balls into the cosmic distance.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:47.980
The astronauts then headed back to the CSM
to begin their return to Earth.

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:52.210
Apollo 14 has a longstanding legacy linked
to discovery.

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:57.160
The lunar samples returned have been studied
for decades, helping scientists better estimate

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.780
the age and physical nature of the moon.

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:04.040
Photos from the mission verified the role
of volcanism in the formation and modification

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:09.500
of lunar highlands and documented deep-space
phenomena known as Zodiacal light and Gegenschein.

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.460
Seeds that were aboard the mission were planted
around the world and have since grown into

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.520
living monuments of the third trip to the
Moon.

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:22.560
Apollo 14 also validated the changes NASA
made after the Apollo 13 disaster and demonstrated

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.930
that spaceflight challenges are solvable.

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:29.870
The next missions would build off this
momentum, taking exploration capabilities

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:35.880
even further with the introduction of a new
way for astronauts to explore the lunar surface.

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:40.540
