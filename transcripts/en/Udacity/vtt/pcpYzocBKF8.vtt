00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.820
So, as you just saw, plain old variables
in Swift do not allow nils, but

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:08.070
in some situations we want to allow for
nil values.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:09.700
For situations like these,

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.400
Swift has a special data type,
it's called the optional type.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.520
What is this optional data type?

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.680
An optional is like a wrapped box that
might be empty, that's the option.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.720
It might have a value or
it might be nil.
