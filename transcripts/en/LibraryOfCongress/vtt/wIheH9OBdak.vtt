00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.700
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.930
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Peterson: My
name is Betsy Peterson.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.200
I'm the Director of the American
Folklife Center here at the Library

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.240
of Congress, and on
behalf ot the staff I want

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.330
to welcome you all
today to the latest

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.160
in our Homegrown concert series.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.120
And the Homegrown concert
series is an opportunity

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.570
for the American Folklife Center
to feature music that, or dance,

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.690
that is rooted in place,
rooted in community,

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.900
and rooted in shared
cultural traditions.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.430
When we put on this series we work
throughout the year with networks

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.640
of folklorists, folk
arts coordinators,

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.270
other cultural specialists
throughout the United States

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:09.100 position:56%
who help us identify the very best
traditional musicians and performers

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.040
to come and share their art and
culture with all of you and all

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.120
of us here in Washington, D.C.,

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.870
and we're all the better
for it I have to say.

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.360
One caveat before we
begin the concert.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.650
One of the other things that's
nice about this series is

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.140
that it allows us to record
the music here, and the music

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.810
and the concerts here
become part of the Archive

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.910
of the American Folklife
Center so that it will make it

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:44.910 position:56%
onto our website through webcasts
so people around the world can hear,

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.680
and for future generations to hear.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.310
So with that said, if
you have a cell phone

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.840
or any other electronic
device, I would ask you

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.140
to turn it off right now.

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:03.110
And I also want to say that
as we work with folklorists

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.440
around the country we also
work with organizations here

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:13.350 position:56%
to make this happen, and I do want
to acknowledge our co-sponsor today,

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.070
the National Council for
the Traditional Arts,

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.000 position:56%
for helping to make this possible
and we really appreciate their help.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.900
So, with that said, I'm not
going to bring up someone else

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.970
to tell you a little bit
more about the concert today,

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.090
and that is Cliff Murphy.

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:37.780
Cliff is formerly the Director of
the Program for Traditional Arts

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.620
at the Maryland Arts Council.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.190
He is now the Director of the
Folk and Traditional Arts Program

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.490
at the National Endowment
for the Arts.

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:50.750
He's also, in his own right, a
musician, a country musician,

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.440
a rock musician, and all
sorts of other things.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.450
He also has a degree

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.610
in Ethnomusicology
from Brown University.

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.440
But I'm going to bring
him out here right now.

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.030
Cliff, along with Henry
Glassie and Douglas Peach.

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.920
just did a wonderful,
wonderful book slash recording

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.200
that has just come out, <i>Ola Belle
Reed and Southern Mountain Music</i>

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.160
<i>on the Mason-Dixon Line, </i>and
I encourage you to look for it.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.040
It's on Dust to Digital.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.510
So, with that said, I want
to introduce Cliff Murphy.

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31.040
[ Applause ]

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.340
&gt;&gt; Clifford Murphy:
Thank you, Betsy.

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.180
Hello, everybody.

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:35.680
How is everybody today?

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.680
Good? All right.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.120
I hope you're excited to
hear some great music.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.420
Are you, yes?

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:42.720
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.020
&gt;&gt; Clifford Murphy:
All right, that's good.

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.320
Welcome to your lunch break.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:50.370
My name's Cliff Murphy and I'm
very proud to be here today

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:56.390
to present today's group and
to introduce you to some folks

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:57.850
that I've had the pleasure
of working

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:04.160
with over the last seven years or
so leading up to, in some ways,

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.230
today's event and the
publication that has just come out,

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.320
<i>Ola Belle Reed and
Southern Mountain Music</i>

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.950
<i>on the Mason-Dixon Line.</i>

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.560
I've been involved here with
my friends and colleagues,

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.520
Henry Glassie and Doug Peach.

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:21.570
If you guys could wave [laughter].

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.720
My co-authors and fellow
adventurers.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.520
And Alan Burdette who's
here from the Archive

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:26.970
of Traditional Music in Indiana.

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.490
It's been a great adventure.

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.830
For those of you -- how many
people here are familiar

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.040
with Ola Belle Reed?

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.340
There's a lot.

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.490
Okay. So for those of
you who don't know,

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:43.150
Ola Belle was really a remarkable
singer, songwriter, banjo player,

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.380
traditional musician,
country philosopher --

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.310
would you say that's a fair term?

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.630
-- who lived in Rising
Sun, Maryland.

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:53.080
Was originally from
Lansing, North Carolina.

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.490
Moved up to the Mason-Dixon
Line region of --

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.560
along the
Maryland/Pennsylvania/Delaware

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:04.400
border during the Depression with a
large wave of Appalachian migrants

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.910
who came up for good jobs
and good, cheap farmland,

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.220
and settled in the region.

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.140
Brought a lot of music with them.

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:16.960
Also brought other traditions, but
what has really kind of survived

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.770
in a lot of ways is the music.

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:25.310
And so Ola Belle passed away
a little over 10 years ago

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:31.050
but joining us today is her son,
David Reed, and two, let's see,

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:32.650
her nephew, Hugh Campbell.

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.490
There are also other
relatives in the house.

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:41.140 position:56%
I know that there are members of the
Campbell family here today with us.

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:42.440
If you guys could wave.

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.950
I think there's quite a few of you.

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:48.560
So it's a real honor
to have you here today.

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:52.620
And we also have Alex
Campbell, Ola Belle's brother

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.080
and performing partner
for many years.

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:57.220
Alex's son, Rob, is here today.

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:59.100
It's great to have you with us.

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:01.900
And it's a funny thing
about this tradition.

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:05.830
So, Ola Belle and Alex started
a couple of country music parks

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:07.260
in Maryland and Pennsylvania,

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:12.410
and these became important stopping
points for a lot of musicians

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:14.840
that many of you may
have heard of --

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.650
people like the Stanley
Brothers, Bill Monroe.

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:21.650
Backstage we were talking
beforehand.

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:24.750
There's a picture of Dolly
Parton from when she performed

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:28.150
on this stage, and Rob, Alex
Campbell's son, was telling me

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:33.130 position:56%
that his job used to be to interview
Dolly when she would come through

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:35.380
and play on the family's
radio program.

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:38.150
So it tells you a little
bit about the interactions

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:43.690
between these musicians who many
of us think of as local musicians,

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:46.410
and with kind of the
national stars and how

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:48.920
that was a very fluid
thing for a very long time.

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:51.000
And these traditions kind of pass

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.510
across these boundaries
of national/local music.

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:59.480 position:56%
And also joining us today is I think
what we'd call a passel of Paisleys.

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:03.190
We have Danny Paisley,
Michael Paisley,

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:06.900
and Danny's son, Ryan,
who I think is 15?

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:08.200
Is that correct?

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:09.520
We'll just say yes.

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:13.030
Ryan plays mandolin.

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:15.710
And the Paisleys play a
brand of bluegrass music

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:19.060
that really blends honky-tonk,
country music traditions

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:22.990 position:56%
with bluegrass, with old time music.

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:27.060
And they're joined by
fiddle player TJ Lundy.

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:30.010
There are a lot of ties
between all of these musicians

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:32.220
and the collections that are
here at the Library of Congress

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:36.270
and the American Folklife Center.

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:42.700
TJ's great-grand-uncle, Emmett
Lundy, was recorded by John

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:46.540
and Elizabeth Lomax a
little over 70 years ago,

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:48.630
and those recordings reside here.

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:52.290
And also, Ola Belle was
somebody who, and Alex,

00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:53.830
were recorded by Mike Seeger.

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:57.480
And many of those recordings reside
here as well And then, or course,

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:00.590
Henry Glass's recordings
of Ola Belle, so --

00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:03.620
which are included in this
[inaudible] digital release

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:05.650
that we hope you'll check out.

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:08.020
And enough about that.

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:10.550
I think that you're all here
for music instead of a lecture.

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:11.850
Is that right?

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:13.150
Did I get the memo?

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:18.790
Okay. So, if you would please
give a warm welcome to,

00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:20.930
and I will introduce
them one-by-one,

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:25.510
Mr. Dave Reed on guitar and banjo.

00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:28.220
[ Applause ]

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:30.880
You guys can start coming on out.

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:34.340
Mr. Hugh Campbell on guitar
and vocals and [applause].

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:39.620
Both of these guys will be playing
some of their original songs.

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:44.330
We also have Mr. Danny Paisley on
guitar and vocals, Michael Paisley,

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:46.720
his brother, on the upright bass,

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:51.170
Ryan Paisley on mandolin,
and TJ Lundy on fiddle.

00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:52.470
Have I got you all?

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:53.770
&gt;&gt; David Reed: I think so.

00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:55.090
&gt;&gt; Clifford Murphy: All right.

00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:57.110
[ Applause ]

00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:59.410
Enjoy the music, everybody.

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:07.100
[ Music ]

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:08.400
&gt;&gt; All right [inaudible].

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:09.700
&gt;&gt; You all ready?

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:11.500
&gt;&gt; David Reed: Yeah.

00:09:11.500 --> 00:10:46.640
[ Music ]

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:48.940
&gt;&gt; Hey.

00:11:02.510 --> 00:13:08.110
[ Music and Singing ]

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:10.510
&gt;&gt; We could go all
the way through, too.

00:13:10.510 --> 00:14:11.050
[ Music and Singing ]

00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:12.850
&gt;&gt; Hugh Campbell: Danny
Paisley, ladies and gentlemen.

00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:18.070
[ Applause ]

00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:19.370
&gt;&gt; You know the amazing
thing about that song?

00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:20.990
You can keep going
as long as you can,

00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:22.780
until it took me a get
a string on, you know?

00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:24.340
&gt;&gt; David Reed: At least 100 years.

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:28.750
&gt;&gt; Yeah,, darling'
you can't love 140.

00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:30.120
&gt;&gt; Yeah [laughter].

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:32.220
&gt;&gt; How's everybody
doing at lunchtime?

00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:37.420
Everybody happy?

00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:40.410
Well, we're all here trying
to play a little music

00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:43.570
in honor of Ola Belle Reed.

00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:50.690
I'm sure everyone remembers such
a sweet lady that Dave's mom was.

00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:53.720
And they're going to do some songs
that she wrote and some songs

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:56.710
that they recorded, and
some songs we've done.

00:14:56.710 --> 00:15:00.430
And we'll just have a big time,
so everybody clap your hands

00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:03.390
and have fun, and we'll
proceed for the next few minutes

00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:05.590
and play some old-timey
music, all right?

00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:07.000
Hugh, you got a tune,
don't you, bud?

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.300
