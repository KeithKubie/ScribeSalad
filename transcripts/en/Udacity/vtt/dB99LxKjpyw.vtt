00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.469
There are ten lessons in this course,
and

00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:06.000
they correspond with the ten
chapters in the text.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.460
We've split Lesson 5 into two
sections because of its length.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.450
While the material is not
generally technically difficult,

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:15.100
there is a lot of it.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.340
More in fact than can be
covered in the lectures.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.620
So reading the text and
the other suggested materials is key.

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:27.710
Lessons 1 and 2 provide background on
US healthcare delivery and the role of

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.436
federal government is playing to foster
adoption of information technology.

00:00:32.436 --> 00:00:36.990
Lessons 3 through 5 cover the core
technologies that all contemporary

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:40.866
health informatic systems and
tools rest on.

00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:45.140
Lessons 6 through 8 show how health
informatics is being used in real world

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.990
applications, from electronic records
for providers and patients, to

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:53.970
managing the health of large populations
of patients over an entire region or

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.429
state, to understanding and
improving public health.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.100
Lessons 9 and 10 show how data can
be aggregated from these systems and

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.010
analyzed to gain new knowledge and

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.610
even improve the healthcare
system that generated the data.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.810
During this course we'll hear from
experts in various segments of

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:12.800
the field.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.550
It should help you see
how the knowledge and

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.230
concepts you're learning
are actually being applied.

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.830
Along the way you'll be able to test
your knowledge with frequent quizzes.

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.130
So I want you to get use
to that interactive format.

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.140
Let's try out an easy
question right now.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.728
Which of these fields involves
the use of computing?

00:01:30.728 --> 00:01:35.960
Health informatics,
Bioinformatics, Both or Neither.
