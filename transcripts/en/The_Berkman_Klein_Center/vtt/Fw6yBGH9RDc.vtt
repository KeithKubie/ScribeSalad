00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.530
We turn now to the second of
the foundational doctrines

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:23.030
in copyright law: the
idea/expression distinction.

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:25.660
Every system of copyright
law contains some version

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.380
of this distinction.

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.840
In US law, its statutory
locus is section 102(b)

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.590
of the Copyright
Act, which provides

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.140
"in no case does copyright
protection for an original work

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.790
of authorship
extend to any idea,

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.830
procedure, process, system,
method of operation,

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:51.550
concept, principle, or
discovery." (Some scholars,

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.840
such as Professor
Pam Samuelson, argue

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.600
that this provision
reaches more broadly

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.910
than the idea/expression
distinction,

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.520
but I'll put that controversy
aside for the time being.)

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.989
In the Eldred case,
which we will consider

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.400
in a subsequent lecture, the
United States Supreme Court

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.140
suggested that the
idea/expression distinction

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.980
is necessary in order
to reconcile copyright

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.940
law with the
principle of freedom

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.544
of speech embodied in
the First Amendment

00:01:18.544 --> 00:01:19.710
of the federal Constitution.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.150
Lots of other examples
of this distinction

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.310
can be found in the
law of other countries.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.920
So what exactly is this famous,
fundamental distinction?

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.800
It's easy to state, but
surprisingly hard to apply.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.360
The key concepts
are clear enough:

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.360
neither ideas nor
facts are protected

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.060
by copyright law; only the way
in which an author expresses

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.840
ideas or facts is protected.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.080
Simple enough.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:55.030
Unfortunately, the key terms
-- idea, fact, expression --

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.110
are all ambiguous and contested.

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.350
To figure out what
they mean, you

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.665
need to examine some
applications of the principles.

00:02:04.514 --> 00:02:06.930
HERE'S A GENERAL GUIDELINE:
when interpreting and applying

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.050
the idea/expression
distinction, try

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.350
to avoid attributing to those
terms their ordinary meanings.

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.560
Think of them rather
as "terms of art,"

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.040
shorthand references to loose
clusters of things that,

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.170
for policy reasons,
the law includes in --

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.210
or excludes from -- copyright.

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:26.810
Against this backdrop,
let's consider

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.990
some of the contexts in
which the idea/expression

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.670
distinction arises.

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.910
The first such context is
known as the merger doctrine.

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.970
Suppose there is only one
set of words that accurately

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.040
conveys a particular idea.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.720
In such a situation,
the principle

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.020
that ideas are unprotected and
the principle that expression

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.080
is protected clash.

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.690
Which prevails?

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.270
The principle that
ideas are unprotected.

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.430
So anyone else is free to use
that uniquely appropriate set

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.030
of words with impunity.

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.820
Such situations arise
more often than you

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.090
might think-particularly the
context of computer software.

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.270
But we will wait to take up
those illustrations until

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.160
lecture # 3, when we will
consider the various kinds

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.850
of works that copyright covers.

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.300
The second context is known as
the scenes-a-faire doctrine.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.950
The 1978 case of
Alexander versus Haley

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.810
provides a good illustration.

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.830
The basic facts of that
case were as follows:

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:30.200
prior to the publication
of Alex Haley's book Roots,

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.880
the plaintiff wrote
a similar book

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.680
about the history
of her own family

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.940
during slavery and about
her own gradual awakening

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.880
to the importance
of her heritage.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.415
When Roots was published
and became famous,

00:03:41.415 --> 00:03:43.540
the plaintiff brought a
copyright infringement suit

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:44.890
against Haley.

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.550
In support of her
claim, the plaintiff

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:50.170
provided a long list of
parallels between her book

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.260
and Roots, arguing that Haley
had copied heavily from her.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.630
The court eventually ruled
that, despite the large number

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.150
of similar scenes,
Haley had not engaged

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.740
in copyright infringement.

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.780
One of the grounds on
which the court rejected

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.380
many of the
plaintiffs assertions

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.550
is that they involved
so-called scenes-a-faire.

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:15.030
Here's the language in which the
court expresses this judgment:

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.430
"These are incidents,
characters or settings

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.620
which are as a practical matter
indispensable, or at least

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.070
standard, in the treatment
of a given topic.

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.260
Attempted escapes, flights
through the woods pursued

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.730
by baying dogs, the sorrowful
or happy singing of slaves,

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:34.090
the atrocity of the buying
and selling of human beings,

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.050
and other miseries are all
found in stories at least as old

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:39.910
as Mrs. Stowe's.

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:42.980
Other examples include
scenes portraying

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:46.040
sex between male slave
owners and female slaves

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.780
and the resentment of
the female slaveowners;

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.320
the sale of a slave child
away from her family

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.790
and the attendant agonies; the
horror of punitive mutilation;

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:58.780
and slave owners complaining
about the high price

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.440
of slaves."

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.210
All of these images,
the court ruled,

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.030
constituted unprotected
ideas, because they

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:10.595
were standard vignettes in the
genre of US slave narratives.

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.400
Some more recent, and
perhaps surprising,

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.260
applications of this
doctrine of scenes-a-faire

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.140
involve photography.

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:24.910
Here too, courts refuse to grant
copyright protection to images

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:27.490
that they conclude are
standard or typical

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.120
of a particular genre.

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.630
For example in the 2005 case
of Bill Diodata Photography

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:37.940
versus Kate Spade, the
plaintiff contended

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:41.120
that this photograph, which
appeared in an advertisement

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:46.640
for women shoes, was
infringed by this one.

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:50.170
The court rejected
the argument, arguing

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:52.410
that the positioning
of a model sitting

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:55.000
on the toilet with her
feet angled inward,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.070
though "seemingly unnatural,"
was a common trope;

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:03.960
photographing stylish women in
this pose to showcase fashion

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:10.820
accessories was an idea "used
often in popular culture."

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:14.310
Similarly, in the
2003 Gentiu case,

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:16.990
the photograph on the
right side of this slide

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:19.520
was held not to infringe the
copyright in the photograph

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:23.430
on the left side, because, even
if one photographer had been

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:26.800
imitating the other, the
compositional elements they had

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.530
in common were "standard
photographic conventions

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:33.455
or devices" and thus
not copyrightable.

00:06:35.869 --> 00:06:38.410
Here"s a more straightforward
application of the same general

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:39.510
principles.

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:42.780
Suppose I write and
publish a cookbook --

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:45.530
a collection of recipes
of a particular sort.

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:49.660
Suppose further that I created
some of those recipes myself.

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:52.220
You copy some of my
recipes and include them

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:53.450
in your own cookbook.

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:56.060
Have you engaged in
copyright infringement?

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:59.320
If the recipes that you copied
contain nothing more than

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.830
descriptions of
ingredients, quantities,

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:05.900
ways of combining things,
cooking times, and so forth --

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:09.090
in other words, instructions for
creating the dishes in question

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:11.480
-- then the answer is no.

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:14.410
The reason is that
unadorned recipes

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:18.520
are said to be ideas or
"methods of operation"

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:21.770
and thus not subject to
copyright protection.

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:26.020
By contrast, if the recipes
you copied included expressive

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:29.330
embellishments -- for example
descriptions of how the dishes

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:33.840
taste or suggestions concerning
social circumstances for which

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.530
they would be appropriate --
then you would be in trouble,

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:38.745
because such things are
considered expression.

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:46.120
Maps have been protected
by copyright law

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:47.490
for a very long time.

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:51.490
But not all components of maps
enjoy copyright protection.

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:55.010
For example, the location
of roads, mountains, rivers,

00:07:55.010 --> 00:07:58.740
and political boundaries; the
names of cities and towns;

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:02.110
are all excluded from
copyright protection.

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:04.990
Thus you can copy such things
from someone else's map

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:08.060
onto your own without
running afoul of the law.

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:11.840
This shouldn't be
terribly surprising.

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:15.160
More interesting is the fact
that newly coined place names

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:16.560
are not shielded.

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:19.530
Suppose, for
example, an explorer

00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:22.370
surveys a remote
mountain range, selects

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:25.210
names for the hitherto
nameless peaks,

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:28.560
and draws up a map that
includes those new names.

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:32.720
Another cartographer copies
those features and those names

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:34.250
into his own map.

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:36.220
Copyright infringement?

00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:37.510
No.

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:40.460
It's sometimes said that
the newly applied names,

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:43.000
although created
by the Explorer,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.790
become facts once applied
to features in the world.

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:48.640
But that can't be right.

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:51.150
By the same logic,
the text of my novel

00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:53.470
becomes a "fact"
once it's published,

00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:55.730
and I lose copyright
protection for it.

00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:59.340
A more plausible reason is
that to recognize copyright

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:02.660
protection for newly created
place names would frustrate

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:06.070
important public policies
-- concerning communication

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:09.070
of geographic information.

00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:11.310
Latent in that
rationale is the seed

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:13.060
of a much more general
principle that will

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:16.370
flower in subsequent lectures.

00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:20.430
So what aspects of maps do
enjoy copyright protection?

00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:23.230
The answer is original
selection, arrangement,

00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:27.550
or presentation of individually
unprotected elements.

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:31.500
The net effect is that entirely
conventional maps receive

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:33.590
no protection whatsoever.

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:36.660
Consider, for example,
this screenshot

00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:40.140
of a map created by Google of
the sector of Cambridge, Mass.,

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:42.930
that includes
Harvard University.

00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:46.260
If I copy it without
permission, as I

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.410
have done for the
purpose of this slide,

00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:50.540
have I engaged in
copyright infringement?

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:53.430
Probably not, because
it's difficult to locate

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:57.160
in the Google map any
unconventional selection

00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:58.410
or presentation element.

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:03.880
We come, finally, to the
tricky case of history.

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:06.960
Perhaps the most striking
effect of the idea/expression

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:09.580
distinction is the
limited legal protection

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:11.590
enjoyed by works of history.

00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:15.640
Suppose I spend years
investigating the life

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:18.550
of a little-known politician
-- and then write and publish

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:20.060
a biography of him.

00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:23.580
You read my book, and
then, relying on it,

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:27.750
quickly write your own biography
of the same politician.

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:31.030
You're a better writer than I
am, so your book sells better.

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:32.450
I'm angry.

00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:34.800
I point out that you could
not have written your book

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:38.000
without mine, and that
most of the story I told,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.290
and most of the arguments
I made, in my book

00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:41.910
can be found in yours.

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:45.350
Do I have a copyright
claim against you?

00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:48.660
If the things you lifted from
me consists of facts about

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:51.950
the life of the politician,
then the answer is no --

00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:55.370
no matter how much time and pain
it took me to ferret them out.

00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:58.370
This principle
governed the outcome

00:10:58.370 --> 00:11:00.930
of the litigation
between two historians,

00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:02.810
arising out of the
close similarity

00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:05.450
between 2 biographies
of the Rosenbergs,

00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:08.410
who were tried for
treason in 1953.

00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:10.550
Because all of
those similarities

00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:13.220
were deemed to involve
facts, the defendant

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:13.990
escaped liability.

00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:19.880
What if I included in my
biography some speculations,

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:22.530
and the same speculations
appear in yours?

00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:26.380
If I have represented my
speculations as facts,

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:28.820
then they too are unprotected.

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:33.300
The rule underlying this outcome
is known as copyright estoppel.

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:36.580
Having depicted an
assertion as a fact,

00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:40.480
I am said to be estopped from
subsequently re-characterizing

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:41.310
it.

00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:44.650
So, for example, in the Nash
case, the Court of Appeals

00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:46.700
ruled that the
plaintiff's contention

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:50.660
in his book the John Dillinger
had not been killed by the FBI

00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:54.550
at the Biograph Theater but
had lived on in California

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:57.110
was not protected by copyright,
because the plaintiff had

00:11:57.110 --> 00:12:01.420
offered that
contention as a fact.

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:03.930
What if you lift from
my biography, not

00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:07.350
a factual contention,
but an historical theory?

00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:10.500
Once again, I will lose,
but for a different reason:

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:13.340
historical theories
are considered ideas --

00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:15.150
and thus unprotected.

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:19.540
So for example in the Hoehling
case, the Court of Appeals held

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:21.690
unprotected the
plaintiff's assertion

00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:24.400
that the Hindenburg
dirigible had

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:26.170
been destroyed by a
member of its crew

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:30.190
in an effort to
discredit the Nazis.

00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:32.850
The bottom line is that
an historian should not

00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:35.780
expect to get much protection
from copyright law.

00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:41.320
If a second historian copies
significant hunks of her prose,

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:43.510
or closely tracks
original ways in which she

00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:46.970
has expressed arguments,
she will have a claim.

00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:50.580
But if, as in the usual
case, a second historian

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:54.140
free-rides on her research
and lifts facts or ideas

00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:56.280
from her books, she
has no recourse.

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:02.185
These examples surely do not
exhaust the various contexts

00:13:02.185 --> 00:13:04.560
in which the idea/expression
distinction has been applied

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:06.720
to limit the scope
of copyright --

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:09.960
but they should suffice to give
you an overall sense of the law

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:11.890
in this area.
