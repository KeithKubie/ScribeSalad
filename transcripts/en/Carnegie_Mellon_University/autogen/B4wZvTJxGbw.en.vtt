00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:09.580
 
so basically my research project

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:09.590
so basically my research project
 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:11.500
so basically my research project
explores the relationship between

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:11.510
explores the relationship between
 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.170
explores the relationship between
Victorian choreography which is the art

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:14.180
Victorian choreography which is the art
 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.470
Victorian choreography which is the art
of flower giving and biology and the way

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:17.480
of flower giving and biology and the way
 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.960
of flower giving and biology and the way
I did that was by constructing Victorian

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:19.970
I did that was by constructing Victorian
 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.019
I did that was by constructing Victorian
dresses from real flowers and pairing it

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:23.029
dresses from real flowers and pairing it
 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:25.359
dresses from real flowers and pairing it
with biological images of that same

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:25.369
with biological images of that same
 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.710
with biological images of that same
flower and basically my research cold

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:29.720
flower and basically my research cold
 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.900
flower and basically my research cold
from Victorian fashion to Victorian

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:31.910
from Victorian fashion to Victorian
 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.720
from Victorian fashion to Victorian
communication design as well as

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730
communication design as well as
 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.690
communication design as well as
choreographer which all played huge

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:37.700
choreographer which all played huge
 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.180
choreographer which all played huge
rolls in my project and it was both

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190
rolls in my project and it was both
 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.340
rolls in my project and it was both
creative and I and academic in the way

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350
creative and I and academic in the way
 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.440
creative and I and academic in the way
that I spent half my time in the studio

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:44.450
that I spent half my time in the studio
 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.050
that I spent half my time in the studio
and then I spent the other portion of my

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:47.060
and then I spent the other portion of my
 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:48.940
and then I spent the other portion of my
time in the lab everything the mines

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:48.950
time in the lab everything the mines
 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.400
time in the lab everything the mines
I'll have about 10 printed pieces and

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410
I'll have about 10 printed pieces and
 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.800
I'll have about 10 printed pieces and
then I'll have my book on display for

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:53.810
then I'll have my book on display for
 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:58.230
then I'll have my book on display for
people to read it's hardcover 134 pages

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:58.240
people to read it's hardcover 134 pages
 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.130
people to read it's hardcover 134 pages
it's entitled for feminist sukkah and

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140
it's entitled for feminist sukkah and
 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.469
it's entitled for feminist sukkah and
yeah I'm excited to to be able to

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479
yeah I'm excited to to be able to
 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:07.120
yeah I'm excited to to be able to
present my project chocolate people why

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130
present my project chocolate people why
 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.240
present my project chocolate people why
project and also for people to see it in

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250
project and also for people to see it in
 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.550
project and also for people to see it in
book form to be able to turn pages and

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560
book form to be able to turn pages and
 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.230
book form to be able to turn pages and
read a little bit about what I learned

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240
read a little bit about what I learned
 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.120
read a little bit about what I learned
probably the most important thing that

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130
probably the most important thing that
 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.050
probably the most important thing that
I've learned about this process is that

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060
I've learned about this process is that
 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.899
I've learned about this process is that
definitely when you're doing intensive

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909
definitely when you're doing intensive
 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:24.700
definitely when you're doing intensive
research you need time and you need

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710
research you need time and you need
 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.620
research you need time and you need
support from other people to do it which

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630
support from other people to do it which
 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.800
support from other people to do it which
is why I really appreciated the RA

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810
is why I really appreciated the RA
 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.930
is why I really appreciated the RA
office at Carnegie Mellon because they

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940
office at Carnegie Mellon because they
 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.880
office at Carnegie Mellon because they
gave me a year to be able to complete

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890
gave me a year to be able to complete
 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.310
gave me a year to be able to complete
this grant which I think I use all the

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320
this grant which I think I use all the
 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.060
this grant which I think I use all the
time they gave me to complete it and I

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070
time they gave me to complete it and I
 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.440
time they gave me to complete it and I
definitely learned how to manage time a

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450
definitely learned how to manage time a
 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.540
definitely learned how to manage time a
lot better too I think after the meeting

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550
lot better too I think after the meeting
 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:44.680
lot better too I think after the meeting
of the minds I'm definitely going to

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690
of the minds I'm definitely going to
 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.250
of the minds I'm definitely going to
continue to develop this technique and

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:47.260
continue to develop this technique and
 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.770
continue to develop this technique and
continue to do things of this nature

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780
continue to do things of this nature
 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.210
continue to do things of this nature
maybe even explore it as a potential

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220
maybe even explore it as a potential
 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.070
maybe even explore it as a potential
thing to explore more in graduate school

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080
thing to explore more in graduate school
 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.399
thing to explore more in graduate school
or other grants

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:56.409
or other grants
 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:58.919
or other grants
I think that I've started to unravel

00:01:58.919 --> 00:01:58.929
I think that I've started to unravel
 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:00.539
I think that I've started to unravel
something but I haven't completely

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:00.549
something but I haven't completely
 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:02.760
something but I haven't completely
unraveled it so I'd love to gain more

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770
unraveled it so I'd love to gain more
 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.960
unraveled it so I'd love to gain more
exposure in this specific topic
