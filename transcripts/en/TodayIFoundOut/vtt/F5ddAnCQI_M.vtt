00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:16.510
Does hand and foot size really correlate with
penile length

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.910
Given that public nudity is generally considered
unacceptable in most of the modern world (and

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.810
if you’re wondering, see: When Did Humans
Start Wearing Clothes?), people have long

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.660
tried to come up with other potential indicators
to determine the size of a guy’s manhood

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.440
without actually seeing it.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.449
A seemingly tried and true method for doing
just this is to look at the size of the man’s

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:39.749
hands and/or feet.

00:00:39.749 --> 00:00:45.960
But does hand and foot size really correlate
to the length of the penis?

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.469
Nope.

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:51.579
Studies have consistently shown that the size
of a guy’s feet or the overall size of their

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:55.360
hands is not related to their member’s erect
measurement.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.399
However, a man’s fingers do give a strong
clue as to their probable penis size- but

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:03.600
the overall length of the fingers is not what’s
important here.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.270
For instance, a study published in the Asian
Journal of Andrology in 2011 found that the

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.659
ratio between the 2nd and 4th digits on the
hands strongly correlates with the overall

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:16.490
length of an individual’s penis.

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.299
Specifically, Dr. Ho Choi and et al. state;

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:24.310
Univariate and multivariate analysis using
linear regression models showed that…. only

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:29.120
digit ratio was a significant predictive factor
for stretched penile length…

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.390
fingers2In a nutshell, the lower the ratio-
how much shorter the index finger is than

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.920
the ring finger- the longer the penis will
probably be when erect.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.320
(And if you’re wondering, flaccid penis
length is not an accurate predictor of erect

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.320
penis length.)

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.410
More specifically, you can calculate your
ratio by taking the length of your index finger

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.641
(measured from the crease where it meets your
hand, to the tip) and divide it by the length

00:01:50.641 --> 00:01:52.010
of your ring finger.

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:56.079
The shorter your index finger is compared
to the ring finger, the lower the ratio will

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:00.679
be and, if you’re a man, the longer your
penis probably is.

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:08.610
So why does the ratio of the index and ring
finger lengths correlate to erect penis length?

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.580
In the beginning, female and male genitals
are pretty much the same.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.600
This is because they develop from the same
cluster of tissues (gonads).

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:23.030
In males, somewhere around weeks 7-9 of gestation,
the gonads begin secreting two hormones- Anti-müllerian

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.660
hormone (AMH) and testosterone.

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.440
AMH prevents the development of the ducts
that eventually turn into the fallopian tubes,

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.520
the uterus, and upper vagina.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.600
Once the gonads begin secreting testosterone,
some if it (around 5-10%) gets transformed

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.390
into another hormone called dihydrotestosterone.

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.810
Both testosterone and dihydrotestosterone
will attach to androgen receptors, which affect

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.620
the growth and development of many different
body systems.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.850
Notable here, dihydrotestosterone attaches
to androgen receptors on tissues that eventually

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.680
develop and combine into the penis and scrotum.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.230
Low levels of this within the womb, or later
during puberty, may result in an underdeveloped

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:03.750
or malformed penis.

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:09.190
So to sum up here, penile growth in the womb
is stimulated and affected by testosterone,

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.450
dihydrotestosterone, and androgen receptors.

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.940
Circulating amounts of the two hormones, combined
with the associated androgen receptor stimulation,

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.660
will determine penis size.

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.370
So what about fingers?

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.470
Circulating testosterone in the womb will
affect other body parts as well- pertinent

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:31.120
to the topic at hand, including the ratio
between the 2nd and 4th digits (index and

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.160
ring fingers).

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.130
Why does testosterone affect digits differently?

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.890
For that, I’ll have to get a little more
technical, but essentially the activity mediated

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:45.270
by androgen receptors, and estrogen receptor-a,
is higher in your ring finger compared to

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:46.840
your index finger.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.330
This is regulated by the structure of genes
controlling the process for the bone growth

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.920
of your fingers, called endochondral ossification.

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.690
The spread of chondrocytes will determine
the length of your finger, and this expansion

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.280
is higher in the ring finger compared to the
index finger.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.450
When you decrease the activation of androgen
receptors during the narrow window of digit

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.850
development (usually completed by week 13
of gestation), you will decrease the length

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:12.380
of your ring finger.

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:17.109
This activation is attributed to amount of
testosterone and DHT circulating throughout

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:18.300
the tiny fetus.

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:23.730
Conversely, if you decrease the activity of
the receptor estrogen-a (the ones being stimulated

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:27.570
more when you’re female), you will get a
longer ring finger.

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.280
Based on this physiology, it has been long
known that you can predict prenatal hormone

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.590
exposure based on the ratio of these two fingers.

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:39.240
Since both penile length and the ratio of
the ring and index finger is basically a result

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:45.260
of the amount of testosterone and DHT circulating
in utero, there is a correlation between that

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.170
ratio and the length of a man’s favorite
appendage.

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:52.630
As you might have guessed from all this, the
ratio between the lengths of one’s index

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:57.260
and ring fingers is usually quite different
in men and women- men tend to have shorter

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:01.410
index fingers than ring fingers; women tend
to have their index fingers either the same

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.450
length or longer than their ring fingers.

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:09.170
Penile length isn’t the only thing digit
ratio can predict.

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:14.740
Since testosterone and DHT control the development
of several body systems and processes, digit

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.340
ratio can be a predictor of a wide range of
physiological and psychological conditions.

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:23.870
These include things like athletic ability,
sexual orientation, fertility, and some sex

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:27.250
based ailments such as prostate and uterine
problems.

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:31.370
Lower digit ratios tend to occur in people
with more aggressive behaviors, and those

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.470
with them are less likely to suffer from eating
disorders.

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:36.810
People with higher digit ratios tend to be
more agreeable.

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:41.530
Research has also indicated that straight
women and gay men who have higher ratios tend

00:05:41.530 --> 00:06:26.000
to prefer partners who are more masculine.
