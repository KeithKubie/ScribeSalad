00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:03.240
So right here, we have
a four-sided figure,

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.530
or a quadrilateral,
where two of the sides

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:08.520
are parallel to each other.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.636
And so this, by
definition, is a trapezoid.

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:16.570
And what we want to do
is, given the dimensions

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.630
that they've given us, what
is the area of this trapezoid.

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.660
So let's just think through it.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.250
So what would we get if we
multiplied this long base

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.670
6 times the height 3?

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.750
So what do we get if
we multiply 6 times 3?

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.900
Well, that would be the
area of a rectangle that

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.790
is 6 units wide
and 3 units high.

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.530
So that would give us
the area of a figure that

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.980
looked like-- let me do
it in this pink color.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.940
The area of a figure that looked
like this would be 6 times 3.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.790
So it would give us this
entire area right over there.

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.760
Now, the trapezoid is
clearly less than that,

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.770
but let's just go with
the thought experiment.

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.980
Now, what would happen if
we went with 2 times 3?

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.910
Well, now we'd be finding
the area of a rectangle that

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:10.260
has a width of 2
and a height of 3.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.810
So you could imagine that being
this rectangle right over here.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.240
So that is this rectangle
right over here.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.130
So that's the 2
times 3 rectangle.

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.160
Now, it looks like the
area of the trapezoid

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.910
should be in between
these two numbers.

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.490
Maybe it should be exactly
halfway in between,

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.050
because when you look at the
area difference between the two

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.240
rectangles-- and let
me color that in.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.030
So this is the area difference
on the left-hand side.

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.980
And this is the area difference
on the right-hand side.

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.090
If we focus on
the trapezoid, you

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.480
see that if we start with the
yellow, the smaller rectangle,

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.610
it reclaims half
of the area, half

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.030
of the difference between
the smaller rectangle

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.240
and the larger one on
the left-hand side.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.920
It gets exactly half of
it on the left-hand side.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.050
And it gets half the
difference between the smaller

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.290
and the larger on
the right-hand side.

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.260
So it completely makes
sense that the area

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.420
of the trapezoid, this
entire area right over here,

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.310
should really just
be the average.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.420
It should exactly be
halfway between the areas

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.172
of the smaller rectangle
and the larger rectangle.

00:02:28.172 --> 00:02:30.130
So let's take the average
of those two numbers.

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:38.160
It's going to be 6 times 3 plus
2 times 3, all of that over 2.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.230
So when you think about
an area of a trapezoid,

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.940
you look at the two bases, the
long base and the short base.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.410
Multiply each of those times
the height, and then you

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:51.720
could take the average of them.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.680
Or you could also
think of it as this

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.440
is the same thing as 6 plus 2.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.490
And I'm just factoring
out a 3 here.

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:12.760
6 plus 2 times 3, and
then all of that over 2,

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.274
which is the same
thing as-- and I'm

00:03:14.274 --> 00:03:15.690
just writing it
in different ways.

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.690
These are all different
ways to think about it--

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:25.450
6 plus 2 over 2, and
then that times 3.

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.820
So you could view
it as the average

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.560
of the smaller and
larger rectangle.

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.790
So you multiply each of
the bases times the height

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.180
and then take the average.

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.540
You could view it as-- well,
let's just add up the two base

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.360
lengths, multiply that times the
height, and then divide by 2.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.710
Or you could say, hey, let's
take the average of the two

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:46.481
base lengths and
multiply that by 3.

00:03:46.481 --> 00:03:48.230
And that gives you
another interesting way

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:48.980
to think about it.

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.850
If you take the average of these
two lengths, 6 plus 2 over 2

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:54.660
is 4.

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.770
So that would be a width
that looks something

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:59.690
like-- let me do this in orange.

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.080
A width of 4 would look
something like this.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.000
A width of 4 would look
something like that,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.050
and you're multiplying
that times the height.

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:11.440
Well, that would be a rectangle
like this that is exactly

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.190
halfway in between
the areas of the small

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.089
and the large rectangle.

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:18.420
So these are all
equivalent statements.

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.010
Now let's actually
just calculate it.

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.176
So we could do any of these.

00:04:21.176 --> 00:04:24.120
6 times 3 is 18.

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.630
This is 18 plus 6, over 2.

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.501
That is 24/2, or 12.

00:04:31.501 --> 00:04:32.750
You could also do it this way.

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:38.090
6 plus 2 is 8, times 3 is
24, divided by 2 is 12.

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.430
6 plus 2 divided by 2
is 4, times 3 is 12.

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:47.600
Either way, the area of this
trapezoid is 12 square units.
