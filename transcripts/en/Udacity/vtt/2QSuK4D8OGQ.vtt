00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.678
So, here's a question for you. Say, you render an image by the extreme of

00:00:03.678 --> 00:00:07.176
finding what object is visible at each pixel and finding how light effects just

00:00:07.176 --> 00:00:10.621
that surface, which of the following objects can be rendered with this simple

00:00:10.621 --> 00:00:15.498
system? Here's a hint, exactly two answers are correct. So, could you make the

00:00:15.498 --> 00:00:20.742
object polished metal surface reflecting everything around it, unpolished wood

00:00:20.742 --> 00:00:25.378
showing a grain, a light bulb, or an object made of glass reflecting light

00:00:25.378 --> 00:00:29.620
through it? Here are your four materials. Pick two that could be made with this

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:30.719
simple rendering system.
