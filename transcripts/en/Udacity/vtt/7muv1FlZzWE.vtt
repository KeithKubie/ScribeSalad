00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.540
The intoxicating effects of alcohol are a

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:05.310
combination of the genes that influence pharmacokinetics,

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.430
or the metabolism of. And the pharmacodynamics,

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.700
the target effects of alcohol. Although, alcohol dehydrogenase

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.100
is important in the first step of

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.440
alcohol metabolism. The second step, the conversion of

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.430
acetaldehyde to acetic acid by the enzyme

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.410
acetaldehyde dehydrogenase two, is actually the slowest step.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.500
As the ethanol is broken down by ADH into acetaldehyde, more and more of

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.800
the acetaldehyde saturates the ALDH2 enzyme. It

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.637
gets busy. Its trying to actually metabolize

00:00:37.637 --> 00:00:42.820
all of this acetaldehyde that's building up. But now, it's saturated. And the

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:50.440
bad news is that acetaldehyde is about ten to 30 times more toxic than alcohol.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.910
Alcohol is intoxicating, and has the effects we've

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.070
talked about so far. But it can also

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.090
be bad for your body, if you have too much of it. But acetaldehyde is the really

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:07.156
bad stuff. In fact, the effects of alcohol flush reaction are due significantly

00:01:07.156 --> 00:01:12.530
to the build-up of acetaldehyde rather than any build-up in alcohol. So

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.320
let's say you had reduced activity of ALDH2. Would

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.160
you expect your alcohol flush reaction to be more severe or less severe?
