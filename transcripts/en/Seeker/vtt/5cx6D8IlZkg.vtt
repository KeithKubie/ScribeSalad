00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.750
Work-life balance. Something I suck at. Actually,
something many of us suck at. I'll have to

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.219
work late figuring out how many of us suck
at it. Hmm. Maybe have to work through lunch

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:18.430
too.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.390
When people ask what I do, I answer work.
Then they ask "How's work," and I say, "Busy.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.980
I work a lot." That's bad, you guys. Really
bad. I get stressed and my productivity drops.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.619
People get burned out… they show up but
they don't try. All because they don't know

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.250
when to be working and when to be NOT working.
This is work-life balance. And pretty much

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.750
anyone who works struggles with it. Whether
your collar is blue, white, green, pink or

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:47.000
just a hoodie; work-life balance is important.
And yet, according to a study by the American

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.289
Sociological Review, 70 percent of American
workers struggle with this balance. Worldwide,

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.120
according to a survey by EY, one-third of
people have trouble managing their balance.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.070
Work-life balance is important, because the
consequences of its dismissal is a big ol'

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.640
dose of our lovely friend: STRESS.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.920
People who lack work-life balance, have higher
levels of stress. Period. And stress is real

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.820
bad, as we all know. In a national work survey
on work-life balance and stress, 89 percent

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.740
of the stress in Canadian's lives was due
to work, and that stress led to both mental

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.830
and physical health problems for many. For
example, busy people can become lonely in

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.079
their work, and loneliness (like stress) compounds
the problems. The Global Benefits Attitudes

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:36.159
study looked at workers in 12 countries and
found: stressed-out workers have higher levels

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:42.040
of absenteeism, and disengagement than those
with low stress; which makes sense because

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.689
physical and mental stresses reduce immune
response and open the body to hypertension,

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:48.960
which can further decrease productivity.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.740
And this affects parental couples even more!

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:58.009
80 percent of Millennials have a working spouse,
compared to 73 percent of GenX and only 47

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:03.170
percent of Baby Boomers. A study in the International
journal of leadership studies found women

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.340
bear more of the traditional family roles
and have more difficulty with work-family

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.680
balance; though both spouses feel that stress.
On top of that, when both spouses work, and

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.560
one falls sick, the other must often take
sick days too, so the family is cared for.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:24.750
Overall, people with no work-life balance
took 1.8 times the sick days of low-stress

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:25.750
workers.

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:31.860
The thing is, it's an easy fix. Companies
and people just have to recognize sometimes

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.970
you SHOULDN'T be working. In the words of
a 1983's Valley Girl, we all need to "get

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.410
a life." Germany, Netherlands, Belgium and
France have productivity at or above the United

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:48.120
States, all while the EU mandates laws promoting
work-life balance like mandated family leave,

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.720
vacations, and other worker protections. I
don't think anyone can accuse Germans of being

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:58.239
stereotypically lazy, and yet for some reason,
the implication of work-life balance as a

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:03.030
goal strikes Americans as not wanting to work
hard. But, adopting work-life balance doesn't

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:08.040
mean you have to stop caring about your job,
phone it in, or not work hard. But instead,

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.959
according to professionals who've achieved
it: have clear boundaries and focused goals!

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:17.860
Having goals at work, and understanding how
to achieve those, helps, but also know when

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.769
to stop working. STOPPING working (even for
five minutes) can actually help you be more

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:27.319
productive when you pick it up again. According
to Harvard Business Review, businesses that

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:31.980
increase work-life balance initiatives see
greater productivity, and a less-stressed

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:37.700
workforce. Leaving work to take a break, listening
to music, and even being honest with your

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:44.379
co-workers increases the balance, but also
WORKING when at WORK helps us divide our day

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:51.069
into work time and personal time. At-work
procrastination screws us, because we feel

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:55.980
bad about the wasted time; so stay away from
your phone, and social media. Don't forget

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.500
to have hobbies and out-of-work interests
, because it helps us decompress from work;

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.590
and set aside time for family and friends
too. A strong network of people supporting

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:10.700
us helps keep us from being lonely, decreases
our stress, and helps us advanced social primates

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:11.700
chill out.

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:16.650
The key is, according to the literature, to
do what's right for YOU. The 2007 Nobel Laureate

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.290
in Medicine Oliver Smithies is married to
another scientist and believes this too. He

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.330
says it's okay to work late long as you're
on the same wavelength as your spouse. "Find

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.360
a partner who understands what you're going
to do... and do your share in making the family

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.360
work."

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.540
If you're going to get out of the office,
the new Toyota Tacoma might be for you. The

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:38.110
Tacoma encourages you to break the rules,
and PLAY NOW. After a ten-year wait, the all-new

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.370
Tacoma is finally here. It’s been fully
redesigned to play whenever and wherever you

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:43.370
want.

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:44.370
Do you work too much?

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:45.370
Do you work too little?

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.479
Tell me about it in the comments. I work too
much. For sure. But I love my job, because

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:50.090
y'all are here.
