00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:06.070
Well, it's important because
it's knowledge, the knowledge

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:08.010
of numbers.

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.900
The algebraic numbers are the
ones that we're the most

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.760
familiar with.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.850
But in a sense, there's hardly
any of them compared to

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.620
transcendental numbers.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.040
Algebraic numbers are actually
countable, or listable is

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.340
another way of saying it.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.910
So it's actually quite
a small infinity.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.620
It's the smallest infinity.

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.990
But on the real number line,
you've got a bigger infinite.

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.630
It just so happens that most
of the numbers on the real

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.410
number line are transcendental.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.260
And we didn't know that
until we discovered

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.020
transcendental numbers.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.300
So this is really recent
information in terms of the

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.570
long history of maths that
humanity's been covering over

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.260
2,000 years.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.960
This is a new fact.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.380
And what this meant, the
transcendence of pi--

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.140
I like that, the transcendence
of pi--

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.040
actually answered some really
interesting questions.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.730
There were some really old
questions that the Greeks had

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:09.300
about squaring the circle, so
how can you make a circle of a

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.210
particular area, turn
that into a square.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.200
And there was lots of ways that
they tried to do it with

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.950
straight edge and compass.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.080
But all those things, every
attempt they do, actually ends

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.500
up being an algebraic
equation, right?

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.500
So they were saying how
can we turn pi-- so pi

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:27.410
is linked in there.

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.430
How can we turn pi into another

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:31.640
thing by using algebra?

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.830
Well, it just shows that
you can't because it's

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:35.770
transcendental.

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.480
There's something really
tricky going on.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.050
And that's why I like it,
because the tricky stuff is

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:43.930
where all the awesome
maths is.

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.330
Well, the thing is, with pi,
pi is about perfection.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.900
And there are no perfect circles
in our universe.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:52.650
None.

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.420
So you don't need pi per se.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:03.240
You can get by with 3.14, or
29 digits to do the biggest

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.060
theoretical ring around
the universe or

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.010
something like that.

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.220
And anything that truncates,
like any decimal that ends, is

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.250
a fraction because it's just
that number divided by 1 with

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.730
how many zeroes.

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.120
And so dealing with fractions,
fractions, we know how to deal

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.300
with fractions.

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.520
There's a difference between
dealing with big numbers and

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.870
dealing with these very
strange numbers.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.410
But see, this stuff is just
to do with maths.

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.480
But just to show you the power
of it, the construction of,

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.070
say, Euler's identity, this
thing is all hanging together

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.590
with infinitely sharp
perfection.

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.590
It's not a number near e
or a number near pi.

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.870
These are the numbers,
and there is a

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.080
specific value for that.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.705
So it's really, really
important we get

00:02:48.705 --> 00:02:50.050
these things right.

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.800
In maths, perfection
is important.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.500
But then, anyone who uses maths
for physics or chemistry

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.320
or whatever you want to do,
then they can kind of use

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.150
approximations.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.560
I'm not interested in
approximations.
