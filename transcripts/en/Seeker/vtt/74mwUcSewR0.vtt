00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.860
The Nobel Prize committee gives awards to
those who provide - “the Greatest Benefit

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:07.980
to Mankind” and a handful of dedicated scientists
make the cut every year.

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.130
This year’s winners tinkered with evolution
in the lab, developed therapeutics that fight

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:17.040
cancer and created lasers so powerful that
they can peek inside an atom.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.390
They’re investigating science at the micron
level, and their groundbreaking discoveries

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.490
are completely changing the way we look at
our own world.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.501
There are three major science categories for
the Nobel Prizes*; medicine, chemistry, and

00:00:28.501 --> 00:00:29.501
physics.

00:00:29.501 --> 00:00:33.460
And the Nobel Prize in medicine was awarded
for breakthroughs in immunotherapy.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.500
James Allison and Tasuku Honjo developed research
that led to the rise of new immunotherapy

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.500
drugs.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.780
See, our immune system has specialized cells,
called t-cells, that attack any foreign invaders,

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.409
like viruses or bacteria.

00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:49.949
Think of them like your system's bodyguard,
they're looking out for any enemies in your

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:50.949
midst.

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:55.280
But that’s the thing with cancer, your own
cells are the enemy,so the t-cells don’t

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.429
know to fight them off.

00:00:56.429 --> 00:01:02.059
So Allison and Honjo found a way to tweak
the t-cells by blocking two specific receptors;

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:04.430
CTLA-4 and PD-1.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.390
This helped activate the immune system to
go after cancer cells.

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.460
Human trials started in the 2010’s and they’ve
been effective against a whole host of cancers.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.130
Next up, Chemistry.

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.770
Frances Arnold, George Smith, and Sir Gregory
Winter split the Nobel Prize for their respective

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.689
work on directing evolution of enzymes and
antibodies.

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.580
You see, enzymes are the workhorse of the
cell.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.039
They’re biomolecules with distinct jobs
that help us live, like synthesizing our nutrients

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:30.049
into energy.

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:34.929
Arnold’s research used enzymes’ natural
ability to adapt and mutate, and she mutated

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:38.719
them to the point where they would perform
even better than nature intended.

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:42.710
This was used by other scientists for years
and goes beyond medicinal practices.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:48.539
For instance, she converted sugars to alcohol
for biofuels, which could help pave the path

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:50.439
for fewer fuel emissions.

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:54.960
Smith discovered something called phage display,
a method of hacking bacteriophages, which

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.530
are viruses that infect bacteria, to create
new proteins.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.649
And then Winter used this technique to direct
the evolution of antibodies, leading to new

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:06.299
therapies to treat diseases like rheumatoid
arthritis.

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.750
And finally Physics, let’s roll in the lasers.

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.750
This prize was split among Arthur Ashkin who
developed “optical tweezers” and Gérard

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.950
Mourou and Donna Strickland who won “for
their method of generating high-intensity,

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.210
ultra-short optical pulses.”

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:23.080
Ashkin’s “optical tweezers” started
off with the idea that focused laser beams

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.810
have concentrated photons in the center and,
by placing two beams near each other, they

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.970
can create a “radiative” pressure on small
objects.

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.670
This causes objects to be trapped between
two lasers like a tractor beam out of movie.

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.530
This is useful for scientists who want to
trap tiny things, like cells and atoms.

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.820
Now Strickland and Morou creating controllable,
ultra-sharp laser beams.

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:48.020
Back in the 1980’s, instruments weren’t
equipped to handle super powerful lasers yet,

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.480
but Strickland and Morou found that if they
stretched out the laser pulses, it would reduce

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.880
its peak power enough.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.120
The laser then could be compressed into the
ultrashort high-intensity pulses they wanted,

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.090
allowing us to look inside individual atoms!

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.780
This laser tool is used for semiconductors,
medical stents, and in corrective eye surgeries.

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.040
So there are immeasurable applications to
what these nobel winners have created.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.200
Each one of them has made a technique or tool
that’s revised our view of the microscopic

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.620
world that we’re only still learning about.

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.900
They’ve laid important foundations in science
that are only extending our frontiers of knowledge

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.990
about the bigger world around us.

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:24.130

is too vague of a standard for you, check

out this detailed video on what else you need
to win a Nobel Prize.

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:39.030
Although Nobel Prizes have been awarded for
to 923 people, only 48 of them have been women

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.960
and Donna Strickland marks the 3rd woman ever
to win a Nobel Prize in Physics.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:43.960
You go Donna.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:44.430
