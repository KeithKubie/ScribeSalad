bad news sells and in fact I recently
heard someone basically say that the

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500
heard someone basically say that the
 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.290
heard someone basically say that the
only way to get attention to education

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300
only way to get attention to education
 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.799
only way to get attention to education
is through bad news and that may be part

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809
is through bad news and that may be part
 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.730
is through bad news and that may be part
of the problem we do score our kids do

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740
of the problem we do score our kids do
 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.880
of the problem we do score our kids do
score less well than some kids in other

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890
score less well than some kids in other
 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.310
score less well than some kids in other
countries and that's not new so there's

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320
countries and that's not new so there's
 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.250
countries and that's not new so there's
apparently there's a long-standing and

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260
apparently there's a long-standing and
 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.990
apparently there's a long-standing and
fairly stable difference in performance

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000
fairly stable difference in performance
 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.049
fairly stable difference in performance
in mathematics between our kids and the

that's fairly stable what you get when

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969
that's fairly stable what you get when
 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.279
that's fairly stable what you get when
you compare us to countries that are

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289
you compare us to countries that are
 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.319
you compare us to countries that are
more similar to us Australia and New

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329

Germany is a little less clear because

the results are not consistent from one

test to another one test puts us pretty

test to another one test puts us pretty
 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.849

much in the same league as countries

in mathematics I think it's we don't

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510
in mathematics I think it's we don't
 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.969

know because the tests aren't designed

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979

to allow us to sort this out very well

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659
to allow us to sort this out very well
 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.120
to allow us to sort this out very well
but it appears that it's because the

tests measure different things the tests

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640
tests measure different things the tests

that measure what's taught in school put

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979

us higher up relative to those countries

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780
us higher up relative to those countries

measures application to more realistic

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520

problems shows us falling a little

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689
problems shows us falling a little
 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:37.760
problems shows us falling a little
further behind
