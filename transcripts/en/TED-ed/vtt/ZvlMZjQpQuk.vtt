It's really funny,

00:00:06.258 --> 00:00:08.137
we're starting to see

00:00:08.137 --> 00:00:09.701
so many more titles coming in

00:00:09.701 --> 00:00:11.736
that are "Creative Director"

00:00:11.736 --> 00:00:16.481
or "Director of Innovation,"

00:00:16.481 --> 00:00:18.937
and I feel like our generation

00:00:18.937 --> 00:00:21.214
is going to, kind of, see past that

00:00:21.214 --> 00:00:23.800
and understand that every single employee

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.064
needs to have creativity

00:00:26.064 --> 00:00:28.345
in everything that they do everyday,

00:00:28.345 --> 00:00:30.230
that's this element of our work

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.017
that's been lost over the past 20 years,

00:00:32.017 --> 00:00:35.093
and I think it's going to get integrated back in.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.164
I don't know how to say this any other way,

00:00:39.164 --> 00:00:42.505
but I hope every company around the world

00:00:42.505 --> 00:00:44.296
gets rid of their HR departments

00:00:44.296 --> 00:00:47.582
because it ruins communication, and

00:00:47.582 --> 00:00:49.503
I'll start over and I'll try to think of an actual job,

00:00:49.503 --> 00:00:50.737
but maybe you guys can help me.

00:00:50.737 --> 00:00:54.259
What's a job that's like anti-HR?

00:00:54.259 --> 00:00:57.613
Is there a job that's like anti-HR?

00:00:57.613 --> 00:01:01.757
Ah, I don't know,

00:01:01.757 --> 00:01:03.199
like master chopper,

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:04.573
like guillotine guy,

00:01:04.573 --> 00:01:06.564
like "And you're done, like, leave."

00:01:06.564 --> 00:01:09.275
I don't know of the anti-HR job.

00:01:14.551 --> 00:01:16.242
Probably the easiest answer would be

00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:18.473
the jack-of-all-trades guy.

00:01:18.473 --> 00:01:20.866
Every company sort of has someone

00:01:20.866 --> 00:01:23.039
in their company that they go to

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:26.420
for matters that there is no title for,

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.286
whether it's, "I have a communication issue,"

00:01:29.286 --> 00:01:33.022
or "I don't like the project I'm on right now."

00:01:33.022 --> 00:01:36.954
And I feel like that sort of jack-of-all-trades job

00:01:36.954 --> 00:01:38.851
has yet to really define itself,

00:01:38.851 --> 00:01:39.781
but it will,

00:01:39.781 --> 00:01:42.279
and when we know it, we'll see it.
