00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.690
So if you've gotten this far,
you've been waiting for

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:08.730
several videos to get to the
optimal line that minimizes

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.500
the squared distance to
all of those points.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.930
So let's just get to
the punch line.

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:14.240
Let's solve for the
optimal m and b.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.190
And just based on what we did
in the last videos, there's

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:16.850
two ways to do that.

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.180
We actually now know two points
that lie on that line.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.780
So we can literally find the
slope of that line and then

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:23.700
the the y intercept,
the b there.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.230
Or, we could just say
it's the solution to

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.200
this system of equations.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.140
And they're actually
mathematically equivalent.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.230
So let's solve for m first. And
if we want to solve for m,

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.830
we want to cancel out the b's.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:34.810
So let me rewrite this top
equation just the way it's

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.440
written over here.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:42.690
We have m times the mean of the
x squareds plus b times

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.570
the mean of-- Actually,
we could even do

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.160
it better than that.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.990
One step better than that is to,
based on the work we did

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.860
in the last video, we can just
subtract this bottom equation

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.530
from this top equation.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:58.570
So let me subtract it.

00:00:58.570 --> 00:00:59.590
Or let's add the negatives.

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.030
So if I make this negative,
this is negative.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.060
This is negative.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.980
What do we get?

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:12.630
We get m times the mean of the
x's minus the mean of the x

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.730
squareds over the mean of x.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.760
The plus b and the negative
b cancel out.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:27.960
Is equal to the mean of the y's
minus the mean of the xy's

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.780
over the mean of the x's.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.860
And then, we can divide both
sides of the equation by this.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:43.620
And so we get m is equal to the
mean of the y's minus the

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:49.720
mean of the xy's over the mean
of the x's over this.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.600
The mean of the x's minus the
mean of the x squareds over

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.150
the mean of the x's.

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.220
Now notice, this is the exact
same thing that you would get

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.760
if you found the slope between
these two points over here.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.380
Change in y, so the difference
between that y and that y, is

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.640
that right over there.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.030
Over the change in x's.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.660
The change in that
x minus that x is

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.160
exactly this over here.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.550
Now, to simplify it, we can
multiply both the numerator

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.620
and the denominator by
the mean of the x's.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.370
And I do that just so we don't
have this in the denominator

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:21.580
both places.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.840
So if we multiply the numerator
by the mean of the

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:31.030
x's, we get the mean of the x's
times the mean of the y's

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.280
minus, this and this will
cancel out, minus

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.040
the mean of the xy's.

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.400
All of that over, mean of the
x's times the mean of the x's

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:52.170
is just going to be the mean of
the x's squared, minus over

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.290
here you have the mean
of the x squared.

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.010
And that's what we get for m.

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.890
And if we want to solve for
b, we literally can just

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.990
substitute back into either
equation, but this equation

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:12.790
right here is simpler.

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.115
And so if we wanted to solve for
b there, we can solve for

00:03:16.115 --> 00:03:17.510
b in terms of m.

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.910
We just subtract m times the
mean of x's from both sides.

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:30.320
We get b is equal to the mean
of the y's minus m times the

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:31.730
mean of the x's.

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.860
So what you do is you take
your data point.

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.440
You find the mean of the x's,
the mean of the y's , the mean

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.370
of the xy's, the mean
of the x's squared.

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:41.730
You find your m.

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.520
Once you find your m, then you
can substitute back in here

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.790
and you find your b.

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.130
And then you have your
actual optimal line.

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.800
And we're done.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.100
So these are the two big formula
take aways for our

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.690
optimal line.

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.130
What I'm going to do in the next
video, and this is where

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.730
if anyone wasn't skipping up to
this point, the next video

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.360
is where they should re-engage,
because we're

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.420
actually going to use these
formulas for the

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:07.440
best fitting line.

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.440
At least, when you measure the
error by the squared distances

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.620
from the points.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.930
We're going to use these
formulas to actually find the

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.780
best line for some data.
