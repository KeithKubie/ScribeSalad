is still a fair amount of comedy in my

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.040
is still a fair amount of comedy in my
 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.920
is still a fair amount of comedy in my
opinion is the choices that these

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930
opinion is the choices that these
 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.350
opinion is the choices that these
characters make because they are just so

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360

of the smut uh it is in there in my
 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.540
of the smut uh it is in there in my
opinion the more erotic stuff was early

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550
opinion the more erotic stuff was early
 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:11.980
opinion the more erotic stuff was early
on and when it got more into like the

on and when it got more into like the
 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.890
on and when it got more into like the
BDSM stuff it got less erotic and I

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:14.900
BDSM stuff it got less erotic and I
 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.680
BDSM stuff it got less erotic and I
think part of that is because in a

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:17.690
think part of that is because in a
 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.020
think part of that is because in a
strange way in the book

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.030
strange way in the book
 

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:21.909

movie but but again because I think
they're trying to make a good film

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:49.880
they're trying to make a good film
 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.480
they're trying to make a good film
they're trying to add some credibility

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:51.490
they're trying to add some credibility
 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:54.400
they're trying to add some credibility
because the character constantly says

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:54.410
because the character constantly says
 

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:56.050
because the character constantly says
she doesn't want to do it yet constantly

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:56.060
she doesn't want to do it yet constantly
 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.150
she doesn't want to do it yet constantly
does it so I think they're trying to

00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:58.160
does it so I think they're trying to
 

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.520
does it so I think they're trying to
make it look like at least what I got is

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:00.530
make it look like at least what I got is
 

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:03.640
make it look like at least what I got is
yeah I guess it's okay but I still have

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:03.650
yeah I guess it's okay but I still have
 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:05.590
yeah I guess it's okay but I still have
major concerns about this and I'm doing

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:05.600
major concerns about this and I'm doing
 

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.960
major concerns about this and I'm doing
more because hey I kind of like him I

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:07.970
more because hey I kind of like him I
 

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:10.270
more because hey I kind of like him I
never got the feeling like really either

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:10.280
never got the feeling like really either
 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:12.340
never got the feeling like really either
than we're like into it

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:12.350
than we're like into it
 

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:13.810
than we're like into it
like the early stuff when they're just

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:13.820
like the early stuff when they're just
 

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:15.340
like the early stuff when they're just
now each other and just doing the

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:15.350
now each other and just doing the
 

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:18.130
now each other and just doing the
regular sex I I felt much more there

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:18.140
regular sex I I felt much more there
 

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:20.170
regular sex I I felt much more there
than when they got into the BDSM stuff

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:20.180
than when they got into the BDSM stuff
 

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:21.909
than when they got into the BDSM stuff
but it's cuz I don't think they knew how

00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:21.919
but it's cuz I don't think they knew how
 

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:23.360
but it's cuz I don't think they knew how
really to

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:23.370
really to
 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:25.710
really to
shoot it from the approach of the

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:25.720
shoot it from the approach of the
 

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.150
shoot it from the approach of the
characters because when you take the

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:27.160
characters because when you take the
 

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:28.980
characters because when you take the
narration out then it's just like well I

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:28.990
narration out then it's just like well I
 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:31.230
narration out then it's just like well I
guess will the characters make no sense

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:31.240
guess will the characters make no sense
 

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.150
guess will the characters make no sense

again it's more from an analytical

00:31:58.910 --> 00:31:58.920
again it's more from an analytical
 

00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:01.100
again it's more from an analytical
standpoint like why would anybody do

00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:01.110
standpoint like why would anybody do
 

00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:02.780
standpoint like why would anybody do
this why would anyone go back and forth

00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:02.790
this why would anyone go back and forth
 

00:32:02.790 --> 00:32:05.510
this why would anyone go back and forth
but not not bad enough for me so it

00:32:05.510 --> 00:32:05.520
but not not bad enough for me so it
 

00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:07.070
but not not bad enough for me so it
could definitely be a lot worse and I

00:32:07.070 --> 00:32:07.080
could definitely be a lot worse and I
 

00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:09.140
could definitely be a lot worse and I
should've ever could have been a lot

00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:09.150
should've ever could have been a lot
 

00:32:09.150 --> 00:32:11.990
should've ever could have been a lot
worse and by not doing that it actually

00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:12.000
worse and by not doing that it actually
 

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.910
worse and by not doing that it actually
legitimately is worse but I totally

00:32:13.910 --> 00:32:13.920
