00:00:00.278 --> 00:00:01.045
- [Voiceover] Let's talk a little bit

00:00:01.045 --> 00:00:02.391
about the life cycle of a cell.

00:00:02.391 --> 00:00:05.271
In particular, we're gonna
talk about interphase.

00:00:05.271 --> 00:00:08.568
The interphase part of
the life cycle of a cell.

00:00:08.568 --> 00:00:10.773
And as we'll see,
interphase is where a cell

00:00:10.773 --> 00:00:12.817
spends most of its life.

00:00:12.817 --> 00:00:15.626
Let's draw a timeline for a cell.

00:00:15.626 --> 00:00:18.993
So let's say this is a new cell

00:00:18.993 --> 00:00:22.963
and it will go through interphase.

00:00:23.453 --> 00:00:24.604
So I'm gonna make it like a cycle

00:00:24.604 --> 00:00:26.531
so it's gonna go back on itself.

00:00:26.531 --> 00:00:28.853
At some point, so all
of that is interphase.

00:00:28.853 --> 00:00:30.989
At some point it will be ready to divide

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:33.404
and it will undergo mitosis.

00:00:33.404 --> 00:00:36.492
Mitosis is, more formally,
it's the process by which

00:00:36.492 --> 00:00:39.533
the nucleus turns into two nuclei,

00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:41.623
but then that's obviously
needed for cell division.

00:00:41.623 --> 00:00:43.968
So this is mitosis right here in green.

00:00:43.968 --> 00:00:46.035
So as you see, and this isn't precise,

00:00:46.035 --> 00:00:48.658
a cell spends most of
its life in interphase

00:00:48.658 --> 00:00:50.934
and that's where it's just
kind of living as a cell.

00:00:50.934 --> 00:00:53.116
It's living, growing, producing proteins,

00:00:53.116 --> 00:00:55.740
whatever other functions it has

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.201
and mitosis, it's a
shorter part of its life,

00:00:58.201 --> 00:00:59.920
a small fraction, a very interesting part.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.774
It's necessary in order
for the cell to replicate,

00:01:03.774 --> 00:01:06.026
but you see it's a much smaller fraction.

00:01:06.026 --> 00:01:09.439
But what I wanna focus on
in this video is interphase.

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:12.685
To do that, let's draw ourselves a cell.

00:01:13.224 --> 00:01:14.873
So let me copy and paste.

00:01:15.483 --> 00:01:17.389
So this right over here,

00:01:17.697 --> 00:01:20.381
actually let me, I did
that just to save time.

00:01:20.381 --> 00:01:23.191
So let's say this is a cell, so green.

00:01:23.191 --> 00:01:26.325
I have it's nuclear membrane,
or not nuclear membrane,

00:01:26.325 --> 00:01:28.067
I have its cell membrane.

00:01:28.067 --> 00:01:30.923
Inside of that, of course,
you have all of the,

00:01:30.923 --> 00:01:35.535
all of the cytosol, and then
this, in this orangeish color,

00:01:35.535 --> 00:01:38.368
I have the nuclear membrane
that defines the nucleus.

00:01:38.368 --> 00:01:41.154
And then inside of that I have the DNA.

00:01:41.154 --> 00:01:45.310
And you might be used to
seeing DNA all tightly bound,

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.398
or chromosomes all tightly bound like that

00:01:48.798 --> 00:01:53.798
and like that or like this,
this would be another chromosome

00:01:53.878 --> 00:01:55.946
right over here in magenta.

00:01:55.951 --> 00:01:58.482
But during interphase, the chromosomes

00:01:58.482 --> 00:02:01.245
aren't tightly bound like that
so that they're easy to see

00:02:01.245 --> 00:02:05.541
from a traditional or a
simple light microscope.

00:02:05.541 --> 00:02:07.422
For most of a cell's life, the chromosomes

00:02:07.422 --> 00:02:09.256
are completely unwound.

00:02:09.256 --> 00:02:11.346
They are in their chromatin form.

00:02:11.346 --> 00:02:13.575
So they are in their chromatin form.

00:02:13.575 --> 00:02:15.014
It's actually hard to see if you have

00:02:15.014 --> 00:02:19.704
just a simple microphone
(laughing) a simple microscope.

00:02:19.704 --> 00:02:21.933
It's all unwound, you
just have the proteins

00:02:21.933 --> 00:02:24.743
and the DNA, it's all tangled together.

00:02:24.743 --> 00:02:26.693
Now there's one other
thing that I drew here.

00:02:28.753 --> 00:02:29.889
You might say, why am I drawing it

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:32.536
when I haven't drawn most
of the other organelles?

00:02:32.536 --> 00:02:35.415
But I'm drawing this thing,
which is called a centrosome,

00:02:35.415 --> 00:02:39.548
'cause it's going to be important for,

00:02:39.548 --> 00:02:43.750
it's going to be important
for when we go into mitosis.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.170
Now, this drawing as
well, you might say, wait,

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.933
doesn't a cell, at least a human cell

00:02:50.993 --> 00:02:52.826
that has a diploid number of chromosomes,

00:02:52.826 --> 00:02:54.335
and once again, if we're
not talking about sex cells,

00:02:54.335 --> 00:02:56.262
we're talking about
just our somatic cells,

00:02:56.262 --> 00:02:58.212
doesn't it have to have 46 chromosomes?

00:02:58.212 --> 00:03:00.000
It looks like you only drew two.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.811
And it is true, I only
drew two chromosomes

00:03:01.811 --> 00:03:04.180
for the sake of simplicity,
we're just going to assume

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.618
that this is the cell of some
organism that's much simpler,

00:03:06.618 --> 00:03:09.538
that it only has two chromosomes.

00:03:09.891 --> 00:03:12.562
So anyway, this is the
new cell right over here.

00:03:12.562 --> 00:03:14.832
It is going to grow.

00:03:15.023 --> 00:03:18.088
So it is going to grow, it's
going to take in nutrients

00:03:18.088 --> 00:03:20.285
from its environment,
and it's going to grow

00:03:20.285 --> 00:03:22.276
as we would expect it to.

00:03:22.328 --> 00:03:24.186
So that's that right over there.

00:03:24.186 --> 00:03:27.297
And then let me give it its
nucleus and its centrosome

00:03:27.297 --> 00:03:28.917
just like that.

00:03:29.038 --> 00:03:33.705
And this phase, this phase,
where it is just growing

00:03:33.705 --> 00:03:37.281
from this new cell, this is,

00:03:37.281 --> 00:03:39.371
this phase right over here,

00:03:39.371 --> 00:03:42.993
is the G1 phase, the G1,
actually I'm gonna do that

00:03:42.993 --> 00:03:44.363
in a different color
since I'm already using

00:03:44.363 --> 00:03:45.983
that green so much.

00:03:46.197 --> 00:03:49.610
This is the G1 phase and so
that might look something

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:53.200
like this, different
cells are going to do this

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.219
for different periods
of time, the G1 phase.

00:03:56.219 --> 00:03:58.262
But then you can imagine,
well look, it's going to need

00:03:58.262 --> 00:04:00.537
to replicate some of the,
or, it's gonna replicate

00:04:00.537 --> 00:04:05.088
the information inside of,
or that's coded by the DNA

00:04:05.088 --> 00:04:09.286
at some point, and actually,
this happens before mitosis.

00:04:09.314 --> 00:04:11.213
So let's depict that.

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.488
So let me draw,

00:04:14.864 --> 00:04:18.086
let me draw the nucleus
and the centrosome again.

00:04:19.461 --> 00:04:20.344
Let me draw that again.

00:04:20.344 --> 00:04:24.054
Let me draw the cellular membrane.

00:04:24.245 --> 00:04:27.769
This nice healthy growing cell.

00:04:28.262 --> 00:04:31.187
And now, its DNA is
actually going to replicate.

00:04:31.187 --> 00:04:35.622
So instead of having one copy of its DNA,

00:04:35.622 --> 00:04:38.176
it's essentially going
to go to two copies.

00:04:38.176 --> 00:04:39.825
But I wanna be very very careful now.

00:04:39.825 --> 00:04:42.588
So if I draw that magenta
chromosome up here,

00:04:42.588 --> 00:04:45.206
so once again it's all unwound like that.

00:04:45.281 --> 00:04:48.044
When it replicates, it's
going to create a copy

00:04:48.044 --> 00:04:50.830
of its DNA, and once again,
I'm not doing justice

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.097
for how much DNA, how much
DNA there actually is.

00:04:55.196 --> 00:04:57.750
But it was one chromosome
before, it was one chromosome

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.652
when it was just like this,
and it's still one chromosome,

00:05:00.652 --> 00:05:03.113
even though it's copied
its genetic material.

00:05:03.113 --> 00:05:04.707
Let me draw this a little bit neater.

00:05:04.707 --> 00:05:07.238
So this is one chromosome right over here.

00:05:07.238 --> 00:05:09.653
And that one chromosome, after it's copied

00:05:09.653 --> 00:05:13.896
all of its genetic material,
it is still one chromosome.

00:05:14.087 --> 00:05:16.804
Now how do we, but there's
two copies over here,

00:05:16.804 --> 00:05:18.963
what do we call these two copies?

00:05:18.963 --> 00:05:22.307
Well, each of these two
copies are called a chromatid

00:05:22.307 --> 00:05:25.808
and these two right over here,
these are sister chromatids.

00:05:26.766 --> 00:05:31.766
Sister, sister chromatids.

00:05:32.087 --> 00:05:35.476
But either way, this is one
chromosome right over here.

00:05:35.476 --> 00:05:37.916
Chromosome, chromosome.

00:05:38.665 --> 00:05:40.592
And this is also, so
this is one chromosome

00:05:40.592 --> 00:05:44.214
right over there, and that
is also one chromosome.

00:05:44.214 --> 00:05:45.259
This whole thing right over here

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:46.931
is also one chromosome.

00:05:46.931 --> 00:05:48.997
Later on, when we go
through mitosis, we'll see

00:05:48.997 --> 00:05:51.783
that these two sister
chromatids get split apart,

00:05:51.783 --> 00:05:53.269
they're no longer connected.

00:05:53.269 --> 00:05:55.615
At that point, we refer to each of them

00:05:55.615 --> 00:05:58.308
as an individual chromosome.

00:05:58.308 --> 00:06:00.189
Now you might be
wondering, is there a word

00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:01.085
for this place where

00:06:01.085 --> 00:06:03.570
these two sister chromatids are connected?

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:05.845
And the answer is, yes, there is a word,

00:06:05.845 --> 00:06:07.958
and that word is centromere,

00:06:07.958 --> 00:06:10.791
not to be confused with centrosome.

00:06:10.791 --> 00:06:12.671
Let me give myself some space here.

00:06:12.671 --> 00:06:15.731
So that right over
here, that is a centro-,

00:06:16.549 --> 00:06:19.753
centromere, right over that.

00:06:19.753 --> 00:06:24.258
So we had one one magenta, or
we had this magenta chromosome

00:06:24.258 --> 00:06:27.503
right over here, and now it replicates.

00:06:27.555 --> 00:06:29.018
It's still one chromosome,

00:06:29.018 --> 00:06:31.223
although it has twice the
genetic material right now.

00:06:31.223 --> 00:06:34.056
You have these two sister
chromatids connected

00:06:34.056 --> 00:06:36.633
at the, say the centromere's
right over there.

00:06:36.633 --> 00:06:39.879
And that's also going to
happen for the blue chromosome.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.662
All this genetic material
is going to replicate,

00:06:42.662 --> 00:06:44.264
you're gonna have two copies of it.

00:06:44.264 --> 00:06:47.097
And so now it's gonna be made
up of two sister chromatids

00:06:47.097 --> 00:06:51.857
that are maybe connected
once again at a centromere.

00:06:51.857 --> 00:06:54.016
And also while all of this
replication is happening

00:06:54.016 --> 00:06:58.144
inside the nucleus, the
centrosome also duplicates.

00:06:58.405 --> 00:07:02.625
The centrosome also duplicates.

00:07:02.677 --> 00:07:04.534
And this process, the
part of the life cycle

00:07:04.534 --> 00:07:07.635
where all of this genetic
information is duplicating,

00:07:07.635 --> 00:07:12.018
we call that the S-phase,
S-phase for synthesis.

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:14.955
So this is the synthesis phase.

00:07:14.955 --> 00:07:17.555
So that is the S-phase.

00:07:17.555 --> 00:07:19.204
And then before going into mitosis,

00:07:19.204 --> 00:07:21.242
there is one more growth phase.

00:07:21.433 --> 00:07:23.688
There is one more growth phase,

00:07:23.688 --> 00:07:26.005
and we call that G2.

00:07:26.312 --> 00:07:28.216
So we have one more growth phase,

00:07:28.216 --> 00:07:31.206
which we call G2.

00:07:31.397 --> 00:07:35.014
And then we are ready, so let
me just copy and paste this.

00:07:35.065 --> 00:07:38.729
Let me just do this, so
that's what we had before.

00:07:39.175 --> 00:07:42.583
Now we need to remember
that our DNA has replicated.

00:07:43.099 --> 00:07:47.296
Our DNA has replicated,
so let me draw that.

00:07:47.781 --> 00:07:50.608
Let me draw the two centromeres,

00:07:51.078 --> 00:07:53.354
one for each of the chromosomes.

00:07:53.354 --> 00:07:56.120
Let me draw the replicated,

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:59.649
the duplicated centrosome,

00:07:59.649 --> 00:08:01.530
not to be confused with centromere.

00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:04.125
Now the cell has grown even more.

00:08:04.246 --> 00:08:08.333
The cell has grown, the
cell has grown even more.

00:08:08.333 --> 00:08:11.258
And once again, going from this to this,

00:08:11.258 --> 00:08:13.505
we call that the G2 phase.

00:08:13.627 --> 00:08:16.251
At this point, at the end of the G2 phase,

00:08:16.251 --> 00:08:19.496
this is now when we are ready,

00:08:19.664 --> 00:08:22.334
this is now, what if we do
this in a different color?

00:08:22.334 --> 00:08:26.183
This is now when we are ready for mitosis.
