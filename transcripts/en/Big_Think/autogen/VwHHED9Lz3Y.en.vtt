I just this weekend was at an event
 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:13.250
I just this weekend was at an event
called drawdown learn with Paul Hawken

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:13.260
called drawdown learn with Paul Hawken
 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.850
called drawdown learn with Paul Hawken
based on his book drawdown and the work

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:17.860
based on his book drawdown and the work
 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.990
based on his book drawdown and the work
that he and the group of scientists have

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:22.000
that he and the group of scientists have
 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.310
that he and the group of scientists have
done in explaining what we need to do to

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320
done in explaining what we need to do to
 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.819
done in explaining what we need to do to
drawdown global warming and what's

00:00:32.819 --> 00:00:32.829
drawdown global warming and what's
 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:37.740
drawdown global warming and what's
remarkable is that it has become

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750
remarkable is that it has become
 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.189
remarkable is that it has become
practical in other words they have

practical in other words they have
 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:45.510
practical in other words they have
proven that refrigeration and the

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:45.520
proven that refrigeration and the
 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.340
proven that refrigeration and the
chemicals we use in refrigeration is the

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350
chemicals we use in refrigeration is the

number one Paul Hawkens talked a lot

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:51.309
number one Paul Hawkens talked a lot
 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:54.049
number one Paul Hawkens talked a lot
about the language we use to describe

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059
about the language we use to describe
 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.229
about the language we use to describe
climate change and his principal point

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:58.239
climate change and his principal point
 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:02.430
climate change and his principal point
was that we treated as an evil that we

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440
was that we treated as an evil that we
 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.340
was that we treated as an evil that we
should be afraid of the war against

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350
should be afraid of the war against
 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.500
should be afraid of the war against
climate change or the battle against

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:07.510
climate change or the battle against
 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.890
climate change or the battle against
climate change and and he went through a

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:10.900
climate change and and he went through a
 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.870
climate change and and he went through a
whole list of the kinds of expressions

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880
whole list of the kinds of expressions
 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.140
whole list of the kinds of expressions
we use it's clear when it comes to

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.150
we use it's clear when it comes to
 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.120
we use it's clear when it comes to
climate change as it's been clear about

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130
climate change as it's been clear about
 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.550
climate change as it's been clear about
drunk driving and smoking and all the

aspects of climate change when you can
make it real and when you can talk about

make a difference what I hope the book
 

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:08.860
make a difference what I hope the book
does is make it clear that leading

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870
does is make it clear that leading
 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.759
does is make it clear that leading

that it is possible to step up and that
all that's really needed is for someone

00:03:42.399 --> 00:03:42.409
all that's really needed is for someone
 

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:45.039
all that's really needed is for someone
to decide to do it and and to start

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:45.049
to decide to do it and and to start
 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:48.969
to decide to do it and and to start
where they are to look at the reality of

00:03:48.969 --> 00:03:48.979
where they are to look at the reality of
 

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:52.599
where they are to look at the reality of
the things around them and to think

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:52.609
the things around them and to think
 

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:55.149
the things around them and to think
about who needs to be part of a

00:03:55.149 --> 00:03:55.159
about who needs to be part of a
 

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:56.759
about who needs to be part of a
conversation and to start a conversation

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769
conversation and to start a conversation
 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:00.939
conversation and to start a conversation
Meg Wheatley talks about the fact that

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:00.949
Meg Wheatley talks about the fact that
 

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:03.849
Meg Wheatley talks about the fact that
all change begins with a conversation

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:03.859
all change begins with a conversation
 

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:06.460
all change begins with a conversation
between people and that's really how to

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470
between people and that's really how to
 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.920
between people and that's really how to
begin the process of social change as

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930
begin the process of social change as
 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:10.840
begin the process of social change as
well

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:10.850
