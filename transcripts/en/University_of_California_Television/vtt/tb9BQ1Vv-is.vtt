00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:03.620
- [Narrator] This program is presented

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.250
by University of California Television.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.030
- Good evening, everyone.
I'm Jennifer Wolch.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.100
I'm dean of the college
of environmental design

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.053
here at Berkeley.

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:53.060
And it's my great honor and pleasure

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:58.030
to welcome you to the
2015 Hitchcock Lecture

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.910
by the preeminent architectural critic,

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.113
educator, and writer, Paul Goldberger.

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.060
For those of you who may
not have been here yesterday

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.200
when Paul gave his first Hitchcock lecture

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.480
the Charles M. and
Martha Hitchcock lectures

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.060
were endowed in 1885

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.150
with the first lecture starting

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.490
on the Berkeley campus in 1909.

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.060
And then in 1932, through a bequest

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.060
from the Hitchcock's daughter,
Lillie Hitchcock Coit,

00:01:28.739 --> 00:01:31.201
the program was expanded.

00:01:31.201 --> 00:01:34.720
I think if you look at the
list of Hitchcock lecturers

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.540
it's almost impossible
to overstate the eminence

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.170
of the people who have
been Hitchcock lecturers.

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.310
This elite list primarily includes,

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.370
especially in the early years, scientists.

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.320
And right after the series started

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.560
there were a number of years
focused on earthquakes.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.003
But I guess we can understand
why if it started in 1909.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.210
The coterie of luminaries includes people

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.660
like Robert Oppenheimer
and Stephen Hawking,

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.140
just to name a couple.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.390
And then also historians
and social scientists

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.083
are prominent on this list.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.850
Wassily Leontief, Clifford Garrets,

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.450
Noam Chomsky, Herbert Simon,

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.013
Kenneth Boulding, Amart Yat-sen.

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:28.010
It was not until 1952 that
an architect or urbanist

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.340
came to give a Hitchcock lecture

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.980
when Joseph Hudnut, who
was the dean at Columbia,

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.230
and was the first dean of

00:02:35.512 --> 00:02:38.118
the Harvard Graduate School
of Design, came to Berkeley.

00:02:38.118 --> 00:02:40.430
And I must say that
the Hitchcock committee

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.400
really made him work.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.573
He gave seven lectures.

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.253
So you're getting off really light, Paul.

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.870
He gave three on Paris in the middle ages,

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.660
one entitled, "The
Common Man in the City,"

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.810
and another entitled,
"We Are Building a City."

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.233
And then he did one on
the Golden Gate Bridge.

00:03:01.203 --> 00:03:04.320
It suggests that despite
his east coast origins

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.760
he was not entirely immune

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.020
to the charms of the city by the bay.

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.510
The next architect and scholar to come

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:17.470
and give a Hitchcock lecture
was Ada Louise Huxtable,

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.950
the Pulitzer prize-winning
architectural critic

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.310
for the New York Times as well
as the Wall Street Journal

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.140
and a prolific writer.

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.417
And in 1982 she gave two
lectures, both on tall buildings,

00:03:28.417 --> 00:03:29.970
"The Tall Building Beyond Function,"

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.350
and then, "The Tall
Building Beyond Style,"

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:36.200
which later became a book about
tall buildings reconsidered.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.200
And then the last person
to come before Paul

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.680
was Berkeley's own Peter
Hall, Sir Peter Hall,

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.994
who taught for many
years in the department

00:03:46.994 --> 00:03:48.390
of city and regional planning.

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.270
And he came back to give
Hitchcock lectures in 1990

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.777
and spoke about, "Cities and civilization:

00:03:54.777 --> 00:03:56.920
"Culture and Innovation and Urban Order."

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.967
And also his second lecture
was, "The End of the City:

00:04:00.967 --> 00:04:04.910
"The Report of My Death
Was An Exaggeration."

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.430
So he was calling into question

00:04:08.533 --> 00:04:10.440
the thematics of the time

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.080
which seemed to imagine that the city

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.660
maybe was on its last legs, not so fast.

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.520
Well, this afternoon the
Berkeley Hitchcock committee,

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.420
as well as the college
of environmental design,

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.260
our faculty, our students, and our alumni,

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.770
are incredibly proud to
welcome Paul Goldberger

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.020
to our campus and our community.

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:35.020
And to be able to have
the distinct experience

00:04:38.387 --> 00:04:41.290
and benefit of hearing
his lecture this evening.

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.450
And also during the day to be able

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.370
to interact with him on
a more informal basis.

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:48.740
So what I'd like to do now

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.360
is turn the podium over
to associate professor

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.740
of architecture and urban
design, Nicholas de Monchaux,

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.350
who will introduce Paul.

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:57.183
Nicholas.

00:04:58.885 --> 00:05:01.135
(applause)

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:06.633
- Hi.

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:09.770
My name is Nicholas de Monchaux.

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:11.670
And it is my great pleasure

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:15.013
to introduce Paul Goldberger
to you this afternoon.

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:17.950
And in so doing I also have to apologize

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:21.000
for breaking what must be
one of the cardinal rules

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.080
of these introductions, which
is talking about myself,

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.980
albeit very briefly.

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:29.690
The relevant fact here
being that my twin brother,

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:32.010
Thomas, like Paul, makes his living,

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:34.800
albeit as a less distinguished
architecture critic,

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.500
which in turns relates to the reasons

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.980
why I am not an architecture critic,

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:40.763
which is that it is too hard.

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:44.200
And not just for the obvious reasons

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:47.250
to do with today's shifting
landscape of media.

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:49.930
But hard for a much
more longstanding reason

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:51.780
which has to do with
the nature of the critic

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.480
and the nature of the
architectural profession itself.

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:58.370
So much of our current contemporary
consciousness of design

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:01.390
as a culture is thanks to
the increasingly instrumental

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:03.715
and influential role of design

00:06:03.715 --> 00:06:08.715
in shaping our changing personal
relationship to technology.

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:10.790
From this, of course, is born a new

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:13.890
and proliferating kind
of design criticism,

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:17.600
endlessly parsing interface
and logic of consumer devices,

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.630
Apple's chief amongst them.

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:22.260
But architecture's great difficulty

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.230
is everything to do with
its profound difference

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:27.060
from such consumed objects

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:28.660
which is why the architecture critic

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:31.610
must play a much more profound role.

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:33.020
Unlike Apple Watches,

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:35.330
the very powerful people
who pay for buildings

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:39.610
are more often than not, not
those who have to use them,

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:40.490
or live with them.

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:41.840
And the architects who design them

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.300
have actually highly variable ability

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:45.970
to control either the largest

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:48.320
or most detailed
components of their design

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.690
and can rarely risk
offending those for whom

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:54.200
they might build, as
it's said, in the future.

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:56.300
And the legacy of this imperfect mix

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.360
of causation and responsibility becomes

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:01.610
the collective landscape
of the city and its ecology

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:04.020
with which we all must live for far longer

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:06.773
than a building's circumstances
of origin hold true.

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:10.760
Into this landscape steps
the architecture critic

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.670
who must alternately befriend an enemy

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:15.030
to client, architect, and public alike,

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:18.640
standing up for and recognizing
quality in not just design

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:21.280
but also patronage and public ethics.

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:24.810
And also noting, where
necessary, its absence.

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:27.980
This is a mine field and
few have negotiated it

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.053
so successfully as our guest tonight.

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:33.520
Paul Goldberger's career
began at the New York Times

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:37.150
where his criticism earned him,
in 1984, the Pulitzer Prize.

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:40.160
There are many, many other
awards which I will not list

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.770
because I've talked too long already.

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:44.580
His career continued at The New Yorker

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:46.430
and most recently to his role

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:48.783
as contributing editor at Vanity Fair.

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:52.440
Throughout his career,
Goldberger has tirelessly acted

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:55.890
as advocate, observer, public
proxy, and cultural curator

00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:58.650
across these many
constituencies and actors

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:02.180
who bring together the
contemporary city into being.

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:05.300
And not just in New York but
across the folds and contours

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:07.970
of what is increasingly
becoming a global conversation

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:09.563
about the city as well.

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:12.320
Now of course as well
as teaching the public

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:14.490
through his writing he
has also had a career

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:16.720
as a leader and educator in the academy

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:19.360
that would, on its own,
put many of us to shame

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:21.660
as David Parsons, and now
the Joseph Urban Chair

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:24.550
in design and architecture
at The New School.

00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:26.970
To me, however, Goldberger's
particular achievement

00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:29.520
has been to extend the
short and singular nature

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:31.300
of the classic critics column

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:33.700
into a more extended
trenchant observations

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:35.940
in the form of many, many books.

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:37.810
Unlike the works of lots of critics,

00:08:37.810 --> 00:08:39.270
these are not compendia,

00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:42.100
but extended intellectual
and erudite observations

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:43.730
not just on the shape of the city

00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:46.380
but also on the forces shaping it.

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:48.910
From the early prescient, "On The Rise,"

00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:50.670
to the timely, "Up From Zero,"

00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:53.230
to 2009's, "Why Architecture Matters,"

00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:56.073
to his most recent forthcoming
biography of Frank Gehry,

00:08:57.208 --> 00:09:00.950
Goldberger's career and intellect
continue to point towards

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:02.830
the fundamental role of the critic

00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:05.930
yet with a depth and eloquence
that few critics accomplish.

00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:06.763
Which is to say,

00:09:06.763 --> 00:09:09.260
they distinguish between
success and excellence,

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.440
they make legible what is inscrutable,

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:12.900
they judge what is wanting,

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:15.640
but above all, they extend,

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:17.760
in patron, public, and designer equally,

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:20.570
our sense of what is
possible and even necessary

00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:22.440
for architecture to accomplish.

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:24.630
Please join me in
welcoming Paul Goldberger

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:25.630
here this afternoon.

00:09:26.611 --> 00:09:28.861
(applause)

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:40.390
- Thank you so much, Dean Wolch,
and Professor de Monchaux.

00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:44.880
Those incredibly generous words,

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:47.650
actually they remind me of something

00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:49.970
that Linden Johnson said

00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:54.210
when he received an
equally kind introduction,

00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:56.710
which was how sorry he
was that his parents

00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:58.750
were not here to hear it.

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:03.750
His father because he would
have been amused by it

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:07.180
and his mother because she
would have believed it.

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:13.610
I feel very much the same. Thank you.

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:15.860
Yesterday I said a word
or two at the beginning

00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:20.860
about how honored I am to
be part of the extraordinary

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:23.283
legacy of the Hitchcock series.

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:28.040
I said that not aware that Joseph Hudnut

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:31.690
had delivered two and a half
times the number of lectures

00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:33.660
that I'm doing.

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:36.654
My only hope is that he didn't

00:10:36.654 --> 00:10:38.990
attend as many classes and studios

00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:42.293
so that at least we even out that way.

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:46.940
Yesterday in the first
part of what I suppose

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:51.050
could be considered an
investigation into the

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:53.460
current challenges facing the city

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:56.400
I talked about what I
called the generic city.

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:59.510
And while all was not doom and gloom,

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:03.210
the point of the talk was, I
will be the first to admit,

00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:05.210
a little bit downbeat.

00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:07.100
The forces of technology,

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:10.760
for all the good they are
doing us in so many ways,

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:14.440
are also powerfully speeding
up the homogenization

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:18.950
of culture that has been a
force in the world for some time

00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:21.683
and which seems now to be unstoppable.

00:11:22.700 --> 00:11:26.650
How cities can retain, let alone create,

00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:29.340
a distinct identity when
there is little incentive,

00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:32.670
other than tourism, to
look and feel different

00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:34.223
is an enormous challenge.

00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:38.150
Today I want to talk about
the other side of the coin,

00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:41.680
the more positive aspect of
cities as they are evolving

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:44.990
in the information and technology culture,

00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:47.830
which is the growing belief that cities,

00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:50.070
which since time immemorial

00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:53.100
have been incubators for creative ideas,

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:57.690
a history that no one has
tracked more thoroughly

00:11:59.293 --> 00:12:02.463
and with more erudition
than Sir Peter Hall,

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:07.313
that they are still where
creative people seek to be.

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:11.240
Not everyone, of course,
believes this to be true.

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:13.800
I recall reading a dialogue between

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:15.670
the management guru Tom Peters

00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:18.930
and the writer George
Gilder in Forbes Magazine

00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:20.620
on whether technology would mean

00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:22.900
an end to cities as we know them

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:25.100
or would give them a continued future.

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:27.430
Gilder saw no point to the old city,

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:31.670
which he saw only as a tired
relic of the industrial age.

00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:34.920
He celebrated the way in
which electronic communication

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:38.590
was rapidly making it,
in his view, obsolete.

00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:41.300
You no longer have to
be there, Gilder argued,

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:43.380
so why would you want to?

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:46.393
It's dark, dirty, noisy, and crowded.

00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:48.520
Talk to everyone by email

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:50.330
and look out your window at trees.

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:51.583
Much nicer, right?

00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:57.190
Peters, like Sir Peter Hall
and his Hitchcock lecture

00:12:57.190 --> 00:13:01.920
it seemed took a more measured
and ultimately wiser view,

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:03.977
pointing out that, as he put it,

00:13:03.977 --> 00:13:07.987
"There is a fundamental human
dimension of real contact

00:13:07.987 --> 00:13:10.237
"that cannot happen on the internet

00:13:10.237 --> 00:13:13.497
"and which real cities
were designed to facilitate

00:13:13.497 --> 00:13:15.377
"and still do."

00:13:15.377 --> 00:13:19.227
"The richness, the
exuberant variety of cities,

00:13:19.227 --> 00:13:21.597
"is the fount of economic creativity

00:13:21.597 --> 00:13:24.193
"and business growth," Peters said.

00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:26.790
I agree with Peters

00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:27.870
but I think it's obvious that

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:29.920
the nature of the city is changing

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:34.900
even if it is not, as Gilder
predicted, becoming obsolete.

00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:37.460
The city is not economically necessary

00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:39.223
in the way that it once was.

00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:42.650
Markets can function without it.

00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:45.100
No matter how much we may love cities,

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:47.310
we cannot pretend that they are necessary

00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:49.470
for the transaction of business,

00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:53.010
or the movement of
capital, as they once were.

00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:56.707
As the sociologist Saskia
Sassen has written,

00:13:56.707 --> 00:14:00.947
"The computerized workplace
can be located anywhere.

00:14:00.947 --> 00:14:03.787
"In a clerical factory in the Bahamas

00:14:03.787 --> 00:14:05.537
"or at a home in the suburbs.

00:14:05.537 --> 00:14:08.697
"The growth of information
industries has made it possible

00:14:08.697 --> 00:14:10.267
"for outputs to be transmitted

00:14:10.267 --> 00:14:12.937
"around the globe instantaneously.

00:14:12.937 --> 00:14:16.797
"The globalization of economic
activity suggests that place,

00:14:16.797 --> 00:14:20.737
"particularly the kind of
place represented by cities,

00:14:20.737 --> 00:14:22.227
"no longer matters."

00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:26.828
But Sassen went on to point out

00:14:26.828 --> 00:14:30.010
that this is not, in
fact, what has happened.

00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:31.740
There's a paradox.

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:35.240
The very forces that were
supposed to eliminate the city

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:37.280
have turned out to make
at least some cities

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:39.310
more important than ever.

00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:41.230
National and global markets,

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:43.840
as well as globally integrated operations,

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:46.240
require central places where the work

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:48.260
of globalization gets done.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:50.730
She points out, certain cities,

00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:55.020
New York, London, Hong Kong,
Los Angeles, Tokyo, Sydney,

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:59.110
Sao Paolo, Frankfurt, to
name some of the major ones,

00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:02.300
are nodes in an international system

00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:05.960
that has made them critically
important around the world

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:08.410
and has even given them a kind of identity

00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:10.780
that is distinct from that of the nations

00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:12.860
of which they are a part.

00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:14.530
They are global cities,

00:15:14.530 --> 00:15:17.420
more connected in many ways to each other

00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:20.523
than to the geographical
regions that surround them.

00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:23.470
So we can say that if cities are not

00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:28.250
economically necessary in
the way that they were,

00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:31.560
they are economically
necessary in a different way,

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:34.720
a way that has only been
enhanced, not diminished,

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:37.730
by the technology of the 21st century.

00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:41.400
I think we could say that
in another way as well.

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:42.400
Which is to say that cities

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:44.570
are more entrenched in our culture

00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:46.970
than they were, say, 50 years ago.

00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:49.810
They're more culturally
necessary than ever.

00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:52.430
And we can see that in the greater energy

00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:55.200
that is now present in
the downtown centers

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:58.310
of cities that come nowhere near

00:15:58.310 --> 00:16:01.810
belonging in the class of
global financial centers.

00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:04.200
There's more going on
in Boston, and Chicago,

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:07.810
and Charlotte, and Austin than
there was a few years ago,

00:16:07.810 --> 00:16:10.310
even though those cities don't qualify

00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:14.010
as belonging in the class of
mega international financial

00:16:14.010 --> 00:16:18.273
centers that transcend their
own geographical regions.

00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:22.970
By talking about the city as
culturally necessary today,

00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:25.630
I mean something much more
than that they are needed

00:16:25.630 --> 00:16:29.343
as places in which culture
is housed or consumed.

00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:33.920
Cities do provide a
home for culture death.

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:35.210
But I'm not talking about the fact

00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:36.790
that they are where the
ballet, or the opera,

00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:39.850
or the art museum, choose to locate.

00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:42.560
I mean culture in the broadest sense.

00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:46.440
Culture as meaning our
ethos, our civilization,

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:48.003
how we define ourselves.

00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:51.400
I think that cities
feed the culture today.

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:53.750
The idea of urbanism is, itself,

00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:56.423
for many people a cultural experience.

00:16:57.530 --> 00:17:01.550
The fact of being in the
city is now, for many people,

00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:05.290
as satisfying and broadening
a cultural experience

00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:08.480
as going to the theater or an art museum.

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:11.080
A younger generation engages with

00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:12.663
the city in a different way.

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:16.330
And I think a more participatory way

00:17:16.330 --> 00:17:17.653
than their predecessors.

00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:20.260
It is not afraid of the city

00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:25.430
since it knows primarily a city
that is safe and prosperous,

00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:28.370
if less diverse than it once was.

00:17:28.370 --> 00:17:30.080
And for all kinds of reasons

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:33.520
the generation under 40 is
less inclined to see the city

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:35.360
only as a place to work,

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:37.710
as their parents or
grandparents might have,

00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:41.433
and see it instead as a place
in which to live and to play.

00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:45.683
If, that is, they can afford it.

00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:49.010
I will come back to
this point in a moment.

00:17:49.010 --> 00:17:51.830
The increasing economic
inequalities of the city,

00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:53.200
the way in which the city,

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:56.200
by making so many things
visible and manifest

00:17:56.200 --> 00:18:00.960
before our very eyes, inevitably
places the national problem

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:04.543
of income inequality in
especially high relief.

00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:09.980
For now, however, let's observe
only that, as I just said,

00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:12.450
San Francisco, and Boston, and Chicago,

00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:15.080
and Austin, and Pittsburgh, and Denver,

00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:19.090
and even, astonishingly, Detroit,

00:18:19.090 --> 00:18:22.240
not to mention global cities
like New York and London,

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:24.756
possess a level of vibrancy

00:18:24.756 --> 00:18:28.900
that is far greater than
even a few years ago

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:32.770
and in complete conflict
with what the anti-urbanists,

00:18:32.770 --> 00:18:35.203
anti-urban theorists predicted.

00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:40.720
But Richard Florida's theory

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:43.860
that the renewal of
cities is fueled by a new,

00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:47.690
so-called creative class of young people

00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:49.123
misses the point, I think.

00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:53.210
The glib phrase "creative class"

00:18:53.210 --> 00:18:54.840
has now entered the language

00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:57.200
but it does not explain everything.

00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:58.610
I think there are a lot of things

00:18:58.610 --> 00:19:00.500
behind the renewal of cities

00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:03.430
and the presence of the
so-called creative class

00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:07.620
is not a cause but is more
in the line of an effect

00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:11.713
of the enormous rise in the
financial services industry.

00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:14.370
We may not believe that our movement

00:19:14.370 --> 00:19:16.450
away from industrial economy

00:19:16.450 --> 00:19:18.770
and toward a financial services economy

00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:22.220
has always been a positive
thing for society.

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:24.430
But it is impossible to
deny that it accounts

00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:28.420
for at least as much, if
not more, urban growth

00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:31.490
than the eagerness of
younger, more creative people

00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:33.253
to be in urban areas.

00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:39.380
The reality is that what has
been called a creative class,

00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:43.930
the creative class, is far
from entirely creative.

00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:45.870
A young analyst working on Wall Street

00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:47.100
wants to live in the city

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:49.610
and partake of a certain kind of life.

00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:53.170
That she does is good
for society, I believe.

00:19:53.170 --> 00:19:56.150
Better than if she had
retreated to the suburbs.

00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:58.560
But does it make her creative?

00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:00.270
Perhaps it is fair to say that

00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:02.240
this economic and social class

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:04.980
is more receptive to
creativity than their parent's

00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:07.530
or grandparent's generations were

00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:09.210
and that's the difference.

00:20:09.210 --> 00:20:12.710
They are more sophisticated.
They like better food.

00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:14.860
They are at ease with technology.

00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:18.143
They are not suspicious of
modern art or modern furniture.

00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:22.950
It is surely not that
they are all artists.

00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:24.610
There are not enough poets, and writers,

00:20:24.610 --> 00:20:26.780
and painters, and dancers, and actors,

00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:29.830
to fill all of these
new condominium towers

00:20:29.830 --> 00:20:31.920
in cities all around the globe.

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:35.930
And if there were, 99%
of those creative people

00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:37.530
wouldn't be able to afford them.

00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:42.300
There is a marketplace for creativity

00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:44.640
or a desire to be in an environment

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:46.890
that embraces creativity.

00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:51.390
That is certainly the case today
in cities around the world.

00:20:51.390 --> 00:20:53.910
Again, if you define the creative class

00:20:53.910 --> 00:20:55.870
as the market for creativity

00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:58.140
as opposed to people doing the creating

00:20:59.050 --> 00:21:01.520
then the notion of the creative class

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:06.520
as behind the urban revival
may make some sense.

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:08.880
But if you take the phrase literally

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:11.030
to mean the people designing, writing,

00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:12.803
painting, acting, and so forth,

00:21:13.654 --> 00:21:16.130
well, there are a lot of them, yes,

00:21:16.130 --> 00:21:19.160
but not nearly enough to
fuel the urban revival

00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:21.260
that we have been experiencing

00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:24.410
in many cities in the last two decades.

00:21:24.410 --> 00:21:27.380
So the ubiquitous creative class label

00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:30.180
flatters the consumers of creativity

00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:32.543
by equating them with the creators.

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:38.440
Either that, or it naively
assumes that the world we live in

00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:40.920
so believes in creativity

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:43.090
that it compensates film
makers, and artists,

00:21:43.090 --> 00:21:44.700
and teachers, and dancers,

00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:48.360
the way it compensates
financial analysts and bankers.

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:50.300
And if you believe that,

00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:53.063
well, I have a bridge
to sell you in Brooklyn.

00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:57.450
Nothing, of course, could
be farther from the truth.

00:21:57.450 --> 00:22:00.290
In fact, things are moving
in the other direction

00:22:00.290 --> 00:22:04.530
toward less equality of income, not more.

00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:06.670
And many of the truly creative people,

00:22:06.670 --> 00:22:08.910
the artists, and writers,
and actors, and filmmakers,

00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:12.120
have been priced out
of the creative cities

00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:15.000
that by Richard Florida's measure

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.693
belong to them and that
they have helped to revive.

00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:22.430
What young writer now can afford

00:22:22.430 --> 00:22:24.833
to live in New York or San Francisco?

00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:29.970
Yesterday I talked of beginning
my own career in New York

00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:33.710
in the economically depressed 1970s,

00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:36.150
which turned out to be
a weirdly great gift

00:22:36.150 --> 00:22:37.980
to me and my family.

00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:40.380
It allowed me to raise
children in the city

00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:43.240
in a way that as a journalist and academic

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:47.273
I could almost surely
not have afforded to do.

00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:51.690
Those days, as we've said, are long gone.

00:22:51.690 --> 00:22:55.010
In San Francisco as much as New York,

00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:59.090
where the neighborhoods you
once were afraid to walk in

00:22:59.090 --> 00:23:00.363
you now can't afford.

00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:03.830
I was in London last week

00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:05.913
and it is exactly the same thing.

00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:10.150
The pace of gentrification
has so accelerated

00:23:10.150 --> 00:23:12.810
that we seem almost to be skipping over

00:23:12.810 --> 00:23:14.670
the point of equilibrium

00:23:14.670 --> 00:23:17.419
where a neighborhood is a diverse mixture

00:23:17.419 --> 00:23:18.290
of older residents,

00:23:18.290 --> 00:23:21.950
new arrivals who bring a
different kind of sophistication,

00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:23.920
families, creative people,

00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:26.470
and a smattering of business folk.

00:23:26.470 --> 00:23:29.860
Instead the process of
gentrification seems

00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:33.730
less a benign engine of gradual upgrade

00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:36.080
than a bulldozer that figuratively

00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:38.010
and sometimes also literally

00:23:38.010 --> 00:23:40.803
seems to crush what is in its path.

00:23:41.890 --> 00:23:44.550
And it hardly helps, of course,

00:23:44.550 --> 00:23:47.610
that technology has upended the market

00:23:47.610 --> 00:23:50.490
for much creative work,

00:23:50.490 --> 00:23:54.140
especially in the fields
of writing and music

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:58.390
where the pie is now vastly smaller,

00:23:58.390 --> 00:24:03.250
meaning creative people
have less, not more,

00:24:03.250 --> 00:24:06.920
money at their disposal
even as they try to cope

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:10.243
in this new hyper-inflated market.

00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:14.790
What I experienced in
New York in the 1970s,

00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:16.650
when good real estate was accessible

00:24:16.650 --> 00:24:20.880
to professional people at
a wider range of income,

00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:23.530
and hence, and this is the
really important thing,

00:24:23.530 --> 00:24:26.720
at a wider range of types of profession,

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:28.720
is no longer to be found there,

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:33.400
or in San Francisco, or
Boston, or Los Angeles,

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:37.760
where urban housing seems
increasingly out of the grasp

00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:41.282
of all but the most highly compensated

00:24:41.282 --> 00:24:42.993
of the younger generation.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.920
In New York, that means finance mostly,

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:50.200
with a smattering of tech.

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:53.820
In San Francisco, it means tech mostly,

00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:56.050
with a smattering of finance.

00:24:56.050 --> 00:24:58.623
But this is a distinction
without a difference.

00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:01.780
To buy urban real estate cheaply

00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:03.880
you now have to go to Detroit,

00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:06.510
where many of the truly creative

00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:09.870
who now cannot afford
even to live in Brooklyn

00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:12.360
move west to set themselves up

00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:14.403
in an affordable urban environment.

00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:18.150
This is another example of creative people

00:25:18.150 --> 00:25:21.200
with limited resources
jumping in to take advantage

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:22.950
of a disadvantaged economy

00:25:23.953 --> 00:25:27.250
and in so doing, help to turn it around.

00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:30.620
It is profoundly exciting
to see this happening.

00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:33.760
And the resurgence of
Detroit as a creative center

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:35.483
is pleasing in every way.

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:38.390
But it should not, I think,

00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:41.280
be considered a true revival of the city.

00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:43.973
As pleasing, even heartwarming,

00:25:45.109 --> 00:25:48.223
as the creative resurgence of Detroit is,

00:25:49.416 --> 00:25:50.890
there will never be enough to it

00:25:50.890 --> 00:25:53.300
to equal the jobs that have been lost

00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:57.440
and to bring the city back
to the place it once was.

00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:02.020
Yes, the arts are critical
to the urban economy

00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:05.593
but more from the standpoint
of consumption than creativity.

00:26:06.810 --> 00:26:09.070
And consumption in the visual arts

00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:11.860
means tourists coming
to Metropolitan Museum

00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:15.210
where the marketplace of the art auctions

00:26:15.210 --> 00:26:17.270
at Sotheby's and Christie's.

00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:20.733
It does not mean the creative act itself.

00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:25.362
I doubt that Detroit will
ever again have the muscle,

00:26:25.362 --> 00:26:28.850
economically, to be a
major consumer of culture.

00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:31.660
It is great that it is filling
up with young creative people

00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:33.330
who have been displaced from Brooklyn

00:26:33.330 --> 00:26:37.010
by the vast army of
financial services workers

00:26:37.010 --> 00:26:41.800
who now seek to live in
so-called creative environments.

00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:43.970
But it is hard for me to see

00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:46.723
how this alone will turn Detroit around.

00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:50.770
Detroit's revival, and
let's put that in quotes,

00:26:50.770 --> 00:26:52.513
is fine such as it is.

00:26:53.450 --> 00:26:56.240
But if it cannot be directly connected

00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:59.580
to a broader kind of economic growth

00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:02.283
I'm not sure what it will ever amount to.

00:27:03.850 --> 00:27:06.730
And I say that being
aware of the noble effort

00:27:06.730 --> 00:27:10.710
of a company like Shinola,
which you may have heard of,

00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:14.090
which is committed to bringing
manufacturing back to Detroit

00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:16.910
and makes watches,
bicycles, and leather goods

00:27:16.910 --> 00:27:20.660
of decent quality, and then
markets the hell out of them

00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:23.020
with a brilliant advertising campaign

00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:24.440
that encourages those of us

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:26.760
with a commitment to urban revival

00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:28.970
to believe that we are helping this effort

00:27:28.970 --> 00:27:31.700
by buying a $500 quartz watch

00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:34.000
that has been assembled in Detroit.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.310
Although not in fact literally made there

00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:39.853
because the movement is
imported from Switzerland.

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:43.670
I will say while we're on that subject

00:27:43.670 --> 00:27:46.520
that I'm of two minds about Shinola,

00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:50.810
which positions itself as an
earnest, scrappy manufacturer

00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:54.920
determined to swim
upstream against the tide

00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:57.300
but which is actually
a division of a huge,

00:27:57.300 --> 00:28:00.600
private congolmerate
called Bedrock Brands,

00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:03.410
the same company that owns Fossil Watches

00:28:03.410 --> 00:28:06.290
and which has based its
entire marketing plan

00:28:06.290 --> 00:28:08.830
on the notion that there are enough people

00:28:08.830 --> 00:28:13.330
who think the idea of something
made in Detroit is now cool

00:28:13.330 --> 00:28:15.830
so that they will spend $500

00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:19.223
on a $100 watch with
a handsome retro face.

00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:23.210
Shinola spent millions of
dollars on a retail outlet

00:28:23.210 --> 00:28:24.940
in Tribeca, in Lower Manhattan,

00:28:24.940 --> 00:28:26.990
which has been so successful

00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:30.380
it reportedly met its
first year sales goal

00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:31.983
within the first month.

00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:35.310
Affluent young professionals

00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:39.080
apparently love the idea of
buying something made in Detroit

00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:43.283
so long as it is not a car, I suppose,

00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:45.810
which I'm sure they believe

00:28:45.810 --> 00:28:49.303
still needs to be made in
Munich or Stuttgart to be valid.

00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:51.950
But jobs are jobs.

00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:55.010
And Shinola does keep a lot
of people busy in Detroit

00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:58.260
assembling these things,
and that is all to the good,

00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:01.860
even if it is not the
true, earnest startup

00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:04.853
it so brilliantly
advertises itself as being.

00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:09.110
And if this is marketing
as much as reality,

00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:12.170
I do think there is something
significant to the fact that

00:29:12.170 --> 00:29:15.543
you can market the idea
of made in Detroit.

00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:20.750
That people, whoever they
are, and wherever they are,

00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:22.440
will want to buy it.

00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:24.690
That would not have
happened a few years ago.

00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:28.210
Even Chrysler, as you may have seen,

00:29:28.210 --> 00:29:30.510
has tried to market the same idea

00:29:30.510 --> 00:29:32.810
and at one point tried
an advertising campaign

00:29:32.810 --> 00:29:37.110
that referred to its cars
as imported from Detroit.

00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:39.750
Clever, although I don't
think it made much difference

00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:44.440
or led anyone to replace
their BMW with a Chrysler.

00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:47.990
That slogan morphed
into "America's import,"

00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:51.890
much more vague, even slightly ambiguous.

00:29:51.890 --> 00:29:56.140
And it should be noted,
minus the mention of Detroit.

00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:59.670
If sophisticated young
watch buyers and cyclists

00:29:59.670 --> 00:30:02.850
find the idea of made
in Detroit to be cool,

00:30:02.850 --> 00:30:06.053
the far bigger market of
automobile buyers does not.

00:30:06.940 --> 00:30:11.490
Chrysler's inability to duplicate
the Shinola marketing idea

00:30:11.490 --> 00:30:14.740
shows us, I think, that this
is all a kind of niche market

00:30:15.670 --> 00:30:18.340
and reminds us, as I said a moment ago,

00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:20.620
that whatever it is that
is happening in Detroit

00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:22.160
and however good it is,

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:25.500
it is far too marginal to the economy

00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:29.493
to truly turn around an entire large city.

00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:34.190
In reality, most manufacturing takes place

00:30:34.190 --> 00:30:36.090
far away from cities now.

00:30:36.090 --> 00:30:37.490
Some of it takes place far away

00:30:37.490 --> 00:30:40.180
from our entire country,
from our continent,

00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:42.910
and as we all know, has moved to Asia.

00:30:42.910 --> 00:30:44.810
Much of the industrial manufacturing

00:30:44.810 --> 00:30:48.510
that does still happen in
the US is in the south,

00:30:48.510 --> 00:30:50.600
where labor and other costs are lower

00:30:51.490 --> 00:30:53.860
and governments fall all over themselves

00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:57.913
to offer corporations
incentives to open factories.

00:30:59.260 --> 00:31:01.270
The questionable wisdom of that

00:31:01.270 --> 00:31:03.470
is a subject for another day.

00:31:03.470 --> 00:31:05.700
For now, let's say only
that it is unlikely

00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:08.920
that manufacturing will
return on a large scale

00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:11.973
to any large, established
city in this country,

00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:15.240
or elsewhere in the world,

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:18.320
and that cities need to find
another basis for their economy

00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:20.613
as they move forward.

00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:24.870
The vast growth of the financial
services, legal services,

00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:28.033
media, healthcare, and
educational industry,

00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:31.540
and they are all industry,

00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:34.570
suggest that these things
will be the city's salvation,

00:31:34.570 --> 00:31:37.000
since so much employment in these fields

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.223
is concentrated in urban areas.

00:31:40.090 --> 00:31:42.160
It's a reasonable assumption

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:45.570
and I'm not here today
to say that it is wrong.

00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:48.510
But I do worry nevertheless

00:31:48.510 --> 00:31:50.990
that the evolution of our
cities into service centers

00:31:50.990 --> 00:31:53.170
staffed by upscale professionals,

00:31:53.170 --> 00:31:55.660
clean and appealing though it may be,

00:31:55.660 --> 00:31:57.810
is also a reminder that
many of the elements

00:31:57.810 --> 00:32:00.120
we all like in our cities today

00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:02.990
exist at the pleasure of these groups,

00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:05.653
not to serve a broader
range of the population.

00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:08.460
These professional sectors,

00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:12.520
we can think of them as being
the very consumers of culture

00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:15.930
I was referring to a
couple of minutes ago,

00:32:15.930 --> 00:32:18.850
like to concentrate
themselves in urban areas

00:32:18.850 --> 00:32:22.370
but they do not do that because
they truly have to be there

00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:25.240
but because they like the aura

00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:27.253
of culture and urban activity.

00:32:28.090 --> 00:32:30.800
They seem to be rejecting
the world of the suburbs

00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:33.360
with its dependency on the automobile

00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:38.360
and its elevation of private
space above the public realm.

00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:42.290
They seem to favor the urban culture

00:32:42.290 --> 00:32:44.203
and the stimulation it brings.

00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:47.040
This is a good thing.

00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:50.193
It would be absurd to
argue that it is not.

00:32:51.150 --> 00:32:54.470
But, and there is always a but,

00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:57.730
the city does not exist solely for them.

00:32:57.730 --> 00:33:01.410
And that is another paradox
of our urban life today

00:33:01.410 --> 00:33:05.400
that the new economy of technology
and international finance

00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:10.400
requires an underside of low
paying jobs to sustain it.

00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:13.240
The cleaners, and the
cooks, and the bakers,

00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:15.350
and the drivers, and the chambermaids,

00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:17.800
and the nannies, and so forth.

00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:20.410
And that these people are paid

00:33:20.410 --> 00:33:23.020
at the very lowest end of the scale,

00:33:23.020 --> 00:33:25.760
meaning that there is
more and more disparity

00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:29.833
between incomes in the new
city of the 21st century.

00:33:31.130 --> 00:33:32.700
The immigrants who toil beneath

00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:35.080
the glittery surface of the new city

00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:39.680
and struggle to survive in
it are often hardly visible,

00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:41.710
in part because they almost invariably

00:33:41.710 --> 00:33:46.020
cannot afford to live anywhere
near the glamorous center.

00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:48.000
And that center, in many cities,

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.230
for all its life and bright, upbeat,

00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:53.900
don't we love the city energy,

00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:57.860
is, as urban cultures go, a bit too easy,

00:33:57.860 --> 00:34:01.890
a bit too homogenous, a bit too defined

00:34:01.890 --> 00:34:04.470
by this young urban professional class

00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:07.070
and by its even richer cousin,

00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:10.040
the international global rich,

00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:13.030
who invest in condominiums
all over the place

00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:16.510
and fly from New York,
to Abu Dhabi, to London,

00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:20.530
to Hong Kong, and Sao
Paolo, and back again,

00:34:20.530 --> 00:34:23.160
keeping the real estate markets hot

00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:26.690
but using cities less as true places

00:34:26.690 --> 00:34:30.290
than as concrete versions
of safe deposit boxes,

00:34:30.290 --> 00:34:33.303
places in which to safely stash cash.

00:34:34.170 --> 00:34:36.720
The real estate market
in many cities today

00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:39.280
is a product less of local needs

00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:43.060
than of international
economics, of currency markets,

00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:47.020
and the need for cash to have
an occasional place to rest

00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:49.533
as it washes across the globe.

00:34:51.690 --> 00:34:55.380
That is not necessarily
the healthiest basis

00:34:55.380 --> 00:34:56.863
on which to build a city.

00:34:58.350 --> 00:34:59.530
I would like to believe that

00:34:59.530 --> 00:35:01.500
the major buildings in our skylines

00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:05.320
exist as something other than
pure investment vehicles.

00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:07.490
Though buildings have always existed

00:35:07.490 --> 00:35:09.000
partially for that reason

00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:13.170
it has rarely been their
sole reason for being

00:35:13.170 --> 00:35:15.970
as it so often seems to be today

00:35:15.970 --> 00:35:19.100
when so many new buildings
seem to be physical embodiments

00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:21.580
of the movements of global capital

00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:23.913
that the cities themselves represent.

00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:29.320
The demand that so many
condominium towers fulfill,

00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:32.170
especially in New York and Hong Kong,

00:35:32.170 --> 00:35:34.520
but also in Vancouver, and San Francisco,

00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:36.783
and London, and Shanghai, and Moscow,

00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:40.950
is not the demand for places to live

00:35:41.810 --> 00:35:46.810
but the demand for places in
which to invest excess cash.

00:35:48.250 --> 00:35:51.400
Many of these places, as you surely know,

00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:53.280
are barely occupied.

00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:57.293
And while these buildings
now dominate the skyline,

00:35:58.170 --> 00:36:02.860
in New York, the very
latest 432 Park Avenue

00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:05.720
is taller than the Empire State Building.

00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:08.450
So I am not talking
about trivial structures

00:36:08.450 --> 00:36:09.543
that we can ignore.

00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:13.090
While these buildings
dominate the skyline,

00:36:13.090 --> 00:36:18.090
their occupants surely do
not populate the sidewalks.

00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:20.220
They add surprisingly little

00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:22.253
to the ongoing life of the city.

00:36:23.490 --> 00:36:26.380
Once their owners have enriched
the building's developers

00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:29.780
by purchasing their
apartments for vast sums,

00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:31.733
they seem to do little else with them.

00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:36.490
Jonathan Miller, a prominent
New York real estate appraiser

00:36:36.490 --> 00:36:39.970
put it best when he
called these apartments

00:36:39.970 --> 00:36:42.640
safe deposit boxes in the sky.

00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:44.950
Places where people put their valuables

00:36:44.950 --> 00:36:46.223
and then rarely visit.

00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:52.690
The city of such buildings
is not the city we aspire to.

00:36:52.690 --> 00:36:56.443
And it is surely not the creative city.

00:36:57.910 --> 00:37:02.910
It is booming economically but
is it healthy economically?

00:37:02.950 --> 00:37:04.320
By now we should know, I think,

00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:06.653
that these two are not the same thing.

00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:10.020
I think we've already seen

00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:12.160
that for all the short term good

00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:14.910
there is in rising real estate values,

00:37:14.910 --> 00:37:18.890
too much wealth is making
our cities less diverse

00:37:18.890 --> 00:37:21.630
and that it can sometimes
make them less energetic,

00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:25.530
not more energetic,
less the kind of places

00:37:25.530 --> 00:37:28.543
in which real creativity is inspired.

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:34.510
The city of zillion dollar
condos isn't making culture

00:37:34.510 --> 00:37:38.680
anymore than it is making
automobiles or anything else.

00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:40.940
It is just consuming it.

00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:42.960
And it isn't even doing very much of that

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:45.560
because its occupants aren't
there most of the time.

00:37:46.820 --> 00:37:49.400
I'm not entirely sure
what we can do about this

00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:53.970
because no city, no matter how
determined its leaders may be

00:37:53.970 --> 00:37:58.970
can control economic forces
that are increasingly not local,

00:37:59.610 --> 00:38:02.223
or even national, but global.

00:38:03.070 --> 00:38:05.440
But we can be more aggressive, I think,

00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:07.710
in seeking to limit the extent to which

00:38:07.710 --> 00:38:10.950
pure investment vehicles
dominate the skyline

00:38:10.950 --> 00:38:13.590
and squeeze out the very urban life

00:38:13.590 --> 00:38:18.590
that they claim, often
disingenuously, to be reinforcing.

00:38:21.299 --> 00:38:25.550
For a time, I used to worry
that the destiny of our cities

00:38:25.550 --> 00:38:29.500
was not to be derelict places
that no one wanted to visit

00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:31.580
as we feared a generation ago

00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:35.520
but places that everyone wants to visit

00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:37.470
but no one has to be in

00:38:37.470 --> 00:38:40.520
because they no longer
have an essential purpose.

00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:43.520
That in this age of urban infatuation,

00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:47.550
we are at risk of developing
21st century versions

00:38:47.550 --> 00:38:49.690
of Venice or Amsterdam.

00:38:49.690 --> 00:38:53.020
Wonderful, glorious places

00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:56.600
that exist mainly for
people to stroll around in

00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:59.413
and comment on how wonderful
and glorious they are.

00:39:00.870 --> 00:39:05.240
Now, that is better than the
South Bronx of the 1970s,

00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:07.690
of course, but that's not the point.

00:39:07.690 --> 00:39:09.130
The point is that we want the city

00:39:09.130 --> 00:39:14.130
to be more than just
entertaining, but necessary.

00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:18.310
I don't want the city to be a theme park,

00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:21.280
fun to walk around in when
you need to take a break,

00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:25.323
but not a place where real
life and real work take place.

00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:29.330
I do feel that even so
many of the good things

00:39:29.330 --> 00:39:31.800
we celebrate in cities today,

00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:35.450
the sheer joy of walking around,
the pleasures of shopping,

00:39:35.450 --> 00:39:37.430
the exhilaration of people watching

00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:41.383
and the visual variety that
always brings surprise.

00:39:42.330 --> 00:39:45.160
Even these things can
sometimes encourage us

00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:49.520
to think of the city only
as a thing for entertainment

00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:53.363
and thus make us dance on
the edge of the theme park.

00:39:54.750 --> 00:39:58.620
In the theme park, we only
consume, we never create.

00:39:58.620 --> 00:40:01.700
We look and we are entertained.

00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:04.440
We are safely away from
the stresses, and tensions,

00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:08.460
and forces by which things are made,

00:40:08.460 --> 00:40:12.150
the clashes and pressures
out of which culture

00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:13.753
and ideas come.

00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:19.380
As Charles Moore pointed out 50 years ago

00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:23.850
in his classic essay, "You Have
to Pay For The Public Life,"

00:40:23.850 --> 00:40:27.360
which foresaw all of this,

00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:30.570
Disneyland's popularity came in part

00:40:30.570 --> 00:40:33.670
because it satisfied the urban impulse,

00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:37.903
an impulse otherwise absent
in Southern California.

00:40:39.016 --> 00:40:41.400
It satisfied that urban impulse

00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:44.343
in a safe and contained way.

00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:47.610
Now, the theme park, of course,

00:40:47.610 --> 00:40:50.120
is supposed to be without challenge.

00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:53.030
And that is fine if we're on a playground.

00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:54.600
But the real city was never

00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:56.663
supposed to be without challenge.

00:40:57.760 --> 00:41:02.760
It ought to be at least
a little bit difficult,

00:41:02.890 --> 00:41:06.780
at least a little bit dirty,
at least a little bit messy.

00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:10.210
The city we celebrate today
often strikes me as too clean,

00:41:10.210 --> 00:41:15.113
too neat, too packaged,
too managed, too easy.

00:41:16.590 --> 00:41:18.440
If we think that kind of city,

00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:20.560
the city of shopping and entertainment,

00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:22.237
is a place out of which great culture

00:41:22.237 --> 00:41:24.810
and great creativity will come

00:41:24.810 --> 00:41:27.883
I fear that we will be sadly mistaken.

00:41:28.826 --> 00:41:31.620
Now all of that said,

00:41:31.620 --> 00:41:33.490
I don't want to fall into
the trap of believing

00:41:33.490 --> 00:41:36.750
that there ever was an ideal urban era,

00:41:36.750 --> 00:41:38.730
where creativity flowed

00:41:38.730 --> 00:41:41.250
and the forces of capital and of culture

00:41:41.250 --> 00:41:42.963
were in perfect equilibrium.

00:41:43.970 --> 00:41:44.970
It is useful, I think,

00:41:44.970 --> 00:41:47.800
to look back at Paris
in the mid 19th century,

00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:50.230
a time that we are
accustomed to thinking of

00:41:50.230 --> 00:41:52.203
as an era of great urban life,

00:41:53.210 --> 00:41:56.180
as a time when whatever the
complex political picture

00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:58.090
of Europe may have been,

00:41:58.090 --> 00:42:00.662
there was at least an urban culture

00:42:00.662 --> 00:42:01.900
that flourished and triumphed

00:42:01.900 --> 00:42:04.723
over both politics and capital.

00:42:06.430 --> 00:42:08.630
Well, think again.

00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:12.370
In fact, Paris' golden age,

00:42:12.370 --> 00:42:14.740
which did, in so many ways,

00:42:14.740 --> 00:42:19.740
define our sense of what
an urban place should be,

00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:24.040
was also a time of incredible
struggle over modernity,

00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:25.840
and real estate development,

00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:29.373
and tension between
financial power and the arts.

00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:35.520
Baron Haussmann, charged by the
emperor with updating Paris,

00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:39.570
which, in many ways, in the
middle of the 19th century

00:42:39.570 --> 00:42:42.080
was still a rather medieval city,

00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:43.370
cut through great boulevards

00:42:43.370 --> 00:42:45.680
and engaged in ambitious public works,

00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:50.680
and in so doing, defined the
Paris we know and love today.

00:42:51.060 --> 00:42:53.170
But he also threw neighborhoods,

00:42:53.170 --> 00:42:55.973
indeed the entire pattern
of the city, into turmoil.

00:42:57.270 --> 00:43:01.200
Progress was seen by most people then

00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:03.260
as the enemy of culture,

00:43:03.260 --> 00:43:06.750
as a set of forces that
were selling out the city

00:43:06.750 --> 00:43:08.620
to moneyed interests.

00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:10.830
And there seemed to be little room

00:43:10.830 --> 00:43:15.150
for artists, shopkeepers, craftspeople.

00:43:15.150 --> 00:43:18.103
Indeed, for workers of any kind.

00:43:19.740 --> 00:43:21.000
Let me quote, for a moment,

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:24.757
from TJ Clark's great study
of 19th century Paris,

00:43:24.757 --> 00:43:27.350
"The Painting of Modern Life,"

00:43:27.350 --> 00:43:29.537
in which he writes that, and I quote,

00:43:29.537 --> 00:43:31.677
"In place of the crumbling houses

00:43:31.677 --> 00:43:34.887
"where the tailors and the
coppersmiths had lived,

00:43:34.887 --> 00:43:38.927
"the builders of boulevards,
avid to recoup their costs,

00:43:38.927 --> 00:43:41.567
"had put up lavish blocks of apartments

00:43:41.567 --> 00:43:43.987
"with stone moldings,
and ironwork balconies,

00:43:43.987 --> 00:43:45.467
"and running water.

00:43:45.467 --> 00:43:49.057
"The rent of such places
were impossibly steep

00:43:49.057 --> 00:43:51.047
"and the rents of the
rest of the neighborhood

00:43:51.047 --> 00:43:53.330
"Followed them upwards."

00:43:53.330 --> 00:43:55.130
By Haussmann's own estimate,

00:43:55.130 --> 00:43:57.230
rents in the center of the city doubled

00:43:57.230 --> 00:44:00.040
between 1851 and 1857.

00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:02.513
And they went on climbing thereafter.

00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:06.140
The working class began to complain.

00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:08.680
It was argued that in place of one Paris,

00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:11.000
Haussmann has made two.

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:14.030
The accusation was linked
with the issue of high rents

00:44:14.030 --> 00:44:15.790
and the plight of those who had lost

00:44:15.790 --> 00:44:18.470
a place to live in the city.

00:44:18.470 --> 00:44:20.000
Haussmann, the critics said,

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:21.840
had built the Boulevard Malesherbes

00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:25.130
as a kind of thoroughfare for speculation.

00:44:25.130 --> 00:44:28.830
He had laid out the inhumane
avenues around the Étoile.

00:44:28.830 --> 00:44:31.950
This was the city of
courtesans and bull markets.

00:44:31.950 --> 00:44:34.740
Here was ostentation, not luxury,

00:44:34.740 --> 00:44:39.540
frippery, not fashion,
consumption, not trade.

00:44:39.540 --> 00:44:42.610
Observers agreed that
in some important sense

00:44:42.610 --> 00:44:45.350
the city was more inflexibly classed

00:44:45.350 --> 00:44:47.573
and divided than ever before.

00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:50.540
That one was entering the age of the

00:44:50.540 --> 00:44:53.323
residential district and
the industrial suburb.

00:44:55.490 --> 00:44:57.050
You don't have to dig deep

00:44:57.050 --> 00:45:01.453
to find an echo of this today
in contemporary San Francisco,

00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:04.980
where the pressure to make the city work

00:45:04.980 --> 00:45:06.550
for the needs of tech companies

00:45:06.550 --> 00:45:10.120
has led to equally bitter
battles over displacement

00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:15.120
and long public debates as to
who the city is actually for.

00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:17.910
But there's something
else that's going on here

00:45:17.910 --> 00:45:20.470
and it gets us right to
the heart of the role

00:45:20.470 --> 00:45:23.810
of the city as a so-called
creative environment.

00:45:23.810 --> 00:45:26.660
And that is the relationship
between San Francisco

00:45:26.660 --> 00:45:30.040
and the world of Silicon
Valley to our south,

00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:32.160
where it can sometimes
feel as if we are coming

00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:35.630
to have something akin to
the residential district

00:45:35.630 --> 00:45:39.090
and industrial suburb
that TJ Clark observed

00:45:39.090 --> 00:45:41.603
in Paris in Haussmann's time.

00:45:43.110 --> 00:45:47.010
Of course, Silicon Valley is
no normal industrial suburb.

00:45:47.010 --> 00:45:48.770
It is where more wealth has been created

00:45:48.770 --> 00:45:50.480
than anywhere in the world

00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:54.300
and where a form of creativity,
creativity in technology,

00:45:54.300 --> 00:45:59.300
flourishes even amid urban
sprawl, and as I said yesterday,

00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:03.170
a far more conventional suburban landscape

00:46:03.170 --> 00:46:05.323
than anyone there wants to admit.

00:46:06.750 --> 00:46:11.010
So if we fast forward from
Paris to our own time,

00:46:11.010 --> 00:46:12.780
which is the real model for a place

00:46:12.780 --> 00:46:15.650
that inspires creativity today?

00:46:15.650 --> 00:46:17.280
The example of Silicon Valley

00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:20.740
that suggests that traditional
cities are obsolete

00:46:20.740 --> 00:46:22.653
in an age of mass communication?

00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:27.423
Or that of ever more prosperous
and luxurious San Francisco?

00:46:28.620 --> 00:46:30.890
Actually, for that same
comparison I could have used

00:46:30.890 --> 00:46:33.750
the evidence of Silicon Alley,

00:46:33.750 --> 00:46:36.030
as people have been
calling Lower Manhattan,

00:46:36.030 --> 00:46:37.900
which now has a huge concentration

00:46:37.900 --> 00:46:39.520
of tech businesses itself.

00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:42.300
But I'll come back to that in a moment.

00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:44.440
Here in the Bay Area,

00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:46.930
what I find remarkable
is how many young workers

00:46:46.930 --> 00:46:48.780
in the tech industry today

00:46:48.780 --> 00:46:51.160
have no desire to live in the valley,

00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:52.633
even if they work there.

00:46:53.500 --> 00:46:56.090
They prefer to live in San Francisco,

00:46:56.090 --> 00:46:59.240
to be like the rich Parisians
who segregated themselves

00:46:59.240 --> 00:47:02.420
in Haussmann's luxurious city.

00:47:02.420 --> 00:47:04.050
Although in this case they are different

00:47:04.050 --> 00:47:07.010
from the rich Parisians who
never had to dirty their hands

00:47:07.010 --> 00:47:09.110
by going to the industrial neighborhoods

00:47:10.164 --> 00:47:12.460
since the young workers
in the tech industry

00:47:12.460 --> 00:47:14.190
are the very people powering

00:47:14.190 --> 00:47:16.533
the workforces of Silicon Valley.

00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:20.240
This, of course, is why

00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:21.980
all of the major companies in the valley

00:47:21.980 --> 00:47:25.160
now operate huge fleets
of private luxury buses

00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:26.760
that shuttle back and forth

00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:28.610
between San Francisco and the valley,

00:47:29.510 --> 00:47:32.610
sparing these privileged
employees the unpleasantness

00:47:32.610 --> 00:47:36.080
of a commute along the crowded freeway.

00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:39.480
As all of you who live here probably know,

00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:42.480
the buses are sleek, enormous,

00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:44.880
and unmarked except for
electronic lettering

00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:47.310
over the windshield
indicating which neighborhood

00:47:47.310 --> 00:47:49.740
in San Francisco the bus is bound for.

00:47:49.740 --> 00:47:53.103
Mission, Noe Valley, Castro, Potrero Hill.

00:47:54.080 --> 00:47:56.280
Most of them are white.

00:47:56.280 --> 00:47:59.160
The Apple buses, not
surprisingly, are silver.

00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:01.340
They carry bicycles, and
it goes without saying

00:48:01.340 --> 00:48:03.600
that they're Wi-Fi equipped.

00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:05.510
When an employee gets on
the Apple, or Facebook,

00:48:05.510 --> 00:48:07.470
or Google bus in the morning,

00:48:07.470 --> 00:48:10.593
he or she is considered to be at work.

00:48:11.720 --> 00:48:14.710
Google alone transports upwards

00:48:14.710 --> 00:48:17.860
of 3,000 employees a
day on its bus service

00:48:18.700 --> 00:48:21.010
which is now so extensive it ranks among

00:48:21.010 --> 00:48:24.850
the larger public transportation systems

00:48:24.850 --> 00:48:26.980
in the state of California.

00:48:26.980 --> 00:48:30.280
The buses have become a
necessity for Silicon Valley,

00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:32.890
not because they expand
the work day modestly,

00:48:32.890 --> 00:48:35.460
but because it was the
only way they could attract

00:48:35.460 --> 00:48:37.710
and retain workers who might otherwise

00:48:37.710 --> 00:48:40.563
have balked at the 40 mile commute.

00:48:42.270 --> 00:48:44.820
A 28 year old living in Noe Valley

00:48:44.820 --> 00:48:46.760
is more likely to be willing to spend time

00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:48.910
in a luxurious bus with Wi-Fi

00:48:48.910 --> 00:48:53.120
than to want to sit behind
the wheel of a car on 101,

00:48:53.120 --> 00:48:55.970
or to make his way to
downtown San Francisco

00:48:55.970 --> 00:48:59.930
to take a commuter train
that will deposit him

00:48:59.930 --> 00:49:02.260
at a station that is still likely to be

00:49:02.260 --> 00:49:04.483
several miles from where he works.

00:49:06.250 --> 00:49:09.970
Big intercity buses have become
the travel system of choice,

00:49:09.970 --> 00:49:14.010
so much so that Craigslist
ads for apartments

00:49:14.010 --> 00:49:16.297
now carry lines like,

00:49:16.297 --> 00:49:19.810
"Genentech, Apple, and
Google buses within a block,"

00:49:19.810 --> 00:49:21.290
which signals a location

00:49:21.290 --> 00:49:23.890
that is a lot more meaningful
to potential tenants

00:49:23.890 --> 00:49:26.563
than proximity to the
public transit system.

00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:30.900
Let me talk for a moment
about the growing preference

00:49:30.900 --> 00:49:32.900
of younger workers to live in the city

00:49:32.900 --> 00:49:34.870
since it represents a vast shift

00:49:34.870 --> 00:49:37.070
in the culture of the tech industry

00:49:37.070 --> 00:49:41.123
and its effect is only
beginning to be understood.

00:49:42.490 --> 00:49:47.490
Silicon Valley grew up
around a certain university.

00:49:49.070 --> 00:49:51.212
I don't remember what it's called.

00:49:51.212 --> 00:49:54.333
University of Paolo Alto or
something like that, I think.

00:49:55.690 --> 00:49:58.690
Which until a few years
ago seemed to have only

00:49:58.690 --> 00:50:02.290
the most tenuous relationship
to San Francisco.

00:50:02.290 --> 00:50:04.290
The law firms and venture capital firms

00:50:04.290 --> 00:50:06.550
that emerged around the tech industry

00:50:06.550 --> 00:50:10.070
located along Sand Hill
Road in Menlo Park,

00:50:10.070 --> 00:50:13.010
in quarters that were
posher than the startups

00:50:13.010 --> 00:50:15.440
but every bit as suburban.

00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:18.380
The Rosewood Sand Hill, the luxury hotel,

00:50:18.380 --> 00:50:20.360
whose restaurant is to the tech industry

00:50:20.360 --> 00:50:23.810
what Michael's in New York
is to the media industry

00:50:23.810 --> 00:50:25.910
is a sprawling low rise resort

00:50:25.910 --> 00:50:27.630
that looks as if it could be

00:50:27.630 --> 00:50:30.030
in a prosperous midwestern suburb

00:50:30.930 --> 00:50:33.770
but for the slight overlay of buzz

00:50:33.770 --> 00:50:35.420
that fills the dining room

00:50:35.420 --> 00:50:37.370
and the fact that the parking lot

00:50:37.370 --> 00:50:42.370
has more BMWs and Audis,
not to mention Teslas,

00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:44.710
than you would find in Kansas City.

00:50:46.300 --> 00:50:47.670
If you were a venture capitalist

00:50:47.670 --> 00:50:50.260
or corporate executive in that industry

00:50:50.260 --> 00:50:53.520
you were likely to live
in Atherton or Woodside.

00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:55.520
If you were a young software engineer,

00:50:55.520 --> 00:50:56.900
you lived in a garden apartment

00:50:56.900 --> 00:50:58.853
in Mountain View or Cupertino.

00:51:00.460 --> 00:51:04.723
And other than big events like
Macworld Expo and the like,

00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:09.080
much of Silicon Valley acted as if

00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:12.283
San Francisco were as
distant as Los Angeles.

00:51:13.830 --> 00:51:15.960
The high cost and limited availability

00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:18.530
of housing in the Silicon Valley towns

00:51:18.530 --> 00:51:19.690
may have had something to do

00:51:19.690 --> 00:51:21.690
with the gradual shift
towards San Francisco.

00:51:21.690 --> 00:51:23.370
But it's not as though housing

00:51:23.370 --> 00:51:26.150
were either plentiful or
cheap in San Francisco either,

00:51:26.150 --> 00:51:28.410
which of course, as all of you know,

00:51:28.410 --> 00:51:30.461
has long been one of the most

00:51:30.461 --> 00:51:31.294
expensive cities in the country.

00:51:31.294 --> 00:51:33.210
What is really fueling it

00:51:33.210 --> 00:51:36.080
is the much larger trend
that we've been talking about

00:51:36.080 --> 00:51:37.860
of younger professionals expressing

00:51:37.860 --> 00:51:40.130
a preference for urban living

00:51:40.130 --> 00:51:42.690
even after they start families.

00:51:42.690 --> 00:51:46.570
If the simplistic
phrase, "creative class,"

00:51:46.570 --> 00:51:49.620
does not explain everything
about the resurgence

00:51:49.620 --> 00:51:53.036
of older urban neighborhoods
all across the country,

00:51:53.036 --> 00:51:57.350
it does connect to why a 30
year old video game designer

00:51:57.350 --> 00:52:00.790
would now rather live in San
Francisco than Mountain View,

00:52:00.790 --> 00:52:01.840
whatever the commute.

00:52:02.750 --> 00:52:05.850
At this point, the tech
companies' bus services

00:52:05.850 --> 00:52:07.610
are not just a convenience.

00:52:07.610 --> 00:52:09.430
They're an essential recruiting tool

00:52:09.430 --> 00:52:11.720
for the valley's major employers.

00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:16.030
A piece of infrastructure on
which the massive exercise

00:52:16.030 --> 00:52:18.040
in reverse commuting that has come

00:52:18.040 --> 00:52:20.663
to define Silicon Valley depends.

00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:23.510
The connection between Silicon Valley

00:52:23.510 --> 00:52:25.580
and San Francisco seems to be deepening

00:52:25.580 --> 00:52:28.970
all the time, in unexpected ways.

00:52:28.970 --> 00:52:31.630
It's no longer a case
of city versus suburb.

00:52:31.630 --> 00:52:34.430
If anything, their traditional
roles have been reversed,

00:52:35.370 --> 00:52:38.470
since the valley, with
its big tech companies,

00:52:38.470 --> 00:52:42.070
now represent the region's
main economic engine

00:52:42.070 --> 00:52:45.920
while the city acts as the
place of entertainment,

00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:50.253
relaxation, socializing, and sleep.

00:52:53.050 --> 00:52:55.330
The journalist and blogger Ken Lane

00:52:55.330 --> 00:52:58.477
wrote not long ago in the
online journal The Awl,

00:52:58.477 --> 00:53:00.637
"San Francisco, with its leafy parks,

00:53:00.637 --> 00:53:03.227
"and charming roadhouses,
and distinct villages,

00:53:03.227 --> 00:53:04.607
"and restaurants,

00:53:04.607 --> 00:53:06.927
"and commuters fleeing
every morning to work

00:53:06.927 --> 00:53:10.777
"is the Brooklyn to an as
yet unbuilt Manhattan."

00:53:12.030 --> 00:53:16.033
Again it is the 19th century
Paris that Haussmann created.

00:53:16.890 --> 00:53:19.810
This city/suburb inversion is fascinating

00:53:19.810 --> 00:53:21.553
because it suggests that the city,

00:53:22.430 --> 00:53:27.240
to some extent, has already
become the magnetic artifact

00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:29.270
that exists to give pleasure,

00:53:29.270 --> 00:53:32.390
not to be a potent creative force.

00:53:32.390 --> 00:53:34.540
The valley's richest entrepreneurs

00:53:34.540 --> 00:53:37.030
have always seen San Francisco that way.

00:53:37.030 --> 00:53:40.860
Some of them bought houses
in Pacific Heights years ago,

00:53:40.860 --> 00:53:44.860
and some of the city's posh
districts, as weekend getaways,

00:53:44.860 --> 00:53:47.010
starting the inverted
pattern of looking at

00:53:47.850 --> 00:53:50.310
Silicon Valley's suburban landscape

00:53:50.310 --> 00:53:52.820
as the messy, work-oriented place

00:53:52.820 --> 00:53:54.770
you wanted to get away from

00:53:54.770 --> 00:53:59.003
and the city as the pleasanter
place to which you escaped.

00:54:00.380 --> 00:54:03.090
But the torrent of 20 and 30 somethings

00:54:03.090 --> 00:54:05.770
wanting to live in San
Francisco full time now

00:54:05.770 --> 00:54:07.920
is a much more recent development

00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:11.130
with its implications far broader

00:54:11.130 --> 00:54:12.730
than a few dozen billionaires

00:54:12.730 --> 00:54:15.930
buying fancy houses in Pacific Heights.

00:54:15.930 --> 00:54:19.250
It says a lot more about
how cities aren't essential

00:54:19.250 --> 00:54:22.593
as the kind of marketplaces
they once were,

00:54:23.709 --> 00:54:27.390
when you needed the city
as a place to do business.

00:54:27.390 --> 00:54:28.877
You can do business
anywhere, as we've said,

00:54:28.877 --> 00:54:32.850
and as the success of
Silicon Valley proves.

00:54:32.850 --> 00:54:34.960
But the things the city does offer,

00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:37.570
a lively, diverse environment

00:54:37.570 --> 00:54:39.860
full of visual stimulation, culture,

00:54:39.860 --> 00:54:41.860
food, and all kinds of people,

00:54:41.860 --> 00:54:44.670
is exactly what suburbs can't provide,

00:54:44.670 --> 00:54:46.970
even when they get as rich and successful

00:54:46.970 --> 00:54:48.793
as the ones in Silicon Valley.

00:54:50.990 --> 00:54:53.827
Kenneth Lane further said
in that article in The Awl,

00:54:53.827 --> 00:54:57.087
"As disappointed visitors
and new employees discover,

00:54:57.087 --> 00:54:59.977
"Silicon Valley is a
dull and ugly landscape

00:54:59.977 --> 00:55:02.487
"or low rise stucco office parks

00:55:02.487 --> 00:55:05.427
"and immense traffic-clogged boulevards.

00:55:05.427 --> 00:55:08.107
"The fancy restaurants are in strip malls.

00:55:08.107 --> 00:55:11.147
"There is nothing to do. Nowhere to go."

00:55:12.210 --> 00:55:14.080
That's surely why more and more startups

00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:15.760
and small to medium-sized companies

00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:20.070
are locating in San Francisco
instead of Silicon Valley.

00:55:20.070 --> 00:55:21.540
When I wrote about that phenomenon

00:55:21.540 --> 00:55:23.700
last year for Vanity Fair,

00:55:23.700 --> 00:55:26.310
it was clear that the city itself

00:55:26.310 --> 00:55:29.260
had become the most
powerful recruiting tool

00:55:29.260 --> 00:55:31.830
a lot of companies could ask for.

00:55:31.830 --> 00:55:35.170
The younger people want to be in the city,

00:55:35.170 --> 00:55:38.420
a veteran of Google who now manages

00:55:38.420 --> 00:55:40.383
public relations for Twitter told me.

00:55:41.890 --> 00:55:44.130
And if you follow the news across the bay

00:55:44.130 --> 00:55:48.290
with any degree of attention,
you know the story of Twitter,

00:55:48.290 --> 00:55:49.760
which has been based in San Francisco

00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:52.183
since it was founded in 2007,

00:55:53.210 --> 00:55:56.110
and which, when it decided
it needed new space,

00:55:56.110 --> 00:55:59.750
took over three floors in a vast,

00:55:59.750 --> 00:56:04.750
empty, art modern building,
originally a furniture mart,

00:56:05.940 --> 00:56:08.650
on a seedy section of Market Street

00:56:08.650 --> 00:56:11.960
not far from the San Francisco city hall.

00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:14.010
From the reaction in the neighborhood

00:56:14.010 --> 00:56:15.290
you would have thought it was Google

00:56:15.290 --> 00:56:18.120
and not Twitter that arrived in 2011,

00:56:18.120 --> 00:56:20.840
since within a few months of
the company's announcement,

00:56:20.840 --> 00:56:23.880
construction started on
two condominium towers

00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:25.670
on nearby sites.

00:56:25.670 --> 00:56:27.430
The rest of the old furniture mart

00:56:27.430 --> 00:56:29.500
was rented to other tenants.

00:56:29.500 --> 00:56:32.223
And some nearby buildings
went into renovation.

00:56:33.860 --> 00:56:36.590
Twitter had kissed the neighborhood

00:56:36.590 --> 00:56:39.650
and it went from being a frog to a prince

00:56:39.650 --> 00:56:41.343
inside of a few months.

00:56:43.180 --> 00:56:46.350
This has been controversial,
as you probably also know,

00:56:46.350 --> 00:56:48.470
since the rocket speed gentrification

00:56:48.470 --> 00:56:51.200
of this part of the city has been,

00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:54.733
to use the tech industry's
favorite word, disruptive.

00:56:55.780 --> 00:56:57.870
What it is disrupting, of course,

00:56:57.870 --> 00:57:01.310
is not other technology, but people.

00:57:01.310 --> 00:57:03.660
People who can no longer
afford to live there

00:57:03.660 --> 00:57:06.270
because their neighborhood is like a rug

00:57:06.270 --> 00:57:08.750
that has been pulled out from under them

00:57:08.750 --> 00:57:10.703
in what has seemed like an instant.

00:57:12.550 --> 00:57:13.960
This is all too reminiscent

00:57:13.960 --> 00:57:16.530
of Haussmann's remaking of Paris,

00:57:16.530 --> 00:57:20.253
and it is not good for the
diversity that the city needs.

00:57:21.450 --> 00:57:24.520
But I am inclined to feel
that it is ultimately

00:57:24.520 --> 00:57:26.860
worth it for the survival of the city

00:57:26.860 --> 00:57:29.350
because the coming of
much of the tech industry

00:57:29.350 --> 00:57:32.550
to San Francisco has also revived

00:57:32.550 --> 00:57:36.483
the city as a creative center
and made it a place of work.

00:57:37.380 --> 00:57:39.510
That's important for reasons that

00:57:39.510 --> 00:57:43.703
go far beyond the politician's
desire for tax receipts.

00:57:44.820 --> 00:57:47.780
Job creation holds the city back

00:57:47.780 --> 00:57:51.730
from the fate of sliding
into the beautiful,

00:57:51.730 --> 00:57:55.440
alluring irrelevance of Venice,

00:57:55.440 --> 00:57:58.360
or the equally beautiful and profound

00:57:58.360 --> 00:58:02.423
but no longer creatively
essential city, Amsterdam.

00:58:04.130 --> 00:58:06.580
Now I can see that there's a certain irony

00:58:06.580 --> 00:58:10.800
in saying that the tech explosion
keeps San Francisco real

00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:13.510
since I know that gaining this reality,

00:58:13.510 --> 00:58:16.960
the reality of having a
vibrant, creative economy,

00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:19.990
is coming at the cost of another reality

00:58:19.990 --> 00:58:21.883
which is the reality of diversity.

00:58:24.090 --> 00:58:27.683
That is increasingly the fate
of the creative city today.

00:58:28.540 --> 00:58:31.740
It is a struggle, a constant struggle,

00:58:31.740 --> 00:58:34.920
to balance a meaningful
and productive economy

00:58:34.920 --> 00:58:38.320
against the roughness, the grittiness,

00:58:38.320 --> 00:58:43.163
the complexity, the diversity,
of the city as its best.

00:58:44.520 --> 00:58:46.760
In the case of San Francisco,

00:58:46.760 --> 00:58:50.190
there is one particular benefit,

00:58:50.190 --> 00:58:52.780
or maybe we can say rationalization,

00:58:52.780 --> 00:58:55.660
which is that the most
powerful economic forces,

00:58:55.660 --> 00:58:57.510
those of the tech industry,

00:58:57.510 --> 00:59:00.290
are, by and large, creative forces,

00:59:00.290 --> 00:59:02.663
or at least partially creative forces.

00:59:03.870 --> 00:59:06.750
The game designers and
the software designers

00:59:06.750 --> 00:59:09.440
are not poets, and actors, and painters

00:59:09.440 --> 00:59:11.050
who need to work as waiters

00:59:11.050 --> 00:59:13.900
while they wait to make some scant money

00:59:13.900 --> 00:59:17.280
from the arts that they
are passionate about.

00:59:17.280 --> 00:59:21.500
Here the creative people are
part of the economic engine

00:59:21.500 --> 00:59:23.950
and that makes a tremendous
amount of difference.

00:59:26.140 --> 00:59:29.180
We could say the same for
the slice of New York,

00:59:29.180 --> 00:59:31.230
what is called Silicon Alley,

00:59:31.230 --> 00:59:35.290
since so many tech firms
have located there as well.

00:59:35.290 --> 00:59:38.760
And Google now has more
employees in Manhattan

00:59:38.760 --> 00:59:40.940
than anywhere in the world

00:59:40.940 --> 00:59:43.710
other than its headquarters
in Mountain View.

00:59:43.710 --> 00:59:46.710
That said, the creative
tech industry in New York

00:59:46.710 --> 00:59:49.960
is still overwhelmed by the
financial services industry

00:59:49.960 --> 00:59:51.913
which is still the economic bellwether.

00:59:52.910 --> 00:59:55.600
If you put these two things together,

00:59:55.600 --> 00:59:58.410
the huge financial services industry,

00:59:58.410 --> 01:00:00.683
and the growing presence
of a tech industry,

01:00:01.610 --> 01:00:04.930
you have a gargantuan market
for culture in New York.

01:00:04.930 --> 01:00:08.890
The largest in the nation,
and perhaps the world.

01:00:08.890 --> 01:00:11.070
And one that also includes

01:00:11.070 --> 01:00:13.800
another realm besides technology

01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:17.680
that is often mistakenly overlooked

01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:20.660
when people talk about
creativity in the city,

01:00:20.660 --> 01:00:22.510
which is the world of fashion design.

01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:26.323
But still, when you
put all of it together,

01:00:27.470 --> 01:00:31.150
you have an overwhelmingly
large market of people there

01:00:31.150 --> 01:00:33.030
who consume culture

01:00:33.030 --> 01:00:36.063
and want to live in a
so-called creative environment,

01:00:36.900 --> 01:00:41.423
only a very few of whom are
actually creating culture.

01:00:42.670 --> 01:00:44.890
This puts the cost of the city

01:00:44.890 --> 01:00:49.000
out of reach of almost
every artist, architect,

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:53.963
writer, dancer, musician,
film maker, and actor.

01:00:54.980 --> 01:00:56.730
And that is not getting any better.

01:00:58.810 --> 01:01:01.273
Where do these people go?

01:01:02.610 --> 01:01:05.220
For a while, as we said, it was Brooklyn.

01:01:05.220 --> 01:01:07.970
And now that Brooklyn too
has become so expensive,

01:01:07.970 --> 01:01:09.840
some of them, as I said a few minutes ago,

01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:11.003
are going to Detroit.

01:01:12.150 --> 01:01:14.070
Before we despair,

01:01:14.070 --> 01:01:17.140
let's keep in mind that the
universe of urban neighborhoods

01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:20.510
was once a lot smaller

01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:24.340
and that Brooklyn was a very
different place 40 years ago.

01:01:24.340 --> 01:01:27.460
We can all make jokes about
the artisanal food culture

01:01:27.460 --> 01:01:29.840
of Williamsburg, and the furniture makers,

01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:32.720
and fancy bars, and boutique hotels,

01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:36.210
but it is not, for the
larger life of the city,

01:01:36.210 --> 01:01:38.000
such a bad thing.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:41.000
And Williamsburg, like so
much of the rest of Brooklyn,

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:45.170
not to mention Jersey City,
and Hoboken across the river,

01:01:45.170 --> 01:01:48.100
and Harlem, and Manhattan,

01:01:48.100 --> 01:01:50.163
are better places than they were.

01:01:52.810 --> 01:01:57.230
It is the fate of creative people in part

01:01:57.230 --> 01:02:00.740
to find new places and to settle in them

01:02:00.740 --> 01:02:03.180
and begin a process of change

01:02:03.180 --> 01:02:06.400
that, in time, the mainstream adopts.

01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:08.220
We saw it in SoHo in New York,

01:02:08.220 --> 01:02:12.620
the mother of all urban
gentrification, 50 years ago.

01:02:12.620 --> 01:02:16.580
As the artists came in and
took over old loft buildings

01:02:16.580 --> 01:02:19.440
that had been abandoned by
the manufacturing industries

01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:21.610
for which they had been built

01:02:21.610 --> 01:02:23.343
but which no longer wanted them.

01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:26.950
A neighborhood of intense creative energy

01:02:26.950 --> 01:02:29.880
was built within what was one
of the greatest concentrations

01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:32.900
of historic architecture
in the United States

01:02:32.900 --> 01:02:35.223
and which had been all but ignored before.

01:02:36.140 --> 01:02:40.223
It was preserved, and
real estate values rose,

01:02:41.170 --> 01:02:43.900
at which point the artists
who made it all possible

01:02:43.900 --> 01:02:45.823
could no longer afford to be there.

01:02:47.370 --> 01:02:49.430
Now many of them, of course, in time,

01:02:49.430 --> 01:02:51.730
no longer wanted to be there

01:02:51.730 --> 01:02:54.210
since it had lost so much of its edge

01:02:54.210 --> 01:02:59.210
and become, in part, a shrine
to consumerism and chic,

01:02:59.750 --> 01:03:01.083
not to creativity.

01:03:02.763 --> 01:03:04.013
The edge moved elsewhere.

01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:09.780
Now I've just compressed a complex,

01:03:09.780 --> 01:03:13.520
decades long history into
a couple of sentences

01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:15.380
but it is basically what happened.

01:03:15.380 --> 01:03:18.000
And it does show us that
the process of urban growth

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:22.140
and change is one of constant movement.

01:03:22.140 --> 01:03:25.570
The edge is always moving elsewhere.

01:03:25.570 --> 01:03:27.890
Cities cannot be static.

01:03:27.890 --> 01:03:30.600
That, perhaps, is the
most important thing,

01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:32.610
that cities are living things

01:03:32.610 --> 01:03:35.000
and that for the city to
be a viable environment

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:39.150
for creativity, it has
to change and evolve.

01:03:39.150 --> 01:03:41.470
And the change will inevitably

01:03:41.470 --> 01:03:43.730
involve its most creative people

01:03:43.730 --> 01:03:47.590
because they are almost
always the people on the edge,

01:03:47.590 --> 01:03:49.893
and the edge always move.

01:03:51.750 --> 01:03:53.880
Creative people see new things

01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:56.550
which often means new places.

01:03:56.550 --> 01:04:00.140
They are frequently
not only on the edge of

01:04:00.140 --> 01:04:03.890
thinking and perceiving,
but on the economic edge,

01:04:03.890 --> 01:04:07.210
unable to afford the ever
more expensive center.

01:04:07.210 --> 01:04:11.080
But a lot of the time it
is driven by their vision

01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:13.470
and their willingness
to go outside of what,

01:04:13.470 --> 01:04:17.160
before that time, had been
considered the acceptable bounds

01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:20.770
of places to live, as they did in SoHo

01:04:20.770 --> 01:04:22.373
and in so many other places.

01:04:24.301 --> 01:04:28.683
I realize this can seem like
an excessively romantic view.

01:04:29.862 --> 01:04:31.990
I might also be taken as condoning

01:04:31.990 --> 01:04:34.870
much of what has happened
in the last generation

01:04:34.870 --> 01:04:38.200
that has put our greatest
cities out of reach

01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:41.053
of the creative people who
we need most to be in them,

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.410
since it the creative
people, the makers of art,

01:04:44.410 --> 01:04:46.540
and not just the consumers of it

01:04:46.540 --> 01:04:49.500
who keep cities from becoming theme parks,

01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:53.843
the places of artifice that
they often threaten to become.

01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:57.860
I'm not arguing for complacency here

01:04:57.860 --> 01:05:01.480
or suggesting that we do
not need to be proactive

01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:04.150
and fight to keep the city more diverse,

01:05:04.150 --> 01:05:07.063
both economically and culturally.

01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:13.560
We need, as we once did not need,

01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:18.560
to continually intervene
to maintain the very things

01:05:19.250 --> 01:05:22.360
that the city once created naturally.

01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:27.360
Jane Jacobs argued against
planners and politicians

01:05:28.620 --> 01:05:30.320
in the '50s and '60s

01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:34.200
because every time planners
and politicians intervened,

01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:38.300
she pointed out, they destroyed
that natural equilibrium

01:05:38.300 --> 01:05:41.053
of good urban neighborhoods

01:05:41.053 --> 01:05:44.430
that they considered blighted,
like Greenwich Village.

01:05:44.430 --> 01:05:47.160
Today, however, leaving it alone

01:05:48.486 --> 01:05:51.580
will no longer give us that diverse,

01:05:51.580 --> 01:05:54.470
balanced neighborhood in equilibrium.

01:05:54.470 --> 01:05:56.740
It's a paradox but it's an urgent one

01:05:56.740 --> 01:05:59.310
that today we must intervene

01:05:59.310 --> 01:06:02.813
to maintain what once, in fact,

01:06:04.170 --> 01:06:07.703
we needed to refrain from
intervening to protect.

01:06:10.070 --> 01:06:14.180
But so while I'm not at all
arguing for complacency,

01:06:14.180 --> 01:06:17.560
I'm merely trying to observe
that creativity in the city,

01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:19.250
like everything else, is subject

01:06:19.250 --> 01:06:22.080
to large, often global, forces,

01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:25.260
and that the artist,
as much as the banker,

01:06:25.260 --> 01:06:27.830
is inevitably part of a larger system

01:06:27.830 --> 01:06:29.430
that is not of his or her making

01:06:30.490 --> 01:06:34.603
and which brings both good
and bad things in its wake.

01:06:36.390 --> 01:06:38.840
We come back, in the end,

01:06:38.840 --> 01:06:40.940
to what makes the city work.

01:06:40.940 --> 01:06:44.920
And that is proximity, human contact,

01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:47.460
the ability to see each other,

01:06:47.460 --> 01:06:49.520
to be reminded at every moment

01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:52.640
that we are part of a large
and complex human endeavor

01:06:53.890 --> 01:06:58.050
which in the city is not
just a theoretical concept.

01:06:58.050 --> 01:06:59.990
It is something we see evidence of

01:06:59.990 --> 01:07:03.070
all the time in front of us,

01:07:03.070 --> 01:07:05.593
and I believe it affects us profoundly.

01:07:06.830 --> 01:07:09.090
The role of the city,
the role of any city,

01:07:09.090 --> 01:07:11.613
to put it as bluntly as possible,

01:07:12.570 --> 01:07:16.420
is to be a common place,
to be common ground,

01:07:16.420 --> 01:07:20.453
and as such, to support
us and to stimulate us.

01:07:21.690 --> 01:07:23.780
Lewis Mumford, the greatest

01:07:23.780 --> 01:07:26.940
architectural critic of the last century,

01:07:26.940 --> 01:07:28.990
gave us a description of the city

01:07:28.990 --> 01:07:32.520
that stands in stunning
and eloquent contrast

01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:34.890
to the argument that the city is outdated

01:07:34.890 --> 01:07:36.633
in our technological age.

01:07:37.517 --> 01:07:41.097
"Now," Mumford said, "the
greatest function of the city

01:07:41.097 --> 01:07:44.927
"is to permit, indeed
to encourage and incite,

01:07:44.927 --> 01:07:47.497
"the greatest possible number of meetings,

01:07:47.497 --> 01:07:50.117
"encounters, challenges,

01:07:50.117 --> 01:07:53.587
"between all persons, classes, and groups,

01:07:53.587 --> 01:07:56.387
"providing, as it were, a stage

01:07:56.387 --> 01:07:59.997
"upon which the drama of
social life may be enacted

01:07:59.997 --> 01:08:03.567
"with the actors taking
their turns as spectators

01:08:03.567 --> 01:08:05.957
"and the spectators as actors."

01:08:07.830 --> 01:08:09.870
Notice that Mumford spoke of the city

01:08:09.870 --> 01:08:12.410
not only in terms of
meetings and encounters

01:08:12.410 --> 01:08:14.810
but also of challenges.

01:08:14.810 --> 01:08:17.850
He knew that the city is difficult

01:08:17.850 --> 01:08:20.940
and did not attempt to pretend otherwise,

01:08:20.940 --> 01:08:23.423
to argue that it is the easiest route.

01:08:25.280 --> 01:08:28.710
But he knew that in meeting challenge

01:08:28.710 --> 01:08:30.950
there is also a kind of satisfaction

01:08:30.950 --> 01:08:33.280
that cannot come from easy routes

01:08:33.280 --> 01:08:35.310
and that the challenge the city represents

01:08:35.310 --> 01:08:38.963
can, at its best, be ennobling.

01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:44.100
And that is what fuels creativity today

01:08:44.100 --> 01:08:46.640
as much as it ever has in the past.

01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:48.963
Thank you.
(applause)

01:09:04.563 --> 01:09:06.313
Thank you. Thank you.

01:09:12.140 --> 01:09:13.720
- [Dean Wolch] Thank you so much

01:09:14.620 --> 01:09:16.220
for such a stimulating lecture.

01:09:16.220 --> 01:09:19.440
We do have time for some questions.

01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:24.420
And anyone who would like
to address Mr. Goldberger

01:09:24.420 --> 01:09:27.263
should come up right here to the front.

01:09:32.650 --> 01:09:34.130
- [Audience Member]
Hi, thank you very much

01:09:35.106 --> 01:09:37.400
for two very, very stimulating lectures.

01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:40.690
I wonder if I could turn
this around a little bit.

01:09:40.690 --> 01:09:43.460
I'm not sure I'm gonna be
able to get this out properly.

01:09:43.460 --> 01:09:46.000
One of the things that struck
me from the things you said

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:50.020
is that, in many ways, the
period which we romanticize

01:09:50.020 --> 01:09:55.020
as the heyday of the city
was in fact an anomaly.

01:09:55.060 --> 01:09:58.990
And I'm thinking of Thomas
Piketty's view of capitalism,

01:09:58.990 --> 01:10:02.490
and that the post-war boom, and equality,

01:10:02.490 --> 01:10:05.500
and suburbanization were
essentially an anomaly

01:10:05.500 --> 01:10:07.840
within the history of market capitalism.

01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:12.840
And back to your example
of Belle Époque Paris.

01:10:12.900 --> 01:10:14.670
I mean, just think of La bohème.

01:10:14.670 --> 01:10:16.443
The artists were all starving.

01:10:18.793 --> 01:10:19.937
In a funny way,

01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:24.200
you seem to be saying, or
it seems to be the case,

01:10:24.200 --> 01:10:26.460
that perhaps cities to succeed in the way

01:10:26.460 --> 01:10:28.440
we traditionally think of them succeeding

01:10:29.317 --> 01:10:31.058
requires substantial income inequality.

01:10:31.058 --> 01:10:34.710
Or it's inevitable that cities
will evolve in that direction

01:10:34.710 --> 01:10:36.940
which they seem to be doing.

01:10:36.940 --> 01:10:38.901
And I'd also like you to comment

01:10:38.901 --> 01:10:40.580
on the opposite side of this,

01:10:40.580 --> 01:10:42.560
which is the rise and fall of the suburbs,

01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:44.110
which is the other side of this.

01:10:44.110 --> 01:10:46.350
Which is during that period

01:10:46.350 --> 01:10:49.280
where cities were failing,
suburbs were booming.

01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:52.000
Now that income inequality has returned,

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.900
cities are booming and suburbs
look like they're headed

01:10:54.900 --> 01:10:57.700
towards poverty, really, ultimately.

01:10:57.700 --> 01:10:59.300
So it's an interesting question.

01:11:00.226 --> 01:11:01.167
- It's a very interesting question

01:11:01.167 --> 01:11:04.063
and not one easily
answered in a concise way.

01:11:05.324 --> 01:11:10.190
I think it's as difficult
to generalize about suburbs

01:11:10.190 --> 01:11:11.263
as it is about cities.

01:11:14.547 --> 01:11:17.490
Atherton and Woodside
are one kind of suburb

01:11:17.490 --> 01:11:21.443
and Richmond is another.

01:11:23.375 --> 01:11:25.990
And Berkeley, of course,
has its own rules anyway.

01:11:25.990 --> 01:11:26.823
It always has.

01:11:28.090 --> 01:11:29.890
And follows no patterns of any kind.

01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:36.380
I think many older, closer in suburbs,

01:11:36.380 --> 01:11:38.790
are in fact in great difficulty

01:11:40.019 --> 01:11:45.019
and are turning out to be, in many ways,

01:11:45.830 --> 01:11:50.750
the equivalent of a lot of
older inner city neighborhoods

01:11:50.750 --> 01:11:52.060
that have been gentrified

01:11:52.060 --> 01:11:54.690
and they're places where
immigrants live now,

01:11:54.690 --> 01:11:56.883
often in questionable conditions.

01:11:58.550 --> 01:12:02.090
We see that here. We see that
on the east coast, certainly.

01:12:02.090 --> 01:12:04.140
A lot of the small towns in Long Island

01:12:04.140 --> 01:12:08.193
that are beyond the
rich belt are now places

01:12:10.990 --> 01:12:13.913
that have a significantly
immigrant population,

01:12:14.950 --> 01:12:18.953
that are almost an
underclass, and so forth.

01:12:21.660 --> 01:12:26.660
You ask a profound and
profoundly difficult question

01:12:27.860 --> 01:12:32.660
about whether somehow it is necessary

01:12:32.660 --> 01:12:37.660
for the ongoing capitalist system

01:12:37.730 --> 01:12:40.793
for there to just simply
be economic inequality.

01:12:45.330 --> 01:12:47.580
I don't want to sound like an anti-Marxist

01:12:47.580 --> 01:12:50.403
but the answer might be yes.

01:12:55.420 --> 01:13:00.420
I think that the history
of cities is not one of...

01:13:04.180 --> 01:13:07.930
I'm wary of suggesting
an inverse relationship.

01:13:07.930 --> 01:13:09.780
Let's put it that way.

01:13:09.780 --> 01:13:13.780
I meant by my bringing
up Belle Époque Paris

01:13:13.780 --> 01:13:18.110
only to say that it
wasn't so easy then either

01:13:18.110 --> 01:13:22.560
and that in fact, underneath
that lovely surface,

01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:26.240
there were tensions
not nearly as different

01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:29.263
as we might think from the
ones we deal with today.

01:13:31.838 --> 01:13:36.838
I'm not gonna try to outthink
Thomas Piketty on this issue.

01:13:39.010 --> 01:13:42.253
And I'm not an economist, nor
do I wish to pretend to be.

01:13:44.449 --> 01:13:48.450
I'm an architecture and urban critic

01:13:48.450 --> 01:13:51.810
who is observing certain trends

01:13:51.810 --> 01:13:53.750
and trying to see how they connect

01:13:53.750 --> 01:13:55.523
to the physical form of cities.

01:13:56.920 --> 01:13:59.878
That's only a partial answer, I realize,

01:13:59.878 --> 01:14:04.100
but it's ultimately a
question that is itself

01:14:04.100 --> 01:14:05.800
a book someone ought to write.

01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:06.633
Yes, sir.

01:14:07.647 --> 01:14:09.321
- [Audience Member] Hi,
I live in San Francisco.

01:14:09.321 --> 01:14:10.154
And I have three questions.

01:14:10.154 --> 01:14:12.383
Feel free only to answer one.

01:14:13.290 --> 01:14:16.463
The homeless, minimum wage, rent control.

01:14:17.750 --> 01:14:20.100
- The homeless, minimum
wage, and rent control.

01:14:21.830 --> 01:14:24.620
That's another book.
(laughter)

01:14:33.210 --> 01:14:38.210
Rent control I think is a sort of

01:14:40.340 --> 01:14:44.740
desperate last ditch attempt

01:14:44.740 --> 01:14:49.470
to maintain a viable market--

01:14:49.470 --> 01:14:51.310
rather a diverse market

01:14:51.310 --> 01:14:56.310
in the face of the enormity
of the forces that we face.

01:14:59.314 --> 01:15:00.760
I'm not generally a fan of it.

01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:03.780
And I think it is in fact distorting,

01:15:03.780 --> 01:15:05.853
significantly distorting to the market.

01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:12.690
If the last few years
have taught us anything

01:15:12.690 --> 01:15:15.540
it's we cannot trust in the market

01:15:15.540 --> 01:15:16.973
to take care of everything.

01:15:21.150 --> 01:15:23.590
I will say yet again I'm not an economist.

01:15:23.590 --> 01:15:25.220
I know enough to know that

01:15:25.220 --> 01:15:27.653
the trickle down theory is not enough.

01:15:30.490 --> 01:15:34.690
Distorting and artificial
though rent control may be,

01:15:34.690 --> 01:15:37.730
I think it is one of those interventions,

01:15:37.730 --> 01:15:40.190
to use a word I used before,

01:15:40.190 --> 01:15:43.590
that is probably necessary today

01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:47.470
only because of the hugeness

01:15:47.470 --> 01:15:49.720
of the forces pushing
in the other direction.

01:15:50.590 --> 01:15:52.310
I wish it were otherwise

01:15:52.310 --> 01:15:54.310
because I do find it a sort of

01:15:56.760 --> 01:15:58.680
a force that in New York, certainly,

01:15:58.680 --> 01:16:00.573
has not always been a positive thing.

01:16:03.390 --> 01:16:06.280
But now that we see the other side of it

01:16:08.598 --> 01:16:11.780
and how troubling it is to see

01:16:11.780 --> 01:16:14.683
the city drained of diversity,

01:16:16.150 --> 01:16:18.720
I think we have to sort of grant that

01:16:18.720 --> 01:16:21.273
it is one of the fingers in the dike.

01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:29.880
Homelessness is a catastrophic
issue for our society.

01:16:35.420 --> 01:16:38.620
And the fact that it exists at all

01:16:38.620 --> 01:16:43.620
in a society of such
extraordinary prosperity right now

01:16:46.110 --> 01:16:46.943
is shameful.

01:16:48.060 --> 01:16:50.273
And that we do so little.

01:16:51.350 --> 01:16:54.100
And certainly nationally that
we do so little about it.

01:16:55.010 --> 01:17:00.010
In San Francisco the public
view is far more enlightened

01:17:01.670 --> 01:17:04.823
than in most parts of
the country, but even so.

01:17:07.300 --> 01:17:09.751
Minimum wage, we are--

01:17:09.751 --> 01:17:11.630
I'm the least qualified to answer

01:17:11.630 --> 01:17:14.113
because, as I said before,
I'm not an economist.

01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:19.820
I'm encouraged by the fact that

01:17:19.820 --> 01:17:23.240
several corporations
have sort of preemptively

01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:25.920
raised wages in the last few weeks

01:17:26.930 --> 01:17:31.930
recognizing that the
extent of income inequality

01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:33.870
has now become...

01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:37.607
The fact that they are capable

01:17:37.607 --> 01:17:40.360
of being embarrassed by
it I think is a good sign.

01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:44.216
I don't know ultimately how
much difference it will make.

01:17:44.216 --> 01:17:47.593
But it's a good thing that
things like that are happening.

01:17:48.550 --> 01:17:51.850
And I think the value of minimum wage

01:17:51.850 --> 01:17:55.620
is to create a degree of pressure

01:17:55.620 --> 01:17:58.210
that leads other things
like that to happen

01:17:58.210 --> 01:17:59.890
more than the wage itself.

01:17:59.890 --> 01:18:01.303
But we shall see.

01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:10.430
- [Audience Member] Good
afternoon and thank you.

01:18:10.430 --> 01:18:13.930
As I was listening I heard you talk about

01:18:13.930 --> 01:18:16.960
the tech workers, the tech companies,

01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:20.610
some allusions to the
residents in San Francisco

01:18:20.610 --> 01:18:22.870
who have been affected by that influx.

01:18:22.870 --> 01:18:25.260
But it was only towards the
very end of your remarks

01:18:25.260 --> 01:18:27.540
when you referred to interventions

01:18:27.540 --> 01:18:30.620
but without referring to city government.

01:18:30.620 --> 01:18:32.270
And I wonder what role you see

01:18:32.270 --> 01:18:36.140
for city government today
in managing the changes

01:18:36.140 --> 01:18:37.690
and challenges that you've described.

01:18:37.690 --> 01:18:42.160
And if you could, talk
about, refer to cities

01:18:42.160 --> 01:18:44.160
that you think have done
a particularly good job

01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:47.860
or a poor job in playing some kind of role

01:18:49.370 --> 01:18:51.990
in managing what we're experiencing today.

01:18:51.990 --> 01:18:53.490
- That's a very good question.

01:18:55.360 --> 01:18:57.990
I did not mean at all to suggest

01:18:57.990 --> 01:19:00.488
that there's not a role
for city governments.

01:19:00.488 --> 01:19:04.870
In fact, city governments are the most

01:19:07.340 --> 01:19:10.563
well positioned to be the agents
of intervention, let's say,

01:19:12.110 --> 01:19:14.650
now that we know that some degree

01:19:14.650 --> 01:19:16.113
of intervention is necessary.

01:19:21.470 --> 01:19:24.090
Cities that have done a
particularly good job.

01:19:24.090 --> 01:19:25.970
Well, let me go back to
the part of the question

01:19:25.970 --> 01:19:28.863
that involved types of things.

01:19:29.930 --> 01:19:33.640
I would like to hope that--

01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:35.960
As I said, I am not a
great fan of rent control

01:19:35.960 --> 01:19:39.170
even though I concede that it is probably

01:19:39.170 --> 01:19:41.513
a useful form of intervention today.

01:19:43.851 --> 01:19:47.010
The construction of
more affordable housing,

01:19:47.010 --> 01:19:49.583
the requirement of affordable housing,

01:19:50.707 --> 01:19:54.890
as connected to market rate housing

01:19:54.890 --> 01:19:57.640
and other kinds of profitable developments

01:19:57.640 --> 01:19:59.793
is a form of intervention.

01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:05.850
We see it in New York. We
see it here in San Francisco.

01:20:05.850 --> 01:20:10.823
Which are probably the two
most enlightened large cities.

01:20:19.600 --> 01:20:21.170
I think at the same time

01:20:24.848 --> 01:20:29.848
more willingness to
put certain constraints

01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:33.340
on other kinds of real estate investment.

01:20:33.340 --> 01:20:37.790
For example, in New York it is shameful

01:20:37.790 --> 01:20:42.580
that the zillion dollar high rise condos

01:20:42.580 --> 01:20:46.011
bought for global investment
that I was talking about,

01:20:46.011 --> 01:20:49.180
which sell for amounts of money

01:20:49.180 --> 01:20:54.020
several times that of what
had been, a few years ago,

01:20:54.020 --> 01:20:57.080
the most expensive apartments in the city,

01:20:57.080 --> 01:20:59.100
and that are mainly occupied by people,

01:20:59.100 --> 01:21:01.593
mainly bought by people
who don't occupy them.

01:21:02.970 --> 01:21:06.377
Somehow, through some loophole,

01:21:06.377 --> 01:21:09.250
we're given the right to take advantage

01:21:09.250 --> 01:21:12.150
of tax abatement laws that were passed

01:21:12.150 --> 01:21:15.160
to encourage the construction
of more affordable housing

01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:17.170
by abating them from real estate taxes

01:21:17.170 --> 01:21:19.573
for the first 10 or 15
years, whatever it is.

01:21:20.770 --> 01:21:24.520
Things like that are a
horrendous embarrassment.

01:21:24.520 --> 01:21:27.503
Correcting mistakes like that are good.

01:21:29.580 --> 01:21:31.970
There is no easy answer, in part because

01:21:33.660 --> 01:21:35.470
we're watching that now in New York

01:21:35.470 --> 01:21:38.910
where the new mayor, Mayor De Blasio,

01:21:38.910 --> 01:21:43.910
is far more, let's say concerned publicly

01:21:46.630 --> 01:21:48.710
about these issues
we've been talking about

01:21:48.710 --> 01:21:50.263
than his predecessor was.

01:21:52.180 --> 01:21:54.520
His way of dealing with it

01:21:54.520 --> 01:21:57.870
is not to discourage
development and growth

01:21:57.870 --> 01:22:02.870
but to encourage it and
in effect tax it more.

01:22:02.870 --> 01:22:05.870
Not literally tax it, although perhaps so,

01:22:05.870 --> 01:22:08.890
but to demand more from
developers in exchange.

01:22:08.890 --> 01:22:10.357
In other words saying,

01:22:10.357 --> 01:22:13.787
"I don't mind if you want
to build a 100 story condo.

01:22:13.787 --> 01:22:17.757
"It's just you're gonna make
100 affordable apartments

01:22:17.757 --> 01:22:20.230
"as part of the deal or
you don't build that."

01:22:20.230 --> 01:22:22.437
As opposed to his
predecessor who simply said,

01:22:22.437 --> 01:22:25.970
"You want to build a 100
story condo? Bravo, hooray,"

01:22:25.970 --> 01:22:27.263
and leave it at that.

01:22:29.070 --> 01:22:33.832
But that creates in turn
another problem which is that

01:22:33.832 --> 01:22:37.820
it may be that good planning

01:22:37.820 --> 01:22:41.280
suggests that we be more
limited and more restrictive

01:22:42.290 --> 01:22:45.360
on what gets built, period,
no matter who occupies it,

01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:46.610
no matter what it is for.

01:22:48.341 --> 01:22:52.840
I don't want to solve one
problem and create another.

01:22:52.840 --> 01:22:56.070
I don't want us to become indifferent

01:22:56.070 --> 01:22:59.260
to matters of physical
planning, historic preservation,

01:22:59.260 --> 01:23:01.600
neighborhood stability, and so forth

01:23:02.750 --> 01:23:07.750
just because we see in new development

01:23:07.970 --> 01:23:10.630
a goose that is laying
some wonderful golden eggs

01:23:10.630 --> 01:23:15.630
that we can use for wise and
valuable social purposes.

01:23:16.980 --> 01:23:20.471
That's why it's a very, very
complicated thing, I think.

01:23:20.471 --> 01:23:24.083
You push in here, and it
pushes up here, and so forth.

01:23:25.018 --> 01:23:28.190
It is not an easy thing to deal with.

01:23:28.190 --> 01:23:30.280
And as I said before,

01:23:30.280 --> 01:23:32.600
even the most socially responsive,

01:23:32.600 --> 01:23:35.600
socially activist city government,

01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:37.920
is still, at the end of the day,

01:23:37.920 --> 01:23:41.740
dealing with global economic
forces that it cannot control

01:23:43.050 --> 01:23:47.630
and wants to, to the extent possible,

01:23:47.630 --> 01:23:51.400
divert those forces to the
betterment of their city,

01:23:51.400 --> 01:23:52.770
as they should.

01:23:52.770 --> 01:23:55.170
But they can't turn them on and off.

01:23:55.170 --> 01:23:57.733
They can maybe channel them a little bit.

01:24:01.200 --> 01:24:03.140
Thank you all very much, again.

01:24:03.140 --> 01:24:05.793
- [Dean Wolch] Thank you,
Paul, very much indeed.
