00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Here's the command barchart, Height and Weight, and as I scroll down, I will find my bar chart

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:16.000
that shows pretty much how larger sizes was that in larger weights.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Now this chart would question whether it's exactly linear.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
You can see the distance over here to be significantly smaller than the distance over here

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000
but it's all approximate, and in reality, I can tell you the ratio between height and weight is not linear.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
But for the sake of the exercise, that's a better statement

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
than any of the other statements that I've given you.
