00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:02.828
That wraps up the first
iteration of Gift Maker.

00:00:02.828 --> 00:00:05.992
Now you have hard evidence of your
ability to read Objective C and

00:00:05.992 --> 00:00:08.039
migrate features to Swift.

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:09.060
Show off your skills and

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.598
get a few laughs by sharing the gifts
made with your app on social media.

00:00:12.598 --> 00:00:16.090
Next up, we'll make Gift Maker more
professional by adding the ability to

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:17.260
save and persist data.
