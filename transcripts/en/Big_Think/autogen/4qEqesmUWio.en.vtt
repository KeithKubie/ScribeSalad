00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.281
I love dogs as much as the next guy.

00:00:02.281 --> 00:00:03.760
I talk to dogs.

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:07.960
In preparing this book I spoke with dogs at
length.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:12.099
Maybe I spoke more to dogs than with them.

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:14.969
But they’re all dogs, that’s the thing.

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.300
I know we all love our kennel club show we
all go there.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:30.410
We obsess about whether our dog is a pug,
Jack Russell terrier mix with corgi overtones

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.259
and an oaky finish.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:34.940
An approachable little dog, whatever.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.579
They’re all dogs, okay.

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:41.929
And so the idea of a purebred is just a human
construct.

00:00:41.929 --> 00:00:47.070
There’s no such thing – in a sense there’s
no such thing as a purebred dog.

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.879
And that’s – I don’t have a problem
with that.

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:49.879
That’s the way it is.

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:55.399
By the way you talk to any veterinarian and
they’ll tell you that a mutt is a much healthier

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:00.749
dog generally because they have this mix of
genes, they’re not inbred, they haven’t

00:01:00.749 --> 00:01:04.660
made the same gene repeat too many times.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:10.080
And so it’s funny, it’s charming to me
but there’s a great lesson to be learned.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.690
Dogs are a descendent either from wolves or
from one ancestor before wolves.

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.580
But what you and I think of as a modern wolf
may or may not be the direct – what led

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:22.640
to a modern dog.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.690
People talk about this as I’m writing the
book.

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.250
In the next five years it will probably be
resolved.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.920
Somebody will come up with a definitive answer
to that.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.730
But anyway, apparently these experiments were
done with foxes which are just the coolest

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:45.530
thing where the foxes that were friendlier,
that they were more comfortable around people,

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.280
they were allowed to approach, they were allowed
to use human food.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:56.240
After just three generations they had floppy
scritchable ears and they were much more like

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.280
dogs.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:03.860
And it just shows you that dogs are almost
certainly a result of a human wolf ancestor

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.230
interaction.

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:10.310
As we became friends with them they became
friends with us and we have a dependency that’s

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:11.310
charming.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.350
It’s enriched both the dog lives and the
human lives.

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.840
It’s really quite an insight and it’s
a result of evolution.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:25.060
The other lesson to be learned from dogs for
me is since they’re all dogs it’s just

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:33.600
– if you have a dachshund and a Great Dane
and they interact, can we say interact on

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.120
Big Think?

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.530
If they interact all you get is a dog.

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.310
You don’t get any new thing, new species,
you just get a dog.

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:53.120
In the same way if a Papua New Guinean hooks
up with a Swedish person all you get is a

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.120
human.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.180
There’s no new thing you’re going to get.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.180
You just get a human.

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:04.300
Japanese woman jumping the African guy, all
you get is a human.

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.450
They’re all humans.

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.790
So this is a lesson to be learned.

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.819
There really is, for humankind there’s really
no such thing as race.

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:16.020
There’s different tribes but not different
races.

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.410
We’re all one species.
