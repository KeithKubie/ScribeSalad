Speaker 1:          00:00          Jocko. Have you ever had a person you couldn't get through to someone that you couldn't manipulate? Then what? What do you do when you can't get through? Well, yeah, of course. Um, I've had people that I could not get through to and generally speaking, these people, I like level 12 arrogance. That's what they are. Giant ego. That's what causes this. There was quite a few seal leaders that I dealt with. I shouldn't say quite a few. There were several seal leaders that I dealt with that were like that and have several business leaders that I've dealt with that I would like that. In podcast number five, I read that counseling letter, corrective measures to a guy that was really arrogant and despite that letter, he did not change and he got fired. So what do you do when you got someone that you can't get through to you?

Speaker 1:          00:54          You fire them. What if they're, if, and here's what you gotta do is what makes that tricky is that some people, and this May this, this make people freak out. There's some people that is such good performers that even though they're slightly negative on maybe their team participation, but they're so good that that offsets their negativity, right? And that happens. It happens. You know what happens with sales people, sales people are, are in order to be in a sales position, you gotta be confident. You gotta be aggressive. You've got to be somewhat arrogant, right? You got to believe in yourself. And so some salespeople take that to the extreme where they're just like, I don't need to listen to what you're telling me. The new procedures are, screw that. I'm the one that's doing the big dollars over here. How much you follow my procedures, boys, right?

Speaker 1:          01:43          So, so that happens. Well then what you gotta do is you've got to look, does, is this guy producing so now that can create problems within their team. And you have to balance those things. Is this guy, uh, is the negative media, is creating offset by the awesome productivity that he's doing. And furthermore, if the guys that good, hey, maybe we should be modeling some things after them. I got no problem with that. If you're the best performer, cool. I want to imitate you. I want to get my people to imitate you. So that happens at the other place where you might see it. A similar situation is a leader that does really good with their relationships down the chain of command, for instance, but really has bad relations up the chain of command. So again, you've got to ask yourself, okay, if I fire this leader, how many of these people that he has great relationships are now going to leave?

Speaker 1:          02:34          And what kind of detriment is that to the team? The that can also happen with someone that's doesn't debt tweets their people like crap, but up the chain of command, everyone thinks he's great and end. He's getting the mission done by the way, right? He's a slave driver and he's creating total animosity between him and his team, but he's accomplishing the mission. So now what do you do? There's risk. Everyone could quit, there's rescue could fire them, and now you don't accomplish the mission anymore. This is why leadership is hard and this is why you have to balance everything. You have to balance those things, but talked about it a bunch of times. If you get someone, you coach them, you mentor them, you do everything you can, you have flank them, you do Jujitsu, mental Jujitsu on them, you try and get them squared away and eventually if you can't, you weigh against, you know, how it's gonna affect the situation. And then in many cases you got to let them go. And we fired, you know, we fired five, saw plenty of seals, get fired from leadership positions. Um, and, and same thing with, you know, obviously you work with consulting businesses. We see all kinds of people getting fired because they're either not capable of doing their job, they're too arrogant and they don't recognize that things are going sideways and they're just thinking that they're doing everything perfectly. No, that's not gonna work out well for you. Hmm.

Speaker 1:          03:55          Yeah. What did, um, I think his life, he said no, someone asked him, uh, you know, when do you know, when's that line where it's like, when it's time to fire someone. And he was like, in a nutshell, there's a lot to it, but in a nutshell, which I thought was dope. Um, he said it's, you know, you're at that point when we were, you fire someone when, um, when you don't feel bad about it, right? So it's like, yeah, you, you every tried everything. And, and there's also people boots, there's some validity to this that say the first time you think you should fire someone, you should fire them. That's the other end of the spectrum, right? And what that means is when you're looking at someone and you're going, man, okay, I can save them, I can help them. That's the kind of advice you'd give to someone.

Speaker 1:          04:40          That's, that's a, that's got a maternal instinct, right? That you meet someone, Hey, I know what this guy is just a good guy and everyone on my team is great and everyone's going to do a great job. You can't tell that person what Lafe and I normally tell people, which is when you feel good about it, you should fire him because that person will never feel good about firing anybody just to ball. Okay. See what I'm saying? Cause he just said, done this guy. I know he's going to make it. He's, no, he's going to come around, you know I, and then they, then they start playing the, the extreme ownership game, which is, you know, if I would've given echo a better direction, he would have been able to do this. It's my fault. I've given an echo 17 re iterations of this and he still didn't complete it correctly.

Speaker 1:          05:19          He's fired. That's the way it works, right? There's, yeah. So the balance, so that spectrum of, of, you know, being within the confines of being justified, firing somebody, a certain type of person, you got to say when you don't feel bad about it. Right, right. I mean, that's like a fire heavy type dude. Right. But there's also someone, the reason you shouldn't feel bad about it is because I've done everything I can do to help you, which takes work. It takes effort. It takes tact. It takes hard conversations because it's hard for me to go and say, Echo, you know, I've been, I've been looking at your videos lately and they're, they're not really what we're looking for, right? And I don't want to say that to you. You know, it's uncomfortable. And we're kind of like, you know, we, we, we want to get along.

Speaker 1:          06:04          So instead I'm like, yeah, I called that. That video was good, man. Yeah, it's good, but I'm not telling you the truth. And then over time, our videos are looking good enough. And eventually I said, you know what? No, we're not. No one's buying our videos anymore and we haven't gotten a new contracts. So guess what? I'm going to have to let you go. And you're like, well, you're talking about, you said all the videos I made were good. No, you're firing me. Maybe you need to be able to become a better salesperson. Right? Whereas if I had the hard conversation early and said, hey, echo, you know, I know you're creative and I appreciate that, but we also need to get the message across for our clients. Um, obviously fabricating of business where we're making videos for clients, which I know we don't really do a lot of anymore.

Speaker 1:          06:43          Occasionally you do. But uh, but yeah, you got to, you got to, um, have the harder conversations earlier. If I'm the type of person that doesn't like to have the hard conversations, once again, I never feel good about it because I never, I never gave you any advice. So it always feels bad for me to fire someone. Yeah. But if you're following good leadership tactics, then absolutely true. When you get to a point where you gotta fire somebody, you won't feel bad about it because you know, you've done everything you can, you know, you've coached and mentored them and you know that if you keep them on board, you are negatively impacting your team, which is bad. Yeah. And then go down to the other side of the spectrum still within the confines of being justified in firing somebody, by the way. But on the other side of the spectrum, you get how you say that, what do you call the month maternal instinct type of person.

Speaker 1:          07:34          The person who can, like, they're just super hard on themselves maybe, or they're, you know, like I even if you did do everything you can, you still like, I could have done more, you know, so it's my fault, not his kind of feel like I let them down as a leader gave them 17 counseling chits. Yeah. You know, they don't belong here. They can't do their job stop. Yeah. Meanwhile they're going home laughing at you or whatever. But yeah, you get that kind of personality. So it's kind of like how you say, you got to balance it. You gotta be like, okay, you gotta recognize, okay, what kind of person am I, you know? Or what kind of person is this other person kind of thing. And if they're those maternal instinct jewel for lack of better way of putting it a person, then what was it the first time you feel like you should fire him, you should fire him. You hang out on that side of the spectrum. You've got it. Yup. Yeah. Yup.
