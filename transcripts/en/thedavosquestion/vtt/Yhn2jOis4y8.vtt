&gt;&gt; Regarding health care, I think not only
should be [INAUDIBLE] but

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.460
also the pharmaceutical company have a duty
to provide medicine where

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.900
it's needed in country that can't afford to
buy those medicine.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.119
Because, any where they don't consider a market,
and there is need.

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:20.570
For instance HIV treatment in places like
Nepal or whatever where I

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.519
live to follow treatment will be 2, 3 months
of waiting every month.

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:28.949
So it's impossible.
So that's why there's a duty from the manufacture

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.500
companies, also, to
provide at a price that can be afford.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.230
So that's a human duty and that's would be
also extraordinary to

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.690
express the sense of global responsibility.
