00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.950
- Managing a project is
something that, like group work,

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:14.640
can't just be accomplished easily.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.820
A lot of people think
that we'll just create

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.410
and do something and that's a project.

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:19.890
In order for it to be successful,

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.890
any teacher that's tried to do something

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.100
that has a lot of
student choice and agency

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.850
and takes multiple iterations,

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:27.940
they know that there's
a level of management

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.590
that needs to be there for
students to be successful.

00:00:37.037 --> 00:00:38.620
[Students Chatting]

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:41.630
- 20 minute work session,

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.790
needs to have some structure to it.

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.310
So I want to make sure
everybody's got a meaningful job

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:48.440
during these 20 minutes.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.830
Would each of you quickly
go around the table.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:52.730
There's kind of this
constant communication

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.600
going on between all the stakeholders.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.950
I have all my students use
SCRUM everyday in class

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:59.590
when they're working on a larger project

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:01.590
and they've got a group
that they're working with.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.067
We use a poster to visualize it.

00:01:03.067 --> 00:01:06.740
And the SCRUM meeting always
begins as three questions.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.490
Every member shares without
taking too much time,

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.112
what have I accomplished
since the last meeting?

00:01:12.112 --> 00:01:15.720
What am I going to work on
between now and our next meeting?

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.810
And what issues or concerns do I have

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.310
about the project currently?

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.330
And if you would take
one of the Post-it Notes,

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.240
put your name on it, and
move it over to in progress.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.520
- So this is a SCRUM poster.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.200
It's basically just a poster
that helps us visualize

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.550
what we're doing and
what needs to get done.

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:32.530
- [Johnny] The posters typically

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.050
have the defined product features.

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.000
And then another column for things

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.140
that still need to be done.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.880
- For our lander, we
have this section PBIs.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.490
It stands for project backlog interface.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.100
It's pretty much just all the details

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.350
and different design
choices that we want to put

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:49.183
on the lander.

00:01:49.183 --> 00:01:52.370
A third column is the
tasks that are in progress.

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.830
And when one of us actually
starts working on it,

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.560
we put it in the in-progress section.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.246
Then maintaining is just
after you finished it,

00:01:59.246 --> 00:02:01.320
you know that it's not just something

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.050
that you're gonna take off or something.

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:04.770
It's staying with the design.

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.840
- So we can work on the
parachute and the airbags.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.880
- Okay, so out of the stabilizing legs,

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.560
that we're definitely keeping.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.772
Oh, there's the reinforced
attachment posts.

00:02:14.772 --> 00:02:15.772
- And I dig.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.710
- I think that one of the nice things

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.760
about having students
practice and get good

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.840
at this SCRUM meeting is that
it gives students language

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.100
to hold each other accountable,

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.330
as one of the pitfalls of group work

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:30.960
that I think most teachers could identify,

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.670
that you've got one motivated student

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:33.650
that's gonna do all the work

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.710
while the other students kind of suffer.

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.260
Having the SCRUM poster
there is an easy tool

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.760
for the group members themselves

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.270
to really update and assign tasks

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.210
that need to be done so
that a far share of labor

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.440
can be spread out over the entire group.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.360
So I'm gonna interrupt.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.440
Just make sure that when
you guys own the task,

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.500
what you're gonna do, make
sure I see a Post-it Note

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.150
with your name and the in progress

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.750
before you start doing any work.
