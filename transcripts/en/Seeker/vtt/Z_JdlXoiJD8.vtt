00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.309
Cheetah's populations are declining because
they're fast, but they're not the smartest

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:22.900
cat in the box.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.560
Ever since I was a kid, I loved the cheetah.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.750
It's definitely one of my favorite animals
on our planet.

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.529
Cheetahs are speedy, as you probably know.

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:33.430
They can hit top speeds of 70 to 75 mph (112
to 120 kph).

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.370
They live mainly in Africa, though they can
also be found in the Middle East.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.050
Cheetahs are notoriously difficult to breed
in captivity, and don't rebound from population

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.890
destruction very easily.

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.860
In 1900, the cheetah population was around
100,000.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.710
Today it's more like 10,000 and YES we are
to blame, climate changes, habitat destruction,

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:52.710
the whole 9 yards.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.650
We're seriously screwing up this planet but
hey that's not the important thing here, is

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:57.650
it?

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.320
By some measures, cheetahs are doing this
to themselves.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.970
Researchers from three continents worked together
to learn more about how the cheetah is contributing

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:09.430
to its own demise -- their paper in the journal
Science is titled, "Cheetahs never prosper."

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:10.610
// LOL good one, guys.

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.400
It all comes back to their speed.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.690
Cheetah evolution has afforded them super
speed, but not much else.

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.920
They don't have the heaviest claws or the
strongest defenses.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.510
Their defensive play is the same as their
offense, they run.

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.320
Once they've made a kill, they don't really
defend it.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.320
C'mon cheetahs!

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.320
What are you doing, man!

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.500
There's no playground mother to tell, you
just gotta get in there!

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:36.370
Hyenas and lions take advantage of their packs
and strength to steal kills from cheetahs,

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:41.700
driving the zippy kitty away; forcing it to
expend even more energy looking for a new

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:42.700
meal.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.840
According to the researchers, the energy a
cheetah uses to make a single kill is QUOTE

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.610
"relatively small, even taking into account
their bursts of speed.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.080
[Instead],the biggest driver of energy expenditure
for cheetahs turned out to be the distance

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.280
they had to walk in order to find their prey."

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.170
Because their kills weren't being defended,
cheetahs aren't able to regain the energy

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.979
they'd lost looking for a new catch.

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.280
You might be thinking, DAMN THOSE LIONS AND
HYENAS.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.229
Stealing the cute little cheetah's foodâ€¦.

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.170
But that's not the REAL problem.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.700
The problem is these cats have to trek across
farmland, and around fences or walls.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:17.700
Yeah.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.090
It's humans again.

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.819
Cheetahs are walking themselves to death in
order to find safe hunting grounds.

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.870
Remember how I said it wasn't about us this
time?

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:26.870
Yeah, I lied.

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:27.870
We're the problem again.

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.510
Added to that, the cheetah is pretty easy
to tame and has now become a luxury pet in

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:31.510
the Middle East.

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.879
It is possible to tame cheetahs and have them
walk on a leash and play safely with humans,

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:39.330
and ancient African royalty would take them
as hunting pets.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.209
Because of this, poachers steal the cheetah
cubs, further increasing their level of population

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:45.209
decline.

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.159
We're awful.

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:50.680
How does this make you feel?

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:51.879
Want to do something about it?

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:55.650
Last year for Discovery's company-wide volunteer
day, I went to the National Zoo to help clean

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.109
the cheetah pens, just for a chance to get
close to one.

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:03.739
They're HUGE, like, Great Dane sized, and
if you get a chance to volunteer with your

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:04.739
local zoos you should.

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:08.470
It's rewarding, and can really help understand
the impact humans are having on these beautiful

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:25.409
animals.
