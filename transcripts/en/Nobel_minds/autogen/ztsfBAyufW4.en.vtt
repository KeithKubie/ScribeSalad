and so we had to control radioactivity

00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:54.420
and so we had to control radioactivity
 

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:58.079
and so we had to control radioactivity
extremely carefully in order to be sure

00:10:58.079 --> 00:10:58.089
extremely carefully in order to be sure
 

00:10:58.089 --> 00:11:00.329

that we were not seeing a false signal
 

00:11:00.339 --> 00:11:02.879
that we were not seeing a false signal
from that radioactivity and therefore we

00:11:02.879 --> 00:11:02.889
from that radioactivity and therefore we
 

00:11:02.889 --> 00:11:04.259
from that radioactivity and therefore we
went to great lengths to control

00:11:04.259 --> 00:11:04.269
went to great lengths to control
 

00:11:04.269 --> 00:11:07.079

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:00.730
in at the heavy water in the central
 

00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:03.600
in at the heavy water in the central
region because we were restricted to

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:03.610
region because we were restricted to
 

00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:06.780
region because we were restricted to
have everything in a mine cage which was

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:06.790
have everything in a mine cage which was
 

00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:09.990
have everything in a mine cage which was
3 meters by 3 meters by 4 meters and so

00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:10.000
3 meters by 3 meters by 4 meters and so
 

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.720
3 meters by 3 meters by 4 meters and so
this detector had to be very modular and

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:12.730
this detector had to be very modular and
 

00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:14.600
this detector had to be very modular and
then reconstructed

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:14.610
then reconstructed
 

00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:18.530
then reconstructed
on site so we looked in with these

00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:18.540
on site so we looked in with these
 

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:20.470
on site so we looked in with these
lights this light sensor array at the

other than the heavy water sphere with
 

00:14:31.439 --> 00:14:33.859
other than the heavy water sphere with
ultra pure light water and that was

00:14:33.859 --> 00:14:33.869
ultra pure light water and that was
 

00:14:33.869 --> 00:14:36.699
ultra pure light water and that was
housed in a watertight and radon gas

00:14:36.699 --> 00:14:36.709

dust on that entire structure then you

00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:30.480
dust on that entire structure then you
 

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:34.220
