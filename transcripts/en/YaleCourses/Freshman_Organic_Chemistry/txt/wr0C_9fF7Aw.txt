Speaker 1:          00:01          Last time we heard about the uh, some medical considerations regarding stereochemistry and we're going to just start today with a little bit about legal considerations about Stereo Chemistry. Uh, first, uh, uh, the doctor gave a disclosure last time about her connections, so I'll do the same thing. I've served as a scientific consultant or expert witness to a number of farms, pharmaceutical companies including Asi, which is how I knew about that. Seven, three, eight, nine, I take Lipitor and served as an expert witness for a generic competitor in a case involving the validity of a Canadian lip atar patent by Pfizer. And my only connection to Astrazeneca and a members all his is an occasional consumer of [inaudible] sec. Okay. This book here is very heavy. It's about the stereochemistry of organic compounds and interestingly, it's from 1994. So it's, it's all, it's less than 15 years old.

Speaker 1:          01:02          It's still the Bible and only eight pages of it are about biological properties. And just one of those pages had anything to do with legal things which had to do incidentally with cocaine. It turned out that somebody was on trial for cocaine. And the, the defense had the idea that the, uh, that the prosecution did not tested the cocaine to see which he auntie Maria. It was as to whether it was, it was, uh, uh, artifice might've been artificial because the Ian antitumor of cocaine, there's no law against. It also wouldn't work. But anyhow, they hadn't tested it so they thought they could get their client off. I didn't actually look up the case to see whether they got off or not, but that's an interesting stereo chemical application. But one that made a big difference was the court rejecting a suit about Nexium marketing.

Speaker 1:          01:55          We saw last time and you did a problem for today about, uh, about Nexium and whether the advertising seemed convincing to you or fair for that matter. There was a big, uh, suit about that and this in 2005 was a news report about that a federal court in Delaware dismissed the class action lawsuit alleging Astrazeneca had misled, had, had, had misleading marketing of Nexium and thus added billions to healthcare costs. And the district court judge, Sue Robinson rejected the suit brought by the Pennsylvania employee benefit trust fund on behalf of entities that foot the bill in health care plans according to the health plan paying organizations. The big difference between the two drugs is not effectiveness but advertising. So you presumably looked at some of this and have your own opinion about that by selling doctors and patients on the idea that patented Nexium is better than prior lasek which face generic competition, Astrazeneca was able to preserve billions in sales.

Speaker 1:          02:59          So for example, the year Nexium was introduced the, their, their marketing, their advertising budget was $260 million. And in 2005 it had declined slightly to $226 million, but the sales were five point $8 billion. So the advertising was negligible compared to the cost of advertising. Judge Robinson said the courts should defer to the u s FDA in weighing the differences between drugs and that since the FDA cleared nexiums label, the lawsuit could not stand. So That's interesting. And shows the importance of the FDA. Okay. Back to chemistry now, uh, in order to market Nexium, the singling anti Mer Astro Zenica had the, of course prepare it as a single land in antitumor, which meant either resolution. So separation of the right and the left handed forms or else preparation of only the one form the s uh, members. All I noticed that the doctor said Isa met resolved. Maybe they all pronounce it that way, but the reason they got the names because it's ass, right?

Speaker 1:          04:09          So I say yes, a map result. Uh, so how are you going to do it? Resolution. You could do a posture conglomorate kind of thing. You could make temporary dietary immerse and separate them perhaps by crystallization or you could destroy wanting antitumor react the Ras and mate with the resolved chiral reagent that would react with only one or maybe a catalyst that would catalyze the destruction of only one, like an enzyme. Or You could do it nature's way and prepare only wanting auntie Marie either from a resolved chiral starting material or using a resolved reagent or catalyst. And they tried, they tried all of these. So let's a look at it first. A resolution of a map result by chromatography. So they had uh, Silico, it's what you use probably in your chromatography, but they coated it with something that was a singly Nan tumor. Now how did they get something solid that was a singly Nancy where that they could coat it with, they got it from nature. It was cellulose, Tris, fennel car, Bama wheel cellulose. And they did this in 1990 when they were looking forward to the time that they'd lose patent protection on the Ras Rasamayi. So there's cellulose and fennel, ISO, Cya, Nate thing with two double bonds in a row there. Now, uh, what would make you think fennel isocyanate reactive the reagent. See any functional groups there?

Speaker 1:          05:37          Any ideas? Okay. Carbon double bond. Good. And how about the cellulose? What's going to make it reactive? Rick? What makes cellulose reactive? Any functional groups? Sole unshared payers on oxygen. Okay, so none shared pair on oxygen could attack the carbon yield. Now it could attack either the CEO or the CN double bond. And in fact, we've seen this before. This, remember is how urea got made from ammonia and, and uh, and the, and the corresponding acid. This is just the fennel derivative of that asset. So it does the same thing. And in fact you can do it with all the ohs in the group. So you put that, uh, that car bammo wheel group as it's called on all the oxygen. So that is the chiral stuff that was on the solid that the chromatography was conducted with. Now they weren't able to get very much.

Speaker 1:          06:41          They did, they did six injections in chromatography and were able to get three milligrams of the dextro rotatory and four milligrams of the Livo rotatory stuff separated by the rate at which they would go through this chiral column. Now, that wasn't enough for any kind of human testing or anything. You need 20 milligrams. Remember for a human dose for just one dose. But what they could do was measure how fast [inaudible] was, because obviously if the stuff rast summized immediately it would be useless to have a single enantiomers. So they found out that that the half life for [inaudible] was an hour at 75 degrees, which they then extrapolated to what it would be at a body temperature to be a hundred hours. So plenty of time, it's not going to randomize just spontaneously. So at least that was not a trouble. So they, so this very first quick way of resolving it allowed them to see that it was maybe worthwhile continuing.

Speaker 1:          07:40          Okay. Then they tried reversible formation of a crystal and man delete Esther. Now that red stuff there is mandelic acid, which is a natural substance. So you have that as the pure s enantiomers and now you want to react that with uh, with the OMAP resolve with the receipt we can map result. But there you do it with an intermediate compound, formaldehyde such that the Formaldehyde, the carbon eel group gets attacked from both sides one of the time by the nitrogen on the Ameb Rizal and the oxygen on Mandelic acid to put ch two group between them. And we'll talk about that a lot, that kind of thing when we get onto the chemistry of aldehydes and ketones. But anyhow, they could do that. Now they have what? What Stereo? What's the stairs? They have two things. What's their stereo chemical relationship? Because they had received me come and resolve, they've reacted it with s mandelic acid.

Speaker 1:          08:37          What are the two that you got two compounds. What's their relationship? Russell? Their dietary immersed. So they're different so you can crystallize them apart. Okay. So they did that and then the important thing was that it's a reversible reaction so they could go back again adding water and get the result back after the separation. And now they have both the r and the s versions of that, both the d and the l or the Dexter rotatory in the Livo rotatory forms of a members all in separate bottles and now they have hundreds of milligrams. So it's not enough to do a large scale test, but they can do some biological testing. And with it where they found that the ar was four times as active as the s in rats that they studied. But Lo and behold, when they got into humans, it turned out it was reversed, that the s was more active than the are.

Speaker 1:          09:34          So that's why the drug is SMF resolved. Okay? But that's that you're not going to do this to make enough to, uh, to sell to the public, especially because you don't want to throw away half the material you make, both because you're polluting the environment, uh, and because you're wasting the money you've put into making it. So there's a, they developed a chiral catalyst, uh, involving titanium. So there's a titanium bond bounded to, to, uh, to four alcohols are actually one of them bridges to another titanium. But anyhow, you can do something called Lig and exchange. So one of the, so the electrons in the bond go onto the oxygen. So you have our oh minus and the plus you've broken the bond. Now that goes away and a different one can come in a different alcohol and form a new bond. So that exchanges the ligands by losing one and putting on another one.

Speaker 1:          10:34          Okay? Now you can do that trick with Dai Ethel tartrate. So two of the oxygens, the alcohol, oxygen's of tartaric acid can exchange for two of the alcohols that are on the titanium. And you get this, this compound of titanium. Now what you really want is the titanium. That's what's the catalyst. So you can lose another aro minus and you get this Tei plus, and now it's when the Talus begins because you bring in a per oxy compound, a hydro peroxide. So instead of an alcohol, there are two oxygens there. And that can do the same trick and combined with the titanium. So you have this compound, but now you have different functional group there you have the o bond and what makes the OBOD reactive. We've seen this before, Kevin, and what is the low luma?

Speaker 1:          11:31          Right? So sigma star is going to be reactive there, okay? And you could bring in a sulfur, right with its unshared payers and they'll react, make a bond, break a bond, right? So you get the sulfur attached to the oxygen and it's s plus since it's used its electrons to make that new bond, uh, now that thing can come off the same way. The compound above it did the Aro came off the the sulfur compound can come off. And that's the sulfoxide. And remember that's the important group in the SMS spurs all. That's what sets things going. Okay, so we've got it. And now that compound on the lower left, the titanium compound is the same as the one on the upper right. So we've made a cycle. Okay? So that means we could look at the cycle this way, a catalytic cycle. We bring in our oh minus, it combines with the little machine.

Speaker 1:          12:35          Then s comes in and Aro minus comes out and then s double bond o comes out and you get the catalysts back again. Start at the top and go. So you go round and round and round and round. And every time you have the, the peroxide come in, the sulfide come in, the Aro minus comes out and the so comes out. So essentially the r o gives one of its, owes the redwood to the sulfur. Right? But it's catalyzed by this. Now why is it important for their purposes that this thing be involved in Qatar? Alesis we looked last time that you can put an oxygen on sulfur just with peroxide. You don't need the catalyst to do that. Although it's faster with the catalyst. Did they do it just to gain speed or could you see something else? What's special about the catalyst?

Speaker 1:          13:27          Lucas part? It's one in antitumor, right? It's a chiral oxidizing agent. The peroxide alone would have been an oxidizing agent, could have done the trick, but the Chiral oxidizing agent means that it will discriminate between the two hands of the product. Right? It could attack one of the unshared pairs here or it could attack the other and those are Ian Antia Mers of one another. But when it's combined with this thing that has tartaric acid on, which makes it chiral and have one hand, then those are diastema immerse one of the tacks. This one or when this one does the attacking. Right. So they won't be 50 50 unfortunately it was 50 50 it just happened to be the same rate. So did they give up? No, they started fiddling and one thing they did was to add dye Eissa propyl ethyl amine. Why? Who knows, right?

Speaker 1:          14:33          But they discovered that what you do that then you get what's called 94% enantiomers excess. That means the desire dean, Nancy homer is, they're at a 96, 97% and there's 3% of the ragging antitumor, right? So there's an excess of 94% of the Ena, Auntie Marie you want. So now all you do is crystallize it and it gets purified. You get rid of the 3% and you have the stuff you want. Now you can sell it to the public as Nexium. So that's the, that's the way you do it practically, right? When you want to make a lot of stuff, you make just one.

Speaker 1:          15:15          Okay? So that's what we're going to say about a configuration. Uh, and now we have one C to go. We'd talked about composition of course from the time of Lavoie, ca about constitution from the time of Cooper and [inaudible], Calculi, uh, those, but then there are distinctions based on this bonding model. Note that constitution is already involving the bonding model, but something beyond constitution is how things are arranged in space. So configuration is obviously also a question of the model that you make in for bonding and con formation, which is the sea we haven't talked about yet. And those last two are stereo isomers because they have to do with arrangement in space. Which constitution as you remember it doesn't. So you could, the difference between configuration and confirmation, both of which have to do with arrangement in space is that the configuration you have to break bonds to go for one and I isomer to another.

Speaker 1:          16:19          And in the uh, con formation, you just rotate about single bonds to get from one isomer. Other. And in general it's hard to break bonds and easier to rotate bonds. So typically configurational isomers lasts longer than conformational isomers but not always. There could be special cases. Now all things that you call isomers represent local energy minimis. So the molecule can sit there at that geometry and of course it has to be vibrating at least zero point vibration. So the atoms are moving, but they're in a, well, they stay in the same relative locations more or less. Right? They vibrate in there, but then they can get out of that well and go to a completely different well and vibrate there. So not all the different phases of vibration are considered different molecules. That would be way too much to call those all isomers of one another.

Speaker 1:          17:14          Those are all one isomer. And these are all another isomer. But there's some barrier to get from one to the other. So you can have one or the other. And the barriers are typically higher for configuration and lower for confirmation. Okay. Now we've seen that in 19th century, the stereo chemistry was qualitative. It was a question of counting isomers not measuring something, but just counting how many isomers you can get. Very qualitative, right? But Khan formation, which didn't come along until later, which involves rotational isomerism about single bonds is much more subtle and it requires quantitative thought about equilibria rates. And Energy's not just this qualitative counting of isomers. So notice that this is, that con formational analysis came relatively late to the timeline. We're talking about all the other stuff we're talking about happened before. Most of the other stuff. Uh, with respect to structure happened before 1900, but it was only in 1950 that confirmational analysis began.

Speaker 1:          18:23          And then, uh, uh, 25 years later that people started doing significant what's called molecular mechanics modeling, treating molecules as if they were springs and so on. And we'll talk about that a little bit later. So remember, there you are and we can trace your lineage back to PD. Bartlett at Harvard, who was my phd supervisor and his phd supervisor, JB Conant. Now those guys were involved in a special flavor of organic chemistry, which influences you, it's called physical organic chemistry. It's interested in not so much in making new compounds as in why compounds behave the way they do. So what you've suffered through this semester is because of these guys, right? We talk much more about why things work, how bonding works, how to recognize a functional group than we do with memorizing reactions that will get you from here to there. Okay. So Conant was, was, was one of the founders of this discipline because he did phd with two advisors, one of whom was a physical chemist and one was an organic chemist.

Speaker 1:          19:30          So if we go back a little bit here, you see the blue, the organic chemist was Kohler, whom we've talked about. And the red was tw Richards, the physical chemist who himself studied with Ville Helm, Austin called who together with Vantiff and to rainiest these three guys here, Vantiff last of all an erroneous. Those are the guys who founded physical chemistry as a discipline. Okay? So, uh, so we have a lot more physical chemistry in this course than you'd normally would in an elementary organic course. Uh, now, uh, if you go a little bit further in the family tree, you get GN Lewis as well. When we've of course talked about now in the late 19th century when these guys were founding physical chemistry, organic chemists focused their efforts on molecular structure, on these things having to do with configuration and, and enantiomers and so on. But physical chemists focused on energy sometimes to the exclusion of structure.

Speaker 1:          20:35          In fact, asked of all, oh, I forgot to bring his book. I was going to bring, but I can to show you, but I have a page from it here. He wrote lots and lots of books on. First of all to is like, you know, you're four great Kevin uncle, grandfather or something. This principles of chemistry, which he gave the, uh, not too modest title and introduction to all chemical textbooks. So this is why if you read it, then you were ready to read any other chemical textbooks. So it was a general view in 19 seven and on page four 21, there's a very long footnote. And if you look at a little bit of this footnote, it says Dalton who developed the law of combining weights on the basis of an hypothesis he had proposed about the composition of matter from Adams at first took hydrogen as unity since it had the smallest atomic weight that is combining weight.

Speaker 1:          21:30          And so there's the word Adam, and that's the only place in 554 pages of this book that the Word Adam occurs. It's in the subordinate clause of a footnote, because at this time, asked of all, didn't believe in atoms. He believed that philosophically, since you couldn't see him, you shouldn't talk about them. So you should do things that you can deal with. And energy was such a thing he thought. So physical chemists, these guys who founded physical chemistry focused on, of course, Vantiff is interesting because he's the guy that had the idea of the tetrahedral carbon. So he didn't sign off on this together with Austin Oswald, but Oswald was much more influential. He had a much bigger school of, of uh, students. And so, uh, he was, he was only two years later that he finally accepted the existence of atoms. So I'm just drawing you the contrast between what organic chemists we're thinking about and what physical chemists were and that now, to deal with confirmation, we have to become a little physical chemist to, uh, to, uh, to, to see the influence of energy.

Speaker 1:          22:40          So here's the dedication of sterling chemistry lab in April, 1923 and there is a group of people that will look at, and all of these guys here, we're students of Austin Bald. So he had a very broad influence. Uh, the one there is tw Richards got the first American Nobel prize in Chemistry. Okay. Andy, he remember is, is, uh, is your something grandfather. Okay. So then, uh, done in the next guy where there's a guy from Canada, guy from Britain and the, the uh, guy on the left, there was a student of Richard, so a grand student of, of Austin Ball with his cigars. He always had, and this guy is wilder band Croft, who was at Cornell and who founded and owned for that matter, the Journal of Physical Chemistry. And he wrote an obituary of Austin Bald, uh, in 1933 in which he said, asked, followed Skift for leadership showed itself. And the way his pupils regarded him all throughout, all through their,

Speaker 2:          23:47          they usually believe Twat Ostfeld said, even when they knew he was not right. Okay. And no doubt Adams where what he had in mind that Oswald didn't believe in atoms, but as students still believed in atoms. Okay, but they all believed in energy. Now, did anybody walk past here this morning? You recognize this place? Okay, you take a different path. Okay, but have you noticed what's off on the left there? Here's stood the house of Josiah Willard Gibbs, class of 1858 professor of mathematical physics. So Yale has a really special connection to, to energy. There's Gibbs as a, as a freshman, uh, and here, here he is in, in later life he spent his whole life here at Yale except for one year he went to Germany. So physical chemists were and still are quantitative about equilibrium constants and rate constants. So big K is an equilibrium constant. Small K is a rate constant and they're related to energy.

Speaker 2:          24:55          So you can call energy. He or if you're, you're more particular, you can call it h for [inaudible] or g for Gibbs. Free Energy and entropy gets into the argument as we'll see in a few lectures. So energy determines what can happen at equilibrium. That is, if you have this stuff, is it possible spontaneously to go to this stuff if you have forever and ever for it to happen? Is it conceivable that this stuff will go to this stuff? It can only happen if it's downhill and energy in free energy. Okay. And the equilibrium constant is determined by, is related to energy in this way. And here's something that's really handy and you'll impress a subsequent teachers and your roommates and everyone else, if you remember this, that if you know the change in energy and kilocalories per mole, you can say what the equilibrium constant is cause it's 10 to the minus three fourths of whatever that is. So suppose the difference between this and this is four kilocalories per mole. What will the equilibrium constant B,

Speaker 3:          26:03          yeah,

Speaker 2:          26:04          it'll be 1,010 to the three fourths of of four, right? Three. Four. So four is three. 10 to the third is a thousand so the equilibrium constants gotta be a thousand. Now, whether it's a thousand or one over a thousand, depends on which way you're going. But obviously it's going to favor the one down hill. So you have to keep your thinking cap on to get the right direction. But 10 to the minus three fourths of Delta h or tend to the plus 10 to the minus three fourths, uh, is the way to do it. Okay. But you can also say something about how fast it will go. This is just whether it's conceivable that it will go. The big guy, the little Kay says how fast because rates, this is an approximation. This isn't a written on the tablets by the angel or someone. But for practical purposes, for our purposes, the rate in seconds, that is how many per second is 10 to the 13th so that's very fast.

Speaker 2:          27:03          10 to the 13th per second. But then it gets cut down by how big the energy barrier is. You have to get across. And the cutting down is exactly the same kind of thing you have in the big k 10 to the minus Delta h. So you can again, that that energy is called activation energy. It's how high the barrier is that you have to get over. And you can use the same trick of the three fourths. So it's the rate constant is 10 to the 13th minus three fourths of whatever the energy. So if you have a four, suppose you had a four kilocalories of energy barrier you had to get across was you had a 40 kilo calorie energy barrier, you had to get across 40 kilo calorie energy barrier, right? How fast would the rate constant? B?

Speaker 3:          27:53          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          27:53          Becky, why don't you help me? So the barrier is 40 kilocalories. Okay. That you have to get across. So now how am I going to plug that in here?

Speaker 2:          28:06          Okay, so three fourths of 40 I need, right? So what's that? 30 30. Okay, so it's 10 to the 13 minus 30 okay, what's 13 minus 30 okay, so it's 10 to the minus 27 per second. Do you think that's very fast? 10 to the minus 27 that's a pretty small number, right? So forget spontaneously at room temperature going over, uh, going over a barrier of 40 kilocalories per mole for practical purposes. But you have this tea here. So if you increase the absolute temperature, then you make that for bidding factor smaller and smaller and smaller. Up in the exponent. So if you heat it up, you could make the reaction go. Okay, so Eddie, yeah, that's really, that's really helpful to remember this three fourths trick. Okay. Now, confirmation involves rotational isomerization about single bonds. So the question is, how free is single bond rotation? Paterno said it wasn't free at all. I can count isomers that way I can have this isomer and I can have this isomer and I can have this isomer, right. For cat, for purposes of counting. But van Hoff says, no, don't count. Isomers like that because why? Why shouldn't you account isomers like that?

Speaker 2:          29:41          Because they rotate too easy, right? It's like that in his picture. Right? So you shouldn't count this and this and this and this. Okay. Now there are different kinds of models. Something like these, and some of them you can rotate easily, but not others. Right? Which one's realistic, right? Or I mean, this one you can rotate. It's just not easy to rotate, right? It sticks. Right? Or this one, remember that Fisher used, which is good because you can bend it for his purposes, right? For drawing two dimensional Fisher projections. But forget rotating that right. It could vibrate, but it can't. You can't rotate it. It'll always come back, right? So the question is, which model is right? Can you rotate or can't you rotate? And how hard is it to rotate? Because that's going to determine how fast these things will be. Okay? Now notice that all that both of these authors drew their pictures with a confirmation which we call eclipsed.

Speaker 2:          30:44          Now eclipsed means these means this, that the ones on the top or right over ones on the bottom, okay. And the same is true in Van Hoff's Tetrahedron, right? Right above the others. Obviously you could rotate, uh, 60 degrees on the top and everything would be staggered, not directly above. Okay? Notice incidentally that from the exam, we looked at the molecule of the week for last week from the American Chemical Society and notice how it's drawn, right? It also is eclipsed. This redwood here is directly opposite. This red one here, this acid group is directly opposite that hydrogen, and this has group directly opposite that hydrogen, it's eclipse, right? And here. This CO2 is directly above that CO2. It's eclipsed right now you need notation and, and uh, and names to talk about these things. And this, the projection that was invented for this purpose was invented by someone who sat in the seat that some of you are sitting in, I don't know which, maybe he's probably in the course of, of his undergraduate years and also is getting his phd, probably sat in most of the seats in here or many of them anyhow, but his name was Melvin Newman.

Speaker 2:          32:03          You see, he graduated from Yale in 29 he got his phd in 32 and then he went to Ohio state and he invented a way of drawing confirmations on paper. So there are two carbons in the, the convention is that for the Newman projection that you sight down the carbon carbon bond. So I'm going to show this, the rotation around this central bond. Okay. So I look right along that bond and there's one carbon in front and one carbon behind and each of them has three things on it. Okay. So the one behind here has three hydrogens and the one in front hides the one behind, okay? But it has three other groups on it to everybody. See how he's doing this, that, that shows this why it chose it without the methyl groups here. Okay? Any calls that staggered, right? But you could also have the be right on top of one another like this, right?

Speaker 2:          33:07          And that's called eclipsed. And that's the way it was shown on the previous slide by Paterno, by van Hoff, and by the acs operative who made the molecule of the week. Okay. Now that does, that's not so convenient because you can't see the stuff in back. So sometimes people turn it a little bit that way, or sometimes they turn it a little bit that way. By which they don't mean that it's not eclipsed, they just mean I want to be able to show both things right now that's very cumbersome. And the reason you don't mind that it's cumbersome is that things are never eclipsed. They're always staggered. So all those previous pictures were wrong, including the molecule the week. Because confirmations tend to be staggered, not eclipsed. Okay. But anyhow, you can draw them in this way. Okay. And that's just the conventional way of drawing something that's eclipse because it's, as you can see, it's not truly a 100% eclipsed.

Speaker 2:          34:08          Okay. Now, when you have substituents on those things, you can give different names to different phases of rotation. For example, they could be exactly opposite one another like that, which if this were a double bond, you would call trans or e. Right? But for a single bond, you look at it with a Newman projection like this, and it's called Auntie, right? Or you can have it rotated like this and be what's called Gauche. And I've never found out why it's called Gauche. Right? But notice something about that. Is this, is AMT chiral is that confirmation chiral or is it super imposable on? Is there a mirror?

Speaker 2:          34:54          Right? There's a mirror right here, right. So it's its own mere image. How about Gauche? Is it chiral? Is there a mirror here? There's a twofold access here. If I rotate like this, if I had you close your eyes and did that rotation, you couldn't tell whether with whether I had rotated or not. Right? It's like a propeller. But if I take another one like this and make the mirror image of this Gauche win like this here, right? This is a mirror image everybody see? Right? But I can't superimpose them, right? If I superimpose the back three, the front ones are not right. So these are chiral. So with respect to go, shh, we have enantiomers right? That one as well. And one of them we call minus and the other we call plus. Okay. And now if you have the analog for eclipsed is that you can have something that's fully eclipse, right?

Speaker 2:          36:03          That where the special groups are right on top of one another or it can be like that. Right? But again, so and that can be one way or the other. Again, it's twisted like, like a propeller would be, and these are again, cumbersome things to draw with Newman projection, but you don't worry about there being cumbersome because you don't have to draw them usually because they're not energy minima. They're not isomers. There are barriers between going from one to another. Okay. But again, those would be minus and plus. And if you want to be really pedantic and meet in a committee of the pure of pure and applied chemistry people, the IUP AAC, and decide precisely what you're going to call different things, then you get together and you scratch your head and for different rotations of the thing in back with respect to the thing in front, you have these different pedantic names.

Speaker 2:          37:03          Sin Perry Planar is, is is the one that we called fully eclipse and you can have anticline UL and Sin Clientele and sin, Perry planar and plus and minus and so on. But you never do that really, but it's there if you need it. Okay, so there's, there's, there's a notation, Newman projection and there's a nomenclature which could be sort of simple like on the previous slide or very complicated like this that allows you to discuss these things to draw and discuss them now, but here's the practical question is the threefold barrier. So if you have ethane like this, right, and you rotate this, right, the energy will go up and down. If the, the energies will be different for different angles of rotation. But obviously there's a certain symmetry that this, if it's all hydrogens will be the same energy as this will be the same energy as this and for the eclipse this will be the same as this will be the same as this.

Speaker 2:          38:02          Okay, so there's a three fold barrier. Now the question is to, there are two questions. How big is the barrier? So are we going to be able to have isomers and what's the energy minimum? Now let's just suppose together with Vantiff and Paterno and the person who made the molecule of the week that the lowest energy, if we plot energy versus phase of rotation here, that the lowest energy is zero degrees. That's fully eclipse like this. Okay, that's zero degrees and now we'll start turning it and the energy may go up when we go to a staggered and then down and then up, down, up, down. Right, and then you're back where you started once you've gone through three 60 degrees or is there a big barrier, right? Is the barrier smaller, big? Now, how can you tell? Here's an interesting thing, a way to tell, right that if there is a big barrier, then the things are going to be quantized in it.

Speaker 2:          39:01          The energies are being quantized, but the energy is, if the barrier is very, very small, then almost any energy you have is above the barrier and so it's not quantized. Remember when you get above a barrier, you can have energy, any energy you want. It's only when the thing is bonded on both sides, that the, that the wave function has to come down and reach zero. Okay? So if the barrier is big, the energy will only be certain amounts. But if the energy is very small, you can have any energy you want. And that you can tell that is in fact how it was discovered, how big the barrier for rotation was, was by measuring something, having to do with energy, with heat. Okay. And here's a, so the question is, is the energy quantized in this triple minimum? We've talked about double minimum. This is actually a triple minimum. Okay. So you, they measured in 1936 the absorption of heat by ethane, uh, going down to very, very low temperature. This starts at a 150 Kelvin, but I think they went further than that.

Speaker 2:          40:15          So there's a thing called entropy and we'll talk about that in different terms a little bit in a, in a week or two after vacation. Okay. Vacation. Okay. So there's a thing called heat capacity CP, which is how much heat you absorb. So entropy is defined by people who do thermodynamics in this way that you sum up or integrate starting from Zero Kelvin. Remember Calvin, all the way up to whatever temperature you interested in, you sum up how much heat is being absorbed. So CP times temperature, that's how much heat is being absorbed at each temperature as you go up, as you raise the temperature more and more heat gets absorbed. But you always divide it by the temperature as you go up. So if you, if you absorb heat at very low temperature, that makes a much bigger difference than absorbing the same heat at high temperature in this quantity called entropy.

Speaker 2:          41:11          So don't worry about it except by this definition for now, and this is very technical and not so very important to what we're doing. So don't get tied up in knots about it. But anyhow, if you have larger quantized spacings, then less heat gets absorbed. And I'll show you that on the next slide. And the heat that gets absorbed gets absorbed at a higher temperature, right? So both those factors mean that the entropy at any given temperature is going to be smaller because you've absorbed less stuff in the numerator and you've absorbed at a higher temperature so you have a bigger denominator for all these contributions. Okay, so the results in 1936 where this, if you're interested in what the entropy of ethane is at at 298 Kelvin, it turns out experimentally, that's what they did out at Berkeley. They, they found it was 54.8 plus or minus 0.2 entropy units and then they calculated how that, how, how, how high that would be for different heights of this threefold barrier in the quantum nation that's involved.

Speaker 2:          42:16          And what they saw was that if the barrier were zero, that number instead of 54.8 should be 56.4 if the barrier were 0.3 it should be 56.3 if the barrier is 3.1 it should be 54.6 which is within experimental error of the experiment, right? So that showed that the barrier was about three kilocalories per mole. So it wasn't totally free rotation, it was just pretty fast. So suppose the barrier had been four kilocalories per mole instead of three. Just suppose that were for how fast, what would the rate constant B for the rotation. So the barrier is four kilocalories per mole that you have to get over. How do I deal with that, Sam?

Speaker 2:          43:05          It's this, there's a trick, right? 10 to the minus three quarters centers, four is three. Okay, so it's going to be tender. There's going to be a minus three up in the numerator up in the exponent. And what else is going to be an exponent? Remember for a rate, 10 to the 13th so it's 10 to the 13th minus three. So it's 10 to the 10 to the 10th per second. So we'd take 10 to the minus 10 seconds for it to rotate. That's pretty darn easy at room temperature, right? Pretty easy, but not perfectly free and enough to make this difference in the entropy. Now let me just see what time it is. Okay, we have time to do this. Okay, so we're now going to use that big k equilibrium constant. So suppose we have something that has this Roger say that has a barrier of such that the spacing between successive levels is one kilocalories per mole.

Speaker 2:          44:10          Suppose it's a harmonic oscillator. We already did that. The lowest zero point level you had to have that energy and then one kilo calorie above that one kilo calorie one kilocalories. Now what we're going to do is see how much energy, extra energy above zero point is there at equilibrium, right? At any given temperature. So, uh, so we have some stuff that's at equilibrium. There's going to be stuff that has no extra energy, zero point, a certain amount, but there'll be a certain amount that has one kilocalories per mole that's in that first level. Now how do I know how much is in that first level at equilibrium? How do I know the ratio of what's in the top to what's in the bottom? If the spacing is one kilocalories per mole, is there a way of doing that? You don't have to do the numbers, but tell me what formula you would use to get the equilibrium constant.

Speaker 2:          45:08          Caitlin, do you remember, Sophie, how do you get the Big k? How does it relate to energy? Anybody remember we already did the hard one. Eric. 10 to the minus three fourths of one. Okay. That's at room temperature. It's different at other temperatures. Okay, so so we know how much there's going to be that what fraction of the stuff of the stuff that's here is going to be one kilocalories up. It's going to be 10 to the minus three fourths right of of this. So something like a 10th of it, right? 10 to the minus one would be a 10th okay. And then there'll be stuff here and the amount here relative to the amount here that this is what we're doing so that that ratio, the ratio of zero to one is going to be the same as the ratio of one to two because that one is one kilo calorie above this one and the same for the third to the second or the fourth to the third.

Speaker 2:          46:07          So then we can sum all these up there knowing the ratios and figure out what percentage there is of each of these. And it turns out that that tend to divide. The three fourths is 5.6 so there's going to be 5.6 times as much here as there is here. 5.6 times as much here as there is here. 5.6 times as much here as there is here and if you translate that into percentages it will be that there's 81.9% here and one over 5.6 14.8% there and two seven 2.7 0.5% and 0.1% but of course this stuff added only what this 14% added only one kilocalories per mole. This one added to this one added three, this one added four so you sum all those up and you get how much energy, how much heat was absorbed. This didn't absorb anything. It's still in the lowest.

Speaker 2:          47:00          This absorbed a certain amount, 14.8 right 0.148 and then twice that 0.2 0.027 and so on so you can sum it up and see how much heat would have been absorbed by the time you get out there. Now if the spacing had been very much smaller, if the spacing had been 0.025 kilocalories per mole, then we would have made the, how much is there of this? That's at the lowest level. How much has one unit 0.025 how much has 0.0 5.075 and so on. And we do exactly the same trick, although of course you need to a spreadsheet to do this with cause it's tedious, right? But you would get this and you think you absorb more heat if you have smaller steps. And now there's 4.2% here and 0.8% at exactly one kilocalories per mole. But you have a lot of others in here.

Speaker 2:          47:56          So 59% of the population is between, is halfway out to the one and then a 33% is more or less one and a 6.6% is like that and so on. So anyhow, you'll absorb more heat and you absorb it at lower temperature too, right? So both those things build up the entropy. So that one absorbs 364 kilocalories. Mole, more not kilo calories, small calories, 364 more than the other one. And that is what gives that entropy difference. Okay. So that's how people knew that there was a barrier to rotation was by measuring heat capacity. Uh, so we'll stop here and next time we'll address the question of whether the, now we know what the barrier is, but we don't know what the low energy forum is, whether it's eclipse, they're staggered.
