00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710
an angry response too often then you
 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.729
an angry response too often then you
become a nightmare yourself so what

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.619
mindfulness is teaching is that the
stimulus which is someone cutting you

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629
stimulus which is someone cutting you
 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.610

off is different it's distinct from your
 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.779
off is different it's distinct from your
emotional reaction to that thing so

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789
emotional reaction to that thing so
 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.270
emotional reaction to that thing so
someone could cut you off you could feel

the anger so instead of being driven by
 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.710
the anger so instead of being driven by
your reactions there's a little bit of a

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720
your reactions there's a little bit of a
 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.620
your reactions there's a little bit of a
room where you can choose to be a

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630
room where you can choose to be a
 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.190

a one-pointed practice and that's the
that's the beginning level of

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720
that's the beginning level of
 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.140

wherever the mind goes so instead of
 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.180
wherever the mind goes so instead of
paying attention just to the breath or

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190
paying attention just to the breath or
 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.479

is changing all the time and you learn
 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.009
is changing all the time and you learn
to pay attention more to process than to

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019
to pay attention more to process than to
 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:05.230

it's really only in the past 5060 years

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200
it's really only in the past 5060 years
 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.500
it's really only in the past 5060 years
that the medical establishment has been

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510
that the medical establishment has been
 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.050
that the medical establishment has been
exposed at all to what mindfulness is

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060
exposed at all to what mindfulness is
 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.500
exposed at all to what mindfulness is
and for 20 30 of those years it was like

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510
and for 20 30 of those years it was like
 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.780
and for 20 30 of those years it was like
just a new age thing it was on the

just a new age thing it was on the
 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.660
just a new age thing it was on the
periphery and only through the work of a

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670
periphery and only through the work of a
 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.320
periphery and only through the work of a

mindfulness come in to the medical

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340
mindfulness come in to the medical
 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.580
mindfulness come in to the medical
establishment there are a lot of studies

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590
establishment there are a lot of studies
 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.180
establishment there are a lot of studies
that are being done now that are showing

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190
that are being done now that are showing

of conditions and some old colleagues of
 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.150
of conditions and some old colleagues of
mine have done some very good work

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160
mine have done some very good work
 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.890
mine have done some very good work
showing that the steady practice of

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900
showing that the steady practice of
 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.070
showing that the steady practice of
mindfulness light up areas of the brain

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080
mindfulness light up areas of the brain
 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.750
mindfulness light up areas of the brain
that have to do with modulating

that have to do with modulating
 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:04.190

emotional reactivity so I think there's

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200
emotional reactivity so I think there's
 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.390
emotional reactivity so I think there's
beginning evidence that the the brain is

beginning evidence that the the brain is
plastic more plastic than we initially

thought and that the you know what what
 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.409
thought and that the you know what what
you feed into the brain actually changes

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419
you feed into the brain actually changes

you feed into the brain actually changes
the architecture of the brain so that
