00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.340
Hey there everybody, I’m Jay Smooth and
this is Crash Course Media Literacy.

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:16.540
For the next few weeks we’re going to take a deep
dive into media – how we consume it, how we create
it, and how it impacts our everyday lives.

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:22.260
Before we get started, do me a favor and think: how
many hours did you spend consuming media today?

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.420
Don’t worry, I’ll wait.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.540
What’d you come up with?
2 hours? 3? 5?

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:37.110
If you’re the average U.S. adult, today you spent upwards of 10 hours watching TV, listening to the radio, surfing the web, scrolling through your phone, or checking out awesome educational video series on YouTube.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.440
That’s over 40% of your day!

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.460
If you’re a teen or tween, you spent a little
less time – maybe 6 to 9 hours.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.880
Never before in history have humans spent
so many waking hours consuming media.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:54.380
Since it’s taking up more and more of our
time each year, it’s important that we understand
its influence on everything we do.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:01:04.540
[Theme Music]

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.000
Now when I say “media” I’m talking about
a couple different things.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.380
The literal definition of “media” is the plural
of medium, or multiple mediums, so to speak.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.220
And a medium is a substance or a method in
which something is communicated.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.180
It’s the vehicle for a message.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:29.400
Books, films, paintings, songs, TV shows, poems,
video games, magazines, podcasts, music videos,
newspapers, web forums, coupons, email newsletters,

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:38.200
Tweets, straight-to-DVD sequels, receipts, traffic signs,
both good and bad street art, Snapchat stories, those
word of the day calendars your aunt always buys you,

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:45.280
protest signs, embarrassing but cute childhood
photos you post on #throwbackthursday, breaking news
push notifications that give you a mini heart attack,

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:54.020
sex ed pamphlets about your changing body,
and my Bluray copy of the second highest grossing
film of all time, Titanic – those are all media.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.660
When you think about it that way, it makes sense
that we spend so much time consuming media.

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:05.960
Whether you’re at work or school or just hanging
out, chances are you’re almost always interacting
with some sort of artifact of communication.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.400
As a culture we often stick a “the” in front of “media”
to refer collectively to mass communication.

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.880
It’s an umbrella term we use to talk about
the widely distributed newspapers, TV channels,

00:02:15.899 --> 00:02:20.739
websites, radio stations, movie studios, and
more that create or distribute information

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.600
– like CNN, The New York Times, NPR, Disney,
or YouTube.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:31.260
Whether you’re talking about media as in
multiple mediums or “the media,” and during
this course we’ll be talking about both,

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.180
the ability to navigate the media is a
powerful and crucial skill.

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.440
Media scholars refer to this skill as
media literacy.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:47.540
As a field of study, media literacy comprises and overlaps many different theories and subjects, from critical thinking and psychology to linguistics and ethics in technology.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:54.500
In this series, we’ll be using the definition
of media literacy that’s used by the National
Association of Media Literacy Educators.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:02.840
And it describes media literacy as “the
ability to Access, Analyze, Evaluate, Create
and Act using all forms of communication.”

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.040
Now, with this definition in mind, think back
to the media you spent your time with today.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.440
What kind of content were you absorbing, and
how did you get to it?

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.580
Were you making sense of its messages?

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.930
Were you aware that each message was created
by someone with their own goals and opinions?

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:23.580
When you create media, like a blog post or
an Instagram, what is your responsibility
to those who view it?

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.480
Finally, what do you do with all that info
you just received?

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:34.680
With media literacy skills, you’ll have the power to
think through each of these important questions every
time you pick up your phone or flip on the radio.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:40.180
It’ll be like putting on a pair of glasses
for the first time: so eye opening you’ll
never want to take them off.

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:46.020
Which is great, because you won’t actually
be able to take them off – it’ll be hard to look
at media the same way.

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.020
So, actually I guess media literacy is more
like laser eye surgery.

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:51.180
But way cheaper.

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:57.880
OK. Media Literacy Lesson #1:
understanding the difference between
media messages and media effects.

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:03.980
Media messages are the values and ideas that
are promoted by the media, the things that get
put into them.

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.300
Media effects are their influences and consequences
on audiences.

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:13.580
But talking about media in terms of these
inputs and outputs is way, way too simple.

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:18.480
Media doesn’t just broadcast one easy to
understand message straight into our brains.

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.940
And readers and viewers don’t just agree with
whatever they say and move on with their lives.

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.900
The creator’s experiences and environment
affect everything they create.

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.420
Their messages are filled with tons of baggage.

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:34.640
And we consumers have our own baggage, too,
which determines how we react to and interpret
messages.

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:44.440
Media scholars, cultural critics, and plenty of other very smart academic types have long understood that we need to think about messages and effects in a far more nuanced way.

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:51.270
For instance, take British sociologist Stuart
Hall’s theory of encoding and decoding,
popularized in 1973.

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:57.040
Hall wrote that before a message is distributed,
it is “encoded” by the creator during its production.

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.500
The message the creator wants to send is
written in a code of sorts,

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:07.000
using a host of pre-understood meanings,
symbols, and definitions that they think or hope
the recipient will understand.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.900
But the recipient (that’s you) has their own
mental dictionary full of meanings, symbols,
and definitions.

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:18.800
When someone interprets a message, they
“decode” it by applying their knowledge and
experience to decipher its meaning.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:25.580
When I say “encode” and “decode,” I don’t
just mean a secret code you use to talk to your
friends, or Morse code.

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.540
As Hall would say, all language is “coded.”

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:30.680
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble to break
this down:

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.650
Say you’re texting your significant other
about where to go for dinner.

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:37.700
You just heard about this fancy French restaurant
that’s supposed to be super romantic and
perfect for a date.

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:38.680
You’re doing a little encoding here.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.700
So you say, Let’s do Maison de L’amour
*kissy face emoji*

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:52.100
You use the restaurant’s name instead of “fancy
French restaurant” because it sounds more impressive
and makes you look cool for knowing a little French.

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:55.560
You throw in a kissy face emoji to turn up
the flirtatiousness.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:04.940
But also notice, you say “do” instead of “go to” because,
since you’re already talking about where to eat, the
activity you’re doing at Maison de L’amour is implied.

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:06.100
Done.
Send.

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:10.000
They respond, Ok *crying laughing emoji*

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.380
Wait, what does that mean?!

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:14.200
Did you say something wrong?
Do they not want to go?

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:18.680
Are they just so stoked for this restaurant
that they’re...laughing maniacally?

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:20.740
Do they want to break up?
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:28.020
Here, you’re trying to decode this mysterious
message using what you know about the English
language, emoji, and your significant other.

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:30.800
Maybe some social anxiety is working its way
in, too.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:35.280
Either way, you’re thinking that clearly
your romantic gesture was poorly received.

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:42.080
But perhaps all they meant by the crying
laughing emoji was they’d love to go, despite
your super cheesy taste in restaurants.

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:46.000
They encoded their message, too, but something
got lost in the decoding.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.140
Thanks Thought Bubble.

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:52.279
Hall’s theory of encoding and decoding is
a rejection of what’s known as textual determinism,

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:58.620
or the idea that a message’s meaning is
inevitably sent and received in its entirety,
just as intended, every time.

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:05.200
Hall gave way more credit to the consumer than
many theorists before him, who often thought of
most communication as a one-way street.

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:13.140
The significance of this theory is that, as a media
consumer, you’re not just a helpless sponge, absorbing
all kinds of messages without a second thought.

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:20.260
You interpret messages in a unique way,
which means you also have the ability to see
what messages are being thrown at you –

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:24.960
and decide whether you want to catch them,
pass ‘em on, or drop them completely.

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:29.699
This also leaves plenty of room for miscommunication,
and messages getting lost in translation.

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:37.220
Of course, scholars, educators, parents, and
consumers have always debated to what degree
media really affects its consumers.

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:42.840
Questions of whether media can truly harm or benefit
us has led to media literacy education in schools,

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:49.220
media regulations (like movie ratings and
the labeling of advertisements), and tons of
research into media effects.

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:58.160
Plus, these days, when two-thirds of U.S. adults
get news from social media – and some of that can
be “fake” news – we constantly have to ask:

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.480
What information can I truly trust?

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:03.700
The answers to questions like these aren’t
always obvious.

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:07.980
Luckily, media literacy gives you the tools
you need to find the answers.

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:15.040
Whether you’re feeling skeptical of social media’s
role in your political views, questioning the power of
tech companies to control your newsfeeds,

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:22.900
or just trying to get your message out into the
world, learning how to navigate the media landscape
is tough, but possible with the right skill set.

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:24.560
Now, let’s be honest with each other.

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:30.460
If you’re watching this video, you’re
probably already pretty media savvy, or at
least very interested in being so.

00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:36.120
You clearly love learning and found us here on the
interwebs, so you’ve got some great skills already.

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:38.520
Critics might even say we’re just preaching
to the choir.

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:42.320
Well, guess what?
If you’re in the choir, we want you singing!

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:47.540
This is our official request that you sing
to everyone you know about media literacy.

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:50.460
OK, maybe not literally sing.
That might get annoying.

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:56.160
But in all seriousness, media literacy education
is only effective when we’re all on the same page.

00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:02.860
And those who need the most help learning
how to swim in the media deep end are also
the least likely to seek out videos like this.

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:09.260
So we need you to pass along these skills to
friends, family, high school acquaintances you only
talk to on Facebook –

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.730
anyone who won’t come across these
lessons themselves.

00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:13.640
We’re all in this together.

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:19.940
As Academy Award-winning actress Kate Winslet
says in 1997 hit film, Titanic: You jump, I jump, Jack.

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:21.720
Here’s how we’re going to help.

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:28.260
During the first half of this course, we’re going
to dive into the history of the field (spoiler alert:
media literacy is not a new problem);

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:33.540
learn how to find trusty sources of information;
discover how media and your mind interact;

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:36.900
and explore creating media and the
responsibilities that come with it.

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:41.760
In the second half of the course we’ll use this
theory to look at how media works in the world:

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:45.600
we’ll discover how it’s regulated (the
policies and the economics of it all);

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:50.720
the dark side of the media, like propaganda and
misinformation; the lure of advertising;

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:56.440
how the big tech companies are changing
the media landscape; plus we’ll take a look at
where the field is headed.

00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:04.400
Throughout the course, we’ll return to the core
principles of media literacy – to build a framework with
which to approach our everyday, media-filled lives.

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:06.340
I hope you’ll join me on this journey.

00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:08.820
Until next time, I’m Jay Smooth for Crash
Course.

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:10.380
We’ll see you next week!

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:14.500
Crash Course Media Literacy is filmed in the
