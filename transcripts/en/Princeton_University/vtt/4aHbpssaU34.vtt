UCHECHI KALU:
Poetry is freedom.

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.320
I think it's one of the things
I'd forgotten, that

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.040
it shouldn't confine you.


00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.720
So I can say poetry is freedom.

RACHEL GALVIN:
Some people have the idea that poetry

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.610
comes from the rhythms
in the body.

Poetry is an obsession.

MAIA TEN BRINK:
Poetry is living.

UCHECHI KALU:
Poetry is like the best way

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:24.800
to tell your story.


00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:26.110
JEFF DOLVEN:
What is poetry?

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:31.200
Poetry is so old and its place
in our lives is so various,

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.690
that there's no one definition
that's going to do it.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.310 position:75%
RACHEL GALVIN:
I like to think of what Marianne Moore tells us.

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.890
She says that, "Poetry gives us
imaginary gardens with real

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:41.740
toads in them."

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.680
ALLEN K.WILLIAMS II:
Poetry at Princeton is hard work.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.530
TRACY K.SMITH:
Poetry at Princeton is inspiring.

MAIA TEN BRINK:
Poetry at Princeton is being inspired by

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.320
the people and architecture and
the knowledge around me to

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.590
write and participate
in poetry.

ALLEN K.WILLIAMS II:
You get a lot of chances here to rub elbows

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.390
with poets, teachers,
professors, and peers of a

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.320
very, very high caliber.

PAUL MULDOON:
Poetry at Princeton-- like some of those

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:25.070
other 'P'-words, philosophy,
physics-- helps us to

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:31.150
understand who we are in the
world and indeed the universe.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.790
When the Samarians hit on the
lyre, and the Egyptians the

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:40.970
cat, and I told you my heart
was on fire, you said

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.620
good luck with that.


00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.340

RACHEL GALVIN:
It was interesting to be thinking of something.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:47.440
It was interesting
to be thinking.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.770
To be thinking. To.


00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:50.700
It was interesting.


00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.620
It was then she heard the voice
the one inside the

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:54.840
voice the one she heard.


00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.970
It was then...

UCHECHI KALU:
I find myself not even afloat, instead

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.150
chasing wrists of light to
lead me back poolside.

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.660
You taught me to swim years
ago, I thought so

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:03.530
and so did I,


00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:04.500
Yet drowning comes much...

PAUL MULDOON:
So every second year, we run the Princeton

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.910
Poetry Festival.


00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.750
It's a festival, of course,
that's directed primarily

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.500
towards our students.


00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.390
But it's also directed towards
the local community and indeed

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.180
the students in the
local community.

Under my linen shirt, Bill Evans shivers me.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.840

Your father swung his feet to the floor.

shrieking wheels.

PAUL MULDOON:
Poetry helps us to live our lives at all those

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.990
other movements that may not
seem quite so dramatic as the

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:52.580
moments as which we are born, or
get married, or indeed die.

JEFF DOLVEN:
The garbage men are talking trash, deep in

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.090
thought beside their truck:


00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.920
The job provokes reflection on
essences and accidentals.

Big, beautiful book of zany-brainy gobbledygook,

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.160
bobbleheads are nodding off
while ivory towers wobble.

PAUL MULDOON:
Well, most of us are scared of poetry.

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.710
Most of us have had a very, very
bad experience of poetry,

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:18.890
usually in high school.


00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.180
We've been taught-- and I think
taught is the operative

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:27.420
word-- to believe that without
a guide in the form of a

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.610
teacher, that a mere mortal who
would never find her or

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.530
his way through a poem.


00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.210
It would be impossible.


00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:38.340
And indeed, it's important I
think to realize that we have

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.140
to learn to read poems.


00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.100
We have to learn to watch
movies, though we don't realize

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.480
what a great time we're having
as we're doing it.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.200
We have to learn to listen
to music, rock

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.080
and roll, pop music.


00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.040
We have to learn to listen to that,
Just as we have to

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.100
learn to read a poem.


00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.600
So there's an element of
education here, which I think

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.180
is something that we have to
address right the way through

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.040
the education system.


00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.940
And we're very happy to be able
to try to play our part

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.640
in all of that at Princeton.


00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.450
And I told you my heart
was on fire.

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.530
You said good luck with that.

UCHECHI KALU: It's just a way
to make our really boring

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:01.850
lives really exciting on the
page, and to sort of examine

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:03.470
what life is.
