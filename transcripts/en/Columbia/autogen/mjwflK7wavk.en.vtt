good afternoon everybody anybody see who
 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.039
good afternoon everybody anybody see who
got the Pulitzer Prize remember that

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049
got the Pulitzer Prize remember that
 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.470
got the Pulitzer Prize remember that
cancer book I told you about so I was

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480
cancer book I told you about so I was
 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.689
cancer book I told you about so I was
right was it is good today we are going

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699
right was it is good today we are going
 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.910
right was it is good today we are going
to talk about emerging viruses which is

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920
to talk about emerging viruses which is
 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.740
to talk about emerging viruses which is
really an extension of last lecture last

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750
really an extension of last lecture last
 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.380
really an extension of last lecture last
chapter we talked about how new viruses

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390
chapter we talked about how new viruses
 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.020
chapter we talked about how new viruses
evolve so today we're going to see how

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030
evolve so today we're going to see how
 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.380
evolve so today we're going to see how
they go from one host to another so an

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390
they go from one host to another so an
 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.900
they go from one host to another so an
emerging virus is an agent of a new or

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910
emerging virus is an agent of a new or
 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.569
emerging virus is an agent of a new or
previously unrecognized infection so it

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579
previously unrecognized infection so it
 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.040
previously unrecognized infection so it
doesn't have to be brand new it could be

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050
doesn't have to be brand new it could be
 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.450
doesn't have to be brand new it could be
something that's been around but we just

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460
something that's been around but we just
 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.880
something that's been around but we just
haven't detected it before it's our

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890
haven't detected it before it's our
 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.580
haven't detected it before it's our
definition it's actually a term that was

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590
definition it's actually a term that was
 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.119
definition it's actually a term that was
coined in the 90s hadn't existed before

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129
coined in the 90s hadn't existed before
 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.670
coined in the 90s hadn't existed before
that but as you will see they're not new

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680
that but as you will see they're not new
 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.189
that but as you will see they're not new
they certainly aren't just starting in

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199
they certainly aren't just starting in
 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.369
they certainly aren't just starting in
the 1990s and basically since their eyes

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379
the 1990s and basically since their eyes
 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:07.060
the 1990s and basically since their eyes
of Agriculture about 11,000 years ago

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070
 
 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.100
 
infectious agents have invaded human

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110
infectious agents have invaded human
 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.990
infectious agents have invaded human
populations more frequently because the

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000
populations more frequently because the
 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.859
populations more frequently because the
populations have become larger and

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869
populations have become larger and
 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:17.510
populations have become larger and
that's because in part of agriculture

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520
that's because in part of agriculture
 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.820
that's because in part of agriculture
and part of that was domesticating

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830
and part of that was domesticating
 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.580
and part of that was domesticating
animals and so you had the numbers of

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590
animals and so you had the numbers of
 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.530
animals and so you had the numbers of
individuals susceptible individuals that

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540
individuals susceptible individuals that
 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.530
individuals susceptible individuals that
could sustain infections now she's not

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540
could sustain infections now she's not
 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.690
could sustain infections now she's not
to say that before eleven thousand years

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700
to say that before eleven thousand years
 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.060
to say that before eleven thousand years
ago we did not get infected but it was

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070
ago we did not get infected but it was
 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.810
ago we did not get infected but it was
rarer and probably not epidemic

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820
 
 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.870
 
sometimes an emerging infection is

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880
sometimes an emerging infection is
 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.590
sometimes an emerging infection is
really the what happens in aachen it

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600
really the what happens in aachen it
 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.230
really the what happens in aachen it
expanded host range of a virus so it's a

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240
expanded host range of a virus so it's a
 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.819
expanded host range of a virus so it's a
virus that's been around and infected

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829
virus that's been around and infected
 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.469
virus that's been around and infected
certain animals that we know about but

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479
certain animals that we know about but
 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:52.940
certain animals that we know about but
for some reason the host range changes

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950
for some reason the host range changes
 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.340
for some reason the host range changes
and we'll talk about today what kind of

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350
and we'll talk about today what kind of
 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.980
and we'll talk about today what kind of
things cause these hosts ranges it can

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990
things cause these hosts ranges it can
 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.319
things cause these hosts ranges it can
also be transmission of a virus from an

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329
also be transmission of a virus from an
 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.050
also be transmission of a virus from an
animal to humans what we call zoonosis

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060
animal to humans what we call zoonosis
 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.370
animal to humans what we call zoonosis
alright we have mentioned a couple of

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380
alright we have mentioned a couple of
 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.560
alright we have mentioned a couple of
times before in this course this is most

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570
times before in this course this is most
 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.029
times before in this course this is most
often what we think about when we talk

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039
often what we think about when we talk
 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.170
often what we think about when we talk
about emerging viruses sometimes the zoo

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180
about emerging viruses sometimes the zoo
 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.490
about emerging viruses sometimes the zoo
no seas or the zune

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500
no seas or the zune

nautic infections establish a new virus

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840
nautic infections establish a new virus
 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.870
nautic infections establish a new virus
in the population as we discussed for

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880
in the population as we discussed for
 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.020

HIV which moved from chimps to humans as
 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.060
HIV which moved from chimps to humans as
far as HIV 1 goes sometimes

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070
far as HIV 1 goes sometimes
 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.560
far as HIV 1 goes sometimes
cross-species infection a zoonosis

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570
cross-species infection a zoonosis
 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.800
cross-species infection a zoonosis
cannot be sustained so for HIV the

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810
cannot be sustained so for HIV the
 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.810
cannot be sustained so for HIV the
cross-species infection was obviously

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820
cross-species infection was obviously
 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.810
cross-species infection was obviously
sustained but for ebola and marburg we

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820
sustained but for ebola and marburg we
 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.000
sustained but for ebola and marburg we
have sporadic outbreaks where the virus

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010
have sporadic outbreaks where the virus
 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.460
have sporadic outbreaks where the virus
goes from a bat to a human there are

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470
goes from a bat to a human there are
 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.080
goes from a bat to a human there are
some infections of healthcare workers

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090
some infections of healthcare workers
 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.300
some infections of healthcare workers
because they happen to be close to the

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310
because they happen to be close to the
 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.790
because they happen to be close to the
sick people and they get infected with

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800
sick people and they get infected with
 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.830
sick people and they get infected with
blood or other fluids but for the most

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840
blood or other fluids but for the most
 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.650
blood or other fluids but for the most
part the virus is not transmitted well

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660
part the virus is not transmitted well
 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.260
part the virus is not transmitted well
and the press loves emerging infections

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270
and the press loves emerging infections
 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.560
and the press loves emerging infections
here's a newsweek cover with the killer

virus beyond the Ebola scare what else
 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.540
virus beyond the Ebola scare what else
is out there well as you'll see there's

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550
is out there well as you'll see there's
 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.600

me want to become a virologist when i

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220
me want to become a virologist when i

me want to become a virologist when i
read it many years ago actually a lot of

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830
read it many years ago actually a lot of
 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.270
read it many years ago actually a lot of
it takes place up at Columbia this

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280
it takes place up at Columbia this
 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.750
it takes place up at Columbia this
started in Africa and one of the sick

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760
started in Africa and one of the sick
 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.210
started in Africa and one of the sick
nurses she was airlifted to Columbia

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220
nurses she was airlifted to Columbia
 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.509
nurses she was airlifted to Columbia
they put her in a passenger 747 I just

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519
they put her in a passenger 747 I just
 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:35.509
they put her in a passenger 747 I just
put her in one of the seats and flew her

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:35.519
put her in one of the seats and flew her
 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:36.650
put her in one of the seats and flew her
to Colombia and they put her in

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660
to Colombia and they put her in
 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.000
to Colombia and they put her in
intensive care Colombia she actually

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010
intensive care Colombia she actually
 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.750
intensive care Colombia she actually
recovered and then a virologist working

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760
recovered and then a virologist working
 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.050
recovered and then a virologist working
on the virus infected himself and he

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060
on the virus infected himself and he
 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.750
on the virus infected himself and he
lived his name was your D Casals he

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760
lived his name was your D Casals he
 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.000
lived his name was your D Casals he
lived in Upper Manhattan and he worked

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010
lived in Upper Manhattan and he worked
 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.539
lived in Upper Manhattan and he worked
at Yale so they admitted him to Columbia

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549
at Yale so they admitted him to Columbia
 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:55.610
at Yale so they admitted him to Columbia
and they gave him the serum of the nurse

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620
and they gave him the serum of the nurse
 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.229
and they gave him the serum of the nurse
who had recovered and that saved his

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239
who had recovered and that saved his
 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:59.930
who had recovered and that saved his
life this is pretty cool story so anyway

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940
life this is pretty cool story so anyway
 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.360
life this is pretty cool story so anyway
yeah that's why I'm a virologist because

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370
yeah that's why I'm a virologist because
 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.490
yeah that's why I'm a virologist because
of stuff like that so that was the first

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500
of stuff like that so that was the first
 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.120
of stuff like that so that was the first
one I think the first story so there are

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130
one I think the first story so there are
 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.400
one I think the first story so there are
many factors that determine or allow

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410
many factors that determine or allow
 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.009

this course so to understand how viruses
emerge we have to look at the kinds of

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:08.370
emerge we have to look at the kinds of
 

00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:10.069
emerge we have to look at the kinds of
interactions that viruses have with

00:09:10.069 --> 00:09:10.079
interactions that viruses have with
 

00:09:10.079 --> 00:09:12.019
interactions that viruses have with
their hosts and those are shown on this

00:09:12.019 --> 00:09:12.029
their hosts and those are shown on this
 

00:09:12.029 --> 00:09:16.490
their hosts and those are shown on this
slide and there are really four main

00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:16.500
slide and there are really four main
 

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:18.050
slide and there are really four main
kinds of interactions the first is a

00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:18.060
kinds of interactions the first is a
 

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:20.420
kinds of interactions the first is a
stable interaction where the virus and

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:20.430
stable interaction where the virus and
 

00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:21.679
stable interaction where the virus and
the hosts have been together for a long

00:09:21.679 --> 00:09:21.689
the hosts have been together for a long
 

00:09:21.689 --> 00:09:23.509
the hosts have been together for a long
time this maintains the virus in the

00:09:23.509 --> 00:09:23.519
time this maintains the virus in the
 

00:09:23.519 --> 00:09:26.389
time this maintains the virus in the
ecosystem many often times the hosts are

00:09:26.389 --> 00:09:26.399

resistant infections where host the

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:33.480
resistant infections where host the
 

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:35.090
resistant infections where host the
virus is transferred to a new host but

00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:35.100
virus is transferred to a new host but
 

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:37.369
virus is transferred to a new host but
the host is not susceptible to infection

00:09:37.369 --> 00:09:37.379
the host is not susceptible to infection
 

00:09:37.379 --> 00:09:38.780
the host is not susceptible to infection
so that doesn't result in anything

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:38.790
so that doesn't result in anything
 

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:41.329
so that doesn't result in anything
happening there are evolving infections

00:09:41.329 --> 00:09:41.339
happening there are evolving infections
 

00:09:41.339 --> 00:09:43.809
happening there are evolving infections
when the virus first enters a species

00:09:43.809 --> 00:09:43.819
when the virus first enters a species
 

00:09:43.819 --> 00:09:47.119
when the virus first enters a species
and these are typically a naive

00:09:47.119 --> 00:09:47.129
and these are typically a naive
 

00:09:47.129 --> 00:09:48.949

as the host so the rabbits infected with
 

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:55.670
as the host so the rabbits infected with
myxoma virus that we talked about last

00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:55.680
myxoma virus that we talked about last
 

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:57.439
myxoma virus that we talked about last
time it's an evolving infection because

00:09:57.439 --> 00:09:57.449
time it's an evolving infection because
 

00:09:57.449 --> 00:09:59.120
time it's an evolving infection because
the rabbits and the virus are changing

00:09:59.120 --> 00:09:59.130
the rabbits and the virus are changing
 

00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:01.509
the rabbits and the virus are changing
every year and then we have dead end

00:10:01.509 --> 00:10:01.519
every year and then we have dead end
 

00:10:01.519 --> 00:10:04.100
every year and then we have dead end

it doesn't spread among humans so Ebola
 

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:11.600
it doesn't spread among humans so Ebola
this an example of that does not really

said both the virus and the host survive

00:10:20.569 --> 00:10:20.579
said both the virus and the host survive

and multiply sometimes these are
 

00:10:22.139 --> 00:10:25.550
and multiply sometimes these are
permanent interactions and there's some

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:25.560
permanent interactions and there's some
 

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:28.280

they are not without disease of course
 

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:37.910
they are not without disease of course
but they're stable within the human

00:10:57.319 --> 00:10:57.329
just people isn't a great strategy you
 

00:10:57.329 --> 00:10:58.970
just people isn't a great strategy you
take a bit of a risk but that's the way

00:10:58.970 --> 00:10:58.980
take a bit of a risk but that's the way
 

00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:01.460
take a bit of a risk but that's the way
evolution works right the there is no

00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:01.470
evolution works right the there is no
 

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:04.069

long-term view in evolution there is

00:11:04.069 --> 00:11:04.079
long-term view in evolution there is
 

00:11:04.079 --> 00:11:05.430
long-term view in evolution there is
just

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:05.440
just
 

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:07.920
just
works for the moment so you have I want

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:07.930
works for the moment so you have I want
 

00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:10.020
works for the moment so you have I want
you to remember that when a virus is

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:10.030
you to remember that when a virus is
 

00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:11.610
you to remember that when a virus is
evolving in the host it's not thinking

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:11.620
evolving in the host it's not thinking
 

00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:13.260
evolving in the host it's not thinking
about 10 years down the road it's not

00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:13.270
about 10 years down the road it's not
 

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:15.090
about 10 years down the road it's not
evolving for 10 years down the road it's

00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:15.100
evolving for 10 years down the road it's
 

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:16.670
evolving for 10 years down the road it's
evolving for what works at that moment

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:16.680
evolving for what works at that moment
 

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:19.770
evolving for what works at that moment
so at some point viruses evolved to

00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:19.780
so at some point viruses evolved to
 

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:21.780
so at some point viruses evolved to
infect just humans but of course if we

00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:21.790
infect just humans but of course if we
 

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:23.520
infect just humans but of course if we
disappear the viruses are gone too and

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:23.530
disappear the viruses are gone too and
 

00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:25.350
disappear the viruses are gone too and
over the years many species have

00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:25.360
over the years many species have
 

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:26.550
over the years many species have
disappeared and they've taken their

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:26.560
disappeared and they've taken their
 

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:28.950
disappeared and they've taken their
viruses with them so it must be a risk

00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:28.960
viruses with them so it must be a risk
 

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:31.200
viruses with them so it must be a risk
that is it that evolution takes because

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:31.210
that is it that evolution takes because
 

00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:33.470
that is it that evolution takes because
it happens over and over again an

00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:33.480
it happens over and over again an
 

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:36.720
it happens over and over again an
evolving host virus relationship the one

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:36.730

smallpox and measles virus were

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:52.180
smallpox and measles virus were
 

00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:54.690
smallpox and measles virus were
introduced into Native Americans by the

00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:54.700
introduced into Native Americans by the
 

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:59.280
introduced into Native Americans by the
colonists the old-world colonists and

00:11:59.280 --> 00:11:59.290
colonists the old-world colonists and
 

00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:02.070
colonists the old-world colonists and
slave traders and that devastated these

00:12:02.070 --> 00:12:02.080
slave traders and that devastated these
 

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:04.890
slave traders and that devastated these
populations introduction of West Nile

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:04.900
populations introduction of West Nile
 

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:07.470
populations introduction of West Nile
into the western hemisphere in 1999 so

00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:07.480
into the western hemisphere in 1999 so
 

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:09.300
into the western hemisphere in 1999 so
the virus came here from somewhere else

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:09.310
the virus came here from somewhere else
 

00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:12.240
the virus came here from somewhere else
it wasn't devastating was it was far

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:12.250
it wasn't devastating was it was far
 

00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:14.120
it wasn't devastating was it was far
more benign than and neither of these

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:14.130
more benign than and neither of these
 

00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:18.720
more benign than and neither of these
incidences so the fact that this is

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:18.730
incidences so the fact that this is
 

00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:20.340
incidences so the fact that this is
evolving means that there can be a lot

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:20.350
evolving means that there can be a lot
 

00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:23.310
evolving means that there can be a lot
of outcomes the virus may evolve to

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:23.320
of outcomes the virus may evolve to
 

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:26.310
of outcomes the virus may evolve to
increase its spread which may also lead

00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:26.320
increase its spread which may also lead
 

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:28.080
increase its spread which may also lead
to an increase in virulence it may or

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:28.090
to an increase in virulence it may or
 

00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:31.290
to an increase in virulence it may or
may not and the host may also change and

00:12:31.290 --> 00:12:31.300
may not and the host may also change and
 

00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:33.270
may not and the host may also change and
that can force the virus to change as

00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:33.280
that can force the virus to change as
 

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:35.370
that can force the virus to change as
well as the population changes say for

00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:35.380
well as the population changes say for
 

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:38.370
well as the population changes say for
during famine or wars that can put

00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:38.380
during famine or wars that can put
 

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:40.320
during famine or wars that can put
pressures on the evolving virus

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:40.330
pressures on the evolving virus
 

00:12:40.330 --> 00:12:41.850
pressures on the evolving virus
population as well so it's very

00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:41.860
population as well so it's very
 

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:43.680
population as well so it's very
complicated it's not a very it's not a

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:43.690
complicated it's not a very it's not a
 

00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:45.090
complicated it's not a very it's not a
straightforward cut-and-dried situation

00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:45.100
straightforward cut-and-dried situation
 

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:49.050
straightforward cut-and-dried situation
a dead end interaction is what happens

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:49.060
a dead end interaction is what happens
 

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:50.850
a dead end interaction is what happens
in many cross-species infections

00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:50.860
in many cross-species infections
 

00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:53.700
in many cross-species infections
typically not intraspecies so when we

00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:53.710
typically not intraspecies so when we
 

00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:56.790
typically not intraspecies so when we
get viruses from other humans they're

00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:56.800
get viruses from other humans they're
 

00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:59.400
get viruses from other humans they're
not typically dead end infections this

00:12:59.400 --> 00:12:59.410
not typically dead end infections this
 

00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:01.470
not typically dead end infections this
what would happen for example Marburg or

00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:01.480
what would happen for example Marburg or
 

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:04.950
what would happen for example Marburg or
Ebola going from a bat to a human often

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:04.960
Ebola going from a bat to a human often
 

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:06.720
Ebola going from a bat to a human often
the host is killed very quickly so there

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:06.730
the host is killed very quickly so there
 

00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:09.750
the host is killed very quickly so there
is no transmission but the virus is also

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:09.760
is no transmission but the virus is also
 

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:12.300
is no transmission but the virus is also
not adapted very well for transmission

00:13:12.300 --> 00:13:12.310
not adapted very well for transmission
 

00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:15.240
not adapted very well for transmission
to other hosts and that's here the new

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:15.250
to other hosts and that's here the new
 

00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:16.920
to other hosts and that's here the new
in fact that host cannot transmit maybe

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:16.930
in fact that host cannot transmit maybe
 

00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:18.660
in fact that host cannot transmit maybe
the virus doesn't replicate well in the

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:18.670
the virus doesn't replicate well in the
 

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:19.220
the virus doesn't replicate well in the
new host

00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:19.230
new host
 

00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:20.570
new host
can kill the host but it doesn't make a

00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:20.580
can kill the host but it doesn't make a
 

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:21.920
can kill the host but it doesn't make a
lot of particles so they're not

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:21.930
lot of particles so they're not
 

00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:23.930
lot of particles so they're not
effectively transmitted to other hosts

00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:23.940
effectively transmitted to other hosts
 

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:25.340
effectively transmitted to other hosts
it may be something that could evolve

00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:25.350
it may be something that could evolve
 

00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:28.040
it may be something that could evolve
over time but often it just doesn't you

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:28.050
over time but often it just doesn't you
 

00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:29.810
over time but often it just doesn't you
haven't the right collection of viruses

00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:29.820
haven't the right collection of viruses
 

00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:32.480
haven't the right collection of viruses
to do that so these contribute very

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:32.490
to do that so these contribute very
 

00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:35.480
to do that so these contribute very
little to spread Ebola is scary but it

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:35.490
little to spread Ebola is scary but it
 

00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:37.940
little to spread Ebola is scary but it
doesn't spread amongst people and so all

00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:37.950
doesn't spread amongst people and so all
 

00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:39.830
doesn't spread amongst people and so all
the hype on the cover of Newsweek is

00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:39.840
the hype on the cover of Newsweek is
 

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:42.560
the hype on the cover of Newsweek is
really hype because there's no evidence

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:42.570
really hype because there's no evidence
 

00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:44.180
really hype because there's no evidence
that it's much of a threat unless you go

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:44.190
that it's much of a threat unless you go
 

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:47.590
that it's much of a threat unless you go
to Africa and you contact a bat that has

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:47.600
to Africa and you contact a bat that has
 

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:51.020
to Africa and you contact a bat that has
the virus in it so let's look at a

00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:51.030
the virus in it so let's look at a
 

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:53.060
the virus in it so let's look at a
couple of these life cycles just so that

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:53.070
couple of these life cycles just so that
 

00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:55.850
couple of these life cycles just so that
you understand what's involved well we

00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:55.860
you understand what's involved well we
 

00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:58.340
you understand what's involved well we
instead of just putting the words on the

00:13:58.340 --> 00:13:58.350
instead of just putting the words on the
 

00:13:58.350 --> 00:14:01.430
instead of just putting the words on the
board so here's an arbol virus arbovirus

00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:01.440
board so here's an arbol virus arbovirus
 

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:02.900
board so here's an arbol virus arbovirus
is a word that simply means

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:02.910
is a word that simply means
 

00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:05.600
is a word that simply means
arthropod-borne and it can include

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:05.610
arthropod-borne and it can include
 

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:09.440
arthropod-borne and it can include
viruses from multiple families and here

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:09.450
viruses from multiple families and here
 

00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:12.260
viruses from multiple families and here
is an example of an arbol virus that is

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:12.270
is an example of an arbol virus that is
 

00:14:12.270 --> 00:14:13.940
is an example of an arbol virus that is
involved in a stable host virus

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:13.950
involved in a stable host virus
 

00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:16.520
involved in a stable host virus
relationship in wild birds and it's

00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:16.530
relationship in wild birds and it's
 

00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:18.890
relationship in wild birds and it's
transmitted among the wild birds by a

00:14:18.890 --> 00:14:18.900
transmitted among the wild birds by a
 

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:20.840
transmitted among the wild birds by a
mosquito vector so this is a stable

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:20.850
mosquito vector so this is a stable
 

00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:23.540
mosquito vector so this is a stable
interaction the mosquito is fine the

00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:23.550
interaction the mosquito is fine the
 

00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:27.080
interaction the mosquito is fine the
birds are fine they can transmit it to

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:27.090
birds are fine they can transmit it to
 

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:29.300
birds are fine they can transmit it to
other hosts if another mosquito bites

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:29.310
other hosts if another mosquito bites
 

00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:31.280
other hosts if another mosquito bites
some of these birds and involve another

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:31.290
some of these birds and involve another
 

00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:33.020
some of these birds and involve another
cycle as well so it can be complicated

00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:33.030
cycle as well so it can be complicated
 

00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:35.690
cycle as well so it can be complicated
and often domestic animals like chickens

00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:35.700
and often domestic animals like chickens
 

00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:38.330
and often domestic animals like chickens
can be infected and they are part of the

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:38.340
can be infected and they are part of the
 

00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:40.070
can be infected and they are part of the
natural cycle and they don't get sick as

00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:40.080
natural cycle and they don't get sick as
 

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:42.140
natural cycle and they don't get sick as
well so that's a stable interaction

00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:42.150
well so that's a stable interaction
 

00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:45.050
well so that's a stable interaction
there can be dead end hosts so when the

00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:45.060
there can be dead end hosts so when the
 

00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:47.840
there can be dead end hosts so when the
mosquito bites a horse or a human they

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:47.850
mosquito bites a horse or a human they
 

00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:50.150
mosquito bites a horse or a human they
can get infected they can have disease

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:50.160
can get infected they can have disease
 

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.130
can get infected they can have disease
because there are new hosts for this

00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:52.140
because there are new hosts for this
 

00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:54.170
because there are new hosts for this
virus but they typically don't spread it

00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:54.180
virus but they typically don't spread it
 

00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:56.630
virus but they typically don't spread it
to other hosts so how is this spread

00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:56.640
to other hosts so how is this spread
 

00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:59.210
to other hosts so how is this spread
it's spread by a mosquito vector they

00:14:59.210 --> 00:14:59.220
it's spread by a mosquito vector they
 

00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:00.890
it's spread by a mosquito vector they
typically don't pick up virus from

00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:00.900
typically don't pick up virus from
 

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:03.500
typically don't pick up virus from
people and spread it to someone else so

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:03.510
people and spread it to someone else so
 

00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:05.270
people and spread it to someone else so
that's a dead end host and a stable host

00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:05.280
that's a dead end host and a stable host
 

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:07.610
that's a dead end host and a stable host
virus interaction here's another example

00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:07.620
virus interaction here's another example
 

00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:12.380
virus interaction here's another example
of stable and dead end hosts with simply

00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:12.390
of stable and dead end hosts with simply
 

00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:14.480
of stable and dead end hosts with simply
another kind of virus and another vector

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:14.490
another kind of virus and another vector
 

00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:17.600
another kind of virus and another vector
this time it's a tick-borne virus which

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:17.610
this time it's a tick-borne virus which
 

00:15:17.610 --> 00:15:20.570
this time it's a tick-borne virus which
transmits the virus among rodents so it

00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:20.580
transmits the virus among rodents so it
 

00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:22.190
transmits the virus among rodents so it
goes from one road into another by the

00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:22.200
goes from one road into another by the
 

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:25.100
goes from one road into another by the
tick bite the tick is fine the rodent is

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:25.110
tick bite the tick is fine the rodent is
 

00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:27.010
tick bite the tick is fine the rodent is
fine it's a stable virus host

00:15:27.010 --> 00:15:27.020
fine it's a stable virus host
 

00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:30.650
fine it's a stable virus host
relationship even some goats can be the

00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:30.660
relationship even some goats can be the
 

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:32.519
relationship even some goats can be the
virus can be passed to

00:15:32.519 --> 00:15:32.529
virus can be passed to
 

00:15:32.529 --> 00:15:34.199
virus can be passed to
but they don't get silk they don't get

these are part of the natural cycle and

00:15:38.369 --> 00:15:38.379
these are part of the natural cycle and
 

00:15:38.379 --> 00:15:40.650
these are part of the natural cycle and
then when these tix bite humans which

00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:40.660
then when these tix bite humans which
 

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:42.239

happens if you go walking in the woods

00:15:42.239 --> 00:15:42.249
happens if you go walking in the woods
 

00:15:42.249 --> 00:15:44.100
happens if you go walking in the woods
and you get ticks on you they can bite

00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:44.110
and you get ticks on you they can bite
 

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:46.230
and you get ticks on you they can bite
you and give you viruses so you're a

00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:46.240
you and give you viruses so you're a
 

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:47.610
you and give you viruses so you're a
dead end host and you're likely to

00:15:47.610 --> 00:15:47.620
dead end host and you're likely to
 

00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:49.350
dead end host and you're likely to
develop some kind of disease depending

00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:49.360
develop some kind of disease depending
 

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:51.269
develop some kind of disease depending
on the virus and if you drink goat's

00:15:51.269 --> 00:15:51.279
on the virus and if you drink goat's
 

00:15:51.279 --> 00:15:53.309
on the virus and if you drink goat's
milk that hasn't been sufficiently

00:15:53.309 --> 00:15:53.319
milk that hasn't been sufficiently
 

00:15:53.319 --> 00:15:56.059
milk that hasn't been sufficiently
heated you can pick up the virus as well

00:15:56.059 --> 00:15:56.069
heated you can pick up the virus as well
 

00:15:56.069 --> 00:15:59.460
heated you can pick up the virus as well
other kinds of dead end infections so

00:15:59.460 --> 00:15:59.470
other kinds of dead end infections so
 

00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:01.980
other kinds of dead end infections so
we've looked at couple just generally

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:01.990
we've looked at couple just generally

when people go into the forest they get

00:16:21.119 --> 00:16:21.129
when people go into the forest they get
 

00:16:21.129 --> 00:16:23.610
when people go into the forest they get
bitten by the mosquitos and they get

00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:23.620
bitten by the mosquitos and they get

their number of infections in each of
 

00:17:03.639 --> 00:17:07.620
their number of infections in each of
them is initiated by a mouse laboratory

don't they don't transmit well amongst
 

00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:17.639
don't they don't transmit well amongst
the animals or if they do you have to

00:17:17.639 --> 00:17:17.649
the animals or if they do you have to
 

00:17:17.649 --> 00:17:20.309
the animals or if they do you have to
have some unusual conditions so putting

00:17:20.309 --> 00:17:20.319

way to transmit influenza virus but for
 

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:30.299
way to transmit influenza virus but for
the most part the lab infection is a

the virus has to be introduced somehow

00:17:59.960 --> 00:17:59.970
the virus has to be introduced somehow
 

00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:01.820
the virus has to be introduced somehow
into the population and that's where all

00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:01.830
into the population and that's where all
 

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:04.160

that helps introduce the viruses into

00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:13.440
that helps introduce the viruses into
 

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:15.500
that helps introduce the viruses into
population but then of course it has to

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:15.510
population but then of course it has to
 

00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:17.810
population but then of course it has to
establish itself and disseminate and as

00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:17.820
establish itself and disseminate and as
 

00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:19.820
establish itself and disseminate and as
we said often there's no establishment

00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:19.830
we said often there's no establishment
 

00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:21.560
we said often there's no establishment
there's a brief infection and then it's

00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:21.570
there's a brief infection and then it's
 

00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:24.290
there's a brief infection and then it's
over what is scary those are the viruses

00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:24.300
over what is scary those are the viruses
 

00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:25.640
over what is scary those are the viruses
are still there we never know when

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:25.650
are still there we never know when
 

00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:28.190
are still there we never know when
they're going to infect us so

00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:28.200
they're going to infect us so
 

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:31.130
they're going to infect us so
encountering new hosts this is probably

00:18:31.130 --> 00:18:31.140
encountering new hosts this is probably
 

00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:33.980
encountering new hosts this is probably
happening more than we now here in New

00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:33.990
happening more than we now here in New
 

00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:36.860
happening more than we now here in New
York City of course there aren't there

00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:36.870

be interesting to go to Central Park and

00:18:46.910 --> 00:18:46.920
be interesting to go to Central Park and
 

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:49.370
be interesting to go to Central Park and
survey there for viruses but for the

00:18:49.370 --> 00:18:49.380
survey there for viruses but for the
 

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:51.080
survey there for viruses but for the
most part the encounters are going to

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:51.090
most part the encounters are going to
 

00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:54.440
most part the encounters are going to
happen in areas where there are there

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:54.450
happen in areas where there are there
 

00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:56.840
happen in areas where there are there
are borders between where humans live in

00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:56.850
are borders between where humans live in
 

00:18:56.850 --> 00:19:00.890
are borders between where humans live in
animals so there are a lot of encounters

00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:00.900
animals so there are a lot of encounters
 

00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:02.510
animals so there are a lot of encounters
even in those regions if you live where

00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:02.520
even in those regions if you live where
 

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:04.250
even in those regions if you live where
there are bats for example you probably

00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:04.260
there are bats for example you probably
 

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:05.830
there are bats for example you probably
are infected now and then but you never

00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:05.840
are infected now and then but you never
 

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:08.090
are infected now and then but you never
detect the infection because it never

00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:08.100
detect the infection because it never
 

00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:10.760
detect the infection because it never
takes hold so you get single so-called

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:10.770
takes hold so you get single so-called
 

00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:12.920
takes hold so you get single so-called
single host infections you go in a cave

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:12.930
single host infections you go in a cave
 

00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:15.830
single host infections you go in a cave

fine as I have said pig farmers tend to

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:46.970
fine as I have said pig farmers tend to
 

00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:49.330

plant mango trees next to the pig pens

00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:49.340
plant mango trees next to the pig pens
 

00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:52.450
plant mango trees next to the pig pens
and at night the bats come and they eat

00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:52.460
and at night the bats come and they eat
 

00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:54.370
and at night the bats come and they eat
the mangoes and they urinate on the

00:24:54.370 --> 00:24:54.380
the mangoes and they urinate on the
 

00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:56.650
the mangoes and they urinate on the
fruit and then the next day the pigs eat

00:24:56.650 --> 00:24:56.660
fruit and then the next day the pigs eat
 

00:24:56.660 --> 00:24:57.970
fruit and then the next day the pigs eat
the mangoes that have fallen to the

00:24:57.970 --> 00:24:57.980
the mangoes that have fallen to the
 

00:24:57.980 --> 00:24:59.440
the mangoes that have fallen to the
ground and they get infected with the

00:24:59.440 --> 00:24:59.450
ground and they get infected with the
 

00:24:59.450 --> 00:25:01.810
ground and they get infected with the
virus pigs get sick and then the pig

00:25:01.810 --> 00:25:01.820
virus pigs get sick and then the pig
 

00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:03.460
virus pigs get sick and then the pig
handlers come in to take care of the

00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:03.470
handlers come in to take care of the
 

00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:05.410
handlers come in to take care of the
pigs and they get sick as well so it

00:25:05.410 --> 00:25:05.420
pigs and they get sick as well so it
 

00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:08.200
pigs and they get sick as well so it
goes from bats to pigs to humans so a

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:08.210
goes from bats to pigs to humans so a
 

00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:09.940
goes from bats to pigs to humans so a
solution would be to get rid of the

there's no evidence that it's going from
 

00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:34.300
there's no evidence that it's going from
person to person they're just outbreaks

the forest and then you humans encroach
 

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:54.090
the forest and then you humans encroach
so it's a tropical infection because the

00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:54.100
so it's a tropical infection because the
 

00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:55.830
so it's a tropical infection because the
mosquitoes don't live when it gets too

00:26:55.830 --> 00:26:55.840
mosquitoes don't live when it gets too
 

00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:57.300
mosquitoes don't live when it gets too
cold and this is an example of an

00:26:57.300 --> 00:26:57.310
cold and this is an example of an
 

00:26:57.310 --> 00:27:00.570
cold and this is an example of an
outbreak in Philadelphia in 1793 was

00:27:00.570 --> 00:27:00.580
outbreak in Philadelphia in 1793 was
 

00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:03.030
outbreak in Philadelphia in 1793 was
imported from Santo Domingo so people

00:27:03.030 --> 00:27:03.040
imported from Santo Domingo so people
 

00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:05.370
imported from Santo Domingo so people
come on boats and they go to

00:27:05.370 --> 00:27:05.380
come on boats and they go to
 

00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:06.960
come on boats and they go to
Philadelphia they're infected they don't

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:06.970
Philadelphia they're infected they don't
 

00:27:06.970 --> 00:27:08.970
Philadelphia they're infected they don't
have symptoms so they come in and then

00:27:08.970 --> 00:27:08.980
have symptoms so they come in and then
 

00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:12.420
have symptoms so they come in and then
the virus can be spread amongst humans

00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:12.430
the virus can be spread amongst humans
 

00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:15.420
the virus can be spread amongst humans
it's an unusual cycle and here's a case

00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:15.430
it's an unusual cycle and here's a case
 

00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:18.360
it's an unusual cycle and here's a case
count from august to november this is

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:18.370
count from august to november this is
 

00:27:18.370 --> 00:27:21.270
count from august to november this is
daily burials big outbreak quite a bit

daily burials big outbreak quite a bit
of the population was affected and then

00:27:23.970 --> 00:27:23.980
of the population was affected and then
 

00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:26.340
of the population was affected and then
in late october november it stopped

00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:26.350
in late october november it stopped
 

00:27:26.350 --> 00:27:27.930
in late october november it stopped
because of the mosquitoes were killed by

00:27:27.930 --> 00:27:27.940
because of the mosquitoes were killed by
 

00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:31.740
because of the mosquitoes were killed by
the cold temperatures in philadelphia so

00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:31.750
the cold temperatures in philadelphia so
 

00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:33.750
the cold temperatures in philadelphia so
you can bring the diseases elsewhere as

00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:33.760
you can bring the diseases elsewhere as
 

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:36.810
you can bring the diseases elsewhere as
well if you have enough humans to

00:27:36.810 --> 00:27:36.820
well if you have enough humans to
 

00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:41.370
well if you have enough humans to
sustain transmission of the virus there

00:27:41.370 --> 00:27:41.380
sustain transmission of the virus there
 

00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:44.510
sustain transmission of the virus there
are also many examples of diseases of

00:27:44.510 --> 00:27:44.520
are also many examples of diseases of
 

00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:47.490
are also many examples of diseases of

virus to a new population to them it's
 

00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:57.840
virus to a new population to them it's
an emerging infection and when this

00:27:57.840 --> 00:27:57.850
an emerging infection and when this
 

00:27:57.850 --> 00:27:59.520
an emerging infection and when this
happens you often have explosive

00:27:59.520 --> 00:27:59.530
happens you often have explosive

this doesn't happen now of course
 

00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:53.290
this doesn't happen now of course
because with global travel viruses can

00:28:53.290 --> 00:28:53.300
because with global travel viruses can
 

00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:55.960
because with global travel viruses can
be everywhere but there's always the

be everywhere but there's always the
 

00:28:55.970 --> 00:28:59.290
be everywhere but there's always the
possibility that a brand new virus comes

possibility that a brand new virus comes
into a new population and you have

00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:03.530
into a new population and you have

into a new population and you have
explosive spread I don't think it would

00:29:04.930 --> 00:29:04.940
explosive spread I don't think it would
 

00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:06.610
explosive spread I don't think it would
happen because with medicine being so

00:29:06.610 --> 00:29:06.620
happen because with medicine being so
 

00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:08.410
happen because with medicine being so
good and responsive nowadays we can

00:29:08.410 --> 00:29:08.420
good and responsive nowadays we can
 

00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:12.820
good and responsive nowadays we can
probably quell the outbreak so there's a

00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:12.830
probably quell the outbreak so there's a
 

00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:15.130
probably quell the outbreak so there's a

it was made in consultation with Ian

00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:45.860
it was made in consultation with Ian

Lipkin who is a neurologist up at the

00:29:48.250 --> 00:29:48.260
Lipkin who is a neurologist up at the
 

00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:50.169
Lipkin who is a neurologist up at the
Medical Center so you'll hear his name

00:29:50.169 --> 00:29:50.179
Medical Center so you'll hear his name
 

00:29:50.179 --> 00:29:54.940
Medical Center so you'll hear his name
in it so check it out sorry oh here he

00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:54.950
in it so check it out sorry oh here he
 

00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:57.549
in it so check it out sorry oh here he
helped write the script yeah yeah he got

00:29:57.549 --> 00:29:57.559
helped write the script yeah yeah he got
 

00:29:57.559 --> 00:30:00.549
helped write the script yeah yeah he got
paid for it he's very happy he's very

00:30:00.549 --> 00:30:00.559
paid for it he's very happy he's very
 

00:30:00.559 --> 00:30:01.990
paid for it he's very happy he's very
happy to have dealt with it and they

00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:02.000
happy to have dealt with it and they
 

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.060
happy to have dealt with it and they
mentioned his name in it so he's really

00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:04.070
mentioned his name in it so he's really
 

00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:09.549
mentioned his name in it so he's really
happened contagion actually Kate and

00:30:09.549 --> 00:30:09.559
happened contagion actually Kate and
 

00:30:09.559 --> 00:30:12.310
happened contagion actually Kate and
Kate Kate Winslet and Matt Damon went to

00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:12.320
Kate Kate Winslet and Matt Damon went to
 

00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:13.750
Kate Kate Winslet and Matt Damon went to
his lab for like two days to learn how

00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:13.760
his lab for like two days to learn how
 

00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:15.130
his lab for like two days to learn how
to pipette so they wouldn't look like

00:30:15.130 --> 00:30:15.140
to pipette so they wouldn't look like
 

00:30:15.140 --> 00:30:21.760
to pipette so they wouldn't look like
idiots in the movie good but he had his

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:21.770
idiots in the movie good but he had his
 

00:30:21.770 --> 00:30:23.290
idiots in the movie good but he had his
text teach them he didn't do it himself

00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:23.300
text teach them he didn't do it himself
 

00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:25.270
text teach them he didn't do it himself
so because he doesn't add a pipette

00:30:25.270 --> 00:30:25.280
so because he doesn't add a pipette
 

00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:29.530
so because he doesn't add a pipette
anymore I guess polio is another example

00:30:29.530 --> 00:30:29.540
anymore I guess polio is another example
 

00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:31.840
anymore I guess polio is another example
of an emerging infection this time by

of an emerging infection this time by
 

00:30:31.850 --> 00:30:34.110
of an emerging infection this time by
changes in human populations and

00:30:34.110 --> 00:30:34.120
changes in human populations and
 

00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:36.970
changes in human populations and
environments polio emerged at the

00:30:36.970 --> 00:30:36.980
environments polio emerged at the
 

00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:39.580
environments polio emerged at the
beginning of the 20th century because of

00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:39.590
beginning of the 20th century because of
 

00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:42.160
beginning of the 20th century because of
improvements in sanitation the virus has

00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:42.170
improvements in sanitation the virus has
 

00:30:42.170 --> 00:30:44.020
improvements in sanitation the virus has
been around probably since four thousand

00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:44.030
been around probably since four thousand
 

00:30:44.030 --> 00:30:45.669
been around probably since four thousand
years ago but just caused a little case

00:30:45.669 --> 00:30:45.679
years ago but just caused a little case
 

00:30:45.679 --> 00:30:48.549
years ago but just caused a little case
here and there just small isolated cases

00:30:48.549 --> 00:30:48.559
here and there just small isolated cases
 

00:30:48.559 --> 00:30:50.710
here and there just small isolated cases
was it was a stable host virus

00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:50.720
was it was a stable host virus
 

00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:53.260
was it was a stable host virus
relationship but then we improved

00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:53.270
relationship but then we improved
 

00:30:53.270 --> 00:30:55.330
relationship but then we improved
sanitation and delayed infection till

00:30:55.330 --> 00:30:55.340
sanitation and delayed infection till
 

00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:57.610
sanitation and delayed infection till
when we were older instead of when we

00:30:57.610 --> 00:30:57.620
when we were older instead of when we
 

00:30:57.620 --> 00:31:01.090
when we were older instead of when we
were babies and that made the virus more

00:31:01.090 --> 00:31:01.100
were babies and that made the virus more
 

00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:03.640

it was changed I think it was also going

00:32:49.690 --> 00:32:49.700
it was changed I think it was also going
 

00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:50.950
it was changed I think it was also going
to be called four corners and they

00:32:50.950 --> 00:32:50.960
to be called four corners and they
 

00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:52.690
to be called four corners and they
didn't like that either so they ended up

00:32:52.690 --> 00:32:52.700
didn't like that either so they ended up
 

00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:56.950

peromyscus maniculatus and what happened

00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:15.950
peromyscus maniculatus and what happened
 

00:33:15.950 --> 00:33:17.230
peromyscus maniculatus and what happened
was in 1990

00:33:17.230 --> 00:33:17.240
was in 1990
 

00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:19.540
was in 1990
to it was a lot of rainfall more more

00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:19.550
to it was a lot of rainfall more more
 

00:33:19.550 --> 00:33:22.750
to it was a lot of rainfall more more
than usual and as a result there were a

00:33:22.750 --> 00:33:22.760
than usual and as a result there were a
 

00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:25.960

York City but you can grow them out
 

00:33:32.330 --> 00:33:34.750
York City but you can grow them out
there there was big crops this year so

00:33:34.750 --> 00:33:34.760
there there was big crops this year so
 

00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:36.550
there there was big crops this year so
there are a lot of mice and the mice got

00:33:36.550 --> 00:33:36.560
there are a lot of mice and the mice got
 

00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:38.320
there are a lot of mice and the mice got
into people's homes and the mice carry

00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:38.330
into people's homes and the mice carry
 

00:33:38.330 --> 00:33:41.320
into people's homes and the mice carry
the virus and the virus is present in

00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:41.330
the virus and the virus is present in
 

00:33:41.330 --> 00:33:43.630
the virus and the virus is present in
urine and excreta of the mice and it

00:33:43.630 --> 00:33:43.640
urine and excreta of the mice and it
 

00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:46.210
urine and excreta of the mice and it
eros Eliza's and infects the people so

00:33:46.210 --> 00:33:46.220
eros Eliza's and infects the people so
 

00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:48.180
eros Eliza's and infects the people so
more mice more contact with humans and

00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:48.190
more mice more contact with humans and
 

00:33:48.190 --> 00:33:51.400
more mice more contact with humans and
then they found virus and contaminated

00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:51.410
then they found virus and contaminated
 

00:33:51.410 --> 00:33:53.380
then they found virus and contaminated
blankets and dust on the floors of the

00:33:53.380 --> 00:33:53.390
blankets and dust on the floors of the
 

00:33:53.390 --> 00:33:56.350
blankets and dust on the floors of the
homes of the people who were infected so

00:33:56.350 --> 00:33:56.360
homes of the people who were infected so
 

00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:59.470
homes of the people who were infected so
we are not the natural host for this

00:33:59.470 --> 00:33:59.480
we are not the natural host for this
 

00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:02.260
we are not the natural host for this
virus and it doesn't go from person to

00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:02.270
virus and it doesn't go from person to
 

00:34:02.270 --> 00:34:04.540
virus and it doesn't go from person to
person it goes from a mouse to you and

00:34:04.540 --> 00:34:04.550
person it goes from a mouse to you and
 

00:34:04.550 --> 00:34:07.510
person it goes from a mouse to you and
there can be a lot of infections in a

00:34:07.510 --> 00:34:07.520
there can be a lot of infections in a
 

00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:08.880
there can be a lot of infections in a
given time if there are a lot of mice

00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:08.890
given time if there are a lot of mice
 

00:34:08.890 --> 00:34:11.110
given time if there are a lot of mice
excreting virus but it doesn't transmit

00:34:11.110 --> 00:34:11.120
excreting virus but it doesn't transmit
 

00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:14.770
excreting virus but it doesn't transmit
so it's a dead end kind of infection so

00:34:14.770 --> 00:34:14.780
so it's a dead end kind of infection so
 

00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:17.860
so it's a dead end kind of infection so
this is the distribution of cases of

00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:17.870
this is the distribution of cases of
 

00:34:17.870 --> 00:34:20.320
this is the distribution of cases of
infection with seen nombre virus these

00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:20.330
infection with seen nombre virus these
 

00:34:20.330 --> 00:34:24.100
infection with seen nombre virus these
are the orange dots and the green is the

00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:24.110
are the orange dots and the green is the
 

00:34:24.110 --> 00:34:26.050
are the orange dots and the green is the
crew distribution of the mouse

00:34:26.050 --> 00:34:26.060
crew distribution of the mouse
 

00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:28.690
crew distribution of the mouse
peromyscus maniculatus so you can see

00:34:28.690 --> 00:34:28.700
peromyscus maniculatus so you can see
 

00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:31.180
peromyscus maniculatus so you can see
the two go quite well hand in hand there

00:34:31.180 --> 00:34:31.190
the two go quite well hand in hand there
 

00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:34.750
the two go quite well hand in hand there
are a few isolated cases outside of the

00:34:34.750 --> 00:34:34.760
are a few isolated cases outside of the
 

00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:36.250
are a few isolated cases outside of the
normal range of the mice probably due to

00:34:36.250 --> 00:34:36.260
normal range of the mice probably due to
 

00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:38.320
normal range of the mice probably due to
travel there was actually a case out on

00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:38.330
travel there was actually a case out on
 

00:34:38.330 --> 00:34:40.570

Long Island just won a number of years

00:34:40.570 --> 00:34:40.580
Long Island just won a number of years
 

00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:43.210
Long Island just won a number of years
ago probably not the same virus but

00:34:43.210 --> 00:34:43.220
ago probably not the same virus but
 

00:34:43.220 --> 00:34:46.480
ago probably not the same virus but
highly related and probably spread by a

00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:46.490
highly related and probably spread by a
 

00:34:46.490 --> 00:34:50.760

349 cases so not a lot but it's it's

00:34:55.030 --> 00:34:55.040
349 cases so not a lot but it's it's
 

00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:57.970
349 cases so not a lot but it's it's
again an example of what can happen when

00:34:57.970 --> 00:34:57.980
again an example of what can happen when
 

00:34:57.980 --> 00:35:00.160
again an example of what can happen when
the conditions change in this case a big

00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:00.170
the conditions change in this case a big
 

00:35:00.170 --> 00:35:02.800
the conditions change in this case a big
rainfall these are other viruses related

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:02.810

to see nombre virus there's distributed

00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:07.610
to see nombre virus there's distributed
 

00:35:07.610 --> 00:35:09.280

those that have been
associated with human diseases so you

00:35:32.350 --> 00:35:32.360
associated with human diseases so you
 

00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:33.820
associated with human diseases so you
can see there are a lot of these around

00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:33.830
can see there are a lot of these around
 

00:35:33.830 --> 00:35:36.940

nombre virus did so there are lots of

00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:42.530
nombre virus did so there are lots of

was very interesting about the SARS

00:40:15.770 --> 00:40:15.780
was very interesting about the SARS
 

00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:18.289
was very interesting about the SARS
outbreak was that there was a very

00:40:18.289 --> 00:40:18.299
outbreak was that there was a very
 

00:40:18.299 --> 00:40:20.569
outbreak was that there was a very
effective global alert system put in

00:40:20.569 --> 00:40:20.579
effective global alert system put in
 

00:40:20.579 --> 00:40:23.180

Organization and this really helped to
 

00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:29.150
Organization and this really helped to
limit the spread of infection so for

00:40:29.150 --> 00:40:29.160
limit the spread of infection so for
 

00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:31.250
limit the spread of infection so for
example remember the original outbreak

the month it was decided that people
 

00:40:48.690 --> 00:40:51.319
the month it was decided that people
with the disease were traveling and that

00:40:51.319 --> 00:40:51.329
with the disease were traveling and that
 

00:40:51.329 --> 00:40:53.599
with the disease were traveling and that
that proposed some kind of a risk so

00:40:53.599 --> 00:40:53.609
that proposed some kind of a risk so
 

00:40:53.609 --> 00:40:55.400
that proposed some kind of a risk so
they wanted everyone to be aware of that

market you can buy them and they took

00:46:22.460 --> 00:46:22.470
market you can buy them and they took
 

00:46:22.470 --> 00:46:24.500
market you can buy them and they took
some of these and they found virus in

00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:24.510
some of these and they found virus in
 

00:46:24.510 --> 00:46:28.550
some of these and they found virus in
them and so there was epidemiological

so the the markets were effectively shut

00:46:38.660 --> 00:46:38.670
so the the markets were effectively shut
 

00:46:38.670 --> 00:46:42.170
so the the markets were effectively shut
down you couldn't sell meat live meat in

00:46:42.170 --> 00:46:42.180
down you couldn't sell meat live meat in
 

00:46:42.180 --> 00:46:44.210
down you couldn't sell meat live meat in
those markets for a long time all the

those markets for a long time all the
 

00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:46.880
those markets for a long time all the
civets they could find were killed and

00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:46.890
civets they could find were killed and
 

00:46:46.890 --> 00:46:48.980
civets they could find were killed and
eventually the infection stopped but

eventually the infection stopped but
 

00:46:48.990 --> 00:46:50.900
eventually the infection stopped but
probably this is not the reservoir the

you would expect to find more diversity

00:47:00.890 --> 00:47:00.900
you would expect to find more diversity

this virus which strongly suggests that

00:47:34.730 --> 00:47:34.740
this virus which strongly suggests that
 

00:47:34.740 --> 00:47:38.150
this virus which strongly suggests that
this is the reservoir for infection the

00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:38.160
this is the reservoir for infection the
 

00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:41.510
this is the reservoir for infection the

isolates and the human or the civet
 

00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:49.010

strains so these could easily be the

00:47:49.010 --> 00:47:49.020
strains so these could easily be the
 

00:47:49.020 --> 00:47:50.810

precursor they pass through a bottleneck

00:47:50.810 --> 00:47:50.820
precursor they pass through a bottleneck
 

00:47:50.820 --> 00:47:52.730

and then in humans and civets they're

00:47:52.730 --> 00:47:52.740
and then in humans and civets they're
 

00:47:52.740 --> 00:47:56.780
and then in humans and civets they're
all very similar so there's more genetic

00:47:56.780 --> 00:47:56.790
all very similar so there's more genetic
 

00:47:56.790 --> 00:47:58.370
all very similar so there's more genetic

would expect if they are the reservoir
 

00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:03.470
would expect if they are the reservoir
of the infection so the idea now is and

of the infection so the idea now is and
 

00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:05.060
of the infection so the idea now is and
we can't prove it but bats are the

we can't prove it but bats are the
 

00:48:05.070 --> 00:48:08.020

that are then brought to the market it's

00:48:10.910 --> 00:48:10.920
that are then brought to the market it's
 

00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:13.430

not clear how this occurs and why it's

00:48:13.430 --> 00:48:13.440
not clear how this occurs and why it's
 

00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:15.590
not clear how this occurs and why it's
not present in civets in the wild so bat

00:48:15.590 --> 00:48:15.600
not present in civets in the wild so bat
 

00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:19.400
not present in civets in the wild so bat
to civet and then to human so no bats

00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:19.410

there are no bats in the in the meat

00:48:21.410 --> 00:48:21.420
there are no bats in the in the meat

this binding area and in the idea is
 

00:50:55.240 --> 00:50:58.589
this binding area and in the idea is
that they reduce the affinity of the

have been looked at structurally so this

00:51:02.580 --> 00:51:02.590
have been looked at structurally so this
 

00:51:02.590 --> 00:51:03.990
have been looked at structurally so this
is probably correct so that's why the

these for me no acid changes this is the
 

00:51:14.170 --> 00:51:17.430
these for me no acid changes this is the
sequence of a human strain isolated from

00:51:17.430 --> 00:51:17.440
sequence of a human strain isolated from
 

00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:21.090
sequence of a human strain isolated from
humans in 2003-2004 so this was from an

00:51:21.090 --> 00:51:21.100
humans in 2003-2004 so this was from an
 

00:51:21.100 --> 00:51:24.800
humans in 2003-2004 so this was from an
outbreak which was much more mild than

00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:24.810
outbreak which was much more mild than
 

00:51:24.810 --> 00:51:27.570
outbreak which was much more mild than
that caused by the original virus and

00:51:27.570 --> 00:51:27.580
that caused by the original virus and
 

00:51:27.580 --> 00:51:29.280
that caused by the original virus and
you can see there are changes in this

00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:29.290
you can see there are changes in this
 

00:51:29.290 --> 00:51:31.410
you can see there are changes in this
glycoprotein which reduced its affinity

00:51:31.410 --> 00:51:31.420
glycoprotein which reduced its affinity
 

00:51:31.420 --> 00:51:34.740
glycoprotein which reduced its affinity
also for the cell receptor so this

00:51:34.740 --> 00:51:34.750
also for the cell receptor so this
 

00:51:34.750 --> 00:51:37.470
also for the cell receptor so this
suggests that that this these changes

00:51:37.470 --> 00:51:37.480
suggests that that this these changes
 

00:51:37.480 --> 00:51:40.020
suggests that that this these changes

rat cells very well and the reason is
 

00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:02.820
rat cells very well and the reason is
that the receptors don't interact very

00:52:02.820 --> 00:52:02.830
that the receptors don't interact very
 

00:52:02.830 --> 00:52:08.370
that the receptors don't interact very
well so will it come back so since then

00:52:08.370 --> 00:52:08.380
well so will it come back so since then
 

00:52:08.380 --> 00:52:10.440
well so will it come back so since then

canine parvovirus brand new infection of
 

00:54:23.270 --> 00:54:26.819
canine parvovirus brand new infection of
the intestine and the heart in dogs and

00:54:26.819 --> 00:54:26.829
the intestine and the heart in dogs and
 

00:54:26.829 --> 00:54:30.040
the intestine and the heart in dogs and
evolved from a cat virus feline

00:54:30.040 --> 00:54:30.050
evolved from a cat virus feline
 

00:54:30.050 --> 00:54:34.530

panleukopenia virus common virus of cats

00:54:34.530 --> 00:54:34.540
panleukopenia virus common virus of cats
 

00:54:34.540 --> 00:54:38.500
panleukopenia virus common virus of cats
somehow the virus around 1978 got from a

00:54:38.500 --> 00:54:38.510
somehow the virus around 1978 got from a
 

00:54:38.510 --> 00:54:41.230
somehow the virus around 1978 got from a
cat into a dog and then just took off

00:54:41.230 --> 00:54:41.240
cat into a dog and then just took off
 

00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:44.349
cat into a dog and then just took off
and that virus that's now well adapted

00:54:44.349 --> 00:54:44.359
and that virus that's now well adapted
 

00:54:44.359 --> 00:54:47.200
and that virus that's now well adapted
to dogs doesn't affect cats anymore cats

00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:47.210
to dogs doesn't affect cats anymore cats
 

00:54:47.210 --> 00:54:50.349
to dogs doesn't affect cats anymore cats
still have feline panleukopenia but the

00:54:50.349 --> 00:54:50.359
still have feline panleukopenia but the
 

00:54:50.359 --> 00:54:53.770
still have feline panleukopenia but the
new virus that they gave to dogs can't

00:54:53.770 --> 00:54:53.780
new virus that they gave to dogs can't
 

00:54:53.780 --> 00:54:55.839
new virus that they gave to dogs can't
infect them innate anymore so this is

00:54:55.839 --> 00:54:55.849
infect them innate anymore so this is
 

00:54:55.849 --> 00:54:58.210
infect them innate anymore so this is
the gift of cats to their canine friends

00:54:58.210 --> 00:54:58.220
the gift of cats to their canine friends
 

00:54:58.220 --> 00:55:01.390
the gift of cats to their canine friends
canine parvovirus so now we have to

00:55:01.390 --> 00:55:01.400
canine parvovirus so now we have to
 

00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:03.400
canine parvovirus so now we have to
immunize our animals against it so where

00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:03.410
immunize our animals against it so where
 

00:55:03.410 --> 00:55:07.150
immunize our animals against it so where
did this virus come from because it was

00:55:07.150 --> 00:55:07.160
did this virus come from because it was
 

00:55:07.160 --> 00:55:10.930
did this virus come from because it was
a pretty recent jump from cats to dog it

00:55:10.930 --> 00:55:10.940
a pretty recent jump from cats to dog it
 

00:55:10.940 --> 00:55:13.089
a pretty recent jump from cats to dog it
was possible to go back and get all the

dogs of course are always eating

00:55:41.289 --> 00:55:41.299
dogs of course are always eating
 

00:55:41.299 --> 00:55:43.719
dogs of course are always eating
everything so that's how it got into the

00:55:43.719 --> 00:55:43.729
everything so that's how it got into the
 

00:55:43.729 --> 00:55:45.609
everything so that's how it got into the
dog that's how it infects dog by

it took for this cat virus to then

00:56:00.759 --> 00:56:00.769
it took for this cat virus to then
 

00:56:00.769 --> 00:56:03.959
it took for this cat virus to then
infect mouse cells to amino acid changes

00:56:03.959 --> 00:56:03.969
infect mouse cells to amino acid changes
 

00:56:03.969 --> 00:56:06.670
infect mouse cells to amino acid changes
so this is a diagram of the capsid of

00:56:06.670 --> 00:56:06.680
so this is a diagram of the capsid of
 

00:56:06.680 --> 00:56:10.870
so this is a diagram of the capsid of
this virus this is a DNA containing

00:56:10.870 --> 00:56:10.880
this virus this is a DNA containing
 

00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:12.219
this virus this is a DNA containing
virus single-stranded with an

00:56:12.219 --> 00:56:12.229
virus single-stranded with an
 

00:56:12.229 --> 00:56:14.709
virus single-stranded with an
icosahedral capsid the receptor is the

00:56:14.709 --> 00:56:14.719
icosahedral capsid the receptor is the
 

00:56:14.719 --> 00:56:16.839
icosahedral capsid the receptor is the
transferrin receptor which is shown here

00:56:16.839 --> 00:56:16.849
transferrin receptor which is shown here
 

00:56:16.849 --> 00:56:19.630
transferrin receptor which is shown here
not attached to the cell membrane just

00:56:19.630 --> 00:56:19.640
not attached to the cell membrane just
 

00:56:19.640 --> 00:56:21.099
not attached to the cell membrane just
stuck on the binding site so there are

00:56:21.099 --> 00:56:21.109
stuck on the binding site so there are
 

00:56:21.109 --> 00:56:23.439
stuck on the binding site so there are
two amino acid changes in the capsid

00:56:23.439 --> 00:56:23.449
two amino acid changes in the capsid
 

00:56:23.449 --> 00:56:26.849
two amino acid changes in the capsid
here that allow the virus to buy now dog

00:56:26.849 --> 00:56:26.859
here that allow the virus to buy now dog
 

00:56:26.859 --> 00:56:29.679
here that allow the virus to buy now dog
transferrin receptor instead of the cat

00:56:29.679 --> 00:56:29.689
transferrin receptor instead of the cat
 

00:56:29.689 --> 00:56:31.929
transferrin receptor instead of the cat
transferrin receptor so this is a really

00:56:31.929 --> 00:56:31.939
transferrin receptor so this is a really
 

00:56:31.939 --> 00:56:34.419
transferrin receptor so this is a really
nice story that was since it was recent

00:56:34.419 --> 00:56:34.429
nice story that was since it was recent
 

00:56:34.429 --> 00:56:36.160
nice story that was since it was recent
we could sort out because we had all the

we could sort out because we had all the
 

00:56:36.170 --> 00:56:39.269
we could sort out because we had all the
isolates so the original variants that

00:56:39.269 --> 00:56:39.279
isolates so the original variants that
 

00:56:39.279 --> 00:56:42.459
isolates so the original variants that
involved in dogs have evolved in dogs so

00:56:42.459 --> 00:56:42.469
involved in dogs have evolved in dogs so
 

00:56:42.469 --> 00:56:44.349
involved in dogs have evolved in dogs so
this is an evolving virus host

00:56:44.349 --> 00:56:44.359
this is an evolving virus host
 

00:56:44.359 --> 00:56:47.079

to vary so this virus is now global it's

00:56:54.969 --> 00:56:54.979
to vary so this virus is now global it's
 

00:56:54.979 --> 00:56:57.130
to vary so this virus is now global it's
all around the world and it's varying

00:56:57.130 --> 00:56:57.140
all around the world and it's varying
 

00:56:57.140 --> 00:56:58.719
all around the world and it's varying
extensively I guess at some point it

saw it happen in real time and when it

00:57:20.919 --> 00:57:20.929
saw it happen in real time and when it
 

00:57:20.929 --> 00:57:23.079
saw it happen in real time and when it
occurs the outcome can be severe so dogs

00:57:23.079 --> 00:57:23.089
occurs the outcome can be severe so dogs
 

00:57:23.089 --> 00:57:24.579
occurs the outcome can be severe so dogs
are made very sick by this and that's

00:57:24.579 --> 00:57:24.589
are made very sick by this and that's
 

00:57:24.589 --> 00:57:26.589
are made very sick by this and that's
why you need to immunize them against

00:57:26.589 --> 00:57:26.599
why you need to immunize them against
 

00:57:26.599 --> 00:57:30.009
why you need to immunize them against
this virus in addition new variants

00:57:30.009 --> 00:57:30.019
this virus in addition new variants
 

00:57:30.019 --> 00:57:31.989
this virus in addition new variants
continue to spread so this is an

00:57:31.989 --> 00:57:31.999
continue to spread so this is an
 

00:57:31.999 --> 00:57:35.319
continue to spread so this is an
evolving virus host relationship so over

00:57:35.319 --> 00:57:35.329
evolving virus host relationship so over
 

00:57:35.329 --> 00:57:37.449
evolving virus host relationship so over
the years you get new variants made even

00:57:37.449 --> 00:57:37.459
the years you get new variants made even
 

00:57:37.459 --> 00:57:39.880
the years you get new variants made even
in new dogs and who knows eventually

00:57:39.880 --> 00:57:39.890
in new dogs and who knows eventually
 

00:57:39.890 --> 00:57:40.990
in new dogs and who knows eventually
what will happen

00:57:40.990 --> 00:57:41.000
what will happen
 

00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:43.660
what will happen

what's in them in terms of influenza so

00:59:31.780 --> 00:59:31.790
what's in them in terms of influenza so
 

00:59:31.790 --> 00:59:34.150

this was first found in 1996 it wasn't

00:59:34.150 --> 00:59:34.160
this was first found in 1996 it wasn't
 

00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:36.700
this was first found in 1996 it wasn't
terribly pathogenic but it started to

00:59:36.700 --> 00:59:36.710
terribly pathogenic but it started to
 

00:59:36.710 --> 00:59:38.710
terribly pathogenic but it started to
spread too domesticated ducks and

00:59:38.710 --> 00:59:38.720
spread too domesticated ducks and
 

00:59:38.720 --> 00:59:42.430
spread too domesticated ducks and
chickens and infect herds and as it did

chickens and infect herds and as it did
 

00:59:42.440 --> 00:59:45.810
chickens and infect herds and as it did
so it became more and more virulent and

00:59:45.810 --> 00:59:45.820
so it became more and more virulent and
 

00:59:45.820 --> 00:59:48.820
so it became more and more virulent and
eventually infected people in Hong Kong

they found out that they had h5n1 so it
 

01:01:00.950 --> 01:01:04.809
they found out that they had h5n1 so it
has a pretty broad host range so this is

maybe if it does it will lose some of
 

01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:44.999
maybe if it does it will lose some of
its pathogenicity so I'm not sure all

01:02:44.999 --> 01:02:45.009
its pathogenicity so I'm not sure all
 

01:02:45.009 --> 01:02:46.499

the fear is warranted it's good to be
 

01:02:46.509 --> 01:02:49.469
the fear is warranted it's good to be
aware but I don't think it you should be

01:02:49.469 --> 01:02:49.479
aware but I don't think it you should be
 

01:02:49.479 --> 01:02:50.700

they're also in shellfish so you can get
 

01:04:38.950 --> 01:04:41.339
they're also in shellfish so you can get
them not only from marine mammals but

70s because we couldn't grow them we

01:04:58.859 --> 01:04:58.869
70s because we couldn't grow them we
 

01:04:58.869 --> 01:05:00.270
70s because we couldn't grow them we
couldn't detect them now we can grow

01:05:00.270 --> 01:05:00.280
couldn't detect them now we can grow
 

01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:03.030
couldn't detect them now we can grow
them quite well but in both of these

01:05:03.030 --> 01:05:03.040

cases recombinant DNA and pcr allows us

01:05:07.290 --> 01:05:07.300
cases recombinant DNA and pcr allows us
 

01:05:07.300 --> 01:05:09.560
cases recombinant DNA and pcr allows us
to identify a nucleic acid and

01:05:09.560 --> 01:05:09.570
to identify a nucleic acid and
 

01:05:09.570 --> 01:05:12.420

good example originally there were

01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:16.930
good example originally there were
 

01:05:16.930 --> 01:05:19.290
good example originally there were
people who didn't have hepatitis a they

01:05:19.290 --> 01:05:19.300
people who didn't have hepatitis a they
 

01:05:19.300 --> 01:05:22.800
people who didn't have hepatitis a they
didn't have hepatitis B so the blood

01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:22.810
didn't have hepatitis B so the blood
 

01:05:22.810 --> 01:05:24.960
didn't have hepatitis B so the blood
supply was screened for a third

01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:24.970
supply was screened for a third
 

01:05:24.970 --> 01:05:27.329
supply was screened for a third
potential hepatitis virus and this was

01:05:27.329 --> 01:05:27.339
potential hepatitis virus and this was
 

01:05:27.339 --> 01:05:30.780
potential hepatitis virus and this was
cloned from the serum of an infected

many years it just existed as a DNA
 

01:05:37.630 --> 01:05:42.210
many years it just existed as a DNA
sequence so in the end what do we do

01:05:42.210 --> 01:05:42.220
sequence so in the end what do we do
 

01:05:42.220 --> 01:05:44.880
sequence so in the end what do we do
about this this is a problem because it

01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:44.890
about this this is a problem because it
 

01:05:44.890 --> 01:05:47.460
about this this is a problem because it
costs a lot of money to detect these

01:05:47.460 --> 01:05:47.470
costs a lot of money to detect these
 

01:05:47.470 --> 01:05:50.250
costs a lot of money to detect these
emerging infections and prevent their

01:05:50.250 --> 01:05:50.260
emerging infections and prevent their
 

01:05:50.260 --> 01:05:51.660
emerging infections and prevent their
spread so we have to do a lot of

01:05:51.660 --> 01:05:51.670
spread so we have to do a lot of
 

01:05:51.670 --> 01:05:53.430
spread so we have to do a lot of
research which of course always costs

01:05:53.430 --> 01:05:53.440
research which of course always costs
 

01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:55.740
research which of course always costs

this is it and get to work on making
something that can help the infection

01:06:17.030 --> 01:06:17.040
something that can help the infection
 

01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:19.650
something that can help the infection
that's not easy but it can be done we

01:06:19.650 --> 01:06:19.660
that's not easy but it can be done we
 

01:06:19.660 --> 01:06:21.560
that's not easy but it can be done we
have the technology to do it

01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:21.570
have the technology to do it
 

01:06:21.570 --> 01:06:24.260
have the technology to do it
you have to have actions planned out

01:06:24.260 --> 01:06:24.270
you have to have actions planned out
 

01:06:24.270 --> 01:06:25.430
you have to have actions planned out
ahead of time what are you going to do

01:06:25.430 --> 01:06:25.440
ahead of time what are you going to do
 

01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:27.680
ahead of time what are you going to do
and there are now people whose work is

01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:27.690
and there are now people whose work is
 

01:06:27.690 --> 01:06:30.620
and there are now people whose work is
just to plan out actions in response to

01:06:30.620 --> 01:06:30.630
just to plan out actions in response to
 

01:06:30.630 --> 01:06:32.750
just to plan out actions in response to
certain kinds of infection whether they

01:06:32.750 --> 01:06:32.760
certain kinds of infection whether they
 

01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:37.730
certain kinds of infection whether they
be natural or bioterror induced vaccines

01:06:37.730 --> 01:06:37.740
be natural or bioterror induced vaccines
 

01:06:37.740 --> 01:06:40.330
be natural or bioterror induced vaccines
drug stockpiles and quarantines are also

01:06:40.330 --> 01:06:40.340
drug stockpiles and quarantines are also
 

01:06:40.340 --> 01:06:45.050
drug stockpiles and quarantines are also
being developed in particular in this

01:06:45.050 --> 01:06:45.060
being developed in particular in this
 

01:06:45.060 --> 01:06:46.850
being developed in particular in this
country we're doing this for small pox

01:06:46.850 --> 01:06:46.860
country we're doing this for small pox
 

01:06:46.860 --> 01:06:49.130
country we're doing this for small pox
which as you know is eradicated so if it

01:06:49.130 --> 01:06:49.140
which as you know is eradicated so if it
 

01:06:49.140 --> 01:06:50.630
which as you know is eradicated so if it
comes back it will be an emerging

01:06:50.630 --> 01:06:50.640
comes back it will be an emerging
 

01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:53.270
comes back it will be an emerging
infection most likely by a bioterrorist

01:06:53.270 --> 01:06:53.280
infection most likely by a bioterrorist
 

01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:55.850
infection most likely by a bioterrorist
action but we have plans about what to

01:06:55.850 --> 01:06:55.860
action but we have plans about what to
 

01:06:55.860 --> 01:06:58.690
action but we have plans about what to
do exactly in the event of an outbreak

01:06:58.690 --> 01:06:58.700
do exactly in the event of an outbreak
 

01:06:58.700 --> 01:07:01.340
do exactly in the event of an outbreak
medical centers have training programs

01:07:01.340 --> 01:07:01.350
medical centers have training programs
 

01:07:01.350 --> 01:07:03.140
medical centers have training programs
where they have simulated outbreaks and

01:07:03.140 --> 01:07:03.150
where they have simulated outbreaks and
 

01:07:03.150 --> 01:07:04.940
where they have simulated outbreaks and
they go through what you would do if

01:07:04.940 --> 01:07:04.950
they go through what you would do if
 

01:07:04.950 --> 01:07:07.070
they go through what you would do if
this patient presented with the symptoms

01:07:07.070 --> 01:07:07.080
this patient presented with the symptoms
 

01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:09.530
this patient presented with the symptoms
of smallpox at what point do we announce

01:07:09.530 --> 01:07:09.540
of smallpox at what point do we announce
 

01:07:09.540 --> 01:07:12.020
of smallpox at what point do we announce
it do we put out vaccines and drugs etc

01:07:12.020 --> 01:07:12.030
it do we put out vaccines and drugs etc
 

01:07:12.030 --> 01:07:14.510
it do we put out vaccines and drugs etc
this is all developed and probably not

01:07:14.510 --> 01:07:14.520
this is all developed and probably not
 

01:07:14.520 --> 01:07:16.700
this is all developed and probably not
many people know about it and you need

01:07:16.700 --> 01:07:16.710
many people know about it and you need
 

01:07:16.710 --> 01:07:18.560
many people know about it and you need
to have a lot of communication at all

01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:18.570
to have a lot of communication at all
 

01:07:18.570 --> 01:07:21.890
to have a lot of communication at all
levels in order to coordinate this so

01:07:21.890 --> 01:07:21.900
levels in order to coordinate this so
 

01:07:21.900 --> 01:07:23.650
levels in order to coordinate this so
this is all very expensive but

01:07:23.650 --> 01:07:23.660
this is all very expensive but
 

01:07:23.660 --> 01:07:26.450
this is all very expensive but
discovering emerging viruses has led to

01:07:26.450 --> 01:07:26.460
discovering emerging viruses has led to
 

01:07:26.460 --> 01:07:29.780
discovering emerging viruses has led to
this so not only to having interesting

01:07:29.780 --> 01:07:29.790
this so not only to having interesting
 

01:07:29.790 --> 01:07:31.940
this so not only to having interesting
new science and understanding how people

01:07:31.940 --> 01:07:31.950
new science and understanding how people
 

01:07:31.950 --> 01:07:33.730
new science and understanding how people
are getting sick in new ways but an

01:07:33.730 --> 01:07:33.740
are getting sick in new ways but an
 

01:07:33.740 --> 01:07:38.150
are getting sick in new ways but an
unprecedented level of communication in

01:07:38.150 --> 01:07:38.160
unprecedented level of communication in
 

01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:47.200
unprecedented level of communication in
order to control these infections

01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:47.210
