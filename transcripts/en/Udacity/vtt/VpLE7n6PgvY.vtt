00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
I wish that more people will realize
that if they had an app idea that they

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.390
could go and actually build it
themselves.

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.590
That's why we created the Android Basics
Nanodegree.  It's a learning path to

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.930
take someone from no coding experience,
to building a whole portfolio of basic Android apps.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.359
I'm fairly certain that
anyone can learn program for Android.

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.619
I think everyone comes across that that
moment when they're sitting around with

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.109
an app and they're like 
"oh man I wish it did this".

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.570
the difference is kind of acting on it.
It was my opportunity to no longer have

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.510
to wish an app existed.
I can just make it myself.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.579
The biggest reason why I hadn't done it
before was it seemed like such a

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.250
daunting task to code.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.980
I would say: I wish about maybe 14 years
ago, someone would have told me that.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.980
It's something that anyone can actually learn.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.420
Begin your journey today by taking the

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.670
first step to becoming an Android
developer.
