00:00:12.659 --> 00:00:14.610
This is the Hogeweyk.

00:00:14.984 --> 00:00:19.365
It's a neighborhood in a small town
very near Amsterdam, in the Netherlands.

00:00:19.881 --> 00:00:23.350
There are 27 houses
for six, seven people each.

00:00:23.821 --> 00:00:28.341
There's a small mall with a restaurant,
a pub, a supermarket, a club room.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.225
There are streets, alleys,
there's a theater.

00:00:34.434 --> 00:00:36.434
It actually is a nursing home.

00:00:37.093 --> 00:00:42.727
A nursing home for people
that live with an advanced dementia

00:00:42.751 --> 00:00:46.210
and that need 24-7 care and support.

00:00:47.234 --> 00:00:50.497
Dementia is a terrible disease,

00:00:50.521 --> 00:00:53.739
and we still don't have any cure for it.

00:00:54.211 --> 00:00:57.838
It's getting to be
a major problem in the world,

00:00:57.862 --> 00:00:59.710
for the people, for the politicians,

00:00:59.734 --> 00:01:02.705
for the world -- it's getting
to be a big problem.

00:01:03.228 --> 00:01:06.473
We see that we have waiting lists
in the nursing homes.

00:01:07.093 --> 00:01:10.893
Most people that come to the nursing homes
with dementia are women.

00:01:11.855 --> 00:01:16.815
And that's also because women
are used to taking care of people,

00:01:16.839 --> 00:01:20.692
so they can manage to take care
of their husband with dementia,

00:01:20.716 --> 00:01:25.124
but the other way around
is not so easy for the gentlemen.

00:01:26.629 --> 00:01:30.962
Dementia is a disease
that affects the brain.

00:01:30.986 --> 00:01:33.128
The brain is confused.

00:01:33.923 --> 00:01:36.684
People don't know anymore
what the time is,

00:01:36.708 --> 00:01:39.446
what's going on, who people are.

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:40.942
They're very confused.

00:01:40.966 --> 00:01:43.180
And because of that confusion,

00:01:43.204 --> 00:01:49.249
they get to be anxious,
depressed, aggressive.

00:01:50.728 --> 00:01:53.109
This is a traditional nursing home.

00:01:53.133 --> 00:01:55.188
I worked there in 1992.

00:01:55.641 --> 00:01:57.148
I was a care manager.

00:01:57.687 --> 00:02:00.703
And we often spoke together about the fact

00:02:00.727 --> 00:02:05.728
that what we were doing there
was not what we wanted for our parents,

00:02:05.752 --> 00:02:09.060
for our friends, for ourselves.

00:02:09.815 --> 00:02:11.600
And one day, we said,

00:02:11.624 --> 00:02:14.378
"When we keep on saying this,
nothing is going to change.

00:02:14.402 --> 00:02:15.775
We are in charge here.

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:18.295
We should do something about this,

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:21.683
so that we do want
to have our parents here."

00:02:22.773 --> 00:02:25.781
We talked about that,
and what we saw every day

00:02:25.805 --> 00:02:29.498
was that the people
that lived in our nursing home

00:02:29.522 --> 00:02:31.887
were confused about their environment,

00:02:31.911 --> 00:02:35.458
because what they saw
was a hospital-like environment,

00:02:35.482 --> 00:02:39.593
with doctors and nurses
and paramedics in uniform,

00:02:39.617 --> 00:02:41.284
and they lived on a ward.

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:44.903
And they didn't understand
why they lived there.

00:02:44.927 --> 00:02:48.236
And they looked for the place to get away.

00:02:48.617 --> 00:02:53.554
They looked and hoped to find
the door to go home again.

00:02:54.022 --> 00:02:57.847
And we said what we are doing
in this situation

00:02:57.871 --> 00:03:02.910
is offering these people
that already have a confused brain

00:03:02.934 --> 00:03:04.220
some more confusion.

00:03:04.244 --> 00:03:07.778
We were adding confusion to confusion.

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.631
And that was not what these people needed.

00:03:11.084 --> 00:03:13.846
These people wanted to have a life,

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.434
and the help, our help,
to deal with that dementia.

00:03:17.957 --> 00:03:22.689
These people wanted to live
in a normal house,

00:03:22.713 --> 00:03:23.863
not in a ward.

00:03:24.482 --> 00:03:27.307
They wanted to have a normal household,

00:03:27.331 --> 00:03:32.029
where they would smell their dinner
on the stove in the kitchen.

00:03:32.966 --> 00:03:37.228
Or be free to go to the kitchen
and grab something to eat or drink.

00:03:37.611 --> 00:03:39.841
That's what these people needed.

00:03:39.865 --> 00:03:42.364
And that's what we should
organize for them.

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:47.990
And we said we should
organize this like at home,

00:03:48.014 --> 00:03:52.966
so they wouldn't live with a group
of 15 or 20 or 30, like in a ward.

00:03:53.434 --> 00:03:57.648
No, a small group of people,
six or seven, family-like.

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:00.942
Like living with friends.

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:05.788
And we should find a way to select people

00:04:05.812 --> 00:04:08.566
based on their ideas about life

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.690
so that they did have
a good chance to become friends,

00:04:11.714 --> 00:04:13.282
when they lived together.

00:04:14.225 --> 00:04:18.385
And we interviewed
all the families of the residents

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:22.102
about "what is important for your father,"
"what's important for your mother,"

00:04:22.126 --> 00:04:24.875
"what is their life like,"
"what do they want."

00:04:24.899 --> 00:04:29.144
And we found seven groups,
and we call them lifestyle groups.

00:04:29.709 --> 00:04:33.370
And for instance,
we found this formal lifestyle.

00:04:33.851 --> 00:04:35.077
In this lifestyle,

00:04:35.101 --> 00:04:38.522
people have a more formal way
of interacting with each other,

00:04:38.546 --> 00:04:39.839
a distant way.

00:04:39.863 --> 00:04:42.109
Their daily rhythm
starts later in the day,

00:04:42.133 --> 00:04:43.855
ends later in the day.

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:46.905
Classical music is more heard
in this lifestyle group

00:04:46.929 --> 00:04:48.632
than in other lifestyle groups.

00:04:48.656 --> 00:04:50.140
And their menu,

00:04:50.164 --> 00:04:53.943
well, is more French cuisine
than traditional Dutch.

00:04:53.967 --> 00:04:55.559
(Laughter)

00:04:55.583 --> 00:04:59.194
In contrary to the craftsman lifestyle.

00:04:59.218 --> 00:05:01.361
That's a very traditional lifestyle,

00:05:01.385 --> 00:05:03.955
and they get up early
in the morning, go to bed early,

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:07.981
because they have worked hard
their whole life, mostly with their hands,

00:05:08.005 --> 00:05:12.608
very often had a very small
family business, a small farm, a shop,

00:05:12.632 --> 00:05:16.767
or like Mr. B, he was a farmhand.

00:05:17.466 --> 00:05:20.966
And he told me that he would go
to his work every morning

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:23.194
with a paper bag with his lunch

00:05:24.014 --> 00:05:25.504
and one cigar.

00:05:26.824 --> 00:05:30.887
That one cigar was the only luxury
he could afford for himself.

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:34.553
And after lunch,
he would have that one cigar.

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.788
And until the day he died in the Hogeweyk,

00:05:38.812 --> 00:05:44.724
he was in this little shed, every day,
after lunch, to smoke his cigar.

00:05:47.201 --> 00:05:48.387
This is my mother.

00:05:48.411 --> 00:05:50.022
She's of the cultural lifestyle,

00:05:50.046 --> 00:05:52.512
she's been living
in the Hogeweyk six weeks now.

00:05:53.236 --> 00:05:58.476
And that lifestyle is about traveling,
meeting other people, other cultures,

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.501
interest in arts and music.

00:06:02.072 --> 00:06:03.805
There are more lifestyles.

00:06:04.818 --> 00:06:08.551
But that's what we talked about,
and that's what we did.

00:06:09.766 --> 00:06:14.617
But that's not life in a house
with a group of people,

00:06:14.641 --> 00:06:18.019
like-minded people, your own life,
your own household.

00:06:18.434 --> 00:06:19.763
There's more in life,

00:06:19.787 --> 00:06:23.091
everybody wants fun in life
and a meaningful life.

00:06:23.688 --> 00:06:25.109
We are social animals --

00:06:25.133 --> 00:06:27.402
we need a social life.

00:06:27.817 --> 00:06:29.617
And that's what we started.

00:06:30.817 --> 00:06:34.293
We want to go out of our house
and do some shopping,

00:06:34.317 --> 00:06:35.784
and meet other people.

00:06:36.698 --> 00:06:40.438
Or go to the pub,
have a beer with friends.

00:06:40.462 --> 00:06:45.444
Or like Mr. W -- he likes
to go out every day,

00:06:45.468 --> 00:06:48.084
see if there are nice ladies around.

00:06:48.108 --> 00:06:50.096
(Laughter)

00:06:50.465 --> 00:06:52.020
And he's very courteous to them,

00:06:52.044 --> 00:06:54.545
and he hopes for smiles and he gets them.

00:06:54.863 --> 00:06:57.196
And he dances with them in the pub.

00:06:58.014 --> 00:06:59.530
It's a feast every day.

00:06:59.554 --> 00:07:02.768
There are people that would
rather go to the restaurant,

00:07:02.792 --> 00:07:04.466
have a wine with friends,

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:08.156
or lunch or dinner with friends
and celebrate life.

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:10.966
And my mother,
she takes a walk in the park,

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:12.673
and sits on a bench in the sun,

00:07:12.697 --> 00:07:15.823
hoping that a passerby will come
and sit next to her

00:07:15.847 --> 00:07:18.410
and have a conversation about life

00:07:18.434 --> 00:07:21.669
or about the ducks in the pond.

00:07:22.355 --> 00:07:24.616
That social life is important.

00:07:24.998 --> 00:07:29.574
It means that you're part
of society, that you belong.

00:07:29.974 --> 00:07:32.041
And that's what we people need.

00:07:33.013 --> 00:07:36.561
Even if you're living
with advanced dementia.

00:07:37.482 --> 00:07:40.347
This is what I see from my office window.

00:07:40.371 --> 00:07:44.580
And one day, I saw a lady
coming from one side,

00:07:44.604 --> 00:07:48.223
and the other lady from the other side,
and they met at the corner.

00:07:48.247 --> 00:07:50.595
And I knew both ladies very well.

00:07:50.929 --> 00:07:54.281
I often saw them walking around outside.

00:07:54.618 --> 00:07:58.999
And now and then, I tried
to have a conversation with them,

00:07:59.023 --> 00:08:01.776
but their conversation was ...

00:08:02.586 --> 00:08:05.072
rather hard to understand.

00:08:05.839 --> 00:08:09.498
But I saw them meeting,
and I saw them talking,

00:08:09.522 --> 00:08:11.402
and I saw them gesturing.

00:08:11.426 --> 00:08:13.159
And they had fun together.

00:08:13.554 --> 00:08:16.632
And then they said goodbye,
and each went their own way.

00:08:17.331 --> 00:08:20.569
And that's what you want in life,
meeting other people

00:08:20.593 --> 00:08:22.640
and being part of society.

00:08:23.093 --> 00:08:25.227
And that's what I saw happening.

00:08:26.148 --> 00:08:28.155
The Hogeweyk has become a place

00:08:28.179 --> 00:08:31.861
where people with very advanced
dementia can live,

00:08:31.885 --> 00:08:33.821
have freedom and safety,

00:08:33.845 --> 00:08:38.329
because the professionals working there
and the volunteers working there

00:08:38.353 --> 00:08:40.575
know how to deal with dementia.

00:08:41.093 --> 00:08:44.426
And the professionals know
how to do their professional work

00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:49.482
in a way that it fits in a natural way
in the life of our residents.

00:08:50.826 --> 00:08:55.506
And that means that the management
has to provide everything

00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:57.864
those people need to do their work.

00:08:58.866 --> 00:09:02.710
It needs a management
that dares to do this.

00:09:02.734 --> 00:09:05.871
To do things differently
than we always have done

00:09:05.895 --> 00:09:08.028
in a traditional nursing home.

00:09:10.989 --> 00:09:12.893
We see that it works.

00:09:14.006 --> 00:09:17.172
We think this can be done everywhere,

00:09:17.196 --> 00:09:19.396
because this is not for the rich.

00:09:19.863 --> 00:09:24.212
We've been doing this with the same budget

00:09:24.236 --> 00:09:28.315
as any traditional nursing home
has in our country.

00:09:28.339 --> 00:09:31.116
We work only with the state budget.

00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:39.092
(Applause)

00:09:40.226 --> 00:09:43.798
Because it has to do
with thinking different,

00:09:43.822 --> 00:09:46.552
and looking at the person in front of you

00:09:46.576 --> 00:09:50.257
and looking at what
does this person need now.

00:09:51.352 --> 00:09:54.592
And it's about a smile,
it's about thinking different,

00:09:54.616 --> 00:09:58.663
it's about how you act,
and that costs nothing.

00:09:59.823 --> 00:10:03.490
And there's something else:
it's about making choices.

00:10:03.903 --> 00:10:07.636
It's about making choices
what you spend your money on.

00:10:08.855 --> 00:10:10.131
I always say,

00:10:11.323 --> 00:10:16.069
"Red curtains are
as expensive as gray ones."

00:10:16.093 --> 00:10:17.470
(Laughter)

00:10:17.494 --> 00:10:20.017
It's possible, everywhere.

00:10:21.263 --> 00:10:22.422
Thank you.

00:10:22.446 --> 00:10:27.077
(Applause)
