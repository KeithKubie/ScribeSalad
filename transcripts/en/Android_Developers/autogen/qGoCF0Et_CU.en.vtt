00:00:00.557 --> 00:00:02.390
 Publish a new app for every developer 

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:04.100
 Or post a new version of the app 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:05.552
 It’s an exciting time 

00:00:05.552 --> 00:00:07.300
 This is a very crucial moment 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.170
 Pay attention to all the details 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.680
 Ensure that users are very satisfied with your app 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.240
 To make this process easier 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.400
 We are promoting a new way to publish apps 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.670
 Google Developer Console 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.010
 First create a new app list 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:23.750
 Click to create the app 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.400
 You can get the new management release page in the left navigation bar. 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.900
 Then you go to this page 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.500
 On this page you can see the steps to publish your app. 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.587
 Product testing and alpha trajectory 

00:00:33.587 --> 00:00:36.170
 Of course, we recommend testing all the apps. 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.050
 This way you can test new features better before publishing. 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.620
 If this is the first time you posted the page is blank 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.660
 You need to choose a path to publish 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.750
 For example, choose a management product 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.670
 Then the new product is released 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.580
 Click Upload APK and then pop up as usual 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.560
 Then select the file you want to upload. 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.240
 After uploading the APK 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.214
 There will be additional items in the APK 

00:00:59.214 --> 00:01:02.890
 The name of the post is the name of the APK you uploaded. 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.459
 After the app is updated 

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:08.095
 Don't forget to fill out the new features posted. 

00:01:08.095 --> 00:01:10.040
 You have to give it to your app list. 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.570
 All supported languages 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.040
 Localization 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.400
 The best thing about managing the release process is 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.734
 No matter when you can save the draft release data 

00:01:19.734 --> 00:01:21.650
 Then go get the rest of the list 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.650
 After a while, you will finish the data you just saved. 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.690
 If you want to go back to your saved state 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.670
 Click Manage to publish the management product and click Continue. 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.420
 Once it can be released 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:33.878
 You click to check 

00:01:33.878 --> 00:01:36.050
 Then you will see a summary 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:37.820
 If no validation error occurs 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.010
 Click OK to go online and you can post your app. 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.619
 Then you will return to the release page. 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.160
 If you want to update an existing app process, it will be a bit different. 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.730
 Because the selection method clicks on the new version 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.110
 Will create a new draft as before 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.840
 But this draft is based on the previous release 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.360
 Previously released APK 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.330
 All will enter the disabled APK list 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.640
 Of course, if you want, you can choose to keep 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:02.960
 Click the hold button 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.870
 You can keep the old APK 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.530
 Because maybe the old APK is useful for previous API versions. 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.140
 At this stage, how many APKs do you want to add? 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.750
 Every time you upload you will see a basic popup page 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.550
 There is information about the APK inside. 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.150
 Here you can attach extension files 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.460
 After finishing the new APK as before 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.199
 You can edit the version name and new features 

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:27.740
 After all the information is filled out 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.077
 Can check 

00:02:30.077 --> 00:02:31.910
 If you want to track the product 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.130
 You can summarize the page 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:35.810
 Directly change the online ratio 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.520
 We recommend running your app step by step. 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.580
 I have done this recently. 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.740
 Especially important app version 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.540
 So you can do it all before your app is uploaded. 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.360
 Found a problem to solve the problem 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.330
 Can avoid negative reviews and low scores 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.010
 In the Google Developer Help Center 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.759
 You can learn more about the content of the stage. 

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:57.050
 As long as you are ready, you can adjust the on-line ratio 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.150
 Click update to go online 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.070
 Then change the value 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.860
 If you don't know what percentage to choose 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.630
 We will have suggestions 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.440
 If you have questions about the ongoing phase 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.030
 It’s very easy to stop it now. 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.450
 Click the Stop online button and confirm 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:15.756
 pay attention 

00:03:15.756 --> 00:03:17.470
 Stop phase online 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.521
 New users can't download new versions. 

00:03:19.521 --> 00:03:22.760
 But users who have made the wrong update will still have the wrong version. 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.630
 So please remind me as soon as possible 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.760
 Fix it and create another version later 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.220
 Upload release 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.037
 Just stop the wrong version. 

00:03:34.037 --> 00:03:36.620
 Of course, if you have not created a new version, you can fix it. 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.340
 Maybe you fixed it on your own server. 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.680
 You can choose to continue online at any time. 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.300
 Another feature we released 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.730
 Can help you better control the release of new products. 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.830
 Workpiece library 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:51.320
 Includes APK extension file 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:52.520
 And other app files 

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.370
 If you go to the managed release of the artifact library 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.850
 You can see the update in the app artifact. 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:03.140
 You can see all the uploaded files related to the app you posted. 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.030
 With this new management release feature 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.120
 Managing your app now can be smoother 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.230
 More transparent and easier to track 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:12.075
 It allows you to manage your app more confidently
