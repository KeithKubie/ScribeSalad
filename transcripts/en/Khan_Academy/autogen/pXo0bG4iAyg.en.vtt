00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.520
 Our lesson today is about 

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.245
 Engineering sequences. 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.720
 There are many advanced videos on this subject, 

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.330
 But this video is a good introduction to engineering sequences 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.380
 It explains the meaning 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.450
 This expression. 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:22.200
 The first question is what is the meaning of succession? 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.330
 Cascading is 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.420
 A set of consecutive numbers. 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.730
 For example, you have these numbers, which are not geometric series, 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.570
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.120
 These are consecutive numbers. 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.680
 Not an engineering sequence, but only a sequence. 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.085
 Cascading geometry is a special type of successive numbers 

00:00:45.085 --> 00:00:52.370
 Or a special type of numerical sequences, where each number is in 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.180
 Is the sum of a constant number multiplied by the number that has been accepted. 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.080
 for example, 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:03.430
 The first number in the sequence is 2, and you hit number 2 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.290
 In Issue 3 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.420
 The output is 6. 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.590
 Then multiply the number 6 in, the output is 18, 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.230
 Then multiply the number 18 by 3, you get number 54, 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.280
 And so on. 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.090
 If you want to continue the sequence, you must always multiply the number by 3. 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.860
 If, you have at first 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.970
 The first limit. 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.840
 Use the a1 symbol for the first limit in this sequence. 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.170
 Each time you hit the limit in the same number, 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.140
 That number is usually called "foundation". 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.420
 In this example, a1 is equal to 2, 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.670
 The basis is 3. 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.680
 For example, if you have 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.310
 Engineering sequence, 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:59.220
 And a1 is equal to 90 and the base equals 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.160
 Negative 3/1. 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.570
 This means that the first limit of the sequence equals 90, 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.770
 The second image is a negative 3/1 in 90. 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:10.759
 whats the result? 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.160
 A negative result of 3/1 in 90 is negative. 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.340
 Check the result, 3/1 hit 90 equals 30 and add the negative sign. 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.000
 The third limit is a negative result of 3/1 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.930
 In negative 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.790
 And equal to 10. 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.790
 My negative sign cancels each other so that the answer is positive 10. 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.650
 The fourth limit is 10 minus 1/3 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.250
 Is equal to 3/10 negative. 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.500
 The fifth image will be a negative 3/10 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.950
 In negative 3/1 and equal to 9/10 positive. 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.950
 You can continue to calculate the cascading limits in this way. 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.040
 That is the meaning 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.360
 Cascading Engineering. 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.880
 But you have to distinguish between two similar terms 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.280
 In terms of words used 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.940
 In both. 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:59.980
 This name is consecutive, 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.860
 It is a set of sequential numbers. 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.330
 You have 2 here then 6, then 18. Or 90, then minus 30, then 10, 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.030
 Then negative 3/10 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.150
 Then positive 9/10. 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.350
 These are called sequences, 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.725
 But you can see the word series, 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:31.180
 Or geometric sequences. 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.360
 The word series is usually used to refer to 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.410
 Total cascading limits. 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.850
 For example, these geometrical sequences. 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:49.070
 The geometric series of this sequence are 90 plus minus 30, plus 10 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:53.500
 Plus negative 3/10, plus 9/10. 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.660
 If, serialized 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.910
 The sum of the cascading limits. 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.470
 This is just an illustration of my successive and sequential terms 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.690
 So you can tell them apart. 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.550
 Now go back to the engineering sequences, 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.240
 We try to resolve the issue around it. 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:18.959
 Ahmed wants to practice jumping the bungee jumping with a rubber rope 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.599
 From a bridge soaked above the water. 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:35.690
 In the first jump, the rubber cord extends 120 feet (symbol of the foot unit with the symbol ft). 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.750
 If, at the first limit a1 is the first jump, 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.260
 The cord extends 120 feet. 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:51.865
 To draw a table and write in the first column "jump", in the second column "stretch" ie 

00:04:51.865 --> 00:04:56.320
 The distance the cord extends. 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.440
 In the first jump, stretch the rope 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.860
 Distance is 120 feet. 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.420
 After that, when the rope recumbent it expands by 60% 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:09.910
 From the first jump, and each time the rope is rebound 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.230
 60% stretch of the previous jump. 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:17.280
 If so, the basis for each limit in this sequence 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.400
 Equals 60% of the limit that precedes it, 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.680
 Or 0.6 hit the previous limit. 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.400
 For example, in the second jump, the amount of expansion equals 60% of the first jump 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.220
 Or 0.6 multiplied by 120 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.960
 It is equal to 72. 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.210
 Then in the third jump, the cord expands by 0.6 of 72 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:40.470
 Or 0.6 multiply this amount. 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:49.900
 0.6 hit 0.6 hit 120. 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:53.410
 Notice in the fourth jump, to calculate the stretch you hit 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:06:03.770
 0.6 at 0.6 in 0.6 at 120. 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:07.810
 60% of this jump. If, every time you calculate 60% of the 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:09.030
 Previous jump. 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:12.060
 If you want to write an equation for this, 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:15.690
 Based on the explanation here. 

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:25.960
 The expansion at the general limit (denoted by the symbol n) equals 

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:39.900
 0.6 hit 120 

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:40.400
 S n minus 1. 

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.400
 This can also be written. 

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:50.620
 The general limit is 120 

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:59.500
 Hit 0.6, S minus 1. 

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:00.540
 How did you get this equation? 

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:04.610
 The amount of expansion in the first jump was 120 feet. 

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:09.880
 When you subtract the value of n by 1, 1 minus 1 equals 0. 

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:11.995
 If so, 0.6 s 

00:07:11.995 --> 00:07:13.360
 Equals 1. 

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.920
 This is the amount of expansion in the first jump. 

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:20.360
 Then in the second jump, you should subtract 2 from 1 

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.050
 Equal to 1, AS1, 

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:23.900
 Note that there is one 0.6 at the second jump. 

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:27.620
 If, exponent n is minus 1, because when the value of n is equal to 2, there is 

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:31.560
 0.6 one, and when the value of n is equal to 3, repeated 0.6 times, 0.6 multiplied 

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:32.040
 0.6 

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:35.120
 When n is equal to 4, you have 0.6 s3. 

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:39.510
 So, whatever the value of n, the equation is 0.6 s n minus 1, 

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:43.940
 Hit 120. 

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:47.340
 The next question is how much stretch cord 

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:54.390
 When the twelfth tremor? 

00:07:54.390 --> 00:08:00.790
 Use the calculator now. 

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:04.600
 It is best to use the term "rebound" 

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.550
 Instead of jumping, 

00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:11.150
 Because the question about apostasy. 

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:13.190
 You can replace the first jump by default. 

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:17.150
 This is not the wrong way, but the rebound is closer to 

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:18.340
 The significance of the question. 

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:23.300
 If, therefore, the first expansion corresponds to the number 0, 

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:28.050
 The first column is called a tremor. 

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:32.049
 After bounce # 0, you have the number 1, 

00:08:32.049 --> 00:08:33.960
 Then number 2, 

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:35.950
 Then 3. 

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:38.960
 This makes the equation simpler. 

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:48.150
 They extend at the general limit of the recession 

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:57.180
 Equals 0.6 s, multiplied by 120. 

00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:00.740
 Check the equation, at 0, 

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:03.660
 0.6 s 0, equals 1 multiplied by 120. 

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:09.210
 At the first bounce, 0.6 s 1. Note that there is one 0.6 at the first shock. 

00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:11.860
 0.6 Multiply the previous expansion. 

00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:22.940
 What about the twelfth tremor? 

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:25.500
 You have to compensate n 

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:29.240
 Number 12 in the equation. 

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:30.930
 Use the calculator. 

00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:41.790
 120 hit 0.6 s 12 

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:57.930
 Equals 0.26 feet. 

00:09:57.930 --> 00:09:59.990
 This means that after the twelfth tremor, 

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:00.980
 Ahmed will not move much. 

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:04.450
 Where it will move 3 inches after the twelfth hit. 

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:13.750
 Always make sure that the value is n 

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:15.740
 Proportional to the result you want to get. 

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:19.080
 Notice in this question, when you used the concept of the jump, 

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:20.740
 At the first jump, 

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:23.680
 You had to write the formula 0.6 s n minus 1. 

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:27.370
 But when you used the concept of scratching, 

00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:29.070
 This becomes the number 0 echo. 

00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:31.960
 This is logical, to be 0.6 s0. 

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:35.000
 This is the first echo, if you have 0.6 

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.500
 S1. 

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:39.250
 At the second echo, 0.6 s 2. 

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:42.190
 And so it became 

00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:44.730
 The equation is simpler.
