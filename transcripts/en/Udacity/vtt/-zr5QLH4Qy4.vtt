00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.200
Okay.

00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.760
So before Dan gets carried away
with databases,

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.198
let's look at what happens

00:00:05.198 --> 00:00:07.606
when you use an intent
to transition between activities.

00:00:07.766 --> 00:00:09.114
Within Sunshine,

00:00:09.114 --> 00:00:13.387
if you tap on a list in the main activity
it opens up the detail activity.

00:00:16.962 --> 00:00:19.230
But the main activity
remains on the backstack,

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.080
ready to reappear as soon
as you hit Back.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.670
Now, in that example,
both activities are within the same app.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.794
But as we learned in lesson three,
you can also watch the browser

00:00:28.794 --> 00:00:30.507
or Maps app from Sunshine.

00:00:35.281 --> 00:00:37.451
Or for that matter,
the user can hit Home.

00:00:41.065 --> 00:00:44.521
And launch apps from there,
or they can use the Recent key

00:00:44.521 --> 00:00:46.800
or switch to another app
using Notifications.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.630
All of these options mean you can end up
with a lot of apps on your backstack.

00:00:57.947 --> 00:01:02.440
Now, keep in mind that our resources
on devices are extremely limited.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.230
So it's not a good idea to have dozens
of apps sitting idle in the background.

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.880
Android solves this for us,

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.320
so you don't have to use
those awful task killer apps.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.010
So, how does it do that?

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.630
Well, it kills low priority applications
that you haven't used in a while.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.500
We'll go into detail on exactly how
it figures out which app needs to die

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.630
in lesson six.

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.040
But for now, it's important to realize

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.750
that your app isn't in control
of its own destiny.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.732
It can be killed at any time.

00:01:32.089 --> 00:01:34.055
So you need to know
how to deal with that.

00:01:34.055 --> 00:01:36.916
And that means understanding
the lifecycle of an activity

00:01:36.916 --> 00:01:40.100
and the signals we get from the framework
to indicate its progress

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.299
through the lifetime.
