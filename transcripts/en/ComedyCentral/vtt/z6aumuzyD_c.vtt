00:00:05.004 --> 00:00:07.006
Okay, welcome back.

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:09.409
So, Ice Cube and Common

00:00:09.442 --> 00:00:10.676
are in the new<i> Barbershop</i> movie

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:12.979
and I wanted to talk to them
and I was thinking

00:00:13.012 --> 00:00:15.681
hmm, where should we
do the interview?

00:00:15.714 --> 00:00:17.183
Uh, I know-- a malt shop.

00:00:17.216 --> 00:00:19.152
No.

00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:21.320
Maybe a tool and die shop?
Mm...

00:00:21.353 --> 00:00:24.023
And then it hit me--
(scoffs) A coffee shop.

00:00:24.056 --> 00:00:25.792
Well, uh, we couldn't find one,

00:00:25.825 --> 00:00:28.795
so we settled for a barbershop.
And I thought we'd have

00:00:28.828 --> 00:00:30.496
a real conversation about race

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:32.832
and some of the issues
in the community.

00:00:32.865 --> 00:00:34.801
♪ ♪

00:00:36.702 --> 00:00:39.605
Hey, everybody. I'm here
at Little Tony &amp; Igor Be Good

00:00:39.638 --> 00:00:42.975
barbershop with Ice Cube and
Common, stars of the new movie,

00:00:43.008 --> 00:00:46.345
uh,<i> Barbershop.</i> Is it
<i> Barbershop 8?</i> Which one is it?

00:00:46.378 --> 00:00:48.347
It's<i> Barbershop: The Next Cut.</i>

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.116
Full disclosure:
we're not technically

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:52.385
in a black barbershop.
I don't know what the hours are

00:00:52.418 --> 00:00:54.053
at black barbershops.
You take your chances

00:00:54.086 --> 00:00:56.456
when you go there,
that's all I'm saying.

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.391
Well, since we're in a
barbershop, let's talk about

00:00:58.424 --> 00:01:00.860
the significance of the place.
Why do you think the barbershop

00:01:00.893 --> 00:01:02.528
means so much
in the black community?

00:01:02.561 --> 00:01:05.498
It's our only country club.
It's the only place you can go

00:01:05.531 --> 00:01:08.768
and kind of get that fellowship
and that camaraderie.

00:01:08.801 --> 00:01:10.403
People is gonna
give it to you raw.

00:01:10.436 --> 00:01:12.705
Like, that's what it is.
Like, it's authentic

00:01:12.738 --> 00:01:13.940
in the barbershop.

00:01:13.973 --> 00:01:15.241
-It's authentic, right?
-Yeah.

00:01:17.076 --> 00:01:19.112
WILMORE: Now, race is talked
about a lot in barbershops.

00:01:19.145 --> 00:01:21.214
Like, you... Where do you think
we are, let's say,

00:01:21.247 --> 00:01:23.449
on the (bleep)
with attitude scale?

00:01:23.482 --> 00:01:26.152
Like, should (bleep)
still have a lot of attitude?

00:01:26.185 --> 00:01:27.920
Middle attitude? Just...

00:01:27.953 --> 00:01:30.957
I mean, I think they should have
the same amount of attitude,

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.760
because the days on the calendar
change but, you know,

00:01:34.793 --> 00:01:37.230
our situation
is not changing, you know,

00:01:37.263 --> 00:01:39.332
as a-as a people
on a whole lot of levels.

00:01:39.365 --> 00:01:41.601
Why do you think that is?
What's going on with that?

00:01:41.634 --> 00:01:43.336
I mean, people thought
when Obama came in,

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:46.405
-you know, racism was over.
-Yeah, yeah. Well, I think

00:01:46.438 --> 00:01:48.541
you know, um,
somehow we had a hope

00:01:48.574 --> 00:01:50.676
that it was going to just stop.
And, I mean,

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:53.246
he obviously did every...
is doing everything he can,

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:56.816
but it still can't change
the minds of deep-rooted racism

00:01:56.849 --> 00:02:00.419
that's been in the system for so
long and people, they feel that.

00:02:00.452 --> 00:02:02.555
Though you have...
you have Obamas,

00:02:02.588 --> 00:02:05.458
you have the-the Jay Zs
and Beyoncés--

00:02:05.491 --> 00:02:07.894
you know, successful people,
you know,

00:02:07.927 --> 00:02:10.296
There's still people
that we're connected to

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:13.266
-that still have issues,
you -know? So... -Right.

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:14.800
Just because you're successful,
you shouldn't

00:02:14.833 --> 00:02:16.636
-forget about that those
issues exist. -Yeah, -exact...

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:18.671
And-and look
what we're successful in--

00:02:18.704 --> 00:02:21.007
-you know, sports
and entertainment. -Right.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.243
You know, it's like, uh,
Chris Rock said, you know, uh,

00:02:24.276 --> 00:02:27.880
"You know, I'm-I'm a big-time,
worldwide comedian,

00:02:27.913 --> 00:02:30.283
"and the guy that lives
next door to me

00:02:30.316 --> 00:02:32.552
"is a white dentist.
Why couldn't I just be a dentist

00:02:32.585 --> 00:02:34.620
"and make it to this
neighborhood? I had to be

00:02:34.653 --> 00:02:36.889
a big-time celebrity to get
here, and the guy next door..."

00:02:36.922 --> 00:02:39.559
But seriously, Cube, you don't
want to go to a black dentist,

00:02:39.592 --> 00:02:41.360
let's be honest.

00:02:41.393 --> 00:02:43.629
-Of course you do.
-Yeah, I do.

00:02:43.662 --> 00:02:45.097
-But I'm-but I'm saying...
-Let's be honest.

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.432
-But...
-Let's be clear about this.

00:02:46.465 --> 00:02:47.700
Oh, no.

00:02:48.968 --> 00:02:50.803
I want to talk about the black
community itself

00:02:50.836 --> 00:02:53.306
and some of the issues
that are facing...

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:55.408
Especially in the last few
years, some have come up

00:02:55.441 --> 00:02:58.644
more than others. And, um,
I see it... A lot of people

00:02:58.677 --> 00:03:01.614
pit gang violence, what's
happening in the community,

00:03:01.647 --> 00:03:04.016
-versus police violence,
you know? -Yeah.

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:06.919
And people kind of get it...
They make this comparison

00:03:06.952 --> 00:03:08.854
-all the time, you know?
-Yeah. -Yeah.

00:03:08.887 --> 00:03:11.557
Um, why do you think
people feel the need to do that?

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.461
Um, you know, I-I think
it's really kind of ridiculous

00:03:15.494 --> 00:03:17.930
when you compare
apples and oranges like that.

00:03:17.963 --> 00:03:21.200
Citizen on citizen crime
is totally different

00:03:21.233 --> 00:03:23.236
than government
on citizen crime.

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:25.304
By the way, that's a criminal's
job-- is to ma...

00:03:25.337 --> 00:03:27.206
is to commit crime.
That's his job.

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.442
-Yeah, without a doubt. -They're
just showing up for work.

00:03:29.475 --> 00:03:31.611
-Without a doubt.
-Right?

00:03:31.644 --> 00:03:33.980
-Police are supposed to protect
and serve. -Protect and serve.

00:03:34.013 --> 00:03:36.816
You guys are not doing your job.
The criminal's doing his job.

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:38.284
-Right?
-Yeah. -Yeah. Yeah, man.

00:03:38.317 --> 00:03:40.152
It was once said,
"Serve, protect

00:03:40.185 --> 00:03:42.822
-and break a (bleep) neck."
-I mean, the police feel like

00:03:42.855 --> 00:03:46.792
-they're, uh... it's an us
against them mentality. -Right.

00:03:46.825 --> 00:03:50.196
You know? And they always talk
about no snitchin', you know?

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:51.864
-No snitchin' in the hood.
-Right, right, right.

00:03:51.897 --> 00:03:54.467
You know, they...
Why won't they tell us

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.535
when there's a crime
committed in the hood?

00:03:56.568 --> 00:03:58.838
These people never speak.
These people are never

00:03:58.871 --> 00:04:01.941
gonna say nothing when we
go and ask them who did it.

00:04:01.974 --> 00:04:04.010
There's a no-snitchin' policy
in the hood,

00:04:04.043 --> 00:04:07.146
but it's a no-snitchin' policy
in the precinct, too.

00:04:07.179 --> 00:04:08.881
-That's exactly right.
-Because when they see

00:04:08.914 --> 00:04:11.651
their fellow officers
doing something wrong,

00:04:11.684 --> 00:04:13.886
they don't snitch,
they don't tell,

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:17.423
they-they keep it to themselves,
so how do they expect us

00:04:17.456 --> 00:04:20.493
to not have a no-snitchin'
policy in the neighborhood

00:04:20.526 --> 00:04:22.862
when they got a no-snitchin'
policy in the department?

00:04:22.895 --> 00:04:24.830
Maybe we can all
come together and agree that

00:04:24.863 --> 00:04:26.232
there should not be snitches.

00:04:26.265 --> 00:04:29.568
We could start a no-snitchin'
police outreach program.

00:04:29.601 --> 00:04:31.270
Yeah, without...
without a doubt.

00:04:31.303 --> 00:04:33.539
Let me ask you this last
question about your movie, okay?

00:04:33.572 --> 00:04:35.741
What-what was it like working
with Nicki Minaj?

00:04:35.774 --> 00:04:37.743
I don't know how much acting
she's done. I'll tell you what,

00:04:37.776 --> 00:04:40.613
describe Nicki Minaj
in 750 words.

00:04:40.646 --> 00:04:43.015
(laughter)

00:04:43.048 --> 00:04:44.684
I mean, you know, great.

00:04:44.717 --> 00:04:46.085
(laughter)

00:04:46.118 --> 00:04:47.687
-Good luck with the movie, too.
-Appreciate it.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.889
Thank you, man.

00:04:49.922 --> 00:04:52.892
Thanks again to Common and Ice
Cube for sitting down with me.

00:04:52.925 --> 00:04:55.895
Go see<i> Barbershop,</i> you guys,<i> The
 Next Cut!</i> We'll be right back!

00:04:55.928 --> 00:04:57.864
(cheering and applause)
