00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:00.790
All right.

00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.660
Let's do another practice question
using unit conversions which,

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:07.030
of course,
means using our favorite number, one.

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:10.030
So let's say we're throwing a party and
we're going to serve chicken wings to

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:16.760
our guests, and we're going to serve
0.3 pounds of wings per person.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.510
And we're expecting that there
will be 60 people at the party.

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:27.432
And, finally, we know that chicken wings
come in 24 ounce packages for $6 each.

00:00:27.432 --> 00:00:30.140
The question is how much will you pay.

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:32.330
Enter your answer here.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.270
And this is a pretty involved question,
so

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.680
if you don't get it right
the first time, don't worry.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:38.620
But give it your best shot.
