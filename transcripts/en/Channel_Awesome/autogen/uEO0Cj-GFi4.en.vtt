gonna miss that glider uh you know I saw
 

00:06:45.729 --> 00:06:47.730 align:start position:0%
gonna miss that glider uh you know I saw
attending<00:06:46.300><c> where</c><00:06:46.600><c> he</c><00:06:46.690><c> sets</c><00:06:47.080><c> it</c><00:06:47.199><c> up</c><00:06:47.350><c> and</c><00:06:47.560><c> lets</c>

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:47.740 align:start position:0%
attending where he sets it up and lets
 

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:50.640 align:start position:0%
attending where he sets it up and lets
it<00:06:47.889><c> burn</c><00:06:48.070><c> ever</c><00:06:48.400><c> so</c><00:06:48.759><c> surly</c><00:06:49.150><c> yeah</c><00:06:49.419><c> but</c><00:06:49.840><c> maybe</c>

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:50.650 align:start position:0%
it burn ever so surly yeah but maybe
 

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:52.290 align:start position:0%
it burn ever so surly yeah but maybe
they'd<00:06:50.979><c> have</c><00:06:51.130><c> something</c><00:06:51.460><c> stronger</c><00:06:51.970><c> there</c><00:06:52.120><c> but</c>

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:52.300 align:start position:0%
they'd have something stronger there but
 

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:54.090 align:start position:0%
they'd have something stronger there but
then<00:06:52.389><c> the</c><00:06:52.509><c> more</c><00:06:52.630><c> thing</c><00:06:52.840><c> about</c><00:06:53.020><c> like</c><00:06:53.320><c> yeah</c><00:06:54.070><c> that</c>

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:54.100 align:start position:0%
then the more thing about like yeah that
 

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:55.710 align:start position:0%
then the more thing about like yeah that
gliders<00:06:54.729><c> been</c><00:06:54.940><c> like</c><00:06:55.150><c> there</c><00:06:55.449><c> from</c><00:06:55.660><c> the</c>

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:55.720 align:start position:0%
gliders been like there from the
 

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.330 align:start position:0%
gliders been like there from the
beginning<00:06:56.139><c> it's</c><00:06:56.289><c> gonna</c><00:06:56.410><c> be</c><00:06:56.590><c> weird</c><00:06:56.860><c> just</c><00:06:57.160><c> that</c>

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:57.340 align:start position:0%
beginning it's gonna be weird just that
 

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:59.610 align:start position:0%
beginning it's gonna be weird just that
being<00:06:57.580><c> gone</c><00:06:57.990><c> just</c><00:06:58.990><c> there</c><00:06:59.169><c> being</c><00:06:59.350><c> no</c><00:06:59.470><c> more</c>

00:06:59.610 --> 00:06:59.620 align:start position:0%
being gone just there being no more
 

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:01.650 align:start position:0%
being gone just there being no more
glider<00:06:59.949><c> so</c><00:07:00.310><c> maybe</c><00:07:00.940><c> he'll</c><00:07:01.090><c> make</c><00:07:01.210><c> enough</c><00:07:01.479><c> make</c>

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:01.660 align:start position:0%
glider so maybe he'll make enough make
 

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:03.779 align:start position:0%
glider so maybe he'll make enough make
another<00:07:01.900><c> one</c><00:07:02.050><c> I</c><00:07:02.139><c> don't</c><00:07:02.169><c> know</c><00:07:02.440><c> but</c><00:07:02.800><c> also</c><00:07:03.220><c> he</c><00:07:03.639><c> has</c>

00:07:03.779 --> 00:07:03.789 align:start position:0%
another one I don't know but also he has
 

00:07:03.789 --> 00:07:05.400 align:start position:0%
