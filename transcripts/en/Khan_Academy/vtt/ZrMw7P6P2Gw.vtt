00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:02.400
Last video, we saw what
happens when we have

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.970
resistors in series.

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:05.390
Now let's see what happens
when we have

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:07.600
resistors in parallel.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.860
All right, let me pick
a new color.

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.960
New color will be magenta.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.720
There's my battery: positive,
negative.

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.140
There's my ideal conducting
wire.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.000
Here's my ideal conducting wire,
but then-- and this is

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.460
new-- it branches off, and
I have two resistances.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.710
I have one here.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.140
And that's another resistance.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.320
And let's say that this has a
resistance R1, this has a

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.130
resistance R2.

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.220
And, of course, the
non-intuitive convention is

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.180
that the current flows from the
positive to the negative

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.410
terminal, but we know that the
electrons are actually flowing

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:58.370
in the other direction.

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.910
And I want to keep saying that,
because I think it's so

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.700
important to understand what's
actually happening as opposed

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.870
to the convention.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.450
Well, anyway, in the previous
video, we said, well, when we

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.610
have devices or components in
series, that the current

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.540
through the entire circuit
is constant.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.770
But let's think about
what happens here.

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.660
So we have these electrons--
actually, let's think about it

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:21.300
from the electron flow.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.240
The electrons are flowing,
flowing, flowing at a given

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.770
rate, and then here they
have a choice.

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.070
Some of them can take this top
path, some of them can take

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.160
this bottom path.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:38.110
So if you think about it, the
flow of electrons in this

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.920
branch plus the flow of
electrons in that branch have

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.130
to add up to the flow
of the electrons in

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.190
this branch, right?

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.610
And then they're going to meet
back up, and then the flow of

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.490
electrons here-- so if we think
of it this way, and now

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.510
I'm going to go back to the
convention, this is I1.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.110
So you have these electrons
flowing at a given rate.

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.160
This is the current
right here.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.560
They're going to branch off,
and maybe half of them go--

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.800
we'll see if the resistances
are equal, if both of these

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.280
branches have an equal amount
of capacity in terms of how

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.030
fast the electrons
can flow through.

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.220
If they're equal, or since we're
going to current in this

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.390
direction, let's talk about
positrons or positive charges.

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.950
If the positive charges--
although I just want to keep

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.350
saying that it is
not the positive

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:26.170
charges that are moving.

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.900
It's the electrons.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.680
But if you say that the lack of
electrons can flow equally

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.950
easily between both paths,
that's if the resistances were

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.500
the same, we could imagine that
the current, the flow,

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.270
would split itself up,
and then over here

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:39.180
would meet back up.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.000
And then we would say that the
current here would also be I1.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.970
But let's figure out where
the current's going.

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.120
Let's call this current I2 and
let's call this current I3.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.660
So I think it is reasonable, and
you can imagine with water

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.550
pipes or anything, that the
current going into the branch

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:07.590
is equal to the current
exiting the branch.

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.830
Or you could even think of it
that the current entering--

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.110
when the currents I2 and I1
merge, that they combine and

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:16.520
they become Current 1, right?

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:17.450
I mean, think about it.

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.800
In a given second, if this is
5 coulombs per second-- I'm

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:31.660
just making up numbers-- and
this is 6 coulombs per second,

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.320
in a given second right here,
you're going to have 5

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.760
coulombs coming from this branch
and 6 coulombs coming

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.850
from this branch, so you're
going to have 11 coulombs per

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.190
second coming out once they've
merged, so this would be 11

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.800
coulombs per second.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.420
So I think hopefully that makes
sense to you that this

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.480
current is equal to the
combination of this current

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.120
and that current.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.900
Now, what do we also know?

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:03.090
We also know the voltage along
this entire ideal wire is

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.800
constant, so then voltage-- let
me draw that in another

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.260
color, in blue.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.900
So, for example, the voltage
anywhere along this blue that

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:19.350
I'm filling in is going to be
the same, because this wire is

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.220
an ideal conductor, and you can
almost view this blue part

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:24.830
as an extension of the positive

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.810
terminal of the battery.

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.850
And very similarly-- I'll do it
in yellow-- we could draw

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.430
this wire as an extension
of the negative

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.750
terminal of the battery.

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.280
This is an extension
of the negative

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.530
terminal of the battery.

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.800
So the voltage difference
between here and here-- so

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.440
let's call that the total
voltage, or let's just call it

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.480
the voltage, right?

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.980
The voltage difference between
that point and that point is

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:58.600
the exact same thing as the
voltage difference between

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.290
this point and this point, which
is the exact same thing

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:04.180
as the voltage difference
between this

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.200
point and this point.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.510
So what can we say?

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:10.890
What is the total current
in the system?

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:12.880
If we just viewed this as a
black box, that this is some

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.880
type of total resistance, well,
the total current in the

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.260
system would be the total
voltage, the voltage divided

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.590
by-- let's call this our total
resistance, right?

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.580
Let's say we couldn't see this
and we just said, oh, that's

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:32.840
just some total resistance,
and that is equal to the

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.140
current going through R1.

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:37.350
This is I1.

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.100
This is a 1 right here.

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:40.350
This is current I1.

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:43.560
What's current I1?

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:47.160
Well, it's going to be the
voltage across this resistor

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.990
divided by the resistance,
right?

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:53.210
That's what Ohm's law tells
us: V is equal to IR, or

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:57.770
another way we could say it is V
over R is equal to I, right?

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:01.080
So I1 is equal to the voltage
across this resistor, but we

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.590
just said that voltage
is the same thing as

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:04.350
this voltage, right?

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:06.330
The voltage here is the same
thing as the voltage here.

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.090
The voltage here is the same
thing as the voltage here.

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:11.840
So the voltage across that
resistor is still V, and so

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.980
the current flowing across that
resistor is V over R1.

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:19.400
And the same logic:
what is I2?

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.160
I2 is this current.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.900
What is the voltage across
this device?

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:25.930
Well, that's just
V again, right?

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:28.400
It's the same thing as the
voltage across this device, so

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:32.450
it's V over R2 by Ohm's law.

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:34.870
Well, all these V's are the
same, so we can divide both

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:38.100
sides of that equation by V,
and we get 1 over the total

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:46.160
resistance is equal to 1
over R1 plus 1 over R2.

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.300
And you could make that argument
if we had an R3 here.

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:54.520
Let's say that we had another
device, and that is R3.

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.430
You could use the exact same
argument, and you would have a

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:58.590
plus 1 over R3.

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:02.260
And if you had Rn or 10 of them,
you'd just keep that 1

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.350
over R4, R5, et cetera.

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:08.170
So let's see if we can use
this information we have

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:10.100
learned to actually solve a
problem, and I actually find

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:12.760
that it's always easier to
solve a problem than to

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:15.740
explain the theory
behind a problem.

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:17.750
You'll see that with most of
these circuit problems, it's

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:19.860
actually very basic
mathematics.

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:23.510
So let's say I have a 16
volt battery plus,

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:27.380
minus, it's 16 volts.

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:29.660
And just to hit the point home
that you always don't have to

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:32.090
draw circuits the same, although
it is nice if you're

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:33.900
actually drawing complicated
circuits, I could

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:34.950
draw it like this.

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:38.650
I could draw the circuit like
this, and let's say that

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:39.806
there's a resistor here.

00:07:39.806 --> 00:07:43.230
And then let's say there's a
wire and then there's another

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:47.460
resistor here, and that this
decides to do some random

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:51.200
loopy thing here and that they
connect here, and that they

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:52.590
come back here.

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:55.710
This strange thing that I have
drawn, which you will never

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:57.970
see in any textbook, because
most people are more

00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:02.080
reasonable than me, is the exact
same-- you can almost

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:05.440
view it topologically as the
exact same circuit as what I

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.740
drew in the previous diagram,
although now I will assign

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:08.730
numbers to it.

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:16.810
Let's say that this resistance
is 20 ohms and let's say that

00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:23.590
this resistance is 5 ohms. What
I want to know is, what

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:26.690
is the current through
the system?

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:28.040
First, we'll have to figure
out what the equivalent

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.460
resistance is, and then we could
just use Ohm's law to

00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:31.720
figure out the current
in the system.

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:34.070
So we want to know what the
current is, and we know that

00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:37.240
the convention is that current
flows from the positive

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:39.400
terminal to the negative
terminal.

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:41.679
So how do we figure out the
equivalent resistance?

00:08:41.679 --> 00:08:44.890
Well, we know that we just
hopefully proved to you that

00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:49.950
the total resistance is equal to
1 over this resistor plus 1

00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:52.930
over this resistor.

00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:57.300
So 1 over-- I won't
keep writing it.

00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:58.880
What's 1 over 20?

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:01.750
Well, actually, let's just
make it a fraction.

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:06.130
So it's 1/20 plus-- 1/5
is what over 20?

00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:07.880
That's 4/20, right?

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:14.060
So 1 over our total resistance
is equal to 5/20, which is

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:14.650
equal to what?

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:15.900
1/4.

00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:22.520
So if 1/R is equal to 1/4,
R must be equal to 4.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:25.850
R is equal to 4 ohms.

00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:30.260
So we could redraw this
crazy circuit as this.

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.100
I'll try to draw it
small down here.

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:40.950
We could redraw this where this
resistance is 4 ohms and

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:43.600
this is 16 volts.

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:47.140
We could say that this whole
thing combined is really just

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:52.770
a resistor that is 4 ohms. Well,
if we have a 16-volt

00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:55.340
potential difference, current
is flowing that way, even

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:56.910
though that's not what the
electrons are doing.

00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:58.890
And that's what our
resistance is, 4

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:00.270
ohms. What is the current?

00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:02.870
V equals IR, Ohms law.

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:05.020
The voltage is 16 volts.

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:11.330
It equals the current times 4
ohms. So current is equal to

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:15.460
16 divided by 4, is
equal to 4 amps.

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:17.150
So let's do something
interesting.

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:20.640
Let's figure out what the
current is flowing through.

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:21.470
What's this?

00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:27.330
What's the current I1 and
what's this current I2?

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:29.430
Well, we know that the potential
difference from here

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:31.330
to here is also 16
volts, right?

00:10:31.330 --> 00:10:35.530
Because this whole thing is
essentially at the same

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:37.420
potential and this whole thing
is essentially at the same

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:40.990
potential, so you have 16
volts across there.

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:46.610
16 volts divided by 20 ohms,
so let's call this I1.

00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:54.830
So I1 is equal to 16 volts
divided by 20 ohms, which is

00:10:54.830 --> 00:10:55.300
equal to what?

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:56.660
4/5.

00:10:56.660 --> 00:11:02.820
So it equals 4/5 of an ampere,
or 0.8 amperes.

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:05.440
And similarly, what is the
amount of current flowing

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:06.810
through here?

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:07.590
I2?

00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:09.110
I'm going to do this in
a different color.

00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:11.546
It's getting confusing.

00:11:11.546 --> 00:11:13.030
I'll do it in the
vibrant yellow.

00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:15.090
So the current flowing through
here, once again, the

00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:17.680
potential difference from here--
that's not different

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:19.890
enough-- the potential
difference from here to here

00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:22.190
is also 16 volts, right?

00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:26.240
So the current is going to be
I2, is going to be equal to

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:35.390
16/5, which is equal
to 3 1/5 amps.

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:37.730
So most of the current is
actually flowing through this,

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:40.530
and that makes sense because the
resistance is less, right?

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:42.230
So that should hopefully give
you a little bit of intuition

00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:42.980
of what's going on.

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:45.910
And less current is flowing
through here, so I2 through

00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:53.630
the 20-ohm resistor is 0.8 amps
is I1, and I2 through the

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:58.250
5-ohm resistor is equal
to 3.2 amps.

00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:00.740
And it makes sense that when
you add these two currents

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:04.560
together, the 3.2 amperes
flowing through here and the

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:07.000
0.8 amperes flowing through
here, that when they merge,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.840
they merge and then you have 4
amperes flowing through there.

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:14.280
Anyway, hopefully, I have given
you some intuition on

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:17.850
what happens when we put
resistors in parallel.

00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:19.100
I will see you in
the next video.
