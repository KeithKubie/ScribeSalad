00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.720
Processed meat contains things that might
not be good for the human body to consume.

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.029
But what are those things?

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:11.320
And WHYYYYY BACON?!

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.750
WHYYYYYY?!

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.650
meat-lovers pizzas
Cancer and bacon, two words no breakfast-lover

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.230
wants to hear, the yearning for bacon is just
too strong.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.080
Processed meat has been a bane for years…
and a new study confirms what many other studies

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:32.149
have: Red Meat is BAD (especially when processed).

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:36.890
Carcinogen is a word thrown around about sun
exposure, Melphalan, alcoholic beverages,

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.330
Plutonium, Crystalline: in the form of Quartz
or Cristobalite, Smokeless tobacco, smoking

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.960
tobacco, Leather dust, Silica Dust, wood dust…
whatever a bunch of dusts… coffee, and ALSO

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.640
exposure to the little black bits on the edge
of grilled meats.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.370
These are all on a list created by the World
Health Organization's International Agency

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.620
for Research on Cancer.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.910
Fun fact: there are 984 things on the list;
some cause cancer, some don't.

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.280
But, processed meat is now there because of
its nasty tendency to cause colorectal cancer.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.280
Maybe.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.280
Kind of.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.280
Maybe.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.380
When we cook meats, like hot dogs, bacon or
fancy steak (processed or not) we chemically

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:15.380
alter them.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.940
As meat cooks, the chemicals found inside
of them can form heterocyclic amines (HCAs),

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:25.729
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and
advanced glycation end products (AGEs).

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.120
These compounds are fine on their own, but
when we eat them, they break down and mess

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.130
with our colonic DNA causing colorectal cancer!

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.590
So the World Health Org finally added these
to the list as a Group 1 carcinogen, meaning

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.090
it DEFINITELY causes cancer -- the thing is,
Plutonium causes a lot of cancer, bacon only

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:44.409
causes a little.

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:46.010
They're not equally dangerous.

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.640
But the question is, what the hell is a processed
meat?

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:55.219
Processed red meat, is mammalian muscle meat
such as beef, veal, pork, lamb, mutton, horse,

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:59.580
and goat which has been transformed due to
"salting, curing, fermentation, smoking, or

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.310
other processes to enhance flavor or improve
preservation."

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.200
Note, unlike some Paleo peeps, cutting does
not count as "processing."

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.010
When meat is processed it is chemically altered
to increase shelf life, change the flavor,

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.560
or be more stable.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.830
Unfortunately for sausage-lovers, carcinogenic
chemicals like PAHs can be created during

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.670
processing, but so can n-nitroso compounds!

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.510
N-Nitroso compounds are some of the most carcinogenic
things on earth, and usually result when meat

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.640
is exposed to nitrites or nitrogen oxides.

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.640
We've known N-Nitrosos are carcinogens for
more than 50 years, and people don't seem

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.500
to be dropping left and right, even though
we're eating more meat today than 50 years

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.500
ago.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.410
The WHO said a 50g increase in processed meat
could increase cancer risk by 18 percent,

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.850
but also admitted the evidence is slight.

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.959
The thing is, humans built our society on
the ability to get more energy from our food,

00:02:53.959 --> 00:03:01.300
we cook it (which adds carcinogens) and we
eat red meat but our ancient human ancestors

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.379
didn't live long enough to get cancer from
these things!

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:09.989
Red meat was also added to the WHO's list
as group 2A -- which means it probably causes

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:10.989
cancer.

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:14.190
FYI: red meat includes pork; don't give in
to marketing.

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.950
We've known for a long time meats like these
increased risks of cancer.

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:23.129
A 28-year-long Archives of Internal Medicine
study published in 2012 found people who eat

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:28.209
more red meat die younger from cardiovascular
disease and cancers; even when adjusted for

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:29.629
other life factors.

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:33.550
So, processed meats are any meat that's been
altered from its natural state with salts

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:38.040
or additives, and red meat it just mammalian
meat; fowl not included.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.730
In the end, as people live longer, and want
to be healthier into their 70s and 80s, we

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:43.730
have to watch what we eat.

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:44.910
It's a fact of life.

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:49.750
The easiest way is to reduce processed meats
in your diets, and even having a couple of

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.849
meat-free days a week will teach you to eat
a variety of things, rather than just hamburgers.

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:59.100
Vegetarians don't rejoice too much, meat is
still a great source of B vitamins, minerals,

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.330
iron and zinc!

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.330
Eating it is still recommended, but just…
not as much.

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.201
If you're one of our critical thinkers out
there, you're probably wondering -- as we

00:04:06.201 --> 00:04:10.700
did -- how the heck the meat industry didn't
put a kielbasa-sized kibosh on this whole

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.270
announcement, as it was sure to affect their
bottom line…

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:31.830
So how powerful is the meat industry, anyway?

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.890
How much red meat do you eat?

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:44.020
Do you plan to eat less?
