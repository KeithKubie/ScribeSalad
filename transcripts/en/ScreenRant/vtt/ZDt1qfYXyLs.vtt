00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:07.830
In 1928 when Walt Disney had Mickey Mouse
whistle on a steamboat and squeak his first

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.860
words he never realized how big his Disney
Princess franchise would be.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.520
Maybe that’s why it took over 20 years for
him to release another Disney princess film

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.949
after 1937’s release of Snow White and the
Seven Dwarfs.

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:22.741
These animated beauties have become so popular
with children and grownups alike that we all

00:00:22.741 --> 00:00:26.720
know that one slipper can change a life or
that we can use a fork as a comb.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.369
Still, there are a lot of facts we didn’t
realize about Disney’s Princess that are

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:32.369
surprising.

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.210
Subscribe and get ready for Screen Rant’s
list of ten Things You May Not Have Realized

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.920
About Disney Movie Princesses.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:49.590
Mulan’s Kills in Mulan

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.110
Mulan is the first Disney Princess to not
be a Princess by blood or by marriage and

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.650
her character is based on a mythological character,
the Chinese epic hero Hua Mulan.

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:03.190
Still, with all of these facts the most astonishing
might be her kill count.

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.140
Mulan causes an avalanche that sweeps over
2000 Hun solders and her actions cause the

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.460
death of all but 6 of them.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.990
Then on top of that one of the six that survive
is main villain Shan-Yu and she pins him to

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.110
a roof with her sword then Mushu fires a rocket
at him.

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:24.850
That’s a kill count of 1,994 plus one assisted
death of animated characters, making her the

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.960
biggest badass Princess around.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.760
Elsa’s Voice Cast in Frozen

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:40.479
Disney’s 2013 smash hit, Frozen melted the
hearts of audiences with all the lovable characters

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:44.119
in the film but millions of little girls wanted
to be just one character.

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:47.439
Princess Elsa, the youngest sibling in the
film but what about Princess Greta?

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:48.439
That was her original name before the writers
settle on Elsa.

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:52.890
Since Princess Elsa is five and 18 years old
in the film, it took four actresses to perform

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:53.890
her voice.

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.570
Two for singing and two for dialogue with
Kristen Bell having the most screen time and

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:02.270
giving Princess Elsa the most voice-over actors
for a Disney Princess character.

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.930
Cinderella’s Shoe Size in Cinderella

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.390
There are thousands of versions around the
world of the mythical story of Cinderella

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.569
but none more popular than 1950’s Disney
film.

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.870
With over 400 actresses auditioning for the
title role they would be stunned to find out

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.450
that the name Cinderella wasn’t her real
name in previous stories.

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.062
Cinderella was a nickname but Disney felt
that it was a perfect name for a princess

00:02:25.062 --> 00:02:27.060
and decided to use it as her real name.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.120
In the sequels we also find out that her shoe
size was a tiny four and a half.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.090
Being that the average woman’s foot size
is 7, now we know why her sister’s cut off

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.430
their toes in previous stories to fit into
the glass slipper.

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.290
Merida’s Hair in Brave

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.220
Originally titled, The Bear and the Bow; Disney’s
2012 animated film Brave follows the story

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.060
of Princess Merida who is determined to make
her own path in life.

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.720
She is the first Disney Princess to not have
a love interest in the film and the first

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.380
to have a biological brother.

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.030
Actually she has three brothers.

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.940
Still, her curly red hair is usually the most
stunning.

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:11.000
It is made up of 111,700 hairs that were generated
from over 1500 individually sculpted models.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.959
Luckily she was animated or she would have
taken a long time to prepare her hair in the

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.250
morning and the film would have ran longer.

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:24.060
Snow White’s Age in Snow White in Snow White
and the Seven Dwarfs

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.890
Most little girls are fans of Disney Princesses,
they love dressing up as them and imagining

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.189
they will be these characters when they grow
up.

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:34.189
Little do they realize some of these Princesses
aren’t that much older than they are.

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:39.330
Belle is 17, Jasmine is 15 and coming in first
place as the youngest Disney Princess of all

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.459
time is Snow White at 14 years young.

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:47.930
She’s not allowed to drive, vote, drink
or smoke but she can live with seven men and

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:53.230
be swept off her feet by Prince Charming.

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:58.189
Jasmine’s Name in Aladdin

00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:02.140
Princess Jasmine was based on a character
from an Arabic folktale called One Thousand

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.760
and One Nights but was almost named after
a character from another book.

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.000
She was originally going to be named Badroulbadour
from the book, Arabian Nights after the princess

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.799
that marries Aladdin in that book.

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:15.800
We can only imagine the fuss the marketing
team made when they were told to market merchandise

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.640
for Princess Badroulbadour.

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.880
Nice idea on the name change Disney, even
if we would like to have heard Robin Williams

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:27.140
tackle that name with his improv.

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:33.250
Pocahontas’ Tattoo in Pocahontas

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.190
Pocahontas is the only Disney Princess to
be based on a real character and most believe

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.600
her to be the first Native American Disney
Princess but Tiger Lily from 1953’s Peter

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.470
Pan is actually the first.

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.690
She does have a few more firsts though.

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:51.250
She is the first to never change her costume
and never wear a tiara like her other Disney

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:52.360
Princess counterparts.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.210
She is also, the first and only Princess to
have a tattoo.

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:07.710
Well, maybe she’s the only one who has shown
it and the others are shy still.

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.390
Auroa Screen Time in Sleeping Beauty

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:14.980
Auroa is the only Disney Princess to have
her first film be a commercial flop, only

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:18.890
grossing 5.3 million dollars on a budget of
6 million dollars.

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:22.990
Maybe it’s because of her lack of screen
time, she is only on screen for 18 minutes

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.830
of the 76 minute film and coincidentally only
has 18 lines of dialogue.

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:31.710
Or maybe it has to do with the 6 years it
took Princess Aurora to arrive on screen,

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:35.650
since Walt Disney was preoccupied with building
Disneyland and kept holding up production

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:39.990
of the film.

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.460
Rapunzel’s Hair Length in Tangled

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:47.180
Princess Rapunzel might have been the first
Disney Princess to grace the silver screen

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.210
since her story was worked on as a concept
before Walt Disney settled on Snow White and

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:52.520
the Seven Dwarfs.

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.190
Not surprisingly she is the Disney Princess
with the longest hair but did you know she

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:58.110
also has the shortest hair.

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:02.560
After cutting her hair she beat out Snow White
for that honor over seventy years after she

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:09.670
was passed up for her own feature film.

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:16.440
Belle’s Sisters in Beauty and the Beast

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:20.030
Beauty and the Beast is the only animated
Disney film starring a Princess that has been

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:22.510
nominated for a Best Picture Academy Award.

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:25.730
This has to do with the wonderful story that
the filmmakers delivered.

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:30.050
Though, in earlier drafts of the script Belle
had a two sister that were nowhere near as

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:32.440
kind and loving as Belle.

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:36.860
Then a next draft the writer combined the
sisters into a single character, Marguerite,

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:40.700
Belle's aunt, who shared several similar characteristics
to the sisters.

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:46.080
All three characters we written out and we
have the charming film we have today.

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.360
