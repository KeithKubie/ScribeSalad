1
00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.570
And live. Hello Bernie. How are you Joe? Wonderful. Pleasure to meet you.

2
00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:09.760
Nice to meet you. It's exciting to have you here man.

3
00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.780
And it's obviously an exciting time for you. Um, you know,

4
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.490
presidential campaign is up in full swing. Do you, do you get frustrated by the,

5
00:00:18.491 --> 00:00:21.130
the time constraints of the debates?

6
00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.950
<v 1>Uh, absolutely. It's, you shouldn't even call them with the beat.</v>

7
00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.470
What they are is a, um, you know,

8
00:00:30.471 --> 00:00:34.460
reality TV show in which you have to come up with a sound bite and all that

9
00:00:34.461 --> 00:00:35.420
stuff. It is the meaning,

10
00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.690
it's the meaning to the candidates and it's the meaning to the American people.

11
00:00:38.691 --> 00:00:43.490
You can't explain the complexity of healthcare in America in 45 seconds.

12
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:44.593
Nobody can.

13
00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.230
<v 0>But why is it still done that way if you'd to try to, let's pull this thing</v>

14
00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.500
<v 1>great. Um, you know,</v>

15
00:00:51.501 --> 00:00:54.290
I think the DNC is in a difficult position.

16
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.580
They have 20 plus candidates and they want to give everybody a fair shot,

17
00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.880
which is the right thing to do. Uh,

18
00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.880
and then if you're gonna have 10 candidates up on the stage, what do you do?

19
00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.080
But there are other ways that we've got to do it because the issues facing this

20
00:01:09.081 --> 00:01:12.530
country of someone normous and in some cases so complicated,

21
00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.190
nobody in the world can honestly explain them in 45 seconds.

22
00:01:16.191 --> 00:01:20.330
And then that what encourages people to do is to come up with sound to do absurd

23
00:01:20.331 --> 00:01:23.840
things up. I yelled and scream on the show. I took my clothes off. Uh,

24
00:01:23.841 --> 00:01:25.190
it would get a lot of publicity, right?

25
00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.770
But if you give a thoughtful answer to a complicated question,

26
00:01:27.771 --> 00:01:29.180
it's not so sexy for the media.

27
00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.940
<v 0>Well, you don't even have a chance to give a thoughtful answer. Let go.</v>

28
00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.500
Tulsi Gabbert went after Camilla Harris and then Conwell Harris said about 12

29
00:01:36.501 --> 00:01:40.880
seconds to reply to it. It was so ridiculous to, to,

30
00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.540
to have something that's such an important issue. Like did your,

31
00:01:44.541 --> 00:01:48.290
did you not put all those people in jail for marijuana? Did you laugh about it?

32
00:01:48.291 --> 00:01:49.730
Did this happen? Did that happen?

33
00:01:49.731 --> 00:01:53.660
All these different things was evidenced withheld by, that's how they,

34
00:01:53.661 --> 00:01:55.400
these are a long conversation,

35
00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.440
<v 1>but it takes us to another issue and that as a nation we do a pretty bad job in</v>

36
00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.820
analyzing and discussing the serious issues facing our country.

37
00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.390
And I hold the media to some degree responsible for that. You know,

38
00:02:09.391 --> 00:02:12.730
other countries, what they do is that he, Joe, you want to run for president?

39
00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.750
I'll tell you what would the your potty in the general election,

40
00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.700
we're going to give you a certain amount of time,

41
00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.540
hours on television and you use those hours anyway you want,

42
00:02:21.541 --> 00:02:24.810
you want a 15 minute discussion. You remember Ross Perot? Yes.

43
00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.560
And people used to laugh at Ross Perot because he used to get up there with the

44
00:02:28.561 --> 00:02:31.620
chart and all this stuff and, and the media made fun of him,

45
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.970
but in fact he tried in his own weight to explain his point of view to the

46
00:02:35.971 --> 00:02:39.000
American people. And we need serious discussion on, on serious issues.

47
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.160
<v 0>Well, he had the op, he, because he was so rich,</v>

48
00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:44.790
he had the ability to buy air time on network television,

49
00:02:44.791 --> 00:02:46.140
which is pretty unprecedented.

50
00:02:46.141 --> 00:02:50.070
He just bought a chunk of air time and then pled his case.

51
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.010
<v 1>But you know what goes on in other countries,</v>

52
00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.510
you don't have to by that time what the obligation is. If you are a network,

53
00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.280
you're going to make that time free and available to candidates.

54
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.730
<v 0>Do you think that that's something that could be viable in American? We could.</v>

55
00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.530
Could you convince CBS and NBC and ABC to go along with something like that? No,

56
00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.770
you couldn't convince them. You'd have to pass legislation to make Lynn hub,

57
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.170
but everyone's online today. The, I mean,

58
00:03:14.171 --> 00:03:18.040
the entire country is essentially getting email and Facebook and all that jazz.

59
00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:23.070
Like why bother doing it in this particular medium that has an inherent time

60
00:03:23.411 --> 00:03:24.244
constraint?

61
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.440
<v 1>Well, you're right. I mean, the Internet has revolutionized politics,</v>

62
00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.490
uh, and in many ways, good ways. We use our social media, our email list,

63
00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:35.500
which is very large.

64
00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:38.620
We every day was sending out stuff and other candidates are doing it the same

65
00:03:38.621 --> 00:03:41.320
way. But television still has a very important role to be playing.

66
00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:42.201
<v 0>I'm sure it does,</v>

67
00:03:42.201 --> 00:03:47.090
but I mean the ability to discuss things in in long form like you can do online,

68
00:03:47.091 --> 00:03:52.080
like you can do right here, right now. You can't get that on television wide.

69
00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.580
You could,

70
00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.360
I mean they would have to stay with at an interrupt you every 15 minutes.

71
00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:57.380
<v 1>No, no, no, no, no.</v>

72
00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.740
What I'm saying about is it is in what goes on in other countries,

73
00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:03.510
if I'm not mistaken, like don't hold me to this. I think in the UK,

74
00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.650
you're member, the Labor Party, your candidate, here's 30 minutes of time and

75
00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.070
<v 0>do with it as you want. Do you want to speak 30 minutes on healthcare?</v>

76
00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.290
Whatever it may be. You can do that. Really? Yeah.

77
00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.180
And they don't interrupt with commercial [inaudible]

78
00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:20.630
<v 1>or that they have given this is the candidates opportunity to speak Atlanta to</v>

79
00:04:20.631 --> 00:04:21.500
the people of the country.

80
00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.860
<v 0>What are, what are the misconceptions of you? Cause here's, here's the,</v>

81
00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.100
if you go to the knee jerk conservative reaction,

82
00:04:30.101 --> 00:04:34.210
you talk to people who are not interested in anyone that wants to be a

83
00:04:34.211 --> 00:04:37.150
democratic socialist. They hear the name Bernie Sanders.

84
00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:41.920
The negative implications are that you are somehow or another going to take

85
00:04:41.921 --> 00:04:44.500
their money, right? Does that annoying to you?

86
00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.020
<v 1>Yes it is. Of course it is. And also that line missed the Maduro.</v>

87
00:04:48.021 --> 00:04:50.870
I'm a dictator. I'd love dictatorships and all that stuff.

88
00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.560
And the truth is, Joe,

89
00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:59.600
that if you look at the issues that I campaign on and what I believe on,

90
00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.970
they are really not terribly radical.

91
00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:05.150
They exist in many countries all over the world. For example,

92
00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.040
just we can start on healthcare if you'd like.

93
00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:13.250
Is the idea that healthcare is a human right? Not a privilege, a radical idea.

94
00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.890
I don't think it is. It's not. And the truth is,

95
00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.950
we are the only major country on earth. Many people don't know this.

96
00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:23.120
We are the only major country on earth not to guarantee healthcare to all people

97
00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:24.201
as a human, right?

98
00:05:24.201 --> 00:05:28.490
And yet we end up spending almost twice as much per capita on healthcare.

99
00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:31.520
The function, and you can argue me with me if you want,

100
00:05:31.521 --> 00:05:35.310
but the function of the current healthcare system is not to provide quality care

101
00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:35.870
to all.

102
00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:40.070
It is to make tens of billions of dollars in profit for the drug companies and

103
00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.080
the insurance companies. That's the function.

104
00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:46.880
If you go to Canada and I live 50 miles away from the Canadian border,

105
00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:50.330
you have major heart surgery, you're in the hospital for a month.

106
00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:52.970
Do you know what the bill is when you're going out zero? You got it.

107
00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:54.740
You go to any doctor you want.

108
00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.580
You don't have to take out your wallet and yet guarantee your healthcare to all

109
00:05:58.581 --> 00:06:00.980
of their people and they spend one half of what we spend.

110
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:02.450
That's kind of what I want to do.

111
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.960
And I don't think that that's terribly radical. We have a program now,

112
00:06:05.961 --> 00:06:07.640
which everybody knows it's called Medicare.

113
00:06:07.641 --> 00:06:12.410
It was started by Lyndon Johnson back in 1965. It is a popular program.

114
00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:13.140
Uh,

115
00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:17.510
all that I want to do over a four year period is to expand the today eligibility

116
00:06:17.511 --> 00:06:18.560
age of 65.

117
00:06:18.561 --> 00:06:22.520
I want to take it out of 55 45 35 everybody over four year period.

118
00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:23.420
That's about it.

119
00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:27.950
And I want to expand benefits to include a dental care hearing aids on

120
00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:31.190
eyeglasses as well. That's about it. Not too radical.

121
00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.440
<v 0>Well, that doesn't sound radical at all. No. When you say that they,</v>

122
00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:35.640
that Canada spends less, obviously they have less people,

123
00:06:35.641 --> 00:06:38.220
you mean less per capita? Yes. Half per capita. Exactly.

124
00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:43.780
<v 1>And the quality of care is as good or better. Do they have problems? Yeah,</v>

125
00:06:43.781 --> 00:06:45.220
they have problems. Everybody has problems,

126
00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:50.370
but overall the healthcare experts will tell you the quality of care there is as

127
00:06:50.711 --> 00:06:54.370
good or better than it is in our country. So what's the hurdle? Okay,

128
00:06:54.371 --> 00:06:55.750
I'll tell you exactly what the hurdle is.

129
00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:59.920
The hurdle is exactly the same thing is in every other aspect of our lives,

130
00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:03.220
it's the power of money. All right. Listen to this.

131
00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:05.500
Over the last 20 years,

132
00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:11.340
the drug companies alone have spent four and a half billion dollars in 20 years

133
00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:17.860
on lobbying and campaign contributions. That's what we're up against,

134
00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:23.170
the knowledge, and I mark my words within a short period of time,

135
00:07:23.171 --> 00:07:27.160
you will see TV ads in California all over this country demonizing Bernie

136
00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:29.560
Sanders. He wants to do this terrible thing to you. He wants to do that.

137
00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:33.400
They have unbelievable amounts of money. Uh,

138
00:07:33.401 --> 00:07:38.210
and politicians are frightened of that power. Give you one example. Uh,

139
00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:43.060
back in 2016 I got involved here in a little way with an effort on the part of

140
00:07:43.061 --> 00:07:47.290
the nurses to control of the cost of prescription drugs in California.

141
00:07:47.291 --> 00:07:50.200
You may recall that effort I do. It was a battle,

142
00:07:50.201 --> 00:07:52.120
an item in one state here in California.

143
00:07:52.121 --> 00:07:55.630
Do you know how much the drug companies alone spent at the feet that epic,

144
00:07:55.690 --> 00:08:00.340
they spent $131 million on one ballot item in one state.

145
00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:06.010
All right? Last year, the top 10 drug companies made $69 billion.

146
00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:07.390
A week ago,

147
00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:11.050
I went to Canada with a number of Americans who are dealing with diabetes.

148
00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:16.660
We bought insulin in Windsor, Ontario for one 10th the price,

149
00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:19.960
10% of the price, same exact product being charged in America.

150
00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:25.620
So you got drug companies that are engaged in collusion and in price fixing who

151
00:08:25.871 --> 00:08:29.470
are incredibly greedy. And the result is many elderly people,

152
00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:32.380
many working people simply cannot afford the medicine they need it. This is,

153
00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:33.363
it's unbelievable.

154
00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:36.880
And the reason for all of that stuff is we are the only country in the world

155
00:08:36.881 --> 00:08:38.890
that does not negotiate with the drug companies.

156
00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:40.570
They can charge you any price they want.

157
00:08:41.290 --> 00:08:43.600
And that has to do with the fact that we don't have a national healthcare

158
00:08:43.601 --> 00:08:45.580
program. Medicare is not negotiating, et cetera.

159
00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:49.540
<v 0>Is this something that can really be implemented inside of four years?</v>

160
00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:52.510
[inaudible] it's an enormous endeavor.

161
00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:57.570
<v 1>Well, I want you to think back. Think back Joe. In 65, uh,</v>

162
00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:00.600
you had Linda Johnson as president and Pie.

163
00:09:00.601 --> 00:09:03.390
The way this idea of national healthcare,

164
00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:08.310
this has been talked about literally since Teddy Roosevelt is not a new concept.

165
00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:10.860
Healthcare as human rights is what Teddy Roosevelt was talking about.

166
00:09:10.861 --> 00:09:14.030
That's what FDR was looking about. Harry Truman was talking about it.

167
00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:16.770
Kennedy was talking about it. Kennedy got killed.

168
00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:20.760
Lyndon Johnson picked up the mantle and, and their idea was,

169
00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:22.740
according to people in their administration,

170
00:09:22.741 --> 00:09:25.680
we'll start with the elderly who are most impacted by,

171
00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:29.520
by healthcare costs and sickness. We'll start,

172
00:09:29.521 --> 00:09:32.820
and they did in 1965 without the technology we have today,

173
00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:37.560
they implemented Medicare. 19 million people,

174
00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:39.300
elderly people signed up in the first year.

175
00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:44.870
So if you could slot a brand new program and have 19 million people sign up with

176
00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:48.060
the technology, that is way, way behind where we are today,

177
00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:51.030
why can't we over a four year period, simply expand that program?

178
00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:54.390
I don't think it's such a, a difficult, uh, operation.

179
00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:58.310
<v 0>So when you talk about the drug companies and the lobbyists and the enormous</v>

180
00:09:58.311 --> 00:10:00.560
amount of money that they spend, is this,

181
00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:04.280
does this exist anywhere else other than the United States lobbyists on that

182
00:10:04.281 --> 00:10:05.114
level? No.

183
00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:08.180
<v 1>No, of course then, uh, and the reason, you know,</v>

184
00:10:08.181 --> 00:10:12.980
in Canada what you have is you have a national healthcare program and so forth,

185
00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:16.220
and they sit down and a, they negotiate with the drug companies.

186
00:10:16.221 --> 00:10:17.270
They have their own approach.

187
00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:20.780
But every other major country on earth says that the drug companies,

188
00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:24.410
of course you can't charge us any price you want. This is a reasonable price.

189
00:10:24.411 --> 00:10:28.250
Tell me what your profits are, what your expenditures. This is a price for us.

190
00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:30.410
You can walk in, you know, if you have an illness,

191
00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:33.680
you could walk into the pharmacy tomorrow and the price has been doubled and you

192
00:10:33.681 --> 00:10:36.200
say to the pharmacist, what happened? He said, they just raised their prices.

193
00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:39.080
They could do it any day they want, at any price they want.

194
00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:45.060
<v 0>Now lobbyists are in general, when people talk about lobbyists mean it's a,</v>

195
00:10:45.061 --> 00:10:48.760
it's an unattractive term. We, we think about it in terms of a negative.

196
00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:52.780
We don't, we don't think of, Oh thank God there's lobbyists. We think, wow,

197
00:10:52.781 --> 00:10:56.830
there's someone with enormous amounts of money using that money to gain

198
00:10:56.831 --> 00:11:00.280
influence on politicians and its shapes, regular people.

199
00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:03.220
It shapes our lives mostly in a negative way.

200
00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:06.760
This is the way most people look at it. I'm not saying it's correct. Why?

201
00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:10.970
Why do we have that system in place? Like why do we have lobbyist?

202
00:11:10.971 --> 00:11:14.320
Why is it legal for someone to spend exorbitant amount of money,

203
00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:18.670
exorbitant amounts of money to affect our civilization,

204
00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:20.320
to effect the way our cultural,

205
00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:24.040
<v 1>I know you're taking us into a whole new area. Yeah. All right, let's look.</v>

206
00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:26.740
Can I, let me detour and I'll come back. I'll do. All right.

207
00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.170
Today in America,

208
00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:36.270
you've got three people owning more wealth than the bottom half of the American

209
00:11:36.271 --> 00:11:38.040
society. You don't see that on television too much.

210
00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:40.230
You know you don't three people,

211
00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:45.090
you got the top 1% owning more wealth than the bottom. 92% listen to this,

212
00:11:45.091 --> 00:11:50.091
this is a statistic we recently saw came from the Federal Reserve over the last

213
00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:51.690
30 years.

214
00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:56.020
The top 1% seen a $21 trillion increase in their wealth.

215
00:11:56.500 --> 00:12:00.400
The bottom half of America has seen a $900 billion decline in net wealth.

216
00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:06.420
So what you have in America today is a relatively small number of incredibly

217
00:12:06.581 --> 00:12:08.900
wealthy people, and I deal with these guys everyday.

218
00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:11.410
People are only talking about rich, you don't know what riches,

219
00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:16.740
what multibillion dollar operations are incredible power over our society.

220
00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:20.770
And if you would look pharmaceutical industry and last,

221
00:12:20.771 --> 00:12:23.710
the atten companies made $69 billion in profit.

222
00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:26.950
You're sitting around right now saying, all right, that's great.

223
00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:29.440
How'd we do better next year? What strategy do we have?

224
00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:32.260
Where to pull out of ads on? We're going to work with others.

225
00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:36.670
During the CNN debate that I participated in recently in the debate,

226
00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:37.990
right in the middle of the debate,

227
00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:41.860
the drug companies and the insurance companies had an ad telling how bad

228
00:12:41.861 --> 00:12:45.730
so-called, how bad medicare for all would be. So they,

229
00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:49.210
they're smart guys and they use their power over politicians.

230
00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:50.800
They use their power over the media.

231
00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:52.690
They spend billions of dollars on advertising,

232
00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:56.830
on media to make sure that they make as much as they can in profit.

233
00:12:56.831 --> 00:12:58.510
But it's not any different with Wall Street.

234
00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:02.920
It's not any different than the puzzle fuel industry or the prison industrial

235
00:13:02.921 --> 00:13:05.770
complex. These guys have wealth, they have power,

236
00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:09.460
and they could care less about the needs of working people in this country.

237
00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:14.110
And that's the dynamic of American politics right now. And in our campaign,

238
00:13:14.111 --> 00:13:17.680
look, we've taken them all on and I know it makes a lot of people uncomfortable,

239
00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:23.200
but we are taking on all of these entities and all of their wealth and all of

240
00:13:23.201 --> 00:13:26.110
their power. And that's what a political revolution is about.

241
00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:30.910
<v 0>So the real problem seems to be that they have this strategy of unlimited</v>

242
00:13:30.911 --> 00:13:31.300
growth,

243
00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:35.230
not that they're not providing medication that people need to save their lives.

244
00:13:35.231 --> 00:13:39.340
I mean, it's obviously important to have pharmaceutical company, of course,

245
00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:41.860
of course. Right? So there's good that they provide,

246
00:13:41.861 --> 00:13:45.120
but the business aspect of it is where the problem lies. Right? Right.

247
00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:46.640
<v 1>Look, they have great researchers,</v>

248
00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:50.750
but if you check how they even spend their money, you know,

249
00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:53.390
they will tell you the, so all of them wanting got researched about,

250
00:13:53.391 --> 00:13:56.570
we're trying to, we're tackling cancer with tackling diabetes, Alzheimer's,

251
00:13:57.050 --> 00:13:58.070
the truths of costly.

252
00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:02.960
But the bulk of their money is going often to what we call Mitsu drugs.

253
00:14:02.961 --> 00:14:06.710
They make modest changes in a drug which really doesn't improve people's

254
00:14:06.711 --> 00:14:09.920
wellbeing in order to make profits. So the answer is yes,

255
00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:13.550
we need obviously vigorous research and development. And by the way,

256
00:14:13.551 --> 00:14:14.510
your tax dollars,

257
00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:19.460
all of our tax policy often goes to that research and we don't get the benefit

258
00:14:19.461 --> 00:14:20.294
of it in terms of lower

259
00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:24.350
<v 0>prices. So it's just, it's a business model issue.</v>

260
00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:26.100
It's a greed issue. You've got it.

261
00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:30.290
And how would one stop that when you're dealing with this,

262
00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:34.370
the kind of influence that you're talking about with $69 billion in a year?

263
00:14:34.371 --> 00:14:37.660
I mean the resources they have, how would you stop?

264
00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:43.240
<v 1>Well, that is kind of what we call the 60 $40 question. Yeah, right.</v>

265
00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:46.130
And I'll tell you what, I think this is what I believe.

266
00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:52.210
If you think back on American history and you think about the real changes that

267
00:14:55.251 --> 00:14:56.750
have taken place in society,

268
00:14:57.470 --> 00:15:01.190
you think about the labor movement and working class people standing up and

269
00:15:01.191 --> 00:15:04.490
saying to their employers, we're not going to be treated like animals anymore.

270
00:15:04.491 --> 00:15:08.800
You can hire and fire as you can't work us, you know, 15 hours a day. We, we,

271
00:15:08.801 --> 00:15:12.590
we deserve dignity. And you think about the growth of the labor movement,

272
00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:15.410
millions of people beginning to stand together and fight.

273
00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:17.630
You think about the civil rights movement, you know,

274
00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:20.960
and it wasn't just Dr. Martin Luther King Jr, it was again,

275
00:15:20.961 --> 00:15:24.410
millions of African Americans in that white allies saying we're going to end

276
00:15:24.411 --> 00:15:26.400
segregation and racism in this country.

277
00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:29.180
You think about the women's movement a hundred years ago,

278
00:15:29.181 --> 00:15:31.370
women in America didn't even have the right to vote.

279
00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:34.050
Think about the gay rights movement. Think about the environmental.

280
00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:39.490
The only way that change takes place is when ordinary people come together and

281
00:15:40.101 --> 00:15:43.430
stand up and fight and say that the status quo is not working.

282
00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:47.440
And that's what I believe and that's what we're trying to do. So with the,

283
00:15:47.441 --> 00:15:51.740
the message of our campaign is it's us, not me,

284
00:15:51.950 --> 00:15:52.671
cause I can't do it alone.

285
00:15:52.671 --> 00:15:55.550
Let me be very honest with you by our elected president tomorrow,

286
00:15:56.090 --> 00:16:00.920
I can't do the things that I would like to do that I'm campaigning on unless

287
00:16:00.921 --> 00:16:05.180
millions of people we're working with me to tell the corporate elite that they

288
00:16:05.181 --> 00:16:09.020
cannot get it all. So how would that be implemented?

289
00:16:09.021 --> 00:16:11.450
Let's say you become president, you've got to become president.

290
00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:13.800
What do you think? I think we're going to shout at it. Guy Shot. All right,

291
00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:18.010
President Bernie. What do you do? You get in there. What do you do? Okay.

292
00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:21.200
First of all, you make a very clear,

293
00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:24.350
you make it clear to the American people what your agenda is.

294
00:16:24.351 --> 00:16:29.351
And I appreciate the opportunity to talk about an agenda and in more than 12

295
00:16:29.571 --> 00:16:31.400
seconds, what does that mean? All right,

296
00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:33.110
we're going to fight for the Medicare for all.

297
00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:36.470
We're going to raise the minimum wage to a living wage.

298
00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:41.480
We are going to deal with education in a profound, profound way.

299
00:16:41.481 --> 00:16:43.640
Cause I worry about what's going on in education today.

300
00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:49.540
Everybody knows that the ages of zero through four are the most important years

301
00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:54.110
for human, intellectual and emotional development, right?

302
00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:55.520
Every psychologist will tell you that.

303
00:16:55.970 --> 00:17:00.410
And yet we have a totally dysfunctional early childhood system. We pay,

304
00:17:00.411 --> 00:17:04.070
we pay out childcare workers, starvation wages,

305
00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:08.390
yet working class families cannot find affordable quality childcare.

306
00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:14.000
You've got to have public school systems all around this country in many of them

307
00:17:14.001 --> 00:17:17.030
really being challenged right now, teaches at run to pay.

308
00:17:17.031 --> 00:17:18.680
Teachers are working two or three jobs.

309
00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:20.870
You've got kids who can't afford to go to college.

310
00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:26.000
And here's something that is just unbelievable. Kids who have gone to college,

311
00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:30.530
leaving school with 50,000, hundred thousand dollars in debt, unbelievable.

312
00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:35.080
These are issues that we have to deal with and I will deal with them. And, uh,

313
00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:39.350
we are gonna substantially improve the quality of education in America.

314
00:17:39.351 --> 00:17:43.670
We're going to cancel student debt by imposing a tax on Wall Street speculation.

315
00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:45.350
All right? So you've gotta deal with education.

316
00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:47.930
You got to deal with climate change. You know,

317
00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:51.620
the truth is that Donald Trump is that wrong. Uh,

318
00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:54.360
climate change is not a hoax. It is a very,

319
00:17:54.361 --> 00:17:57.840
very dangerous reality for our country and the rest of the world.

320
00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:01.950
Scientists tell us we have less than 12 years to transform our energy system

321
00:18:01.951 --> 00:18:06.120
away from fossil fuel or they will be irreparable damage. All right,

322
00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:08.600
so those are in health care of course for all.

323
00:18:08.601 --> 00:18:11.850
So those are some of the major issues. Criminal Justice, immigration reform,

324
00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:13.980
you lay it on the table, you see these,

325
00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:19.190
all the issues that we are going to focus on and you rally the American people

326
00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:22.350
around those issues and you tell people like Mitch McConnell,

327
00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:26.910
who represents a very poor state in Kentucky that Mitch,

328
00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:31.020
if you all going to oppose raising that minimum wage to at least 15 bucks an

329
00:18:31.021 --> 00:18:31.500
hour,

330
00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:35.730
I will be in Kentucky as president of the United States and we're going to have

331
00:18:35.731 --> 00:18:38.700
a rally because you're going to have to stop representing.

332
00:18:38.701 --> 00:18:41.530
And I hope by the way, that Mitch McConnell is not the leader.

333
00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:45.090
I hope the Democrats can gain control over the Senate. But if he is,

334
00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:49.290
we'll put enormous pressure on him to do what the people want. Every idea. Joe,

335
00:18:49.291 --> 00:18:50.490
here's the bottom line. In this thing.

336
00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:52.500
Every idea that I've just talked to you about,

337
00:18:52.530 --> 00:18:54.720
it is supported by a majority of the American people.

338
00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:56.850
These are not radical ideas.

339
00:18:57.470 --> 00:19:00.510
Let's let's take these one step at a time cause you mentioned a lot of important

340
00:19:00.511 --> 00:19:02.490
things there. Let's go with the minimum wage thing.

341
00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:06.120
Now the argument that I've heard about the minimum wage being raised at $15 an

342
00:19:06.121 --> 00:19:09.030
hour is that they're entry level positions for high school kids.

343
00:19:09.031 --> 00:19:12.120
For people that are just getting their feet wet in the marketplace,

344
00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:13.830
they're learning how to work. They're learning,

345
00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:16.830
they're making some money after school that they,

346
00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:21.890
that if you charge or if businesses have to pay $15 an hour to people like that

347
00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:28.290
to entry level people that they won't be able to stay open. Well, first of all,

348
00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:31.470
they will be competing against, you know, if you're a business,

349
00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:35.640
lumber business and both of us have to raise our wages at the same level,

350
00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:39.360
we both have the same burdens. So it's spread across.

351
00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:44.760
That is what my conservative colleagues will tell you. The truth is,

352
00:19:44.761 --> 00:19:47.820
I don't have the numbers right in front of me that while it certainly is true

353
00:19:47.821 --> 00:19:52.710
that young people do work at McDonald's in the minimum wage jobs, uh,

354
00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:57.240
a significant and majority of the workers, [inaudible] kids, they are often,

355
00:19:57.241 --> 00:20:01.290
and I'd met them at McDonald's, uh, they all workers, uh,

356
00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:05.050
who have children themselves. Uh, when we,

357
00:20:05.051 --> 00:20:08.670
we work very hard to raise the minimum wage at Amazon, uh,

358
00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:11.910
and at Disney we put pressure on both of those companies and they did the right

359
00:20:11.911 --> 00:20:15.420
thing. And when you talk to the people that Amazon who got that raise,

360
00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:19.460
these are not kids. These are people in their thirties. These, uh,

361
00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:24.630
these are ordinary adults who cannot make it on 12 or 13 bucks. And I was, so,

362
00:20:24.631 --> 00:20:27.900
I think the argument that all their old kids, uh,

363
00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:32.220
is not really quite accurate. Well, not even that all they're, they're all kids,

364
00:20:32.221 --> 00:20:33.750
but that if they are kids,

365
00:20:33.751 --> 00:20:37.800
what would you think about making a minimum wage for someone who is under 18?

366
00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:41.400
That's different from a minimum wage of someone who's a legal adult? I'm not,

367
00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:44.220
I'm not for that. Uh, I think we do it and,

368
00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:48.040
and look at many of these young people have their own needs.

369
00:20:48.041 --> 00:20:52.310
I just talked to a young woman, um, uh, last night, uh,

370
00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:54.520
who was working, going to college, working full time,

371
00:20:54.521 --> 00:20:57.520
trying to take care of her family as well. So I think, look,

372
00:20:57.521 --> 00:20:59.530
the minimum wage has not been raised in 10 years.

373
00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:04.540
It is now $7 and 25 cents an hour, which is clearly unacceptable. Um,

374
00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:09.430
cost of housing, California, all of this country is rising fairly rapidly.

375
00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:13.090
People can't afford health care. [inaudible] can't afford college.

376
00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:18.610
I don't think it's asking our employers too much to pay at least $15 an hour

377
00:21:18.611 --> 00:21:19.444
minimum wage.

378
00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:22.130
<v 0>No, I'm glad you brought up Amazon. This is one of the,</v>

379
00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:25.540
one of the things that always freaks me out is when I find out that enormous

380
00:21:25.541 --> 00:21:28.690
corporations that make billions of dollars have tax loopholes where they

381
00:21:28.691 --> 00:21:32.890
literally pay no money. How is that possible and how do you stop that?

382
00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:34.940
<v 1>Well, it's the same thing as the drug companies.</v>

383
00:21:34.941 --> 00:21:38.390
How is it possible that we pay 10 times more for insulin in this country?

384
00:21:38.850 --> 00:21:43.250
[inaudible] and for other drugs than the one in Canada or countries around the

385
00:21:43.251 --> 00:21:46.670
world. And the answer is it's power.

386
00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:52.400
So what is, what is the goal of major corporations in America?

387
00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.150
It's the be deregulated as much as possible.

388
00:21:56.151 --> 00:22:00.110
So in some cases they can pollute our water, our air, our environment.

389
00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:05.750
It's also not the panty taxes. [inaudible] Trump campaign, as we recall,

390
00:22:05.751 --> 00:22:09.470
he said, my tax plan is not going to benefit the wealthy.

391
00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:13.040
It's going to benefit working people while turns out over 10 years,

392
00:22:13.370 --> 00:22:16.880
83% of the benefit at the end of 10 years goes to the top 1%.

393
00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:20.720
That's what these guys though I remember on the call,

394
00:22:20.721 --> 00:22:25.310
the ranking member on the budget committee in the Senate and some guy came

395
00:22:25.311 --> 00:22:28.850
forward representing, I don't know, one of the big business organizations.

396
00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:34.190
Uh, and this is their agenda. Their agenda was to cut social security,

397
00:22:34.191 --> 00:22:37.640
Medicare and Medicaid and to do away with old corporate taxes.

398
00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:41.660
So what you have right now, that's, that's what greed is about.

399
00:22:41.661 --> 00:22:43.970
They wanted wall. So as you indicated,

400
00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:48.620
you have a company like Amazon owned by Jeff Bezos who happens to be the

401
00:22:48.621 --> 00:22:51.110
wealthiest guy in America, worth about 150 billion.

402
00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:55.340
Amazon paid zero in federal income taxes, and it's not just him.

403
00:22:55.550 --> 00:22:58.700
Dozens of corporations paid nothing or very, very little.

404
00:22:58.701 --> 00:22:59.840
And on top of all of that,

405
00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:04.220
you got these guys able to stashed all over the world,

406
00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:09.530
trillions of dollars, trillions of dollars in the Cayman Islands,

407
00:23:10.670 --> 00:23:14.060
in Bermuda, in Luxenberg, and of the tax savings. That is insane.

408
00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:16.440
And that has got to end [inaudible]

409
00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:19.840
<v 0>yet. How is it legal to do that? Why is it legal,</v>

410
00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:24.300
<v 1>Joe? It is legal because they make the laws, right? All right.</v>

411
00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:27.650
You know it. That is what he,

412
00:23:27.690 --> 00:23:31.500
you're touching now on the heart and soul of the tragedy of American politics.

413
00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:37.140
How does it happen that on issue after issue, the American people,

414
00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:39.450
the working class of this country wants something.

415
00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:41.190
Nobody pays any attention to it.

416
00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:44.160
But billionaires want something and it gets done.

417
00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:49.520
And that has to do with a corrupt political system. So right now,

418
00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:53.630
if you are a the Koch brothers or some multi-billionaire,

419
00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:57.980
you say to the leadership of the Republican body in some cases to the democratic

420
00:23:57.981 --> 00:23:59.330
money, Hey, guess what?

421
00:23:59.331 --> 00:24:01.550
We're prepared to put hundreds of millions of dollars in the UK,

422
00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:05.810
made hundreds of millions of dollars coming from one or two people.

423
00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:10.160
And here is my agenda. I want tax breaks, I wanna trade system,

424
00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:14.150
which will enable me to shut down in this country and go to China or Mexico and

425
00:24:14.151 --> 00:24:15.770
pay people there. Two bucks an hour.

426
00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:20.090
I want to be able to do more pollution cause on a, I don't like all of this,

427
00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:22.790
you know, money I have to spend preventing uh,

428
00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:26.210
pollution of the air or the water. That's what I want you to do. And by the way,

429
00:24:26.211 --> 00:24:29.420
I'm worried about the deficit. So you may as well cut social security,

430
00:24:29.421 --> 00:24:30.254
Medicare and Medicaid.

431
00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:35.600
How many Americans actually believe that we should give tax breaks to

432
00:24:35.601 --> 00:24:37.880
billionaires and cut social security, Medicare and Medicaid.

433
00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:39.880
Very few that is PR.

434
00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:43.040
Talked to Mitch McConnell get mature on the show is that is exactly what he

435
00:24:43.041 --> 00:24:43.874
believes.

436
00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:45.260
<v 0>But that's ridiculous. Right?</v>

437
00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:49.910
And it seems that if you just took away those tax breaks,

438
00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:54.560
the enormous amount of money that would come from those corporations having to

439
00:24:54.561 --> 00:24:59.000
pay their fair share would take care of lot of the expenses of all these things

440
00:24:59.001 --> 00:25:02.120
that you're proposing. Exactly. How like, okay,

441
00:25:02.121 --> 00:25:07.121
let's talk about the education because the idea of free education is a wonderful

442
00:25:07.341 --> 00:25:08.630
thing for people. Um,

443
00:25:08.660 --> 00:25:13.660
I mean the idea that you get out of college and you're in debt in,

444
00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:18.590
in an insane amount that you might have 10 20 years where you have to pay it

445
00:25:18.591 --> 00:25:19.960
back. And, and I know many people

446
00:25:20.550 --> 00:25:24.730
<v 1>[inaudible] people who are getting their social security checks garnished right</v>

447
00:25:24.731 --> 00:25:28.780
now. It's not 10 to 20 years. In some cases it's a literally a lifetime.

448
00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:33.480
<v 0>Now, a lot of that is mean.</v>

449
00:25:33.570 --> 00:25:36.740
It's got to in some way be preventable by what we're talking about here.

450
00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:39.470
Absolutely. Right. Is that how you would pay for it?

451
00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:41.540
<v 1>I'll tell you exactly how it would pay for it.</v>

452
00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:46.020
And we pay for every idea that we have. We pay for it and we pay for it.

453
00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:49.560
By understanding that today we have massive levels of income and wealth

454
00:25:49.561 --> 00:25:54.060
inequality and we have in many cases the wealthy and large corporations paying

455
00:25:54.330 --> 00:25:58.500
nothing or very little in taxes. Here is the issue in terms of education.

456
00:25:59.730 --> 00:26:03.600
40 50 years ago, you are an average American working class person.

457
00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:08.220
You graduated high school, especially if there was a union around.

458
00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:10.590
You can go out and get a job and make it into the middle class.

459
00:26:10.770 --> 00:26:13.470
You could own your own home, you could send your kids to school.

460
00:26:13.650 --> 00:26:15.570
You lived a pretty good life. I made it in the middle class

461
00:26:17.370 --> 00:26:20.670
40 or 50 years later, there's an explosion of technology.

462
00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:25.700
There's a growth in unfettered free trade and it is clear now that most people

463
00:26:27.511 --> 00:26:30.960
to make it into the middle class are going to need a higher education that's

464
00:26:30.961 --> 00:26:35.961
college or maybe it's technical training in order to become a skilled worker.

465
00:26:38.730 --> 00:26:43.730
It is insane to me to deny working class people in lower income people.

466
00:26:44.911 --> 00:26:48.300
The opportunity to get that education because the cost of college has sought.

467
00:26:48.570 --> 00:26:52.800
So all that I say is that a hundred plus years ago,

468
00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:56.490
the American people said that we should have free public education.

469
00:26:56.520 --> 00:27:00.240
I went to a public school, my parents didn't pay a nickel, went to kindergarten,

470
00:27:00.241 --> 00:27:03.240
I went through the 12th grade. Pretty good education in Brooklyn, New York.

471
00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:08.490
All that I'm saying is the world has changed and high school degree is not good

472
00:27:08.491 --> 00:27:12.630
enough anymore. So expand that concept through college. Now.

473
00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:17.660
Guess what, 50 years ago, do you know how much the University of California,

474
00:27:17.670 --> 00:27:21.600
very great university costs in terms of tuition, how much? Virtually free.

475
00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:25.890
What's it now? I Dunno, but it's pretty high. It is hard.

476
00:27:25.891 --> 00:27:27.240
It's thousands and thousands of nos.

477
00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:31.500
So you had great universities like the University of California, uh, city,

478
00:27:31.501 --> 00:27:33.300
University of New York state colleges,

479
00:27:33.301 --> 00:27:36.420
all of this country where tuition was virtually free.

480
00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:40.260
And then what happened for a variety of political reasons,

481
00:27:40.590 --> 00:27:45.000
states and the federal government started cutting back on higher education and

482
00:27:45.001 --> 00:27:47.820
put more and more burden on the student with higher and higher tuition,

483
00:27:47.910 --> 00:27:48.990
which is where we are today.

484
00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:54.470
So all that I'm saying is in the year 2019 2020 if our working class kids are

485
00:27:55.861 --> 00:27:59.670
going to go out and get the jobs that are out there, they need a,

486
00:28:00.390 --> 00:28:01.950
they need a higher education,

487
00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:06.090
which should be tuition free in terms of the cancellation of debt,

488
00:28:06.091 --> 00:28:10.260
which is my view. You got 45 million people, um,

489
00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:12.810
who are dealing with that. I'll never forget this.

490
00:28:12.811 --> 00:28:15.330
This is where I really hit me. I was in Burlington,

491
00:28:15.331 --> 00:28:18.600
Vermont and I had a meeting on an issue and a young woman comes up and she says,

492
00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:22.110
she's a doctor. She graduated in medical school. She's very happy.

493
00:28:22.111 --> 00:28:25.740
She's practicing community health center, loves what she's doing. He said,

494
00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:29.820
Bernie, I gotta tell you though, I am $300,000 in debt.

495
00:28:30.050 --> 00:28:33.690
Having gone to medical school, I couldn't believe it. I was in Iowa.

496
00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:36.360
A young woman, $400,000 in debt.

497
00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:40.740
This is not unusual for medical schools and dental schools and you know,

498
00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:41.700
ordinary people,

499
00:28:41.701 --> 00:28:44.430
50,000 a hundred thousand dollars we're going to college or are getting a

500
00:28:44.431 --> 00:28:49.260
master's degree. We promise these young people, he said, go to college,

501
00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:52.140
go on and get an education. You'll get decent paying jobs. Well,

502
00:28:52.141 --> 00:28:53.970
the answer is they have not been able to do that.

503
00:28:53.971 --> 00:28:58.971
So what we have proposed in one piece of legislation or to actually is to make

504
00:28:59.311 --> 00:29:01.260
public colleges and universities tuition free,

505
00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:05.370
cancel all student debt in this country that will cost two point $2 trillion,

506
00:29:05.371 --> 00:29:07.320
a lot of money over a 10 year period.

507
00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:11.850
We do this through a tax on Wall Street speculation,

508
00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:14.130
which will bring in two point $4 trillion.

509
00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:17.850
We bailed out Wall Street 11 years ago, and by the way,

510
00:29:17.851 --> 00:29:21.480
these are crooks on Wall Street who engaged in illegal behavior.

511
00:29:21.810 --> 00:29:25.620
Taxpayers against my boat, bailed them out. If we can bail out Wall Street,

512
00:29:25.650 --> 00:29:26.340
you know what?

513
00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:29.970
We can cancel student debt and provide public colleges and universities tuition

514
00:29:29.971 --> 00:29:34.410
free. When you say a tax on Wall Street speculation. W What exactly?

515
00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:37.830
To me it will be a tax on a all of the trends,

516
00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:42.580
every sale of attacks people buy and sell stocks and bonds,

517
00:29:42.581 --> 00:29:43.130
all of them.

518
00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:47.440
We have a very modest tax on it and by the way it will have an impact on

519
00:29:47.441 --> 00:29:50.830
speculation by cutting back on the high frequency trading, which we don't see.

520
00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:54.450
<v 0>So you would just, there is, there's no current tax on direct,</v>

521
00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:58.440
so you would put a small amount and that would do the job.

522
00:29:58.441 --> 00:29:59.160
That would [inaudible]

523
00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:03.410
<v 1>would raise more than enough money. It's a very small tax. It exists a small,</v>

524
00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:06.150
how much? It depends on the nature of the transaction,

525
00:30:06.151 --> 00:30:10.210
but it's less than one half of 1% really? Yeah. [inaudible] yeah,

526
00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:13.560
because the amount of stocks being so broad and so, and this is an under, again,

527
00:30:13.561 --> 00:30:16.650
a new idea. It's being done in countries all over the world.

528
00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:18.930
<v 0>What about the here,</v>

529
00:30:18.931 --> 00:30:21.890
here's one of the darkest things about student loans is that if,

530
00:30:21.970 --> 00:30:26.140
if you go bankrupt it doesn't matter, you still owe that and that.

531
00:30:26.141 --> 00:30:29.340
That's kind of crazy. I mean, if you have like a serious medical issue,

532
00:30:29.341 --> 00:30:33.300
if you're, you're held up, whatever, whatever happens to you, that's awful.

533
00:30:33.450 --> 00:30:37.920
You go bankrupt. Most of those things are resolved, but not student loans.

534
00:30:37.950 --> 00:30:38.630
Right.

535
00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:39.421
<v 1>All right. I mean, again,</v>

536
00:30:39.421 --> 00:30:44.130
this talks to the [inaudible] and that has to do with bankruptcy law,

537
00:30:44.670 --> 00:30:48.720
which was passed against my vote. Uh, and while you were on bankruptcy,

538
00:30:48.870 --> 00:30:50.340
and actually I should've mentioned this before,

539
00:30:50.341 --> 00:30:52.320
when you talk about the healthcare system,

540
00:30:52.890 --> 00:30:57.890
a half a million Americans every single year go bankrupt because of medical

541
00:30:57.901 --> 00:31:00.180
bills that they can't pay. But you're right, with students.

542
00:31:00.210 --> 00:31:03.000
I talked to this guy in Nevada, never will forget it guys. It's Bernie.

543
00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:08.190
You know, I'm all, when my, it guy's in his fifties and he said, you know, I,

544
00:31:08.191 --> 00:31:09.900
I've been paying off my student debt for years.

545
00:31:09.901 --> 00:31:14.190
I'm going nowhere because the interest rates are high and I fear very much,

546
00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:17.910
which is the case that they will start garnishing taking away my social security

547
00:31:17.911 --> 00:31:22.350
checks, taking money away from me. So people are carrying this burden.

548
00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:26.970
The result is that they can't, in many cases,

549
00:31:26.971 --> 00:31:29.430
get married and have kids. They certainly can't buy a home.

550
00:31:29.431 --> 00:31:33.300
They can't buy a car. They are really crushed by this debt.

551
00:31:33.301 --> 00:31:37.170
And what was the crime? What did they do? They tried to get a higher education.

552
00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:38.160
I think that's pretty crazy.

553
00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:41.960
<v 0>And a lot of them, when they do this higher education, they're 18 years old.</v>

554
00:31:42.610 --> 00:31:45.150
Imagine making a decision when your brain isn't even fully formed.

555
00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:48.290
That's gonna Affect you for the rest of your life. You've got it. Exactly right.

556
00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:51.350
And you talk to these kids. So how much debt do you owe? Um,

557
00:31:51.650 --> 00:31:53.750
what kind of interest rates your bank? Gee, I really don't know.

558
00:31:53.751 --> 00:31:57.620
They just told me to sign over here. So right now,

559
00:31:57.860 --> 00:32:02.090
right now we are a week, not even a week out,

560
00:32:02.091 --> 00:32:05.540
just a few days away from two mass shootings in a row.

561
00:32:06.170 --> 00:32:08.600
And whenever these things happen,

562
00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:12.260
there's all these people that want action,

563
00:32:12.290 --> 00:32:15.470
but nobody knows exactly what to do. There's calls for gun control,

564
00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:18.800
there's calls for mental health reform, there's calls for, I mean,

565
00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:24.140
what if anything can be done to stop these things from happening?

566
00:32:24.141 --> 00:32:29.141
And how have you sat down and tried to come up with some sort of a solution and

567
00:32:30.111 --> 00:32:31.130
is there a solution?

568
00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:36.790
<v 1>Look, I would be lying to you if I told you I had a magical answer.</v>

569
00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:43.100
I don't, and this is such a horrific situation. I, you know,

570
00:32:43.101 --> 00:32:45.710
we were in, um, you know, we, we had a town meeting,

571
00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:50.120
we were in Nevada actually in Las Vegas when El Paso happened.

572
00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:53.720
And, uh, we did a town, me and I said, okay,

573
00:32:53.721 --> 00:32:57.800
let's take a moment of silence to remember the victims and pray for the

574
00:32:57.860 --> 00:33:02.570
survivors. Literally the next day and another part of Las Vegas.

575
00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:04.940
I have to do it again. And I said,

576
00:33:04.941 --> 00:33:08.240
I can't believe that just yesterday we did this and I have to do it again.

577
00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:12.590
This is, I, I don't know what the words, you know,

578
00:33:12.690 --> 00:33:15.370
my friend Bedo or rock would say good. You don't know what words, what,

579
00:33:15.371 --> 00:33:17.270
what can you say? It happens again and again,

580
00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:22.660
who can imagine some lunatic walking into a school or a mall or just on a

581
00:33:23.690 --> 00:33:27.170
nightclub area and taken out an assault weapon and shooting down people.

582
00:33:28.490 --> 00:33:30.620
And that we almost become,

583
00:33:30.621 --> 00:33:35.400
to accept this as a normal part of American life is, is incredible. Is,

584
00:33:35.470 --> 00:33:39.950
is, is, is just totally demoralizing art. So here's what I think.

585
00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:43.900
There's no magical answer and, but let me tell you what I think. First of all,

586
00:33:43.930 --> 00:33:48.710
this is the reality. The reality is that today as we speak,

587
00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:52.730
there are approximately 400 million guns in America today.

588
00:33:52.731 --> 00:33:54.080
We have more guns than we have people.

589
00:33:56.150 --> 00:34:00.380
We have between five to 10 million assault weapons.

590
00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:01.820
And an assault weapon, as you know,

591
00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:05.810
is a military style weapon designed to kill human beings kind of rapidly.

592
00:34:05.811 --> 00:34:10.760
So that's, and then on top of that we have, again,

593
00:34:10.761 --> 00:34:12.230
nothing to be proud of, but you know,

594
00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:16.340
we have a number of mentally unstable people, people for whatever reason,

595
00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:20.690
or walk in the streets. This suicidal, homicidal. That's the mix that we have.

596
00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:25.160
I think the answer is, and I'm not the guide who invent all these ideas,

597
00:34:25.161 --> 00:34:27.470
but here's some of what we have to do. First of all,

598
00:34:28.670 --> 00:34:31.580
if you want own a gun in America,

599
00:34:33.140 --> 00:34:37.490
you have got to do, we have got to know that you are a stable person.

600
00:34:37.491 --> 00:34:41.060
And that means that we need to expand, uh,

601
00:34:42.020 --> 00:34:46.460
a the background checks that currently exist. Okay?

602
00:34:46.461 --> 00:34:51.140
So we've got to know, did you beat up your wife, have you committed crimes, uh,

603
00:34:51.170 --> 00:34:55.640
et Cetera, et cetera. What is the state of your mental health? Uh, number two,

604
00:34:55.641 --> 00:34:56.870
we gotta make that universal.

605
00:34:57.560 --> 00:35:02.180
Number two right now that there is a background check.

606
00:35:02.181 --> 00:35:05.630
If you walk into a gun, show it to look into a gun shop,

607
00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:11.200
but you can buy guns in various states at a gun show and you don't have to do

608
00:35:11.421 --> 00:35:14.030
any of that as are you. And I got to a country, you sell me a gun,

609
00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:18.170
I don't have to. And you know, I don't have to do it. Third of all,

610
00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:23.120
I can today legally walk into a gun show, uh,

611
00:35:23.121 --> 00:35:25.550
pass the background check and buy a dozen guns.

612
00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:29.720
Walk out and sell them to criminal elements who will use them for bad things.

613
00:35:31.130 --> 00:35:33.650
So I think those are issues, um,

614
00:35:33.890 --> 00:35:37.920
that most Americans believe we have got to deal with. And we can.

615
00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:42.030
Fourthly, I happen to believe, and I believe this for 30 years,

616
00:35:42.570 --> 00:35:46.080
that we should not be selling or distributing assault weapons in this country.

617
00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:49.530
They are weapons of mass destruction in a sense.

618
00:35:49.531 --> 00:35:52.710
They killed people rapidly as we saw in. And thank God by the way,

619
00:35:52.830 --> 00:35:56.760
when we talk about both Dayton and El Paso, thank God cops were there very,

620
00:35:56.761 --> 00:35:59.260
very quickly and did an incredible job for.

621
00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:01.170
So that guy had walked into the nightclub,

622
00:36:01.350 --> 00:36:06.030
there could have been dozens and dozens more people killed in it within a few

623
00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:10.200
minutes time. Um, I happen to believe a,

624
00:36:10.201 --> 00:36:14.760
that we should not be selling or distributing assault weapons in this country.

625
00:36:14.850 --> 00:36:17.430
That's my deal, period. Uh,

626
00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:20.250
so I believe in a ban on assault weapons and I think we have got to begin

627
00:36:20.251 --> 00:36:24.330
thinking about when we have five to 10 million assault weapons,

628
00:36:24.331 --> 00:36:26.280
which is more than the u s military has.

629
00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:31.880
We have to think about a strong licensing procedure in terms of who owns these

630
00:36:32.251 --> 00:36:36.930
assault women. So that's some of what I think there are many other things,

631
00:36:36.931 --> 00:36:38.580
but those are some of the ideas that are out there

632
00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:39.411
<v 0>now.</v>

633
00:36:39.411 --> 00:36:44.411
The legal gun owners who are law abiding citizens who would never in a million

634
00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:47.780
years think about going around shooting people, but they love guns.

635
00:36:48.050 --> 00:36:51.680
They hear this kind of stuff about like banning assault rifles,

636
00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:55.100
banning assault weapons. They don't even like the term assault weapons, right?

637
00:36:55.230 --> 00:36:58.310
They like to refer to them as their individual names for whatever they are.

638
00:36:59.030 --> 00:37:04.030
These people feel like this is an inexorable part of being an American,

639
00:37:04.701 --> 00:37:08.750
that you should be able to own a gun. It's written into our bill of rights.

640
00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:13.730
It's written into our, the way we way this country was founded,

641
00:37:13.731 --> 00:37:17.450
it's the second amendment. What do you say to those people that don't,

642
00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:20.990
that don't want to give up their guns but they wouldn't do and they want to

643
00:37:20.991 --> 00:37:21.860
protect themselves.

644
00:37:21.890 --> 00:37:26.510
They feel like these guns are viable options to protect themselves from

645
00:37:26.511 --> 00:37:27.344
criminal.

646
00:37:28.130 --> 00:37:31.100
<v 1>I understand that. And Joe, you may know him,</v>

647
00:37:31.101 --> 00:37:34.160
a senator from the state of Vermont and the state of Vermont is one of the most

648
00:37:34.161 --> 00:37:35.570
rural states in America.

649
00:37:35.660 --> 00:37:39.140
Every fall we had a whole thousands and thousands of people are out in the woods

650
00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:42.900
hunting. And it's something that's part of our tradition. I believe in it.

651
00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:47.450
I believe in the second amendment, but all that I ask of the governance,

652
00:37:47.570 --> 00:37:51.710
and you're absolutely right, 99.9% of gun owners would never in a million,

653
00:37:51.711 --> 00:37:53.840
billion years think of doing these horrible things.

654
00:37:55.010 --> 00:37:58.640
But in the moment that we are living in, uh,

655
00:37:59.150 --> 00:38:04.150
I think that we're all going to have to make some concessions to the reality of

656
00:38:04.671 --> 00:38:07.910
what is going on. And that is that there is a small number of,

657
00:38:08.570 --> 00:38:12.200
call them what you want to pray for people who are prepared to do that.

658
00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:16.700
You know, in Australia, you remember that terrible. A New Zealand, I'm sorry,

659
00:38:17.110 --> 00:38:21.560
the terrible shooting at the mosque and they moved pretty quickly, uh,

660
00:38:21.590 --> 00:38:26.340
in an aggressive way. So, you know, I wish I can say in, in,

661
00:38:26.341 --> 00:38:29.510
in the best of all possible worlds. Yeah. You know,

662
00:38:29.511 --> 00:38:32.000
you could own any weapon you want and so forth. And son,

663
00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:34.520
we're not living in the best of all possible worlds.

664
00:38:34.521 --> 00:38:36.010
We're living in a world where

665
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:39.340
<v 0>we're shocked every day by our own. So I agree.</v>

666
00:38:39.341 --> 00:38:41.500
We are living in a terrible situation. I mean,

667
00:38:41.501 --> 00:38:45.700
there's hundreds of mass shootings a year now, which is insane.

668
00:38:45.701 --> 00:38:48.340
And if you look at the number in comparison to the rest of the world,

669
00:38:48.610 --> 00:38:50.920
it's crazy. Like a big one in another country,

670
00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:55.450
like three mass shootings in a year. We had more than 270. It's,

671
00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:59.410
it's crazy. But how would you implement something like this?

672
00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:00.090
<v 1>Well,</v>

673
00:39:00.090 --> 00:39:05.090
the idea of banning assault weapons has been done in 1994.

674
00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:11.130
We've manned assault weapons. Uh, I believe, I believe it was for 10 years. Uh,

675
00:39:11.131 --> 00:39:15.510
that ban was undone by Republican majority. Uh,

676
00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:18.150
and it didn't, you know, I'm not suggesting,

677
00:39:18.151 --> 00:39:21.350
by the way that anything here that the few banned assault weapons tomorrow,

678
00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:22.800
that would radically change everything.

679
00:39:22.801 --> 00:39:26.820
But we have got to do the best that we can do. And again,

680
00:39:26.821 --> 00:39:29.790
I preface my remarks by telling you I don't have a magical solution.

681
00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:32.190
You've got hundreds of millions of guns out there.

682
00:39:32.191 --> 00:39:36.120
You have people who should not be owning these guns, who gets set off by God,

683
00:39:36.121 --> 00:39:39.000
knows what and and do terrible things.

684
00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:41.730
All we can do is the best that we could do.

685
00:39:41.731 --> 00:39:46.650
But to say we can't do anything I think is a real disservice to the American.

686
00:39:46.651 --> 00:39:50.510
And I'll tell you something else that bothers me. You know,

687
00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:55.550
in addition to the horror of seeing people lying on the street dead is what this

688
00:39:55.891 --> 00:39:58.950
is doing to the children of this country. And I think we underestimate that.

689
00:39:59.190 --> 00:40:04.080
I have seven grandchildren and and for them and for kids,

690
00:40:04.081 --> 00:40:06.690
all of this country, you're going to see the falls coming.

691
00:40:06.691 --> 00:40:09.780
Kids coming back to school, you're going to see in schools all over America,

692
00:40:09.781 --> 00:40:13.980
drills, art. This is what you do if somebody walks into the school, all right,

693
00:40:13.981 --> 00:40:17.640
you're going to hide under here. You go over there. Kids I,

694
00:40:17.641 --> 00:40:21.180
a couple of months ago, I was in Iowa, this guy, he's about six foot,

695
00:40:21.181 --> 00:40:25.470
two big guy, probably a football player. And he says, Senator Sanders,

696
00:40:25.471 --> 00:40:29.880
I gotta tell you that the young people in my school are increasingly frightened,

697
00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:34.440
terrified about what could happen in the school. Think about what this,

698
00:40:34.441 --> 00:40:37.800
the trauma, the trauma of,

699
00:40:37.890 --> 00:40:41.700
of what this gun violence is doing. So I think we're all as Americans,

700
00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:43.830
they ain't no easy answers here,

701
00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:47.520
but they were all going to have to come together and figured this one out and do

702
00:40:47.521 --> 00:40:48.354
the best that weekend.

703
00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:53.560
<v 0>Now would that mean forcibly removing these guns from people's homes?</v>

704
00:40:55.490 --> 00:40:58.150
<v 1>You gotta have the FBI knocking on somebody's doors and taking them.</v>

705
00:40:58.170 --> 00:40:59.350
That's not what we do in America.

706
00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:03.800
<v 0>You have 400 million guns already out there building more every year.</v>

707
00:41:03.801 --> 00:41:05.060
Right now as we speak,

708
00:41:05.090 --> 00:41:08.810
gun manufacturers or make money manufacturers are making more guns.

709
00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:11.590
This is happening right now. So if those guns already exist,

710
00:41:11.710 --> 00:41:14.240
there's more than enough. Oh yeah. How would you stop?

711
00:41:15.310 --> 00:41:18.420
<v 1>Well, again, I think, look, you know,</v>

712
00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:20.740
I do think there should be a ban on assault weapons.

713
00:41:20.741 --> 00:41:24.310
So that means that manufacturers would not be able to produce or sell those

714
00:41:24.311 --> 00:41:25.144
weapons per year

715
00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:27.890
<v 0>to American citizens, but not to the military obviously. Right?</v>

716
00:41:27.980 --> 00:41:30.650
<v 1>Obviously. Yeah. Okay. So you know,</v>

717
00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:34.670
and your point is well taken if you've got 4 million guns out there, you know,

718
00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:39.560
so I, I think there are approaches, no one has any magical solution,

719
00:41:39.561 --> 00:41:40.510
but I'd given you a,

720
00:41:40.511 --> 00:41:44.090
I'll tell you something else that I didn't mention and that is the role of gun

721
00:41:44.091 --> 00:41:49.091
manufacturers is that if you are a gun manufacturer and you are selling a hell

722
00:41:50.481 --> 00:41:53.990
of a lot of guns to a gun store in an area,

723
00:41:53.991 --> 00:41:56.900
which normally you would not think, I mean these guys know,

724
00:41:57.330 --> 00:42:00.740
you know what cities by what towns, by comedy guns.

725
00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:04.520
And if suddenly there is a tremendous demand,

726
00:42:05.190 --> 00:42:07.230
you've got to be thinking and be why is,

727
00:42:07.310 --> 00:42:09.380
why is this gun store buying so many guns?

728
00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:11.810
It doesn't reflect the population in the area.

729
00:42:12.100 --> 00:42:14.180
You've gotta deal with that issue with a gun owner's going to have to take some

730
00:42:14.181 --> 00:42:18.530
responsibility besides the guns. The gun manufacturers, I'm sure. Right?

731
00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:21.150
<v 0>The, besides the guns, the gun manufacturers,</v>

732
00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:23.970
the other gigantic issue is mental health.

733
00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:29.180
The only way any of this ever happens is someone has to be insanely mentally

734
00:42:29.191 --> 00:42:30.780
depraved. This the only way,

735
00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:36.200
and many of them are Medicaid and many of them are on pharmaceutical drugs and

736
00:42:37.131 --> 00:42:39.000
they have been since they were children,

737
00:42:39.001 --> 00:42:44.001
including amphetamines like Adderall and Prozac and all this different stuff

738
00:42:44.431 --> 00:42:48.090
that has varied effects on the human brain.

739
00:42:48.510 --> 00:42:52.530
What could be done? What would you done to analyze this?

740
00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:56.480
To find out what the cause and effect are and to try to figure out what role,

741
00:42:56.670 --> 00:43:00.480
what role and how much these drugs are responsible.

742
00:43:01.230 --> 00:43:04.440
<v 1>Okay, well two things. Let me response respond first by saying,</v>

743
00:43:04.441 --> 00:43:07.770
it goes without saying that we have a mental health crisis in America before we

744
00:43:07.771 --> 00:43:12.720
even talk about jokes and for whatever reason, um,

745
00:43:12.810 --> 00:43:13.200
you know,

746
00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:16.470
there are a whole lot of people in the nature of our healthcare system.

747
00:43:16.471 --> 00:43:21.000
Getting back to healthcare is, I just talked to a woman literally last night,

748
00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:27.720
um, and we had a town meeting and she said,

749
00:43:27.721 --> 00:43:31.200
this is unbelievable. She said, Bernie,

750
00:43:31.201 --> 00:43:36.000
I was in Las Vegas when the terrible shooting took place. Okay,

751
00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:39.720
and now I am, and I can understand this perfectly.

752
00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:42.630
I'm seeing Dayton and I'm seeing watching television,

753
00:43:42.631 --> 00:43:47.210
El Paso and I'm getting a p t p s PTSD reaction. All right,

754
00:43:47.820 --> 00:43:48.570
that's totally under.

755
00:43:48.570 --> 00:43:51.900
If you were in a place where people were shut down and actually I'm trying to

756
00:43:51.901 --> 00:43:56.400
get counseling, I can't find it. I remember a guy called up,

757
00:43:56.460 --> 00:44:00.300
a woman called at my office in Burlington, Vermont and she said,

758
00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:06.060
I'm worried about my husband, what he, my brother was his brother,

759
00:44:06.210 --> 00:44:08.370
what he might do to himself with somebody else.

760
00:44:08.550 --> 00:44:10.050
We're looking for mental health counseling.

761
00:44:10.051 --> 00:44:11.640
We can't find something that we can afford.

762
00:44:12.450 --> 00:44:15.690
So we need above and beyond gun violence.

763
00:44:16.410 --> 00:44:21.270
We need an, it's why I believe in Medicare for all mental health is healthcare.

764
00:44:21.330 --> 00:44:24.360
You break your arm, that's a health issue. That's a medical issue.

765
00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:29.640
Mental health is a medical issue and we have got to make mental health

766
00:44:29.641 --> 00:44:34.080
counseling available. All people in this country when they need it,

767
00:44:34.110 --> 00:44:37.770
not six months from now at a price they can afford and under Medicare for all

768
00:44:37.790 --> 00:44:42.220
would be free. So that's number one. Number two, your point about, uh,

769
00:44:42.270 --> 00:44:47.270
studying the impact of drugs on people's behavior and possibly resulting in

770
00:44:48.991 --> 00:44:51.480
violence absolutely deserves to be studied.

771
00:44:51.481 --> 00:44:56.400
We should be studying the impact of drugs. In my view, this is a layman's view.

772
00:44:56.430 --> 00:44:57.690
You know, I'm not a psychiatrist.

773
00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:03.320
I worry very much that we are over medicating kids in schools.

774
00:45:04.290 --> 00:45:08.200
You know, we have this uh, deficit, the deficient issue. You know,

775
00:45:08.250 --> 00:45:11.220
kids are running around in their act of, you know, when I was a kid,

776
00:45:11.221 --> 00:45:13.500
people used the runaround Labor Act. If you know what they wasn't,

777
00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:16.680
they weren't drugged up. So I worry about that whole business.

778
00:45:16.681 --> 00:45:17.910
But your point is well taken.

779
00:45:17.911 --> 00:45:22.200
I think we need to study this issue and make sure that these drugs in fact are

780
00:45:22.201 --> 00:45:25.500
not causing kinds of reactions that we will regret later.

781
00:45:26.810 --> 00:45:28.200
<v 0>No. On the subject of drugs,</v>

782
00:45:28.230 --> 00:45:32.310
marijuana is obviously a big issue in this country and we've seen many states

783
00:45:32.311 --> 00:45:34.920
make it recreational, including this one.

784
00:45:35.010 --> 00:45:40.010
What do you think could be done and what should be done to have this across the

785
00:45:40.081 --> 00:45:41.850
board, especially federally? You know,

786
00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:45.150
there's a guy that I have on the podcast coming up soon. His name's John Norris,

787
00:45:45.151 --> 00:45:50.151
and he wrote a book on the cartels growing marijuana illegally all over this

788
00:45:50.611 --> 00:45:52.080
country and selling it,

789
00:45:52.110 --> 00:45:55.230
especially particularly in California now because it's a misdemeanor because

790
00:45:55.231 --> 00:46:00.150
it's legal recreationally and selling it with all sorts of horrible pesticides

791
00:46:00.151 --> 00:46:04.440
on it. All sorts of like very, in fact, deadly chemicals.

792
00:46:04.830 --> 00:46:07.980
All of this, because it's not federally legal,

793
00:46:07.981 --> 00:46:12.900
because we can have sanctioned licensed companies doing an ethical job of

794
00:46:12.901 --> 00:46:17.190
growing something than any responsible law abiding person should be able to

795
00:46:17.191 --> 00:46:18.024
consume.

796
00:46:18.820 --> 00:46:21.910
<v 1>Okay. Um, let me say this.</v>

797
00:46:22.420 --> 00:46:27.420
When I ran for president for the Democratic nomination in 2016 I talked about a

798
00:46:28.871 --> 00:46:30.850
broken criminal justice system,

799
00:46:31.660 --> 00:46:36.100
which ends up having in the United States more people in jail than any other

800
00:46:36.101 --> 00:46:37.840
country. We have more people in jail than China does,

801
00:46:37.841 --> 00:46:39.880
which is a communist authoritarian country.

802
00:46:41.380 --> 00:46:46.380
And what I called for then and I call for now is the legalization of marijuana

803
00:46:50.111 --> 00:46:52.360
in America right now, you have a federal law.

804
00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:57.070
It's called the controlled substance act. He has heroin. Here is marijuana.

805
00:46:57.400 --> 00:47:00.640
They're at the same level. That is insane. Heroin is a killer drug.

806
00:47:00.880 --> 00:47:05.050
You can argue the pluses and minuses of marijuana, but marijuana ain't heroin,

807
00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:07.180
so we have to end that and that's what I will do.

808
00:47:07.510 --> 00:47:08.530
This president of the United States,

809
00:47:08.531 --> 00:47:11.110
I believe we can do that through executive order and I will do that.

810
00:47:12.070 --> 00:47:16.480
Second of all, what we have now is number of states, and I'm very proud.

811
00:47:16.481 --> 00:47:20.020
I talked about during 2016 what seemed kind of radical,

812
00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:22.730
the need to legalize the decriminalized marijuana,

813
00:47:22.731 --> 00:47:24.520
a very radical idea four years ago.

814
00:47:24.521 --> 00:47:28.540
It is spreading all over the country and pied the way it blows my mind to drive

815
00:47:28.541 --> 00:47:31.210
through Nevada. Think here even in California, you'll see signs.

816
00:47:31.450 --> 00:47:35.560
Corporations buy our marijuana. Yeah. If four years ago people getting arrested,

817
00:47:35.790 --> 00:47:38.090
you're doing that, right? Their lives being destroyed. Oh,

818
00:47:38.150 --> 00:47:41.240
<v 0>particularly in Nevada. There was life sentences given out in the 70s.</v>

819
00:47:41.390 --> 00:47:42.110
<v 1>Can you believe that?</v>

820
00:47:42.110 --> 00:47:45.080
And now you have corporation selling the damn product that people went to jail

821
00:47:45.081 --> 00:47:49.340
for. Um, so I think ultimately in a,

822
00:47:49.341 --> 00:47:51.650
we've got to legalize marijuana.

823
00:47:51.651 --> 00:47:54.440
And what's good news in a sense is some communities,

824
00:47:54.441 --> 00:47:59.260
some cities are expunging the records. So if you were arrested, uh,

825
00:47:59.510 --> 00:48:03.020
have a criminal record for selling marijuana, that is being expunction,

826
00:48:03.021 --> 00:48:04.600
that is the right thing to do. You know,

827
00:48:04.601 --> 00:48:08.510
we can argue about the pluses and minuses. I'm not a great fan of, of drugs.

828
00:48:08.511 --> 00:48:11.420
Other people, you know, I smoked marijuana a couple of times.

829
00:48:11.870 --> 00:48:12.740
Didn't do much for me.

830
00:48:12.741 --> 00:48:15.140
Other people I guess have different interests a couple of times.

831
00:48:15.230 --> 00:48:18.180
That's certainly true. It didn't do much for you. Yeah. Maybe Craig getting it.

832
00:48:19.170 --> 00:48:21.260
I was in Vermont, northern Vermont. That's the problem.

833
00:48:21.261 --> 00:48:25.490
Maybe I'll do something for you. Well, make me cough a whole lot. All right.

834
00:48:25.491 --> 00:48:28.670
But I got the other people have had different experiences for sure. Yeah,

835
00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:30.620
I'm certainly have. Um,

836
00:48:30.810 --> 00:48:35.810
<v 0>well the other problem is of course with illegal drugs comes you get this</v>

837
00:48:37.230 --> 00:48:38.490
horrible cycle,

838
00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:43.940
particularly in inner cities where you have people that are incarcerated for

839
00:48:44.251 --> 00:48:47.220
illegal drugs, illegal drugs seem to be the only way out.

840
00:48:47.550 --> 00:48:50.760
The hard drugs when we're talking about cocaine and all these other drugs,

841
00:48:50.940 --> 00:48:53.370
how does one stop that?

842
00:48:53.371 --> 00:48:58.371
And would you ever consider legalizing all drugs or decriminalizing all drugs?

843
00:48:59.780 --> 00:49:04.330
<v 1>No, I wouldn't. Uh, but you're touching on a real tragedy. Yes.</v>

844
00:49:04.510 --> 00:49:09.510
And when we talk about criminal justice in America,

845
00:49:09.521 --> 00:49:11.470
we have over 2 million people in jail.

846
00:49:11.650 --> 00:49:15.040
They are disproportionately African American, Latino, and native American.

847
00:49:16.330 --> 00:49:19.690
And here's what I think. I think in the wealthiest country,

848
00:49:20.350 --> 00:49:23.680
in the history of the world, what we have got to do,

849
00:49:23.681 --> 00:49:27.040
instead of building more jails and locking up more people,

850
00:49:27.250 --> 00:49:30.010
we really do have to invest in our young people,

851
00:49:30.011 --> 00:49:33.310
especially young people in distressed communities. What does that mean?

852
00:49:34.210 --> 00:49:38.050
If we can, and we can do this with a proper amount of resources,

853
00:49:38.051 --> 00:49:40.000
make sure the kids are not dropping out of school.

854
00:49:40.270 --> 00:49:42.760
If you drop out of school today, you know,

855
00:49:42.761 --> 00:49:45.250
say you drop out in u s second or third year of high school,

856
00:49:45.251 --> 00:49:47.500
you don't have an education, you don't have any job skills.

857
00:49:47.710 --> 00:49:51.190
What are you gonna do with your life? And the answer is you may well do drugs,

858
00:49:51.460 --> 00:49:54.790
you know, or you'll get in trouble. Self destructive activity,

859
00:49:55.090 --> 00:49:56.890
destructive activity, you gonna end up in jail.

860
00:49:57.310 --> 00:50:00.640
It makes so much more sense from a humane perspective,

861
00:50:01.450 --> 00:50:04.600
protecting our people as well as the financial situation.

862
00:50:04.680 --> 00:50:07.990
We spend that $80 billion yet to invest in these kids. What does it mean?

863
00:50:08.410 --> 00:50:11.140
It means making sure that they get the education that they need.

864
00:50:11.141 --> 00:50:12.820
Paying attention, having good schools,

865
00:50:13.540 --> 00:50:17.170
making sure that they get the jobs that are out there doing job training.

866
00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:20.440
There was a principal in a school in southern Vermont,

867
00:50:20.470 --> 00:50:23.440
I'll never forget what she said. It was a working class school. And she said,

868
00:50:23.740 --> 00:50:26.410
Bernie, I love these kids. I am not gonna let them drop out.

869
00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:31.490
And she had a mentoring program just watching the kids who were mostly at risk

870
00:50:32.390 --> 00:50:34.200
so that they would not end up, uh,

871
00:50:34.700 --> 00:50:36.830
going through the cracks and getting into trouble.

872
00:50:37.010 --> 00:50:39.320
That's what we should be doing as a nation. And when we do that,

873
00:50:39.321 --> 00:50:42.320
we invest in the kids, we get them jobs, we're going to education.

874
00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:46.700
The likelihood is the likelihood of them falling into bad ways is significantly

875
00:50:46.701 --> 00:50:47.480
reduced.

876
00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:48.700
<v 0>The, all those things sound great.</v>

877
00:50:49.090 --> 00:50:53.110
The uncomfortable reality about drugs though is that when drugs are illegal,

878
00:50:53.111 --> 00:50:54.010
criminal seldom,

879
00:50:54.220 --> 00:50:58.090
and there's obviously a need for drugs in terms of not necessarily a need,

880
00:50:58.091 --> 00:51:02.770
but a demand for drugs is a demand for trucks in this country that's absolutely

881
00:51:02.771 --> 00:51:07.420
fueling Mexican cartels and illegal drug runners inside this country.

882
00:51:07.450 --> 00:51:11.800
I mean there's, there's a lot of that. How do you, how do you curb that?

883
00:51:12.130 --> 00:51:14.230
If drugs are illegal, boy,

884
00:51:16.030 --> 00:51:18.930
you're raising a deep question. Yes. All right. So the question is send

885
00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:24.080
<v 1>truly that you're asking is what is the cause of the opioid epidemic?</v>

886
00:51:24.110 --> 00:51:24.920
Yes.

887
00:51:24.920 --> 00:51:26.660
<v 0>That's one. That's one aspect of it. But,</v>

888
00:51:26.661 --> 00:51:29.960
but the opioid epidemic is interesting because there's so much of it that's

889
00:51:29.961 --> 00:51:33.080
coming legally. Right? That's not the drug cartels.

890
00:51:33.081 --> 00:51:37.190
That's the pharmaceutical industry. Right. But the heroin is illegal. Yes.

891
00:51:37.470 --> 00:51:38.020
Right. Alright.

892
00:51:38.020 --> 00:51:41.050
<v 1>Now you're asking, this is a very, very deep question,</v>

893
00:51:41.140 --> 00:51:42.970
which we don't talk about terribly much.

894
00:51:44.590 --> 00:51:49.590
Why is it that so many of our people are turning to drugs to alcohol,

895
00:51:50.920 --> 00:51:53.590
by the way, and I don't mean a drink a night,

896
00:51:53.591 --> 00:51:58.591
but I mean serious alcohol problems and tragically to suicide,

897
00:52:00.190 --> 00:52:02.560
we now have for the last three years,

898
00:52:03.370 --> 00:52:08.110
something that is a historical never happened before in modern history.

899
00:52:08.140 --> 00:52:10.870
And that is our life expectancies actually going down.

900
00:52:11.950 --> 00:52:13.930
And this is hitting all over the country,

901
00:52:13.931 --> 00:52:15.700
but it is especially hitting rural areas.

902
00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:20.500
And what the doctors are saying is that these are diseases of despair,

903
00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:23.740
despair. So you're in West Virginia,

904
00:52:24.130 --> 00:52:27.790
here in rural Ohio or any place for month, any place.

905
00:52:29.470 --> 00:52:33.580
And the job you used to have earning a decent living is now in China.

906
00:52:35.140 --> 00:52:38.770
Your kid can't afford to go to college. Maybe you can't afford healthcare.

907
00:52:40.120 --> 00:52:44.950
You've got nothing to look forward to under that scenario.

908
00:52:45.610 --> 00:52:48.520
Drugs become alcohol becomes a way out.

909
00:52:48.950 --> 00:52:51.460
And that the worst case scenario is suicide.

910
00:52:52.090 --> 00:52:57.090
So I think what we're talking about is why is this happening as often in rural

911
00:52:57.161 --> 00:53:00.490
areas and urban as well? And how can we,

912
00:53:01.240 --> 00:53:06.040
how can we reestablish hope and optimism in the American people?

913
00:53:06.850 --> 00:53:11.080
And that gets back to a whole lot of other issues. It means if people have,

914
00:53:11.630 --> 00:53:14.470
healthcare is a right, that will certainly play a role in this thing.

915
00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:16.090
They walk into the doctor when they need,

916
00:53:16.420 --> 00:53:21.420
but it also means that people need decent jobs that pay them a living wage.

917
00:53:23.020 --> 00:53:25.180
That means we have to rebuild rural America.

918
00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:28.980
We have to rebuild a depress communities in urban America.

919
00:53:29.010 --> 00:53:34.010
It means that we have to have a great educational system and people say,

920
00:53:34.381 --> 00:53:37.140
oh, that's great Bernie. That's utopian. It is not utopian.

921
00:53:37.530 --> 00:53:40.410
This is something that in the wealthiest country, in the history of the world,

922
00:53:40.411 --> 00:53:43.740
we can afford and we should be doing rather than giving, uh,

923
00:53:43.770 --> 00:53:46.950
creating a situation where Amazon pay zero in federal income taxes.

924
00:53:47.130 --> 00:53:49.680
So to answer your question, there's a deep question and again,

925
00:53:49.681 --> 00:53:51.900
I'm not here to tell Ya, I have all the answers,

926
00:53:52.380 --> 00:53:55.530
but there are a lot of people out there who have basically given up hope.

927
00:53:55.980 --> 00:53:59.040
And for those people, I guess drugs is the alternative.

928
00:53:59.170 --> 00:54:03.340
<v 0>So what you're saying essentially is that if we can do something to mitigate</v>

929
00:54:03.341 --> 00:54:04.174
despair,

930
00:54:04.210 --> 00:54:09.060
then we'll do something to at least stop some of the demand for these,

931
00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:09.780
these elite,

932
00:54:09.780 --> 00:54:12.270
<v 1>I believe that is the case. Look, if I am optimistic,</v>

933
00:54:12.300 --> 00:54:15.660
if I'm excited about going to work tomorrow and I'm seeing my kid doing great in

934
00:54:15.661 --> 00:54:17.160
school, and you know,

935
00:54:17.161 --> 00:54:20.400
when I get sick I can go to the doctor's office that have a sense of community.

936
00:54:20.401 --> 00:54:24.660
My downtown is not all bordered up because businesses have left. But we have a,

937
00:54:24.920 --> 00:54:26.490
we have a community. Yeah. The light,

938
00:54:26.491 --> 00:54:31.150
the strong likelihood is there will be less diseases of despair and drugs, uh,

939
00:54:31.270 --> 00:54:32.490
than we currently see.

940
00:54:32.950 --> 00:54:37.950
<v 0>Now when we're talking about impoverished communities and chronically when,</v>

941
00:54:38.101 --> 00:54:43.101
when you're talking about cities like Baltimore or parts of Chicago and Detroit

942
00:54:43.391 --> 00:54:47.380
that have just been in a terrible state of despair for long periods of time,

943
00:54:47.381 --> 00:54:50.680
and it doesn't seem like there's a way out that people that are born there,

944
00:54:50.950 --> 00:54:55.720
the people that live there, they live in this state of, of despair.

945
00:54:55.930 --> 00:54:56.291
What,

946
00:54:56.291 --> 00:55:01.291
what can be done to resolve all of these terribly impoverished communities and

947
00:55:01.751 --> 00:55:05.080
bring them up to a standard where these kids that grow up there,

948
00:55:05.560 --> 00:55:08.530
that they feel like there is an out, that they do have an opportunity.

949
00:55:08.680 --> 00:55:13.120
And why is this not addressed when we talk about making America great?

950
00:55:13.630 --> 00:55:17.980
Wouldn't like fixing the worst parts of the country, be the primary concern.

951
00:55:18.500 --> 00:55:18.700
The,

952
00:55:18.700 --> 00:55:23.700
the less people that grow up in a terribly disadvantaging position from birth

953
00:55:24.880 --> 00:55:28.330
would not be an important thing. And what can you do to resolve that?

954
00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:31.430
<v 1>Well, Joel, I think you, you know, you said it better than I can.</v>

955
00:55:31.460 --> 00:55:32.690
I think you're right. You know,

956
00:55:32.691 --> 00:55:36.620
when we talk about what it means to live in a great society,

957
00:55:36.680 --> 00:55:38.630
a great nation and nation that we're proud of,

958
00:55:39.320 --> 00:55:43.680
I'm afraid there are some people who have incredible wealth and powers.

959
00:55:43.681 --> 00:55:46.940
So you know what's great is that we're seeing a growth in the number of

960
00:55:46.941 --> 00:55:48.950
billionaires in America. Isn't that terrific?

961
00:55:49.240 --> 00:55:53.810
And we've got one guy who was worth $155 billion. How great. Oh, by the way,

962
00:55:54.050 --> 00:55:59.050
we're building one nuclear weapons and we're spending $750 billion a year on the

963
00:55:59.931 --> 00:56:02.630
military. Isn't that extraordinary? And by the way,

964
00:56:02.631 --> 00:56:06.080
you see the yacht that that billionaire has, you know, it's three miles long.

965
00:56:06.110 --> 00:56:08.960
Isn't that great? Your point is that we have to,

966
00:56:08.961 --> 00:56:10.460
I think as I understand what you're saying,

967
00:56:11.090 --> 00:56:14.300
we have to redefine what being a great nation is about.

968
00:56:14.900 --> 00:56:19.900
We are not a great nation when we have 40 million people living in poverty and

969
00:56:20.420 --> 00:56:22.970
in despair. We're not a great nation.

970
00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:25.390
We have massive levels of income and wealth inequality.

971
00:56:25.391 --> 00:56:28.510
When 87 million people can afford to go to a doctor today.

972
00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:30.610
So Dancy your question.

973
00:56:30.730 --> 00:56:35.730
I think that as a nation we have got to focus a great deal of attention on those

974
00:56:36.490 --> 00:56:40.480
distressed communities. Often they're African American, often they're Latino,

975
00:56:40.481 --> 00:56:42.790
often they are rural white communities.

976
00:56:43.450 --> 00:56:46.450
And that means making sure that the kids,

977
00:56:46.600 --> 00:56:49.420
they get the quality education that they deserve.

978
00:56:49.900 --> 00:56:53.890
Making sure that we're creating good paying jobs in those communities.

979
00:56:54.580 --> 00:56:56.740
I voted against NAFTA,

980
00:56:57.610 --> 00:57:01.240
permanent normal trade relations with China and other trade agreements because I

981
00:57:01.241 --> 00:57:05.770
knew that those agreements were written by corporate America with the goal of

982
00:57:05.771 --> 00:57:08.290
shutting down plants in this country and moving abroad.

983
00:57:08.620 --> 00:57:12.640
And the result of that has been the loss of millions of good paying jobs and the

984
00:57:13.030 --> 00:57:13.271
thick,

985
00:57:13.271 --> 00:57:17.530
complete destruction of communities all across this country in the south and all

986
00:57:17.531 --> 00:57:21.670
across this country. So we have got to rebuild those communities.

987
00:57:22.390 --> 00:57:27.140
We have got to bring high tech jobs, not just to silicon valley, uh,

988
00:57:27.250 --> 00:57:30.280
but to rural America. Again, I don't have magical answers,

989
00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:33.610
but the goal is we will not under a Sanders administration,

990
00:57:33.790 --> 00:57:37.870
turn our backs on distressed communities. We will rebuild those committees.

991
00:57:37.960 --> 00:57:42.310
We will build the millions of units of affordable housing that we need. Now.

992
00:57:42.311 --> 00:57:45.850
Think about what it means to a community now where people are living in terrible

993
00:57:45.851 --> 00:57:48.040
housing or housing they cannot afford.

994
00:57:48.340 --> 00:57:52.720
When we put young people to work rebuilding their own communities,

995
00:57:52.840 --> 00:57:57.490
will that become a an indication of hope and optimism? I think it will.

996
00:57:58.200 --> 00:58:03.200
<v 0>We're talking about so many deeply important issues and all them that will be</v>

997
00:58:03.420 --> 00:58:07.980
under the control or at least to the direction of the one person who winds up

998
00:58:07.981 --> 00:58:12.930
becoming the president of United States. Is it an impossible job?

999
00:58:13.200 --> 00:58:15.180
I mean it seems like being the president,

1000
00:58:15.181 --> 00:58:20.181
you are managing so many different aspects of our economy,

1001
00:58:20.700 --> 00:58:24.060
our culture, our safety, our environment,

1002
00:58:24.630 --> 00:58:28.440
international communication, and it's so,

1003
00:58:28.650 --> 00:58:31.780
it's so in depth. How does one person do a job like,

1004
00:58:32.120 --> 00:58:32.361
<v 1>well,</v>

1005
00:58:32.361 --> 00:58:36.230
one person doesn't do it and you certainly don't do it by tweeting every other

1006
00:58:36.231 --> 00:58:39.320
day. Major policy issues. I think he tweets a lot more than every other.

1007
00:58:41.480 --> 00:58:46.250
You know what you do, and this is the way any sane president operates,

1008
00:58:46.370 --> 00:58:51.370
is you need to be working with the smartest men and women from all walks of life

1009
00:58:52.310 --> 00:58:54.770
who understand these issues. Every issue we have touched on,

1010
00:58:54.771 --> 00:58:58.040
Joe is enormously complicated. And I can send out a, you know,

1011
00:58:58.100 --> 00:59:02.390
20 word tweet on it, but that doesn't solve it. So unlike Trump, you know,

1012
00:59:02.391 --> 00:59:05.290
we will bring together, uh,

1013
00:59:05.540 --> 00:59:09.710
the best and most knowledgeable people in this country to address the housing

1014
00:59:09.711 --> 00:59:14.690
crisis to address the issue of, of these diseases of despair.

1015
00:59:15.200 --> 00:59:17.570
We didn't even touch on climate change, uh, you know,

1016
00:59:17.571 --> 00:59:18.710
and then the future of the planet.

1017
00:59:18.711 --> 00:59:22.730
How do we lead the world and transforming our energy system and creating the

1018
00:59:22.731 --> 00:59:23.780
kind of jobs that we need?

1019
00:59:23.780 --> 00:59:27.950
How do we revitalize American democracy so that instead of suppressing the vote,

1020
00:59:28.070 --> 00:59:30.140
we're getting more young people involved in the political process.

1021
00:59:30.410 --> 00:59:31.221
So to answer your question,

1022
00:59:31.221 --> 00:59:34.190
it is not a one person job and anyone that thinks it is, is that wrong.

1023
00:59:34.880 --> 00:59:39.650
You need the help of a very strong administration that knows the issues that

1024
00:59:39.651 --> 00:59:42.710
comes from the ranks of the working class. And this is the promise I will make.

1025
00:59:43.570 --> 00:59:45.110
Heart-Mind administration, unlike Trump's,

1026
00:59:45.830 --> 00:59:49.190
is not going to be filled with billionaires whose, you know,

1027
00:59:49.191 --> 00:59:53.360
basically a very often greedy type people who it is going to be filled with the

1028
00:59:53.361 --> 00:59:57.230
best people, often from the working class itself, from the trade union movement,

1029
00:59:57.650 --> 01:00:01.760
people who are gonna help us create policies that work for workers and not just

1030
01:00:01.930 --> 01:00:02.810
the, the billionaire class.

1031
01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:05.690
<v 0>Now we're getting to the end of your hour here.</v>

1032
01:00:05.691 --> 01:00:09.380
So climate change is obviously an enormous issue for our country and for the

1033
01:00:09.381 --> 01:00:10.370
world. What,

1034
01:00:10.430 --> 01:00:14.720
what could be done and what do you think you can do as president that can

1035
01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:19.040
somehow or another slow down this, this process?

1036
01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:24.550
<v 1>Well, first of all, we have to have a president who, unlike Trump, uh,</v>

1037
01:00:25.250 --> 01:00:26.270
beliefs in science than I do.

1038
01:00:28.100 --> 01:00:32.030
And what the scientists are telling us, as I mentioned earlier,

1039
01:00:32.060 --> 01:00:35.690
is that we have fewer than 12 years to transform our energy system or else there

1040
01:00:35.820 --> 01:00:40.790
will be irreparable damage done to our country. But to the world now,

1041
01:00:40.791 --> 01:00:44.510
climate change is not just an American issue. So we could do tomorrow,

1042
01:00:44.570 --> 01:00:45.860
do all the right things,

1043
01:00:45.861 --> 01:00:50.060
but if China and Russia and India and the rest of the Brazil and Africa does not

1044
01:00:50.061 --> 01:00:52.640
do the right thing, you know, we're not going to make the progress we need.

1045
01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:56.930
So here is what we have to do in my view. Number one,

1046
01:00:56.990 --> 01:01:01.990
we have to tell the fossil fuel industry that they are short term profits and

1047
01:01:02.541 --> 01:01:04.070
they make a whole lot of money.

1048
01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:09.020
They're short term profits are not more important than the future of this

1049
01:01:09.021 --> 01:01:11.690
planet. I don't think that's a hard sell to make.

1050
01:01:11.870 --> 01:01:16.640
You cannot keep producing a product which is destroying the planet in the United

1051
01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:17.473
States and around the world.

1052
01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:19.350
<v 0>So by saying that, you're saying you would have to move a,</v>

1053
01:01:19.351 --> 01:01:23.130
we would have to move consciously away absent fossil fuels. No.

1054
01:01:23.131 --> 01:01:27.690
If so Butson maybe if we do that, how do you tell the fossil fuel companies,

1055
01:01:27.900 --> 01:01:30.210
do you tell them you can't sell fossil fuels anymore?

1056
01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:32.120
There are a variety of ways to do that, but that is the, the

1057
01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:35.390
<v 1>bottom line. And, and by the way, in the midst of that,</v>

1058
01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:39.230
we do what we call is a, um,

1059
01:01:39.460 --> 01:01:41.120
a just transition.

1060
01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:46.580
The guy out on the oil rig today simply wants to feed his family and the coal

1061
01:01:46.581 --> 01:01:50.480
miners today want to feed their families and we're not gonna leave them.

1062
01:01:50.510 --> 01:01:51.470
I'm a pro worker.

1063
01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:55.040
I have the probably the strongest bro Worker record of any member of the

1064
01:01:55.041 --> 01:01:55.480
congress.

1065
01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:59.000
So that is not my intention to throw these guys out on the and women out on the

1066
01:01:59.001 --> 01:02:01.700
street and ignore the pain that they will go through.

1067
01:02:02.090 --> 01:02:06.590
We are proposing billions of dollars to rebuild those communities and make sure

1068
01:02:06.591 --> 01:02:08.960
that those guys and women get new jobs.

1069
01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:12.050
So we're not just discarding people in the fossil fuel industry,

1070
01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:14.840
but ultimately the product that they are producing,

1071
01:02:14.841 --> 01:02:17.360
which is now carbon emissions, is destroying the planet.

1072
01:02:17.870 --> 01:02:22.870
So we have to move away from fossil fuels in a very bold way into energy

1073
01:02:23.731 --> 01:02:28.440
efficiency. Right now in my own state of Vermont and all over this country,

1074
01:02:28.441 --> 01:02:32.700
there are buildings which are incredibly wasteful.

1075
01:02:32.730 --> 01:02:34.980
We don't have the windows, we don't know the installation.

1076
01:02:34.981 --> 01:02:35.850
We don't have the roofing,

1077
01:02:35.851 --> 01:02:40.851
the doors that we need to keep the buildings warm in the winter and cool in the

1078
01:02:42.150 --> 01:02:46.020
summer and we can create just a, an incredible number of jobs,

1079
01:02:46.290 --> 01:02:49.920
just retrofitting of buildings. Second of all, uh,

1080
01:02:49.921 --> 01:02:52.600
we need to move very aggressively, uh,

1081
01:02:52.620 --> 01:02:55.800
to sustainable energies like wind and solar in California.

1082
01:02:55.850 --> 01:02:59.940
You doing a good job with wind. I was doing good job, Texas doing a good job.

1083
01:03:00.020 --> 01:03:02.460
We've got to do much more solar.

1084
01:03:02.461 --> 01:03:04.580
There is incredible potential out there at prices.

1085
01:03:04.590 --> 01:03:09.420
Solar has dropped in recent years and we have got to not only transform the

1086
01:03:09.421 --> 01:03:10.710
energy system and our own country,

1087
01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:15.840
we got to lead the world in working with Russia and China because in this issue

1088
01:03:16.051 --> 01:03:19.140
we are in it together. And here's my dream and baby,

1089
01:03:19.290 --> 01:03:20.820
this may be a utopian dream.

1090
01:03:21.330 --> 01:03:24.870
The world right now is spending a trillion and a half dollars on weapons of

1091
01:03:24.871 --> 01:03:26.430
destruction designed to kill each other.

1092
01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.130
And maybe just maybe if we had a kind of elite,

1093
01:03:29.380 --> 01:03:32.070
and I hope to be that leader who says to the world,

1094
01:03:32.071 --> 01:03:34.620
instead of spending a trillion and a half dollars killing each other,

1095
01:03:35.010 --> 01:03:39.930
maybe we use those resources to transform the global energy system and save the

1096
01:03:39.931 --> 01:03:42.600
planet for our kids and our grandchildren. That's the goal that I have.

1097
01:03:42.750 --> 01:03:44.400
<v 0>Well, these, these ideas sound great,</v>

1098
01:03:44.401 --> 01:03:47.010
but in the competitive environment of global politics,

1099
01:03:47.011 --> 01:03:50.970
how would you convince Russia or China or any of these countries to do something

1100
01:03:50.971 --> 01:03:54.660
that would put them in some sort of a competitive disadvantage?

1101
01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:57.610
<v 1>Well, and the answer is, Joe,</v>

1102
01:03:57.670 --> 01:04:00.280
if we do not do that in 50 a hundred years,

1103
01:04:00.281 --> 01:04:03.730
everybody's going to be terrible dissident. And look, I'm not, you know,

1104
01:04:03.731 --> 01:04:06.280
I'm saying that, I'm not telling you that tomorrow what's going to happen,

1105
01:04:06.730 --> 01:04:10.510
but you got to make the case. These people, you know, Putin is a dictator.

1106
01:04:10.511 --> 01:04:14.820
I disliked him intensely. You know, Ci in China, very authoritarian self on top,

1107
01:04:14.821 --> 01:04:15.940
but they're not crazy people.

1108
01:04:16.510 --> 01:04:19.540
And presumably they have concerned about their kids and their grandchildren.

1109
01:04:19.990 --> 01:04:22.270
This is a planet under siege. You know,

1110
01:04:22.271 --> 01:04:23.620
I don't want to become a science fiction.

1111
01:04:23.830 --> 01:04:26.680
You've all seen the movies in the media racing toward earth.

1112
01:04:26.810 --> 01:04:29.590
We got blow up the earth. What do we do? Well, we gotta get together.

1113
01:04:29.770 --> 01:04:34.210
This is in a sense what that is about it you don't want to think about in 1941,

1114
01:04:35.860 --> 01:04:37.630
uh, after Pearl Harbor, all right,

1115
01:04:38.290 --> 01:04:43.000
we were faced with a war in the east with China, a war in the west,

1116
01:04:43.300 --> 01:04:46.600
in Europe with Hitler. Within two years,

1117
01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:50.470
the United States had transformed its economy to address.

1118
01:04:50.830 --> 01:04:53.920
And when the war basically in two or three years by re industrializing comer,

1119
01:04:54.070 --> 01:04:56.920
we can do it. We can lead the world. That's what we have to do.

1120
01:04:57.090 --> 01:04:58.380
<v 0>So in your eyes,</v>

1121
01:04:58.410 --> 01:05:01.680
we have to look at the economy almost as if the same kind of threat,

1122
01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:04.920
or excuse me, the environment has, if it's the same kind of threat,

1123
01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:06.720
is Nazi German and act together.

1124
01:05:06.970 --> 01:05:10.110
<v 1>Look, if you asked the Defense Department, you asked the CIA,</v>

1125
01:05:10.111 --> 01:05:11.860
you asked the defense people all over the world,

1126
01:05:11.861 --> 01:05:14.530
tell us what the great national security threat is. You know what it is?

1127
01:05:14.620 --> 01:05:15.460
It is climate change.

1128
01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:18.500
<v 0>There's a lot of people though that are of this, how would you convince them?</v>

1129
01:05:18.501 --> 01:05:20.520
I mean, this is a big part of the problem, right? There's,

1130
01:05:20.660 --> 01:05:24.370
there's a narrative that you hear from a lot of people that, oh, you know,

1131
01:05:24.371 --> 01:05:27.910
climate change is not approved, proven science and climate change is a hoax.

1132
01:05:27.911 --> 01:05:31.330
And I mean, this is something that's repeated over and over again. And um,

1133
01:05:31.390 --> 01:05:36.070
I'm sure some of it has to do with lobbyists and some of it has to do with the

1134
01:05:36.071 --> 01:05:40.570
merchants of doubt that go out there and see the world with disinformation to

1135
01:05:40.571 --> 01:05:44.380
try to increase their profits and continue the practices that they're currently

1136
01:05:44.381 --> 01:05:45.214
enjoying.

1137
01:05:45.430 --> 01:05:45.641
<v 1>You know,</v>

1138
01:05:45.641 --> 01:05:50.410
Joe and I'm thinking back and I don't know if all of you listeners can remember

1139
01:05:50.411 --> 01:05:51.490
this cause molder the most,

1140
01:05:51.491 --> 01:05:56.050
but I can remember tobacco and cigarette ads on television moment. Yes,

1141
01:05:56.800 --> 01:06:00.190
Dr. Guy Dressed in a white frock smoking away. This is a great cigarette.

1142
01:06:00.191 --> 01:06:01.720
It'll improve your health. They lied.

1143
01:06:02.140 --> 01:06:04.210
The tobacco industry knew exactly what was going on.

1144
01:06:04.450 --> 01:06:06.520
And the fossil fuel industry is lying right now.

1145
01:06:06.670 --> 01:06:10.660
And the president of the United States is either too stupid to understand what

1146
01:06:10.661 --> 01:06:14.740
the scientists are telling us or he is lying as well. Climate should look,

1147
01:06:15.460 --> 01:06:19.180
I am not the scientists. This is not my idea. I listen to the scientists.

1148
01:06:19.510 --> 01:06:23.650
The debate is long over climate change is real. My God,

1149
01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:26.320
look at what's happening around the world. Say the worst. You know,

1150
01:06:26.321 --> 01:06:30.940
July was I think the warmest July or warmest month in the modern history of the

1151
01:06:30.941 --> 01:06:35.290
world. Uh, the, the audit ice is melting, uh,

1152
01:06:35.291 --> 01:06:39.880
heat waves in Europe. All right? Just look out the window at what's going on.

1153
01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:45.310
Uh, so this is not Bernie Sanders talking. This is the scientific community.

1154
01:06:45.640 --> 01:06:48.520
Climate change is real.

1155
01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:53.260
It will only get worse if we do not act boldly to cut carbon emissions.

1156
01:06:54.900 --> 01:06:56.340
<v 0>Well we just did an hour, sir.</v>

1157
01:06:56.370 --> 01:06:59.460
So I'm gonna let you go cause I know you've got very important things to do.

1158
01:06:59.461 --> 01:07:00.360
One last question.

1159
01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:05.460
If you got into the office and you found out something about aliens,

1160
01:07:06.330 --> 01:07:08.910
if you found out something about UFO, would you let us know?

1161
01:07:09.990 --> 01:07:10.640
<v 1>Well, I'll tell you,</v>

1162
01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:14.480
my wife would demand that I let you know as your wife a UFO nut. Now,

1163
01:07:14.481 --> 01:07:17.060
she's not a UFO nut, which is Burdick. What is going on?

1164
01:07:17.061 --> 01:07:20.340
Do you have any access to records and you don't have any access? I don't,

1165
01:07:20.390 --> 01:07:23.160
honestly. I don't know. Okay. You let us know though. All right.

1166
01:07:23.161 --> 01:07:26.990
I'll be [inaudible] the show. How's it? Alright, thank you, sir.

1167
01:07:26.991 --> 01:07:29.120
I appreciate your time. So thank you very much.

1168
01:07:36.740 --> 01:07:36.740
<v 2>[inaudible].</v>
