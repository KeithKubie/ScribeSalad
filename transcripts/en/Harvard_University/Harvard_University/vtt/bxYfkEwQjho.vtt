00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.879
I was born in the rural western part of Kenya

00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:10.270
I'm the youngest in my family, a family of 14

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.729
I'm from Cincinnati Ohio

00:00:13.729 --> 00:00:17.150
Also my mother's children's book writer and
illustrator

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:22.570
and my dad's an architect so I was always surrounded
by a illustrations graphics 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.669
I've been teaching ballet for fifteen years and

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:28.829
we've been doing things naturally

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:29.999
I essentially came

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:31.539
came here too

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:33.160
focus on the indigenous women

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.350
of the border lands.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.019
so I grew up in China

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:40.350
in Shenyang which is the center of Manchuria

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.990
which used to be the capital city of China 
at the beginning of the Ching Dynasty. well I'm originally

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:46.560
from India

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:47.610
and 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.060
right after high school I went to medical
school in India

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.820
which was just sort of a natural progression
because my parents

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.410
are doctors, my sisters a doctor, so it was
sort of like the only profession that I knew

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.819
about

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:59.650
my interest is in

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:03.070
how different cultures and different religions

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:04.510
vary in their views on

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.390
different moral ethical issues such as the
use of force, conduct of war, conflict resolution

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.980
especially as the current wars that
we are in now there's a lot of complexities and 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:14.409
ambiguities 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:16.980
which I experienced while I was in the military and thought

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.700
maybe we can better prepare

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.020
soldiers on the ground and sailors and airmen

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.100
and I started doing a lot of research and

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.400
Harvard Divinity school and great both because

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.130
it addresses not just Judeo-Christian ethics
but

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.630
a whole range of religious ethics

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.130
it allowed me with the flexible

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.810
curriculum to the design my own course of interest

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.750
and study as I please the way I felt best
to shape what I wanted to do.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.689
I didnâ€™t really think about college 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:47.029
that much until it really just

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:48.450
came and then

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.560
at some point I guess I had to apply to college and so I 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.900
so I

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.570
was kind of stunned when I was accepted but

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.619
one of the first classes that I took, in fact one of the first things I did when I came here 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:04.490
we went to an interview for 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.659
a freshman seminar in

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.879
medieval books of ours

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.669
it was there that I first realized that aside
from

00:02:11.669 --> 00:02:15.819
just my own interest in taking books
and forming them to be the way I wanted
 
0:02:15.819,0:02:18.569
there is an academic discipline where you
could do that

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:22.130
and so I found my way in a kind of cross over
between

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:23.709
art history and book history

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:25.390
I think I tried to

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.780
 or found that out in a  really broader way
by taking

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:29.400
history and

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.320
and

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.469
history of the book and political philosophy

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:37.229
and tons of literature I really loved literature
and then a lot of art history

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:39.799
which has just been absolutely magnificent.

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:45.059
Actually, I had never heard of Harvard 
until junior high school

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:49.109
I ever even know that I was even going to come to the US

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.229
when I was in high school I thought I was going to graduate and go

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:57.549
work for my dad in a firm  or go to a university, 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:01.579
a local university. But then when I was in junior high school 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:05.529
I started reading some Journals that my teacher would bring to school

00:03:05.529 --> 00:03:10.199
I was seeing all these cutting edge research, most of them were done here at Harvard

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:11.719
and I said wow,

00:03:11.719 --> 00:03:15.649
this is an amazing institution and I met
these Harvard alumns 

00:03:15.649 --> 00:03:19.369
and they say, yeah you are from this really tiny school
in Kenya

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:21.430
no one knows, and you should

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.309
definitely try applying to Harvard.

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:26.059
And I was just applying saying oh yeah

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:28.109
I have no

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:32.709
chance but luckily a got into Harvard
and I was really amazed.

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:34.330
One of the highlights I think

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.120
was in the spring of

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.499
'07

00:03:37.499 --> 00:03:39.499
that divinity school

00:03:39.499 --> 00:03:41.940
supported me in putting together the first

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.359
panel of

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:45.839
indigenous peoples speaking on their

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:46.909
spirituality

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:50.949
which it was the first time that Harvard had recognized
indigenous spirituality as a legitimate

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:53.179
region

00:03:53.179 --> 00:03:58.249
so it was pretty monumental and historic and I realize
that this was more than just 

00:03:58.249 --> 00:04:00.759
you know I really needed to bring

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:05.199
my home, my heart to this community and I couldn't just, you know

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:09.180
be a Harvard student, I always needed to carry
home with. You know what I mean?

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.739
and to represent my peoples and my ancestors.
I had an epiphany  in class the other day

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:16.150
as a result of a grant application that

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.889
that I did for the final project for arts
and education

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:21.440
in which my initial 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.319
desire was to create

00:04:22.319 --> 00:04:25.110
an outreach program that was centered on
ballet

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.539
and through

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:29.960
discussions in the arts and ed. program
about the various intrinsic values of all arts

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:30.720
for kids

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.409
it made me reflect on the true value of dance,
what dance does for children.

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:39.570
and the actual impact it has on kids because I've
always done it

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.119
because of what I see

00:04:41.119 --> 00:04:45.529
in them and now with the readings that I've
been doing and the conversations I've been

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:46.449
having and the

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:48.270
classes I've been taking I can see

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.669
it really is valid and it really is a very
important thing for kids to,

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:53.460
for kids to be exposed to

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.169
actually Harvard was the only school I applied to.

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:00.389
and the same thing with music, Berklee was the only school I applied to

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:03.819
in some ways I was lucky, but at the same time

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:08.079
I was actually helping  a friend of mine
sort of figure out his application and

00:05:08.079 --> 00:05:11.460
things like that and I sort of bumped into the public
school and then

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.699
felt like the public health care management and policy program
was really up my street

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:19.660
and so that sort of lead me to the Reynolds fellowship at the Kennedy school here

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.750
at Harvard

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:23.550
which really enabled me 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.099
the pursue the masters in public health

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:27.529
at the school of public health.

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:29.639
In China there are

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:31.529
six disciplines

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:35.180
to develop persons in the physical
and the

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:38.159
mental dimensions

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:39.460
Li: propriety

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.849
you have music

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:43.129
archery

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:45.689
charioting

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:47.539
history

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:48.960
mathematics

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.069
so basically

00:05:50.069 --> 00:05:53.069
I think this has been exercised over 

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:57.800
many thousands of years and there is a certain
wisdom to 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.149
the liberal arts education, and I just think

00:06:00.149 --> 00:06:02.550
Harvard does a fantastic job in that

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:05.629
as a major in mathematics and physics

00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:07.889
I was able to learn

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:12.330
classical music class western classical music

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:12.830
and

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:17.560
I was able to take some courses in economics
and which eventually got me interested in

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:18.660
going to

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:21.289
graduate school for a PHD in

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:22.820
finance and economics.

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:25.870
so I'm looking at further schooling,
the Kennedy school

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:28.189
the law school, applied to a couple fellowships

00:06:28.189 --> 00:06:32.689
so we will see what happens, Harvard again, if they'll have me

00:06:32.689 --> 00:06:33.779
this year I did

00:06:33.779 --> 00:06:37.389
I did all of my research and that lead to

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:40.400
exhibit was really one of the nicest events that I've done here

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.630
and I was so moved by how many
people came I couldn't believe that all these

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:47.550
people who I really admire and care out
and

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:51.270
who really shaped my course here

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:56.090
but they all just came there because I sent them an email, and that was just overwhelming

00:06:56.090 --> 00:07:01.960
I've had some really amazing amazing classes
that I've taken a very broad range

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:05.970
if you've gone through the education program
here if you've got get a master's at

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:11.110
Harvard it opens so many doors and I've
made so many valuable connections just in

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:12.360
my short time here.

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:16.999
a lot of my colleagues and friends they're
going into the Ministry you know to the pulpit

00:07:16.999 --> 00:07:18.129
my ministry and

00:07:18.129 --> 00:07:20.089
my medicine I think

00:07:20.089 --> 00:07:22.629
are in the birthing rooms, as a midwife.

00:07:22.629 --> 00:07:25.240
you know we see so many

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:29.289
priest, pastors, religious figures at weddings
and funerals but

00:07:29.289 --> 00:07:33.240
they don't seem to be hanging out in the birthing
room so I feel that that's

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:34.889
the moment where

00:07:34.889 --> 00:07:38.539
the angels are so I need to be there.

00:07:38.539 --> 00:07:42.629
something that I would like to take away with me that I've got from Harvard 

00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:43.619
is the fact that

00:07:43.619 --> 00:07:47.839
you can't live in your own island you have to cooperate and live with others

00:07:47.839 --> 00:07:49.059
and team work

00:07:49.059 --> 00:07:50.880
and that type of stuff

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:52.629
that has built me as an individual

00:07:52.629 --> 00:07:54.860
If it's one word I think it's leadership

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:59.520
I think it's the expertise, the confidence
and it's the resources

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:00.729
to really lead

00:08:00.729 --> 00:08:03.250
and to really  believe in what I do because

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:07.180
you know before this of course I had a very persuasive argument
in terms of music and medicine

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:11.210
because I'm a physician and I also have training in music therapy

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:14.249
but then you know having the knowledge and expertise
about strategy and

00:08:14.249 --> 00:08:18.740
and sustainability and scalability and issues
like that I think it's it's really about leadership

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:20.159
that's what I'm really taking

00:08:20.159 --> 00:08:21.179
out of Harvard

00:08:21.179 --> 00:08:23.020
I wouldn't be as happy

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:26.289
or I wouldn't be able to achieve as much

00:08:26.289 --> 00:08:27.429
without the help

00:08:27.429 --> 00:08:30.419
from my professors from my friends

00:08:30.419 --> 00:08:31.539
so I every time

00:08:31.539 --> 00:08:35.560
when on I was able to achieve something

00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:39.070
I always try to take a moment

00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:43.870
to reflect on the fact that

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:46.340
this is not my achievement, it's the achievement

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:48.800
of all the people within my life

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:49.520
my circle.
