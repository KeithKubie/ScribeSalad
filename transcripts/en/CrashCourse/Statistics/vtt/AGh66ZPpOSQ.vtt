00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.280
Hi, I’m Adriene Hill, and welcome back to
Crash Course Statistics.

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:10.879
In the last episode we dove into the logic
surrounding test statistics and talked about

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:15.660
a general formula that allows us to create
them for lots different situations.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.630
There are so many questions we might want to answer, and it would be rough if we had

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.430
to memorize a new formula for EVERY Single One.

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.130
And sometimes Statistics is taught in a way that makes it seem like there’s a different

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.790
formula you need to know if you want to test whether your bus is late more often than the

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:33.800
average bus in your town.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.460
Or if burns treated with aloe heal faster
than those that are left alone.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.960
But! Hah-zah.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.940
We can adapt the general formula...in all
sorts of situations.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:53.000
INTRO

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.340
Let’s say that you just moved to a new place, and you’re looking for the BEST coffee in town.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.680
Since you’ve been watching Crash Course
Statistics, you decide to do a little impromptu experiment.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.580
Word on the street is there are two really
popular coffee places near you, Caf-fiend

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:07.600
and The Blend Den.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.570
So one Sunday after brunch, you grab a random sample of 16 of your new friends, and randomly

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.469
give half of them an unmarked cup with coffee from Caf-fiend, and the other half an unmarked

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:20.829
cup with coffee from The Blend Den.

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:24.520
You made sure to get the same roast--dark--to keep things as even as possible.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:30.560
After delicate sniffs and sips of coffee in
a process known as “cupping”, the tallies are in.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.360
On a scale of 1 to 10, Caf-fiend got a mean
score of 7.6 and The Blend Den got a mean

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.189
score of 7.9

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.270
So we observe a difference between the coffee scores.

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.359
Coffee from Caf-fiend scored 0.3 points lower than Coffee from The Blend Den.

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:48.149
So coffee from The Blend Den is better?

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:48.880
Right?

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:49.700
Done and done.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.140
Nope not yet.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.520
Maybe it’s just random chance.

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.159
So first we need to define our null.

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:58.549
There’s no difference between the two coffee shops.

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:02.010
And then our alternative hypothesis, that
there is a difference.

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:03.399
One is better than the other.

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:08.030
In this case, we’re interested in whether
the mean scores for coffee are different between

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.039
Caf-fiend and The Blend Den.

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.250
With a little algebra, we can see that this
is the same thing as asking whether the difference

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.250
between the two means is not zero.

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.370
Now that we have our hypotheses, we can do a t-test.

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:25.570
Specifically, we’ll do a two sample t-test,
also called an independent or unpaired t-test.

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:30.560
The formula for a two sample t-test follows
our general test statistic formula:

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.140
The difference we observed is 0.3.

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.190
If the null hypothesis were true and there’s
no difference between the coffee shops, we’d

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:38.840
expect a difference of 0.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.840
So the numerator of our t-test is 0.3.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.110
For this kind of t-test, our measure of average variation is the standard error.

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.130
For two groups, the standard error is calculated a bit differently since we have to account

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.710
for the sample variance of two groups.

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:59.400
Here, we’re squaring the standard deviation
to get the variance and n1 and n2 are the

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.960
sizes of the two groups--both are 8 here.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.530
Now that we have our t-value, we can figure
out if there’s a statistically significant

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.970
difference between the two coffee shops and there are two ways to do this.

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:16.430
We can calculate the critical t-value and
if our t-statistic is GREATER than the critical

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.690
value we reject the null hypothesis.

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:25.420
Or we can calculate the p-value from our t-statistic and we can reject the null hypothesis if the

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.560
p-value is SMALLER than our chosen alpha level.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.220
To do either of these things, we’ll need
to choose our alpha level.

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.090
Again, our alpha is arbitrary.

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:39.200
But usually people will use 0.05 since that
means that in the long run, only 5% of tests

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.310
done on groups with no real difference will
incorrectly reject the null.

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.090
So, we’ll conform :) and use an alpha of
0.05 here.

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:53.590
To calculate our critical t-value we need
to find the t-values which correspond to the

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.410
top 5% most extreme values in our t-distribution.

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.410
Usually a computer or a calculator will do
this for you, so we won’t go into the formula,

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:03.720
but here are the cutoffs:

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:10.650
The cutoffs for our specific problem are about -2.145 and 2.145.

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.740
We have two cutoffs because we’re doing
a two tailed test.

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:20.160
We want to reject the null if coffee from
Caf-fiend is better or if coffee from The

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.160
Blend Den is better.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.530
We can already tell that we should fail to
reject the null.

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.590
That there’s no clear difference between
the quality of the coffee.

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:33.790
Our t-statistic of about 0.44 is isn’t close
to -2.145 OR 2.145.

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.380
The critical value and p-value approach will
give you identical results, so we don’t

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.000
really need to do both.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:46.140
But for the sake of showing we get the same outcome…our calculated p-value is 0.6684.

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:51.890
We reject the null if the p-value is smaller
than alpha, so again we fail to reject since

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:56.180
0.6684 is WAY bigger than 0.05.

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.210
One thing that’s nice about the p-value
approach, and the reason we’ll mainly rely

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:05.040
on it throughout the rest of these examples, is that p-values are easier for us non-computers

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.040
to interpret.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:12.700
A p-value of 0.6684 means that if there were NO difference in scores between coffee from

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:17.770
Caf-fiend and coffee from The Blend Den, we’d still expect to see a difference in our sample

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.250
means that’s 0.3 or greater pretty often...

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.370
66.84% of the time.

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:29.400
Since our observed difference of 0.3 or greater is pretty common under the null hypothesis,

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.780
we haven’t found evidence that it’s a
bad fit.

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.370
That’s why we failed to reject it.

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:38.480
So right now we don’t have any evidence
that one coffee shop is better than the other.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:43.090
But remember, absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:48.280
And while our coffee excursion and experiment were well designed, we can probably improve it.

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.960
If you look at the scores that your friends
gave the coffees, you’ll see that there’s

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:56.300
one person who tried coffee from Caf-fiend
and really hated it.

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:59.060
After looking through your scorecards, you
realize it’s Alex , who has mentioned in

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.150
the past that she just doesn’t love coffee.

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:03.440
Which gets you thinking.

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:07.640
Even though you randomly assigned your friends to get either coffee from Caf-fiend or coffee

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:12.460
from The Blend Den, that design didn’t account for the fact that some people just like coffee

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:14.020
more than others.

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:19.330
Alex might give the best coffee in the world
a measly 6 point rating just because...coffee’s

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:20.400
not really her thing.

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.270
Whereas your always caffeinated friend Cameron would probably give that day old coffee in

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:27.630
the breakroom a score of 7 just because he
loves coffee.

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:31.960
So in addition to any true difference in scores between coffee from Caf-fiend and coffee from

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:38.240
The Blend Den, our sample means are also affected by how much the people in each group like coffee.

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.480
You randomly assigned your friends to groups, so you don’t expect that there’s some

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:46.560
systematic difference between the average
coffee enjoyment of the groups.

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:51.490
But random assignment adds variation, which can make it harder to see a true difference

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:52.949
between the coffee scores.

00:06:52.949 --> 00:06:55.980
One solution to this issue is a paired t-test.

00:06:55.980 --> 00:07:00.760
You could try to pair up your friends based
on how much they like coffee and then randomly

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:05.080
assign one to coffee from Caf-fiend and the other to coffee from The Blend Den, and repeat

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:07.730
this over and over until everyone had been
assigned.

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:10.699
The best match, of course, for a person is
themselves.

00:07:10.699 --> 00:07:12.310
I’m just like me.

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:15.580
So you decide to call another random sample of 16 of your friends.

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:20.639
This time you give all of them both Caf-fiend coffee AND The Blend Den coffee and they record

00:07:20.639 --> 00:07:21.639
their scores.

00:07:21.639 --> 00:07:25.240
Now that everyone has scored both coffees, you can be sure that the two groups have the

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:30.300
exact same level of “coffee affinity”
since it’s the exact same people.

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:35.651
The mean scores are still affected by variation due to individual coffee preferences, but

00:07:35.651 --> 00:07:41.060
since the exact same people are in both groups, we can extract that variation and “throw

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:42.139
it away” so to speak.

00:07:42.139 --> 00:07:46.610
One way to do this, is to make a difference
score for each person.

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:51.540
This will tell you how much more they like
coffee from Caf-fiend than coffee from The Blend Den.

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:57.600
Now that we have only one list of values--the difference scores--our matched pairs t-test

00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:01.780
will look surprisingly similar to the one
sample t-test that we’ve seen before.

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:07.350
We observed a mean difference (Caf-fiend - The Blend Den) of -0.18125, which means that on

00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:14.640
average, people rated coffee The Blend Den
0.18125 points higher than coffee from Caf-fiend.

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:18.930
The null hypothesis here is that there’s
no difference between ratings for coffee from

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:24.340
Caf-fiend and coffee The Blend Den, so we’d expect our mean difference to be 0.

00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:29.370
And our measure of average variation is just the standard error of the difference scores:

00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:34.310
Putting it together, we get a t-statistic
of about -3.212.

00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:39.079
Before we get to the corresponding p-value
that our computer spit out, let’s consider

00:08:39.079 --> 00:08:43.719
another way to think about what t-statistics
are actually telling us.

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:49.320
T-statistics tell you how many standard errors away from the mean our observed difference is.

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:53.900
Though the t-distribution isn’t EXACTLY
normal, it’s reasonably close, so we can

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:58.820
use our intuition about normal distributions
to understand our t-values.

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:04.740
Normal distributions have about 68% of their data within one standard deviation from the mean.

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:08.640
And about 95% within 2 standard deviations.

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:13.920
That means that t-scores around 3, like ours, are about 3 standard errors away from the

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:18.290
mean...only around 0.3% of scores are that
far away!

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:24.459
So it makes sense that our p-value is very
small: 0.00582.

00:09:24.459 --> 00:09:29.529
Which allows us to reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the scores

00:09:29.529 --> 00:09:32.649
for Coffee from Caf-fiend and coffee from
The Blend Den.

00:09:32.649 --> 00:09:36.089
Which means that from now on, I’ll be buying my coffee from The Blend Den.

00:09:36.089 --> 00:09:39.189
Except for when I’m meeting up with Alex,
then I’ll buy` tea.

00:09:39.189 --> 00:09:43.630
Statistical tests help us wade through the
murky waters of variability, and our goal

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:49.430
should be to get rid of as MUCH of that variability as possible so that we can see patterns.

00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:56.240
We can see whether exercise improves sleep...which your friends might be lacking after all that coffee.

00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:00.860
Or whether your hearing could be hurt by listening to loud music by Cream or Ice Cube or Vanilla Ice

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:05.300
or some other musician that sounds like
it belongs in coffee.

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:10.460
Like Spoon! Spoon. Yeah? Brandon Spoon.

00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:14.140
But more importantly, we’re learning that
all those formulas you may have seen floating

00:10:14.149 --> 00:10:16.050
around, really aren’t that different.

00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:20.300
We’re just comparing what we see, to what
we think we should see.

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:25.029
We’re always comparing the way things are
to how we expect them to be.

00:10:25.029 --> 00:10:26.899
And statistics is no exception.

00:10:26.899 --> 00:10:30.790
We now have the tools to design experiments and answer a lot of interesting questions

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:36.460
and do our own experiments even if we over caffeinate some of our friends in  the process.

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:38.500
Thanks for watching. I'll see you next time.
