be almost impossible to tune the TV so

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210
be almost impossible to tune the TV so
 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.910
be almost impossible to tune the TV so
that the picture gets centered in the

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920
that the picture gets centered in the
 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.469
that the picture gets centered in the
display area so in this context

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479
display area so in this context
 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.440

designers had designed the knobs so the

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210
designers had designed the knobs so the
 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.480
designers had designed the knobs so the
each knob kind of does only one thing

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490
each knob kind of does only one thing
 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.089
each knob kind of does only one thing
and this makes it much easier to tune

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099
and this makes it much easier to tune
 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.290
and this makes it much easier to tune
the TV so that you know the picture

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300

to steer the angle and at the speed you
 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.460
to steer the angle and at the speed you
want but it's much harder then if you

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470
want but it's much harder then if you
 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.620

want but we have more orthogonalize

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:35.730
want but we have more orthogonalize

we look at the TV image is nice you can

00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:50.280
we look at the TV image is nice you can
 

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:52.640
we look at the TV image is nice you can
say oh my TV image is too wide so I'm

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:52.650
say oh my TV image is too wide so I'm
 

00:09:52.650 --> 00:09:54.410

now in machine learning it's nice if you

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:00.690
now in machine learning it's nice if you
 

00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:02.270
now in machine learning it's nice if you
can look at your system and say oh this

can look at your system and say oh this
 

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:03.980
can look at your system and say oh this
piece of it is wrong it is not doing on

on the test set which is not in real
 

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:10.850
on the test set which is not in real
world but figure out exactly what's

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:10.860
world but figure out exactly what's
 

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:13.340
world but figure out exactly what's
wrong and have exactly one knob where

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:13.350
wrong and have exactly one knob where
