00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:01.830
What I want to do
in this video is

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:05.030
give an overview
of quadrilaterals.

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:07.531
And you can imagine,
from this prefix,

00:00:07.531 --> 00:00:09.780
or, I guess you could say,
the beginning of this word,

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.560
quad-- this involves
four of something.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.244
And quadrilaterals, as you
can imagine, are shapes.

00:00:15.244 --> 00:00:17.660
And we're going to be talking
about two-dimensional shapes

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.260
that have four sides and four
vertices and four angles.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.701
So, for example--
one, two, three, four.

00:00:25.701 --> 00:00:27.700
That is a quadrilateral,
although that last side

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.040
didn't look too straight.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.509
One, two, three, four.

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:33.950
That is a quadrilateral.

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:35.492
One, two, three, four.

00:00:35.492 --> 00:00:36.700
These are all quadrilaterals.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.400
They all have four
sides, four vertices,

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.820
and, clearly, four angles.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.836
One angle, two angles, three
angles, and four angles.

00:00:45.836 --> 00:00:47.960
Actually, let me draw this
one a little bit bigger,

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.370
because it's interesting.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.440
So in this one
right over here, you

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.900
have one angle, two angles,
three angles, and then

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.440
you have this really big
angle right over there.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.800
If you look at the interior
angles of this quadrilateral.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.800
Now, quadrilaterals,
as you can imagine,

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.680
can be subdivided
into other groups

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.970
based on the properties
of the quadrilaterals.

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.120
And the main subdivision
of quadrilaterals

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.540
is between concave and
convex quadrilaterals.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.870
So you have concave,
and you have convex.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.490
And the way I remember
concave quadrilaterals,

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.860
or really concave polygons
of any number of shapes,

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.490
is that it looks like
something has caved in.

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.900
So, for example, this is
a concave quadrilateral.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.820
It looks like this
side has been caved in.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.270
And one way to define
concave quadrilaterals--

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.410
so let me draw it a little bit
bigger, so this right over here

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.550
is a concave
quadrilateral-- is that it

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:49.400
has an interior angle that
is larger than 180 degrees.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.230
So for example, this interior
angle right over here

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:57.070
is larger than 180 degrees.

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:58.480
And it's an interesting proof.

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:59.396
Maybe I'll do a video.

00:01:59.396 --> 00:02:01.450
It's actually a pretty
simple proof to show that,

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.170
if you have a concave
quadrilateral, if at least one

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.390
of the interior angles has
a measure larger than 180

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.510
degrees, that none of the sides
can be parallel to each other.

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:12.900
The other type of
quadrilateral, you can imagine,

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.690
is when all of the
interior angles

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.013
are less than 180 degrees.

00:02:17.013 --> 00:02:19.263
And you might say, wait--
what happens at 180 degrees?

00:02:19.263 --> 00:02:20.939
Well, if this angle
was 180 degrees,

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:22.730
then these wouldn't be
two different sides,

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:23.740
it would just be one side.

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.290
And that would look
like a triangle.

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.800
But if all of the
interior angles

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.670
are less than 180
degrees, then you're

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.820
dealing with a
convex quadrilateral.

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.890
So this convex
quadrilateral would

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.780
involve that one and
that one over there.

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:44.840
So this right over here is
what a convex quadrilateral

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.600
could look like-- four points,
four sides, four angles.

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.090
Now, within convex
quadrilaterals,

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.330
there are some other
interesting categorizations.

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.230
So now we're just going to
focus on convex quadrilaterals,

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.510
so that's going to be all
of this space over here.

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:07.200
So one type of convex
quadrilateral is a trapezoid.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.280
And a trapezoid is a
convex quadrilateral,

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.740
and sometimes the
definition here

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.400
is a little bit--
different people will

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.770
use different definitions.

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.480
So some people will
say a trapezoid

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.580
is a quadrilateral that
has exactly two sides that

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:21.850
are parallel to each other.

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.540
So, for example, they would
say that this right over here

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.350
is a trapezoid, where this
side is parallel to that side.

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:38.600
If I give it some letters here,
if I call this trapezoid ABCD,

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:43.750
we could say that segment AB
is parallel to segment DC,

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.349
and because of that we know
that this is a trapezoid.

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:50.390
Now I said that the
definition is a little fuzzy,

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.820
because some people say
you can have exactly one

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.070
pair of parallel
sides, but some people

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:58.590
say at least one pair
of parallel sides.

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.222
So if you use the
original definition--

00:04:00.222 --> 00:04:02.680
and that's the kind of thing
that most people are referring

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.820
to when they say a
trapezoid, exactly

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.560
one pair of parallel sides-- It
might be something like this.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.550
But if you use the broader
definition of at least one pair

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.380
of parallel sides,
then maybe this

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.320
could also be
considered a trapezoid

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.600
so you have one pair of
parallel sides like that

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.630
and then you have another pair
of parallel sides like that.

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.840
So this is a question mark
where it comes to a trapezoid.

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.740
A trapezoid is definitely
this thing here,

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.160
where you have exactly one
pair of parallel sides.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.130
Depending on
people's definition,

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:32.916
this may or may
not be a trapezoid.

00:04:32.916 --> 00:04:35.040
If you say it's exactly
one pair of parallel sides,

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.810
this is not a trapezoid,
because it has two pairs.

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.770
If you say at least one
pair of parallel sides,

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:40.930
then this is a trapezoid.

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.270
So I'll put that in a
little question mark there.

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.260
But there is a name
for this, regardless

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.560
of your definition of
what a trapezoid is.

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.990
If you have a quadrilateral with
two pairs of parallel sides,

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.300
you are then dealing
with a parallelogram.

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.430
So the one thing that you
definitely can call this

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:56.523
is a parallelogram.

00:05:06.001 --> 00:05:07.750
And I'll just draw it
a little bit bigger.

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:11.390
So it's a quadrilateral, and
if I have a quadrilateral,

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:13.850
and if I have two pairs
of parallel sides.

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:16.280
So the opposite
sides are parallel.

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.620
So that side is
parallel to that side,

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.930
and then this side is
parallel to that side

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.070
there-- you're dealing
with a parallelogram.

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:26.890
And then parallelograms can
be subdivided even further.

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.870
If the four angles
in a parallelogram

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:36.900
are all right angles, you're
dealing with a rectangle.

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.490
So let me draw one like that.

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:45.276
This is all in the
parallelogram universe,

00:05:45.276 --> 00:05:46.650
what I'm drawing
right over here.

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.686
This is all the
parallelogram universe.

00:05:48.686 --> 00:05:50.310
So it's a parallelogram,
which tells me

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:52.520
that opposite
sides are parallel.

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.640
And then if we know that all
four angles are 90 degrees.

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.180
And we've proven
in previous videos

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:01.180
how to figure out the sum of the
interior angles of any polygon.

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:02.679
And using that same
method you could

00:06:02.679 --> 00:06:07.390
say that the sum of the interior
angles of any quadrilateral

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:10.130
is actually 360 degrees.

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:12.230
And you see that in this
special case as well.

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:14.240
But maybe we'll prove
it in a separate video.

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.810
But this right over here
we would call a rectangle.

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:19.920
Parallelogram--
opposite sides parallel

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:22.780
and we have four right angles.

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:25.520
Now, if we have a parallelogram
where we don't necessarily

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:29.070
have four right
angles, but where

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:31.800
we do have the length of
the sides being equal,

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.160
then we're dealing
with a rhombus.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.100
So let me draw it like that.

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:37.990
So it's a parallelogram.

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:42.020
This is a parallelogram, so that
side is parallel to that side,

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:43.620
this side is parallel
to that side.

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.630
And we also know that all
four sides have equal length.

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:49.249
So this side's length is equal
to that side's length, which

00:06:49.249 --> 00:06:50.790
is equal to that
side's length, which

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:52.650
is equal to that side's length.

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:55.390
Then we are dealing
with a rhombus.

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:58.190
So one way to view it-- all
rhombi are parallelograms.

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:00.260
All rectangles are
parallelograms.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.220
All parallelograms you cannot
assume to be rectangles.

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:06.720
All parallelograms you
cannot assume to be rhombi.

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:10.350
Now, something can be both
a rectangle and a rhombus.

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:13.340
So let's say that this is
the universe of rectangles.

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:15.260
So the universe of
rectangles-- I'll

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.160
draw a little bit of
a Venn diagram here--

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:21.070
is that set of shapes and
the universe of rhombi

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:24.640
is this set of shapes
right over here.

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:27.050
So what would it look like?

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:28.880
Well, you would have
four right angles

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:31.330
and they would all
have the same length.

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:32.532
So it would look like this.

00:07:32.532 --> 00:07:34.115
So it'd definitely
be a parallelogram.

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:40.710
Four right angles
and all the sides

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:41.860
would have the same length.

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:44.443
And this is probably the first
of the shapes that you learned,

00:07:44.443 --> 00:07:45.670
or one of the first shapes.

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:48.450
This is clearly a square.

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:53.904
So all squares could also
be considered a rhombus,

00:07:53.904 --> 00:07:55.820
and they could also be
considered a rectangle,

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:58.120
and they could also be
considered a parallelogram.

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:01.240
But clearly, not all
rectangles are squares,

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:03.530
and not all rhombi are squares.

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:05.900
And definitely not all
parallelograms are squares.

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:07.650
This one, clearly,
right over here,

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:12.000
is neither a rectangle nor
a rhombi, nor a square.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:12.940
So that's an overview.

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:15.882
Just gives you a little bit
of taxonomy of quadrilaterals.

00:08:15.882 --> 00:08:17.340
And then in the
next few videos, we

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:19.300
can start to explore
them and find

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:21.270
their interesting
properties or just do

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:24.250
interesting problems
involving them.
