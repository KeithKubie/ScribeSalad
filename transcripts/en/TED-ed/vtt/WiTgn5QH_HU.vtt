00:00:06.463 --> 00:00:08.002
In the late 17th century,

00:00:08.002 --> 00:00:11.762
a medical student named Johannes Hofer
noticed a strange illness

00:00:11.762 --> 00:00:15.593
affecting Swiss mercenaries 
serving abroad.

00:00:15.593 --> 00:00:16.622
Its symptoms,

00:00:16.622 --> 00:00:17.534
including fatigue,

00:00:17.534 --> 00:00:18.573
insomnia,

00:00:18.573 --> 00:00:19.902
irregular heartbeat,

00:00:19.902 --> 00:00:21.223
indigestion,

00:00:21.223 --> 00:00:23.334
and fever were so strong,

00:00:23.334 --> 00:00:26.513
the soldiers often had to be discharged.

00:00:26.513 --> 00:00:30.445
As Hofer discovered, the cause was not
some physical disturbance,

00:00:30.445 --> 00:00:34.124
but an intense yearning for their
mountain homeland.

00:00:34.124 --> 00:00:36.484
He dubbed the condition nostalgia,

00:00:36.484 --> 00:00:38.633
from the Greek "nostos" for homecoming

00:00:38.633 --> 00:00:41.693
and "algos" for pain or longing.

00:00:41.693 --> 00:00:46.845
At first, nostalgia was considered
a particularly Swiss affliction.

00:00:46.845 --> 00:00:51.182
Some doctors proposed that
the constant sound of cowbells in the Alps

00:00:51.182 --> 00:00:55.244
caused trauma to the ear drums and brain.

00:00:55.244 --> 00:00:59.763
Commanders even forbade their soldiers
from singing traditional Swiss songs

00:00:59.763 --> 00:01:04.034
for fear that they'd lead to desertion
or suicide.

00:01:04.034 --> 00:01:09.814
But as migration increased worldwide,
nostalgia was observed in various groups.

00:01:09.814 --> 00:01:14.265
It turned out that anyone separated
from their native place for a long time

00:01:14.265 --> 00:01:16.815
was vulnerable to nostalgia.

00:01:16.815 --> 00:01:18.505
And by the early 20th century,

00:01:18.505 --> 00:01:22.315
professionals no longer viewed it
as a neurological disease,

00:01:22.315 --> 00:01:25.624
but as a mental condition 
similar to depression.

00:01:25.624 --> 00:01:27.555
Psychologists of the time speculated

00:01:27.555 --> 00:01:31.366
that it represented difficulties
letting go of childhood,

00:01:31.366 --> 00:01:35.115
or even a longing to return to one's
fetal state.

00:01:35.115 --> 00:01:36.725
But over the next few decades,

00:01:36.725 --> 00:01:40.795
the understanding of nostalgia changed
in two important ways.

00:01:40.795 --> 00:01:44.195
Its meaning expanded from indicating
homesickness

00:01:44.195 --> 00:01:47.345
to a general longing for the past.

00:01:47.345 --> 00:01:49.297
And rather than an awful disease,

00:01:49.297 --> 00:01:53.585
it began to be seen as a poignant
and pleasant experience.

00:01:53.585 --> 00:01:55.575
Perhaps the most famous example of this

00:01:55.575 --> 00:01:59.439
was captured by French author 
Marcel Proust.

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:03.446
He described how tasting a madeleine cake
he had not eaten since childhood

00:02:03.446 --> 00:02:09.166
triggered a cascade of warm
and powerful sensory associations.

00:02:09.166 --> 00:02:14.226
So what caused such a major
reversal in our view of nostalgia?

00:02:14.226 --> 00:02:16.445
Part of it has to do with science.

00:02:16.445 --> 00:02:19.756
Psychology shifted away from pure theory

00:02:19.756 --> 00:02:24.516
and towards more careful and systematic
empirical observation.

00:02:24.516 --> 00:02:27.906
So professionals realized that many
of the negative symptoms

00:02:27.906 --> 00:02:30.677
may have been simply correlated
with nostalgia

00:02:30.677 --> 00:02:32.751
rather than caused by it.

00:02:32.751 --> 00:02:36.681
And, in fact, despite being a complex
emotional state

00:02:36.681 --> 00:02:39.863
that can include feelings of loss
and sadness,

00:02:39.863 --> 00:02:44.322
nostalgia doesn't generally put people
in a negative mood.

00:02:44.322 --> 00:02:48.213
Instead, by allowing individuals 
to remember personally meaningful

00:02:48.213 --> 00:02:51.702
and rewarding experiences
they shared with others,

00:02:51.702 --> 00:02:55.042
nostalgia can boost 
psychological well-being.

00:02:55.042 --> 00:02:58.132
Studies have shown 
that inducing nostalgia in people

00:02:58.132 --> 00:03:02.652
can help increase their feelings
of self-esteem and social belonging,

00:03:02.652 --> 00:03:04.702
encourage psychological growth,

00:03:04.702 --> 00:03:07.839
and even make them act
more charitably.

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:11.033
So rather than being a cause
of mental distress,

00:03:11.033 --> 00:03:15.623
nostalgia can be a restorative way
of coping with it.

00:03:15.623 --> 00:03:19.143
For instance, when people experience
negative emotional states,

00:03:19.143 --> 00:03:23.063
they tend to naturally use nostalgia
to reduce distress

00:03:23.063 --> 00:03:25.664
and restore well-being.

00:03:25.664 --> 00:03:28.932
Today, it seems that nostalgia 
is everywhere,

00:03:28.932 --> 00:03:32.582
partially because advertisers 
have discovered how powerful it is

00:03:32.582 --> 00:03:34.944
as a marketing technique.

00:03:34.944 --> 00:03:39.001
It's tempting to think of this as a sign
of us being stuck in the past,

00:03:39.001 --> 00:03:42.203
but that's not really how nostalgia works.

00:03:42.203 --> 00:03:47.354
Instead, nostalgia helps us remember
that our lives can have meaning and value,

00:03:47.354 --> 00:03:50.634
helping us find the confidence
and motivation

00:03:50.634 --> 00:03:53.293
to face the challenges of the future.
