1
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:06.300
Listening to radio lab radio from w n y. S

2
00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.530
so nice to see you again, Jen. Uh, why is, did you say that with some vendors?

3
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.660
What is that all about? It's just a, you've been away for a while. The only way,

4
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.730
only way I can see you is when I come visit you with your other family. Okay.

5
00:00:26.731 --> 00:00:30.210
So this is Radiolab producer Matt Kielty. Yeah,

6
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.550
we're talking about what are we talking about?

7
00:00:32.551 --> 00:00:37.410
We're talking about a supreme court case from 1989 and today man has a story

8
00:00:37.411 --> 00:00:41.790
that he's been reporting for about two years that we are going to play both here

9
00:00:41.791 --> 00:00:46.650
on more. Perfect. And also here on radio lab. So buckle up where,

10
00:00:46.651 --> 00:00:49.890
where should we start? I think we might as well just start,

11
00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.760
should I try to sound southern with a guy named woody canet?

12
00:00:53.761 --> 00:00:57.690
So I'm a lawyer with Essex Richards, a law firm in Charlotte, North Carolina.

13
00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.150
We'll pick it up in 1985 back in 1995 I was a very young lawyer.

14
00:01:03.151 --> 00:01:04.620
I was 32 years old.

15
00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:08.460
I just started mountain law firm and I was taken about anything that came

16
00:01:08.461 --> 00:01:09.294
through the door.

17
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.390
And one day [inaudible] this guy walked in a late thirties fairly thin,

18
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.470
five foot nine, five foot 10 bone crutches, and he's a black man. He is.

19
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.320
Or was, who's passed away? Mr. Graham,

20
00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.630
the man's name is throwing gram and what he says, well, you know, like what?

21
00:01:27.631 --> 00:01:29.970
What happened to your leg? What's with the crutches

22
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.020
and get Thorin lays everything out for him.

23
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.850
So he was pulled over on West Boulevard in Charlotte,

24
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.680
which is a four lane road to thorn until what he,

25
00:01:41.681 --> 00:01:45.000
he worked for the city of Charlotte and the Department of Transportation on road

26
00:01:45.001 --> 00:01:46.890
crews doing road repairs.

27
00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.590
It was a Monday afternoon and on that day wanted to throw on his friends.

28
00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.130
Coworkers stopped by his place and after talking for a bit,

29
00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.450
Mr. Graham asked to be taken to a nearby convenience store.

30
00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.640
There was only two or three blocks from his house.

31
00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.670
He needed some orange juice because he was a suffering the onset of a diabetic

32
00:02:05.221 --> 00:02:08.870
insulin reaction. So d thorn hopped in his friend's car,

33
00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.600
they drove over to this convenience store to and got out,

34
00:02:11.601 --> 00:02:14.390
got a bottle of orange shoes, got to the checkout counter,

35
00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.400
but there's a line there. So he puts the bottle down and hurries out,

36
00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.480
gets back in his friend's car. Did I take off now? Uh,

37
00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.060
this is where the problems started.

38
00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.700
Tins that at the same time,

39
00:02:28.701 --> 00:02:32.830
all that's happening there is actually an officer who was African Americans

40
00:02:32.831 --> 00:02:34.220
sitting in his squad car.

41
00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.750
And what that officer observed was a man hurrying out of the store,

42
00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.560
jumping into a whiting car and quickly driving off.

43
00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.810
So he starts to tail to thorn and his friend and after a couple of blocks pulled

44
00:02:47.811 --> 00:02:50.930
him over just to determine what was going on there.

45
00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.990
So he goes up to the driver's side, presumably gets to thorns.

46
00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.760
Buddy's driver's license, goes back to his squad, car, starts radioing, um,

47
00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.160
to get, to get a hold of the convenience

48
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.940
<v 1>store to see if anything can happen. And it's right around that moment,</v>

49
00:03:03.941 --> 00:03:08.830
that disorder who's in the passenger seat of the car suddenly opened his door,

50
00:03:08.831 --> 00:03:09.730
got out of the car,

51
00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.520
<v 0>circled the car once or twice, like sort of stumbled around it.</v>

52
00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.050
Then he sat down on the curb

53
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.660
<v 2>and he started going into shock a lot. Almost like a seizure he would have.</v>

54
00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.490
Oh really? Yeah. And it was terrifying. This is the thorn Graham Jr.

55
00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.280
He was a type one diabetic. What is type one diabetes?

56
00:03:29.281 --> 00:03:31.290
Cause I know it's one and two. From what I understand,

57
00:03:31.291 --> 00:03:35.640
the type one diabetes is when you buy to just doesn't produce enough, uh,

58
00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.610
insulin. And what would that seizure look like?

59
00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.580
Well [inaudible] one incident in particular,

60
00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.600
I can remember us being in church and he got like this blank stare on his face

61
00:03:45.601 --> 00:03:48.790
and you see the beads of sweat come on his forehead.

62
00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.250
His body was seized up and he would shake and he would bite his tongue up. And,

63
00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.560
and so I can remember my mother trying to, you know,

64
00:03:55.561 --> 00:03:59.220
force a spoon into his mouth to keep him from biting his tongue up.

65
00:03:59.221 --> 00:04:01.830
And the main thing was try to get some orange juice in him.

66
00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.120
That way it would raise his uh, blood sugar and, and once you got the orange,

67
00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.510
you're saying to me he'd sleep for a couple of hours and then he'd wake up and

68
00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:12.150
he'd be exhausted but he'd be alive.

69
00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.090
<v 1>Alright. So Charlotte City Street. Okay.</v>

70
00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:17.993
<v 0>This point,</v>

71
00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.700
four other officers arrived to thorn has actually passed out on the curb.

72
00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:27.730
One of the officers rolled Mr. Graham over on the sidewalk and cuffed his hands

73
00:04:28.581 --> 00:04:29.540
behind his back

74
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:35.310
<v 1>at one point of one of the officers grabs the thorn by the handcuffs and picks</v>

75
00:04:35.311 --> 00:04:39.060
him up off the curb from, from behind. Oh Wow.

76
00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.490
The thorn was sort of in and out at this point.

77
00:04:41.491 --> 00:04:43.170
I guess he tries to tell the officers,

78
00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.300
<v 0>but he was a diabetic that he had a medical card in his wallet,</v>

79
00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:50.650
asked the officer to pull the wallet out of his back pocket and one of the

80
00:04:50.651 --> 00:04:54.910
officers said a, nothing wrong with the motherfucker buddy's drunk.

81
00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.410
<v 1>At some point around here, the details are a little unclear.</v>

82
00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:00.440
<v 0>Pretty Nasty. Scuffle ensued</v>

83
00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.260
<v 1>according to what is known as case syllabus.</v>

84
00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.440
Thorn was resisting the officers and apparently one of the officers slammed a

85
00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.860
Thorne's head into his friend's car. He suffered head and shoulder injuries.

86
00:05:09.861 --> 00:05:12.200
He also ended up with a broken foot, cuts around his wrist,

87
00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:17.030
and eventually the officers pick him up, one on each arm,

88
00:05:17.031 --> 00:05:20.840
one on each leg, and just throw him into the back of a squad car.

89
00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:24.780
<v 0>While this was going on, um,</v>

90
00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:27.400
a few people gathered around and not long after that,

91
00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:32.430
the officers learned that nothing at all had happened at the convenience store.

92
00:05:32.501 --> 00:05:35.530
There was no crime, there was no robbery, there was no shoplifting.

93
00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:38.130
<v 1>So they drove him back to his house, still in handcuffs,</v>

94
00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:42.420
<v 0>pulled him out of the car. A friend of Thrones has gotten some OJ and, uh,</v>

95
00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:45.510
the officers light him out in his front yard,

96
00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:48.960
took the handcuffs off and then just drive away. Huh?

97
00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:52.320
Was there an apology? Oh No.

98
00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:58.040
<v 1>Now what came out</v>

99
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:03.040
<v 4>of that day in Charlotte would end up becoming one of the most important supreme</v>

100
00:06:03.051 --> 00:06:06.110
court cases in our history when it comes to policing.

101
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:09.350
And what drew me in about this case is how something,

102
00:06:09.351 --> 00:06:11.120
like I needed some orange shoes,

103
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:16.270
that something so seemingly small would eventually become tied to

104
00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.160
[inaudible] and all that.

105
00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:24.930
<v 1>The shootings we've seen in the past few years, mostly of young black men,</v>

106
00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.470
every time we hear one of these shootings, every time there is an outcry,

107
00:06:28.471 --> 00:06:32.910
every time the cop gets off, this incident is looming in the shadows,

108
00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:37.590
shaping the outcome. In many ways,

109
00:06:37.591 --> 00:06:40.170
it is quietly defined the era that we're living in.

110
00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:42.300
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

111
00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:43.950
<v 1>and I wanted to know how</v>

112
00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:48.160
<v 6>[inaudible], how did that happen?</v>

113
00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:52.590
The honorable,

114
00:06:52.591 --> 00:06:57.591
the chief justice and the associate justices of the Supreme Court of the United

115
00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:01.110
States. Oh, Yay. Yay.

116
00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:06.560
<v 7>Having business before the honorable, the Supreme Court of the United States.</v>

117
00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:11.050
Red Monies to draw on Aaron [inaudible],

118
00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:15.710
God save the United States in this honorable card.

119
00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:26.383
[inaudible]

120
00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:33.483
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

121
00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:36.153
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

122
00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.020
<v 2>all right. To wind back the clock a little bit are,</v>

123
00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:50.150
I will say this about my dad now. He wasn't someone that would, would, uh,

124
00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:53.320
just lay down and roll over talking to the Thorn Junior.

125
00:07:53.321 --> 00:07:56.830
I asked him a little bit about his dad and he told me that Thorn Sr grew up in

126
00:07:56.831 --> 00:08:00.880
the south eastern North Carolina owned a tobacco farm. He was a hard worker.

127
00:08:00.881 --> 00:08:04.990
Good student. His sisters told me that he was the first, uh,

128
00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:09.640
black or African American accepted to Duke University. Huh. But, uh,

129
00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:12.910
my grandmother, she wouldn't let him go because of, you know,

130
00:08:12.911 --> 00:08:16.500
during the civil rights era that she didn't want him to have to experience, uh,

131
00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:18.490
all that, all that mess.

132
00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:22.400
<v 1>This is a CBS news special report. And just for a little bit of context here,</v>

133
00:08:22.401 --> 00:08:25.460
I mean like the civil rights movement was a lot of things,

134
00:08:25.461 --> 00:08:29.090
but there was this big part of it that was about police brutality.

135
00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:34.120
Last night there was open war in 1965 you had the infamous watts riots in Los

136
00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:35.460
Angeles.

137
00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:37.320
<v 7>My brothers make the state from battlefield</v>

138
00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:40.140
<v 1>also what was known as the long hot summer of 1967.</v>

139
00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:45.160
<v 7>How we got that popped right up where there were more than 150 race riots across</v>

140
00:08:45.161 --> 00:08:48.010
the country getting get data being pushed around, or you lay this out.

141
00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:50.500
A lot of which were sparked by accusations of police.

142
00:08:50.501 --> 00:08:53.940
Brutalities baton was on the street kicking into the doe, taking down a police,

143
00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:55.023
taking a kicked in the teeth.

144
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:59.490
<v 8>I will not accept charges against policemen.</v>

145
00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:04.860
I will not accept charges against policeman. This is a judge,

146
00:09:04.861 --> 00:09:07.410
not some wild eyed cracker that made the statement,

147
00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:11.130
although there might not be any difference. There might not be any difference.

148
00:09:11.131 --> 00:09:12.360
If you can think on that,

149
00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:16.650
do you understand that if we cannot bring charges against the policemen who have

150
00:09:16.651 --> 00:09:20.340
murdered us and destroyed our homes and businesses, where will we go?

151
00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:21.690
Where will we go?

152
00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:28.870
<v 1>She didn't want them to have to experience all that, all that mess.</v>

153
00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:31.900
So ended up, I think he ended up going to Fayetteville state,

154
00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.440
a historically black college in North Carolina and winded thorn senior

155
00:09:35.441 --> 00:09:37.960
graduated. Actually one of the first jobs that he had.

156
00:09:37.961 --> 00:09:41.290
He worked for an employer called a precision springs.

157
00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:43.960
This was a steel company that specialized in making springs,

158
00:09:43.961 --> 00:09:47.980
but at a certain point he ended up actually suing the company for discrimination

159
00:09:47.981 --> 00:09:51.850
based on how they were treating, uh, you know, people of color.

160
00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:54.280
So after that day with the officers in Charlotte,

161
00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:58.690
the one thing I do remember dad saying was that it wasn't right did someone was

162
00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:00.190
gonna fight. Right.

163
00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:03.700
And that is how he ends up walking into what he's office on crutches.

164
00:10:03.701 --> 00:10:08.470
In 1985 he tells what he, I want to sue the Charlotte police department.

165
00:10:08.471 --> 00:10:11.920
So we went ahead and just filed our lawsuit in federal court.

166
00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:15.580
Woody takes it to trial. And basically his argument is that the police,

167
00:10:15.581 --> 00:10:19.630
they had used excessive force that was totally unnecessary under the

168
00:10:19.631 --> 00:10:20.530
circumstances.

169
00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:24.940
Like they roughed up a diabetic who is telling them that he was a diabetic and

170
00:10:24.941 --> 00:10:29.020
eventually the judge presiding over the case ruled that no,

171
00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:31.730
these officers did not use excessive force.

172
00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:33.830
And if you are going to claim that they did,

173
00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:38.860
we had to show that the police officers had acted maliciously for the purpose of

174
00:10:41.031 --> 00:10:44.120
causing harm. Huh. So they,

175
00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:47.990
they had to prove that the officer's actually meant to hurt him. Yeah.

176
00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:53.020
That woody and into thorn had to prove that the officers had it out for thorn

177
00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:55.210
and we simply couldn't do that. Yeah.

178
00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:57.440
It seems like a really hard thing to prove.

179
00:10:57.650 --> 00:11:00.140
It's an almost impossible standard to meet.

180
00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:03.620
And I think it's important to zoom in on this for a second because this is

181
00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:06.860
really kind of like the crux of the story. Um,

182
00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:12.130
if the question is what should the standard be for holding a cop accountable for

183
00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:15.440
the use of forests, then in the mid eighties, um,

184
00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:18.380
malicious intent with sort of the prevailing standard,

185
00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:22.370
if you're going to claim that a police officer used excessive force against you,

186
00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:27.610
then the standard was that you had to prove that the officer did so with malice

187
00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:31.130
in their heart. Why was that the standard?

188
00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:36.140
This is kind of hard to explain. I don't have the 14th amendment in front of me,

189
00:11:36.141 --> 00:11:39.680
but it essentially says all you really need to know is that it was connected to

190
00:11:39.681 --> 00:11:42.860
the 14th amendment to a particular clause in the 14th amendment.

191
00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:46.310
And this is why woody and de Thoren lost that case. Okay. All right.

192
00:11:46.311 --> 00:11:47.760
So loses it federal court lose it.

193
00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:52.340
Federal makes its way up to the Fourth Circuit Court of appeals that went

194
00:11:52.341 --> 00:11:56.530
nowhere. The court of Appeals ruled against us. Same thing. Same thing.

195
00:11:57.110 --> 00:12:01.460
<v 9>But then not long after that ruling what he gets a phone call radio.</v>

196
00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:04.790
Can you hear me from this guy? Yep. Jerry beaver,

197
00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:08.450
unknown civil rights lawyer in the area in Fayetteville, North Carolina.

198
00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:12.970
Gerald was older and wiser than me. That's your wording, not mine. Jerry. Hey.

199
00:12:12.971 --> 00:12:16.370
Caught wind of the circuit decision and was just like, oh no, no, no, no, no,

200
00:12:16.371 --> 00:12:16.850
no, no.

201
00:12:16.850 --> 00:12:21.200
You should not have to require that the police officer had it in for you and

202
00:12:21.201 --> 00:12:24.590
just wanting to beat the crap out. That'd be just cause it made him feel better.

203
00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:26.360
So I called woody and said,

204
00:12:26.361 --> 00:12:30.140
are you guys planning on taking this case to the Supreme Court?

205
00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:34.960
And when he was like, no, my client can't really afford that. And I said,

206
00:12:34.961 --> 00:12:36.760
tell him he doesn't have to worry about that.

207
00:12:36.761 --> 00:12:39.250
We will be glad to take it on pro bono.

208
00:12:39.251 --> 00:12:43.450
And see if we can get this ruling over return. When he heard that what he said,

209
00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:45.250
sure, let's go.

210
00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:49.650
<v 10>So Jane would he get together and they started looking around like what's out</v>

211
00:12:49.651 --> 00:12:50.010
there?

212
00:12:50.010 --> 00:12:53.940
What cases can we draw in to argue that there should be a different standard and

213
00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:57.420
it's just so happened this is the mid eighties and there was this well of police

214
00:12:57.421 --> 00:13:01.470
use of force cases kind of bubbling up in the courts and you had lawyers trying

215
00:13:01.471 --> 00:13:02.700
out all these different ideas.

216
00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:07.800
Now most of the courts were using the 14th amendment malicious intent standard

217
00:13:07.801 --> 00:13:08.910
that Jared would even like.

218
00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:12.690
Then there was also in the number of cases the eighth amendment.

219
00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:15.760
What's the eighth one? Unusual punishment. He justice prior.

220
00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:18.600
The eighth is cruel and unusual punishment problem there,

221
00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:22.830
which doesn't totally explain it zone what is cruel? What is unusual?

222
00:13:22.831 --> 00:13:23.850
Like take the word cruel.

223
00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:27.510
Cruel seems to imply that intent that you're trying to hurt somebody,

224
00:13:27.511 --> 00:13:28.620
which means if you're going to prove anything,

225
00:13:28.621 --> 00:13:31.010
you still have to call inside somebody's head. Right? But

226
00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:36.100
<v 9>there was this other amendment that some of the courts were using that what do</v>

227
00:13:36.101 --> 00:13:40.870
you and Jerry looked to as their sort of like redeemer? The fourth amendment,

228
00:13:40.871 --> 00:13:44.200
the fourth amendment, the fourth amendment which is,

229
00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:46.390
which is the government cannot subjects.

230
00:13:46.850 --> 00:13:48.640
Edison's to Andre's most search and seizure.

231
00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:50.120
<v 1>I have it on my legal pad.</v>

232
00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:54.740
The fourth amendment is the right of the people to be secure in their persons

233
00:13:54.741 --> 00:13:55.221
houses,

234
00:13:55.221 --> 00:14:00.221
papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be

235
00:14:00.231 --> 00:14:04.220
violated and is seizure just another a word for force,

236
00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:07.790
like I have the right not to be like beaten or shot by my government. Yeah.

237
00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.720
Yeah. It's not just that, but yes. It also includes that and did Jane,

238
00:14:11.721 --> 00:14:14.780
what do what they like so much about the fourth amendment is that in there is

239
00:14:14.781 --> 00:14:19.730
this one important word, unreasonable, reasonable,

240
00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:23.000
reasonable concept of reasonableness.

241
00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:26.800
What is reasonable and what is not reasonable in law?

242
00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:30.140
Reasonable is is supposed to be objective.

243
00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:34.340
You look at the case from the facts of the case. You look at the WHO, what,

244
00:14:34.341 --> 00:14:37.070
where, when, not the Y. Correct. Then you ask,

245
00:14:37.071 --> 00:14:39.830
was this person's behavior reasonable or not?

246
00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:44.240
They have to act with objective reasonableness. Wait a second.

247
00:14:44.241 --> 00:14:47.150
I mean reasonableness as a slippery thing. What you find reasonable,

248
00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:48.830
what I find reasonable could very well be different,

249
00:14:48.831 --> 00:14:51.950
could be completely different. Yes and no. It can feel slippery,

250
00:14:51.951 --> 00:14:56.951
but legally the whole concept of reasonableness had hundreds of years of

251
00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:01.230
precedent. I mean, I,

252
00:15:01.231 --> 00:15:04.150
I find this very fascinating and I don't know if you want me to give you like a

253
00:15:04.151 --> 00:15:06.790
little bit of a backstory. Well,

254
00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:10.080
do you want to give me a little bit of, I think it's Kinda, it's,

255
00:15:10.081 --> 00:15:13.420
it's interesting how it came to be and how popular it is. Yeah.

256
00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:16.040
You can take me out. Take me on the ride. Okay. All right. So, uh,

257
00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:19.900
we go back to like the 1830s that Andrew Jackson area. Now he's actually,

258
00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:23.140
we're over in Europe. Uh, we're in Belgium. Uh,

259
00:15:23.141 --> 00:15:25.600
this is going to be like a little windy, but I think it kind of makes sense.

260
00:15:25.601 --> 00:15:28.240
So in the 1836 guy,

261
00:15:28.241 --> 00:15:32.860
adult Kettler adult kettle a is a mathematician, he's an astronomer.

262
00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:36.840
If you want to picture something, he had hollow cheeks. He's big sideburns.

263
00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:41.530
Looked a little bit like, um, David straitharn the,

264
00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:45.210
the guy from the Edward Moreau movie,

265
00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:49.590
the Jason Bourne movies, if you've, if that helps you at all. Yeah, yeah,

266
00:15:49.591 --> 00:15:53.070
totally. It's great. Anyhow, uh, he was a super smart guy and an 1830s,

267
00:15:53.071 --> 00:15:55.740
the Belgian government wanted to set up an observatory,

268
00:15:55.741 --> 00:15:58.800
but astronomers have this issue, um,

269
00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:02.580
that they had trouble pinpointing the location of stars because their telescopes

270
00:16:02.581 --> 00:16:03.840
were just so bad.

271
00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:06.730
But Kennedy was one of these astronomers who knew you could use, uh,

272
00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:08.520
statistics to figure these things out.

273
00:16:08.521 --> 00:16:12.420
You could take an average of all the different measurements and average of the

274
00:16:12.421 --> 00:16:16.530
meteorological data and that can help you pinpoint where stars were actually

275
00:16:16.531 --> 00:16:19.740
going to be in the sky so that they can make predictions.

276
00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:20.850
And it's interesting to know that, yeah,

277
00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:23.670
this statistical average thing was like revolutionizing astronomy.

278
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.570
And so what happened is kettle a became fascinated by this idea of averages.

279
00:16:27.571 --> 00:16:29.970
And what he did is he, he kind of took that idea,

280
00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:32.460
like took it down from the heavens, from the sky,

281
00:16:32.461 --> 00:16:34.920
and started applying it to humans.

282
00:16:35.190 --> 00:16:37.470
So we began combing through data and medical journals,

283
00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:40.980
trying to determine the average height of a person, the average weight, um,

284
00:16:41.010 --> 00:16:42.600
the circumference of somebody's chest.

285
00:16:42.601 --> 00:16:45.690
Was he trying to like come up with these sort of Prodo man kind of thing? Yeah,

286
00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:48.300
totally. And it would have a huge impact on public health,

287
00:16:48.390 --> 00:16:51.690
but he ends up actually going beyond this and it's beyond just like physical

288
00:16:51.691 --> 00:16:52.020
traits.

289
00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:57.020
And he starts to like push into man's morality and he's looking at crime rates,

290
00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:01.140
suicide rates, marriage rates. And in the 1830s,

291
00:17:01.141 --> 00:17:05.300
he starts laying out this concept what is, uh, in French, uh,

292
00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:10.050
loam Moines, which translates into the average man,

293
00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:14.850
the average man. So, so this is like big data, 1830 style. Yeah.

294
00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:19.320
And this idea of low Moynihan, the average man, it became, uh,

295
00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:24.150
very useful in law, English law. Really. How exactly,

296
00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:27.690
let me explain. In Victorian England,

297
00:17:27.691 --> 00:17:31.460
there is much to do about people who wanted to sue for damages or left

298
00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:33.810
advantages. There was a need for constant averages,

299
00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:37.200
a way to take measure in stock to see if a person had straight from the flock.

300
00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:40.890
This surely seem like the best way to determine if the accused had to pay at

301
00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:44.060
your wet. Are you doing that? Stands alone. Alright,

302
00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:48.210
on the two English judges they decreed, here's how we will fill this need.

303
00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:49.860
Put a man on the stand,

304
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:51.480
<v 11>have him raise his right hand.</v>

305
00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:54.990
Let's say you stack some hay in a terribly negligent way.

306
00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:58.380
Much more like a funeral pyre caught his neighbor's home totally on fire.

307
00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:02.190
But he says the days are hot and long that he did nothing wrong. So Jerry,

308
00:18:02.191 --> 00:18:06.180
I ask of you, what is it that we shall do? How about think of ordinary folk,

309
00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:07.800
your average typical reasonable bloke.

310
00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:12.990
And then [inaudible] take a look at the accused at hand and ask yourself this

311
00:18:12.991 --> 00:18:17.160
one question. Did he behave like your ordinary,

312
00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:19.950
average, reasonable man?

313
00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:21.923
<v 1>Wow,</v>

314
00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:28.980
I didn't even know you had that in you. Guilty. [inaudible] okay. Are.

315
00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:33.860
So you're saying that judges and juries began to use these averages as a way to

316
00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:37.030
sort of like figure out like if you're suing somebody else that,

317
00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:40.280
that somebody else, did they act out of the ordinary where they unreasonable?

318
00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:43.610
Yeah. And it was just a few years after and this whole average man thing,

319
00:18:43.611 --> 00:18:46.190
that English law started developing this idea,

320
00:18:46.191 --> 00:18:50.900
this standard known initially as the reasonable man standard, um,

321
00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:55.160
eventually switches to person a to be a little bit more gender inclusive. Uh,

322
00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.560
this reasonable person.

323
00:18:57.910 --> 00:19:02.220
It's one of the longest established fictional characters that exists in what is

324
00:19:02.221 --> 00:19:04.680
known as like the legal village where you have these other little characters.

325
00:19:04.681 --> 00:19:07.380
Like it starts with the reasonable person and then you start,

326
00:19:07.381 --> 00:19:09.360
you get like a slew of these other,

327
00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:13.260
these other characters that come out of that, which is a, I have a little list.

328
00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:16.170
There's the ordinary prudent man of business,

329
00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:21.600
the officious bystander. There is the fair minded and informed observer.

330
00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:24.180
There's the reasonable juror, there's the reasonable parent,

331
00:19:24.181 --> 00:19:25.200
there's the reasonable landlord,

332
00:19:25.201 --> 00:19:27.420
there's a reasonable neurosurgeon or reasonable civil engineer.

333
00:19:27.421 --> 00:19:31.170
There's also a reasonable hairdresser. Really, it's sort of like,

334
00:19:31.171 --> 00:19:36.030
it's like in any sort of, uh, uh, trade or craft, um,

335
00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:39.660
where there's business being done or you have the ability within your craft to

336
00:19:39.661 --> 00:19:41.610
harm somebody legally.

337
00:19:41.611 --> 00:19:46.611
It became very useful to have an average archetypal person doing that craft so

338
00:19:46.711 --> 00:19:48.490
that the jury or the judge, um,

339
00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:52.170
would have something to use as a measurement when rendering judgment.

340
00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:55.350
That's interesting. So like in the hairdresser example,

341
00:19:56.130 --> 00:20:01.130
whatever it was that led to that phrase probably was a kettle and survey in at

342
00:20:01.561 --> 00:20:04.500
least an imagined one of hairdresser behavior. Yeah. Like,

343
00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:08.880
like maybe you went in to get a haircut and you walked out and half year's gone,

344
00:20:08.910 --> 00:20:10.950
right. And you're just like, where'd half my year ago?

345
00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:12.990
And then it's just you go to court and you're like,

346
00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:16.170
any reasonable hairdresser would not have made that cut. Right.

347
00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:17.101
That's so interesting.

348
00:20:17.101 --> 00:20:20.370
So it starts with this astronomer and ends up with this village of

349
00:20:20.371 --> 00:20:21.204
reasonableness.

350
00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:23.880
Chime in with the funny thing about the village something please.

351
00:20:23.881 --> 00:20:28.710
This is pretty straight Kelly prime. So like in English law, um, like Matt said,

352
00:20:28.711 --> 00:20:30.360
there's like this village of people,

353
00:20:30.361 --> 00:20:33.590
but in England at the time they had this idea that the,

354
00:20:33.591 --> 00:20:36.930
it wasn't like a village, it was people on a bus.

355
00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:40.470
It was called the man on the Clapham Omnibus, which is a roughly,

356
00:20:40.471 --> 00:20:42.340
I looked up at London bus route 88 ways.

357
00:20:42.341 --> 00:20:45.690
So this is like a bus full of racist people. All those people, are they going,

358
00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:47.980
I don't know, they just ride all day though. All those

359
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:50.440
<v 12>people just waiting for the case to come up and be like, oh,</v>

360
00:20:50.730 --> 00:20:52.170
that's your hairdresser. Um,

361
00:20:52.171 --> 00:20:55.900
and then like that concept moved and like Australia was like, okay,

362
00:20:55.901 --> 00:20:56.531
we should use that.

363
00:20:56.531 --> 00:20:59.670
And so one part called that the man on the Bondi Tram and another part called

364
00:20:59.690 --> 00:21:03.190
the man on the Burke street tram and then Hong Kong got it.

365
00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:08.380
And they said it's the man on the uh, shank shonky one tram.

366
00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:12.180
So the bus is just a convenient vessel to hold all these reasonable people. So,

367
00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:13.270
um,

368
00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:17.970
England said all these people are on a bus because you didn't want someone is

369
00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:22.570
like, like so lowly that they are like, they're not riding the bus.

370
00:21:22.571 --> 00:21:25.810
They're like hold up in a cave somewhere or someone that is like high up on

371
00:21:25.811 --> 00:21:29.080
their castle. It's like the common man. Yeah, exactly. So it said, um,

372
00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:32.410
it was described as reasonably educated, intelligent but nondescript.

373
00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:37.610
<v 1>And I think like what, what woody and Jerry to bring in all the way back,</v>

374
00:21:37.670 --> 00:21:41.000
we're essentially trying to do is to say we need to use the fourth amendment and

375
00:21:41.001 --> 00:21:45.650
this idea of unreasonable search and seizure to create a reasonable officer.

376
00:21:45.770 --> 00:21:46.640
Oh,

377
00:21:46.641 --> 00:21:50.810
so we need to add an reasonable officer to the village or the bus.

378
00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:55.870
So rarely the cases submitted in 1989 almost five years after everything

379
00:21:56.721 --> 00:21:59.690
happened to, to Thorn Graham that one day in Charlotte,

380
00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:04.720
we'll hear argument next to number 87 65 71 his case went before the Supreme

381
00:22:05.150 --> 00:22:07.880
Court. So you form Graham versus Ms. Honor.

382
00:22:08.510 --> 00:22:10.040
Now Thorn wasn't there for the arguments.

383
00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:13.940
What he was there as a spectator to watch. Jerry was actually arguing the case.

384
00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:17.150
Did you have butterflies? Of course you may proceed whenever you're ready.

385
00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:18.440
Just to chief justice,

386
00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:23.180
may I please the court and pretty quickly these arguments you don't know and so

387
00:22:23.181 --> 00:22:24.190
getting really unreasonable,

388
00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:27.470
I didn't know what the subjective intent of the officer's are turned into like

389
00:22:27.471 --> 00:22:28.304
this word,

390
00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:33.840
some objective standard where you got Jerry the lawyer for the officer's

391
00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:38.420
subjective, the justices objective, subjective dichotomy,

392
00:22:38.421 --> 00:22:42.620
but just getting super meta about what constitutes objectivity objectively

393
00:22:42.621 --> 00:22:46.430
unreasonable at subjectivity. Subjective factor have analysis,

394
00:22:46.431 --> 00:22:50.570
tests and standards, severe objective tests. The objective analysis, bad intent,

395
00:22:50.571 --> 00:22:54.710
no intent. Subjective intent. I think we're playing with words there until,

396
00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:59.010
well, one justice Thurgood Marshall,

397
00:22:59.011 --> 00:23:01.680
the Loan African-American on the court comes in and just asked

398
00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:05.950
<v 13>what reason was there for him come from the diabetic in a coma?</v>

399
00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:11.590
<v 14>Well, at the time the officers didn't know that he was a a diabetic in a coma.</v>

400
00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:12.770
The a

401
00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:16.370
<v 13>what was he doing that was so violent that he had to be a handcuff?</v>

402
00:23:18.090 --> 00:23:19.900
<v 14>Yeah, to, to go back. One step. Even before that,</v>

403
00:23:19.901 --> 00:23:24.360
officer Connor saw petitioner acting a very suspicious and unusual manner.

404
00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:28.900
Peaceful. Well, it wasn't clear. He saw him hurry into a convenience store.

405
00:23:31.210 --> 00:23:33.950
Excuse me. What did he do that was violent?

406
00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:37.270
Mr Barry's testimony? Yes.

407
00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:41.470
Petitioners on witness said that a petitioner was throwing his hands around that

408
00:23:41.471 --> 00:23:43.150
Barry had asked for officer condoms.

409
00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:47.580
<v 13>The one I'm talking about before they put handcuffs on him.</v>

410
00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:51.990
What was he doing before they tried to put, so

411
00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:55.430
<v 14>he was acting in a very bizarre manner. He ran out of the car,</v>

412
00:23:55.730 --> 00:23:59.750
circled around twice, and then sat down the district court.

413
00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:03.140
<v 13>Was that threatening anybody? Did he strike any man? Well,</v>

414
00:24:03.141 --> 00:24:06.860
the officers didn't have [inaudible] until he did he strike anybody.

415
00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:09.320
I don't believe the record indicates that he started either threatened the

416
00:24:09.321 --> 00:24:10.640
strike anybody.

417
00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:15.770
<v 14>He was acting Indian, indirectly indictable and potentially dangerous man.</v>

418
00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:18.970
<v 13>In your answer, did he threatened to strike in the body?</v>

419
00:24:19.150 --> 00:24:21.430
He did not overtly threatened to strike anyone.

420
00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:25.570
Did he have a weapon of any kind? Are the record doesn't indicate,

421
00:24:25.571 --> 00:24:28.390
I don't believe he directed. Didn't show he had a weapon to Vegas.

422
00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:31.060
That's correct. But the record, why was he handcuffed?

423
00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:36.220
<v 14>The record shows that he was properly stomped as a suspect for a criminal</v>

424
00:24:36.471 --> 00:24:38.750
investigation, that he was acting suspiciously,

425
00:24:38.751 --> 00:24:42.610
that he was acting in a bizarre manner and did even after he was handcuffed and

426
00:24:42.611 --> 00:24:44.210
the officers wanted to put him in a car,

427
00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:47.420
the undisputed record shows that he was vigorously fighting and kicking.

428
00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:48.421
<v 13>Well, she said, look,</v>

429
00:24:48.421 --> 00:24:53.421
diabetic objective being arrested rather than given treatment.

430
00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:57.170
He wasn't arrested, he was never arrested. Was He handcuffed?

431
00:24:57.510 --> 00:25:00.660
<v 14>He was handcuffed because the officers were concerned that he was a criminal</v>

432
00:25:00.661 --> 00:25:03.750
suspect. He was acting in a very unusual and erratic way.

433
00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:07.530
He was throwing his hands around and do the district court stated from the

434
00:25:07.531 --> 00:25:11.400
record that he was handcuffed in part to protect himself as well as the officers

435
00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:16.470
and all the protections that's there. The district court summarize the record,

436
00:25:16.790 --> 00:25:18.330
uh, as indicating that that's correct.

437
00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:21.860
<v 13>Now they are definitely</v>

438
00:25:24.450 --> 00:25:26.650
<v 14>now you different collusion. Um,</v>

439
00:25:28.550 --> 00:25:33.550
<v 0>when Justice Marshall said that suddenly I heard a judge</v>

440
00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:39.260
who understood our point of view,

441
00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:45.100
somebody gets it and all of a sudden I felt like I was not an idiot.

442
00:25:45.381 --> 00:25:46.214
After all.

443
00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:47.730
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

444
00:25:47.730 --> 00:25:49.320
<v 1>the court eventually puts out their opinion.</v>

445
00:25:49.321 --> 00:25:52.920
It's written by the chief justice William Rehnquist. And in that opinion,

446
00:25:52.921 --> 00:25:56.640
Rehnquist says, uh, skipping down here a little bit, um,

447
00:25:56.850 --> 00:26:00.900
claims that law enforcement officials have used excessive force in the course of

448
00:26:00.901 --> 00:26:01.321
an arrest,

449
00:26:01.321 --> 00:26:05.730
investigatory stop or other quote unquote seizure of a free citizen are most

450
00:26:05.731 --> 00:26:09.480
properly characterized as invoking the protections of the fourth amendment,

451
00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:13.500
which guarantees citizens the right to be secure in their persons against

452
00:26:13.501 --> 00:26:17.940
unreasonable seizures and must be judged by reference to the fourth amendments

453
00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.980
reasonableness standard. So they get their reasonable officer standard,

454
00:26:23.010 --> 00:26:27.420
they get it and they get it unanimously. But nothing, nothing opinion. Whoa.

455
00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:31.700
<v 0>It was a breakthrough.</v>

456
00:26:34.050 --> 00:26:37.470
<v 1>I don't think it'd be a stretch to say that at the time too.</v>

457
00:26:37.471 --> 00:26:41.310
A lot of people who were concerned about police brutality, police use force,

458
00:26:41.970 --> 00:26:44.070
it felt like this was the beginning of a new

459
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:47.520
<v 10>era that favor plaintiffs and claimants.</v>

460
00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:52.110
Because now if you were a victim of police violence and you wanted some justice,

461
00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:56.340
you had this new universal standard and objective standard where you no longer

462
00:26:56.341 --> 00:27:00.690
had to show that the officers acted maliciously or sadistically.

463
00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:02.010
You don't have to get inside the officer's head.

464
00:27:02.011 --> 00:27:03.360
You don't have to prove they had bad intent.

465
00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:06.960
You just look at the case from the facts of the case and you say what a

466
00:27:06.961 --> 00:27:09.780
reasonable officer do the same thing or not.

467
00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:12.060
And you could establish like what a reasonable officer is,

468
00:27:12.061 --> 00:27:13.950
what they would do by calling experts,

469
00:27:13.951 --> 00:27:17.100
looking at data about age and rank and experience all sorts of things.

470
00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:18.660
But the thought was that this,

471
00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:22.700
<v 1>the objectives</v>

472
00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:26.450
for the first time in hundreds of years,

473
00:27:26.451 --> 00:27:30.440
maybe they would have an objective standard that was a breakthrough.

474
00:27:33.310 --> 00:27:37.180
<v 10>So w after winning did the case get kicked back down to the circuit,</v>

475
00:27:37.181 --> 00:27:38.380
like what happens to the thorn?

476
00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:40.730
<v 0>Um, after we won in the Supreme Court,</v>

477
00:27:40.850 --> 00:27:44.150
the case went back to the trial court level for another trial.

478
00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:48.740
That was the effect of it. And so Mr. Graham had another day in court,

479
00:27:48.741 --> 00:27:50.990
another trial. We picked another jury.

480
00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:55.070
The facts were presented a better insulin reaction. Bottle of orange shoes,

481
00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:59.450
pulled him over. Unconscious handcuffed, physical altercation, broken foot,

482
00:27:59.510 --> 00:28:02.840
lacerations risks, Bruce forehead, squad, car, front yard.

483
00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:05.810
Essentially he was the guy who did nothing wrong and was beaten up.

484
00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:07.580
The case was given to the jury

485
00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.640
<v 1>as Jerry was told. Okay. Knowing what you now know,</v>

486
00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.840
take the standard as reasonable as standard and ask yourself is what happened to

487
00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:18.270
disarm Graham reasonable.

488
00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:22.011
<v 0>The jury deliberated,</v>

489
00:28:22.011 --> 00:28:26.780
came back out and laid aside in favor of the police officers. Mr. Graham lost

490
00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:30.350
<v 3>[inaudible].</v>

491
00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:31.720
<v 10>Now whether you think this is reasonable or not,</v>

492
00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:36.730
the jury really focused in on the police officer's perspective and from the

493
00:28:37.011 --> 00:28:38.030
officer's perspective,

494
00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:41.390
all they saw was a black man running in and out of convenience store.

495
00:28:41.810 --> 00:28:43.310
They thought he might be stealing something.

496
00:28:43.311 --> 00:28:46.220
They had no idea who was a diabetic. And when the police picked him up,

497
00:28:46.250 --> 00:28:48.620
he was a little bit out of control. Exactly weird.

498
00:28:48.621 --> 00:28:52.250
He's walking around the car creating trouble. Not because he's a diabetic,

499
00:28:52.251 --> 00:28:54.350
but he's a drug. Might be dangerous.

500
00:28:55.630 --> 00:28:58.940
A reasonable officer would subdue that person.

501
00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:01.253
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

502
00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:04.030
<v 1>excuse me. I'm so sorry. Oh, I'm at the door though.</v>

503
00:29:04.170 --> 00:29:06.290
Here there goes the dogs or the dogs.

504
00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:09.900
So when I talked it throw in Graham Jr he was actually moving from his home in

505
00:29:09.901 --> 00:29:11.160
St Louis. That Brian,

506
00:29:11.161 --> 00:29:14.520
I'm just going to open the garage up for this guy back to where you still had a

507
00:29:14.521 --> 00:29:18.270
lot of family in Charlotte. Okay. I'm back, hopefully. All right, cool. Okay,

508
00:29:18.271 --> 00:29:21.960
now, um, I, I was just wondering, did your dad talk about the,

509
00:29:22.170 --> 00:29:25.440
about what happened that day or did he talk about the court case at all? No,

510
00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:29.460
he didn't. It wasn't something that he talked about to thorn.

511
00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:32.500
Jeannie says that his dad was just kind of trying to get on with his life. He,

512
00:29:32.810 --> 00:29:36.150
he started making furniture in his spare time, going to church a lot,

513
00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:41.170
but he had his, he had his troubles. He had, uh, he ended up having a,

514
00:29:41.770 --> 00:29:42.400
a substance

515
00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:45.430
<v 2>abuse issues. So, uh,</v>

516
00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:49.510
and which fortunately he was able to overcome that.

517
00:29:49.511 --> 00:29:53.110
And that was after the Supreme Court case? After the, that's correct.

518
00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:53.973
That's correct.

519
00:29:54.890 --> 00:29:55.723
<v 6>Hmm.</v>

520
00:29:56.450 --> 00:29:59.210
<v 2>And so, I mean, I don't know if his,</v>

521
00:29:59.211 --> 00:30:03.500
his way of trying to deal with that was to substance abuse. I don't know.

522
00:30:04.150 --> 00:30:05.330
You know, uh, you know,

523
00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:12.850
when you are dehumanized like that, when,

524
00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:17.830
when another individual, whether they, it's, you know,

525
00:30:18.030 --> 00:30:20.950
it's, it's, it's Kinda hard to explain that. But when,

526
00:30:21.010 --> 00:30:24.700
when someone who has authority

527
00:30:26.590 --> 00:30:29.560
just, it's, it's, it's like, it's, they,

528
00:30:29.561 --> 00:30:31.750
it's like they take something away from you.

529
00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:36.580
When someone does something like that to you,

530
00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:41.170
it strikes at your core. It strikes at your very being.

531
00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:45.550
And I think you lose a part of yourself that you can't get back.

532
00:30:51.990 --> 00:30:56.230
<v 11>It's on Graham Sr died in the year 2000. He was 54 years old,</v>

533
00:30:57.640 --> 00:31:01.870
but after his death, his name lived on in this case,

534
00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:06.430
in this very weird way.

535
00:31:07.450 --> 00:31:12.280
<v 10>So 2014 rear is growing outrage tonight after an unarmed African American</v>

536
00:31:12.281 --> 00:31:16.510
teenager was shot and killed by police in the St Louis suburb of Ferguson,

537
00:31:16.511 --> 00:31:19.180
Missouri. Not far from where does Lauren Jeannie lives?

538
00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:23.740
A white officer Garren Wilson shot and killed a black teenager, Michael Brown,

539
00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:27.190
a reporter from CNN contacted me. And uh,

540
00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:32.310
he talked about how they were going to use my dad's case during that trial as a

541
00:31:32.411 --> 00:31:36.670
defense for the officer, the CNN report informing them. Do you know about this?

542
00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:38.350
No, I had no idea.

543
00:31:38.410 --> 00:31:42.910
The grand jury deliberated over two days making their final decision.

544
00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:45.040
One of the questions posted, the jury was,

545
00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:49.600
did officer Darren Wilson Act reasonably when he shot Michael Brown?

546
00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:54.310
They determined that no probable cause exists to file any charge against officer

547
00:31:54.311 --> 00:31:58.600
Wilson and return to no true bill on each of the five indictments.

548
00:31:58.690 --> 00:32:01.700
And the jury was basically like, yeah, that was reasonable.

549
00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:03.660
<v 9>That's fine. I think that the fucking</v>

550
00:32:05.490 --> 00:32:08.370
killed her baby man. Where did they

551
00:32:10.030 --> 00:32:10.863
get nobody back?

552
00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:17.430
[inaudible]

553
00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:18.480
<v 10>later that same year,</v>

554
00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:22.410
the 12 year old boy was shot and killed by two officers while holding a pellet

555
00:32:22.411 --> 00:32:23.520
gun to me race,

556
00:32:23.550 --> 00:32:27.870
we are instructed to ask what a reasonable police officer would do in this

557
00:32:27.871 --> 00:32:28.980
particular situation.

558
00:32:29.250 --> 00:32:31.800
The jury found that the officer who shot and killed the 12 year old boy,

559
00:32:31.801 --> 00:32:35.800
Tamir Rice acted reasonably and then

560
00:32:36.770 --> 00:32:40.220
<v 9>right, right, right. That Eric Gardner of grand jury in New York</v>

561
00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:44.810
<v 7>City has refused to indict yet another white police officer said to have killed</v>

562
00:32:44.811 --> 00:32:48.020
an unarmed black man. His death. What's reasonable? John Crawford,

563
00:32:48.021 --> 00:32:50.090
22 year old black man killed last month,

564
00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:53.900
reasonable carrying around the BB gun for a judge declared in this trial today,

565
00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:57.980
Samuel Dubose and the case of a white police officer who killed an unarmed black

566
00:32:57.981 --> 00:33:00.980
man, reasonable with sterling on his back. Alton Sterling,

567
00:33:01.010 --> 00:33:02.300
one officer pulls his gun,

568
00:33:03.980 --> 00:33:07.130
reasonable sterling laid dying on the street. Terence Crutcher,

569
00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:10.910
unarmed black man, reasonable shot and killed by police in Oklahoma.

570
00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:13.670
Charlotte police, Keith Lamont, Scott GMR, Clark,

571
00:33:14.110 --> 00:33:17.260
<v 9>Liz [inaudible] jail, my son,</v>

572
00:33:18.490 --> 00:33:19.480
<v 10>Philando Castiel. Reasonable.</v>

573
00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:24.390
<v 9>Oh, are you kidding me right now, we're not evolving as a sibling loss.</v>

574
00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:26.490
Say you work the Bobby,

575
00:33:26.670 --> 00:33:31.080
we're going back down to 1969 damn

576
00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:35.670
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

577
00:33:35.670 --> 00:33:38.940
<v 10>and in almost every one of those cases, Graham versus Connor,</v>

578
00:33:38.941 --> 00:33:42.750
the Supreme Court decision that many people felt was supposed to establish a new

579
00:33:42.751 --> 00:33:46.830
universal standard that would deliver justice for victims of police violence.

580
00:33:47.010 --> 00:33:51.510
And almost every one of those cases it ended up doing the exact opposite.

581
00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:56.850
It prevented the victims from getting relief and instead protected the cops.

582
00:33:56.920 --> 00:34:00.520
<v 7>One person, my colleague who covers cops describes it as like cops.</v>

583
00:34:00.550 --> 00:34:02.290
Cops see it as like their first amendment.

584
00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:07.130
<v 15>[inaudible]</v>

585
00:34:07.130 --> 00:34:09.380
<v 1>after the break we'll ask how did that happen?</v>

586
00:34:13.690 --> 00:34:14.060
<v 15>[inaudible]</v>

587
00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:15.050
<v 6>and we'll watch it happen</v>

588
00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:20.990
<v 15>[inaudible]</v>

589

600
00:35:10.071 --> 00:35:14.030
So I am just [inaudible] this podcast has,

601
00:35:14.031 --> 00:35:17.240
please subscribe where ever you get your podcasts.

602
00:35:21.550 --> 00:35:23.410
<v 1>This is more perfect. I'm Jad Abumrad.</v>

603
00:35:23.411 --> 00:35:26.370
We're featuring more perfect on Radiolab today. Uh,

604
00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:28.690
and let me just say a few words for context.

605
00:35:28.691 --> 00:35:32.200
Police officers have dangerous jobs. I think we can all agree.

606
00:35:32.201 --> 00:35:34.060
And on occasion they do have to use force.

607
00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:38.730
And we should say that the majority of the people who are killed by police every

608
00:35:38.730 --> 00:35:42.690
year are white. But if you look at the number of black people who are killed,

609
00:35:42.691 --> 00:35:47.670
and you balance that against the fact that black people only make up about 12%

610
00:35:47.671 --> 00:35:48.900
of the overall population,

611
00:35:49.710 --> 00:35:54.710
what you end up with is that an unarmed black man is roughly about seven times

612
00:35:56.401 --> 00:36:00.660
more likely to be killed by police in an unarmed white man.

613
00:36:00.661 --> 00:36:01.800
That's according to one study.

614
00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:04.950
Now these numbers are very disputed and argued about,

615
00:36:04.951 --> 00:36:09.951
but what is clear is most police officers who use deadly force are never

616
00:36:10.730 --> 00:36:15.090
charged. And the even smaller percentage serve jail time. So Matt, yes,

617
00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:16.290
Matt Kielty. Let me just ask you,

618
00:36:16.290 --> 00:36:18.570
like all the cases we heard about before the break,

619
00:36:18.571 --> 00:36:23.130
that litany of cases from the past few years in every single one of those,

620
00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:27.270
the jury was asked, did this officer behave like a reasonable officer should?

621
00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:31.980
And in every single one the jury said yes. Yeah, yeah. Why?

622
00:36:32.250 --> 00:36:35.940
Well that's, it's because, uh, the reasonable officer standard, like from,

623
00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:39.890
from the moment that it was created, uh, it was actually Kinda,

624
00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:43.320
it was constrained in a few very important ways.

625
00:36:43.510 --> 00:36:47.200
<v 12>Yeah. And actually like, um, I have here the,</v>

626
00:36:47.470 --> 00:36:51.400
the jury instructions from the ninth circuit and this is what jury members are,

627
00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:55.730
are told to think about when they have to assess this kind of use of force case.

628
00:36:56.290 --> 00:37:00.240
Yeah. Yeah. And so the jury jurors are actually told this is your job exactly.

629
00:37:00.850 --> 00:37:05.230
Prime Time Kelly prime. Yeah. So it says under the fourth amendment,

630
00:37:05.231 --> 00:37:09.480
a police officer may use only such force as objectively reasonable. Uh,

631
00:37:09.481 --> 00:37:13.240
you must judge the reasonableness of a particular use of force from the

632
00:37:13.241 --> 00:37:17.400
perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene and not with 20,

633
00:37:17.401 --> 00:37:18.660
20 vision of hindsight.

634
00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:22.540
<v 1>Those, those are, um, a couple of really crucial phrases,</v>

635
00:37:22.541 --> 00:37:25.810
which is perspective of, uh,

636
00:37:25.990 --> 00:37:27.670
an officer on the scene.

637
00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:31.540
So you have to look at it through the eyes of the officer on the scene and then

638
00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:34.870
you can't look at it through the 2020 vision of hindsight.

639
00:37:34.990 --> 00:37:37.960
So you have to put yourself in the shoes of an officer in the moment and look at

640
00:37:37.961 --> 00:37:39.040
the world through their eyes.

641
00:37:39.100 --> 00:37:42.100
And that's how you have to understand these things. And where did that,

642
00:37:42.101 --> 00:37:46.170
where did, where did that idea come from? So that comes from Graham.

643
00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:50.220
Like that comes from, uh, the chief justice, uh, William Rehnquist's, uh,

644
00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:52.600
opinion, which I have right here.

645
00:37:53.380 --> 00:37:56.920
The reasonableness of a particular use of forests must be judged from the

646
00:37:56.921 --> 00:38:01.921
perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene rather than with the 2020

647
00:38:01.991 --> 00:38:06.820
vision of hindsight. And it's calculus must embody an allowance for the fact.

648
00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.600
And this is extremely important that police officers are often forced to make

649
00:38:10.601 --> 00:38:15.490
split second decisions about the amount of force necessary in a particular

650
00:38:15.491 --> 00:38:18.270
situation. And so as you can see, this,

651
00:38:18.271 --> 00:38:23.271
this idea of reasonableness is circumscribed very tightly by time.

652
00:38:24.550 --> 00:38:27.650
It's not asking like what a reasonable officer would do here in,

653
00:38:27.651 --> 00:38:32.140
in general during a moment where, um, where they have to use force.

654
00:38:32.380 --> 00:38:33.250
Instead.

655
00:38:33.670 --> 00:38:38.170
What it's asking is what would reasonable officer do in this split second,

656
00:38:38.530 --> 00:38:42.760
in this little tiniest sliver of time where, where the force actually occurred.

657
00:38:42.970 --> 00:38:46.220
And in fact, that moment legally has come to be known, um,

658
00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:50.380
as a super seeding event. Meaning what, what does that mean? Um,

659
00:38:50.410 --> 00:38:54.490
meaning this is, I find this kind of crazy, uh, meaning that, that,

660
00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:56.620
that moment, that superseding event,

661
00:38:56.820 --> 00:39:01.480
essentially it breaks the chain of causation.

662
00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:05.560
So if, if you think of time as just this like continuous flow, this is like no,

663
00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:07.090
you break that,

664
00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:11.110
you stop that and you take this one little moment and you pluck it out and

665
00:39:11.111 --> 00:39:14.290
you're like, this moment, this is the one moment that you look at,

666
00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:16.690
that's all that they can think about the jurors, right?

667
00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:21.870
And it turns out if you ask a jury the question about use of force that way,

668
00:39:23.410 --> 00:39:27.210
about this one little moment, the Graham standard that many people thought, um,

669
00:39:27.310 --> 00:39:31.540
and hoped would, would help victims of police violence does the exact opposite.

670
00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:32.560
One person, my,

671
00:39:32.610 --> 00:39:36.070
my colleague who covers cops describes that as like cops cops see it as like

672
00:39:36.071 --> 00:39:40.690
their first amendment. They just think of it like as a shield. Yeah. Okay.

673
00:39:40.691 --> 00:39:43.410
So this is NPR reporter Kelly McEvers, um,

674
00:39:43.690 --> 00:39:48.640
host of embedded podcast and all things considered.

675
00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:50.020
So Kelly's actually a,

676
00:39:50.050 --> 00:39:53.020
she's covered police shootings for the past like year for NPR.

677
00:39:53.021 --> 00:39:56.140
And we've sorta been comparing notes with her as we've been producing our story.

678
00:39:56.500 --> 00:40:00.550
And a little while back she sent us an email basically saying that she had this

679
00:40:00.551 --> 00:40:04.330
opportunity to go and see something that most people don't get to see,

680
00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:09.540
to sort of see how cops are actually trained to understand Graham.

681
00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:14.380
And so she has this do you want in? And we were like, yeah,

682
00:40:15.380 --> 00:40:20.140
<v 17>let's go. Okay. So I went to Cleveland on,</v>

683
00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:20.610
Oh,

684
00:40:20.610 --> 00:40:25.610
you hung over cop calls get me shit started for this two day training course

685
00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:30.950
called street survival. It was in a hotel ballroom,

686
00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.940
<v 1>one of those hotel ballrooms where you have like a big conference and how many</v>

687
00:40:33.941 --> 00:40:38.920
people do you remember? Um, there was somewhere just under 200. Um, cops

688
00:40:40.330 --> 00:40:41.163
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

689
00:40:44.890 --> 00:40:48.700
<v 17>lots of really jacked dudes with tats. Mostly white.</v>

690
00:40:48.820 --> 00:40:51.920
There were some sergeants and lieutenants, rookies right out of the academy,

691
00:40:51.921 --> 00:40:54.940
some mid career guys from all over Ohio,

692
00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:58.360
Pennsylvania and they were not super happy about me being there.

693
00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:00.220
Did you get like angry stares?

694
00:41:00.250 --> 00:41:03.100
I mean in the beginning there's just like a lot of Sida

695
00:41:09.990 --> 00:41:10.090
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

696
00:41:10.090 --> 00:41:13.930
<v 18>nice. Good Morning Cleveland. How's everybody doing? All right, good.</v>

697
00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:17.800
How many of you have been to a caliber press seminar before? Please show hands.

698
00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:20.550
Let's do it this way. There's never been here before. Never been uncovered.

699
00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:23.650
Press class. Oh Wow. Good, good deal.

700
00:41:23.930 --> 00:41:27.080
<v 1>Kelly said the whole thing is put on by this company called caliber press.</v>

701
00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:29.900
It's a company that's actually been around for a really long time and they teach

702
00:41:29.901 --> 00:41:32.090
classes, classes that are aimed at police departments.

703
00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:34.040
They all from all across country and this particular

704
00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:37.310
<v 17>one we're gonna talk a lot about stress, survival instincts.</v>

705
00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:41.840
The general idea is how to survive and like make it to retirement.

706
00:41:41.930 --> 00:41:45.290
I mentioned heart attacks, emotional health, suicide,

707
00:41:45.530 --> 00:41:50.530
you know how to basically do this job and really about 24 seven survive and

708
00:41:51.801 --> 00:41:52.634
live,

709
00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:57.380
living and lasting a 25 30 year career.

710
00:41:57.560 --> 00:42:02.360
They talk a lot about self care. What do you need about sleep and exercise?

711
00:42:02.490 --> 00:42:04.260
<v 19>I remember my wife and I talked about this if,</v>

712
00:42:04.350 --> 00:42:06.440
but if I start getting crabby or is there something else there?

713
00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:09.990
<v 17>Making sure that your spouse and your family like understand the stresses of</v>

714
00:42:09.991 --> 00:42:13.110
your job and they talk about going to therapy. I mean it's like wow,

715
00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:16.790
there's times when it's this really touchy feely kind of thing.

716
00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:18.750
<v 19>I just started getting overwhelmed.</v>

717
00:42:18.751 --> 00:42:21.110
I didn't know what was happening with [inaudible].

718
00:42:21.390 --> 00:42:23.440
<v 17>There was, even though when she says, when an officer got up,</v>

719
00:42:23.860 --> 00:42:25.480
talked about contemplating suicide,

720
00:42:25.530 --> 00:42:28.500
<v 19>why? Why aren't you telling me I need you to get, Oh,</v>

721
00:42:30.170 --> 00:42:34.890
<v 17>I started secluding was, I just started alienating myself.</v>

722
00:42:35.550 --> 00:42:39.660
It was awkward hating everybody. Everyone was like crying.

723
00:42:39.661 --> 00:42:44.040
So I mean it's a really intense couple of days.

724
00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:45.600
But for our purposes,

725
00:42:45.601 --> 00:42:49.440
the reason we were there or the reason we were excited for Kelly to be there is

726
00:42:49.441 --> 00:42:53.340
that a big chunk of the class, let's talk about the,

727
00:42:53.550 --> 00:42:54.810
is devoted to cram.

728
00:42:55.960 --> 00:43:00.870
[inaudible] actually uses force that teaching these cops how to understand gram

729
00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:04.170
and, and how it impacts their lives. Um, and by the way,

730
00:43:04.171 --> 00:43:07.020
this is the instructor that like Graeme instructor, his name is Jim Glennon.

731
00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:09.210
G M self was a cop for years and years and years.

732
00:43:09.250 --> 00:43:11.490
I was in charge of use of force for 18 years.

733
00:43:11.590 --> 00:43:13.810
Was the lieutenant outside of Chicago. Yeah.

734
00:43:13.890 --> 00:43:18.340
<v 19>I tell you, we talked about brand versus Connor and our use of force, uh,</v>

735
00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:22.680
policies on a regular basis. I mean I got up four times a year and just read.

736
00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:25.740
What I would do is show a video and then let's talk about,

737
00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:27.390
or Scott or based on this video,

738
00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:30.140
<v 17>so fired up the projector.</v>

739
00:43:31.990 --> 00:43:35.990
It is really interesting to see these videos from their perspective.

740
00:43:36.050 --> 00:43:40.190
Like this one video about presto police, September,

741
00:43:40.190 --> 00:43:43.810
2015 a guy named Freddie Senteno. What are your role, Bryce and 10 oh,

742
00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:48.880
she's gone to a woman's house like to a woman's front door and threatened her

743
00:43:48.891 --> 00:43:51.890
and says he has a gun and the cops pull up, get out of their car.

744
00:43:51.891 --> 00:43:53.540
They're just like 20 feet away from Centeno.

745
00:43:53.541 --> 00:43:55.160
Who's walking towards them on the sidewalk?

746
00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:56.023
<v 9>Hey</v>

747
00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:01.690
[inaudible]

748
00:44:01.690 --> 00:44:03.490
<v 17>10 shots. Seven of them hit</v>

749
00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:08.640
<v 19>47 Frank Long. I translated wild 1.5659999999999998 sec.</v>

750
00:44:09.210 --> 00:44:12.060
<v 17>Jim's claims it happens in 1.5659999999999998 seconds.</v>

751
00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:17.090
Mentally Disabled Madness at certain times and dies in the hospital 23 days like

752
00:44:17.290 --> 00:44:20.600
and in one of these news clips that Jim shows the lawyer for Freddie Centeno,

753
00:44:20.601 --> 00:44:25.600
his family is basically just like, I'm not, you know, bat shooting. That's,

754
00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:28.020
that's an atrocity. Like this was an atrocity.

755
00:44:28.021 --> 00:44:31.530
Nothing about this use of force should be considered reasonable because the cops

756
00:44:31.531 --> 00:44:32.220
in this situation,

757
00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:34.620
<v 1>they rolled right up on Freddie Centeno. They didn't create any space.</v>

758
00:44:34.621 --> 00:44:36.140
They didn't give Freddy Centeno any time.

759
00:44:36.180 --> 00:44:40.200
<v 19>They told him get on the ground, you didn't have a chance to get on the phone.</v>

760
00:44:40.380 --> 00:44:44.100
One second before he began to fire and he gives the owners view the video shows

761
00:44:44.101 --> 00:44:47.820
the officers did not give Santana with chance to respond to their demand.

762
00:44:48.050 --> 00:44:52.190
<v 1>So Jim plays all these reaction clips and then what happens is real quick,</v>

763
00:44:52.220 --> 00:44:55.490
he plays the original body cam video again. Hey Fred, look,

764
00:44:55.730 --> 00:44:58.580
we see Freddy Centeno, they tell them to get on the ground. He doesn't.

765
00:44:58.910 --> 00:45:03.660
And then Jim slows the video down and when he does you can see Centeno.

766
00:45:03.740 --> 00:45:05.420
His right hand reaches into his pocket.

767
00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:09.090
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

768
00:45:09.090 --> 00:45:11.460
<v 1>Jim Pauses and he's like,</v>

769
00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:15.330
take a look at this right here and up on the screen.

770
00:45:15.331 --> 00:45:18.900
Jim has this frozen moment where you can see that Freddy Santana's hand has

771
00:45:18.901 --> 00:45:20.840
started to move over the banana.

772
00:45:20.850 --> 00:45:23.730
Couple of it's just starting to come up out of his pocket.

773
00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:28.500
This moment from the pocket to the out of the pocket is to, Jim was the moment.

774
00:45:28.770 --> 00:45:32.040
The moment. Remember that Tim's like, this is the only moment that matters.

775
00:45:32.041 --> 00:45:33.180
Like forget what happened before.

776
00:45:33.190 --> 00:45:35.070
Forget that the officers rolled right up on centennial.

777
00:45:35.071 --> 00:45:37.170
Forget that they weren't giving a much time or space.

778
00:45:37.620 --> 00:45:42.620
It's this moment right here when Senteno starts pulling his hand out of his

779
00:45:43.021 --> 00:45:45.150
pocket. This is the moment where you asked the question,

780
00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:48.180
what would a reasonable officer do right now?

781
00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:51.260
<v 19>This man appears to be pulling out an object from his pocket.</v>

782
00:45:51.261 --> 00:45:54.950
I can't tell what it is, and you probably can't eat it outside information.

783
00:45:55.060 --> 00:45:58.270
<v 1>Turns out he had a a nozzle from a garden hose.</v>

784
00:45:58.370 --> 00:46:02.450
<v 19>What was the call? Malaga. However you see this,</v>

785
00:46:02.451 --> 00:46:05.330
whether he started moving up or down, he doesn't go to the ground.

786
00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:09.230
He goes into his pocket and pull something out. They think it's a gun.

787
00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:10.970
Any reasonable person would think it's a gun.

788
00:46:14.290 --> 00:46:15.123
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

789
00:46:15.260 --> 00:46:19.460
<v 19>does this work under Graham? Yeah.</v>

790
00:46:19.630 --> 00:46:23.840
It's sad. Yeah, but yes. Yes, underground.

791
00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:26.130
It's fine. All right. Wait

792
00:46:26.490 --> 00:46:27.181
<v 1>for him.</v>

793
00:46:27.181 --> 00:46:31.500
He's just like over and over and overstress is what would a reasonable police

794
00:46:31.501 --> 00:46:32.340
officer do?

795
00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:36.050
<v 19>What moment do you use force in that moment? What did you know?</v>

796
00:46:36.890 --> 00:46:40.040
How would you put it on what you should, what did you know what was going on?

797
00:46:40.620 --> 00:46:41.530
Would it sets up there.

798
00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:44.540
<v 1>He talks about Rehnquist and the decision. He's like, what rank was said is,</v>

799
00:46:44.740 --> 00:46:46.680
<v 19>Oh, I was supposed to be made for the fact we stopped.</v>

800
00:46:46.750 --> 00:46:50.050
We started off with force may split second judgments in circumstances that are

801
00:46:50.051 --> 00:46:52.280
tense, uncertain, rapidly. Bobby, Bobby,

802
00:46:52.281 --> 00:46:54.520
amount of force is necessary in a particular situation.

803
00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:57.520
<v 1>This is fast. It's dynamic. It's nothing like television.</v>

804
00:46:57.521 --> 00:47:00.190
There's no five cameras on it, there's no change in the music.

805
00:47:00.191 --> 00:47:02.830
There's no upswell in the music. It's fast.

806
00:47:02.831 --> 00:47:06.070
And the court recognizes that this is an Albuquerque case.

807
00:47:06.510 --> 00:47:11.390
Jim Plays another example, a this one of the guy, white guy,

808
00:47:11.450 --> 00:47:13.130
police officer shot because they thought he had a gun.

809
00:47:13.610 --> 00:47:16.000
[inaudible] got get a knife, but the cops have gotten called in.

810
00:47:16.010 --> 00:47:20.330
He had a gun and in the split second he raised his arm like he was raising a gun

811
00:47:20.331 --> 00:47:21.590
up. And so the cop shot him.

812
00:47:21.620 --> 00:47:23.660
<v 19>Does this work under Graham? Yeah.</v>

813
00:47:23.930 --> 00:47:27.740
Another one I talked to this officer [inaudible] gets a call to be a domestic,

814
00:47:28.230 --> 00:47:31.330
<v 1>showed another video of the police shooting an unarmed white man in the head.</v>

815
00:47:31.331 --> 00:47:31.721
And again,

816
00:47:31.721 --> 00:47:34.810
he walked through it beat by beat with grant you here to put yourself in that

817
00:47:35.410 --> 00:47:38.140
officers position. Right. Said you got to look at just the superseding moment,

818
00:47:38.141 --> 00:47:41.110
forget everything else. And what you realize if you do that,

819
00:47:42.860 --> 00:47:46.700
if you forced the say a jury to look at just that one moment for getting

820
00:47:46.701 --> 00:47:50.210
everything else, just look at this one slice through the eyes of an officer.

821
00:47:51.140 --> 00:47:53.330
Then the whole concept of what is reasonable

822
00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:54.413
<v 6>shifts.</v>

823
00:47:55.200 --> 00:48:00.200
<v 1>And the only real question you can ask when the moment is so confined is did the</v>

824
00:48:00.581 --> 00:48:02.200
officer feel threatened?

825
00:48:02.650 --> 00:48:07.650
Like was the fear that that officer had a reasonable fear in that moment

826
00:48:09.230 --> 00:48:12.920
and that is a very different standard than what would he in Jerry into Thorn

827
00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:15.380
Graham had intended? Um, yeah,

828
00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:19.850
so Kelly actually told us a story that she reported for her podcast embedded

829
00:48:20.150 --> 00:48:23.180
that actually gets it some of this stuff in this particular case.

830
00:48:23.181 --> 00:48:27.560
Who was John and Farrell and what happened to them? Pharell um,

831
00:48:27.700 --> 00:48:31.500
it was a football player. He's from Florida. Is he big dude? Yes. Okay.

832
00:48:31.700 --> 00:48:33.080
He looks like a football player.

833
00:48:33.170 --> 00:48:37.040
So this was September of 2013 John Farrell is living in Charlotte,

834
00:48:37.041 --> 00:48:40.850
North Carolina. He's a black man, 24 years old and one night,

835
00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:44.090
it was a Friday night, he goes out with some friends cause that to a bar.

836
00:48:44.300 --> 00:48:46.190
He has a couple of drinks, makes his way home. You know,

837
00:48:46.191 --> 00:48:49.820
we don't exactly know what happened but well Jonathan Ferrell was making his way

838
00:48:49.821 --> 00:48:53.420
back home at some point. His car was, he lost control of his car,

839
00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:56.330
crashed in the woods off this road in suburban Charlotte.

840
00:48:56.360 --> 00:48:59.070
He didn't have his phone but he's in like this little suburban neighborhood.

841
00:48:59.071 --> 00:49:01.490
So he gets out of his car, goes up to the house of,

842
00:49:01.491 --> 00:49:05.210
this woman is knocking on her door. The woman inside, she's a white woman,

843
00:49:05.211 --> 00:49:09.110
new mom. She comes to the door thinking it's her husband who works nights.

844
00:49:09.170 --> 00:49:11.560
So she just comes to the door and she's like about to let him in and then she's

845
00:49:11.570 --> 00:49:14.600
like, Whoa, wait a second. Who is this person? Panty. She opens the doors.

846
00:49:14.601 --> 00:49:16.430
Each one of them fail and quickly closes it.

847
00:49:17.020 --> 00:49:19.420
<v 20>No one. Hello cause she calls nine one one.</v>

848
00:49:19.430 --> 00:49:23.370
I know I need help on their way to die hill and my front door.

849
00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:27.580
Is it ever hand your front door? Yeah, you can do it now

850
00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:29.860
<v 1>the woman tells the dispatcher and she doesn't know who the guy is.</v>

851
00:49:30.180 --> 00:49:33.030
<v 20>Usually the black now. Okay.</v>

852
00:49:35.300 --> 00:49:36.680
<v 1>Car alarm systems going off.</v>

853
00:49:36.820 --> 00:49:38.090
<v 20>All right. Okay. I'm my hair.</v>

854
00:49:38.580 --> 00:49:41.570
<v 1>You can hear Jonathan Ferrell screaming. Turn off the alarm.</v>

855
00:49:41.571 --> 00:49:44.870
Turn off the alarm in the background and you can hear him in the nine one one

856
00:49:44.871 --> 00:49:46.640
tape. You can like hear him banging on the door.

857
00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:48.870
<v 20>Yeah, I know who still there. Yeah.</v>

858
00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:54.900
Do you have your baby with you know, I don't know what to do.

859
00:49:55.470 --> 00:49:57.960
Okay, I'm right here. You're on our way. Okay.

860
00:49:58.660 --> 00:50:01.270
<v 1>Now we don't know why Jonathan Ferrell was banging on the door,</v>

861
00:50:01.271 --> 00:50:03.010
but very possible.

862
00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:07.790
Very likely it was just because he wrecked his car and needed some help. Right.

863
00:50:09.310 --> 00:50:12.430
So three officers get called to the scene thinking that they are going to the

864
00:50:12.431 --> 00:50:13.630
scene of a breaking and entering.

865
00:50:13.690 --> 00:50:16.290
There's a dash cam video from the squad car baloney officers.

866
00:50:16.330 --> 00:50:17.470
They've gotten a description.

867
00:50:17.500 --> 00:50:20.350
It's an African American man with green shirt and light pants.

868
00:50:20.410 --> 00:50:22.570
So this officer is driving down this road, driving, driving,

869
00:50:22.571 --> 00:50:25.930
driving until finally you see an African American man in the green shirt and

870
00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:28.010
light pants walking on the side of the road. He's

871
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:29.390
<v 21>walking towards the squad cars.</v>

872
00:50:29.420 --> 00:50:32.280
You see the red light of a teaser on his [inaudible]

873
00:50:32.350 --> 00:50:35.980
<v 1>chest and then fail just like takes off.</v>

874
00:50:35.981 --> 00:50:38.020
One of the officers is yelling at him to get on the ground.

875
00:50:39.240 --> 00:50:43.020
The fuel keeps running, runs off camera, can't see what happens next. But then,

876
00:50:43.060 --> 00:50:43.893
yeah,

877
00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:51.273
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

878
00:50:51.430 --> 00:50:54.670
<v 1>one of the officer's fires, 12 shots, 10 of them straight, John Farrell,</v>

879
00:50:55.150 --> 00:50:56.020
he falls to the ground. Okay,

880
00:50:56.330 --> 00:50:58.160
<v 6>well dot. Black dot slide</v>

881
00:51:03.550 --> 00:51:04.460
<v 1>and he dies.</v>

882
00:51:06.530 --> 00:51:09.680
The facts of this case are that here's a guy who was unarmed,

883
00:51:09.681 --> 00:51:14.330
who did nothing wrong, and then he was killed like plain and simple. If you,

884
00:51:14.570 --> 00:51:18.530
if you asked was that reasonable on some basic level, no,

885
00:51:18.770 --> 00:51:23.060
it was not reasonable. This man should not have died. But in the trial,

886
00:51:23.061 --> 00:51:26.990
this case did go to a trial, a jury trial. The jury was instructed,

887
00:51:26.991 --> 00:51:30.650
forget everything. But that moment of force, like no 2020 hindsight,

888
00:51:30.651 --> 00:51:34.250
look at just the super moment and then ask the question again.

889
00:51:34.580 --> 00:51:38.990
Was it reasonable for the officer to pull the trigger? I. E.

890
00:51:38.990 --> 00:51:41.960
Was it reasonable for that officer to be afraid?

891
00:51:45.750 --> 00:51:49.170
And the officer who shot and killed Jonathan Ferrell who was facing charges,

892
00:51:49.171 --> 00:51:52.830
his name was Randall Kerrick. He was being tried for voluntary manslaughter.

893
00:51:53.140 --> 00:51:56.350
<v 21>The suspect began aggressively coming towards me.</v>

894
00:51:56.710 --> 00:51:57.760
And during the course of this trial,

895
00:51:57.761 --> 00:52:02.230
officer Kerrick took the stand and could you tell the jury about what pace he

896
00:52:02.231 --> 00:52:07.030
was coming at you? At first it was a pretty rapid pace,

897
00:52:07.270 --> 00:52:09.850
more more of a fast walk.

898
00:52:10.510 --> 00:52:14.410
I gave loud verbal commands for him to stop and get on the ground.

899
00:52:14.980 --> 00:52:16.600
How loud were your verbal commands?

900
00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:20.040
Very loud tells you,

901
00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:23.200
show the jury how loud you were yelling to the suspect and what you were yelling

902
00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:24.153
to the suspect.

903
00:52:28.130 --> 00:52:28.420
<v 22>[inaudible]</v>

904
00:52:28.420 --> 00:52:32.950
<v 21>so he says he was running at him and this is a huge question.</v>

905
00:52:33.220 --> 00:52:36.280
Was he running at him or was he running away from it?

906
00:52:36.460 --> 00:52:38.500
I tried to run past him by him. Yeah.

907
00:52:39.010 --> 00:52:41.080
Like if you sort of diagram the whole thing out,

908
00:52:41.081 --> 00:52:44.350
the way the cop cars were parked, the way Kerrick was standing,

909
00:52:44.920 --> 00:52:48.970
it is possible that Jonathan Ferrell was trying to sort of run between the mall.

910
00:52:49.090 --> 00:52:51.430
<v 1>That's what the prosecution was saying. The defense was like, no, no, no, no.</v>

911
00:52:51.431 --> 00:52:53.260
He was running at the cops.

912
00:52:53.430 --> 00:52:56.190
<v 21>Did the suspect say anything to you? No Sir.</v>

913
00:52:57.100 --> 00:53:02.100
Where did you interpret his body language to mean he was going to attack me.

914
00:53:04.620 --> 00:53:07.290
He was gonna assault me. Who's going to take my gun from me?

915
00:53:09.120 --> 00:53:13.230
Did you have time to holster your weapon? No, sir.

916
00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:19.400
And here I was suspect matched the description and he just ran through a taser,

917
00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:23.700
which at the time I felt was had, had worked.

918
00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:28.760
I felt the Taser had struck and made contact and I had absolutely no idea if he

919
00:53:29.311 --> 00:53:33.810
had a weapon on him or not. And was he ever, was the suspect ever still?

920
00:53:34.410 --> 00:53:38.820
No Sir. Did he continue to advance on you?

921
00:53:39.270 --> 00:53:42.870
Yes sir. I met her. What I did, he wouldn't stop.

922
00:53:43.230 --> 00:53:47.340
I wasn't sure how many rounds I had fired. None of them affected him in any way,

923
00:53:47.400 --> 00:53:49.620
any way. I didn't think my gun was working.

924
00:53:50.910 --> 00:53:54.950
I thought I was gonna die because nothing I would do would stop him.

925
00:53:55.350 --> 00:53:57.930
What was the reason that you continue to fire your weapon?

926
00:53:58.980 --> 00:54:02.340
Because he wouldn't stop. He kept trying to get to my gun.

927
00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:06.890
<v 17>To boil it down, the question was,</v>

928
00:54:07.220 --> 00:54:10.130
was it reasonable for officer Carrick to feel afraid?

929
00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:13.940
And after 11 days of testimony, the question was put to the jury,

930
00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:16.430
there were six opinions. One way there were six another.

931
00:54:16.700 --> 00:54:20.420
When they first go into the jury room, it was six to six on one side,

932
00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:22.550
a white guy named Bruce Raffey.

933
00:54:22.580 --> 00:54:24.980
We were sitting in that courtroom and we were sitting in that,

934
00:54:25.010 --> 00:54:28.670
that jury deliberation room was no bigger than this living room. Okay.

935
00:54:29.180 --> 00:54:33.350
And it's hot. We're arguing where it's, it's,

936
00:54:33.351 --> 00:54:35.690
it's going nowhere. And so the more it went on,

937
00:54:35.691 --> 00:54:38.660
this went on for days and he's sort of the leading the charge on that.

938
00:54:38.661 --> 00:54:40.160
We have to acquit Kerrick side.

939
00:54:40.550 --> 00:54:43.160
He felt that officer Kerrick had every right to be afraid.

940
00:54:43.490 --> 00:54:46.040
And he told Kelly that Jonathan Ferrell, the guy who Karen shot.

941
00:54:46.070 --> 00:54:49.730
So what Bruce Raffy saying to me like, you know, he was a young man, distraught,

942
00:54:50.090 --> 00:54:53.720
disheveled, confused, angry, if you will.

943
00:54:53.780 --> 00:54:57.980
He made a very aggressive move towards these police officers after disobeying

944
00:54:57.981 --> 00:54:58.814
commands,

945
00:54:58.970 --> 00:55:02.450
you have many choices in this video and it was clear from the very first time I

946
00:55:02.451 --> 00:55:05.360
viewed it, stop, sit down, put your hands up,

947
00:55:05.510 --> 00:55:08.240
do any of those things other than what you chose to do,

948
00:55:08.270 --> 00:55:11.980
which was to charge the officer character. And so there,

949
00:55:12.260 --> 00:55:15.860
there's no other way around. What I saw and it kept coming back to that,

950
00:55:16.160 --> 00:55:18.290
and this is exactly how the defense painted it, right?

951
00:55:18.291 --> 00:55:21.950
This case is not about race. This case is about choices.

952
00:55:22.310 --> 00:55:25.700
And that stuck in Bruce Rafferty's mind so that when he was asked was it

953
00:55:25.701 --> 00:55:28.910
reasonable for character, shoot him. It's like,

954
00:55:28.911 --> 00:55:31.250
Well Yeah Cause Jonathan Ferrell made all these bad choices.

955
00:55:31.490 --> 00:55:33.380
This is an old trick from,

956
00:55:33.560 --> 00:55:38.150
from from defense attorneys is another one that chairs that Kelly spoke to named

957
00:55:38.151 --> 00:55:40.370
Moses Wilson, an African American man.

958
00:55:40.440 --> 00:55:42.240
<v 23>He wasn't supposed to be here.</v>

959
00:55:43.080 --> 00:55:45.840
He might've had a few drinks where he was.

960
00:55:46.290 --> 00:55:49.230
The police responded to what he caused.

961
00:55:50.070 --> 00:55:54.870
This was early in the morning. This was bar from where he lived.

962
00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:57.360
This was this,

963
00:55:57.510 --> 00:56:02.510
this was that which caused me at the end to write on the board just what did he

964
00:56:04.201 --> 00:56:06.690
do to deserve to be shot.

965
00:56:06.691 --> 00:56:11.691
So many times I notice in the jury room I wrote this on the board.

966
00:56:13.410 --> 00:56:15.090
What did he do

967
00:56:21.130 --> 00:56:22.490
<v 17>well, so what happens with the jury?</v>

968
00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:28.450
<v 11>It's blitz. Eventually Italians eat to acquit for to convict eight jurors.</v>

969
00:56:28.451 --> 00:56:32.260
Most of them wait side with acquitting carer and four jurors,

970
00:56:32.290 --> 00:56:35.680
most of them people of Color side with convicting Kerrick

971
00:56:35.800 --> 00:56:39.220
<v 17>breaking news. In the trial of officer Randall Kerrick,</v>

972
00:56:39.250 --> 00:56:42.750
the judge has just declared a mistrial this after

973
00:56:43.150 --> 00:56:47.230
<v 11>2015 the city of Charlotte settled the lawsuit with John Farrell's family for</v>

974
00:56:47.260 --> 00:56:50.860
2.2 $5 million. Later that same year,

975
00:56:50.861 --> 00:56:52.930
officer Kerrick resigned from the Charlotte Police Department.

976
00:56:53.440 --> 00:56:58.440
The city paid out $179,989 and 59 cents the money was for back pay,

977
00:57:00.440 --> 00:57:02.080
Kerrick, social security and retirement.

978
00:57:02.350 --> 00:57:05.770
And an attorney that represented him in a separate civil suit. Yeah.

979
00:57:06.040 --> 00:57:09.310
There's something interesting about listening to Moses talk,

980
00:57:09.370 --> 00:57:14.370
just what did he do to deserve to be shot so many times because it feels like

981
00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:18.670
this, um, fourth amendment reasonableness standard,

982
00:57:18.671 --> 00:57:21.930
this reasonable officer standard. Like what, from what I understand is,

983
00:57:21.931 --> 00:57:25.120
is that it was an attempt to really kind of

984
00:57:26.890 --> 00:57:28.990
look at these situations, these shootings,

985
00:57:29.350 --> 00:57:34.120
these uses of force cases through this sort of objective lens where you're just

986
00:57:34.121 --> 00:57:36.980
looking at all the facts on the ground. Um,

987
00:57:37.540 --> 00:57:40.870
and yet the cases don't seem to be tied to it. Like any sort of objectivity.

988
00:57:41.050 --> 00:57:43.750
Yeah. There's something about hearing Moses where you're like, oh,

989
00:57:43.751 --> 00:57:48.160
that's actually like, that feels like a pure sort of objectivity.

990
00:57:48.790 --> 00:57:53.020
Like what, what did, what had this guy done? He hadn't actually done anything.

991
00:57:53.021 --> 00:57:56.150
He ran it. Somebody maybe, but that was [inaudible].

992
00:57:56.780 --> 00:58:01.660
<v 17>Yeah. And like if this is the thing,</v>

993
00:58:01.960 --> 00:58:03.340
like if you're white,

994
00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:07.030
are you more likely to say yes,

995
00:58:07.031 --> 00:58:10.870
that was reasonable because he's white and he was afraid of a black man, right.

996
00:58:11.290 --> 00:58:12.790
Like that is the question.

997
00:58:15.120 --> 00:58:18.150
<v 1>I don't know, given the history of our country, I'd say in many cases,</v>

998
00:58:18.151 --> 00:58:19.320
that's not even a question.

999
00:58:19.690 --> 00:58:20.523
<v 24>Right.</v>

1000
00:58:21.130 --> 00:58:22.830
<v 1>But I guess the question I'm actually left with is</v>

1001
00:58:24.230 --> 00:58:27.140
<v 11>if this is where the reasonableness standard has lettuce,</v>

1002
00:58:27.950 --> 00:58:32.390
<v 1>is there another standard? I think that's right. This is woody canet again,</v>

1003
00:58:32.391 --> 00:58:35.530
he represented to Thorne Graham in that original case. Um,

1004
00:58:35.600 --> 00:58:36.920
when you see it applied,

1005
00:58:36.921 --> 00:58:41.750
you wonder whether or not this is the best dander or there might be something

1006
00:58:41.751 --> 00:58:46.550
better. I just don't have an answer to that. I, I would,

1007
00:58:46.580 --> 00:58:50.300
I would suggest a whole more radical standard that this is an Ellie Ms Dahl,

1008
00:58:50.301 --> 00:58:54.950
more perfect legal editor. Uh, we ended up talking with him about this, uh,

1009
00:58:55.970 --> 00:59:00.560
shortly after the Philando Casteel Vardy came out. So he was, uh,

1010
00:59:00.680 --> 00:59:03.020
well that was a tough pill for him and many people to swallow.

1011
00:59:03.050 --> 00:59:07.610
I would suggest that they have to be, the cops have to be right. In fact,

1012
00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:10.640
which is something we usually do not apply to the law. What does that mean?

1013
00:59:10.641 --> 00:59:15.410
Like from a, in a, in the scenario of a police person who's, does that mean?

1014
00:59:15.411 --> 00:59:17.900
Like I need to be right that you don't have a toy gun.

1015
00:59:18.230 --> 00:59:19.520
Is that that's what you mean? Yeah.

1016
00:59:19.580 --> 00:59:21.950
So if you shoot me because you think have a gun. I had

1017
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:26.270
<v 25>best have a gun and if I don't have a gun your ass is going to jail cause you</v>

1018
00:59:26.271 --> 00:59:28.190
were wrong. I don't care if you really thought so.

1019
00:59:28.300 --> 00:59:30.200
I don't care if I was telling you I had a gun. If I,

1020
00:59:30.290 --> 00:59:34.520
if you are not right in fact then you have to go to jail.

1021
00:59:34.730 --> 00:59:35.610
I think that is,

1022
00:59:35.690 --> 00:59:39.860
that would be a standard that would allow us to prosecute these police officers

1023
00:59:40.010 --> 00:59:42.710
but then a police person is gonna just gonna argue that like you don't

1024
00:59:42.711 --> 00:59:44.450
understand the pressures that are under,

1025
00:59:44.451 --> 00:59:47.630
it's a split second decision Monday morning quarterbacking.

1026
00:59:47.690 --> 00:59:49.040
If you do what you just said,

1027
00:59:49.041 --> 00:59:51.840
we're not going to be able to do our jobs and I would say pupil, he's officer,

1028
00:59:51.841 --> 00:59:54.960
I'm sick of you. I would say screw you. You have had your chance,

1029
00:59:55.520 --> 01:00:00.520
you've had your chance to police my community without murdering us and you have

1030
01:00:00.691 --> 01:00:02.790
failed for 300 years. Enough.

1031
01:00:03.900 --> 01:00:08.040
That's what I would say to that more people might get hurt if I wasn't,

1032
01:00:08.310 --> 01:00:12.390
I'm willing to risk that. I'm willing to try it that way then. Gotcha.

1033
01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:13.410
I'd rather,

1034
01:00:13.411 --> 01:00:18.411
I'd rather 10 illegal shoplifting people go free than one illegal shoplifting

1035
01:00:23.791 --> 01:00:27.240
person get shot in the street like an animal. Gotcha.

1036
01:00:27.420 --> 01:00:29.250
If you want to talk about changing the standards,

1037
01:00:29.251 --> 01:00:30.990
that is a standard change that could help.

1038
01:00:31.900 --> 01:00:33.730
<v 1>Yeah. That is, as Ellie said,</v>

1039
01:00:34.210 --> 01:00:39.210
radical and probably not realistic given that most Americans,

1040
01:00:39.581 --> 01:00:43.510
according to polls respect the police, have confidence in the police,

1041
01:00:43.900 --> 01:00:46.450
perceive police to be, you know, the enforcers of the law.

1042
01:00:46.990 --> 01:00:51.460
But there are other ideas out there that are starting to bubble up.

1043
01:00:51.700 --> 01:00:55.300
And if what's constraining us, if what's keeping us stuck where we are,

1044
01:00:55.301 --> 01:00:56.590
are the words of gram,

1045
01:00:57.370 --> 01:01:02.020
then what offers us a way out could actually also be hiding in there.

1046
01:01:02.670 --> 01:01:03.960
What do you mean? Okay,

1047
01:01:03.961 --> 01:01:08.400
so you know how I'm chief justice Rehnquist when he wrote the decision in eating

1048
01:01:08.401 --> 01:01:10.860
nine, he put in a,

1049
01:01:10.930 --> 01:01:15.270
all these phrases that took the idea of a reasonable officer and constrained it.

1050
01:01:15.271 --> 01:01:18.050
So, uh, these were like, um,

1051
01:01:18.090 --> 01:01:21.150
it's constrained only to this little moment in time.

1052
01:01:21.151 --> 01:01:24.210
It's constrained to the perspective of the officers constrained that there's no

1053
01:01:24.211 --> 01:01:28.260
20, 20 hindsight, all of that stuff. Well, in the decision he also,

1054
01:01:28.430 --> 01:01:31.130
he slipped in this other phrase, uh,

1055
01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:35.520
he was actually calling back to an earlier decision and what he wrote was,

1056
01:01:37.110 --> 01:01:41.790
um, the question is whether the detached duty of circumstances justifies a

1057
01:01:41.791 --> 01:01:45.060
particular sort of seizure, but totality of circumstances,

1058
01:01:45.061 --> 01:01:46.850
totality of circumstances, which, you know,

1059
01:01:46.851 --> 01:01:51.720
it seems to be at odds with all of the other stuff. Right.

1060
01:01:51.721 --> 01:01:53.640
Which is all about like little slivers in moments. Yeah.

1061
01:01:53.650 --> 01:01:56.970
It's about all these little tiny little bits of time where it's Italian.

1062
01:01:56.971 --> 01:02:01.050
He seems to be suggesting that this is like this is the whole thing.

1063
01:02:02.310 --> 01:02:04.590
So he had both, both ideas in there at once. Yeah.

1064
01:02:04.591 --> 01:02:09.510
Which is why right now you see the lower courts are arguing about what this

1065
01:02:09.511 --> 01:02:10.650
phrase actually means.

1066
01:02:10.651 --> 01:02:13.560
And so half of the circuits are saying kind of like everything that we've

1067
01:02:13.561 --> 01:02:14.310
already talked about,

1068
01:02:14.310 --> 01:02:18.780
which is that all the totality of circumstances means is that you look at,

1069
01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:20.010
to answer the

1070
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:22.110
<v 10>question, was the officer's scared?</v>

1071
01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:24.510
You look at everything that the officer would have known,

1072
01:02:24.511 --> 01:02:28.080
everything the officer would've seen perceived and then you ask, okay,

1073
01:02:28.081 --> 01:02:31.380
knowing all that, was it reasonable for the officer to be scared in the moment?

1074
01:02:31.710 --> 01:02:33.550
The other half of the circuit say no, no.

1075
01:02:33.570 --> 01:02:37.650
A totality of circumstances isn't just about what the officer knew,

1076
01:02:37.651 --> 01:02:40.420
what the officers saw and how it answers the moment to tell.

1077
01:02:40.710 --> 01:02:42.120
He means like totality,

1078
01:02:43.020 --> 01:02:46.560
like what did the officer do leading up to the moment,

1079
01:02:46.561 --> 01:02:49.530
did the officer try to get a search warrant?

1080
01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:53.340
Did the officer tried to deescalate the situation before using force?

1081
01:02:53.341 --> 01:02:56.370
Did the officer tried to subdue the person before you using deadly force?

1082
01:02:56.400 --> 01:03:01.400
Like suddenly all those things that are usually kept out of the frame maybe can

1083
01:03:02.101 --> 01:03:03.270
be let back in

1084
01:03:06.090 --> 01:03:06.520
<v 6>[inaudible].</v>

1085
01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:10.470
<v 10>The Supreme Court so far has shown no interest in really non this in trying to</v>

1086
01:03:10.471 --> 01:03:11.304
sort this out,

1087
01:03:12.060 --> 01:03:16.830
but they might because the argument is happening in the lower courts.

1088
01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:18.240
So in,

1089
01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:23.010
in a way we're kind of living at a time very much like 1984 when the thorn

1090
01:03:23.250 --> 01:03:27.760
Graham got pulled over outside of convenience store in Charlotte waiting to see

1091
01:03:27.761 --> 01:03:31.690
whether it matters that the thorn Graham wasn't trying to steal anything,

1092
01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:35.830
that he was just a diabetic trying to get some orange juice.

1093
01:03:43.020 --> 01:03:43.170
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

1094
01:03:43.170 --> 01:03:46.620
<v 10>did what happened to your dad affect how you thought of police?</v>

1095
01:03:46.621 --> 01:03:48.900
How you thought of police at being, being a black man?

1096
01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:53.680
<v 2>Well, you know, believe it or not, uh, it didn't.</v>

1097
01:03:54.580 --> 01:03:57.910
Uh hmm. Why is that? I like to base my

1098
01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:03.700
opinions based on my own experiences.

1099
01:04:04.390 --> 01:04:07.030
My Dad, I, I can say this, Kelly and Matt,

1100
01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:12.520
I can remember my dad telling me stories of where he grew up in eastern North

1101
01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:17.170
Carolina owned a tobacco farm in that small town.

1102
01:04:17.350 --> 01:04:22.350
I can remember him telling me a story of a black man who had been accused of,

1103
01:04:25.390 --> 01:04:28.120
uh, being inappropriate with a white woman.

1104
01:04:29.110 --> 01:04:33.810
And how the whites got him in broad daylight and castrate a human broad day

1105
01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:36.780
light. And, and,

1106
01:04:36.850 --> 01:04:41.850
and I say that in saying that although he experienced all that stuff growing up

1107
01:04:43.330 --> 01:04:45.550
and the racism that he experienced growing up,

1108
01:04:46.330 --> 01:04:49.450
he didn't teach that to us. He didn't teach that to us.

1109
01:04:49.451 --> 01:04:52.480
He taught us to love people for people.

1110
01:04:52.900 --> 01:04:55.450
So even now myself,

1111
01:04:56.050 --> 01:04:58.360
I base my experience of a person.

1112
01:04:58.540 --> 01:05:03.340
I base my experience of the police based on my dealings with the police.

1113
01:05:03.630 --> 01:05:04.900
And, and not that I won't,

1114
01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:09.730
but I have yet to encounter a police officer who's been mean to me,

1115
01:05:09.731 --> 01:05:12.550
who's been rude to me, who's mistreated me.

1116
01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:17.020
And that's the God's honest truth without button and being completely,

1117
01:05:17.950 --> 01:05:22.210
when I see on the news, like the kid in the 12 year old in,

1118
01:05:22.990 --> 01:05:26.320
uh, that had to BB gun, Tamir Rice. Yeah. Yeah. You know,

1119
01:05:26.740 --> 01:05:29.290
examples like this, that, that,

1120
01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:32.470
that does affect me and that does make me,

1121
01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:35.200
does that make you think of your own children? Have you talked to your own kids?

1122
01:05:35.250 --> 01:05:38.080
Of course. I've got a course. I've got a 12 year old at home.

1123
01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:43.050
He's got BB guns that look just like real guns and you know, but he, he,

1124
01:05:43.051 --> 01:05:47.140
he knows that hey, they don't leave the house. What's your,

1125
01:05:47.141 --> 01:05:51.190
what's your 12 year olds name? Uh, my son's name is Tanner. Tanner.

1126
01:05:51.940 --> 01:05:52.421
And when you,

1127
01:05:52.421 --> 01:05:56.500
when you talked to Tanner about the fact that like the BB gun doesn't leave the

1128
01:05:56.501 --> 01:05:57.041
house. I mean,

1129
01:05:57.041 --> 01:06:00.640
what is that conversation like with the Tamir Rice when he was shot and killed

1130
01:06:00.710 --> 01:06:04.780
when the news story came on? I pause it and you need to do a lot of TV now.

1131
01:06:04.990 --> 01:06:09.070
Say come here. What? I want you to watch this right now. Tanner is 12 years old.

1132
01:06:09.071 --> 01:06:12.730
He's cute, he's this, he's that. But the fact of the matter,

1133
01:06:12.780 --> 01:06:15.760
he is in a few, few short years,

1134
01:06:16.030 --> 01:06:20.470
he would be considered a black man. Unfortunately,

1135
01:06:20.950 --> 01:06:25.360
he's going to have a target on himself. So, hey,

1136
01:06:25.370 --> 01:06:29.620
those BB guns you got, see this is why you can't take these out of the house.

1137
01:06:29.621 --> 01:06:31.240
I don't want you to take these out of the house.

1138
01:06:31.510 --> 01:06:35.680
Even if you're outside in New York plane and a police should happen to come down

1139
01:06:35.681 --> 01:06:39.910
the road. Hey, drop it, drop it immediately.

1140
01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:46.233
<v 6>Uh,</v>

1141
01:06:46.670 --> 01:06:51.540
<v 7>conduct including three. Katie's reasonable.</v>

1142
01:06:51.750 --> 01:06:56.750
This story was produced and reported by Matt Kielty with a big assist from Kelly

1143
01:06:59.750 --> 01:07:03.030
[inaudible] behavior. [inaudible] not reasonableness requirement.

1144
01:07:03.150 --> 01:07:06.760
They have to know they have to deal with leading three people.

1145
01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:09.570
Where do you think that would be? Reasonable Execution

1146
01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:16.380
[inaudible] unreasonable whether objective journalism behavior alone is enough.

1147
01:07:16.890 --> 01:07:20.550
How would a reasonable person has felt liners that make it an unreasonable

1148
01:07:20.551 --> 01:07:24.840
search as opposed to val lists? Because if he goes first in usually person,

1149
01:07:24.841 --> 01:07:27.620
they reasonable, but the things, this is a burglary was on release.

1150
01:07:28.530 --> 01:07:31.720
What would a reasonable person believe?
