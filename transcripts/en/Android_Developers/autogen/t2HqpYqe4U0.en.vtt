lot of times when you're looking at your
 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:28.839
lot of times when you're looking at your
statistics craft wonder why did that go

00:05:28.839 --> 00:05:28.849
statistics craft wonder why did that go
 

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:30.850
statistics craft wonder why did that go
up I had a certain number of users and

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:30.860
up I had a certain number of users and
 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.279
up I had a certain number of users and
then it went up or I had a rating and

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:33.289
then it went up or I had a rating and
 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:34.809
then it went up or I had a rating and
then it just dipped all of a sudden and

00:05:34.809 --> 00:05:34.819
then it just dipped all of a sudden and
 

00:05:34.819 --> 00:05:36.850
then it just dipped all of a sudden and
a lot of times that's because you've

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:36.860
a lot of times that's because you've
 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:38.320
a lot of times that's because you've
released a new version maybe that new

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:38.330
released a new version maybe that new
 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.120
released a new version maybe that new
version has different functionality

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:40.130
version has different functionality
 

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:41.620
version has different functionality
maybe you fix some bugs and that caused

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:41.630
maybe you fix some bugs and that caused
 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:42.969
maybe you fix some bugs and that caused
your rating to go up and so now we have

think the general thing that we're
 

00:13:09.510 --> 00:13:11.829
think the general thing that we're
trying to encourage developers to do is

00:13:11.829 --> 00:13:11.839
trying to encourage developers to do is
 

00:13:11.839 --> 00:13:14.509

only show the relevant information based
on where the use of focusing kind of try

00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:16.350
on where the use of focusing kind of try

and then start showing them additional
 

00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:24.110
and then start showing them additional
information depending on where they're

00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:24.120
information depending on where they're
 

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:25.460
information depending on where they're

using left nav bar the biggest thing is
 

00:13:35.519 --> 00:13:37.430
using left nav bar the biggest thing is
to try and avoid that navigation trap

00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:37.440
to try and avoid that navigation trap
 

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:39.230

list view etc it's going to run into
 

00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:45.980
list view etc it's going to run into
problems yeah fine we don't have a

00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:45.990
problems yeah fine we don't have a
 

00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:48.079

perfect solution I have played with some

00:13:48.079 --> 00:13:48.089

on Google TV we started playing around

00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:56.760
on Google TV we started playing around
 

00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:58.130

with the idea of having the menu button

00:13:58.130 --> 00:13:58.140
with the idea of having the menu button
 

00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:00.710
with the idea of having the menu button
to kind of slide it open and close it

00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:00.720
to kind of slide it open and close it
 

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:05.000
to kind of slide it open and close it
which is an okay design paradigm but

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:05.010
which is an okay design paradigm but
 

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:06.350
which is an okay design paradigm but
obviously you have to kind of train the

00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:06.360
obviously you have to kind of train the
 

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:07.730
obviously you have to kind of train the
easy to do it and then you start running

00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:07.740
easy to do it and then you start running
 

00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:09.949
easy to do it and then you start running
into issues of is that the right thing

00:14:09.949 --> 00:14:09.959
into issues of is that the right thing
 

00:14:09.959 --> 00:14:12.439
into issues of is that the right thing
or not and it kind of starts going

00:14:12.439 --> 00:14:12.449
or not and it kind of starts going
 

00:14:12.449 --> 00:14:13.880
or not and it kind of starts going
against I think the way you'd use it on

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:13.890
against I think the way you'd use it on
 

00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:16.550
against I think the way you'd use it on
tablets lower those cuz then well the

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:16.560
tablets lower those cuz then well the
 

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:18.079
tablets lower those cuz then well the
default thing is you can actually make

00:14:18.079 --> 00:14:18.089
default thing is you can actually make
 

00:14:18.089 --> 00:14:20.540
default thing is you can actually make
it so that when you focus to the left

00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:20.550
it so that when you focus to the left
 

00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:21.829
it so that when you focus to the left
and then you get to the point beyond the

00:14:21.829 --> 00:14:21.839
and then you get to the point beyond the
 

00:14:21.839 --> 00:14:23.329
and then you get to the point beyond the
edge of screen it'll open it for you and

00:14:23.329 --> 00:14:23.339
edge of screen it'll open it for you and
 

00:14:23.339 --> 00:14:25.100
edge of screen it'll open it for you and
then when you focus out it will close it

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:25.110
then when you focus out it will close it
 

00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:28.759

actually a hole in your view hierarchy
 

00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:03.910
actually a hole in your view hierarchy
and the reason we do this is because

on and so forth and but yeah the
consequence of that is that it's not a

00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:18.870
consequence of that is that it's not a
 

00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:21.080
consequence of that is that it's not a

end to my application I couldn't found

00:22:06.910 --> 00:22:06.920
end to my application I couldn't found
 

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:09.160

and there is some way to hack apt to do

00:22:12.610 --> 00:22:12.620
and there is some way to hack apt to do
 

00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:14.140
and there is some way to hack apt to do
that but it was something that I can

00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:14.150
that but it was something that I can
 

00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:15.850
