okay so I i found an umbrella because

00:14:58.730 --> 00:14:58.740
okay so I i found an umbrella because
 

00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:00.230
okay so I i found an umbrella because
you know when anything's under an

00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:00.240
you know when anything's under an
 

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:02.930
you know when anything's under an
umbrella it could be a lot of different

00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:02.940
umbrella it could be a lot of different
 

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:05.120
umbrella it could be a lot of different
things that we put under the umbrella of

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:05.130
things that we put under the umbrella of
 

00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:08.020
things that we put under the umbrella of
so i decided to use an umbrella as my

00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:08.030
so i decided to use an umbrella as my
 

00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:10.730
so i decided to use an umbrella as my
gerontology illustration and underneath

00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:10.740
gerontology illustration and underneath
 

00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:12.980
gerontology illustration and underneath
that looking at the different aspects of

00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:12.990
that looking at the different aspects of
 

00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:15.590
that looking at the different aspects of
it i saw that the handle of the umbrella

00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:15.600
it i saw that the handle of the umbrella
 

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:19.460
it i saw that the handle of the umbrella
is the geriatrics component because if

00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:19.470
is the geriatrics component because if
 

00:15:19.470 --> 00:15:21.530
is the geriatrics component because if
you don't have I don't think that they

then all of these these other things on
what you have to work on with the help

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:33.690
what you have to work on with the help
 

00:15:33.690 --> 00:15:36.410
what you have to work on with the help
you have to be how work on your health

we're based on 80 years

78 80 but keep in mind that some people
 

00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:27.710
78 80 but keep in mind that some people
are not going to have this because we

00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:27.720
are not going to have this because we
 

00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:30.020
are not going to have this because we
now have a generation that exercises a

00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:30.030
now have a generation that exercises a
 

00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:31.690
now have a generation that exercises a
lot more so we're going to see some

00:28:31.690 --> 00:28:31.700
lot more so we're going to see some
 

00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:34.670

seen now so you've got there is a

00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:39.030
seen now so you've got there is a
 

00:28:39.030 --> 00:28:40.700
seen now so you've got there is a
decrease in height because you've got

00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:40.710
decrease in height because you've got
 

00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:42.770
decrease in height because you've got
the vertebral column and you have these

00:28:42.770 --> 00:28:42.780
the vertebral column and you have these
 

00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:45.920
the vertebral column and you have these
pads and these pads start to dry a

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:45.930
pads and these pads start to dry a
 

00:28:45.930 --> 00:28:48.020
pads and these pads start to dry a
little bit and as they dry they compress

00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:48.030
little bit and as they dry they compress
 

00:28:48.030 --> 00:28:51.290
little bit and as they dry they compress
and as they compress fractions of inches

00:28:51.290 --> 00:28:51.300
and as they compress fractions of inches

diminished from your height so that's

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:54.210
diminished from your height so that's
 

00:28:54.210 --> 00:28:56.330
diminished from your height so that's
very likely to happen and many people

00:28:56.330 --> 00:28:56.340
very likely to happen and many people
 

00:28:56.340 --> 00:28:58.370
very likely to happen and many people
will say I'm two inches shorter than I

00:28:58.370 --> 00:28:58.380

I'm waiting for that patiently because i

I'm waiting for that patiently because i
 

00:29:04.410 --> 00:29:06.470
I'm waiting for that patiently because i
was told that i'm going to lose some

00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:06.480
was told that i'm going to lose some
 

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:08.930
was told that i'm going to lose some
weight when i get older so we do have a

00:29:08.930 --> 00:29:08.940
weight when i get older so we do have a
 

00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:11.210
weight when i get older so we do have a
decrease in weight and a lot of it is

00:29:11.210 --> 00:29:11.220
decrease in weight and a lot of it is
 

00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:14.770
decrease in weight and a lot of it is
because of eating and just because of

in hours of sleep sometimes the research

00:33:13.119 --> 00:33:13.129
in hours of sleep sometimes the research
 

00:33:13.129 --> 00:33:16.539
in hours of sleep sometimes the research
will show that loss of sleep is really

00:33:16.539 --> 00:33:16.549
will show that loss of sleep is really
 

00:33:16.549 --> 00:33:19.720
will show that loss of sleep is really
not what the problem is it's when people

00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:19.730
not what the problem is it's when people
 

00:33:19.730 --> 00:33:23.169
not what the problem is it's when people
are sleeping a lot of older people will

00:33:23.169 --> 00:33:23.179
are sleeping a lot of older people will

not off frequently they'll sit down
 

00:33:26.090 --> 00:33:27.940
not off frequently they'll sit down
because they have the time and their

00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:27.950
because they have the time and their
 

00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:29.950
because they have the time and their
their life patterns have changed and

00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:39.009
nod off and then they wonder why they're
not sleeping at night it's because

00:33:39.009 --> 00:33:39.019
not sleeping at night it's because
 

00:33:39.019 --> 00:33:40.629
not sleeping at night it's because
they've already slept three hours during

00:33:40.629 --> 00:33:40.639
they've already slept three hours during
 

00:33:40.639 --> 00:33:43.629
they've already slept three hours during

afterward in the REM sleep which is so

00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:49.610
afterward in the REM sleep which is so
 

00:33:49.610 --> 00:33:52.749
afterward in the REM sleep which is so
important because that the period of

00:33:52.749 --> 00:33:52.759
important because that the period of
 

00:33:52.759 --> 00:33:57.639

that so a lot of people do have problems
the slowed response time yes there is

00:34:07.509 --> 00:34:07.519
the slowed response time yes there is
 

00:34:07.519 --> 00:34:11.260
the slowed response time yes there is
some slowness in responding in some

about all of you but I hadn't learned
 

00:35:30.690 --> 00:35:32.630
about all of you but I hadn't learned
about Maslow's theory a long time ago

00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:32.640
about Maslow's theory a long time ago
 

00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:36.110
about Maslow's theory a long time ago
and one day I decided that I'm going to

00:35:36.110 --> 00:35:36.120
and one day I decided that I'm going to
 

00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:38.420

you thought self-actualization was
 

00:36:03.890 --> 00:36:06.710
you thought self-actualization was
existential was it was just when if you

my professor led me to believe that
 

00:36:15.630 --> 00:36:17.840
my professor led me to believe that
that's what Maslow believed okay i

00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:17.850
that's what Maslow believed okay i
 

00:36:17.850 --> 00:36:20.600

that was well I I would probably have to

00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:08.430
that was well I I would probably have to
 

00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:11.030
that was well I I would probably have to
spend a long time discussing it with you

00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:11.040
spend a long time discussing it with you

but basically I just put it together

00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:14.730
but basically I just put it together
 

00:39:14.730 --> 00:39:18.620
but basically I just put it together
with how we get older and Maslow's

00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:18.630
with how we get older and Maslow's
 

00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:22.460
with how we get older and Maslow's
theory is that that there are needs that

00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:22.470
theory is that that there are needs that
 

00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:48.280
theory is that that there are needs that
each of us has each one of us has needs

talked about and and again I used the
 

00:40:06.990 --> 00:40:08.780
talked about and and again I used the
word theory because when I was learning

00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:08.790
word theory because when I was learning
 

00:40:08.790 --> 00:40:11.000
word theory because when I was learning
this in college many years ago and as

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:11.010
this in college many years ago and as
 

00:40:11.010 --> 00:40:13.880
this in college many years ago and as
I've looked at the revisiting the theory

00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:13.890
I've looked at the revisiting the theory
 

00:40:13.890 --> 00:40:16.430
I've looked at the revisiting the theory
in its called Maslow's theory of

in its called Maslow's theory of
 

00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:20.180
in its called Maslow's theory of
hierarchy why I use the word theory

00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:20.190
hierarchy why I use the word theory
 

00:40:20.190 --> 00:40:22.160
hierarchy why I use the word theory
because I'm just using and I explained

00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:22.170
because I'm just using and I explained
 

00:40:22.170 --> 00:40:24.980
because I'm just using and I explained
that to you yes you might help

00:42:18.670 --> 00:42:21.720
hierarchy I simply was just trying to
point out that as we get old and we all

00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:21.730
point out that as we get old and we all
 

00:42:21.730 --> 00:42:24.660
point out that as we get old and we all
have needs that have to be met and I

00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:24.670
have needs that have to be met and I
 

00:42:24.670 --> 00:42:26.730
have needs that have to be met and I
would be very happy to spend a long time

00:42:26.730 --> 00:42:26.740
would be very happy to spend a long time
 

00:42:26.740 --> 00:42:29.940
would be very happy to spend a long time
going over why I did this but basically

00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:29.950
going over why I did this but basically
 

00:42:29.950 --> 00:42:32.280
going over why I did this but basically
all I wanted to do is show you that we

00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:32.290
all I wanted to do is show you that we
 

00:42:32.290 --> 00:42:34.440
all I wanted to do is show you that we
have basic physiological needs that have

00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:34.450
have basic physiological needs that have
 

00:42:34.450 --> 00:42:37.770
have basic physiological needs that have
to be met in their order of hierarchy we

00:42:37.770 --> 00:42:37.780
to be met in their order of hierarchy we
 

00:42:37.780 --> 00:42:39.780
to be met in their order of hierarchy we
have safety needs that have to be met

00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:39.790
have safety needs that have to be met
 

00:42:39.790 --> 00:42:42.210
have safety needs that have to be met
and everybody thinks about some time

00:42:42.210 --> 00:42:42.220
and everybody thinks about some time
 

00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:44.030
and everybody thinks about some time
when you were walking some place or

00:42:44.030 --> 00:42:44.040
when you were walking some place or
 

00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:46.530
when you were walking some place or
doing something and you heard a sound

00:42:46.530 --> 00:42:46.540
doing something and you heard a sound
 

00:42:46.540 --> 00:42:52.130
doing something and you heard a sound
and your body just stopped activity and

00:42:52.130 --> 00:42:52.140
and your body just stopped activity and
 

00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:54.420
and your body just stopped activity and
you were sure that someone was either

00:42:54.420 --> 00:42:54.430
you were sure that someone was either
 

00:42:54.430 --> 00:42:56.280

coming up behind you or something was

00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:56.290

happening to you going to happen to you
 

00:42:58.570 --> 00:43:01.620
happening to you going to happen to you
and then that sound went away and all of

00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:01.630
and then that sound went away and all of
 

00:43:01.630 --> 00:43:04.680
and then that sound went away and all of
a sudden your body relaxed and that

00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:04.690
a sudden your body relaxed and that
 

00:43:04.690 --> 00:43:08.130
a sudden your body relaxed and that
stress impulse relaxed and if those

00:43:08.130 --> 00:43:08.140
stress impulse relaxed and if those
 

00:43:08.140 --> 00:43:10.410
stress impulse relaxed and if those
things happen often enough they are

00:43:10.410 --> 00:43:10.420
things happen often enough they are
 

00:43:10.420 --> 00:43:12.660
things happen often enough they are
going to cause you health problems so

00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:12.670
going to cause you health problems so
 

00:43:12.670 --> 00:43:14.250
going to cause you health problems so
that was another thing that we dubbed

00:43:14.250 --> 00:43:14.260
that was another thing that we dubbed
 

00:43:14.260 --> 00:43:16.200
that was another thing that we dubbed
off into when we looked at the safety

00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:16.210
off into when we looked at the safety
 

00:43:16.210 --> 00:43:18.359
off into when we looked at the safety
factors how they can cause stress in

00:43:18.359 --> 00:43:18.369
factors how they can cause stress in
 

00:43:18.369 --> 00:43:20.670
factors how they can cause stress in
your minds if you live in an area that's

00:43:20.670 --> 00:43:20.680
your minds if you live in an area that's
 

00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:22.740
your minds if you live in an area that's
not safe and you're always afraid that

00:43:22.740 --> 00:43:22.750
not safe and you're always afraid that
 

00:43:22.750 --> 00:43:24.150

someone's going to break into your home

00:43:24.150 --> 00:43:24.160
someone's going to break into your home
 

00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:26.609
someone's going to break into your home
you live in that chronic stress state

00:43:26.609 --> 00:43:26.619
you live in that chronic stress state
 

00:43:26.619 --> 00:43:28.800
you live in that chronic stress state
and depending on what part of your body

00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:28.810
and depending on what part of your body
 

00:43:28.810 --> 00:43:31.950
and depending on what part of your body
is affected by that means so da talked

00:43:31.950 --> 00:43:31.960
is affected by that means so da talked
 

00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:34.680
is affected by that means so da talked
about that many years ago it's been over

00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:34.690
about that many years ago it's been over
 

00:43:34.690 --> 00:43:36.210
about that many years ago it's been over
the years we've heard how stress affects

00:43:36.210 --> 00:43:36.220
the years we've heard how stress affects
 

00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:38.970
the years we've heard how stress affects
your body and now we're recognizing that

00:43:38.970 --> 00:43:38.980
your body and now we're recognizing that
 

00:43:38.980 --> 00:43:41.520
your body and now we're recognizing that
as we get older a lot of older people

00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:41.530
as we get older a lot of older people
 

00:43:41.530 --> 00:43:43.770
as we get older a lot of older people
suffer the effects of stress on their

00:43:43.770 --> 00:43:43.780
suffer the effects of stress on their
 

00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:46.140
suffer the effects of stress on their
bodies so I thought safety needs is a

00:43:46.140 --> 00:43:46.150
bodies so I thought safety needs is a
 

00:43:46.150 --> 00:43:48.930
bodies so I thought safety needs is a
very important component the need for

00:43:48.930 --> 00:43:48.940
very important component the need for
 

00:43:48.940 --> 00:43:51.390
very important component the need for
love and affection and belonging I do

00:43:51.390 --> 00:43:51.400
love and affection and belonging I do
 

00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:54.510
love and affection and belonging I do

00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:56.730
believe from talking to many people that
they don't think that older people are

00:43:56.730 --> 00:43:56.740
they don't think that older people are
 

00:43:56.740 --> 00:43:59.700
