00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:48.480
comes very natural to her but the
 

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:50.960
comes very natural to her but the
philosophies you know it is harder to

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:50.970
philosophies you know it is harder to
 

00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:52.940
philosophies you know it is harder to
come across something I personally like

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:52.950
come across something I personally like
 

00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:54.290
come across something I personally like
it yeah the only thing I'm still a

00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:54.300
it yeah the only thing I'm still a
 

00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:55.880
it yeah the only thing I'm still a
little afraid of you see a little bit of

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:55.890
little afraid of you see a little bit of
 

00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:58.070
little afraid of you see a little bit of
this again is that it may be a touch of

00:10:58.070 --> 00:10:58.080
this again is that it may be a touch of
 

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:00.170
this again is that it may be a touch of
the regression in Cora and what I found

00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:00.180
the regression in Cora and what I found
 

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:02.300
the regression in Cora and what I found
out with it with Aang's character is

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:02.310
out with it with Aang's character is
 

00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:06.590
out with it with Aang's character is
that I found if Cora was doing this and

00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:06.600
that I found if Cora was doing this and
 

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:08.540
that I found if Cora was doing this and
we did not have last airbender I hate

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:08.550
we did not have last airbender I hate
 

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:10.519
we did not have last airbender I hate
making that comparison but if if this

00:11:10.519 --> 00:11:10.529
making that comparison but if if this
 

00:11:10.529 --> 00:11:11.690
making that comparison but if if this
was going on I probably be more

00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:11.700
was going on I probably be more
 

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:13.760
was going on I probably be more
forgiving of it by things the fact that

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:13.770
forgiving of it by things the fact that
 

00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:16.610
forgiving of it by things the fact that
Aang was brought in and he was still kid

00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:16.620
Aang was brought in and he was still kid
 

00:11:16.620 --> 00:11:18.380
Aang was brought in and he was still kid
and they acknowledged that but he still

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:18.390
and they acknowledged that but he still
 

00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:20.840
and they acknowledged that but he still
acted for the most part very adult when

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:20.850
acted for the most part very adult when
 

00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:22.250
acted for the most part very adult when
these troubling times were coming and he

00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:22.260
these troubling times were coming and he
 

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.079
these troubling times were coming and he
wasn't a white or he wasn't a complainer

00:11:24.079 --> 00:11:24.089
wasn't a white or he wasn't a complainer
 

00:11:24.089 --> 00:11:26.930
wasn't a white or he wasn't a complainer
so when you have that first and then you

00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:26.940
so when you have that first and then you
 

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:29.210
so when you have that first and then you
have this character it's a tough act to

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:29.220
have this character it's a tough act to
 

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:31.430
have this character it's a tough act to
follow so I think it's okay then sheet

00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:31.440
follow so I think it's okay then sheet
 

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.350
follow so I think it's okay then sheet
like I said that she's Robin she wants

00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:33.360
like I said that she's Robin she wants
 

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:34.610
like I said that she's Robin she wants
to rush in and she makes a lot of

00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:34.620
to rush in and she makes a lot of
 

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:36.500
to rush in and she makes a lot of
mistakes but I think sort of that

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:36.510
mistakes but I think sort of that
 

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:39.590
mistakes but I think sort of that
constant Prive constant well I'm the

00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:39.600
constant Prive constant well I'm the
 

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:41.329

sort of that in the first season it's

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:42.690
sort of that in the first season it's
 

00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:45.230
sort of that in the first season it's
okay but it's here when she's just not

00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:45.240
okay but it's here when she's just not
 

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:46.910
okay but it's here when she's just not
learning and how many times is she gonna

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:46.920
learning and how many times is she gonna
 

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:49.100

here wasn't too bad but I'm hoping it's

00:11:50.750 --> 00:11:50.760
here wasn't too bad but I'm hoping it's
 

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:52.640
here wasn't too bad but I'm hoping it's
not like the formula or the pattern I

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:52.650
not like the formula or the pattern I
 

00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:54.410
not like the formula or the pattern I
had oh I wouldn't have as much of a

00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:54.420
had oh I wouldn't have as much of a
 

00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:56.120
had oh I wouldn't have as much of a
problem with it if we hadn't already

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:56.130
problem with it if we hadn't already
 

00:11:56.130 --> 00:11:58.670
problem with it if we hadn't already
gone through a first season exactly you

00:11:58.670 --> 00:11:58.680
gone through a first season exactly you
 

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:00.980
gone through a first season exactly you
know and oh that's yeah what bothers me

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:00.990
know and oh that's yeah what bothers me
 

00:12:00.990 --> 00:12:03.170
know and oh that's yeah what bothers me
is we we did this in the first season in

00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:03.180
is we we did this in the first season in
 

00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:06.800
is we we did this in the first season in
the end this may be because they got

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:06.810
the end this may be because they got
 

00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:08.630
the end this may be because they got
stuck because they had no idea how many

00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:08.640
stuck because they had no idea how many
 

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:10.310
stuck because they had no idea how many
more seasons were going to come after

00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:10.320
more seasons were going to come after
 

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:11.570
more seasons were going to come after
this so they're just like okay let's

00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:11.580
this so they're just like okay let's
 

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:13.190
this so they're just like okay let's
throw everything we can into this season

00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:17.550
and now they're there so I could the
 

00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:19.460
and now they're there so I could the
first one in you her progression though

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:19.470
first one in you her progression though
 

00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:21.199
first one in you her progression though
I mean they could I had to turn the

00:12:21.199 --> 00:12:21.209
I mean they could I had to turn the
 

00:12:21.209 --> 00:12:22.880

giant spiritual moment of her hitting
the ultimate low and then you know you

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:29.190
the ultimate low and then you know you
 

00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:32.570
the ultimate low and then you know you
would think that would do something well

00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:32.580

you could take it somewhere that
 

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:45.860
you could take it somewhere that
wouldn't just be a repeating ground many

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:45.870
