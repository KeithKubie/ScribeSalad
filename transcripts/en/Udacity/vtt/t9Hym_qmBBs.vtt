00:00:00.187 --> 00:00:03.007
10 to the fourth is 10,000.

00:00:03.007 --> 00:00:08.215
This is an exponent, and an exponent
means we multiply the base by itself,

00:00:08.215 --> 00:00:10.127
the power number of times.

00:00:10.127 --> 00:00:18.327
So 10 to the fourth equals 10
times 10 times 10 times 10.

00:00:18.327 --> 00:00:24.674
So there are four tens here, 10 times
10 times 10 times 10 equals 10,000.

00:00:24.674 --> 00:00:29.650
Notice that there are four zeros,
and the power is four.
