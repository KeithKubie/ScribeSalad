00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:07.030
The common-sense explanation for long-term
singlehood directs the blame firmly outwards,

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:11.860
it isolates the problem to one of mechanics:
one is still single because one hasn’t,

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:17.070
perhaps on account of having moved to a vast
and anonymous new city, been invited to enough

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.700
parties, or because the constant requirement
to fly to the Singapore office leaves no time

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.359
for the right sort of socializing, or because
one is holed up in a remote village high in

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.640
the mountains connected to the more densely
populated lowlands only by an irregular bus

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:40.239
service. These may be solid enough reasons,
but when the problems persist over an extended

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:47.090
period, their power to explain our situation
weakens. Without anything remotely persecutory

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:53.940
or unkind being intended by this, one is forced
to cast around for psychological rather than

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:00.940
procedural explanations. The problem must
lie in our minds rather than in the world.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.239
And
in the recesses of these minds, two issues

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:11.020
– diametrical yet complimentary – can
often be identified: one is suffering from

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:20.970
an excess of self-hatred. Or from an excess
of self-love. Self-hatred is the more poignant

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.799
of the pair. On being approached by someone,
however initially attractive and competent

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:33.340
they might be, we begin to wonder why they
should be so naive, so desperate, and so weak

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:39.899
as to be drawn to someone like us. When we
are inadequately convinced of our own likeability,

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:45.990
the attentions of another person must forever
seem illegitimate and peculiar, and reflect

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:53.049
poorly on their donor. Love feels like a gift
we haven’t earned, don’t deserve – and

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:59.790
must therefore take care eventually to throw
away. We might, under the pressure of self-hatred,

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:06.460
accuse our admirer of naivety. The only possible
reason they can have to approve of us is that

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.830
they are poor judges of character. That is
why they have missed all the more disturbed

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:17.900
and darker aspects of us. They like us only
because they are blind – and therefore a

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.650
little stupid. However, because they are bound
to spot their error eventually, it is surely

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.260
wiser to run away before we are exposed and
abandoned. We end up alone because, despite

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.370
our longing for affection, we don’t in essence
feel there are any good and lasting reasons

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:41.270
why anyone would properly see us and like
us. We may also, in the face of the gifts,

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:47.730
text messages or hugs we receive, start to
feel that our admirer is, to a sickening degree,

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:53.850
needy. We feel repulsed by their need when
we don’t see ourselves as appropriate targets

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:59.600
of anyone’s need; we reject their nascent
dependence because somewhere inside, we are

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:06.410
sure that we are not people to depend upon.
And yet, of course, none of these spectres

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:12.500
need to be real in the world outside our touchingly
troubled minds. The person who is keen on

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:19.250
us is almost certainly not naive. They can
no doubt see us for what we are: they have

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:25.240
noticed many of our less admirable sides.
It is just that they don’t consider these

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:30.770
fatal, because they know that being not quite
right is what all of us are and is no barrier

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:35.790
to a mature relationship. They know we’re
not exactly who we think we should be, but

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:41.030
they also grasp that this doesn’t place
anyone in the category of the damned. We might

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:47.240
be a bit perverted, a little silly and not
as nice as we make out – but so is everyone

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:54.040
else. It’s not that they are naive about
us; we’re ultimately naive about them. They

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:59.800
know that every human has shadow sides. They’ve
made peace with theirs (probably as a result

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:06.091
of a fortunate childhood); they would like
us to make peace with ours. Ahead of us, they

00:04:06.091 --> 00:04:12.420
understand that a person can be ordinarily
imperfect – and worthy of being cherished.

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:21.900
Then, at the other
end of the spectrum, comes excessive self-love,

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:27.030
which really means a hesitation around fully
acknowledging what a challenging proposition

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:33.220
one is – and therefore how much we should
rightly be grateful for when someone, anyone

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:38.960
with an ordinary share of strengths and weaknesses,
looks our way. Perhaps because of the legacy

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:45.580
of doting and forgivably biased parents, we
are operating with an unhelpful sense of how

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:53.100
lucky someone might be to end up in our arms.
After having been alone for a long time, we

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:58.740
may also have lost the knack of spotting what
peculiar, demanding and compulsive people

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:04.710
we are. With no one to hold up a mirror, we
have forgotten to give due weight to the rage,

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:11.900
the anxiety and the moments of vindictiveness inside us.
At the same time, we are travelling the world

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:17.940
with our imaginations switched off, imagination
defined here as the capacity to look with

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:24.480
energy, compassion and curiosity into the
face and character of another person in order

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:28.800
to search out what might be desirable and
good therein.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.960
What happens when we look without imagination?

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:37.600
Well we meet someone quite nice, but their nose is too big... "erm, no".

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:42.080
Or they are an Engineer, Engineers are unsophisticated.  "No".

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:47.360
Maybe they are rich?  "Rich people are snobs, no."

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:56.960
Perhaps the hair is thining, "bald people aren't our thing. no." or they have a strong accent? "no".

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:04.570
Imagination means sensitivity to the less
obvious things; one scans past the surface

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:09.590
and wonders about what might be worthy inside
a fellow human, whom it would – of course

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:15.840
– always be so easy (yet ultimately so unrewarding) to criticise.

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:21.920
What happens when we look with imagination?  We meet someone, they look conventional and

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:26.720
formal but we think they could turn out to have playfull and wild sides too.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:33.440
Or they look mousy but also maybe they are very whitty around people they know well.

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:40.320
Or they do have a slightly wonky nose but their eyes are very tender and their lips supprisingly sensual.

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:49.920
Or they do have a job that sounds unimpressive but their interests are very broad and they might be the ideal person to go around an antiques market with.

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:53.760
To awaken the dormant faculty of the imagination,

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:58.690
we might more regularly – perhaps in the
street or on the train to work – look at

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:05.580
the faces around us, especially the less distinguished
or obviously sculpted ones, and ask ourselves

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:11.760
what there could be to delight in. There is
always going to be something, for we were

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:18.880
all once love-worthy children and remain as
much in our depths.

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:28.480
Take an experiment. if you were forced to love one of these candidates, choose your favourite gender.  What might there be to fall in love with?

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:34.560
Practising imagination is not a compromise,
it is the key to love, for we all have to

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:40.490
be considered imaginatively in order to be
tolerated and forgiven over the long term

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:46.410
by anyone. By thinking imaginatively, we’re
not being disloyal to the true ambition of

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:53.180
love; we’re stumbling on the essence of
what love rightly has to involve. There will

00:07:53.180 --> 00:08:00.370
always be practical reasons why it proves
hard to find a partner. But if we have worked

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:06.190
on our levels of self-love and attenuated
the ravages of self-hatred, an absence of

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:12.500
parties or a difficult bus ride to the next
town need never condemn us long-term to a

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:20.510
life devoid of tenderness and connection.

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:26.740
How to Find Love, which explains why we have
the ‘types’ we do, and how our early experiences

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:28.680
shape how and whom we love
