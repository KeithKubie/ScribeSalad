1
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:06,090
This topic today is really fun.

2
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:12,330
Uh, I love the acts of Paul and
Thecla. It is such a bizarre document.

3
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,350
I hope you read it before class as
the syllabus instructed you tube.

4
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,890
It's not an easy document to get into if
it's the first time you've come across

5
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,430
this kind of non-canonical
early Christian literature.

6
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,010
Sometimes we'll call
this stuff apocryphal,

7
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:30,600
which is just the Greek word for
our hidden. Uh, and we don't,

8
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:34,680
this is not part of the Apocrypha
that's published in your Bible,

9
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,250
your study Bible. If you bought the
[inaudible], the Bible that I requested,

10
00:00:38,251 --> 00:00:40,440
which was had a,
I think it was the new,

11
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:44,190
the Oxford Study Bible with
Apocrypha that Apocrypha is,

12
00:00:44,191 --> 00:00:49,191
I explained at the beginning of the whole
semester is Jewish literature that was

13
00:00:51,421 --> 00:00:54,900
published, was written sometime
in the second temple period.

14
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,100
And it's not, it's explicitly
Christian literature for the most part.

15
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:03,570
So when people don't talk
about the Apocrypha that's
published in a modern Bible,

16
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:08,250
they're talking about that Jewish
literature that survived in Greek, mainly.

17
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,540
In fact, this was why that those, those
books were rejected by the reformers,

18
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,630
Martin Luther and Calvin.
And the lengthen,

19
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,010
they tended to not use the Apocrypha in
the Protestant Bible precisely because

20
00:01:20,011 --> 00:01:23,430
they wanted to go back to the Hebrew
Bible like the rabbis were using.

21
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:28,530
And so the Apocrypha although has
continued to be part of the Roman Catholic

22
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:31,320
Bible in something and maybe
have a secondary status, uh,

23
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:35,760
is not been part of the Protestant Bible.
But that term Apocrypha refers to that,

24
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:37,020
uh,

25
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:41,640
very varying lists because what is
actually even included in that Jewish

26
00:01:41,641 --> 00:01:44,640
apocrypha varies according to
which publication you may pick up,

27
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,510
but some type of pants people will all,

28
00:01:47,511 --> 00:01:52,080
we also use this word Apocrypha for what
they call something like New Testament

29
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,850
Apocrypha or early Christian Apocrypha.

30
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:58,230
And that's kind of a misleading term
because there's nothing hidden about this

31
00:01:58,231 --> 00:01:59,970
literature at all.
It's always been there.

32
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:04,440
It's just not part of the Christian Canon.
Some of it is entirely Orthodox,

33
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,820
some of it is rather heretical.
And some of it is,

34
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:13,170
is somewhere not completely
in tune with later orthodoxy,

35
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,340
but nevertheless,

36
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:18,780
nevertheless reflecting what was
definitely orthodoxy in its own day.

37
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,900
And so all of this literature is
written in the second century.

38
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:23,160
Our document today,

39
00:02:23,161 --> 00:02:26,610
the acts of Paul and Thecla was
composed in the second century, uh,

40
00:02:26,611 --> 00:02:30,990
and it was considered quite good
literature by many early Christians.

41
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:35,550
It just wasn't part of the New Testament
mainly because people knew it was a bit

42
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:39,900
later of a document,
not so much out of concerns for orthodoxy.

43
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:43,920
One of the purposes of
my teaching this course,

44
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:49,790
one of my purposes of teaching all of
my courses is to get students to start

45
00:02:51,331 --> 00:02:54,000
thinking completely differently.
In other words,

46
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:59,030
you've noticed perhaps that one of the
things I stress in my lectures is how odd

47
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,850
the ancient world is.

48
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:04,960
Even how odd early Christianity is from
what most of us tend to come at it.

49
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:08,680
This is because I teach new testament
studies and the history of early

50
00:03:08,681 --> 00:03:10,750
Christianity,
almost like ethnography.

51
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:15,580
I try to get you to imagine yourself
coming into a culture that's really

52
00:03:15,581 --> 00:03:19,210
different from the culture you grew
up in because one of the, this is,

53
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:24,240
this is something I think is basic to
religious studies as a discipline and it's

54
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:29,270
it it religious studies teaches you to
look at some kind of group of people or

55
00:03:29,741 --> 00:03:34,741
an activity or a belief structure that
seems to you initially absolutely bizarre

56
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:39,490
and you think,
how could any rational person do that?

57
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:44,640
How could any rational person believe
that and to keep looking at it seriously

58
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,280
and it look at it with enough sympathy
that you actually can see eventually how

59
00:03:50,501 --> 00:03:55,501
it is perfectly rational and this document
today is a great place to illustrate

60
00:03:55,841 --> 00:03:59,080
that because whenever I teach
this document to people your age,

61
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:01,810
18 to 22 year old college students,

62
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:04,540
if you read this carefully
and you get into this stuff,

63
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,150
it should be bizarre to you.
These are,

64
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:12,070
this document depicts young people
who are attracted to a version of

65
00:04:12,071 --> 00:04:16,270
Christianity that forbids
having sex entirely.

66
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:21,880
It's completely aesthetic.
The Paul in the acts upon Thekla says,

67
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,250
if you have sex,
you're probably not going to go to heaven.

68
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:30,010
Basically the Gospel mentioned in this
document is continents by which this

69
00:04:30,011 --> 00:04:34,120
document means avoiding sex.
Now that,

70
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:38,560
and that's going to be bizarre enough
because people in the modern world kind of

71
00:04:38,561 --> 00:04:39,394
had the idea,
well,

72
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,520
why would somebody join any movement
that for bad sexual intimacy entirely?

73
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,260
What kind of draw that did that have
for people? Why did that Gospel succeed?

74
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:54,310
And what may be surprising to you is
it did succeed in the ancient world.

75
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:55,540
A lot of people,

76
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,600
especially it seems sometimes even young
people were drawn to early Christianity

77
00:05:01,331 --> 00:05:03,340
precisely because it was aesthetic.

78
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:08,620
It taught this radical asceticism of
watching what you eat and especially

79
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:11,590
avoiding sex or if not
avoiding sex entirely,

80
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:15,370
severely limiting sexual
intercourse and sexual attraction.

81
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,520
So what is it? Why? What is
it about the ancient culture?

82
00:05:18,521 --> 00:05:22,420
What is it about these people that
caused them not only to be converted to

83
00:05:22,421 --> 00:05:24,370
Christianity,
but to be converted,

84
00:05:24,371 --> 00:05:29,371
especially to a form of it that was re
radically ascetic and you to in order to

85
00:05:30,341 --> 00:05:34,210
see why that kind of Christianity
was because that's the actual kind of

86
00:05:34,211 --> 00:05:37,720
Christianity that was successful
in the ancient world. You,

87
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:41,200
if you were listening to most
modern American Christians,
modern American people,

88
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,213
generally,

89
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:47,500
what are the two most important teachings
about Christianity in minds of most

90
00:05:47,501 --> 00:05:52,300
Americans, the family, right?
The importance of the family,

91
00:05:52,301 --> 00:05:55,390
and by that they mean the
heterosexual nuclear family,

92
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:59,630
but even the liberal churches which are
willing to recognize Gabrilino gunships,

93
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:04,780
they still construe that as gay marriage
or gay just gave versions of the

94
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:05,870
nuclear family.

95
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:09,980
So the family's the most important thing
about Christianity and the mind's a lot

96
00:06:09,981 --> 00:06:13,220
of Americans. The second thing
is nationalism. Patriotism.

97
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:19,480
If you took away patriotism
and nationalism and the
family out of Christianity,

98
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,960
most people in the modern America
wouldn't recognize it as such.

99
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,920
What's odd is that when you
read these ancient documents,

100
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:33,850
that's precisely the two things that
Christianity attacks this form of early

101
00:06:34,191 --> 00:06:39,170
Christianity was antifamily for the
most part and it was anti patriotic,

102
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:44,090
so the very, and that was also
people who say, but this was,

103
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,620
this is traditional Christianity.

104
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:51,250
Those people don't know their history
before 1950 because the church,

105
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:56,650
the overall Christian churches were never
pro family for the first 1500 years of

106
00:06:57,531 --> 00:07:00,680
its existence.
The Roman Catholic church,

107
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:03,890
up until the reformation always
had is its official position,

108
00:07:03,891 --> 00:07:05,810
not just popular ideas.

109
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:11,080
It's official position was celibacy is
superior to sexuality if you're going to,

110
00:07:12,441 --> 00:07:14,810
if you have to have sex,
if you can't control yourself,

111
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,410
you're allowed to get married and have
sex within the bounds of marriage,

112
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:20,510
but the better thing,

113
00:07:20,511 --> 00:07:24,620
the better virtue would be to avoid
sex entirely for your entire life.

114
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:29,450
The next best thing is to have sex
if you need to just to make babies,

115
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:34,670
but in as soon as you have your babies
stop having sex and be a ascetic the rest

116
00:07:34,671 --> 00:07:37,280
of your life.
If your spouse dies,

117
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,640
you are permitted to get remarried.
Most of the time,

118
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:44,750
but the higher virtue would
be in remaining unmarried
and remaining celibate for

119
00:07:44,751 --> 00:07:49,640
the rest of your life. That was
considered the doctrine in Christianity,

120
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:53,480
at least up until the reformation,
so the 16th century.

121
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:57,860
So when people talk about traditional
family values being traditionally the

122
00:07:57,861 --> 00:07:58,694
Christian way,

123
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:03,560
they're not talking about Christianity
as it existed from the time of Jesus all

124
00:08:03,561 --> 00:08:08,561
the way up until around 1600 and even
then from 1600 until 1950 the ideal form

125
00:08:11,181 --> 00:08:15,290
in most Christianity was not the nuclear
family, but some kind of household.

126
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:19,220
So in Puritan New England, people
didn't live in little nuclear families.

127
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:24,350
Downtown ships, the new haven
colony, the Massachusetts Bay Colony,

128
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:28,610
they were organized into households
that were run by the head of the hat,

129
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:31,760
the male head of household,
his wife under him,

130
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:35,960
children under that servants
and free other free people.

131
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:39,770
Often living in the household also are
connected to the household. If you are,

132
00:08:39,771 --> 00:08:44,570
for example, an adult male,
25 years old in New England,

133
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:47,870
in Puritan New England,
and you weren't married,

134
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:51,320
you weren't really supposed to
live alone or with other men,

135
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:55,260
that happens sometimes, but the the
town fathers and they and these,

136
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:59,760
these callings were ruled as communities,
not individual people.

137
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,960
The town fathers would want to put
you into somebody else's household,

138
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:07,740
into the household of another man.
They certainly wouldn't let women,

139
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,660
adult women live separately.

140
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:14,880
So notice this is not individualism in
the modern sense and it's not the nuclear

141
00:09:14,881 --> 00:09:18,210
family in a modern sense.
These are extended family households.

142
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,150
That was the new England Protestant way.

143
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:27,170
When did the idea that the dominant form
of the best form of the family was the

144
00:09:27,691 --> 00:09:32,100
nuclear family come about in
popular culture overall? The 1950s

145
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:33,850
yeah.

146
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:37,300
So when people talk about that
being the Christian thing,

147
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:42,580
they're forgetting the vast
sweep of Christian history,
they're just ignoring it.

148
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:47,980
And this document is a good place to
see why that made sense for people,

149
00:09:47,981 --> 00:09:49,180
especially in the ancient world.

150
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,330
And to make it since for the Middle
Ages and all the rest of the time you'll

151
00:09:52,331 --> 00:09:53,200
have to take another course.

152
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:58,570
So one of the things I want you to do
is enter into this text as if you're an

153
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:03,160
ethnographer, an anthropologist, and
try to see how does this make sense?

154
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:05,530
How does this gospel that
this text proclaimed,

155
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:09,190
how did it make sense to people
and why was it so wildly popular?

156
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,830
Because it was wildly popular.

157
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,840
First you have to know a bit
about the Greco Roman novel.

158
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:19,080
I talked about this early in the semester
when we talked about the acts of the

159
00:10:19,081 --> 00:10:22,590
apostles. Greek novels,
um, are very interesting.

160
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:26,850
There are six of them that survive in
almost whole and then fragments of a lot

161
00:10:26,851 --> 00:10:31,560
of others. Uh, and you can find
these in English translation, Duh.

162
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:33,090
Help me out.
Teaching fellows,

163
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,790
what's the name of the
collection of the Greek novels?

164
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,320
It's called something like collected
Greek novels. Yes. And is it Reardon?

165
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:46,050
Who's the edit? Reardon? R. E. A. R.
D. O. N. If you want to dip into these,

166
00:10:46,051 --> 00:10:47,330
just get the collected.

167
00:10:47,331 --> 00:10:51,150
The ancient Greek novels by translated
by Reardon are are edited by Reardon and

168
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:53,070
read through some of them.
They're very entertaining.

169
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:58,640
One of the things that typical plot
is a woman of high elite status.

170
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:04,560
These are usually are people, young
people of elite families in classical,

171
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:06,030
they're usually set in classical Greeks,

172
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:08,940
although they're not written until
the first century, second century,

173
00:11:08,941 --> 00:11:10,200
third century of our era,

174
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:14,610
but there often are set
in a more classical Greek
setting and our upper class

175
00:11:14,611 --> 00:11:17,490
people, a young woman who's
of of an upper class family,

176
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:22,860
falls in love with a young man who's also
from an upper class family and s and a

177
00:11:22,861 --> 00:11:26,130
few of the great novels. They actually
get married and have a little honeymoon,

178
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:29,520
a brief honeymoon period, and then all
hell breaks loose and something happens.

179
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:33,420
In some cases they don't
even get to consummate their
love yet because something

180
00:11:33,421 --> 00:11:38,400
intervenes. Usually what happens
is a disaster strikes. And one,

181
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:39,640
I think I mentioned this too,

182
00:11:39,641 --> 00:11:44,641
that the Keratin carry up Caria Todd's
and clearly and one the husband gets

183
00:11:45,301 --> 00:11:49,770
jealous thinking that his wife has a,
had an affair. He in a fit of rage,

184
00:11:49,771 --> 00:11:53,010
he kicks her,
she falls over and by thinks she's dead.

185
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:56,290
So he's grieving and grieving because
of course he's still madly in love with

186
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:59,590
her. They're both Matt and in love with
each other, but they bury her in the tomb,

187
00:11:59,591 --> 00:12:03,760
the big family tomb. That's all those,
the shore by the water of course, like,

188
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:06,160
and Shakespeare stole mercilessly
from these kinds of things.

189
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:09,970
She wakes up in the tomb after they've
already sealed the tomb and she can't get

190
00:12:09,971 --> 00:12:12,430
out. And she says, oh,
woe is me. They buried me.

191
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:15,280
I'll never see my loved one
again in my blah, blah, blah,

192
00:12:15,281 --> 00:12:18,280
blah pirates who happen to be outside.

193
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:21,670
There's always pirates in these things.

194
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:25,060
Lots of pirates pirates
happening outside. They, oh,

195
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:27,850
they hear her crying and
they break into the tombs.

196
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,770
They were just gonna do
a little tomb robbery.

197
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,960
They were intending to tomb tomb robbery,

198
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:35,680
but they find this living maiden
[inaudible] anymore. She's had sex now,

199
00:12:35,681 --> 00:12:38,330
so she's a maid not made anymore.
But anyway,

200
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:41,320
she's a beautiful young woman and
they decide, well, great, this,

201
00:12:41,321 --> 00:12:44,770
we can get more for her than from
the stuff in here, will kidnap her,

202
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:49,540
sell her as a, as a, into slavery
at some other port. And they do.

203
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:53,140
So they take her off,
they take her around over to Asia minor,

204
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:57,320
modern day Turkey and there they
seller to this wealthy man. He,

205
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,540
he falls in love with her.

206
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:02,860
So he decides to marry her and then
something else happens and they go to the

207
00:13:02,861 --> 00:13:05,230
king of Persia and the King of
Persia falls in love with her.

208
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,810
So he steals her away from the God,
the Greek Guy,

209
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:10,780
and then warfare's
breakout and her husband,

210
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,270
as soon as he finds that
she's been stolen away,

211
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:17,320
he starts traveling all
around the Mediterranean
looking for her and he'll get

212
00:13:17,321 --> 00:13:22,321
just to Alexandria in Egypt the day after
she been sold off to slavery someplace

213
00:13:22,331 --> 00:13:23,164
else.

214
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:26,620
So these to traipse around
the Mediterranean looking
further because they're

215
00:13:26,621 --> 00:13:28,480
madly in love and you want
to consummate their marriage.

216
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,260
And of course everybody falls in love
with both of them no matter where this

217
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,620
young woman goes, every, every
man around falls in love with her.

218
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:39,340
And that's caused problems all over the
place. Of course, in the ancient world,

219
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:42,160
everywhere the young man goes,
everybody falls in love with him,

220
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:45,430
both women and men because that
was quite common. And so, you know,

221
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:47,800
they both have all this eroticism.
So they're,

222
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,140
they're describing their
beauty all the time.

223
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:52,960
Usually there's someplace in the
novel where they can get naked,

224
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:55,960
where somehow the plot happens,

225
00:13:55,961 --> 00:14:00,070
where she stripped because she's going
to be punished or he's stripped because

226
00:14:00,071 --> 00:14:03,140
he's going to be crucified or
something has happened. And the, the,

227
00:14:03,141 --> 00:14:07,600
the story kind of concentrates
on how beautiful their
bodies are. In other words,

228
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:12,250
the whole novels are about being faithful
to the person you loved in your youth

229
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:15,550
because they both try not to have sex
with anybody else, if they can at all.

230
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,120
Do that.
Be Faithful to your lover from your youth.

231
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:23,320
But the but the erotic drive is
just all the way through the novel.

232
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:27,070
The novels are full of eroticism
and the eroticism of the eye.

233
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:32,670
So this acts of Paul and Thecla is so
wonderfully like those things because it

234
00:14:33,131 --> 00:14:35,500
also uses eroticism.

235
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:40,500
Did you notice how often Thekla is
portrayed as gorgeous and even stripped so

236
00:14:40,661 --> 00:14:40,991
you can,

237
00:14:40,991 --> 00:14:45,610
you as the voyeuristic reader can imagine
her naked body before she's thrown

238
00:14:45,611 --> 00:14:48,430
into the vat of killer man eating seals.
You remember that scene

239
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:53,030
and so the erotic is here in this text,

240
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,550
but the erotic is used
to the opposite purpose.

241
00:14:55,551 --> 00:14:59,270
The erotic is used to actually
teach you to avoid sex.

242
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:03,640
So the,
to really read this text of the ax effect,

243
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:08,300
it helps with you know that the way
these ancient Greek novels often work.

244
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:12,080
So let's look at the texts now and
I'll show you some of these things.

245
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:15,980
Look at paragraph 18 I don't
know if you have the pages,

246
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:17,240
but your text,

247
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:19,370
there are a couple of different
additions that I've used this class.

248
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,950
I don't know which one I had
for downloading with you,

249
00:15:21,951 --> 00:15:24,710
but I'm going to not talk about
page numbers most of the time.

250
00:15:24,711 --> 00:15:25,730
But paragraph numbers,

251
00:15:25,731 --> 00:15:28,970
because the texts are all divided
up into paragraph numbers.

252
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:31,100
So in paragraph 18

253
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:42,660
Oh, where is it? Look,

254
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:46,480
it's a faculty has gone off to prison.
So firstly,

255
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:51,630
of course the story goes that she hears
Paul preaching in our hometown and she

256
00:15:51,941 --> 00:15:55,000
falls in love with him just from
hearing us preaching. Not the text,

257
00:15:55,001 --> 00:15:57,130
doesn't really say she falls
in love with him. Right?

258
00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:02,110
But it describes her as being unamortized
of Paul, at least of his gospel.

259
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,110
And so for example,
she goes to visit him in prison.

260
00:16:05,111 --> 00:16:07,360
He's been thrown in prison
because wherever Paul goes,

261
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,700
he gets into trouble
with the men of the city.

262
00:16:09,701 --> 00:16:12,070
And it's always the men of the city
he gets in trouble with. Right?

263
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:16,750
And it's because he's teaching wives not
to have sex with their husbands anymore.

264
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:17,681
Well,

265
00:16:17,681 --> 00:16:22,480
this gets the guys upset and he's teaching
unmarried women not to get married

266
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:25,760
and young men not to get married.
Well, if you, if you don't get married,

267
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,370
don't have sex,
you're not going to have children.

268
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,430
You're not going to have babies. And
the households will hold all fall apart.

269
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:31,450
So Paul is,

270
00:16:31,451 --> 00:16:35,350
it gets in trouble precise because of
his auntie household anti-sex message

271
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,680
because the men of the city know
full well that if you don't have sex,

272
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:39,640
you don't have households,

273
00:16:39,641 --> 00:16:44,080
you're not going to have a
city civilization's going
to fall apart in their

274
00:16:44,081 --> 00:16:47,710
views. So, so he's arrested.
She goes to visit him in prison,

275
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,580
and it says to the jailer,
she gave a silver mirror.

276
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,830
This mirror is in the ancient world,

277
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:57,760
a typical sign for femininity
and women on tombstones.

278
00:16:57,761 --> 00:17:01,060
You'll often see a mirror
carved when it's a girl,

279
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:04,030
a young girl who's buried
in that tomb at that term.

280
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:06,370
She gives the jailer her silver mirror.

281
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:10,030
She went into Paul and sat at his feet
and heard him proclaim the mighty acts of

282
00:17:10,031 --> 00:17:12,910
God. Paul offered nothing but
comported himself with full comments.

283
00:17:12,911 --> 00:17:17,230
Got and her faith was also
increased as she kissed his fetters.

284
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,313
Uh,

285
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,890
next paragraph down 20, he commanded
Paul to be brought to the judgment seat.

286
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:29,510
But fet glow rolled herself on the
place where Paul Sat taught as he sat in

287
00:17:29,511 --> 00:17:31,530
prison. So she goes, well, you know,

288
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:36,170
she's rolling around in the
dust where Paul had set earlier.

289
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:42,140
Did you ever hear about old people talk
about in very strict Roman Catholic

290
00:17:42,141 --> 00:17:43,820
schools and stuff.
Guys,

291
00:17:43,821 --> 00:17:47,720
we're not supposed to sit in the same
folding chair that a girl had just sat in

292
00:17:47,721 --> 00:17:51,330
because it would be warm and that
was considered a little too erotic.

293
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,450
Yep.
People are screwed up,

294
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:04,680
write down. Um, she stood
there looking steadily at Paul.

295
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:09,920
So a little farther Thekla sought
for Paul as a lamb in the wilderness.

296
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:14,500
Looks about first shepherd.
So all the way through, um,

297
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,700
um, look on the next paragraph. 22,

298
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:24,630
the young men and the maidens brought wood
and Straw that Thekla might be burned.

299
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,850
And as she was brought in naked,

300
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,080
the governor wept and marveled
at the power that was in her.

301
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:34,330
I'm not too sure about the writing here.
I mean it,

302
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:38,490
notice how over and over again in this
text there's something about kissing are

303
00:18:38,491 --> 00:18:39,211
marveling,

304
00:18:39,211 --> 00:18:43,620
are looking and right at the point
where you think that the body should be

305
00:18:43,621 --> 00:18:46,710
what's being referred to.
The author says something like,

306
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:51,330
power our message.
So there's,

307
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:56,700
there's a direction toward the body all
the way through this text and then a

308
00:18:56,701 --> 00:19:01,701
diversion of your attention as a reader
away from the body to the Gospel.

309
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:07,920
But the body is still there, just hovering
right around the edge of your vision.

310
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,930
So the text does that over and over again.

311
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:13,560
Look at a 20 pair of 25.

312
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,230
Oh, uh, I don't know.

313
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,140
Well over and over again, I'm
not going to go through, uh,

314
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:26,910
any more examples of that because that
just all the way through the text,

315
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:32,240
sex is the driving force
of the piece of literature.

316
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:35,790
Even though the piece of literature is
going to try to teach you not to have sex.

317
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:40,890
And so there's also desire and passion
all the way through. But as I said,

318
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:45,810
the main message of the text is don't
have sex. So look at paragraph five.

319
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:51,510
This is where Paul is giving his own
version of the beatitudes that's you're

320
00:19:51,511 --> 00:19:55,020
familiar with from Matthew and Luke.
Paul's version is very different though,

321
00:19:55,021 --> 00:19:58,620
right? Uh, it says in Para Five,

322
00:19:58,621 --> 00:20:01,800
when Paul was entered into the house of
Vanessa, for us, there was great joy,

323
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:04,860
bowing of needs break breaking of
bread and the word of God concerning

324
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:09,420
continents and the resurrection.
Now the word continents there, uh,

325
00:20:09,421 --> 00:20:12,230
is just referring to asceticism
that in this text it,

326
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:14,610
it doesn't mean just
controlling your sex life.

327
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:18,030
It means not having sex in Thailand.
So when this, when this author,

328
00:20:18,031 --> 00:20:22,350
this translation says continents, you
read that as complete sexual asceticism.

329
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:23,670
So that's the main,
the message.

330
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:26,610
But notice how continents
is linked to resurrection.

331
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:32,610
So the avoidance of sex is directly
linked to the resurrection of the body in

332
00:20:32,611 --> 00:20:35,250
this text. And these
are the, the beatitudes,

333
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,320
blessed are the pure in
heart for they shall see God.

334
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:41,700
Blessed are they who have kept
the flesh pure and don't be,

335
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,420
don't be misled in this text.
That means not having sex.

336
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:50,350
For they shall become a of God.
Bless are the continent for that to them.

337
00:20:50,351 --> 00:20:53,650
God will speak. Blessed are they
who have renounced this world.

338
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,450
For they shall be well pleasing unto God.

339
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:58,720
Blessed are they who have
wives as if they had them,

340
00:20:58,721 --> 00:21:01,060
not for they shall inherit God.
Now,

341
00:21:01,061 --> 00:21:04,300
that's actually almost a quotation from
Paul [inaudible]. Paul talks about,

342
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,090
you know, having as if you did
not have and these sorts of thing,

343
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:12,070
living your life as if blessed are
they who have no, who have fear of God,

344
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,370
for they shall become angels of God.
Now,

345
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:18,430
it might help you to know there that
angels in the ancient world are often

346
00:21:18,431 --> 00:21:23,410
depicted as androgynous, as not being
sexual. Anybody seen the movie dogma?

347
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:28,000
How many teen movie dogma?
Raise your hand so I can see him.

348
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,760
If you haven't seen the movie dogma,
go rent it.

349
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:34,270
It's a highly important theological movie.

350
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:39,460
It's a very theological movie actually,
and if you've seen it,

351
00:21:39,461 --> 00:21:42,530
you remember there's a place where the
angel who's appearing to the woman who's

352
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:46,920
going to be the chosen one, the
quarter, the Mary type figure, ah,

353
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:49,150
he appears in her bedroom in
the middle of the night, right?

354
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:50,890
And she thinks he's there to rape her.

355
00:21:50,891 --> 00:21:53,440
So she takes a baseball bat and she's
gonna try and he's trying to keep,

356
00:21:53,441 --> 00:21:55,090
not get pummeled with the baseball bat.

357
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:58,870
So he pulls his pants down to show her
that he's an angel. Why does that work?

358
00:21:58,871 --> 00:22:01,510
Because he doesn't have genitalia.
See and that,

359
00:22:01,511 --> 00:22:04,600
so that proves to her or it's supposed
to prove to her, she's just confused.

360
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:10,060
She doesn't know her angel ology properly.
If she knew her angel Ology,

361
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:11,710
she would know that angels,

362
00:22:11,711 --> 00:22:15,670
at least in one dominant form
of tradition are androgynous.

363
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:18,550
So they don't have genetalia are they're
either completely male or something

364
00:22:18,551 --> 00:22:22,270
like that. So that's why Paul says
in this beatitude, you will, uh,

365
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:25,150
be as the angels of God bless,

366
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:29,140
let write down their blessed are they who
have kept their baptisms secure. Again,

367
00:22:29,141 --> 00:22:33,400
one of the teachings of early Christianity
like this was once you're baptized,

368
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:37,390
you're not allowed to send anymore baptism
according to some teachings in early

369
00:22:37,391 --> 00:22:40,900
Christianity would cleanse you of all
the sins you had committed up until the

370
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:45,490
time you're baptized. Well, what if
you send after your baptism? Well,

371
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:49,210
there might be other ways get forgiveness
for that, but you're in trouble.

372
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:54,150
This is why a lot of emperors would not
get baptized into their deathbed cause

373
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:57,910
they wanted to make sure, you
know, emperors have to sin, right?

374
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:00,940
They have to kill people.
They have to fight wars.

375
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:05,710
So the idea was you just
don't get baptized until
right before you die and then

376
00:23:05,711 --> 00:23:09,520
you can go to heaven. So that's what
this is talking about, keeping your bed.

377
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:11,740
Cause I'm pure.
Um,

378
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:17,380
some um, in paragraph, uh,
yeah, below that, the last,

379
00:23:17,381 --> 00:23:19,360
bless it bless it.
Or the bodies are the virgins.

380
00:23:19,361 --> 00:23:23,230
For they shall be well pleasing to God
and shall not lose the reward of their

381
00:23:23,231 --> 00:23:27,590
purity. Uh, right below
that in paragraph seven, uh,

382
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:30,220
the Myra said at a nearby window,
and listen, not in day two,

383
00:23:30,221 --> 00:23:34,260
the word of the virgin life as
it was spoken by Paul, more of a,

384
00:23:34,261 --> 00:23:36,850
she saw many women and
Virgin's going into Paul,

385
00:23:36,851 --> 00:23:41,770
she desired to be counted worthy
herself to stand in Paul's presence. Um,

386
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,770
now look right at, uh, at paragraph nine,

387
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:50,690
all the women and young people go
into him and are taught by him.

388
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:55,070
You must, he says, fear one,
single God only and live chastely.

389
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:58,310
And my daughter also like a spider
at the window bound by his words,

390
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:00,260
is dominated by a new desire.

391
00:24:00,261 --> 00:24:03,770
This is her mother talking cause her
mother's very upset that Tekla has done

392
00:24:03,771 --> 00:24:07,280
this because deca block off broke off her
great engagement to the richest guy in

393
00:24:07,281 --> 00:24:11,440
town in order to follow Paul. So
the mother doesn't like this, uh,

394
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:14,060
dominated by new desire and
a fearful passion. So notice,

395
00:24:14,061 --> 00:24:17,300
desire and passion again are
still part of the narrative,

396
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:21,650
but now they're redirected to a desire
and a passion precisely for celibacy.

397
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:24,460
So,
um,

398
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:30,640
the basic answer also the bad guys in
this or antithetic look at paragraph 13.

399
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:37,730
Paul and the good guys are all ascetic
on paragraph 13.

400
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,020
In fact,
right above that,

401
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:43,730
this is demas in homogeny is now a bunch
of the names in this document actually

402
00:24:43,731 --> 00:24:45,950
come from Pauline literature
from the New Testament.

403
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:49,580
So this writer probably knows the
pastoral epistles and some of the other

404
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:54,830
writings that make up the new testament
because the writer is taking details out

405
00:24:54,831 --> 00:24:58,130
of Paul's life as you'd see in the New
Testament, like these names, for example,

406
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,810
demas has mentioned in the pastoral
epistles as someone who forsook Paul being

407
00:25:02,811 --> 00:25:04,850
in love with the present
world is what it says.

408
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:07,310
So this writers talk using the same name.

409
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:10,070
So demons is a bad guy here who
had been a follower of Paul,

410
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:14,630
but he's now betraying Paul. They
say who this man is, we do not know,

411
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:17,390
but he deprived.
Young men have wives,

412
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:22,700
maidens of husband's saying otherwise
there is no resurrection for you except

413
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,590
your main chased and do
not defile the flesh,

414
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:29,510
but keep it pure so they
know what Paul's teaching is.

415
00:25:29,511 --> 00:25:32,750
This radical asceticism and Paul
links this to the resurrection.

416
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:36,050
If you're not chaste and pure,
you want experience the resurrection.

417
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:39,680
Samira said to them, come into
my house, you and rest with me.

418
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:42,800
And they went off to a sumptuous
banquet with much wine,

419
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:44,990
great wealth and a splendid table.

420
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:51,250
Notice these guys who betray Paul are
not only teaching that people should get

421
00:25:51,381 --> 00:25:54,800
married and have sex,
but they're also having great wine.

422
00:25:54,801 --> 00:25:59,060
They're having a lot of food, they're
doing all the anti ascetic stuff there.

423
00:25:59,061 --> 00:26:04,061
Antithetic so the enemies of Paul and
the Gospel here are the antiemetics.

424
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:06,350
And of course that makes you think,
hm,

425
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:09,770
who does this look like that
we've been reading lately?

426
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:13,520
Who says drink a little
wine for your stomach sake?

427
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:18,170
Huh?
It's the writer of the pastoral epistles.

428
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:23,270
Remember we saw that the the writer of
first Timothy admonishes Timothy to drink

429
00:26:23,271 --> 00:26:25,640
wine,
not to be an aesthetic and avoid wine.

430
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:30,680
The writer of the pastoral epistles
teaches that it's the enemies of Paul who

431
00:26:30,681 --> 00:26:33,590
forbid marriage.
So the pastoral epistles,

432
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:37,190
if this author knows the pastoral
epistles, he's riding against it.

433
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:40,760
And if the pastoral epistles,
no, the acts of Paul and Thecla,

434
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:44,370
they're written against this and we
don't know that they knew each other.

435
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:47,880
Exactly. Those entirely possible
that this author, a new,

436
00:26:47,881 --> 00:26:51,360
some of those new Paul's writings now.
Okay,

437
00:26:51,361 --> 00:26:56,361
so basically what is the problem
of life according to this author,

438
00:26:57,030 --> 00:27:01,080
sex and family?
What's the answer to life?

439
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:04,530
Avoiding sex and family.
And then you experienced the resurrection.

440
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:08,340
But that means what is the
deeper problem than that?

441
00:27:08,341 --> 00:27:12,630
This is addressing and here are the
problem. You can see it in paragraph 17.

442
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:14,653
Okay.

443
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:25,290
Uh, this is Paul talking to
the pro console, the living
God, the god of vengeance,

444
00:27:25,291 --> 00:27:26,101
the jealous God,

445
00:27:26,101 --> 00:27:30,150
the God who has need of nothing has sent
me since he desires the salvation of

446
00:27:30,151 --> 00:27:34,800
men, that I may draw them away
from corruption and impurity,

447
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:40,520
all pleasure and death that
they may send no more notice.

448
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:45,810
Corruption, impurity, pleasure, death.

449
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:48,540
Those are all linked together.

450
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:53,870
And here's the clue that helps you
see what's going on with the allure of

451
00:27:57,061 --> 00:28:00,750
asceticism for these ancient
Christians in the ancient world.

452
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:04,080
This is something also that's
changed radically since the 1970s.

453
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:08,170
The 1970s changed dramatically.
Uh,

454
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:12,960
with regard to family sexuality. It's, you
know, the time of the sexual revolution,

455
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:17,430
the time of the, just people's
attitudes changing completely. Now,

456
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:18,323
that was kind of,

457
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:23,610
we went back on that in the 80s with the
aids scare and in the way right wingers

458
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,970
used aids to try to make
sex fearful to everybody.

459
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:29,610
But that was a sort of reactionary.

460
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:32,500
The eighties and a lot of the
nights was reactionary, uh,

461
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,140
to the sexual revolution.

462
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:38,220
But what happened in the 70s that changed
the way people thought about these

463
00:28:38,221 --> 00:28:42,870
sorts of things? Two
things that were big, uh,

464
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,250
uh, impact, uh,

465
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:48,750
big pushes toward changing people's
attitudes about sexuality and the family,

466
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:49,950
the women's movement,

467
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:53,560
which basically was springing out the
civil rights movement and saying that,

468
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,440
that women and men are equal.

469
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:58,500
The radical notion that women are
people is what feminism is, you know,

470
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,200
so women and men are equal.

471
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:04,290
Now why was that so important
for issues like sex?

472
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:09,000
Because the way sexuality had always
been construed up to that point was that

473
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,410
the sex act itself,
uh,

474
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:16,080
the heterosexual sex act and homosexual
sex acts were always interpreted in the

475
00:29:16,081 --> 00:29:17,520
frame of heterosexual sex.

476
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:23,220
Heterosexual sex acts embodies in it's
very practices the hierarchy of man over

477
00:29:23,221 --> 00:29:27,900
woman. The idea is man is
superior. He supposed to be on top.

478
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:32,040
So the preferred position is the
missionary position. And in fact,

479
00:29:32,041 --> 00:29:33,840
in ancient Judaism and Christianity,

480
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:38,870
it was considered abominable if it was
considered sex against nature to have the

481
00:29:40,171 --> 00:29:43,750
woman penetrate the man in any way.
Why?

482
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:47,980
Because they considered it only natural
that the man is the superior one and he

483
00:29:47,981 --> 00:29:49,840
penetrates the woman May.

484
00:29:49,841 --> 00:29:54,400
It's mailed to penetrate it's feminine
to be penetrated and they believe that

485
00:29:54,401 --> 00:29:58,270
whether it was a penis,
vagina, vagina, sex,

486
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:02,140
or whether it was oral sex or whether
it was anything in any kind of sexual

487
00:30:02,141 --> 00:30:03,460
intercourse in the ancient world,

488
00:30:03,461 --> 00:30:05,670
and this continued pretty much all
the way until the modern world,

489
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,900
the man is superior masculinity,

490
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:12,700
superior and femininity is inferior and
that's embodied in the sex act itself

491
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:17,920
and the superiority of the penetrator
and the inferiority of the penetrate Ted.

492
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:23,670
That's why the word fucked is a bad thing.

493
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,420
Although actually most of us think
actually doing it is not such a bad thing.

494
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,980
But why is it that in our,
in slang and Cursewords,

495
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:34,720
we still use words like that sucks.

496
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:38,830
And a lot of people don't even know
that it verse to sex. But yeah,

497
00:30:38,831 --> 00:30:43,540
of course it refers to sex and
something that sucks is considered bad.

498
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:46,240
It's not considered bad to be sucked.

499
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:51,520
Something that fucks is not bad.
It's considered bad to be fucked.

500
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:56,950
Why is that? Because our entire
history has penetration is superior.

501
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:59,380
It's in theory or to be penetrated.

502
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:03,850
It's embodied in our culture that
started to be challenged. Now see,

503
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,830
you may find this kind of weird that
I'm insisting so literally on the

504
00:31:08,831 --> 00:31:10,090
interpretation of these words,

505
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,400
because that may not be the
way you use them or hear them.

506
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:15,430
What I'm saying is that if it's not the
way you use them or hear them is because

507
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:19,420
society has changed radically
in the last 30 40 years.

508
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:25,830
So no longer is it automatically
considered that women
are inferior to men and

509
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:29,590
therefore the sex act is not considered
to be one that necessarily has to be

510
00:31:29,591 --> 00:31:32,620
hierarchical. The reason that
people in the ancient world,

511
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:34,390
if they opposed homosexual sex,

512
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:38,380
the reason they opposed it is they
assumed that one man would have to be

513
00:31:38,381 --> 00:31:39,700
penetrated by another man.

514
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,980
And that was horrible because
it disrupted the hierarchy.

515
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:45,370
Or a woman would have to penetrate
another woman and that also disrupted the

516
00:31:45,371 --> 00:31:50,230
hierarchy. It has to be man, woman,
because the hierarchy is man and woman.

517
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:54,070
And every sex act was supposed
to imitate that hierarchy.

518
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:58,870
That changed radically beginning in the
70s the other big thing that changed was

519
00:31:58,900 --> 00:31:59,733
the pill.

520
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:05,110
Now of course there had been contraception
for years and years before that for

521
00:32:05,111 --> 00:32:06,220
time and memorial people,

522
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:10,720
human beings have always known how to
avoid getting pregnant to some extent.

523
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:15,940
But with the 70s and the wide
availability of contraceptive,

524
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:19,570
uh, medicines, drugs, the odd,

525
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:24,550
it was much more easy to have heterosexual
sex and not be worried about whether

526
00:32:24,551 --> 00:32:26,620
you're going to get pregnant before that.

527
00:32:26,621 --> 00:32:29,080
And this is also something that people
your age just have trouble getting

528
00:32:29,081 --> 00:32:29,914
through your heads.

529
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:35,070
Before that every time a
woman had heterosexual sex
of any kind of penetrated a

530
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:40,730
way, no what normal way people
were having sex, she was,

531
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:43,820
she had to at least be partly worried
that she was gonna get pregnant.

532
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:48,140
Every time a man and a
woman had sex pregnancy,

533
00:32:48,141 --> 00:32:51,860
the danger of pregnancy was always
there hanging over their heads.

534
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:55,370
They can accept it and they could want it,
but if they didn't want it,

535
00:32:55,371 --> 00:32:59,270
it was still hanging over their heads.
That's not true for us today.

536
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:04,780
We have enough reliable
means of contraception that
we can pretty much decide

537
00:33:06,171 --> 00:33:10,550
that we want to have sex just for fun,
without worrying about pregnancy.

538
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:12,320
These two things,

539
00:33:12,321 --> 00:33:17,321
the women's movement which challenged the
basic hierarchy of the sex act and the

540
00:33:17,811 --> 00:33:19,490
availability of contraception,

541
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,410
radically changed notions
of sex because before that,

542
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:26,690
and here's what goes back
to the ancient world.

543
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:31,160
I've mentioned this before and we were
talking about other texts already,

544
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:34,130
but just to review for the ancient mind,

545
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:40,210
sex was simply one cog in a wheel because
why did you have sex toward in order

546
00:33:41,731 --> 00:33:44,300
to make babies,
why did you need to make babies?

547
00:33:44,301 --> 00:33:45,920
Because so many of them
were dying all the time.

548
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:49,070
I think I've told you this
statistic that in the ancient world,

549
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:52,250
for the population of the Roman empire,
just to remain stable,

550
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:53,900
not for it to grow just
for tremendous stable.

551
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:57,800
Every woman who lived to childbearing age,

552
00:33:57,801 --> 00:33:59,810
which was considered about
14 in the ancient world,

553
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:05,260
had to have an average of five childbirths
for the population remain stable.

554
00:34:05,541 --> 00:34:06,430
Think of this girls,

555
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:11,570
every one of you would have to have chuck
at least five childbirths on average

556
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:16,720
just to maintain the population that
just shows how many people died in

557
00:34:17,691 --> 00:34:21,860
childbirth, how many women died giving
childbirth, how many infants died.

558
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:24,140
So in people's minds,

559
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:28,970
every birth was automatically linked
in their mind to death because it was a

560
00:34:28,971 --> 00:34:29,810
dangerous thing.

561
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:34,190
People died often in child childbirth
and women died giving birth and all in so

562
00:34:34,191 --> 00:34:38,510
many children died and they also knew
that they had to keep having babies or the

563
00:34:38,511 --> 00:34:42,170
population would shrink. And populations
in the ancient world did often shrink.

564
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:45,830
And that was dangerous because
whole cities could disappear.

565
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:49,820
Whole populations could disappear if
the birth rate didn't remain high.

566
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:55,370
So every birth was considered
cause you had to have babies.

567
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:57,350
Why'd you need babies?
Cause people are always dying.

568
00:34:57,890 --> 00:35:02,840
So the idea was you have sex,
birth,

569
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:07,730
death, decay, sex, birth, death,

570
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:11,330
decay, sex, birth, death, decay.

571
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:14,150
That's all what life is.

572
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:18,260
Life is a big circle of sex,
birth,

573
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:23,210
death and decay.
And now comes Christianity,

574
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:27,470
which says we're going to
teach you to break that cycle.

575
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:32,270
How do you break the cycle? Will,
it may not be intuitive to you,

576
00:35:32,271 --> 00:35:36,020
but this seemed to be intuitive to a lot
of ancient people who incorporated this

577
00:35:36,021 --> 00:35:40,560
into their teachings about the
Christian said stop it at sex,

578
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:46,170
break the cycle. It's sex. And that's
why these texts is not intuitive to us.

579
00:35:46,171 --> 00:35:50,370
But it's intuitive to them that if you
want to stop that cycle of sex, birth,

580
00:35:50,371 --> 00:35:54,900
death and decay, the easiest place for
human beings to stop it is that sex.

581
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:59,040
Just break the cycle, don't
have sex, don't have childbirth,

582
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:00,563
don't have death.

583
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:04,590
And of course they believed they had an
answer for the death part because they

584
00:36:04,591 --> 00:36:08,460
believed with Christianity, with Jesus
Christ, you would have resurrection,

585
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:12,090
the body would be raised.
So you don't need childbirth anymore.

586
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:15,990
If you're a faithful Christian,
you'll live forever anyway.

587
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,800
So you don't need to replenish the
population by having more babies.

588
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:24,000
All the people who are Christians who
come into Christ will be resurrected and

589
00:36:24,001 --> 00:36:28,170
we'll live forever. So there's no
need for more and more population.

590
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:32,370
So the reason that these texts,
and this is not the only one,

591
00:36:32,371 --> 00:36:36,120
this is just one places where it's very
clear because whenever Paul talks about

592
00:36:36,121 --> 00:36:38,430
sex,
he also talks about death.

593
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:41,910
He talks about corruption and
he talks about resurrection.

594
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:47,390
So this text very clearly pulls all
of these issues in to one another.

595
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,680
So the basic sensibility of this
gospel that we moderns don't have,

596
00:36:52,681 --> 00:36:54,900
and you have to imagine
yourself back into their world,

597
00:36:55,260 --> 00:37:00,260
is the radical availability of death
and the linkage of death with sex and

598
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:07,230
ancient mines. And then also the linkage
of all these other things with um,

599
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:12,240
uh, sexuality and death and
corruption. Christianity said,

600
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:15,390
stop the cycle.
It's sex and you get rid of death.

601
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:20,700
Radical as that may sound to
us. The problem, of course,

602
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:22,080
is in this text,

603
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:27,090
the people who find that message
very compelling are young women.

604
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:30,990
A lot of wives, although not
all of them, and even young men.

605
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:35,970
Also people who find that message
compelling happen to be lionesses.

606
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:41,820
The female animals also like this
message, right? Who are the ones who,

607
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:46,500
who gang up on the bad male animals who
are trying to attack Thecla in the arena,

608
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,900
the female lion.
So that this the,

609
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,230
the text is set up as an opposition.

610
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:56,040
But now notice I said young men are
also included in the good side of this

611
00:37:56,041 --> 00:37:59,820
sometimes. So what is it? What is
the opposition to Paul's Gospel?

612
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:02,910
It's not men versus women,
right?

613
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:04,950
What does the opposition,

614
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:11,390
it's male heads of households against
everybody else who would be members of

615
00:38:12,121 --> 00:38:12,954
their household.

616
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:18,410
The people who oppose Paul the most in
this text are male heads of households.

617
00:38:18,571 --> 00:38:23,571
Precisely because they recognize that
challenging the centrality of sex and

618
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:30,261
childbirth will in itself challenged
their household and their system.

619
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:34,860
You have to have sex in childbirth in
order to maintain the household structure.

620
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,840
So they're the ones who are against Paul.

621
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:41,380
So Paul appeals mostly to women and
young people already think I read part of

622
00:38:41,381 --> 00:38:42,760
that in paragraph seven.

623
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:48,400
The women and the virgins are going
to hear him in paragraph nine.

624
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:50,083
Uh,

625
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:55,000
it talks about women and young people
go into him and enter, taught him.

626
00:38:55,001 --> 00:38:58,270
So that's who it is.
And then 12,

627
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:01,670
I read this passage,
paragraph 12,

628
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:04,680
he deprives young men have
wives and maidens of husbands.

629
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:09,270
So he's depriving the men who want to
continue the household structure and

630
00:39:09,271 --> 00:39:10,320
that's why they are opposed to him.

631
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:12,763
MMM.

632
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:17,890
Notice and page 20 s paragraph 26 and 27

633
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:28,833
where is it?

634
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:39,630
Yeah, I'm 26. This guy, um,

635
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:42,080
sees Thecla in a different place.
Uh,

636
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:46,630
Alexander Sees Tekla and he falls in love
with her as is typical in these kinds

637
00:39:46,631 --> 00:39:50,200
of texts is always the beautiful woman.
Every man, no man can resist them.

638
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:55,060
But so he says he wants to marry her.
I did not wish to marry the Maurice.

639
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:58,120
I've been cast of the city taking
hold of Alexander. So here's,

640
00:39:58,121 --> 00:40:00,460
she takes all this guys at,
or she ripped his cloak,

641
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:03,700
took off the crown from his head
and made him a laughing stock.

642
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:07,330
But he partly out of love for her and
partly in shame at what had befallen him,

643
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:08,740
brought her before the governor.

644
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,930
And when she confessed that
she had done these things,

645
00:40:10,931 --> 00:40:12,220
he can dinner to the beasts.

646
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:16,480
But the women were panic stricken and
cried out before the judgment seat and

647
00:40:16,481 --> 00:40:18,100
evil judgment,
a godless judgment.

648
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:21,670
But Thekla asked the governor that she
might remain pure until she wants to

649
00:40:21,671 --> 00:40:24,040
fight with the beast. And then she
says, just don't make me have sex.

650
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:26,170
I'll be glad to go into the
arena and fight with a beast.

651
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:29,780
Just don't make me have sex. Uh, Richard
Rouse, a woman named [inaudible],

652
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:30,641
whose wife had died,

653
00:40:30,641 --> 00:40:33,310
took her under her protection and
found cover when the beast or led in

654
00:40:33,311 --> 00:40:36,070
procession,
they bounce her to a fierce lioness.

655
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:39,430
And the Queen Trifacta followed her
and his Thekla sat upon her back.

656
00:40:39,431 --> 00:40:43,060
The lightness licked her feet
and all the crowd was amazed.

657
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:47,590
So you had this situation where, what's
the problem without, what is Alexander?

658
00:40:47,591 --> 00:40:51,280
He's shamed. So in this honor,
shame system of the ancient world,

659
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:52,420
this is also important point.

660
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:55,480
Male heads of household
occupied the position of honor.

661
00:40:56,020 --> 00:41:00,550
And by tearing his clothes, by knocking
his crown off, she shames him in public.

662
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:05,110
And this of course totally disrupts this
hierarchy of the man over the woman.

663
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,880
And that's part of what's going on here.

664
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:11,170
Women who refuse their role as
child bearers, as sex objects,

665
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:15,850
shame the men who play put them
in that role. And so that's what,

666
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,620
that's what the conflict is about,

667
00:41:17,621 --> 00:41:21,400
is shaming men and rebelling
against the household structure.

668
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:25,510
And then of course there's the salon
solidarity of women with everybody else.

669
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:30,790
Notice in this,
Paul himself is rather ambiguously placed.

670
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:34,460
He's a man.
So what is Paul's role in all of this?

671
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,540
I think it's interesting that Paul
doesn't come across in this text,

672
00:41:38,541 --> 00:41:42,800
at least in my reading,
as being a totally positive character.

673
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:46,600
It praises him, of course, in prison, some
as a man of God. But notice the thing,

674
00:41:46,601 --> 00:41:50,540
some of the things that Paul does,
Paul refuses to Baptizer.

675
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:55,100
Remember it. She has a bad ties herself.
This is that wonderful scene, right?

676
00:41:55,101 --> 00:41:57,290
Where she's being a martyr.

677
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:01,010
They're trying to mart her again and they
stripped her naked and then they have

678
00:42:01,011 --> 00:42:05,510
this big vat of killer man eating seals.
Yes,

679
00:42:05,511 --> 00:42:10,130
that's what it says. You probably didn't
even know there were a man eating seals,

680
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:15,800
but there were in the ancient
Mediterranean world. So she's an,

681
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:19,170
instead of waiting to be
thrown into the VAT of Manning,

682
00:42:19,171 --> 00:42:21,580
says a lightening bolt comes down
to this guy strikes the water.

683
00:42:21,581 --> 00:42:24,380
I'm all a man eating seals die.
So God saves her.

684
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:29,630
And then though not to let those seen
finish, she, she's already, there's water.

685
00:42:29,631 --> 00:42:32,750
She's tried. She's asked Paul to her
at once and he didn't, wouldn't do it.

686
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:37,100
So she throws herself into the
water and bad times is herself.

687
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:42,170
This is a woman. You're not supposed to
let women go around baptizing themselves.

688
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,570
That could just disrupt
all kinds of stuff.

689
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:49,250
So Paul at one point says he
doesn't even know her in one place.

690
00:42:49,251 --> 00:42:53,060
He refuses to Baptizer.
Paul [inaudible] and Paul gets in trouble.

691
00:42:53,061 --> 00:42:54,800
He runs off and hides and caves and stuff.

692
00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:00,740
Who's the big hero of this story is not
Paul. He's, you know, one of the heroes,

693
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:01,880
but it's really thet club.

694
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:07,510
It's this woman who totally refuses
to accept her role as a baby factory,

695
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:12,170
and that's what women are in the
ancient world. Baby factories.

696
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:14,630
She totally refuses to accept that role.

697
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:17,900
She baptizes herself when
Paul had states the Baptizer,

698
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:21,200
and then of course at the very end of
the document, remember how it ends.

699
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:24,500
She goes to Paul and she says she wants
to be a follower of not, and he kind of,

700
00:43:24,501 --> 00:43:27,400
again, he kind of just says, no, go.
You don't leave me alone. You know,

701
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:32,570
Paul is not all that great with her.
What does she do first?

702
00:43:32,571 --> 00:43:36,620
She inherits a bunch of money. Another
rich woman left her a ton of money,

703
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:39,350
so she's able to support
herself and her mother,

704
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:42,260
I guess she and her mother and by the
end of the thing are now in good terms.

705
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:46,430
I mean, if you survive lightening and
mandating seals and God saves you,

706
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:49,820
maybe your mother will like you
better and let you not get married.

707
00:43:49,821 --> 00:43:53,480
But so she supports herself financially
through an inheritance that she gets

708
00:43:53,481 --> 00:43:58,160
from another woman. And then
what did she do? She, you know,

709
00:43:58,161 --> 00:44:02,630
she cuts her hair short. She dresses like
a man. She actually becomes an apostle.

710
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:06,980
She goes off to spread the
message of this ascetic sex,

711
00:44:06,981 --> 00:44:11,981
avoiding antifamily Anti Household
Gospel that she got from Paul Thek Club

712
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:14,540
becomes her own apostle,

713
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:19,490
spreading the message and notice what kind
of gospel she's going around teaching.

714
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:23,450
This is not pro family. This is not
patriotic. This is not nationalism.

715
00:44:23,990 --> 00:44:27,680
This is putting all your eggs in
the basket of the Kingdom of God.

716
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:30,920
That's the only thing worth
living for is the Kingdom of God.

717
00:44:31,590 --> 00:44:35,550
And how do you get into the Kingdom of
God by avoiding sex and avoiding the

718
00:44:35,551 --> 00:44:38,730
household. That's how you get
in and enjoy it and remain.

719
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:41,400
How do you avoid death
by being resurrected?

720
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:47,280
So this message is a very erotic
message in a sense. It's not.

721
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:51,060
It's not getting sexual eroticism or
sexual desire and throwing it all out the

722
00:44:51,061 --> 00:44:51,894
window.

723
00:44:52,110 --> 00:44:57,110
It's actually using eroticism and the
appeal to beauty and the appeal of sexual

724
00:44:58,291 --> 00:45:01,080
desire and it's capitalizing on it.

725
00:45:01,081 --> 00:45:06,081
The author is trying to get you as a
young person who's afraid about death to

726
00:45:07,051 --> 00:45:11,610
convert to a message of the Gospel that
will liberate you from the cycle of

727
00:45:11,611 --> 00:45:16,611
corruption and death that you will get
into if you agree to go along with sex,

728
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:22,650
birth, death, decay, and that's what
you do if you choose the household.

729
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:28,470
So it's a radical document. Now the
question is, is this a feminist document?

730
00:45:31,010 --> 00:45:31,843
It's a good question.

731
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:37,660
It raises Thekla up even above Paul
and it gives a message of liberation to

732
00:45:38,031 --> 00:45:42,560
women, at least from whatever it is
that keeps them down at the time,

733
00:45:42,590 --> 00:45:46,370
which is the patriarchal household.
It gives them a way out of that.

734
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:49,760
This is one of the reasons that there
were a lot of women in the ancient world

735
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:55,060
who became nuns who wanted to avoid the
household and you had women running away

736
00:45:55,731 --> 00:45:59,690
from their wives all the time.
Church leaders talk about it. Why?

737
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:03,200
Because that was you had to get out of
the household if you wanted to have any

738
00:46:03,201 --> 00:46:04,610
kind of independence or liberty,

739
00:46:05,150 --> 00:46:07,100
if you wanted to have any
kind of exercise of power,

740
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:11,390
you had to get out of the male
dominated household. So Christianity,

741
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:16,040
the whole strain of Christianity appealed
to precisely those kinds of people and

742
00:46:16,041 --> 00:46:19,400
the author is trying to get you as a
young person to make that choice. Awesome.

743
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:24,090
Now, the big question is
do you think it's feminist?

744
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:28,970
Is this feminism or is there something
wrong with thinking about is feminism?

745
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:33,410
If you're writing a paper this week,
maybe you can talk about that. The other,

746
00:46:33,411 --> 00:46:34,640
another big question is,

747
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:39,080
do you think this author is actually
attacking the pastoral epistles?

748
00:46:41,870 --> 00:46:44,660
Are the pastoral epistles
attacking this author?

749
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:50,450
They're presenting two diametrically
opposed versions of Paul.

750
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,400
They both claim Paul as their author.

751
00:46:53,090 --> 00:46:56,240
They both claim to be representing
Paul's Gospel, Paul's message,

752
00:46:57,140 --> 00:47:02,140
but one of them is very pro household
and marriage and sex and childbirth and

753
00:47:03,741 --> 00:47:08,330
the other is anti marriage,
anti household, Auntie,
childbirth and Anti-sex.

754
00:47:09,230 --> 00:47:13,820
They both claimed Paul is the author of
their Gospel. Do they know each other?

755
00:47:13,821 --> 00:47:15,140
That's the interesting
historical question.

756
00:47:15,770 --> 00:47:20,090
Or is it just by accident that we have
these two very radically different

757
00:47:20,091 --> 00:47:21,200
appropriations of Paul?

758
00:47:22,010 --> 00:47:26,130
All of those questions I hope you'll
talk about in your discussion groups that

759
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:29,030
this week and if you're writing papers,
push herself,

760
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:34,060
answer some big questions in
your papers. Any questions? Yes.

761
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:40,510
Is it possible or conceivable that
a woman would have written it? No,

762
00:47:40,511 --> 00:47:45,400
it's completely possible is we don't
know who the author was. A our, wait,

763
00:47:45,401 --> 00:47:48,970
is this the one that,
what's the one that Tertullian says?

764
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:54,340
Okay, so he, he knew, we
actually know that it was
written by a priest, right? Yeah.

765
00:47:55,030 --> 00:47:56,740
So this one wasn't written by a woman,

766
00:47:56,890 --> 00:48:01,760
but for some of the texts in ancient
world, they could be remarried. What?

767
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:07,570
Not everyone believes or
Italian. Okay. Tertullian,

768
00:48:07,810 --> 00:48:10,360
some people say they're talking was
wrong to tell you as a church father who

769
00:48:10,361 --> 00:48:12,010
wrote around the year 200 in Latin,

770
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:15,910
he knows the story and he condemns it
partly because he doesn't want Thekla

771
00:48:15,911 --> 00:48:18,460
baptizing herself. She's, you know,

772
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:21,880
too big for our Britches
and totally Ian's view. Um,

773
00:48:21,910 --> 00:48:26,470
so Tertullian says that they know who
wrote it, and it was a man, man. But,

774
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:29,800
uh,
Dylan says that other people dispute that.

775
00:48:31,330 --> 00:48:32,830
Okay.
See you next week.
