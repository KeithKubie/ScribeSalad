00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.650
Which function has
no x-intercepts?

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.470
So an x-intercept
is a place where

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:09.887
the function
intersects the x-axis.

00:00:09.887 --> 00:00:11.470
And what do we know
about what's going

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:14.000
on when something
is on the x-axis?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.930
Well, if something
is on the x-axis,

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.010
then you could say
the y value is 0.

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.670
Or if y is equal
to the function,

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.240
you would say that the
value of the function is 0.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.750
You have an x-intercept
whenever the function

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.817
itself is equal to 0.

00:00:28.817 --> 00:00:30.650
So essentially this is
equivalent to saying,

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.930
which function never equals 0?

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.370
So let's see if any of these
functions never equal 0.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.700
So let's look at this first
function right over here.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.199
And let me write
it right over here.

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:48.210
So I have f of x is equal
to x squared plus 5.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.230
So this is interesting.

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.770
x squared is always going
to be a non-negative number.

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.060
It'll be 0 or greater.

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:57.810
Even if x is a
negative value this

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.090
is going to be 0 or greater.

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.960
And 5 is obviously positive.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.200
So this whole value or
this whole expression,

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.380
x squared plus 5,
is always going

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.110
to be greater than
or equal to 5.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.630
So we could say f
of x is always going

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.160
to be greater than
or equal to 5.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.960
So f of x is never
going to be equal to 0.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.210
If you don't believe me,
let's try it out another way.

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.830
Let's set f of x equals 0
and figure out at which x

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.330
that might be true.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.680
So we could say 0 is
equal to x squared plus 5.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.720
Subtract 5 from both sides.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.340
You would get negative
5 is equal to x squared.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.530
And if you take the
principal root of both sides,

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.540
you get the principal root
of negative 5 is equal to x.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.040
You could even have the positive
and negative principal root

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.310
of negative 5.

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.630
But needless to say, if you're
dealing just with real numbers,

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.350
there is no real number that is
the square root of negative 5.

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.510
So f of x has no x-intercepts.

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.970
So this right over here,
it meets the criteria.

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.870
And this right over
here has no x-intercept.

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:08.030
So let's see if these other
ones have x-intercepts.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.699
So remember, you
have an x-intercept

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:13.330
if the value of the
function is 0 at some point.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.250
And we see right over
here, this function g

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.410
of x is really defined
with this table.

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.080
And we see it does
indeed equal 0.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.600
It happens to equal
0 when x equals 0.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.790
So it intersects the
x-axis right over there.

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.670
That's its x-intercept.

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.240
Now let's look at this
green function, h of x.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.270
Where does that
intersect the x-axis?

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.240
Well, that's visually
more obvious.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.510
It intersects the
x-axis right over here.

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.500
h of x is 0 when x is
equal to negative 6.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.000
So these last two functions
have x-intercepts.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.470
This first one does not.
