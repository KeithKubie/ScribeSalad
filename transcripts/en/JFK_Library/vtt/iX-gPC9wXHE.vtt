00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.040
- There are those officials,

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.610
elected and appointed, in some instances

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.210
who would have to make decisions

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.623
that may run contrary to
their special interests,

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.310
but are in the interest
of their constituents.

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.280
These are human beings,

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:27.280
who love this country and who
in the time of decision making

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.630
made a political choice that
was nothing short of brave,

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.920
right and fair, and that's courage.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.920
But this whole issue of
the Confederate monuments

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.053
well he had to do his soul searching,

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.160
and he had to think through this,

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.160
and it was fraught with
personal and political risk.

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.403
But he did what was not popular,

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.290
and some may consider impolitic,

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.640
but it was right, he understood history.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.000
He understands politics.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.750
He understand the culture of his people,

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.913
and he did the courageous
thing, so I'm just pleased.
