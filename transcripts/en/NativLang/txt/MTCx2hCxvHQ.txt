Speaker 1:          00:01          Uh, [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:10          phonemes and allophones. These are terms we use to make sense of the way sounds work in a language. Take just two sounds. N and M to test of speakers here. These two sounds is two phonemes. We see if we can find words where switching one sound for the other gives us a completely different word. Here's the word meet. Switching the M two and n gives us the word neat. This is a minimal pair. The two words different minimally by one sound only, but what's the point of this? Well, by holding all the other variables constant, we can see if switching the sounds in question changes the meaning of the word is switching one sound for another changes the meaning it follows that we're looking at two different words and if they're two different words, English speakers treat the two sounds in question as different sounds in this example and an m are contrasted and this contrast tells us that and [inaudible] are two distinct phone names in English.

Speaker 2:          01:13          A phoneme can have different pronunciations. Take this sound. K he comes up with a puff of air in the word kite, but not in the word sky. These two sounds and are different, but we hear them as variants of the same sound. We call these and allophones of the phoneme k. The same goes for mm and in the word input. I have heard that word pronounce both input and input making mm and variants of the same sound. Ella phones of the phony and the sounds and show up in different places. After s we hear only skyscan skirt, but at the beginning of a word we hear can keep cool. These elephants show up in different environments where we find one we won't find the other and vice versa. That kind of mutually exclusive relationship is called complimentary distribution. Other elephants sounds can show up in the same environment. Go back to the word input. Input varies with input in a tomato, tomato sort of way. These two allophones of the phoneme n are in free variation with one another. This last example shows you that one sound like [inaudible] might show up as allophones of multiple phonemes. Hm is how people usually pronounce the phoneme m, but it's also how some people pronounce the phoneme n in the word input.

Speaker 2:          02:53          In the next lesson, I'll build on the concepts of phony Minallah phone and begin working through the pronunciation system of a foreign language. As we do that, I'll help you uncover all the basics of phonology [inaudible].
