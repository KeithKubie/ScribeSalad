Let me show you my solution. First of all, notice in BlueJ, that the dog,

00:00:03.702 --> 00:00:09.333
house, and car class, implement a drawable interface. You see that with these

00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:14.764
little arrows with a triangle on the end. If we open up one of them then we'll

00:00:14.764 --> 00:00:22.152
see the implements class over here. Now let's look at the scene class. Note

00:00:22.152 --> 00:00:26.386
that we now have a single ArrayList, everything gets added to that one

00:00:26.386 --> 00:00:32.573
ArrayList and we just have one loop. So you can see how interfaces dramatically

00:00:32.573 --> 00:00:38.514
simplified this program. What made it all work? The fact that you can convert

00:00:38.514 --> 00:00:45.098
from an object of a class to the interface type. In this case drawable. And so

00:00:45.098 --> 00:00:49.823
all these elements were convertible to drawable and then to draw them we can

00:00:49.823 --> 00:00:56.135
invoke the draw method on each element. We know they all have a draw method

00:00:56.135 --> 00:01:01.984
because they're all drawables. Sara has a few exercises prepared to make sure

00:01:01.984 --> 00:01:06.260
that you understand when you can and when you can't convert between two types.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.400
And then, she will show you a new interface that expresses when an item is

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.390
likable in a social network.
