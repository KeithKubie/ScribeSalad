DANIEL SIEBERG: Hi there.

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.820
I'm Daniel Sieberg with
Google Developers

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.010
Live here at I/O 2013.

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:14.970
And I'm joined right now by
Peter Hazlehurst and Nik Sathe

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:17.720
from the Google Wallet team.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.230
Before we get into some of the
announcements that are

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.840
happening here at the show, why
don't you guys tell me a

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.040
little bit about what you do.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.390
First of all, I know that you
have different roles, in some

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:27.100
ways, but you work together.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.550
So tell me, first of all,
Peter, what you do.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.040
PETER HAZLEHURST: Sure, so I
run the product side for

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.610
Google Wallet.

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.460
So my team's job is to build
all the great apps, things

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.690
like NFC Wallet on your phone.

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.426
And the new thing we just
launched, Pay By Gmail.

00:00:40.426 --> 00:00:41.830
NIK SATHE: And my role, I'm
part of the engineering

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:42.480
organization.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.750
I try to keep Peter and his
team honest, in some ways.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.850
I'm mostly focused on the
merchant and developers side

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.535
of the capabilities that
[? we build. ?]

00:00:50.535 --> 00:00:51.140
DANIEL SIEBERG: OK, great.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.400
So let's dive right in to some
of the announcements.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.330
What is new with
Google Wallet?

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.720
And what, in particular, was
announced here at the show?

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.280
PETER HAZLEHURST: So at the show
today and yesterday, we

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.915
announced three new things.

00:01:01.915 --> 00:01:05.840
First of all we announced our
instant buy STK for Android.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.980
And that allows developers to
make easy checkout options for

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.360
their apps for things like
physical goods and services.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.500
And the second thing we launched
was also our new

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.050
Wallet Object APIs, so the
ability to add things to the

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.290
Google Wallet like boarding
passes, tickets, loyalty

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.180
cards, offers, things
like that.

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.360
And then the third thing we
announced, which was really

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.440
exciting, was our ability to
attach money in Gmail.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:32.880
DANIEL SIEBERG: Right, now we're
going to get into some

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:33.860
of those a little bit more.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.670
But tell me, are you thinking
about expanding Google Wallet

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.230
into a platform, in a
sense, beyond just

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.920
what it is right now?

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:40.710
PETER HAZLEHURST: Yes.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.990
So what we're really shooting
for is to try and broaden

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.240
Google Wallet so that it's no
longer just tied to something

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.330
that you do on your phone.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:48.940
It works across everywhere
at Google.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.900
So whether you're buying a
subscription on YouTube or

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.490
paying for your new Google
music through--

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:55.470
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.380
PETER HAZLEHURST: --all
access pass.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.870
All of those things are
powered by the Wallet.

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.200
So one time you add your credit
card or your bank

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.540
account to Google, and you
can use it everywhere.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.445
So that's the whole focus of
everything we're doing.

00:02:05.445 --> 00:02:07.870
DANIEL SIEBERG: And how much
of a challenge is that to

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:09.660
integrate all of
those different

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.790
services and devices together?

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.730
I mean this is obviously
something you guys

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:13.590
think about a lot.

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.030
PETER HAZLEHURST: It's been a
really interesting challenge

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.070
because we've had a lot of
different teams at Google with

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.240
their different going-to-market
strategies and

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.170
different ways of wanting to
charge people's cards and

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.140
stuff like that.

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.260
Plus, we also wanted to
make sure it works on

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.790
all sorts of devices.

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.310
And that's been a real growth
opportunity for us.

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.160
DANIEL SIEBERG: All right, Nik
tell us about Google Wallet

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.540
Instant Buy.

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:33.300
What is that all about?

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.730
I mean I think the name
obviously suggests what it

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.330
does, but talk to me about some
of the partners that are

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.810
launching as part of that.

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.840
NIK SATHE: Sure, so what we saw
was that the Play Store

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.060
does a great job of allowing
application developers on

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.240
Android to monetize in
app digital content.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.330
But there really wasn't a good
solution for merchants that

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.430
were actually selling physical
goods on Android apps and

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.970
other capabilities.

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.980
Increasingly, we've seen this
is not just online merchants

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.510
with an app, but even people
like Uber, one of our launch

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.380
partners, where are you complete
the transaction and

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.660
pay for it on your phone even
though the goods and services

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.340
are actually delivered in
the physical world.

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.620
So we're seeing a lot of those
sorts of crossover use cases,

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.790
and those are the merchants
that we believe can really

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.640
benefit from Instant Buy.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.000
From a merchant's standpoint,
one of the biggest problems

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.940
with conversion in mobile
checkout has

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.800
been abandonment rates.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.325
Where there's just too many
clicks, too many keystrokes

00:03:32.325 --> 00:03:33.540
that you have to enter.

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.790
It's a pain in the ass.

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.540
And I think that it's one of
those things that all of us

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.250
would love to see
happen better.

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.170
And we've created a capability
combined with Gplus sign in

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.220
the ability to have much,
much fewer clicks.

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.970
And we hope that we'll reduce
the abandonment rate from, I

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.260
think, it's around 97% according
to one survey that

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.580
we recently saw down to
something where it's as little

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.480
as a couple of clicks, and
you're right through a

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.155
checkout process very easily.

00:04:02.155 --> 00:04:03.460
DANIEL SIEBERG: You
mentioned Uber.

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:07.530
And I know a lot of folks in
the Bay Area rely on it.

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.870
Even in New York, I know there's
people all over the

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.930
country and in the world,
frankly, thinking about how

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.730
that ties into their getting
around needs.

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:15.810
And what I've noticed,
to me, it's

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.110
almost a no-click situation.

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:20.380
I mean it's so seamless, when
you make that payment, you

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:21.550
forget that you're making
the payment.

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:22.935
Which I think is great.

00:04:22.935 --> 00:04:26.350
I mean it removes that kind
of friction or barrier.

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:28.110
And I guess that's a great
example of that.

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.495
Are there other partners
you can point to?

00:04:30.495 --> 00:04:32.070
NIK SATHE: Yeah, I didn't want
to leave anyone out.

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:33.540
I actually wrote them down.

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.890
But we had 11 partners that have
already integrated the

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:39.830
App Store available on the Play
Store to download and use

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:44.410
integrated with Google Wallet,
Airbnb, Booking.com, Expedia,

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:49.650
The Fancy, GoPago, Tagstand,
Uber, Tabbedout, Wrapp,

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:50.850
Priceline, and Rue La La.

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.750
So those are the 11
partners that

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.140
launched with us yesterday.

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:58.470
A lot of them, actually, are
in this kind of crossover

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.790
space where you're making a
reservation online or on your

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:04.810
mobile device, but you're
actually staying in a hotel or

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:07.598
renting a car or whatever
it happens to be in

00:05:07.598 --> 00:05:08.210
the physical world.

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.630
From a merchant's standpoint,
what they've told us was that

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:13.940
this integration
is really easy.

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:15.690
They don't pay any
new fees to us.

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:19.660
The capability we provide is a
value added service without

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:20.240
charging them.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.750
They still continue to process
their credit card transactions

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.340
the same way that they would.

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.170
And, hopefully, we'll be able to
show that conversion uplift

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:29.270
with some of our case
studies have

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.820
already shown is happened.

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.830
DANIEL SIEBERG: So, Peter, let's
move on to Attach Money

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:36.470
in Gmail which was announced
yesterday.

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:39.220
Before we came on the air
here, you mentioned what

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:40.900
somebody had said about
it as an announcement.

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.200
What did they say
in terms of the

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:42.720
announcements here at Google?

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.630
PETER HAZLEHURST: Yeah, we
got some great feedback.

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:47.000
One of the quotes we got was,
it's the craziest new thing

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.010
we've heard at Google
I/O all day.

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:50.660
So that was really exciting.

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:52.690
And I think what we did, which
was kind of fun, is rather

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:55.310
than just blast out a new
feature to everybody, we've

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:56.120
launched it virally.

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.660
And the way it works is the only
way you get the feature

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:01.020
is if someone sends you money.

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.250
And so to jump start the
ecosystem, we have all the

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:07.070
Googliers in the US, and then
yesterday, I sent $10 to every

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:09.340
one that was at I/O
with a US account.

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:12.760
And so if you have a friend,
and you want access to it,

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.870
find someone who's been at I/O,
and it's just going to

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:16.330
grow like this virally.

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.140
Until we get really, really
comfortable, and then we'll

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:19.360
make it available
to everybody.

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.550
DANIEL SIEBERG: Which was kind
of how Gmail got it's

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:21.210
start in a way too.

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:21.930
PETER HAZLEHURST: Yeah,
they had an

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:23.610
invite model, five users.

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:24.130
That sort of thing.

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:24.880
DANIEL SIEBERG: So walk
me through it.

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.610
I mean, earlier we agreed
that you we're

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:28.030
going to send me $1,000.

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:28.630
As I recall--

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:29.140
PETER HAZLEHURST:
That's right.

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:30.010
DANIEL SIEBERG: Just to
demonstrate this.

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:30.940
It hasn't happened yet.

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:32.250
So I don't know if there's
sort of a delay, or--

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:33.840
PETER HAZLEHURST: Actually,
interestingly enough, you

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.040
picked $1,000.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:37.390
We have a whole bunch of really
cool security that's

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:39.980
designed to protect consumers'
accounts.

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:41.820
And one of the things we look
for is really out of the

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:42.670
ordinary things.

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:44.450
And it would have known
that I shouldn't

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:45.070
have sent you $1,000.

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:46.283
DANIEL SIEBERG: Interesting.

00:06:46.283 --> 00:06:48.400
PETER HAZLEHURST: And it's
probably just being blocked.

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:49.430
DANIEL SIEBERG: Yeah,
yeah, sure.

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:50.120
It's being held up
in some way.

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:53.530
But just walk me through
how it works.

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:54.410
PETER HAZLEHURST: So, let me
tell you how it works.

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:56.250
It's deceptively simple.

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:58.115
In Gmail we have the
new compose bar.

00:06:58.115 --> 00:06:59.140
And you know down at the
bottom where there is

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:03.033
attachments, so you can attach
a photo or a document or link

00:07:03.033 --> 00:07:05.450
something from Gdrive,
that sort of thing.

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:07.380
If you've got access to the
product, you'll just see a

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:08.180
little dollar sign.

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:10.750
Click on dollars, pops up, says
OK, would you like to

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:13.050
send $10, $100, whatever
you want.

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:16.020
As long as you have Google
Wallet, it'll either show you

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:17.600
if you have a balance because
you may have already received

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.070
some money before.

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:23.010
And once you add your name,
you'll see a nice, beautiful

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:24.520
Gplus thing so that you can make
sure that you're really

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:26.600
sending it to the person
you expect to.

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.460
And then you hit send,
and it's done.

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:30.940
Five seconds later, you're going
to receive the email,

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:33.870
and it's going to say great,
here is $10 from Peter.

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:36.880
If you don't have a Google
Wallet yet, or if you're on

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:39.512
Hotmail or AOL or something like
that, there's a call to

00:07:39.512 --> 00:07:42.440
action to go to Google and
get a Google Wallet.

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.160
And then the money will
be deposited.

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.970
And so there's a little bit of
a process for the first time,

00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:48.240
and then after that, it's
all instantaneous.

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:50.225
So if I send it to you, you
get it in one second.

00:07:50.225 --> 00:07:50.620
DANIEL SIEBERG: I see.

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:53.056
So it's not tied to somebody
opening the attachment, or

00:07:53.056 --> 00:07:54.350
reading the email, or
anything like that.

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:56.140
It's just as soon as you
send it, it's there.

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:57.385
PETER HAZLEHURST:
That's right.

00:07:57.385 --> 00:07:58.190
DANIEL SIEBERG: That's great.

00:07:58.190 --> 00:07:59.520
So who do you think
is going to really

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:00.830
capitalize on using this?

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:03.640
I mean sending money to each
other or friends or something

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:04.780
is one idea.

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:07.190
But from a business standpoint,
where do you think

00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:08.240
this is going to lead?

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.720
PETER HAZLEHURST: So in the
short term, we focused on the

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:11.110
consumer side.

00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:13.330
We had a lot of small businesses
and big businesses

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:15.640
say, hey, can we start putting
merchant stuff through this?

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:17.050
And we were like hey,
hang on guys.

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:19.140
Let's focus on the consumer.

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:22.940
And so our sort of scenarios
that we see a lot of is people

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:26.080
saying, hey, we went out
to dinner last night.

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:27.170
Can you send your share?

00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:30.670
Or I'm renting an apartment in
the city for the holidays, you

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:32.789
guys want to chip in?

00:08:32.789 --> 00:08:35.470
And all you have to do is reply,
yeah, here's my $50.

00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:37.150
And it's frictionless.

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:39.729
It's just built into that social
engagement that Gmail

00:08:39.729 --> 00:08:41.230
is really working well on.

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:42.175
DANIEL SIEBERG: That's
fantastic.

00:08:42.175 --> 00:08:42.530
That's really cool.

00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:44.390
PETER HAZLEHURST: You can
imagine us sticking it in

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:46.600
other parts of Google services
where there's a lot more of

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:47.710
those interactions.

00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:49.061
And so we're going to
work on that over

00:08:49.061 --> 00:08:49.850
the rest of the year.

00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:51.510
DANIEL SIEBERG: It seems like
a ton of potential for

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:53.510
something like this.

00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:56.620
Now Nik, I want to get into the
types of things that you

00:08:56.620 --> 00:09:01.100
can store in Wallet because
tell me about all of the

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:02.830
things, I guess, that you
can store in Wallet.

00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:04.690
Which leads me to the
question of what can

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:05.840
you store in Wallet?

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:09.460
NIK SATHE: So when we designed
the Wallet Objects API, our

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:13.590
intention was to create a very
flexible data model that

00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:16.830
basically allows developers'
imaginations to dictate what

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:19.630
gets stored in the Wallet.

00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:22.980
So the basic platform is one
that provides just name value

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:25.560
pairs with some templating
capabilities so you can define

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.950
how you want these things
to look and be

00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:29.160
stored in the Wallet.

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.950
We went one step further than
that for two areas.

00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:35.910
The first being loyalty, which
in many cases or memberships

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:40.050
in general, they are the key
engagement vehicle for

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:42.650
merchants to engage with
their consumers.

00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:45.190
And the current process
is very broken.

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:48.300
We all have tons of loyalty
memberships, and we don't

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:51.570
really use them because we don't
carry around a stack of

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:53.150
cards like that.

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:55.500
Other than Peter and I who
actually have a second wallet

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:58.870
that has all of our loyalty
memberships, and that's what I

00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:00.480
want to get rid of.

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:05.560
And the additional things that
we've focused on in loyalty is

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:09.070
adding some semantic definition
to that object and

00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:13.300
some additional capabilities
like leveraging the data that

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:16.730
we already have about a consumer
in their account, in

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:19.230
their Wallet to do
instant sign up.

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:22.510
So a merchant can actually have
their program discovered.

00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:24.840
I can walk into the Marriott
down the road, which is where

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:28.780
we're staying, we will, based
on location and timeliness,

00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:31.010
surface that as, hey, maybe you

00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:32.110
should sign up for Marriott.

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:34.510
If you already have one,
we'll show you the

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:36.230
card that you have.

00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:37.890
If you don't have one,
we'll surface it.

00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:40.700
And say, hey, sign up today, and
Marriott could offer them

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:44.460
a 1,000 point bonus to sign
up instantaneously.

00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:46.260
It's one click, you're done.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:49.820
And merchants get much, much
better data because in most

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:52.320
cases Wallet accounts have
gone through some loyal

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:54.330
customer validation.

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:57.810
So we have verified data about
a customer, there's no more

00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:02.830
Elvis Presley and Mickey Mouse
ending up in people's systems.

00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:05.840
And the second area that we've
done more with is offers

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:08.050
where, again, we've added
semantic definitions.

00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:10.820
So like one of the fields that
we have is an expiration date

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:14.020
for an offer, and the system
automatically recognizes that

00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:17.160
and does alerts and
notifications to consumers

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:20.180
saying, hey, you have a coupon
that's about to expire.

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:23.880
We expected to take those two
types and extend them into

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:28.350
other verticals mostly driven by
the developer community and

00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:30.490
what they tell us
is important.

00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:33.500
But we'll focus mostly on
commercial objects.

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:36.710
We already have a partner,
BillGuard, that's doing

00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:39.220
something very interesting
with the more generic

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:42.190
capabilities that the
platform provides.

00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:44.350
Where they have a back end fraud
detection system, you

00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:47.290
register your credit cards with
them, and they send you

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:49.280
alerts and actually transaction
records.

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:51.420
And it's actually a very
beautiful interactive

00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:53.550
experience right there
in your Wallet.

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:54.400
DANIEL SIEBERG: That's great.

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:57.420
And offers also showing up in
the Maps experience too

00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:00.870
because people are searching for
pizza or coffee, and they

00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:02.540
get that increasingly
suggested to them

00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:03.360
as part of the new--

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:03.850
PETER HAZLEHURST:
That's right.

00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:07.810
So one of the cool things we
focused on in the Wallet is

00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:09.230
making it possible for all
those things you would

00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:12.190
normally carry with you, but
either you forget or you just

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:14.290
say, it's not worth it to
carry that gift card.

00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:15.890
I'm never going to
use it again.

00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:19.090
We let you bring that into the
digital cloud with Google, and

00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:22.110
then we'll surface it to you on
your phone or on the web or

00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:24.980
in Maps at the right place
and at the right time.

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:27.465
So you never forget that thing
that you had that is going to

00:12:27.465 --> 00:12:28.910
create value for you.

00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:31.260
And it's this continuous
experience.

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.900
And what Nik was talking about
is we're starting off with

00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:36.750
some really obvious things like
loyalty cards and offers,

00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:38.970
and then as the developer
community grows, we're going

00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:41.640
to pick up those key categories
and make them more

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:43.510
first class things
in the Wallet.

00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:44.900
Tickets is a really
obvious one.

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:48.050
We've got a lot of interest from
movie theaters and stuff

00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:49.950
like that that they want to be
able to have the ticket so

00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:52.542
that when you buy it through
Instant Buy online, you can

00:12:52.542 --> 00:12:55.860
also then just have the bar
code on your phone.

00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:56.700
Well [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:59.460
you actually come into the movie
theater, scan your bar

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:01.890
code, keep going, don't talk to
anyone, you don't need to

00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:02.720
do credit cards.

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:03.440
It's all just magic.

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:04.570
DANIEL SIEBERG: That's
awesome.

00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:05.990
Well, so, we're running
out of time here.

00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:09.080
But if people want to learn more
about all of this whether

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:10.630
from the merchant's side
or the consumer's side,

00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:11.240
where can they go?

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:13.960
PETER HAZLEHURST: So, I think
our website's up and running

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:16.230
and it's
developers.google.com/commerce.

00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:19.680
DANIEL SIEBERG: OK, guys, well,
Peter and Nik, thank you

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:20.880
both so much for joining us.

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:22.850
This is some great
information.

00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:24.870
PETER HAZLEHURST: We're really
excited and looking forward to

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:25.860
seeing how things grow.

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:27.320
DANIEL SIEBERG: Don't
forget that $1,000.

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:28.250
PETER HAZLEHURST: $1,000,
I'm on it.

00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:29.740
DANIEL SIEBERG: I'll give
you my Gmail later.

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:30.030
We'll talk.

00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:30.470
PETER HAZLEHURST: Great.

00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:30.960
Thanks very much.

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:31.910
DANIEL SIEBERG: Thanks guys.

00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:33.420
That's going to do it
for now here at

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:34.400
Google Developers Live.

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:36.390
Stay tuned for lots more
content right here.
