00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.610

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.270

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.870

blue shirts, they come back year

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.210
So, our author I am
thrilled, capital T thrilled

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.920
to introduce Meg Medina today.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.890
Through her books and in the
work she does for the community,

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.940
Meg is a powerful,
insightful, compassionate voice

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.340
for young people -
especially for girls.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.660
Meg spoke movingly two years ago
at the National Book Festival

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:44.310
about her acclaimed novel, Yaqui
Delgado Wants to Kick Your Ass,

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.570
and I was here with my husband
and my teenage daughter,

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:54.410
there wasn't a dry eye in the
house and there were a lot of eyes.

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.390
So, there were a lot of tears
and a lot of connection with Meg.

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:04.860
Meg writes across a range of
ages from picture books to novels

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.400 position:56%
for young adults, the Review Journal
Booklist calls her writing heartfelt

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.840
and truthful.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.210
Her first book the picture
book, Tia Isa Wants a Car

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:20.600
when the Ezra Jack
Keats New Writers' medal

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.770
and the awards just keep coming.

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:28.870
Her latest novel, Burn Baby
Burn, was recently included

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:35.220
on the long list for the National
Book Award that is a huge honor

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.040
for an important sensitive
work of historical fiction.

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:44.170
And I also have to tell you, you
know, we all know Meg's book,

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:50.350
In The Disco Ball is on the cover,
a Sunday At The Gala Last Night

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:56.520
and she was rocking some
enormous shiny disco ball earrings

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.920
which unfortunately
she did not wear today.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.560
When she isn't writing, Meg is
busy with community projects

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.410
that support girls,
Latino youth and literacy.

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.970
These projects all speak deeply
to her Cuban-American roots.

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:18.510
So, please join me in welcoming
the amazing Meg Medina.

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:29.680
[ Audience Clapping ]

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.750
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] cross
and see a friend.

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.050
&gt;&gt; Meg Madina: Hi everybody.

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.920
Hola, que tal?

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:42.890
I'm so excited to be here again
at the National book Festival

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:46.400 position:56%
and yes it's true that I was wearing
disco ball earrings last night

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.060
and Rocking them at the
Library of Congress.

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.330
So it was all an honor of
course, Burn Baby Burn.

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.990
So how long does it
take to write a book?

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:01.130
And that's the question that
I get asked all the time,

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:05.780
it's usually asked me by a
writer who's like dog-tired

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.260
of the project they're
working on their sick of it

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:13.420
or sometimes it's asked by a
kid who's trying to do the math

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:16.630
like how long do I want to put
in to, you know, write this book

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.240
that somebody is going to
read in an hour or a day.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.320
So how long did it take me
to write Burn Baby Burn?

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:28.060
And I'm going to tell you that
it took me forty years and that's

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:33.580
because sometimes long before a
book is made up of words it's made

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.820
up of emotions and
scraps of memories

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:40.640
that keep tangling in your feet.

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:45.680
So, Burn Baby Burn is
set in Queens in 1977

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.720
and it follows the tumultuous
life of Noda Lopez who's a teen

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.990
that awful year and she's trying
to figure out what comes up next

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:57.150
in her life besides getting
away from her crazy family.

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:03.000 position:56%
But he's a thing that was historical
fiction which is a sobering fact

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.840
to accept, not only because
1977 kind of feels too close

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:13.490
to be called history, but mostly
because I'm not a historian

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:18.450
and so I was thinking "what
business do I have taken

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:21.730
on historical fiction?"

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:24.830
But regardless of what I was
thinking about consciously,

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:28.040
regardless of what I was telling
myself that I could or couldn't do

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:35.270 position:56%
as a writer, the story of that girl,
of that family, of that horrible,

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:41.130
horrible year in New York's
history was already in the works.

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:46.870
Here are the facts; I was a
brand-new teenager in 1977.

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:50.880
I lived in Flushing with
my mother and my sister.

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:55.280
My mother was a Cuban immigrant
who didn't speak English well,

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:59.110
who was a divorced mom
raising two teenage girls

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:02.520
at the height of disco and drugs.

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:06.340
She lived in a city that
was on the brink of a motion

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:09.980
of economic and social collapse.

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:16.230
My mother lived a lot of her
life in a cloud of anxiety.

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:19.150
When I think of her
today, I always think

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:24.220
of her saying, Cuidado be careful.

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:27.350
My sister, five years
older, was an art student

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:30.160
at the high school
of Art and Design.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:37.330
She was also a budding radical
feminist, a loner, an intellectual,

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:43.530
a girl wrestling with her own
identity and with her rage.

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:49.920
Together, we were girls that my
poor mother didn't understand.

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:56.070 position:56%
We were girls trying to figure out
who we were at a time when women all

00:07:56.070 --> 00:08:00.520
around us were demanding
new opportunities of ways,

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:03.720
a new way of being thought of.

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:07.180
So, this is how a book begins.

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:10.690
It doesn't start with me saying
I think I'll write a historical

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:16.850
fiction about New York City,
instead it starts with memories.

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:22.870
The big portable record player that
opens like a suitcase left behind

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:26.820
by my father when he left us.

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:30.750
The way I dropped the
needle on the LP and listen

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:34.860
to Donna Summer groaning,
Love To Love You Baby

00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:38.130
and my mother saying,
QuÃ© dice la mujer?

00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:40.220
What's that woman saying?

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:47.590
My sisters shrieking with laughter
because I didn't know, not really,

00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:55.100 position:56%
I just danced, a memory of Ms.
magazine and my sister and I pouring

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:59.350
over the no comments section
which consisted of examples

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:02.180
of sexist ads all around us.

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:07.820 position:56%
How I stared one day for such a
long time at an ad for Bowling Lanes

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:12.990
that said Beat your Wife Tonight.

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:20.870 position:56%
A memory of working so hard to get
that stupid Farrah Fawcett hair flip

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:25.720
and my very cool marshmallow
wedge shoes;

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:28.990
a memory of the loud
arguments that erupted

00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:33.680
in our apartment and
made me ashamed.

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:39.660
The smell of urine in the subway,
the pop of the spalding pink balls

00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:44.700
against the schoolyard walls,
the catcalls, oh yeah, mommy.

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:49.280
Kids hanging outside the building
on the dirty hoods of cars

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:55.000
in the summer and of
course there was the fear -

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.440
what if mom lost her job?

00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:01.370
What was up with all those
fires being set in the Bronx

00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:05.600
and what about son of Sam?

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:10.720 position:56%
So, 2016 marks the 40th anniversary,

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:15.550
the beginning of David Berkowitz's
reign of terror in New York as son

00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:20.780
of Sam, a killer with a forty
four caliber revolver and a thirst

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:23.880
for young women with brown hair.

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:28.770 position:56%
He began shooting girls that summer,
two young girls back from a night

00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:32.790
out who were sitting in
a parked car talking.

00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:37.190
It wouldn't be until March that
the police confessed finally

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:40.130
that we had a serial
killer on our hands

00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:44.600
but by then he'd been writing
letters to the city and to police

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:49.870
by mailing them to the Daily News
which published them in part.

00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:53.330
They were chilling and
poetic rambling note

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:58.320
about where he'd go next,
"I'll be back", he always wrote

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:00.810
and he made good on that promise.

00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:05.770
In all he would murder
six and injure seven more.

00:11:05.770 --> 00:11:11.680
Many of those murders unfolded in
my neighborhood and in my borough.

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:15.170
The police task force was
headquartered at the hundred

00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:19.100
and ninth precinct in Main
Street Shopping District

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:21.610
where I walked every day.

00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:24.390
One of his early shootings
was outside a bar

00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:27.410
on Depot Road a few
blocks from where I lived

00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:29.500
and of course there
were the shootings

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:33.700
at other nearby Queens' places
like Forest Hills and Bayside,

00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:36.800
only a few bus stops away.

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:40.710
So, what I remember is
hanging on a parked car

00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:46.100 position:56%
with a girl named Jenny Lee talking
about who we thought the killer was.

00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:49.820
She could be that guy at the
Deli or how about that weirdo

00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:54.760
on the bus, may be even our super.

00:11:54.760 --> 00:12:01.600 position:56%
That July when New York finally had
a blackout during an epic heat wave,

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:05.950
I was home alone and son of
Sam was still on the loose.

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:11.000 position:56%
My mother and sister had gone to get
cigarettes and my first thought was,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.750
oh no, he's here to get me.

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:20.310
Memories that won't leave
you that tangle in your feet,

00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:25.310
and so finally I had the
sense to decide to wrestle all

00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:33.240 position:56%
that disco music, all that fear, all
that chaos into the story of a girl.

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:35.900 position:56%
Researching a book like this is hard

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:39.570
and exciting especially
when you're a newbie.

00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:42.800
I worked right here
in DC at the Library

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:47.880
of Congress rediscovering the
questionable joys of microfiche

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:53.130
as I reread issues of Ms.
Magazine and the Daily News

00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:57.450
and the New York Times articles
about all the cities troubles.

00:12:57.450 --> 00:13:02.050
I tried to read everything in order
so that I could scare myself all

00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:03.960
over again and it worked.

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:07.650
I had the chance to
interview also women

00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:12.470 position:56%
who considered themselves disco
queens about their favorite outfits,

00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:16.340
their favorite dance
partner, the DJs they loved.

00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:21.300 position:56%
I interviewed a former police
officer who investigated son of Sam,

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:25.180
who confessed that they had
known far earlier than they let

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:28.630
on what the trouble really was.

00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:33.350
I interviewed my friend, John, who
pumped gas in Queens that summer

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:36.070
and he recalls the
tow truck that brought

00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:41.510
in a bullet riddled Cadillac
dusty with white fingerprint dust,

00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:45.110
fresh from the scene of
the Ella Fish shooting.

00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:52.260
Research about the blackout was
the most revealing actually for me,

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:55.340
people who are trapped in the
World Trade Center restaurant,

00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:58.770
for instance, were treated
to champagne that night

00:13:58.770 --> 00:14:01.710
as they looked at the
moonscape below.

00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:06.820
If you lived in an upscale suburban
neighbourhood, you spent the night

00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:10.250
on your stoop having a cookout with
your neighbors with all that food

00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:13.050
that was spoiling in your
mother's refrigerator,

00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:16.520
or maybe playing flash
type tag with your friends.

00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:19.550
But if you lived in a
working-class neighborhood

00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:24.280
or a poor neighbourhood, you
saw all hell break loose.

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:28.360
Stories you've known all your
life were alluded to the studs

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:32.080
by all kinds of people,
young and old, criminal

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:34.540
and formerly law-abiding.

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:36.850
New cars were driven straight

00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:39.870
through the show room windows
and off into the street.

00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:44.490
So many fires were set
in that 24-hour period

00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:48.910
that the fire department stopped
responding, and in the end all

00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:53.820
that the city had left with
accusations and finger-pointing

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:57.010
and a soul-searching
for what was happening

00:14:57.010 --> 00:15:00.280
to us, what were we becoming.

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:06.740
And so I learned as an adult about
the backdrop of race and class

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:11.750
and urban decay that I didn't
really understand at 13

00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:15.900
but I had somehow shaped
my life anyway.

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:20.760
For me, the very hardest
decision in research was

00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:25.720
as to whether I should reach out
to the parents of the victims

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:28.110
of the son of Sam killings.

00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:34.260
I chose not to in the end, instead
I researched newspaper accounts

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:38.320
and kept my mentions of the
young victims to a minimum.

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:43.420
I try my best to treat the violence
as a matter of historical record

00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:48.820
and not as a way to sensationalize
the book or to use the death

00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:53.300
of these beautiful young
people as entertainment.

00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:59.730
My reasoning is that these families
suffered an enormous loss once.

00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:04.160
Even today they miss these young
people that never got the chance

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:09.980
to grow up and I didn't
want to add to their pain.

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:16.780
So it somehow became a book about a
family struggling at the same time

00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:20.140
when the city all around
them was struggling.

00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:24.510
It's been so gratifying to me
to see this book well received.

00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:29.190 position:56%
I love it when I meet young people
who say "your book was really scary.

00:16:29.190 --> 00:16:32.230
I couldn't read it by
myself" because it tells me

00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:36.380 position:56%
that I did a good job at re-creating
the dread that we all felt

00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:40.270
as though something was
right over our shoulder.

00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:43.050
It's felt good to me to hear
from New Yorkers who lived

00:16:43.050 --> 00:16:46.820
through that time including
a librarian from Larchmont,

00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:51.190
New York who told me she
remembers the day exactly that son

00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:53.620
of Sam was arrested
in her neighbourhood,

00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:55.880
in Yonkers where she lived.

00:16:55.880 --> 00:17:00.440
She recognized him right
away as one of her neighbors.

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:03.810
I even feel gratified
when I hear people say

00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:08.230
that disco music is now lodged
hopelessly in their brain for days.

00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:11.190
You know Roger Sutton

00:17:11.190 --> 00:17:17.450
at the hornbook humming Burn Baby
Burn is just too good for words.

00:17:17.450 --> 00:17:19.310
So, in an unexpected twist

00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:23.700
of fate something I couldn't
have imagined happened and that's

00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:28.040
that the 1970s is suddenly
so much in the media now.

00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:33.600
Does anybody here watch The Get
Down on Netflix that has taken over

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:36.230
and there were episodes of Vinyl,

00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:40.470
polyester is back people
whether you wanted or not?

00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:45.900
So I could ask myself why, why
the 70, why this look back?

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:52.530
But then I think as I often do of
my mother and I already know why.

00:17:52.530 --> 00:18:00.040
"Todo se repite", everything
repeats itself she told me.

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:05.680
And so I look at teens today
in 2016 who live with the fear

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:09.790
of unexpected violence,
these school shooter drills,

00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:12.670 position:56%
the bomb sniffing dogs in our Metro,

00:18:12.670 --> 00:18:15.820
the worry of whether
someone will open fire

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:19.000
at a mall, at a movie theatre.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.450 position:56%
I look at the racial struggles of
young African-Americans with police,

00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:29.230
especially, this summer, this
week that has just passed.

00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:34.620
I look at it all and it feels
so familiar in the sadness

00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:38.940
and in the rage and
in the senselessness.

00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:49.730
Forty years have passed,
1970s, 76, 77 to 2016, 2017;

00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:53.490
it took me 40 years to write
this book and to make sense

00:18:53.490 --> 00:18:56.920
of the violence of my early life.

00:18:56.920 --> 00:19:03.060
So, I want to end here by asking
the teens and the early adults here

00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:09.050
to pay attention to what is around
you, to what you are living now.

00:19:09.050 --> 00:19:13.360
In forty years, what's
going to be the soundtrack

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:16.470
of this time and of your life?

00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:21.100
What are the social issues and the
struggles that shape you every day?

00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:25.820
What are the haircuts, the styles?

00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:29.470
What are the random moments of
your daily life that they're going

00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:33.350
to follow you forever
until you have to knit them

00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:36.250
into a story of your own?

00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:40.350
Your story will be the
story of 2016 but, you know,

00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:43.280
it will also be the
story of young people

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:48.360 position:56%
in all times because Todo se repite.

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:53.820
So what is it that you'll need
to say, that you're burn to say

00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:58.770
about being young and new
in this world gone crazy.

00:19:58.770 --> 00:20:00.570
Thank you.

00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:10.300
[ Audience Clapping ]

00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:11.800
So, I think.

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:13.100
Where is my time keeper?

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:16.810
Oh its perfect timing,
I never get to do that.

00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:19.840
I did it right this
time I didn't over talk

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:21.770
which is a big problem for me.

00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:23.830
I would love to answer
your questions,

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:27.650
I can even demonstrate
disco moves if I'm pressed.

00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:29.740
So, you know, come forward.

00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:34.960
I think there's two microphones
and don't leave me hanging people.

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:36.260
Yeah.

00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:41.780 position:56%
&gt;&gt; So why do you think despair makes
for such an interesting book topic?

00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:46.750
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Despair because
when I think of being a teenager

00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:52.600
that sadly, the feeling that
I associate with what it was

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:57.470
like to be young was despair.

00:20:57.470 --> 00:21:00.550
Like it was fun; it
involved friends,

00:21:00.550 --> 00:21:04.410
it involved joyeus things that,
you know, parents always tell you,

00:21:04.410 --> 00:21:06.220
you should be grateful for.

00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:09.060
For example, I'm sure you've
heard your parents say:

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:10.710
what are you complaining about?

00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:13.760
This is the best time of
your life etcetera, etcetera.

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:17.490
And all the young people are
like, have you lost your mind?

00:21:17.490 --> 00:21:24.620 position:56%
Because it's painful, because
there's no way to unfold as a person

00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:30.350
without killing off some
parts, distancing ourselves

00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:35.580
from people we love, duking
it out, loathing ourselves.

00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:41.210
And so I think that is a connection
and I think most of the teens

00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:47.420
in here those days when you
wake up and you're just mad.

00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:51.940
You're just mad inside,
the world feels angry

00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:55.230 position:56%
and that's what I wanted to capture.

00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:58.820
Thank you for that question.

00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:00.850
Anybody else?

00:22:00.850 --> 00:22:04.420
Come on. Alright am I really
going to have to do the hustle?

00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:05.910
Okay, here comes Mary.

00:22:05.910 --> 00:22:07.210
Hey.

00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:08.700
&gt;&gt; Mary Quattlebaum: But you know,
I'm going to put you on the spot

00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:10.710
and ask for the dance moves, no.

00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:12.010
&gt;&gt; Meg Madina: okay

00:22:12.010 --> 00:22:13.310
&gt;&gt; Mary Quattlebaum: I'm kidding.

00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:15.410
&gt;&gt; Meg Madina: My former
friend, Mary, yes, yes.

00:22:15.410 --> 00:22:20.300
&gt;&gt; Mary Quattlebaum: I was curious
about what you're working on now

00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:21.830
and also, you know, you are

00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:27.810
such a strong voice for
girls and for women.

00:22:27.810 --> 00:22:32.050
You know, we're just living a
rape culture at this point in time

00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:37.390 position:56%
and I'm wondering if your next works
are going to explore some of that.

00:22:37.390 --> 00:22:38.690
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Yes.

00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:43.810 position:56%
So yes I am a passionate advocate of
girls in literature for strong girls

00:22:43.810 --> 00:22:46.000
and do a lot of work around that.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.280 position:56%
Not only in making sure that my
books feature strong girls and women

00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:53.270
but my work in the
community has the girls

00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:55.340
of summer reading list and so on.

00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:57.060
So, the next book that
I'm working on,

00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:01.210
I have two that will
come at a Candlewick.

00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:06.230
One is a young adult novel that
features a brother and a sister

00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:08.970
who end up going to
the same high school

00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:11.100
for the first time in their lives.

00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:14.240
One is a typical peer,
one is a young person

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:20.030
who has intellectual disabilities
and how they have to figure out,

00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:23.200
how to share that space together.

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:27.180
That's not the one I'm working on
now because that one feels so hard

00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:32.110 position:56%
and there's so many tangled memories
that I still have to let that float

00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:33.840
in the ether for a while.

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:38.740
So, what I'm doing right now is
working with a middle grade novel

00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:41.710
about a girl named Mercy Suarez.

00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:48.370
She lives in South Florida with
her entire extended budinski

00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:50.780
Cuban family.

00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:59.000
You can imagine the problems,
so that's what I'm working on.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.300
Hi there.

00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:03.400
&gt;&gt; What do you do in
your writer's block?

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:05.190
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: That, you
know, what I really do.

00:24:05.190 --> 00:24:07.290
I try to get up and move.

00:24:07.290 --> 00:24:14.930
I take a walk, I garden, I do
something physical just sort of get

00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:17.500
out of my brain for little while.

00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:24.890
I love to read passionately, I read
every single day for long periods

00:24:24.890 --> 00:24:28.830
of time and sometimes I just can't,

00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:34.040
melting into somebody else's
story gives me ideas for my own.

00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:38.140
And then sometime I just stop for
a while and walk away and work

00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:43.450
on something else and come back to
it when I feel little less tired.

00:24:43.450 --> 00:24:46.290
What you do when you
have writer's block?

00:24:46.290 --> 00:24:47.590
&gt;&gt; Ah.

00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:48.920
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you say, ah no.

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:53.220
Well, we all say that same
thing, well, try this.

00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:54.860
Hey, how are you doing?

00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:56.160
&gt;&gt; Good.

00:24:56.160 --> 00:25:00.550
&gt;&gt; Who is your favorite writer?

00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:05.060
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: My favourite
writer, you know,

00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:07.780
the person whose book I'm
reading at the moment,

00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:10.140
it changes almost every day

00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:14.110
but I will tell you Kwami
Alexander is a dear friend of mine

00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:16.330
and I really do love his books.

00:25:16.330 --> 00:25:20.300
I love Jason Reynolds
book, I mean there's just

00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:26.670
so many different writers and I
also like different kinds of books.

00:25:26.670 --> 00:25:29.080
Like some people really
just like one type of book

00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:33.280
but I like realistic fiction
but I like also science fiction.

00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:39.050
I like, you know, all kinds
of things, graphic novels.

00:25:39.050 --> 00:25:41.430
What's your favorite kind of book?

00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:42.730
&gt;&gt; I don't know.

00:25:42.730 --> 00:25:46.560
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Yeah, so you know
I just like everybody, I guess.

00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:48.950
Yes, on this side.

00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:53.630
&gt;&gt; Hi, I just want to say thank
you for being, for making a space

00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:58.150
for Hispanic writers and for being
such a strong Hispanic role model

00:25:58.150 --> 00:26:00.820
for people who want to
write and like there is no

00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:04.810
that many Hispanic writers right
now so I'll just say, thank you.

00:26:04.810 --> 00:26:06.110
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Oh, my gosh.

00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:09.880
That makes me feel wonderful
and thank you and I want

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:15.530
to tell you I want you to
follow Latinos in Kid Lit

00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:20.710 position:56%
because it's a wonderful blog of all
of the new Latino writers coming up.

00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:26.120
And there's just so many
exciting voices producing work

00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:28.880
and maybe yours will be
added in there as well.

00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:34.610
I think there's been no better
time to be a Latino writer than now

00:26:34.610 --> 00:26:37.590
because we do know each other.

00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:42.730
We are making community and
we are also sort of working

00:26:42.730 --> 00:26:47.400
as literary activists, there
is no other option, right?

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:51.610 position:56%
When we have so few books that are
published by people of color, right?

00:26:51.610 --> 00:26:57.470 position:56%
So, we write our work and we send
it out into the world but then we're

00:26:57.470 --> 00:26:59.440
in schools, we're working
with young people.

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:02.320
We're working with new
writers and we're trying

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:07.760
to be literary citizens really
Sue da danos [phonetic].

00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:11.540
&gt;&gt; I also like how
you're being Hispanic

00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:15.320
and you're creating Hispanic
characters and it's not normal

00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:18.250
if we don't make the space, no
one is going to do it for us.

00:27:18.250 --> 00:27:19.550
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Right.

00:27:19.550 --> 00:27:21.150
&gt;&gt; So you're, you're really
taking a stance there, and...

00:27:21.150 --> 00:27:22.980 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Thank you, thank you.

00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:28.240
And I hope that I'm the
representations I make feel real

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:34.510
and authentic because that
matters beyond the piÃ±ata matters.

[ Audience Clapping ]

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:40.060
Can I take one here?

00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:41.480
Yes.

00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:46.140 position:56%
&gt;&gt; So I have a book that I'm writing
and a character in it emerged

00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:49.050
that is a young Hispanic girl

00:27:49.050 --> 00:27:52.510
and I'm just wondering
what should I be careful

00:27:52.510 --> 00:27:56.320
of as a non-Hispanic
writing this character?

00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:57.620
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Yeah.

00:27:57.620 --> 00:28:00.840
&gt;&gt; So I don't want to, you
know, just do the piÃ±atas.

00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:02.140
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Yes,
well I have two minutes.

00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:03.440
So that's a scary question.

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:06.090
So, here's what I would say.

00:28:06.090 --> 00:28:09.960
It's very easy to get
it wrong and the way

00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:12.650
that people typically get it
wrong is not in the big things,

00:28:12.650 --> 00:28:16.190
it's in the small details
of people's lives.

00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:20.090
Always write a person,
a person who is

00:28:20.090 --> 00:28:22.420
of a culture not the
other way around,

00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:24.490
a culture who is a
person in your book.

00:28:24.490 --> 00:28:27.370
So, you need to be careful of that.

00:28:27.370 --> 00:28:30.880
If you hang out after
work you and I can talk.

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:33.240
There's someone who just
did a pretty good blog post

00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:40.820
on some things, but if I were you
the best advice I could give you is

00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:45.710
to write the person, to vet the
book with people of that culture,

00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:49.460
and to listen to their advice

00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:53.640
when they say you got this
wrong or maybe consider that.

00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:56.800
It'll just spare you
I think some pain.

00:28:58.200 --> 00:28:59.500
Yes.

00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:01.640
&gt;&gt; I'm the mother of a budding
young writer and I don't know

00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:04.170
if you are physically writing
as a teenager but if you were,

00:29:04.170 --> 00:29:06.960
did you have some kind of, you
know, daily practice, writing?

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:08.260
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Yeah.

00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:11.880
I was writing always but I
didn't have a daily practice,

00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:14.010
I don't keep a journal, right?

00:29:14.010 --> 00:29:16.570
Only in emergencies I
did, I keep a journal

00:29:16.570 --> 00:29:20.260
for certain really key
moments but I don't.

00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:24.950
I think the practice that I have
that has been with me since I was

00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:28.420
in the third grade is
that I read voraciously.

00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:36.000
I'm never not reading and it gives
you avenues into other ideas,

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.930
into other people's
lives, into vocabulary.

00:29:38.930 --> 00:29:41.340
It's a comfort, it's an escape,

00:29:41.340 --> 00:29:44.680
it's all the things you
guys know about books.

00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:49.410
I cannot imagine my life
without story and books,

00:29:49.410 --> 00:29:53.080
so if I had somebody who is a
budding writer I would give them a

00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:57.830
whole room in your house man
that is filled with books.

00:29:57.830 --> 00:29:59.130
You're welcome.

00:29:59.130 --> 00:30:00.430
&gt;&gt; Did you know you
wanted to be a writer?

00:30:00.430 --> 00:30:01.960
Did you know you wanted
to be a writer?

00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:06.170
&gt;&gt; Meg Medina: Yes, I did but it
took me a long time to admit it

00:30:06.170 --> 00:30:09.520
and the sign now says
wrap up please.

00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:12.200
So I want to thank you
so much for coming out.

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:16.110
I want you to go disco dancing
in the near future and thanks

00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:18.390
for coming out and enjoy
the rest of the festival.
