00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:05.472
(sighs)

00:00:06.472 --> 00:00:07.407
 - Can you hold that?

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.110
Can you hold that for me please?

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:13.279 size:88% position:44%

- No, no, no, it's okay.

00:00:16.549 --> 00:00:17.450
 - You're Josh Duhamel.

00:00:17.483 --> 00:00:18.584
- Mhmm.

00:00:18.617 --> 00:00:21.687 align:start size:88% position:13%

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.756
 - Ah, oh you're here for the--

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:24.757

  This is my first--

00:00:25.758 --> 00:00:26.559
 - This is your first junket?

00:00:26.592 --> 00:00:27.727 size:84% position:42%
  - Very first one.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:28.461 align:start size:88% position:13%

00:00:28.494 --> 00:00:29.462

00:00:29.495 --> 00:00:30.530
- Yeah there's no need to rush.

00:00:30.563 --> 00:00:31.564
 They can't start without me.

00:00:31.597 --> 00:00:34.034 size:88% position:44%
  (laughing)

00:00:34.834 --> 00:00:36.436
 I hate these things.

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:39.572 align:start position:0%
  They ask the same goddamn
  questions every day

00:00:39.605 --> 00:00:40.740
and it's like...

00:00:42.441 --> 00:00:44.544 size:88% position:44%
  - And I got a whole lot of
  great questions prepared.

00:00:44.577 --> 00:00:45.412
- Good.

00:00:48.614 --> 00:00:50.383
 Yeah I just come in
 here to clear my head.

00:00:50.416 --> 00:00:51.651
You know, little peace and quiet

00:00:51.684 --> 00:00:53.753 align:start size:88% position:13%
 before the storm,
 you know what I mean?

00:00:53.786 --> 00:00:56.556 align:start position:0%
 I'm not masturbating or
 anything, just so you know.

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:57.390
- Okay.

00:00:57.423 --> 00:00:58.224
- That would be creepy.

00:00:58.257 --> 00:00:59.292
 - Okay, yeah.

00:00:59.325 --> 00:01:01.561
 Didn't cross my mind once, so.

00:01:01.594 --> 00:01:02.728 size:88% position:44%
  - I'm not a creep.

00:01:02.761 --> 00:01:04.464
- I understand.

00:01:04.497 --> 00:01:05.731
 - Okay, good.

00:01:05.764 --> 00:01:06.599
 - Yep.

00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:09.268 size:84% position:42%
  It was great to meet you.

00:01:09.301 --> 00:01:10.203

00:01:10.236 --> 00:01:11.170 size:84% position:42%

00:01:11.203 --> 00:01:12.205

00:01:30.623 --> 00:01:31.757 size:84% position:42%
  - Fuck you Oprah!

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:32.625
- Whoa.

00:01:33.559 --> 00:01:34.794 size:88% position:44%
  You all right man?

00:01:34.827 --> 00:01:36.529
 - I thought I was back
 at the Butler junket.

00:01:36.562 --> 00:01:38.431 size:88% position:44%
 Am I, is Josh ready for me?

00:01:38.464 --> 00:01:40.433

00:01:40.466 --> 00:01:42.368 size:88% position:44%
  Oh my god this is so cool.

00:01:47.606 --> 00:01:50.610 align:start size:88% position:13%
 Oh the Downloader.com,
 that's adorable.

00:01:50.643 --> 00:01:53.813 size:88% position:44%
  Is that like a podcast you
  do in your mom's basement?

00:01:53.846 --> 00:01:55.548 size:88% position:44%
  - No, no it's not.

00:01:55.581 --> 00:01:57.216
 - Let me guess, you
 went to film school?

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:58.184
- Yeah.

00:01:58.217 --> 00:01:58.818
- You got a few favorite movies?

00:01:58.851 --> 00:01:59.619
 - Of course.

00:01:59.652 --> 00:02:00.386

00:02:03.122 --> 00:02:05.658 size:88% position:44%
  (chuckles)

00:02:05.691 --> 00:02:08.461
- There are hot dogs over here.

00:02:09.628 --> 00:02:11.464
 - Good talk.

00:02:11.497 --> 00:02:12.298
- Josh, good to see you.

00:02:12.331 --> 00:02:13.232 size:88% position:44%
  This movie's cute.

00:02:13.265 --> 00:02:14.167
 - Thank you.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.268
 - Looks really great.

00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:18.404 size:88% position:44%
  In the production notes,
  the summary was very cute.

00:02:18.437 --> 00:02:19.372
 - Oh so you haven't actually--

00:02:19.405 --> 00:02:20.706
 - I'm gonna see it probably.

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.208
 How are you, good to see you.

00:02:22.241 --> 00:02:23.509 align:start size:88% position:13%
 I'm having a fucking
 hell of a day.

00:02:23.542 --> 00:02:24.577
 - Are you doing okay?

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:25.778
 - Well that's just it.

00:02:25.811 --> 00:02:27.480 size:84% position:42%
  You know Britney.

00:02:27.513 --> 00:02:29.549 size:84% position:42%
  - I know Britney, yeah I
  see you two all the time.

00:02:29.582 --> 00:02:30.449 size:88% position:44%
 - She's leaving me.

00:02:30.482 --> 00:02:32.051
She's leaving me, yeah.

00:02:32.084 --> 00:02:34.187 align:start position:0%
 There was a little incident
 with my chambermaid

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.454
 when I was in a hotel.

00:02:35.487 --> 00:02:36.321 size:88% position:44%
  - Oh yeah.

00:02:36.355 --> 00:02:38.658 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - I got a blowjob
 from the chambermaid.

00:02:38.691 --> 00:02:40.560
Britney picks up on it.

00:02:40.593 --> 00:02:42.295
 She's upset, and then
 she springs with me

00:02:42.328 --> 00:02:45.331
that she's boning our gardener.

00:02:45.364 --> 00:02:46.199 size:84% position:42%
  - No way!

00:02:48.534 --> 00:02:49.835
 What a mess.

00:02:49.868 --> 00:02:52.638 size:88% position:44%
 - And I was giving
 this moron a leg up

00:02:52.671 --> 00:02:54.640
and he's boning my wife.

00:02:54.673 --> 00:02:56.542
 - I'm sorry I asked.

00:02:56.575 --> 00:02:58.411
 - She's a dingbat, but

00:02:59.845 --> 00:03:01.314
loves it in the caboose.

00:03:01.347 --> 00:03:02.281

00:03:02.314 --> 00:03:03.482 size:88% position:44%

  - Loves it in the caboose.

00:03:06.752 --> 00:03:08.187 size:88% position:44%
  I thought you said
  she was lovesick--

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.357 size:88% position:44%
  - She's a dingbat,
  but loves it in...

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:12.491 size:84% position:42%
  - [Voiceover] One minute.

00:03:12.524 --> 00:03:13.526
- Protein shake.

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:16.029 size:88% position:44%
  (chuckles)

00:03:19.331 --> 00:03:20.132
 - I think that's it.

00:03:20.165 --> 00:03:21.067 size:88% position:44%
 I think we're done.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.702
 - This movie looks terrific.

00:03:22.735 --> 00:03:23.669
 - It was good to see you man.

00:03:23.702 --> 00:03:24.637
I wish you all the best.

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:25.605
 - Do we have enough?

00:03:25.638 --> 00:03:26.439
You think we got enough?

00:03:26.472 --> 00:03:27.473
 - I think we got it.

00:03:27.506 --> 00:03:28.307

- Brian Butler.

00:03:29.808 --> 00:03:30.710
 - Are you on Snapchat?

00:03:30.743 --> 00:03:32.144 size:88% position:44%
  You should be on Snapchat.

00:03:32.177 --> 00:03:33.079
 - Oh my god I just ate
 like 30 egg whites.

00:03:33.112 --> 00:03:34.513 size:88% position:44%
  I feel like a fucking cow.

00:03:34.546 --> 00:03:35.414 align:start position:0%
Are you talking about how you're
going to take Kevin's job?

00:03:35.447 --> 00:03:36.382
- Maybe.

00:03:36.415 --> 00:03:37.516
 - Hi new guy.

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:38.350

I'm just trying to stay hydrated

00:03:44.356 --> 00:03:48.427 align:start size:88% position:13%
 with my super alkaline
 H3O fierce water.

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:49.762 align:start size:88% position:13%
- [Kevin] You know what,
nothing is more sexy

00:03:49.795 --> 00:03:53.132 size:88% position:44%
  than to watch yous
  shill for water.

00:03:53.165 --> 00:03:55.801
- That is sexual
harassment okay?

00:03:55.834 --> 00:03:59.739
 And if I cared about that type
 of thing I would report you.

00:03:59.772 --> 00:04:04.076
 Celebrity Wow fans are going
 to love this movie so much.

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:05.578 size:84% position:42%
  - Thank you, we put a lot
  of work into this one--

00:04:05.611 --> 00:04:07.446 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - But I gotta know,
 how do you keep

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:10.149
 your body in such great shape?

00:04:10.182 --> 00:04:11.183 size:84% position:42%
  - I guess I work
  out a little bit.

00:04:11.216 --> 00:04:12.184 size:84% position:42%
  - I mean can I just like?

00:04:12.217 --> 00:04:14.287
- No, actually, please.

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.423 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - I mean look at
 these, it's just so.

00:04:18.557 --> 00:04:20.459 align:start size:88% position:13%
  That's crazy, just
  let it happen.

00:04:20.492 --> 00:04:21.694 size:88% position:44%
  I won't stop 'til

00:04:21.727 --> 00:04:23.429

00:04:23.462 --> 00:04:24.797 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - You know I'm getting
 a divorce, right?

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.399 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - You sound so
 excited about that.

00:04:26.432 --> 00:04:28.134 size:88% position:44%
 - I'm actually in a
 really dark place,

00:04:28.167 --> 00:04:31.437 align:start size:88% position:13%
 but you know gotta
 keep it professional.

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.372 align:start size:88% position:13%

00:04:33.405 --> 00:04:35.441 align:start size:88% position:13%
  and lots of views,
  if I'm in them.

00:04:35.474 --> 00:04:37.610
 - Shoot yourself now.

00:04:37.643 --> 00:04:39.178 size:88% position:44%
 - Oh he's so old and gross.

00:04:39.211 --> 00:04:40.212
 He may as well die right now.

00:04:40.245 --> 00:04:42.048
