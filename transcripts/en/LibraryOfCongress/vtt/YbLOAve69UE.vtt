&gt;&gt; Narrator: From the Library
of Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.420
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Good
afternoon ladies and gentlemen,

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.230
and thank you all for coming.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.460
We're really delighted
to have you here

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.650 position:56%
in the African Middle East division.

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:31.950
I'm Mary-Jane Deeb.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.150
I'm the Chief of the division,
and I'd like to welcome you all.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:41.750
I always begin with a little
statement about our division.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:48.000
About what it does, and
it's -- how it's composed.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.020
And who the people are, etcetera.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.790
So I do it.

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:58.280
This event is being webcast,
which means that eventually,

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.950
if you want to let your
friends know about it --

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:02.510
those that could not come --

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.600
they'd be able to watch it
on the library's website.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.980
So the African Middle East division
is made up of three sections.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.000
The African section.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.360
The Near East section
and the Hebraic section.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.710
And we cover together 78
countries of the world.

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.650
And we collect in the vernacular.

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.610
We collect in the languages
of the countries.

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.490
And we're custodians of
those collections which come

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.130
from for Hebraic section,
from all over the world.

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.370
For the African section also
from many parts of the world.

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:42.950
But we have an office in Nairobi.

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.950
For the Arab world we
have an office in Cairo.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.240 position:56%
We also have an office in Islamabad.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.720
And those offices collect
the materials.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.100
Catalog the materials.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.440
And then send them to the library.

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.190
We're the only library in
the world that does that.

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.110
So we're very fortunate to be
able to collect these materials.

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.710
The division does not only collect
the materials and catalog them

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.940
and have them shelved, and
serve them in the reading room.

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:19.690
But it also creates
exhibits with some

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.600
of those materials to display them.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.110
Invite speakers as we have --

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:31.840
as we are doing today to speak
on regions that we cover.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.160
We also go to conferences.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.980
Participate in conferences.

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.840
We have smaller display.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.330
We do briefings for
government officials.

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:49.980
Many of who come, again,
via the state department

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.750
to the visitor's program.

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.830
They come to the library
to be briefed.

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.970
Very often about their
own collections.

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.800
I mean just now we just had the
Kalgeze [phonetic] delegation

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.990
who is made up of young
parliamentarians.

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:09.600
Where here, we're delighted
to see that we're collecting

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.170
in their language,
materials, serious books

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.360
and other publications here.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.320
And so -- and then we have
of course the specialists.

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.440
And the specialists
in this division,

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.280
as they are in many other divisions

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.160
of the library, are
themselves colors.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.460
They have published.

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:32.760
They have written.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.760
They participate in conferences.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.480
And they know the cultures.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.180
They know the languages of many
of the countries that we cover.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:49.020
So each is -- each member of
the staff is a treasure in

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.980
and of himself or herself.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.220
Because it brings so
much to the connections.

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.590
Without the people, it would be
very difficult to assist those

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.750
who come are patrons, are
researchers who come here.

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:09.750
And so without further ado, I would
like to invite one of our scholars;

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.400
one of our specialists,
Laverne Page,

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.520
who will introduce the
program and the speaker today.

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.820
Thank you.

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:24.800
&gt;&gt; Laverne Page: Thank
you Mary-Jane.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.990
And again, my name is Laverne Page.

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:33.200
I'm one of four librarians in the
African section in this division.

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.510
In this unit of the
library, we offer a variety

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:41.320
of noon-time programs on
so many different subjects.

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:46.010
And they relate in some way
to the collections on Africa

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:49.920
that have been acquired
over decades and decades.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:56.400 position:56%
So today's program is a book talk
by someone whom I am very privileged

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.470
to introduce to you,
Ambassador Herman Jay Cohen.

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:04.810
Our speaker today, Ambassador
Herman Jay Cohen is the author of,

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:10.920
"The Mind of the African Strongman;
Conversations with Dictators,

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.840
Statesmen, and Father Figures."

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:19.560
As an ambassador, advisor to
presidents, and a 38-year veteran

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:25.530
of the Foreign Service,
Ambassador Cohen has known every

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:29.450
first-generation African leader.

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:32.590
During his tenure as
Assistant Secretary of State

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:36.050
for African Affairs during
the first Bush administration,

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:39.870
and through his role at the
National Security Council

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:44.450
in the Regan Administration,
Ambassador Cohen worked to bring

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:51.040
about peaceful transitions of
power in South Africa and in Libya.

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:57.650
And helped to end conflicts in
Angola, Ethiopia, and Mozambique.

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:01.100
His curriculum vitae is extensive.

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:07.180
Currently, he is President and CEO
of Cohen and Woods International.

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:13.100
He serves on the board of directors
of Hyperdynamics Oil and Gas.

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:19.220 position:56%
And serves as a consultant on Africa
for Contour Global Electric Power.

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:22.830
His background previously
held positions --

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:28.290
from start to finish I'll --
no, I meant to say I would start

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:32.440
from the earliest and then
come to the most current.

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:36.720
So he was Chief of Mission
in Kechasa [phonetic]

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:44.470
in the DRC from 1968 to 1969.

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:47.000 position:56%
Director for Central African Affairs

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.650
at the State Department,
1969 to 1974.

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:57.220
US Ambassador to Senegal
and Gambia, 1977 to 1980.

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:00.620
Principal Deputy Secretary
of State for Intelligence

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:04.670
and Research, 1980 to 1984.

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:08.940
And I should say, we received a lot
of publications here at the library

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:13.210
from INRP during that period.

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:16.400
He was Special Assistant to the
President, and Senior Director

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:21.000
for Africa National Security
Council, 1987 to 1989.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.290
Assistant Secretary of State
for Africa, 1989 to 1993.

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:32.790
Senior Advisor, Global Coalition
for Africa, 1993 to 1998.

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:40.550
And from 1998 to 2010 he
was a professional lecturer

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:43.430
in African studies at
Johns Hopkins School

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:47.130
of Advanced International Studies.

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:49.570
He has received many awards.

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:52.970
And I won't read them, but I
will just point out that one

00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:57.680
of the many awards that he received
was the Douglas Dillon Award

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.210
for Best Writing on
Diplomatic Practice.

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:03.280
And he received this in
20- in the year 2000.

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:06.480
And so today we will
have the opportunity

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:10.480
to experience first-hand
his diplomatic account.

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:12.070
So thank you very much.

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:13.870
Ambassador Cohan.

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:17.600
[ Applause ]

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:18.980
&gt;&gt; Ambassador Herman Jay Cohen:
Good afternoon and thank you

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:21.510
for coming on this very wet day.

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:23.900
As you can tell from
the introduction,

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:27.120
I'm at an advanced age [laughs].

00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:32.000
I just want to note
about President Regan.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.210
I worked for him for two years,
and he was a very curious guy.

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:38.560
You know, I would be sitting in
my office and I'd get a call,

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:41.520
"President Regan wants a
briefing on Mozambique.

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:44.080
Can you come Thursday
morning at 9 o'clock?"

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:47.320
He really liked to ask
questions about places.

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:52.330
He just didn't sit in his
office and wait for people.

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:54.530
Why did I write this book?

00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:57.060
Well, one thing, the US --

00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:00.710
being a US diplomat in Africa
gives you a lot of access.

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:04.190
The Africa leaders tend to
like to deal with Americans.

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:06.280
You know, we had no
colonial history,

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:09.080
so we didn't have that
mark against us.

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:13.490
And we had a tendency, even from
the early days of independence,

00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:16.350
to be very enthusiastic
about independence.

00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:19.210
We brought in a lot of
technical assistance,

00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:21.590
a lot of foreign aid
and that sort of thing.

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:24.690
And we had some presidents,
like John F. Kennedy,

00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:27.290
who were very interested
in Africa and showed it.

00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:28.590
So it was very friendly.

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:30.140
So we had a lot of access.

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:33.630
So because of that I was able
to meet a lot of these first

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:36.200
and second generation,
the heads of state.

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:38.810
And the reason I wanted
to write about them was

00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:42.810
that they made the basic
decisions after independence

00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:47.870
that really set the pattern of
how Africa would react to the rest

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:52.310
of the world, and how they would
engage in economic development.

00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:54.630 position:56%
And I think it tells the story right

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:58.400
out of their lips if
you read the book.

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:04.720
Okay, so right after independence,
which took place between 1956

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:10.940
and 1963 or 1964, we as
junior diplomats would --

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:12.650
opted to go to Africa.

00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:15.270
We had very strict instructions.

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:17.130
Do not tell them what to do.

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:19.520
You know, they've just
become independent.

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:21.070
They want to make their
own decisions.

00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:22.400
So don't start giving them a lot

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:24.960
of advice unless they
ask for it, you know?

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:26.530
Okay, so they came into power,

00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:28.790
and they had to make
some basic decisions.

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:31.600
What kind of government
are we going to have?

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:36.000
Well, on the economic side,
it was a time in the early 60s

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.510
when the Europeans
were very socialist.

00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:40.820
You know, they had
the Second World War.

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:42.600
They had the Great
Depression before that.

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:46.110
And they said, maybe let's
give Socialism a chance.

00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:51.220
So these African leaders went to
their friends in the UK and France,

00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:55.490
and said, "What do you
recommend on economic policy?"

00:10:55.490 --> 00:11:00.090
And these who were mainly socialist
party people said, "For you,

00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:05.040 position:56%
trying to move quickly into economic
development, nationalize everything.

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:08.640
All the major enterprises
should be government owned.

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:10.700
Banks. Insurance companies.

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:12.070
Plantations.

00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:13.370
Small industry.

00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:14.670
Transportation.

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:18.260
Just take it all over and then move
ahead quickly with development.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:19.890
And that's what they did.

00:11:19.890 --> 00:11:22.530
They just -- and they
also did it correctly.

00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:24.170
They paid the owners.

00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:26.380
And the owners took their
money and just left quietly.

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:31.200
So it was all done quite
correctly and democratically.

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:36.270
Now on the political side, they
inherited the type of governments

00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:38.450
that -- of their colonial powers.

00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:40.460
Especially the UK and France.

00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:42.740
Which was two-house parliament.

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:45.050
Multi-party elections
and that sort of thing.

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:50.400
So after they went through one
round of Western-style democracy,

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:52.880
they started to get frustrated.

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:55.670
They said, "This is not African".

00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:58.500
Look at these British
and French parliaments.

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:03.400 position:56%
All they do all day is shout at each
other and they insult each other.

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:05.490
Africans don't like to do that.

00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:08.280
You know? We like consensus.

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:12.220 position:56%
You know, in the old days in the
village, if there was a big problem,

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:15.830
the village chief would gather
everyone around the baobab tree --

00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:17.790
if you were in one
of those countries --

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:19.570
and we'd talk and talk and talk.

00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:23.110
Maybe after a couple of days,
we'd suddenly come with consensus.

00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:25.980
And there's no shouting
and yelling or insulting,

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:28.870
we do it all in a very
quiet, friendly way.

00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:32.450
So how do we change
our political system?

00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:36.820
Well, they decided that there
would not be political parties.

00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:43.320
They would have a single party to
which all citizens would belong.

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:46.750
And to which all institutions
would belong.

00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:48.270
Like the media.

00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:49.600
Like civil society.

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:54.430
You know, we had a bar association
or women's groups or youth groups.

00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:56.890
They would all be part
of this single party.

00:12:56.890 --> 00:12:59.990
And they called it the
African One-Party State.

00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:03.520
And many of the African
countries incorporated

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:05.540
that in their constitutions.

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:07.250
This will be a one-party state,

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:11.110
and the party will be the
Kenya African National Union.

00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:14.190
Each one had their
own liberation party.

00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:17.770
Okay, so with this economic
policy and political policy,

00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:23.680
this is the way they launched their
newly independent states in Africa.

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:28.900
Well, these decisions done
by the founding fathers,

00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:32.320 position:56%
whom I write about in the book, they
had very [clears throat] excuse me.

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:34.550
they had very important
consequences.

00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:41.470 position:56%
On the economic side -- okay, so you
take over all of these enterprises,

00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:43.780 position:56%
and they make them government owned.

00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:45.650
Well, you have to run them, right?

00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:48.470
You have to run them in
order to make profits.

00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:49.770
To reinvest.

00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:52.030
To expand and that sort of thing.

00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:56.570
But unfortunately, most of the
African governments didn't do that.

00:13:56.570 --> 00:14:01.160
Because there's a tremendous demand
from the rural areas for jobs.

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:04.200
So what they did is, they opened
up all of these enterprises

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:06.930
and filled them with
people looking for jobs.

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:09.580
And they overloaded the system.

00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:11.090
There were too many people.

00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:13.940
And after a while, most of
these enterprises started

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:17.240
to become -- started to lose money.

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:20.500
Just to give you one example, my
first African post was Uganda.

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:25.100
Which is on the east
side right next to Kenya.

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:28.180
And you can see on the
map near the horn there.

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:31.850
And they had an airline
called Uganda Airlines.

00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:33.760
They had three planes.

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:35.150
And it was a very good airline.

00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:36.490
You can go all over the region.

00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:38.100
You can go to Nairobi.

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:40.560
You can go to Tanzania; Zanzibar.

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:43.030
It was a very well-run airline.

00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:47.410
But for three planes,
after they nationalized it,

00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:49.610
it had 5,000 employees.

00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:52.610
Now you don't need 5,000
employees to run an airline

00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:54.300
with three planes you see.

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:58.220 position:56%
So this was happening all over these
countries that had nationalized.

00:14:58.220 --> 00:14:59.520
They had too many people.

00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:01.460
Okay, so what happens when
you have too many people

00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:02.790
and you're losing money?

00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:05.510
You have to subsidize, and
you have to get the money

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:07.120
from someplace else, right?

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:08.580
So it comes out of healthcare.

00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:10.680
It comes out of infrastructure.

00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:12.470
It comes out of maintenance.

00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:14.390
Port structures and
that sort of thing.

00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:17.810
So they developed something
like a vicious cycle.

00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:21.080
Which, the more money that
they took away from services

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:26.010
to run these enterprises, the
more services deteriorated.

00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:27.790
And people who still
owned businesses --

00:15:27.790 --> 00:15:29.510
especially the small ones --

00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:33.180
they were having a harder
and harder time to make due.

00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:35.430
Because if you don't have
electricity 24 hours.

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:36.850
If you don't have water.

00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:40.130
If you don't have a road to
the port, things go badly.

00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:45.920
So the economies of many of these
countries started to go backwards.

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:48.280
Now on the political side,

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:52.050
what happens when you
have only one system

00:15:52.050 --> 00:15:55.160
with no what we call
counter-veiling power?

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:57.510
Who's going to criticize
things if they don't like it,

00:15:57.510 --> 00:15:59.390
or if things are going wrong?

00:15:59.390 --> 00:16:00.690
Well, you don't do that.

00:16:00.690 --> 00:16:02.130
You all belong to the same party.

00:16:02.130 --> 00:16:05.520
And everybody follows
the party line.

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:09.560
There's no media that
doesn't belong to the party.

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:15.930
And all -- most of my embassy's
where I worked in Africa,

00:16:15.930 --> 00:16:17.370
there was only one Newspaper.

00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:20.290
That was the state-run newspaper.

00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:22.040
It changed much later.

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:27.960
So there was nobody to tell power,
hey, things are going wrong here.

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:30.180
We ought to try to change.

00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:31.850 position:56%
But some people who are brave enough

00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:35.770
to start talking, they
were put in prison.

00:16:35.770 --> 00:16:38.420
It became more and
more authoritarian.

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:43.230
And the single party became more
and more of a state within a state.

00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:44.970
It became a career thing.

00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:47.670
People joined the party
and this is my career.

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:53.010
And this party started to siphon
of money that was in the treasury

00:16:53.010 --> 00:16:54.910
that should have been
used for other things.

00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:58.310
So the one party's state became
more and more authoritarian,

00:16:58.310 --> 00:17:01.660
and the governance of
the country deteriorated.

00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:07.010
On the economics side you had a
lot of enterprises losing money.

00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:11.120
Therefore, the economy
was going backwards.

00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:13.900
There was one thing that helped
the Africans though between --

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:16.890
the independence period
ended around 1978.

00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:21.570
That was -- what they were
selling to the world, agricultural

00:17:21.570 --> 00:17:25.460
and mineral commodities
at very high prices.

00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:28.770
So they were making a lot of
money selling these things

00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:31.350
like palm oil and copper.

00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:34.420
And kolombite [phonetic] and
tantalum and that sort of thing.

00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:40.130
So this tended to cover some of the
difficulties on the economic side.

00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:44.950
And also, having good prices
for commodities allowed them

00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:47.970
to borrow money on
international markets.

00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:50.930
They would go to Citibank or some
banks in London and say, look,

00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:57.610
we're producing 800,000 tons of
copper a year at $1.50 a pound.

00:17:57.610 --> 00:18:00.500
Lend us money on the money
we're going to earn next year.

00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:03.540
And the banks were
quite happy to do that.

00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:04.840
In fact, it was Citibank --

00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:07.640
the president of Citibank
had a press conference at one

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:10.480
of his quarterly stockholder's
conference.

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:14.630
And they said, "Aren't you a little
frightened about lending money

00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:16.610
to a lot of these African
governments?"

00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:18.300
And he said, "Governments --

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:21.310
sovereign governments
do not go bankrupt."

00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:24.610
Well, he had some lessons
to learn a little later.

00:18:24.610 --> 00:18:29.940
Okay? Now in 1978, around
-- between 1978 and 1990 --

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:34.850
1980, the market fell for
most of these commodities.

00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:40.230
There were other producers coming
on stream like Malaysia; Brazil.

00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:42.550
And they were undercutting
the prices for Africa.

00:18:42.550 --> 00:18:46.500 position:56%
So by the time we get to 1979, 1980,

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:49.590
a lot of these African countries
were in real difficulty.

00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:52.970
They owed a lot of money, and
the money they were getting

00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:56.090 position:56%
for their commodities were way down.

00:18:56.090 --> 00:18:57.400
So they were real difficulty.

00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:58.860
But the United States --

00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:03.360
as I remember being instructed
as a diplomat -- no criticism.

00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:04.720
No finger pointing.

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:06.330
They're making their own decisions.

00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:08.510
Okay? Just leave them alone.

00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:13.170
But when it came to around
1980, they were real difficulty.

00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:18.700
So we had to find a bad cop
who could tell them, you know,

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:20.000
you've got to straighten up.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.130
And who do you think
the bad cop was?

00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:27.610
Any idea? It was the World Bank.

00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:31.520
The World Bank -- I -- remember,
I was US Ambassador in Senegal,

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:34.620
which is on the west coast
here, all the way on the bulge.

00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:37.860
And all of a sudden
I saw the restaurants

00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:39.590
and the bars with strange faces.

00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:44.250
You know, Asians -- people from
South Asia; from Latin America.

00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:45.580
And I would say, "What
are you doing here?"

00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:48.910
And they'd say, "We're going to
straighten this country out."

00:19:48.910 --> 00:19:50.290
And that's what they tried to do.

00:19:50.290 --> 00:19:54.900
And they said to these governments
who were really deeply in debt,

00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:57.320
and couldn't pay off
their debts, you know,

00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:00.590
it's like what you see
on television sometime.

00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:03.450
"Is your credit card
debt much too high?

00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:04.890
Are you having problems?

00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:08.320
Just call this 800
number; we'll fix it up."

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:10.010
Well it was the same
thing with the World Bank.

00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:13.540
They said, "Look, we'll
take over your debts.

00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:20.120
And you'll have to reimburse us,
but it'll be only 1% interest.

00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:24.060
And you'll have a 10-year
grace period.

00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:25.360
That's free money.

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:26.660
That's terrific.

00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:28.050
So they all signed.

00:20:28.050 --> 00:20:29.350
They all signed.

00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:31.830
But they had some conditions.

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:36.220
And the conditions were a
whole list of economic reforms

00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:38.300
that they had to undertake.

00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:41.210
Get rid of loss-making enterprises.

00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:47.070 position:56%
Or at least make them profit-making
by lowering the population employed.

00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:48.530
Change your exchange rates,

00:20:48.530 --> 00:20:52.890
so that imports are more
expensive and exports are cheaper.

00:20:52.890 --> 00:20:56.190
There was a whole list of
things that they had to do.

00:20:56.190 --> 00:20:58.090
But they all signed.

00:20:58.090 --> 00:21:00.440
And they all went through
these reform periods.

00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:07.180
So by the time we reach 1995,
most of these African governments,

00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:10.980
which were really going
downhill had revived.

00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:15.640
And they were doing 3%
to 4% growth every year.

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:20.000
Now that's not enough for
becoming a really sustainable,

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.300
economic development.

00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:24.470
But they were doing --
they were keeping afloat.

00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:25.930
They were keeping afloat.

00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:28.900
So the World Bank had
done a very good job.

00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:35.920
And on the political side, as
more and more Africans came back

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:39.660
from universities, many
of them had gone abroad.

00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:42.900
Many of them had studied
in their own countries.

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:45.850
More and more of them were saying
this single party system is

00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:47.150
not working.

00:21:47.150 --> 00:21:48.830
It's authoritarian.

00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:51.370
No new ideas are being allowed.

00:21:51.370 --> 00:21:55.470
If we really want to move ahead,
we have to get some debate going.

00:21:55.470 --> 00:21:58.520
And the only way to do that
is to have multi-parties

00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:01.560
so that they can --
and also free press.

00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:06.970
So I would say between
1985 and 1995,

00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:10.390
most African governments
changed their political systems

00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:12.300
to allow multi-parties.

00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:14.420
To allow free media.

00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:18.890
So when I started out in
Uganda, I only saw one newspaper.

00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:21.130
There was only one TV station.

00:22:21.130 --> 00:22:23.660
By the time I left in
my last post in Senegal,

00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:26.760
there were many TV
stations privately owned.

00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:29.380
Media, privately owned.

00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:32.200
Civil society was flourishing.

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:35.030
So things really were shaken
up, and there was a lot

00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:41.250
of fresh ideas floating around,
and things were moving ahead.

00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:46.070
Now US policy at the time
started to change also.

00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:50.430
We were thinking mainly of foreign
aid giving aid to the government

00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:51.730
so they could invest

00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:55.380
in infrastructure, or
education, or health.

00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:58.630
We started to think well,
we ought to change as well.

00:22:58.630 --> 00:23:02.550
And we started to --
President George H.W. Bush,

00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:05.890
he was the first president
to say, "Let's spend money

00:23:05.890 --> 00:23:08.860
on promoting democracy in Africa."

00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:11.270
And I was Assistant
Secretary for him.

00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:13.680
And we started spending
money promoting democracy.

00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:15.110
Multi-party systems.

00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:19.370
Teaching parliamentarians how to
be independent parliamentarians.

00:23:19.370 --> 00:23:23.780
And also, George H.W. Bush started

00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:27.180
to promote private
sector investments.

00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:28.880 position:56%
This is something we had never done.

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:30.550
You know, we said foreign
aid will do it.

00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:35.180
We'll give money to the governments
and let them spend on development.

00:23:35.180 --> 00:23:38.570
But we reached the conclusion
that if people are not investing

00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:43.040
to start businesses; start
production facilities,

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:44.680
then they're really not
going to move ahead.

00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:46.780
So we started promoting that.

00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:51.460
And the way we did it was to
say you need the environment

00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:54.720
so that your own people
will invest money.

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:58.990
We saw a lot of Africans who were
making money in various ways,

00:23:58.990 --> 00:24:02.790
putting their money outside
Africa and keeping it there.

00:24:02.790 --> 00:24:04.640
Because they didn't have confidence

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:07.980
that if they invest it
they would be able to --

00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:10.760
their investments would be safe.

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:16.390
So we started promoting
investments, setting up a system

00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:18.690
where you can have the rule of law.

00:24:18.690 --> 00:24:22.910
Where your contracts could
be adjudicated correctly.

00:24:22.910 --> 00:24:27.820 position:56%
So that you fail, that you didn't --
your money was not going to be lost

00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:29.380
through nefarious practices.

00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:31.320
And that -- this was our policy.

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:34.210
Then President Clinton came in
and he started something new.

00:24:34.210 --> 00:24:37.130
He started the African
Growth and Opportunity Act.

00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:41.300
Which was whatever you make
in Africa, you could sell

00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:44.360
to the United States duty-free.

00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:47.370
This was a law passed by
Congress called the African Growth

00:24:47.370 --> 00:24:49.180
and Opportunity Act.

00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:52.980
And this told the Africans,
if you make it; we'll take it.

00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:54.500
Which was a great advantage.

00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:59.550
Because if you made a lady's
sweater, let's say in South Africa,

00:24:59.550 --> 00:25:01.760
you could sell it more
cheaply to the United States

00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:03.810
than something made in Hong Kong.

00:25:03.810 --> 00:25:07.190
Because the Hong Kong sweater
had to pay duty, you see?

00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:09.880
So more and more investors
were going into Africa

00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:11.970
to start these facilities.

00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:14.860
I would say the African Growth and
Opportunity Act created something

00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:17.940
like 3 million jobs in Africa.

00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:20.510
Still not enough for
real big development,

00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:22.860
but it was a good start.

00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:25.870
And I would say that
the most creative policy

00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:29.950
in the United States came
under George W. Bush.

00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:36.660
First of all, he started a major
program to end HIV in Africa.

00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:40.390
HIV was really of epidemic
proportions in Africa.

00:25:40.390 --> 00:25:43.470
And it was a major program
to help treat people;

00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:46.010 position:56%
help prevent people from getting it.

00:25:46.010 --> 00:25:49.760
Secondly, he started the,

00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:52.850
what is called the Millennium
Challenge Corporation.

00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:56.840
Which rates countries
based on various criteria.

00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:58.680
Rated by outside people.

00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:00.620
Not by the American
State Department,

00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:02.040
but you know, the World Bank.

00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:04.520
Freedom House, and various others.

00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:07.790
Now which of the countries
are making the greatest effort

00:26:07.790 --> 00:26:10.670
to really achieve a
sustainable development.

00:26:10.670 --> 00:26:16.460 position:56%
And the ones at the top of the list
would get major inputs of resources.

00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:20.690
And we would negotiate with them,
how do you spend that money?

00:26:20.690 --> 00:26:26.560
You see? So this has been
running now since George W. Bush,

00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:29.130
and it's been doing
a lot of good stuff.

00:26:29.130 --> 00:26:32.980 position:56%
For example, in the country of
Benin, who's down on the bulge there

00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:37.750
in West Africa, they've just
redone their entire port system.

00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:43.090
And Ethiopia has used that to
really fix up its infrastructure.

00:26:43.090 --> 00:26:47.750
So this has been a very
constructive program.

00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:53.100 position:56%
And President Obama has, in my view,

00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:57.050
really done some very good
work in a couple of ways.

00:26:57.050 --> 00:27:01.560
First, as a son of an African,

00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:07.890
he felt that he could speak
the truth to power in Africa.

00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:13.610
Unlike all previous US presidents
who said, "They're independent,

00:27:13.610 --> 00:27:15.070
let them make their own decisions.

00:27:15.070 --> 00:27:17.820
We're not going to criticize.

00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:20.860
We'll be helpful where we
can, but we're not going

00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:24.640
to point any fingers at Africa."

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:27.620 position:56%
President Obama has pointed fingers.

00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:31.390 position:56%
He says there's too much corruption.

00:27:31.390 --> 00:27:34.430
There's too much authoritarianism.

00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:36.770
You need better governance.

00:27:36.770 --> 00:27:41.170
We're here to help you, but you'll
not achieve development unless you

00:27:41.170 --> 00:27:43.530
pull up your own socks, you see?

00:27:43.530 --> 00:27:48.130
If you allow people to invest
money and keep it safe,

00:27:48.130 --> 00:27:49.590
Africans will invest money.

00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:51.860
We can't do that for you.

00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:56.180
And he keeps saying,
"Development comes from within."

00:27:56.180 --> 00:27:59.100
And he's been very
blunt with the Africans.

00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:01.340
I've been in some of his
meetings with African heads

00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:07.560 position:56%
of state representing the business
community here who invest in Africa.

00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:08.860
And he's been very blunt.

00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:11.480
But he's also had some
very good programs.

00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:16.490
For example, he has a program
called "Feed the Future".

00:28:16.490 --> 00:28:22.920
The idea is that Africa
needs to develop agriculture

00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:25.270
so that they don't have
to import their own food.

00:28:25.270 --> 00:28:27.600
You know, most of the money
that they make on commodities --

00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:30.580
and by the way, they had
a second commodities boom

00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:34.070
between the year 2000
and the year 2012.

00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:36.580
Because China was buying so much.

00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:40.640
This has ended now and they
have not taken advantage

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:42.940
of all the money they
made to really diversify

00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:44.680
and start production facilities.

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:52.540
So what Obama is saying, your
agriculture is very primitive.

00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:55.340
And unless you modernize
it, you're not going

00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:56.640
to be able to get anywhere.

00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:59.610
Because you're spending all of
the money that you're making

00:28:59.610 --> 00:29:01.470
on commodities to buy food.

00:29:01.470 --> 00:29:02.770
To import food.

00:29:02.770 --> 00:29:07.700
So this program, "Feed the Future"
is bringing modern technology

00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:09.420
to the African farmer.

00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:10.720
Better seeds.

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:12.170
Better storage.

00:29:12.170 --> 00:29:15.450
Better farm-to-market roads.

00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:18.150
And better communications
with the markets.

00:29:18.150 --> 00:29:20.910
And this is starting to take
hold in a number of countries.

00:29:20.910 --> 00:29:25.380
For example, Nigeria, which is also
on the south of the bulge there,

00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:29.800
is the -- has the country with
the largest population in Africa.

00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:35.450
They are now the biggest producer
of cassava, or manioc in the world.

00:29:35.450 --> 00:29:37.740
And this is a product
that's widely used,

00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:40.220 position:56%
not only for food, but for industry.

00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:42.230
And more and more African
countries are starting

00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:47.420
to reach their potential in
agriculture thanks to US inputs.

00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:50.210
And the other thing
that Obama has done,

00:29:50.210 --> 00:29:54.900
is to start a program
called "Power Africa".

00:29:54.900 --> 00:30:00.380
Only about 30% of Africans
have access to electric power.

00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:01.910
This is much too low.

00:30:01.910 --> 00:30:07.130
Because you really can't build a
factory or do anything economic

00:30:07.130 --> 00:30:11.140
without steady, reliable power.

00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:16.560
So what President Obama is doing
is encouraging US companies

00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:21.670
to build power plants in
Africa and to sell the power.

00:30:21.670 --> 00:30:23.440
Now up until about 10 years ago,

00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:26.090
the Africans were building
their own power plants.

00:30:26.090 --> 00:30:29.430
And of course, with their economic
problems, they weren't able

00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:33.400
to build sufficient amounts, and
they weren't able to maintain them.

00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:35.920
So what the investors do --

00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:39.420
and I'm working with a company
called ContourGlobal [phonetic] --

00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:45.300
is invest in power, and then sell
power under long-term contracts.

00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:47.320
Which means that the African
governments don't have

00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:50.190
to borrow money to
build power plants.

00:30:50.190 --> 00:30:55.010
And this is -- and because
President Obama is in favor of it,

00:30:55.010 --> 00:31:00.520
US agencies are also helping,
like Export Import Bank.

00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:05.710
OPEC, are providing cheap
financing, low-cost financing.

00:31:05.710 --> 00:31:10.140
And more and more power
is being built in Africa.

00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:12.510
And that's -- there's
still a long way to go.

00:31:12.510 --> 00:31:17.630 position:56%
So generally speaking, the people I
wrote about in my book were the ones

00:31:17.630 --> 00:31:20.130
that made these early decisions.

00:31:20.130 --> 00:31:22.270
Nationalize everything.

00:31:22.270 --> 00:31:25.010
Have an authoritarian
and one-party state.

00:31:25.010 --> 00:31:28.670
If you read the book, you
can see the great dichotomy

00:31:28.670 --> 00:31:31.350
between the United States
and these early leaders.

00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:34.230
Here we were enthusiastic
about independence.

00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:35.720 position:56%
We're coming in to help you develop.

00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:38.030
But they had other priorities.

00:31:38.030 --> 00:31:41.630
Their priorities were, how do
we maintain our independence?

00:31:41.630 --> 00:31:43.540
How do we stay in power?

00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:46.580
How do we take care of our tribes?

00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:49.250
They really didn't think
economic development.

00:31:49.250 --> 00:31:51.580
It took them a long time
before they reached that.

00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:54.980
Now you have the third and
fourth generation in power.

00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:58.100
People have been to
universities; have taken courses.

00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:00.180
For example, the president of Togo.

00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:04.530
Which is a very little country
on the south end of the bulge.

00:32:04.530 --> 00:32:09.200
He has a master's -- he has a MBA
from George Washington University.

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:12.590
And he's doing all sorts of good
stuff in his little country.

00:32:12.590 --> 00:32:14.350
And more and more of this third

00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:18.990
and fourth generation are
coming with these modern ideas.

00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:22.230
So overall, I'm kind of optimistic.

00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:24.450
There's still a long way to go.

00:32:24.450 --> 00:32:25.930
There's still a lot of countries

00:32:25.930 --> 00:32:30.680
where being an independent
business man is seen as a threat

00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:34.110
to power, and that has to change.

00:32:34.110 --> 00:32:38.710
And there's not enough support
given to the rural areas.

00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:42.290
And so some countries are
still in the doldrums.

00:32:42.290 --> 00:32:47.670
But more and more countries like
Kenya and Nigeria, Botswana,

00:32:47.670 --> 00:32:51.140
they're starting to
move ahead slowly.

00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:54.210
And I think in -- within the
next 10 years we're going to have

00:32:54.210 --> 00:32:58.780
about a dozen African countries
which will be the equivalent

00:32:58.780 --> 00:33:00.660
of the Southeast Asian tigers.

00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:03.530
Like Malaysia and South Korea.

00:33:03.530 --> 00:33:08.290
And I think it's worth US
policy to continue pushing all

00:33:08.290 --> 00:33:11.520
of these reforms and this
technical assistance.

00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:16.190
I'll stop now and see if you
have any questions or comments.

00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:17.490
Yes?

00:33:17.490 --> 00:33:22.470
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] the energy
development that's being encouraged

00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:28.120
and is very critical to the
development of their economy,

00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:31.400
is there a specific area
where that is being --

00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:35.450
type of energy development
is encouraged?

00:33:35.450 --> 00:33:40.340 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, the question is the
encouragement of energy development,

00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:42.640
is there a specific area
where this is being done?

00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:46.370
Well, we're working with
all African countries.

00:33:46.370 --> 00:33:51.890 position:56%
And secondly, we're encouraging US
companies to go and negotiate deals.

00:33:51.890 --> 00:33:54.050
The company I am with,
ContourGlobal,

00:33:54.050 --> 00:33:57.640
we now have five power
plants in Africa.

00:33:57.640 --> 00:34:01.870
And we've signed long-term
power purchase agreements

00:34:01.870 --> 00:34:04.220
with these countries.

00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:06.170
And we sell to the utilities

00:34:06.170 --> 00:34:09.930
and they redistribute the electric
power to consumers you see.

00:34:09.930 --> 00:34:14.260
So we have power plants using gas.

00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:16.760
Using heavy fuel oil.

00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:18.440
We have solar.

00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:21.950
And one very, very
innovative power plant is

00:34:21.950 --> 00:34:26.290
in the country called
Rwanda, on Lake Kivu,

00:34:26.290 --> 00:34:30.300
which is in the very
center of Africa.

00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:33.920
Lake Kivu is a very deep lake.

00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:38.480
It's about 1500 feet deep.

00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:42.890
And there's methane gas seeping
through the bottom of the lake,

00:34:42.890 --> 00:34:49.630
and it ends up in suspension about
500 feet down from the surface.

00:34:49.630 --> 00:34:52.240
And it keeps accumulating
and accumulating.

00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:54.900
And there are a couple of
lakes like that in Africa.

00:34:54.900 --> 00:34:58.980
And about every 500
years these lakes explode

00:34:58.980 --> 00:35:01.860
and kill lots of people
and livestock.

00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:06.600
So what this company is doing,
they've figured out a technology

00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:09.920
to extract this methane gas
from the middle of the lake.

00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:12.900
You can't just put a pipe
in there and suck it out.

00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:16.260
It's a special technology, it
took them a year to develop.

00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:18.360
And they take it out and
they bring it to the land,

00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:20.500
and they burn it to
make electricity.

00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:22.270
So it has dual purpose.

00:35:22.270 --> 00:35:24.800 position:56%
It brings power, and it saves people

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:27.960
from getting a big
explosion [laughs].

00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:31.370
So it's very -- to answer
your question, it's varied.

00:35:31.370 --> 00:35:32.670
All types.

00:35:32.670 --> 00:35:36.540
In Ethiopia, right now there's
a US company doing what they

00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:38.390
call geothermal.

00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:42.790
Where there's heat deep in the
ground and you can tap that.

00:35:42.790 --> 00:35:48.060
The country that's really used
geothermal a great deal is Iceland.

00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:51.350
They heat, and we have
power from this geothermal.

00:35:51.350 --> 00:35:55.000
So we -- so the idea is bring
the power the best way you can,

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:59.160
just do it instead of
worrying about how you do it.

00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:00.460
Any other?

00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:01.760
Yes?

00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:03.720
&gt;&gt; I was wondering what are
the Chinese policies in Africa,

00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:07.140
and does it help the
countries there?

00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:09.920
&gt;&gt; The question is, what are
the Chinese policies in Africa,

00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:12.610
and does it help the
countries there?

00:36:12.610 --> 00:36:15.150
&gt;&gt; China is very heavily
involved in Africa.

00:36:15.150 --> 00:36:21.420
And there's been stages of
why they've been involved.

00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:27.260
But since the year 2000,
China has been very hungry

00:36:27.260 --> 00:36:32.150
for commodity inputs for
their vast economic expansion.

00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:38.290
So anything that Africa could
produce, China was buying.

00:36:38.290 --> 00:36:42.730
China was buying oil -- there's
a lot of oil produced in Africa.

00:36:42.730 --> 00:36:45.000
Copper. All sorts of minerals.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:52.560 position:56%
And so the way the Chinese did this,
they would go to a country and say,

00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:54.080
"You have infrastructure needs.

00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:55.380
You need roads.

00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:56.680
You need dams.

00:36:56.680 --> 00:36:57.980
You need airports.

00:36:57.980 --> 00:36:59.280
Let's make a deal.

00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:05.540
We will do the construction work
for you based on your priorities.

00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:08.610
And we will lend you the
money -- soft loans --

00:37:08.610 --> 00:37:11.330
from one of our big
insurance companies.

00:37:11.330 --> 00:37:14.460 position:56%
In return, we would like a guarantee

00:37:14.460 --> 00:37:17.230
of certain commodities
on a regular basis.

00:37:17.230 --> 00:37:23.130
For example, if you could guarantee
us 200,000 barrels a day of oil,

00:37:23.130 --> 00:37:27.200
that will be the reciprocity
for our work and infrastructure.

00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:28.500
And we're going to pay for the oil.

00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:29.800
We don't want a gift.

00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:31.460
We'll pay at regular world prices.

00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:34.940
So China has done this
all over Africa.

00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:36.710 position:56%
And it's kind of like a barter deal.

00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:40.590
You know, we get the commodities;
you get the construction work.

00:37:40.590 --> 00:37:43.360
And they've done this in
many, many African countries.

00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:48.050
Now I have never heard any
American officials say,

00:37:48.050 --> 00:37:50.350
"This is against US interest."

00:37:50.350 --> 00:37:53.320
They say, "Well, it's
helping Africa develop;

00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:55.730
getting more infrastructure,
that's good."

00:37:55.730 --> 00:37:58.000
But what I tell my
African friends is,

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.670
"You have to manage
this a lot better.

00:38:00.670 --> 00:38:03.890
Because what do the Chinese do?

00:38:03.890 --> 00:38:07.290
They try to bring in their
own workers, you know?

00:38:07.290 --> 00:38:12.110
I mean the lowest level workers
rather than hire Africans.

00:38:12.110 --> 00:38:14.550
So that's a negative factor.

00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:18.770
Secondly, when they hire Africans,
they don't treat them well.

00:38:18.770 --> 00:38:22.300
I had a student at Johns Hopkins

00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:25.220
who spent the summer
studying China in Africa.

00:38:25.220 --> 00:38:27.750
And I asked her to give
a talk to the class.

00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:29.280
And she said, "Well, I went

00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:35.090
to this Chinese mine owner
-- he owned a copper mine.

00:38:35.090 --> 00:38:37.750
And I looked around and I saw
it was very bad conditions

00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:39.350
for the African workers.

00:38:39.350 --> 00:38:42.510
So I asked them, 'why can't you
improve things a little bit?'

00:38:42.510 --> 00:38:44.190
And he said, 'Well,
we're treating them just

00:38:44.190 --> 00:38:46.920
like we treat our own
Chinese workers.'"

00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:49.510
So that was a negative factor.

00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:53.090
And another thing is, they
don't develop management.

00:38:53.090 --> 00:38:57.060
If you go to an American
oil company in Africa,

00:38:57.060 --> 00:39:00.040
you'll see very senior
management people who are Africans.

00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:03.160
For example, if you go
to Chevron, you know,

00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:05.460
one of the big ones in Nigeria.

00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:09.390
And say, "I'd like to
meet the CEO here."

00:39:09.390 --> 00:39:11.490
And you go in, it's a Nigerian.

00:39:11.490 --> 00:39:16.030
Now he was not selected because
he had political connections,

00:39:16.030 --> 00:39:18.330 position:56%
he's been with Chevron for 35 years.

00:39:18.330 --> 00:39:22.160
He's served in Kazakhstan, and
Canada, and various other places.

00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:25.560
He's a pro in the oils.

00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:30.990
But the Chinese tend not to
develop senior management.

00:39:30.990 --> 00:39:37.740 position:56%
And the final downside is, when they
send a Chinese company to do work,

00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:43.070
they bid it out to their
state-owned companies in China.

00:39:43.070 --> 00:39:46.130
And not every company is
as good as all the others.

00:39:46.130 --> 00:39:50.950
So sometimes you'll get a company
that doesn't do the best work.

00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:55.630
And I know several US construction
companies now that are getting work

00:39:55.630 --> 00:39:57.570
to repair what the
Chinese have done.

00:39:57.570 --> 00:39:59.960
You know, especially
airport runways.

00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:05.860 position:56%
So in general, China is contributing
to African development in general.

00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:08.120
Now the -- as you've
read in the paper,

00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:11.670
the Chinese economic
boom has slowed down.

00:40:11.670 --> 00:40:14.240
Therefore, they're
buying less from Africa.

00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:18.770
And therefore Africa's now
earning a lot less money.

00:40:18.770 --> 00:40:21.270
And they made the mistake
of not using

00:40:21.270 --> 00:40:23.990
that 10-year boom to diversify.

00:40:23.990 --> 00:40:26.490
To develop their own
production facilities.

00:40:26.490 --> 00:40:29.460
They just stayed with
-- they just stayed

00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:31.160 position:56%
with earning money from commodities.

00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:34.180
They didn't do anything
for infrastructure,

00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:35.870
or for agricultural development.

00:40:35.870 --> 00:40:39.590
So a lot of African
countries are now suffering

00:40:39.590 --> 00:40:43.220
from the deep fall in
the commodity prices.

00:40:43.220 --> 00:40:44.530
Yes, ma'am?

00:40:44.530 --> 00:40:51.880
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much Ambassador
Cohan, and it's very [inaudible].

00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:58.130
But I wanted to ask you
about food sustainability.

00:40:58.130 --> 00:41:00.330
Is there a way of moving forward?

00:41:00.330 --> 00:41:06.530
[Inaudible] moving away from
dependency on cash crops

00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:10.570
in the private sector and
diversifying [inaudible]

00:41:10.570 --> 00:41:16.520
to be sources of food
[inaudible] other

00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:19.680
than maybe so dependent on imports?

00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:22.240
&gt;&gt; Yeah. If you didn't
hear the question,

00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:26.590
it's is Africa diversifying
its agriculture so instead

00:41:26.590 --> 00:41:30.680
of relying solely on cash crops,
which will be sold abroad,

00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:34.940 position:56%
are they doing things to make sure
they become self-sufficient in food?

00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:37.360
This is very important,
and it's one of the reason

00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:41.870
that President Obama started
his "Feed the Future" program.

00:41:43.140 --> 00:41:52.520
Africa's arable land that is
still not cultivated equals 45%

00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:54.840
of the land surface
of the United States.

00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:57.390
It's a tremendous amount of land.

00:41:57.390 --> 00:42:01.230
And with irrigation and
in other types of inputs,

00:42:01.230 --> 00:42:05.220
they could do a tremendous job, not
only of producing their own food,

00:42:05.220 --> 00:42:10.670
but of exporting a lot of food
to other places, including China.

00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:18.820
And really, they're still quite
behind in attacking this issue.

00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:23.970
There's always been a tendency for
Africans to favor the urban areas.

00:42:23.970 --> 00:42:26.800
And that's why so many people
are moving into the urban areas,

00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:29.440
because that's where you
can get some services.

00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:31.880
And the rural areas
have been neglected.

00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:36.210
So if they can get some
more irrigation in there,

00:42:36.210 --> 00:42:40.150
and better land tenure -- and
land tenure's another problem.

00:42:40.150 --> 00:42:44.120
In so many African countries,
a farmer cannot own the land.

00:42:44.120 --> 00:42:47.010
Now if you cannot own the land,
you can't borrow against it

00:42:47.010 --> 00:42:49.790
and improve your facilities.

00:42:49.790 --> 00:42:53.160
So there's a lot of hard work that
can be done, and that's why I'm

00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:57.960
so happy that President
Obama has made farming,

00:42:57.960 --> 00:43:00.930
and improved technology
for farming one

00:43:00.930 --> 00:43:03.600
of his highest priorities
for Africa.

00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:05.710
Some countries are moving ahead.

00:43:05.710 --> 00:43:07.010
Especially Nigeria.

00:43:07.010 --> 00:43:09.990
I really have a lot of faith
in Nigeria, which is --

00:43:09.990 --> 00:43:11.450
has the biggest population.

00:43:11.450 --> 00:43:13.370
Kenya is doing very well.

00:43:13.370 --> 00:43:17.110
South Africa has always been very
self-sufficient in agriculture,

00:43:17.110 --> 00:43:18.410
and they're getting better.

00:43:18.410 --> 00:43:21.340
But we need more and
more countries to use

00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:25.140
that arable land that's
not being used.

00:43:25.140 --> 00:43:30.490
Also, the world population
is expected to rise

00:43:30.490 --> 00:43:36.550 position:56%
from 7 billion to 9 billion by 2050.

00:43:36.550 --> 00:43:40.470
And Africa's unused arable
land is going to be vital

00:43:40.470 --> 00:43:42.940
to feed all of those people.

00:43:44.110 --> 00:43:46.510
Yes, ma'am?

00:43:46.510 --> 00:44:05.040
[ Inaudible Background Question ]

00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:06.840
Right.

00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:13.150
[ Inaudible Background Question ]

00:44:13.150 --> 00:44:16.800
Yeah, well that's an
interesting question.

00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:18.110
The question is, we have --

00:44:18.110 --> 00:44:22.240
still have strong men in Africa
who have not adopted democracy,

00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:24.930
or not even moving
close to democracy.

00:44:24.930 --> 00:44:26.650
Very authoritarian.

00:44:26.650 --> 00:44:31.040
Not nice people, but are we able
to work with these people in order

00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:34.420
to achieve other objectives, like
agriculture and what have you?

00:44:34.420 --> 00:44:40.140
It reminds me, when I was a very
junior person in Congo, you know,

00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:42.720
that's that big country
right in the middle.

00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:47.060
It's now the biggest country in
Africa since Sudan was split up.

00:44:47.060 --> 00:44:53.440
And I was there and they had a
strongman president named Mobutu.

00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:56.880
I write a whole chapter
about him in the book.

00:44:56.880 --> 00:45:02.540
And I was -- I ran into the French
Ambassador who was very senior.

00:45:02.540 --> 00:45:06.520 position:56%
He came from a distinguished family,
Casiasko Morrissey [phonetic].

00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:09.410
His granddaughter's now
running for president in France.

00:45:09.410 --> 00:45:12.720
So I said to him, Mr. Ambassador,
how can we work with this guy?

00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:16.020
He's so corrupt and
he doesn't do anything

00:45:16.020 --> 00:45:18.120
for the people, and what have you.

00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:20.220 position:56%
He said, "Let me tell you young man,

00:45:20.220 --> 00:45:24.400
in our business we
work with what exists."

00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:26.360
So we're working with what exists.

00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:29.060
With the President
of Chad and all that.

00:45:29.060 --> 00:45:31.120
And our highest priority
is security, right?

00:45:31.120 --> 00:45:33.790
Where our highest priority
is anti-terrorism.

00:45:33.790 --> 00:45:38.670
And the fact that some
tribes get left out.

00:45:38.670 --> 00:45:40.810
They don't get any
money or any resources.

00:45:40.810 --> 00:45:43.970
We've got to say, well, we'll
take care of that later;

00:45:43.970 --> 00:45:45.830
we'll work on that later you see.

00:45:45.830 --> 00:45:47.130
And their priorities.

00:45:47.130 --> 00:45:49.740
But my view is, you
work with everybody.

00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:53.850
I do not believe in
boycotting people.

00:45:53.850 --> 00:45:56.300
I would have an ambassador
in Tehran.

00:45:56.300 --> 00:45:59.480
I would have ambassadors
all over the place.

00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:02.230
I was very sorry we didn't
have an embassy in Libya

00:46:02.230 --> 00:46:04.060
for so many years you see.

00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:07.080 position:56%
You've got to work with what exists.

00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:08.690
Any other comments?

00:46:08.690 --> 00:46:12.230
I've exhausted you all.

00:46:12.230 --> 00:46:13.920
Yeah? Excuse me.

00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:15.720
Oh I'm sorry, I didn't
see you there.

00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:40.040
[ Inaudible Background Question ]

00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:45.590
&gt;&gt; Yeah, the question is, as
Africa is trying to get unified,

00:46:45.590 --> 00:46:48.880
is there a strategy to work
sort of on the entire continent,

00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:52.210
rather than region-by-region
or a country-by-country?

00:46:52.210 --> 00:46:54.380
I think there is.

00:46:54.380 --> 00:46:58.370
One thing I didn't mention
on the economic side.

00:46:58.370 --> 00:47:04.300
The Africans can make so much money
if they traded with each other.

00:47:04.300 --> 00:47:06.090
You know, you have a
billion people in Africa.

00:47:06.090 --> 00:47:07.980
Tremendous market.

00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:12.930
But yet only 10% of their
trade is with each other.

00:47:12.930 --> 00:47:17.040
You know, if they built factories,
they would have tremendous markets

00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:19.980
that could defeat China or anyone
else because it's right there.

00:47:19.980 --> 00:47:21.710
Right next door to them.

00:47:21.710 --> 00:47:26.700
And they've had a problem
with internal trade in Africa.

00:47:26.700 --> 00:47:29.170
It's hard to cross the border.

00:47:29.170 --> 00:47:31.300
Because somebody's always
looking to make money

00:47:31.300 --> 00:47:33.420
from stuff crossing the border.

00:47:33.420 --> 00:47:36.270
There are a number
of African regions

00:47:36.270 --> 00:47:39.340
which theoretically
have open borders.

00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:42.460
For example, all of the
French speaking countries.

00:47:42.460 --> 00:47:46.810
The former French colonies,
they have the same currency.

00:47:46.810 --> 00:47:48.110
So it should be easy.

00:47:48.110 --> 00:47:51.220
You can sell next door and
don't have to change your money.

00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:54.550
But it's very hard -- and
they have no terrorists.

00:47:54.550 --> 00:47:56.710
But it's very hard,
apparently, to cross the border.

00:47:56.710 --> 00:47:59.930
There's always somebody at
the border trying to do things

00:47:59.930 --> 00:48:03.630
to make it harder for you to
sell in the neighboring country.

00:48:03.630 --> 00:48:08.830
So we're encouraging the Africans
to have regional integration.

00:48:08.830 --> 00:48:13.560
Open the borders, just -- and
then, if you have a market --

00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:16.280
a potential market
of 50 million people,

00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:18.500
it's worthwhile to build a factory.

00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:22.760
But if it's only 10 million
people in a small country,

00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:24.060
it's not worth it you see.

00:48:24.060 --> 00:48:26.310
So, you make a very good point.

00:48:26.310 --> 00:48:29.530
We need to get the Africans
to work more and more together

00:48:29.530 --> 00:48:32.480
and make money from
each other, you see.

00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:34.500
And they're not doing that now.

00:48:34.500 --> 00:48:36.300
Yes, ma'am?

00:48:36.300 --> 00:49:07.130
[ Inaudible Background Question ]

00:49:07.130 --> 00:49:09.950
Oh the question is about
Cameroon, which is --

00:49:09.950 --> 00:49:12.190
you can see that towards the west.

00:49:12.190 --> 00:49:14.490
Just bordering with Nigeria.

00:49:14.490 --> 00:49:16.830
It's in blue on this map.

00:49:16.830 --> 00:49:20.900
It's fairly -- what we call the
"armpit" [laughs] of Africa.

00:49:20.900 --> 00:49:26.690
And it's always been a
very enterprising country.

00:49:26.690 --> 00:49:28.850
They do a lot of agricultural
exports.

00:49:28.850 --> 00:49:31.240
Cocoa. Coffee.

00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:34.340
And they have oil -- they have oil.

00:49:34.340 --> 00:49:38.440
And they have some ethnic
groups there like the Bamileke,

00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:40.020
who are very enterprising.

00:49:40.020 --> 00:49:43.540
They set up banks in
neighboring countries.

00:49:43.540 --> 00:49:46.330
They do transportation.

00:49:46.330 --> 00:49:48.660
So it's a very good country.

00:49:48.660 --> 00:49:54.910
Now their big problem in
Cameroon is minority rule.

00:49:54.910 --> 00:49:59.360
In fact, it's a problem that
covers a lot of countries.

00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:02.850
Let's say the army is
controlled mainly by --

00:50:02.850 --> 00:50:06.680 position:56%
not controlled, but attracts certain
people from certain ethnic groups

00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:09.330 position:56%
because they like being in the army.

00:50:09.330 --> 00:50:13.870
Cameroon, there's an ethnic
group that controls power,

00:50:13.870 --> 00:50:18.070
and it's controlled power for many
years that really represents only

00:50:18.070 --> 00:50:21.220
about 12% of the population.

00:50:21.220 --> 00:50:25.610
So a lot of people feel that
government is not for them.

00:50:25.610 --> 00:50:28.750
That they're monopolizing
resources you see.

00:50:28.750 --> 00:50:32.070
And so this -- it's kind
of a sour mood there.

00:50:32.070 --> 00:50:35.700
Except for some of the enterprising
tribes, like the Bamileke

00:50:35.700 --> 00:50:37.310
who don't give a damn
who's in power.

00:50:37.310 --> 00:50:39.520
They're out there making
money you see.

00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:44.580
But it's ethnically divided among
-- between Muslims and Christians.

00:50:44.580 --> 00:50:46.740
They get along very well.

00:50:46.740 --> 00:50:50.070
So it could be a great country.

00:50:50.070 --> 00:50:51.370
It could be a great country.

00:50:51.370 --> 00:50:54.320
But this minority rule, and
monopolizing of resources

00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:57.580
by a small group, this
is holding them back.

00:50:57.580 --> 00:51:00.630
Really holding them back.

00:51:00.630 --> 00:51:02.930
Anyone else?

00:51:04.630 --> 00:51:06.090
Okay, well thank you very much.

00:51:06.090 --> 00:51:07.390
