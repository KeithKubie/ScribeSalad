00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.980
Sometimes basic arithmetic isn't enough to solve a problem and you need to use

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.850
one of the many math functions that Java has to offer. In fact, there's so many

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.230
that you couldn't possibly remember them all, and we prepared a fact sheet for

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:17.208
you. Let me just go over the most important one. Let's say you need to compute

00:00:17.208 --> 00:00:23.130
a power such as 2 to the 10th. You can't write that exponent neatly in Java,

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.932
instead you use a function and the syntax looks like this. The function name is

00:00:28.932 --> 00:00:35.090
pow, it's in a class called Math. You have to reference it as Math.pow. Then,

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.508
you give it to the two operands, the 2 goes here, and the 10 becomes the second

00:00:40.508 --> 00:00:46.030
one. If you need to compute the square root, you use the square root function.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.190
Again, it's in the Math class, Math.sqrt, and whatever it goes inside the root

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.098
symbol in Math notation goes inside the parentheses here. For absolute values,

00:00:56.098 --> 00:01:00.560
there is another function. It's called abs and whatever you put between the

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.967
vertical bars in Math notation goes on inside here. Now, these kinds of

00:01:04.967 --> 00:01:09.810
functions come up often enough that I want you to practice this a little bit.

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.870
Here, I have a bunch of function calls, and I'd just like you to tell me for

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.845
each of them, what is the result? If you like, you can compute it in BlueJ, or

00:01:16.845 --> 00:01:18.509
you can just do it in your head.
