00:00:03.769 --> 00:00:06.489
I think games, as a medium,
are powerful.

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.680
And it's even stronger when you try 
to make a game about reality;

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.790
about real life events.

00:00:13.018 --> 00:00:17.018
And that's definitely what we tried
to make with Bury me, my Love.

00:00:20.645 --> 00:00:24.645
I've been a journalist for 10 years 
and I've been a video games player

00:00:24.645 --> 00:00:27.635
for my entire life.
And one day, I thought:

00:00:27.646 --> 00:00:31.646
what happens if I try 
to make video games about real life?

00:00:31.646 --> 00:00:36.226
And that's kind of how I got into 
making video games, just with this idea.

00:00:37.988 --> 00:00:41.368
When I first read this article 
on the French newspaper Le Monde,

00:00:41.368 --> 00:00:44.108
it was by Lucie Soullier,
a French journalist,

00:00:44.108 --> 00:00:47.838
and it was about a young Syrian migrant
named Dana,

00:00:47.838 --> 00:00:52.438
and how Dana was able to stay in touch 
with her family thanks to her smart phone.

00:00:54.128 --> 00:00:57.248
Nowadays, most migrants 
have a smart phone,

00:00:57.248 --> 00:00:59.778
for them it's not a luxury.
They use it to stay in touch

00:00:59.778 --> 00:01:02.568
with their friends and family,
exactly the way

00:01:02.568 --> 00:01:05.098
I would talk to my friends or my Mother.

00:01:05.098 --> 00:01:07.548
This was super powerful, 
and I definitely thought

00:01:07.548 --> 00:01:10.738
it would be a strong basis 
for a reality inspired game.

00:01:13.587 --> 00:01:15.897
So I got in touch with Lucie,
and thanks to Lucie,

00:01:15.897 --> 00:01:18.517
we got in touch with Dana,
and they both helped us

00:01:18.517 --> 00:01:22.517
make the most believable 
and realistic game possible.

00:01:22.517 --> 00:01:24.927
Are you able to see inside 
the boat or was there

00:01:24.927 --> 00:01:26.837
just too many people in the boat?

00:01:26.837 --> 00:01:30.837
There was too many people on the boat,
but the smugglers organized us,

00:01:30.837 --> 00:01:34.837
we can't stand.
I just saw the people, the sky,

00:01:34.837 --> 00:01:38.577
and how far we are going from Turkey.

00:01:38.577 --> 00:01:41.477
This must have been so terrifying.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.410
Once they were on board, 
I knew that we would have

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:49.140
the good input, in order to be right in
the way we were going to tell this story.

00:01:50.933 --> 00:01:54.103
Bury me, my Love's story
is about Nour and Majd.

00:01:54.103 --> 00:01:57.223
They are split apart because Nour
wants to leave Syria

00:01:57.223 --> 00:02:00.563
and reach Europe and safety,
but Majd cannot come with her.

00:02:00.563 --> 00:02:03.643
The only way they have to stay in touch
is their cell phones,

00:02:03.643 --> 00:02:08.093
and you are going to play as Majd,
and try to advise and support Nour

00:02:08.093 --> 00:02:12.093
as best you can in order for her 
to reach her destination safely.

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:19.359
Dana has been useful, and her story 
has been incredibly inspiring,

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:22.299
but we wanted to tell 
thousands of stories,

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:25.099
thousands of destinies of 
thousands of different people

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:28.699
who go in different directions
and end up in different places.

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:32.569
Going to the refugee center was also
very strong for me

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.609
to understand what it's like
to be in this situation.

00:02:36.862 --> 00:02:40.862
Obviously, winning the Google Play 
Indie Games Contest was huge.

00:02:40.862 --> 00:02:43.882
And I was so happy for all the team 
and for everybody

00:02:43.882 --> 00:02:46.102
who was involved in the game.

00:02:48.732 --> 00:02:52.292
Most of all, I was happy because 
it sends a message:

00:02:52.292 --> 00:02:56.292
if you do a game about the real world
and very sensitive topics,

00:02:56.292 --> 00:02:59.927
there's a committee of 
seasoned professionals that say

00:02:59.927 --> 00:03:05.057
"Okay, this is interesting, this is 
the game that struck us as something new."

00:03:05.686 --> 00:03:12.046
I hope lots of other game devs notice that
and try to go the same path.

00:03:13.145 --> 00:03:17.145
Did it change the mind about migrants?
That I don't know.

00:03:17.145 --> 00:03:20.775
But I'm not an activist, 
I just want them to be moved

00:03:20.775 --> 00:03:24.215
and to care.
My first aim making the game

00:03:24.215 --> 00:03:28.215
was not to change peoples mind,
it was to tell the story.
