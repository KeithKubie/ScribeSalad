00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Here's the answer. It's pretty straight forward.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
If there's only 1 argument, you return it.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Otherwise, you call the original f that was passed in with the first argument

00:00:09.000 --> 09:59:59.000
as the first argument, and the result of the n-ary composition as the other argument.
