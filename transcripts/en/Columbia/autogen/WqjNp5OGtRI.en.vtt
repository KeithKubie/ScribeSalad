the responsibility to fulfill the duties
 

00:13:00.250 --> 00:16:15.950
the responsibility to fulfill the duties
in

00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:15.960
 

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:20.400
it would be very very important and more

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:20.410
it would be very very important and more
 

00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:22.470
it would be very very important and more
and more people came from farther and

00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:22.480
and more people came from farther and
 

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:25.680
and more people came from farther and
farther than farther away you know so we

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:25.690
farther than farther away you know so we
 

00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:35.470
farther than farther away you know so we
have Australians Japanese South Koreans

00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:35.480
 

00:16:35.480 --> 00:17:25.579
exactly

00:17:25.579 --> 00:17:25.589
 

00:17:25.589 --> 00:19:08.500
why is it too

00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:08.510
 

00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:22.920
as well as

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:22.930
 

00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:28.400
so we kind of distilled some of these

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:28.410
so we kind of distilled some of these
 

00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:36.600
so we kind of distilled some of these

we get

01:08:29.629 --> 01:08:29.639
 

01:08:29.639 --> 01:08:39.249
do this and then go up and write a story

01:08:39.249 --> 01:08:39.259
 

01:08:39.259 --> 01:08:45.800
and that's the conversation quick

01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:45.810
and that's the conversation quick
 

01:08:45.810 --> 01:08:46.640
and that's the conversation quick

health policy in this country so there's
 

01:09:05.850 --> 01:09:10.519
health policy in this country so there's
many ways to you know open up these

many ways to you know open up these
 

01:09:10.529 --> 01:10:00.360
many ways to you know open up these
questions

01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:00.370
 

01:10:00.370 --> 01:10:06.100
and and so that's part of what one has

minutes all I need so so but you're
 

01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:33.879
minutes all I need so so but you're
asking the deeper question

01:10:33.879 --> 01:10:33.889
 

01:10:33.889 --> 01:10:47.390
it's only the

where those boundaries are and that's

01:11:22.100 --> 01:11:22.110
where those boundaries are and that's
 

01:11:22.110 --> 01:11:28.479
where those boundaries are and that's
not to be violent does that mean I mean

we have to think about in these areas
that areas of very very tender so and

01:12:48.319 --> 01:12:48.329
 

01:12:48.329 --> 01:12:51.899
so that constitutes the shame and that's

01:12:51.899 --> 01:12:51.909
so that constitutes the shame and that's
 

01:12:51.909 --> 01:12:58.530
so that constitutes the shame and that's
why in this do you know who work by

01:15:01.819 --> 01:15:41.410
yes

01:15:41.410 --> 01:15:41.420
 

01:15:41.420 --> 01:15:58.590
from its it's highly

01:15:58.590 --> 01:15:58.600
 

01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:10.400
it is a reduction to have a chosen other

01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:25.810
 

01:18:25.810 --> 01:18:45.670
so I have learned how much 23 feeling

01:18:45.670 --> 01:18:45.680
so I have learned how much 23 feeling
 

01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:48.730

that encounter I can't see it
and so I occasionally witness who I have

01:20:20.459 --> 01:20:20.469
 

01:20:20.469 --> 01:20:26.159
I've changed by virtue but I'm going to

well then it becomes just another angle

01:20:45.170 --> 01:20:45.180
 

01:20:45.180 --> 01:20:48.050
so that's different but still it's more

01:20:48.050 --> 01:20:48.060
so that's different but still it's more
 

01:20:48.060 --> 01:20:51.230
so that's different but still it's more
