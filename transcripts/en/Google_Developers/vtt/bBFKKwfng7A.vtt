[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:12.800
GUS CLASS: Hello, and
welcome to the

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.250
Google+ Developers Live.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:16.890
My name is Gus Class.

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.960
I'm a developer advocate
on Google+.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.890
And with me here today
is Cartland.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:21.160
CHRIS CARTLAND: Hi.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.530
My name is Chris Cartland,
and I'm a

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.040
developer programs engineer.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.380
GUS CLASS: And also joining us
by a Hangout is a special

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.366
guest, Evan from TuneIn.

00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:33.370
EVAN OWSKI: I'm Evan Owski.

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.320
I am a software engineer
for TuneIn.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.620
GUS CLASS: So today, we're very
excited to talk about

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:40.670
Over-The-Air Installs.

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.940
And this is a really exciting
feature because, for users, it

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.540
lets you install with one click
right after you sign up

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:49.230
for a website.

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.630
And for developers, it
essentially lets you get free

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.580
Android installs, because
users are immediately

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.550
converted after sign-up.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.130
So it's most clearly
demonstrated when

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:02.100
you see it in action.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.420
So Cartland's going to show it
to you today, and we'll talk

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:05.900
about how to implement it.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:06.390
CHRIS CARTLAND: Excellent.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.200
So I'm over here on tunein.com,
and as a user

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.820
who's signed into Google,
I want to sign

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.620
up with this website.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.580
And when I go to Sign Up, you'll
see that they have a

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.660
couple options, and the
top one here is

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.220
Sign in with Google.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.740
I trust Google to handle my
identity, and I want to use

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.950
this website, so I am going to
choose Sign in with Google.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.040
I get the normal dialogue
that we talked about

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.070
on last week's GDL.

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.310
And the important thing is that
when I click Accept, I'm

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.000
going to be signed into the app,
but I'm also going to be

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.450
prompted to see a dialogue that
says "would you also like

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.870
to install the Android app on
your phone?" And this is

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:51.120
really cool because I didn't
even know there was an app,

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.950
and I can already install
it with just one click.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.270
So I'm done.

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.200
As a user, this is great, as Gus
said, because I can get an

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.130
app without searching
through a phone.

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.780
I don't have to find it
in the Play Store.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.290
It's already on my
device right now.

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.880
I can see the icon, and I can
start using TuneIn in both

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.260
platforms without any effort.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.460
GUS CLASS: So again, you just
signed up for the website, and

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.980
then at the conclusion of sign
up, you're asked which device

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.980
you'd like to push that app
to, and then, boom.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.010
It's right there.

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.860
CHRIS CARTLAND: That's it.

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.110
It's really easy.

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.230
Now Evan, did you have a similar
experience when you

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.670
first saw that we had
Over-The-Air Installs?

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.380
Did you think that
was a cool idea?

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.090
EVAN OWSKI: Yeah, I think OTA
Install was probably the

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.500
easiest feature to
get to work.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.620
Pretty much we dropped a data
attribute on our Sign-in

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.465
button, and it just worked.

00:02:49.465 --> 00:02:49.840
CHRIS CARTLAND: Awesome.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.370
EVAN OWSKI: Spent about a minute
implementing it and 30

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.070
minutes testing it, so--

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.950
CHRIS CARTLAND: Awesome.

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:55.380
EVAN OWSKI: Fantastic.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:56.280
CHRIS CARTLAND: That's
really cool.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.620
Speaking of the implementation,
I can show

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:59.790
through all those
steps right now.

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.620
It's going to be really fast,
and we're going to see how

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.740
easy it is to get Over-The-Air
Installs to work.

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.710
GUS CLASS: Now, Chris, you
did that so fast earlier.

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:08.820
I bet our viewers didn't
even get to see the app

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.240
on the Nexus 10.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.140
So can we show that one more
time, just to show people

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.120
where that is and maybe
kind of walk that

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.070
through a little slower?

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:16.000
CHRIS CARTLAND: Oh, sure.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
So on our Nexus 10 right here,
the icon has already appeared

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.630
on the desktop.

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.510
So this is literally the first
time I've touched the device

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.600
after I clicked Sign
in on the Web.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.870
And the TuneIn app is
already available.

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.100
I can start looking at the
different radio stations and

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.640
do everything else that
I would with the app.

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.450
And again, I skipped all of
the steps that were in the

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.200
Play Store, and everything
that I

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.220
wanted was already here.

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.420
GUS CLASS: It happened so fast
and transparently that it's

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:51.220
really difficult just to see it
happen because you sign up,

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.770
you click Install with the
device you've selected, and

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:55.820
then it's on that device.

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.090
CHRIS CARTLAND: Excellent.

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.660
So again, similarly, we're going
to show how fast it is

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.640
to get this to actually work.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:06.760
So on my computer I'm looking at
the APIs Console, which is

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.930
where you do all of your regular
configuration for

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:10.630
Google APIs.

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.420
What you're going to do is make
sure that you create a

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:18.620
client ID for Android using the
same project that your web

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.600
application is using.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.110
So we just choose Installed
Application and

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:25.170
fill out two fields.

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:28.260
One of them is your Android's
app package name, which just

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.455
identifies, of course, what your
application is-- the one

00:04:31.455 --> 00:04:32.740
that we want to install.

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.890
And then the second thing you
need to fill out is the SHA1,

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:40.100
which all you Android developers
know, you can use

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.010
the keystore to come
up with the SHA1.

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.250
And then you say, Create
client ID.

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:53.360
And then your configuration
is done on the web.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.950
GUS CLASS: So again, so this
configuration here-- the

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:56.480
screen that you're showing--

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.780
these are the settings
that are pulled from

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.510
Android for your app.

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:02.340
And then the next thing you're
going to show is going to be--

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.070
CHRIS CARTLAND: How to actually
make the button do

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:05.310
the Over-The-Air Install.

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.470
GUS CLASS: OK.

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:06.250
Awesome.

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:06.690
CHRIS CARTLAND: Great.

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:09.250
So once your Android device is
set up like we've just shown

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.860
on the web, all we have to add
is one field, and that's the

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:12.910
app package name.

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:16.010
So if you're using the Sign-in
button markup, there's this

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:19.970
field called
data-apppackagename, and it

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:23.010
says, com.google.andro
id.gms.sample.plus, or

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:25.580
whatever TuneIn's
app would be.

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:26.960
And that's it.

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.390
Once you put that
on your page--

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:30.020
as Evan said, that took
about a minute.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.370
What else would you like to
add about that, Evan?

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:34.980
GUS CLASS: Yeah, great.

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:36.700
Actually, let's hear a little
bit more about TuneIn's

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:39.170
integration with Google+.

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.930
EVAN OWSKI: Sure.

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:41.790
First, let me introduce
the company.

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:45.160
So TuneIn is the
world's radio.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.090
We have 40 million monthly,
active listeners.

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:50.640
You can listen to 70,000 live
stations from all over the

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:55.400
world, and two million pieces
of on-demand content.

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.740
So you should definitely check
us out at tunein.com, and

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:01.880
while you're at it, hit Sign
in with Google and grab our

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.130
Android app.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:11.420
So let me go over some of the
ins and outs of what we did

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:13.080
for our integration.

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:19.570
So I did the web integration,
and my colleague, Cliff did

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:21.020
the Android.

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.210
So I'll focus on web.

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:26.360
It was about, I would say, a
two, two and a half week

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.150
process to get everything
going.

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:33.030
So we did Sign-in and
Sign-up integration.

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:35.960
We did Share.

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:44.200
We did Moments, so if you're
signed in to your Google

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.720
account, it broadcasts
these moments.

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:52.670
So Evan Owski is listening to
Laid Back Radio right now.

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:56.350
And it's kind of a cool way of
letting your friends know what

00:06:56.350 --> 00:07:00.360
you're up to, listening
to on TuneIn.

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:01.250
GUS CLASS: Cool.

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:03.790
So you guys are taking advantage
of the app activity

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:04.870
functionality.

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:09.570
And so then as someone listens
to radio, it kind of

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:12.740
continuously writes the things
that they're doing.

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:13.490
EVAN OWSKI: Right.

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:13.720
Right.

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.348
So if they tune in to a new
station, if they tune in to a

00:07:16.348 --> 00:07:21.190
new program, if they Favorite
something, that all gets

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:23.670
posted in their Moments
stream.

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:24.510
CHRIS CARTLAND: Awesome.

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:25.888
EVAN OWSKI: And, of course, if
they don't want that they can

00:07:25.888 --> 00:07:26.680
always disable it.

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:26.980
CHRIS CARTLAND: Right.

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:30.920
And one of things that Google+
Sign-in allows you to do is

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:34.240
give the user control over who
can actually see those app

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.290
activities.

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:35.470
EVAN OWSKI: Right.

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:37.080
CHRIS CARTLAND: So they're not
necessarily broadcast to

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:38.020
people that they don't want.

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:41.080
They are only given to
exactly who the user

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:44.300
says should see them.

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:44.925
Cool.

00:07:44.925 --> 00:07:45.330
EVAN OWSKI: Right.

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:46.580
CHRIS CARTLAND: Excellent.

00:07:49.219 --> 00:07:50.710
GUS CLASS: Awesome.

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:54.180
Sorry, we totally
interrupted you.

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:58.950
Were you guys doing some work
also with interactive posts?

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:02.230
Because they also kind of go
hand-in-hand with those sorts

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:04.680
of things, like, I'm listening
to this now.

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:05.750
Come and listen to what
I'm listening to, too.

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:09.340
EVAN OWSKI: Yeah, we did
implement Interactive Post as

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:15.510
well, and that was maybe second
to like OTA Install,

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:19.110
probably the easiest feature
to implement.

00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:22.770
We had some existing metadata
on our station and program

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:30.930
pages, and Google was able to
pull that information down and

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:32.610
interpret it correctly.

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:35.960
We really didn't have to do any
additional work to take

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:38.749
advantage of that metadata, so
that when you click the Share

00:08:38.749 --> 00:08:47.840
button, Share on Google+, you
had all the correct title and

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:52.228
description of the page
and an icon as well.

00:08:52.228 --> 00:08:54.170
GUS CLASS: That's awesome.

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:56.080
So you're able to pre-populate,
set all the

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:58.430
things that you want to appear
in that interactive post, and

00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:01.060
then the users can selectively
render it to their stream.

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:03.330
That's cool.

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:07.260
So what do you think was one
of the most exciting things

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:10.190
that has happened as
a result of Google+

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:11.440
Sign-in for you guys?

00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:18.260
Do you look forward to getting
deeper functionality from this

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:21.340
and additional things you have
that couldn't make it in for

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:23.800
the launch?

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:26.030
EVAN OWSKI: Yeah, there were
a few features that we were

00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:27.360
definitely thinking
about including.

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:30.120
One of the features that we
ended up implementing on web

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:32.750
was the calendar integration,
which is awesome because

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:37.070
TuneIn has a ton of live
content, and we have schedules

00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:40.500
for a lot of our stations.

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:46.140
And so if you want to listen
to say "Morning Edition" or

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:48.380
even a sporting event-- we've
got March Madness coming up--

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:52.760
and you want to set a reminder
to yourself to listen to it,

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:56.440
you can just add that to your
calendar right from our

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:57.460
Android app.

00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:00.060
And that's something we
don't yet have on web.

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:01.560
GUS CLASS: That's cool.

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:04.300
EVAN OWSKI: But yeah, we're very
excited about Sign-on,

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:09.390
because almost everyone who
comes to our site, a lot of

00:10:09.390 --> 00:10:12.550
our users, are going to be
signed in already with Google,

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:16.270
and we like to get them to sign
up so that they can get

00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:20.100
some of our better features
like Favorites.

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:24.110
And it just removes
that extra step of

00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:25.640
having to type in email.

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:28.840
And I know when I go to a new
site, I'm pretty lazy, and I

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:32.200
don't like to have to type in a
lot of stuff to sign up for

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:34.820
an account, so it just makes
it that much easier.

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:37.020
GUS CLASS: Yep, and
additionally, like on mobile,

00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:39.200
there's nothing worse than
trying to enter your password

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.405
with those little keys, right?

00:10:40.405 --> 00:10:41.620
EVAN OWSKI: Oh yeah.

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:42.720
Totally.

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:45.030
CHRIS CARTLAND: Yeah, so what
did you think about Google as

00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:48.410
a position to help
your integration?

00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:51.370
Do you think anything we had was
particularly special that

00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:54.780
made it great for your
application?

00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:58.160
EVAN OWSKI: So we were part of
the launch, and so we worked

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:01.600
pretty closely with
the Google+ team,

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:03.160
and they were great--

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:04.950
very responsive to
our questions.

00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:11.610
I think at the beginning there
was a little bit of a scarcity

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:14.230
of-- some of the documentation
was a bit scattered.

00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:17.080
But we saw, sort of as the
process went along, the

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:19.450
documentation got a lot better,
got more filled in.

00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:22.480
And so I think some of the
difficulties that we might

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:27.990
have had early on when other
companies come in, when other

00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:30.290
projects come in and they do
this kind of integration, I

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:32.880
think it's going to be a
lot smoother for them.

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:35.290
And they'll be able to just
jump right in, use the

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:35.555
documentation.

00:11:35.555 --> 00:11:37.430
It will be pretty much
out of the box.

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:39.060
GUS CLASS: Yeah, awesome.

00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:45.580
And do you have any advice for
third-party developers who are

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:48.040
kind of like you guys, who had
to get-- you know, you got

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:52.000
early access to it and a little
bit more handholding--

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.170
any kind of tricks or
recommendations, ways that

00:11:56.170 --> 00:11:57.550
guys that are kind of starting
out with this

00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:01.350
can save some time?

00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:05.080
EVAN OWSKI: Yeah, I would
say definitely

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:06.660
grab the sample app.

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:09.320
The sample app was really
helpful, and a lot of the

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:14.260
examples you can just drop
pretty much copy, paste

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:18.120
verbatim, and they just work.

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:20.095
GUS CLASS: So did you guys start
with the quick-start, or

00:12:20.095 --> 00:12:23.040
did you start with
a PhotoHunt?

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:25.420
EVAN OWSKI: What was
the second one?

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:27.930
GUS CLASS: There's PhotoHunt,
which is sort of a showcase

00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:33.390
app that shows an actual full
integration like with the

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:36.370
Over-The-Air Installs and it's
got an Android and iOS app and

00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:37.870
also a web server.

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:38.866
If you guys didn't
start with--

00:12:38.866 --> 00:12:40.380
EVAN OWSKI: Oh, I don't think we
even knew about PhotoHunt.

00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:41.100
GUS CLASS: Oh, awesome.

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:42.670
That is the new, new then.

00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:45.800
So you found the quick-start
samples to be real helpful,

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:48.120
and they're available for all
the languages that most

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:51.810
developers use, which
is handy.

00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:53.060
Cool.

00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:56.260
Trying to think what else.

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:57.510
CHRIS CARTLAND: Do you have
any questions from people

00:12:57.510 --> 00:12:59.120
online that we can get to?

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:00.400
GUS CLASS: Sure.

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:03.030
The first question that we're
seeing is, some people have

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:05.720
expressed concerns that
Over-The-Air Installs are

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:07.740
hardware dependent.

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:10.890
And Cartland, do you want
to take this one?

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:12.640
CHRIS CARTLAND: Yeah, so the
Over-The-Air Installs will

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:16.460
work on any phone
with Android--

00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:17.270
what's the number--

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:18.670
2.3 or higher.

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:20.110
It's Gingerbread.

00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:24.730
So as long as you have that and
you have the Google Play

00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:26.470
Store installed, then
it'll work,

00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:29.080
which is a lot of devices.

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:31.270
GUS CLASS: Yeah, so there's a
whole lot of Android devices

00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:34.260
out there, and yeah, the
hardware dependence is just

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.060
kind of-- there's a minimum
version of Android.

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:38.700
So long as your device supports
that minimum version,

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:42.090
then you are good to go for
these Over-The-Air Installs.

00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:44.450
Another question is, does anyone
know if the Auth Token

00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:47.560
from the Sign-in service can
be used for any other OAuth

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:51.130
2.0 methods Google services,
for instance spreadsheets?

00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:54.680
And actually Evan can speak
to this, because they did

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:59.190
calendar integration in addition
to Google+ Sign-in

00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:00.590
integration.

00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:03.030
Do you want to talk a little
bit about kind of the extra

00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:06.230
leg work that you guys had
to do to enable that

00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:08.620
functionality?

00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:11.860
EVAN OWSKI: So I can't speak
to calendar integration too

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:16.140
much, because we didn't do that
on web, and Cliff would

00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:18.345
be a better person to answer
that question for mobile since

00:14:18.345 --> 00:14:20.130
he did that side of it.

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:21.070
GUS CLASS: Yeah, sure.

00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:22.410
I can actually jump in here
and talk to this.

00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:25.250
So there's only two things
that you have to do.

00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:29.250
You need to turn on the services
for the additional

00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:30.730
functionality that you need.

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:32.490
And then the next thing you need
to do is just request the

00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:33.530
right scopes.

00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:36.730
When the user clicks the Sign-in
button, they'll be

00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:39.320
shown all the scopes that you're
requesting, and they

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:43.780
can control which of them they
will allow access to.

00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:49.650
So another question is--

00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:51.500
no more questions.

00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:53.900
So we actually don't have
anything new to

00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:55.150
announce this week.

00:14:58.650 --> 00:15:02.950
But we do want to say that it's
really exciting to be

00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:05.870
back on to Google Developers
Live, and we look forward a

00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:08.430
lot to additional shows talking

00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:11.390
about the Google+ platform.

00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:13.160
CHRIS CARTLAND: And thank you so
much to TuneIn and Evan for

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:14.200
joining us today.

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:15.880
We had a really great time
talking with you.

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:18.250
EVAN OWSKI: Yeah, it's
great to be here.

00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:18.320
CHRIS CARTLAND: Yep.

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:19.570
Well, thanks for watching.

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:37.230
