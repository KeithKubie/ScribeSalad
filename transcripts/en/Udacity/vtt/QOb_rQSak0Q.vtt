00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.060
In general, people find they're most similar to their

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.600
immediate family because they're most related to them. More distant

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.180
family members still show similarities, but fewer similarities than

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:15.280
the closely related family. For example, you might compare yourself

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.350
to one of your parents, say your mother, and

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:18.930
you might be looking at traits that you share in

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.970
common. And then we can look at your mother's parents,

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.110
one her parents. Let's say her father, your grand daddy,

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.820
and we could essentially compare the same traits among

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.380
all of us. And we could keep going back in

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.190
time looking at the parents of the grandparents and the

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.305
parents of the great grandparents, and the parents of the

00:00:36.305 --> 00:00:38.980
great-great grandparents. And we could just keep gong back in

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.780
this very linear fashion. In general, you're probably going to find

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.090
that you're most similar to your parent and then your

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.050
grandparent, and then your great grandparent as a general rule.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.300
But looking at families in this very linear

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.690
fashion isn't really all that accurate, and it's really

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.480
difficult to make comparisons to all the other family

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.030
members that you're related to. Your family actually resembles

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.080
much more of a shrub-like structure, with branches

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.540
coming off to the sides, up and to the

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.350
right, all around, going back in time in many

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.585
different directions. We can represent half siblings, aunts, uncles,

00:01:14.585 --> 00:01:17.800
granddads, uncles, cousins and so on. Let's actually

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.640
try to look at this starting with your

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.240
most immediate biological family members. Your parents, father

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.790
and mother, and your siblings, sister or brother.

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.450
Now you share 100% similarity with yourself. Congratulations,

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.600
you are you. And with all of these

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.920
other immediate family members: father, mother, sister, brother,

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.096
your sharing about 50% similarity. This tier of relatedness

00:01:40.096 --> 00:01:42.340
is the closest tier of relatedness to you

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.178
with regards to your family members, those people

00:01:45.178 --> 00:01:48.930
with whom you're genetically related. Now let's add

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.760
the first tier of complexity here. Your mother and

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.640
father may have siblings, these would be considered

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.640
your aunts and uncles. Your aunts and uncles, and

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.760
your parents all share parents themselves, your grandparents.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.700
This tier of relatedness is roughly 25% to you,

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.639
this tier also includes relatives like half siblings.

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:12.830
A half sibling is someone who shares one biological

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.290
parent with you. Now you notice that when

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.710
we added one tier of complexity, we got a

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.820
lot bigger pretty fast. Right. We added a

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.600
bunch of levels both in the same generation as

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.510
you. The generation above you and another generation beyond

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.870
that. Now we can add another tier. And keep

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.510
building your family tree or your family shrub in

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.810
this case. We've added many more great grandparents. Some

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.640
grand aunts and grand uncles, some first cousins here.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.010
And we can keep building, and keep building this tree

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.380
or shrub, or as I like to think of it a family rainbow. And we can start at the

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.760
center here with perfect genetic relatedness and keep moving

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.940
out to the next rung, to the next part of

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.580
the rainbow, and we get less and less related. And as we build, we just

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.780
get bigger and bigger. Our family stretches

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.050
on and on in many directions. We're including

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.030
great great grandparents, second cousins, first cousins

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.910
once removed. This visual really brings to light

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.300
the shrubbiness of our families, and our

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.480
family trees. Now, with a visual like this,

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.480
which of the following inferences is the

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.450
least well described? Would it be family relatedness,

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.250
genetic relatedness, or trait relatedness? Go ahead

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.090
and pick the answer you think best applies.
