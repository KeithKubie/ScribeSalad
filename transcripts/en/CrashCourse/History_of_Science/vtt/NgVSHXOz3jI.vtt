00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.280
There was physics before Einstein… in the
same way that there was biology before Darwin.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.099
Einstein didn’t just add some new ideas
to physics. And he didn’t just add a unifying

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:20.050
framework for doing physics, like Newton.
Einstein took what people thought was physics,

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.840
turned it upside down, then turned it inside
out.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.160
In the same way Darwin’s work made people
see life itself differently, Einstein’s

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.620
work made humanity reexamine time and space.

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:40.340
[Intro Music Plays]

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.000
The classical worldview—associated with
names you know, like Euclid, Aristotle, and

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.790
Newton—held that the rules governing space
and time were absolute. One meter was always

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.330
one meter long; one hour would always be one
hour long…

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.830
Matter was made up of immutable and indivisible
atoms.

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:01.870
And energy moved through a medium called ether—because
everything had to move through something,

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.960
right? God wouldn’t just make, I dunno,
a howling void?

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.390
And with new disciplines like thermodynamics
and fun applications like steam power and

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.799
light bulbs, human understanding of the fundamental
forces of nature seemed pretty solid.

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:19.040
To quote historian of science Milena Wazeck, by 1900, “physics

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.259
was perceived by many to be an almost completed
discipline.”

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:27.740
But within this almost-completeness lurked
many unanswered questions. One of the biggest

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.400
was the failure of the Michelson–Morley
experiment in 1887. They’d attempted to

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.049
demonstrate that the speed of light changed
just a little when measured from the earth,

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.509
which is always moving, relative to the ether,
which never moves.

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:46.700
But despite meticulous efforts, they couldn’t
find any slowing-down. Light moved at a constant

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.469
speed—almost as if there was no ether.
Then there was the electron and radioactivity.

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:57.969
In 1897, English physicist J. J. Thomson showed
that cathode rays were made up of discrete

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:03.810
particles, way smaller than whole atoms—electrons.
And around the same time, Marie Curie proposed

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.560
the theory of radioactivity, which classical
physics didn’t predict.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.530
Then, in the early 1900s, Ernest Rutherford
experimented on radioactive decay. He named

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.380
radioactive alpha, beta, and gamma particles,
classifying them by their ability to penetrate

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.900
different kinds of matter.
And Henri Becquerel measured

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.820
beta particles and realized they were actually
electrons exiting the nuclei of atoms at high

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.670
speeds.
So by the early 1900s, radioactive decay was

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:34.580
understood, and the crisis of the immutable
atom was as deep as the crisis of the ether.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.690
A bunch of folks were investigating Maxwell’s
equations and looking at black-body radiation,

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.970
or the heat emitted by dark objects when they
absorb light.

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.650
Then Heinrich Hertz, the original radio wave
guy, discovered the photoelectric effect,

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:52.040
or the paradox that certain metals produce
electrical currents when zapped with wavelengths

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.790
of light above a certain threshold.
Things started to get messy. Energy was thought

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.890
to be a continuous wave. But according to
wave-based theory, there might be infinite

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:07.440
energy radiated back by black bodies zapped
with certain wavelengths. This seemingly violated

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:14.230
the newly established laws of thermodynamics. Like, infinite energy doesn't seem right.
So, in trying to explain the weird results

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.250
about light and heat, German physicist Max
Planck theorized that light

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:26.140
may not be a wave after all, but a series
of particles or quantum units. All very non-“classical.”

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.530
Sorry, Aristotle!

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.230
quantum weirdness!
Enter Albert.

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:39.150
Einstein was born in 1879 and grew up in southern
Germany, Italy, and Switzerland. He dropped

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.840
out of high school, then studied to teach
physics and math and became a Swiss citizen.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.420
But he couldn’t get a teaching job—because
he was Jewish.

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:51.860
So in 1901 he took a job at the patent office
and started a Ph.D. at the University of Zurich,

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.790
which he finished in 1905. You’re going
to want to remember that year…. 1905.

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:02.070
Now, Al wasn’t an academic hotshot or self-funded
amateur. He was a working-class nobody who

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:07.600
did physics on the side. But he was also a
patent officer who spent his days pouring

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.390
over technical documents.
He was an outsider obsessed with math because

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:16.989
math is beautiful, and yet he was a deeply
practical person who believed that good math

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.340
and science could be communicated plainly.
Plus, he was young and bold. And he had a

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.240
super smart and supportive first wife, Serbian
mathematician Mileva Marić.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.540
So, the year he finished his Ph.D., 1905,

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:34.240
Al published his dissertation and four papers
that changed physics overnight. This was his

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:39.169
annus mirabilis or miracle year, like 1666 had been for Newton.

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:43.460
Help us out, ThoughtBubble.
At age twenty six, Einstein published revolutionary

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:44.759
work on:

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:49.210
1. Brownian motion, or the random motion of particles
in fluids;

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:55.039
2. the photoelectric effect, supporting the idea
of energy as a series of particles, not a wave;

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:59.659
3. the equivalence of mass and energy; and

00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:00.870
4.special relativity.

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:05.659
Special relativity, especially made Einstein
a scientific rock star. He proved that nothing

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:10.969
can move faster than light. This explained
why Michelson and Morley hadn’t observed

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:16.610
light slowing in ether. And a lot of other things.
Einstein got rid of all reference frames for

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:21.870
space and time. There was no longer some universal
space in which physics happened. All measurements

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.710
became relative to the position and speed
of the observer.

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:31.689
Space and time became one mathematically continuous
spacetime. So an event at one time for observer

00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:35.439
A could take place at a completely different
time for observer B.

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:39.830
And the only constant in the entire system
became the speed of light—which classical

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:43.669
physics predicted could change!
From special relativity followed the equivalence

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:49.129
of mass and energy proof. Which was also mind-blowing.
It’s probably the most memorable physics

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:54.990
formula ever, since it’s printed on mugs
and T-shirts the world over: E = mc2. Or,

00:05:54.990 --> 00:06:00.309
energy equals mass times the speed of light,
squared. Or, mass and energy can be converted

00:06:00.309 --> 00:06:04.139
into each other!
Or, as Einstein said: “…mass and energy

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:09.780
are both but different manifestations of the
same thing—a somewhat unfamiliar conception

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:12.830
for the average mind.”
Now, it’s important to note that Einstein’s

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:18.009
new system of physics is simply a different
system than Netwon’s. “Mass” and “energy”

00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:22.590
mean something different in the two systems—because,
to put it bluntly, Newton’s system turns

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:27.900
out to be not so universal. It only seems
to work on earth, because we aren’t particularly

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:30.590
massive or fast-moving, compared to stars.

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:35.559
Thanks Thought Bubble. We don’t have time
to explain all of the cool science that Einstein

00:06:35.559 --> 00:06:40.639
and his generation of physicists did around
World War One, but two things stand out:

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:45.750
In 1915, Einstein published the theory of
general relativity. Special relativity was

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:50.469
all about comparing physical effects from
different observer positions in terms of velocity,

00:06:50.469 --> 00:06:55.150
or speed in a particular direction.
General relativity provided all of the complicated

00:06:55.150 --> 00:07:00.189
math regarding relativity and acceleration,
or speeding up or down.

00:07:00.189 --> 00:07:05.129
General relativity explains the physics of
all situations. Special relativity is one

00:07:05.129 --> 00:07:10.259
specific case of general relativity.
General relativity nailed the coffin shut

00:07:10.259 --> 00:07:16.180
on the classical, Euclidean worldview: now gravity
itself was shown not to be a force like light,

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:20.529
but an effect, a distortion in the shape of
space due to mass…

00:07:20.529 --> 00:07:25.470
So the planets didn’t follow certain paths
because of the attraction of the sun’s gravity,

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:29.830
but because the space before them was curved
by the sun’s mass.

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:35.280
Einstein’s universe wasn’t a series of
perfect spheres in an ether, but a void whose

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:39.960
very dimensions—whose rules, basically,
other than the speed of light—could change.

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:44.710
Many of his colleagues initially objected
to this, but Einstein was confident—and

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:49.990
patient. Astronomers awaited a solar eclipse
in 1919, that allowed them to experimentally

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:51.960
confirm Einstein’s theory.

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:57.500
The confirmation of gravitational lensing made
Einstein a scientific hero and an icon of

00:07:57.509 --> 00:08:03.069
pop culture. As The Times of London reported,
“Newtonian Ideas Overthrown.”

00:08:03.069 --> 00:08:07.090
The second major act of science Einstein did
around World War One was contribute to the

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:13.039
birth of modern particle physics. This story
is about, in part, Einstein getting it wrong.

00:08:13.039 --> 00:08:16.770
In 1911, Ernest Rutherford and Danish physicist
Niels Bohr [“NEELS BOAR”] theorized a

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:22.800
model of the atom with electrons zipping around
a heavy nucleus. Scientists began to study

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:28.050
the physics of the very small, just as Einstein
was working out the physics of the very large.

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:33.209
But over the 1920s, these particle physicists
saw a lot of weird quantum or particle-like

00:08:33.209 --> 00:08:36.300
effects.
Basically, Bohr’s Copenhagen group showed

00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:41.690
that very small particles tend to act like
particles sometimes but like waves at other

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:47.019
times. Like waves, their behaviors have probabilities.
But when measured, individual particles are,

00:08:47.019 --> 00:08:52.519
well particles. They are or aren’t there.
In 1926, two German physicists worked out

00:08:52.519 --> 00:08:58.190
the math behind these quantum mechanics: Werner
Heisenberg invented matrix mechanics, which

00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:04.660
[large exhale] are complex and Erwin Schrödinger,
wave mechanics. And lots of dead/not-dead

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:08.540
cat jokes.
Because, in 1927, Heisenberg proposed his

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:14.220
uncertainty principle: any observer can detect
the position or velocity of any quantum particle,

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:19.269
at any given time interval, but not both at
the same time.

00:09:19.269 --> 00:09:25.149
Einstein haaated this. He believed in a universe
ordered by an ultimate rationality, and he

00:09:25.149 --> 00:09:30.300
famously quipped, “God doesn’t play dice
with the world.” But Al, who had contributed

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:36.209
in lots of ways to the emerging model of atoms
and particles of energy, was wrong about uncertainty.

00:09:36.209 --> 00:09:41.360
By the 1930s, Einstein was easily the most
famous scientist since Darwin. There was just

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:45.079
one problem. He was still Jewish. And living
in Germany.

00:09:45.079 --> 00:09:50.610
So in 1933, Einstein renounced his German
citizenship and took a professorship at Princeton.

00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:55.769
As a celebrity genius with intimate knowledge
of the cutting-edge of German science—and

00:09:55.769 --> 00:10:01.440
perfect hair—Einstein had the ears of politicians
anxiously planning for another great war in

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:04.090
Europe.
And, after one of his physicist buddies demonstrated

00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:10.060
that an atom could be straight-up, stone-cold
split open, Einstein felt that he had a moral

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:15.880
obligation to explain to the American establishment
just how powerful atomic energy could be…

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:21.370
We’ll pick up this thread next time.
Suffice to say, World War Two eventually ended,

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:25.680
and a new Cold War started—with scientific
discovery, especially in the physics that

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:29.810
Einstein had created, as the new measuring
stick of imperial might.

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:35.210
Israel offered Einstein the presidency, which
he turned down. He lived the rest of his life

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:39.630
in the home of technological innovation and
“fat sandwiches”—New Jersey.

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:44.670
Einstein always regretted that his work was
used for violent ends. In fact, he was generally

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:50.360
skeptical of modernity. Way back during World
War One, he wrote: “Our entire much-praised

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:55.899
technological progress, and civilization generally,
could be compared to an axe in the hand of

00:10:55.899 --> 00:10:59.560
a pathological criminal.”
And yet, in the end, even the horrors of two

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:05.319
world wars never shook his faith that there
was great meaning in the universe—a code

00:11:05.319 --> 00:11:10.310
to be deciphered by science.
He died never quite accepting quantum randomness,

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:13.470
and believing that, one day, humans would
crack the code.

00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:18.240
Next time—the Americans use Einstein’s
world-threatening Bomb, and warfare changes

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:24.020
forever. It’s the birth of nuclear physics,
the end of World War Two, and the beginning

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:24.740
of  the Cold War.

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:27.760
