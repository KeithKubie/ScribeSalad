00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:01.913
- [Instructor] We're told that Figure A

00:00:01.913 --> 00:00:03.921
is a scale image of Figure B,

00:00:03.921 --> 00:00:06.559
so that's Figure A, this is Figure B here.

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:08.568
The scale that maps Figure A

00:00:08.568 --> 00:00:13.142
to Figure B is one to two and 1/2.

00:00:13.142 --> 00:00:15.059
What is the value of X?

00:00:15.917 --> 00:00:17.287
All right, pause this video

00:00:17.287 --> 00:00:20.169
and see if you can figure it out.

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:21.678
All right, so X is the length

00:00:21.678 --> 00:00:25.471
of this side right over here on Figure A,

00:00:25.471 --> 00:00:29.638
and the corresponding side
on Figure B has length five.

00:00:30.591 --> 00:00:34.411
And so, one way to think about
it is the ratio between X

00:00:34.411 --> 00:00:38.115
and five should be one to two and a half

00:00:38.115 --> 00:00:38.959
because that's the scale

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:40.779
that goes from Figure A to Figure B.

00:00:40.779 --> 00:00:42.540
Figure A to Figure B.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.758
So, the ratio, let me write this out.

00:00:44.758 --> 00:00:47.175
The ratio between X and five,

00:00:49.062 --> 00:00:51.229
so the ratio of X to five,

00:00:53.451 --> 00:00:57.711
this should be an equivalent ratio as one,

00:00:57.711 --> 00:00:59.544
one to two and a half.

00:01:01.145 --> 00:01:04.450
One to two and a half, and
that one is hard to read,

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:06.880
let me make it a deeper
blue, there you go.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.760
All right, so let's just
think about how to do this.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.927
To go from from two and a
half to five, to go that way,

00:01:13.926 --> 00:01:15.760
you would multiply be two,

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.637
so to go from one to X, you
would also multiple by two.

00:01:20.637 --> 00:01:23.086
So, the value of X is equal to two.

00:01:23.086 --> 00:01:26.996
If these are scaled up, you
multiple this by two and a half,

00:01:26.996 --> 00:01:28.329
you get to five,

00:01:29.292 --> 00:01:32.275
so the scale factor is
one to two and a half.

00:01:32.275 --> 00:01:34.358
Let's do another example.

00:01:35.732 --> 00:01:39.737
We're told Figure A is a
scale image of Figure B,

00:01:39.737 --> 00:01:41.699
and we see them both right over here,

00:01:41.699 --> 00:01:43.438
and once again, we gotta figure out

00:01:43.438 --> 00:01:44.816
what X is going to be.

00:01:44.816 --> 00:01:46.860
And they don't give us the scale factor,

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.066
but we can figure out the scale factor.

00:01:49.066 --> 00:01:50.154
How do we do that?

00:01:50.154 --> 00:01:52.940
Well, we can see, when you go from,

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.118
this side right over here
corresponds to this side.

00:01:56.118 --> 00:01:59.613
It's the shorter side
that forms a right angle

00:01:59.613 --> 00:02:00.655
with the base,

00:02:00.655 --> 00:02:02.660
this is the longer side
that forms a right angle

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:03.702
with the base,

00:02:03.702 --> 00:02:06.033
and so, you could set up some ratios.

00:02:06.033 --> 00:02:09.036
You can say, look, the
ratio of three to four,

00:02:09.036 --> 00:02:11.536
you can say the ratio of three

00:02:12.574 --> 00:02:13.407
to four,

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.687
we need that blue color,

00:02:16.687 --> 00:02:18.774
the ratio of three to four is going

00:02:18.774 --> 00:02:22.958
to be the same thing as
the ratio of X to 7.2.

00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:24.473
The ratio of X

00:02:24.473 --> 00:02:25.306
to 7.2,

00:02:27.384 --> 00:02:28.960
X

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.443
to

00:02:30.443 --> 00:02:31.276
7.2,

00:02:32.716 --> 00:02:35.490
and so how do we figure
out what X is going to be?

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.358
Well, how do you go from four to 7.2?

00:02:38.358 --> 00:02:40.224
What do you have to multiply by?

00:02:40.224 --> 00:02:41.385
You might wanna get out a calculator

00:02:41.385 --> 00:02:43.248
or you might be able to
do this in your head.

00:02:43.248 --> 00:02:47.738
Four 72 is two times 36,
which is two times 18,

00:02:47.738 --> 00:02:50.536
so four times 18 would be 72

00:02:50.536 --> 00:02:53.119
or four times 1.8 would be 7.2,

00:02:54.237 --> 00:02:56.477
and if you don't feel good
about that mental arithmetic,

00:02:56.477 --> 00:02:58.808
you could just do the division.

00:02:58.808 --> 00:03:00.364
Four goes into seven one time,

00:03:00.364 --> 00:03:01.463
one times four is four,

00:03:01.463 --> 00:03:03.402
subtract, you get a three,

00:03:03.402 --> 00:03:04.711
you're gonna have your
decimal right over there,

00:03:04.711 --> 00:03:06.345
bring down the two, 32,

00:03:06.345 --> 00:03:08.142
four goes into 32 eight times,

00:03:08.142 --> 00:03:10.008
eight times four is 32,

00:03:10.008 --> 00:03:11.375
and we're done.

00:03:11.375 --> 00:03:13.395
So, to go from four to 7.2,

00:03:13.395 --> 00:03:15.670
you have to multiply by 1.8

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.294
and so, to go from three to X,

00:03:18.294 --> 00:03:21.611
you also have to multiply by 1.8.

00:03:21.611 --> 00:03:23.965
And so, X is three times 1.8,

00:03:23.965 --> 00:03:25.175
what is that going to be?

00:03:25.175 --> 00:03:27.819
Well, three times 18 is, what?

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:31.152
30, it's 54, so this is going to be 5.4.

00:03:33.313 --> 00:03:35.121
Let me verify that or show you that.

00:03:35.121 --> 00:03:37.640
18 or 1.8 times three,

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.179
three times eight is 24,

00:03:40.179 --> 00:03:44.510
three times one is
three, plus two is five,

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.677
one number behind the decimal
point, 5.4 and we're done.
