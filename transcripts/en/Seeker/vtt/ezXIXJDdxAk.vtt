00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.700
Either Douglas Adams was right, and mice are
protrusions of hyperintelligent pandimensional

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:13.960
beings into our universe, or we are on our
way to making Pinky and the Brain a reality...

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:14.960
Hey science news fans!

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.220
I’m Dr. Kiki from This Week in Science here
for DNews.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.390
Where did people get our big brains?

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.690
Evolutionary research suggests that something
happened in our past triggering a rapid expansion

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:29.820
of a part of our brains called the neo-cortex,
which is involved in higher level cognitive

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.130
functions like language and math.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.150
It could have been a cultural advancement,
like cooking, that freed up more energy for

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:37.150
the brain.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.300
But, the many underlying genetic factors that
differentiate the human brain from our nearest

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.150
primate cousins are virtually unknown.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.850
Studies scanning the human genome for genes
that might be the root of our unique brain

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.470
have found many human-specific genetic sequences
that regulate the activity of genes.

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.060
These sequences are called ‘enhancers’.

00:00:55.060 --> 00:01:00.600
But, the question remained whether there any
enhancers in the human genome that specifically

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.130
influence the development of the human brain?

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:08.370
In a study published on February 19th, 2015
in the journal Current Biology, scientists

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:13.280
reported that they had discovered a human
gene enhancer called Human-accelerated regulatory

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.210
enhancer 5, or HARE 5, that does just that.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.460
In mice, it led to the development of larger
brains.

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.141
Transgenic mouse embryos were created using
either a chimpanzee version of HARE 5 or the

00:01:26.141 --> 00:01:28.380
human version of the gene enhancer.

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.650
When the two groups of mice were compared,
it was obvious that the human HARE 5 activated

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:39.140
earlier in development, and triggered a more
robust response than the chimp version.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.210
The young neural cells in the brain, called
neural progenitor cells, proliferated more

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.210
quickly under the influence of human HARE
5, which led to bigger brains.

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.370
Twelve percent bigger than those with chimp
HARE 5 to be exact.

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:56.760
But, do bigger brains mean that these HARE
5 mice would be smarter than the average mouse?

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.661
That’s outside the scope of this particular
study, but a study published in the Journal

00:02:00.661 --> 00:02:06.799
of Neuroscience in December, 2014, injected
immature human glial cells, the cells that

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:11.020
pack in around neurons in the brain, into
the brains of baby mice.

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:16.550
Not only did these human cells completely
usurp the mouse glial populations, but also

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.490
resulted in four times better performance
on a memory test than control mice.

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.120
It’s thought that the human cells allowed
the mouse brains to work more efficiently,

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.890
but didn’t actually change how they functioned.

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.830
So, the mice were still mice, just a little
smarter thanks to the human glial cells.

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:37.000
Yet, this research raises the question of
how far we should go when mixing human cells

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.660
and genes with other animal species.

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.840
Our ability to learn by studying humans is
limited because we can’t very well go around

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.090
chopping people up in the name of science.

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.580
Since the advent of stem cell research and
genetic manipulation we have gained the ability

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.150
to mix our cells and genes within other animals,
and see how they work.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.599
Animals with human-like organs and cells make
research that would otherwise be impossible

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:01.750
possible.

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.140
The HARE 5 researchers plan to continue this
research, so we will very likely find out

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.180
whether this gene enhancer results in smarter
mice.

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.819
The point, however, is not to make a better,
faster, stronger mouse, or even to make human-like

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:15.819
mice.

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:19.640
The point of this line of research is to discover
more about the human brain, to discover what

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.819
makes it different, and to learn why some
people get neurodegenerative disorders when

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:27.850
others don’t, so that we can individualize
treatments appropriately.

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:33.000
Will research in this vein help humanity,
or will it inevitably lead to hyperintelligent

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.320
mice taking over the Earth?

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:45.180
Will we bow down to our mousey overlords?
