[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.210
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: All right.

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:08.300
How's everyone doing?

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:08.967
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:00:08.967 --> 00:00:10.049
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Great.

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:11.091
I got great on this side.

00:00:11.091 --> 00:00:12.090
How about in the middle?

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.017
How y'all feeling?

00:00:13.017 --> 00:00:14.270
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:15.353
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Right.

00:00:15.353 --> 00:00:18.275
And now over here,
how y'all feeling?

00:00:18.275 --> 00:00:21.189
This side over here has got
more tea, caffeine, sugar.

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:21.980
They're feeling it.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:22.850
I love it.

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.450
So as Shenaz was saying, my
name is Natalie Villalobos.

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.900
And I have the distinct
pleasure of serving all of you

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.110
as the head of Global Programs
for Women's Techmakers.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.060
And today is one
of my favorite days

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:38.840
in the entire
year, which is when

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.900
I get to hang out with the
community, with my peers,

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.120
with colleagues, with
role models, with mentors,

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.630
and actually get to interview
one on stage with all of you.

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:50.490
So kind of how
it's going to go is

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.700
I'm going to have 30
minutes of some questions

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.914
that I've prepared.

00:00:54.914 --> 00:00:56.330
And then we're
going to do some 15

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.922
minutes of audience Q&amp;A. So with
that, I'd like to get started.

00:00:59.922 --> 00:01:01.630
JULIA TIZARD: Be gentle
with me, Natalie.

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:02.090
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: I'll try.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.590
JULIA TIZARD: Thanks.

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:03.270
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
I don't know.

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:03.978
I'm going to try.

00:01:03.978 --> 00:01:05.150
This is pretty serious.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.370
All right.

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:08.630
So you're at Virgin Galactic.

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:09.380
JULIA TIZARD: Yes.

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:10.463
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Right?

00:01:10.463 --> 00:01:13.100
So we're going to start
from kind of some basics.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.010
How did you get into
the space industry?

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.900
JULIA TIZARD: That's kind of
an interesting story, actually.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.240
You can tell by my accent,
I'm not from the US.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.820
I'm from England.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.630
And I basically knew
from a very young age

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.210
that I wanted to get
into space somehow.

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.850
My dad was an
aeronautical engineer.

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.210
And I can remember
visiting his work

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.600
and traipsing
through wind tunnels

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.290
and seeing little
model airplanes

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.290
and just thinking it was
the coolest thing ever.

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.780
And then I'm not exactly
sure how the space connection

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.790
happened, but it
basically landed me

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.670
at university studying
for astrophysics.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.090
And I had this just
like inside desire

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.780
to get into the
space sector somehow.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.640
And for any of you that
know, England is not--

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.660
certainly, my generation was
not very active, at least

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.200
in the human space
flight portion of space.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.810
It's quite difficult to
get into that in the UK.

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:14.900
And while I was in my very last
year of my PhD at Manchester

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.520
University, there was a prize
called the XPRIZE going on,

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.800
which I'm sure a lot of you
are familiar with, where

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.920
SpaceShipOne and Scale
Composites supported

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.950
by Paul Allen won that prize.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.130
And I happened to be at
a conference in Vancouver

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:32.240
at the time.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.260
And me and a bunch of friends
had been following the XPRIZE.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.150
And we all decided--

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.170
well, we came from the
UK, we're in Vancouver.

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.220
LA, it's really
not that far away.

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.960
I'm a student at the time.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.670
And I'm like, no one will really
notice if we jump on a plane,

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.660
fly down to LA, and go out and
see the final XPRIZE flight.

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.720
So that's what we did, like
literally one afternoon to get

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.160
there for the next morning.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.170
And so myself and
a group of friends

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.270
jumped on that flight,
called up some friends we

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.290
had at Cal Tech, said get a
car, drive us out to the desert.

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.240
We got there about
5:00 in the morning,

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.520
slept for a couple
of hours, and then

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.170
got up to watch
the XPRIZE flight.

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:10.850
And that was when
Sir Richard Branson

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:16.010
announced that he was going to
bust into the market of space

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.640
tourism.

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.210
And I just got super
excited about that.

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:21.440
So I was like, not only
is this space tourism

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.360
and bringing space
to the public,

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.420
but it's also a British company
or a British-backed company

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:27.140
that's doing it.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.230
So I went back home
after that trip

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.790
and spent the last six months
of my PhD writing my thesis

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.290
and going to every
single conference

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.200
that Virgin Galactic talked at
and talked to everyone I could

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.900
and convinced them to give
me a three month internship,

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.590
essentially, when I finished
my doctorate program.

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.800
And that was 11 years ago.

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.550
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
So it was interesting,

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:52.520
just even that journey when you
were saying, I got on a plane,

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.790
and then I was in the desert.

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.690
It's like, and then there
was a spaceship lifting off.

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.059
It reminded me of some times
I've gone to Burning Man.

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.850
JULIA TIZARD: Yeah.

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:00.320
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Yeah.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.980
JULIA TIZARD: I
have done that, too.

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:01.910
There are similarities.

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:03.326
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
So I will say,

00:04:03.326 --> 00:04:05.802
I used to say that I
was a rocket scientist.

00:04:05.802 --> 00:04:07.760
Because I don't know
who's been to Burning Man,

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.120
but in 2009 I was one of
the builders of a four story

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.460
hand-rolled aluminum
rocket ship that we

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:17.000
told 60,000 people at Burning
Man was going to launch.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.160
And so we had the
whole of Burning Man

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.120
waiting, when really it was
just a fancy pyrotechnic show.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.865
So I'm kind of like
a rocket scientist.

00:04:26.865 --> 00:04:28.490
JULIA TIZARD: I'm
right there with you.

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:29.900
I think that's super cool.

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.240
I am fortunate that I get to
do that as my day to day job.

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.170
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
Yeah, I'm pretty jealous.

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:39.884
So as a part of your day
job, can you tell us,

00:04:39.884 --> 00:04:41.300
this dream that I
think many of us

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.270
have of going into
space and space tourism,

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.290
how are you making that into
a reality with your role

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:48.970
at Virgin Galactic?

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.920
JULIA TIZARD: And so I run
operations at Virgin Galactic,

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.551
which is a very
broad term, means

00:04:53.551 --> 00:04:55.550
a lot of things, a lot
of different things a lot

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:56.840
of different people.

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.290
But basically, what
that means for my job

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:04.760
is that it runs the gamut of
looking after and supporting

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.800
the pilot teams, the
maintenance teams that

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.010
service the vehicles, the
flight test portion, all

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:14.050
the way through to the
training and medical pieces

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:16.979
that the customers, once
the vehicle is ready,

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:18.770
the training and medical
programs that they

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.000
will go through to get them
onto the flight as well.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.702
So it's pretty much
almost the whole product.

00:05:23.702 --> 00:05:25.160
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
The whole show.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.493
JULIA TIZARD: I, obviously,
don't do all of that myself.

00:05:27.493 --> 00:05:31.070
I have a huge, amazing
team that does a lot

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:32.790
of the intricate work for that.

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:35.240
But in the 11 years that
I've been in the company,

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.910
I've kind of worked in
almost every sector,

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:39.920
and then hired the
team that is now

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:44.750
in place that puts the
smarts and the talent to it.

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:50.000
And we are right now
flight testing a vehicle.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.095
It's a two-stage system, White
Knight Two and a SpaceShip.

00:05:53.095 --> 00:05:54.720
The White Knight Two
is the mothership.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.428
The SpaceShip attaches
to the mothership,

00:05:56.428 --> 00:05:59.210
climbs up to 50,000 feet,
releases the SpaceShip,

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:01.790
SpaceShip launches up
into suborbital space

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:03.749
and comes back down and
lands just as a glider.

00:06:03.749 --> 00:06:05.914
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: You
make it sound really simple.

00:06:05.914 --> 00:06:06.920
JULIA TIZARD: Yeah.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.120
It's not simple.

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.730
But, you know, it's
also like if you

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:14.660
put the right amount of people
and the right talent of people

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:17.240
with the right passion on
a job, you can pretty much

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:18.110
achieve anything.

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:20.070
It just takes some
time sometimes.

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:23.570
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: You also
have the first female space

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:25.089
flight test pilot on your team.

00:06:25.089 --> 00:06:26.130
JULIA TIZARD: Yes, we do.

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:26.550
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Yeah.

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:27.341
JULIA TIZARD: Yeah.

00:06:27.341 --> 00:06:29.820
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: And what
is her role like right now?

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:32.570
JULIA TIZARD: So she's
fully-fledged one

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:35.570
of the test pilots on our team.

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:39.890
So she plays both a role
in the mission control

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:42.770
when she's not actively
flying the vehicles.

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:44.930
We like to have a pilot
on the ground talking

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:47.270
to pilots in the vehicles.

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:50.120
So all of the pilots perform
that function if they're not

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:54.389
in either the right or left--
so the copilot or pilot seat--

00:06:54.389 --> 00:06:55.930
of either the White
Knight Two, which

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:57.596
is the mothership,
or the SpaceShip Two,

00:06:57.596 --> 00:06:59.507
which is the space ship.

00:06:59.507 --> 00:07:01.590
They have to do a lot of
flight training for that.

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:05.540
So we also have additional
vehicles an extra [INAUDIBLE],,

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:10.970
which they do a lot of G
training and just more complex

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:12.800
aircraft air practice in.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.810
And then they're
in the simulator

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:18.650
all the time running
simulations both independently

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:21.530
with their fellow
pilots to make sure they

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:23.690
have a really good
relationship in the cockpit,

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:26.480
and they really go
through those procedures.

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.990
And it has to be very
smartly timed and very cued

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:31.720
off each other.

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.100
And then they also
do those simulations

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:36.350
with the wider team
in mission control

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:37.880
as well to make
sure that we can run

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:42.140
through lots of
different situations

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:43.940
that we might find in flight.

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:46.490
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: So
a big part, I would say,

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:52.280
of that excitement
to go into space

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:54.380
is the spirit of adventure.

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:56.840
And can you tell me a
little bit about how

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:59.570
the spirit of adventure
and the challenge, how

00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:04.460
that plays into your work and,
I guess, your day-to-day role?

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:08.690
JULIA TIZARD: So for me what
I'm all about fundamentally,

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:11.660
regardless of space or whatever
I'm doing, is adventure.

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:15.140
Adventure is the one word that
really kind of sums me up.

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:18.470
I think it is critically
important to everybody

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:20.270
to find their own
piece of adventure,

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:25.490
because I really feel like
it helps self-development,

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:28.880
really pushing your boundaries
to get to know yourself.

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:32.539
And I also believe it is
critically important for teams

00:08:32.539 --> 00:08:35.600
as well to help
kind of put people

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:39.230
together with a central
objective to really go

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:40.580
challenge themselves.

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:42.380
And when you're
working on a program

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:45.230
like trying to take
people to space,

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:48.500
there is, obviously, a lot
of challenges both technical,

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:51.640
personal, inter-relational.

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:53.540
Pretty much they
run the full gamut.

00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:56.150
And so you really
have to have people

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:59.480
that are willing to tackle
those, that have the passion

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:02.030
to tackle them, and the
courage and the commitment

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:04.419
to see them through as well.

00:09:04.419 --> 00:09:05.960
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
And you even said

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:09.260
when we were having a
chance to chat this week

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.420
that you really have to break.

00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:12.950
To be a better
human, you have to go

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:14.840
beyond your personal boundaries.

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:16.550
You have to get uncomfortable.

00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:17.630
Can you speak to that?

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:19.070
JULIA TIZARD: Yeah.

00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:23.420
So I think probably
the best way that I

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:26.420
would put it is that I do
a lot of mountain climbing.

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:31.430
And, actually, I am taking
a temporary breather

00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:33.760
from mountain climbing to
having children right now.

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:36.100
I climb smaller
mountains these days.

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:37.670
But I do a lot of
mountain climbing.

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:42.350
And for me, that is a lot
about pushing yourself, again,

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:44.300
to get to know who you are.

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:47.360
But a bigger portion
of that is really

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:50.450
kind of getting a fresh
perspective on things.

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:53.360
I really, truly believe
that humans are just

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:58.250
incredibly capable beings
and that most people have

00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:01.010
no idea actually what they're
capable of until they really

00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:03.459
push themselves and set
themselves higher goals

00:10:03.459 --> 00:10:05.000
and set themselves
higher challenges.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.120
And you have to be willing
to fail at those things

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:10.250
in order to push
yourself that far.

00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:14.060
And we also have this other
tendency as human beings

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:18.560
to get distracted by
things that seem very, very

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:23.150
big in the moment, but
actually in the scope of things

00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:24.500
really aren't big.

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:29.900
We've all had those break ups
with a spouse or a boyfriend

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:31.670
or girlfriend.

00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:34.580
We've had Monday mornings
really not working for us,

00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:36.080
being in traffic
jams, and feeling

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:37.700
like the world is breaking down.

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:40.130
And those things
really get in our way.

00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:43.490
And when you can put some
adventure and some challenge

00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:48.440
in your life, you get a totally
radical perspective change

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:49.190
on the world.

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:51.290
And that is one of
the things that I'm

00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:55.760
excited to work towards
getting, essentially,

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:57.350
a civilization to space.

00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:59.840
Because I think the
perspective shift that's

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:03.680
going to come with that that
is real and experienced rather

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:06.020
than just
knowledge-based I think

00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:08.730
is going to fundamentally
change us as human beings.

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:11.409
It will really put us
in to the space age.

00:11:11.409 --> 00:11:12.450
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Yeah.

00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:14.866
I was kind of thinking of the
movie "Wall-E" for a second,

00:11:14.866 --> 00:11:17.900
where you get everyone
on a big spaceship.

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:20.560
But I think it's going to
take maybe 10 at a time or 100

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:21.060
at a time.

00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:23.510
I don't know if we can take
a whole civilization yet.

00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:23.660
Yeah.

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:24.680
When you were
speaking to adventure,

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:26.520
it's a big rallying
cry in my life.

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:29.240
It's a big kind of
theme and motto.

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:32.120
So one of the things that
I really like to do is,

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:35.690
if I can't add it in every day--
because we've got the mundane,

00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:39.380
we've got our eight hours of
meetings and things like that--

00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:42.050
is my partner and I,
Timothy, we have something

00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:43.750
called adventure Sunday.

00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:47.210
And adventure Sunday is
where we spend a whole day

00:11:47.210 --> 00:11:49.400
just doing something
we've never done before.

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:51.800
So you can very easily
practice adventure.

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:55.250
We've done flying
trapeze lessons.

00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:59.960
He's also taken me to
do a walk with a hawk

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:01.880
and learned falconry.

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:05.060
So there's definite things where
I'm challenging myself just

00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:08.450
to put my technology away
and just go adventure

00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:09.590
in mind, body, and spirit.

00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:11.570
And I think that
that also helps me

00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:16.520
bring just a more clear present
sense of myself into my work,

00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:17.601
say, on that Monday.

00:12:17.601 --> 00:12:19.100
JULIA TIZARD: And
it's a lot of fun.

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:19.990
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Yes.

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:20.490
Cool.

00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:23.070
So a couple of space questions.

00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:25.760
So how do you see
the space industry

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:29.390
influencing the tech
industry and vice versa?

00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:32.250
JULIA TIZARD:
Interesting question.

00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:35.190
So I mean, I think in a
whole multitude of ways,

00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:39.260
you only have to go
back to the Apollo days

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:43.280
to realize they ran an entire
Luna mission on less computing

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:45.156
power than we have in
our handheld phones.

00:12:45.156 --> 00:12:47.030
In fact, I think it's
like 100 or 1,000 times

00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:49.820
less computing power
than is in our phones.

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:57.260
And space in general has shown
a very long-lasting trend

00:12:57.260 --> 00:13:00.080
of just spin-off
technologies coming out

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:02.690
of the challenge
of the innovation

00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:05.090
that it takes to get
yourself into those types

00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:06.640
of environments.

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:08.370
Velcro is one example.

00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:11.000
It's not tech, but we wouldn't
have that in the world

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:11.790
if it hadn't been for
the space program.

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:12.570
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
Velcro's life-changing.

00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:14.200
JULIA TIZARD: So, yeah.

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:16.370
And so I think there's
a natural dynamic there.

00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:19.820
Anytime you're pushing the
boundaries to do something,

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:21.350
you need the tools to do it.

00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:24.759
And also, you take a tool
and you use it in one way.

00:13:24.759 --> 00:13:26.300
And you find out
that, actually, it's

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:30.180
very useful in a
myriad of other ways.

00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:33.410
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: And so we
have 300 women in this room.

00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:37.040
We will have 14,000
women connecting with us

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:38.930
over the next couple of months.

00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:42.110
How can women in this room and
in other parts of the world,

00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:44.810
online, everywhere-- what
is the thing that we should

00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:47.461
do either as women or just
as technologists really--

00:13:47.461 --> 00:13:48.710
it doesn't matter your gender.

00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:52.220
It could be non-gender
binary, gender non-conforming.

00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:56.107
What can we do to participate
in space exploration?

00:13:56.107 --> 00:13:57.940
JULIA TIZARD: So I think
a couple of things.

00:13:57.940 --> 00:14:02.930
And Communication is always
a huge one for any company.

00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:07.640
And it's particularly
important in the space arena

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:10.490
as well, just because programs
tend to be highly dynamic

00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:12.290
and move very fast.

00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:15.020
So we live in a
world right now where

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:19.064
communication tools are
extremely elevated from where

00:14:19.064 --> 00:14:19.730
they used to be.

00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:22.520
And those are real
enablers to the function

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:24.860
of working in a company.

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:27.410
The same with collaborative
spaces as well.

00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:33.080
It's just my opinion, but
in the space industry,

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:35.570
it's come from a kind
of old space arena

00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:38.960
where each person had an
individual job that they did.

00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:40.460
And each of those
individual jobs

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:44.090
added up to create the whole.

00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:47.420
And I think we're moving
in this shift in new space

00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:49.580
to a much more collaborative
working environment.

00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:53.120
And we're seeing the strengths
in working in small teams

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:55.890
and making sure that we're
much better integrated

00:14:55.890 --> 00:14:57.920
and that we're doing that
right at the beginning

00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:01.310
of the program, rather
than it being a stage later

00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:03.050
on in the program.

00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:04.880
So those kind of
tools as well are just

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:07.140
incredibly important to us.

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:09.800
And then I think the obvious
one pretty much to everyone

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:15.490
is just promotion, both to bring
business funds and investment

00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:18.850
in, but also to
provide inspiration

00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:20.890
and education for the
next generation as well.

00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:24.280
If we don't have the talented
workforce to do these things

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:27.049
and to rise to these challenges,
then we can't do any of them.

00:15:27.049 --> 00:15:28.090
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Yeah.

00:15:28.090 --> 00:15:32.380
So I used to do a lot
of Citizen Science work.

00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:34.150
So I was recently
reading an article

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:39.670
about how DIY makers and
scientists are trying

00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:43.210
to put together the science and
learn the science themselves

00:15:43.210 --> 00:15:47.050
to be able to put themselves
into space without, say, SpaceX

00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:47.950
or Virgin Galactic.

00:15:47.950 --> 00:15:49.600
And governments are
getting involved,

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:51.110
and companies are
getting involved.

00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:53.443
So this is a pretty highly
competitive landscape, right?

00:15:53.443 --> 00:15:56.710
So can you tell me and
share some insights

00:15:56.710 --> 00:16:00.370
on what it has taken to drive
the space program at Virgin

00:16:00.370 --> 00:16:02.320
Galactic given this
very technically

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:04.840
competitive landscape?

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:07.990
JULIA TIZARD: So I guess I'll
answer that question maybe

00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:11.080
from a non-technical
perspective to start off with.

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:13.570
A big part of the role I
play in Virgin Galactic

00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:15.640
as a company is in
the kind of business

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:20.350
strategic end of things as well
as kind of in the tech end.

00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:25.480
And from that perspective,
really the reason

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:29.770
Virgin Galactic exists is
because of the commitments

00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:32.290
of the Virgin Group and
of Sir Richard Branson

00:16:32.290 --> 00:16:37.320
and the investment partners to
continually fund the program.

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:41.350
And they realize the
innate value in it.

00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:45.639
And without those
backers, you just

00:16:45.639 --> 00:16:46.930
wouldn't get off of the ground.

00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:49.060
And there was some great
talks earlier today

00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:52.510
just on people having
founded companies

00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:55.910
and really realizing how
much of a pot of gold

00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:58.660
that is to have someone who
believes in a product enough

00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:00.790
and can see the end value
in the product enough

00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:04.810
to really keep
fundamentally backing it.

00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:10.390
I think Virgin has an edge
there in terms of our input

00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:13.150
to the space industry, just
because the Virgin Group

00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:17.380
portfolio is a very, very
diverse investment portfolio.

00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:19.210
So it tends to be quite stable.

00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:23.619
And when you're doing anything
in the space environment,

00:17:23.619 --> 00:17:25.839
it does cost high dollars.

00:17:25.839 --> 00:17:28.300
So you either have to have
a single person bankrolling

00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:32.470
that who has a lot of them
or a more stable investment

00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:36.140
platform that can continually
kind of feed you those funds

00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:37.450
to create it.

00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:39.730
So I think that's one side.

00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:47.110
On the tech side, we are
fortunate that Richard Branson

00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:51.520
saw an opportunity
in a specific system

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:55.330
that Burt Rutan had
designed with what

00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:56.890
we call a feathering
system, which

00:17:56.890 --> 00:17:59.830
is a new technology, a new
re-entry technology, to come

00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:01.480
back from space.

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:03.580
It works in the
suborbital arena,

00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:05.060
just because the
energies that you

00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:06.810
have to lose coming
through the atmosphere

00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:08.980
are in around where this
feathering system works.

00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:13.720
But that is fundamentally a
new technology on our vehicles

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:17.740
that is innovation,
that is giving us

00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:19.510
a different model
of spaceflight.

00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:23.815
And it takes away the
high G's of re-entry.

00:18:23.815 --> 00:18:25.960
It takes away a lot
of the heat that you

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:29.980
have on that re-entry back
into the atmosphere as well.

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:33.340
And so that's definitely
an area that, I guess,

00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:36.800
we have a different
product on the market.

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:39.610
I will say that Virgin is
very friendly to competition

00:18:39.610 --> 00:18:45.330
and actually encourages it
in a lot of our industries.

00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:47.830
And I think that is
equally important in space.

00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:51.220
Because you never know
which technology out

00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:52.570
there is going to be successful.

00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:54.670
You need a myriad of
those technologies

00:18:54.670 --> 00:18:58.480
in order to have one or two
that really work and thrive.

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:04.000
And other people come up with
spaceship designs that work,

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.544
then we would
absolutely operate them.

00:19:06.544 --> 00:19:07.710
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Awesome.

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:09.420
JULIA TIZARD: If anybody wants
to start a space company out

00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:09.890
there, feel free.

00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:10.120
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Yeah.

00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:11.350
You can come pitch
her afterwards.

00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:11.849
Yeah.

00:19:11.849 --> 00:19:13.630
I think we could
go tour it later.

00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:19.390
But there's a model
of a Virgin Galactic--

00:19:19.390 --> 00:19:22.525
it's much smaller-- in one
of the Google lobbies--

00:19:22.525 --> 00:19:23.380
JULIA TIZARD: Nice.

00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:24.160
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
--which is something

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:25.720
that's always inspired
me when I first

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:26.803
started working at Google.

00:19:26.803 --> 00:19:29.260
I was like, oh,
man, space ships.

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:31.120
So thank you so much
for sharing that.

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:33.640
And I want to pivot
just a little bit, too.

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:37.660
So going back into a
little bit of your story,

00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:40.300
you briefly touched on
so you climb mountains.

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:42.890
You've also run a marathon,
or many marathons,

00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:44.561
but one specifically
at the North Pole--

00:19:44.561 --> 00:19:45.310
JULIA TIZARD: Yes.

00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:46.810
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
--which I assume

00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:50.620
is pretty challenging
in and of itself.

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:53.290
And in the work
that you're doing,

00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:57.190
space tourism and supporting all
the people that you're doing,

00:19:57.190 --> 00:19:59.280
it sounds pretty challenging.

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:01.180
And I want to know
are there moments

00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:02.960
where you want to give up?

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:06.400
And in those moments
where you want to give up,

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:09.880
what kept you going?

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:12.480
JULIA TIZARD: So
there's a couple of--

00:20:15.151 --> 00:20:16.260
we'll get to the answer.

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:19.860
But I'm going to precede this
with a little bit of context.

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:22.890
The reason or one of the reasons
I like running long distance

00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:26.010
or marathons is-- and I think
there's a quote out there that

00:20:26.010 --> 00:20:27.870
goes along the lines of--

00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:30.540
you can learn anything you want
to learn about yourself running

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:32.460
26.2 miles.

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:34.260
And that is very, very true.

00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:40.650
We are human beings with these
little voices in our head.

00:20:40.650 --> 00:20:45.300
And really, physically, if
you can run a half marathon,

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:47.400
your body is able
to run a marathon.

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:50.430
The difference that that second
part of the marathon takes

00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:56.240
is you being trained to
be kind enough to yourself

00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:59.730
to keep encouraging
yourself to finish.

00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:02.460
And that's really probably
the biggest strength

00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:05.710
that I take out of running
marathons and marathon

00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:06.210
training.

00:21:06.210 --> 00:21:09.750
And it absolutely applies
to any challenging task

00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:12.390
that you kind of put
in front of yourself.

00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:14.250
And then there's a
second component.

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:19.080
Look at the North Pole race.

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:21.600
So I came up with
this crazy idea.

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:24.700
I was reading all these
books about exploration.

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:27.840
And I happened to be reading
about the North and South Pole

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:33.520
and Roald Amundsen, and Scott
and Shackleton, and Peary.

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:37.740
And I was really inspired
to go to the pole.

00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:41.520
And so I must've been
googling online somewhere.

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:43.716
And I came across this
marathon at the North Pole.

00:21:43.716 --> 00:21:45.840
And I was like, hey, I'd
like to run long distance.

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:46.895
That would be amazing.

00:21:46.895 --> 00:21:47.520
I looked it up.

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:51.330
And it's like, oh, it's
17,500 pound entrance fee.

00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:52.440
How am I going to do that?

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:53.880
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Do
they have scholarships?

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:54.200
JULIA TIZARD: Yeah.

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:54.690
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Yeah.

00:21:54.690 --> 00:21:57.060
JULIA TIZARD: And then it
actually was fortunate,

00:21:57.060 --> 00:22:00.300
because Virgin was taking
over the London Marathon

00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:01.290
the same year.

00:22:01.290 --> 00:22:04.020
It had been the Flora
Marathon for a very long time.

00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:06.480
But Virgin was taking
it over that same year.

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:08.850
And the date of the
North Pole Marathon

00:22:08.850 --> 00:22:11.880
was like two weeks before
the London Marathon.

00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:14.880
And I was like, wow, you know,
I work for Virgin in the cutting

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:16.890
edge of Virgin space industry.

00:22:16.890 --> 00:22:19.800
So surely, if I run a
marathon in the North Pole

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:23.250
two weeks before the London
Virgin Marathon launches,

00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:26.440
that's going to be a really cool
promotional thing for Virgin.

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:30.354
And so I literally flew off
like one or two emails to people

00:22:30.354 --> 00:22:31.770
to kind of say,
hey, would this be

00:22:31.770 --> 00:22:33.390
at all something
that was interesting,

00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:36.450
not thinking that the answer
I was going to get was yes.

00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:37.809
And it turned out it was.

00:22:37.809 --> 00:22:39.600
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
Then you had to commit.

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:40.340
JULIA TIZARD: Oh.

00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:41.079
Great, yeah.

00:22:41.079 --> 00:22:42.870
So [INAUDIBLE] I was
like, oh, my goodness.

00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:45.930
I guess I am running a
marathon at the North Pole.

00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:47.760
The most interesting
part about that is I

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:51.090
had actually never run a
marathon at that point in time.

00:22:51.090 --> 00:22:53.340
So the North Pole Marathon
was my first ever marathon.

00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:54.480
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
You didn't mention

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:56.850
that at all like in your
bio or when we were talking.

00:22:56.850 --> 00:22:57.556
That's insane.

00:22:57.556 --> 00:22:58.680
JULIA TIZARD: It is insane.

00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:00.720
But the beauty about
that was that I

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:03.030
trained so hard for that
race, because I was really

00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:04.110
scared of it.

00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:08.270
And the amazing thing was
that once I got there,

00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:11.550
there was I think probably
25 other people who

00:23:11.550 --> 00:23:14.310
were running this marathon
who were all people who

00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:15.510
just ran marathons.

00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:16.560
That was their thing.

00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:18.720
That was what was normal
to them in their life,

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:20.520
because they'd run 50 before.

00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:23.010
And they'd already run
across the Greenland ice

00:23:23.010 --> 00:23:24.480
sheet or the Sahara Desert.

00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:28.200
So being there with
that group of people,

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:30.900
I actually wasn't running
this crazy scary marathon

00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:31.710
at the North Pole.

00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:33.780
I was just running a
marathon doing the things

00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:35.280
that those people did every day.

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:36.990
And I was joining them.

00:23:36.990 --> 00:23:40.320
It was this massive
leveler of a playing field.

00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:43.940
And all of a sudden, what I was
doing that day became ordinary.

00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:46.190
And I think that's what
enabled me to achieve it.

00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:47.730
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: And you
didn't feel intimidated by it.

00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:49.349
It was like, these
are my people.

00:23:49.349 --> 00:23:50.140
JULIA TIZARD: Yeah.

00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:51.540
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
This is my community.

00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:53.225
JULIA TIZARD: And that is
exactly the power of community.

00:23:53.225 --> 00:23:53.724
Yeah.

00:23:53.724 --> 00:23:56.580
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:23:56.580 --> 00:24:00.430
So I want to throw in kind of
one of the random questions

00:24:00.430 --> 00:24:00.930
that I--

00:24:00.930 --> 00:24:02.670
I mean, I love writing
all these questions.

00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:04.170
But this one in
particular, I think,

00:24:04.170 --> 00:24:06.630
was just really striking for me.

00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:09.510
So I know there's a
dramatic suspenseful pause

00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:11.970
in the audience.

00:24:11.970 --> 00:24:15.300
If you are an intergalactic
real estate agent

00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:17.100
and you needed to
sell someone on why

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:20.220
they should buy a house on
Mars, what would your pitch be?

00:24:22.727 --> 00:24:24.060
JULIA TIZARD: Real estate agent.

00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:24.570
OK.

00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:27.630
Intergalactic real estate agent.

00:24:27.630 --> 00:24:33.270
Well, I mean, I would
go at the drop of a hat,

00:24:33.270 --> 00:24:34.680
mostly for the adventure of it.

00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:37.710
That's not everybody's
cup of tea.

00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:41.580
I would probably talk to
them about how amazing

00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:43.920
the rocket ride was
going to be to get there,

00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:47.520
how incredible the whole
thought process was

00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:49.690
going to be of how do
you build a house on Mars

00:24:49.690 --> 00:24:56.340
and how that might be different
from how it would be on Earth.

00:24:56.340 --> 00:24:58.590
One of the things that I've
always loved about space

00:24:58.590 --> 00:25:02.250
and that I've always had the
best conversations about space

00:25:02.250 --> 00:25:08.060
on is that it is almost this
arena for a thought experiment.

00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:12.120
You don't have to
take anything with you

00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:14.460
when you put your mind
in the perspective

00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:18.350
of, especially, more
far out space travel.

00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:21.290
You don't have to bring a
political system with you.

00:25:21.290 --> 00:25:26.060
You don't have to bring
your 2.5 children,

00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:27.860
suburban home with you.

00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:29.750
You get to create
something entirely new.

00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:33.020
And it kind of releases you
from a lot of the constraints

00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:37.400
that you would naturally
have these default settings

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:39.770
when you're looking
at things on Earth.

00:25:39.770 --> 00:25:43.970
So I would probably
pitch it as something

00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:47.660
that you could get very
actively involved in

00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:52.089
and create your own home.

00:25:52.089 --> 00:25:53.880
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
Create your own planet.

00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:54.740
JULIA TIZARD: Create
your own planet.

00:25:54.740 --> 00:25:57.150
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Create your
own house, planet, government.

00:25:57.150 --> 00:25:58.430
JULIA TIZARD: And sell
it to all your friends.

00:25:58.430 --> 00:26:00.560
Because, obviously, you want
to have all your friends there.

00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:01.840
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: It's
kind of like a land grab,

00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:03.190
and then you can sell
off pieces of it.

00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:03.490
JULIA TIZARD: Yeah.

00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:04.531
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Yeah.

00:26:05.804 --> 00:26:08.220
JULIA TIZARD: You know what's
interesting about that, too?

00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:08.780
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
Sell me on it.

00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:10.070
On Sell me on it.

00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:12.440
JULIA TIZARD: Who knows
if we'll even have money?

00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:13.460
You don't even have
to take money to Mars.

00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:16.001
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: It's just
like a barter and trade system,

00:26:16.001 --> 00:26:16.970
or you just wink.

00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:17.340
JULIA TIZARD: Yeah.

00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:18.350
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
A new currency?

00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:19.700
JULIA TIZARD: You know,
tap the red shoes,

00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:21.090
the heels of the red
shoes together, right?

00:26:21.090 --> 00:26:21.233
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Yeah.

00:26:21.233 --> 00:26:23.780
That would be mandatory in
my intergalactic government.

00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:25.590
Everyone wears
sparkly red shoes.

00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:27.410
Yeah.

00:26:27.410 --> 00:26:30.140
So like I said, we have
so many incredible women

00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:34.379
here in New York, in
Seattle, in Lagos, Sydney.

00:26:34.379 --> 00:26:35.420
And we're all passionate.

00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:37.970
We're all people who
are powerful and can

00:26:37.970 --> 00:26:39.210
change the game.

00:26:39.210 --> 00:26:41.990
So what startup should
someone in this room

00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:45.770
create to get ahead
of and participate

00:26:45.770 --> 00:26:48.474
in the space tourism industry?

00:26:48.474 --> 00:26:50.015
JULIA TIZARD: That's
a good question.

00:26:53.126 --> 00:26:55.430
There are so many things,
so many things that we need.

00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:57.180
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
And then we don't have

00:26:57.180 --> 00:26:58.360
to tell anyone else in here.

00:26:58.360 --> 00:26:59.943
Like, someone can
just take this idea,

00:26:59.943 --> 00:27:01.050
and then just run with it.

00:27:01.050 --> 00:27:01.790
JULIA TIZARD: And run with it.

00:27:01.790 --> 00:27:02.670
OK.

00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:06.120
Well, attire, we are
right in the thick right

00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:09.210
now of figuring out what
our everyday astronauts are

00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:10.820
going to wear in space.

00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:17.420
And I mean, it totally can have
a massive fashion bent to it.

00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:20.190
But there is actually a
technical piece to that

00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:20.940
as well.

00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:23.820
You know, the skin
of our space ship

00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:27.300
is likely to be below freezing.

00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:30.780
It is carried at 50,000
feet for a period of time

00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:32.490
before it's released,
and then you're

00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:34.190
going into space
vacuum environment.

00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:35.850
So it gets very cold.

00:27:35.850 --> 00:27:37.440
So people will need
to wear gloves.

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:40.410
So something as simple
as, go invent some gloves

00:27:40.410 --> 00:27:44.220
that you can really get
the most enjoyment out

00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:46.440
of weightlessness.

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:48.510
So they need to be very free.

00:27:48.510 --> 00:27:53.980
But they also need to be great
materials and all that stuff

00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:56.650
for working in weightlessness.

00:27:59.080 --> 00:27:59.580
Gosh.

00:27:59.580 --> 00:28:02.340
I mean, we have had
bizarre requests

00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:08.070
for taking things to space all
the way from ashes to pets to--

00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:09.570
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
Like, live pets?

00:28:09.570 --> 00:28:10.890
JULIA TIZARD: Yeah.

00:28:10.890 --> 00:28:11.391
To a--

00:28:11.391 --> 00:28:13.515
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: I'm
just thinking [INAUDIBLE]..

00:28:13.515 --> 00:28:15.540
JULIA TIZARD: --whole
bunch of different gamuts.

00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:18.900
And we have not solved any
of those problems of how

00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:20.390
we could do any of those items.

00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:25.275
So I don't know if you could
look at things like that.

00:28:25.275 --> 00:28:28.800
I'm trying to think of something
real fundamental to what

00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:30.770
we need right now.

00:28:30.770 --> 00:28:33.799
I think the training is the
other big aspect as well.

00:28:33.799 --> 00:28:36.090
You know, we're very focused
on the hardware right now.

00:28:36.090 --> 00:28:41.180
But training customers to be
able to go and utilize space

00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:45.360
or to be able to go and utilize
the time they have in space

00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:47.740
is very important.

00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:51.250
And there's a very specific
art to that as well.

00:28:51.250 --> 00:28:55.020
And it's not just about
what you have to know

00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:56.285
and what you have to do.

00:28:56.285 --> 00:28:57.660
And, actually,
the environment is

00:28:57.660 --> 00:29:01.200
pretty passive in our
particular vehicle.

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:05.010
But it's how do you get
people comfortable with being

00:29:05.010 --> 00:29:08.220
inside a cabin for a
long period of time

00:29:08.220 --> 00:29:09.720
with a couple of other people?

00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:12.310
How do you get people
comfortable with the noises

00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:14.850
they're going to hear
from the rocket motor

00:29:14.850 --> 00:29:16.950
when they're released?

00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:19.560
How do you address all of
those kind of potential anxiety

00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:22.410
issues that we may see
with some of our customers?

00:29:22.410 --> 00:29:25.010
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: And what
about health monitoring, right?

00:29:25.010 --> 00:29:30.600
When I think of NASA and when
I've visited Houston, I mean,

00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:33.180
you've got to go through some
pretty rigorous health tests.

00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:36.390
So what is that kind of like
for getting people into space?

00:29:36.390 --> 00:29:38.790
JULIA TIZARD: That is actually
a really great area for us

00:29:38.790 --> 00:29:41.850
to look at and for any of
you guys to look at, too.

00:29:41.850 --> 00:29:44.130
Health monitoring
would be super helpful.

00:29:44.130 --> 00:29:50.200
We actually did a lot of
work on the medical portion

00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:54.630
of our spaceflight endeavor.

00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:58.480
We are taking the everyday
person into space.

00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:01.334
And one of the things we
realized very early on

00:30:01.334 --> 00:30:03.750
is that we had this technical
challenge with the vehicles.

00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:07.860
But then we also had this
potentially medical challenge

00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:11.550
with our customers in that it's
not like NASA astronauts where

00:30:11.550 --> 00:30:13.200
we're--

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:17.010
excuse me-- pre-selecting
them to be healthy

00:30:17.010 --> 00:30:18.750
fit individuals to go to space.

00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:22.890
We are taking the people
that can, right now, afford

00:30:22.890 --> 00:30:23.490
the tickets.

00:30:23.490 --> 00:30:27.690
And that tends to be
an older generation.

00:30:27.690 --> 00:30:29.982
Not all the time,
but in general,

00:30:29.982 --> 00:30:31.440
it tends to be an
older generation.

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:36.330
And it also tends to be people
who have lived life fully.

00:30:36.330 --> 00:30:38.460
So they have a lot of the
regular medical issues

00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:39.530
that you would expect.

00:30:39.530 --> 00:30:43.200
And it is a big
unknown, actually.

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:44.670
So what happens
with those people

00:30:44.670 --> 00:30:46.740
when you put them
under high G-forces,

00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:49.290
and then through
weightlessness, and then

00:30:49.290 --> 00:30:50.740
through all that
kind of anxiety?

00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:53.460
So we did a lot
of work hiring out

00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:56.130
a centrifuge, which is one
of those big things that

00:30:56.130 --> 00:30:58.920
spins around to
simulate high G-forces.

00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:01.470
And we actually had
all of our customers

00:31:01.470 --> 00:31:05.550
go through that
centrifuge and ride

00:31:05.550 --> 00:31:08.160
the profile of the vehicle,
so that we could collect

00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:11.910
information from them
to feel good about where

00:31:11.910 --> 00:31:15.630
we could accept or not accept
those medical conditions.

00:31:15.630 --> 00:31:18.450
And on the whole,
the answer we got

00:31:18.450 --> 00:31:23.880
was that pretty much nothing
was in the way of people going.

00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:26.200
And people couldn't
have current disease.

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:29.700
But if they had past disease
and it was controlled,

00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:32.040
it was actually
working out very well.

00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:35.190
But it is something that we
would want to monitor and get

00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:37.350
a lot more
information on just so

00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:40.200
that we can expand
the ability for people

00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:41.590
to ride on our space ships.

00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:42.840
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: I love it.

00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:45.130
I love increased
access for more people.

00:31:45.130 --> 00:31:47.067
So I can sit here and
talk to her all day.

00:31:47.067 --> 00:31:48.900
But I think what's more
important is to hear

00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:50.250
more voices in the room.

00:31:50.250 --> 00:31:54.620
So we actually have some mic
runners in the room holding up

00:31:54.620 --> 00:31:55.640
some mics.

00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:57.810
And we would love to
take some live questions.

00:31:57.810 --> 00:32:00.620
So mic runners, will
you do your thing?

00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:02.119
Sure, we'll start over here.

00:32:02.119 --> 00:32:02.660
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:03.535
Thanks for this talk.

00:32:03.535 --> 00:32:04.620
It was really interesting.

00:32:04.620 --> 00:32:07.130
There's a lot of space
themed talks today.

00:32:07.130 --> 00:32:09.680
One of my friends was
really interested in NASA.

00:32:09.680 --> 00:32:11.685
And I said, oh, why
should we invest in NASA?

00:32:11.685 --> 00:32:14.840
And she made the point that
every dollar invested in NASA

00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:17.550
actually was profitable
for the US Government.

00:32:17.550 --> 00:32:22.685
And I was wondering how that
compared in the private sector.

00:32:22.685 --> 00:32:25.710
JULIA TIZARD: So I think
it probably doesn't

00:32:25.710 --> 00:32:26.960
compare in the private sector.

00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:30.890
I mean, the private sector is
literally all private money.

00:32:30.890 --> 00:32:34.330
It goes to the jobs of the
people working on the program

00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:38.480
and to the technology
that's being created.

00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:42.320
I definitely believe there
is a huge role for NASA

00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:44.770
and government
programs in space.

00:32:44.770 --> 00:32:47.720
And there is also a huge
role for the private sector.

00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:50.540
And the way I like
to see that split

00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:54.890
is that the private sector
has a lot more ability

00:32:54.890 --> 00:33:03.650
to be able to run fast, to be
able to do R&amp;D a lot quicker,

00:33:03.650 --> 00:33:08.370
and also to be able to
scale a lot quicker as well

00:33:08.370 --> 00:33:11.880
than perhaps NASA or a
government agency can do.

00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:16.220
So where we have found strength
is that the private sector

00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:23.060
takes on these kind of
current projects of scaling

00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:26.510
current technology and doing
some element of development

00:33:26.510 --> 00:33:30.500
as well, but basically getting
the cost of access to space

00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:31.250
down.

00:33:31.250 --> 00:33:33.500
And then the government
agencies really

00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:39.140
can focus on the science
and the real far future R&amp;D

00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:42.010
where we are changing
different propulsion systems,

00:33:42.010 --> 00:33:44.210
finding our warp
drive that we really

00:33:44.210 --> 00:33:47.090
need today to be able to
get further out into space,

00:33:47.090 --> 00:33:50.540
and to be focused on those kind
of bigger future projects that

00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:54.500
will then support the commercial
industry in expanding them

00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:58.280
and making them more readily
available and more cost

00:33:58.280 --> 00:33:59.290
effective.

00:33:59.290 --> 00:34:01.290
AUDIENCE: So [INAUDIBLE]
focus of the government

00:34:01.290 --> 00:34:03.090
to have research go
back into the public?

00:34:03.090 --> 00:34:06.749
Whereas, private tends to
be more focused on scaling?

00:34:06.749 --> 00:34:07.540
JULIA TIZARD: Yeah.

00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:09.520
And making a profit, too.

00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:11.290
I mean, that's what
we're all here for is

00:34:11.290 --> 00:34:15.371
that any private company that
is into space is doing it,

00:34:15.371 --> 00:34:17.620
because they believe there's
a business case behind it

00:34:17.620 --> 00:34:18.576
as well.

00:34:18.576 --> 00:34:19.659
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Great.

00:34:19.659 --> 00:34:20.290
All right.

00:34:20.290 --> 00:34:22.489
One in the middle.

00:34:22.489 --> 00:34:23.620
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:29.739
You spoke earlier about
reaching and trying for things

00:34:29.739 --> 00:34:31.389
that you're not
sure that you can do

00:34:31.389 --> 00:34:33.199
and not being afraid to fail.

00:34:33.199 --> 00:34:35.199
And that is something
that a couple other people

00:34:35.199 --> 00:34:37.540
today have spoken about.

00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:41.350
What advice do you have
for when you do feel?

00:34:41.350 --> 00:34:46.600
How do you pick yourself back
up and regain your confidence

00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:50.139
after falling flat on your face?

00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:56.800
JULIA TIZARD: So
this one I always

00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:58.720
have a little bit of
a hard time answering.

00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:02.800
Because if you want my honest
just direct answer on that

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:05.690
is that you just do it.

00:35:05.690 --> 00:35:10.060
And I don't mean that to
belittle the situation at all.

00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:13.090
But a lot of the time people
struggle picking themselves

00:35:13.090 --> 00:35:15.550
up and continuing
on something is

00:35:15.550 --> 00:35:20.180
because we've created something
out of the act of failing.

00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:22.510
And so what I always
encourage people to do

00:35:22.510 --> 00:35:26.230
is we should be living lives
where failing and being

00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:29.170
successful have equal value.

00:35:29.170 --> 00:35:32.610
You learn something out of
any of those situations.

00:35:32.610 --> 00:35:35.170
And being able to
pick yourself up

00:35:35.170 --> 00:35:37.950
and turn those things
around, because you failed.

00:35:37.950 --> 00:35:40.300
Oh, I just failed.

00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:41.775
You know, that's great.

00:35:41.775 --> 00:35:42.400
I learned this.

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:43.120
Let's move on.

00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:49.630
It's a mindset that you
have to train yourself into.

00:35:49.630 --> 00:35:51.670
And it's hard.

00:35:51.670 --> 00:35:55.799
I've been there and lost
confidence a number of times

00:35:55.799 --> 00:35:58.090
almost to the point where I
just kind of got sick of it

00:35:58.090 --> 00:35:59.430
and just decided, you know what?

00:35:59.430 --> 00:36:01.360
I have to shut that
part of my brain

00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:03.880
off that tells me
to lose confidence.

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:06.820
And I literally just
have to take action

00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:10.150
to either go for what
you were going for again

00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:15.700
or change direction and
choose what the next thing is

00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:17.874
if you think you're not able.

00:36:17.874 --> 00:36:19.540
It's either a cut
off, or it's something

00:36:19.540 --> 00:36:20.870
you just need to try again.

00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:23.170
So whichever one of
those two things it is,

00:36:23.170 --> 00:36:29.050
I would really just focus on
the action of recommitting

00:36:29.050 --> 00:36:30.280
and doing it again.

00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:31.160
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
And I'll add to that.

00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:33.250
So I think one of the
things that my team knows

00:36:33.250 --> 00:36:35.320
is that vulnerability
is a strength.

00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:38.050
So for me if I
have a hard day, I

00:36:38.050 --> 00:36:40.114
can lose confidence
10 times in one day.

00:36:40.114 --> 00:36:41.530
I can go to 10
different meetings,

00:36:41.530 --> 00:36:42.760
get 10 different answers.

00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:44.760
I can be with so many
different kinds of people.

00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:46.450
Some will say yes,
some will say no.

00:36:46.450 --> 00:36:48.640
I'll try to negotiate.

00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:51.370
So some days I just
have a hard cry.

00:36:51.370 --> 00:36:55.330
I just go, and I get
in my comfy sweatpants.

00:36:55.330 --> 00:36:57.880
And I get a cup of tea,
I cuddle with my cat.

00:36:57.880 --> 00:36:59.352
And I just let it out.

00:36:59.352 --> 00:37:01.060
Because I think one
of the hardest things

00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:03.501
is when we feel like
we have to hold it.

00:37:03.501 --> 00:37:04.000
Right?

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.370
And it's OK to
just spill it out.

00:37:06.370 --> 00:37:08.950
It's OK to in your
lowest moments

00:37:08.950 --> 00:37:11.860
just like have a moment where
you're taking care of yourself.

00:37:11.860 --> 00:37:14.850
My team also knows I like
to take lots of baths.

00:37:14.850 --> 00:37:17.410
A member of my team got
me lots of bath bombs.

00:37:17.410 --> 00:37:19.060
Because that's one of my things.

00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:23.230
That's my taking care of myself.

00:37:23.230 --> 00:37:25.660
It's interesting when
you said the word fail,

00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:26.500
your hand went here.

00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:28.420
But I think a lot of times
failure is this lesson.

00:37:28.420 --> 00:37:29.230
JULIA TIZARD: Yeah.

00:37:29.230 --> 00:37:31.240
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Right?

00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:33.210
We get feedback a lot of Google.

00:37:33.210 --> 00:37:35.879
It's a practice of giving
and receiving feedback.

00:37:35.879 --> 00:37:38.170
And one of the things, too,
is you're getting feedback.

00:37:38.170 --> 00:37:39.480
And you're like, that's not me.

00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:40.090
That sucks.

00:37:40.090 --> 00:37:41.616
That's not what I
want to listen to.

00:37:41.616 --> 00:37:43.240
But I think one of
the strongest things

00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:46.390
that you can do in that moment
is just to say, thank you.

00:37:46.390 --> 00:37:49.700
It's this humbling moment where
you're like I see that lesson.

00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:51.759
And I'm going to
acknowledge that lesson.

00:37:51.759 --> 00:37:54.050
And I'm going to choose what
I want out of that lesson.

00:37:54.050 --> 00:37:55.690
And it's a very
empowering moment

00:37:55.690 --> 00:37:57.460
around failure or learning.

00:37:57.460 --> 00:37:59.650
And then from that, you
can go have a hard cry.

00:37:59.650 --> 00:38:00.730
You can drink some wine.

00:38:00.730 --> 00:38:03.670
Drink some tea, cuddle with the
cat or your animal of choice.

00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:06.440
And then you start
fresh the next day.

00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:08.320
And you don't have
to take what happened

00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:10.100
on Monday into Tuesday.

00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:11.660
You can just leave it on Monday.

00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:12.950
And you can start again.

00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:14.860
And so failure doesn't
have to be low.

00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:16.900
It doesn't have to
be something that you

00:38:16.900 --> 00:38:18.680
think no one else experiences.

00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:19.936
We all experience it.

00:38:19.936 --> 00:38:22.060
And I think that's a powerful
thing about community

00:38:22.060 --> 00:38:24.820
is when we share that
vulnerability with each other.

00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:27.500
So is there another mic
runner, another question?

00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:29.712
All right, over here.

00:38:29.712 --> 00:38:31.420
[INAUDIBLE] going to
have to work for it.

00:38:36.219 --> 00:38:36.760
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:38.800
I'm just curious,
especially when

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:45.100
you said that Virgin is very
friendly with its competitors,

00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:46.480
I was just thinking about that.

00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:48.430
How different are you
from your competitors?

00:38:48.430 --> 00:38:50.560
And suppose you get
scooped and somebody else

00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:52.300
becomes the dominant technology?

00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:55.180
How would Virgin adapt to that?

00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:57.220
JULIA TIZARD: So
my honest belief

00:38:57.220 --> 00:39:04.880
on that is that if a competitor
is funding another technology,

00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:06.970
and they come up with the
goods, and they make it,

00:39:06.970 --> 00:39:10.000
and they have a space
flight system that

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:13.330
is going to take people to
space with an experience

00:39:13.330 --> 00:39:15.610
that Virgin thinks
is worthwhile,

00:39:15.610 --> 00:39:21.280
they would absolutely
invest in it, especially

00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:23.530
if the route that we were
going was not working.

00:39:23.530 --> 00:39:26.020
I mean, hopefully, the
route that we're going

00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:27.940
does work and becomes
very profitable,

00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:32.050
and we have more money then
to go purchase the other types

00:39:32.050 --> 00:39:33.100
of experience items.

00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:35.830
And part of the reason
I say that, too,

00:39:35.830 --> 00:39:42.730
is that Virgin Galactic is an
unusual company for Virgin.

00:39:42.730 --> 00:39:47.120
Virgin typically doesn't get
into manufacturing anything,

00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:48.790
let alone space ships.

00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:53.980
But they're really operators
and the customer end,

00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:55.680
like with their
transport airlines,

00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:58.390
with their other
products that they sell.

00:39:58.390 --> 00:40:02.740
And really they're very customer
focused and experience-driven.

00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:07.420
And the reason we are building
and doing R&amp;D on spaceships

00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:09.250
right now is because
no one else is.

00:40:09.250 --> 00:40:11.590
And so if there were
other viable companies

00:40:11.590 --> 00:40:15.070
out there working
on other vehicles,

00:40:15.070 --> 00:40:16.930
and there are, and
they're successful,

00:40:16.930 --> 00:40:19.570
then I absolutely don't doubt
that Virgin will go look

00:40:19.570 --> 00:40:25.270
at them as a comparison
to our program

00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:29.890
to see if there's
compatibility, to see if there's

00:40:29.890 --> 00:40:33.270
strength one over the other.

00:40:33.270 --> 00:40:36.640
And I also think
that just in general

00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:40.360
the more people that are
successful doing things,

00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:42.760
especially when you're starting
with a nascent industry

00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:46.966
like human spaceflight and
public human spaceflight,

00:40:46.966 --> 00:40:48.340
the more people
that are doing it

00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:51.490
and the more people that are
out there successful, the more

00:40:51.490 --> 00:40:54.957
investment is going to come into
that business to iterate on it

00:40:54.957 --> 00:40:57.040
and to improve it and to
get it to a better place.

00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:58.900
And that is also
something that Virgin

00:40:58.900 --> 00:41:01.060
appreciates and understands.

00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:03.670
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: And if you
want help building a spaceship,

00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:05.870
I'll help you.

00:41:05.870 --> 00:41:06.370
I like that.

00:41:06.370 --> 00:41:08.920
I mean, maybe it can't be made
out of hand-rolled aluminum

00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:09.700
from Burning Man.

00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:13.690
But I think that when you get
a bunch of people building

00:41:13.690 --> 00:41:15.939
something with so
much passion, it

00:41:15.939 --> 00:41:17.230
becomes something really great.

00:41:17.230 --> 00:41:21.050
So if you wanted to create
a space startup, I got you.

00:41:21.050 --> 00:41:21.550
All right.

00:41:21.550 --> 00:41:23.560
Is there any other
questions in the room?

00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:27.000
We've got one all the
way over here, too.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:27.790
All right.

00:41:27.790 --> 00:41:29.107
In the front.

00:41:29.107 --> 00:41:30.940
AUDIENCE: So I just
want to know how safe it

00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:34.372
is to go to a space comparing
to other transportation systems?

00:41:34.372 --> 00:41:35.830
Because if I want
to go to a space,

00:41:35.830 --> 00:41:37.710
that would be my main concern.

00:41:37.710 --> 00:41:39.954
Thanks.

00:41:39.954 --> 00:41:42.120
JULIA TIZARD: So I can
answer that a couple of ways.

00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:44.950
And we are obviously
very focused on safety.

00:41:44.950 --> 00:41:48.550
We have no business case if we
can't bring people back safely

00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:49.184
from space.

00:41:49.184 --> 00:41:50.850
NATALIE VILLALOBOS:
That's a good point.

00:41:50.850 --> 00:41:52.660
JULIA TIZARD: That is
very, very important.

00:41:52.660 --> 00:41:53.610
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: You
can't leave them out there.

00:41:53.610 --> 00:41:54.940
JULIA TIZARD: Yeah.

00:41:54.940 --> 00:41:57.790
We also have no business
if we take no risk.

00:41:57.790 --> 00:42:02.380
And taking people to
space is a risky business.

00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:06.190
You There are your
typical known knowns,

00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:08.500
your known unknowns, and
your unknown unknowns, right?

00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:11.824
And in the space
arena, there is risk

00:42:11.824 --> 00:42:13.240
that you're taking
on any endeavor

00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:14.680
that you're doing there.

00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:16.930
So my advice for you
is that you should

00:42:16.930 --> 00:42:20.890
fly after several
people have flown.

00:42:20.890 --> 00:42:23.560
Because there'll be more
information available then.

00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:25.851
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: That
means that the first few space

00:42:25.851 --> 00:42:28.045
flights are still
going to be safe.

00:42:28.045 --> 00:42:30.196
JULIA TIZARD: But that's
really important, right?

00:42:30.196 --> 00:42:31.570
This is where I'm
talking about--

00:42:31.570 --> 00:42:33.970
and this is actually
my day-to-day job--

00:42:33.970 --> 00:42:36.130
balancing that risk.

00:42:36.130 --> 00:42:39.160
We have to fly the
vehicles to test

00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:42.460
them to understand whether
they meet the design that we've

00:42:42.460 --> 00:42:43.330
designed them for.

00:42:43.330 --> 00:42:45.640
So there is risk in
doing that, because we've

00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:47.920
designed a vehicle
that we think is safe.

00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:51.210
But until you really
fully test it,

00:42:51.210 --> 00:42:53.110
you can't verify that
it's met the design

00:42:53.110 --> 00:42:54.820
that you've designed it to.

00:42:54.820 --> 00:42:55.750
So there's risk.

00:42:55.750 --> 00:42:57.940
There's a larger risk in
us doing the test flight

00:42:57.940 --> 00:42:58.750
phase of it.

00:42:58.750 --> 00:43:01.314
Every piece of that test
flight that we go through

00:43:01.314 --> 00:43:03.730
and every envelope that we
expand as we're doing that test

00:43:03.730 --> 00:43:05.890
flight gives us
more data to make

00:43:05.890 --> 00:43:08.980
us feel more confident in
that system and to tweak it,

00:43:08.980 --> 00:43:13.300
to improve it, to push it to
a place where it's even safer.

00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:16.510
So literally the first
people, the first customers,

00:43:16.510 --> 00:43:18.490
that are going to
go in that vehicle,

00:43:18.490 --> 00:43:21.520
they will be taking a
greater level of risk

00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:24.670
than the people that
come five years later.

00:43:24.670 --> 00:43:27.130
Because it will have only
flown a limited number of time.

00:43:27.130 --> 00:43:30.430
And that's part of
why we can consider

00:43:30.430 --> 00:43:33.630
those customers our
pioneers, almost part

00:43:33.630 --> 00:43:34.630
founders in the company.

00:43:34.630 --> 00:43:36.910
Because they are not
only putting their money

00:43:36.910 --> 00:43:39.400
where their mouth is, but
they're also joining us

00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:42.880
on this endeavor
of trying to make

00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:46.510
spaceflight a reality for
everyone in this room.

00:43:46.510 --> 00:43:49.210
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: So
speaking of new endeavors,

00:43:49.210 --> 00:43:53.140
I wanted to take one last
question from the room.

00:43:53.140 --> 00:43:54.776
Can Finn join us?

00:43:59.646 --> 00:44:00.145
He's hiding.

00:44:06.052 --> 00:44:07.936
Thanks, Tony.

00:44:07.936 --> 00:44:12.340
So this is something Julie
and I were talking about,

00:44:12.340 --> 00:44:13.690
bringing Finn up on stage.

00:44:13.690 --> 00:44:14.340
Finn.

00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:17.442
JULIA TIZARD: So this is my
latest adventure, motherhood.

00:44:17.442 --> 00:44:18.400
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Hi.

00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:20.920
Yeah.

00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:22.830
We've all been flirting
with him all day.

00:44:22.830 --> 00:44:25.210
Hi.

00:44:25.210 --> 00:44:28.360
JULIA TIZARD: So this was
important to me to do.

00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:29.345
I'm a very new mother.

00:44:29.345 --> 00:44:30.970
I actually have a
two-year-old as well,

00:44:30.970 --> 00:44:34.031
but I'm still a new mother.

00:44:34.031 --> 00:44:35.530
I was never one of
those people that

00:44:35.530 --> 00:44:37.613
was even really sure I was
going to have children.

00:44:37.613 --> 00:44:42.370
And they are the most
humbling things in the world.

00:44:42.370 --> 00:44:48.760
But also, they teach you a
lot and inspire you greatly.

00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:51.380
And I just wanted to kind
of put that out there.

00:44:51.380 --> 00:44:53.964
A lot of people have
talked about a lot

00:44:53.964 --> 00:44:56.380
of the great women that have
been up here today have kids.

00:44:56.380 --> 00:44:59.860
And being a new mom, I am in
awe of every single one of them.

00:44:59.860 --> 00:45:03.610
Because it is hard to balance
family life and a work life.

00:45:03.610 --> 00:45:05.790
But it is also totally doable.

00:45:05.790 --> 00:45:08.361
And Finn here is
evidence of that.

00:45:08.361 --> 00:45:09.360
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: Yay.

00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:10.110
JULIA TIZARD: Yay.

00:45:10.110 --> 00:45:14.392
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:14.392 --> 00:45:16.350
NATALIE VILLALOBOS: I
kind of want to just keep

00:45:16.350 --> 00:45:18.570
doing this to make him smile.

00:45:18.570 --> 00:45:19.560
Yeah.

00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:21.960
Thanks for joining us, Finn.

00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:27.570
So with that, we still have
another great talk coming up.

00:45:27.570 --> 00:45:28.380
Yeah.

00:45:28.380 --> 00:45:30.920
It could be you
if you wanted to.

00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:34.350
But I want to thank you all
for sharing your questions.

00:45:34.350 --> 00:45:38.100
And thank you to Julia and
to Finn for joining us,

00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:40.530
for flying out from LA to join
us from the Virgin Galactic

00:45:40.530 --> 00:45:41.100
team.

00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:42.410
JULIA TIZARD: I'm
privileged to be here today.

00:45:42.410 --> 00:45:42.909
Thank you.

00:45:42.909 --> 00:45:44.910
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:44.910 --> 00:45:49.460
