00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:03.173
- Oh.
- Ooh!

00:00:04.053 --> 00:00:04.886
- Oh! Ha!

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:07.373
In your face.

00:00:07.373 --> 00:00:08.640
In your face!

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.190
- This is not my game, guys.

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:11.860
- At least you finally came over.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:13.950
- By the way, the house is amazing.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:14.813
And it's so you.

00:00:14.813 --> 00:00:17.261
- Thank you, it is so me.

00:00:17.261 --> 00:00:18.520
- Mind if I get another?

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.050
- Of course, let me show you the way.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:21.270
- You guys need anything?

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.220
- Oh, they don't need anything.

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.709
Actually, if they speak, I'll murder them.

00:00:23.709 --> 00:00:25.870
(laughter)

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:28.079
Okay, right this way, sir.

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:28.912
- Nice.

00:00:28.912 --> 00:00:29.745
- Let's see.

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:32.910
Oh, they've got everything.

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.363
- Who's they?

00:00:34.363 --> 00:00:35.280
- Uh, they?

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.400
- You just said, "They've got everything."

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.420
- I said, "We've got everything."

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.263
Like, we are at a party, we
are hungry, we want snacks.

00:00:43.263 --> 00:00:44.096
Let's get snacks.

00:00:44.096 --> 00:00:46.513
(clattering)

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.386
- Did you just move in?

00:00:53.386 --> 00:00:54.846
- Huh-uh.

00:00:54.846 --> 00:00:55.679
- Do you want some help?

00:00:55.679 --> 00:00:56.512
- Nope!

00:00:56.512 --> 00:00:58.040
I'm good, Josh.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.394
- I'm gonna hit the john,
maybe, how 'bout that?

00:00:59.394 --> 00:01:00.840
- Okay, great.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:01.673
It's that way.

00:01:03.081 --> 00:01:05.907
It's that way, it's that way.

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:14.646
(sinister violins swell)

00:01:17.066 --> 00:01:19.733
(ominous music)

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:28.983
- This isn't the bathroom, Josh.

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:34.780
- Is this your house?

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.321
- Of course it is!

00:01:36.321 --> 00:01:38.821
(phone rings)

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:44.650
- [Blake Lively] Hey,
you've reached the Reynolds.

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:46.020
We're away for the next month,

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.780
and our house is entirely locked up.

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.400
No one's there and no one's
checking voicemails or anything.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.432
So, sorry if it takes us a
while to get back to you.

00:01:52.432 --> 00:01:53.793
Take care, buh-bye!

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.903
(voicemail beep)

00:01:55.903 --> 00:01:56.916
- I can explain.

00:01:56.916 --> 00:01:57.749
- I don't believe you.

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:59.440
- I haven't even said anything yet, Josh!

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.630
God, what do you think?

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.460
You think I tied up Blake and Ryan,

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.560
and like, what, just threw
them in their own closet?

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:06.940
- I didn't, until you just said that.

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:07.830
What did you do to them?

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:08.700
Are they okay?

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.380
- Josh, big movie stars loan each other

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.352
their houses all the time.

00:02:12.352 --> 00:02:13.835
(muffled voices and thumping against door)

00:02:13.835 --> 00:02:14.943
- What was that?

00:02:14.943 --> 00:02:16.290
- That was Alexa.

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.123
Alexa?

00:02:17.123 --> 00:02:18.500
Please shut the fuck up!

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:19.333
- Nope, nope, nope.

00:02:19.333 --> 00:02:20.166
I'm outta here.
- Josh!

00:02:20.166 --> 00:02:21.350
No, Josh, no, come on.

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:22.880
I can explain.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:23.713
Something.

00:02:23.713 --> 00:02:24.714
God!

00:02:24.714 --> 00:02:26.301
(sigh)

00:02:26.301 --> 00:02:29.226
(thumping and muffled sounds)

00:02:29.226 --> 00:02:30.410
Can you just be quiet, please?

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:31.243
I'm thinking.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.430
And like, the next time that
I bake cookies for the crew,

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.440
don't bake better cookies
for them the next day.

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.329
We wouldn't even be in this situation.

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:41.870
(jazzy elevator music)
