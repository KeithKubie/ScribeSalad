00:00:00.019 --> 00:00:01.951
(Water splashes)

00:00:01.951 --> 00:00:03.294
(Footsteps crunching)

00:00:03.294 --> 00:00:04.768
- Good morning, I hope
you're having an amazing day,

00:00:04.768 --> 00:00:05.729
it's Mark Wiens.

00:00:05.729 --> 00:00:08.165
I'm in Batticaloa, on the
east coast of Sri Lanka.

00:00:08.165 --> 00:00:12.067
This is a beautiful city, it's
so quiet, it's so peaceful.

00:00:12.067 --> 00:00:13.684
It's known for it's lagoons,

00:00:13.684 --> 00:00:16.816
and for lunch, we have been
invited to the Sri Lankan

00:00:16.816 --> 00:00:17.649
army camp.

00:00:17.649 --> 00:00:19.381
So we're gonna be eating and experience

00:00:19.381 --> 00:00:22.711
Sri Lankan army mess hall food,

00:00:22.711 --> 00:00:25.575
which is gonna be a totally
new experience for me.

00:00:25.575 --> 00:00:27.445
Then after that, we're gonna
go straight to someone's home,

00:00:27.445 --> 00:00:29.610
who's gonna cook us some
fresh lagoon seafood.

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.383
I think some crab, some
fish, that's gonna be

00:00:32.383 --> 00:00:34.178
seafood from the lagoon.

00:00:34.178 --> 00:00:35.821
We're getting started
right now, and I can't wait

00:00:35.821 --> 00:00:37.853
to share all the food
with you in this video.

00:00:37.853 --> 00:00:40.436
(upbeat music)

00:00:48.183 --> 00:00:52.136
(footsteps crunching)

00:00:52.136 --> 00:00:52.969
- Good morning Ruzaina.

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:54.864
- Good morning! (laughs)

00:00:54.864 --> 00:00:57.585
- We're getting started, but
a slight, slight complication

00:00:57.585 --> 00:00:58.926
before we....

00:00:58.926 --> 00:01:00.215
We head out.

00:01:00.215 --> 00:01:04.965
(engine revs)

00:01:09.685 --> 00:01:13.435
(speaks in foreign language)

00:01:17.234 --> 00:01:20.001
- We are on our way, we
are taking the rescue van.

00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:21.849
(laughter)

00:01:21.849 --> 00:01:23.530
(footsteps on crunching)

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.118
(waves crashing on shore)

00:01:25.118 --> 00:01:26.644
(speaking in foreign language)

00:01:26.644 --> 00:01:28.166
- [Mark] As we're driving into the city,

00:01:28.166 --> 00:01:29.441
we just stopped along the beach,

00:01:29.441 --> 00:01:31.509
because there's a crowd of fishermen

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:32.626
who are pulling in the nets.

00:01:32.626 --> 00:01:35.245
They just pulled in a
net, the net is full.

00:01:35.245 --> 00:01:38.075
They're like little ... anchovies?

00:01:38.075 --> 00:01:39.165
Like anchovies, yeah?

00:01:39.165 --> 00:01:39.998
- [Ruzaina] Yeah.

00:01:39.998 --> 00:01:42.665
- [Mark] Little, small fish,
but the waves are crashing.

00:01:42.665 --> 00:01:44.950
It takes like, ten men to pull in the net

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.169
cause it's so full.

00:01:46.169 --> 00:01:48.114
They're so fresh, they're just sparkling,

00:01:48.114 --> 00:01:49.858
shimmering in that sunlight.

00:01:49.858 --> 00:01:51.773
This is a beautiful, beautiful setting.

00:01:51.773 --> 00:01:53.944
It's so clean, it's so fresh.

00:01:53.944 --> 00:01:57.361
(waves crashing)

00:02:03.482 --> 00:02:04.818
- [Mark] And then they go into the sea

00:02:04.818 --> 00:02:07.470
to wash off the fish,
making sure they don't

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.879
lose their balance on those waves.

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:12.357
(waves crashing)

00:02:12.357 --> 00:02:13.790
(footsteps crunching)

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.226
- Back in the van, we're on our way.

00:02:15.226 --> 00:02:17.763
(car engine roars)

00:02:17.763 --> 00:02:22.763
(upbeat music)

00:02:24.891 --> 00:02:28.974
(chopping)

00:02:30.333 --> 00:02:33.300
- [Mark] We are on the Sri
Lankan special forces base.

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.456
In the kitchen now, of the mess hall.

00:02:35.456 --> 00:02:37.127
This is where they do the cooking.

00:02:37.127 --> 00:02:40.547
This is where they're
cooking for the entire camp.

00:02:40.547 --> 00:02:43.350
(pot lid banging)

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:47.267
(speaking in foreign language)

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:52.986
(pot lid banging)

00:02:52.986 --> 00:02:54.499
- [Mark] Over on this side of the kitchen,

00:02:54.499 --> 00:02:57.705
they are making rice in
a huge pan, Over fire.

00:02:57.705 --> 00:02:59.578
It's steaming away, that steam just

00:02:59.578 --> 00:03:01.247
puffed out of there.

00:03:01.247 --> 00:03:02.923
They're burning both
a combination of wood,

00:03:02.923 --> 00:03:04.848
as well as dry coconut husk.

00:03:04.848 --> 00:03:06.601
(crunching)

00:03:06.601 --> 00:03:09.955
(bubbling)

00:03:09.955 --> 00:03:14.872
(chopping)

00:03:17.335 --> 00:03:20.990
- Okay, hopefully that
chair doesn't collapse

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:22.436
in. under my weight.

00:03:22.436 --> 00:03:25.293
Okay. But as they are
cooking, as they're preparing

00:03:25.293 --> 00:03:27.987
this meal for the mess
hall, for the entire unit,

00:03:27.987 --> 00:03:30.795
I just wanna quickly
explain a little bit about

00:03:30.795 --> 00:03:31.637
what's going on.

00:03:31.637 --> 00:03:35.934
We have been invited to the
Sri Lankan Special Forces unit.

00:03:35.934 --> 00:03:39.386
The Sri Lankan Forces played a huge role

00:03:39.386 --> 00:03:40.219
in Sri Lanka.

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:42.105
They're very well respected.

00:03:42.105 --> 00:03:44.227
And just a background of Sri Lanka.

00:03:44.227 --> 00:03:46.826
It's been through times of war,

00:03:46.826 --> 00:03:51.614
it suffered from many
natural disasters, tsunamis.

00:03:51.614 --> 00:03:53.481
Then the Special Forces
were actually created

00:03:53.481 --> 00:03:55.089
during the war.

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:57.116
And they helped create peace.

00:03:57.116 --> 00:03:59.697
And then in times of natural
disaster, like the tsunamis,

00:03:59.697 --> 00:04:03.200
they've been there to help,
to help Sri Lanka recover,

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.331
to rebuild the roads, the bridges.

00:04:06.331 --> 00:04:10.185
They've been in charge of
some of the biggest, like,

00:04:10.185 --> 00:04:13.275
some of the hardest projects in Sri Lanka.

00:04:13.275 --> 00:04:17.281
This unit of the Sri Lankan Special Forces

00:04:17.281 --> 00:04:18.347
has been in charge.

00:04:18.347 --> 00:04:20.878
We're not gonna be able to
see the entire compound,

00:04:20.878 --> 00:04:23.604
but they have allowed us, graciously,

00:04:23.604 --> 00:04:25.197
to come into the kitchen
to watch a little bit

00:04:25.197 --> 00:04:26.947
of the cooking and then to eat

00:04:26.947 --> 00:04:28.580
Sri Lankan Special Forces food.

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.988
All of the chefs, everyone
cooking, they're all officers

00:04:32.988 --> 00:04:35.207
of the Special Forces.

00:04:35.207 --> 00:04:37.786
And they're all working
together, each handling a task

00:04:37.786 --> 00:04:38.619
in the kitchen.

00:04:38.619 --> 00:04:41.481
(oil sizzling)

00:04:41.481 --> 00:04:42.440
- [Mark] He just heated up some oil

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:43.986
and dropped in some lagoon fish

00:04:43.986 --> 00:04:45.944
that's also gonna be
for lunch. Gonna try it.

00:04:45.944 --> 00:04:47.817
Looks like it's marinated in a mixture.

00:04:47.817 --> 00:04:49.102
Looks like some turmeric, maybe some

00:04:49.102 --> 00:04:50.459
curry powder on there already.

00:04:50.459 --> 00:04:55.459
(pounding)

00:04:56.309 --> 00:04:59.142
(chopping)

00:05:01.065 --> 00:05:04.942
I'm just hanging out, as they're
still frying the fish, ...

00:05:04.942 --> 00:05:06.491
having a cup of tea.

00:05:06.491 --> 00:05:10.444
And then they're also still
chopping up tons of vegetables.

00:05:10.444 --> 00:05:12.931
And the officer is also
helping us to arrange

00:05:12.931 --> 00:05:15.356
a fish for the next meal.

00:05:15.356 --> 00:05:17.787
So we're talking on the
phone and we're trying

00:05:17.787 --> 00:05:18.724
to organize a fish.

00:05:18.724 --> 00:05:20.206
Not sure if it's gonna be a lagoon fish,

00:05:20.206 --> 00:05:21.879
which would be a brackish water fish,

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:25.018
salt and freshwater, or
a straight ocean fish.

00:05:25.018 --> 00:05:29.435
But yeah, there's lots of
amazing fish in Batticaloa.

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:35.410
(car lock beeps)

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.340
- [Mark] You know how some days,

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.055
everything goes according to plan,

00:05:42.055 --> 00:05:44.834
but other days, you just kinda, like,

00:05:44.834 --> 00:05:47.440
things don't work out
quite as you thought they

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.379
were gonna work out, but
it's still an amazing

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:51.342
adventure in the process?

00:05:51.342 --> 00:05:52.835
Today is one of those days.

00:05:52.835 --> 00:05:57.835
(upbeat music)

00:06:06.744 --> 00:06:10.661
(speaking in foreign language)

00:06:11.742 --> 00:06:13.149
- Hello, hello.

00:06:13.149 --> 00:06:14.030
- Hi, hello.

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:15.588
- [Mark] How are you? How are you?

00:06:15.588 --> 00:06:16.522
(speaking in foreign language)

00:06:16.522 --> 00:06:17.721
- [Mark] What's up, man?

00:06:17.721 --> 00:06:21.638
(speaking in foreign language)

00:06:25.017 --> 00:06:26.108
- [Mark] Thank you, thank you very much.

00:06:26.108 --> 00:06:27.859
Nice to meet you.

00:06:27.859 --> 00:06:28.749
(laughter)

00:06:28.749 --> 00:06:30.696
- Okay, so we took a little drive.

00:06:30.696 --> 00:06:31.719
- Sri Lanka.

00:06:31.719 --> 00:06:32.552
(laughs)

00:06:32.552 --> 00:06:33.552
- Sri Lanka.

00:06:34.488 --> 00:06:36.106
One of the, one of the
officers, this is like a-

00:06:36.106 --> 00:06:37.092
- I want to this see, ah.

00:06:37.092 --> 00:06:38.274
- Are you the fisherman?

00:06:38.274 --> 00:06:39.140
- No, no, no, no.

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:39.973
- [Mark] Okay.

00:06:39.973 --> 00:06:40.806
- I am a ...

00:06:40.806 --> 00:06:42.856
(speaks foreign language)

00:06:42.856 --> 00:06:44.342
- Oh god, it's a huge.

00:06:44.342 --> 00:06:47.842
(speaks foreign language)

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:50.523
- [Mark] Nine kilo?

00:06:50.523 --> 00:06:51.356
- [Man] Nine kilo.

00:06:51.356 --> 00:06:52.189
- Omega three, yeah?

00:06:52.189 --> 00:06:53.022
- [Mark] Omega three?

00:06:53.022 --> 00:06:53.855
- Yeah

00:06:53.855 --> 00:06:57.610
- As we were at the
Special Forces unit base,

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:01.825
the officer called one
of his, like, fishermen,

00:07:01.825 --> 00:07:04.418
and they had a special catch for the day,

00:07:04.418 --> 00:07:07.515
which he said was the number one fish.

00:07:07.515 --> 00:07:09.136
He said it was his favorite fish.

00:07:09.136 --> 00:07:11.447
And so, plans sort of changed.

00:07:11.447 --> 00:07:14.539
We ended up in a complete
random adventure.

00:07:14.539 --> 00:07:15.761
And-

00:07:15.761 --> 00:07:19.011
(rickshaw engine revs)

00:07:21.201 --> 00:07:25.108
- Vehicle shift, and another
slight change of plans.

00:07:25.108 --> 00:07:26.893
The van is heading back to the hotel

00:07:26.893 --> 00:07:28.317
to pull out the van again.

00:07:28.317 --> 00:07:30.639
Still sorting out that situation,

00:07:30.639 --> 00:07:32.245
but we are in a rickshaw,

00:07:32.245 --> 00:07:34.041
we're heading back to base camp,

00:07:34.041 --> 00:07:35.710
where we are gonna cook.

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:38.293
(upbeat music)

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:42.037
- [Mark] One of the beautiful
things about this region of

00:07:42.037 --> 00:07:45.071
Sri Lanka are the lagoons.

00:07:45.071 --> 00:07:47.979
Which are, just, you feel
like you're on a series of

00:07:47.979 --> 00:07:50.143
islands, because you
just keep hopping from

00:07:50.143 --> 00:07:53.494
over lagoons and onto
little pieces of land

00:07:53.494 --> 00:07:56.063
that are carved out by lagoons.

00:07:56.063 --> 00:07:58.542
(upbeat music)

00:07:58.542 --> 00:08:01.104
(beeping)

00:08:01.104 --> 00:08:03.687
(upbeat music)

00:08:04.895 --> 00:08:05.728
- [Mark] Ahh, okay.

00:08:05.728 --> 00:08:07.007
- Mora, singularly, we call mora.

00:08:07.007 --> 00:08:07.840
- Mora?

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:08.673
- Yes.

00:08:08.673 --> 00:08:09.722
- Mora.

00:08:09.722 --> 00:08:10.555
- [Mark] You like to eat?

00:08:10.555 --> 00:08:12.261
- Oh, yeah, why not,
why not? All the time.

00:08:12.261 --> 00:08:13.094
(laughter)

00:08:13.094 --> 00:08:14.671
- Not only me, but all the people.

00:08:14.671 --> 00:08:15.504
- Okay.

00:08:15.504 --> 00:08:17.144
- [Mark] Shark is quite
common in Sri Lanka,

00:08:17.144 --> 00:08:18.360
and throughout Asia.

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:21.072
But one of the thing that
it's just worth noting,

00:08:21.072 --> 00:08:23.657
that the entire shark
is going to be consumed.

00:08:23.657 --> 00:08:26.204
Not just a piece of it,
not just a part of it,

00:08:26.204 --> 00:08:29.909
but the entire, the entirety of the shark.

00:08:29.909 --> 00:08:32.238
(water splashing)

00:08:32.238 --> 00:08:33.081
(cracking)

00:08:33.081 --> 00:08:36.710
(water splashing)

00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:41.710
(machine whirring loudly)

00:08:44.170 --> 00:08:45.236
- [Mark] They're gonna make curry shark,

00:08:45.236 --> 00:08:47.907
so he just cracked open about 10 coconuts.

00:08:47.907 --> 00:08:49.641
But then they have their own grinder.

00:08:49.641 --> 00:08:50.863
That's the importance.

00:08:50.863 --> 00:08:53.475
That's how prevalent coconut milk

00:08:53.475 --> 00:08:56.764
and shredded coconut
are in Sri Lankan food.

00:08:56.764 --> 00:09:00.431
(knife slicing across wood)

00:09:03.746 --> 00:09:04.998
(crinkling)

00:09:04.998 --> 00:09:06.588
- [Mark] And they're preparing
all the other ingredients

00:09:06.588 --> 00:09:07.421
for the curry.

00:09:07.421 --> 00:09:08.254
(rapid chopping)

00:09:08.254 --> 00:09:09.754
- Oh, two different types of tomato.

00:09:09.754 --> 00:09:10.587
Oh yeah.

00:09:10.587 --> 00:09:12.837
(chopping)

00:09:14.549 --> 00:09:18.287
(slow soft pounding)

00:09:18.287 --> 00:09:21.088
(speaking in foreign language)

00:09:21.088 --> 00:09:22.534
- [Mark] Thank you.

00:09:22.534 --> 00:09:25.490
(Water splashing)

00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:26.999
- [Mark] I love how they're not taking

00:09:26.999 --> 00:09:30.063
any shortcuts, even for 50 people,

00:09:30.063 --> 00:09:33.450
freshly squeezed, handmade coconut milk.

00:09:33.450 --> 00:09:35.261
And that's gonna go into the curry.

00:09:35.261 --> 00:09:38.094
(water splashing)

00:09:40.531 --> 00:09:44.698
(chopping)

00:09:45.894 --> 00:09:47.590
(pounding)

00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:49.592
- [Mark] Sri Lanka has some
of the world's best cinnamon,

00:09:49.592 --> 00:09:51.833
and I love what they do,
they take the cinnamon bark

00:09:51.833 --> 00:09:53.380
and just pound it fresh, so you release,

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:55.069
you can smell that aroma just released.

00:09:55.069 --> 00:09:57.574
He's taking it out of
the mortar right now,

00:09:57.574 --> 00:09:59.346
onto the spice pile.

00:09:59.346 --> 00:10:02.191
The cinnamon, the curry leaves,
the chilies, the onions,

00:10:02.191 --> 00:10:03.337
the garlic.

00:10:03.337 --> 00:10:04.170
Oh, yeah.

00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:06.705
And I love how he just, like,

00:10:06.705 --> 00:10:07.832
doesn't skin the garlic.

00:10:07.832 --> 00:10:11.302
Keeps the skin on, just
hacks the entire thing up.

00:10:11.302 --> 00:10:13.552
(thudding)

00:10:14.566 --> 00:10:19.566
(scrapping)

00:10:21.196 --> 00:10:23.892
- [Mark] He just dumped
in all of that spices

00:10:23.892 --> 00:10:28.283
and all those onions and
tomatoes that he chopped up.

00:10:28.283 --> 00:10:32.068
And so it's like, mixed
before the fire is even on.

00:10:32.068 --> 00:10:34.066
(upbeat music)

00:10:34.066 --> 00:10:36.899
(water splashing)

00:10:39.677 --> 00:10:41.927
(swishing)

00:10:44.044 --> 00:10:46.007
- [Mark] Then he added in,
actually there's a first batch

00:10:46.007 --> 00:10:48.097
of coconut milk, which is
the thick coconut cream,

00:10:48.097 --> 00:10:50.011
but he first added in
like the coconut milk,

00:10:50.011 --> 00:10:51.619
which is less, it's more watery.

00:10:51.619 --> 00:10:53.209
And I've just been talking to them,

00:10:53.209 --> 00:10:54.042
they said that this fish...

00:10:54.042 --> 00:10:57.875
Oh, this move is the
best; this stirring move.

00:10:59.172 --> 00:11:03.184
It's called the pot, the pot swirl.

00:11:03.184 --> 00:11:04.214
No, I just made that up.

00:11:04.214 --> 00:11:05.518
Just talking about the shark meat,

00:11:05.518 --> 00:11:08.482
and in Sri Lanka, it's
also very common to eat,

00:11:08.482 --> 00:11:11.873
especially when you're a
mother, when you are expecting,

00:11:11.873 --> 00:11:13.929
or when you're nursing,
because of the nutrients,

00:11:13.929 --> 00:11:17.025
because of the, they say it's
very high in omega threes.

00:11:17.025 --> 00:11:19.439
(speaking in foreign language)

00:11:19.439 --> 00:11:21.514
(sizzling)

00:11:21.514 --> 00:11:23.696
(metal clanking)

00:11:23.696 --> 00:11:26.120
It is smelling so good right now.

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:28.494
You really smell the curry leaves,

00:11:28.494 --> 00:11:30.864
you smell the, he added in
a lot of turmeric in there,

00:11:30.864 --> 00:11:32.030
the fresh chilies.

00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:36.863
(upbeat music)

00:11:39.668 --> 00:11:42.085
(loud thuds)

00:11:43.604 --> 00:11:46.850
(water splashing)

00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:49.100
(swishing)

00:11:54.631 --> 00:11:56.470
- [Mark] He just added
in the coconut cream,

00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:58.307
the thicker coconut, the first squeeze,

00:11:58.307 --> 00:11:59.568
so that's gonna be richer.

00:11:59.568 --> 00:12:01.078
It means they must be getting close.

00:12:01.078 --> 00:12:03.145
(upbeat music)

00:12:03.145 --> 00:12:05.978
(water splashing)

00:12:10.949 --> 00:12:11.782
- [Mark] Let's eat.

00:12:11.782 --> 00:12:12.820
(laughter)

00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:14.757
- [Mark] Let's eat.

00:12:14.757 --> 00:12:19.757
(upbeat music)

00:12:25.608 --> 00:12:26.717
- [Mark] And we're gonna move over because

00:12:26.717 --> 00:12:29.362
we've been invited to eat
over with the officers.

00:12:29.362 --> 00:12:30.195
- Sorry?

00:12:30.195 --> 00:12:31.788
- We are gonna go to
the other house to eat?

00:12:31.788 --> 00:12:32.621
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:12:32.621 --> 00:12:33.606
- Okay.

00:12:33.606 --> 00:12:34.439
(child exclaims)

00:12:34.439 --> 00:12:38.037
- [Mark] Oh, nice. Okay.
I have good light in here.

00:12:38.037 --> 00:12:39.839
(thud)

00:12:39.839 --> 00:12:40.874
- [Mark] We are now sitting down to eat,

00:12:40.874 --> 00:12:42.707
all the food is ready, all
the food that they prepared.

00:12:42.707 --> 00:12:44.421
The rice, which they fried actually,

00:12:44.421 --> 00:12:47.534
then there's a bunch of
... there's a shrimp curry,

00:12:47.534 --> 00:12:49.038
there's dal, there's,
oh, that one is the fish.

00:12:49.038 --> 00:12:50.320
- [Woman] Fish fry.

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:51.483
- [Mark] Oh, fish fry there.

00:12:51.483 --> 00:12:53.142
- [Mark] So this was all
the normal food that they

00:12:53.142 --> 00:12:53.975
ate, right?

00:12:53.975 --> 00:12:54.808
- [Mark] And then this is the extra.

00:12:54.808 --> 00:12:56.173
(child whimpers)

00:12:56.173 --> 00:12:58.644
(upbeat music)

00:12:58.644 --> 00:13:03.601
(child babbling)

00:13:03.601 --> 00:13:05.093
(coughing)

00:13:05.093 --> 00:13:08.209
- [Mark] Quick wash. Wash of the hands.

00:13:08.209 --> 00:13:10.193
(water splashing)

00:13:10.193 --> 00:13:13.330
Ah, and unlike any other Sri Lankan food

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:15.005
so far that I've had.

00:13:15.005 --> 00:13:16.041
Oh, I've gotta try some of that.

00:13:16.041 --> 00:13:18.403
Oh, the shark feels so incredibly tender.

00:13:18.403 --> 00:13:20.436
Okay, I'm gonna add on
a little more gravy.

00:13:20.436 --> 00:13:22.995
But wow, the shark.
That's like a shark steak.

00:13:22.995 --> 00:13:26.576
Look at, oh, that just
completely almost disintegrates,

00:13:26.576 --> 00:13:28.009
it's so soft.

00:13:28.009 --> 00:13:29.759
Mix it with the rice.

00:13:31.734 --> 00:13:33.817
(laughs)

00:13:35.881 --> 00:13:38.466
Oh, wow. The shark is amazing.

00:13:38.466 --> 00:13:40.388
(laughing)

00:13:40.388 --> 00:13:43.959
- It's like, it's so incredibly tender.

00:13:43.959 --> 00:13:46.435
It's almost like, and
it's like, chicken breast,

00:13:46.435 --> 00:13:48.268
in its like, leanness.

00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:52.295
But so ... that curry is amazing too.

00:13:52.295 --> 00:13:53.588
A little bit spicy, you can taste the

00:13:53.588 --> 00:13:54.421
coconut cream in there.

00:13:54.421 --> 00:13:55.874
All of the dishes would be typical.

00:13:55.874 --> 00:13:59.105
It's what everybody ate today,
for lunch, in the mess hall,

00:13:59.105 --> 00:14:01.918
except for the extra special dish.

00:14:01.918 --> 00:14:02.846
I'm gonna try some of the shrimp.

00:14:02.846 --> 00:14:04.545
You can see there's Moringa
leaves in it, I believe.

00:14:04.545 --> 00:14:06.398
And you can see it, it's
like totally different,

00:14:06.398 --> 00:14:08.648
it's like full of greenery.

00:14:11.113 --> 00:14:11.946
Oh, wow.

00:14:13.308 --> 00:14:14.951
Yeah, that is stunning.

00:14:14.951 --> 00:14:16.368
It's like, mmmmm.

00:14:18.142 --> 00:14:20.020
You taste the Moringa
leaves, you taste like a

00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:21.214
bitterness in it.

00:14:21.214 --> 00:14:23.333
And then, I like how it's kinda watery,

00:14:23.333 --> 00:14:25.685
and not like rich, but very spicious.

00:14:25.685 --> 00:14:27.440
This one was a fried lagoon fish,

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:30.621
which then cooked in onions
and more curry leaves

00:14:30.621 --> 00:14:32.038
and fried it now.

00:14:34.313 --> 00:14:35.813
How is the food?

00:14:35.813 --> 00:14:36.646
- Nice.

00:14:36.646 --> 00:14:39.229
(upbeat music)

00:14:42.898 --> 00:14:45.929
- Everything is so superbly spiced, like,

00:14:45.929 --> 00:14:49.394
even the dal, even the potatoes.

00:14:49.394 --> 00:14:50.227
Mmmm.

00:14:51.337 --> 00:14:54.223
It's all like, yeah, vibrant,

00:14:54.223 --> 00:14:56.543
a beautiful mixture of spices,

00:14:56.543 --> 00:14:57.891
it's amazing food.

00:14:57.891 --> 00:15:01.490
- I'm shocked at the
shark. It's so tender.

00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:02.323
- [Mark] It's so tender!

00:15:02.323 --> 00:15:04.812
- Yeah, it's like,
super soft. Dreamy soft.

00:15:04.812 --> 00:15:05.817
- [Mark] Way, way more tender.

00:15:05.817 --> 00:15:07.243
It's like chicken breast
in (mumbles) but like...

00:15:07.243 --> 00:15:08.076
- I know, I know.

00:15:08.076 --> 00:15:09.451
- [Mark] absorbed in all that flavor.

00:15:09.451 --> 00:15:10.780
- And it's so tasty, right?

00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:11.613
- [Mark] Potatoes.

00:15:11.613 --> 00:15:13.921
(upbeat music )

00:15:13.921 --> 00:15:16.556
- [Mark] Those potatoes are
incredible, they're so creamy.

00:15:16.556 --> 00:15:20.270
And again, like the curry
leaves, the chili. Wow.

00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:22.937
(upbeat music)

00:15:26.688 --> 00:15:28.389
Mmmm. Mmmm.

00:15:28.389 --> 00:15:31.351
- [Mark] Too good to resist.

00:15:31.351 --> 00:15:34.601
Alright. Gotta mix up everything again.

00:15:39.087 --> 00:15:40.087
What a meal.

00:15:41.525 --> 00:15:44.092
(Car engine softly roars)

00:15:44.092 --> 00:15:46.341
- [Mark] It's getting very late very fast,

00:15:46.341 --> 00:15:48.717
but we have one more
meal that was actually

00:15:48.717 --> 00:15:51.526
scheduled earlier, but then,
the adventure took place,

00:15:51.526 --> 00:15:54.297
so we're on our way there
now, to eat another meal.

00:15:54.297 --> 00:15:58.244
And this is gonna be really
local, especially Batticaloa...

00:15:58.244 --> 00:16:00.566
regional specialty dishes.

00:16:00.566 --> 00:16:03.149
(upbeat music)

00:16:09.627 --> 00:16:12.339
(high pitched ringing)

00:16:12.339 --> 00:16:13.409
- [Mark] This is where
we're gonna have our

00:16:13.409 --> 00:16:14.267
second meal.

00:16:14.267 --> 00:16:16.444
This is where the aunties have prepared us

00:16:16.444 --> 00:16:20.409
a very local Batticaloa meal.

00:16:20.409 --> 00:16:24.028
(speaks in foreign language)

00:16:24.028 --> 00:16:25.473
- [Mark] Oh, awesome.

00:16:25.473 --> 00:16:27.484
(speaking in foreign language)

00:16:27.484 --> 00:16:29.345
(laughing)

00:16:29.345 --> 00:16:30.611
- [Mark] I think she's already prepared

00:16:30.611 --> 00:16:32.722
because we got here so
late, she's already prepared

00:16:32.722 --> 00:16:34.465
some of the curries, some of the dishes,

00:16:34.465 --> 00:16:36.701
but she's gonna make
for us string hoppers,

00:16:36.701 --> 00:16:39.669
which are like the noodle,
rice noodle curl ups.

00:16:39.669 --> 00:16:43.694
And to with the curries, cause
that's especially common,

00:16:43.694 --> 00:16:47.113
and especially in the morning,
and at night for dinner.

00:16:47.113 --> 00:16:49.692
- [Ruzaina] So, this is
something from this area.

00:16:49.692 --> 00:16:50.525
- [Woman] Yeah, some coconut. Coconut-

00:16:50.525 --> 00:16:51.854
- [Mark] Coconut milk?

00:16:51.854 --> 00:16:52.999
(speaking in foreign language)

00:16:52.999 --> 00:16:55.506
- [Mark] There's like half a dozen dishes.

00:16:55.506 --> 00:16:58.719
The fire is going, the wood fire.

00:16:58.719 --> 00:17:00.277
- Good, really good.

00:17:00.277 --> 00:17:02.599
(laughing)

00:17:02.599 --> 00:17:05.486
(upbeat music)

00:17:05.486 --> 00:17:08.903
(scraping)

00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:14.147
(speaking in foreign language)

00:17:16.174 --> 00:17:17.007
- [Mark] Everything is prepared,

00:17:17.007 --> 00:17:19.341
but then she's just dishing everything out

00:17:19.341 --> 00:17:22.174
but her expertise, her experience.

00:17:24.355 --> 00:17:25.355
- [Mark] Oh!

00:17:30.118 --> 00:17:33.283
Oh, that entire steamer is
filled with string hoppers.

00:17:33.283 --> 00:17:35.099
I didn't know, I thought
the water was just boiling,

00:17:35.099 --> 00:17:39.266
but that was already full
by the time we got here.

00:17:41.833 --> 00:17:43.825
- [Mark] Invited us into their home,

00:17:43.825 --> 00:17:47.173
into their living room,
we're sitting on a mat.

00:17:47.173 --> 00:17:50.936
It's beautiful food,
the colors, the display,

00:17:50.936 --> 00:17:53.825
everything dished out, the string hoppers.

00:17:53.825 --> 00:17:56.370
And we're getting ready to dig in.

00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:57.353
You just asked the question, right?

00:17:57.353 --> 00:17:58.186
- Yeah, yeah.

00:17:58.186 --> 00:17:59.019
- [Mark] About this dish, right?

00:17:59.019 --> 00:17:59.852
- Yeah, yeah.

00:17:59.852 --> 00:18:01.498
- [Mark] And what it is, it's
like, it's a coconut milk,

00:18:01.498 --> 00:18:04.108
it looks like a coconut milk boil.

00:18:04.108 --> 00:18:05.306
And what is the local name of it?

00:18:05.306 --> 00:18:06.139
Pole...

00:18:06.139 --> 00:18:06.972
- [Ruzaina] Pole Pala.

00:18:06.972 --> 00:18:07.873
- Pole pala

00:18:07.873 --> 00:18:11.088
- [Mark] But then we didn't
know what the english name is so

00:18:11.088 --> 00:18:13.648
we just asked and it's
'Mountain nut leaves'?

00:18:13.648 --> 00:18:15.247
- [Ruzaina] Mountain nut grass.

00:18:15.247 --> 00:18:16.550
- Mountain nut grass?

00:18:16.550 --> 00:18:17.937
(laughter)

00:18:17.937 --> 00:18:20.704
that is kind of a funny name (laughs).

00:18:20.704 --> 00:18:23.004
- [Ruzaina] Start with this

00:18:23.004 --> 00:18:25.197
- [Mark] Gonna get started
here with the Rasam and you,

00:18:25.197 --> 00:18:26.887
and it's typical to just drink it.

00:18:26.887 --> 00:18:28.882
You can drink it from
the bowl, it's a soup.

00:18:28.882 --> 00:18:30.671
Ah Tamil, especially Taimil influence?

00:18:30.671 --> 00:18:31.649
- [Ruzaina] Yes

00:18:31.649 --> 00:18:35.111
(child babbling)

00:18:35.111 --> 00:18:35.944
- Oh wow!

00:18:36.838 --> 00:18:40.158
(laughs) oh that's amazing!

00:18:40.158 --> 00:18:43.063
(laughs) I wasn't even
expecting that much flavor.

00:18:43.063 --> 00:18:44.794
It is so incredibly good!

00:18:44.794 --> 00:18:48.908
It's like, it's slighting rich
and oily but like refreshing

00:18:48.908 --> 00:18:51.045
and sour at the same time.

00:18:51.045 --> 00:18:52.550
Oh what is that sourness coming from?

00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:53.568
- [Ruzaina] Tamarind

00:18:53.568 --> 00:18:54.697
- Tamarind, okay!

00:18:54.697 --> 00:18:55.813
Oh that beautiful!

00:18:55.813 --> 00:18:57.302
(upbeat music)

00:18:57.302 --> 00:18:59.635
- [Mark] That's spectacular.

00:19:01.498 --> 00:19:02.711
A little bit of everything
on the plate with

00:19:02.711 --> 00:19:04.926
the String Hoppers, in it
all with the soups and sauces

00:19:04.926 --> 00:19:08.441
over the String Hoppers, the coconuts.

00:19:08.441 --> 00:19:10.592
I guess I'll try the, what is it called?

00:19:10.592 --> 00:19:11.425
The Mountian...

00:19:11.425 --> 00:19:12.398
- [Ruzaina] Nut Grass.

00:19:12.398 --> 00:19:14.032
- [Mark] Nut Grass.

00:19:14.032 --> 00:19:15.521
- [Ruzaina] (laughs) Not
nut, Mountain Knotgrass.

00:19:15.521 --> 00:19:16.858
- [Mark] Oh, Mountain 'not' Grass?

00:19:16.858 --> 00:19:17.691
- [Ruzaina] (laughs) Knotgrass

00:19:17.691 --> 00:19:18.524
- [Mark] (laughs) Really?

00:19:18.524 --> 00:19:19.357
- [Ruzaina] Knot, like a knot.

00:19:19.357 --> 00:19:20.190
- [Mark] N-O-T ?

00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:21.023
Oh!

00:19:21.023 --> 00:19:23.465
(laughter)

00:19:23.465 --> 00:19:25.016
okay, let me just clarify that.

00:19:25.016 --> 00:19:27.168
It's not 'Mountian Nut Grass'.

00:19:27.168 --> 00:19:30.388
Mountain Knot, 'K', K-N-O-T.

00:19:30.388 --> 00:19:31.221
Mountain.

00:19:31.221 --> 00:19:32.615
Let's call it Mountain K-not

00:19:32.615 --> 00:19:34.486
(laughter)

00:19:34.486 --> 00:19:37.505
- [Mark] Okay, Mountain Knotgrass
wrapped in coconut milk.

00:19:37.505 --> 00:19:40.036
It almost has the feel of
Sage, that kind of like...

00:19:40.036 --> 00:19:41.500
- [Ruzaina] Feel?

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:43.565
- [Mark] Fealty, fealty feel.

00:19:43.565 --> 00:19:45.383
(child babbling and shuffling)

00:19:45.383 --> 00:19:47.966
(muffled thud)

00:19:49.171 --> 00:19:50.004
mmmh.

00:19:51.789 --> 00:19:54.481
Oh wow, that's spectacular.

00:19:54.481 --> 00:19:57.657
- [Mark] It has like a,
almost like a cloth texture.

00:19:57.657 --> 00:20:01.301
Really nutty taste; wrapped
up in that coconut milk.

00:20:01.301 --> 00:20:03.035
Oh, that's spectacular.

00:20:03.035 --> 00:20:04.702
It's like Spinach taste
but with like a totally

00:20:04.702 --> 00:20:05.725
different texture.

00:20:05.725 --> 00:20:08.472
- [Mark] Moving over to the
lagoon fish, and this is in

00:20:08.472 --> 00:20:09.305
a curry.

00:20:09.305 --> 00:20:13.138
I'll grab some of the
Hoppers, String Hoppers.

00:20:15.615 --> 00:20:16.512
- Mmh

00:20:16.512 --> 00:20:17.345
- Mmmmh!

00:20:18.368 --> 00:20:19.733
oh the fish!

00:20:19.733 --> 00:20:20.566
- Mmh

00:20:21.707 --> 00:20:25.214
- There's some kind of really
unique green taste to it.

00:20:25.214 --> 00:20:27.643
- Yeah, it's lagoon fish, right?

00:20:27.643 --> 00:20:29.517
So you get that lagoon taste.

00:20:29.517 --> 00:20:30.419
- That's what it is?

00:20:30.419 --> 00:20:31.394
- (laughs) Yeah.

00:20:31.394 --> 00:20:32.399
- (mumbles)

00:20:32.399 --> 00:20:33.699
- Yeah.

00:20:33.699 --> 00:20:36.226
- [Mark] It's almost like a
vegetable taste in the fish.

00:20:36.226 --> 00:20:37.059
- [Ruzaina] Yeah.

00:20:37.059 --> 00:20:39.984
- [Mark] And the curry
is also really Cuminy.

00:20:39.984 --> 00:20:40.817
- Yes.

00:20:40.817 --> 00:20:41.967
- Really Cuminy, yeah.

00:20:41.967 --> 00:20:43.880
- [Mark] And then the String
Hoppers are really nice and

00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:44.713
light.

00:20:44.713 --> 00:20:45.546
- [Ruzaina] Mmh.

00:20:45.546 --> 00:20:47.171
- [Mark] Like it's like
a lighter form of rice.

00:20:47.171 --> 00:20:51.351
Like Vermicelli, almost,
but even, like, lighter.

00:20:51.351 --> 00:20:53.388
- It is made with Rice flour.

00:20:53.388 --> 00:20:55.208
- [Mark] Going back in for some of the,

00:20:55.208 --> 00:20:57.127
the Mountian K-not,...

00:20:57.127 --> 00:20:59.219
(Ruzaina laughs)

00:20:59.219 --> 00:21:02.802
Mountain Knotgrass, and then
mix it with some of the more

00:21:02.802 --> 00:21:04.135
coconut as well.

00:21:06.127 --> 00:21:11.127
Mmmh, mmh, the mix of herbs
and vegetables is like...

00:21:11.129 --> 00:21:12.201
- So awesome right?

00:21:12.201 --> 00:21:13.937
- It's so awesome.

00:21:13.937 --> 00:21:15.971
It's so good, it's so vibrant!

00:21:15.971 --> 00:21:18.094
- But you will not get this all over...

00:21:18.094 --> 00:21:18.927
- Okay.

00:21:18.927 --> 00:21:22.494
- This kind of , this is like
a very very special dish.

00:21:22.494 --> 00:21:24.174
- Only Batticaloa, or all over east coast?

00:21:24.174 --> 00:21:28.330
- I've had it only in Batticaloa;
you might get it elsewhere

00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:32.110
but I've never ever ever, in
my life, come across something

00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:33.109
like this.

00:21:33.109 --> 00:21:34.694
It's here that I had.

00:21:34.694 --> 00:21:35.527
- Ahh okay.

00:21:35.527 --> 00:21:36.360
- Yeah, It's here that I had.

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:37.193
- And in Colombo, can you find it? No?

00:21:37.193 --> 00:21:38.026
- No

00:21:38.026 --> 00:21:38.859
- Colombo no.

00:21:38.859 --> 00:21:40.185
- Nobody makes it like this.

00:21:40.185 --> 00:21:41.018
- Okay.

00:21:41.018 --> 00:21:44.499
- So basically, it's
like Mountain K-notgrass

00:21:44.499 --> 00:21:45.616
(laughter)

00:21:45.616 --> 00:21:46.449
right?

00:21:46.449 --> 00:21:47.552
- That's what we'll call it (laughs)

00:21:47.552 --> 00:21:50.412
- It's cooked in coconut
milk and chilies and...

00:21:50.412 --> 00:21:51.466
You have to taste it.

00:21:51.466 --> 00:21:54.316
It doesn't look as
appetizing, as you can see

00:21:54.316 --> 00:21:56.146
- That really is the dish of the meal.

00:21:56.146 --> 00:21:57.827
- [Ruzaina] It doesn't look as appetizing.

00:21:57.827 --> 00:22:00.518
It just looks so watery and
someone looking at it wouldn't

00:22:00.518 --> 00:22:02.920
even realize that it has so much flavor.

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:05.678
- [Mark] It's that vegetable
that's providing so much flavor

00:22:05.678 --> 00:22:06.511
- [Ruzaina] Yeah.

00:22:06.511 --> 00:22:09.094
(upbeat music)

00:22:15.834 --> 00:22:20.834
(upbeat music)

00:22:23.669 --> 00:22:25.865
- They are fishing right behind
me, but we just made it back

00:22:25.865 --> 00:22:28.717
to the hotel where we
started this entire day.

00:22:28.717 --> 00:22:32.154
It's been a spontaneous day;
it's been an adventurous day.

00:22:32.154 --> 00:22:35.451
It's been a day that didn't go as planned,

00:22:35.451 --> 00:22:37.322
and it was an amazing day.

00:22:37.322 --> 00:22:39.603
I want to say a massive Thank
