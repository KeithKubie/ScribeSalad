00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:02.710
Now we're ready for Newton's
third law.

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:05.040
And Newton's third law, in some
ways, I think is the most

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.230
fun because it's-- at least it
was to me, the least intuitive

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:10.020
of all the laws.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.570
But once you really kind of
understand it a lot of things

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:13.290
start to make sense.

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.970
So Newton's third law
essentially says-- actually, I

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.100
can tell you kind of what
you might have heard.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.160
A lot of people say every
action has an equal and

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.690
opposite reaction.

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:26.080
Another way of thinking about
it is, if there's an object

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.460
and it exerts a force
on another object.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:34.150
So let's say I have a-- oh,
let me think of something.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:41.460
Let's say that I have a fist. So
let me draw the fist. So I

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.660
have a fist and it is punching
someone's face.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.110
So this is a face, and
they're not happy.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.830
And let's say this fist is
punching the face with a force

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:00.840
of-- I don't know--
10 Newtons.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:01.700
Let's not make it so violent.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.860
Let's say that this is a hand
massaging the face.

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.940
It's pressing upon the face with
a force of 10 Newtons.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.210
So what Newton's third law tells
us is that the face is

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.380
also, I guess, we could
say punching the hand.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.280
Or-- well no, we're not
using the violent.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.280
The face is also pressing upon
the hand with a force of 10

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.280
Newtons in the opposite
direction.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.360
I guess you would say
along the same line.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.080
So does that make any sense?

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.540
Because it seems like the hand
is doing something to the face

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.830
and not the other way around.

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.420
But if you think about it, when
you press on someone's

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.330
face, their face might kind of
press in a little bit, but you

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.530
also feel something on your
fist or on your hand.

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.190
I mean think of it, maybe a
better example would be

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.950
instead of someone's face,
imagine if it was a tree that

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.700
you've decided to massage
or, I guess, punch.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.510
So here is the tree.

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:06.790
That is the tree.

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.880
And the same thing
would happen.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.970
If you were to press upon the
tree with-- if you were to

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.350
punch the tree essentially,
the tree is essentially

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.540
punching back with the
exact same force.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.650
And here it makes sense because
your hand will hurt.

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.020
And maybe in this case, the
face will hurt because the

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.900
face kind of gives way while
your fist doesn't.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.750
But here the tree's not giving
way and your fist will.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:35.170
Another way to think about it
is if-- well, and this is

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.840
probably the least intuitive.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.380
If I have the earth and
here am I standing

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:43.630
on top of the earth.

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.330
So we already figured out that
the pull of the earth or the

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.940
force of gravity upon me,
it's pulling down

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.820
upon me at 150 pounds.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:55.580
That's the force.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:56.710
And you know, we could
say the Newton.

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.120
But pounds is a unit of
force, it's weight.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.710
But also, Newton's third law
tells us that I'm actually, at

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.870
the same moment, pulling
on the earth with a

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.620
force of 150 pounds.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.890
And this might not make a lot
of sense to you, but you can

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:17.210
think about it this way.

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:20.360
When I'm stepping on-- let's
say I'm stepping on a soft

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.010
surface, like sand
or something.

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.440
My feet will compress a little
bit, but so does the sand.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.460
Well, depending on which
one's softer.

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.360
And another way to think about
it also is, if me and the

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.440
earth are both in deep space.

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.990
And I am, you could say, falling
towards the earth

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:40.780
because the earth is
pulling on me.

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.140
How do we know that the earth
isn't falling towards me?

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.850
I mean it's kind of arbitrary.

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:45.960
There's no frame of reference.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.100
We're both in deep space.

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.360
There's nothing else
to look at.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.070
We're essentially, falling
towards each other.

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:53.200
I'm not necessarily falling to
the earth, the earth's not

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.580
necessarily falling to me, we're
just falling towards

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:55.310
each other.

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.740
And that's another way of
thinking about this.

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:59.870
So you could think about every
example where a force applies

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:00.500
to something.

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.390
And if you really think about
it, the force is going the

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:04.150
other way as well.

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:09.600
For example, if I were to take
I bat to this tree and swing

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:10.700
on it really hard.

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.490
So I were to swing on this tree
really hard, I have a

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:16.040
good chance of breaking
that bat.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.839
Even though you would have
thought, hey, that bat is

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:20.690
applying the force
to the tree.

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:22.240
But why is the bat breaking?

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.700
Because the tree is applying
an equal force to the bat.

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.780
And actually, if I did it
perfectly, if I had like--

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:33.540
let's say I had two bats
or two swords.

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.080
For some reason I think I'm
going a little too violent

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.700
with these example.

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.250
But I guess you know we're
talking about forces.

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.990
So maybe violence is
justified here.

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:46.810
But let's say I have two swords
that are completely

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:48.060
identical hitting each other.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.540
And let's say I keep increasing
the force at which

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:56.110
they're kind of going in
opposite directions.

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.600
At some point, they're
going to break.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.640
If I just keep increasing the
force on-- you know, one guy

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.490
is swinging in one direction,
one guy is swinging in the

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:04.590
exact opposite direction.

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:08.180
And the force just keeps
increasing, at some point,

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:09.720
they're going to break.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:14.480
And you could say that well--
this guy says well, I was the

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.650
only guy swinging because
this guy was stationery.

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:18.880
And the other guy will say,
well, I was really guy

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.530
swinging because this
guy was stationary.

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.140
Not one of them is going to
break, they're both going to

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:28.230
break because even though this
mauve sword was pushing on

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:32.020
this blue sword with some force,
the blue sword was

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.850
essentially pushing back with
the exact same force.

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:36.780
So these are completely
identical swords.

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:38.320
At some point, they're
going to break.

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:39.780
Another way we could think about
it, one of the swords

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.410
could have just been held.

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:42.390
You know, stationary.

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:44.620
It could've been held stationary
by somebody and

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.530
this other sword that-- if you
were to press down on it, kept

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:51.040
increasing the force with which
you press, at some point

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.780
they both would break.

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:53.780
Because they're identical.

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:55.570
If one was harder than the
other, than that one would

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:56.920
stick around.

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.130
Hopefully that gives you
a little intuition.

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:01.940
I mean we could do a bunch
of more examples.

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:02.690
I'm trying to think.

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:05.460
Oh, let me think
of another one.

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:06.250
A less violent one.

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:09.770
Let's say we're in deep space
again and I have a-- I don't

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.330
know-- I have a basketball.

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:15.100
Let me do it in orange.

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:19.260
I have a basketball and
it weighs 1 kilogram.

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:32.360
And let's say that I weigh 50
kilograms. So let's say I

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:38.120
push-- so my hand pushes on this
ball with a force of-- I

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.200
don't know-- let's say I push
on that ball with a force of

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:41.582
10 Newtons.

00:06:41.582 --> 00:06:44.930
10 Newtons to the right.

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:48.220
What Newton's third law tells
me is that essentially, that

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:51.530
basketball is going to push on
my hand with an equal and

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:52.240
opposite force.

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:55.830
So it's going to push on me with
a force of 10 Newtons.

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:57.200
So what's going to happen?

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.700
So we're touching.

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:00.850
I'm pushing on 10 Newtons on
the basketball and we're in

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:01.570
deep space.

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:04.310
There's no gravity from random
stars, et cetera.

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:06.200
And then the basketball's going
to push on me with the

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:09.040
force of 10 Newtons
simultaneously.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:12.290
We know F equals ma.

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:17.090
So the basketball, so 10 Newtons
is equal to 1 kilogram

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:18.030
times acceleration.

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:21.700
So acceleration is going to be
10 meters per second squared

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:22.460
to the right.

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:24.580
So as long as we're touching,
the basketball's going to

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:29.620
accelerate at 10 meters per
second squared to the right.

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:33.410
And simultaneously, I'm going
to accelerate at a certain

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:34.460
acceleration to the left.

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:36.880
And what's that going to be?

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:41.710
50 kilograms. We know that the
force to the left is also

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:42.700
going to be 10 Newtons.

00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:46.470
That equals 50 kilograms
times acceleration.

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:52.530
So here, the acceleration is
going to be 1/5 meters per

00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:54.700
second squared.

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:57.470
So we're both in deep space
floating around and I push on

00:07:57.470 --> 00:08:01.710
this 1 kilogram basketball with
a force of 10 Newtons.

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:05.350
As long as I'm pushing on it,
it's going to accelerate at 10

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:07.950
meters per second squared.

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:11.950
But simultaneously, while I'm
pushing on it, it's exerting

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:14.630
an equal and opposite force
on me of 10 Newtons.

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:18.980
So I'm going to actually move
back a little bit at a slower

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:19.500
acceleration.

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:21.690
That's just because
I have more mass.

00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:24.090
At 1/5 meters per
second squared.

00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:26.190
Another example you could
think of is if

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:27.520
someone shoots a gun.

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:29.100
There's that-- I forgot
the term because

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:29.950
I don't shoot guns.

00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:34.929
But your shoulder jerks back
as I've seen in the movies

00:08:34.929 --> 00:08:36.500
when a bullet is shot.

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:39.090
That's because the gun is
exerting a force on that

00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:42.429
bullet and the bullet is
exerting an equal and opposite

00:08:42.429 --> 00:08:45.360
force on the gun, which
kind of pushes

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:46.450
back on your shoulder.

00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:49.940
And the reason why the bullet
just goes a lot, lot faster

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:53.060
forward than you and the gun go
backwards is because your

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:57.770
mass is much, much, much
larger than the bullet.

00:08:57.770 --> 00:08:59.450
Hopefully that gives you a
little bit of intuition on

00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:00.580
Newton's third law.

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:02.150
And this is kind of
non-intuitive.

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:05.320
So look around you in the world,
look at all the forces

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:07.860
that are being applied, and I
want you to think about when

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:11.050
one force is being applied in
one direction, why does it

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:13.785
make sense that another force,
an equal and opposite force,

00:09:13.785 --> 00:09:16.590
is being applied in the exact
opposite direction?

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:19.000
I'll see you all in
the next video.
