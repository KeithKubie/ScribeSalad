00:00:00.177 --> 00:00:02.682
- [Voiceover] Let's now tackle
the rest of this problem.

00:00:02.682 --> 00:00:05.315
So they say a light-bulb is non-ohmic

00:00:05.315 --> 00:00:08.501
if its resistance changes
as a function of current.

00:00:08.501 --> 00:00:11.297
Your setup from part a, which
we have right over here,

00:00:11.297 --> 00:00:13.865
is to be used or modified
to determine whether

00:00:13.865 --> 00:00:16.336
the light-bulb is non-ohmic.

00:00:16.336 --> 00:00:20.954
How, if at all, does the
setup need to be modified?

00:00:20.954 --> 00:00:22.879
Well, we want to be able
to change the current

00:00:22.879 --> 00:00:24.147
that's going through the light-bulb

00:00:24.147 --> 00:00:27.430
and then see how the resistance changes,

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.931
so what we could do, we
could always measure it

00:00:29.931 --> 00:00:31.031
with the setup right over here.

00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:33.181
It's very easy to measure the resistance.

00:00:33.181 --> 00:00:35.814
So we can measure resistance by,

00:00:35.814 --> 00:00:37.797
we know that V is equal to,

00:00:37.797 --> 00:00:40.137
we know that voltage is equal
to current times resistance

00:00:40.137 --> 00:00:43.908
or that resistance is equal
to voltage divided by current.

00:00:43.908 --> 00:00:45.566
So, if we know the current

00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:47.419
going through a light-bulb

00:00:47.419 --> 00:00:49.012
and we know the voltage across it,

00:00:49.012 --> 00:00:51.255
we can always figure out the
resistance of the light-bulb.

00:00:51.255 --> 00:00:53.206
So our set-up right here
is actually very good

00:00:53.206 --> 00:00:54.919
for figuring out the resistance

00:00:54.919 --> 00:00:57.125
of the actual light-bulb.

00:00:57.125 --> 00:00:58.783
And so we need to change the current

00:00:58.783 --> 00:01:00.668
and see how the resistance changes.

00:01:00.668 --> 00:01:01.681
And there's a couple of ways

00:01:01.681 --> 00:01:03.116
that we could change the current.

00:01:03.116 --> 00:01:05.489
We could change some
other resistance here,

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.187
but lucky for us we have
a variable power source,

00:01:08.187 --> 00:01:10.755
so we can change the voltage,

00:01:10.755 --> 00:01:13.421
we can change the voltage
across the entire circuit,

00:01:13.421 --> 00:01:14.564
and by changing the voltage

00:01:14.564 --> 00:01:16.096
across the entire circuit,

00:01:16.096 --> 00:01:18.339
well that's going to change
the current that is going.

00:01:18.339 --> 00:01:19.172
This is a simple circuit.

00:01:19.172 --> 00:01:20.465
It's just going in series.

00:01:20.465 --> 00:01:22.871
The current is just doing like that,

00:01:22.871 --> 00:01:25.764
and so if we change the current
through the entire circuit,

00:01:25.764 --> 00:01:28.072
we would be changing the
current through the light-bulb,

00:01:28.072 --> 00:01:30.478
and then we could just measure V and I

00:01:30.478 --> 00:01:33.895
and figure out whether R changes as well.

00:01:35.354 --> 00:01:38.252
So, how, if all, does the
setup need to be modified?

00:01:38.252 --> 00:01:41.015
I could say it doesn't
need to be modified.

00:01:41.015 --> 00:01:43.182
Doesn't need modification.

00:01:45.761 --> 00:01:46.845
Modification.

00:01:48.722 --> 00:01:49.992
All right.

00:01:49.992 --> 00:01:51.130
And then the next section,

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:52.853
what additional data, if any,

00:01:52.853 --> 00:01:55.551
would need to be collected.

00:01:55.551 --> 00:01:57.696
Well, I would want to,

00:01:57.696 --> 00:01:59.679
I would want to measure.

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:01.054
Let me even do this part down.

00:02:01.054 --> 00:02:03.102
Let me do it, part c, over here.

00:02:03.102 --> 00:02:04.018
So, part c.

00:02:05.995 --> 00:02:09.578
So, part one of part
c was no modification.

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.584
No modification.

00:02:16.964 --> 00:02:18.752
No mod, I can explain that.

00:02:18.752 --> 00:02:20.800
I can change resistance.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.883
I can change,

00:02:23.925 --> 00:02:25.591
I can change current

00:02:29.266 --> 00:02:31.769
by varying power source.

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:33.769
By varying power source.

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.273
Power source.

00:02:38.693 --> 00:02:40.676
I can measure,

00:02:40.676 --> 00:02:42.676
I can measure resistance

00:02:48.487 --> 00:02:49.320
of bulb

00:02:51.743 --> 00:02:53.659
by voltage across bulb,

00:02:58.212 --> 00:02:59.212
across bulb,

00:03:00.715 --> 00:03:01.631
divided by,

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.230
divided by current

00:03:06.696 --> 00:03:08.780
entering or exiting bulb.

00:03:10.894 --> 00:03:12.780
And I know the first part of this test

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:13.613
we were saying, hey,

00:03:13.613 --> 00:03:16.712
do we have the same number
of electrons per second

00:03:16.712 --> 00:03:18.845
entering the bulb or exiting the bulb,

00:03:18.845 --> 00:03:20.077
but from what we know of currents,

00:03:20.077 --> 00:03:21.731
we know that the current
is going to be the same

00:03:21.731 --> 00:03:22.618
on either side.

00:03:22.618 --> 00:03:25.386
You have a voltage drop,
but the current is the same.

00:03:25.386 --> 00:03:26.816
And so entering or exiting,

00:03:26.816 --> 00:03:28.084
you're going to get the same value,

00:03:28.084 --> 00:03:29.872
and even if you didn't
know what I just told you,

00:03:29.872 --> 00:03:31.767
the first part of the experiment
would have told you that,

00:03:31.767 --> 00:03:32.681
that your current is the same

00:03:32.681 --> 00:03:34.696
entering and exiting the bulb.

00:03:34.696 --> 00:03:36.054
And so, this right over here

00:03:36.054 --> 00:03:40.138
is going to be equal to
the resistance of the bulb.

00:03:40.138 --> 00:03:45.052
So I can change the current
by varying the power source,

00:03:45.052 --> 00:03:48.563
and then I can see what value I get for R

00:03:48.563 --> 00:03:50.095
by measuring these things

00:03:50.095 --> 00:03:52.538
as I change that overall current for my,

00:03:52.538 --> 00:03:53.621
for my setup.

00:03:56.351 --> 00:03:57.196
Let's see b.

00:03:57.196 --> 00:04:00.154
What additional data, if any,
would need to be collected?

00:04:00.154 --> 00:04:01.237
So, part two.

00:04:03.322 --> 00:04:05.263
Part two here.

00:04:05.263 --> 00:04:07.697
I'd need to collect,

00:04:07.697 --> 00:04:08.947
collect voltage

00:04:13.029 --> 00:04:13.862
across,

00:04:15.207 --> 00:04:16.207
across bulb

00:04:17.287 --> 00:04:18.871
as current changes,

00:04:21.968 --> 00:04:24.961
or it'd be as I change
my variable power source.

00:04:24.961 --> 00:04:26.961
As I vary power source,

00:04:31.142 --> 00:04:32.813
power source,

00:04:32.813 --> 00:04:34.796
and I would also have to collect,

00:04:34.796 --> 00:04:35.772
maybe I'll write it this way,

00:04:35.772 --> 00:04:38.276
I'll collect that, voltage.

00:04:38.276 --> 00:04:39.109
I'll write it like that.

00:04:39.109 --> 00:04:41.643
Voltage across bulb as
I vary power source,

00:04:41.643 --> 00:04:43.643
and I could say current,

00:04:44.914 --> 00:04:46.330
current entering,

00:04:48.774 --> 00:04:49.774
exiting bulb

00:04:54.496 --> 00:04:56.412
as I vary power source.

00:05:00.101 --> 00:05:01.184
Power source.

00:05:02.121 --> 00:05:04.136
So I'd have to measure these things

00:05:04.136 --> 00:05:06.835
and then I'll be able to
figure out if my R changes.

00:05:06.835 --> 00:05:09.955
All right, let's tackle part d now.

00:05:09.955 --> 00:05:11.191
How would you analyze the data

00:05:11.191 --> 00:05:13.893
to determine whether the bulb I non-ohmic?

00:05:13.893 --> 00:05:15.746
Include a discussion of
how the uncertainties

00:05:15.746 --> 00:05:19.680
in the voltmeters and ammeters
would affect your argument

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.938
for concluding whether the
resistance is non-ohmic.

00:05:23.938 --> 00:05:27.839
Well, I explained it a
little bit, well, up here,

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:29.790
but I'll write it again.

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:32.271
d, so, let me read that one more time.

00:05:32.271 --> 00:05:34.519
How would you analyze the data?

00:05:34.519 --> 00:05:36.435
So, what I would do is,

00:05:37.834 --> 00:05:39.251
so, power source,

00:05:41.768 --> 00:05:43.986
I would make one voltage for,

00:05:43.986 --> 00:05:46.152
I would vary power source,

00:05:49.867 --> 00:05:51.867
source to first voltage,

00:05:55.143 --> 00:05:55.976
voltage,

00:05:58.486 --> 00:05:59.486
and measure,

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:04.715
measure what is described above,

00:06:04.715 --> 00:06:06.215
and measure above.

00:06:07.596 --> 00:06:09.013
Use to calculate,

00:06:13.187 --> 00:06:16.341
use to calculate the resistance,

00:06:16.341 --> 00:06:17.924
resistance of bulb.

00:06:21.965 --> 00:06:23.215
And then, vary

00:06:26.105 --> 00:06:27.105
power source

00:06:30.161 --> 00:06:31.661
to second voltage,

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:36.159
voltage, and once again,

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:38.577
measure above,

00:06:39.783 --> 00:06:40.950
measure above.

00:06:43.219 --> 00:06:45.757
See if resistance changes,

00:06:45.757 --> 00:06:47.257
see if resistance

00:06:51.265 --> 00:06:52.098
changes.

00:06:55.288 --> 00:06:57.336
So, we could say,

00:06:57.336 --> 00:06:58.836
if V across bulb,

00:07:01.636 --> 00:07:02.636
across bulb,

00:07:05.454 --> 00:07:08.012
over, let me actually, let
me just write it this way.

00:07:08.012 --> 00:07:09.578
All the Vs are cross above with.

00:07:09.578 --> 00:07:11.749
V_one over the current_one,

00:07:11.749 --> 00:07:13.481
so this is the voltage across the bulb

00:07:13.481 --> 00:07:15.594
over the current across the bulb.

00:07:15.594 --> 00:07:19.592
If this is equal to, after I change it,

00:07:19.592 --> 00:07:21.315
the voltage across the bulb

00:07:21.315 --> 00:07:24.696
divided by the current across the bulb.

00:07:24.696 --> 00:07:26.419
If this over here,

00:07:26.419 --> 00:07:29.540
if these are equal,
then I am dealing with,

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:31.783
the resistance has not changed,

00:07:31.783 --> 00:07:33.449
and so we could say,

00:07:34.646 --> 00:07:36.208
well non-ohmic,

00:07:36.208 --> 00:07:39.348
non-ohmic is when the
resistance does change.

00:07:39.348 --> 00:07:40.569
If resistance, so we could say,

00:07:40.569 --> 00:07:43.439
non-non-ohmic, or I could say

00:07:43.439 --> 00:07:44.605
not non-ohmic,

00:07:47.372 --> 00:07:48.205
non-ohmic,

00:07:50.981 --> 00:07:54.814
otherwise if V_one over
I_one does not equal,

00:07:55.954 --> 00:07:57.714
let me write that, I wrote V_i.

00:07:57.714 --> 00:07:59.381
Let me write V_one,

00:08:00.431 --> 00:08:03.844
V_one over I_one does not equal

00:08:03.844 --> 00:08:07.177
V_two over I_two, then we are non-ohmic.

00:08:10.866 --> 00:08:12.686
And we have to be careful,

00:08:12.686 --> 00:08:17.302
because the sensitivities of
our voltmeters and ammeters

00:08:17.302 --> 00:08:19.090
might give us an aberrant result.

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:20.976
For example, we might be non-ohmic

00:08:20.976 --> 00:08:23.316
but because of how we're
rounding in the measurement,

00:08:23.316 --> 00:08:25.104
it actually might give us a change,

00:08:25.104 --> 00:08:28.011
especially because our ammeter
is more sensitive here,

00:08:28.011 --> 00:08:31.002
and on the other hand, we
might be a situation where

00:08:31.002 --> 00:08:34.123
we are non-ohmic, but it doesn't,

00:08:34.123 --> 00:08:36.041
you don't register the
change because it hasn't

00:08:36.041 --> 00:08:37.406
been large enough to be registered

00:08:37.406 --> 00:08:40.104
by the sensitivity of your instruments.

00:08:40.104 --> 00:08:42.021
So, need to be careful,

00:08:43.392 --> 00:08:44.642
careful about,

00:08:46.778 --> 00:08:49.606
about instrument sensitivity.

00:08:49.606 --> 00:08:51.523
Instrument sensitivity.

00:08:53.576 --> 00:08:54.576
Sensitivity.

00:08:57.055 --> 00:08:58.138
The rounding,

00:08:59.948 --> 00:09:01.615
rounding to nearest,

00:09:05.539 --> 00:09:06.956
nearest 0.1 volt

00:09:08.312 --> 00:09:09.228
or 0.01 amp

00:09:12.505 --> 00:09:13.839
could result in,

00:09:17.837 --> 00:09:19.003
in difference

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:23.016
in V over I

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:26.534
when there isn't any,

00:09:27.431 --> 00:09:28.764
there isn't any,

00:09:31.202 --> 00:09:32.369
or vice versa.

00:09:33.582 --> 00:09:35.604
It might not result in a difference,

00:09:35.604 --> 00:09:36.840
but there actually might be a change

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:38.400
but it's not big enough to be measured.

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:39.567
Or vice versa.

00:09:40.838 --> 00:09:42.008
So you always have to be careful

00:09:42.008 --> 00:09:43.926
when you're doing any
experiment in any science

00:09:43.926 --> 00:09:46.755
about how sensitive your
actual instruments are

00:09:46.755 --> 00:09:48.120
and what the rounding might do

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.037
for these calculations.
