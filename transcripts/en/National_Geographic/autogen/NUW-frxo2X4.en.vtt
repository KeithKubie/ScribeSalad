00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
recollection of what had happened and
that was accomplished by putting people

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.010
that was accomplished by putting people
 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.390
that was accomplished by putting people
to sleep for 3040 days accompanied by

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400
to sleep for 3040 days accompanied by
 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.220
to sleep for 3040 days accompanied by
different kinds of cocktails of drugs

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:55.230
different kinds of cocktails of drugs
 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:57.900
different kinds of cocktails of drugs
now that's not any kind of therapy

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:57.910
now that's not any kind of therapy
 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.070
now that's not any kind of therapy
that's a brainwashing experiment

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080
that's a brainwashing experiment
 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.110
that's a brainwashing experiment
