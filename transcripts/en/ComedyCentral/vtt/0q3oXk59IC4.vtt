00:00:03.036 --> 00:00:05.372
OKAY, THE TRAFFIC IS REALLY
HEAVY OVER THERE,

00:00:05.405 --> 00:00:06.874
SO IT WOULD BE GOOD
TO GET INTO THAT,

00:00:06.907 --> 00:00:07.908
AND THEN THERE'LL
BE REALLY SOME THINGS

00:00:07.941 --> 00:00:09.209
TO GET MAD ABOUT.

00:00:09.243 --> 00:00:10.477
DENSE TRAFFIC.

00:00:10.511 --> 00:00:12.145
OH, GREAT.

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.681
I'M STUCK BEHIND A [bleep]--
WHAT IS THAT, A TRACTOR?

00:00:14.715 --> 00:00:17.518
DON'T DRIVE A TRACTOR
ON THE STREET IN TRAFFIC.

00:00:17.551 --> 00:00:20.220
JUST SO I'M CLEAR,
IT'S NOT ILLEGAL

00:00:20.254 --> 00:00:22.589
TO GIVE SOMEONE
THE FINGER, RIGHT?

00:00:22.623 --> 00:00:24.391
BECAUSE I'M THINKING OF GIVING
SOMEONE THE FINGER.

00:00:24.424 --> 00:00:25.893
BUT IT'S NOT ILLEGAL, RIGHT?

00:00:25.926 --> 00:00:26.894
YOU DON'T GET ARRESTED
FOR THAT, DO YOU?

00:00:26.927 --> 00:00:27.895
- NO.

00:00:27.928 --> 00:00:29.062
- HURRY UP, GRANDMA!

00:00:29.096 --> 00:00:30.163
[horn honks]

00:00:30.197 --> 00:00:31.365
THEY'VE BEEN DOING CONSTRUCTION

00:00:31.398 --> 00:00:33.901
ON THIS STREET FOR FOUR MONTHS!

00:00:33.934 --> 00:00:35.569
ENOUGH!

00:00:35.602 --> 00:00:37.738
I MEAN IT'S AN IMPORTANT
DRAINAGE PROJECT,

00:00:37.771 --> 00:00:41.441
I UNDERSTAND THAT,
BUT IT'S INFURIATING.

00:00:41.475 --> 00:00:44.077
I DON'T KNOW IF I'M REALLY
FEELING ALL THE ANGER

00:00:44.111 --> 00:00:47.681
I NEED TO HERE,
BUT I'LL TRY AGAIN.

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:49.716
I SAW PLENTY OF CARELESSNESS,

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.052
BUT NONE OF IT WAS HARMFUL
TO ME, PERSONALLY,

00:00:52.085 --> 00:00:54.288
UNTIL, FINALLY, I GOT LUCKY.

00:00:54.321 --> 00:00:55.889
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

00:00:55.923 --> 00:00:57.958
THIS GUY'S PASSING ME
ON A TWO-LANE STREET.

00:00:57.991 --> 00:00:59.359
[horn honks]
HEY, JACK-WHACK.

00:00:59.393 --> 00:01:01.261
THAT'S FOR YOU,
THE MIDDLE FINGER!

00:01:01.295 --> 00:01:02.296
EAT IT!

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:03.931
OH.
OH, OKAY.

00:01:03.964 --> 00:01:06.133
HERE WE GO.
IT IS ON.

00:01:06.166 --> 00:01:09.069
COME WITH ME.
ROAD RAGE IN ACTION.

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:12.239
HEY, YOU DON'T PASS SOMEBODY
ON A TWO-LANE STREET!

00:01:12.272 --> 00:01:13.473
THAT'S NOT SAFE.

00:01:13.507 --> 00:01:15.976
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
OH, AH, NO, NEVER MIND.

00:01:16.076 --> 00:01:17.277
IT'S FINE.
I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY,

00:01:17.311 --> 00:01:18.445
I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY.

00:01:18.478 --> 00:01:19.446
I JUST DIDN'T THINK IT WAS SAFE

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:22.082
TO GO ON A--PASS--OH.

00:01:22.115 --> 00:01:23.150
HEY, EXCUSE ME.

00:01:23.183 --> 00:01:24.484
UH, WAIT A MINUTE.

00:01:24.518 --> 00:01:26.119
PLEASE DON'T GET IN MY CAR.

00:01:26.153 --> 00:01:27.788
HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!

00:01:27.821 --> 00:01:29.823
WHERE YOU GOING?

00:01:36.096 --> 00:01:38.498
PLEASE COME BACK!
