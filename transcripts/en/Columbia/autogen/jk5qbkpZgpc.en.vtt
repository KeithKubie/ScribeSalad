research okay so columbia is a small

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370
research okay so columbia is a small
 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.280
research okay so columbia is a small
place and there are just over a thousand

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290
place and there are just over a thousand
 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:04.930
place and there are just over a thousand
students per year in the college and

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940
students per year in the college and
 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.020
students per year in the college and
about a quarter in round numbers turned

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030
about a quarter in round numbers turned
 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.400
about a quarter in round numbers turned
out to be the sciences and many of those

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410
out to be the sciences and many of those
 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:12.370
out to be the sciences and many of those
are pre-made and so if you think about

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380
are pre-made and so if you think about
 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.009
are pre-made and so if you think about
250 students a year there are a lot of

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:15.019
250 students a year there are a lot of
 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:17.440
250 students a year there are a lot of
faculty with whom those students can

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450
faculty with whom those students can
 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:18.420
faculty with whom those students can
interact so the

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430
interact so the
 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.240

thing that Columbia can offer is a lot

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250
thing that Columbia can offer is a lot
 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.010
thing that Columbia can offer is a lot
of one-on-one attention to any student

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020

attention in the days when I was an

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:28.389
attention in the days when I was an
 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:29.749
attention in the days when I was an
undergraduate which was a few years ago

00:04:29.749 --> 00:04:29.759
undergraduate which was a few years ago
 

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:33.540

the model was that you take classes and

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550
the model was that you take classes and
 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.010
the model was that you take classes and
then you get your bachelor's degree at

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020
then you get your bachelor's degree at
 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.379
then you get your bachelor's degree at
some point you might go on to a PhD now

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:37.389
some point you might go on to a PhD now
 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:39.120
some point you might go on to a PhD now
the modern model certainly the Columbia

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130
the modern model certainly the Columbia
 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.279
the modern model certainly the Columbia
model is that we try and get students

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:41.289
model is that we try and get students
 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:44.129
model is that we try and get students
involved in real science and so there

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:44.139
involved in real science and so there
 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:45.749
involved in real science and so there
are opportunities for any student who

00:04:45.749 --> 00:04:45.759
are opportunities for any student who
 

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:49.800
are opportunities for any student who

some wild things and those in rural
 

00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:19.270
some wild things and those in rural
sciences but part of the trick in terms

00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:19.280
sciences but part of the trick in terms

of the study abroad is to manage the

00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:21.380
of the study abroad is to manage the
 

00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:23.560
of the study abroad is to manage the
curriculum and so in addition to the

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:23.570
curriculum and so in addition to the
 

00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:26.020
curriculum and so in addition to the
advising Dean's which we've heard about

advising Dean's which we've heard about
 

00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:28.540
advising Dean's which we've heard about
we encourage students who come anywhere

00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:28.550
we encourage students who come anywhere
 

00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:30.850
we encourage students who come anywhere
near us to talk to what's called the

00:14:30.850 --> 00:14:30.860
near us to talk to what's called the
 

00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:32.410
near us to talk to what's called the
director of undergraduate studies in the

director of undergraduate studies in the
 

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:34.410
director of undergraduate studies in the
department that's I'm one of them and

00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:34.420
department that's I'm one of them and
 

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:37.420

that that person then works with a

00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:37.430
that that person then works with a
 

00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:39.520
that that person then works with a
student to try and design a curriculum

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:39.530
student to try and design a curriculum
 

00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:42.010
student to try and design a curriculum
of courses by certainly by the time we

00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:42.020
of courses by certainly by the time we

become juniors to sit down with them and

00:14:44.170 --> 00:14:44.180
become juniors to sit down with them and
 

00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:46.620
become juniors to sit down with them and
actually have them map out their entire

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:46.630
actually have them map out their entire
 

00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:48.970
actually have them map out their entire
remainder at Columbia and if they're

00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:48.980
remainder at Columbia and if they're
 

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:50.730
remainder at Columbia and if they're
going abroad they really have to do that

00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:50.740
going abroad they really have to do that
 

00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:53.070
going abroad they really have to do that
because as you say they they get out of

00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:53.080
because as you say they they get out of
 

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:54.960
because as you say they they get out of
cycle so we have to have some way of

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:54.970
cycle so we have to have some way of
 

00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:58.680

very very cunningly integrating whatever
 

00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:00.449
very very cunningly integrating whatever
they're doing in with a curriculum so

00:15:00.449 --> 00:15:00.459
they're doing in with a curriculum so
 

00:15:00.459 --> 00:15:02.639
they're doing in with a curriculum so
that they don't miss anything and it's

00:15:02.639 --> 00:15:02.649
that they don't miss anything and it's
 

00:15:02.649 --> 00:15:04.230
that they don't miss anything and it's
entirely doable but it all comes down to

00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:04.240
entirely doable but it all comes down to
 

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:07.920
entirely doable but it all comes down to

take students out in the desert in the

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:12.490
take students out in the desert in the
 

00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:15.210
take students out in the desert in the
spring break and we manage that simply

00:15:15.210 --> 00:15:15.220
spring break and we manage that simply
 

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:16.920
spring break and we manage that simply
by having it you know the actual trip

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:16.930
by having it you know the actual trip
 

00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:19.139
by having it you know the actual trip
over spring break so there are ways of

00:15:19.139 --> 00:15:19.149
over spring break so there are ways of
 

00:15:19.149 --> 00:15:20.940
over spring break so there are ways of
doing it but we do send students to with

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:20.950
doing it but we do send students to with
 

00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:23.190
doing it but we do send students to with
weird places and I would just add to

especially for the sciences I imagine
 

00:16:39.339 --> 00:16:41.190
especially for the sciences I imagine
this very important to you but finding

00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:41.200
this very important to you but finding
 

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:43.290
this very important to you but finding
and pursuing research opportunities and

just a sense of what's available ok so

00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:45.670
just a sense of what's available ok so
 

00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:47.850
just a sense of what's available ok so
that's that's the common question

00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:47.860
that's that's the common question
 

00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:50.850
that's that's the common question
and the simple answer is networking what

00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:50.860
and the simple answer is networking what
 

00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:53.030
and the simple answer is networking what
you do if you're a student is that you

00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:53.040
you do if you're a student is that you
 

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:55.380
you do if you're a student is that you
you're in classes so the class

00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:55.390
you're in classes so the class
 

00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:57.329
you're in classes so the class
immediately means that you have contact

00:16:57.329 --> 00:16:57.339
immediately means that you have contact
 

00:16:57.339 --> 00:16:58.710
immediately means that you have contact
with a particular member of the faculty

00:16:58.710 --> 00:16:58.720
with a particular member of the faculty
 

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:01.110
with a particular member of the faculty
and there may be a teaching assistant or

00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:01.120
and there may be a teaching assistant or

engineering school in terms of what's
 

00:31:05.650 --> 00:31:09.060
engineering school in terms of what's
available on the whole it's very similar

00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:09.070
available on the whole it's very similar

00:31:17.170 --> 00:31:19.740
abroad in the case of going abroad I
think a bit more challenging I don't

00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:19.750

differences but yeah I think the big

00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:28.720
differences but yeah I think the big
 

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:30.570
differences but yeah I think the big
probably the biggest single difference

00:31:30.570 --> 00:31:30.580
probably the biggest single difference
 

00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:33.780
probably the biggest single difference
is that the engineering school has more

00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:33.790
is that the engineering school has more
 

00:31:33.790 --> 00:31:37.020
is that the engineering school has more

00:35:29.930 --> 00:35:31.960
Mike I might see that student very
frequently then they get more

00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:31.970
frequently then they get more
 

00:35:31.970 --> 00:35:33.640

comfortable in terms of their major they

00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:33.650
comfortable in terms of their major they
 

00:35:33.650 --> 00:35:35.020

I've internalized at all about what
science is really about and the other

science is really about and the other
part of it is that you are exposing them

00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:20.470
part of it is that you are exposing them
 

00:38:20.470 --> 00:38:23.460
part of it is that you are exposing them
to much broader range of issues than

you should explore things you should you

00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:56.890
you should explore things you should you
 

00:38:56.890 --> 00:38:58.200
you should explore things you should you
should you know look at other

it's making a statement that the lots of
 

00:39:18.970 --> 00:39:20.940
it's making a statement that the lots of
options and what we try to do is to

00:39:20.940 --> 00:39:20.950
options and what we try to do is to
 

00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:22.440
options and what we try to do is to
expose them to many of their options

very well at the high school level and

00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:24.270
very well at the high school level and
 

00:41:24.270 --> 00:41:26.180
very well at the high school level and
science how does that work in terms of

00:41:26.180 --> 00:41:26.190
science how does that work in terms of
 

00:41:26.190 --> 00:41:27.920
science how does that work in terms of
placement how we support a student

00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:27.930
placement how we support a student

curricular Lee at the beginning okay so
 

00:41:30.059 --> 00:41:32.120
curricular Lee at the beginning okay so
the answer that is it normally works

00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:32.130
the answer that is it normally works
 

00:41:32.130 --> 00:41:34.190
the answer that is it normally works
through departments so if it was ap

00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:34.200
through departments so if it was ap
 

00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:35.780
through departments so if it was ap
chemistry then it would be up to the

00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:35.790
chemistry then it would be up to the
 

00:41:35.790 --> 00:41:37.130
chemistry then it would be up to the
chemistry department it would be up to

00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:37.140
chemistry department it would be up to
 

00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:38.780

studies and in some cases you simply say

00:41:41.329 --> 00:41:41.339
studies and in some cases you simply say
 

00:41:41.339 --> 00:41:43.940
studies and in some cases you simply say
well you've got an AP 5 and calculus bc

00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:43.950
well you've got an AP 5 and calculus bc
 

00:41:43.950 --> 00:41:46.309
well you've got an AP 5 and calculus bc
that then implies that you will do this

00:41:46.309 --> 00:41:46.319
that then implies that you will do this
 

00:41:46.319 --> 00:41:48.950
that then implies that you will do this
it'll imply what course you go into in

00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:48.960
it'll imply what course you go into in
 

00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:50.750
it'll imply what course you go into in
the physics department I believe we have

00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:50.760
the physics department I believe we have
 

00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:53.270
the physics department I believe we have
a physics faculty member here that there

00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:53.280
a physics faculty member here that there
 

00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:54.829
a physics faculty member here that there
are there are placement tests where the

00:41:54.829 --> 00:41:54.839
are there are placement tests where the
 

00:41:54.839 --> 00:41:57.559
are there are placement tests where the
student arrives in the fall and says I'm

00:41:57.559 --> 00:41:57.569
student arrives in the fall and says I'm
 

00:41:57.569 --> 00:41:59.900
student arrives in the fall and says I'm
a hotshot this and the student is asked

00:41:59.900 --> 00:41:59.910
a hotshot this and the student is asked
 

00:41:59.910 --> 00:42:01.730
a hotshot this and the student is asked
to take a little exam to find out just

00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:01.740
to take a little exam to find out just
 

00:42:01.740 --> 00:42:03.799
to take a little exam to find out just
how hot shot they really are and so

00:42:03.799 --> 00:42:03.809
how hot shot they really are and so
 

00:42:03.809 --> 00:42:06.230
how hot shot they really are and so
you're using these tools to plug them in

00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:06.240
you're using these tools to plug them in
 

00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:08.329
you're using these tools to plug them in
to the right level you're certainly not

00:42:08.329 --> 00:42:08.339
to the right level you're certainly not
 

00:42:08.339 --> 00:42:10.069
to the right level you're certainly not
wanting to waste their time on stuff

00:42:10.069 --> 00:42:10.079
wanting to waste their time on stuff
 

00:42:10.079 --> 00:42:13.640
wanting to waste their time on stuff
that they already know and the AP the

00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:13.650
that they already know and the AP the
 

00:42:13.650 --> 00:42:15.589
that they already know and the AP the
way the AP credit works is that he

00:42:15.589 --> 00:42:15.599
way the AP credit works is that he
 

00:42:15.599 --> 00:42:16.700
way the AP credit works is that he
doesn't mean they don't have a

00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:16.710
doesn't mean they don't have a
 

00:42:16.710 --> 00:42:18.410
doesn't mean they don't have a
requirement it means they simply plug in

00:42:18.410 --> 00:42:18.420
requirement it means they simply plug in
 

00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:19.910
requirement it means they simply plug in
at a different level and we're going to

00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:19.920
at a different level and we're going to
 

00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:21.230
at a different level and we're going to
celebrate the fact they've they've

00:42:21.230 --> 00:42:21.240
celebrate the fact they've they've
 

00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:23.180
celebrate the fact they've they've
gotten that ap five in calculus okay

00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:23.190
gotten that ap five in calculus okay
 

00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:24.920
gotten that ap five in calculus okay
let's go to the bank let's take you to

00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:24.930
let's go to the bank let's take you to
 

00:42:24.930 --> 00:42:26.480
let's go to the bank let's take you to
the next level right so that's the way

00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:26.490
the next level right so that's the way
 

00:42:26.490 --> 00:42:58.840
the next level right so that's the way
it works in practice

00:42:58.840 --> 00:42:58.850
 

00:42:58.850 --> 00:43:01.240
it's a great question question was if

00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:01.250
it's a great question question was if
 

00:43:01.250 --> 00:43:03.040
it's a great question question was if
your student has multiple interests in

00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:03.050
your student has multiple interests in
 

00:43:03.050 --> 00:43:05.290
your student has multiple interests in
the sciences or their interests might

00:43:05.290 --> 00:43:05.300
the sciences or their interests might
 

00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:07.360

like the cross section me what we call

00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:07.370
like the cross section me what we call
 

00:43:07.370 --> 00:43:10.210
like the cross section me what we call
the interdisciplinary sciences very good

00:43:10.210 --> 00:43:10.220
the interdisciplinary sciences very good
 

00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:12.070
the interdisciplinary sciences very good
question how we would support them in

00:43:12.070 --> 00:43:12.080
question how we would support them in
 

00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:13.360
question how we would support them in
those interests both in the classroom

00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:13.370
those interests both in the classroom
 

00:43:13.370 --> 00:43:16.930

summer in a chemistry lab and then you
 

00:43:46.070 --> 00:43:47.470
summer in a chemistry lab and then you
decide that this is absolutely what you

00:43:47.470 --> 00:43:47.480
decide that this is absolutely what you
 

00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:50.110

want to do or perhaps you decide maybe
 

00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:52.210

typically the students who've been
 

00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:16.680
typically the students who've been
involved in the research operation so

00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:16.690
involved in the research operation so
 

00:49:16.690 --> 00:49:19.010

you get to know them one-on-one and
 

00:49:19.020 --> 00:49:21.180
you get to know them one-on-one and
there are many elements to a graduate

00:49:21.180 --> 00:49:21.190
there are many elements to a graduate
 

00:49:21.190 --> 00:49:23.580
there are many elements to a graduate
school application but certainly the

00:49:23.580 --> 00:49:23.590
school application but certainly the
 

00:49:23.590 --> 00:49:26.040
school application but certainly the
personal statements a key one way you

00:49:26.040 --> 00:49:26.050
personal statements a key one way you
 

00:49:26.050 --> 00:49:27.390
personal statements a key one way you

tool the intellectual tools that like to
 

00:49:32.219 --> 00:49:34.249
tool the intellectual tools that like to
make your reticle candidate and then you

00:49:34.249 --> 00:49:34.259
make your reticle candidate and then you
 

00:49:34.259 --> 00:49:36.859
make your reticle candidate and then you
also have the benefit of having somebody

00:49:36.859 --> 00:49:36.869
also have the benefit of having somebody
 

00:49:36.869 --> 00:49:38.299
also have the benefit of having somebody
on the faculty who knows you very well

00:49:38.299 --> 00:49:38.309
on the faculty who knows you very well

00:50:30.709 --> 00:50:30.719
Michael because we all touch on this so
 

00:50:30.719 --> 00:50:32.900
Michael because we all touch on this so
in our office we have a graduate school

00:50:32.900 --> 00:50:32.910
in our office we have a graduate school
 

00:50:32.910 --> 00:50:35.509
in our office we have a graduate school
series and really where are where we

00:50:35.509 --> 00:50:35.519
series and really where are where we
 

00:50:35.519 --> 00:50:36.890
series and really where are where we
work with students is really helping

00:50:36.890 --> 00:50:36.900
work with students is really helping
 

00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:38.749
work with students is really helping
them to evaluate their decision to go to

00:50:38.749 --> 00:50:38.759
them to evaluate their decision to go to
 

00:50:38.759 --> 00:50:41.029
them to evaluate their decision to go to
graduate school and so we have a series

00:50:41.029 --> 00:50:41.039
graduate school and so we have a series
 

00:50:41.039 --> 00:50:42.109
graduate school and so we have a series
we're bringing a lot of people from

00:50:42.109 --> 00:50:42.119
we're bringing a lot of people from
 

00:50:42.119 --> 00:50:44.390
we're bringing a lot of people from
admissions to talk about what speaks to

00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:44.400
admissions to talk about what speaks to
 

00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:48.319
admissions to talk about what speaks to
them in application materials how to

00:50:48.319 --> 00:50:48.329
them in application materials how to
 

00:50:48.329 --> 00:50:50.239
them in application materials how to
prepare as you're going through from

00:50:50.239 --> 00:50:50.249
prepare as you're going through from
 

00:50:50.249 --> 00:50:53.120
prepare as you're going through from
first year on to build those

00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:53.130
first year on to build those
 

00:50:53.130 --> 00:50:55.189
first year on to build those
relationships to think about the

00:50:55.189 --> 00:50:55.199
relationships to think about the
 

00:50:55.199 --> 00:50:57.529
relationships to think about the
experiences that will enhance an

00:50:57.529 --> 00:50:57.539
experiences that will enhance an
 

00:50:57.539 --> 00:51:00.410
experiences that will enhance an
application and then we also rely on the

00:51:00.410 --> 00:51:00.420
application and then we also rely on the
 

00:51:00.420 --> 00:51:02.269
application and then we also rely on the
faculty would direct students to the

00:51:02.269 --> 00:51:02.279
faculty would direct students to the
 

00:51:02.279 --> 00:51:04.880
faculty would direct students to the
faculty to really talk about and their

00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:04.890
faculty to really talk about and their
 

00:51:04.890 --> 00:51:07.429
faculty to really talk about and their
interests and the programs that would be

00:51:07.429 --> 00:51:07.439
interests and the programs that would be
 

00:51:07.439 --> 00:51:10.130
interests and the programs that would be
best for them around the country and

00:51:10.130 --> 00:51:10.140
best for them around the country and
 

00:51:10.140 --> 00:51:12.769
best for them around the country and
internationally and our program we also

00:51:12.769 --> 00:51:12.779
internationally and our program we also
 

00:51:12.779 --> 00:51:14.390
internationally and our program we also
talked about funding opportunities but

00:51:14.390 --> 00:51:14.400
talked about funding opportunities but
 

00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:15.589
talked about funding opportunities but
we do that in partnership with the

00:51:15.589 --> 00:51:15.599
we do that in partnership with the
 

00:51:15.599 --> 00:51:17.599
we do that in partnership with the
Fellowship's office now hand it over to

00:51:17.599 --> 00:51:17.609
Fellowship's office now hand it over to
 

00:51:17.609 --> 00:51:20.509
Fellowship's office now hand it over to

about a body count of numbers who's one
 

00:51:44.020 --> 00:51:46.770
about a body count of numbers who's one
how many fellowships but rather the fact

00:51:46.770 --> 00:51:46.780
how many fellowships but rather the fact
 

00:51:46.780 --> 00:51:48.270
how many fellowships but rather the fact
that our students are more sophisticated

00:51:48.270 --> 00:51:48.280
that our students are more sophisticated
 

00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:50.520
that our students are more sophisticated
at the end of the process so that they

00:51:50.520 --> 00:51:50.530
at the end of the process so that they
 

00:51:50.530 --> 00:51:55.020
at the end of the process so that they
are able to successfully be persuasive

00:51:55.020 --> 00:51:55.030
are able to successfully be persuasive
 

00:51:55.030 --> 00:51:56.640
are able to successfully be persuasive
in a graduate school application or a

00:51:56.640 --> 00:51:56.650
in a graduate school application or a
 

00:51:56.650 --> 00:51:58.380
in a graduate school application or a
professional school application is very

00:51:58.380 --> 00:51:58.390
professional school application is very
 

00:51:58.390 --> 00:52:00.600
professional school application is very
important to us and to that end when

00:52:00.600 --> 00:52:00.610
important to us and to that end when
 

00:52:00.610 --> 00:52:02.040
important to us and to that end when
we're advising someone about a

00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:02.050
we're advising someone about a
 

00:52:02.050 --> 00:52:04.650
we're advising someone about a
fellowship opportunity we're also giving

fellowship opportunity we're also giving
 

00:52:04.660 --> 00:52:06.150
fellowship opportunity we're also giving
them the skills to know how to ask for

00:52:06.150 --> 00:52:06.160
them the skills to know how to ask for
 

00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:07.950
them the skills to know how to ask for
that letter of recommendation to know

00:52:07.950 --> 00:52:07.960
that letter of recommendation to know
 

00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:09.720
that letter of recommendation to know
what fellowship might be most

00:52:09.720 --> 00:52:09.730
what fellowship might be most
 

00:52:09.730 --> 00:52:11.700
what fellowship might be most
appropriate for what graduate program

00:52:11.700 --> 00:52:11.710
appropriate for what graduate program
 

00:52:11.710 --> 00:52:13.740
appropriate for what graduate program
have you talked to the faculty at that

00:52:13.740 --> 00:52:13.750
have you talked to the faculty at that
 

00:52:13.750 --> 00:52:15.630
have you talked to the faculty at that
school have you done the publishing that

00:52:15.630 --> 00:52:15.640
school have you done the publishing that
 

00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:17.820
school have you done the publishing that
you need to to be successful if we've

00:52:17.820 --> 00:52:17.830
you need to to be successful if we've
 

00:52:17.830 --> 00:52:19.920
you need to to be successful if we've
given them those tools then that's the

00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:19.930
given them those tools then that's the
 

00:52:19.930 --> 00:52:21.570
given them those tools then that's the
best the best kind of advising that we

00:52:21.570 --> 00:52:21.580
best the best kind of advising that we
 

00:52:21.580 --> 00:52:29.900
best the best kind of advising that we
can do

00:52:29.900 --> 00:52:29.910
 

00:52:29.910 --> 00:52:35.059
you

00:52:35.059 --> 00:52:35.069
 

00:52:35.069 --> 00:52:39.529
uh in Hampshire from again nothing's

00:52:39.529 --> 00:52:39.539
uh in Hampshire from again nothing's
 

00:52:39.539 --> 00:52:40.999
uh in Hampshire from again nothing's
mandatory Columbia so we have a

00:52:40.999 --> 00:52:41.009
mandatory Columbia so we have a
 

00:52:41.009 --> 00:52:43.880
mandatory Columbia so we have a
graduating student survey about well

00:52:43.880 --> 00:52:43.890
graduating student survey about well
 

00:52:43.890 --> 00:52:45.739
graduating student survey about well
this year its up but and I don't have

00:52:45.739 --> 00:52:45.749
this year its up but and I don't have
 

00:52:45.749 --> 00:52:46.939
this year its up but and I don't have
the results right now for this year

00:52:46.939 --> 00:52:46.949
the results right now for this year
 

00:52:46.949 --> 00:52:49.219
the results right now for this year
because it's still ongoing but generally

00:52:49.219 --> 00:52:49.229
because it's still ongoing but generally
 

00:52:49.229 --> 00:52:52.579
because it's still ongoing but generally
about thirty percent of the graduating

00:52:52.579 --> 00:52:52.589
about thirty percent of the graduating
 

00:52:52.589 --> 00:52:54.949
about thirty percent of the graduating
class go on to graduate school and they

00:52:54.949 --> 00:52:54.959
class go on to graduate school and they
 

00:52:54.959 --> 00:52:57.199
class go on to graduate school and they
would be a lot of the premier schools

00:52:57.199 --> 00:52:57.209
would be a lot of the premier schools
 

00:52:57.209 --> 00:52:59.299
would be a lot of the premier schools
around the country and that's right away

00:52:59.299 --> 00:52:59.309
around the country and that's right away
 

00:52:59.309 --> 00:53:01.789
around the country and that's right away
so more problems and then yeah we also

00:53:01.789 --> 00:53:01.799
so more problems and then yeah we also
 

00:53:01.799 --> 00:53:03.439
so more problems and then yeah we also
because again we work with alumni so

00:53:03.439 --> 00:53:03.449
because again we work with alumni so
 

00:53:03.449 --> 00:53:05.329
because again we work with alumni so
students may work for two to three years

00:53:05.329 --> 00:53:05.339
students may work for two to three years
 

00:53:05.339 --> 00:53:07.459
students may work for two to three years
and then say want to talk to you about I

00:53:07.459 --> 00:53:07.469
and then say want to talk to you about I
 

00:53:07.469 --> 00:53:08.870
and then say want to talk to you about I
really want to go back to grad school

00:53:08.870 --> 00:53:08.880
really want to go back to grad school
 

00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:15.339
really want to go back to grad school
can you help me with this decision sir

00:53:15.339 --> 00:53:15.349
 

00:53:15.349 --> 00:53:18.439
what percentage go to medical school I

00:53:18.439 --> 00:53:18.449
what percentage go to medical school I
 

00:53:18.449 --> 00:53:22.339
what percentage go to medical school I
can answer yeah if you are okay yeah do

00:53:22.339 --> 00:53:22.349
can answer yeah if you are okay yeah do
 

00:53:22.349 --> 00:53:23.859
can answer yeah if you are okay yeah do
you feel yeah sure just from

00:53:23.859 --> 00:53:23.869
you feel yeah sure just from
 

00:53:23.869 --> 00:53:25.549
you feel yeah sure just from
presentations with your with your

00:53:25.549 --> 00:53:25.559
presentations with your with your
 

00:53:25.559 --> 00:53:29.660
presentations with your with your
officer we're pretty in tune on the the

00:53:29.660 --> 00:53:29.670
officer we're pretty in tune on the the
 

00:53:29.670 --> 00:53:32.479
officer we're pretty in tune on the the
most recent statistics and it does seem

00:53:32.479 --> 00:53:32.489
most recent statistics and it does seem
 

00:53:32.489 --> 00:53:35.449
most recent statistics and it does seem
to keep getting better and better just a

00:53:35.449 --> 00:53:35.459
to keep getting better and better just a
 

00:53:35.459 --> 00:53:37.549
to keep getting better and better just a
couple of statistics in terms of sheer

00:53:37.549 --> 00:53:37.559
couple of statistics in terms of sheer
 

00:53:37.559 --> 00:53:39.859
couple of statistics in terms of sheer
volume you're talking about a couple

00:53:39.859 --> 00:53:39.869
volume you're talking about a couple
 

00:53:39.869 --> 00:53:41.569
volume you're talking about a couple
hundred students I believe but that

00:53:41.569 --> 00:53:41.579
hundred students I believe but that
 

00:53:41.579 --> 00:53:43.339
hundred students I believe but that
includes a couple of students who might

00:53:43.339 --> 00:53:43.349
includes a couple of students who might
 

00:53:43.349 --> 00:53:44.870
includes a couple of students who might
be recent alums they did teach for

00:53:44.870 --> 00:53:44.880
be recent alums they did teach for
 

00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:46.249
be recent alums they did teach for
america before applying to medical

00:53:46.249 --> 00:53:46.259
america before applying to medical
 

00:53:46.259 --> 00:53:48.499
america before applying to medical
school who I think successfully go on

00:53:48.499 --> 00:53:48.509
school who I think successfully go on
 

00:53:48.509 --> 00:53:52.039
school who I think successfully go on
per class to medical school but a good

00:53:52.039 --> 00:53:52.049
per class to medical school but a good
 

00:53:52.049 --> 00:53:53.390
per class to medical school but a good
portion of those students actually go on

00:53:53.390 --> 00:53:53.400
portion of those students actually go on
 

00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:55.849
portion of those students actually go on
for what our PhD MD programs joint

00:53:55.849 --> 00:53:55.859
for what our PhD MD programs joint
 

00:53:55.859 --> 00:53:58.519
for what our PhD MD programs joint
programs and so our acceptance rates for

00:53:58.519 --> 00:53:58.529
programs and so our acceptance rates for
 

00:53:58.529 --> 00:54:01.370
programs and so our acceptance rates for
us medical schools tends to be edging

00:54:01.370 --> 00:54:01.380
us medical schools tends to be edging
 

00:54:01.380 --> 00:54:03.410
us medical schools tends to be edging
towards that ninety percent and one of

00:54:03.410 --> 00:54:03.420
towards that ninety percent and one of
 

00:54:03.420 --> 00:54:04.609
towards that ninety percent and one of
the things that they asked us to

00:54:04.609 --> 00:54:04.619
the things that they asked us to
 

00:54:04.619 --> 00:54:06.559
the things that they asked us to
contextualize is that we do not limit

00:54:06.559 --> 00:54:06.569
contextualize is that we do not limit
 

00:54:06.569 --> 00:54:08.689
contextualize is that we do not limit
where students apply and our students

that keen and so it simply isn't an

that keen and so it simply isn't an
 

00:57:31.230 --> 00:57:32.569
that keen and so it simply isn't an
issue and nobody asks about it nobody

issue and nobody asks about it nobody

worries about it because they just get

worries about it because they just get
 

00:57:33.960 --> 00:57:35.180
worries about it because they just get
on with it and they have the experience

00:57:35.180 --> 00:57:35.190
on with it and they have the experience
 

00:57:35.190 --> 00:57:36.980
on with it and they have the experience
and that's you know if you think about a

00:57:36.980 --> 00:57:36.990
and that's you know if you think about a
 

00:57:36.990 --> 00:57:39.559

Columbia they take more credits as they

00:57:43.970 --> 00:57:43.980
Columbia they take more credits as they

might take laboratory courses they do
 

00:57:46.079 --> 00:57:48.770
might take laboratory courses they do
more in their time and so they end up

00:57:48.770 --> 00:57:48.780
more in their time and so they end up
 

00:57:48.780 --> 00:57:50.390
more in their time and so they end up
just kind of naturally having more

00:57:50.390 --> 00:57:50.400
just kind of naturally having more
 

00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:51.440
just kind of naturally having more
credits they're also particularly

they hit the ground running and can do
 

00:59:29.630 --> 00:59:31.809
they hit the ground running and can do
research right away but most of our

research right away but most of our
 

00:59:31.819 --> 00:59:33.460
research right away but most of our
scientists it's really I guess up to

you don't yet know very much so you

you don't yet know very much so you

you don't yet know very much so you
obviously less competitive than say a

obviously less competitive than say a
junior or senior and so it's not not

junior or senior and so it's not not
 

00:59:44.690 --> 00:59:46.180

quite so easy as you have more

percentage it may not be a terribly
 

00:59:54.349 --> 00:59:56.589
percentage it may not be a terribly
useful figure because then it's somehow

00:59:56.589 --> 00:59:56.599
useful figure because then it's somehow
 

00:59:56.599 --> 00:59:58.089

it's saying well these students don't

it's saying well these students don't
 

00:59:58.099 --> 00:59:59.319
it's saying well these students don't
