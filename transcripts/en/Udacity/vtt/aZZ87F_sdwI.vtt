00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.450
It might seem strange, but

00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:05.490
we should not solve problems like
the last one from left to right.

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.580
There's a set of rules we
call the order of operations

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.380
to help us with complicated
problems that have lots of terms.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.970
This should definitely
go in your notebook.

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.230
The order of operations tells us how
to solve problems in this order.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.800
First perform operations inside grouping
symbols, such as parentheses or

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:24.930
brackets.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.250
As a note there is an implied
grouping symbol for the numerator and

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:29.980
denominator of a fraction.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.100
You need to simplify the numerator and

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.960
denominator separately
before you do the division.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.830
Second, simplify exponents.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:43.000
Third, perform multiplication and
division from left to right.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.410
Fourth, perform addition and
subtraction from left to right.

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.140
Getting back to the problem Vanessa and
Pablo worked on, the reason that Vanessa

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.180
was correct was because she
multiplied first and then subtracted,

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.740
subtracted first and then multiplied,
or worked from left to right.

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.020
Please select the correct answer.
