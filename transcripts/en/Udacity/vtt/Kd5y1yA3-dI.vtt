00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.019
We have discussed that in
the encryption key should be a secret.

00:00:04.019 --> 00:00:06.470
What about the encryption
algorithm itself?

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.220
In general,
we should keep the algorithm open so

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:14.460
that it can be revealed and
improved by the broader community.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.680
More importantly,

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.320
we don't have to rely on the secrecy
of the algorithm for security.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.800
In other words, we don't have
to use obscurity for security.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.350
Therefore, in practice we should
always use the widely known and

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:31.670
deployed algorithms and standards.
