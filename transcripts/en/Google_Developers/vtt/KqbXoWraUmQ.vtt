00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.650
Next up, we've
got Noah Falstein.

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:04.660
He's a man who kind of
needs no introduction,

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:05.900
but that would be a cop out.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.262
So I'll introduce him.

00:00:07.262 --> 00:00:08.980
I could say things
like Lucasfilm,

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.250
Lucasfilm games, or a man who's
made arcade games for arcades,

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:15.100
Commodore 64, Dos Windows.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.480
He's done it all.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.060
And now he's the
Chief Game Designer

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.410
for the Android team at Google,
whatever that could mean.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.995
Noah Falstein!

00:00:24.995 --> 00:00:25.495
Hello?

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.195
Give me a moment to make
sure I'm presenting here.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.430
OK.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.310
I assume everybody
can hear that.

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.880
Can I see a wave of hands if
everyone can hear me fine?

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:46.430
Excellent.

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:47.630
Alright.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.380
Well, it's a real pleasure
to be here virtually.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.730
I had hoped to
join you in person,

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.490
but unfortunately
the timing from GDC,

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:02.350
where I gave this presentation
last week, was just too tight.

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.670
But it's nice to
be back-- on, well

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.790
I guess both sides of the
pond-- for the moment.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.360
So I've-- I'll
just dive in here.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.830
This is a talk I gave last
week at our Google Developers

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.780
Day at GDC.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.260
And it's an extended version.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.420
That was only about
15 minutes and I'm

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.656
going to go into a
little more depth here.

00:01:24.656 --> 00:01:27.870
I may not quite
take my full time,

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.520
but generally being a
little ahead of the schedule

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.120
is not such a bad thing
at these conferences,

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.900
particularly late in the day
as it is for you over there.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.060
So I'll be talking a bit
about evolution today, which

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.270
is appropriate because,
as has been said,

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.090
I'm something of a dinosaur
in the games industry.

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.300
I started professionally
making games in 1980,

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.330
and in fact had dabbled
at university as early

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:58.930
as four years before that.

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.280
So it's a very long time making
games and very pleasurable

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.090
really.

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.050
I have no complaints about that.

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.990
It's actually kind of fun
being an industry dinosaur.

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:15.095
You get to pontificate and
GDC becomes a great reunion.

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.525
But I'm going to actually
go even farther back

00:02:20.525 --> 00:02:24.570
than the dinosaur era, which
ended about 65 million years

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.590
ago with the asteroid
everybody has heard about.

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.010
In fact, I'm going to go back
to time around 540 million years

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.250
ago, something called
the Cambrian explosion.

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.490
And the picture
I'm showing now is

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.980
one of an artist's conception
of a lot of the sea creatures

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.070
that were found.

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:44.950
It was all sea
creatures at that point.

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.010
This was very, very
short in geological time

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.990
after multicellular
creatures first evolved.

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.540
And as you can see, there
are some really strange ones

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:56.060
out there.

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.770
In fact, pretty much
every single one

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.020
that has been found
in the Burgess Shale

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.370
where most of these
fossils came from

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.870
is just bizarre and
creepy to our eyes.

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.790
You can't quite see the details,
but one of my favorite ones

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:16.730
there is a little fellow who
has five eyes and a long tongue

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.320
that ends in a claw, and it just
looks like something somebody

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.720
did on some sort of drug trip.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.110
In fact, one of these creatures
is named Hallucinogena

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:28.420
because of that.

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.440
At any rate, the
point I want to make

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.310
is that pretty
much as soon as it

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.820
was possible for
multicellular life to spread,

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.310
it spread into just
a wide profusion

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.920
in every ecological niche.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:46.040
And that's a lesson that I
think has a lot of relevance

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.340
for us, because it
spread out, there

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:50.690
were many different
types of creatures.

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.510
And then perhaps it
was another asteroid,

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.460
perhaps some other kind
of disaster wiped out,

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:59.080
I believe, about 80%
or 90% of those life

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.030
forms in a very short time.

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.630
And then the ones that
remained evolved, spread,

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.420
moved into new
ecological niches,

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:11.500
and eventually also came out
on to land and became us.

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.230
This kind of rise
and fall of eras

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.180
has happened many
times geologically.

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.899
And in fact, it's very similar,
I think, in a lot of ways

00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:22.530
to what we've seen in
the games industry.

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.500
I'm old enough to remember
Pong when that was new,

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.265
and even before that Nolan
Bushnell's Computer Space

00:04:29.265 --> 00:04:31.200
game that I thought
was the coolest thing

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.820
I'd ever seen when I first was
a teenager going into an arcade.

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.120
I was expecting mechanical
pinball ballgames only,

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.090
and suddenly here was
this sleek cabinet

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.730
with this wonderful-- well, I
should draw a picture of it,

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.765
but you should
take a look at it.

00:04:46.765 --> 00:04:49.320
It was well ahead of
time, and in fact he

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.110
went to do Pong afterwards
because it was so far

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.240
ahead of its time, no
one was ready for it.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.660
And that's a lesson we
can learn from as well.

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:01.850
But just as with the
physical evolutionary rise

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.690
and fall, we've seen that in
the games industry many times.

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:08.280
And when I was
doing arcade games,

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.190
I worked on a game called
Sinistar many years ago,

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:14.070
and within a year of it
coming out, almost 90%

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:17.390
of the audience for arcade
games had just given up.

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:21.830
It was a very quick fad that
faded, and happily consoles

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:26.540
and PC games quickly
rose to take its place.

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:28.690
Recently, we've had
similar kinds of us

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:32.170
and downs with the social
revolution and 100 million

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:34.990
people playing a
game on Facebook

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:37.700
or on other social services.

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:41.900
We've had that same kind of
rise of indie developers.

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:45.536
I asked this at
GDC and nearly 2/3

00:05:45.536 --> 00:05:47.785
of the audience considered
themselves indie developers

00:05:47.785 --> 00:05:49.540
of one sort or another.

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.680
Just a few years earlier,
that was quite a rarity.

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.850
And of course, we've
seen with the huge rise

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:57.660
in mobile coming almost out
of nowhere over the last five

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:58.650
years or so.

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:00.620
I have friends who were
working on mobile games

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:05.890
10 or 15 years ago, struggling
in the era at that point,

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:08.640
before-- much like the
Cambrian explosion-- suddenly

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.530
smart phones made it possible
to have all sorts of great games

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:13.150
out there.

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:14.990
So, what does that bring us to?

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:19.710
Well, this is a cliche, but the
Chinese character for crisis

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:23.860
is made up of the characters
for danger and opportunity

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:24.920
together.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:27.540
And it's just a
wonderful metaphor,

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:29.590
and I'm going to deconstruct
that a little bit.

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:31.850
I think it's still
quite relevant,

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:34.950
even if it is a bit of a cliche.

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:37.590
First, what's the
danger involved?

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:42.030
Well I think the real concern
is that a lot of things

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:43.060
are coming to an end.

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:46.370
I talked about cycles, and
it's easy to talk about cycles

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:49.970
from a calm,
long-term perspective.

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:51.856
But if you're the
dinosaur caught up

00:06:51.856 --> 00:06:54.320
in an extension as
this fellow here,

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:58.150
who's actually just
about half a mile

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:02.330
from me over that main buildings
in the Google campus here,

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:04.990
then it can be a pretty
terrifying thing.

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:09.680
And really a lot
of people believe

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:13.060
that this might be our
last big console cycle,

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:17.690
that the PS4 or the Xbox1,
these are-- that we're never

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:22.020
going to see a big expensive
dedicated console again.

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:23.770
Personally, I'm not
quite sure of that.

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:25.811
You know, one thing that
my experience has taught

00:07:25.811 --> 00:07:29.140
me is that it's really hard
to predict exactly what will

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:32.510
happen, and we've been
surprised many times before.

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:36.100
And yet I have to agree that
there are many reasons why

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:39.510
I think that's a possibility,
and personally I'm

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:42.070
a bit relieved not to
be betting everything

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:45.110
I have on not only
the next consoles,

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:46.950
but on one particular console.

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:50.350
That's always a really nervous,
nerve wracking place to be in.

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:54.397
And I'm sure some of you
have experienced that.

00:07:54.397 --> 00:07:56.230
Another thing that
concerns a lot of people.

00:07:56.230 --> 00:08:00.160
I talked about social games
having 100 million users,

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:03.370
and largely a lot of users
have moved over to mobile now.

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:05.660
And even mobile seems
to be getting crowded.

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:08.780
The future for that is
also a little bit murky.

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:10.650
But there were many
of my friends who

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:13.280
were at Zynga and
Playdom a few years ago,

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:16.140
and virtually all of them
have left those companies.

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:20.080
In fact, most being made
redundant at some point.

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:23.280
So it's pretty scary
to see that coming,

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:26.520
and to-- being and seeming
like the big new thing,

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:28.450
and then within
just a year or two

00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:30.520
have it seem like
the yesterday's news.

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:33.159
It's a very scary
thing that way.

00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:34.580
Some other dangers.

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:37.900
The cost for mobile development,
as with almost every new area,

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:39.070
is climbing.

00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:41.140
Competition's quite
fierce, and it's really

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:44.510
driven up the
lowest stakes there.

00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:47.190
If you really want to
compete in a mobile game now,

00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:48.970
you need very high
production quality,

00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:51.710
and of course that means
longer time and more money

00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:53.030
to produce things.

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:55.610
It is still possible, you
get your little Flappy Bird

00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:59.020
successes that-- little in
terms of development costs

00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:02.050
and big in terms of
income-- but of course,

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:03.760
that becomes rarer
and rarer when

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:05.600
you look at the huge
numbers of people

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.630
trying to get into
that industry.

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:11.440
So that's a bit of
a cause for anxiety,

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:13.890
if not necessarily
doom and gloom.

00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:18.150
And it's not all
technology or game type,

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:21.250
it's also the business
model that's been disrupted.

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:24.560
Free to play surprised a lot
of people, myself as well,

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:26.590
in not just that
it was successful.

00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:28.230
It didn't surprise
me that it was

00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:31.300
one possibility that
worked quite well.

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:37.090
But just like the four limb
model of humans, and primates,

00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:40.810
and for that matter mammals,
amphibians and birds,

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:42.405
you know, so many
of our creatures

00:09:42.405 --> 00:09:45.260
have pretty similar
kind of structure.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.490
And it seems that free to
play is likewise spreading out

00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:51.620
to become by far the
most popular way to do

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:54.670
mobile games these days,
at least for monetization.

00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:57.790
Similarly, digital
distribution and rentals

00:09:57.790 --> 00:09:59.630
are causing a lot
of people concern

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:01.410
and opening up
opportunities for others.

00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:04.530
So none of this is new, but
you take it all together,

00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:05.860
it's pretty scary.

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:09.010
And there's also, of course,
an ever increasing choice

00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:10.300
of hardware.

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:13.970
Just so many different
platforms out there in addition

00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:16.460
to the big consoles and PC.

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:19.250
You now have
microconsoles, you have

00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:22.270
lots of head-mounted
displays, everything

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:25.580
from full virtual reality that
we've seen from Sony or Oculus

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:31.950
Rift, to gadgets like this one
here that are becoming popular.

00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:34.836
It's actually amazingly
stylish around where

00:10:34.836 --> 00:10:37.410
I am at the moment.

00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:41.570
So let's move on to some of
the positive side of that.

00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:46.060
There's really a lot
of opportunity as well.

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:49.330
I think the way to look at this
is that boundaries are really

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:51.800
breaking down everywhere
at this point,

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:54.690
and that can be a scary
thing, but it really

00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:58.380
opens up lots of new territory,
lots of new possibility.

00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:01.020
So to start with, I
don't think we've ever

00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:03.740
had a more lucrative time
in all of my history.

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:06.650
Certainly, the industry is
making more money as a whole

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:08.850
than it ever did before.

00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:10.880
As early as about
10 years ago, people

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:13.560
were trumpeting that games were
finally making as much money

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:17.080
as movies, and usually they
have to compare the best games

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:21.570
to studio box office, and not
talk about video rentals or all

00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:24.620
the other ways that the
movie industry cashed.

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:26.710
But increasingly, it's
just becoming simply true

00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:31.150
that games are more lucrative
than film, and not only that,

00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:33.460
but show every
sign of continuing

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:36.910
to spread if you look at games
as a whole, combination of all

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:39.820
of the different types
of games out there.

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:43.050
It's also, and I think this
is even more encouraging,

00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:45.062
never been more
popular and widespread.

00:11:45.062 --> 00:11:48.570
You know this is a
matter of global reach.

00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:49.500
I travel a lot.

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:51.700
I really enjoy speaking
around the world,

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:55.995
and it's amazing to me how even
tiny countries with population

00:11:55.995 --> 00:11:58.370
of 1 or 2 million
people sometimes

00:11:58.370 --> 00:12:01.240
have 2 or 3 different game
development companies in them.

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:04.390
And of course, many
other places like the UK

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:06.880
or the US that have been
doing it a long time,

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:10.650
it's just hard to count the
number of small and even

00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:12.940
medium and large
developers out there.

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:17.140
So lots of widespread
development.

00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:20.080
Lots of widespread game
playing, and not just

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:22.940
in terms of where in the world,
but also who in the world

00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:24.110
is playing.

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:27.180
We have younger people playing
in some times than ever before.

00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:31.090
Tablets certainly have
become a huge thing with kids

00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:33.930
even younger than 2 years old.

00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:37.240
And brain games, an area
that I work in some,

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:39.280
is becoming increasingly
popular with people

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:40.500
in their 70s and 80s.

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:42.612
You know, areas that we
never really expected

00:12:42.612 --> 00:12:44.195
were going to be big
for game playing,

00:12:44.195 --> 00:12:47.150
and yet have become quite
vital in some areas.

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:50.320
Japan, I think, at the height
of some of the Brain game boom

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:53.750
had over 80 different types
of Brain games on the market,

00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:57.420
and many of them
were quite popular.

00:12:57.420 --> 00:13:00.770
It's also, as I say with
Brain games, increasingly

00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:01.620
consequential.

00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:04.875
One of the things that I've also
done before coming to Google

00:13:04.875 --> 00:13:08.960
was work in the serious games
or games for impact area,

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:11.650
where the games have a purpose
besides just entertainment.

00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:13.570
And there's nothing
wrong with entertainment,

00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:16.620
I think it's a great
purpose in itself.

00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:21.030
If anybody, by the way, ever
is making games that are fun

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:25.540
and feels a need to kind of
revitalize their enthusiasm

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:27.980
for just doing
something that's fun,

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:30.470
I'd recommend a movie
called Sullivan's Travels

00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:32.040
from the 1940s.

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:34.940
I'm just curious, I can
see most of you there.

00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:39.440
How many people have seen
this movie Sullivan's Travels?

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:39.940
Anyone?

00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:42.780
OK, it looks like not many
hands, and not surprising.

00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:45.180
1940s films aren't
that popular, but I

00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:47.290
used to work with a
fellow named Hal Barwood.

00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:51.550
We created Indiana Jones and
The Fate of Atlantis together.

00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:56.520
And Hal as a filmmaker, actually
co-wrote, as a ghostwriter,

00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:58.690
Close Encounters of
The Third Kind and

00:13:58.690 --> 00:14:02.920
worked on half a dozen feature
films that I quite enjoy.

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:06.480
So he told me about
Sullivan's Travels.

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:09.930
It's a black and white
film, but a really good one

00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:12.070
if you're feeling a
little bit in need

00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:13.880
of encouragement about fun.

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:17.570
And yet, beyond fun, games
are helping certainly

00:14:17.570 --> 00:14:21.020
in the medical area, they're
helping diagnose and treat

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:23.540
people with brain
injury and trauma.

00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:28.350
They're helping train
surgeons and medical people

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:29.350
of all types.

00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:31.760
But beyond that,
there's training

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:35.800
and social interactions in
games that are helping people,

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:40.350
for example, with autism
learn how to better interact

00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:42.850
with their peers.

00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:45.280
Lots of really exciting
games out there.

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:47.960
I'll be speaking at the
Games For Change conference

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:49.940
next month about
some of these things.

00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:51.760
So that's pretty exciting.

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:55.460
And we've never quite been
so connected in so many ways.

00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:57.830
There are more and
more screens out there.

00:14:57.830 --> 00:15:01.700
I've got lots of tablets at
home-- of course, some of that

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:05.640
is just because Google tends to
shower us with devices to test.

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:07.520
But even before I
joined the company,

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:09.300
they were starting
to proliferate.

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:12.930
And we're also connecting
in different ways.

00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:15.590
This is a picture from
a project I worked on

00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:18.010
with Dr. Adam Gazzaley.

00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:21.530
He was doing a game
called NeuroRacer

00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:23.700
that I had a small hand.

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:25.510
Recently, it got on
the Journal of Nature,

00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:28.370
a very prestigious
science journal.

00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:30.690
First time that the
journal-- actually, I

00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:32.440
think any major
science journal-- has

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:34.090
had a video game on the cover.

00:15:34.090 --> 00:15:36.360
But it's proven
to be a great way

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:38.830
to actually improve
people's ability

00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:41.010
to multitask while driving.

00:15:41.010 --> 00:15:43.350
Not driving and
texting, but being

00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:46.870
able to drive and
also see road signs

00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:49.540
and respond to those
sorts of inputs, which

00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:51.850
tends to deteriorate
as people get older.

00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:54.430
And yet with game
training, it's shown

00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:57.670
that not only can 70 and 80
year olds get back to the levels

00:15:57.670 --> 00:15:59.780
that they were when
they were 20 or 30--

00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:02.530
and this is measured
through a combination of EEG

00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:05.720
that you're seeing
there, and fMRI.

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:09.260
But they also retain those
gains six months later,

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:10.760
which is just quite
remarkably, even

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:12.310
without playing
the game anymore.

00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:16.250
So a lot of things games are
doing to both connect directly

00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:19.730
to our brains and
also to help people

00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:22.390
in really consequential ways.

00:16:22.390 --> 00:16:24.930
We've never been on so many
different devices and screens,

00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:26.580
I mentioned that before.

00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:29.960
Google has also announced
initiatives for wearables,

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:34.060
for an automotive initiative
to plug Android devices

00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:36.840
into displays in cars.

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:39.384
Of course, Google
Glass, and there

00:16:39.384 --> 00:16:41.400
have been announcements
of watches coming out

00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:42.660
in the near future.

00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:44.160
All of this is
really in our future.

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:47.600
This has actually been a
really useful device for me.

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:49.390
I started testing
it, and have been

00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:52.570
amazed at how handy
is to have around,

00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:54.850
and there's some really
fun games that our New York

00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:57.890
office made that are
on there as well.

00:16:57.890 --> 00:16:59.180
And, so what else?

00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:02.320
Games have never really been
analyzed in as much depth

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:04.990
as they have by universities
all over the place.

00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:06.630
So we really
understand how games

00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:10.410
work, how they affect our
brains, how games have evolved,

00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:13.460
and how we have
evolved to want to play

00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:17.319
from even pre-history,
before we were human.

00:17:17.319 --> 00:17:19.640
Anyone who has puppies
or kittens at home

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:24.690
can see that play is a way that
young of many species learn.

00:17:24.690 --> 00:17:28.930
And in general, I think
this is a positive thing.

00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:31.330
But of course, it can
cause some anxiety

00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:33.810
as well because I've
just talked about all

00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:36.350
of these exciting things
and I'm willing to bet

00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:39.260
that the large majority
of you have only

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:42.540
focused on one or two
of these different areas

00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:44.880
with all these new
technologies coming out.

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:46.430
There's just so
much out there now,

00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:48.390
it's pretty much
impossible for anyone

00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:51.650
to go into any depth across
the whole breadth of all

00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:53.240
these things out there.

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:55.090
So what can you do?

00:17:55.090 --> 00:18:00.780
Well, again I like to take some
cues from physical evolution.

00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:03.510
After the dinosaurs,
as we all know,

00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:06.670
a little mammal starting
with shrew-like creatures

00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:10.340
like this little fellow
here, proliferated,

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:14.000
grew much larger, moved into
various ecological niches,

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.500
and in many ways
were able to spread

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:19.180
much farther than dinosaurs
did, and certainly

00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:22.675
deal with a much wider range of
temperatures and environments.

00:18:22.675 --> 00:18:24.550
And that's happened, as
I said, over and over

00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:26.280
in the games industry.

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:29.260
So what we can learn from
that is if you're flexible

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:32.090
and you embrace change,
it's a winning strategy

00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:33.820
pretty much every time.

00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:37.140
In fact, the whole
cliche of dinosaurs,

00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:39.730
if you think about
it, is sticking

00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:42.160
with the same sort of thing,
getting bigger and bigger

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:45.300
without regard to the fact that
you're getting more vulnerable,

00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:48.010
even as you're getting
more powerful sometimes.

00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:50.940
So another point, though,
is that even though I'm

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:54.340
using this analogy, we can
actually change much faster

00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:56.790
than actual physical
evolution that takes place

00:18:56.790 --> 00:18:58.350
over millions of years.

00:18:58.350 --> 00:19:02.450
We don't have to wait to
have the fittest survive.

00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:05.080
We can see something
that works and graph

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:06.880
those changes into
our games, as has

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:10.040
happened with lightning rapidity
for things like free to play

00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:12.920
pricing, or the
growth of social,

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:14.609
mobile, any of these trends.

00:19:14.609 --> 00:19:16.275
We're actually getting
faster and faster

00:19:16.275 --> 00:19:18.540
at adopting new
trends, and I think

00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:20.220
that's very encouraging,
because being

00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:25.540
able to be as flexible as
that is a really good thing.

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:28.890
And Google, I think,
is in a great position

00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:30.890
to help developers with this.

00:19:30.890 --> 00:19:33.000
I don't know of any
other company that

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.340
is involved in as
many different things

00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:38.680
and, as I'm sure you've seen in
your presentations there today,

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:41.940
this company is really committed
to helping game developers.

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:44.490
I've been with the company
for about a year now

00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:47.070
and it's been a
real pleasure to see

00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:49.830
how much game development
was actually going on.

00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:53.320
Sorry about that.

00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:55.060
Should have shut those down.

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:57.220
How much game development
is going on at Google

00:19:57.220 --> 00:20:00.380
in many different ways,
but I've been getting

00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:02.830
involved more and more
with all sorts of new ways

00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:05.000
that Google is
getting into games.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.595
And games are one
of those things that

00:20:06.595 --> 00:20:09.070
can spread through every
type of technology.

00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:11.880
And as you can see with a lot
of the presentations you've

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:14.840
seen today, Google is into
helping at every stage,

00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:17.450
from the early
production and research,

00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:19.710
to understanding how
to build the games

00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:22.510
and giving you support
for Android, Chrome,

00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:24.980
you know lot of different
platforms out there,

00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:26.900
all the way through
getting out it there

00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:28.830
getting, getting
your game recognized,

00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:31.210
and getting it monetized
through advertising

00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:35.250
or whatever method is
that you choose to use.

00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:37.760
Google is into so
many different things.

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:40.380
And as I said, I think every
one of the things that I've

00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:42.590
got listed up here
has game potential.

00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:47.310
And I'm with a group, by the
way-- our name within Google

00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:50.710
is the Fun Propulsion Labs, and
you'll be hearing more about us

00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:53.050
in the fairly near
future-- but we're

00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:57.530
very interested in the range
and breadth of what Google

00:20:57.530 --> 00:21:00.750
is interested in, and
seeing if we can apply games

00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:02.300
to many of these
different areas,

00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:05.320
as well as help you, the
game developer community,

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:08.220
by making our tools
for game development

00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:10.730
as good as possible.

00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:14.700
So, I'm going to conclude with
a little bit about the future.

00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:18.810
I hesitate, as I said before,
to be too positive because there

00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:19.970
is no one future.

00:21:19.970 --> 00:21:22.280
One of the things I've learned
about the games industry

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:24.610
that I love about it,
is that there are many,

00:21:24.610 --> 00:21:26.650
many different possible futures.

00:21:26.650 --> 00:21:28.660
This is a wonderful
industry if you're

00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:31.290
open to change and
reinventing yourself.

00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:33.210
And they're just--
you never get bored.

00:21:33.210 --> 00:21:35.950
There's always new stuff
coming out, and never more

00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:37.510
than in the last few years.

00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:40.230
In my 35 or so years
in game development,

00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:42.540
this is just an
extraordinary time.

00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:46.630
So here are some suggestions of
what I think will work for you.

00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:48.620
You need to be open
minded, because it's

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:50.990
so hard to see where the
next hit will come from.

00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:53.840
You need to be willing
to adapt and see

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:55.310
what new trends there are.

00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:57.569
And that's easier to
say than it is to do.

00:21:57.569 --> 00:22:00.110
Sometimes it's hard to tell the
difference between a fad that

00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:02.370
will burn out quickly
and a new trend that's

00:22:02.370 --> 00:22:04.850
coming along to stay.

00:22:04.850 --> 00:22:09.470
For example, virtual
reality was a big topic back

00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:12.320
in the late '80s when
I first experienced it,

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:14.660
and the technology just
wasn't quite there yet.

00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:17.680
It's coming on very strong
now, and it feels to me

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:20.330
like it's going to be
very solid this time.

00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:21.940
And yet, I know
of a lot of people

00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:25.850
who get physically ill when
they put on a virtual reality

00:22:25.850 --> 00:22:28.690
unit of even some
of the best quality.

00:22:28.690 --> 00:22:30.640
So, hard one to bet on.

00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:33.080
But, stay open
minded means that,

00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:35.190
hey even if a third of
the people can't use it,

00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:37.430
that still leaves a
huge number of people

00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:41.210
out there who might
find it very worthwhile.

00:22:41.210 --> 00:22:43.820
Think globally in
all senses of that.

00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:45.870
You know, certainly in
other parts of the world,

00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:49.700
there's huge growth
in Asia in particular.

00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:52.880
I expect places like Africa,
places that we don't really

00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:55.880
anticipate these days
as huge game market,

00:22:55.880 --> 00:23:00.320
but that could grow to become
them in the fairly near future.

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:03.180
And also in established
markets, there

00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:07.430
are sometimes new blue
oceans of new technologies

00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:09.960
that are going to spread
and become very popular.

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:12.700
When you see how smart
phones have taken over

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:16.510
in Europe, and the US, or
really all around the world,

00:23:16.510 --> 00:23:20.390
from very quick beginnings
not that many years ago.

00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:22.690
You don't want to discount
even established markets

00:23:22.690 --> 00:23:25.290
for having mew areas to go into.

00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:28.370
And personally, I would
suggest each of you

00:23:28.370 --> 00:23:29.910
look to compete in
areas that you're

00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:31.243
strong in, that you are good at.

00:23:31.243 --> 00:23:33.990
Each of you out there, I'm
sure, has your own abilities,

00:23:33.990 --> 00:23:36.100
your own strong points.

00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:38.630
Some of the stuff out there,
as attractive as it is,

00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:41.130
won't be right for
you, for your company,

00:23:41.130 --> 00:23:43.910
for you as an individual.

00:23:43.910 --> 00:23:45.660
And other things will
be perfect for you

00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:48.720
with the background you
have, the interests you have.

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:50.710
Go with your passion,
go with your interests,

00:23:50.710 --> 00:23:53.590
and go with your strengths,
and it's hard to go wrong,

00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:56.626
even if there is a
downturn in the industry.

00:23:56.626 --> 00:23:58.500
If you've done something
that you're good at,

00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:00.610
and that's you're
proud of, then I

00:24:00.610 --> 00:24:03.390
think that you'll
be in good shape.

00:24:03.390 --> 00:24:04.790
And hand in hand
with that-- this

00:24:04.790 --> 00:24:07.310
is a really strong
philosophy here at Google--

00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:09.850
you want to be
agile and iterative.

00:24:09.850 --> 00:24:14.320
It's important, I think, to
fail fast, to try new things.

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:16.595
We see this on the
game design side

00:24:16.595 --> 00:24:18.550
all the time with
paper prototyping

00:24:18.550 --> 00:24:20.940
and other fast
computer prototyping,

00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:23.170
as by far the best way,
instead of coming up

00:24:23.170 --> 00:24:26.230
with a detailed plan,
a 100 page design doc,

00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:28.620
[INAUDIBLE] of that design
doc, and then consider

00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:30.670
whether this is
actually any fun or not.

00:24:30.670 --> 00:24:32.170
That really doesn't
work, you really

00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:37.210
need to be agile and
iterate very quickly.

00:24:37.210 --> 00:24:40.470
And in a similar sense,
you want to diversify

00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:43.500
as much as is practical,
even if it's just

00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:45.930
a little bit, because
sometimes teams are small

00:24:45.930 --> 00:24:47.970
and they can't afford
much diversity.

00:24:47.970 --> 00:24:51.280
But better to have one
main thing you're doing

00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:52.980
and one small side
project that could

00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:56.390
grow than to only put all
your eggs in one basket

00:24:56.390 --> 00:25:01.490
and be stuck if that basket
drops and you're out of luck.

00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:02.865
I know of a lot
of game companies

00:25:02.865 --> 00:25:04.990
that have gone under
because they bet everything

00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:08.700
on one throw of the dice,
and often through a funding

00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:12.600
change or some circumstances
totally beyond our control,

00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:14.290
it didn't work out well.

00:25:14.290 --> 00:25:17.220
The companies that have had
several things going on at once

00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:19.740
are the ones that, much like
the little mammals going

00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:25.060
into new slots, new ecological
slots, were able to succeed.

00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:27.440
Another thing that I would
say that I've learned here

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:29.960
at Google and is
definitely true, is

00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:31.760
don't bet against the Internet.

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:35.740
I was skeptical about some
always online, multiplayer

00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:39.630
concepts because of times that
I would travel and be on a plane

00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:40.610
without internet.

00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:43.376
And a recent
international trip I had

00:25:43.376 --> 00:25:44.750
was the first one
I went on where

00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:47.370
they had internet
available the whole time.

00:25:47.370 --> 00:25:49.360
It's getting harder and
harder to find places

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:51.990
where there isn't good
internet availability.

00:25:51.990 --> 00:25:55.250
And even if you can still
come up with circumstances

00:25:55.250 --> 00:25:57.755
where that's a problem
now, it's a pretty good bet

00:25:57.755 --> 00:26:00.110
that in the future--
probably the near future--

00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:02.950
it will increasingly become
less and less of a problem,

00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:04.780
and speeds will go up as well.

00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:08.450
So taking advantage of that
is always a safe thing.

00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:12.870
And finally, I'd say Google
really wants to help with this.

00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:15.550
This is a company that
I'm very happy to say

00:26:15.550 --> 00:26:17.650
can benefit indirectly.

00:26:17.650 --> 00:26:24.350
We don't have to focus so much
on the kinds of direct revenue

00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:28.280
models that I was used to as
an independent game developer

00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:31.310
because it helps us if the
whole industry prospers.

00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:33.970
And we hope that we'll be
able to help you prosper,

00:26:33.970 --> 00:26:36.570
because it'll really
be the rising tide that

00:26:36.570 --> 00:26:40.630
helps all boats, if I can
add one more cliche in there.

00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:42.060
So that's it.

00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:47.170
This is my contact
information, my email address

00:26:47.170 --> 00:26:49.120
and Twitter feed.

00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:51.520
I'm also happy to connect
with people on LinkedIn,

00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:54.200
but please don't send
a generic response.

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:58.370
Just tell me even if it's
simply that you saw me

00:26:58.370 --> 00:27:01.860
through this
presentation, that's fine.

00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:05.570
And I don't know if I'm
equipped to take questions

00:27:05.570 --> 00:27:08.870
at the moment, but I don't
think there's much time,

00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:12.460
so let's cut it off at that,
and thank you very much.

00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:15.770
Thank you very much, Noah.

00:27:15.770 --> 00:27:17.754
It was great that you
could join us here today.

00:27:17.754 --> 00:27:19.420
