00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:04.793
As you probably know,

00:00:04.793 --> 00:00:09.260
the Georgia Tech OMS CS program is
developed in partnership with Udacity.

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.517
All the course lecture materials as
well as interactive exercises and

00:00:13.517 --> 00:00:16.800
some projects are available
through Udacity.com.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.920
Some classes put additional information
like syllabi, calendars, and

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.950
assignment information
on Udacity.com too.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.670
In many ways, Udacity is like the
textbook for the courses you're taking.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.549
So, we'll talk about access and
course materials through Udacity.

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:35.300
The kinds of material you
should expect to find, and

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.000
some of the interactive elements
provided through Udacity.
