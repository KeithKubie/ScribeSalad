00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.111
Today, once again,
a day of solving no

00:00:03.111 --> 00:00:05.886
differential equations
whatsoever.

00:00:05.886 --> 00:00:10.259
The topic is a special kind of
differential equation,

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:13.622
which occurs a lot.
It's one in which the

00:00:13.622 --> 00:00:18.584
right-hand side doesn't have any
independent variable in it.

00:00:18.584 --> 00:00:23.209
Now, since I'm going to use as
the independent variable,

00:00:23.209 --> 00:00:28.086
t for time, maybe it would be
better to write the left-hand

00:00:28.086 --> 00:00:32.038
side to let you know,
since you won't be able to

00:00:32.038 --> 00:00:37.000
figure out any other way what it
is, dy dt.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.955
We will write it this time.
dy dt is equal to,

00:00:42.955 --> 00:00:50.632
and the point is that there is
no t on the right hand side.

00:00:50.632 --> 00:00:56.323
So, there's no t.
There's a name for such an

00:00:56.323 --> 00:01:01.352
equation.
Now, some people call it time

00:01:01.352 --> 00:01:07.189
independent.
The only problem with that is

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:12.579
that sometimes the independent
variable is a time.

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:17.640
It's something else.
We need a generic word for

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:24.019
there being no independent
variable on the right-hand side.

00:01:24.019 --> 00:01:29.189
So, the word that's used for
that is autonomous.

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:37.000
So, that means no independent
variable on the right-hand side.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.770
It's a function of y alone,
the dependent variable.

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.969
Now, your first reaction should
be, oh, well,

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:47.687
big deal.
Big deal.

00:01:47.687 --> 00:01:53.030
If there's no t on the right
hand side, then we can solve

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:58.374
this by separating variables.
So, why has he been talking

00:01:58.374 --> 00:02:03.385
about it in the first place?
So, I admit that.

00:02:03.385 --> 00:02:07.625
We can separate variables,
and what I'm going to talk

00:02:07.625 --> 00:02:12.760
about today is how to get useful
information out of the equation

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.407
about how its solutions look
without solving the equation.

00:02:17.407 --> 00:02:21.483
The reason for wanting to do
that is, A, it's fast.

00:02:21.483 --> 00:02:25.885
It gives you a lot of insight,
and the actual solution,

00:02:25.885 --> 00:02:29.065
I'll illustrate one,
in the first place,

00:02:29.065 --> 00:02:35.321
take you quite a while.
You may not be able to actually

00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:40.678
do the integrations,
the required and separation of

00:02:40.678 --> 00:02:47.107
variables to get an explicit
solution, or it might simply not

00:02:47.107 --> 00:02:53.642
be worth the effort of doing if
you only want certain kinds of

00:02:53.642 --> 00:02:58.785
separations about the solution.
So, the thing is,

00:02:58.785 --> 00:03:03.500
the problem is,
therefore, to get qualitative

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:11.000
information about the solutions
without actually solving --

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.762
Without actually having to
solve the equation.

00:03:14.762 --> 00:03:18.607
Now, to do that,
let's take a quick look at how

00:03:18.607 --> 00:03:22.871
the direction fields of such an
equation, after all,

00:03:22.871 --> 00:03:27.636
it's the direction field is our
principal tool for getting

00:03:27.636 --> 00:03:32.234
qualitative information about
solutions without actually

00:03:32.234 --> 00:03:35.077
solving.
So, how does the direction

00:03:35.077 --> 00:03:39.716
field look?
Well, think about it for just a

00:03:39.716 --> 00:03:44.622
second, and you will see that
every horizontal line is an

00:03:44.622 --> 00:03:47.601
isocline.
So, the horizontal lines,

00:03:47.601 --> 00:03:51.456
what are their equations?
This is the t axis.

00:03:51.456 --> 00:03:56.012
And, here's the y axis.
The horizontal lines have the

00:03:56.012 --> 00:04:01.181
formula y equals a constant.
Let's make it y equals a y zero

00:04:01.181 --> 00:04:06.000
for different values of the
constant y zero.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.348
Those are the horizontal lines.
And, the point is they are

00:04:11.348 --> 00:04:12.662
isoclines.
Why?

00:04:12.662 --> 00:04:17.636
Well, because along any one of
these horizontal lines,

00:04:17.636 --> 00:04:22.140
I'll draw one in,
what are the slopes of the line

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.894
elements?
The slopes are dy / dt is equal

00:04:25.894 --> 00:04:30.961
to f of y zero,
but that's a constant because

00:04:30.961 --> 00:04:35.747
there's no t to change as you
move in the horizontal

00:04:35.747 --> 00:04:39.879
direction.
The slope is a constant.

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:44.106
So, if I draw in that isocline,
I guess I've forgotten,

00:04:44.106 --> 00:04:47.864
as our convention,
isoclines are in dashed lines,

00:04:47.864 --> 00:04:51.935
but if you have color,
you are allowed to put them in

00:04:51.935 --> 00:04:55.459
living yellow.
Well, I guess I could make them

00:04:55.459 --> 00:05:00.000
solid, in that case.
I don't have to make a dash.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.770
Then, all the line elements,
you put them in at will because

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.086
they will all have,
they are all the same,

00:05:08.086 --> 00:05:11.644
and they have slope,
that, f of y0.

00:05:11.644 --> 00:05:16.091
And, similarly down here,
they'll have some other slope.

00:05:16.091 --> 00:05:18.921
This one will have some other
slope.

00:05:18.921 --> 00:05:23.126
Whatever, this is the y zero,
the value of it,

00:05:23.126 --> 00:05:25.633
and whatever that happens to
be.

00:05:25.633 --> 00:05:30.000
I'll put it one more.
That's the x-axis.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.538
I can use the x-axis.
That's an isocline,

00:05:33.538 --> 00:05:36.457
too.
Now, what do you deduce about

00:05:36.457 --> 00:05:41.587
how the solutions must look?
Well, let's draw one solution.

00:05:41.587 --> 00:05:44.771
Suppose one solution looks like
this.

00:05:44.771 --> 00:05:48.840
Well, that's an integral curve,
in other words.

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.909
Its graph is a solution.
Now, as I slide along,

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:56.624
these slope elements stay
exactly the same,

00:05:56.624 --> 00:06:00.162
I can slide this curb along
horizontally,

00:06:00.162 --> 00:06:06.000
and it will still be an
integral curve everywhere.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.852
So, in other words,
they integral curves are

00:06:09.852 --> 00:06:14.869
invariant under translation for
an equation of this type.

00:06:14.869 --> 00:06:20.335
They all look exactly the same,
and you get them all by taking

00:06:20.335 --> 00:06:25.531
one, and just pushing it along.
Well, that's so simple it's

00:06:25.531 --> 00:06:30.101
almost uninteresting,
except in that these equations

00:06:30.101 --> 00:06:34.222
occur a lot in practice.
They are often hard to

00:06:34.222 --> 00:06:38.079
integrate directly.
And, therefore,

00:06:38.079 --> 00:06:42.040
it's important to be able to
get information about them.

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:45.783
Now, how does one do that?
There's one critical idea,

00:06:45.783 --> 00:06:48.807
and that is the notion of a
critical point.

00:06:48.807 --> 00:06:52.552
These equations have what are
called critical points.

00:06:52.552 --> 00:06:57.016
And, what it is is very simple.
There are three ways of looking

00:06:57.016 --> 00:06:59.608
at it: critical point,
y zero;

00:06:59.608 --> 00:07:04.000
what does it mean for y0 to be
a critical point?

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.221
It means, another way of saying
it is that it should be a zero

00:07:08.221 --> 00:07:11.751
of the right-hand side.
So, if I ask you to find the

00:07:11.751 --> 00:07:15.350
critical points for the
equation, what you will do is

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:18.811
solve the equation f of y equals
zero.

00:07:18.811 --> 00:07:21.164
Now, what's interesting about
them?

00:07:21.164 --> 00:07:25.109
Well, for a critical point,
what would be the slope of the

00:07:25.109 --> 00:07:28.570
line element along,
if this is at a critical level,

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:33.000
if that's a critical point?
Look at that isocline.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.447
What's the slope of the line
elements along it?

00:07:37.447 --> 00:07:39.864
It is zero.
And therefore,

00:07:39.864 --> 00:07:43.828
for these guys,
these are, in other words,

00:07:43.828 --> 00:07:48.469
our solution curves.
But let's prove it formally.

00:07:48.469 --> 00:07:52.046
So, there are three ways of
saying it.

00:07:52.046 --> 00:07:55.237
y zero is a critical point.

00:07:55.237 --> 00:08:00.555
It's a zero of the right-hand
side, or, y equals y0 is a

00:08:00.555 --> 00:08:05.776
solution to the equation.
Now, that's perfectly easy to

00:08:05.776 --> 00:08:10.076
verify.
If y zero makes this

00:08:10.076 --> 00:08:14.076
right-hand side zero,
it's certainly also y equals y0

00:08:14.076 --> 00:08:18.230
makes the left-hand
side zero because you're

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:21.692
differentiating a constant.
So, the reasoning,

00:08:21.692 --> 00:08:24.076
if you want reasoning,
is proof.

00:08:24.076 --> 00:08:28.000
Maybe we can make one line out
of a proof.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.722
To say that it's a solution,
what does it mean to say that

00:08:33.722 --> 00:08:38.240
it's a solution?
It means to say that when you

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:42.457
plug it in, plug in this
constant function,

00:08:42.457 --> 00:08:47.979
y0, the dy0 dt is equal to f of
y0.

00:08:47.979 --> 00:08:49.787
Is that true?
Yeah.

00:08:49.787 --> 00:08:52.799
Both sides are zero.
It's true.

00:08:52.799 --> 00:08:56.413
Now, y0 is not a number.
Well, it is.

00:08:56.413 --> 00:09:00.831
It's a number on this side,
but on this side,

00:09:00.831 --> 00:09:06.554
what I mean is a constant
function whose constant value is

00:09:06.554 --> 00:09:09.365
y zero, this function,

00:09:09.365 --> 00:09:14.686
and its derivatives are zero
because it has slope zero

00:09:14.686 --> 00:09:20.476
everywhere.
So, this guy is a constant

00:09:20.476 --> 00:09:25.523
function, has slope zero.
This is a number which makes

00:09:25.523 --> 00:09:30.000
the right-hand side zero.
Well, that's nice.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.382
So, in other words,
what we found are,

00:09:33.382 --> 00:09:38.411
by finding these critical
points, solving that equation,

00:09:38.411 --> 00:09:41.794
we found all the horizontal
solutions.

00:09:41.794 --> 00:09:44.628
But, what's so good about
those?

00:09:44.628 --> 00:09:50.205
Surely, they must be the most
interesting solutions there are.

00:09:50.205 --> 00:09:53.405
Well, think of how the picture
goes.

00:09:53.405 --> 00:09:57.702
Let's draw in one of those
horizontal solutions.

00:09:57.702 --> 00:10:02.000
So, here's a horizontal
solution.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.398
That's a solution.
So, this is my y0.

00:10:05.398 --> 00:10:08.418
That's the height at which it
is.

00:10:08.418 --> 00:10:13.705
And, I'm assuming that f of y0
equals zero.

00:10:13.705 --> 00:10:18.519
So, that's a solution.
Now, the significance of that

00:10:18.519 --> 00:10:22.578
is, because it's a solution,
in other words,

00:10:22.578 --> 00:10:27.203
it's an integral curve,
remember what's true about

00:10:27.203 --> 00:10:31.640
integral curves.
Other curves are not allowed to

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:35.193
cross them.
And therefore,

00:10:35.193 --> 00:10:38.431
these things are the absolute
barriers.

00:10:38.431 --> 00:10:42.267
So, for example,
suppose I have two of them is

00:10:42.267 --> 00:10:47.636
y0, and let's say here's another
one, another constant solution.

00:10:47.636 --> 00:10:52.238
I want to know what the curves
in between those can do.

00:10:52.238 --> 00:10:56.414
Well, I do know that whatever
those red curves do,

00:10:56.414 --> 00:11:00.590
the other integral curves,
they cannot cross this,

00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:06.361
and they cannot cross that.
And, you must be able to

00:11:06.361 --> 00:11:12.463
translate them along each other
without ever having two of them

00:11:12.463 --> 00:11:16.301
intersect.
Now, that really limits their

00:11:16.301 --> 00:11:21.123
behavior, but I'm going to nail
it down even more.

00:11:21.123 --> 00:11:24.469
So, other curves can't cross
these.

00:11:24.469 --> 00:11:29.685
Other integral curves can't
cross these yellow curves,

00:11:29.685 --> 00:11:35.000
these yellow lines,
these horizontal lines.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.286
But, I'm going to show you
more, and namely,

00:11:39.286 --> 00:11:45.167
so what I'm after is deciding,
without solving the equation,

00:11:45.167 --> 00:11:49.453
what those curves must look
like in between.

00:11:49.453 --> 00:11:55.135
Now, the way to do that is you
draw, so if we want to make

00:11:55.135 --> 00:12:00.916
steps, everybody likes steps,
okay, so step one is going to

00:12:00.916 --> 00:12:06.000
be, find these.
Find the critical points.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.376
And, you're going to do that by
solving this equation,

00:12:11.376 --> 00:12:16.652
finding out where it's zero.
Once you have done that,

00:12:16.652 --> 00:12:21.724
you are going to draw the graph
of f of y.

00:12:21.724 --> 00:12:27.202
And, the interest is going to
be, where is it positive?

00:12:27.202 --> 00:12:32.478
Where is it negative?
You've already found where it's

00:12:32.478 --> 00:12:35.283
zero.
Everywhere else,

00:12:35.283 --> 00:12:39.213
therefore, it must be either
positive or negative.

00:12:39.213 --> 00:12:43.704
Now, once you have found that
out, why am I interested in

00:12:43.704 --> 00:12:46.511
that?
Well, because dy / dt is equal

00:12:46.511 --> 00:12:49.157
to f of y, right?

00:12:49.157 --> 00:12:52.526
That's what the differential
equation says.

00:12:52.526 --> 00:12:55.012
Therefore, if this,
for example,

00:12:55.012 --> 00:12:57.819
is positive,
that means this must be

00:12:57.819 --> 00:13:00.385
positive.
It means that y must be

00:13:00.385 --> 00:13:03.593
increasing.
It means the solution must be

00:13:03.593 --> 00:13:07.303
increasing.
Where it's negative,

00:13:07.303 --> 00:13:09.323
the solution will be
decreasing.

00:13:09.323 --> 00:13:13.167
And, that tells me how it's
behaving in between these yellow

00:13:13.167 --> 00:13:15.904
lines, or on top of them,
or on the bottom.

00:13:15.904 --> 00:13:18.315
Now, at this point,
I'm going to stop,

00:13:18.315 --> 00:13:20.726
or not stop,
I mean, I'm going to stop

00:13:20.726 --> 00:13:23.789
talking generally.
And everything in the rest of

00:13:23.789 --> 00:13:26.982
the period will be done by
examples which will get

00:13:26.982 --> 00:13:30.631
increasingly complicated,
not terribly complicated by the

00:13:30.631 --> 00:13:34.477
end.
But, let's do one that's super

00:13:34.477 --> 00:13:38.442
simple to begin with.
Sorry, I shouldn't say that

00:13:38.442 --> 00:13:42.902
because some of you may be
baffled even by here because

00:13:42.902 --> 00:13:47.858
after all I'm going to be doing
the analysis not in the usual

00:13:47.858 --> 00:13:52.070
way, but by using new ideas.
That's the way you make

00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:53.970
progress.
All right, so,

00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:58.265
let's do our bank account.
So, y is money in the bank

00:13:58.265 --> 00:14:02.280
account.
r is the interest rate.

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:06.644
Let's assume it's a continuous
interest rate.

00:14:06.644 --> 00:14:11.008
All banks nowadays pay interest
continuously,

00:14:11.008 --> 00:14:16.561
the continuous interest rate.
So, if that's all there is,

00:14:16.561 --> 00:14:21.123
and money is growing,
you know the differential

00:14:21.123 --> 00:14:26.975
equation says that the rate at
which it grows is equal to r,

00:14:26.975 --> 00:14:32.528
the interest rate times a
principle, the amount that's in

00:14:32.528 --> 00:14:38.340
the bank at that time.
So, that's the differential

00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:41.721
equation that governs that.
Now, that's,

00:14:41.721 --> 00:14:46.402
of course, the solution is
simply an exponential curve.

00:14:46.402 --> 00:14:49.523
There's nothing more to say
about it.

00:14:49.523 --> 00:14:52.557
Now, let's make it more
interesting.

00:14:52.557 --> 00:14:56.891
Let's suppose there is a shifty
teller at the bank,

00:14:56.891 --> 00:15:01.659
and your money is being
embezzled from your account at a

00:15:01.659 --> 00:15:06.077
constant rate.
So, let's let w equal,

00:15:06.077 --> 00:15:11.272
or maybe e, but e has so many
other uses in mathematics,

00:15:11.272 --> 00:15:16.277
w is relatively unused,
w is the rate of embezzlement,

00:15:16.277 --> 00:15:21.377
thought of as continuous.
So, every day a little bit of

00:15:21.377 --> 00:15:26.572
money is sneaked out of your
account because you are not

00:15:26.572 --> 00:15:31.766
paying any attention to it.
You're off skiing somewhere,

00:15:31.766 --> 00:15:38.000
and not noticing what's
happening to your bank account.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.434
So, since it's the rate,
the time rate of embezzlement,

00:15:42.434 --> 00:15:47.442
I simply subtract it from this.
It's not w times y because the

00:15:47.442 --> 00:15:51.548
embezzler isn't stealing a
certain fraction of your

00:15:51.548 --> 00:15:54.668
account.
It's simply stealing a certain

00:15:54.668 --> 00:15:59.102
number of dollars every day,
the same number of dollars

00:15:59.102 --> 00:16:03.290
being withdrawn for the count.
Okay, now, of course,

00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:07.898
you could solve this.
This separates variables

00:16:07.898 --> 00:16:10.350
immediately.
You get the answer,

00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:12.881
and there's no problem with
that.

00:16:12.881 --> 00:16:17.468
Let's analyze the behavior of
the solutions without solving

00:16:17.468 --> 00:16:20.474
the equation by using these two
points.

00:16:20.474 --> 00:16:24.745
So, I want to analyze this
equation using the method of

00:16:24.745 --> 00:16:28.463
critical points.
So, the first thing I should do

00:16:28.463 --> 00:16:34.000
is, so, here's our equation,
is find the critical points.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.340
Notice it's an autonomous
equation all right,

00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:42.581
because there's no t on the
right-hand side.

00:16:42.581 --> 00:16:48.401
Okay, so, the critical points,
well, that's where ry minus w

00:16:48.401 --> 00:16:51.064
equals zero.
In other words,

00:16:51.064 --> 00:16:56.687
there's only one critical
point, and that occurs when y is

00:16:56.687 --> 00:17:01.224
equal to w over r.
So, that's the only critical

00:17:01.224 --> 00:17:05.355
point.
Now, I want to know what's

00:17:05.355 --> 00:17:09.432
happening to the solution.
So, in other words,

00:17:09.432 --> 00:17:14.325
if I plot, I can write away,
of course, negative values

00:17:14.325 --> 00:17:17.859
aren't of particularly
interesting here,

00:17:17.859 --> 00:17:21.573
there is definitely a
horizontal solution,

00:17:21.573 --> 00:17:25.197
and it has the value,
it's at the height,

00:17:25.197 --> 00:17:30.000
w over r.
That's a solution.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.268
The question is,
what do the other solutions

00:17:33.268 --> 00:17:35.928
look like?
Now, watch how I make the

00:17:35.928 --> 00:17:39.045
analysis because I'm going to
use two now.

00:17:39.045 --> 00:17:41.705
So, this is step one,
then step two.

00:17:41.705 --> 00:17:45.049
What do I do? Well, 
I'm going to graph f of y.

00:17:45.049 --> 00:17:47.710
Well, f of y is ry minus w.

00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:50.978
What does that look like?

00:17:50.978 --> 00:17:55.159
Okay, so, here is the y-axis.
Notice the y-axis is going

00:17:55.159 --> 00:17:59.567
horizontally because what I'm
interested in is the graph of

00:17:59.567 --> 00:18:04.275
this function.
What do I call the other axis?

00:18:04.275 --> 00:18:08.524
I'm going to use the same
terminology that is used on the

00:18:08.524 --> 00:18:11.027
little visual that describes
this.

00:18:11.027 --> 00:18:14.441
And, that's dy.
You could call this other axis

00:18:14.441 --> 00:18:18.613
the f of y axis.
That's not a good name for it.

00:18:18.613 --> 00:18:22.179
You could call it the dy / dt
axis because it's,

00:18:22.179 --> 00:18:24.531
so to speak,
the other variable.

00:18:24.531 --> 00:18:28.324
That's not great either.
But, worst of all would be

00:18:28.324 --> 00:18:32.875
introducing yet another letter
for which we would have no use

00:18:32.875 --> 00:18:37.000
whatsoever.
So, let's think of it.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.636
We are plotting,
now, the graph of f of y.

00:18:40.636 --> 00:18:43.636
f of y is this function,

00:18:43.636 --> 00:18:48.090
ry minus w.
Well, that's a line.

00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:53.000
Its intercept is down here at
w, and so the graph looks

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.909
something like this.
It's a line.

00:18:55.909 --> 00:18:59.454
This is the line,
ry minus w.

00:18:59.454 --> 00:19:05.069
It has slope r.
Well, what am I going to get

00:19:05.069 --> 00:19:08.906
out of that line?
Just exactly this.

00:19:08.906 --> 00:19:13.182
What am I interested in about
that line?

00:19:13.182 --> 00:19:18.116
Nothing other than where is it
above the axis,

00:19:18.116 --> 00:19:23.817
and where is it below?
This function is positive over

00:19:23.817 --> 00:19:28.860
here, and therefore,
I'm going to indicate that

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:35.000
symbolically,
this, by putting an arrow here.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.584
The meeting of this arrow is
that y of t is

00:19:39.584 --> 00:19:43.179
increasing.
See where it's the right-hand

00:19:43.179 --> 00:19:48.033
side of that last board?
y of t is increasing when f of

00:19:48.033 --> 00:19:52.258
y is positive.
f of y is positive here,

00:19:52.258 --> 00:19:55.943
and therefore,
to the right of this point,

00:19:55.943 --> 00:19:59.449
it's increasing.
Here to the left of it,

00:19:59.449 --> 00:20:03.674
f of y is negative,
and therefore over here it's

00:20:03.674 --> 00:20:08.687
going to be decreasing.
What point is this,

00:20:08.687 --> 00:20:11.973
in fact?
Well, that's where it crosses

00:20:11.973 --> 00:20:15.171
the axis.
That's exactly the critical

00:20:15.171 --> 00:20:19.967
point, w over r.
Therefore, what this says is

00:20:19.967 --> 00:20:24.052
that a solution,
once it's bigger than y over r,

00:20:24.052 --> 00:20:28.582
it increases,
and it increases faster and

00:20:28.582 --> 00:20:34.000
faster because this function is
higher and higher.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.334
And, that represents the rate
of change.

00:20:37.334 --> 00:20:40.498
So, in other words,
once the solution,

00:20:40.498 --> 00:20:44.774
let's say a solution starts
over here at time zero.

00:20:44.774 --> 00:20:48.793
So, this is the t axis.
And, here is the y axis.

00:20:48.793 --> 00:20:51.444
So, now, I'm plotting
solutions.

00:20:51.444 --> 00:20:55.377
If it starts at t equals zero,
above this line,

00:20:55.377 --> 00:20:59.567
that is, starts with the value
w over r,

00:20:59.567 --> 00:21:04.270
which is bigger than zero,
a value bigger than w over r,

00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:07.862
then it increases,
and increases faster and

00:21:07.862 --> 00:21:12.315
faster.
If it starts below that,

00:21:12.315 --> 00:21:16.561
it decreases and decreases
faster and faster.

00:21:16.561 --> 00:21:20.324
Now, in fact,
I only have to draw two of

00:21:20.324 --> 00:21:24.763
those because what do all the
others look like?

00:21:24.763 --> 00:21:29.298
They are translations.
All the other curves look

00:21:29.298 --> 00:21:35.702
exactly like those.
They are just translations of

00:21:35.702 --> 00:21:39.914
them.
This guy, if I start closer,

00:21:39.914 --> 00:21:47.319
it's still going to decrease.
Well, that's supposed to be a

00:21:47.319 --> 00:21:50.382
translation.
Maybe it is.

00:21:50.382 --> 00:21:57.914
So, these guys look like that.
Let's do just a tiny bit more

00:21:57.914 --> 00:22:06.625
interpretation of that.
Well, I think I better leave it

00:22:06.625 --> 00:22:13.040
there because we've got harder
things to do,

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:19.754
and I want to make sure we've
got time for it.

00:22:19.754 --> 00:22:23.483
Sorry.
Okay, next example,

00:22:23.483 --> 00:22:31.092
a logistic equation.
Some of you have already solved

00:22:31.092 --> 00:22:39.000
this in recitation,
and some of you haven't.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:44.043
This is a population equation.
This is the one that section

00:22:44.043 --> 00:22:48.391
7.1 and section 1.7 is most
heavily concerned with,

00:22:48.391 --> 00:22:52.739
this particular equation.
The derivation of it is a

00:22:52.739 --> 00:22:55.782
little vague.
It's an equation which

00:22:55.782 --> 00:22:58.739
describes how population
increases.

00:22:58.739 --> 00:23:02.739
And one minute,
the population behavior of some

00:23:02.739 --> 00:23:06.432
population, --
-- let's call it,

00:23:06.432 --> 00:23:10.559
y is the only thing I know to
call anything today,

00:23:10.559 --> 00:23:15.024
but of course your book uses
capital P for population,

00:23:15.024 --> 00:23:18.225
to get you used to different
variables.

00:23:18.225 --> 00:23:22.184
Now, the basic population
equation runs dy / dt.

00:23:22.184 --> 00:23:26.228
There's a certain growth rate.
Let's call it k y.

00:23:26.228 --> 00:23:29.429
So, k is what's called the
growth rate.

00:23:29.429 --> 00:23:33.135
It's actually,
sometimes it's talked about in

00:23:33.135 --> 00:23:38.536
terms of birthrate.
But, it's the net birth rate.

00:23:38.536 --> 00:23:42.210
It's the rate at which people,
or bacteria,

00:23:42.210 --> 00:23:47.283
or whatever are being born
minus the rate at which they are

00:23:47.283 --> 00:23:49.995
dying.
So, it's a net birthrate.

00:23:49.995 --> 00:23:53.406
But, let's just call it the
growth rate.

00:23:53.406 --> 00:23:57.780
Now, if this is the equation,
we can think of this,

00:23:57.780 --> 00:24:01.628
if k is constant,
that's what's called simple

00:24:01.628 --> 00:24:05.739
population growth.
And you are all familiar with

00:24:05.739 --> 00:24:08.626
that.
Logistical growth allows for

00:24:08.626 --> 00:24:13.000
slightly more complex
situations.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:18.735
Logistic growth says that
calling k a constant is

00:24:18.735 --> 00:24:26.383
unrealistic because the Earth is
not filled entirely with people.

00:24:26.383 --> 00:24:32.000
What stops it from having
unlimited growth?

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.664
Well, the fact that the
resources, the food,

00:24:36.664 --> 00:24:41.111
the organism has to live on
gets depleted.

00:24:41.111 --> 00:24:46.427
And, in other words,
the growth rate declines as y

00:24:46.427 --> 00:24:50.549
increases.
As the population increases,

00:24:50.549 --> 00:24:56.949
one expects the growth rate to
decline because resources are

00:24:56.949 --> 00:25:01.613
being used up,
and they are not indefinitely

00:25:01.613 --> 00:25:05.619
available.
Well, in other words,

00:25:05.619 --> 00:25:09.629
we should replace k by a
function with this behavior.

00:25:09.629 --> 00:25:14.024
What's the simplest function
that declines as y increases?

00:25:14.024 --> 00:25:17.803
The simplest choice,
and if you are ignorant about

00:25:17.803 --> 00:25:20.888
what else to do,
stick with the simplest,

00:25:20.888 --> 00:25:24.820
at least you won't work any
harder than you have to,

00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:29.679
would be to take k equal to the
simplest declining function of y

00:25:29.679 --> 00:25:32.995
there is, which is simply a
linear function,

00:25:32.995 --> 00:25:37.464
A minus BY.
So, if I use that as the choice

00:25:37.464 --> 00:25:41.917
of the declining growth rate,
the new equation is dy / dt

00:25:41.917 --> 00:25:45.495
equals, here's my new k.
The y stays the same,

00:25:45.495 --> 00:25:50.425
so the equation becomes a minus
by, the quantity times y,

00:25:50.425 --> 00:25:53.207
or in other words,

00:25:53.207 --> 00:25:55.911
ay minus b y squared.

00:25:55.911 --> 00:26:01.000
This equation is what's called
the logistic equation.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:05.835
It has many applications,
not just to population growth.

00:26:05.835 --> 00:26:11.109
It's applied to the spread of
disease, the spread of a rumor,

00:26:11.109 --> 00:26:16.032
the spread of many things.
Yeah, a couple pieces of chalk

00:26:16.032 --> 00:26:17.000
here.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:34.012
Okay, now, those of you who
have solved it know that the

00:26:34.012 --> 00:26:40.135
explicit solution involves,
well, you separate variables,

00:26:40.135 --> 00:26:44.726
but you will have to use
partial fractions,

00:26:44.726 --> 00:26:48.881
ugh, I hope you love partial
fractions.

00:26:48.881 --> 00:26:53.581
You're going to need them later
in the term.

00:26:53.581 --> 00:26:59.485
But, I could avoid them now by
not solving the equation

00:26:59.485 --> 00:27:03.946
explicitly.
But anyway, you get a solution,

00:27:03.946 --> 00:27:06.896
which I was going to write on
the board for you,

00:27:06.896 --> 00:27:09.219
but you could look it up in
your book.

00:27:09.219 --> 00:27:13.112
It's unpleasant enough looking
to make you feel that there must

00:27:13.112 --> 00:27:16.753
be an easier way at least to get
the basic information out.

00:27:16.753 --> 00:27:20.206
Okay, let's see if we can get
the basic information out.

00:27:20.206 --> 00:27:23.659
What are the critical points?
Well, this is pretty easy.

00:27:23.659 --> 00:27:26.798
A, I want to set the right-hand
side equal to zero.

00:27:26.798 --> 00:27:30.000
So, I'm going to solve the
equation.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:35.111
I can factor out a y.
It's going to be y times a

00:27:35.111 --> 00:27:39.026
minus by equals zero.

00:27:39.026 --> 00:27:43.920
And therefore,
the critical points are where y

00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:47.509
equals zero. That's one.

00:27:47.509 --> 00:27:52.838
And, the other factor is when
this factor is zero,

00:27:52.838 --> 00:27:59.145
and that happens when y is
equal to a over b.

00:27:59.145 --> 00:28:03.061
So, there are my two critical
points.

00:28:03.061 --> 00:28:08.172
Okay, what does,
let's start drawing pictures of

00:28:08.172 --> 00:28:12.955
solutions.
Let's put it in those right

00:28:12.955 --> 00:28:15.128
away.
Okay, the critical point,

00:28:15.128 --> 00:28:18.459
zero, gives me a solution that
looks like this.

00:28:18.459 --> 00:28:21.573
And, the critical point,
a over b,

00:28:21.573 --> 00:28:25.629
those are positive numbers.
So, that's somewhere up here.

00:28:25.629 --> 00:28:29.033
So, those are two solutions,
constant solutions.

00:28:29.033 --> 00:28:32.292
In other words,
if the population by dumb luck

00:28:32.292 --> 00:28:35.551
started at zero,
it would stay at zero for all

00:28:35.551 --> 00:28:39.084
time.
That's not terribly surprising.

00:28:39.084 --> 00:28:43.252
But, it's a little less obvious
that if it starts at that magic

00:28:43.252 --> 00:28:47.151
number, a over b,
it will also stay at that magic

00:28:47.151 --> 00:28:50.983
number for all time without
moving up or down or away from

00:28:50.983 --> 00:28:52.596
it.
Now, the question is,

00:28:52.596 --> 00:28:54.882
therefore, what happens in
between?

00:28:54.882 --> 00:28:58.243
So, for the in between,
I'm going to make that same

00:28:58.243 --> 00:29:03.924
analysis that I made before.
And, it's really not very hard.

00:29:03.924 --> 00:29:09.584
Look, so here's my dy/dt-axis.
I'll call that y prime,

00:29:09.584 --> 00:29:12.226
okay?
And, here's the y-axis.

00:29:12.226 --> 00:29:16.471
So, I'm now doing step two.
This was step one.

00:29:16.471 --> 00:29:21.283
Okay, the function that I want
to graph is this one,

00:29:21.283 --> 00:29:26.283
ay minus b y squared,
or in factor form,

00:29:26.283 --> 00:29:29.301
y times a minus by.

00:29:29.301 --> 00:29:32.981
Now, this function,
we know, has a zero.

00:29:32.981 --> 00:29:37.603
It has a zero here,
and it has a zero at the point

00:29:37.603 --> 00:29:43.340
a over b.
At these two critical points,

00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:46.729
it has a zero.
What is it doing in between?

00:29:46.729 --> 00:29:49.392
Well, in between,
it's a parabola.

00:29:49.392 --> 00:29:52.782
It's a quadratic function.
It's a parabola.

00:29:52.782 --> 00:29:55.364
Does it go up or does it go
down?

00:29:55.364 --> 00:29:59.077
Well, when y is very large,
it's very negative.

00:29:59.077 --> 00:30:04.000
That means it must be a
downward-opening parabola.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.778
And therefore,
this curve looks like this.

00:30:07.778 --> 00:30:12.477
So, I'm interested in knowing,
where is it positive,

00:30:12.477 --> 00:30:16.624
and where is it negative?
Well, it's positive,

00:30:16.624 --> 00:30:19.849
here, for this range of values
of y.

00:30:19.849 --> 00:30:24.825
Since it's positive there,
it will be increasing there.

00:30:24.825 --> 00:30:28.880
Here, it's negative,
and therefore it will be

00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:32.802
decreasing.
Here, it's negative,

00:30:32.802 --> 00:30:36.767
and therefore,
dy / dt will be negative also,

00:30:36.767 --> 00:30:41.633
and therefore the function,
y, will be decreasing here.

00:30:41.633 --> 00:30:44.968
So, how do these other
solutions look?

00:30:44.968 --> 00:30:49.563
Well, we can put them in.
I'll put them in in white,

00:30:49.563 --> 00:30:54.970
okay, because this has got to
last until the end of the term.

00:30:54.970 --> 00:30:59.837
So, how are they doing?
They are increasing between the

00:30:59.837 --> 00:31:04.436
two curves.
They are not allowed to cross

00:31:04.436 --> 00:31:08.638
either of these yellow curves.
But, they are always

00:31:08.638 --> 00:31:11.495
increasing.
Well, if they're always

00:31:11.495 --> 00:31:15.277
increasing, they must start here
and increase,

00:31:15.277 --> 00:31:19.983
and not allowed to cross.
It must do something like that.

00:31:19.983 --> 00:31:22.672
This must be a translation of
it.

00:31:22.672 --> 00:31:26.537
In other words,
the curves must look like that.

00:31:26.537 --> 00:31:32.000
Those are supposed to be
translations of each other.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.250
I know they aren't,
but use your imaginations.

00:31:35.250 --> 00:31:38.501
But what's happening above?
So in other words,

00:31:38.501 --> 00:31:42.618
if I start with a population
anywhere bigger than zero but

00:31:42.618 --> 00:31:46.880
less than a over b,
it increases asymptotically to

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:50.347
the level a over b.
What happens if I start above

00:31:50.347 --> 00:31:52.803
that?
Well, then it decreases to it

00:31:52.803 --> 00:31:56.343
because, this way,
for the values of y bigger than

00:31:56.343 --> 00:32:00.099
a over b,
it decreases as time increases.

00:32:00.099 --> 00:32:04.000
So, these guys up here are
doing this.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.708
And, how about the ones below
the axis?

00:32:06.708 --> 00:32:09.558
Well, they have no physical
significance.

00:32:09.558 --> 00:32:12.979
But let's put them in anyway.
Whether they doing?

00:32:12.979 --> 00:32:15.402
They are decreasing away from
zero.

00:32:15.402 --> 00:32:18.609
So, these guys don't mean
anything physically,

00:32:18.609 --> 00:32:21.887
but mathematically they exist.
Their solutions,

00:32:21.887 --> 00:32:25.735
they're going down like that.
Now, you notice from this

00:32:25.735 --> 00:32:29.441
picture that there are,
even though both of these are

00:32:29.441 --> 00:32:32.363
constant solutions,
they have dramatically

00:32:32.363 --> 00:32:37.071
different behavior.
This one, this solution,

00:32:37.071 --> 00:32:41.645
is the one that all other
solutions try to approach as

00:32:41.645 --> 00:32:45.961
time goes to infinity.
This one, the solution zero,

00:32:45.961 --> 00:32:48.032
is repulsive,
as it were.

00:32:48.032 --> 00:32:52.866
Any solution that starts near
zero, if it starts at zero,

00:32:52.866 --> 00:32:58.044
of course, it stays there for
all time, but if it starts just

00:32:58.044 --> 00:33:02.187
a little bit above zero,
it increases to a over b.

00:33:02.187 --> 00:33:05.911
This is called a stable

00:33:05.911 --> 00:33:11.146
solution because everybody tries
to get closer and closer to it.

00:33:11.146 --> 00:33:14.304
This is called,
zero is also a constant

00:33:14.304 --> 00:33:17.795
solution, but this is an
unstable solution.

00:33:17.795 --> 00:33:21.783
And now, usually,
solution is too general a word.

00:33:21.783 --> 00:33:26.271
I think it's better to call it
a stable critical point,

00:33:26.271 --> 00:33:30.094
and an unstable critical point.
But, of course,

00:33:30.094 --> 00:33:34.000
it also corresponds to a
solution.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.569
So, critical points are not all
the same.

00:33:37.569 --> 00:33:40.960
Some are stable,
and some are unstable.

00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:46.581
And, you can see which is which
just by looking at this picture.

00:33:46.581 --> 00:33:51.221
If the arrows point towards
them, you've got a stable

00:33:51.221 --> 00:33:55.058
critical point.
If it arrows point away from

00:33:55.058 --> 00:33:58.895
them, you've got an unstable
critical point.

00:33:58.895 --> 00:34:03.000
Now, there is a third
possibility.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:09.000
Okay, I think we'd better
address it because otherwise

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:13.528
you're going to sit there
wondering, hey,

00:34:13.528 --> 00:34:18.283
what did he do?
Suppose it looks like this.

00:34:18.283 --> 00:34:24.735
Suppose it were just tangent.
Well, this is the picture of

00:34:24.735 --> 00:34:31.301
that curve, the pink curve.
What would the arrows look like

00:34:31.301 --> 00:34:35.372
then?
What would the arrows look like

00:34:35.372 --> 00:34:38.050
then?
Well, since they are positive,

00:34:38.050 --> 00:34:41.569
it's always positive,
the arrow goes like this.

00:34:41.569 --> 00:34:45.013
And then on the side,
it also goes in the same

00:34:45.013 --> 00:34:47.767
direction.
So, is this critical point

00:34:47.767 --> 00:34:51.517
stable or unstable?
It's stable if you approach it

00:34:51.517 --> 00:34:53.889
from the left.
So, how, in fact,

00:34:53.889 --> 00:34:57.026
do the curves,
how would the corresponding

00:34:57.026 --> 00:35:00.010
curves look?
Well, there's our long-term

00:35:00.010 --> 00:35:05.760
solution.
This corresponds to that point.

00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:10.977
Let's call this a,
and then this will be the

00:35:10.977 --> 00:35:14.495
value, a.
If I start below it,

00:35:14.495 --> 00:35:18.498
I rise to it.
If I start above it,

00:35:18.498 --> 00:35:22.744
I increase.
So, if I start above it,

00:35:22.744 --> 00:35:27.718
I do this.
Well, now, that's stable on one

00:35:27.718 --> 00:35:35.360
side, and unstable on the other.
And, that's indicated by saying

00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:40.550
it's semi-stable.
That's a brilliant word.

00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:43.393
I wonder how long it to do
think that one up,

00:35:43.393 --> 00:35:46.366
semi-stable critical point:
stable on one side,

00:35:46.366 --> 00:35:50.307
unstable on the other depending
on whether you start below it.

00:35:50.307 --> 00:35:53.150
And, of course,
it could be reversed if I had

00:35:53.150 --> 00:35:57.221
drawn the picture the other way.
I could have approached it from

00:35:57.221 --> 00:36:03.491
the top, and left it from below.
You get the idea of the

00:36:03.491 --> 00:36:08.044
behavior.
Okay, let's now take,

00:36:08.044 --> 00:36:16.544
I'm going to soup up this
logistic equation just a little

00:36:16.544 --> 00:36:21.553
bit more.
So, let's talk about the

00:36:21.553 --> 00:36:28.383
logistic equation.
But, I'm going to add to it

00:36:28.383 --> 00:36:36.687
harvesting, with harvesting.
So, this is a very late 20th

00:36:36.687 --> 00:36:39.662
century concept.
So, we imagine,

00:36:39.662 --> 00:36:43.693
for example,
a bunch of formerly free range

00:36:43.693 --> 00:36:49.835
Atlantic salmon penned in one of
these huge factory farms off the

00:36:49.835 --> 00:36:54.826
coast of Maine or someplace.
They've made salmon much

00:36:54.826 --> 00:37:00.105
cheaper than it used to be,
but at a certain cost to the

00:37:00.105 --> 00:37:05.000
salmon, and possibly to our
environment.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:08.446
So, what happens?
Well, the salmon grow,

00:37:08.446 --> 00:37:11.186
and grow, and do what salmon
do.

00:37:11.186 --> 00:37:15.959
And, they are harvested.
That's a word somewhere in the

00:37:15.959 --> 00:37:19.671
category of ethnic cleansing in
my opinion.

00:37:19.671 --> 00:37:23.383
But, it's, again,
a very 20th-century word.

00:37:23.383 --> 00:37:27.007
I think it was Hitler who
discovered that,

00:37:27.007 --> 00:37:32.310
that all you had to do was call
something by a sanitary name,

00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:37.702
and no matter how horrible it
was, good bourgeois people would

00:37:37.702 --> 00:37:42.353
accept it.
So, the harvesting,

00:37:42.353 --> 00:37:47.555
which means,
of course, picking them up and

00:37:47.555 --> 00:37:52.633
killing them,
and putting them in cans and

00:37:52.633 --> 00:37:58.206
stuff like that,
okay, so what's the equation?

00:37:58.206 --> 00:38:05.266
I'm going to assume that the
harvest is at a constant time

00:38:05.266 --> 00:38:08.268
rate.
In other words,

00:38:08.268 --> 00:38:13.259
it's not a certain fraction of
all the salmon that are being

00:38:13.259 --> 00:38:17.658
caught each day and canned.
The factory has a certain

00:38:17.658 --> 00:38:21.211
capacity, so,
400 pounds of salmon each day

00:38:21.211 --> 00:38:25.948
are pulled out and canned.
So, it's a constant time rate.

00:38:25.948 --> 00:38:31.108
That means that the equation is
now going to be dy/dt is equal

00:38:31.108 --> 00:38:35.000
to, well, salmon grow
logistically.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:39.629
ay minus b y squared, 
so, that part of the

00:38:39.629 --> 00:38:44.006
equation is the same.
But, I need a term to take care

00:38:44.006 --> 00:38:48.383
of this constant harvesting
rate, and that will be h.

00:38:48.383 --> 00:38:50.909
Let's call it h,
not h times y.

00:38:50.909 --> 00:38:55.622
Then, I would be harvesting a
certain fraction of all the

00:38:55.622 --> 00:39:00.000
salmon there,
which is not what I'm doing.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:03.445
Okay: our equation.
Now, I want to analyze what the

00:39:03.445 --> 00:39:05.718
critical points of this look
like.

00:39:05.718 --> 00:39:09.715
Now, this is a little more
subtle because there's now a new

00:39:09.715 --> 00:39:12.953
parameter, there.
And, what I want to see is how

00:39:12.953 --> 00:39:15.296
that varies with the new
parameter.

00:39:15.296 --> 00:39:19.016
The best thing to do is,
I mean, the thing not to do is

00:39:19.016 --> 00:39:22.186
make this equal to zero,
fiddle around with the

00:39:22.186 --> 00:39:25.355
quadratic formula,
get some massive expression,

00:39:25.355 --> 00:39:29.489
and then spend the next half
hour scratching your head trying

00:39:29.489 --> 00:39:33.348
to figure out what it means,
and what information you are

00:39:33.348 --> 00:39:37.000
supposed to be getting out of
it.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:40.815
Draw pictures instead.
Draw pictures.

00:39:40.815 --> 00:39:45.373
If h is zero,
that's the smallest harvesting

00:39:45.373 --> 00:39:50.460
rate I could have.
The picture looks like our old

00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:52.686
one.
So, if h is zero,

00:39:52.686 --> 00:39:56.926
the picture looks like,
what color did I,

00:39:56.926 --> 00:40:00.000
okay, pink.
Yellow.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.685
Yellow is the cheapest,
but I can't find it.

00:40:03.685 --> 00:40:06.942
Okay, yellow is commercially
available.

00:40:06.942 --> 00:40:11.228
These are precious.
All right, purple if it's okay,

00:40:11.228 --> 00:40:13.542
purple.
So, this is the one,

00:40:13.542 --> 00:40:17.571
our original one corresponding
to h equals zero.

00:40:17.571 --> 00:40:21.771
Or, in other words,
it's the equation ay minus b y

00:40:21.771 --> 00:40:24.514
squared. h is zero.

00:40:24.514 --> 00:40:28.714
Now, if I want to find,
I now want to increase the

00:40:28.714 --> 00:40:32.657
value of h, well,
if I increase the value of h,

00:40:32.657 --> 00:40:35.828
in other words,
harvest more and more,

00:40:35.828 --> 00:40:41.521
what's happening?
Well, I simply lower this

00:40:41.521 --> 00:40:45.554
function by h.
So, if I lower h somewhat,

00:40:45.554 --> 00:40:49.991
it will come to here.
So, this is some value,

00:40:49.991 --> 00:40:54.831
ay minus b y squared minus h1,

00:40:54.831 --> 00:40:57.655
let's say.
That's this curve.

00:40:57.655 --> 00:41:03.000
If I lower it a lot,
it will look like this.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:08.651
So, ay minus b y squared minus
h a lot, h twenty.

00:41:08.651 --> 00:41:11.709
This doesn't mean anything.

00:41:11.709 --> 00:41:14.118
Two.
Obviously, there's one

00:41:14.118 --> 00:41:17.083
interesting value to lower it
by.

00:41:17.083 --> 00:41:22.271
It's a value which would lower
it exactly by this amount.

00:41:22.271 --> 00:41:27.182
Let me put that in special.
If I lower it by just that

00:41:27.182 --> 00:41:32.000
amount, the curve always looks
the same.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:36.866
It's just been lowered.
I'm going to say this one is,

00:41:36.866 --> 00:41:42.389
so this one is the same thing,
except that I've subtracted h

00:41:42.389 --> 00:41:46.413
sub m. Where is h sub m on

00:41:46.413 --> 00:41:49.970
the picture?
Well, I lowered it by this

00:41:49.970 --> 00:41:53.152
amount.
So, this height is h sub m.

00:41:53.152 --> 00:41:57.177
In other words,
if I find the maximum height

00:41:57.177 --> 00:42:01.763
here, which is easy to do
because it's a parabola,

00:42:01.763 --> 00:42:07.192
and lower it by exactly that
amount, I will have lowered it

00:42:07.192 --> 00:42:12.382
to this point.
This will be a critical point.

00:42:12.382 --> 00:42:16.512
Now, the question is,
what's happened to the critical

00:42:16.512 --> 00:42:20.245
point as I did this?
I started with the critical

00:42:20.245 --> 00:42:22.945
points here and here.
As I lower h,

00:42:22.945 --> 00:42:26.361
the critical point changed to
this and that.

00:42:26.361 --> 00:42:32.000
And now, it changed to this one
when I got to the purple line.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:36.121
And, as I went still further
down, there were no critical

00:42:36.121 --> 00:42:38.844
points.
So, this curve has no critical

00:42:38.844 --> 00:42:42.376
points attached to it.
What are the corresponding

00:42:42.376 --> 00:42:44.731
pictures?
Well, the corresponding

00:42:44.731 --> 00:42:47.307
pictures, well,
we've already drawn,

00:42:47.307 --> 00:42:51.428
the picture for h equals zero
is drawn already.

00:42:51.428 --> 00:42:55.549
The pictures that I'm talking
about are how the solutions

00:42:55.549 --> 00:42:57.904
look.
How would the solution look

00:42:57.904 --> 00:43:00.406
like for this one for h one?

00:43:00.406 --> 00:43:06.000
For h1, the solutions look
like, here is a over b.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:10.471
Here is a over b,
but the critical points aren't

00:43:10.471 --> 00:43:15.268
at zero and a over b anymore.
They've moved in a little bit.

00:43:15.268 --> 00:43:18.682
So, they are here and here.
And, otherwise,

00:43:18.682 --> 00:43:22.260
the solutions look just like
they did before,

00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:25.837
and the analysis is the same.
And, similarly,

00:43:25.837 --> 00:43:29.902
if h two goes very far,
if h2 is very large,

00:43:29.902 --> 00:43:33.317
there are no critical points.
h, too large,

00:43:33.317 --> 00:43:38.388
no critical points.
Are the solutions decreasing

00:43:38.388 --> 00:43:42.482
all the time or increasing?
Well, they are always

00:43:42.482 --> 00:43:46.747
decreasing because the function
is always negative.

00:43:46.747 --> 00:43:49.476
Solutions always go down,
always.

00:43:49.476 --> 00:43:54.338
The interesting one is this
last one, where I decreased it

00:43:54.338 --> 00:43:57.664
just to (h)m.
And, what happens there is

00:43:57.664 --> 00:44:01.758
there is this certain,
magic critical point whose

00:44:01.758 --> 00:44:07.481
value we could calculate.
There's one constant solution.

00:44:07.481 --> 00:44:10.293
So, this is one that has the
value.

00:44:10.293 --> 00:44:13.601
Sorry, I'm calculating the
solutions out.

00:44:13.601 --> 00:44:17.075
So, y here and t here,
so here it is value,

00:44:17.075 --> 00:44:20.879
(h)m is the value by which it
has been lowered.

00:44:20.879 --> 00:44:23.526
So, this is the picture for
(h)m.

00:44:23.526 --> 00:44:29.281
And, how do the solutions look?
Well, to the right of that,

00:44:29.281 --> 00:44:33.507
they are decreasing.
And, to the left they are also

00:44:33.507 --> 00:44:37.816
decreasing because this function
is always negative.

00:44:37.816 --> 00:44:42.211
So, the solutions look like
this, if you start above,

00:44:42.211 --> 00:44:45.338
and if you start below,
they decrease.

00:44:45.338 --> 00:44:49.140
And, of course,
they can't get lower than zero

00:44:49.140 --> 00:44:53.535
because these are salmon.
What is the significance of

00:44:53.535 --> 00:44:56.239
(h)m?
(h)m is the maximum rate of

00:44:56.239 --> 00:44:59.450
harvesting.
It's an extremely important

00:44:59.450 --> 00:45:05.263
number for this industry.
If the maximum time rate at

00:45:05.263 --> 00:45:09.624
which you can pull the salmon
daily out of the water,

00:45:09.624 --> 00:45:12.558
and can them without what
happening?

00:45:12.558 --> 00:45:15.241
Without the salmon going to
zero.

00:45:15.241 --> 00:45:20.021
As long as you start above,
and don't harvest it more than

00:45:20.021 --> 00:45:23.710
this rate, it will be following
these curves.

00:45:23.710 --> 00:45:28.573
You will be following these
curves, and you will still have

00:45:28.573 --> 00:45:31.508
salmon.
If you harvest just a little

00:45:31.508 --> 00:45:36.120
bit more, you will be on this
curve that has no critical

00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:39.853
points, and the salmon in the
tank will decrease to zero.
