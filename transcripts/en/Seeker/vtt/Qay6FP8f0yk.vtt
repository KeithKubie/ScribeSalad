00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.710
When it comes to talking about drought, California
always grabs the headlines. But what about

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.490
other states? Sadly, things aren’t looking
much wetter for the rest of the country either.

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:18.400
Hey everyone, Julia here for DNews. As of
last week much of California remains in exceptional

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.660
drought, the worst category there is. We’ve
talked a lot about the big drought in California

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.680
before. Not surprisingly, a lot of the at-risk
states are in the West, according to recent

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.620
data from The U.S. Drought Monitor.

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:33.870
Along with California, almost all of Nevada
and Oregon are severely dry, some parts of

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.750
Nevada are even exceptionally dry. Other states
are feeling the heat too. The monitor shows

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.980
that large swaths of Arizona, New Mexico,
and Utah are experiencing abnormally and moderately

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.110
dry conditions. Kansas is still recovering
from last year when 93% of the state was in

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.260
severe drought.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.550
Another center of drought, is in the Southern
Plains in Oklahoma and Texas. Parts of North

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.829
and Western Oklahoma have seen devastating
extreme drought over the past few years. But

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.670
last month some rains relieved a little of
that stress. Some areas saw an 8% drop in

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:04.870
drought coverage.

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:10.220
Texas’s drought started in 2011, which ranked
as the driest year on record. Since then,

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.510
the drought shows no sign of letting up. The
Lone Star State has seen water tables drop

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:19.520
more than 150 feet in some areas. Central
Texas is suffering the most, facing severe

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.690
to exceptional drought. It’s so bad that
in March of this year, Governor Greg Abbott

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.940
issued an Emergency Disaster Proclamation
certifying that exceptional drought conditions

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.020
posed a threat of imminent disaster.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.420
But the drought is heading north, too. Most
of the high plains, Minnesota, Wisconsin,

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.450
North and South Dakota are in moderate to
severe conditions. According to one report

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.920
by the Government Accountability Office, Montana
is most likely to face a water shortage in

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.200
the next decade.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.049
Even Hawaii is feeling the heat. According
to the National Weather service, most of the

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:51.799
“big islands” are in a moderate drought
and the month of February saw some record

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:52.650
high temperatures.

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:58.170
The early part of this decade saw the worst
drought since the 1950s. In 2012, sixty four

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.189
percent of the US was listed as moderately
to extremely dry. All this drought and devastation

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:08.670
recalls the Dust Bowl of the 1930s. When in
1934 sixty eight percent of the country was

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.569
extremely dry.

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:14.510
Recent research from scientists at the ARC
Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.870
found the reason that drought was so bad.
The surface temperatures of the Pacific Ocean

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.860
ends up controlling the jet stream. As it
moves across the country, the stream carries

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:27.200
storms like a conveyor belt. When the ocean
heats up, it can move those storms North into

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.940
Canada or further East, skipping over the
West and Great Plains. So that’s one of

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.370
the reasons the West is so dry.

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.010
And that’s what happened in the Dust Bowl.
Parts of the surface water in Pacific Ocean

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:43.300
warmed up in 1934 and 1936. The coastline
from Alaska to LA saw unseasonably warm temperatures,

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.959
that would be bad enough, but stuff was going
on on the other side of the country too. Small

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:52.239
spots of surface water ALSO warmed up off
the coast of Maine and Nova Scotia.

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:56.370
These two hot spots changed air pressure and
weather patterns. This change led to less

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.209
rainfall and “created perfect conditions
for scorching hot temperatures to develop

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.849
in the heart of the US." according to one
of the authors of the study.

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:09.209
Making matters worse, poor agricultural practices
ruined soil creating huge dust storms. This

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.459
atmospheric dust created a positive feedback
loop on the high pressure systems to move

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:14.849
the water elsewhere.

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:18.849
A similar warming occurred recently off the
coast of Maine, possibly leading to the dry

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:24.379
spell of 2011-2012. But luckily there wasn’t
an increase in temperatures on the Pacific

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:27.629
Coast line. While we lucked out that time,
the researchers stress that these kind of

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:31.840
events are more likely to happen thanks to
climate change. Some estimates say we could

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.129
face the worst drought in a millennia if things
stay the same.

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:38.819
So where are we going to get more fresh water
from? Well some people think the ocean could

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:45.819
save us, Julian doesn’t think so. To find
out why, check out this video right here.

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:58.769
Alright guys what do you think could fix the
drought? Let us know down in the comments

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:02.530
below or if you have any questions about weather
leave those too and we could answer them in

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.459
