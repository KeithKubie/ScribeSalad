GILBERT STRANG: Hi.

00:00:00.941 --> 00:00:02.090
I'm Gilbert Strang.

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:05.540
I'm a math professor at MIT.

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.110
CLEVE MOLER: And
I'm Cleve Moler.

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.530
I'm one of the
founders of MathWorks,

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.930
and I'm chief mathematician.

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.580
Gil and I have
made a video series

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.529
about ordinary
differential equations.

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:22.070
GILBERT STRANG: This
developed really

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:29.050
from my experience of
the linear algebra class.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.299
It's videotaped and
shown on OpenCourseWare.

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:37.430
And it was my first
time to discover

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.630
that millions of people
were learning, watching it.

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:47.600
And it just seemed
possible to tackle

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.120
the other major undergraduate
courses after calculus.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.660
The other lead in to
engineering and science.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.680
Differential equations with
the two sides of the formulas

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.019
and the computations.

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.260
CLEVE MOLER: This is not only
for students that are currently

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.910
in school, after calculus.

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.430
But it's also for
lifelong learners.

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.340
People who want to come
back to this material,

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.540
maybe after years out of school.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.540
We want to help people who
are using MATLAB to solve

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.180
differential equations.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:36.410
To understand the
MATLAB ODE suite.

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.620
To turn the black
boxes into grey boxes,

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.110
where you have
some understanding

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.284
of the mathematics
that underlies them.

00:01:44.284 --> 00:01:46.200
GILBERT STRANG: Really,
differential equations

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.100
is the expression, the
mathematical expression

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.720
of change.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:56.380
So engineering, finance,
economics, life sciences,

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:02.480
medical sciences where you're
seeing things change over time.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.310
Those are modeled by
differential equations.

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.550
So we want to understand
what does solutions

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.100
look like for formulas?

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.940
And what do they look
like for numbers?

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.765
For actual quantities.

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.120
CLEVE MOLER: Gil and
I are matrix guys.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.320
Our professional lives have
been involved with matrices.

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.210
And MATLAB started life
as Matrix Laboratory.

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.580
Here we are doing
differential equations.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.180
Why is that?

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.100
That's because matrices are
fundamental in understanding

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.090
modern differential equations.

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.100
Systems of ordinary
differential equations

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.080
are the key to understanding
modern applications

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.730
of differential equations.

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.120
GILBERT STRANG: We
hope you enjoy it.
