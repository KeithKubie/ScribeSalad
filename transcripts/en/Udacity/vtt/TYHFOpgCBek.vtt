00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.839
If I had to guess, which you are kind of making me

00:00:01.839 --> 00:00:06.270
do, I would say, well, for one thing, the number of parameters is

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.260
infinite. Right? Because if it's some convex polygon, and we're not putting any

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.760
bound on the number of sides on that polygon, then to specify it,

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.570
you have to give what the points are for each of the vertices

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.240
and the, you know, as the number of sides grows, the number of

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.760
parameters grows. So it's, it's unbounded. So it could be that the vc

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.380
dimensions is going to end up being unbounded but they do seem you know

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.450
at the limit they turn into circles and circles ended up being

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:31.850
a vc dimensions of three so maybe, you know, maybe it's three.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.890
&gt;&gt; Maybe. So, so actually you, you, you've really sort of stumbled on

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.890
the right answer there, or maybe not so stumbled, on, on to the answer

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:44.480
there. So, in the limit, convex polygons become circles. Right? So

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:50.400
draw a circle for me, okay, now, let's sort of try to do this smartly, so put a

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.820
point on the edge of the circle, yeah I like how

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.220
you placed that, so pretty clearly you could come up with a

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.670
convex polygon that puts that either in or outside of it

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.640
right? Because you know, there is only one point, thats pretty easy.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.030
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and the circle is kind of irrelevant.

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.710
&gt;&gt; Yeah the circle is kind of irrelevant, but its going to be

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.050
part of my little trick. So put another point on the circle somewhere.

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.745
And in the same way we've been doing it before with lines,

00:01:12.745 --> 00:01:15.440
you know, you can put both of the inside a convex polygon or

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.943
outside, you know, you can do all the labels. I think

00:01:17.943 --> 00:01:21.390
that's pretty easy to see. Now try three. So, the first thing

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.700
I want you to notice Michael, is that if I look at

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.300
those three points and I connected them together, what do I get?

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.320
&gt;&gt; Oh a triangle!

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.272
&gt;&gt; I get a triangle which is by the way, it starts with a C.

00:01:31.272 --> 00:01:33.860
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] A sheep that has the

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.660
number of vertices equal to your favorite number.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.868
&gt;&gt; That's right. But it's also a kind

00:01:37.868 --> 00:01:40.260
of geometric shape, it starts with an A.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.542
&gt;&gt; It

00:01:40.542 --> 00:01:42.669
starts with a

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:43.292
&gt;&gt; It starts with AC?

00:01:43.292 --> 00:01:44.625
&gt;&gt; Appaplectic.

00:01:44.625 --> 00:01:49.494
&gt;&gt; No it starts with a C. AC, Accenuated. No it starts with the letter C.

00:01:49.494 --> 00:01:50.470
&gt;&gt; Oh. Convex.

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.790
&gt;&gt; Yes. It's actually convex polygon. Try

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.670
putting a fourth point on there. And in

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.449
fact put the fifth point. And a sixth

00:01:56.449 --> 00:01:58.660
point. Now, here's my question. We've put all

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.220
of these points on this circle, right? Now

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.970
let's just say it's a unicircle because it's

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.140
easy to think about it. So we put all these points on the circle. Do you

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.130
think we could shatter this with a convex polygon?

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.020
&gt;&gt; To shatter it? Right, to give it all possible labellings. Well,

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.760
let me draw the polygon. So each one being in or out.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.560
&gt;&gt; Well, the thing is, the way you've drawn this polygon, all of them are

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.290
in. So, if you used this polygon, what would you be labeling those six points?

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.330
&gt;&gt; All positive.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.720
&gt;&gt; All positive. What if I didn't want you to label one of

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.190
the points positive? Pick one of the points. Any point will do. So if

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.050
I don't want that to be in the polygon, what do I have to do?

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.430
&gt;&gt; Just push the, the corresponding vertex a little bit inside.

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.300
&gt;&gt; Right. And the easiest way to do that would be not to

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.960
have a vertex there at all but simply not to connect that point.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:48.485
&gt;&gt; Oh. It's kind of like a, a rubber band art or

00:02:48.485 --> 00:02:51.239
string art if we just kind of pop that one out. [NOISE]

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.030
&gt;&gt; Right. So, ant point you'd, of those

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.390
six points you don't want to be labeled positive.

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.350
Just don't connect in as a part of your polygon.

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.050
&gt;&gt; I see. So, for any given pattern or subset, which

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.890
is what we need to be able to show, that, you know,

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.570
when we're shattering, we need to show that no matter what the

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:10.770
subset is, there's going to be some. Hypothesis that labels it appropriately.

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.730
You're saying, well just, you know, label the points as plus and

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.820
minus, and connect up the pluses. It's going to leave the minuses

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.180
outside because they're going to be on the edge of the circle. And

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.460
the pluses are all going to be in the polygon because they

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:23.250
touch the edges of it.

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.890
&gt;&gt; Yeah, because they are in fact the vertices. And in this

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.290
case you just think of the fact that if there's only two positive

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.910
points a line is a very, very simple convex polygon and if

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.890
there's only one point, then a point is a very simple convex polygon.

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.370
&gt;&gt; So the VC dimension is six!

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.480
&gt;&gt; No! So what happens if I had seven points? Could I do it?

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.410
&gt;&gt; So the VC dimension is seven!

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.640
&gt;&gt; What if I had eight points? Could I do it? It's the same trick.

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:48.550
We can make it eight.

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:50.240
&gt;&gt; So, can we make it nine?

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.890
&gt;&gt; No.

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:53.600
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.850
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.810
&gt;&gt; So, at what point can we stop?

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.970
&gt;&gt; When we run out of tape for the recording.

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.940
&gt;&gt; Exactly. So that means that the number of points that we can

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:07.120
capture this way is in fact unbounded. Which means the VC dimension is infinite.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.440
&gt;&gt; Nice example.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:09.610
&gt;&gt; Now, I do want to point out that

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.480
there's a, a teensy tiny little point here that,

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.930
that we sort of skipped over, but I can explain in

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.100
five seconds, which is we made polygons. We didn't actually argue that

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.350
they were convex, but they are convex, because they're all inside

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:27.110
the unit circle, and by construction, every, any polygon whose vertices are

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.990
on the unit circle will be convex. So it's just that's

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.520
why we needed a circle, that's why we were being clever with

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.860
it, but there you go. So we have a polygon that

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.610
we can always draw with those the right thing and because its

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.098
always subtended by it's circle it will be convex.

00:04:40.098 --> 00:04:43.582
So we have actually found a vc dimension that's infinite

00:04:43.582 --> 00:04:46.858
[CROSSTALK]. Or a hypothesis class that has a vc dimension.

00:04:46.858 --> 00:04:48.662
[CROSSTALK] It has to be infinite, yeah that's what I

00:04:48.662 --> 00:04:51.996
said. We have actually found the hypothesis class whose vc

00:04:51.996 --> 00:04:54.796
dimention is infinite and we came up with a proof

00:04:54.796 --> 00:04:57.596
where y would be that case, and nicely, I think

00:04:57.596 --> 00:05:02.360
very nicely connects with the observation you made earlier. That,

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.210
somehow, it connects with the number parameters. I think it's kind of

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:07.900
cool. I mean, you, you, end up with a circle, not

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.950
having a very good VC dimension, a very high VC dimension,

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:14.550
but convex polygons, which somehow seem not to be as cool

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:18.949
as circles, are in fact, in fact have infinite VC dimension.

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:22.195
Okay so there you go so we've done some practice of

00:05:22.195 --> 00:05:24.760
VC dimensions. So you've given me all this VC dimension stuff,

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.450
I agree that it's cool Michael, but what does it have to

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:30.670
do with, what we started out this conversation with? How does that

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:35.670
answer my question about the natural log of an infinite hypothesis space?
