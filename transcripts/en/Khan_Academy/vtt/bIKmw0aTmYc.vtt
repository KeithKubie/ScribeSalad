00:00:00.567 --> 00:00:01.900
Voiceover:We've got some apples here

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:03.433
and we've got some oranges and what

00:00:03.433 --> 00:00:06.733
I want to think about
is, what is the ratio,

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.900
what is the ratio of apples ...

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.000
Of apples, to oranges?

00:00:15.633 --> 00:00:17.333
To oranges.

00:00:18.633 --> 00:00:21.566
To clarify what we're even talking about,

00:00:21.566 --> 00:00:24.033
a ratio is giving us the relationship

00:00:24.033 --> 00:00:26.734
between quantities of 2 different things.

00:00:27.234 --> 00:00:28.500
So there's a couple of ways that we

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.800
can specify this.

00:00:29.967 --> 00:00:32.200
We can literally count
the number of apples.

00:00:32.233 --> 00:00:34.200
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:36.400
So we have 6 apples.

00:00:37.033 --> 00:00:39.033
And we can say the ratio is going to be

00:00:39.033 --> 00:00:43.134
6 to, 6 to ...

00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:44.733
And then how many oranges do we have?

00:00:44.766 --> 00:00:48.600
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.733
It is 6 to 9.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.266
The ratio of apples to oranges is 6 to 9.

00:00:55.792 --> 00:00:57.500
And you could use a different notation.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.933
You could also write it this way.

00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:00.966
6 to ...

00:01:00.966 --> 00:01:05.133
You would still read the
ratio as being 6 to 9.

00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:07.833
But we don't have to
just satisfy us with this

00:01:07.833 --> 00:01:09.934
because one way to think about ratios,

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.766
especially if we're thinking about apples

00:01:11.766 --> 00:01:14.700
to oranges, is how many apples do we have

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.533
for a certain number of oranges?

00:01:16.766 --> 00:01:18.100
When you think about it that way, we can

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.566
actually reduce these
numbers, as you might

00:01:20.566 --> 00:01:22.466
have already thought about.

00:01:22.633 --> 00:01:26.600
Both 6 and 9 are divisible by 3.

00:01:26.967 --> 00:01:29.300
So just like we can reduce fractions,

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.267
we can also reduce ratios.

00:01:31.433 --> 00:01:35.100
So if you divide 6 and 9 both by 3.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.001
6 divided by 3 is 2.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.800
6 divided by 3 is 2.

00:01:40.033 --> 00:01:42.733
And 9 divided by 3 is 3.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.833
So we could also say that the ratio

00:01:44.833 --> 00:01:48.000
of apples to oranges is 2 to 3.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.034
Or if we want to use this notation,

00:01:50.034 --> 00:01:54.266
2 to 3.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.134
2 to 3.

00:01:56.166 --> 00:01:57.233
Now, does that make sense?

00:01:57.233 --> 00:01:58.400
Well look.

00:01:58.967 --> 00:02:00.733
We divided each of these groups into 3.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.301
So one way to think about it ...

00:02:02.301 --> 00:02:06.400
If you divide this whole
total into 3 groups.

00:02:06.966 --> 00:02:09.866
So 1 group, 1 group.

00:02:10.433 --> 00:02:13.066
2 groups, 2 groups.

00:02:14.366 --> 00:02:16.266
And 3 equal groups.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.233
We see that in each of those groups,

00:02:19.233 --> 00:02:22.367
for every 2 apples, for every 2 apples,

00:02:22.367 --> 00:02:23.734
we have 3 oranges.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.066
For 2 apples we have 3 oranges.

00:02:26.233 --> 00:02:29.267
For 2 apples we have 3 oranges.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.300
So, once again, the ratio
of apples to oranges.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.000
For every 2 apples we have 3 oranges.

00:02:35.366 --> 00:02:36.767
But we could think about
things the other way

00:02:36.767 --> 00:02:38.000
around as well.

00:02:38.167 --> 00:02:40.667
We could also think about
what is the ratio ...

00:02:41.366 --> 00:02:44.066
We could also think about
what is the ratio ...

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.266
Ratio, of oranges to apples?

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.200
Oranges to apples.

00:02:52.566 --> 00:02:54.233
And here we would, essentially, switch

00:02:54.233 --> 00:02:55.266
the numbers.

00:02:55.833 --> 00:03:00.466
The ratio of oranges to apples.

00:03:00.633 --> 00:03:03.433
Notice, up here we said apples to oranges

00:03:03.433 --> 00:03:07.167
which is 6 to 9 or 2
to 3 if we reduce them.

00:03:07.167 --> 00:03:08.633
And here we're going to say the ratio of

00:03:08.633 --> 00:03:11.000
oranges to apples, so
we've swapped these 2.

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.600
So we're going to swap the numbers.

00:03:13.033 --> 00:03:15.400
Here we have 9 oranges for every 6 apples.

00:03:15.633 --> 00:03:21.200
So we could say the ratio
is going to be 9 to 6.

00:03:22.033 --> 00:03:23.734
The ratio is 9 to 6.

00:03:24.033 --> 00:03:26.500
Or if we want to reduce
it, for every 3 oranges ...

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.466
So we're going to divide this by 3.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.766
So for every 3 oranges we are going

00:03:30.766 --> 00:03:33.600
to have 2 apples.

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.466
We are going to have 2 apples.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.233
So notice, this is just
exactly what we had

00:03:38.233 --> 00:03:41.300
up here, but when we had apples to oranges

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:42.666
it was 6 to 9.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.734
6 apples for every 9 oranges.

00:03:44.833 --> 00:03:47.033
And now when it's
oranges to apples, we say

00:03:47.033 --> 00:03:48.466
it's 9 to 6.

00:03:48.568 --> 00:03:50.600
9 oranges for every 6 apples.

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.766
Or we could say for
every 3 oranges we have

00:03:53.766 --> 00:03:56.533
exactly 2 apples.
