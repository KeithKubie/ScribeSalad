of the scan and scanning tunneling

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210
of the scan and scanning tunneling
 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.920
of the scan and scanning tunneling
microscope now this is a device that it

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930
microscope now this is a device that it
 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.840
microscope now this is a device that it
enables us to look at the surface of

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850
enables us to look at the surface of
 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.660
enables us to look at the surface of
objects at the atomic scale by means of

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670
objects at the atomic scale by means of
 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.520
objects at the atomic scale by means of
a probe which paths skims over the

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530
a probe which paths skims over the
 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.890
a probe which paths skims over the
surface and records variations in the

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:42.900
surface and records variations in the
 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.550
surface and records variations in the
topography below it with minut current

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:46.560
topography below it with minut current
 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.120
topography below it with minut current
fluctuations what did this device enable

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:50.130
fluctuations what did this device enable
 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:51.889
fluctuations what did this device enable
us to see for the first time that we

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899
us to see for the first time that we
 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.420
us to see for the first time that we
hadn't seen before as you say your

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430
hadn't seen before as you say your
 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.069
hadn't seen before as you say your
surface structures in a different way I

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079
surface structures in a different way I
 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.260
surface structures in a different way I
mean you had some ideas about certain

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270
mean you had some ideas about certain
 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.230
mean you had some ideas about certain
surface structures but you never saw it

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240
surface structures but you never saw it
 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.050
surface structures but you never saw it
in so to speak in real space so it's

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060
in so to speak in real space so it's
 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.320
in so to speak in real space so it's
just like if you would trace a surface

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330
just like if you would trace a surface
 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.170
just like if you would trace a surface
with your finger you see so you see it

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180
with your finger you see so you see it
 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.130
with your finger you see so you see it
in the real space and then of course

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140
in the real space and then of course
 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.800
in the real space and then of course
actually you see the electrons on the

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810
actually you see the electrons on the
 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.260
actually you see the electrons on the
surface it's it's electronic wave

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270
surface it's it's electronic wave
 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.440
surface it's it's electronic wave
functions and and so you also can see

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450
functions and and so you also can see
 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:41.980
functions and and so you also can see
certain properties you can see you can

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990
 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.380
you can test the hardness of a surface

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390
you can test the hardness of a surface
 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.050
you can test the hardness of a surface
but then of course in this in the same

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060
but then of course in this in the same
 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.130
but then of course in this in the same
way you also can take atoms the

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140
way you also can take atoms the
 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.140
way you also can take atoms the
principle is the same as if you take

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.150
principle is the same as if you take
 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:55.940
principle is the same as if you take
your fingers and you play around with

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950
your fingers and you play around with
 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.539
your fingers and you play around with
small balls and the things this if you

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549
small balls and the things this if you
 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.910
small balls and the things this if you
take none of things the small balls can

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920
take none of things the small balls can
 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.460
take none of things the small balls can
be atoms and it's exactly the same thing

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:04.470
be atoms and it's exactly the same thing
 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.830
be atoms and it's exactly the same thing
you can they take an atom you can put it

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840
you can they take an atom you can put it
 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.199
you can they take an atom you can put it
somewhere else or you can take your

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209
somewhere else or you can take your
 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.540
somewhere else or you can take your
fingers and glide over the surface and

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550
fingers and glide over the surface and
 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.780
fingers and glide over the surface and
feel the surface

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790
feel the surface
 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.300
feel the surface
feel the bumps and salt so it's the same

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310
feel the bumps and salt so it's the same
 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.220
feel the bumps and salt so it's the same
fingers you can do two chops you can

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230
fingers you can do two chops you can
 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.559
fingers you can do two chops you can
change it or you can feel it you see you

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569
change it or you can feel it you see you
 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:23.789
change it or you can feel it you see you
can detect it or you can move it around

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:23.799
can detect it or you can move it around
 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:26.490
can detect it or you can move it around
you can play with it yes right and what

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500
you can play with it yes right and what
 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.709
you can play with it yes right and what
in those early days of using it what

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:28.719
in those early days of using it what
 

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:30.390
in those early days of using it what
were the first surprises that came up

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400
were the first surprises that came up
 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.679
were the first surprises that came up
because as you said you sort of had an

00:02:31.679 --> 00:02:31.689
because as you said you sort of had an
 

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:33.569
because as you said you sort of had an
idea and then you could actually see

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:33.579
idea and then you could actually see
 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:36.210
idea and then you could actually see
what what surprises turned out I think

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220
what what surprises turned out I think
 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.670
what what surprises turned out I think
the first surprise was that video they

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680
the first surprise was that video they
 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.220
the first surprise was that video they
could do it with atomic resolution you

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230
could do it with atomic resolution you
 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.240
could do it with atomic resolution you
see actually that you can do it with

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250
see actually that you can do it with
 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.179
see actually that you can do it with
atomic resolution that's inherent in the

00:02:48.179 --> 00:02:48.189
atomic resolution that's inherent in the
 

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:51.330
atomic resolution that's inherent in the
approach we took but we didn't expect it

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340
approach we took but we didn't expect it
 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.610
approach we took but we didn't expect it
that they could make such fine fingers

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620
that they could make such fine fingers
 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.530
that they could make such fine fingers
but then every every point of a needle

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540
but then every every point of a needle
 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.409
but then every every point of a needle
ends up with one atom and this very

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:01.419
ends up with one atom and this very
 

00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:04.530
ends up with one atom and this very
adamant that's then your finger you see

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540
adamant that's then your finger you see
 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.890
adamant that's then your finger you see
and that's this atom is there has the

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900
and that's this atom is there has the
 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.170
and that's this atom is there has the
size of an atom and so you can feel

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180
size of an atom and so you can feel
 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.720
size of an atom and so you can feel
other atoms that's and that was a

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730
other atoms that's and that was a
 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.330
other atoms that's and that was a
pleasant surprise that you could do it

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340
pleasant surprise that you could do it
 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.379
pleasant surprise that you could do it
relatively easy I mean on the subject of

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:19.389
relatively easy I mean on the subject of
 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:20.969
relatively easy I mean on the subject of
being able to do it it seems

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:20.979
being able to do it it seems
 

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:23.159
being able to do it it seems
unimaginably complex to make such a

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:23.169
unimaginably complex to make such a
 

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:25.110
unimaginably complex to make such a
thing that you have because you are

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.120
thing that you have because you are
 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.689
thing that you have because you are
talking about atoms in almost in contact

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:27.699
talking about atoms in almost in contact
 

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:29.039
talking about atoms in almost in contact
with other atoms there has been no

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049
with other atoms there has been no
 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:31.409
with other atoms there has been no
vibration you're talking about a probe

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:31.419
vibration you're talking about a probe
 

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:33.809
vibration you're talking about a probe
which is as you say one atom thick at

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:33.819
which is as you say one atom thick at
 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:39.030
which is as you say one atom thick at
its tip one the mind boggles how did how

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040
its tip one the mind boggles how did how
 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.289
its tip one the mind boggles how did how
did you have the confidence to even

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:40.299
did you have the confidence to even
 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:41.849
did you have the confidence to even
imagine that one could do such a thing

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:41.859
imagine that one could do such a thing
 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:44.909
imagine that one could do such a thing
to make such an instrument or let's say

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:44.919
to make such an instrument or let's say
 

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:52.080
to make such an instrument or let's say
we didn't see any any obstacle which

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090
we didn't see any any obstacle which
 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.500
we didn't see any any obstacle which
could not be our could not be overcome

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510
could not be our could not be overcome
 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:58.920
could not be our could not be overcome
and of course there were quite a few

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930
and of course there were quite a few
 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.589
and of course there were quite a few
fort wishes developments in the whole

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:01.599
fort wishes developments in the whole
 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:04.860
fort wishes developments in the whole
thing but somehow luck was on our side

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870
thing but somehow luck was on our side
 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.890
thing but somehow luck was on our side
but I think you always I mean in science

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900
but I think you always I mean in science
 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.159
but I think you always I mean in science
you need love if you see that sir

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:11.169
you need love if you see that sir
 

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:13.920
you need love if you see that sir
and if you don't have to look in a

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930
and if you don't have to look in a
 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:15.479
and if you don't have to look in a
specific case then you do something

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489
specific case then you do something
 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:17.460
specific case then you do something
different you might have luck in

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470
different you might have luck in
 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.839
different you might have luck in
something else so that's you see it was

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:21.849
something else so that's you see it was
 

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:23.480
something else so that's you see it was
less difficult

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490
less difficult
 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.590
less difficult
finally when everybody's home

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600
finally when everybody's home
 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.050
finally when everybody's home
that's why everybody thought you could

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060
that's why everybody thought you could
 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.280
that's why everybody thought you could
not do it and that's why nobody did it

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:32.290
not do it and that's why nobody did it
 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.700
not do it and that's why nobody did it
and that's I would say a crucial thing

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710
and that's I would say a crucial thing
 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.370
and that's I would say a crucial thing
in science you see everything is new

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380
in science you see everything is new
 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.610
in science you see everything is new
because other people think you cannot do

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620
because other people think you cannot do
 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.030
because other people think you cannot do
it or because other people do not

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:46.040
it or because other people do not
 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.010

important and we live of novelty in

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440
important and we live of novelty in
 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.570
important and we live of novelty in
science so whenever you do something new

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:55.580
science so whenever you do something new
 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:59.080
science so whenever you do something new
you have to overcome certain belief that

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090
you have to overcome certain belief that
 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.450
you have to overcome certain belief that
it cannot be done that it is not

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460
it cannot be done that it is not
 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.990
it cannot be done that it is not
interesting and so on so I mean it's

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000
interesting and so on so I mean it's
 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.140
interesting and so on so I mean it's
interesting to ask why you and get then

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150
interesting to ask why you and get then
 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:12.250
interesting to ask why you and get then
it believed that you could do it that

other people were were bounded by the
 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.780
other people were were bounded by the
limitations of what they thought they

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:16.790
limitations of what they thought they
 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:19.000
limitations of what they thought they
could do you too felt that there were no

could do you too felt that there were no
 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.960

insurmountable you use a phrase in your

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:22.340
insurmountable you use a phrase in your
 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:24.130
insurmountable you use a phrase in your
autobiography that you wrote for when

you when you receive the Nobel Prize
that you'd lost your respect for

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:27.200
that you'd lost your respect for
 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.680
that you'd lost your respect for
angstroms and that's a lovely phrase an

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:29.690
angstroms and that's a lovely phrase an
 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:31.360

you okay okay I did I did in my PhD

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:34.430
you okay okay I did I did in my PhD

we sang star dimensions just

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:39.740
we sang star dimensions just
 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:41.980
we sang star dimensions just
mechanically so I weren't scared of the

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:41.990
mechanically so I weren't scared of the
 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:47.470
mechanically so I weren't scared of the
size and you see this work and so in

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:47.480
size and you see this work and so in
 

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.590
size and you see this work and so in
principle at that time I knew you can

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:50.600
principle at that time I knew you can
 

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.380
principle at that time I knew you can
measure angstroms you see mechanically

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:53.390
measure angstroms you see mechanically
 

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:56.890
measure angstroms you see mechanically
of the more or less mechanically so why

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:56.900
of the more or less mechanically so why
 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:58.720
of the more or less mechanically so why
shouldn't you be able to do it in this

00:05:58.720 --> 00:05:58.730
shouldn't you be able to do it in this
 

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:04.390
shouldn't you be able to do it in this
way and so in retrospect it's always

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400
way and so in retrospect it's always
 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.860
way and so in retrospect it's always
easy yes or let's put it this way when I

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:08.870
easy yes or let's put it this way when I
 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:12.580
easy yes or let's put it this way when I
give lectures to the public I always

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:12.590
give lectures to the public I always
 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:14.170

it you go home and still wonder what the

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:23.300
it you go home and still wonder what the
 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:27.310
it you go home and still wonder what the
disguise - and if I explain it to you in

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:27.320
disguise - and if I explain it to you in
 

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.490
disguise - and if I explain it to you in
terms that you understand it then you

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:30.500
terms that you understand it then you
 

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.800
terms that you understand it then you
ask yourself what for something such

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:32.810
ask yourself what for something such
 

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:37.000
ask yourself what for something such
simple you get the Nobel Prizes

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:37.010
 

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:40.960
okay in any case it worked out nicely

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:40.970
okay in any case it worked out nicely
 

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:44.750

yes yes indeed there's another phrase

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:44.760
yes yes indeed there's another phrase
 

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.090
yes yes indeed there's another phrase
you use you talk about the

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:47.100
you use you talk about the
 

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:48.980
you use you talk about the
lightheartedness of your approach that

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:48.990
lightheartedness of your approach that
 

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:51.590
lightheartedness of your approach that
you you approach things with perhaps

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:51.600
you you approach things with perhaps
 

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.590
you you approach things with perhaps
less seriousness I don't know that maybe

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:54.600
less seriousness I don't know that maybe
 

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:57.530
less seriousness I don't know that maybe
that's not the right word there was less

00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:57.540
that's not the right word there was less
 

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:00.050
that's not the right word there was less
sort of it was less momentous to do what

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:00.060
sort of it was less momentous to do what
 

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:01.670
sort of it was less momentous to do what
you were doing then then other people

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:01.680
you were doing then then other people
 

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.760
you were doing then then other people
might have felt it was about to be yes

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:04.770
might have felt it was about to be yes
 

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:07.790
might have felt it was about to be yes
okay I think both get Bennigan's IV are

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:07.800
okay I think both get Bennigan's IV are
 

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:13.280
okay I think both get Bennigan's IV are
not not the types who are who how would

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:13.290
not not the types who are who how would

not not the types who are who how would
you say would hang themselves because of

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:15.720
you say would hang themselves because of
 

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:19.880
you say would hang themselves because of
a failure and the second thing is in

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:19.890
a failure and the second thing is in
 

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:22.520
a failure and the second thing is in
either IBM laboratory we had really the

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:22.530
either IBM laboratory we had really the
 

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:25.730
either IBM laboratory we had really the
freedom of doing things and especially

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:25.740
freedom of doing things and especially
 

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:28.960
freedom of doing things and especially
that sort of get it always explained it

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:28.970
that sort of get it always explained it
 

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:33.310
that sort of get it always explained it
we had the freedom to make mistakes and

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:33.320
we had the freedom to make mistakes and
 

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.270
we had the freedom to make mistakes and
so I think that's something very

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:35.280
so I think that's something very
 

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:38.420
so I think that's something very
important and unfortunately it is

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:38.430
important and unfortunately it is
 

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:42.350
important and unfortunately it is
freedom for scientists gets more and

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:42.360
freedom for scientists gets more and
 

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.690
freedom for scientists gets more and
more lost you see all the agencies

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:44.700
more lost you see all the agencies
 

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:48.160
more lost you see all the agencies
everybody is looking at scientists and

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:48.170
everybody is looking at scientists and
 

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:51.020
everybody is looking at scientists and
but they should be able to make mistakes

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:51.030
but they should be able to make mistakes
 

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:53.450
but they should be able to make mistakes
then they can correct it you see

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:53.460
then they can correct it you see
 

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:55.820
then they can correct it you see
otherwise you just do the common things

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:55.830
otherwise you just do the common things
 

00:07:55.830 --> 00:08:00.140
otherwise you just do the common things
you don't dare to do something something

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:00.150
you don't dare to do something something
 

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:04.190
you don't dare to do something something

a different physicists are treated a
 

00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:33.140
a different physicists are treated a
little bit differently there or yes you

00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:33.150
little bit differently there or yes you
 

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:35.270

I was working on her on a set of

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:00.190
I was working on her on a set of
 

00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:02.900
I was working on her on a set of
problems before and I thought somehow I

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:02.910
problems before and I thought somehow I
 

00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:08.280
problems before and I thought somehow I
came now I came as far as I could go

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:08.290
came now I came as far as I could go

that's in clinical phenomenon and that

00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:16.060
that's in clinical phenomenon and that
 

00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:18.600
that's in clinical phenomenon and that
was a very interesting topic and it was

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:18.610
was a very interesting topic and it was
 

00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:20.610
was a very interesting topic and it was
more or less at the top of it the

00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:20.620
more or less at the top of it the
 

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:24.480
more or less at the top of it the
interests so by making everything

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:24.490
interests so by making everything
 

00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:27.890

smaller inhomogeneities play a more

00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:27.900
smaller inhomogeneities play a more
 

00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:32.010
smaller inhomogeneities play a more
important role so if you have a an oxide

00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:32.020
important role so if you have a an oxide
 

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:37.500
important role so if you have a an oxide
which has a few holes then the

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:37.510
which has a few holes then the
 

00:11:37.510 --> 00:11:39.750
which has a few holes then the
conduction of electricity through this

00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:39.760
conduction of electricity through this
 

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:43.590
conduction of electricity through this
oxide is maybe a little bit larger now

00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:43.600
oxide is maybe a little bit larger now
 

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:46.950
oxide is maybe a little bit larger now
if you have 100 holes then you have the

00:11:46.950 --> 00:11:46.960
if you have 100 holes then you have the
 

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:49.260
if you have 100 holes then you have the
same type of if you make another batch

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:49.270
same type of if you make another batch
 

00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:53.460
same type of if you make another batch
of oxide you might have 98 holes and

00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:53.470
of oxide you might have 98 holes and
 

00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:56.460
of oxide you might have 98 holes and
then maybe the conductivity would be

00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:56.470
then maybe the conductivity would be
 

00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:59.280
then maybe the conductivity would be
different it simply by 2 percent so the

00:11:59.280 --> 00:11:59.290
different it simply by 2 percent so the
 

00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:02.730
different it simply by 2 percent so the
fluctuation from piece to piece is still

00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:02.740
fluctuation from piece to piece is still
 

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:05.400
fluctuation from piece to piece is still
small but if you make things smaller and

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:05.410
small but if you make things smaller and
 

00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:09.000
small but if you make things smaller and
smaller then you mind up at patches

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:09.010
smaller then you mind up at patches
 

00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:11.730
smaller then you mind up at patches
where you just have 2 or 3 holes you see

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:11.740
where you just have 2 or 3 holes you see
 

00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:14.850
where you just have 2 or 3 holes you see
now maybe this one has two holes and

00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:14.860
now maybe this one has two holes and
 

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:16.980
now maybe this one has two holes and
this one has three holes and this one

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:16.990
this one has three holes and this one
 

00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:21.150
this one has three holes and this one
has one hole so then the holes effective

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:21.160
has one hole so then the holes effective
 

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:24.720
has one hole so then the holes effective
conductivity moves so then in one case

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:24.730
conductivity moves so then in one case
 

00:12:24.730 --> 00:12:28.350
conductivity moves so then in one case
you would have a tremendous conductivity

00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:28.360
you would have a tremendous conductivity
 

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:30.870
you would have a tremendous conductivity
and in the other case would have a

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:30.880
and in the other case would have a
 

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:33.360
and in the other case would have a
conductivity which is 2 times less or

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:33.370
conductivity which is 2 times less or
 

00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:35.550
conductivity which is 2 times less or
something like that and that these are

00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:35.560
something like that and that these are
 

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:38.550
something like that and that these are
the fluctuations from from piece to

00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:38.560
the fluctuations from from piece to
 

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:41.820
the fluctuations from from piece to
piece which cannot be tailed tolerated

00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:41.830
piece which cannot be tailed tolerated
 

00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:45.980
piece which cannot be tailed tolerated
in miniaturization and so that's an idea

00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:45.990
in miniaturization and so that's an idea
 

00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:49.020
in miniaturization and so that's an idea
to work along these lines and nobody did

00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:49.030
to work along these lines and nobody did

it really an IPM and it was an important
 

00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:55.530
it really an IPM and it was an important
problem now in this case it was in

many different ways of there where
inhomogeneities play an important role

00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:04.840
inhomogeneities play an important role
 

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:07.890
inhomogeneities play an important role

see expert opinions have a difficulty to
 

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:22.939
see expert opinions have a difficulty to

then now you make it so that that seems

or is it that there's just no pressure
 

00:15:41.129 --> 00:15:44.660
or is it that there's just no pressure
to think about new ways because they're

to think about new ways because they're
 

00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:47.780
to think about new ways because they're
already the expert in this and and

suddenly you have to make your mark it's

suddenly you have to make your mark it's
 

00:15:52.889 --> 00:15:55.129
suddenly you have to make your mark it's
just the pressure of people's

not because of external pressure yes yes

00:16:05.239 --> 00:16:05.249
not because of external pressure yes yes
 

00:16:05.249 --> 00:16:08.629

yes there are I would say an expert in a

00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:20.239
field he isn't is narrow or it's a
narrow way of thinking and then he has

00:16:20.239 --> 00:16:20.249
narrow way of thinking and then he has
 

00:16:20.249 --> 00:16:26.030

Binnig he came to your lab at the

00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:19.720
Binnig he came to your lab at the
 

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:21.750
Binnig he came to your lab at the
beginning of the project to develop STM

00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:21.760
beginning of the project to develop STM
 

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:24.690
beginning of the project to develop STM
and it was obviously extremely fruitful

00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:24.700
and it was obviously extremely fruitful
 

00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:27.360
and it was obviously extremely fruitful
how did that work he was your he was

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:27.370
how did that work he was your he was
 

00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:32.730
how did that work he was your he was
your employee but is he he was not my

00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:32.740
your employee but is he he was not my
 

00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:36.419
your employee but is he he was not my
employee that's okay I was his manager

but there we take a little bit a

00:18:39.509 --> 00:18:39.519
but there we take a little bit a
 

00:18:39.519 --> 00:18:44.399
but there we take a little bit a
different attitude I had the opportunity

00:18:44.399 --> 00:18:44.409
different attitude I had the opportunity
 

00:18:44.409 --> 00:18:46.860
different attitude I had the opportunity
or I had the opportunity to get

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:46.870
or I had the opportunity to get
 

00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:49.860
or I had the opportunity to get
something for this type of problems for

00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:49.870
something for this type of problems for
 

00:18:49.870 --> 00:18:52.769
something for this type of problems for
the in homogeneity problem and I found I

00:18:52.769 --> 00:18:52.779
the in homogeneity problem and I found I
 

00:18:52.779 --> 00:18:55.230
the in homogeneity problem and I found I
was fortunate enough to find gap pinic

00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:55.240
was fortunate enough to find gap pinic
 

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:58.320
was fortunate enough to find gap pinic
and then we started discussing and he

00:18:58.320 --> 00:18:58.330
and then we started discussing and he
 

00:18:58.330 --> 00:19:03.149
and then we started discussing and he
liked it that's why he came and then I

00:19:03.149 --> 00:19:03.159
liked it that's why he came and then I
 

00:19:03.159 --> 00:19:06.269
liked it that's why he came and then I
think in many case he was the technical

00:19:06.269 --> 00:19:06.279
think in many case he was the technical
 

00:19:06.279 --> 00:19:10.460
think in many case he was the technical
crucial figure in the whole in the whole

00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:10.470

crucial figure in the whole in the whole
development you see and we discussed

00:19:15.629 --> 00:19:15.639
development you see and we discussed
 

00:19:15.639 --> 00:19:19.710
development you see and we discussed
everything I mean he is he's the most

00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:19.720
everything I mean he is he's the most
 

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:24.960

relationship and did you recognize it
immediately was it apparent from the

00:19:39.419 --> 00:19:39.429
immediately was it apparent from the
 

00:19:39.429 --> 00:19:40.680
immediately was it apparent from the
beginning that it was all gay it was

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:40.690
beginning that it was all gay it was
 

00:19:40.690 --> 00:19:45.050
beginning that it was all gay it was
just the perfect the perfect partnership

00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:45.060
 

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:49.370
no because I think that I think he he he

00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:49.380
no because I think that I think he he he
 

00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:52.340
no because I think that I think he he he
recognized it earlier studied me but you

00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:52.350
recognized it earlier studied me but you
 

00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:54.680
recognized it earlier studied me but you
see I'm older so I'm a little bit more

00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:54.690

worked full-time he was my technician
 

00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:13.100
worked full-time he was my technician
but then he didn't work with me anymore

00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:13.110
but then he didn't work with me anymore
 

00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:17.020
but then he didn't work with me anymore
fever for this problem you see that

00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:17.030
fever for this problem you see that
 

00:21:17.030 --> 00:21:21.680
fever for this problem you see that
that's also something you see it's

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:21.690
that's also something you see it's
 

00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:29.040
that's also something you see it's
always at least I

00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:29.050
 

00:21:29.050 --> 00:21:31.740
it's maybe not always easy to start

00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:31.750
it's maybe not always easy to start
 

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:35.400
it's maybe not always easy to start
something new but but it's getting more

tell you first what they would need for

00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:46.990
tell you first what they would need for
 

00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:48.810
tell you first what they would need for
doing something you because they don't

00:21:48.810 --> 00:21:48.820
doing something you because they don't
 

00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:50.700
doing something you because they don't
really want to give up what they have

00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:50.710
really want to give up what they have
 

00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:55.350
really want to give up what they have
and this step for me it was clear okay

00:21:55.350 --> 00:21:55.360
and this step for me it was clear okay
 

00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:58.110
and this step for me it was clear okay

management with the new thing we still

00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:49.030
management with the new thing we still
 

00:22:49.030 --> 00:22:51.840
management with the new thing we still
carried on certain all the experiments

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:51.850
carried on certain all the experiments
 

00:22:51.850 --> 00:22:53.730
carried on certain all the experiments
from before and they were successful

00:22:53.730 --> 00:22:53.740
from before and they were successful
 

00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:57.780
from before and they were successful
enough that we could present ourself as

00:22:57.780 --> 00:22:57.790
enough that we could present ourself as
 

00:22:57.790 --> 00:23:00.210
enough that we could present ourself as
still good scientist with the old work

00:23:00.210 --> 00:23:00.220
still good scientist with the old work
 

00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:04.710
still good scientist with the old work
and that's why the new work was never we

00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:04.720
and that's why the new work was never we
 

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:06.990
and that's why the new work was never we
didn't expose ourselves with the new

00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:07.000
didn't expose ourselves with the new
 

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.040
didn't expose ourselves with the new
work only when it inverted and that was

00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:11.050
work only when it inverted and that was
 

00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:13.650
work only when it inverted and that was
I think that's very that's very

00:23:13.650 --> 00:23:13.660
I think that's very that's very
 

00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:16.169
I think that's very that's very
important that you do not expose

00:23:16.169 --> 00:23:16.179
important that you do not expose
 

00:23:16.179 --> 00:23:19.590
important that you do not expose
yourself with something new because then

00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:19.600
yourself with something new because then
 

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:22.230
yourself with something new because then
you have to start to make promises you

00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:22.240
you have to start to make promises you
 

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:24.990
you have to start to make promises you
see sooner or later and I saw too many

00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:25.000
see sooner or later and I saw too many
 

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.410
see sooner or later and I saw too many
technique failures in technology where

00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:28.420
technique failures in technology where
 

00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:32.910
technique failures in technology where
people expose them too early and maybe

00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:32.920
people expose them too early and maybe
 

00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:35.580
people expose them too early and maybe
started to tell things which were a

00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:35.590
started to tell things which were a
 

00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:38.130
started to tell things which were a
little bit exaggerated or turned out to

00:23:38.130 --> 00:23:38.140
little bit exaggerated or turned out to
 

00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:41.490
little bit exaggerated or turned out to
be exaggerated and then you came into a

00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:41.500
be exaggerated and then you came into a
 

00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:42.030
be exaggerated and then you came into a
more

00:23:42.030 --> 00:23:42.040
more
 

00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:44.910
more
their promises and the reality started

00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:44.920
their promises and the reality started
 

00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:48.870
their promises and the reality started
to diverge more and more I suppose to a

00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:48.880
to diverge more and more I suppose to a
 

00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:50.730
to diverge more and more I suppose to a
certain extent one might even say that

00:23:50.730 --> 00:23:50.740
certain extent one might even say that
 

00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:52.110
certain extent one might even say that
that was the case with bed nose and

00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:52.120
that was the case with bed nose and
 

00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:54.600
that was the case with bed nose and
moolah can a superconductive ceramics

00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:54.610
moolah can a superconductive ceramics
 

00:23:54.610 --> 00:23:56.340
moolah can a superconductive ceramics
because the promises there were enormous

00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:56.350
because the promises there were enormous
 

00:23:56.350 --> 00:23:59.010
because the promises there were enormous
yeah but she never she never talked

00:23:59.010 --> 00:23:59.020
yeah but she never she never talked
 

00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:02.070
yeah but she never she never talked
about deep night any they never expose

00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:02.080
about deep night any they never expose
 

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:05.940
about deep night any they never expose
themselves before yes

00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:05.950
themselves before yes
 

00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:08.160
themselves before yes
so that's internal exposure but then

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:08.170
so that's internal exposure but then
 

00:24:08.170 --> 00:24:11.070
so that's internal exposure but then
there's also external exposure the point

00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:11.080
there's also external exposure the point
 

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:12.750
there's also external exposure the point
at which you start telling the world in

00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:12.760
at which you start telling the world in
 

00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:15.180
at which you start telling the world in
general what you're doing but now they

00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:15.190
general what you're doing but now they
 

00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:18.240
general what you're doing but now they
only may need to work yeah and then see

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:18.250
only may need to work yeah and then see
 

00:24:18.250 --> 00:24:20.100
only may need to work yeah and then see
a lot of people that are very skeptic

00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:20.110
a lot of people that are very skeptic
 

00:24:20.110 --> 00:24:23.010
a lot of people that are very skeptic
that's right yeah but okay that that was

00:24:23.010 --> 00:24:23.020
that's right yeah but okay that that was
 

00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:28.140
that's right yeah but okay that that was
their problem and so what wonderful

00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:28.150
their problem and so what wonderful
 

00:24:28.150 --> 00:24:34.650
their problem and so what wonderful
devil-may-care and I mean we knew what

00:24:34.650 --> 00:24:34.660
devil-may-care and I mean we knew what
 

00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:38.190
devil-may-care and I mean we knew what
we were doing doing that was real and if

00:24:38.190 --> 00:24:38.200
we were doing doing that was real and if
 

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:40.440
we were doing doing that was real and if
people thought that you cannot do it

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:40.450
people thought that you cannot do it
 

00:24:40.450 --> 00:24:43.350
people thought that you cannot do it
even if you could do it that's I think

00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:43.360
even if you could do it that's I think
 

00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:50.070
even if you could do it that's I think
that's their problem okay and in 1986

00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:50.080
that's their problem okay and in 1986
 

00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:53.340
that's their problem okay and in 1986
if basically the technique had been

00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:53.350
if basically the technique had been
 

00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:56.520
if basically the technique had been
proved and very rapidly you were awarded

00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:56.530
proved and very rapidly you were awarded
 

00:24:56.530 --> 00:24:58.740
proved and very rapidly you were awarded
the Nobel Prize on the back of lots of

00:24:58.740 --> 00:24:58.750
the Nobel Prize on the back of lots of
 

00:24:58.750 --> 00:25:01.770
the Nobel Prize on the back of lots of
other prizes as well did did that change

00:25:01.770 --> 00:25:01.780
other prizes as well did did that change
 

00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:04.200
other prizes as well did did that change
everything very radically for you did or

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:04.210
everything very radically for you did or
 

00:25:04.210 --> 00:25:06.570
everything very radically for you did or
did life continue just pretty much I

00:25:06.570 --> 00:25:06.580
did life continue just pretty much I
 

00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:11.820
did life continue just pretty much I
think okay I think the recognition we

00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:11.830
think okay I think the recognition we
 

00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:14.580
think okay I think the recognition we
got already before I mean let's say the

00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:14.590
got already before I mean let's say the
 

00:25:14.590 --> 00:25:16.980
got already before I mean let's say the
recognition in the scientific community

00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:16.990
recognition in the scientific community
 

00:25:16.990 --> 00:25:19.560
recognition in the scientific community
the esteem then of course a Nobel Prize

00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:19.570
the esteem then of course a Nobel Prize
 

00:25:19.570 --> 00:25:23.550
the esteem then of course a Nobel Prize
such maybe discontinuity in the whole

00:25:23.550 --> 00:25:23.560
such maybe discontinuity in the whole
 

00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:30.030
such maybe discontinuity in the whole
thing but surely changed a few things I

00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:30.040
thing but surely changed a few things I
 

00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:31.950
thing but surely changed a few things I
mean okay you are then a Nobel laureate

00:25:31.950 --> 00:25:31.960
mean okay you are then a Nobel laureate
 

00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:35.610
mean okay you are then a Nobel laureate
that's aa little bit different how do

00:25:35.610 --> 00:25:35.620
that's aa little bit different how do
 

00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:39.780
that's aa little bit different how do
you say extra elevation yes yes that's

00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:39.790
you say extra elevation yes yes that's
 

00:25:39.790 --> 00:25:43.200
you say extra elevation yes yes that's
so but on the other hand I mean you

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:43.210
so but on the other hand I mean you
 

00:25:43.210 --> 00:25:44.880
so but on the other hand I mean you
haven't been something different you

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:44.890
haven't been something different you
 

00:25:44.890 --> 00:25:47.340
haven't been something different you
didn't get it didn't become somebody

00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:47.350
didn't get it didn't become somebody
 

00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:49.950
didn't get it didn't become somebody
different you've got the same person

00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:49.960
different you've got the same person
 

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:52.170
different you've got the same person
with the same physics knowledge

00:25:52.170 --> 00:25:52.180
with the same physics knowledge
 

00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:53.170
with the same physics knowledge
everything

00:25:53.170 --> 00:25:53.180
everything
 

00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:55.990
everything
and I think we also could behave this

00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:56.000
and I think we also could behave this
 

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.070
and I think we also could behave this
video so that made life easier for us

00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:00.080
video so that made life easier for us
 

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:07.840
video so that made life easier for us
and for everybody around us and STM was

00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:07.850
and for everybody around us and STM was
 

00:26:07.850 --> 00:26:10.600
and for everybody around us and STM was
one of the building blocks of what I

00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:10.610
one of the building blocks of what I
 

00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:12.490
one of the building blocks of what I
suppose one might call the net the the

00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:12.500
suppose one might call the net the the
 

00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:14.500
suppose one might call the net the the
nanoscience revolution it was one of

00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:14.510
nanoscience revolution it was one of
 

00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:18.870
nanoscience revolution it was one of
them it opened up a whole new area to

00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:18.880
them it opened up a whole new area to
 

00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:22.570
them it opened up a whole new area to
view and that I'd like to ask you a

00:26:22.570 --> 00:26:22.580
view and that I'd like to ask you a
 

00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:23.920
view and that I'd like to ask you a
little bit about the word I used their

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:23.930
little bit about the word I used their
 

00:26:23.930 --> 00:26:25.990
little bit about the word I used their
revolution because nanoscience is seen

00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:26.000
revolution because nanoscience is seen
 

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.440
revolution because nanoscience is seen
as a revolution is that a corrector is

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:29.450
as a revolution is that a corrector is
 

00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:31.330
as a revolution is that a corrector is
it changing the way we look at the world

00:26:31.330 --> 00:26:31.340
it changing the way we look at the world
 

00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:37.060
it changing the way we look at the world
I think that evolution has to have a

00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:37.070
I think that evolution has to have a
 

00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:40.150
I think that evolution has to have a
little bit more sensors to scale it's

00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:40.160
little bit more sensors to scale it's
 

00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:45.100
little bit more sensors to scale it's
blue that it was getting to a smaller

00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:45.110
blue that it was getting to a smaller
 

00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:48.220
blue that it was getting to a smaller
and smaller cane scale that was always

00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:48.230
and smaller cane scale that was always
 

00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:49.960
and smaller cane scale that was always
the beginning of further evolution I

00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:49.970
the beginning of further evolution I
 

00:26:49.970 --> 00:26:53.170
the beginning of further evolution I
mean you're from that from the exploring

00:26:53.170 --> 00:26:53.180
mean you're from that from the exploring
 

00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:56.740
mean you're from that from the exploring
the world with since Columbus you see

00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:56.750
the world with since Columbus you see
 

00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:59.440
the world with since Columbus you see
that was the world scale and then came

00:26:59.440 --> 00:26:59.450
that was the world scale and then came
 

00:26:59.450 --> 00:27:02.820
that was the world scale and then came
the Industrial Revolution that was the

00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:02.830
the Industrial Revolution that was the
 

00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:06.490
the Industrial Revolution that was the
macro scale - let's say - down to the

00:27:06.490 --> 00:27:06.500
macro scale - let's say - down to the
 

00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:10.330
macro scale - let's say - down to the
micrometer as a precision scale and then

00:27:10.330 --> 00:27:10.340
micrometer as a precision scale and then
 

00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:13.900
micrometer as a precision scale and then
came the IT revolution the information

00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:13.910
came the IT revolution the information
 

00:27:13.910 --> 00:27:16.600
came the IT revolution the information
technology revolution that was in the

00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:16.610
technology revolution that was in the
 

00:27:16.610 --> 00:27:21.850
technology revolution that was in the
scale of micrometer and so but you see

00:27:21.850 --> 00:27:21.860
scale of micrometer and so but you see
 

00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:24.070
scale of micrometer and so but you see
it wasn't the micro revolution it was

00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:24.080
it wasn't the micro revolution it was
 

00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:29.860
it wasn't the micro revolution it was
really it was the information technology

00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:29.870
really it was the information technology
 

00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:32.620
really it was the information technology
revolution another one was saying does

00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:32.630
revolution another one was saying does
 

00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:35.110
revolution another one was saying does
the revolution so I would I would hate

00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:35.120
the revolution so I would I would hate
 

00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:37.390
the revolution so I would I would hate
to say the Nano revolution you see it

00:27:37.390 --> 00:27:37.400
to say the Nano revolution you see it
 

00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:39.190
to say the Nano revolution you see it
has to have a little bit more substance

00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:39.200
has to have a little bit more substance
 

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:43.000
has to have a little bit more substance
i i i have someone i know what the truth

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:43.010
i i i have someone i know what the truth
 

00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:47.740
i i i have someone i know what the truth
or i have i I have my expectations what

00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:47.750
or i have i I have my expectations what
 

00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:50.890
or i have i I have my expectations what
will be what could happen but I don't

00:27:50.890 --> 00:27:50.900
will be what could happen but I don't
 

00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:56.560
will be what could happen but I don't
have a word for it so now so now just

00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:56.570
have a word for it so now so now just
 

00:27:56.570 --> 00:27:59.800
have a word for it so now so now just
getting smaller alone does not make the

00:27:59.800 --> 00:27:59.810
getting smaller alone does not make the
 

00:27:59.810 --> 00:28:03.010
getting smaller alone does not make the
revolution I mean also for the for the

00:28:03.010 --> 00:28:03.020
revolution I mean also for the for the
 

00:28:03.020 --> 00:28:04.930
revolution I mean also for the for the
micro tech

00:28:04.930 --> 00:28:04.940
micro tech
 

00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:08.890
micro tech
you have to have a transistor which

00:28:08.890 --> 00:28:08.900
you have to have a transistor which
 

00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:12.280
you have to have a transistor which
really changed and the way you could do

00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:12.290
really changed and the way you could do
 

00:28:12.290 --> 00:28:14.740
really changed and the way you could do
things and I think also the

00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:14.750
things and I think also the
 

00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:18.160
things and I think also the
nanotechnology you have to have a few

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:18.170
nanotechnology you have to have a few
 

00:28:18.170 --> 00:28:22.480
nanotechnology you have to have a few
more ideas the way you will approach new

00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:22.490
more ideas the way you will approach new
 

00:28:22.490 --> 00:28:24.760
more ideas the way you will approach new
things we know a little bit what could

00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:24.770
things we know a little bit what could
 

00:28:24.770 --> 00:28:29.020
things we know a little bit what could
be the end of it but but how to do it we

00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:29.030
be the end of it but but how to do it we
 

00:28:29.030 --> 00:28:33.360
be the end of it but but how to do it we
don't know yet it is one point that

00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:33.370
don't know yet it is one point that
 

00:28:33.370 --> 00:28:36.850
don't know yet it is one point that
having reached the nano scale the atomic

00:28:36.850 --> 00:28:36.860
having reached the nano scale the atomic
 

00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:39.460
having reached the nano scale the atomic
scale we've really reached the limits of

00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:39.470
scale we've really reached the limits of
 

00:28:39.470 --> 00:28:41.500
scale we've really reached the limits of
miniaturization we can't really go

00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:41.510
miniaturization we can't really go
 

00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:45.820
miniaturization we can't really go
smaller so I will guess all yes and so

00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:45.830
smaller so I will guess all yes and so
 

00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:48.220
smaller so I will guess all yes and so
that's I think we hit the point you see

00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:48.230
that's I think we hit the point you see
 

00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:51.910
that's I think we hit the point you see
and we are already very close we have

00:28:51.910 --> 00:28:51.920
and we are already very close we have
 

00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:54.880
and we are already very close we have
covered of the miniaturization over the

00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:54.890
covered of the miniaturization over the
 

00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:57.400
covered of the miniaturization over the
last 50 as we have current are covered

00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:57.410
last 50 as we have current are covered
 

00:28:57.410 --> 00:29:01.240
last 50 as we have current are covered
two-thirds or three-quarters and there

00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:01.250
two-thirds or three-quarters and there
 

00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:04.150
two-thirds or three-quarters and there
is just a little bit to go the difficult

00:29:04.150 --> 00:29:04.160
is just a little bit to go the difficult
 

00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:07.570
is just a little bit to go the difficult
bit to the nano so just getting smaller

00:29:07.570 --> 00:29:07.580
bit to the nano so just getting smaller
 

00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:11.260
bit to the nano so just getting smaller
is not it's not all you see I think nano

00:29:11.260 --> 00:29:11.270
is not it's not all you see I think nano
 

00:29:11.270 --> 00:29:13.450
is not it's not all you see I think nano
has to offer like a bit different things

00:29:13.450 --> 00:29:13.460
has to offer like a bit different things
 

00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:17.170
has to offer like a bit different things
than just being smaller in order to

00:29:17.170 --> 00:29:17.180
than just being smaller in order to
 

00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:20.350
than just being smaller in order to
become a revolution and I think nano

00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:20.360
become a revolution and I think nano
 

00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:24.580
become a revolution and I think nano
office really completely new prospects

00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:24.590

in in many ways would you care to

00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:27.470
in in many ways would you care to
 

00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:32.260
in in many ways would you care to
speculate on let's say properties are

very much different on the nano scale

00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:34.430
very much different on the nano scale
 

00:29:34.430 --> 00:29:36.880
very much different on the nano scale
sensor of the micro scale and on the

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:36.890
sensor of the micro scale and on the
 

00:29:36.890 --> 00:29:41.980
sensor of the micro scale and on the
macro scale the ways we can do things

00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:41.990
macro scale the ways we can do things
 

00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:47.170
macro scale the ways we can do things
are also different you enter really very

00:29:47.170 --> 00:29:47.180
are also different you enter really very
 

00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:51.130
are also different you enter really very
closely the area of quantum mechanics

00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:51.140
closely the area of quantum mechanics
 

00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:54.160
closely the area of quantum mechanics
you see you are at that state domain of

00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:54.170
you see you are at that state domain of
 

00:29:54.170 --> 00:29:57.880
you see you are at that state domain of
atoms or molecules and then you can

00:29:57.880 --> 00:29:57.890
atoms or molecules and then you can
 

00:29:57.890 --> 00:30:02.290
atoms or molecules and then you can
think about what how do you work so far

00:30:02.290 --> 00:30:02.300
think about what how do you work so far
 

00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:03.970
think about what how do you work so far
we made things smaller by

00:30:03.970 --> 00:30:03.980
we made things smaller by
 

00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:07.600
we made things smaller by
miniaturization now when you talk about

00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:07.610
miniaturization now when you talk about
 

00:30:07.610 --> 00:30:10.090
miniaturization now when you talk about
atoms and molecules you think in terms

00:30:10.090 --> 00:30:10.100
atoms and molecules you think in terms
 

00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:13.360
atoms and molecules you think in terms
of building up something from the very

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:13.370
of building up something from the very
 

00:30:13.370 --> 00:30:14.230
of building up something from the very
small

00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:14.240

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:21.090

that there are there are many many ways

00:30:21.090 --> 00:30:21.100
 

00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:25.840
justtake molecular recognition we would

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:25.850
justtake molecular recognition we would
 

00:30:25.850 --> 00:30:29.470
justtake molecular recognition we would
like to be able to recognize other

00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:29.480
like to be able to recognize other
 

00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:33.549
like to be able to recognize other
molecules by a specific molecule such as

00:30:33.549 --> 00:30:33.559
molecules by a specific molecule such as
 

00:30:33.559 --> 00:30:37.570
molecules by a specific molecule such as
like nature does it you see and I think

00:30:37.570 --> 00:30:37.580
like nature does it you see and I think
 

00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:43.840
like nature does it you see and I think
we see that we can do that so I would

00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:43.850
we see that we can do that so I would
 

00:30:43.850 --> 00:30:48.940
we see that we can do that so I would
say the great merit of the STM is not

00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:48.950
say the great merit of the STM is not
 

00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:51.250
say the great merit of the STM is not
just being able to make these fantastic

00:30:51.250 --> 00:30:51.260
just being able to make these fantastic
 

00:30:51.260 --> 00:30:53.770
just being able to make these fantastic
pictures and so on but I think the great

00:30:53.770 --> 00:30:53.780
pictures and so on but I think the great
 

00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:57.669
pictures and so on but I think the great
merit is really that we take now atoms

00:30:57.669 --> 00:30:57.679
merit is really that we take now atoms
 

00:30:57.679 --> 00:31:05.799
merit is really that we take now atoms
and molecules and small small structures

00:31:05.799 --> 00:31:05.809
and molecules and small small structures
 

00:31:05.809 --> 00:31:08.190
and molecules and small small structures
of molecules we take them as an

00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:08.200
of molecules we take them as an
 

00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:11.140
of molecules we take them as an
addressable individual you know this is

00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:11.150
addressable individual you know this is
 

00:31:11.150 --> 00:31:13.510
addressable individual you know this is
this atom we want to do something with

00:31:13.510 --> 00:31:13.520
this atom we want to do something with
 

00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:16.780
this atom we want to do something with

new way of handling matter and doing

new way of handling matter and doing
 

00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:41.560
new way of handling matter and doing
things with matter but absolutely at one

00:31:41.570 --> 00:31:43.840

than it is a subject people want to

than it is a subject people want to
define it as a subject but it has to be

define it as a subject but it has to be
 

00:31:51.770 --> 00:31:53.169
define it as a subject but it has to be
interdisciplinary because it's involved

a atom scale and molecules can you do

a atom scale and molecules can you do
not have disciplines okay the

00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:06.050
not have disciplines okay the
 

00:32:06.050 --> 00:32:10.419
not have disciplines okay the
disciplines emerged when you go to

00:32:10.419 --> 00:32:10.429
disciplines emerged when you go to
 

00:32:10.429 --> 00:32:13.620
disciplines emerged when you go to
larger and larger things that was in the

00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:13.630
larger and larger things that was in the
 

00:32:13.630 --> 00:32:18.220
larger and larger things that was in the
take 300 years ago or foreign you didn't

00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:18.230
take 300 years ago or foreign you didn't
 

00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:20.530
take 300 years ago or foreign you didn't
talk about physics or what abilities and

00:32:20.530 --> 00:32:20.540
talk about physics or what abilities and
 

00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:22.890
talk about physics or what abilities and
then afterwards you had the disciplines

00:32:22.890 --> 00:32:22.900
then afterwards you had the disciplines
 

00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:25.050
then afterwards you had the disciplines
and now we are moving back to the

00:32:25.050 --> 00:32:25.060
and now we are moving back to the
 

00:32:25.060 --> 00:32:28.560
and now we are moving back to the
original way the nanotechnology and so

00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:28.570
original way the nanotechnology and so
 

00:32:28.570 --> 00:32:32.390
original way the nanotechnology and so
the disciplines merge again I think it's

00:32:32.390 --> 00:32:32.400
the disciplines merge again I think it's
 

00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:36.600
the disciplines merge again I think it's
naturally development that's that's a

naturally development that's that's a
 

00:32:36.610 --> 00:32:38.850
naturally development that's that's a
nice drawing to a close of things I just

00:32:38.850 --> 00:32:38.860
nice drawing to a close of things I just
 

00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:41.810
nice drawing to a close of things I just
like to ask one last question which is

00:32:41.810 --> 00:32:41.820
like to ask one last question which is
 

00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:44.490
like to ask one last question which is
based around the idea of moving fields

moving from field to field what do you

00:32:49.050 --> 00:32:49.060
moving from field to field what do you
 

00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:51.440
moving from field to field what do you

was also the interesting aspect when we

00:33:15.780 --> 00:33:15.790
was also the interesting aspect when we
 

00:33:15.790 --> 00:33:18.270

started with the whole Sigma Nu when the

00:33:18.270 --> 00:33:18.280
started with the whole Sigma Nu when the
 

00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:22.380

ones you see the surface scientists

00:33:28.110 --> 00:33:28.120
ones you see the surface scientists
 

00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:31.260

later but but now it's quite interesting

00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:38.230
later but but now it's quite interesting
