00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:02.682
Hm.
&gt;&gt; What's up?

00:00:02.682 --> 00:00:05.806
&gt;&gt; So it looks like I
misspelled my email here as

00:00:05.806 --> 00:00:11.070
americanguyw1521@mail.com instead
of @gmail.com.

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.330
But it's still letting me log in.

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:16.320
&gt;&gt; Actually yeah, it's not really
checking whether the email address

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.400
actually exists or
whether you own the email.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.110
It just kind of checks whether it's
formatted like an email address.

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:22.110
&gt;&gt; Hm, interesting.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.412
&gt;&gt; Wait, so hypothetically,

00:00:25.412 --> 00:00:30.205
someone else could sign in with
someone else's personal email address.

00:00:30.205 --> 00:00:32.930
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I guess, if they wanted to.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.500
&gt;&gt; Intriguing.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.170
&gt;&gt; Shoot.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.240
I think I forgot my password.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.758
Does that mean I'm locked
out of my account?

00:00:39.758 --> 00:00:43.380
&gt;&gt; No, here, let me log in,
I can reset it.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:44.000
&gt;&gt; No, that's okay.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.169
I'll just make another one
under my correct email address.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.570
What?
It looks like it's already taken.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.863
I bet it was J.P.

00:00:54.863 --> 00:00:59.496
[NOISE].
