00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.180
- Welcome to a conversation with history.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.700
I'm Harry Kreisler

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.840
of the Institute of International Studies.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.280
Our guest today is David Cole,

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.150
who is the national legal
director of the ACLU

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.920
and a professor at Georgetown
University Law Center,

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.110
a volunteer attorney

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.390
for the Center for Constitutional Rights,

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.630
the legal affairs
correspondent for The Nation,

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.190
and a regular contributor to
The New York Review of Books.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.050
He is the author of 10 books,

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.010
and his books have
received multiple awards,

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.130
including the American Book Award

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:07.300
for Enemy Aliens: Double Standards

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.350
and Constitutional Freedoms
in the War on Terrorism.

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.980
His first book was No Equal Justice,

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.550
and his most recent book
is Engines of Liberty.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:20.760
He has litigated many
significant constitutional cases

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:22.562
in the Supreme Court

00:01:22.562 --> 00:01:27.562
and he is Berkeley's
2018 Jefferson Lecturer.

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.650
David, welcome to Berkeley.

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:30.730
- Thanks for having me.

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:32.700
- Where were you born and raised?

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.910
- Well, I was born in Princeton,

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.100
raised outside of New Haven, Connecticut,

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.880
and then in Evanston, Illinois,

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.960
but I've been on the East
Coast ever since college.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.990
- And looking back, how did your parents

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.333
influence your thinking about the world?

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.850
- Well, my parents were deeply
interested in education.

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.810
My dad was an English professor,

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.650
first at Yale and then at Northwestern.

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.060
My mom was a public school teacher.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.390
They were also deeply Catholic

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.500
and deeply liberal,

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.110
and so, I think, taught
me to care about ideas

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.840
and to care about education,

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.100
but mostly to care about the vulnerable

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.760
and to care about social justice.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.460
- And what got you interested
in law and civil liberties?

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.240
- Well, I kinda backed into
law and civil liberties.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.770
I went to Yale undergraduate,

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.113
and was an English major.

00:02:26.434 --> 00:02:29.570
When I graduated, I thought I
wanted to become a journalist,

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.563
but I hadn't written for
the school newspaper.

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.050
I had written lots of
papers as an English major,

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.240
but I'd been on the swim team,

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.623
so you spend most of your time underwater.

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.550
So I thought, I'll try freelancing,

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.820
but I have to justify my existence

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.750
while I'm freelancing,
and one of the options

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.780
was continuing my liberal arts education

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.940
by applying to Yale Law
School, which I did.

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.470
It was the only law school I applied to,

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.780
'cause I had zero interest
in being a lawyer,

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.710
but I liked being in New Haven

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:07.320
and I heard that Yale Law School

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.950
was a way to continue a
liberal arts education, really.

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.050
I got wait-listed

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.400
and I made other plans,

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.100
and then the very end of the summer,

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.600
August 1980, I guess,

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.880
I got a call, I was actually in Colorado,

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:26.887
got a call from my mom, saying,

00:03:26.887 --> 00:03:28.747
"The Yale Law School just called.

00:03:28.747 --> 00:03:30.297
"If you can be there in a week,

00:03:31.187 --> 00:03:32.280
"you have a space."

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.770
So I was clearly the last
person to get into that class.

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:38.330
Somebody at the last minute
must have pulled out,

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:39.780
they said, "How are we
gonna fill this slot?"

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.290
And then I went and I still didn't really,

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.340
I still had the view I
wanted to be a journalist.

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.720
I started writing for the Yale Daily News,

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.790
covering and doing theater reviews

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.810
and music reviews and film reviews,

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.470
'cause that was my passion.

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.080
I was interested in the classes,

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.050
but I didn't really think
I wanted to be a lawyer.

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:58.980
I took time off from law
school because I thought,

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.290
oh my God, I'm gonna graduate,

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.510
I'm gonna have to become a lawyer,

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.190
and I interned at the Atlantic

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.780
the first semester I took off,

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.210
and then I was gonna intern at The Nation

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:10.010
the next semester that I took off.

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.920
But in between that
time, I worked at a place

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.650
called the Center for
Constitutional Rights,

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.770
a non-profit law firm in New York,

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:21.390
and it transformed my view

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.250
and I said, "I wanna be a lawyer."

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:24.287
I called The Nation and said,

00:04:24.287 --> 00:04:26.237
"I'm not gonna come and be your intern.

00:04:26.237 --> 00:04:28.037
"I'm gonna stay and work

00:04:28.037 --> 00:04:30.220
"for the Center for
Constitutional Rights,"

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.030
and indeed, that was my first job

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.040
after graduating and clerking.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.500
- Well, you've just explained to us

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.589
why your 10 books are
so beautifully written.

00:04:40.589 --> 00:04:41.650
- [David] Aw.

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:42.600
Well, thank you, thank you so much.

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:43.950
- Yeah, no, it's really true,

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.693
because for a layman,

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:52.020
it leads you into some really
important ideas in the law.

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.760
I like to ask my guests what they think

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.530
is a skillset and temperament

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.990
required for the kind of work they do,

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.063
in your case a lawyer, civil
liberties lawyer, and so on.

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.250
- Tenacity is important,

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.023
because these are long battles.

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.393
I never forget I took a case on in 1987,

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.730
a group of Palestinian immigrants

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:24.730
who were rounded up in early dawn raids

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.910
and locked up in high-security,

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:29.693
and alleged to be deportable,

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:32.960
not for having engaged
in any kind of criminal

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.150
or terrorist activities,
but for their affiliation

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:36.210
with a PLO group.

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:40.740
And I got involved in
the case at the outset,

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.833
and that case lasted for 21 years.

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:49.323
So it started under Ronald Reagan,

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.170
Ed Meese was the attorney general,

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:55.240
and it continued under George H.W. Bush.

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.490
It continued under Bill Clinton.

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:59.550
It continued under George W. Bush.

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:04.550
And ultimately in 2008 the
government finally gave up

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.663
and allowed our people to remain here.

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:13.470
So you gotta kind of keep
your eye on the long ball.

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:15.450
You also, I think, have to be...

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.500
Willing to see the other
side of an argument,

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:24.600
because to be effective,
either as a professor

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:29.130
or as an advocate, you
really can't just preach

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:30.750
your view of things,

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:33.520
you have to understand
what the opposing view is

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.370
and be able to meet its arguments.

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:37.970
And you only meet those arguments

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:39.520
if you take them seriously.

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.150
And so to be a good professor

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:45.130
you have to force your students
to meet the other side,

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:48.310
other side's arguments, and
to be an effective advocate,

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:51.360
either in the courts or in the legislature

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.060
or in the court of public opinion.

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.240
I think you have to take

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.210
the other side's arguments seriously

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:58.660
and really grapple with them.

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:01.148
- In your book, Engines of Liberty,

00:07:01.148 --> 00:07:04.760
you say, describing the people

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:06.580
who are involved in political activism

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:08.207
which we'll talk about
in a minute, you say,

00:07:08.207 --> 00:07:11.137
"There are defined by
principled commitment

00:07:11.137 --> 00:07:15.267
"to particular ideals, and
they defend those ideals

00:07:15.267 --> 00:07:16.640
"whether popular or not."

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:19.260
So that's another quality.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:20.163
- Exactly.

00:07:21.821 --> 00:07:23.753
And now, at the ACLU,

00:07:24.922 --> 00:07:26.370
in some sense, we're
known for that, right?

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:31.020
We defended the rights of
the Nazis to march in Skokie.

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:34.490
We defended the right
of a white supremacist

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:36.830
to hold a rally in Charlottesville

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:40.170
that ended in terrible, terrible tragedy.

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:45.170
But we defend the rights
of all human beings.

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:49.353
We think they are human rights.

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:54.830
They vest in us because we are human.

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:57.680
They're not owned only by
people who we agree with.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:59.310
And if you hold that view

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:01.640
and you hold that view
in a principled way,

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:03.330
then I think it's incumbent upon you

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:05.830
to fight for those principles

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:10.240
whether you agree or
disagree with the client.

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.740
We recognize this all the time

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:13.600
with criminal defense lawyers, right?

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.690
We don't think criminal defense lawyers

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:20.690
are advocating in favor of
murder, robbery, assault, rape.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.460
They are defending individuals

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:25.940
who are accused of those
kinds of activities,

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:28.110
even many times when the individual

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:30.130
has actually committed those activities,

00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:32.810
in defense of a certain set of rights,

00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:34.410
rights that are owned to everybody

00:08:34.410 --> 00:08:36.570
regardless of what they do

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:39.100
and regardless of their belief systems.

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:41.350
And the same thing is true
of the First Amendment.

00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:44.160
So yeah, I've represented many people

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:46.250
with whom I don't agree,

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:49.310
but I think one of the fortunate things

00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:51.220
I've had as a constitutional lawyer,

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:53.700
as a public interest
constitutional lawyer,

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:56.740
is that I have always been advocating

00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:59.870
for values that I believe in.

00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:02.520
Now, a lot of lawyers
essentially are hired guns.

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:06.340
They do the work of the
client who pays them

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:09.380
and their job is to advance those views

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:11.090
whether or they agree with them or not,

00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:13.730
whereas I've had the luxury of essentially

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:16.310
being able to advocate for free speech,

00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:18.680
for due process, for equal protection,

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:21.430
sometimes on behalf of
people I don't agree with,

00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:25.310
but I always am committed to
the values that I'm advocating.

00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:29.060
- One other aspect of your
writings that comes out

00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:31.100
that relates to this skillset

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:34.440
is kind of an understanding of the law

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:38.720
in the context of the
broader political context.

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:41.090
Where does that come
from in your background,

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:43.340
and talk a little about that.

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:45.150
- So where does that come
from in my background?

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:46.860
I'm not sure.

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:48.470
I mean, my parents, as
I said, were liberal.

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:50.290
They were not particularly activists.

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:51.483
My mom was a kind of,

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:54.400
well, in some sense, she was an activist

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:58.440
in the sense of she always volunteered

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:01.100
for get out the vote drives.

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:03.560
The first time I saw a Barack Obama sign

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:06.640
was when he was running for
state senate in Illinois.

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:08.010
I came home and there it was.

00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:08.970
I had never heard of this guy.

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:09.803
Who is this guy?

00:10:09.803 --> 00:10:10.636
You got a sign up.

00:10:10.636 --> 00:10:12.180
So she was active in that way,

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:17.130
but they weren't demonstrators
or activists of that kind.

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:22.130
You know, I think I
really came to this view,

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:25.390
I guess through a sense of,

00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:26.940
first of all, I was a lawyer

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:30.420
that argued mostly in court.

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:32.310
But as I became a professor,

00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:36.097
I became an advocate for
constitutional rights

00:10:36.097 --> 00:10:40.560
and civil liberties in a variety of forms.

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:42.840
I was doing it in speeches and lectures,

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:45.190
like I'm doing here at Berkeley

00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:46.650
at the Thomas Jefferson Lecture.

00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:48.840
I was doing it in the courtroom

00:10:50.731 --> 00:10:52.550
in continuing to litigate cases.

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:56.580
But I was also doing it in
the field of public opinion,

00:10:56.580 --> 00:11:00.660
writing op-eds, writing
columns for The Nation,

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:02.310
for The New York Review of Books.

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:07.090
And then, several years ago,

00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:11.990
I decided to take a look
at how constitutional law

00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:14.030
really works in this country,

00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:16.320
and that's what led ultimately

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:17.610
to the book Engines of Liberty,

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:19.800
which is an argument that in order

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:22.300
to understand constitutional law,

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:24.930
you can't just read the cases

00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:27.330
and focus on what the courts have said

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:29.900
and what the lawyers before
the courts have argued,

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:32.160
which is basically what we
do in constitutional law

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:35.210
when we teach it in the classroom.

00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:38.040
But that's a really
restricted understanding

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:41.450
of how the law develops, and in fact,

00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:45.110
when you see any serious
development in constitutional law,

00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:49.630
most of the work that is
done to reach that result

00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:52.460
is done outside of the courtroom,

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:55.330
sometimes by lawyers but
often just by citizens,

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:58.020
citizens committed to a particular idea

00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:01.230
and willing to work in
a variety of forums,

00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:03.670
whether it's state
legislature, state courts,

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:08.270
city councils, universities,
religious groups.

00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:10.430
I mean, one of the great
things about America

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:12.640
is, robust as democracy as we have,

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:14.210
is that there are so many forums.

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:16.920
And so if your argument
is not gonna prevail

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:20.480
in the Supreme Court of
the United States today,

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:23.210
then you don't bring a case
to the Supreme Court today.

00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:26.380
But there's lots of other
forums you can choose.

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:30.500
- So before we talk
about your three books,

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:34.530
talk a little and briefly
about your role at the ACLU.

00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:36.710
You've given some sense
of what it's doing,

00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:38.850
but tell us a little about your role

00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:40.520
as the chief attorney.

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:44.510
- Yeah, so I was hired to be
the national legal director

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:47.250
in the summer of 2016.

00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:51.060
The national legal director
oversees all of our work.

00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:54.100
We have 300 attorneys,
100 in the national office

00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:55.770
and then 200 in the affiliates.

00:12:55.770 --> 00:13:00.050
The ACLU has an affiliate
in every state, essentially,

00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:02.470
in the United States, so we
have people on the ground

00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:05.190
at the local level, but we also
have subject matter experts

00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:06.940
at the national level.

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:10.190
And I oversee them all, in some sense,

00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:13.563
but particularly the national legal staff.

00:13:15.646 --> 00:13:17.596
Anything that goes to the Supreme Court

00:13:18.950 --> 00:13:22.120
from the ACLU, a petition
for Supreme Court review

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:24.780
or opposing another side's
petition for Supreme Court review

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:27.220
or a merits case where
we represent a client

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:29.290
or an amicus brief, where we file a brief

00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:30.880
in support of another case

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:33.400
in which we're not the principal lawyers,

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:35.720
those all come through my office.

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:38.470
I have to sign off on them, I edit them,

00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:41.140
I strategize about what they ought to say,

00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:43.960
approve them, and the like.

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:47.320
But the job has changed dramatically

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:50.090
from what I thought it was gonna
be when I accepted the job.

00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:52.560
So think back to the summer of 2016.

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:56.130
I was recruited to this
job by Anthony Romero,

00:13:56.130 --> 00:13:58.170
the executive director, who said to me,

00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:01.497
said, "David, I've got an
offer you can't refuse.

00:14:01.497 --> 00:14:05.427
"You've been practicing
constitutional law for 30-some years

00:14:05.427 --> 00:14:08.537
"under a conservative
majority Supreme Court.

00:14:08.537 --> 00:14:09.967
"Just think what it would be like

00:14:09.967 --> 00:14:14.967
"to help run the ACLU and
run its Supreme Court docket

00:14:15.197 --> 00:14:17.930
"under a liberal majority Supreme Court."

00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:19.050
Because at that time of course

00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:21.630
we all knew Hillary Clinton
was gonna win the presidency,

00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:24.100
she was gonna name Justice
Scalia's successor,

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:27.210
and for the first time in four decades,

00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:31.290
the court would have a liberal majority.

00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:33.430
So I thought, wow, that's
a great opportunity.

00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:35.090
I signed on the bottom line.

00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:36.490
Didn't put in any what-if

00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:40.390
because nobody thought
there'd be any what-if.

00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:43.440
Obviously the job changed
dramatically on November 8th,

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:45.583
when President Trump was elected,

00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:50.430
but in many ways it's a
much more important job now.

00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:54.050
It's more defensive than it is offensive.

00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:56.300
We are now putting out fires

00:14:56.300 --> 00:15:00.050
as much as advancing new concepts

00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:01.610
of constitutional rights and liberties.

00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:05.460
But that's part of what we
are supposed to be about.

00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:08.930
We are the ACLU, we
defend the Bill of Rights.

00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:13.030
When those rights are
attacked, we are most needed.

00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:15.560
I think one of the things
that I find really...

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:20.790
Buoying about this period

00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:24.870
is the incredible citizen engagement

00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:26.970
around civil rights and civil liberties

00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:28.090
from the women's march

00:15:28.090 --> 00:15:29.810
to the people who went out to airports

00:15:29.810 --> 00:15:32.300
to demonstrate against
the Trump muslim ban

00:15:33.558 --> 00:15:37.018
to the town halls about
the Affordable Care Act

00:15:37.018 --> 00:15:38.730
and the like, and we see that at the ACLU.

00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:42.400
So before Trump was elected,
we had 400,000 members.

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:45.343
Today we have 1.75 million members.

00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:47.760
- That's quite a change

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:49.813
and quite a change in the environment.

00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:53.530
Let's take you on a journey

00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:56.480
through some of these ideas in your books.

00:15:56.480 --> 00:16:01.050
Your first book was the one on
the criminal justice system,

00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:04.130
No Equal Justice, and in that book

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:07.920
you raise an important
argument about structure.

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:10.870
In a way it's a theoretical explanation

00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:15.610
of the old French saying
that the law is equal,

00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:19.513
both the rich and the poor
can sleep under the bridge.

00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:25.690
Explain why structure means that a system

00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:30.010
that helps us understand a system

00:16:30.010 --> 00:16:34.610
in which equality before the law,

00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:37.800
even when attempts are
made to implement that,

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:40.430
comes out with different outcomes

00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:44.480
because there's a privileged
part of the society

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:46.180
and then there's the very poor.

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:47.400
- Yeah, yeah.

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:49.540
So yeah, I took the
title, No Equal Justice,

00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:52.480
from a quote from a Supreme
Court opinion that said

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:55.290
something like, there
can be no equal justice

00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:57.610
as long as the kind of trial a man gets

00:16:57.610 --> 00:17:00.330
depends on the amount of money he has.

00:17:00.330 --> 00:17:05.330
And that is a core ideal of
our criminal justice system.

00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:08.070
Everybody has the same rights,

00:17:08.070 --> 00:17:09.490
the rights of criminal defendants.

00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:11.820
Whether Fourth Amendment rights

00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:14.900
with respect to investigations

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:15.990
and searches and seizures,

00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:18.700
or Fifth Amendment rights with
respect to interrogations,

00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:21.070
or Sixth Amendment rights,
which are the rights

00:17:21.070 --> 00:17:23.330
that cover your right to a fair trial,

00:17:23.330 --> 00:17:25.510
your right to a lawyer,

00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:28.730
in that trial your right to
confront witnesses against you.

00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:32.570
Those rights don't apply to the rich.

00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:34.660
They apply to everybody.

00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:36.410
They are across the board rights.

00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:39.160
And, as the court said,
there can be no equal justice

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:40.570
as long as the kind of trial a man gets

00:17:40.570 --> 00:17:42.540
depends upon the amount of money he has.

00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:46.200
But of course, we know that
the kind of trial a man gets

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:47.810
depends upon the amount of money he has

00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:52.220
because if you're poor, you
rely on a public defender

00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:56.490
who often is very committed
and often very good,

00:17:56.490 --> 00:17:58.950
but very overextended.

00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:02.600
If you're rich, you can hire
the best lawyers in the country

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:04.170
and you can hire a big team

00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:08.960
and they can spend incredible
resources defending you,

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:13.620
and you just get a very
different kind of justice.

00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:15.790
So the argument of the book

00:18:17.352 --> 00:18:21.800
is essentially that in name
these rights are equal,

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:25.293
but in practice, in the way they work,

00:18:26.650 --> 00:18:30.080
we have adopted rules

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:31.530
and systems

00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:36.530
that have the effect of
securing these rights

00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:38.400
to the privileged,

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:42.010
but saving on the costs of these rights

00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:46.340
by denying them, effectively,
to the underprivileged.

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:48.760
And what I mean by saving
on the costs of these rights

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:51.570
is that all these rights have costs.

00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:55.010
Most of 'em, there's a cost
between protecting rights

00:18:56.830 --> 00:18:58.850
and protecting our safety.

00:18:58.850 --> 00:19:01.320
If we got rid of the
Fourth Amendment tomorrow,

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:04.170
if we said the police
could search your house

00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:06.520
or your backpack or your car

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:10.740
without any probable cause,
without a warrant from a judge,

00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:14.040
the police would have an
easier time catching criminals,

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:17.750
and they might keep us
more secure from criminals.

00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:20.720
But we would be very
vulnerable to the state.

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:22.890
So there's a balance to be struck there.

00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:24.490
The more you protect privacy,

00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:26.810
the more you make it hard for
the police to do their job

00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:29.310
in the interests of
protecting Americans' privacy,

00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:32.990
the greater risk that
there will be more crime

00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:37.810
that is not captured
and brought to justice.

00:19:37.810 --> 00:19:39.120
And what I argue in the book

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:44.120
is that liberals tend to favor rights

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:49.050
and conservatives tend to favor
protection of public safety.

00:19:49.050 --> 00:19:51.620
But in fact what we
have done in our system

00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:53.683
is we have struck two balances.

00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:59.143
The rich get their rights protected,

00:20:00.010 --> 00:20:03.450
but we save on the costs
in terms of public safety

00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:06.410
that extending those same
rights across the board

00:20:06.410 --> 00:20:09.820
by denying them, effectively,

00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:12.170
to the poor, to minorities, and the like.

00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:13.790
And so you see that in things

00:20:13.790 --> 00:20:17.030
like the right to counsel,

00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:18.560
where, yeah, everybody
has a right to a lawyer

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:20.580
and you have a right to a
lawyer paid for by the state

00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:22.940
if you can't afford one,

00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:27.590
but in reality, the kind of resources

00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:30.730
that we put behind engines of defense

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:34.650
are so limited that public defenders

00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:36.460
and lawyers who defend the poor

00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:41.460
are just incapable of
doing the kind of work

00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:44.590
that they would need to do
to provide equal justice

00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:46.480
to the kind of trial a man gets

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:48.870
when he has the money to pay for a lawyer.

00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:53.450
- And you go on to argue that remedies,

00:20:53.450 --> 00:20:57.310
one of the remedies
that one would look for

00:20:57.310 --> 00:21:02.310
is building the communities
that the poor come from

00:21:02.410 --> 00:21:06.933
so there could be
penalties such as shaming

00:21:08.302 --> 00:21:12.100
that would be enforced by the community,

00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:15.780
and thereby make the law more legitimate

00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:16.980
to those communities.

00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:18.424
- Yeah, well, I think,

00:21:18.424 --> 00:21:19.260
and I guess I think two things.

00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:24.240
I did talk about the
Japanese model, essentially,

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:29.010
which is to involve the community

00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:34.010
in the punishment of someone
who has committed a crime,

00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:37.460
and by the community they
mean the person's family,

00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:39.420
the person's teacher or teachers,

00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:41.130
the person's coach or coaches,

00:21:41.130 --> 00:21:42.470
the person's religious minister,

00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:47.470
anyone who plays an important
role in that person's life.

00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:52.100
Involve them in sort of
the collective punishment

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:55.810
and condemnation of the individual
for what he did as wrong,

00:21:55.810 --> 00:21:57.870
of the act he did as wrong,

00:21:57.870 --> 00:22:01.250
but at the same time,
commit them to reintegrating

00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:04.440
and helping this individual
move beyond that crime.

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:07.990
Whereas in our country, we
don't involve the community,

00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:11.540
and we don't do much at
all to try to reintegrate,

00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:14.230
and we just lock people
up and throw away the key.

00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:16.910
And then once they get out,

00:22:16.910 --> 00:22:18.590
'cause they do eventually get out,

00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:21.520
they have no resources and nobody

00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:24.940
to hold them up and support them.

00:22:24.940 --> 00:22:29.210
I talked about that as one possible way

00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:30.880
of responding.

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:35.310
I now believe, I guess, that
it's so much broader than that,

00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:39.550
that really we ask the criminal
justice system too much

00:22:39.550 --> 00:22:41.800
if we ask it to solve these problems.

00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:43.310
'Cause these problems don't come

00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:45.540
from the criminal justice system as such,

00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:50.540
they come from the circumstances
into which people are born,

00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:55.040
the vast disparities in
wealth and opportunity

00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:56.330
that we have in this country,

00:22:56.330 --> 00:23:00.810
and so if you grow up in a part of town

00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:03.170
where most of the people don't have jobs

00:23:03.170 --> 00:23:06.810
and where most of the people
don't have intact families

00:23:06.810 --> 00:23:11.810
and where there's tremendous
drug and gang activity,

00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:16.300
it's gonna be really
hard for you to make it.

00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:19.610
And asking the criminal justice system

00:23:19.610 --> 00:23:23.243
to solve that problem I
think is a real mismatch.

00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:28.530
- In your book on Engines of Liberty,

00:23:28.530 --> 00:23:32.830
you are looking at the
broader political context

00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:37.830
in which the Constitution
changes over time.

00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:43.860
And there are two case studies in there

00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:48.860
that are quite different and
remarkable in their own way,

00:23:49.013 --> 00:23:51.290
with both following the same journey.

00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:55.663
One is gay marriage and
the other is gun rights.

00:23:56.690 --> 00:23:59.940
Both involve significant individuals

00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:04.280
who saw the problem from
their personal experience

00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:07.950
and then went on this journey over time

00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:11.040
to touch all the political bases in a way

00:24:11.890 --> 00:24:14.070
to then change the Constitution.

00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:16.260
Talk about gay rights first.

00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:20.490
- So the basic idea of this book was:

00:24:20.490 --> 00:24:23.730
how do you explain the fact

00:24:23.730 --> 00:24:27.270
that marriage equality
went from unthinkable,

00:24:27.270 --> 00:24:30.460
which is what it was 25, 30 years ago,

00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:33.030
to inevitable, which
is what it was in 2015

00:24:33.030 --> 00:24:36.960
when the Supreme Court
heard argument in the case?

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:38.750
There was no question
it was gonna come out

00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:41.120
in favor of marriage
equality at that point.

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:42.780
How did that happen?

00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:45.163
And similarly with gun rights,

00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:49.130
Warren Burger, who was the
conservative Republican

00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:50.610
chief justice of the Supreme Court,

00:24:50.610 --> 00:24:54.740
said in 1991 that he thought the notion

00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:55.810
that the Second Amendment

00:24:55.810 --> 00:24:57.890
protects an individual right to bear arms

00:24:57.890 --> 00:24:59.940
was one of the greatest frauds

00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:02.070
perpetrated on the American people

00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:04.533
by a special interest
group in his lifetime.

00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:07.010
That was 1991.

00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:10.080
Conservative Republican chief
justice of the Supreme Court.

00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:11.310
The notion that the Second Amendment

00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:13.610
protects the individual right
to bear arms is a fraud.

00:25:13.610 --> 00:25:17.120
2008, the Supreme Court recognizes

00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:18.450
an individual right to bear arms.

00:25:18.450 --> 00:25:20.250
So how did those changes come about?

00:25:21.883 --> 00:25:24.300
And in many respects, one is a right

00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:28.100
as a conservative cause and
the other is a liberal cause,

00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:32.960
but they're both, they share quite a bit,

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:36.180
in that they were driven, I argue,

00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:39.300
not by clever arguments
in the Supreme Court.

00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:40.890
I mean, the people who
argued in the Supreme Court

00:25:40.890 --> 00:25:42.920
were very good in both cases,

00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:46.770
but it wasn't that they came
up with some new argument

00:25:46.770 --> 00:25:51.140
and the court recognized, oh,
we were wrong for a long time.

00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:55.570
They did tremendous work
outside of the Supreme Court,

00:25:55.570 --> 00:25:57.343
outside of the federal courts,

00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:02.980
essentially to shift public opinion,

00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:07.300
elite opinion, political opinion,

00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:10.610
so that an argument that
was unthinkable in time one

00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:12.020
became thinkable in time two.

00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:15.690
So on marriage equality, 1972,

00:26:15.690 --> 00:26:19.490
a gay couple sued for the right to marry.

00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:23.350
Their argument was considered so frivolous

00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:26.380
that when it went up to the Supreme Court,

00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:28.220
the Supreme Court rejected
it with a single sentence,

00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:30.700
saying, doesn't present
any serious question.

00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:32.720
We're not even gonna consider it.

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:33.660
1972.

00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:36.660
Their arguments were it
violates equal protection,

00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:38.313
denying same sex marriage.

00:26:38.313 --> 00:26:40.060
- That is, the people bringing the case.

00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:41.240
- The gay couple's arguments

00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:44.530
were that it violates equal
protection and due process

00:26:44.530 --> 00:26:47.270
to deny same-sex couples
the right to marry

00:26:47.270 --> 00:26:49.090
that opposite-sex couples have.

00:26:49.090 --> 00:26:50.820
Rejected out of hand, right?

00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:52.043
2015,

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:55.360
those arguments went.

00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:58.843
The same arguments, the legal
arguments didn't change,

00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:02.160
and the court, you say, well
maybe the court changed, right?

00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:06.610
Well, the court in 2015
was different from 1972,

00:27:06.610 --> 00:27:10.130
but if anything, the court
in 2015 was more conservative

00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:11.580
than the court in 1972,

00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:13.950
which was sort of the
tail-end of the Warren Court,

00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:16.580
the most liberal court
in American history.

00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:20.020
So the justices, the court
didn't become more liberal,

00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:21.300
the arguments didn't change.

00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:22.140
What changed?

00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:24.250
Well, the world changed.

00:27:24.250 --> 00:27:25.590
And how did the world change?

00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:27.030
It didn't just happen to change,

00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:31.280
it changed because of a group
of committed individuals

00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:33.960
who came together in organizations

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:36.310
like Lambda Legal Defense Fund or GLAAD,

00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:37.710
which is a gay and lesbian

00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:39.610
advocates and defenders in Boston,

00:27:39.610 --> 00:27:43.250
or the ACLU's Gay and
Lesbian Rights Project.

00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:45.780
And they worked together

00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:49.920
to advance the ball in
an incremental fashion

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:53.340
using forums other than the Supreme Court,

00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:55.590
because they knew they'd
lose in the Supreme Court,

00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:57.140
using forums other than the Supreme Court.

00:27:57.140 --> 00:28:00.430
Going to city councils, going
to progressive universities

00:28:00.430 --> 00:28:01.840
and trying to get them to recognize

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:05.250
domestic relationships,
domestic partnerships,

00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:08.110
whether they were
same-sex or opposite-sex.

00:28:08.110 --> 00:28:10.050
Getting anti-discrimination laws

00:28:10.050 --> 00:28:12.840
enacted in progressive cities
and then progressive states

00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:14.240
that included discrimination

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:15.840
on the basis of sexual orientation.

00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:20.170
Getting family law to be amended
in various incremental ways

00:28:20.170 --> 00:28:24.040
to recognize the validity of gay families.

00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:26.790
And only then did they go to courts,

00:28:26.790 --> 00:28:28.920
and they went to state courts,

00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:32.400
and they picked their states,
so they went to Vermont,

00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:34.493
the most liberal state in the country.

00:28:35.330 --> 00:28:37.830
Not saying anything about
California, but Vermont.

00:28:38.970 --> 00:28:41.540
And they made arguments based only

00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:45.940
on state constitutional law
that there was a right to marry,

00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:47.340
because if they made an argument

00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:48.960
based on federal constitutional law,

00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:51.580
that could be reviewed
by the Supreme Court

00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:54.220
and they knew they weren't ready
to go to the Supreme Court.

00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:57.650
And they won civil unions,
which is not entirely marriage,

00:28:57.650 --> 00:29:00.190
but it's a big step, in Vermont,

00:29:00.190 --> 00:29:02.090
and then they took that same tactic

00:29:02.090 --> 00:29:03.390
and went to Massachusetts,

00:29:04.752 --> 00:29:07.420
got a right to marriage under
Massachusetts state law there,

00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:09.530
took it to Connecticut, got it there,

00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:12.900
Iowa, California, got it there temporarily

00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:14.450
until Proposition Eight.

00:29:14.450 --> 00:29:17.610
So it was a state-by-state
incremental strategy,

00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:19.860
and only once there was a significant

00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:24.940
critical mass of states that
had recognized this right

00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:28.320
did they seek to make the
argument in the federal courts.

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:30.140
And the NRA did the same thing.

00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:31.930
Not starting in Vermont and Massachusetts,

00:29:31.930 --> 00:29:33.540
but Florida and Alabama

00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:36.180
on the individual right to bear arms.

00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:40.443
- Let's take the case of the
gay marriage equality decision.

00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:47.020
All this political work
at different levels

00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:52.020
in different forms, it
ultimately impacts ideas,

00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:54.180
the idea of what is appropriate.

00:29:54.180 --> 00:29:57.920
And you trace in there how the notion

00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:00.120
that we shouldn't have gay marriage

00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:04.360
because we don't like it,
we morally disapprove of it,

00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:06.290
that gets dropped by the wayside.

00:30:06.290 --> 00:30:09.420
But it's over time, as people come to see

00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:10.800
that that's not a good argument.

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:13.030
And then the argument about love.

00:30:13.030 --> 00:30:15.930
Two gay persons can love each other.

00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:20.770
So as all this political
activity is going on,

00:30:20.770 --> 00:30:24.050
ideas and thinking are changing,

00:30:24.050 --> 00:30:27.800
and those ideas are
coming from a groundswell

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:31.420
in different forms and
in different places.

00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:33.050
- Absolutely.

00:30:33.050 --> 00:30:38.050
It was very much affected
by gay people coming out.

00:30:39.660 --> 00:30:43.790
As long as gay people felt so oppressed

00:30:43.790 --> 00:30:47.350
that they hid their sexual identity,

00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:51.150
then many people didn't even know

00:30:51.150 --> 00:30:53.570
that they knew anyone who was gay.

00:30:53.570 --> 00:30:58.570
But once you protected
gay people sufficiently

00:30:58.770 --> 00:31:00.110
that they could come out

00:31:01.413 --> 00:31:02.246
and they started to come out

00:31:02.246 --> 00:31:04.810
and it became accepted to come out,

00:31:04.810 --> 00:31:08.360
then suddenly almost everybody
knew somebody in their family

00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:11.200
or in their neighborhood
who was gay and out.

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:13.393
And it's much harder to demonize.

00:31:15.330 --> 00:31:17.640
So the groups supported
those kinds of activities,

00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:21.660
coming out, the politicization
of sexual identity

00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:23.503
was an important part of the fight.

00:31:24.610 --> 00:31:26.650
Public education was an
important part of the fight.

00:31:26.650 --> 00:31:31.130
One of the groups that
I feature in the book

00:31:31.130 --> 00:31:33.530
is an organization that all they did

00:31:33.530 --> 00:31:38.530
was put pressure on Hollywood
and the television industry

00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:40.740
and the news media

00:31:40.740 --> 00:31:43.760
to portray gay people in a positive light,

00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:45.500
not to portray them as sort

00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:49.870
of some weird sexual
perverts or something,

00:31:49.870 --> 00:31:53.880
but to portray them as
normal human beings,

00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:55.100
which is what they are, after all.

00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:57.130
And that was important also

00:31:57.130 --> 00:32:00.040
to the evolution of an understanding,

00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:02.440
the normalization, essentially,

00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:04.433
of different sexual orientations.

00:32:06.582 --> 00:32:08.190
I also talk about the way in which

00:32:08.190 --> 00:32:11.720
the organizations learned
that in order to be effective

00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:16.027
at communicating and
persuading the persuadables,

00:32:18.330 --> 00:32:20.390
it was not so effective to talk about this

00:32:20.390 --> 00:32:22.560
as a civil rights issue.

00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:24.580
It was much more
effective to talk about it

00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:27.140
as a love and commitment issue.

00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:29.230
Because if you talked about
it as a civil rights issue,

00:32:29.230 --> 00:32:31.560
then sort of the implicit message

00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:33.650
is if you're against us,

00:32:33.650 --> 00:32:36.960
you're like those racists and
those anti-immigrant people,

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:39.930
and that's not a message that's
likely to pull people on,

00:32:39.930 --> 00:32:41.410
whereas if you're talking about it as,

00:32:41.410 --> 00:32:43.890
these are people who love each other,

00:32:43.890 --> 00:32:46.320
who are willing to make
a lifelong commitment,

00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:48.540
shouldn't they have the same right

00:32:50.931 --> 00:32:54.020
to have their relationships recognized

00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:57.400
that two people of the opposite sex have?

00:32:57.400 --> 00:32:58.860
Marriage is not about a right,

00:32:58.860 --> 00:33:00.210
it's about love and commitment.

00:33:00.210 --> 00:33:01.960
And that turned out to be

00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:05.840
a very effective rhetorical strategy

00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:08.730
to get people over.

00:33:08.730 --> 00:33:11.130
And eventually popular opinion

00:33:11.130 --> 00:33:14.560
was significantly in support
of marriage equality.

00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:18.400
- The other chapter in
the book that struck me

00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:22.703
is the NRA's effort

00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:28.670
and success in winning
Second Amendment rights

00:33:28.670 --> 00:33:31.230
for the individual,

00:33:31.230 --> 00:33:36.230
and their luck on the political system

00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:39.640
that emerges over time,

00:33:41.090 --> 00:33:43.310
which in the present environment,

00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:48.310
with the gun murders in
Florida just recently,

00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:53.780
really helps us understand

00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:58.470
how once a constitutional
right is recognized,

00:33:58.470 --> 00:34:01.910
how difficult it is to
change the political system.

00:34:01.910 --> 00:34:03.498
- Well, yeah.

00:34:03.498 --> 00:34:05.100
The NRA is a fascinating study,

00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:09.780
and for me, that section of
the book is in some sense

00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:11.653
the most interesting.

00:34:13.241 --> 00:34:14.780
They understand.

00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:17.600
I think that the power of
the NRA is they understand

00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:21.160
the democratic underpinnings
of constitutional rights.

00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:22.730
We tend to think of constitutional rights

00:34:22.730 --> 00:34:24.470
as being counter-democratic, right?

00:34:24.470 --> 00:34:25.840
They're in the Bill of Rights.

00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:29.340
Even if the majority wants to
tread on the First Amendment,

00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:32.370
the courts are there and lawyers are there

00:34:32.370 --> 00:34:34.690
to defend the unpopular.

00:34:34.690 --> 00:34:36.770
But in fact, in fact,

00:34:36.770 --> 00:34:40.240
if you can get the people
to support your right

00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:42.210
and to understand your conception

00:34:42.210 --> 00:34:44.910
as a right that's worth protecting,

00:34:44.910 --> 00:34:46.570
you're in much stronger hands.

00:34:46.570 --> 00:34:51.570
And what the NRA did was
use the power of democracy

00:34:51.830 --> 00:34:54.860
to advance what they view
as a constitutional right

00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:55.800
under the Second Amendment.

00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:57.460
So for 100 years the courts had said,

00:34:57.460 --> 00:35:00.600
there is no individual right to bear arms

00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:01.520
under the Constitution.

00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:04.030
But the NRA knew, we're not gonna be able

00:35:04.030 --> 00:35:06.940
to file a case in federal
court and change that,

00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:09.220
because the courts have said
the same thing for 100 years.

00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:11.490
They don't tend to reverse
themselves very easily.

00:35:11.490 --> 00:35:14.190
So instead they went to the states

00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:15.640
and they went state by state.

00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:17.470
They started off in Florida,

00:35:17.470 --> 00:35:20.680
ironically, given what's
going on in Florida right now

00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:23.220
in the wake of the high
school shooting there,

00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:24.150
but they started in Florida,

00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:26.040
which was very supportive of gun rights,

00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:27.830
and then they take the victory there

00:35:27.830 --> 00:35:31.380
to Alabama, to Mississippi,
all the way around the country,

00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:34.640
so that by the time 2008 came around

00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:37.480
and the Supreme Court was
actually taking up this case,

00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:39.420
should the federal constitution protect

00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:40.830
the individual right to bear arms,

00:35:40.830 --> 00:35:42.830
the NRA had already made sure

00:35:42.830 --> 00:35:45.860
that virtually every state in the country

00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:48.520
recognized an individual
right to bear arms

00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:50.770
by virtue of their own
state constitutions,

00:35:50.770 --> 00:35:53.400
which had been amended or
interpreted to that effect,

00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:56.900
or by virtue of state laws.

00:35:56.900 --> 00:35:58.570
And the NRA didn't even stop there.

00:35:58.570 --> 00:36:01.790
It also got Congress to enact laws

00:36:01.790 --> 00:36:04.450
that recognized an
individual right to bear arms

00:36:04.450 --> 00:36:08.630
and they got the executive
branch under George W. Bush

00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:10.500
and under Attorney General John Ashcroft

00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:12.700
to reverse its position

00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:15.750
of many decades that there was not

00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:17.030
an individual right to bear arms

00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:20.040
and to reverse its position
so that it was recognizing

00:36:21.086 --> 00:36:22.410
a Second Amendment individual
right to bear arms.

00:36:22.410 --> 00:36:24.610
So by the time it went
to the Supreme Court,

00:36:24.610 --> 00:36:29.610
the NRA had gotten the states,
Congress, and the executive

00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:31.050
on board with the idea

00:36:31.050 --> 00:36:32.613
there's an individual right to bear arms.

00:36:32.613 --> 00:36:33.800
Well, at that point it's not that hard

00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:36.830
for the Supreme Court to
come along for the ride.

00:36:36.830 --> 00:36:39.620
But even so, even after
the court recognized that,

00:36:39.620 --> 00:36:43.530
I argue that the most effective protection

00:36:43.530 --> 00:36:45.660
or protector of gun rights in this country

00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:47.050
is not the Second Amendment.

00:36:47.050 --> 00:36:48.520
It's not the court.

00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:49.920
It's the NRA.

00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:52.510
Because they're able to stop
laws from getting enacted

00:36:52.510 --> 00:36:54.330
that clearly would be constitutional,

00:36:54.330 --> 00:36:57.230
and they're able to get
gun rights laws enacted

00:36:57.230 --> 00:36:59.770
that are clearly not
required by the Constitution.

00:36:59.770 --> 00:37:00.890
And they do it through their members.

00:37:00.890 --> 00:37:02.820
They have five million members.

00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:05.430
They have 15 million others
who say they're members

00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:06.930
but don't pay their dues.

00:37:06.930 --> 00:37:08.627
What one guy from the NRA told me was,

00:37:08.627 --> 00:37:10.227
"We'd love to have their dues,

00:37:10.227 --> 00:37:12.397
"but what we really want
is their identification

00:37:12.397 --> 00:37:14.780
"with the NRA so that when we say act

00:37:15.617 --> 00:37:17.760
"on this bill or that bill, they will."

00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:20.930
And that's why, even in
the wake of horrific,

00:37:20.930 --> 00:37:23.800
horrific mass shootings,

00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:27.568
we see so little action
in the political branches.

00:37:27.568 --> 00:37:30.590
- In a way, the NRA is
a movement, basically.

00:37:30.590 --> 00:37:33.810
- Oh, absolutely.
- With clubs and so on,

00:37:33.810 --> 00:37:37.320
and the notion that you're
gonna take something away

00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:40.420
that I have mobilizes those people

00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:42.570
when they get the word from the NRA

00:37:42.570 --> 00:37:45.820
or when they read

00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:47.440
what's going on in the newspaper.

00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:49.740
There's another point that you make,

00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:52.630
which is very interesting, and that is

00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:56.430
that there is something
in the American ethos,

00:37:56.430 --> 00:38:00.080
the political construct, the
myth of the frontiersman,

00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:04.820
the individual, that in a way
the gun issue caps on that.

00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:09.280
So it's almost a default
benefit, so to speak,

00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:12.610
that they have when
they're making their case.

00:38:12.610 --> 00:38:15.200
- Yeah, I think they're
appealing to the notion

00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:19.400
of the rugged individual, the homesteader,

00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:21.603
the person who goes out on the frontier,

00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:25.790
takes a plot of land, grows some things,

00:38:25.790 --> 00:38:30.790
and those people didn't have
anybody to protect them.

00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:34.410
There wasn't a police chief in town,

00:38:34.410 --> 00:38:36.330
and so they protected themselves.

00:38:36.330 --> 00:38:40.600
And the gun is a stand-in for that notion

00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:44.470
of rugged individualism, self-protection,

00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:46.280
self-defense, really.

00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:49.720
And that does play into, I think,

00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:54.120
a particularly American
conception of the individual.

00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:58.380
And again, particularly,
still today on the frontier,

00:38:58.380 --> 00:39:02.730
in rural areas, much more
so than in urban areas,

00:39:02.730 --> 00:39:05.290
where the populations

00:39:05.290 --> 00:39:07.570
are overwhelmingly in
favor of gun control,

00:39:07.570 --> 00:39:08.720
and understandably.

00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:11.630
They don't feel that they
have to defend themselves,

00:39:11.630 --> 00:39:12.830
because the police are there.

00:39:12.830 --> 00:39:15.940
They're patrolling and hearing
the sirens all the time.

00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:17.400
If you're out in the middle of nowhere

00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:21.610
in Utah or Wyoming, the police
aren't gonna protect you.

00:39:21.610 --> 00:39:24.860
So you feel like, I've
gotta protect myself,

00:39:24.860 --> 00:39:28.390
and there gun rights
are very, very popular.

00:39:28.390 --> 00:39:32.982
- So the question is,
can a social movement,

00:39:32.982 --> 00:39:34.600
and we're seeing a new
kind of social movement

00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:36.880
with high school students,

00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:38.280
not only in the high school

00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:41.240
where this horrific incident occurred,

00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:44.310
but linking to other
high schools in the state

00:39:44.310 --> 00:39:46.023
and maybe nationally,

00:39:48.978 --> 00:39:50.290
can we hope,

00:39:50.290 --> 00:39:53.820
or what is your perspective

00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:56.630
on how that might change things?

00:39:56.630 --> 00:40:00.130
Because this lock that the NRA has,

00:40:00.130 --> 00:40:01.880
it's literally, they can target

00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:03.960
a politician who votes against them.

00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:05.863
- Yeah, so I think, look.

00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:10.210
If you had asked me in 1991,

00:40:10.210 --> 00:40:11.700
will the Supreme Court recognize

00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:13.600
an individual right to bear arms,

00:40:13.600 --> 00:40:15.250
I would have said, no way.

00:40:15.250 --> 00:40:17.610
Because for 100 years they hadn't,

00:40:17.610 --> 00:40:21.050
and the conservative Supreme Court justice

00:40:21.050 --> 00:40:22.680
said the idea was a fraud.

00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:24.240
That's not just, we won't recognize it,

00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:25.323
but it's a fraud.

00:40:26.731 --> 00:40:28.670
And yet 18 years later,

00:40:28.670 --> 00:40:30.639
the Supreme Court recognized it.

00:40:30.639 --> 00:40:35.639
And if you had asked me in 1985 or '90,

00:40:36.350 --> 00:40:38.610
will the Supreme Court
recognize marriage equality,

00:40:38.610 --> 00:40:40.923
I would have said, no, there's no way.

00:40:42.670 --> 00:40:44.000
It's not thinkable.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.290
And yet in both instances

00:40:46.290 --> 00:40:48.250
what was unthinkable became thinkable

00:40:48.250 --> 00:40:50.420
by virtue of exactly

00:40:50.420 --> 00:40:52.270
what those high school
students are doing now,

00:40:52.270 --> 00:40:55.840
which is political action
around a conception

00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:59.870
of a right, of a sense of justice.

00:40:59.870 --> 00:41:03.250
The question will be,
can that be continued?

00:41:03.250 --> 00:41:05.560
Can it be multiplied?

00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:07.240
Will it grow?

00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:09.100
Right now it's got a lot of support,

00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:11.610
and I think because it's high school kids

00:41:11.610 --> 00:41:14.800
who can speak for themselves
and who are very sympathetic,

00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:16.210
it could well grow.

00:41:16.210 --> 00:41:17.533
And I also think because,

00:41:18.410 --> 00:41:21.640
I would say Americans generally

00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:26.240
are much more primed to
engage politically now

00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:28.240
than they were before Trump's election

00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:31.910
because of what Trump's
election signifies.

00:41:31.910 --> 00:41:34.830
So the women's march on the
first day after the inauguration

00:41:34.830 --> 00:41:36.710
was unheard of.

00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:40.320
National, came up out of the blue.

00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:44.660
National demonstrations
across this country,

00:41:44.660 --> 00:41:47.850
in all kinds of cities and states,

00:41:47.850 --> 00:41:49.260
even internationally.

00:41:49.260 --> 00:41:53.970
And I think there's some
blend-over to this issue.

00:41:53.970 --> 00:41:57.240
But gun control folks have a lot of work

00:41:57.240 --> 00:42:00.690
to catch up to the gun rights advocates.

00:42:00.690 --> 00:42:03.470
While the NRA was doing
this work all along

00:42:03.470 --> 00:42:06.100
and doing it in the
states at the local level,

00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:09.030
the gun control folks were
focused in Washington,

00:42:09.030 --> 00:42:10.890
only focused on Congress,

00:42:10.890 --> 00:42:14.563
not fighting the local
battles, and so they lost.

00:42:15.770 --> 00:42:19.110
Mayor Bloomberg's Everytown for Gun Safety

00:42:19.110 --> 00:42:24.110
is an attempt to mimic
what the NRA has done

00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:27.560
and to build a local movement,

00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:30.610
nationally coordinated local movements,

00:42:30.610 --> 00:42:31.990
in favor of gun control.

00:42:31.990 --> 00:42:36.547
And I think this could be
the beginning of that effort.

00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:39.590
How successful it will be will depend

00:42:39.590 --> 00:42:42.120
on to what extent people continue to fight

00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:44.713
and to what extent the NRA fights back.

00:42:45.830 --> 00:42:47.400
- One thing I would suggest

00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:50.890
is that your book Engines of Liberty

00:42:50.890 --> 00:42:53.787
be adopted by all the high
schools in the country.

00:42:53.787 --> 00:42:55.430
- Oh, there you go.

00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:57.650
A prescription for action, exactly.

00:42:57.650 --> 00:43:01.230
- So in this last segment of the program,

00:43:01.230 --> 00:43:05.600
you've described to us the job
you thought you were taking.

00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:08.903
Hillary was gonna get
elected, so on and so forth.

00:43:09.984 --> 00:43:14.367
We're now in a world
that's strangely different,

00:43:16.199 --> 00:43:19.027
and it's kind of a transition

00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:22.530
to a plutocracy in a way,

00:43:22.530 --> 00:43:24.310
it appears generally.

00:43:24.310 --> 00:43:29.310
And then there are all kinds
of social forces at work.

00:43:30.290 --> 00:43:33.060
I listed some of them here.

00:43:33.060 --> 00:43:35.500
Nationalism, which then says,

00:43:35.500 --> 00:43:37.850
well, why should we pay
attention to international law?

00:43:37.850 --> 00:43:40.780
Which is a linchpin of your book

00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:45.780
on the rights of accused terrorists.

00:43:46.470 --> 00:43:48.420
Libertarianism.

00:43:48.420 --> 00:43:50.730
Dismantle the welfare state

00:43:50.730 --> 00:43:53.580
and privatize prisons, basically.

00:43:53.580 --> 00:43:56.300
So putting more and more people in prison

00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:58.200
is a profitable undertaking.

00:43:58.200 --> 00:44:00.190
Money and politics.

00:44:00.190 --> 00:44:04.340
Thereby controlling the legislatures

00:44:04.340 --> 00:44:07.310
with programs like ALEC, where legislation

00:44:07.310 --> 00:44:08.520
is written in advance.

00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:10.963
And then the whole issue of technology.

00:44:12.970 --> 00:44:15.260
What is freedom of speech

00:44:15.260 --> 00:44:18.960
in the context of Facebook's platform

00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:22.830
and the intervention by external actors

00:44:22.830 --> 00:44:26.223
to corrupt what we
think of as free speech?

00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:32.050
How are you thinking about the big picture

00:44:32.050 --> 00:44:36.140
now that your job description was wrong

00:44:36.140 --> 00:44:37.970
with regard to what aspect,

00:44:37.970 --> 00:44:40.280
which was the environment
you would be operating in?

00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:41.280
- Right.

00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:44.170
Well, that's a big question,
and a great question,

00:44:44.170 --> 00:44:46.990
and one we ask ourselves
every day at the ACLU

00:44:48.010 --> 00:44:49.410
and many other organizations as well.

00:44:49.410 --> 00:44:50.633
I guess my sense is,

00:44:54.173 --> 00:44:55.070
there are many troubling indicators,

00:44:56.560 --> 00:44:57.940
and you've listed a bunch of them.

00:44:57.940 --> 00:45:00.130
I think the vast disparity

00:45:00.130 --> 00:45:03.990
between the rich and the poor today,

00:45:03.990 --> 00:45:07.740
it's the second Gilded Age, is
a driver of so many of them.

00:45:07.740 --> 00:45:10.960
But you see it in the
hyper partisan character,

00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:12.840
you see it in the divided media,

00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:16.900
you see it in the turn to populism.

00:45:16.900 --> 00:45:18.020
You see it in the fact

00:45:18.020 --> 00:45:20.810
that there is a sizeable
percentage of the American people

00:45:20.810 --> 00:45:23.760
that are not embarrassed by Donald Trump,

00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:25.863
but actually like Donald Trump.

00:45:27.748 --> 00:45:29.298
These are troubling indicators,

00:45:30.220 --> 00:45:32.900
but I guess I think what we need to do

00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:34.560
is really twofold.

00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:36.580
The first thing we need to do is we need

00:45:36.580 --> 00:45:40.593
to defend the values that
this country was based on.

00:45:42.030 --> 00:45:45.913
And those values are, among them,

00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:49.170
basic human rights for all people,

00:45:49.170 --> 00:45:52.273
which is a concept that
says everybody's equal.

00:45:53.310 --> 00:45:55.460
There is not one set of
rights for rich people,

00:45:55.460 --> 00:45:56.730
one set of rights for poor people.

00:45:56.730 --> 00:45:58.650
That was my critique of the
criminal justice system,

00:45:58.650 --> 00:46:00.360
is we're not living up to our ideals.

00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:03.700
But at the ACLU, we fight to ensure

00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:07.570
that our system does live up to its ideals

00:46:07.570 --> 00:46:09.530
as best as we can.

00:46:09.530 --> 00:46:12.950
And when a president
like Trump is in office,

00:46:12.950 --> 00:46:15.900
many basic rights and
liberties are under attack.

00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:18.970
Voting rights, reproductive freedom,

00:46:18.970 --> 00:46:23.167
immigrants' rights, due
process, LGBT rights.

00:46:23.167 --> 00:46:25.973
And he's chosen to attack all of these.

00:46:26.830 --> 00:46:29.080
The first thing we need
to do is defend them,

00:46:30.180 --> 00:46:31.013
and we are.

00:46:31.013 --> 00:46:33.650
We told President Trump,
if you go down this road,

00:46:33.650 --> 00:46:35.860
we'll see you in court,
that's our tagline,

00:46:35.860 --> 00:46:38.530
and we have sued him in case after case,

00:46:38.530 --> 00:46:39.980
and for the most part thus far

00:46:39.980 --> 00:46:41.300
the courts have ruled with us.

00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:43.820
They've enjoined the travel ban

00:46:43.820 --> 00:46:45.330
directed at muslim countries.

00:46:45.330 --> 00:46:49.070
They've enjoined the
transgender military ban

00:46:49.070 --> 00:46:51.250
which President Trump
put in place by Twitter

00:46:51.250 --> 00:46:54.810
without even consulting the
leaders of the military.

00:46:54.810 --> 00:46:58.820
They've enjoined the ending of,

00:46:58.820 --> 00:47:02.330
the termination of DACA, the
program for the young people

00:47:02.330 --> 00:47:06.660
who came here, their parents
brought them here illegally

00:47:06.660 --> 00:47:08.710
and are undocumented.

00:47:08.710 --> 00:47:13.710
They have enjoined the Trump
administration's efforts

00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:17.140
to block access to abortion

00:47:17.140 --> 00:47:19.340
of young undocumented women

00:47:19.340 --> 00:47:21.123
that they have in federal custody.

00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:25.170
So in some sense we're
winning in the courts.

00:47:25.170 --> 00:47:27.600
We're defending those
basic rights and values,

00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:29.960
and that's part one,
but part two, I think,

00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:31.920
is you gotta move beyond defense

00:47:33.030 --> 00:47:36.500
and you have to appeal
to a positive vision.

00:47:36.500 --> 00:47:38.220
And the positive vision, I think,

00:47:38.220 --> 00:47:40.310
is that we are not a country

00:47:41.428 --> 00:47:44.330
that has to be driven by partisan divide,

00:47:44.330 --> 00:47:49.330
that has to be driven by hatred

00:47:49.620 --> 00:47:53.770
and treating the other as
somehow less than human

00:47:53.770 --> 00:47:55.253
or illegitimate.

00:47:56.587 --> 00:47:58.590
We are a country at our best

00:47:58.590 --> 00:48:01.730
that recognizes a set
of universal principles,

00:48:01.730 --> 00:48:04.060
that recognizes that we are a community,

00:48:04.060 --> 00:48:06.580
that recognizes that
we have an obligation,

00:48:06.580 --> 00:48:08.650
not just to better ourselves,

00:48:08.650 --> 00:48:11.680
but to protect others.

00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:14.390
And that's what the
Bill of Rights reflects.

00:48:14.390 --> 00:48:16.070
It reflects that conception.

00:48:16.070 --> 00:48:19.760
And so we're trying to put
forth a positive vision

00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:22.300
that people can come together and support,

00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:25.290
people from the right as well as the left,

00:48:25.290 --> 00:48:28.530
to move beyond this kind
of bitter partisan divide.

00:48:28.530 --> 00:48:30.620
You know, whether we'll succeed

00:48:30.620 --> 00:48:34.350
I think depends entirely
on the American people

00:48:34.350 --> 00:48:38.280
and to what extent they continue to engage

00:48:40.550 --> 00:48:43.400
in the defense of these
values at this time.

00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:48.400
And so far I've been
encouraged by the real energy.

00:48:48.430 --> 00:48:50.910
I mean, I haven't seen in my lifetime

00:48:50.910 --> 00:48:54.430
this kind of civic engagement ever before.

00:48:54.430 --> 00:48:57.220
I think the last time you saw
this kind of civic engagement

00:48:57.220 --> 00:48:59.250
in America was the Vietnam War,

00:48:59.250 --> 00:49:04.170
and that was in a time
when every young man

00:49:04.170 --> 00:49:05.833
had a self-interest.

00:49:06.930 --> 00:49:09.820
Now, it's not necessarily self-interest.

00:49:09.820 --> 00:49:12.570
When people go out to
advocate for the DREAMers,

00:49:12.570 --> 00:49:13.810
or when they go to the airports

00:49:13.810 --> 00:49:15.620
to demonstrate against
the Trump travel ban,

00:49:15.620 --> 00:49:16.453
they're not defending their own rights,

00:49:16.453 --> 00:49:18.770
they're defending the rights of the other.

00:49:18.770 --> 00:49:21.150
They're saying, these
rights are important enough

00:49:21.150 --> 00:49:24.170
that we think they should
be extended to other people,

00:49:24.170 --> 00:49:27.340
and we're willing to defend
the rights of other people.

00:49:27.340 --> 00:49:31.090
I think that move is critically important

00:49:31.090 --> 00:49:34.140
to offset the kind of self-interest,

00:49:34.140 --> 00:49:38.900
pure private self-interest
which I think Trump embodies.

00:49:38.900 --> 00:49:42.750
His narcissism embodies the extreme limit

00:49:42.750 --> 00:49:46.630
of this kind of private interest pursuit

00:49:46.630 --> 00:49:51.630
with no conception of public consequences.

00:49:52.150 --> 00:49:55.760
- What about the extent
to which the judiciary

00:49:55.760 --> 00:49:59.560
is being packed by people selected

00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:01.340
by the Federalist Society?

00:50:01.340 --> 00:50:06.340
Do you think that the power
of the ideas that will emerge

00:50:06.670 --> 00:50:09.870
in the context of this
political opposition

00:50:09.870 --> 00:50:11.160
you've just described,

00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:13.800
do you think that when
they're in their seats

00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:15.950
they will be impacted by it,

00:50:15.950 --> 00:50:20.950
so the law will not go as far to one side

00:50:21.170 --> 00:50:23.820
as one might expect if we're packing

00:50:23.820 --> 00:50:27.900
so many conservative
justices on the court?

00:50:27.900 --> 00:50:29.720
- The judicial appointments are a concern

00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:32.890
because they last beyond
the administration.

00:50:32.890 --> 00:50:34.360
If Trump does all kinds of things

00:50:34.360 --> 00:50:35.980
by unilateral executive action,

00:50:35.980 --> 00:50:37.700
which is mostly what he's done,

00:50:37.700 --> 00:50:40.410
those can be reversed
by the next president

00:50:40.410 --> 00:50:42.010
if the political will is there.

00:50:42.010 --> 00:50:43.440
But if he puts people on the courts,

00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:44.810
they're there for the rest of their lives,

00:50:44.810 --> 00:50:46.333
and that can be generations.

00:50:47.620 --> 00:50:49.143
That's definitely a concern.

00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:53.230
A strong showing in the midterms,

00:50:53.230 --> 00:50:56.330
supporting those who
believe in civil rights,

00:50:56.330 --> 00:50:58.240
civil liberties, separation of powers,

00:50:58.240 --> 00:50:59.283
the rule of law,

00:51:00.420 --> 00:51:03.840
could lead to a Senate
that will put a check

00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:07.210
on his putting in place
ideologues on the courts.

00:51:07.210 --> 00:51:09.120
And that would be an important first step.

00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:11.660
But I guess I would say,

00:51:11.660 --> 00:51:14.080
sort of consistent with my
book Engines of Liberty,

00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:16.140
don't focus solely on the courts.

00:51:16.140 --> 00:51:18.390
We need to focus on the people

00:51:18.390 --> 00:51:20.920
and on the power of movements,

00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:23.320
and if those movements are powerful,

00:51:23.320 --> 00:51:25.560
they will constrain the courts.

00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:28.070
Historians have looked at
the Supreme Court's decisions

00:51:28.070 --> 00:51:32.640
over time and correlated them

00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:34.850
to public opinion on various issues,

00:51:34.850 --> 00:51:38.670
and what they find is that
the court rarely departs

00:51:38.670 --> 00:51:41.590
very substantially from public opinion,

00:51:41.590 --> 00:51:45.020
and when it does, those
decisions tend not to last.

00:51:45.020 --> 00:51:49.620
And so yeah, I'm very concerned
about court appointments,

00:51:49.620 --> 00:51:52.710
but I think that just
underscores the importance

00:51:52.710 --> 00:51:55.500
of people who care about civil
liberties and civil rights

00:51:55.500 --> 00:51:57.780
engaging, engaging in the midterms,

00:51:57.780 --> 00:52:00.590
but also engaging for the longterm.

00:52:00.590 --> 00:52:04.730
- Let's talk a minute about
the free speech issues

00:52:04.730 --> 00:52:09.730
that are raised in the
election, the use of technology,

00:52:10.980 --> 00:52:15.980
of internet platforms,
to spread fake news.

00:52:18.486 --> 00:52:20.410
It's not a question so much

00:52:20.410 --> 00:52:24.940
of defending the right of
a Nazi to speak their piece

00:52:27.270 --> 00:52:32.270
as it is a question about the
discourse is being corrupted

00:52:33.690 --> 00:52:35.860
by untruths.

00:52:35.860 --> 00:52:38.890
Not that I don't believe
in somebody else's truth,

00:52:38.890 --> 00:52:40.980
but the whole purpose is to disrupt.

00:52:40.980 --> 00:52:41.813
- Yeah.

00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:46.200
This is a very vexing problem, obviously,

00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:47.530
and we're only at the very beginning

00:52:47.530 --> 00:52:49.993
of trying to figure out how to solve it.

00:52:51.369 --> 00:52:54.410
I think were the will there

00:52:57.050 --> 00:52:59.530
to disable bots,

00:52:59.530 --> 00:53:02.023
these sort of automatic spreaders,

00:53:03.139 --> 00:53:04.243
fake people,

00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:10.570
that would be one way of checking,

00:53:10.570 --> 00:53:13.880
of checking the reach of
these kinds of things,

00:53:13.880 --> 00:53:18.350
'cause they rely very heavily
on this automated spread.

00:53:18.350 --> 00:53:19.740
Because if you're sending something out

00:53:19.740 --> 00:53:21.580
that's blatantly false,

00:53:21.580 --> 00:53:24.355
the likelihood that it's gonna
be spread by normal people

00:53:24.355 --> 00:53:26.030
is not very high,

00:53:26.030 --> 00:53:29.210
but if you can spread
it through automation,

00:53:29.210 --> 00:53:30.790
then the more people hear it,

00:53:30.790 --> 00:53:31.800
the more they're gonna believe it

00:53:31.800 --> 00:53:34.010
and then it will affect the debate.

00:53:34.010 --> 00:53:35.693
So that seems to be one way.

00:53:36.630 --> 00:53:38.070
Another thing that people talk about

00:53:38.070 --> 00:53:39.530
is the extent to which,

00:53:39.530 --> 00:53:41.280
how do you control fake news?

00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:43.830
Should Facebook be in the business

00:53:43.830 --> 00:53:48.160
of determining whether
your post is true or not,

00:53:48.160 --> 00:53:50.110
in the same way that the New York Times

00:53:51.770 --> 00:53:54.510
does fact-checking on its articles?

00:53:54.510 --> 00:53:58.213
I'm not sure that that's
possible for Facebook to do.

00:54:01.780 --> 00:54:04.340
If we're worried under the
First Amendment generally

00:54:04.340 --> 00:54:09.340
about one concentrated
authority, the government,

00:54:09.940 --> 00:54:14.480
having the power to determine
what's true and what's false,

00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:16.220
and we are, and that's why we don't

00:54:16.220 --> 00:54:18.040
let the government do that,

00:54:18.040 --> 00:54:21.493
the government can't say, you
can't engage in falsehoods,

00:54:23.430 --> 00:54:25.190
because we don't trust
the government to define

00:54:25.190 --> 00:54:26.640
what's true and what's false,

00:54:28.450 --> 00:54:30.900
then shouldn't we also be
worried about Facebook,

00:54:31.790 --> 00:54:34.010
giving Facebook that power?

00:54:34.010 --> 00:54:37.390
But at the same time it seems inadequate

00:54:37.390 --> 00:54:40.883
to just say, let a thousand flowers bloom.

00:54:43.481 --> 00:54:45.803
We'll rely on the marketplace of ideas.

00:54:46.950 --> 00:54:50.390
Because the marketplace
has been so corrupted

00:54:50.390 --> 00:54:55.180
by money, by automation, and the like.

00:54:55.180 --> 00:54:58.238
I think it's a real challenge

00:54:58.238 --> 00:55:02.490
for democracy and for
civil society going forward

00:55:02.490 --> 00:55:07.490
to get a handle on how we
think about social media

00:55:08.010 --> 00:55:11.940
as distinct from organized media.

00:55:11.940 --> 00:55:13.660
- Well, on that note, David,

00:55:13.660 --> 00:55:16.330
I want to thank you for helping us

00:55:16.330 --> 00:55:20.080
think through some of
these thorny problems,

00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:24.280
some of which we're still working on,

00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:27.640
but others that have been
worked on in the past

00:55:27.640 --> 00:55:30.370
you've given us an account
of how that was done.

00:55:30.370 --> 00:55:34.480
I feel a responsibility to
show at least one of your books

00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:35.380
to your audience.

00:55:35.380 --> 00:55:39.840
This is the Engine of Liberty book.

00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:43.560
I want to thank you very much
for being on our program.

00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:44.393
- Thanks for having me.

00:55:44.393 --> 00:55:45.270
It's been a delight.

00:55:45.270 --> 00:55:46.340
- Thank you.

00:55:46.340 --> 00:55:48.830
And thank you very much for joining us

00:55:48.830 --> 00:55:51.403
for this conversation with history.
