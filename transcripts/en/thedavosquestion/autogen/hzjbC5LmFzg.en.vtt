the question today is what one thing do

individuals must do to make the world a

individuals must do to make the world a
better place in 2008 well I think they

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639
better place in 2008 well I think they

should concentrate on the neglected

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800

on consciousness through things that
 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.340
on consciousness through things that
happen that affect things you know so

therefore I think it serve a careful

therefore I think it serve a careful

therefore I think it serve a careful
survey to pick out not precisely the

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899
survey to pick out not precisely the
 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.189
survey to pick out not precisely the
hottest and most urgent places which

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199
hottest and most urgent places which
 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.200
hottest and most urgent places which
must be done which is crucial and

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210
must be done which is crucial and
 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.360
must be done which is crucial and
obvious but that's the problem

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370
obvious but that's the problem
 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.030
obvious but that's the problem
it's to us and therefore it's the a

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040
it's to us and therefore it's the a
 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.399
it's to us and therefore it's the a
great exercise would be to say what are

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409
great exercise would be to say what are
 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.090
great exercise would be to say what are
the most urgent and neglected we should

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100
the most urgent and neglected we should
 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.590
the most urgent and neglected we should
come don't you think

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600
come don't you think
 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.249

and wide exposures is one step actually

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:20.259
and wide exposures is one step actually
 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:22.140
and wide exposures is one step actually
to address the problem so we need to get

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.150
to address the problem so we need to get
 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.359
to address the problem so we need to get
the neglected issues out into the maze

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369
the neglected issues out into the maze
 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:26.789
the neglected issues out into the maze
here well I think the matter the mass

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.750
 
one little thought for is enough
