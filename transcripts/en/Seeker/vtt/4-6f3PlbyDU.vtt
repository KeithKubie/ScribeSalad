00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.220
Russia is considering a temporary disconnect
from the world wide web to test cybersecurity

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.530
and possibly move towards an autonomous Russian
internet infrastructure.

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.500
But can they even do that, just up and leave
the internet?

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.470
Will they be able to watch cat videos?

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:19.380
Is there some owner of the internet who can
stop them?

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.990
As you may have noticed, the internet is huge.

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.939
It’s a global network that connects computers
around the entire world; I can be in Barcelona

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:32.119
and theoretically access the exact same websites
that I do in Los Angeles.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.710
You know, so long as local laws and Digital
Rights Management permit.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.760
Something this huge can’t be owned by any
one entity.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.960
Instead, it’s a hierarchy of structures
with lots of smaller owners along the way.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.770
It starts with you.

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.870
When your computer or smart device is connected
to the internet you become a teeny tiny part

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:52.870
of it.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:58.010
You rely on an Internet Service Provider,
or ISP, to physically connect you to everyone

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.010
else.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.789
Actually, you rely on multiple ISPs, which
form tiers of networks.

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.990
The tiers are determined by network size,
which also dictates whether they transfer

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.070
data by paying for the transit across larger
networks or share it with other similarly

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.289
sized networks for mutually agreed upon benefits.

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:18.149
At the lowest level is a Tier 3 ISP.

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:22.569
These are companies like Comcast or Verizon
Communications, and they strictly operate

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:27.109
by paying to send their data using bigger,
more well-connected networks.

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:31.610
They’re also known as Last Mile Providers
because, well, they’re responsible for the

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.869
last miles of cable that connects your access
point to the overall network.

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:40.999
Above that is a Tier 2 ISP, which can either
pay to send data across larger networks like

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:46.630
Tier 3 ISPs or they share data with networks
of a similar size for mutual benefits, what’s

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.509
known as “peering” without charge.

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:54.770
Nowadays they can be also provide last mile
service like Tier 3 ISPs, and they’re companies

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.909
like British telekom and Vodafone.

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.559
And finally, above that are the Tier 1 ISPs
the huge networks that own the cables connecting

00:02:02.559 --> 00:02:04.309
entire continents.

00:02:04.309 --> 00:02:07.959
These companies are also known as backbone
internet providers.

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:12.950
They connect to other Tier 1 ISPs to exchange
traffic through peering agreements, and just

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.620
like that you have a global network of computers.

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.750
Considering how huge and complex it is, it’s
pretty incredible the thing works at all.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.870
That’s all thanks to several organizations,
many of which are nonprofit, that standardize

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.340
how the internet works globally.

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.060
They each have their own responsibilities,
like setting standards, maintaining architecture

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.510
and stability, and assigning each domain name
with a unique IP address.

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.170
These organizations don’t own the internet,
but have a profound effect on how the whole

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:43.170
thing works.

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.980
Likewise, the internet can be regulated in
specific places based on the local government’s

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.590
rules, like China’s censorship laws or the
U.S.’s rules on net neutrality.

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.700
So if Russia’s government wanted to disconnect
from the rest of the world wide web, ultimately

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:58.700
that’s up to them.

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.069
If you wanted to be a bigger part of the internet
you could make a website.

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:06.390
You’d need a specialized computer called
a server, which is like a beefy computer with

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.130
a lot of storage space that’s designed to
communicate with other computers.

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.900
There are actually lots of server types, like
email and Domain Name System servers, but

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.810
your website would be stored on a web server
at a data center somewhere.

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.251
Now imagine your website is awesome because
it’s got the best pictures of cats ever

00:03:23.251 --> 00:03:24.251
on it.

00:03:24.251 --> 00:03:28.260
It’s so popular someone on the other side
of the world wants to access it.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.129
Then the entire pipeline looks like this:
you pay a web host, which owns web servers,

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:36.420
to use one or part of their servers to store
your data..

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:37.760
Or in this case “cata.”

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:43.200
Let’s say your particular web server is
connected to a Tier 2 ISP, so the data is

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:49.129
sent to a Tier 1 ISP, which shares that data
with another Tier 1 ISP, which distributes

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:54.389
it to lower tier ISPs until eventually it
winds up at your number 1 fan’s computer

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:56.150
on the other side of the globe.

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:01.129
I made that sound pretty linear but actually
the data is broken up into smaller chunks

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:06.280
called packets, which are routed from a server
using many paths through the networks until

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.359
they’re reassembled at a person’s computer.

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:12.950
Unless that person was, say, in Russia during
the temporary disconnect.

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.500
That user could still access cat memes on
web servers that are in Russia somewhere and

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:23.060
connected to Russia’s ISPs, but if those
ISPs don’t exchange data with anyone outside

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:29.560
the country then effectively there’s a virtual
wall between them and the outside world.Likewise

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.229
you would miss out on any Russian cat videos
you wanted to see outside the country.

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:37.509
Everywhere along the way, someone owns a part
of the internet.

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:39.840
It’s your website but a web host’s server.

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.100
It’s their server, but an ISP’s network.

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.949
It’s their network, but they need to connect
to an even bigger network.

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:50.650
And there are other equally big networks they
need to connect to to make the whole thing

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:51.650
global.

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:56.229
So everyone connected to it owns the internet,
and nobody does.

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:57.590
Pretty cool.

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:00.080
Do you think you can go without global internet?

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.550

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.210
make internet faster with twisted light.

and I’ll see you next time on Seeker.
