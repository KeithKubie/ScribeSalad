This is Jocko podcast number one 77 with Echo Charles and me,

2
00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.520
Jocko Willink.
Good Evening Echo.
Good evening.

3
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.610
A few days later when I walked downstairs to go workout,

4
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:19.290
I saw uncle Jake's bag packed up sitting by the door.

5
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.360
That's when it hit me.

6
00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.110
The summer was almost over and uncle Jake was leaving again.

7
00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.800
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

8
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.520
<v 0>I went out to the garage to work out and uncle Jake was already there,</v>

9
00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.260
last workout with me for the summer.
He said,
with a smile,

10
00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.810
I can't believe it's over already.
Summer always goes by so fast.
I told him,

11
00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:44.770
yes it does.
Uncle Jake said quietly,

12
00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.530
and life does the same thing.

13
00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.940
I wasn't sure what Uncle Jake meant by that,

14
00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.920
so I asked what you'll see,
mark.
He said,

15
00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.030
life goes by quickly,
like a summer day.

16
00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.760
It never seems that way when you're young,

17
00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:07.960
but when you get a little older you'll see life goes by fast,

18
00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.100
so don't waste any time you don't get a second chance.

19
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.260
Uncle Jake stood for a minute looking at me with a serious face and he gave me a

20
00:01:19.261 --> 00:01:21.810
little smile and said,
speaking of wasting time,

21
00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.720
let's stop wasting time and get this workout done.

22
00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.240
He jumped up on the pullup bar,
grabbed hold and started knocking them out

23
00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:34.623
and that

24
00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.880
is a little excerpt from the last chapter.

25
00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.230
You need new book,

26
00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.820
the latest edition in the series where the warrior could kid book three.

27
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.850
The subtitle of book is where there is a will,

28
00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:52.563
and

29
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.080
I wrote that part of the book because I wanted to let kids know as early as

30
00:01:58.081 --> 00:02:00.270
possible that that is the truth.

31
00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.960
That life goes by like a summer day

32
00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:08.480
and that life is short.

33
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
And if you remember when you were a kid and summer you get out of school for the

34
00:02:16.701 --> 00:02:19.460
summer and it seems like you have all the time in the world,

35
00:02:19.461 --> 00:02:22.310
it seems like summer vacation,
it's going to last for ever

36
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.200
and then all of a sudden it's blurred and you look up and as soon as summer

37
00:02:29.421 --> 00:02:32.990
vacation has started,
all of a sudden it's over.

38
00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.780
That's what I remember about summers.
And that's the truth.

39
00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.610
And that's what life is like
about.

40
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:44.130
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

41
00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:49.020
<v 0>A year and a half ago,
September 29th,</v>

42
00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.360
2017 and September 29th St Michael's Day,

43
00:02:51.361 --> 00:02:56.361
that's the day that Mikey monster was killed in Ramadi in 2006 so on September

44
00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.330
29th,
2017 I woke up and I was thinking about that.

45
00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.370
I was thinking about Mikey and

46
00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.020
later that day,

47
00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.220
I think I was actually heading up to Rosecrance national cemetery where Mike,

48
00:03:16.221 --> 00:03:20.400
he is buried and all was going to go and visit Mikey's grave.

49
00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.950
And while I was on my way up there,

50
00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:28.490
I got a call and I found out that one of my mentors,

51
00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.560
one of the guys that raised me in the seal teams,

52
00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:40.140
a guy named master chief Mike Faculty,
he had died.

53
00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:42.190
Yeah.

54
00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:47.190
And he had been in a pretty hardcore battle with lung cancer even though he was

55
00:03:47.431 --> 00:03:49.140
a nonsmoker,
even though he's a traff,

56
00:03:49.141 --> 00:03:50.760
we'd even though he worked out all the time,

57
00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:57.200
he got this form of lung cancer and originally the doctors told him he was going

58
00:03:58.021 --> 00:03:59.640
to live for six months,

59
00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.480
but that was in I think 2012 he had retired in 2001

60
00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.760
and I sit there thinking about faculty and actually Btf Tony talked about him,

61
00:04:14.671 --> 00:04:18.420
called him fat when he was on the podcast because we all called him Faq.

62
00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:20.130
But I remembered,

63
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:21.430
<v 1>yeah,</v>

64
00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.400
<v 0>just a bunch of different things about fac.</v>

65
00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:28.360
And one of the things that I remembered was I had come back from my third

66
00:04:28.361 --> 00:04:31.600
deployment,
so this is in the nineties back in the day.

67
00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:37.110
And I had done my third deployment and I had been moved into the training

68
00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:40.930
department at seal team one.

69
00:04:40.931 --> 00:04:43.840
So instead of doing a workup and going on deployment,

70
00:04:43.841 --> 00:04:45.520
the way the teams used to be set up,
you would,

71
00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.420
you would go into training cell and the team trained itself,

72
00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:54.400
the training department at seal team one train to the platoons at seal team one

73
00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.590
later it became that we had a big centralized training command.

74
00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.230
That's what I ran before I got out before I retired.
I ran that,

75
00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.510
the trade at on the west coast.

76
00:05:04.511 --> 00:05:07.930
But it used to be each team had their own training cell and that's how you would

77
00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.410
train platoons to get ready for their deployments.

78
00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.990
<v 1>Okay.</v>

79
00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:17.990
<v 0>And of course nobody really wanted to be in training cell because it meant you</v>

80
00:05:19.081 --> 00:05:21.900
couldn't go on deployment and that's why you joined the seal teams is to go on

81
00:05:21.901 --> 00:05:22.734
deployment.

82
00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:28.800
And for whatever reason we'd in a bunch of us from my platoon that I'd gone

83
00:05:28.801 --> 00:05:30.780
through buds with a bunch of guys,

84
00:05:30.781 --> 00:05:32.410
we don't all done three platoons and they kinda,

85
00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:36.270
we all kinda got thrown into training cell at the same time and we'd been in

86
00:05:36.271 --> 00:05:39.360
there for a couple days.
I mean maybe less than a week,

87
00:05:39.361 --> 00:05:40.290
we'd come back from deployment,

88
00:05:40.291 --> 00:05:44.610
we get put into training cell and I kind of forget what happened,

89
00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:49.620
but a couple of guys that were getting ready to deploy got hurt.

90
00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:50.491
In fact,

91
00:05:50.491 --> 00:05:53.520
it might've been guys had gotten hurt as soon as they got over there and maybe

92
00:05:53.521 --> 00:05:56.010
they didn't go on deployment.
The guys that went and replaced us,

93
00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:00.440
all of a sudden they needed a couple guys and at corridors in the morning,

94
00:06:00.441 --> 00:06:04.850
that's when
at seal team one,

95
00:06:04.851 --> 00:06:07.790
they used to have quarters in the morning where you all stand up and line up,

96
00:06:07.791 --> 00:06:10.010
sort of like your typical military formation.

97
00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:12.920
Everyone would kind of line up and buy platoon in.

98
00:06:12.921 --> 00:06:17.921
The platoons would all report in those old school team one deal right there.

99
00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:23.660
And then if there was any important announcements to make than the announcements

100
00:06:23.661 --> 00:06:27.260
would get made and then everyone would go about their day.
Well,

101
00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:31.970
the announcement that got made that morning was,

102
00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:35.270
hey,
we need two guys to go on deployment.

103
00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:39.710
Is there anyone here that feels like going on deployment or can go on
deployment?

104
00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:43.400
And of course it's a big deal,
right,

105
00:06:43.401 --> 00:06:45.860
to just pick up and go and leave for six months.

106
00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:51.130
And it was actually my roommate at the time who had been my roommate who I went

107
00:06:51.771 --> 00:06:54.830
through buds with and who I did three platoons with.

108
00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.500
I went through seal tactical training with,

109
00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:01.110
with them and we were actually roommates that entire time.
So we were,

110
00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:05.700
we were tight.
You'd my brother and when they asked this question of,
Hey,

111
00:07:05.701 --> 00:07:10.280
is there anybody here that can go on deployment like tomorrow or the next day?

112
00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:15.410
And basically out of the whole team,
it was him and me.
We raised our hands,
said,

113
00:07:15.411 --> 00:07:19.270
yeah,
hey,
we'll go.
Because at that time,
you know,

114
00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:21.590
we were just single team guys.
We didn't have anything else.

115
00:07:21.591 --> 00:07:22.760
We literally had nothing else.

116
00:07:22.761 --> 00:07:27.140
You could put our whole world into two crews boxes and we could ship anywhere in

117
00:07:27.141 --> 00:07:29.000
the world.
We didn't care.
We had no attachments.

118
00:07:29.001 --> 00:07:32.060
We had didn't care about anything.
So of course we raised our hands

119
00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:35.690
and as soon as our hands went up,

120
00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:41.530
master chief faculty gave us a glare because he was the guy that was in charge

121
00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:42.800
of training cell.

122
00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:48.470
So he gave us a glare and quarters ended and he goes,

123
00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:51.410
he said,
hey,
what you guys come up to Gerson talk to me real quick.

124
00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:56.390
And I was thinking,
okay,
we must have done something wrong.

125
00:07:56.420 --> 00:08:00.590
And you sometimes you didn't know what you did wrong.
But I,
me and my buddy,

126
00:08:00.591 --> 00:08:01.940
we figured we'd done something wrong.

127
00:08:01.941 --> 00:08:05.510
So we went up there and actually actually now to think about it when he brought

128
00:08:05.511 --> 00:08:09.850
us into the chief's mess and we were like he fours or fives at the time and so

129
00:08:09.851 --> 00:08:12.800
gold getting pulled into the chief chiefs mess.
I'd never been in there before.

130
00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:17.900
And I was like scared thinking,
well what did I thought I did something wrong.

131
00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:21.610
I thought that I left a trail of some crime,

132
00:08:21.611 --> 00:08:26.360
I committed and now we're getting busted and we get up there and basically he

133
00:08:26.361 --> 00:08:30.200
reamed us out and he says,
listen,
you guys need to be in training.
So,

134
00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:33.110
and he was making great points I didn't recognize at the time.
And he's like,

135
00:08:33.111 --> 00:08:34.400
look,
if you want to be professionals,

136
00:08:34.401 --> 00:08:35.720
if this is where you're going to learn a lot,

137
00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:39.440
we need good guys to be teaching the rest of the platoons.

138
00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:41.570
That's why you're in here.
You're not going on deployment.

139
00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:46.040
Shut up and I'm pulling your names out of the hat and they'll find two other

140
00:08:46.041 --> 00:08:48.440
people that can go,
we'll send some new guys over there.
Doesn't matter.

141
00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:52.430
So that's what it was.
That was this little story.
And it was,

142
00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:54.320
it was funny because you know,
we were,

143
00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:58.140
it was just funny from multiple reasons when I thought back about it,

144
00:08:58.141 --> 00:09:00.780
just the fact that you're in a point in your life,

145
00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:05.370
I think I was probably like 23 or 24 years old.
And just,

146
00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:07.530
just think about right now,
if someone says,
Hey,

147
00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:09.720
can you just leave for six months tomorrow?

148
00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:12.870
I mean there's not too many people that can just pull up and do that.

149
00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:15.990
So there's that.
There's the fact that,
you know,

150
00:09:15.991 --> 00:09:19.740
faculty was bringing us into the chief's mess and we were all nervous about
that.

151
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:22.050
And then the fact that,
you know,
faculty,

152
00:09:22.051 --> 00:09:24.780
what he was actually doing was trying to look out for us and try to look out for

153
00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:27.000
our careers and trying to look out for the seal team.

154
00:09:27.001 --> 00:09:29.520
He was trying to do the right thing and it was,
was one of those,

155
00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:35.690
one of those little stories and there's just all these little stories like that

156
00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:38.170
that,

157
00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:42.540
that make up that whole era of my life,

158
00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:45.400
that whole time as a young enlisted guy on seal team on,

159
00:09:45.401 --> 00:09:48.780
it's this whole bunch of memories.

160
00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:55.940
And when he died I got this feeling that those memories,

161
00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:05.150
those those days are over rector going

162
00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:12.270
because at least partially because when fac was around a part of those memories

163
00:10:12.271 --> 00:10:13.500
are facts,
memories.

164
00:10:13.501 --> 00:10:18.501
Like only he could tell us what he was thinking at that time and when he dies,

165
00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:22.680
when he died,
then they didn't.
Those memories are gone.

166
00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:26.930
And Ricky,
I can't ask him about them.

167
00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:31.850
I can't go and have a beer with them and talk about that time.

168
00:10:31.851 --> 00:10:36.650
And hear his side of it.
Like,
no,
they're,
they're not here,
they're gone.

169
00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:46.490
And
right as I was,
you know,
again,

170
00:10:46.491 --> 00:10:51.491
going up to see Mikey Monsoor at Rosecrance and continue to think about that and

171
00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:57.500
thinking about the memories that Mikey had and

172
00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:00.820
how those are going.
Okay.

173
00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:08.810
But I didn't have too much time to dig into those thoughts because the next

174
00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:11.720
morning,
September 30th,

175
00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:15.680
2017 that's when I got word that the Delta platoon commander,

176
00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:20.630
my brother Seth stone had died as well.

177
00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:25.943
And

178
00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:31.150
all kinds of memories

179
00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:37.310
died with him.
I mean,
I got my half of them,

180
00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:39.890
but it's half,

181
00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:45.280
it's incomplete conversations and jokes and guitar jams.

182
00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:50.270
And then on top of those I get little,

183
00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:51.370
<v 1>yeah,</v>

184
00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:56.370
<v 0>like Seth was incredibly smart and he'd give me little ideas,</v>

185
00:11:57.491 --> 00:11:58.450
little FOBTs,

186
00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:02.980
but only the beginning of them because there's millions of things to talk about

187
00:12:02.981 --> 00:12:07.390
and you think you've got your whole life to,
to consider those things,

188
00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:11.723
but you don't.

189
00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:19.480
And I get that we can try and talk about them or we can try and write them down

190
00:12:21.201 --> 00:12:26.201
and we can do everything in our power to try and hang on to those things.

191
00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:34.220
No,
but the fact of the matter is you,
you can't,

192
00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:41.020
you can't preserve them in their true form.

193
00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:46.220
It's just gone.

194
00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:56.270
And as I

195
00:12:58.490 --> 00:13:02.620
thought about that and as I continue to think about that and try and figure out

196
00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:06.520
what can we do?

197
00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:09.123
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

198
00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:10.220
<v 0>If we can't</v>

199
00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:16.010
preserve these memories

200
00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:21.890
then what can we do
mean?

201
00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:26.910
I think the best thing that we can do is try and make more.

202
00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:28.803
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

203
00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:34.510
<v 0>Try and make more,</v>

204
00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:37.570
make more memories.

205
00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:42.323
So

206
00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:46.850
to keep in mind what uncle Jake said.

207
00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:48.443
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

208
00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:53.150
<v 0>Wife goes by like a summer day.</v>

209
00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:57.470
So you better take advantage of it.
Right?

210
00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:04.580
When your best make yourself
some memories along the way.

211
00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:14.080
And with that,
the echo.
Yes.

212
00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:18.620
It's been a little while since we
did some Q.
And.
A.
Yes sir.

213
00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.920
What do you got?
We got some questions from the inner webs.
All right,

214
00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:26.390
we'll go into it.
First question,

215
00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:30.290
what do you do when the boss always says we can't,

216
00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:35.360
but does it offer logical and reasonable alternatives to make positive forward

217
00:14:35.361 --> 00:14:39.720
changes?
Should one just do what they think is best and not listened to the boss?

218
00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:44.780
Uh,
okay.
First of all,
what we want to do is we want to support the boss.

219
00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:49.130
We want to build a relationship with the boss.

220
00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:50.790
What's the best way to support the boss?
Which quote?

221
00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:53.240
The way to build relationship is to be a performer.

222
00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:58.220
Be a performer inside the box,
right?
That the bosses said,
you can't do this.

223
00:14:58.221 --> 00:15:02.750
You can't do that.
Cool.
We're going to do the best we can in side the box.

224
00:15:03.890 --> 00:15:06.410
And once you do that,
once you,
once you actually,

225
00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:12.770
once you actually are a performer,
then you have leverage.

226
00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:16.880
Then you can actually talk about a different way of doing things.

227
00:15:16.881 --> 00:15:20.600
You can bring up a legitimate idea to the boss and they may well they have a

228
00:15:20.601 --> 00:15:24.800
better chance of listening to you.
So that's what you gotta do.

229
00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:28.250
You gotta play the game a little bit.
You gotta,
you gotta become a performer.

230
00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:30.440
You've got to do what it is,

231
00:15:30.441 --> 00:15:34.430
the way they want it done to the best of your ability,
be successful with it.

232
00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:40.240
And then once you built up some clout and some relationship and maybe a little

233
00:15:42.321 --> 00:15:43.580
political capital,

234
00:15:43.581 --> 00:15:47.360
then you can present a new idea and when you present the new idea,

235
00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:49.130
have the facts lined up,

236
00:15:49.131 --> 00:15:54.131
don't go in there half cocked and present your idea and hopefully gets cleared.

237
00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:57.080
Now that's one,
that's section A.

238
00:15:58.250 --> 00:16:02.660
Section B is do you got to make things happen?
Sometimes you,

239
00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:04.490
and depending on how,

240
00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:09.790
like it's that whole thing of it's better to beg forgiveness than ask for

241
00:16:11.211 --> 00:16:15.020
permission.
That's a really,
that's a,
it's,
it's,
it's a,
it's a tool.

242
00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:19.400
It's definitely a tool.
If you abuse it,
if you're going to get crushed,

243
00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:25.170
if it's one of those things where the boss has told you not to do something and

244
00:16:25.671 --> 00:16:28.610
you decide,
well I'm going to do it anyways and I'll just beg for forgiveness,

245
00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:30.800
they actually told you not to do it.

246
00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:35.060
That's not where you're supposed to use that tool.
Yeah,
that's just,
that's just,

247
00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:39.890
that's just unsat onset.
If it's something where,

248
00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:43.400
well I kind of suspect that the boss might not want it this way,

249
00:16:43.401 --> 00:16:44.600
but you know what,

250
00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:48.350
chances are it's going to go in my direction and chances are it's going to be

251
00:16:48.351 --> 00:16:51.320
beneficial and chances are the boss might not even found out.

252
00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:55.490
And if the boss does find out this isn't something that they've ever declared

253
00:16:55.491 --> 00:16:56.550
hostile,
right.

254
00:16:57.140 --> 00:17:02.140
So you'll be okay in that situation too to beg for forgiveness but don't abuse

255
00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:09.500
that tool.
And in which you do is you start if when you're inside the,
hey,

256
00:17:09.501 --> 00:17:10.460
I'm going to beg for forgiveness,

257
00:17:10.510 --> 00:17:13.340
then you can start actually doing something in developing a standard operating

258
00:17:13.341 --> 00:17:16.250
procedure that makes sense.
And then once you get it solidified,

259
00:17:16.251 --> 00:17:18.230
you'd go to the Boston say,
Hey boss,
we've been doing this a different way.

260
00:17:18.231 --> 00:17:21.560
I want to let you know I want to show you what we've been doing cause we,

261
00:17:21.561 --> 00:17:22.470
you know,
you know,
Boston,

262
00:17:22.471 --> 00:17:24.560
we never really had a specific way of getting this done.

263
00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:27.740
And I know some other people did it like this and some people did it like that.

264
00:17:27.890 --> 00:17:29.180
We came up with a methodology,

265
00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:31.580
actually wrote the whole thing out for you so you can see exactly what we're

266
00:17:31.581 --> 00:17:35.960
doing.
Boom was going to say no to that.
Plus it's been successful 80 times.
Boom,

267
00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:40.310
we're good.
So,
so that's what you want to do.
That's pretty,

268
00:17:40.311 --> 00:17:41.810
pretty straight forward.
Don't,

269
00:17:42.050 --> 00:17:45.650
don't just straight disobeyed the boss on less.

270
00:17:45.651 --> 00:17:47.690
The bosses are telling you to do something that's gonna get someone killed or

271
00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:50.010
illegal or whatever.
But

272
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:53.220
<v 2>if they're just have a different idea or something,
just go with it,</v>

273
00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:56.520
execute it,
become a good performer.

274
00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:58.860
And then once you have that relationship built,

275
00:17:58.861 --> 00:18:02.010
you'll have all kinds of influence over your boss always had crazy influence

276
00:18:02.011 --> 00:18:05.250
over my bosses.
Yeah.
I don't want to sound,
I want to say in an arrogant way.

277
00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:08.700
It wasn't like I was manipulating my bosses,
but my boss is like,

278
00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:11.940
I was honest with my bosses and they,
I did good work.
And so when I said,

279
00:18:11.941 --> 00:18:15.630
hey boss is,
we sure we should do it this way.
They'd be like,

280
00:18:15.631 --> 00:18:17.250
well what do you think?
And I'd say,
well,
here's what I think,

281
00:18:17.251 --> 00:18:20.240
and then we'd get shit done.
So pretty straightforward.

282
00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:26.310
Pretty straightforward.
Yeah.
That asking for forgiveness thing Dubiski move.

283
00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:28.770
Is that a risky move?
But sometimes it's a great,
great move.
Yeah.

284
00:18:28.771 --> 00:18:30.930
If you kind of like how you said like don't abuse it,

285
00:18:30.931 --> 00:18:35.040
where you know there's levels to it where there's like little things,

286
00:18:35.041 --> 00:18:35.970
32 levels.

287
00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:42.120
So like if you,
if there's one that's like how you said,

288
00:18:42.121 --> 00:18:45.090
like he told you not to do something,
and this goes for like anyone,

289
00:18:45.091 --> 00:18:48.150
like you're eating when you're dealing with like even your friends kind of
thing,

290
00:18:48.151 --> 00:18:51.840
you know,
where if they,
if you know for a fact that they don't want you to do it.

291
00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:55.620
So that's why you'd prefer not to ask for permission because you know they're

292
00:18:55.621 --> 00:18:57.400
going to say no,
but you know,
it's like about,

293
00:18:57.470 --> 00:19:00.300
you shouldn't do that and you know that.
But if it's the kind where it's like,

294
00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:03.930
hmm,
I can see why he'd want to do it,
maybe this way,

295
00:19:03.931 --> 00:19:06.870
or maybe not even necessarily want to do this way because maybe he doesn't see

296
00:19:06.871 --> 00:19:10.560
the benefits that we see right now,
but,
and he's still closed minded.
He's,

297
00:19:10.561 --> 00:19:13.110
you know,
he has that reputation,
so let's,
let's sort of do it.

298
00:19:13.111 --> 00:19:15.210
I you said successfully,
you know,
kind of thing.
So,

299
00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:18.210
and then that's when the other side of the spectrum,
you know,
but some people,

300
00:19:18.211 --> 00:19:22.290
men,
they'll just like take it to level five or whatever and be like,
oh yeah,

301
00:19:22.291 --> 00:19:23.200
they're going to hate this boat.

302
00:19:23.201 --> 00:19:25.850
It's better to ask for forgiveness than permission.
Goosing those two guaranteed.

303
00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:27.350
No and forgiveness at least liking of,

304
00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:29.250
but probably you're going to damage the relationship.

305
00:19:29.251 --> 00:19:32.750
If you do this kind of stuff,
then you're going to get tightened down on.
Yeah.

306
00:19:32.770 --> 00:19:36.530
Right.
Like a step backwards.
Oh yeah man,
it's true.
Don't,
don't let that happen.

307
00:19:36.531 --> 00:19:38.520
Don't let that next question.

308
00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:43.320
I'm the youngest leader in my firm's history.

309
00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:48.120
I try and implement extreme ownership and default aggressiveness in my team.

310
00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:52.710
Being so young,
some of my elders subordinate sometimes dismiss my directors.

311
00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:56.640
How do I lead those people effectively?
Okay.

312
00:19:56.850 --> 00:20:01.850
So I actually hate when I get this question or questions like this because it

313
00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:07.670
means that I screwed up that sort of gains.
I don't like to screw up.

314
00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:09.420
When I see a question like this,

315
00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:14.970
it means that somebody has misinterpreted the message a little bit and they

316
00:20:14.971 --> 00:20:17.880
haven't read the dichotomy of leadership for sure in my opinion.

317
00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:20.520
Because if you read the dichotomy of leadership,

318
00:20:20.521 --> 00:20:23.310
you'll see that extreme ownership and default aggressive are supposed to be

319
00:20:23.311 --> 00:20:27.840
balanced.
And so that's what's going on here.

320
00:20:27.841 --> 00:20:30.420
You got someone that's like,
you know what?
I'm good at to take extreme ownership.

321
00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:33.300
We're doing this my way.
I'm the boss,

322
00:20:33.450 --> 00:20:38.100
I'm a leader and that's just horrible and everyone hates you.
So Bro,

323
00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:40.590
you're young.
They don't hate you because you're young.

324
00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:43.440
They're not mad at you because you're an experienced.

325
00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:48.220
They don't dismiss you because um,
because you

326
00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:51.070
<v 0>are a decade younger than them.
That's not why it's happening.</v>

327
00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:56.260
It's happening because you are lacking humility.

328
00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:58.660
You haven't built up any relationship with these people.

329
00:20:58.930 --> 00:21:01.030
You haven't built up any leadership capital with them.

330
00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:03.760
You haven't asked them how they think they should do things.

331
00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:06.960
You haven't asked them what they'd been doing for the last 22 years while you

332
00:21:06.961 --> 00:21:10.240
were going to middle school.
Right.

333
00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:13.510
So come in,
be humble.

334
00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:16.780
The best way to gain respect from people in this is what's hard to do it.

335
00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:19.390
This is what's hard to understand.
You want people to respect.
You.

336
00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:24.310
Ask them a question,
listen to what they have to say.
Listen to their opinion.

337
00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:26.380
If they come up with a good plan,
use their plan.

338
00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:31.510
The worst way to gain respect from people is to go in and demand respect from

339
00:21:31.511 --> 00:21:35.330
people is to go in and say,
I'm implementing default.
Chris,

340
00:21:35.331 --> 00:21:37.990
if you've not heard of that,
you've never read extreme ownership,
have you?

341
00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:40.480
I'll tell you what,
that's the way we're doing it here.

342
00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:44.590
I'll get you a copy so you can read up and get on board with my program.

343
00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:48.700
These are all bad,
so I'm not trying to say you sound just like that,

344
00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:51.580
but you might sound something like that and you don't need to be too far off

345
00:21:51.581 --> 00:21:54.880
that,
so appreciate that you're getting after it,

346
00:21:54.910 --> 00:21:58.810
but what you need to get after more is some balance.
Be Humble.

347
00:21:58.870 --> 00:22:02.440
Listen to the team,
listen to what they have to say.
Ask for their input,

348
00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:06.760
follow their input when you can.
That's a little black belt move.

349
00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:11.080
It's a little black belt and it's actually a blue belt move.
But blue belt,

350
00:22:11.081 --> 00:22:15.100
purple belt move like,
Hey,
my team gives me input.
I listened to them.

351
00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:17.850
We actually,
you know,
hey echo,
how do you think we should,

352
00:22:17.851 --> 00:22:20.110
I think we should attack this target from the north.
Okay,
sounds good.

353
00:22:20.111 --> 00:22:23.410
Why don't we roll with that?
That's a blue belt move man.
What's a,

354
00:22:23.411 --> 00:22:27.880
what's a white belt move negative?
No,
the white belt moves like,
hey echo,

355
00:22:27.881 --> 00:22:30.110
we're doing this,
we're talking just target from the south.
I'm,

356
00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:32.680
you've got any questions?
And you're like,

357
00:22:32.681 --> 00:22:34.870
well I think I could from the north might be a little bit better.

358
00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:37.270
That might be what you think,
but that's not what we're doing.

359
00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:40.520
Plus I'm in charge cause I got ownership of this whole thing and um,

360
00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:45.250
I'm default aggressive.
Sort of do what I said.
So don't be that guy,
man,

361
00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:48.860
to try and back off a little bit.
Try and do.

362
00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:52.120
As a leader you should be looking at like what are your primary goals?

363
00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:55.420
If your primary goal is to form a relationship with your team,

364
00:22:55.570 --> 00:23:00.100
with the people in your team.
Yeah.
So get it done.
I remember in Jujitsu one time,

365
00:23:00.101 --> 00:23:03.730
Greg Macintyre,
great country.
Yes.
He,
uh,

366
00:23:05.690 --> 00:23:09.270
he,
uh,
he was teaching a move in the move that he was teaching.
He,
uh,

367
00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:11.440
apparently got from me

368
00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:17.050
and so he was teaching this move or whatever.
And uh,
you know,
sitting there,

369
00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:20.950
we're all in.
He was teaching,
he taught,
he taught,

370
00:23:20.951 --> 00:23:23.920
he had taught a good thought it way better than I could teach.
Yeah.
Way Better.

371
00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:27.850
In fact,
he taught it,
I simply probably could not teach this move.
And he,
uh,

372
00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:31.270
and after he was done,
he was like,
Hey,
echo does is move really good too.

373
00:23:31.271 --> 00:23:35.290
The class equity equity,
you have anything to add to them?
And I was like,

374
00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:38.980
oh no,
I don't,
I don't remember if I did.
I don't think I did,

375
00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:43.660
but just that feeling,
you know what,
he included me in it,
you know?

376
00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:48.680
And then it was so,
you know,
even though he was,
you know,
any in his mind,

377
00:23:48.681 --> 00:23:52.100
and I actually thinking back on in my mind like that,
that was kind of my move.

378
00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:53.690
You know,
what move was it?
It was,

379
00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:57.610
it was a card pass move to one always.
Do you

380
00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:02.300
know what you mean by always?
Yeah.

381
00:24:02.301 --> 00:24:05.450
But nonetheless I could just how you say like how you asked their input kind of

382
00:24:05.451 --> 00:24:07.940
thing.
It's like you include them in the thing that just says,

383
00:24:07.941 --> 00:24:12.500
not just asking yet.
It's actually receiving it and implementing it.
That's the,

384
00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:15.310
that's the,
that's the closure of the move man.
Yeah.

385
00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:19.180
That's the closure of the move.
Roy,
talk about like a feeling and granted,

386
00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:20.540
me and Greg are good friends anyway,

387
00:24:20.541 --> 00:24:23.690
but I'm just saying like you can imagine that situation,
how they,

388
00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:25.790
how anyone would feel when you,

389
00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:27.680
especially if you're older than this little young buck,

390
00:24:27.681 --> 00:24:31.340
who does he think he is and he comes to you.
You're like,
Oh hell yeah.
Okay.

391
00:24:31.341 --> 00:24:34.400
This guy knows like,
you know,
we can,
we can do this together.

392
00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:37.850
Really get that feeling.
I would imagine.
Anyway,
that's what you want to do,

393
00:24:37.851 --> 00:24:40.920
Mr youngest leader in your firm's history.
Dan,
congrats on that.

394
00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:42.800
Congrats on you're getting after it.

395
00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:46.940
What got you there may not get you to the next level.
What got you there?

396
00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:50.120
Might've been like being aggressive and making things happen and stepping up.

397
00:24:50.121 --> 00:24:50.954
That's cool.

398
00:24:51.050 --> 00:24:56.050
But if you piss off everyone in your department that's not gonna work out good

399
00:24:56.661 --> 00:24:58.850
for you and they'll start to undermine you,
they'll sabotage you.

400
00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:03.410
So you gotta be careful.
Yeah,
that's rough check.
Okay.

401
00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:06.440
Is there a possibility that everyone in the department and you got put in there

402
00:25:06.441 --> 00:25:08.570
to straighten things out?
That's a different question.

403
00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:12.410
That's a different question.
Let me tell you something else.
When you get it,

404
00:25:12.411 --> 00:25:16.100
when people are dismissing what you're saying,
that's a horrible sign.

405
00:25:16.890 --> 00:25:19.220
I'm one of the leadership books that we covered.

406
00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:22.400
The rule was don't give commands that you,

407
00:25:22.401 --> 00:25:26.300
that walk that aren't going to be followed because every time you give a command

408
00:25:26.301 --> 00:25:28.280
that that you know isn't going to be followed,

409
00:25:28.970 --> 00:25:30.110
it's not gonna work out good for you.

410
00:25:30.170 --> 00:25:34.400
It's reinforcing the fact that no one needs to listen to you.
So don't,

411
00:25:34.401 --> 00:25:38.720
don't be giving orders that are being dismissed if somebody doesn't do
something,

412
00:25:38.721 --> 00:25:39.470
you go,
hey man,

413
00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:42.920
I know that I might've come across a little wrong when I was talking to you

414
00:25:42.921 --> 00:25:46.520
about,
you know,
getting this done,
this product part of this task done.

415
00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:48.680
And I see it's still not,
don't is there,

416
00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:49.950
is there some support that you need from me?

417
00:25:49.951 --> 00:25:50.960
Is there some help that you need from me?

418
00:25:50.961 --> 00:25:53.240
Cause this is important that I probably didn't do a good job of explaining why

419
00:25:53.241 --> 00:25:53.601
it's important,

420
00:25:53.601 --> 00:25:56.120
but it is actually connected to this larger project that we're doing over at

421
00:25:56.121 --> 00:25:58.990
headquarters.
This is our part of the task and I don't,

422
00:25:58.991 --> 00:26:00.290
I don't think I explained that very well,

423
00:26:00.291 --> 00:26:02.960
but do you need anything else from me to maybe move this along?

424
00:26:03.290 --> 00:26:08.290
You can't just allow things to be for you to talk to for you to give directions

425
00:26:08.511 --> 00:26:12.000
and they just get blown off.
Like that's not good.
It wouldn't.

426
00:26:12.030 --> 00:26:13.670
I know what I'm not saying,
Oh,

427
00:26:13.671 --> 00:26:16.700
you blow off my order now I'm going to go high order on you.
Right.

428
00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:21.900
That's not what I'm saying.
Yeah.
Yeah,
that makes sense too,
because man,
if I,

429
00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:26.920
if I had a boss who else was primed to dismiss any of his directives and it

430
00:26:28.401 --> 00:26:30.320
happened and it happened successfully,

431
00:26:30.321 --> 00:26:33.410
like all dismissed it and there was really no real repercussions.
Oh,

432
00:26:33.411 --> 00:26:36.570
you better believe I'm picking and choosing what I'm falling.
And by the way,

433
00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:38.670
that's,
he's testing the envelope anyway.

434
00:26:38.670 --> 00:26:43.280
She's testing to see what he can get away with,
but because he sees you're young,

435
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:46.440
buck rolling in here thinks going to tell me what to do,
watch this.

436
00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:50.940
I can listen to you.
Okay,
cool.
Now if you fly off the handle and go nuts,

437
00:26:50.970 --> 00:26:54.570
you know what?
You'll get them to do it immediately.
Yeah.
And then guess what?

438
00:26:54.571 --> 00:26:57.990
You're going to get undermined.
You're going to get usurped.
You're going to get,

439
00:26:58.290 --> 00:27:00.750
they're going to have the project fail just so they can get rid of you.

440
00:27:00.751 --> 00:27:03.830
They're going to laugh at you.
Yeah,
that's bad.
As the,
as the,

441
00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:06.090
as you're getting walked out by the HR department.

442
00:27:07.770 --> 00:27:12.060
So did you gotta be careful man.
You gotta be careful.
That's what I'm saying.

443
00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:14.220
Balance these things out.
Balance.
Extreme ownership.

444
00:27:14.221 --> 00:27:16.260
Get the book dichotomy of leadership.
That's what it's about.

445
00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:21.030
It's about being balanced.
Cool.
Next question,
Jocko.

446
00:27:21.150 --> 00:27:23.340
What do you do when people treat you like a doormat

447
00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:28.770
and then when you finally put your foot down,
they lose their minds?

448
00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:33.720
I tried to be agreeable,
but there's a limit when I stand my ground,

449
00:27:33.721 --> 00:27:36.430
people act shocked.
Any advice?
Yeah,

450
00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:39.510
so this is actually kind of the same thing,
right?

451
00:27:39.511 --> 00:27:43.020
You'd need to be balanced because what's happened with this dude,
I assume,

452
00:27:43.530 --> 00:27:48.100
is that sitting around getting,
getting like a pushover,

453
00:27:48.150 --> 00:27:49.920
like a doormat.
People are kind of walking all over them.

454
00:27:49.921 --> 00:27:54.570
Then all of a sudden he does the instant one 80 and goes,
puts his foot down,

455
00:27:54.630 --> 00:27:58.950
right foot down and now you think that they're going to do a one 80 you think

456
00:27:58.951 --> 00:28:01.740
that they're going to say,
oh,
sorry,
I didn't mean to,
oh sorry.
Echo.
I didn't,

457
00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:04.560
I didn't know that.
That offended you.
I'm sorry.
No,
when you do that,
they're like,

458
00:28:04.561 --> 00:28:07.470
what's wrong with you?
You just started tripping.
Yeah,
yeah.

459
00:28:07.471 --> 00:28:08.730
You're freaking out over nothing.

460
00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:12.660
So of course when you stand their ground they're going to be shocked,
right?

461
00:28:12.690 --> 00:28:15.870
Which is what you're saying happened.
This is like no surprise at all.

462
00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:17.400
So what you need to do is,

463
00:28:18.210 --> 00:28:22.740
is you gotta draw the line a little bit earlier,
but without going nuts.

464
00:28:22.741 --> 00:28:25.560
And I think I got a good example of how you do this.
Okay.

465
00:28:25.561 --> 00:28:30.561
Let's say you've got a dog and the dog is like kind of mellow and happy and just

466
00:28:31.471 --> 00:28:35.700
doesn't,
just all good.
And then like all of a sudden,
you know,

467
00:28:35.701 --> 00:28:40.150
you're walking by the dog one day and pop,
it bites you on the arm.
Like,

468
00:28:40.170 --> 00:28:43.050
like big time.
Yeah,
big time.

469
00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:47.150
How do you feel about that dog get bad?
I don't like that.
That's bad.

470
00:28:47.151 --> 00:28:51.510
That dog is getting put down.
Yeah,
right?
Yes.
This dog,
let's say a bit.

471
00:28:51.511 --> 00:28:54.900
One of your kids.
Oh yeah.
That,
that dog is getting put down.
Okay.
So that,

472
00:28:54.930 --> 00:28:59.930
that's what this guy's doing all acting all like everything's like nothing

473
00:29:00.271 --> 00:29:02.130
bothering me.
And all of a sudden biting people.

474
00:29:03.090 --> 00:29:07.800
Think about what a dog like a normal dog does.
What a normal dog does is it's,

475
00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:11.400
if it starts getting offended a little bit or starts getting problems,
it's,

476
00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:15.210
it like stands up a little bit,
right?
And then it's gonna it's going to grow.

477
00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:21.120
That's an indicator.
So even a kid,
even a child knows,
I don't know what age,

478
00:29:21.121 --> 00:29:25.140
but pretty young kids know that a Groundling dog is uh,
is is a warning.

479
00:29:26.130 --> 00:29:30.570
What else do dogs do?
Dog show their teeth.
That's another warning.
Like,
hey,

480
00:29:30.690 --> 00:29:35.580
that's another line in the sand
and,
and barking,
right?

481
00:29:35.610 --> 00:29:39.140
Cause you have to bark.
And I mean a dog barks at you in a dog barks you,

482
00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:40.800
it's got your attention.
It's growling at you.

483
00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:43.990
You know what's going to happen next if you keep doing whatever it is you're

484
00:29:43.991 --> 00:29:46.150
doing right.
You didn't get back away from that dog.

485
00:29:48.250 --> 00:29:52.380
Now if you did,
if the bud Doggett all those things to you and then it bitch you,

486
00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:54.280
you,
you'll still be mad at it.

487
00:29:54.281 --> 00:29:59.060
But you at least know that you kind of had it coming,
right?
Right.
Yes sir.
Yes.

488
00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:03.610
So,
so there you go.
That's what this dude needs to do a little bit of.

489
00:30:03.730 --> 00:30:07.420
He needs to learn how to growl a little bit.

490
00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:09.670
How to bark a little bit,

491
00:30:09.671 --> 00:30:12.910
how to show your teeth little how to just stand up posture.
Correct.

492
00:30:13.030 --> 00:30:15.610
Cause there's,
you know,
a dog,
if you know dogs at all,

493
00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:20.640
dogs have a posture and they have a posture.
Their ears are down in their,
their,

494
00:30:20.641 --> 00:30:25.540
their tails down.
When,
when they get fired up,
boom,
ears are up there on alert.

495
00:30:25.541 --> 00:30:28.600
Their back is,
they get the cackles can stand up and everything.
That means like,

496
00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:31.930
okay,
that's,
that's even before growling.
That's happening alert.

497
00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:37.710
So this dude needs to learn how to come to an alert in improve his po increases

498
00:30:37.841 --> 00:30:41.650
posture.
In those moments,
not when it's getting too far,

499
00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:46.180
but like when someone,
when someone gives you a Little Jab,
you know,

500
00:30:46.570 --> 00:30:49.930
you can't bite them.
You've got a little,
give a little growl.
Yeah,

501
00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:55.180
back them off a little bit.
You know?
And again,
this is,
I don't know you,
you know,

502
00:30:55.181 --> 00:30:55.991
so it's hard for me to say.

503
00:30:55.991 --> 00:31:00.940
Some people just have a hard time dealing with when people harass them

504
00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:06.550
because I think the best thing to do when somebody makes fun of me is just to

505
00:31:06.551 --> 00:31:11.350
like,
be like,
yeah,
that's a good one.
You know?
Like,
cause you know,

506
00:31:11.351 --> 00:31:14.020
just like we were talking about before we started this podcast,

507
00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:17.680
if I let you know that whatever you just said to me bothers me,
bro.

508
00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:22.430
I can expect you to just keep getting after that until I snapped.
Right.

509
00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:26.190
So you gotta be careful.
You don't want to be all hypersensitive.

510
00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:30.820
The other thing to remember is,
man,
when people are making fun of you,

511
00:31:30.821 --> 00:31:34.600
it's not like they hate you most of the time.
Yeah.
You know,

512
00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:38.710
it's not that big of a deal.
Like people talk smack to each other,
right.

513
00:31:38.711 --> 00:31:42.400
People talk smack to each other and,
and I guarantee this is this,

514
00:31:42.401 --> 00:31:46.300
is this a good way to think about it?
If someone talks smack to you,

515
00:31:47.710 --> 00:31:51.280
if you if and then you both leave,
let's say it's at work,
you go home.

516
00:31:51.490 --> 00:31:55.060
The other person that was talking smack goes home.
You go home.

517
00:31:55.061 --> 00:31:55.990
You're thinking about it.

518
00:31:56.110 --> 00:31:59.110
That person that was talking smack didn't think about it one millisecond after

519
00:31:59.111 --> 00:32:01.540
we left the office.
He doesn't care.
He's not sitting there thinking about you.

520
00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:03.760
He's not thinking like,
man,
Oh man,

521
00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:08.470
I'm really glad I told you know you had a funny looking eyebrows.

522
00:32:08.471 --> 00:32:11.530
That was awesome.
I can't leave a weird,
his eyebrows are like,

523
00:32:11.531 --> 00:32:15.400
I mean that's like he's not doing that right.
He's not even thinking about it.

524
00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:18.340
He just went home.
He's carried on his life.
Carry on with your life.

525
00:32:18.550 --> 00:32:20.650
Don't get all tied up about what these other people are thinking of you.

526
00:32:20.651 --> 00:32:23.530
It's not that big of a deal.
Don't sit around thinking about it's,
it's a,

527
00:32:23.770 --> 00:32:27.280
it's a perception that we have that the whole world revolves around us and that

528
00:32:27.281 --> 00:32:28.930
people are sitting around thinking about us all the time.

529
00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:31.540
It's like they're not thinking about you all the time.
They don't care.

530
00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:32.410
They're there at home.

531
00:32:32.410 --> 00:32:35.470
There's not too many people that are actually thinking about you all the time,

532
00:32:36.250 --> 00:32:38.730
especially if they're making fun of you.
Like they're,

533
00:32:38.731 --> 00:32:39.980
they're not thinking about that all

534
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:44.720
<v 2>the time.
So just relax,
take a wrap off and just,
you know,</v>

535
00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:48.890
try and have a little bit less tension and you know,

536
00:32:48.980 --> 00:32:52.160
and try and learn to growl a little bit or at least protect your space a little

537
00:32:52.161 --> 00:32:53.060
bit.
And I,

538
00:32:53.061 --> 00:32:56.180
these are kind of contrary or contradictory things that I'm saying I want,

539
00:32:56.181 --> 00:32:56.991
I was like,
Hey,
laugh at it.

540
00:32:56.991 --> 00:32:58.670
The other ones I kind of learned to growl a little bit.

541
00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:02.750
I would say first the first method is better.
The first method is like,
Hey,

542
00:33:02.751 --> 00:33:05.660
just laugh it off.
Don't worry about it.
These people aren't thinking about you.

543
00:33:05.661 --> 00:33:09.480
They don't care that probably it's like when we had Jordan Peterson and he who

544
00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:12.080
he was talking about his friend and lunch bucket,
right.

545
00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:15.890
Lunchbucket the guy that worked in and as soon as everyone realized that it

546
00:33:15.891 --> 00:33:17.580
bothered him that they called him lunch bucket,

547
00:33:17.581 --> 00:33:20.360
they've only just called him lunch bucket and then they quit because he couldn't

548
00:33:20.361 --> 00:33:23.960
handle it.
So don't be if you,
if someone calls you a lunch bucket in know cool.

549
00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:27.320
Yeah,
my mom makes a good sandwich,
mom makes a pretty good salary,
you know,

550
00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:32.110
and then boom,
you break out the lunch bucket.
Really like,
you know,
go with it.
No,

551
00:33:32.111 --> 00:33:35.030
no factor.
Yeah.
If you start freaking out about this stuff,

552
00:33:35.031 --> 00:33:38.480
it's going to drive you crazy.
So yeah,
man.
So be careful.

553
00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:42.680
Don't freak out about stuff if you have to learn to stand your ground a little

554
00:33:42.681 --> 00:33:46.880
bit,
but don't just start snapping good dog.
Like,
yeah,
like a rabid dog.

555
00:33:47.450 --> 00:33:51.580
Yeah.
That,
that,
that is a good little escalation.
That example,

556
00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:54.410
the dog thinks Doosan because it's true.
I mean,

557
00:33:54.411 --> 00:33:57.650
getting treated like a doormat that could look like a bunch of different things.

558
00:33:57.651 --> 00:34:02.020
You know,
it's teasing.
That seems like the obvious one or whatever.
But you know,

559
00:34:02.030 --> 00:34:05.780
that could be a lot of stuff that could be like,
hey,
grab me some coffee.
Yeah,

560
00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:09.980
right.
Sometimes people just do that because you haven't ever said to him like,

561
00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:13.370
you know,
like,
hey man,
are you ever going to get me coffee?
What's up?
You know,

562
00:34:13.371 --> 00:34:15.330
you just make a joke about the same thing.
Yeah,
exactly.

563
00:34:15.331 --> 00:34:18.430
We like dealing with it like as a,
you know,
if something bothers you.
So,

564
00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:23.090
and I could see this maybe happening cause every once in a while,
like,
you know,

565
00:34:23.091 --> 00:34:26.660
you kind of run into these scenarios where like someone does something that you,

566
00:34:26.661 --> 00:34:28.520
um,
you don't really like or you don't,

567
00:34:28.521 --> 00:34:31.520
I don't appreciate the way they treated me right there during that scenario.

568
00:34:31.790 --> 00:34:33.170
And it sort of always happens,

569
00:34:33.171 --> 00:34:35.870
but it's too small to make a big deal out of it at that time.

570
00:34:36.170 --> 00:34:40.270
And when you're a agreeable person who just like,
all right,

571
00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:43.180
I'm going to essentially,
I'm gonna let it slide,
whatever,
you know,

572
00:34:43.220 --> 00:34:46.760
but it happens again then again,
but I'm agreeable.
I'm letting it slide.
Ha Ha.

573
00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:49.880
Maybe I'll even laugh it off and whatever.
So to the other person,

574
00:34:49.881 --> 00:34:50.810
they're just like,
whatever.

575
00:34:50.811 --> 00:34:52.250
They're just how you said they're not thinking about it.

576
00:34:52.251 --> 00:34:54.500
They're just going about their business and they're getting a laugh here and

577
00:34:54.501 --> 00:34:58.220
there,
which instantly gets forgotten and whatever they keep going about their

578
00:34:58.221 --> 00:35:00.770
business.
No,
no,
no factor.

579
00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:06.350
Meanwhile in my head I'm like,
man,
I'm getting tired of this.

580
00:35:06.351 --> 00:35:08.930
I'm straight up.
So it happens one day.

581
00:35:08.931 --> 00:35:10.940
Maybe I got a little less sleep that day or something.

582
00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:14.380
One teeny tiny thing from flying off the handle.
Yeah.

583
00:35:14.510 --> 00:35:18.050
Hey I don't appreciate this and this and that.
You do and you always do it.

584
00:35:18.051 --> 00:35:21.590
And they're like,
oh he's August.
Cause even if I did,
I didn't get any.

585
00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:25.850
So then you get this little reputation.
People Act shocked as the guy says,

586
00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:30.170
you know,
when I stand my ground,
it's the other person.
Just kind of like,

587
00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:32.630
why are you standing your ground right now?
It doesn't make sense.

588
00:35:32.631 --> 00:35:35.600
Like even if I did remember all the Times I've done this,

589
00:35:35.601 --> 00:35:37.250
you were laughing the whole time.
Like it,

590
00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:39.870
it doesn't compute or it's funny now that now that I think,

591
00:35:39.890 --> 00:35:40.890
I think about times in my life,

592
00:35:40.891 --> 00:35:45.510
like when I was younger and someone would stand their ground on me or whatever

593
00:35:45.870 --> 00:35:47.540
and I'd be like,
what are you talk I'd be,

594
00:35:47.541 --> 00:35:50.250
I'd be the exact person that you're talking about saying,

595
00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:53.130
what are you talking about man?
Like I have no idea what you're talking about.

596
00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:55.770
Yeah.
Why are you freaking out right now?
Yeah.
And they're like,

597
00:35:55.771 --> 00:35:58.290
you always say jumps like that.
And maybe I put together like,
okay,

598
00:35:58.291 --> 00:35:59.124
maybe I do make them.

599
00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:03.540
Whereas now that I'm older and if someone was to freak out like that on me,

600
00:36:03.541 --> 00:36:05.970
I would instantly recognize,
think to myself like,
you know what?

601
00:36:05.970 --> 00:36:08.670
I probably do things that I shouldn't.
I probably,
oh yeah,

602
00:36:08.671 --> 00:36:11.370
I kind of ride this person and that's why they're freaking out right now.
Yeah.

603
00:36:11.610 --> 00:36:16.610
A little bit more aware of my impact and,

604
00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:20.430
but in a way you sort of had to,
I mean I'm sure you've sort of,

605
00:36:20.490 --> 00:36:23.880
you're sort of familiar with this,
you know,
even like painting that picture,

606
00:36:23.881 --> 00:36:25.700
it's like,
it's obviously you're familiar with this,

607
00:36:26.370 --> 00:36:30.300
but when it's happening to you,
you're kind of not.
But then if you have to go,

608
00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:35.660
go back and do like some investigation of your whole like relationship with the

609
00:36:36.121 --> 00:36:38.370
person to understand,
okay,

610
00:36:38.610 --> 00:36:42.930
now I see how that could have been interpreted back last year and then maybe

611
00:36:42.931 --> 00:36:45.930
three months ago and then made me last weekend.
Then we're like right now,

612
00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:49.980
okay I'm after,
you know,
then it it,
but it doesn't compute naturally,
you know?

613
00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:54.420
So yeah,
if you do that,
the escalating dog thing,
it'll,

614
00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:57.070
it'll be more clear I think.
Yeah.
And you can stand,

615
00:36:57.071 --> 00:37:00.870
there may be an escalated dog only escalate the dog scenario if you can't just

616
00:37:00.871 --> 00:37:03.630
have a good time with it and relax and not worry about it.
Yeah.

617
00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:07.680
Which is the primary goal.
Yes.
But being treated like a doormat,
like I said,

618
00:37:07.681 --> 00:37:11.010
like if you know how like people are just so you know,
people,

619
00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:15.300
a people pleaser type of person,
like in a relationship or something like,
um,

620
00:37:15.630 --> 00:37:19.470
you know,
like,
uh,
hold on.
I can't think of an example.

621
00:37:19.471 --> 00:37:24.100
But Kevin have a movie reference.
That's very pathetic
actually.

622
00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:29.820
Anyway.
If you're like a people pleaser and you do everything for,
you know,

623
00:37:29.821 --> 00:37:32.340
and then they don't do it back,
you know,
kind of thing.
Like,
Oh yeah,

624
00:37:32.341 --> 00:37:34.830
you let your husband or wife or whatever,

625
00:37:34.831 --> 00:37:37.440
you let them go out every Saturday just because they want to,

626
00:37:37.441 --> 00:37:40.150
they want to go play poker or you know,
one of these things that,

627
00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:43.020
what's the common thing that they do and they do when they come back late on

628
00:37:43.021 --> 00:37:46.440
drugs.
But no,
well it'd be way worse than that.

629
00:37:46.441 --> 00:37:50.520
It'll be just total like whatever you need or want.
You got it.

630
00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:53.090
And then like the one time they say,
hey,
I want to go shopping on this.

631
00:37:53.110 --> 00:37:55.500
They'd be like,
oh,
shopping will the,
you gotta do this,
you gotta do the kid,

632
00:37:55.501 --> 00:37:56.490
you know,
like that kind of thing.

633
00:37:56.491 --> 00:38:00.570
Where it's like a disproportionate like relationship,
you know,

634
00:38:00.571 --> 00:38:02.340
kind of thing like that can,

635
00:38:02.370 --> 00:38:05.550
I can see it can go down with those types of relationships.

636
00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:09.300
You know like being at a,
you can't just laugh those things off in life.
You know,

637
00:38:09.301 --> 00:38:11.880
you do have to do the escalation of text and be like,
hey,

638
00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:16.830
that's a little bit more serious.
Yeah,
true.
Next question.
Hey Jocko,

639
00:38:16.950 --> 00:38:20.640
I'm a business owner in the beginning stages of merging with another company.

640
00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:25.770
The other company doesn't know much about what we do,

641
00:38:26.610 --> 00:38:31.080
but it has the sales and marketing marketing we need just at a conference with

642
00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:35.980
just at a conference call with him and it didn't go well.
They're wanting to,
the

643
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:40.180
<v 0>pay structure for contractors as well as change how we build our customers.</v>

644
00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:40.920
All the,

645
00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:45.550
all for the benefit of money to ching see some money on that one.

646
00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:48.610
Is it not a good idea to have,

647
00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:53.320
have the primary mission be about money in more so on the success of the

648
00:38:53.321 --> 00:38:56.730
customer or is it good to be money motivated?
I,

649
00:38:57.250 --> 00:39:01.870
I have and enjoy all your books.
Oh yeah.
That's cool.
Any advice would be helpful.

650
00:39:01.871 --> 00:39:04.060
So that means you've read the dichotomy of leadership,
I hope,

651
00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:08.980
because this is the answer of the day,
need to be more balanced.
Okay.
So

652
00:39:10.570 --> 00:39:13.840
if you're money hungry,
right?
Which is what this is sounding like,

653
00:39:13.870 --> 00:39:16.300
if you're money hungry,
correct.
If you're money hungry,

654
00:39:16.301 --> 00:39:18.190
you're going to cut corners on product.

655
00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:23.020
The product is going to be weak or,
or low quality,

656
00:39:23.410 --> 00:39:26.350
you're going to do wrong by the customer.
Right?
Cause when you,

657
00:39:26.351 --> 00:39:29.890
when you get a chance to,
you know,
the customer,
the customer placed an order,

658
00:39:29.891 --> 00:39:30.970
a double word,
or by action,

659
00:39:30.971 --> 00:39:35.440
they click the click thing twice and they still gonna have to pay that

660
00:39:35.441 --> 00:39:38.650
restocking fee,
you know,
whatever.
Like whatever the thing is,
right?

661
00:39:38.890 --> 00:39:40.630
You treat customers like that and they're gonna go,
okay,

662
00:39:40.631 --> 00:39:42.730
well we don't really want to shop with you anymore.

663
00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:46.420
And you end up with a bad reputation and the quality is low and no,

664
00:39:46.421 --> 00:39:49.720
eventually you have no more business.
That's what's going to happen.
So,
so no,

665
00:39:49.721 --> 00:39:54.721
we can't go hardcore money grubbing just,

666
00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:57.250
that's our,
that's our focus.

667
00:39:58.210 --> 00:40:01.600
Other end of the spectrum is,
hey,

668
00:40:01.601 --> 00:40:05.800
we're paying our contractors too much.
Is that possible?
Yes,
it's possible.

669
00:40:06.250 --> 00:40:09.820
You're giving your customers too much or giving them too good of a price point

670
00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:13.150
and guess it was now going to happen.
Same thing.

671
00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:14.320
You're going to not have a business anymore.

672
00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:18.100
So one you have your business goes out of business because your cause you don't

673
00:40:18.101 --> 00:40:20.300
have any business anymore because you've treated your customers badly.

674
00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:22.480
The contractors don't want to work with you so you have,

675
00:40:22.510 --> 00:40:26.410
you end up shutting down.
This one's opposite.
You're everyone loves you,

676
00:40:26.530 --> 00:40:29.510
you just don't have any money so you're going out of business even at all.

677
00:40:29.770 --> 00:40:34.180
So there has to be some balance.
Do you have to find the right balance?

678
00:40:34.181 --> 00:40:39.181
That's what every company is trying to do now I would say that you would you

679
00:40:41.470 --> 00:40:43.930
where you want to lean and this is probably what you're thinking.

680
00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:48.070
You want to lean toward taking care of the customer.

681
00:40:48.130 --> 00:40:52.780
You want to lean toward giving the contractors good value for their work.

682
00:40:53.230 --> 00:40:55.990
You want to lean toward high quality.

683
00:40:56.350 --> 00:41:00.430
The reason you want to lean towards those things is those are all long term

684
00:41:00.431 --> 00:41:04.300
strategic pay offs,
right?
What's the short term?

685
00:41:04.330 --> 00:41:06.400
The short term is take advantage of the customers.

686
00:41:06.650 --> 00:41:08.980
The short term is screw over the contractors.

687
00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:12.310
The short term has put out low quality stuff.
We make good profit this quarter,

688
00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:17.770
but it's uh,
it's a short term win.
It's a long time,
long term loss.

689
00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:21.070
So that's why I would say lean,
don't go out of control.

690
00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:23.050
You can't go out of control in that direction,

691
00:41:23.620 --> 00:41:27.310
but you can lean towards that direction.
Now as far as the new company,

692
00:41:27.311 --> 00:41:32.290
the merger and all this stuff,
get it.
I get it.
Here's what's going to happen.

693
00:41:32.291 --> 00:41:34.880
What you need to go and build good relationships with those people.

694
00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:35.751
The new company,

695
00:41:35.751 --> 00:41:40.280
they need to be your best friends because if you build relationships with them,

696
00:41:40.310 --> 00:41:42.800
then you can have influence over these points.

697
00:41:43.670 --> 00:41:47.270
If you have an antagonistic relationship and you're the new guy or whatever,

698
00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:51.250
like,
Oh yeah,
the new company that you think they don't,
you're saying that they,

699
00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:55.280
what does he say?
They don't know what we do.
Right?
What do you think they think?

700
00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:57.740
They think you don't know what they do.
They're thinking,
you know what,

701
00:41:57.741 --> 00:42:00.110
you don't even,
hey,
you guys make good money.
Might make good product,

702
00:42:00.111 --> 00:42:02.750
but you can't sell anything.
And we got sales and we got marketing.

703
00:42:02.751 --> 00:42:05.150
We could sell anything.
We don't care what it looks like.

704
00:42:05.151 --> 00:42:07.060
We don't care what the quality is.
That's what they're thinking.
Yeah.

705
00:42:07.850 --> 00:42:12.440
So you need to form a relationship with them because I will tell you with their

706
00:42:12.441 --> 00:42:14.750
sales and marketing,
if you're making a good product,

707
00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:17.570
that's how we get the big time when,

708
00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:21.500
but if you have an antagonistic relationship with them,
uh,

709
00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:24.260
it'll all fall apart and you won't have any influence at all.

710
00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:26.180
And they'll be like,
you don't even know what you're talking about,
dude.

711
00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:28.970
We're just going to jack the price even more and we're going to undercut our per

712
00:42:28.971 --> 00:42:31.030
contractors going to get contractors competing with each other.

713
00:42:31.031 --> 00:42:32.990
They're going to hate each other.
They're going to hate us,
but it doesn't matter.

714
00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:37.250
Look at our bottom line.
So build some relationships there.

715
00:42:40.940 --> 00:42:45.590
<v 2>Next question.
I'm conflicted about where my loyalty lies.</v>

716
00:42:46.250 --> 00:42:47.480
I have a wife and two children,

717
00:42:47.810 --> 00:42:50.810
but I recently took a job within federal law enforcement.

718
00:42:50.820 --> 00:42:54.530
In based on my prior tactical experience,

719
00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:59.540
I'll be given the opportunity to attend the two weeks selection for a position

720
00:42:59.690 --> 00:43:04.370
as an operator on a fulltime tactical team that will most certainly pulled me

721
00:43:04.371 --> 00:43:07.130
away from my family.
My heart is in the right place.

722
00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:11.960
I know this level of sacrifice is needed in order to keep evil at bay.
However,

723
00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:16.640
I believe every father feels that obligation to be at home to raise the
children.

724
00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:22.460
And I'm learning that balancing duty,
responsibility,
loyalty,

725
00:43:22.461 --> 00:43:25.290
commitment to family to country is hard,
hard

726
00:43:26.100 --> 00:43:29.820
<v 0>and maybe impossible.
All right,
so are you,</v>

727
00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:32.630
and he goes on to say that I know you have made this decision yourself.
Yeah.

728
00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:34.650
And I would say to this dude,
um,

729
00:43:35.550 --> 00:43:39.990
actually you are the only person that can make this decision and you're right.

730
00:43:39.991 --> 00:43:40.860
I did make that decision.

731
00:43:41.220 --> 00:43:46.220
I did 20 years and I at the end of 20 years decided to prioritize my family over

732
00:43:46.831 --> 00:43:51.720
the military and over my own desires to cause.
Believe me,

733
00:43:52.050 --> 00:43:54.320
the selfish thing is just keep getting after it.

734
00:43:55.650 --> 00:44:00.600
But also what's important.
I was not good at balancing,

735
00:44:00.750 --> 00:44:01.500
right.
I've,

736
00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:06.500
I ranked and prioritized the teams above my family the whole time I was in and

737
00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:11.130
not everyone does that.
Some people are much better at balancing that.

738
00:44:11.131 --> 00:44:15.990
I did and that's how they do 30 and 32 years and 34 years and 27 years.

739
00:44:16.410 --> 00:44:19.800
They figured out how to balance that better than I did.

740
00:44:20.670 --> 00:44:25.530
And so it sounds like you're even raising this question indicates to me that you

741
00:44:25.531 --> 00:44:29.670
probably have a decent chance of being able to be better at balancing than I do.

742
00:44:30.450 --> 00:44:32.250
So there's that.

743
00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:35.970
The other thing I would say is you say that the being an operator in fulltime

744
00:44:35.971 --> 00:44:38.790
tactical team will most certainly pull me away from my family.

745
00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:42.330
I would research that a little bit,
you know,

746
00:44:42.331 --> 00:44:46.140
because sometimes when you get to a little higher level,

747
00:44:46.141 --> 00:44:48.230
do you have more flexibility and you might,

748
00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:51.210
might actually have time to spend with your family,

749
00:44:51.211 --> 00:44:53.280
might be a little bit different.
Maybe you're on call,

750
00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:56.250
whereas normally you wouldn't be on call.
But now all of a sudden you're on call,

751
00:44:56.251 --> 00:44:58.680
but you're,
while you're on call,
you're at least,
you know you're,

752
00:44:58.740 --> 00:45:01.650
you might be doing,
you might have more family time.
I don't know.

753
00:45:02.370 --> 00:45:05.310
I can tell you that,
you know,
sometimes,
depending on the way you look at it,

754
00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:10.920
you know,
if you look at the special operations community versus the conventional

755
00:45:11.190 --> 00:45:14.430
community,
and it just depends on the units,
depends on a lot of things.

756
00:45:14.431 --> 00:45:18.620
But sometimes,
you know,
the conventional forces going on,
uh,
you know,

757
00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:23.020
16 month deployment to Iraq
and that's a long time.

758
00:45:23.021 --> 00:45:25.960
Some special operations units going on for a month deployments and they'd come

759
00:45:25.961 --> 00:45:30.040
home now they,
now they might do more of those over their career.
But again,

760
00:45:30.250 --> 00:45:32.530
that's something you need to,
you need to find out the facts.

761
00:45:32.531 --> 00:45:34.930
You need to talk to someone that's on that team and say,
Hey,
listen,

762
00:45:34.931 --> 00:45:36.880
here's what's going on.
I got two sons,

763
00:45:37.150 --> 00:45:40.900
they wrestle and they do Jujitsu and I like to go to those tournaments.

764
00:45:40.901 --> 00:45:45.580
What's our schedule like?
How is it going to be,
you know,
and then you kind of,

765
00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:47.320
you,
you can make a better assessment.

766
00:45:47.321 --> 00:45:52.321
I wouldn't just assume that the tactical team has a busier schedule.

767
00:45:54.370 --> 00:45:56.530
I could be wrong.
I could be completely wrong.

768
00:45:56.920 --> 00:46:00.490
What you're probably the assumption you're making,
which is a decent assumption,

769
00:46:00.730 --> 00:46:03.790
is that when you're part of a part of an elite tactical team,

770
00:46:03.791 --> 00:46:06.490
you're going to have to input more time.
It's gonna,
it's gonna.

771
00:46:06.670 --> 00:46:08.470
It's gonna mean more to you and you're going to be like,
okay,

772
00:46:08.471 --> 00:46:12.100
I need to train more.
I'm going to tell you,
she trained more.

773
00:46:12.101 --> 00:46:14.110
No matter what position you're in,
right.

774
00:46:14.111 --> 00:46:16.960
You need to be training as much as you can.
You need to be staying sharp.

775
00:46:17.740 --> 00:46:22.660
So I would do some research on that and then I would also consider this

776
00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:29.700
men have been leaving their families so that they could go and fight evil since

777
00:46:31.451 --> 00:46:35.650
the beginning of time,
whether it was ever going out to fight the lions

778
00:46:37.230 --> 00:46:40.110
or whether they were going out to fight some awards going to invade.

779
00:46:40.111 --> 00:46:43.860
Other countries are going to find treasure or whatever.
Whatever they were doing,

780
00:46:43.861 --> 00:46:44.551
people have been doing it.

781
00:46:44.551 --> 00:46:47.760
Even World War II guys left and there is no guarantee that they were coming
home.

782
00:46:47.761 --> 00:46:51.930
They left for two,
three,
four years
goes,

783
00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:55.130
that's the way it works.
There's your,

784
00:46:55.150 --> 00:46:59.190
your boys are not going to be,
they're not,

785
00:46:59.191 --> 00:47:02.160
their lives aren't going to be ruined if you're not there at every ballgame.

786
00:47:03.090 --> 00:47:05.910
And I'll tell you there's actually,
if you do that,

787
00:47:05.911 --> 00:47:10.911
your sons will learn the meaning of duty and sacrifice more than a normal kid

788
00:47:12.901 --> 00:47:17.580
would.
So,
so pay attention to that too.
Again,

789
00:47:17.790 --> 00:47:18.780
all that being said,

790
00:47:19.260 --> 00:47:23.130
this is something that only you can make the call on because you're,

791
00:47:23.220 --> 00:47:27.630
you can analyze the details of the situation and you know what if your wife

792
00:47:27.631 --> 00:47:30.160
works or where your wife works or dot wife doesn't work,
that makes a big deal.

793
00:47:30.940 --> 00:47:35.020
If your wife works and you're gone all the time,
that's a problem.

794
00:47:35.050 --> 00:47:38.470
Now who's raising your kids?
So you got to pay attention to that.
If you,

795
00:47:38.471 --> 00:47:41.470
if you both work but you both work normal jobs now you're home and you're doing

796
00:47:41.500 --> 00:47:45.700
your,
you know,
you're there enough.
So just weigh these things out.

797
00:47:45.730 --> 00:47:50.230
But I would,
I would get the details and then make a decision.

798
00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:52.840
And you know what,
no matter what decision you make,
it's the right decision.

799
00:47:52.841 --> 00:47:54.160
How's that?
That's pretty simple.

800
00:47:54.970 --> 00:47:57.310
If you make a decision and you're going to go on the tactical team,
cool.

801
00:47:57.670 --> 00:48:00.850
If you don't,
cool,
you're still doing federal law enforcement.
Awesome.

802
00:48:02.710 --> 00:48:04.690
Keeping the,
keeping the monsters at bay.

803
00:48:05.610 --> 00:48:07.280
<v 2>Hmm.
Yeah.</v>

804
00:48:07.281 --> 00:48:12.281
The thing that helped me a lot that you explained early on is to tell them why

805
00:48:13.161 --> 00:48:16.580
you tell people why you're doing what you're doing and thinking about the team

806
00:48:16.581 --> 00:48:19.490
and in this case,
the family or whatever.
In this specific case,

807
00:48:19.491 --> 00:48:23.900
probably your wife.
Yeah.
So if you're feeling that,

808
00:48:23.910 --> 00:48:26.420
because I did,
I did the,
the feeling of like,
oh,
I,

809
00:48:26.421 --> 00:48:30.110
I feel like I'm not being as loyal to my family because I'm like focusing on

810
00:48:30.111 --> 00:48:32.960
work kind of thing.
So I'll get that from time to time,
you know,

811
00:48:32.961 --> 00:48:34.820
especially if I'm like super focused and it's like,
Dang,

812
00:48:34.821 --> 00:48:37.570
I didn't even think about my kids or family all day today.
You know,

813
00:48:37.571 --> 00:48:39.410
I'll have that little phone,
whatever.
I'd take it.

814
00:48:40.070 --> 00:48:44.510
And I used to go like four months thinking about my family.
I'm such a horrible,

815
00:48:44.870 --> 00:48:47.540
well it's a sliding scale,
so,
you know,
um,

816
00:48:47.570 --> 00:48:52.570
but I do know that the more I communicate with my wife and be like,

817
00:48:53.001 --> 00:48:55.450
Hey,
I have to go here and I'm,
this is what I'm gonna,

818
00:48:55.470 --> 00:48:58.700
I'm gonna really try to focus on this,
you know,
this week,
you know,

819
00:48:59.290 --> 00:49:04.220
a video this week
and you know,

820
00:49:04.230 --> 00:49:05.620
I really busy.
Oh yeah,

821
00:49:05.660 --> 00:49:08.510
I'll be be so I might not be here for this and this and you know,

822
00:49:08.511 --> 00:49:13.400
like I might miss this,
you know,
and just lay it all out,
why you're doing it.

823
00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:14.870
You know,
how you always say,

824
00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:20.320
and a lot of the Times your loyalty will be demonstrating demonstrated with

825
00:49:21.021 --> 00:49:23.750
that.
You know,
like,
it's like,
Hey,
I'm doing my job.

826
00:49:23.751 --> 00:49:26.210
It's the time requirements are a little bit more,
or whatever.

827
00:49:26.360 --> 00:49:29.300
Like I want you to know,
like,
what can I,
can we do anything?

828
00:49:29.301 --> 00:49:31.270
Can we adjust anything to make it better for everybody?

829
00:49:31.990 --> 00:49:34.810
<v 0>You're 100% right.
And,
and actually to take that one step further,</v>

830
00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:37.990
including your wife into the decision making process where you're like,
Hey,

831
00:49:37.991 --> 00:49:41.280
listen hon this,
if I do this job,
it's going to be more,
but hey,

832
00:49:41.281 --> 00:49:44.950
it's going to be super rewarding to me.
And sometimes that's enough.
You know,

833
00:49:44.951 --> 00:49:45.551
you tell your wife,

834
00:49:45.551 --> 00:49:47.830
this is gonna be super rewarding for me because I'm going to be able to go and

835
00:49:47.831 --> 00:49:51.910
kill bad guys,
which is or protect innocent people,
which is what I want to do.

836
00:49:52.030 --> 00:49:53.990
That's what I signed up for it and I'm gonna be able to do it in a,

837
00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:57.280
in a more complete way.
And there's a chance your wife says,
you know what?

838
00:49:57.700 --> 00:50:00.370
I know that's what you're born to do.
Go do it.
Or she might say,
listen,

839
00:50:00.371 --> 00:50:04.400
you've done that already.
You know,
let's focus on the family and you.
Cool.
Yeah.

840
00:50:04.401 --> 00:50:07.270
Those are both good decisions.
We're in a win win situation here.

841
00:50:07.630 --> 00:50:08.470
That's the bottom line,
dude.

842
00:50:08.910 --> 00:50:12.300
<v 2>Yeah.
Next question,
Jocko.</v>

843
00:50:12.390 --> 00:50:14.910
I'm 19:00 AM I in my first year of college,

844
00:50:14.970 --> 00:50:19.260
ever since I was 12 of dreamed about being a marine or seal.

845
00:50:20.070 --> 00:50:24.240
I plan on joining up after college,
but I just got diagnosed with epilepsy.

846
00:50:24.540 --> 00:50:27.180
I only have seizures in my sleep,
so I never noticed.

847
00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:33.160
<v 0>I always thought of serving in the military as a way that I would prove to</v>

848
00:50:34.191 --> 00:50:38.330
myself that I was a man and that it would be given my life a purpose.

849
00:50:38.420 --> 00:50:39.800
Now I don't know what to do.

850
00:50:40.250 --> 00:50:44.360
I hate the idea of living some comfortable life where I have a cozy nine to five

851
00:50:44.361 --> 00:50:49.040
job that I only do for the money.
I want something hard and meaningful.

852
00:50:49.100 --> 00:50:53.870
What should I do?
There's an infinite number of options that you have,

853
00:50:53.930 --> 00:50:56.330
so you need to just pick one of those options,

854
00:50:56.331 --> 00:51:00.560
find a new career of that you think looks cool,

855
00:51:00.590 --> 00:51:03.500
and then go get after it and you gotta figure you want to,

856
00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:04.910
you don't want a nine to five job cold.

857
00:51:04.911 --> 00:51:07.100
There's all kinds of jobs that aren't nine to five.
You don't,

858
00:51:07.101 --> 00:51:11.210
whether it's construction management or construction or gas,

859
00:51:11.220 --> 00:51:15.110
oil or some kind of public safety,
there's all kinds of things.

860
00:51:15.110 --> 00:51:17.090
I don't know if you can be a firefighter on if you can be a cop,

861
00:51:17.091 --> 00:51:18.650
if you have epilepsy,
I'm not sure.

862
00:51:19.070 --> 00:51:24.070
But there's all kinds of different jobs and careers and there's jobs that are

863
00:51:25.881 --> 00:51:30.881
hard and there's jobs that are incredibly meaningful to our economy here.

864
00:51:32.690 --> 00:51:34.580
And the more you help our economy here,

865
00:51:34.581 --> 00:51:37.940
the more you help us have a positive influence in the world.

866
00:51:37.941 --> 00:51:42.941
So go and figure out what job that you want to do and go crush it and go,

867
00:51:44.660 --> 00:51:48.830
you don't build an empire and make a ton of money.
And then if you want to,

868
00:51:49.910 --> 00:51:53.540
great,
then you can support some veterans causes and you can give back that way.

869
00:51:54.470 --> 00:51:59.030
So,
so that's cool.
There's,
there's,
it's always impressive to me.

870
00:51:59.031 --> 00:52:02.660
We work with all kinds of different companies and national on front.

871
00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:08.320
It's always so impressive to me when I meet people from every possible industry

872
00:52:09.021 --> 00:52:14.021
that you can imagine and they're completely into their job.

873
00:52:14.660 --> 00:52:16.700
They are so into their job,

874
00:52:17.150 --> 00:52:21.230
they're fighting world war nine like there that into it.

875
00:52:21.770 --> 00:52:25.790
You know they're running intel,
the run an operation,
they're driving down.

876
00:52:25.791 --> 00:52:27.950
Every dollar matters,
everything that they're doing,

877
00:52:27.951 --> 00:52:31.670
they're so into it and it's awesome.
And this is everything.

878
00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:34.710
This is every different industry.
I see people like that.
No,

879
00:52:34.711 --> 00:52:36.800
not every person in every industry is like that.

880
00:52:37.670 --> 00:52:42.670
But if you find something that you're interested is in and you jump in there and

881
00:52:44.241 --> 00:52:49.241
that's going to be your vocation right now there's another part to this that is

882
00:52:52.310 --> 00:52:56.060
kind of I guess like in your head or whatever.

883
00:52:57.210 --> 00:52:59.180
That's like some kind of hard living that's not best,

884
00:52:59.181 --> 00:53:01.220
not very difficult to come up with,
right?

885
00:53:01.430 --> 00:53:04.880
Go Start Training Jiujitsu go start trading some box and go start wrestling.

886
00:53:04.910 --> 00:53:06.920
Go Do Moitai go start shooting,

887
00:53:07.250 --> 00:53:10.640
go start lifting and seeing how strong you can get and seeing how powerful you

888
00:53:10.641 --> 00:53:11.474
can get.

889
00:53:11.540 --> 00:53:16.160
Go learn to hunt and learn to hike and learn to play guitar and learn.

890
00:53:16.161 --> 00:53:18.230
Just learn a bunch of stuff.

891
00:53:19.340 --> 00:53:24.230
Become a force to be reckoned with.
And

892
00:53:25.860 --> 00:53:26.280
you know,

893
00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:31.260
the bottom line is being a seal or being in marine does not prove that you are a

894
00:53:31.261 --> 00:53:32.094
man.

895
00:53:32.820 --> 00:53:37.820
There are plenty of losers in both of those organizations and so don't,

896
00:53:40.780 --> 00:53:44.880
you don't need some label to make you a man.
That's not what makes you a man.

897
00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:50.220
Be Your own man.
Go out and conquer your part of the world.

898
00:53:55.110 --> 00:53:59.460
Next question.
Two questions.

899
00:53:59.880 --> 00:54:04.170
I recently attended an assessment for retraining.
Let's say one more thing.

900
00:54:04.980 --> 00:54:09.420
Sorry.
Nah Man.
When things like this happen,
like when something happens to me,

901
00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:12.990
well this is,
you want to hear my weird superstitious um,

902
00:54:13.860 --> 00:54:17.430
view of the world.
Sure.
It's sort of,

903
00:54:17.490 --> 00:54:21.960
it's sort of reminiscent of everything happens for a reason.
You've heard that.

904
00:54:21.961 --> 00:54:25.560
Everyone's heard that for me,
something like this,

905
00:54:25.980 --> 00:54:27.300
when something like this happens to me,

906
00:54:27.301 --> 00:54:31.410
when something happens in my life that I didn't want to have happen where I

907
00:54:31.411 --> 00:54:34.440
didn't expect to happen,
I get an unpleasant surprise.

908
00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:38.910
I look at it and assess it like,
okay,
this is,

909
00:54:39.750 --> 00:54:41.970
this is happening.
So that's something else.

910
00:54:41.971 --> 00:54:45.540
This is trying to prevent something else from happening to me that I would have

911
00:54:45.541 --> 00:54:50.070
been really catastrophic.
I hurt my knee the other day doing Jujitsu.
Sure.
Doing,

912
00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:55.220
doing wrestling and I am on my way driving home.

913
00:54:56.250 --> 00:54:57.120
I'm like,
you know what?

914
00:54:57.510 --> 00:55:02.510
This is preventing me from wrecking my shoulder in two weeks or the next night I

915
00:55:06.031 --> 00:55:08.100
was probably going to wreck my shoulder,
which is,

916
00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:11.760
which is no a catastrophic injury in my shoulder.

917
00:55:11.970 --> 00:55:16.970
That's what was about to happen to me and the powers that be knew.

918
00:55:18.840 --> 00:55:23.730
The only way to get me off the mat was to hurt my knee bad enough that it pulled

919
00:55:23.731 --> 00:55:28.110
me off the mat for for a couple of weeks.
So boom.
There you go.
Here you go,
Jocko.

920
00:55:28.290 --> 00:55:30.570
You're welcome.
Yeah,
so something like this,

921
00:55:31.080 --> 00:55:33.330
this is an indicator far as I'm concerned,

922
00:55:33.720 --> 00:55:37.560
you have some bigger and better thing that you need to do some,
hey,

923
00:55:37.710 --> 00:55:42.090
it wasn't this.
It's cool except it like right on.
Say thank you.
Yeah,

924
00:55:42.420 --> 00:55:46.260
because there's people that they,
they,
it's not epilepsy that they have.

925
00:55:46.261 --> 00:55:50.070
They have something that debilitates them from doing even things that you are

926
00:55:50.071 --> 00:55:50.820
capable of doing.

927
00:55:50.820 --> 00:55:55.820
So be stoked that this delivery came from wherever it comes from.

928
00:55:57.270 --> 00:55:59.490
Whatever it is that you believe in,

929
00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:04.860
that this dis dis God,
this happened because it's,

930
00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:07.290
it's putting you on the path.
I guess that's what I'm saying.

931
00:56:07.560 --> 00:56:11.160
Putting you on the path.
So who knows what you're supposed to do,

932
00:56:11.460 --> 00:56:14.250
but you're supposed to do something cause you're not supposed to be a seal.

933
00:56:14.670 --> 00:56:17.800
You're not supposed to be a marine.
If you were supposed to be that,

934
00:56:17.801 --> 00:56:19.920
that would have happened.
It didn't happen.
That's not a bad thing.

935
00:56:19.921 --> 00:56:23.440
That means there's some other door's going to open up big.
Yeah.

936
00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:26.870
<v 2>So that's the way I live.
I always look at injuries like that.</v>

937
00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:30.310
Positive way I can look at injuries is,
hey,

938
00:56:30.790 --> 00:56:35.790
I was going to whatever I was going to like,

939
00:56:36.070 --> 00:56:40.540
I was going to rip apart triple threat on my knee in four days.

940
00:56:40.930 --> 00:56:44.600
So I just got a little ding to pull me off the mat.
So that doesn't happen.
Yeah.

941
00:56:45.250 --> 00:56:49.270
Oh I needed rest.
Here's what you get.
Boom,

942
00:56:49.630 --> 00:56:52.610
you're going to get this.
Yeah,
I'll have those thoughts do some,

943
00:56:52.940 --> 00:56:54.070
like it's Kinda like,
oh,

944
00:56:54.071 --> 00:56:57.520
I'm safe from injury because I'm already injured kind of thing.
Yeah.
There we go.

945
00:56:57.670 --> 00:57:01.090
It's a weird feeling.
Yeah.
But that is true.
And Yeah.

946
00:57:01.091 --> 00:57:04.390
And kind of like a lot of times,
and this is so good that the,
that guy,

947
00:57:04.391 --> 00:57:09.090
this guy is,
he knows already I want to do something harder than meaningful brow.

948
00:57:09.150 --> 00:57:13.300
I have men.
How did he say?
Old Depots 1919 man.

949
00:57:13.320 --> 00:57:16.900
1990 and him,
yeah.
He's all right.
He's already on the path.

950
00:57:17.010 --> 00:57:19.570
He's totally on the path and you know,

951
00:57:19.571 --> 00:57:22.780
he's just discovering what doors he wants to,
you know,
what doors are open,

952
00:57:22.781 --> 00:57:26.080
what windows are closed,
whatever,
you know.
And he's discovered man,
one his 19.

953
00:57:26.500 --> 00:57:30.820
Yeah.
I didn't have no direction.
Did,
uh,
did I ever have the thought of,
Hey,
yeah,

954
00:57:30.821 --> 00:57:35.590
I want to do something hard and meaningful.
Did I ever have that thought?
Hmm.
No,

955
00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:40.060
I did not have that thought ever.
Um,
lifting weights or something like this,

956
00:57:40.061 --> 00:57:43.480
but yeah,
man,
that's good.
So yeah,
I think he's ahead of the game being on time.

957
00:57:43.930 --> 00:57:46.570
Yeah.
There's no,
there's no label that makes you a man.

958
00:57:46.660 --> 00:57:51.550
You do your check and you're doing a good job so far,
evidently.
All right,

959
00:57:51.551 --> 00:57:52.720
next question.
Two questions.

960
00:57:53.050 --> 00:57:57.880
I recently attended assessment for retraining into the combat control career

961
00:57:57.881 --> 00:57:58.714
field.

962
00:57:58.840 --> 00:58:03.160
I'm active duty for air force in a different career field and rang the bell

963
00:58:04.540 --> 00:58:06.070
during water confidence training.

964
00:58:06.310 --> 00:58:09.010
How do I live with my decision and move forward?
Yeah,

965
00:58:09.080 --> 00:58:10.210
and first you see there's two.

966
00:58:10.270 --> 00:58:12.330
There's two questions that are basically the same question.

967
00:58:12.331 --> 00:58:15.880
So that was part a and this is part B.
I do read.

968
00:58:15.920 --> 00:58:20.860
Do you ARD deal hard.
Okay.
Drop on request.
Gotcha.
Rang the bell.
Same thing.

969
00:58:21.640 --> 00:58:24.580
Ideal card from buds.
Class three Oh three I went,

970
00:58:24.820 --> 00:58:28.360
went on to be a s a r core corpsmen.

971
00:58:28.361 --> 00:58:31.900
Star swimmer starts when requirements,
so he was okay.
He was a rescue swimmer.

972
00:58:32.170 --> 00:58:33.350
Okay,
but it's tea,

973
00:58:33.430 --> 00:58:38.430
but it's taken until recently to regain the desire to live and even strive to

974
00:58:38.801 --> 00:58:39.634
work out again.

975
00:58:40.660 --> 00:58:45.660
What can you do when you realize a life path you've chosen was not only wrong,

976
00:58:45.850 --> 00:58:50.350
but you never feel like you found a new path.
To me,
this,

977
00:58:50.380 --> 00:58:53.440
this question to both these questions are kind of similar to the previous one,

978
00:58:53.470 --> 00:58:56.170
right?
And I can tell you,
being a,

979
00:58:56.260 --> 00:58:59.950
being a seal or being a combat controller is not the be all end all.

980
00:59:00.430 --> 00:59:05.380
And the bottom line is it wasn't for you.
It wasn't free.
It wasn't even either.

981
00:59:05.381 --> 00:59:09.640
One of you guys just wasn't for you.
And the fact that matter is,

982
00:59:09.641 --> 00:59:13.990
it's not for most people.
It's not normal.
There's an 80% attrition rate of butts.

983
00:59:14.440 --> 00:59:16.300
Most people quit.
Good people.

984
00:59:16.690 --> 00:59:21.010
I was down there the other day and I was talking to one of my buddies that runs,

985
00:59:21.260 --> 00:59:22.340
runs,
it,
runs

986
00:59:22.340 --> 00:59:25.460
<v 0>the,
he's a civilian reason.
One of the civilians that works there,
but he was,</v>

987
00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:30.320
we were talking about,
you know what it was about butts,

988
00:59:30.980 --> 00:59:34.040
and I forget what even led into it,
but he pointed at the,
you know,
when you,

989
00:59:34.070 --> 00:59:35.720
when you quit bloods,
you put your helmet by the bell.

990
00:59:36.470 --> 00:59:38.840
And so as more and more people quit,

991
00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:44.300
more and more helmets are on up and there'll be hundreds of helmets lined up and

992
00:59:44.840 --> 00:59:47.660
he's like,
you see those helmets right there?
And I'm like,
yeah.
He goes,

993
00:59:47.930 --> 00:59:50.870
every single one of those kids was a stud

994
00:59:52.430 --> 00:59:56.450
and when I went through it wasn't quite like that because not everyone knows.

995
00:59:56.451 --> 01:00:01.100
Showing up at buds in the 90s
was a stud.

996
01:00:01.890 --> 01:00:05.870
The they weren't because we didn't know what was happening.
We didn't know.

997
01:00:06.620 --> 01:00:09.530
We didn't know how to do a pullup workout.

998
01:00:09.830 --> 01:00:14.830
We couldn't look online and see a program on how to get better at rope climbs.

999
01:00:17.690 --> 01:00:21.740
We didn't know that you had to swim with fins.
We didn't know.

1000
01:00:22.070 --> 01:00:25.250
I didn't know why I didn't do anything when I showed up to buds.

1001
01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:30.020
So these kids now they know everything and so what do they do?

1002
01:00:30.050 --> 01:00:32.300
They prepare all of them at a minimum.

1003
01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:37.600
I would say the minimum guy prepared now is probably prepared at least as good

1004
01:00:37.641 --> 01:00:41.120
as the most prepared guy.
Actually.
That's probably,
that's probably inaccurate.

1005
01:00:41.660 --> 01:00:43.040
I bet you the minimum,

1006
01:00:43.110 --> 01:00:47.840
the least prepared guy entering buds right now is probably still more prepared

1007
01:00:47.841 --> 01:00:51.890
than the most prepared guy that went to buds when I went through now.

1008
01:00:53.030 --> 01:00:53.331
So,

1009
01:00:53.331 --> 01:00:58.331
so my point in saying that is most of those people that are studs quit,

1010
01:00:59.570 --> 01:01:01.820
most of those people that join the navy,

1011
01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:07.070
that signed on a dotted line and commit six years of their life because there's

1012
01:01:07.071 --> 01:01:09.290
nothing more they want to do than be a seal.

1013
01:01:10.250 --> 01:01:14.630
And most of them don't make it through.
So it's not for everyone.

1014
01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:19.880
And then you know what?
You one guy in the air force,
one guy in the navy,

1015
01:01:19.881 --> 01:01:21.890
you did your job,
you do what you're supposed to do,
a corpsman,

1016
01:01:21.891 --> 01:01:24.950
whatever your normal career field was in the air force and you served your

1017
01:01:24.951 --> 01:01:28.760
country and you did what the country needed you to do.

1018
01:01:29.180 --> 01:01:31.730
The country needs you to do whatever job you did.

1019
01:01:31.731 --> 01:01:35.300
The country needed you to do that job.
So thank you for your service.

1020
01:01:35.630 --> 01:01:38.540
And now you go and find something else.
You go and find a new mission

1021
01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:42.600
and the same things here,
like you,

1022
01:01:42.650 --> 01:01:46.880
you want to get better with your life.
So what do you do?

1023
01:01:46.910 --> 01:01:50.780
You work and you build and you study and you get an awesome physical condition

1024
01:01:50.781 --> 01:01:54.290
and you trained Jujitsu and you become a doctor or a firefighter,
EMT,

1025
01:01:54.291 --> 01:01:57.920
you're a cop.
And there's whichever way that you figure out that you can serve,

1026
01:01:57.921 --> 01:02:00.740
you become a business person.
You go and work,
construction,

1027
01:02:00.741 --> 01:02:03.530
whatever it is that you do,
you'd go and do it.

1028
01:02:03.650 --> 01:02:06.410
You do it hard and you don't get caught up in a title.
Right?

1029
01:02:08.030 --> 01:02:11.150
So this is another thing that's kind of reflects back to what we were talking

1030
01:02:11.151 --> 01:02:15.200
about earlier.
Seals don't care that you weren't a seal.

1031
01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:19.590
You know,
like it's not like seals are walking around,
oh,

1032
01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:23.250
this person wasn't a seal.
I don't respect him.
This person wasn't a single,

1033
01:02:23.251 --> 01:02:28.170
I don't respect him.
We don't care.
It's a vocation.
It's a job.
So you're not,

1034
01:02:28.260 --> 01:02:30.930
I don't look down on people that weren't seals.

1035
01:02:31.710 --> 01:02:35.550
It's just that was my job.
You had a different job,
right?

1036
01:02:36.570 --> 01:02:38.020
It's like,
it's like Jujitsu.

1037
01:02:38.070 --> 01:02:43.040
I don't look down on people that don't train Jujitsu.
I look at him like,

1038
01:02:43.041 --> 01:02:45.890
Hey,
you should,
because that's a choice,

1039
01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:48.590
but let me rephrase that.

1040
01:02:48.650 --> 01:02:52.250
I don't look down on people that I can beat in Jujitsu because I know for a fact

1041
01:02:52.251 --> 01:02:55.760
all it is is that I've been training longer than them and once they train longer

1042
01:02:55.761 --> 01:02:57.680
than me,
there'll be able to beat me.
That's the way it works.

1043
01:02:58.850 --> 01:03:03.770
So people that were in the seal teams aren't looking down on you because you

1044
01:03:03.771 --> 01:03:06.020
weren't,
they don't care.
I don't know.
Thinking about it.

1045
01:03:07.130 --> 01:03:11.750
So when I meet a cop,
when I meet a firefighter,
when I meet a business person,

1046
01:03:11.990 --> 01:03:15.530
I respect what they're doing with their life.
If they're getting after it,

1047
01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:17.840
I don't care what arena it's in,
man.
I know some,

1048
01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:21.050
I'm so lucky right now working at national on front,

1049
01:03:21.051 --> 01:03:26.051
we meet people that are just just awesome humans that are crushing their field.

1050
01:03:27.020 --> 01:03:29.090
And if they were in the seal teams,
they'd be crushing that field.

1051
01:03:29.091 --> 01:03:32.000
But they didn't.
They went to,
they went and did what they did.

1052
01:03:32.810 --> 01:03:35.210
They went in the finance world.
They went in the construction world,

1053
01:03:35.211 --> 01:03:37.400
they went in the gas,
oil business.
Whatever they did,
they did.

1054
01:03:37.401 --> 01:03:41.480
And they're getting after it.
So that's what you need to do.

1055
01:03:42.170 --> 01:03:46.700
You quit in the past,
you rang the bell.
No one cares

1056
01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:52.200
unless you quit now.
So get up,

1057
01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:57.150
go find a new mission and get after it,
man.
Get after it.

1058
01:03:59.430 --> 01:04:00.263
Next question.

1059
01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:06.770
You've been unfairly wronged by a brother objectively,

1060
01:04:08.180 --> 01:04:10.870
you aren't getting the full apology that you expect it.

1061
01:04:11.330 --> 01:04:13.940
The beef is over now and he treats you well.

1062
01:04:13.970 --> 01:04:18.800
But how do you psychologically reframe and kill that lingering resentment?

1063
01:04:20.870 --> 01:04:23.420
Unfairly wronged by a brother.

1064
01:04:24.050 --> 01:04:28.400
Interesting brothers.
Don't wrong brothers.
We'll start with that.

1065
01:04:28.401 --> 01:04:32.070
So this dude wasn't actually abro.
A brother might've been a bro,

1066
01:04:32.071 --> 01:04:33.080
but he wasn't a brother.

1067
01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:36.800
Make little distinction there is that distinction ever been made before?

1068
01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:41.150
I don't think on this platform and they've been making it cool.
There was like,

1069
01:04:41.151 --> 01:04:44.570
Hey,
this guy's my bro,
it's all good.
And then there's like,
this guy's my brother.

1070
01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:48.680
My brother is not going to wrong me.
My Bro might,

1071
01:04:49.730 --> 01:04:54.210
but my brother's not going to wrong me so that he,

1072
01:04:54.310 --> 01:04:57.440
so if it happens and some guy,
like I said,

1073
01:04:57.441 --> 01:05:00.890
if somebody that you consider your brother wrongs you,
then they'd clearly you,

1074
01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:06.180
you overestimated their
commitment.

1075
01:05:07.460 --> 01:05:11.270
So here's what's gonna happen with me.
Number one,
it's noted,
noted.

1076
01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:14.120
That's my,
that's my ultimate,

1077
01:05:15.380 --> 01:05:19.720
that's my ultimate satisfaction.
Right.

1078
01:05:19.930 --> 01:05:23.170
When I know when it's,
when I note something,
yeah.
Oh,
it's like,

1079
01:05:23.171 --> 01:05:27.440
oh this is the kind of person he is noted.
Now I got him.
Yeah.

1080
01:05:27.550 --> 01:05:29.140
Now I got this person marked.

1081
01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:34.660
So trust is not going to be reestablished for a long,
long time,

1082
01:05:34.661 --> 01:05:36.940
if ever.
Right.

1083
01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:41.410
I'm not going to like this person clearly,

1084
01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:44.380
but here's the deal.

1085
01:05:44.380 --> 01:05:49.380
All that mistrust and all that dislike and all that is going to be internal,

1086
01:05:50.520 --> 01:05:54.640
but we'll keep it inside
because you know what?

1087
01:05:54.730 --> 01:05:56.770
I'm going to have those inside them and harbor that.

1088
01:05:56.830 --> 01:05:59.350
I'm going to harbor those things.
Even this resentment,

1089
01:05:59.351 --> 01:06:02.560
I'm going to harbor it cause I can't,
I can't just make it go away.
You,
ew,

1090
01:06:02.830 --> 01:06:06.700
you wronged me.
It's going to be there.
Yeah.
But you know what?

1091
01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:10.930
I'm a professional externally,
I'm a professional.

1092
01:06:11.620 --> 01:06:14.620
Even if we're not in business or even if you're just like,
Hey,
I trained you,

1093
01:06:14.621 --> 01:06:16.900
just do it.
This guy,
right?
I'm a professional,

1094
01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:22.800
so I'm not going to let his little maneuvers get me externally worked up about

1095
01:06:23.981 --> 01:06:27.500
it.
It's not happening.
You don't get control of my emotions like that.
Externally,

1096
01:06:27.510 --> 01:06:30.340
you might control them inside,
but I won't let you see that ever.

1097
01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:34.150
So I'm a professional.
I'm normal face.

1098
01:06:34.180 --> 01:06:37.330
That's where I'm coming at you from just normal face.
Hey,
all good.
Oh yeah.

1099
01:06:38.950 --> 01:06:41.680
And you know what's interesting?
This behavior.

1100
01:06:41.710 --> 01:06:46.480
So when you screw me over and then I just go,
okay,
check,
noted.

1101
01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:52.440
And then I don't give you a reason to like hate me and then you kind of owe me.

1102
01:06:55.170 --> 01:06:59.440
Yeah.
You know what I mean?
You're going to owe me.
So there's that and there's a,

1103
01:06:59.470 --> 01:07:00.400
there's a fine line.

1104
01:07:00.401 --> 01:07:04.390
Like if you screw me over and then I just allow it to happen and it was a,

1105
01:07:04.690 --> 01:07:08.320
it was a,
uh,
a legitimate violation,

1106
01:07:08.410 --> 01:07:10.680
well then there might be have to be repercussions,
right?
Yeah.

1107
01:07:10.930 --> 01:07:15.730
It sounds like this did not warrant repercussions because you know there's

1108
01:07:15.731 --> 01:07:20.290
certain situations if somebody wrongs you in certain ways,

1109
01:07:20.530 --> 01:07:22.840
there has to be repercussions.
To me.

1110
01:07:22.870 --> 01:07:26.950
Normally most of the time the repercussions and the best revenge that you can

1111
01:07:26.951 --> 01:07:27.580
take is,

1112
01:07:27.580 --> 01:07:31.720
is to ignore now perform and be successful in rock on and forget about them and

1113
01:07:32.530 --> 01:07:33.580
forget they even existed.

1114
01:07:33.700 --> 01:07:37.870
That to me is the best possible way to go because why would you let somebody

1115
01:07:37.980 --> 01:07:41.500
interfere?
Why would you commit any time,
effort,

1116
01:07:41.501 --> 01:07:45.130
resources to revenge when I would,

1117
01:07:45.131 --> 01:07:48.730
the better thing to do is commit those time,
resources,
energy to success,

1118
01:07:48.731 --> 01:07:51.010
to winning.
Yeah,
I'm going to do that.

1119
01:07:51.940 --> 01:07:54.730
But if this merits some sort of repercussions,
okay,

1120
01:07:54.731 --> 01:07:58.090
then those get carried out and if those get carried out,

1121
01:07:58.270 --> 01:08:00.970
well then we're,
we're,
we're kind of settled.

1122
01:08:00.971 --> 01:08:05.360
But he says you didn't get the full apology.
You expect it to,
okay.

1123
01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:09.910
Hey,
guess what?
People are arrogant.
Yeah.
That's the way it is.

1124
01:08:10.060 --> 01:08:12.250
They don't think the guy didn't even think he did anything wrong.

1125
01:08:12.251 --> 01:08:14.950
Most likely he's not even apologizing for it.
Barely.

1126
01:08:16.250 --> 01:08:21.130
So that's what I do.
I'm just going to keep it professional.
I'm going to,

1127
01:08:21.470 --> 01:08:25.310
you're going to be subconsciously indebted to me whether you know it or not.

1128
01:08:25.660 --> 01:08:27.950
Yeah,
you probably know it.

1129
01:08:27.951 --> 01:08:31.040
You'll probably feel it cause I'm just going to be like,
okay,
cool.
Yeah,

1130
01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:35.290
we'll move on.
But man,
you know,
the thing is,
this is,

1131
01:08:35.300 --> 01:08:37.760
this sort of goes back to that other kind of topic today.

1132
01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:40.040
Like this guy isn't going around thinking about you,

1133
01:08:40.790 --> 01:08:45.020
so why are you thinking about him?
Let's move on man,
let's move forward.

1134
01:08:45.970 --> 01:08:49.630
And that seems like a big part of it,
right?
Like that seems like he was you.

1135
01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:53.960
He says you aren't,
you aren't getting the full apology.
You know,

1136
01:08:53.990 --> 01:08:57.290
like I remember on that Seinfeld,
that apology dude,
I was talking to someone,

1137
01:08:58.610 --> 01:09:01.190
I was talking to someone like a blanket apology and I was talking to someone

1138
01:09:01.191 --> 01:09:06.191
that we both know who's we'll say up a public figure.

1139
01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:08.593
Sure.

1140
01:09:08.870 --> 01:09:13.870
And this individual was reading youtube comments and getting legitimately like

1141
01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:20.320
emotionally distraught about the whole night.
Yeah.

1142
01:09:21.380 --> 01:09:25.880
And was trying to talk to me about it.
And like I said,
man,

1143
01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:30.170
I literally do not care.
I'm like,

1144
01:09:30.171 --> 01:09:34.220
I do not care.
Like this is no factor.
You don't need to warn me.

1145
01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:39.160
You don't need to tell me.
You know what I need to look out for.

1146
01:09:39.190 --> 01:09:41.390
Like I literally don't care.
I mean,

1147
01:09:41.391 --> 01:09:45.020
if someone writes a good youtube comment of good,
it's funny.
That's great.

1148
01:09:45.220 --> 01:09:49.950
If they write an amine one,
cool.
I find that those are funny too.
I'm not,

1149
01:09:50.180 --> 01:09:52.970
I'm not worried about the person that wrote the youtube comment isn't thinking

1150
01:09:52.971 --> 01:09:57.620
about me.
You know,
they're not dry.
They're not,
they're not reviewing it again,

1151
01:09:58.110 --> 01:10:00.920
writing it again and you know,
like they don't care.

1152
01:10:01.340 --> 01:10:02.810
I'm not getting all caught up in this stuff.

1153
01:10:02.811 --> 01:10:05.000
Don't get caught up in these petty things.
You know,
I did that.

1154
01:10:05.660 --> 01:10:10.520
We talked about this on the podcast of,
of,
of the black belt.

1155
01:10:10.521 --> 01:10:12.770
The black belt doesn't care about things that don't matter.

1156
01:10:13.100 --> 01:10:14.900
You can grab the black belts.

1157
01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:19.070
Shoulder Eve is g and he doesn't care because he knows that doesn't mean

1158
01:10:19.071 --> 01:10:22.930
anything.
There's no,
there's no,
there's no factor.
So you want to,
that's,

1159
01:10:22.931 --> 01:10:23.930
that's what you want to do.
You want to,

1160
01:10:23.931 --> 01:10:25.610
you don't want to care about things that don't matter.

1161
01:10:25.800 --> 01:10:28.670
You don't invest your time and energy.
Things don't matter.
The guy wronged you.

1162
01:10:28.671 --> 01:10:33.080
Cool.
Noted.
You know that he's kind of a kind of,
uh,
uh,
a devious dude.

1163
01:10:33.170 --> 01:10:35.990
You know that it's noted.
Cool.
Move on.
No,
I'm not worried about it.

1164
01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:37.610
Am I going to put my trust in him again?
Nope,

1165
01:10:37.850 --> 01:10:39.980
but that's cool cause I know other people to trust.
Yeah.

1166
01:10:40.660 --> 01:10:44.090
Let's not get wrapped around these little things,
man.
Let's,
let's,
let's,
let's,

1167
01:10:44.210 --> 01:10:47.660
let's,
let's rise above and get some black flag going here.
Let's rise above.

1168
01:10:47.900 --> 01:10:51.680
I still wonder what kind of apology.
I totally cut you off.
So sorry about that.

1169
01:10:51.681 --> 01:10:53.780
Yeah,
no,
it was a Seinfeld thing.
It didn't matter the,

1170
01:10:54.350 --> 01:10:57.830
I'm wondering why at the same time what you're saying.
I agree.

1171
01:10:58.550 --> 01:11:01.970
But I do wonder what kind of apology he got.
You know,

1172
01:11:01.971 --> 01:11:05.510
cause he didn't get the full apology.
Yeah.
Partial yet.
So,
well,

1173
01:11:05.511 --> 01:11:07.430
partial apology that can come in many forms.

1174
01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:11.480
It's probably the most common form of a partial apology.
Has a button on it.
Yeah.

1175
01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:14.030
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

1176
01:11:14.030 --> 01:11:15.840
<v 2>We need swing by and pick the other than the up the other night.</v>

1177
01:11:15.841 --> 01:11:20.310
But I just didn't even know that you wanted to come.
Yeah,
it was my fault.

1178
01:11:20.311 --> 01:11:23.100
I'm sorry.
But yeah,
it was partially your fault kind of thing.

1179
01:11:23.310 --> 01:11:27.480
And then there's the other one that's like,
I'm sorry you felt that way,
you know?

1180
01:11:27.510 --> 01:11:29.720
You know that one.
Where's the cat?
I'm sorry you felt that,

1181
01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:32.250
that I was attacking you.
You know?
But you know,

1182
01:11:32.251 --> 01:11:36.510
I didn't mean to kind of thing where it's kind of like,
hey,
you're,

1183
01:11:36.660 --> 01:11:39.960
because the prison doesn't want an apology for necessarily the actual words you

1184
01:11:39.961 --> 01:11:42.330
said it was.
It was like what you did.

1185
01:11:42.780 --> 01:11:45.870
Like you attacked me with whatever you said,
you know,
kind of thing.

1186
01:11:45.871 --> 01:11:50.260
So you can't just say,
hey,
I can't,
I'm sorry.
You forgot.
That's right.
Sorry.

1187
01:11:50.310 --> 01:11:54.690
I'm sorry that you felt that way.
You know,
that is a pretty backhanded sort of,

1188
01:11:55.460 --> 01:12:00.240
yeah,
same thing,
but the but the one you say,
but I'm sorry,
but you know,

1189
01:12:00.241 --> 01:12:03.630
I didn't know that's kind of like,
I'm sorry but I'm not fully so yeah,

1190
01:12:03.631 --> 01:12:06.840
that's the same.
It's the same with extreme ownership.
Yes.
Some people saying,

1191
01:12:07.830 --> 01:12:10.950
you know,
look,
I'm in charge of the team and this was definitely,

1192
01:12:10.951 --> 01:12:13.740
I'm in charge of team when I'm in charge.
Then when things go wrong,

1193
01:12:13.741 --> 01:12:17.220
it's my fault.
But I'll tell you what,

1194
01:12:18.450 --> 01:12:22.620
as soon as I get that,
I'm always thinking,
I was saying about,
sorry,
sorry.
Yeah.

1195
01:12:22.621 --> 01:12:26.970
And my wife from time to time,
there are no excuses.
Yeah.

1196
01:12:26.971 --> 01:12:30.870
There's maybe think about it when you get somebody that actually believes in

1197
01:12:30.871 --> 01:12:34.830
extreme ownership.
There is,
there are no buts on anything that they say.

1198
01:12:34.860 --> 01:12:38.490
And strange living kind of I guess coincident,
not coincident.

1199
01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:41.580
I ran a nine year old daughter who will not allow you to make an excuse.

1200
01:12:42.110 --> 01:12:43.310
They're old daughter.
Yeah.

1201
01:12:43.410 --> 01:12:48.090
She will call you out if you throw a button or you say,
well,

1202
01:12:48.630 --> 01:12:52.500
I didn't know when we had to be there.
Oh.
So you're not taking ownership.

1203
01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:57.450
Yes.
Much.
And make,
yeah,
totally makes sense.
And if you,

1204
01:12:57.500 --> 01:13:00.870
it's strangely like if you do it without the,
but you know,
when you do it,

1205
01:13:00.871 --> 01:13:03.720
just full speed,
even if in your head you believe,
but you know what I mean.

1206
01:13:03.721 --> 01:13:06.720
Let's face it,
man.
You had to come into you kind of thing.
Yeah.
Just keep it,

1207
01:13:06.870 --> 01:13:09.240
because that's not what you're doing when you apologize.
That's,

1208
01:13:09.250 --> 01:13:13.440
that's separate from the apology.
You know,
it's like you're including this stuff,

1209
01:13:13.470 --> 01:13:16.620
unwarranted stuff with your apology.
You don't do that.
Give a good apology.

1210
01:13:16.710 --> 01:13:18.570
[inaudible] is the worst thing is,

1211
01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:22.820
is it's so obvious and it makes everyone so mad.
Oh yeah.

1212
01:13:22.890 --> 01:13:26.520
The receiving end of that is so mad.
Right.
And you think that it's,

1213
01:13:26.521 --> 01:13:29.460
you think that it's improving your position.
Yeah.
You're explaining,
look,

1214
01:13:29.940 --> 01:13:33.230
look a echo.
I'm really sorry that you showed up to record and,

1215
01:13:33.231 --> 01:13:37.220
and I wasn't there and I didn't let you know,
but yeah.

1216
01:13:37.740 --> 01:13:41.370
But I didn't really,
I didn't remember texting you or whatever,
like,
like,

1217
01:13:41.730 --> 01:13:43.260
but you know,
you should have told me that you were heading.

1218
01:13:43.261 --> 01:13:44.120
That's so that's what I worry about.

1219
01:13:44.220 --> 01:13:46.590
But you should have told me that we were definitely recording cause you didn't

1220
01:13:46.591 --> 01:13:50.340
really get back to me.
Yeah.
Like why would I say that?
Yeah.
All's I'm doing is,

1221
01:13:50.580 --> 01:13:53.340
you know what's funny is people always tweet me when a sports coach,

1222
01:13:53.970 --> 01:13:58.970
they tweet me when a sports coach either takes ownership or doesn't overtly,

1223
01:14:00.271 --> 01:14:03.360
it's not overtly because some guys,
some sports coaches say,
hey look,

1224
01:14:03.361 --> 01:14:05.760
I'm the coach.
I made some bad calls out there.

1225
01:14:05.880 --> 01:14:08.070
We're going to get back in the drawing room.
I'm going to get this thing fixed.

1226
01:14:08.130 --> 01:14:10.440
And if it goes,
man,
this guy's awesome.
And it's just so funny.

1227
01:14:10.441 --> 01:14:14.220
Everyone says this guy is awesome.
He's taking ownership.
Yeah.

1228
01:14:14.470 --> 01:14:18.310
Even people that aren't even people will retweet something that people aren't

1229
01:14:18.311 --> 01:14:21.430
saying.
He's taking extreme ownership.
Someone will say,

1230
01:14:21.460 --> 01:14:24.010
oh it's good to see a coach taking full responsibility or whatever.

1231
01:14:24.011 --> 01:14:26.920
They'll tell you,
use your own word for it.
Right.
And then some other knucklehead,

1232
01:14:28.520 --> 01:14:31.240
we'll,
we'll say you who I am,

1233
01:14:31.241 --> 01:14:33.670
I am the coach and I am responsible for the team.

1234
01:14:33.671 --> 01:14:36.340
But if I got players that aren't going to put out there in the first quarter,

1235
01:14:37.210 --> 01:14:38.820
I'm not the one on the field.
You know,
you,

1236
01:14:38.830 --> 01:14:42.280
you got to carry out this totally embarrassing for,
and everyone says,
hey,

1237
01:14:42.281 --> 01:14:46.350
you might want to learn how to take ownership.
And that's where people,

1238
01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:49.610
so it's so obvious and yet we still do it.

1239
01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:54.310
It may still throw out the butts.
We still want to clarify our position.

1240
01:14:54.820 --> 01:14:59.470
Yeah,
don't clarify your position.
Say sorry.
Take ownership.
That's it.

1241
01:14:59.650 --> 01:15:04.570
My wife will watch these.
Uh,
what do you call it?
The housewives one.
Not The show.

1242
01:15:04.630 --> 01:15:06.340
Like the reality show ones,
you know,

1243
01:15:06.341 --> 01:15:10.570
the whatever housewives of wear and men riddled.

1244
01:15:10.630 --> 01:15:13.180
I think that's why she watches it.
Just to see the train wreck.

1245
01:15:13.181 --> 01:15:16.900
I think that's what I think this is like the suspicion.
But men.
Yeah,
they,

1246
01:15:16.901 --> 01:15:20.020
they're all arguing with each other and then w you know,

1247
01:15:20.050 --> 01:15:23.260
they're crying and then one will say,
they'll just,

1248
01:15:23.590 --> 01:15:26.800
they'll say the perfect example of the non-apology,
you know,

1249
01:15:26.890 --> 01:15:29.950
every single time man,
it's like,
it hurts your heart to watch,

1250
01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:33.450
but you kind of like,
he kind of did it.
I wonder,

1251
01:15:33.790 --> 01:15:37.390
I wonder if this,
cause this is what happened with this guy.
Just,

1252
01:15:37.391 --> 01:15:39.310
I just figured it out right now.
I really don't know.

1253
01:15:39.311 --> 01:15:42.700
But this is what I think happened.
Okay.
We're going to be theoretical scenario.

1254
01:15:42.860 --> 01:15:46.450
Every single girl by relationship,
there was a what?
A girl guy relationship,

1255
01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:50.830
you know,
boyfriend,
girlfriend scenario.
You know,
maybe this guy got drunk,

1256
01:15:51.310 --> 01:15:55.930
the bro,
the brother Bro,
whatever that drunk maybe hit on the girl,

1257
01:15:56.020 --> 01:16:00.440
maybe something happened,
maybe something did it.
Oh.
And then it was like,
hey man,

1258
01:16:00.460 --> 01:16:03.420
sorry about what I did with Christine last that I was super hammered this,

1259
01:16:03.550 --> 01:16:06.670
but I was super hammered.
Yeah,
exactly right.
And that's the big one.

1260
01:16:06.730 --> 01:16:10.480
That's a big butt in the apology.
You know,
we all had,

1261
01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:15.130
I remember one tend to,
someone I won't go into.
It doesn't matter,

1262
01:16:15.131 --> 01:16:18.820
but it's a big one.
It's a big deal.
Or it's a big common one.

1263
01:16:18.821 --> 01:16:21.520
Where it wronged by a brother for,
no,

1264
01:16:21.521 --> 01:16:25.930
it was my blank parent's friend.
Okay.
Let's lady.

1265
01:16:26.410 --> 01:16:28.030
And she,
like she was talking,

1266
01:16:28.510 --> 01:16:31.900
she was talking shit about my mom to my dad and I was there,

1267
01:16:31.901 --> 01:16:33.000
they're hammered or whatever,

1268
01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:37.090
like some thing and she's like totally talking shit,
talking about this.

1269
01:16:37.090 --> 01:16:40.550
I'm going to do it,
I'm going to do it.
So I'm like,
whatever.
I'm like a tea,

1270
01:16:40.610 --> 01:16:44.810
maybe 15,
16 years old,
uh,
maybe,
maybe 30,
I don't know,
whatever.
But you know,

1271
01:16:44.830 --> 01:16:48.520
a teenager,
I wasn't like a three year old,
you know,

1272
01:16:48.970 --> 01:16:51.760
so I heard and I knew what she was talking about.
It was,
he was rude.

1273
01:16:51.761 --> 01:16:56.530
He was on coolest on the sat as we say.
And so I'm like,
cool.

1274
01:16:56.600 --> 01:17:00.250
I go home and I tell my mom straight up,
so my mom's like,
oh,
whoa,
okay.
You know,

1275
01:17:00.251 --> 01:17:02.380
it tells me Dad,
blah,
blah,
blah.
My Dad tells the lady,

1276
01:17:02.740 --> 01:17:07.180
and the Lady of course is all like,
oh no,
you know,
like I did this and you know,

1277
01:17:07.630 --> 01:17:11.880
so she comes to me and she says,
sorry,
right,
like,
sorry for this area.

1278
01:17:12.090 --> 01:17:15.930
But we had a,
you know,
we had a lot to drink or whatever and all this stuff.

1279
01:17:15.930 --> 01:17:20.100
And I remember feeling that like,
how are you?
Like how does this make it better?

1280
01:17:20.130 --> 01:17:21.060
You know,
when you're like,
well,

1281
01:17:21.061 --> 01:17:24.120
we had some thinking there and I didn't know anything about drinking.

1282
01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:28.230
I don't know what it made you sort of do.
I didn't really know at that time.

1283
01:17:28.620 --> 01:17:30.960
So to me it was like,
wait,
so wait,
when you drink,

1284
01:17:30.961 --> 01:17:32.850
like you can do that kind of stuff or what?

1285
01:17:32.851 --> 01:17:37.851
Like what's the deal in the apology just basically bounced off me like bullets

1286
01:17:38.191 --> 01:17:40.820
off of superman or something.
Yeah,
no,
Apollo,

1287
01:17:40.821 --> 01:17:43.890
he don't put the butts on those things.
So that's what happened with this guy.

1288
01:17:43.891 --> 01:17:48.000
That's what I think possible.
But it is his responsibility,
like you said,

1289
01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:52.500
to be like,
Hey,
I can't hold onto this thing.
You know?
Like what'd he say?

1290
01:17:52.501 --> 01:17:56.010
How do you psychologically reframing and kill that lingering resentment thing is

1291
01:17:56.011 --> 01:17:59.730
the,
it's like a scar you have to take.
He's like,
Ma,
keeping it a wound.

1292
01:18:00.030 --> 01:18:03.720
You got to man at it.
Yeah,
and you gotta be like,
that's just a scar.
It's like,

1293
01:18:03.721 --> 01:18:07.170
sure,
our relationship is different now.
It's a scar now,
but man,

1294
01:18:07.171 --> 01:18:11.530
I got more important things to think about or do whatever.
Yeah.

1295
01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:16.290
If he can pull that up that often because move on.
Next question.
Hello,

1296
01:18:16.350 --> 01:18:21.030
and thank you sir.
I'm an inner city math teacher in Oh gee.
Hardcore kid.

1297
01:18:21.710 --> 01:18:22.543
<v 0>Right?</v>

1298
01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:27.020
<v 2>I successfully approach to my students as a team that I am the leader of.</v>

1299
01:18:27.470 --> 01:18:31.790
How do I discipline some of my key players and at the same time boost or at

1300
01:18:31.791 --> 01:18:32.690
least not lower

1301
01:18:33.110 --> 01:18:36.680
<v 0>morale.
Awesome.
Well that's cool.</v>

1302
01:18:39.140 --> 01:18:39.950
I would say this.

1303
01:18:39.950 --> 01:18:44.000
If you've got kids in the classroom and he got key players in the classroom,

1304
01:18:45.260 --> 01:18:48.890
do what I always say to do to people.
Put them in charge of stuff,
man.

1305
01:18:49.400 --> 01:18:53.930
Put them in charge.
Put these kids in charge of things in the class,

1306
01:18:54.170 --> 01:18:57.140
not just dumb stuff.
Either not just clean up,

1307
01:18:58.460 --> 01:19:02.600
not just sweeping the floor,
but some legitimate stuff like,
hey,

1308
01:19:02.630 --> 01:19:04.760
I want you to come up with a lesson plan for tomorrow.

1309
01:19:04.761 --> 01:19:07.910
Here's the book that we're looking at.
Here's the pages I want you to talk about.

1310
01:19:08.180 --> 01:19:12.650
Dang,
I want you to lead the discussion that we're going to have in class.
Hey,

1311
01:19:12.651 --> 01:19:16.850
once you go over how you've solved this math problems tomorrow,

1312
01:19:17.450 --> 01:19:20.660
you got,
you got some of the problems wrong on the test.

1313
01:19:21.170 --> 01:19:25.820
I want to teach them to you and I want you to teach the class because obviously

1314
01:19:25.821 --> 01:19:26.810
I didn't do a good job.

1315
01:19:26.930 --> 01:19:31.500
Maybe you can do a better job than me and you know what you you,

1316
01:19:31.530 --> 01:19:34.740
you're kind of you kind of loud.
Let's put that to use.

1317
01:19:34.950 --> 01:19:38.830
I know people listen to you.
Here's another thing,
kid.
The kids look at,

1318
01:19:38.850 --> 01:19:39.930
look at you and they look up to you.

1319
01:19:40.910 --> 01:19:41.610
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1320
01:19:41.610 --> 01:19:44.580
<v 0>let's use that.
Let's try and get kids moving in the right direction.</v>

1321
01:19:45.580 --> 01:19:46.080
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1322
01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:48.300
<v 0>so that's what I would do in a situation like this.</v>

1323
01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:53.460
If someone's actually getting in trouble,
I wouldn't,
you don't do this.

1324
01:19:53.461 --> 01:19:56.640
You don't do what I'm talking about because they're in trouble.
Right.

1325
01:19:56.641 --> 01:19:59.310
That's a little bit,
you can't say you're in trouble.

1326
01:19:59.370 --> 01:20:01.620
So you're going to have to teach classes tomorrow.
No,
no,
no,
no.
That doesn't work.

1327
01:20:02.580 --> 01:20:06.570
You say you say,
Hey,
you let that whatever they got punished for you use,

1328
01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:09.880
you know,
your punishment.
That could be something like taking out trash.
Yeah,

1329
01:20:10.620 --> 01:20:15.620
but you don't want to throw leadership at someone when they get in trouble.

1330
01:20:16.410 --> 01:20:19.830
Occasionally you can't do it.
Occasionally you can be like,
okay,
you know what?

1331
01:20:19.831 --> 01:20:23.610
You're in charge of the platoon for this week or for these four days of Admin

1332
01:20:25.710 --> 01:20:27.660
and all of a sudden,
yeah,
you realize,
Oh,

1333
01:20:27.690 --> 01:20:29.640
you got to come in at five o'clock in the morning.
Oh,

1334
01:20:29.641 --> 01:20:33.150
you got to stay until 1800 at night.
Oh,
you've got these reports do.
Oh yeah.

1335
01:20:33.151 --> 01:20:36.450
It's like all these things that you didn't think about.
That's what you gotta do.

1336
01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:41.580
And when you get off that restriction and you get out of that role,

1337
01:20:41.581 --> 01:20:42.420
you realize,
hey,

1338
01:20:42.421 --> 01:20:45.120
I have a little respect for the boss because I realized what the boss is going

1339
01:20:45.121 --> 01:20:48.150
through.
So that's what I would do.
Have some fun with this.

1340
01:20:48.300 --> 01:20:51.510
Put the kids in charge of stuff.
Give them little assignments.
Make them get up.

1341
01:20:51.511 --> 01:20:55.980
Make them turn them into leaders.
Hmm.
Tournament in leaders.

1342
01:20:58.190 --> 01:21:01.610
Check where you think one more.
One more.

1343
01:21:03.230 --> 01:21:06.740
What do you do when you fail and how do you handle it?

1344
01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:10.670
What do you do when you fail?

1345
01:21:15.860 --> 01:21:16.251
You know,

1346
01:21:16.251 --> 01:21:21.251
recently we reviewed that US army field manual on here from like World War Two

1347
01:21:27.620 --> 01:21:30.830
era and it says in that manual it says,

1348
01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:33.350
other than death,

1349
01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:37.440
all failure is psychological

1350
01:21:39.750 --> 01:21:43.560
other than deaf.
All failure is psychological.
Think about that.

1351
01:21:45.570 --> 01:21:50.410
Just just think about that.
This failure,
this upset,
this,

1352
01:21:51.070 --> 01:21:55.480
this catastrophe.
If you aren't dead,

1353
01:21:57.430 --> 01:22:00.490
dead,
it's just psychological.
It's in your head.

1354
01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:04.073
No,

1355
01:22:04.170 --> 01:22:09.170
this does not mean that you won't lose some battles because you will.

1356
01:22:09.450 --> 01:22:10.290
We all will,

1357
01:22:10.990 --> 01:22:11.823
<v 1>right?</v>

1358
01:22:12.860 --> 01:22:17.860
<v 0>But it does mean that as long as you don't surrender,</v>

1359
01:22:19.851 --> 01:22:24.290
as long as you don't give up,
as long as you don't quit,
then you haven't.
Failed.

1360
01:22:26.760 --> 01:22:31.760
Just means you've made a temporary tactical retreat means you've made a,

1361
01:22:32.970 --> 01:22:37.970
a brief withdraw so that you can regroup

1362
01:22:40.960 --> 01:22:41.860
and we attack.

1363
01:22:42.420 --> 01:22:43.253
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1364
01:22:45.140 --> 01:22:48.890
<v 0>So as far as I'm concerned,
if you get beat,</v>

1365
01:22:48.920 --> 01:22:50.330
unless you're dead,

1366
01:22:50.480 --> 01:22:54.320
you are not defeated and you have not failed.

1367
01:22:54.890 --> 01:22:58.370
What you've done is you've learned,
you've,

1368
01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.160
you've gained experience

1369
01:23:03.660 --> 01:23:04.860
and you're still alive.

1370
01:23:07.950 --> 01:23:11.060
<v 2>Thank you.
Have Memories to make.</v>

1371
01:23:14.330 --> 01:23:18.100
So get up
and go get after it.

1372
01:23:21.500 --> 01:23:25.850
And I think that's
all I've got for tonight.

1373
01:23:25.880 --> 01:23:29.600
So Echo Charles.
Yes.
Speaking of

1374
01:23:31.730 --> 01:23:34.340
getting after it.
Sure.
Getting after it.

1375
01:23:34.370 --> 01:23:37.610
Can you help us in that category?
Yes.

1376
01:23:37.700 --> 01:23:40.670
So we are on the path part of them.
Part of that path,

1377
01:23:40.700 --> 01:23:44.420
like we always say is Jujitsu.
It's funny how like you'll say,
Judy,

1378
01:23:44.460 --> 01:23:47.330
like when you suggest someone to,
to,

1379
01:23:47.420 --> 01:23:51.890
or your suggestion for someone to like move on or to like,
you know,

1380
01:23:51.980 --> 01:23:55.790
get out of a ride or whatever you always said you did too.
Yes.
And rightly so.

1381
01:23:55.880 --> 01:24:00.130
Yes.
It,
it's one of those things men where I,
I've,

1382
01:24:00.260 --> 01:24:01.490
I'm not a psychologist.

1383
01:24:02.330 --> 01:24:02.720
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

1384
01:24:02.720 --> 01:24:03.553
<v 2>I know you know that.</v>

1385
01:24:03.770 --> 01:24:08.770
But I think that it'll cure various levels of depression.

1386
01:24:09.830 --> 01:24:13.790
Real.
Hey,
I've taken a lot of flack over that.
Yeah.

1387
01:24:14.450 --> 01:24:19.160
I've taken a lot of flack over that.
I think Joe Rogan,
sure.

1388
01:24:20.660 --> 01:24:23.510
When I was on his knee and we were basically saying like a workout,
you know,

1389
01:24:23.540 --> 01:24:27.830
feel better and everyone got all mad.
Right.
But the funny thing is,

1390
01:24:28.070 --> 01:24:28.903
Tim Ferriss,

1391
01:24:29.450 --> 01:24:33.710
who's actually gone through that kind of depression will tell you the exact same

1392
01:24:33.711 --> 01:24:37.940
thing.
Yeah.
So yeah.
Workout,

1393
01:24:37.970 --> 01:24:40.850
workout and do Jujitsu.
Jujitsu for sure.
Yeah,

1394
01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:43.390
it's crazy with you don't why I'd say,
dude,

1395
01:24:43.400 --> 01:24:47.780
it's even more than just like a regular workout,
whatever that even means.
But um,

1396
01:24:48.170 --> 01:24:53.170
is because you have a challenge that's a little bit more obviously like you

1397
01:24:53.420 --> 01:24:57.290
against like an obvious challenge,
you know,
and true against the person.

1398
01:24:57.291 --> 01:24:59.870
There's that.
Okay.
And then there's the physical part of it,
of course,

1399
01:24:59.871 --> 01:25:03.410
like the workout part of it,
which isn't one of the best workouts.

1400
01:25:03.680 --> 01:25:08.630
Like if I wanted to like lose 30 pounds,
right.
For,
I don't know,

1401
01:25:08.631 --> 01:25:12.860
whatever,
if I want to lose 30 pounds,
like bad pounds.
Right.
So I,
you know,

1402
01:25:13.580 --> 01:25:15.710
and right now,
as of right now,

1403
01:25:15.711 --> 01:25:19.400
there's no way I would do like a a weight loss workout.
Yeah.

1404
01:25:19.430 --> 01:25:22.100
I would just do regular weight lifting and I would just do more Jujitsu.

1405
01:25:22.340 --> 01:25:25.210
That's it.
100% like why would you son's cruising?

1406
01:25:25.211 --> 01:25:28.330
I mean do you do to is such a good workout.
Yeah.

1407
01:25:28.370 --> 01:25:31.720
Why would you work out muscles that you didn't know you had your whole body to?

1408
01:25:31.730 --> 01:25:36.260
Yeah.
By the way,
whole Bot.
Yeah.
Even your jaw muscles.
Yup.
Yeah.
True Story.
Yeah.

1409
01:25:36.440 --> 01:25:37.273
Oh yeah.
Everything.

1410
01:25:37.520 --> 01:25:40.100
Especially you with the job muscles because you're spending a lot of time on the

1411
01:25:40.101 --> 01:25:44.780
quarter of the bat talking
Ceasarean or coincidentally,

1412
01:25:44.781 --> 01:25:48.980
that's another part of it is what I was about to say.
So aspect 800 for you.

1413
01:25:49.280 --> 01:25:53.390
For everybody,
right.
Okay.
Yeah,
for you too and have a little conversation.

1414
01:25:53.510 --> 01:25:57.230
Oh yeah.
Post training.
Yeah.
Even like between rounds,
whatever.

1415
01:25:57.231 --> 01:26:00.980
It's like you're doing it and sure you can do that at the gym kind of,

1416
01:26:01.010 --> 01:26:04.550
but it's different.
And what we do people to want to talk before training,

1417
01:26:04.910 --> 01:26:08.960
I protest that you're high protest it.
I stopped the dark,
start the clock.

1418
01:26:09.480 --> 01:26:12.680
He's gonna be okay if I'm in a rounds are rolling.
You guys are rolling people.

1419
01:26:12.710 --> 01:26:14.210
There's enough of this chitty chatter.

1420
01:26:14.270 --> 01:26:19.130
Here's how prevalent the social element is.
He's looking at you.
No,
no,

1421
01:26:19.131 --> 01:26:21.380
no.
And you'll agree with it because it happens with you too.

1422
01:26:21.710 --> 01:26:24.920
So you ever like shaking kits,
clock started,
clock started,

1423
01:26:24.980 --> 01:26:28.700
you shake hands with the person and then you just sneak in one question to the

1424
01:26:28.701 --> 01:26:30.190
person.
Like socially,
no,

1425
01:26:30.710 --> 01:26:34.550
not all the time because like you remember like I'll do it with Greg,

1426
01:26:34.551 --> 01:26:36.350
I'll do with you.
So you don't joke about that.

1427
01:26:36.860 --> 01:26:40.100
Oh like we'll talk about our day like Andy and I will joke about.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1428
01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:45.020
Like beep clock starts and it's like how was work today dude.
Yeah,

1429
01:26:45.070 --> 01:26:45.891
but that happens.

1430
01:26:45.891 --> 01:26:50.030
Basically what it means is neither one of us feels like trainings and still

1431
01:26:50.031 --> 01:26:52.310
loves laugh and then we'll train.
Right?
Cause we won't,

1432
01:26:52.311 --> 01:26:54.650
we won't actually have a conversation.
Right.

1433
01:26:54.860 --> 01:26:57.770
But see how you know that it's an easy thing.

1434
01:26:57.830 --> 01:27:00.170
It's you all so much that you make jokes about it.
Yes it is.

1435
01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:01.940
That's how social it is.
You know,

1436
01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:06.020
you can only just got to tighten my belt and adjust my g and put my knee pads

1437
01:27:06.021 --> 01:27:09.170
back up and you know what I mean?
Cause another stalling tactics.

1438
01:27:10.460 --> 01:27:13.000
Not very social,
but yeah,
it's stalling for sure.
Um,

1439
01:27:13.270 --> 01:27:17.640
but and there's a lot of benefits to this thing that we call Jujitsu.

1440
01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:22.370
The Shit.
Anyway,
that's a side note anyway.
When you're doing,
do you use to,

1441
01:27:22.371 --> 01:27:25.550
of course you need a geek cause you're doing g,
n Nogi.
So when you get your key,

1442
01:27:25.551 --> 01:27:27.050
what gains are we getting?
Are we getting the best skis?

1443
01:27:27.051 --> 01:27:30.760
Are we getting the Juncus keys?
We're getting the best keys,
correct?
Oh yeah.

1444
01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:33.680
Big Time.
Anyway.
The best cookies are origin gies.

1445
01:27:33.681 --> 01:27:38.210
You get them@originmain.com or [inaudible] dot com the all kinds of stuff.

1446
01:27:38.360 --> 01:27:41.770
All kinds of clothes.
Including jeans.
Yes.
American debt,

1447
01:27:41.771 --> 01:27:45.710
which you know what even like not everyone does Jujitsu.

1448
01:27:45.770 --> 01:27:48.770
Not everyone does Gigi Jitsu,
but everyone does have jeans.

1449
01:27:49.020 --> 01:27:50.690
Now let me ask you the same question you asked me.

1450
01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:54.200
What kind of genes are we getting best?
Not,
the junk is not the junk.

1451
01:27:54.230 --> 01:27:58.970
What'd you say?
Juncus junk.
Kista that's not even a word.
Yes it is.
It is.

1452
01:27:58.971 --> 01:28:03.760
The junkiest kind.
It is.
If something is junk.
Oh you know what?
Johnson,

1453
01:28:03.790 --> 01:28:06.690
either one of those subtle differences in,
in,
in,

1454
01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:11.000
remember how I told you in co in Hawaii they're like subtle differences in
words.

1455
01:28:11.300 --> 01:28:13.970
They're only small.
They're pretty much the same,
but there's subtle differences.

1456
01:28:13.971 --> 01:28:17.900
One of them that is one of them,
like junkies,
like little pigeon.
Yeah.

1457
01:28:17.901 --> 01:28:22.070
As a little pigeon.
Cause it would be junkiest right.
Not Jumping up.

1458
01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:25.340
Exactly right.
So junk is the same as junky.
Like it's this,

1459
01:28:25.350 --> 01:28:29.000
it's like in the mainline,
you say junky.
Like it's more of a,
what do you call it?

1460
01:28:29.001 --> 01:28:33.700
Like not a verb,
but um,
uh,
oh yeah.
I like that.
That hamburger is real,

1461
01:28:34.250 --> 01:28:39.200
real junkie.
Right?
So junk on the mainland,
the word junk is a noun.
It's a junk.

1462
01:28:39.201 --> 01:28:42.590
It's a piece of junk.
It's a pile of junk.
It's a,

1463
01:28:42.591 --> 01:28:46.340
now in Hawaii it's a,
it's an adjective.

1464
01:28:46.770 --> 01:28:51.330
Like it's junk.
Like that's a way of describing it.
No,

1465
01:28:51.540 --> 01:28:55.760
no,
no,
no.
See it sounded like a noun to you because you're from the mainland.

1466
01:28:55.910 --> 01:28:56.743
If you say John,

1467
01:28:56.780 --> 01:29:01.780
that's why you can have words like it's a junker way more general way

1468
01:29:02.250 --> 01:29:02.711
<v 0>more junk.</v>

1469
01:29:02.711 --> 01:29:05.690
Like we don't want the jug because there's such thing as junk Juncker and

1470
01:29:05.730 --> 01:29:08.940
junkiest in Hawaii and here it's like no,
it's just junk.

1471
01:29:08.941 --> 01:29:12.320
It's either junk or it's like not junk.
You don't kind of thing cause it's no,

1472
01:29:12.440 --> 01:29:15.630
see what I'm saying?
Like I said,
these differences are subtle of follow though.

1473
01:29:15.670 --> 01:29:18.600
Yeah,
I know.
Cause I thought of like if you went,
if I said,
hey,

1474
01:29:18.601 --> 01:29:20.790
what's that stuff on the side of your house over there echo,
you'd be like,

1475
01:29:20.791 --> 01:29:24.450
oh that's just junk right up pilot junk.
And I get what you mean by that.

1476
01:29:24.451 --> 01:29:28.770
It's in a lawn chair.
It's the old weed wacker that doesn't work anymore.
Right?

1477
01:29:29.020 --> 01:29:32.160
Yeah.
There's a couple of stuffed animals that no one wants to be more.

1478
01:29:32.190 --> 01:29:36.600
That's junk.
Yes.
What you're saying is,
hey,

1479
01:29:36.630 --> 01:29:41.200
how's that car that you just bought?
Yeah.
How's it work?
How is it?
Is that thing?

1480
01:29:41.610 --> 01:29:44.390
Nope.
Is it dope?
And you're like,
no,
no,
it's junk.
It's junk.

1481
01:29:44.391 --> 01:29:47.840
How was that movie last night?
Kind of junk.
Yeah.
Okay.

1482
01:29:47.880 --> 01:29:49.860
So in regards to jeans,

1483
01:29:49.980 --> 01:29:54.980
you don't want the junk gene or in your case the junky or junkiest genes,

1484
01:29:55.380 --> 01:30:00.210
junk kist is what you said.
Caress the whole,
the Ko.
Why version whole lot.
Yes.

1485
01:30:00.330 --> 01:30:03.510
That's how,
um,
nonetheless,
no,
you want the best ones.

1486
01:30:03.511 --> 01:30:07.950
Get the origin jeans and whatever other clothes and don't forget about

1487
01:30:07.951 --> 01:30:12.360
supplements to supplements,
joint warfare,
Krill oil discipline,

1488
01:30:12.720 --> 01:30:15.770
discipline,
go discipline.

1489
01:30:15.780 --> 01:30:19.290
Go for when you need a little kick.
And,
and uh,
it's interesting,

1490
01:30:19.291 --> 01:30:23.280
you and I have both morphed to a situation where discipline,

1491
01:30:23.670 --> 01:30:26.850
the drink is just the normal.
That's just part of the world.

1492
01:30:27.090 --> 01:30:31.140
That's just part of it.
I am now drinking and this is the thing about discipline.

1493
01:30:31.800 --> 01:30:34.920
It doesn't have 480 grams of,

1494
01:30:34.950 --> 01:30:38.220
or 480 milligrams of caffeine.
Yeah.
In fact,

1495
01:30:38.340 --> 01:30:43.140
it has 15 grams per scoop.
This is not the crazy stimulant that's like,

1496
01:30:43.680 --> 01:30:45.090
let's face it,
Jujitsu,

1497
01:30:45.870 --> 01:30:49.470
you don't want to be all amped up on caffeine going to your class.
How do you do?

1498
01:30:50.010 --> 01:30:54.320
That's why discipline is so good.
Pre Roll.
You know,

1499
01:30:54.600 --> 01:30:57.750
so that's what I figured out now.
Cause if you have ice tea,

1500
01:30:57.780 --> 01:31:01.830
which I used to drink a lot of ice tea drink Jocko white tea,
right.

1501
01:31:02.030 --> 01:31:05.100
You just drink that stuff.
Right?
Like think of when you were a kid,

1502
01:31:05.101 --> 01:31:07.950
all going to have some ice tea that had caffeine in it.
Right.

1503
01:31:08.100 --> 01:31:11.340
You weren't freaking out.
That has way more caffeine in discipline.

1504
01:31:11.670 --> 01:31:13.760
So what I'm saying is discipline is now just sort of a,

1505
01:31:14.370 --> 01:31:18.150
it goes to just a day long,
like an all day.
I must have had,

1506
01:31:18.870 --> 01:31:22.770
I must have had five bottles of discipline today.
Dang.
Okay.
Yeah.

1507
01:31:23.160 --> 01:31:26.750
That's just horrible day because I'm sitting there drinking it.
You know,
I'm,

1508
01:31:26.760 --> 01:31:31.380
I'm working.
Yeah.
I'm writing,
I'm editing,
which,
which,

1509
01:31:31.381 --> 01:31:32.214
which

1510
01:31:33.330 --> 01:31:38.330
let's face it like it writing and editing sometimes is a real chore and Mental

1511
01:31:39.720 --> 01:31:43.590
Chore.
Not Fun.
Yeah.
So you've got to get in no game.
Yeah.

1512
01:31:43.680 --> 01:31:44.550
That's why I've been drinking a lot,

1513
01:31:44.551 --> 01:31:48.420
had been disciplined lately because a lot of writing,
a lot of mental thought.

1514
01:31:48.690 --> 01:31:50.430
Yeah.
So anyways,
I don't know,

1515
01:31:50.440 --> 01:31:54.330
the mega mix for Jujitsu is discipline.

1516
01:31:55.180 --> 01:31:59.320
Okay.
Water.
You can actually add like a little,
like a,
maybe like a third

1517
01:31:59.980 --> 01:32:04.810
<v 2>cup,
whatever the third of your mix total of like a cranberry juice or like,</v>

1518
01:32:04.811 --> 01:32:08.770
um,
you can squeeze lemon juice in there or something.
Okay.
Water,
lemon juice,

1519
01:32:09.070 --> 01:32:14.070
discipline and on it has these like minerals and electrolytes mix one scoop of

1520
01:32:15.551 --> 01:32:19.840
that.
Boom.
That's the Jujitsu mega mix.
There you go.
Brad,
to bring you through,

1521
01:32:19.900 --> 01:32:23.410
go to do two scoops of discipline.
Three.
If you want to get nuts,

1522
01:32:24.750 --> 01:32:28.030
you got to add more water,
you know,
and then you've got that situation going on.

1523
01:32:28.031 --> 01:32:32.800
Whatever's been times where I've made discipline shots.
Oh,
okay.
You're like,

1524
01:32:32.801 --> 01:32:37.760
I know like,
Hey,
okay.
You know what I'm heading to do Jujitsu.
I,

1525
01:32:37.890 --> 01:32:40.080
I'm going to be there in three minutes.
No.
Yeah,
yeah.

1526
01:32:40.090 --> 01:32:43.180
I'm just going to mix up a little shot.
It's got three scoops and it's,

1527
01:32:43.300 --> 01:32:45.910
it's like a shot.
Yeah.
So I've done that before,

1528
01:32:46.180 --> 01:32:48.310
but that's also why mint discipline go.
Yeah,

1529
01:32:48.340 --> 01:32:51.010
because just when glow is for those situations where you don't want to drink a

1530
01:32:51.011 --> 01:32:53.380
bunch,
but you just want that hit her.
Yeah.

1531
01:32:53.410 --> 01:32:57.100
But the go the pill that takes longer though,
right?
Cause it's not instant.

1532
01:32:57.101 --> 01:33:01.060
It's instant.
That's what I tasted.
Salvation like I don't know,
half an hour,

1533
01:33:01.090 --> 01:33:05.930
40 minutes prior to event situation evolution.
It's like,
yeah,

1534
01:33:05.940 --> 01:33:10.600
the evolution it mine I feel like is or it is straight up.

1535
01:33:10.601 --> 01:33:14.420
It's like a routine.
You know how like you sort of have a routine.
I know.
Yes.

1536
01:33:14.490 --> 01:33:19.330
You know some,
some people do.
I got some routines and um,
when you call,
yeah,

1537
01:33:19.331 --> 01:33:23.140
the protocol comes into play like this.
You go boom,

1538
01:33:23.141 --> 01:33:25.960
okay I got you did x x time.
Right.

1539
01:33:26.020 --> 01:33:31.020
I leave the house at x time minus whatever I drink the mega mix x time minus

1540
01:33:32.621 --> 01:33:35.890
whatever minus,
you know,
another 10 minutes.
So it's like the,
the,

1541
01:33:35.900 --> 01:33:39.280
the amount of time it takes to mix it out and you just tell me when to drink it.

1542
01:33:39.281 --> 01:33:43.150
If they're going to roll or do something active.
Oh the thing is,

1543
01:33:43.151 --> 01:33:47.230
I don't want to say 40 minutes,
my half an hour,
40 minutes,
half an hour,

1544
01:33:47.710 --> 01:33:51.470
40 minutes or half an nine as I leave the house.
So I'll have my costs.

1545
01:33:51.480 --> 01:33:54.970
That's how long it take to get here.
15 between 15 and 20 minutes.

1546
01:33:55.530 --> 01:33:57.310
So what'd you don't need it to kick in right when you get here?

1547
01:33:57.311 --> 01:34:01.560
Cause going to be chat with people for the first half hour,
correct?
Yes.
Yeah.

1548
01:34:01.570 --> 01:34:02.351
It's one of those things,

1549
01:34:02.351 --> 01:34:05.110
it's not like there's this little teeny tiny window of it working,

1550
01:34:05.111 --> 01:34:08.080
but once it's in the,
in the system you're rolling.
Oh yeah.

1551
01:34:08.650 --> 01:34:13.650
I you don't even really like feel it like wear off or nothing like a coffee

1552
01:34:14.081 --> 01:34:17.320
crash or nothing like that.
So I don't know.
I just do it that way.
That's been,

1553
01:34:17.620 --> 01:34:22.480
and it's worked.
Like,
man,
I'll,
I won't not do it that way,
honestly.
What is 100%?

1554
01:34:22.880 --> 01:34:27.190
Uh,
also don't forget about milk,
which is if you need extra protein,

1555
01:34:27.191 --> 01:34:31.960
which you do,
you can get it from milk or if you just want a straight up desert,

1556
01:34:31.990 --> 01:34:32.980
you just have dessert.

1557
01:34:33.220 --> 01:34:36.490
And if you don't think the strawberry milk tastes like dessert,
you're wrong.

1558
01:34:36.510 --> 01:34:40.240
You know,
the strawberry milk is dessert.
Get some.

1559
01:34:40.540 --> 01:34:43.050
And some of the other ones,
I've just had so much of them.

1560
01:34:43.070 --> 01:34:45.310
I'm just really stoked on the strawberry right now.
Mint,

1561
01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:50.030
you know what it was your goto peanut butter or is it meant Mitt but all I'll

1562
01:34:50.050 --> 01:34:52.510
interchange for a variety of whatever that strategy everyone came in.

1563
01:34:52.540 --> 01:34:56.950
Thanks Brian for that by the way.
So it's like,
okay.
You know,
strawberry slayer,

1564
01:34:57.910 --> 01:35:02.120
there's a lot of height.
Yeah,
it's strawberry.
Cool.
I'm not the hugest.
Um,

1565
01:35:02.150 --> 01:35:07.040
like I like,
I like the struggle.
I like it.
Yeah.
But when there's chocolate,

1566
01:35:07.041 --> 01:35:10.340
like why would you do strawberry?
You know,
if you have chocolate or whatever.

1567
01:35:10.341 --> 01:35:14.180
So I'm like,
but whatever.
Let's do it.
The strawberry,

1568
01:35:14.181 --> 01:35:16.790
which is somewhat mixed it up,
boom,
the same deal.

1569
01:35:16.791 --> 01:35:19.250
I didn't want to like add extra stuff in there.

1570
01:35:19.251 --> 01:35:23.720
I just thought I wanted the raw deal.
So I had regular milk and strawberry milk.

1571
01:35:24.110 --> 01:35:28.970
See what the hype is all about.
Surprisingly,
surprisingly good meaning,

1572
01:35:29.120 --> 01:35:32.660
and I don't,
you know,
that's a general term,
surprisingly good or whatever.
To me,

1573
01:35:33.200 --> 01:35:37.490
the strawberry milk tastes closer to an actual strawberry milkshake.

1574
01:35:37.550 --> 01:35:42.550
The only difference that I could detect is that it's not as like overtly sweet

1575
01:35:42.591 --> 01:35:46.960
as like one from like,
uh,
you know,
like you get a strawberry milkshake place,

1576
01:35:47.190 --> 01:35:50.060
you know,
it just wasn't as sweet as that.
That's it.

1577
01:35:50.420 --> 01:35:52.730
Put another half a scoop in there and you'll be in the zone.

1578
01:35:52.760 --> 01:35:56.860
That's what I thought.
And that's what I figured out when you want.
So I,
I,

1579
01:35:57.030 --> 01:36:01.640
I implemented the,
that hitter,
the real litmus test,

1580
01:36:02.180 --> 01:36:02.421
right?

1581
01:36:02.421 --> 01:36:06.020
So what do you call in the list of the kits and have them sit down and I was

1582
01:36:06.021 --> 01:36:08.750
like,
all right,
I'm here.
This is strawberry milk.
Have something,

1583
01:36:08.751 --> 01:36:11.540
just a little thing.
So here's how you do it.
You don't say it easily good,

1584
01:36:11.541 --> 01:36:14.290
is it not good?
Because if they're not into you want more,

1585
01:36:14.450 --> 01:36:18.050
you don't even ask that.
You just wait.
So,
because if you ask,
hey,

1586
01:36:18.051 --> 01:36:20.150
is it good or not good though?
If they're old enough,

1587
01:36:20.151 --> 01:36:21.860
they'll tell you what you want to hear.
They'll be like,
yeah,
good.

1588
01:36:21.861 --> 01:36:24.650
Then they'll go play or they won't be into the tests at all,

1589
01:36:24.651 --> 01:36:27.820
which typically they're not.
And they'll just be like,
no,
it's junk.
Therefore,

1590
01:36:27.830 --> 01:36:30.170
you know,
in their mind he won't give me any more or whatever.
You know,

1591
01:36:30.171 --> 01:36:33.380
you just don't get an actual action,
uh,
an accurate reading.

1592
01:36:33.560 --> 01:36:36.680
So what you do see here,
you can have some of this.
That's it.

1593
01:36:37.070 --> 01:36:40.280
So they tasted both of them wanted more.
Both of them.

1594
01:36:42.190 --> 01:36:44.980
Yeah.
That's what it is.
Really good stuff.
So,

1595
01:36:44.990 --> 01:36:47.690
and also don't forget you got warrior kid milk that comes in strawberry and

1596
01:36:47.691 --> 01:36:50.170
chocolate as well.
And it's,
it's,

1597
01:36:50.370 --> 01:36:55.360
it's like a legitimately good for your children.
So get it for him.
Oh yeah.

1598
01:36:56.120 --> 01:36:58.040
Also Jocko white tea.
Yes.

1599
01:36:58.100 --> 01:37:03.100
Chuck West some teeth called Jocko white tea and it just is like drinking

1600
01:37:03.680 --> 01:37:07.430
goodness.
That's what it is.
Drinking victory.
Drinking tastes like,

1601
01:37:07.431 --> 01:37:12.140
tastes like victory and it's just goodness.
Got Antioxidants,
get you little,

1602
01:37:12.460 --> 01:37:16.580
gets you a little kicker certified organic too,
by the way.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1603
01:37:16.640 --> 01:37:20.630
So that's that.
Anyway,
really cool.
Origin main.com.
I forgot to say that.
Yes.

1604
01:37:20.810 --> 01:37:24.530
Also Jocko has his own store Jocko store.

1605
01:37:24.590 --> 01:37:26.270
So you go to Jocko store.com.

1606
01:37:26.271 --> 01:37:30.950
This is where you can get your discipline equals freedom,
shirts,
hoodies,

1607
01:37:31.310 --> 01:37:36.110
lightweight end,
heavyweight hats.
You anyway,
hats.

1608
01:37:36.610 --> 01:37:39.380
No,
you know,
no heavyweight hats.
Um,
you know,

1609
01:37:39.381 --> 01:37:41.510
but you do have those trucker hats with the,
what do you call it?

1610
01:37:41.511 --> 01:37:46.130
Snap back or flex fit.
So some options there anyway.
Anyway,

1611
01:37:46.131 --> 01:37:49.750
you want to represent the path.
You can get something there.
Rash guards as well.

1612
01:37:49.790 --> 01:37:52.460
You just do or whatever you're doing.
Boom,
you can get it.

1613
01:37:52.461 --> 01:37:56.010
One of those shirt that says good on it,
that does not have head on it.

1614
01:37:56.070 --> 01:38:00.630
Which is a positive thing.
Moving in a different direction.
More subtle direction.

1615
01:38:01.020 --> 01:38:04.590
I don't necessarily agree because I think that the one with your hand on it is

1616
01:38:04.591 --> 01:38:09.450
like,
cause not very subtle bro at all.
But it does like,

1617
01:38:10.490 --> 01:38:13.740
no,
they both have their benefits because look,
when I wear the good one,
just,

1618
01:38:13.741 --> 01:38:17.760
just good.
Like the people who do say something,
they're just kinda like,
oh yeah,

1619
01:38:17.761 --> 01:38:20.850
good,
good.
They'll just say it.
You know?
But the one with your head,

1620
01:38:21.060 --> 01:38:25.140
they'll either ask,
oh who is that on your shirt?
Like who is that?

1621
01:38:25.170 --> 01:38:26.940
Usually it's like,
I don't know,
you know,

1622
01:38:27.720 --> 01:38:30.600
Winston Churchill or I don't know where a public figure in there.

1623
01:38:31.020 --> 01:38:35.520
So they're wondering who is that and why the [inaudible] forgot to do that.

1624
01:38:35.521 --> 01:38:37.600
Now the first thing that came to me,

1625
01:38:37.950 --> 01:38:40.500
and I've never seen a Winston Churchill tee shirt,

1626
01:38:40.560 --> 01:38:42.660
but I'm glad that we got that going

1627
01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:48.990
nonetheless.
Or they'll know who you are and they know that that's what you say.

1628
01:38:49.110 --> 01:38:50.610
And they'll be like,
you know,
what do you call it?

1629
01:38:50.611 --> 01:38:53.700
The book that when they know and you know,
and if eds exactly right.

1630
01:38:53.700 --> 01:38:58.500
So I dig both 100%,
but nonetheless,
a lot of cool stuff on there.

1631
01:38:58.501 --> 01:39:03.300
If you,
uh,
if you like something,
get something as they say,

1632
01:39:03.690 --> 01:39:07.340
also subscribe to the podcast if you haven't already on iTunes and stitcher and

1633
01:39:07.350 --> 01:39:09.270
wherever you listen to podcasts,

1634
01:39:09.290 --> 01:39:13.470
because a lot of places they're trying to kind of change the landscape of

1635
01:39:13.471 --> 01:39:14.910
podcasts,
listening to,
by the way,

1636
01:39:15.630 --> 01:39:20.380
they want to charge money or something and put it behind the fire wall.
Pay,

1637
01:39:20.460 --> 01:39:24.600
I think it's paywall pay wall,
maybe the firewall to firewall,
the paywall.

1638
01:39:24.810 --> 01:39:28.680
Anyways,
we're free.
We're free.
Yeah,
free.
But nonetheless,
hey,

1639
01:39:28.710 --> 01:39:30.480
it is what you have to pay.
You know what you have to pay,

1640
01:39:30.481 --> 01:39:33.240
you have to listen to this part of the podcast is you don't actually even have

1641
01:39:33.241 --> 01:39:34.074
to do,

1642
01:39:35.300 --> 01:39:38.220
it's like one of those little trays and forget about the warrior kid podcast,

1643
01:39:38.221 --> 01:39:41.460
which is also not behind a paywall and it's free for your children.

1644
01:39:41.610 --> 01:39:43.320
If your kids want to learn how to be on the path,

1645
01:39:43.321 --> 01:39:44.550
your kids want to learn about discipline.

1646
01:39:44.551 --> 01:39:49.470
If your kids want to learn how to handle bullying and trouble in school and

1647
01:39:49.471 --> 01:39:50.191
trouble study,

1648
