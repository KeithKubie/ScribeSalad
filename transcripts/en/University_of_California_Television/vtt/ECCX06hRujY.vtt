00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:05.200
- [Narrator] This program
is a presentation of UCTV

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.323
for educational and
non-commercial use only.

00:00:11.384 --> 00:00:13.967
(upbeat music)

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.593
- We're very pleased to have
as our Jefferson lecture,

00:00:49.443 --> 00:00:51.360
a person, a scholar who,

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.190
lives up to really remarkable history

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.710
of this lecture series which
as you see from your program

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.610
goes back to 1958, and has included

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.070
some of the leading figures
in public intellectual life

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.140
and political life and journalism

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.600
and above all in scholarship.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.030
These lectures were established in 1944

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.490
through a bequest from Elizabeth Bonestell

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.610
and her husband Cutler Bonestell,

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.320
San Francisco couple that
cared a lot about history

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.280
and hope that lectures on
the democratic tradition

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.400
Thomas Jefferson and the
values of American democracy

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.703
would be of interest to this community.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.100
Today's lecturer is John Witte.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.920
Who is a professor at Emory University,

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.720
where he holds a distinguished chair

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.360
and where is headed a
center, a remarkable center

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.210
which is engaged in studies

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.163
of religion and law for many years.

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.850
It's always been a matter
of astonishment to me

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.820
how, first of all his own career,

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.350
he's been ahead of the
curve by about 15 years.

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.327
And just thinking about
such questions as religion

00:02:02.327 --> 00:02:04.110
and the post-soviet Russia,

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.790
are thinking about
Islam and the challenges

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.790
that are migration such as
we experience would generate.

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:14.350
And and he very kindly met
with a group of students

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:15.500
and faculty at lunch today,

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.280
and lo and behold he
said that their objective

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.260
was to get 15 years ahead of the curve

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.620
so it was on purpose.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.750
But with immense success,

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.500
that he's done this.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.140
His detailed biography is in your program,

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.350
and I encourage your
reading all those details

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:40.230
of a distinguished career
in which he's made mark,

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.180
as a leading scholar and thinker

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.200
in my own field of history.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.770
He's a great authority

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.913
on questions of law and religion

00:02:51.913 --> 00:02:56.200
in Protestant Europe from
the early modern period

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.250
down to the present, he's
written on the First Amendment

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.853
as a constitutional scholar.

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.190
He teaches in these fields

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.870
and has also taught in
criminal law other fields

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.780
and has given lectures of this sort

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.090
and Dowd lectures, in which
an institution seeks to bring

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.960
the very top tier person in a given field

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.593
that many other just fine
institutions in this country.

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.590
And there's almost
latest book and 2009 book

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.823
on some themes that may
be touched on today,

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.490
called the Sins of the Gathers

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:32.103
on legitimacy, Issue of Illegitimacy.

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.070
There are two reviews that
I just like to quote briefly

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.460
because I couldn't say them better myself

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.360
and I couldn't say with
half the tenth the authority

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.940
that these people have said it.

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.750
David Ford, the Regis
professor of Divinity

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.420
Cambridge University refers to John Witte

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.670
as one of the world's foremost
thinkers on law and religion.

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.100
a man whose work is noted
for rigorous scholarship,

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.450
perceptive theology in wise reflections

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:07.450
on civic responsibility and
other aspects of the subject.

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.080
And David Novak, the Shiff
professor of Jewish Studies

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:15.560
at Toronto, says that
this book demonstrates

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.360
what we always expect from John Witte.

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:22.300
Painstaking historical
research, lucid presentation

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.070
plus jurisprudential and
theological gravitas.

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.550
And also the profound
humanity of this man.

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.290
Those of us, there are
many in law and history

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:35.890
and religious studies who are his friend,

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:39.240
would also say it's an
incomplete introduction

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.100
without referring to his
brilliance as a teacher

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.330
and his profound humanity.

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.620
So it with very great
pleasure that I present

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:53.800
Professor John Witte as this
semester's Jefferson Lecture

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.970
and he's gonna speak
on Sharia in the West.

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.630
What place for religious legal systems

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:03.051
in America and other
democracies, thank you.

00:05:03.051 --> 00:05:06.051
(audience clapping)

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:15.270
- Well thank you very
much Professor Scheiber

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.780
for your warm and very
generous introduction.

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.070
Good afternoon to each of you,

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.780
it's a great pleasure to be
back on this beautiful campus

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.440
and this lovely time of the year.

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.190
To have the chance to partake

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:27.810
of the intellectual Sparkle of this place,

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:30.820
and to enjoy the faculty and the students

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.780
whom I've had the privilege
to meet again here.

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:37.510
I wanna thank all of you for
taking the time to be with us

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:40.780
in the late afternoon when
beautiful skies beckon,

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:44.040
and the beach is closed
and margaritas are flowing

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.870
in some venue of the city.

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:48.460
I wanna thank Ellen
Gobler and her colleagues

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:50.970
for their special
choreography of this event

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:53.950
and the wonderful
hospitality they've accorded.

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:57.500
I wanna thank my dear
friend Harry Scheiber,

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.660
for the great hospitality
that he has accorded me

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:03.320
together with his wonderful bride Jane

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.130
for his brilliant
scholarship in legal history

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:08.170
and economic history, of which I

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:09.480
and many thousands of others

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:12.040
have been the happy beneficiaries,

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:14.430
and for his uncommon kindness to me

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:16.120
in the last decade and more.

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.030
And opening doors and opportunities

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:20.700
and inviting me to
participate in various things

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:24.350
not least this distinguished lectureship.

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:25.520
I wanna thank the members

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:29.270
of the Jefferson Lecture
Committee for their kindness

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:31.850
and lowering their
standards to allow an unripe

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:34.350
and unworthy youngster to stand before you

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:37.960
to deliver this lecture this afternoon.

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:40.450
As I was looking over the long roll

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:43.360
of distinguished speakers who
have stood here before me,

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:48.360
I could not help but feel a
sharp pang or two of inadequacy,

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:50.320
and I could not help but remember

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:54.090
the rather embarrassing
experience of my good friend Bryan

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:56.780
in our first year class
and contracts together

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:00.300
some 25 years ago at
the Harvard Law School.

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:01.450
The class was taught by

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:04.730
the Venerable Archibald
Cox of Watergate Fame,

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:07.000
master of Socratic dialogue and repartee

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:11.260
and I note a prior Jefferson lecturer.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.620
Bryan was a particularly gifted student,

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:14.980
he had been trained in rhetoric

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:16.910
and in drama at Radcliffe College,

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:19.300
he had been a national debating champion,

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:21.110
he had been a professional actor

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:23.470
even appearing in a part
and a play on Broadway

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:24.910
before Law School.

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:27.070
And so when Professor Cox called on Bryan

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:29.100
to recite the first case of the day,

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:33.020
Bryan initially held forth
with considerable aplomb.

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:36.290
Professor Cox of course had
only begun his interrogation.

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:38.730
And he began to press
his line of questions

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:41.720
a bit more closely, and
Bryan found that the answers

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.880
did not fall nearly so
easily off his tongue.

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:48.940
Cox became more insistent now
lashing out his Socratic whip

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:52.090
with increasing alacrity
and increasing accuracy.

00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:54.220
Bryan became more and more confused,

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:56.290
Cox became even more insistent

00:07:56.290 --> 00:07:58.840
and when the questions
threatened to overwhelm him,

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:02.120
Bryan summoned up the
little courage he had left

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:04.160
looked professor Cox on the eye

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:07.247
and repeated a line from his drama days,

00:08:07.247 --> 00:08:09.687
"Sir, I am afraid I am teetering

00:08:09.687 --> 00:08:13.370
"on the edge of the
abyss of my ignorance."

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:16.287
Cox's reply was instantaneous.

00:08:16.287 --> 00:08:20.649
"Young man you fell into
that abyss some time ago."

00:08:20.649 --> 00:08:22.110
(audience laughing)

00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:24.890
While standing up here
experimenting with questions

00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:28.630
at the edge of family
law and Islamic identity

00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:30.670
and religious freedom and women's rights,

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:32.790
and other fundamental rights,

00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:34.440
I too feel like I'm teetering

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:36.620
on the edge of the abyss of my ignorance,

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:39.270
and I shall leave it to
my friend Harry Scheiber

00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:41.353
to declare when I have fallen in.

00:08:43.557 --> 00:08:48.557
"On February 7, 2008 Anglican
Archbishop Rowan Williams

00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:51.530
set off an international firestorm,

00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:55.710
by suggesting that some
accommodation of Muslim family law

00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:59.050
was quote, "Unavoidable in England."

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:01.580
His suggestion though carefully qualified,

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:05.470
prompted more than 250
articles in the world press,

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:08.020
the vast majority denouncing it,

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:09.663
and denouncing the Archbishop.

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:13.760
England as critics charge will be resets

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:16.600
with licensed polygamy
and barbaric procedures

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:18.740
and brutal violence against women

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:21.570
encased in suffocating burkas.

00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:24.040
Muslim citizens of a Western democracy

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.340
will be subject to legally ghettoized

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:29.390
Muslim Court's immune from civil appeal

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:31.807
and constitutional challenge.

00:09:31.807 --> 00:09:34.347
"Consider Nigeria and Pakistan

00:09:34.347 --> 00:09:36.227
"and other former English colonies

00:09:36.227 --> 00:09:38.827
"that have sought to balance Muslim Sharia

00:09:38.827 --> 00:09:41.587
"with the common law,"
other critics added.

00:09:41.587 --> 00:09:45.457
"The horrific excesses and
chronic human rights violations

00:09:45.457 --> 00:09:48.537
"of these religious courts, even ordering

00:09:48.537 --> 00:09:51.627
"the faithful to stone
innocent rape victims

00:09:51.627 --> 00:09:54.117
"for dishonouring their families,

00:09:54.117 --> 00:09:57.107
"prove that religious laws and state laws

00:09:57.107 --> 00:10:01.117
"and marriage in the family
simply cannot coexist,

00:10:01.117 --> 00:10:05.333
"case closed," said the
Archbishop's critics.

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:09.990
This case won't stay
closed for long however.

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:12.010
The Archbishop was not necessarily

00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:13.510
calling for the establishment

00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:16.280
of independent Muslim courts in England,

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:19.950
let alone the enforcement
of Sharia by English courts.

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:23.600
He was instead raising
a whole series of hard

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:27.360
but unavoidable questions
about marital cultural

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:29.660
and religious identity and practice

00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:33.027
in Western democratic societies
committed to human rights

00:10:33.027 --> 00:10:35.700
and religious freedom for all.

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:40.530
What forms of marriage should
citizens be able to choose?

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:43.730
And what forums of religious marriage laws

00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:47.110
should states be required to respect?

00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:49.780
How should Muslims and
other religious minorities

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:53.400
with distinct family norms be accommodated

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:56.310
in a society dedicated
to religious liberty

00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:57.940
and self-determination,

00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:01.540
to religious equality
and non-discrimination?

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:04.150
Our legal pluralism, and perhaps even

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:07.130
a form of personal federalism necessary

00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:09.900
to protect Muslims and
other religious believers,

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:12.840
who are conscientiously
opposed to the liberal values

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:16.503
that now inform state laws
on sex, marriage and family.

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:21.830
These and other hard questions
are becoming unavoidable

00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:24.140
in many modern Western democracies

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:27.530
with growing and diverse
Muslim communities,

00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:32.530
each making new and ever louder
demands for accommodation.

00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:34.520
If current growth rates

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:37.400
of Muslim communities
in the West continue,

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:39.610
a generation or two from now

00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:42.360
the so-called Danish cartoon crisis

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:44.333
is gonna seem like child's play.

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:49.410
Even democratic countries that
share a common law heritage

00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:51.197
and a common commitment to human rights

00:11:51.197 --> 00:11:53.030
and religious freedom for all,

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:55.040
have taken quite different approaches

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:57.090
to these basic questions.

00:11:57.090 --> 00:12:01.510
Take three examples, England,
Canada, and the United States.

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:03.900
Of these, England has the largest group

00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:06.320
of religious Muslim minorities

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:09.710
and has been the most
accommodating of Muslim schools

00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:12.930
and charities, and banks
and arbitration tribunals

00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:15.530
that litigate and adjudicate

00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:18.430
the private issues of
their voluntary faithful.

00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:21.930
In particular, English courts
are increasingly upholding

00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:24.330
the arbitration Awards of Muslim tribunals

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:26.140
in marriage and family disputes,

00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:28.830
so long as all parties
consent to participate

00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:30.890
and so long as there is not a hint

00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:34.033
of any physical coercion
of any of the parties.

00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:38.040
The same deference is accorded
to the miracle arbitrations

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:39.840
of Jews, and Hindus and Christians

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:42.313
and other peaceable religious authorities.

00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:46.130
Canada, the most constitutionally liberal

00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:48.180
of these three common-law countries,

00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:50.980
debated seriously in the last decade.

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:54.717
The recognition of Sharia
marital tribunals in Ontario,

00:12:54.717 --> 00:12:56.900
and a bit in Quebec as well.

00:12:56.900 --> 00:13:00.640
But ultimately, after
ample cultural contestation

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:02.080
rejected them in favor

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:04.040
of single provincial laws and marriage

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:07.680
for all citizens Muslim,
and non-muslim alike.

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:10.420
But Canadian and Muslims
enjoy ample religious freedom

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:12.520
to engage in their own
worship and apparel,

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:15.630
education, banking,
religious rituals and more

00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:18.000
and have no other serious impediments

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.123
upon their religious group rights.

00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:24.290
The United States, though a sizeable

00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:26.530
and diverse Muslim populations

00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:30.640
has been the least accommodating
of its Muslim citizens.

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:33.830
American Muslim that against
have not fared well of late

00:13:33.830 --> 00:13:36.250
when they have challenged
state denials of charters

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:39.850
or exemptions for their
schools, charities or mosques.

00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:43.100
Nor have they often succeeded
in challenging prohibitions

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:45.190
to wear traditional religious apparel,

00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:47.010
from head scarves to burkas

00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:48.670
while teaching in public schools,

00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:53.250
or testifying in state courts
or serving in public places.

00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:56.060
Most Americans State courts
have only sporadically

00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:58.560
upheld private Muslim marriage contracts,

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:01.470
and that trend is in a downward direction.

00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:04.910
They have often sided with
non-muslims spouses in divorce

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:08.630
and child custody cases
involving mixed marriages.

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:11.467
They have always held a firm
line against Muslim polygamy

00:14:11.467 --> 00:14:14.960
and have granted shrinking deference

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:17.620
to arbitration awards
and mediation settlements

00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:20.690
when Muslim officials have been involved.

00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:23.940
But, American Muslims
have continued to agitate

00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:25.680
for greater religious freedom,

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:28.940
autonomy and
self-determination in marriage

00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:31.043
and related domestic subjects.

00:14:35.700 --> 00:14:39.700
It is no surprise that
it is the law of marriage

00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:43.500
and family life, that has
triggered this new contest

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:46.223
between law and religion
and Western democracies.

00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:48.940
For marriage has long been regarded

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:52.080
as both a legal and a
spiritual institution,

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:54.390
subject at once to special state laws

00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:56.060
of contract and property,

00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:59.440
and to special religious
canons and ceremonies.

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:01.570
Marriage has also been long regarded

00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:03.770
as the most primal institution

00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:06.360
of Western society and culture.

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:08.650
Aristotle and the Roman Stoics called

00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:11.850
the marital household, the
foundation of the polis

00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:14.580
and the private font of public virtue.

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:17.210
The Church Fathers and
medieval scholastics

00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:19.410
called it the seedbed of the city,

00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:22.640
the force that welds society together.

00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:25.110
Early modern protestants
called the household,

00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:27.870
a little church, a little
state, a little seminary.

00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:29.840
The first school of love and justice,

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:32.340
charity and citizenship.

00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:34.440
John Locke and the
Enlightenment Philosophers

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:37.100
called marriage the first
society to be formed

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:39.670
as men and women moved
from the state of nature

00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:41.180
to an organized society,

00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:45.003
dedicated to rule of law and
protection of natural rights.

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:48.250
Because of its cultural importance,

00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:50.930
marriage was also one of
the first institutions

00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:53.890
to be reformed during the decisive battles

00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:57.440
between church and state
in the history of the West.

00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:59.140
In the fourth and fifth centuries

00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:02.160
when Constantine and
his imperial successors

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:05.270
slowly converted the Roman
Empire to Christianity,

00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:09.000
they soon passed comprehensive
new marriage and family laws

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.600
predicated directly on Christian teachings

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:14.090
that gradually soaked into the Roman law.

00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:16.550
In the later 11th and 12th centuries

00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:18.880
when Pope Gregory VII, and his successors

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:20.650
threw off their civil rulers,

00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:22.390
and established a Catholic Church

00:16:22.390 --> 00:16:25.590
as an independent legal
authority in Western Christendom,

00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:28.230
the church seized jurisdiction,

00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:30.060
lawmaking power over marriage

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:32.900
calling it a sacrament
subject to the church courts

00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:36.140
and to the law of those
courts, the Canon Law.

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:38.420
In the 16th century, when Martin Luther,

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:40.140
Henry VIII, and other Protestants

00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:43.020
called for reforms of
church state and society,

00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:45.800
one of their first acts was to reject

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:47.237
the Catholic Canon Law of marriage

00:16:47.237 --> 00:16:50.020
and the sacramental
theology that supported it,

00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:53.260
and to transfer principal
legal authority over marriage

00:16:53.260 --> 00:16:55.460
to the Christian magistrate.

00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:58.610
In the later 18th century,
when the French revolutionaries

00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:01.670
unleashed their fury against
traditional institutions

00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:03.310
they took early aim

00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:06.270
at the Catholic Church's
complex marital rules

00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:09.060
and rules and rituals consigning marriage

00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:12.390
to the rule of secular
state authorities alone.

00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:14.230
And in the early 20th century,

00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:17.300
when the Bolsheviks completed
their revolution in Russia,

00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:20.750
one of Lenin's first acts was to abolish

00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:22.880
the legal institution of marriage

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:24.630
as the bourgeois impediment

00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:26.883
to the realization of true communism.

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:31.160
Modern Western democracies
have not abolished

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:32.940
marriage as a legal category,

00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:35.260
but they have dramatically privatized it

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:38.580
and thinned out many of
its traditional elements.

00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:41.750
Half a century ago or
so, most western states

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:44.350
treated marriage as a public institution

00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:46.200
in which Church, State and society

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:48.300
were all deeply invested.

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:51.010
With ample variation across jurisdictions

00:17:51.010 --> 00:17:53.920
most Western states in
the middle 20th century

00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:55.750
still generally defined marriage

00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:58.540
as a presumptively
permanent monogamous union,

00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:00.640
between a fit man and a fit woman,

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:04.330
with capacity and freedom
to marry each other.

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:07.600
A typical state law required
that engagements be formal

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:09.240
and that marriages be contracted

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:11.390
with parental consent and witnesses

00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:13.600
after a suitable waiting period.

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:16.310
It required marriage
licenses and registration

00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:18.810
and solemnization before officials.

00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:21.100
It prohibited sex and
marriage between couples

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:23.750
related by various blood and family ties,

00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:26.340
identified in the Mosaic law.

00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:27.770
Couples who sought to divorce

00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:31.140
had to publicize their
intentions to petition a court

00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:33.470
to show adequate cause or faults

00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:36.910
to make provision for
dependent spouses and children.

00:18:36.910 --> 00:18:39.780
Criminal laws, outlawed
fornication, adultery,

00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:42.150
sodomy, contraception, abortion

00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:45.150
and other perceived sexual offenses.

00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:47.770
Tort laws held third parties liable

00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:51.130
for seduction, enticement,
lost a consortium,

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:53.803
alienation of affections of one spouse.

00:18:55.210 --> 00:18:58.910
Today by contrast, a
private contractual view

00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:00.570
of sex, marriage and family life

00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:02.560
has come to dominate the West.

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:04.790
With little constructive role left to play

00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:08.320
for parents or peers or
religious or political officials.

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:10.070
Marriage is now generally treated

00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:13.070
as a private bilateral
contract to be formed,

00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:16.110
maintained and dissolved
as the couple sees fit.

00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:19.150
Private prenuptial, marital
and separation contracts

00:19:19.150 --> 00:19:22.120
that allow parties to define
their own rights and duties,

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:24.170
within the marital estate and thereafter

00:19:24.170 --> 00:19:26.500
a gained increasing acceptance.

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:28.640
No-fault divorce statutes have reduced

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:31.400
the divorce proceeding
to an expensive formality

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:33.890
and largely obliterated the procedural

00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:37.560
and substantive distinctions
between annulment and divorce.

00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:41.100
Payments of alimony, non-going
forms a post marital support

00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:42.990
to dependent spouses and children

00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:45.150
are giving way to privately negotiated

00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:47.100
lump sum property exchanges,

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:51.010
providing a clean break
for parties to start anew.

00:19:51.010 --> 00:19:52.310
The functional distinctions

00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:54.990
between the rights of the
married and the unmarried couple,

00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:56.810
the straight and the gay partnership

00:19:56.810 --> 00:19:59.790
had been considerably narrowed
by an array of new statutes

00:19:59.790 --> 00:20:01.920
in constitutional cases.

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:04.730
Virtually all, traditional sex crimes

00:20:04.730 --> 00:20:08.720
save incest and polygamy have
been constitutionally outlawed

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:10.473
or become dead letters.

00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:15.050
These exponential legal changes
in the past half-century

00:20:15.050 --> 00:20:19.250
have in part been efforts
to bring equity and equality

00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:21.050
within marriage and society,

00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:23.750
and to stamp out the
patriarchy paternalism

00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:26.240
and claim prudishness of the past.

00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:29.730
These legal changes are also
in part simple reflections

00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:32.010
of the exponential
changes that have occurred

00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:35.380
in the cultural and condition
of Western families.

00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:36.640
The stunning advances

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:39.210
in reproductive and medical technology,

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:41.820
the exposure to vastly
different perceptions

00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:43.410
of sexuality and kinship

00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:46.000
born of globalization and immigration.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.710
The explosion of international

00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:49.840
and domestic norms of human rights,

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:52.980
particularly gender rights
and children's rights.

00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:54.740
The implosion of the traditional,

00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:56.980
nuclear family born of new economic

00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:59.980
and professional opportunities for adults.

00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:02.270
But more fundamentally,
these legal changes

00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:06.370
represent the rise of a new
theory of private ordering

00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:09.380
of the domestic sphere,
and the gradual growth

00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:13.100
of a new democratization of desire.

00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:16.630
A fantastic range of
literature has emerged

00:21:16.630 --> 00:21:21.570
in the past four decades,
vigorously describing, defending

00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:24.453
or decrying these legal changes.

00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:28.740
Many Muslims living in the West,

00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:32.670
decry these massive changes
to prevailing state laws

00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:36.273
of sex, marriage and family
life and they want out.

00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:39.050
Some Muslims have just gone back

00:21:39.050 --> 00:21:41.300
to their Muslim majority homelands,

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:42.910
shaking their heads in dismay

00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:45.880
at what Western libertinism is wrought.

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:49.130
Others have stayed put and quietly ignored

00:21:49.130 --> 00:21:50.870
the State's marriage and family law

00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:53.120
using the shelter of constitutional laws

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:55.400
of privacy and sexual autonomy,

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:59.400
to become in effect a law into themselves.

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:02.620
Others have developed
elaborate, premarital contracts

00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:06.710
that seek to exempt Muslim
couples for much of the state law

00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:09.460
in favor of internal norms and practices

00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:12.010
of their own religious communities.

00:22:12.010 --> 00:22:15.300
And still others have
led by cultural lives,

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:17.680
dividing their time between Western homes

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:20.260
and Muslim majority lands that allow them

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:23.030
to form a Muslim marriage in a family,

00:22:23.030 --> 00:22:26.700
including such an institution
that licenses polygamy,

00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:29.003
patriarchy and primogenitor.

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:32.970
All of these informal methods

00:22:32.970 --> 00:22:36.570
of cultural and legal coexistence however,

00:22:36.570 --> 00:22:39.980
can only be temporary expedience.

00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:44.270
These creaky accommodations
and concessions that now exist

00:22:44.270 --> 00:22:48.560
in various Western lands for
Muslim citizens and subjects

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:51.040
can easily fall apart.

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:54.270
Eventually, a Muslim citizen
will appeal to the State

00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:57.150
for relief from a
religious marriage contract

00:22:57.150 --> 00:22:58.810
or a religious family practice

00:22:58.810 --> 00:23:03.050
that he or she cannot
abide, but cannot escape.

00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:06.510
Eventually an Imam or
a shadow Sharia Court

00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:08.800
operating in the West will overstep,

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:11.760
by using force or issuing
a fatwa that draws

00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:15.800
the ire of the media and the
scrutiny of a state official.

00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:19.110
Eventually an aggressive
State caseworker or prosecutor

00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:21.450
will move upon a Muslim household,

00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:25.230
bringing charges of coerced
or polygamous marriage.

00:23:25.230 --> 00:23:27.570
Eventually a Muslim school or charity

00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:29.420
will find itself in court,

00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:31.950
faced with a suit for
gender discrimination

00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:34.530
or with child abuse, owing to its practice

00:23:34.530 --> 00:23:36.230
of single sex education

00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:39.020
and corporal punishment in the school.

00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:41.320
Eventually another major media event

00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:44.290
like that surrounding
Rowan Williams stray,

00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:47.920
unavoidable accommodation comment of 2008

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:49.990
will bring a bright spotlight back

00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:52.550
on Western Muslim communities.

00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:56.630
And once such a major
case in controversy breaks

00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:59.410
and the international media gets involved,

00:23:59.410 --> 00:24:01.080
many of these informal

00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:03.120
and temporary domestic arrangements

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:06.100
for Muslims, might well unravel,

00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:09.630
particularly given the cultural
backlash against Muslims

00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:14.630
prompted by 9/11, 77 Fort
Hood and the unpopular wars

00:24:14.770 --> 00:24:16.960
against Islamist extremism

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:20.043
in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere.

00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:24.760
It's precisely this vulnerability

00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:27.520
that advocates of faith-based family law

00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:31.930
and Sharia Courts want to avert.

00:24:31.930 --> 00:24:34.120
They want to put Sharia,

00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:36.860
the family law of the Muslim community

00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:40.230
and it's voluntary use
by the Muslim faithful

00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:44.520
on firmer constitutional and
cultural ground in the West.

00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:48.250
But rather than denouncing
Western liberalism,

00:24:48.250 --> 00:24:51.380
and the sexual moral and marital lassitude

00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:53.797
it has purportedly occasioned.

00:24:53.797 --> 00:24:57.740
Sophisticated advocates now
press their case for Sharia

00:24:57.740 --> 00:25:02.450
in and on the very terms of
Western constitutionalism

00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:05.060
and political liberalism.

00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:07.040
Three main arguments are part

00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:10.530
of the literature today
at the cutting edge.

00:25:10.530 --> 00:25:12.770
The first part of the case for Sharia

00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:15.540
is an argument for religious freedom.

00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:17.550
Both Western constitutional laws

00:25:17.550 --> 00:25:19.520
and international human rights norms

00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:22.300
give robust protection
to the religious freedom

00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:24.390
of individuals and groups.

00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:26.140
Why, the argument goes,

00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:28.120
should peaceable Muslim citizens

00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:31.480
not be given freedom to
opt out of state laws

00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:33.140
on sex, marriage and family,

00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:35.750
that run afoul of their
core claims of conscience

00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:38.790
and central commandments of their faith?

00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:41.610
Why should they not have
the freedom to choose

00:25:41.610 --> 00:25:43.710
to exercise their domestic lives

00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:45.010
in accordance with the norms

00:25:45.010 --> 00:25:48.240
of their own voluntary
religious communities?

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:50.360
Why doesn't freedom of religion

00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:53.200
provide a sincere Muslim with protection,

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:55.500
against a unilateral divorce action

00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:58.340
or a child custody order by a state court

00:25:58.340 --> 00:26:01.313
that directly contradicts
the rules of Sharia?

00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:05.340
Why doesn't freedom of religious exercise

00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:08.140
empower a pious Muslim man,

00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:11.620
to take four wives into
his loving permanent care

00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:13.730
in imitation of the Prophet,

00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:17.530
particularly when his secular
counterpart can consort

00:26:17.530 --> 00:26:20.580
and cavort freely with four women at once

00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:22.493
and then walk out scot free?

00:26:24.370 --> 00:26:26.460
The second part of the case for Sharia

00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:29.500
is an argument for religious equality

00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:31.023
and non-discrimination.

00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:34.440
After all many Western Christians

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:38.550
do have religious tribunals to
govern their internal affairs

00:26:38.550 --> 00:26:41.820
including some of the family
matters of their faithful,

00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:44.560
and state courts will generally
respect their judgments

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:46.240
even if these cases are appealed

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:49.320
to Rome or Canterbury or Moscow.

00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:52.540
No one is talking of
abolishing these church courts

00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:54.500
or even trimming their power,

00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:58.100
even after recent discoveries
of grave financial abuses

00:26:58.100 --> 00:27:01.200
and cover-ups of clerical
sexual abuse of children

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:03.510
in selected churches.

00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:06.070
No one seems to think that
these Christian tribunals

00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:07.700
are illegitimate when some of them

00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:10.050
discriminate against women, in decisions

00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:12.963
say about ordination or church leadership.

00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:18.390
Similarly Jews, are given
wide authority to operate

00:27:18.390 --> 00:27:20.280
their own Jewish law courts,

00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:23.870
to arbitrate marital and
financial and other disputes

00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:26.500
among the Orthodox Jewish faithful.

00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:30.160
Indeed in New York State by
statute and several other states

00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:32.830
and European nations by custom,

00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:36.730
courts will not issue a civil
divorce to a Jewish couple

00:27:36.730 --> 00:27:39.690
unless and until the Beth Din,

00:27:39.690 --> 00:27:43.410
the Jewish law court
issues a religious divorce.

00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:46.410
Even though Jewish law
systematically discriminates

00:27:46.410 --> 00:27:49.700
against the wife's right to divorce.

00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:52.040
If Christians can have their Canon laws

00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:53.330
and consistory courts,

00:27:53.330 --> 00:27:56.410
if Jews can have their
Halacha and beth din,

00:27:56.410 --> 00:27:58.447
and if even indigenous peoples,

00:27:58.447 --> 00:28:01.850
can have their ancestral
laws and tribal rulers

00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:04.850
why can't Muslims be treated equally

00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:08.423
in their use of Sharia and Islamic Courts?

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:12.120
The third part of the case for Sharia

00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:15.680
is an argument from political liberalism.

00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:17.590
One of the most basic teachings

00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:19.720
of classical liberalism in the West,

00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:22.360
is that marriage is a pre political,

00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:24.750
a pre legal institution.

00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:26.930
Marriage is not created by the State,

00:28:26.930 --> 00:28:30.470
it comes before the state
and it's positive laws

00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:35.260
both in historical development
and in ontological priority.

00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:37.030
As John Locke put it famously

00:28:37.030 --> 00:28:38.950
in his two treatises on government,

00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:42.120
the marital contract
was the first contract

00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:45.220
and the first society to
be formed as men and women

00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:47.640
came forth from the state of nature.

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:50.350
The broader social contract came later

00:28:50.350 --> 00:28:53.310
presupposing stable marital contracts.

00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:56.250
And contracts deformed state governments

00:28:56.250 --> 00:28:59.690
and religious communities and
other voluntary associations

00:28:59.690 --> 00:29:04.223
within this broader contract
as society came later still.

00:29:05.150 --> 00:29:08.870
Why on this simple contractarian logic

00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:12.230
should the State get
exclusive jurisdiction

00:29:12.230 --> 00:29:14.620
lawmaking power over marriage?

00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:17.830
After all, it was 16th century Protestants

00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:20.760
not 18th century
enlightenment philosophers

00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:25.430
who first vested the state
with marital jurisdiction.

00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:27.730
But why is state jurisdiction

00:29:27.730 --> 00:29:31.690
over marriage mandatory or even necessary?

00:29:31.690 --> 00:29:34.900
Before the 16th century
Protestant Reformation,

00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:36.890
and in a number of Catholic lands,

00:29:36.890 --> 00:29:40.860
well after the Reformation
to the Catholic canon law

00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:44.290
and Catholic Church
Courts, govern marriage.

00:29:44.290 --> 00:29:47.870
Moreover, even in Protestant
England until the 19th century

00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:51.300
the state delegated to
ecclesiastical courts

00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:55.730
the power to treat discrete
marriage and family issues.

00:29:55.730 --> 00:29:58.160
There is evidently nothing inherent

00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:01.050
in the structure of Western
marriage and family law

00:30:01.050 --> 00:30:05.430
that it requires it to be
administered by the State,

00:30:05.430 --> 00:30:07.470
And there's nothing ineluctable

00:30:07.470 --> 00:30:10.250
in liberalism's contractarian logic

00:30:10.250 --> 00:30:13.950
that requires marital
couples to choose the State

00:30:13.950 --> 00:30:15.620
rather than their own families

00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:18.120
or their own religious communities

00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:20.750
to govern their domestic lives,

00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:24.430
particularly when the
state's liberal rules diverge

00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:29.070
so widely from their own
religious beliefs and practices.

00:30:29.070 --> 00:30:30.800
On this latter argument,

00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:33.840
conservative Muslims sometimes join hands

00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:36.780
with selected conservative Christians

00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:39.080
and selected critical liberals

00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:43.630
who call for exemption from,
if not the abolition of

00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:45.480
state marriage law.

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:47.170
Conservative Christians,

00:30:47.170 --> 00:30:49.780
because the state has purportedly betrayed

00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:53.180
traditional Christian
teachings on marriage.

00:30:53.180 --> 00:30:56.320
Critical liberals, because
the state has purportedly

00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:58.800
continued to encroach too much

00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:02.123
on individual privacy and sexual autonomy.

00:31:03.710 --> 00:31:05.740
So, those are the three big arguments

00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:07.940
religious freedom, religious equality

00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:10.720
and this contractarian argument.

00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:13.940
Let's sort them out and try to give

00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:15.703
some preliminary answers.

00:31:17.315 --> 00:31:20.160
The problem with the
first pro Sharia argument

00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:23.670
from religious freedom,
is that it falsely assumes

00:31:23.670 --> 00:31:27.390
that claims of conscience and
freedom of religious exercise

00:31:27.390 --> 00:31:31.270
must always trump, but
that's hardly the case

00:31:31.270 --> 00:31:32.790
in modern democracies,

00:31:32.790 --> 00:31:36.310
even though religious
freedom is amply cherished.

00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:39.770
Even the most sincere and
zealous conscientious objectors

00:31:39.770 --> 00:31:42.710
must pay their taxes,
register their properties,

00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:45.180
answer their subpoenas,
obey their court orders,

00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:48.300
swear the roads or give
other forms of veracity

00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:50.530
and abide by many other general laws

00:31:50.530 --> 00:31:51.810
for the common good

00:31:51.810 --> 00:31:55.650
that they may not in good
conscience wish to abide.

00:31:55.650 --> 00:31:57.840
Their eventual choice if they persist

00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:00.590
in their claims of consciousness
is to leave the country,

00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:02.373
or to go to prison for contempt.

00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:06.860
Moreover, even the most
devout religious believer

00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:09.600
has no religious exemption claim

00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:13.340
from criminal laws for
activities like polygamy

00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:16.400
or child marriage, or
female genital mutilation

00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:19.270
or corporal discipline of wives

00:32:19.270 --> 00:32:22.460
or coerced marriage of young daughters,

00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:26.060
even if their particular brand
of Sharia might command it

00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:30.020
or their particular religious
community might commend it.

00:32:30.020 --> 00:32:31.600
The guarantee of religious freedom

00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:33.993
is not a license to engage in crime.

00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:37.920
Muslims who are conscientiously opposed

00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:40.790
to the liberalism of Western laws

00:32:40.790 --> 00:32:42.110
of sex, marriage and family

00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:45.090
are certainly free to ignore them.

00:32:45.090 --> 00:32:50.090
They can live chaste private
lives in accordance with Sharia

00:32:50.330 --> 00:32:54.010
and not register their religious
marriages with the state,

00:32:54.010 --> 00:32:56.010
that choice will generally be protected

00:32:56.010 --> 00:32:59.360
by the constitutional rights
of privacy and sexual autonomy

00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:02.940
so long as that conduct
is truly consensual.

00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:06.180
But that choice also leaves
their family entirely

00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:08.430
without the protections,
rights and privileges

00:33:08.430 --> 00:33:11.970
available through the state's
complex laws and regulations

00:33:11.970 --> 00:33:13.470
not only of marriage and family,

00:33:13.470 --> 00:33:16.060
but also marital property and inheritance,

00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:19.720
social welfare, life insurance,
Social Security benefits

00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:21.380
and much, much more.

00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:23.370
And if minor children are involved,

00:33:23.370 --> 00:33:25.270
the state will intervene to ensure

00:33:25.270 --> 00:33:27.440
their protection support and education

00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:30.720
and will hear nothing of
religious freedom objections

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:31.810
from their parents

00:33:31.810 --> 00:33:34.890
or from the communities religious leaders.

00:33:34.890 --> 00:33:36.230
Western Muslims enjoy

00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:39.050
the same religious
freedom as everyone else,

00:33:39.050 --> 00:33:41.140
but some of the special accommodations

00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:44.730
pressed by some Muslim
Sharia advocates today,

00:33:44.730 --> 00:33:46.570
in the name of religious freedom

00:33:46.570 --> 00:33:51.300
are simply beyond the pale
for most Western democracies.

00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:52.960
Even further beyond the pale,

00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:55.630
is the notion of granting
a religious group

00:33:55.630 --> 00:33:59.580
legal sovereignty over the
sex, marriage and family lives

00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:02.550
of their voluntary members.

00:34:02.550 --> 00:34:05.060
It's one thing to allow
religious officials

00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:08.370
to officiate at weddings
or testify in divorce cases

00:34:08.370 --> 00:34:10.700
or assist in the adoption of a child,

00:34:10.700 --> 00:34:14.780
or facilitate the rescue of
a distressed family member.

00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:17.820
Most Western democracies
readily grant Muslims

00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:20.130
and any other peaceable
religious communities

00:34:20.130 --> 00:34:22.510
such ready accommodations.

00:34:22.510 --> 00:34:24.600
Some democracies only a few

00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:27.500
will also uphold the
religious arbitration awards

00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:31.410
and mediation settlements,
over discrete domestic issues

00:34:31.410 --> 00:34:33.440
that are engineered by Muslim

00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:35.600
and other religious authorities,

00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:38.480
but that's a long way
from asking the state

00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:42.460
to delegate to a religious
group the full legal power

00:34:42.460 --> 00:34:45.550
to govern the domestic
affairs of their members,

00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:48.750
in accordance with their
own religious laws.

00:34:48.750 --> 00:34:52.240
No democratic state,
can readily accommodate

00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:54.480
a competing sovereign to govern

00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:58.070
such a vital area of
life for its citizens.

00:34:58.070 --> 00:35:01.480
Especially since family
law is so interwoven

00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:02.900
with so many other public,

00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:05.630
private, penal and procedural laws

00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:07.970
and especially since so many other rights

00:35:07.970 --> 00:35:10.220
and duties of citizens turn

00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:13.850
on a person's marital or familial status.

00:35:13.850 --> 00:35:17.300
Putting aside the formidable
First Amendment obstacles

00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:20.450
to such a delegation of core state power,

00:35:20.450 --> 00:35:22.650
to a private religious body,

00:35:22.650 --> 00:35:27.650
surely a democratic citizens
status rights and entitlements

00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:31.850
cannot turn on the judgments
of a religious authority

00:35:31.850 --> 00:35:33.810
that has none of the due process

00:35:33.810 --> 00:35:38.510
and other procedural constraints
of a government tribunal.

00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:42.890
Moreover, the proud
claims of Muslim advocates

00:35:42.890 --> 00:35:47.530
that Sharia provides a
time-tested and comprehensive law

00:35:47.530 --> 00:35:51.220
governing all aspects of
sex, marriage and family life

00:35:51.220 --> 00:35:54.540
is for some an even stronger strike

00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:57.577
against its accommodation by the state.

00:35:57.577 --> 00:36:00.077
"Once a state takes the first step

00:36:00.077 --> 00:36:03.387
"down that slippery
slope," skeptics argue,

00:36:03.387 --> 00:36:05.587
"There will eventually be little to stop

00:36:05.587 --> 00:36:09.467
"the gradual accretion
of a rival religious law

00:36:09.467 --> 00:36:11.737
"over sex, marriage and family life.

00:36:11.737 --> 00:36:14.207
"Particularly as Muslim
communities grow larger

00:36:14.207 --> 00:36:17.030
"and more politically powerful."

00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:21.310
Some Western states thus resist
even religious arbitration

00:36:21.310 --> 00:36:23.500
and mediation of marital disputes

00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:25.780
involving Muslim officials.

00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:29.440
We saw last year Oklahoma passed
a constitutional amendment

00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:31.947
saying, "Sharia does
not apply in our state."

00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:35.140
Nine additional states
are now contemplating

00:36:35.140 --> 00:36:37.040
such anti Sharia measures.

00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:40.350
Six European nations have
those under advisement

00:36:40.350 --> 00:36:43.923
at the national level,
that trend will continue.

00:36:45.090 --> 00:36:50.090
The pro Sharia argument from
liberal contractarian logic,

00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:51.327
the argument that says,

00:36:51.327 --> 00:36:54.277
"Since marital contracts
are pre political,

00:36:54.277 --> 00:36:57.197
"coming before the contracts
that form the state,

00:36:57.197 --> 00:36:59.957
"the society or religious associations

00:36:59.957 --> 00:37:02.247
"marital parties should be free to choose

00:37:02.247 --> 00:37:04.020
"whose laws govern them."

00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:08.730
That argument is clever,
but deliberately incomplete.

00:37:08.730 --> 00:37:11.360
It ignores another elementary teaching

00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:15.290
of classical liberalism,
namely that only the state

00:37:15.290 --> 00:37:17.570
and no other social or private union

00:37:17.570 --> 00:37:20.603
can hold the coercive power of the sword.

00:37:21.490 --> 00:37:24.130
The government contract does grant

00:37:24.130 --> 00:37:27.010
this coercive power over individuals,

00:37:27.010 --> 00:37:29.850
but only in exchange for strict guarantees

00:37:29.850 --> 00:37:33.230
of due process of law equal
protection under the law

00:37:33.230 --> 00:37:35.250
and respect for the fundamental rights

00:37:35.250 --> 00:37:37.680
of citizens and subjects.

00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:41.060
A comprehensive system of
marriage and family law,

00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:44.150
let alone the many other
correlative legal systems

00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:46.990
of inheritance and trusts
and family property.

00:37:46.990 --> 00:37:48.550
Children's rights, education,

00:37:48.550 --> 00:37:50.760
Social Welfare and much more,

00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:54.740
cannot long operate without coercive power

00:37:54.740 --> 00:37:57.380
given the transience and the porousness

00:37:57.380 --> 00:37:59.580
of our modern communities.

00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:03.570
Such a law needs police,
prosecutors and prisons,

00:38:03.570 --> 00:38:06.060
subpoenas, fines and contempt orders.

00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:09.740
Material, physical and
even corporal sanctions.

00:38:09.740 --> 00:38:12.830
Moral suasion and example
communal approbation

00:38:12.830 --> 00:38:16.330
and censure could certainly
do part of the work.

00:38:16.330 --> 00:38:18.370
But a properly functioning marriage

00:38:18.370 --> 00:38:21.350
and family law system in a modern society

00:38:21.350 --> 00:38:23.600
requires resort to all these

00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:26.030
coercive instruments of government.

00:38:26.030 --> 00:38:29.820
And only the states and
not a religious body

00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:33.540
can properly use these
coercive instruments

00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:35.200
in a modern democracy,

00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:38.403
again with strict due process constraints.

00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:43.430
The pro Sharia argument
from religious equality

00:38:43.430 --> 00:38:45.380
and non-discrimination.

00:38:45.380 --> 00:38:49.680
Because Jews and Christians
have their religious tribunals,

00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:51.720
we should have them too.

00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:54.883
Takes a good bit more effort to parry.

00:38:56.180 --> 00:38:58.230
A useful starting point is the quip

00:38:58.230 --> 00:39:01.747
of Supreme Court justice
Oliver Wendell Holmes jr.

00:39:01.747 --> 00:39:06.677
"The life of the law has not
been logic but experience."

00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:11.230
This old adage has bearing on this issue.

00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:12.980
The current accommodations made

00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:15.920
to the religious legal
systems of Christians and Jews

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:18.110
First Peoples and others in the West,

00:39:18.110 --> 00:39:20.060
were not born overnight,

00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:22.030
they came only after centuries

00:39:22.030 --> 00:39:25.090
of sometimes hard and cruel experience

00:39:25.090 --> 00:39:28.050
with gradual adjustments
and accommodations

00:39:28.050 --> 00:39:30.440
made on both sides.

00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:33.510
The accommodation of and by Jewish law

00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:35.680
to Western secular law,

00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:39.250
is particularly
instructive in this regard.

00:39:39.250 --> 00:39:43.010
It is discomforting, but
essential to remember

00:39:43.010 --> 00:39:46.220
that Jews were the perennial
pariahs of the West

00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:48.210
for nearly two millennia.

00:39:48.210 --> 00:39:50.840
Consigned at best to second-class status

00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:54.350
and periodically subject
to waves of brutality

00:39:54.350 --> 00:39:56.620
whether imposed by Germanic purges,

00:39:56.620 --> 00:39:59.630
medieval pogroms, early modern massacres

00:39:59.630 --> 00:40:02.270
or the 20th century Holocaust.

00:40:02.270 --> 00:40:04.710
Jews have been in perennial diaspora

00:40:04.710 --> 00:40:06.500
after the destruction of Jerusalem

00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:09.050
in the year 70 of the Common Era.

00:40:09.050 --> 00:40:11.640
Living in a wide variety of legal cultures

00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:13.623
in the West, and well beyond.

00:40:14.530 --> 00:40:17.280
One important legal technique of survival

00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:19.850
that Jewish communities developed

00:40:19.850 --> 00:40:22.420
after the third century of the Common Era,

00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:25.850
was the concept of Dina d'Malkhuta dina,

00:40:25.850 --> 00:40:29.300
the law of the community, is our law.

00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:31.080
This meant that Jews accepted

00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:33.790
the secular law of the legitimate

00:40:33.790 --> 00:40:36.690
and peaceful secular
ruler who hosted them,

00:40:36.690 --> 00:40:40.040
as the law of their own Jewish community,

00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:44.640
so long as it did not conflict
with core Jewish laws.

00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:47.550
This technique allowed
Jewish communities over time

00:40:47.550 --> 00:40:50.530
to sort out which of
their own religious laws

00:40:50.530 --> 00:40:53.570
were indispensable,
which more discretionary.

00:40:53.570 --> 00:40:57.160
Which secular laws and
practices could be accommodated

00:40:57.160 --> 00:41:01.810
which had to be resisted even
at the risk of life and limb.

00:41:01.810 --> 00:41:04.900
This technique not only
led to ample innovation

00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:08.820
and diversity of Jewish law
over time and across culture,

00:41:08.820 --> 00:41:12.160
it also gave Jews the ability to survive

00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:14.850
and even to grow legally even in the face

00:41:14.850 --> 00:41:17.283
of ample and bitter persecution.

00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:21.160
Western democracies in turn,

00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:23.930
particularly in the
aftermath of the Holocaust

00:41:23.930 --> 00:41:26.910
and impartial recompense for the horrors

00:41:26.910 --> 00:41:28.960
it visited on the Jews,

00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:31.530
have gradually come to accommodate

00:41:31.530 --> 00:41:34.500
core Jewish laws and practices.

00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:37.600
But it's only in the past two generations

00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:40.600
and only after endless
litigation and lobbying

00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:42.900
in state courts and legislatures,

00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:45.500
that Western Jews have finally gained

00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:47.610
legal ground to stand on.

00:41:47.610 --> 00:41:50.270
And even that ground is still thin,

00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:53.730
and crumbles at the edges at times.

00:41:53.730 --> 00:41:56.150
Today Western Jews generally have freedom

00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:58.560
to receive Sabbath day accommodations,

00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:00.680
to gain access to kosher food

00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:03.250
to Don yarmulkes and distinctive grooming

00:42:03.250 --> 00:42:05.340
and other forms of religious dress

00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:08.410
in most public places
to gain zoning land use

00:42:08.410 --> 00:42:12.590
and building charters, for
their schools and charities

00:42:12.590 --> 00:42:15.000
and synagogues to offer single sex

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:18.960
and bilingual education
in those schools and more.

00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:23.960
And Jewish law courts have
gained the right to decide

00:42:24.070 --> 00:42:27.910
some of the domestic and financial
affairs of their faithful

00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:30.050
who voluntarily elect to arbitrate

00:42:30.050 --> 00:42:33.310
their disputes before
them, rather than suing

00:42:33.310 --> 00:42:38.010
a fellow Jewish brother and
sister in a secular Court.

00:42:38.010 --> 00:42:41.760
These Jewish law courts are
attractive to Jewish disputants

00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:46.080
because they are staffed
by highly trained jurists

00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:48.750
conversant with both
Jewish and secular law

00:42:48.750 --> 00:42:51.410
and sensitive to the bi-cultural issues

00:42:51.410 --> 00:42:53.740
that are being negotiated.

00:42:53.740 --> 00:42:56.900
Unlike their medieval and
early modern predecessors

00:42:56.900 --> 00:43:00.420
these modern Jewish law
courts claim no authority

00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:03.770
over all Jewish sex,
marriage and family life

00:43:03.770 --> 00:43:06.480
leaving many issues to the state.

00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:09.480
And these Jewish law
courts have also abandoned

00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:11.130
their traditional authority,

00:43:11.130 --> 00:43:16.100
to impose physical coercion or
sanctions on the disputants.

00:43:16.100 --> 00:43:20.370
In particular they claim no
authority beyond persuasion

00:43:20.370 --> 00:43:23.950
to stop a disputant from
simply walking out of the court

00:43:23.950 --> 00:43:27.273
and out of the Jewish
community, altogether.

00:43:29.290 --> 00:43:31.490
The modern lessons in this story

00:43:31.490 --> 00:43:34.593
for Sharia advocates are four.

00:43:35.770 --> 00:43:38.890
First, it takes time and patience

00:43:38.890 --> 00:43:42.050
for a secular legal system to adjust

00:43:42.050 --> 00:43:45.430
to the realities and needs
of new religious groups

00:43:45.430 --> 00:43:49.240
and to make the necessary
legal accommodations.

00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:51.030
The hard one accommodations

00:43:51.030 --> 00:43:54.290
that modern Jewish law
and culture now enjoy,

00:43:54.290 --> 00:43:56.790
are not fungible commodities

00:43:56.790 --> 00:43:58.760
that Muslims or any others can claim

00:43:58.760 --> 00:44:02.090
with a simple argument from equality.

00:44:02.090 --> 00:44:06.100
These are individualized
equitable cultural adjustments

00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:10.920
to general laws that each
community needs to earn for itself

00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:14.940
based on its own needs
and its own experiences.

00:44:14.940 --> 00:44:19.940
Muslims simply do not have the
same history of persecution

00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:22.200
that the Jews have faced in the West,

00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:25.620
and simply do not yet have
a long enough track record

00:44:25.620 --> 00:44:28.240
of litigation and lobbying.

00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:31.740
Concessions and accommodations will come

00:44:31.740 --> 00:44:35.973
but only with time, with
persistence, with patience.

00:44:37.490 --> 00:44:41.080
Second, it takes
flexibility and innovation

00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:43.490
on the part of the religious community,

00:44:43.490 --> 00:44:48.320
to win accommodations from
secular laws and cultures.

00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:52.030
Not every religious belief
can be claimed as central,

00:44:52.030 --> 00:44:56.290
not every religious practice
can be worth dying for.

00:44:56.290 --> 00:44:59.250
Over time and of necessity,

00:44:59.250 --> 00:45:02.210
diaspora Jewish communities
learn to distinguish

00:45:02.210 --> 00:45:05.100
between what was core
and what more penumbral,

00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:08.030
what was essential and
what more discretionary

00:45:08.030 --> 00:45:11.430
to Jewish legal and cultural identity.

00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:14.160
Over time and only grudgingly,

00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:17.040
Western democracies learned to accommodate

00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:19.810
the core religious beliefs and practices

00:45:19.810 --> 00:45:22.750
of Jewish communities and citizens.

00:45:22.750 --> 00:45:25.690
Diaspora Muslim communities in the West

00:45:25.690 --> 00:45:27.780
need to do the same.

00:45:27.780 --> 00:45:29.480
Islamic laws and cultures

00:45:29.480 --> 00:45:33.180
have changed dramatically
over time and across cultures,

00:45:33.180 --> 00:45:37.030
and modern-day Islam now
features immense variety

00:45:37.030 --> 00:45:41.250
in its legal religious and
cultural practices and norms.

00:45:41.250 --> 00:45:44.620
That diversity provides ample opportunity

00:45:44.620 --> 00:45:47.950
and incentive for Muslim
diaspora communities

00:45:47.950 --> 00:45:51.360
to make the necessary
adjustments to Western life

00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:55.500
and to sort out what is core
and what is more discretionary

00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:57.620
in their religious lives.

00:45:57.620 --> 00:46:01.650
Cultural adaptation, not assimilation

00:46:01.650 --> 00:46:06.650
is what is needed to win the
accommodations of the state.

00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:11.170
Third, religious communities in turn

00:46:11.170 --> 00:46:15.600
have to accommodate or at least tolerate,

00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:19.240
the core values of their
secular host nations

00:46:19.240 --> 00:46:21.810
if they expect to win concessions

00:46:21.810 --> 00:46:25.450
for their religious courts
or religious practices.

00:46:25.450 --> 00:46:28.400
No Western nation will long accommodate,

00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:31.350
perhaps not even tolerate
a religious community

00:46:31.350 --> 00:46:34.630
that cannot accept its
core values of liberty,

00:46:34.630 --> 00:46:36.410
equality and fraternity

00:46:36.410 --> 00:46:39.760
or of human rights
democracy and rule of law.

00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:41.670
Those who wish to enjoy the freedom

00:46:41.670 --> 00:46:43.800
and benefits of Western society,

00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:46.560
have to accept its core constitutional

00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:48.803
and cultural values as well.

00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:53.450
So far only a small and brave band

00:46:53.450 --> 00:46:57.730
of mostly Western trade Muslim
intellectuals and jurists

00:46:57.730 --> 00:47:00.670
have called for the full
embrace of democracy

00:47:00.670 --> 00:47:05.440
and human rights in and on Muslim terms.

00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:08.480
These are highly promising arguments

00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:10.900
and courageously proffered.

00:47:10.900 --> 00:47:14.570
But so far these arguments
can hardly be heard

00:47:14.570 --> 00:47:17.510
amidst all the loud denunciations of them

00:47:17.510 --> 00:47:22.510
from sundry traditional
Muslims in and beyond the West.

00:47:22.570 --> 00:47:27.180
Moreover even liberal
Muslims, are hard-pressed

00:47:27.180 --> 00:47:31.930
to point to modern examples
of a Sharia based legal system

00:47:31.930 --> 00:47:36.540
that's maintains core democratic
and human rights values.

00:47:36.540 --> 00:47:40.720
Unless and until that case
can be reliably made out,

00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:43.713
deep suspicions will remain the norm.

00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:48.490
And finally Muslim tribunals in the West

00:47:48.490 --> 00:47:52.320
must become a good deal
more legally sophisticated,

00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:55.800
and procedurally equitable
to be both attractive

00:47:55.800 --> 00:47:58.250
to voluntary Muslim disputants,

00:47:58.250 --> 00:48:02.150
and acceptable to secular state courts.

00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:06.780
Like the Jewish Beth din that
sits in New York or in London

00:48:06.780 --> 00:48:10.370
the Muslim law court needs
to be staffed by jurists

00:48:10.370 --> 00:48:11.900
who are well-trained

00:48:11.900 --> 00:48:14.510
both in religious law and in secular law,

00:48:14.510 --> 00:48:17.460
and who maintain basic
standards of due process

00:48:17.460 --> 00:48:21.850
and representation akin
to those in secular courts

00:48:21.850 --> 00:48:25.240
or secular arbitration tribunals.

00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:28.790
A single Imam pronouncing legal judgments

00:48:28.790 --> 00:48:32.250
in an informal proceeding
at the local mosque,

00:48:32.250 --> 00:48:35.060
will get no more deference
from a state court

00:48:35.060 --> 00:48:36.840
than a single priest or rabbi

00:48:36.840 --> 00:48:40.840
making legal pronouncements
in a church or in a synagogue.

00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:43.420
And Western state courts
will have little patience

00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:46.120
with claims that this lack of deference,

00:48:46.120 --> 00:48:49.590
violates the religious liberty
of the mosque or the Imam

00:48:49.590 --> 00:48:52.050
or the members before the Imam.

00:48:52.050 --> 00:48:55.570
The courts suspicions will
in fact be the opposite

00:48:55.570 --> 00:48:58.517
that the disputing parties
who appeared before the Imam

00:48:58.517 --> 00:49:02.190
did not understand the full legal options

00:49:02.190 --> 00:49:04.550
available to them at state law

00:49:04.550 --> 00:49:07.010
or were coerced to participate

00:49:07.010 --> 00:49:09.450
in the internal religious procedures

00:49:09.450 --> 00:49:12.600
abdicating their states rights.

00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:17.600
It's much harder for a secular
court to have such suspicions

00:49:17.860 --> 00:49:21.910
when educated Muslim
parties eyes wide open

00:49:21.910 --> 00:49:25.970
choose a legally sophisticated
Muslim arbitration tribunal

00:49:25.970 --> 00:49:29.810
over a secular court that does
not share their core values

00:49:29.810 --> 00:49:33.810
but still offers them a
serious jurisprudential option

00:49:33.810 --> 00:49:35.693
to state marriage law.

00:49:38.470 --> 00:49:43.020
Lest all of this seem like an
unduly patronizing argument

00:49:43.020 --> 00:49:46.520
for religious minorities, to wait and see

00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:49.310
or change and hope for the best.

00:49:49.310 --> 00:49:53.310
It's worth remembering,
that majority Christians too

00:49:53.310 --> 00:49:55.910
went through much of this same exercise

00:49:55.910 --> 00:49:59.013
in the area of religion and education.

00:49:59.850 --> 00:50:02.440
The American story offers
a good illustration

00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:05.930
of how this developed and how
common educational standards

00:50:05.930 --> 00:50:08.920
were eventually raised and maintained.

00:50:08.920 --> 00:50:11.360
In the later 19th and early 20th century,

00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:14.740
a number of American
states wanted a monopoly

00:50:14.740 --> 00:50:16.870
on education in their public,

00:50:16.870 --> 00:50:19.560
that is their state-run schools.

00:50:19.560 --> 00:50:23.350
Some of this agitation was
driven by anti-catholicism

00:50:23.350 --> 00:50:26.780
some by anti religious animus altogether.

00:50:26.780 --> 00:50:30.510
For half a century churches,
schools and religious parents

00:50:30.510 --> 00:50:33.450
struggled earnestly to
protect their rights

00:50:33.450 --> 00:50:35.090
to educate their children

00:50:35.090 --> 00:50:37.910
in their own private religious schools.

00:50:37.910 --> 00:50:39.260
And in the landmark case

00:50:39.260 --> 00:50:43.100
of Pierce versus Society
of Sisters in 1925,

00:50:43.100 --> 00:50:47.239
the United States Supreme
Court held for the churches,

00:50:47.239 --> 00:50:49.910
and the families and
ordered American States

00:50:49.910 --> 00:50:52.190
to maintain parallel public

00:50:52.190 --> 00:50:56.250
and private education
options for their citizens.

00:50:56.250 --> 00:50:59.250
But in a long series of cases thereafter,

00:50:59.250 --> 00:51:01.860
courts also made clear that states

00:51:01.860 --> 00:51:04.830
could set basic educational requirements

00:51:04.830 --> 00:51:07.950
for all schools as a
matter of accreditation,

00:51:07.950 --> 00:51:11.460
setting mandatory courses
and texts and tests

00:51:11.460 --> 00:51:14.480
mandatory standards where
teachers and students,

00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:16.750
common requirements for laboratories,

00:51:16.750 --> 00:51:19.720
libraries, gymnasia and more.

00:51:19.720 --> 00:51:22.280
Religious schools could add

00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:25.870
to the state's minimal
accreditation requirements,

00:51:25.870 --> 00:51:28.530
but they could not subtract from them.

00:51:28.530 --> 00:51:30.200
Religious schools that sought

00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:33.250
religious freedom exemptions
from these requirements

00:51:33.250 --> 00:51:36.120
found little sympathy from the courts

00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:39.400
which instructed the schools
either to meet the standards

00:51:39.400 --> 00:51:43.123
or to lose their accreditation
and licences to teach.

00:51:44.530 --> 00:51:48.490
This compromise, on religion and education

00:51:48.490 --> 00:51:53.030
forged painfully over more than
half a century of wrangling

00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:57.300
has some bearing on issues
of religion and marriage.

00:51:57.300 --> 00:52:00.870
Marriage like education
is not a state monopoly,

00:52:00.870 --> 00:52:05.430
even if state marriage
law must be a prerogative.

00:52:05.430 --> 00:52:07.160
Religious parties in the West

00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:10.840
have long had the right to
marry in a religious sanctuary

00:52:10.840 --> 00:52:12.620
following their religious communities

00:52:12.620 --> 00:52:14.580
preferred wedding liturgy.

00:52:14.580 --> 00:52:17.540
Religious officials have long
had the right to participate

00:52:17.540 --> 00:52:20.730
in the weddings, annulments
divorces and custody battles

00:52:20.730 --> 00:52:23.080
of their voluntary members.

00:52:23.080 --> 00:52:25.800
But the state has also long set,

00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:29.390
the threshold requirements
of what marriage is

00:52:29.390 --> 00:52:31.800
and who may participate.

00:52:31.800 --> 00:52:34.600
Religious officials may
add to these thresholds

00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:36.850
state law requirements on marriage,

00:52:36.850 --> 00:52:39.160
but not subtract from them.

00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:42.310
A minister may insist
on premarital counseling

00:52:42.310 --> 00:52:44.440
before a wedding even if the state

00:52:44.440 --> 00:52:47.280
will allow the couple to
be married without it,

00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:49.670
but if a minister bullies a minor to marry

00:52:49.670 --> 00:52:53.770
out of religious duty, the
state could throw him in jail.

00:52:53.770 --> 00:52:56.130
A rabbi may encourage a bickering couple

00:52:56.130 --> 00:52:59.670
to repent and reconcile,
but he cannot prevent them

00:52:59.670 --> 00:53:03.520
from filing for divorce,
except in New York.

00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:06.980
An Imam may preach of
the beauties of polygamy,

00:53:06.980 --> 00:53:10.810
but if he knowingly presides
over a polygamous Union

00:53:10.810 --> 00:53:12.763
he is an accessory to crime.

00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:16.800
If religious Tribunal's do eventually

00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:20.180
get more involved in
marriage and family law,

00:53:20.180 --> 00:53:23.300
states may well build on these precedents

00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:27.780
and set threshold requirements
in the form of a license

00:53:27.780 --> 00:53:30.040
a kind of accreditation.

00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:33.660
Formulating these license rules
through a democratic process

00:53:33.660 --> 00:53:35.410
in which all parties of every faith

00:53:35.410 --> 00:53:37.970
and non faith participate.

00:53:37.970 --> 00:53:40.330
Among the most important such license

00:53:40.330 --> 00:53:43.180
or accreditation rules to consider,

00:53:43.180 --> 00:53:45.070
no child or polygamous marriages

00:53:45.070 --> 00:53:47.530
or indeed any other forms of marital Union

00:53:47.530 --> 00:53:50.250
not recognized by the state.

00:53:50.250 --> 00:53:53.210
No compelled marriages
or coerced conversions

00:53:53.210 --> 00:53:55.960
before weddings that
violate elementary freedoms

00:53:55.960 --> 00:53:58.460
of contract and conscience.

00:53:58.460 --> 00:54:01.440
No threats or violations of life or limb

00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:03.720
or provocations of the same.

00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:07.290
No blatant discrimination
against women or children.

00:54:07.290 --> 00:54:09.150
No violations of basic rules

00:54:09.150 --> 00:54:11.640
of procedural fairness and more.

00:54:11.640 --> 00:54:14.720
Religious Tribunal's may
add to these requirements

00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:16.113
but not subtract from them.

00:54:17.500 --> 00:54:21.370
Those who fail to conform
will lose their licenses

00:54:21.370 --> 00:54:25.300
to arbitrate disputes and
will find very little sympathy

00:54:25.300 --> 00:54:28.413
when they raise religious
liberty objections.

00:54:29.300 --> 00:54:33.120
This type of arrangement
worked rather well over time,

00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:35.980
to resolve some of the
nation's hardest questions

00:54:35.980 --> 00:54:38.440
on religion and education.

00:54:38.440 --> 00:54:40.380
And it led many religious schools

00:54:40.380 --> 00:54:42.660
slowly to transform themselves

00:54:42.660 --> 00:54:46.290
from backwards sectarian isolationists,

00:54:46.290 --> 00:54:49.450
into exemplary cultural leaders.

00:54:49.450 --> 00:54:50.690
Muslims in the West

00:54:50.690 --> 00:54:53.480
have already begun some
of this exercise too

00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:56.540
in the development of Muslim
grade schools and high schools

00:54:56.540 --> 00:55:00.000
which are now sometimes
attractive to non-muslims

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:03.650
because of their discipline
and high academic standards.

00:55:03.650 --> 00:55:06.390
And one can imagine in
the next decade or two

00:55:06.390 --> 00:55:10.260
arising alongside a Notre Dame or a BYU

00:55:10.260 --> 00:55:12.960
a Oriya Shiva new school

00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:16.470
that has Muslim religious identity.

00:55:16.470 --> 00:55:19.860
Such an arrangement
holds comparable promise

00:55:19.860 --> 00:55:22.290
for questions of religion and marriage

00:55:22.290 --> 00:55:25.100
in western Muslim communities.

00:55:25.100 --> 00:55:27.640
It not only prevents the descent

00:55:27.640 --> 00:55:30.500
into licensed polygamy
and barbaric procedures

00:55:30.500 --> 00:55:32.230
and brutalized violence

00:55:32.230 --> 00:55:36.370
that Archbishop Rowan Williams's
critics properly feared,

00:55:36.370 --> 00:55:39.800
it also encourages and incentivizes

00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:44.170
various Sharia tribunals
to reform themselves,

00:55:44.170 --> 00:55:46.260
and to pick those marital laws

00:55:46.260 --> 00:55:51.260
from that vast canvas of
Sharia, that are most conducive

00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:55.350
to abiding by Western cultural standards

00:55:55.350 --> 00:55:57.860
and constitutional norms.

00:55:57.860 --> 00:56:01.400
Even hardened and
prejudiced local communities

00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:03.140
and Democratic lands,

00:56:03.140 --> 00:56:07.510
eventually will find room
for new Muslim minorities

00:56:07.510 --> 00:56:10.250
who are skilled at cultural navigation

00:56:10.250 --> 00:56:13.160
and who are both consistent and persistent

00:56:13.160 --> 00:56:16.720
in pressing their main
case for accommodation.

00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:20.610
The Catholic example in
America is a good example.

00:56:20.610 --> 00:56:23.290
And in the process of
adjusting to the legal

00:56:23.290 --> 00:56:26.000
and cultural realities of their new homes,

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:28.490
Western Muslim religious minorities

00:56:28.490 --> 00:56:32.100
may eventually become
legal and cultural leaders

00:56:32.100 --> 00:56:33.660
of the law of marriage

00:56:33.660 --> 00:56:37.670
in succeeding generations of the West.

00:56:37.670 --> 00:56:39.938
Thank you very much for
your kind attention.

00:56:39.938 --> 00:56:43.105
(audience applauding)

00:56:44.177 --> 00:56:46.760
(upbeat music)
