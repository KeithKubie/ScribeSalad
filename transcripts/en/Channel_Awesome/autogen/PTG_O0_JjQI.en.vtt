right at the end that works sure is

00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:15.920
right at the end that works sure is
 

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:16.810
right at the end that works sure is
there anything that you didn't like

timeline stuff that was that was weird
 

00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:24.580
timeline stuff that was that was weird
but that's sort of the nature of it

00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:24.590
but that's sort of the nature of it
 

00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:26.260
but that's sort of the nature of it
where it's weird that it changes like

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:26.270
where it's weird that it changes like
 

00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:28.360

00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:33.800
with any key i don't really it's a
 

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:36.910
with any key i don't really it's a
little convoluted but i mean obviously

00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:36.920
little convoluted but i mean obviously
 

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:39.670

00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:39.680
you're working with like that's gotta
 

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:41.620
you're working with like that's gotta
happen but there were a few things that

00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:41.630
happen but there were a few things that
 

00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:44.620
happen but there were a few things that
were just a little off with that for me

00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:44.630
were just a little off with that for me
 

00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:46.270
were just a little off with that for me
but okay there than that no I thought it

00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:46.280
but okay there than that no I thought it

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:49.730
do feel like the comics handle the
 

00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:52.240
do feel like the comics handle the
time-travel issues better yeah yeah I

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:52.250
time-travel issues better yeah yeah I
 

00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:53.620

00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:55.910
reverse-flash at the end is I think more
 

00:16:55.910 --> 00:17:00.190
reverse-flash at the end is I think more
consistent and kind of cool but I like

00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:00.200
consistent and kind of cool but I like
 

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:01.720
consistent and kind of cool but I like

don't as much have a problem the
animation so it brings higher for me

00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:40.980
animation so it brings higher for me
 

00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:43.910
animation so it brings higher for me
because of that I like it's story wise

00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:43.920
because of that I like it's story wise
 

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:45.710
because of that I like it's story wise
and it covers a lot of the Justice

00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:45.720
and it covers a lot of the Justice
 

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:47.300
and it covers a lot of the Justice
League characters so it's higher for me

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:47.310
League characters so it's higher for me
 

00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:54.920
League characters so it's higher for me
so I'd say it's top of the middle okay

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:54.930
 
 

00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:57.560
 
in the middle - it's not my favorite but

00:19:57.560 --> 00:19:57.570
in the middle - it's not my favorite but
 

00:19:57.570 --> 00:20:00.890
in the middle - it's not my favorite but
it's also not the worst and I guess I

00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:00.900
it's also not the worst and I guess I
 

00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:03.920
it's also not the worst and I guess I
might put it just above first flight

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:03.930
might put it just above first flight
 

00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:06.650
might put it just above first flight
okay okay all right

00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:06.660
okay okay all right
 

00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:11.000
okay okay all right
I'd say like like number ten in the top

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:11.010
I'd say like like number ten in the top
 

00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:12.650
I'd say like like number ten in the top
ten like the only reason you put it in

00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:12.660
ten like the only reason you put it in
 

00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:15.110
ten like the only reason you put it in
downtown yeah that's just because the

00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:15.120
downtown yeah that's just because the
 

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:16.940
downtown yeah that's just because the
story itself in the you know it was a

00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:16.950
story itself in the you know it was a
 

00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:19.220
story itself in the you know it was a
good solid movie okay I take away the

00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:19.230
good solid movie okay I take away the
 

00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:22.100
good solid movie okay I take away the
animation all that crap like it is it's

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:22.110
animation all that crap like it is it's
 

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:23.630
animation all that crap like it is it's
a solid movie I remember liking the

00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:23.640
a solid movie I remember liking the
 

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:26.750
a solid movie I remember liking the
movie right so like I'd say like number

00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:26.760
movie right so like I'd say like number
 

00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:29.300
movie right so like I'd say like number
10 maybe not good so but yeah definitely

00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:29.310
10 maybe not good so but yeah definitely
 

00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:31.460
10 maybe not good so but yeah definitely
not near the it's in the top ten that's

00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:31.470
not near the it's in the top ten that's
 

00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:32.630
not near the it's in the top ten that's
in the top ten so there's a lot of

00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:32.640
in the top ten so there's a lot of
 

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:35.300
in the top ten so there's a lot of
difference there's a lot you see

00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:35.310
difference there's a lot you see
 

00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:39.410
difference there's a lot you see
animated movies so there's really a lot

00:20:39.410 --> 00:20:39.420
animated movies so there's really a lot
 

00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:41.330
animated movies so there's really a lot
there's like a handful there's life I

00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:41.340
there's like a handful there's life I
 

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:42.800
there's like a handful there's life I
could probably do like seven or eight

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:42.810
could probably do like seven or eight
 

00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:44.090
could probably do like seven or eight
off that man okay

00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:44.100
off that man okay
 

00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:48.920
off that man okay
well that's why I said a handful so yeah

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:48.930
well that's why I said a handful so yeah
 

00:20:48.930 --> 00:20:53.000
well that's why I said a handful so yeah
but well anyways yeah for me I'd say

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:53.010
but well anyways yeah for me I'd say
 

00:20:53.010 --> 00:20:54.440
but well anyways yeah for me I'd say
it's just about like in the middle I

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:54.450
it's just about like in the middle I
 

00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:57.080
it's just about like in the middle I
mean I enjoyed it enough to where I got

mean I enjoyed it enough to where I got
some enjoyment out of it but there's so

00:20:58.880 --> 00:20:58.890
some enjoyment out of it but there's so
 

00:20:58.890 --> 00:21:01.640
some enjoyment out of it but there's so
much better stuff out there yeah it kind

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:01.650
much better stuff out there yeah it kind
 

00:21:01.650 --> 00:21:03.890
much better stuff out there yeah it kind
