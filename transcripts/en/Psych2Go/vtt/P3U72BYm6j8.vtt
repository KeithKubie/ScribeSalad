00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.510
We all know how easy it is to be completely mesmerized

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.330
By a new crush and when you're falling for someone it can seem like nothing else really matters

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:21.829
But the sad truth is that some crushes can be unhealthy and that's something everyone needs to watch out for

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.039
Can you think of a time when you had an unhealthy crush?

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.550
You might even be in the midst of an unhealthy crush right now without actually realizing it

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:39.049
but have no fear because we're about to tell you all about which crushes we think can be potentially unhealthy and

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.639
What to look out for one rushing on someone who's already in a relationship?

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.029
Let's get the obvious stuff out of the way first

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.058
Yes crushing on someone who's in a relationship is probably not the most healthy thing for you

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:54.960
Psychologically speaking

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:02.480
We know that this is sometimes hard to control but wanting something that you can't have could potentially lead to some serious

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.529
Inner turmoil, it's cool to hang back and wait for an opening

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.529
But if you can't control your feelings, it could destroy your friendships and totally mess with your head

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:17.179
Two crushing on someone who's way too old or young for you

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:21.468
We know that age is just a number but there's definitely a limit to that

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:26.509
Crushing on someone who's way too older young for you could very well be an unhealthy thing

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:34.849
Hell it might not even be legal while these relationships can sometimes work out. They definitely don't stand the best chance of success

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:43.369
Again, this is often a case of desiring something you can't have and that can lead to some seriously unhealthy patterns

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:45.380
It's even more worrisome

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:51.889
if you find yourself crushing on older people who are married or if you are an older person crushing on someone who's still

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:57.738
Essentially a child there are tons of situations where older and younger people can make it work

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.668
But there's also a lot of potential for unhealthy behavior

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:04.638
three when a crush becomes an obsession

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.439
While it's true that devotion and obsession can sometimes be romantic

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:15.619
It's easy to cross the line into some very weird territory. If you find yourself following your crush

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:20.829
Creeping on their social media profiles and generally just worshipping them

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.489
Then you've probably developed some pretty unhealthy thought patterns

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:30.789
Not only is this unhealthy, but it also diminishes your chances of actually getting with your crush

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.940
It's better to just relax take it easy and try not to obsess too hard

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:45.039
Four when you develop a crush on someone who treats you poorly some of our viewers might disagree with some of these points

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:52.209
But everyone will understand that this is unhealthy and the sad part is it happens way too often

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.269
crushing on someone who treats you poorly is

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:59.469
Pretty unhealthy and it's something that definitely needs to be addressed

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.089
If you find yourself getting attracted to someone who is bullying you or putting you down

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:07.929
Maybe take a step back. This could be due to

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:13.358
Codependency or some sort of psychological trauma you need to work through with a professional

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:18.189
There is no reason why you should be attracted to someone who is abusive and mean

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:25.029
Sure bad boys can be attractive but someone who treats you badly will never make a good partner

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:26.930
six

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.209
Crushing on an ex. Well, it's obviously not something that we can control

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.739
It's generally not a positive thing in our lives in the simplest terms possible

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.819
Crushing on an ex means that you can't move on. Sure

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:45.009
There might be a chance of getting back together and it might be a great relationship when you do that

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:51.849
But what if your ex has moved on and you didn't what if you just find yourself wishing that you could get back together?

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:54.489
Even when you know that it's not possible

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:58.059
This goes back to the problem of desiring things

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:04.119
You can't have. An ex can be that forbidden fruit which torments you day and night

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:07.989
In the end it's better to just let go

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:13.839
While it's sometimes hard to do this being completely unable to is an unhealthy sign

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:21.399
Six crushing on someone in a long-distance relationship when you're not used to it. Let's be clear

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.190
long-distance relationships can work

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.780
We're not saying crushing on someone who lives far away is always unhealthy

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.569
But it definitely has potential to be it

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:38.859
Can be pretty stressful thinking about what that person is up to and whether or not they're getting romantic with other people. In

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:45.068
fact it can be pretty close to torture if you're used to long-distance relationships

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:49.869
you might be able to keep that crush alive and wait for your moment, but if not,

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:54.579
It could spiral into some pretty unhealthy thoughts and behaviors

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.239
Seven crushing on someone when you're already in a relationship

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:01.449
Crushing on when you're already in a relationship

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:08.109
Can be an uncontrollable thing and it's definitely a case of the grass always being greener on the other side

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:11.649
We know love just happens

00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:17.259
It's not like we can control who we fall for or whether or not it happens when we're already in a relationship

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:22.149
But if you find yourself crushing on people while you're already tied down

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:28.989
It might just be a sign that you're not able to commit to a long-term partnership and you have problems being loyal

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:31.749
This is potentially a cause for alarm

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:39.460
especially if you're leading your partner on while not really interested in them all this can be is pretty unhealthy if

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:41.199
