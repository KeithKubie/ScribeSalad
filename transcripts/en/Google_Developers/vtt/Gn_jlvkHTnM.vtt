Hi, my name is Nick, and I am the product
manager for Google Chrome's extension system.

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:14.910
Today, I'd like to show you how to publish
your extension in the Google Chrome Extension

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:15.910
gallery.

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.250
Here on my desktop, I've got a new extension
that I've created. The first thing I'd like

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:26.619
to do is check that the manifest has a title,
a short description, and an icon. It's very

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:31.789
important to pay attention to these, as they'll
influence how likely people are to pick my

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:34.940
extension in the gallery.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.190
Next I'm going to zip up this folder. There
are a number of free programs out there that

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:45.390
will do this for you. The gallery will require
me to upload this zip file, not a packaged

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.390
extension.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:56.660
Next, I go to the gallery site at chrome.google.com/extensions.
I click the developer link here in the left

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:03.579
navigation, which takes me to my developer
dashboard. Here I can see all the extensions

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:05.220
that I've previously uploaded.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.040
I click add new item, and the first thing
I have to do is upload the zip file I created

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.790
earlier.

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:18.530
At this point, I get taken to the edit page,
where I can enter a more detailed description.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.830
I've already prepared this, so I'm just going
to paste it here. I can also add a support

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:31.040
link, which is very important to avoid users
posting bug reports in my reviews.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.560
I'm also going to add some nice screenshots.
Again, the nicer my extension looks, the bigger

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.770
the chance that someone will install it.

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:45.150
I can also specify a youtube video. Ideally
this would be a screencast of my extension

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.150
in action.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:52.570
Finally, when all is ready, I hit publish
and get taken to a preview page. Here I double-check

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.100
my information and confirm.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:01.210
In just a few minutes, my extension is live
in the Google Chrome Extension gallery! I

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:02.720
hope to see yours there soon too.
