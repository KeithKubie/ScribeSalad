00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:04.390
I think you've probably heard
the word divide before, where

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:06.730
someone tells you to
divide something up.

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:11.450
Divide the money between you
and your brother or between

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:12.650
you and your buddy.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:14.640
And it essentially means
to cut up something.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.720
So let me write down
the word divide.

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.370
Let's say that I
have 4 quarters.

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:27.500
Do my best to draw
the quarters.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.320
If I have 4 quarters
just like that.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.030
That's my rendition of George
Washington on the quarters.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.820
And let's say there's two of
us and we're going to divide

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.550
the quarters between us.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.520
So this is me right here.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.870
Let me try my best to draw me.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.760
So that's me right there.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.160
Let's see, I have
a lot of hair.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.090
And then this is
you right there.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.300
Do my best.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.270
So you're bald.

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:00.315
You have side burns.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.000
Maybe you have a little
bit of a beard.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.090
I want to get too
focused on the drawing.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.240
So that's you, that's me, and
we're going to divide these 4

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.520
quarters between the 2 of us.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:22.230
So notice, we have 4 quarters
and we're going to divide

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:23.580
between the 2 of us.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.540
There are 2 of us.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.740
And I want to stress
the number 2.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.880
So we're going to divide
4 quarters by 2.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.480
We're going to divide it
between the 2 of us.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.900
And you've probably done
something like this.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:37.540
What happens?

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.230
Well, each of us are
going to get 2 quarters.

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:41.290
So let me divide it.

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.180
We're going to
divide it into 2.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.460
Essentially what I did do is
I take the 4 quarters and I

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.785
divide it into 2 equal groups.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.930
And that's what division is.

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.620
We cut up this group of
quarters into 2 equal groups.

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.550
So when you divide 4 quarters
into 2 groups, so this was

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.230
4 quarters right there.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.760
And you want to divide
it into 2 groups.

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.770
This is group 1.

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.530
Group 1 right here.

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.380
And this is group 2 right here.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.890
How many numbers
are in each group?

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.990
Or how many quarters
are in each group?

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.870
Well, in each group I
have 1, 2 quarters.

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.660
Let me use a brighter color.

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.260
I have 1, 2 quarters
in each group.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.040
1 quarter and 2 quarters
in each group.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.630
So to write this out
mathematically, I think this is

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.070
something that you've done,
probably as long as you've been

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.020
splitting money between you and
your siblings and your buddies.

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.420
Actually, let me scroll over
a little bit, so you can

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.330
see my entire picture.

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.360
How do we write this
mathematically?

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.270
We can write that 4
divided by-- so this 4.

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:56.980
Let me use the right colors.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:04.020
So this 4, which is this 4,
divided by the 2 groups, these

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.500
are the 2 groups: group 1 and
this is group 2 right here.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.030
So divided into 2 groups
or into 2 collections.

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:17.200
4 divided by 2 is equal to--
when you divide 4 into 2

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.530
groups, each group is going
to have 2 quarters in it.

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.010
It's going to be equal to 2.

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.050
And I just wanted to use this
example because I want to show

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:27.180
you that division is something
that you've been

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.260
using all along.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.560
And another important, I guess,
takeaway or thing to realize

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.020
about this, is on some level
this is the opposite

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:36.330
of multiplication.

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:43.210
If I said that I had 2 groups
of 2 quarters I would multiply

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:49.550
the 2 groups times the 2
quarters each and I would say

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:53.000
I would then have 4 quarters.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.930
So on some level these are
saying the same thing.

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.230
But just to make it a little
bit more concrete in our

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.400
head, let's do a couple
of more examples.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.600
Let's do a bunch
of more examples.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:09.250
So let's write down, what is
6 divided by-- I'm trying to

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:10.900
keep it nice and color coded.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.800
6 divided by 3, what
is that equal to?

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.150
Let's just draw 6 objects.

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:18.590
They can be anything.

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.030
Let's say I have
6 bell peppers.

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.050
I won't take too much
trouble to draw them.

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.260
Well, that's not what a
bell pepper looks like,

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:28.210
but you get the idea.

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:34.370
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.030
And I'm going to
divide it by 3.

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.500
And one way that we can think
about that is that means I want

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.690
to divide my 6 bell peppers
into 3 equal groups

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:43.730
of bell peppers.

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:46.230
You could kind of think of it
if 3 people are going to share

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.970
these bell peppers, how
many do each of them get?

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:50.840
So let's divide it
into 3 groups.

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.770
So that's our 6 bell peppers.

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.580
I'm going to divide
it into 3 groups.

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.210
So the best way to divide it
into 3 groups is I can have 1

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:02.470
group right there, 2 groups, or
the second group right there,

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.910
and then, the third group.

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:10.350
And then each group will have
exactly how many bell peppers?

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:12.120
They'll have 1, 2.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.510
1, 2.

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:15.140
1, 2 bell peppers.

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:20.060
So 6 divided by 3
is equal to 2.

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:23.030
So the best way or one way to
think about it is that you

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:26.790
divided the 6 into 3 groups.

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:29.880
Now you could view that a
slightly different way,

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.900
although it's not completely
different, but it's a good

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.110
way to think about it.

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:38.150
You could also think of
it as 6 divided by 3.

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.690
And once again, let's
say I have raspberries

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:42.850
now-- easier to draw.

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:47.460
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.060
And here, instead of
dividing it into 3

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:51.600
groups like we did here.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.290
This was 1 group, 2
group, 3 groups.

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:57.180
Instead of dividing into 3
groups, what I want to do is

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:00.690
say well, if I'm dividing
6 divided by 3, I want to

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:02.710
divide it into groups of 3.

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:04.260
Not into 3 groups.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:05.960
I want to divide it
into groups of 3.

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:09.490
So how many groups of
3 am I going to have?

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:12.930
Well, let me draw
some groups of 3.

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:16.040
So that is one group of 3.

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.910
And that is two groups of 3.

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:26.920
So if I take 6 things and I
divide them into groups of 3, I

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.950
will end up with 1, 2 groups.

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:33.230
So that's another way to
think about division.

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:34.550
And this is an
interesting thing.

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:37.400
When you think about these two
relations, you'll see a

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:42.120
relationship between 6 divided
by 3 and 6 divided by 3.

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.720
Let me do that right here.

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:49.960
What is 6 divided by 2 when
you think of it in this

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:51.740
context right here?

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:55.250
6 divided by 2, when you
do it like that-- let me

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:58.780
draw 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:01.440
When we think about 6 divided
by 2 in terms of dividing it

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:05.140
into 2 groups, what we can end
up is we could have 1 group

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:09.520
like this and then 1 group
like this, and each group

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.500
will have 3 elements.

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:12.710
It'll have 3 things in it.

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:14.730
So 6 divided by 2 is 3.

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:16.400
Or you could think of
it the other way.

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:22.560
You could say that 6 divided
by 2 is-- you're taking 6

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:26.420
objects: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:29.810
And your dividing it into
groups of 2 where each

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:31.200
group has 2 elements.

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:32.920
And that on some level is
an easier thing to do.

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:36.640
If each group has 2 elements,
well, that's the 1 right there.

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:38.690
They don't even have
to be nicely ordered.

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:41.700
This could be one group right
there and that could be the

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:42.990
other group right there.

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:44.580
I don't have to draw
them all stacked up.

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:45.920
These are just groups of 2.

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:47.390
But how many groups do I have?

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:49.250
I have 1, 2, 3.

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:51.070
I have 3 groups.

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:55.460
But notice something, it's no
coincidence that 6 divided by 3

00:07:55.460 --> 00:08:00.690
is 2 and 6 divided by 2 is 3.

00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:03.280
Let me write that down.

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:10.290
We get 6 divided by 3 is
equal to 2 and 6 divided

00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:13.290
by 2 is equal to 3.

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:16.400
And the reason why you see this
relation where you can kind of

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:22.500
swap this 2 and this 3 is
because 2 times 3

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:23.350
is equal to 6.

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.490
Let's say I have 2 groups of 3.

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:29.840
Let me draw 2 groups of 3.

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:33.430
So that's 1 group of 3 and then
here's another group of 3.

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:40.790
So 2 groups of 3 is equal to 6.

00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:44.360
2 times 3 is equal to 6.

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:46.770
Or you could think of
it the other way if I

00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:48.090
have 3 groups of 2.

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:50.900
So that's 1 group
of 2 right there.

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:53.840
I have another group
of 2 right there.

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:56.450
And then I have a 3
group of 2 right there.

00:08:56.450 --> 00:08:57.960
What is that equal to?

00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:01.240
3 groups of 2-- 3 times 2.

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:03.260
That's also equal to 6.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:04.840
So 2 times 3 is equal to 6.

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:06.060
3 times 2 is equal to 6.

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:07.830
We saw this in the
multiplication video that

00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:09.530
the order doesn't matter.

00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:12.490
But that's the reason why if
you want to divide it, if you

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:14.630
want to go the other way-- if
you have 6 things and you

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:18.990
want to divide it into
groups of 2, you get 3.

00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:21.120
If you have 6 and you want
to divide into groups

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:23.070
of 3, you get 2.

00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:24.360
Let's do a couple
of more problems.

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:26.440
I think it'll really
make sense about what

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:28.340
division is all about.

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:35.870
Let's do an interesting one.

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:40.600
Let's do 9 divided by 4.

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:43.360
So if we think about 9 divided
by 4, let me draw 9 objects.

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:51.170
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:54.370
Now when you divide by 4, for
this problem, I'm thinking

00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:57.140
about dividing it
into groups of 4.

00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:59.120
So if I want to divide it
into groups of 4, let

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.000
me try doing that.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.670
So here is one group of 4.

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:04.820
I just picked any of
them right like that.

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:06.570
That's one group of 4.

00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:11.100
Then here's another
group of 4 right there.

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:13.330
And then I have this
left over thing.

00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:17.220
Maybe we could call it a
remainder, where I can't put

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:18.450
this one into a group of 4.

00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:21.870
When I'm dividing by 4
I can only cut up the

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:24.090
9 into groups of 4.

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:28.610
So the answer here, and this is
a new concept for you maybe, 9

00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:32.580
divided by 4 is going
to be 2 groups.

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:35.340
I have one group here and
another group here, and then

00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:36.670
I have a remainder of 1.

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:38.970
I have 1 left over that I
wasn't able to do with.

00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:45.890
Remainder-- that
says remainder 1.

00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:49.410
9 divided by 4 is
2 remainder 1.

00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:53.010
If I asked you what 12 divided
by 4 is, so let me do 12.

00:10:53.010 --> 00:11:00.910
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:01.980
So let me write that down.

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:06.010
12 divided by 4.

00:11:06.010 --> 00:11:08.860
So I want to divide these
12 objects-- maybe

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:10.480
they're apples or plums.

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:12.520
And divide them
into groups of 4.

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:14.830
So let me see if I can do that.

00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:19.340
So this is one group
of 4 just like that.

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:23.340
This is another group
of 4 just like that.

00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:24.190
And this is pretty
straightforward.

00:11:24.190 --> 00:11:28.000
And then I have a third
group of 4 just like that.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.640
And there's nothing left
over like I had before.

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:35.210
I can exactly divide 12
objects into 3 groups of 4.

00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:38.190
1, 2, 3 groups of 4.

00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:44.520
So 12 divided by
4 is equal to 3.

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:47.110
And we can do the exercise that
we saw on the previous video.

00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:49.235
What is 12 divided by 3?

00:11:49.235 --> 00:11:51.840
Let me do a new color.

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:55.200
12 divided by 3.

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.470
Now based on what we've learn
so far we say, that should just

00:11:57.470 --> 00:12:00.930
be 4 because 3 times 4 is 12.

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:02.770
But let's prove
it to ourselves.

00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:09.420
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8, 9, 20, 11, 12.

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:12.180
Let's divide it
into groups of 3.

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:14.030
And I'm going to make them a
little strange looking just

00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:15.730
so you see that you don't
always have to do it into

00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:17.730
nice, clean columns.

00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:19.870
So that's a group
of 3 right there.

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:21.680
12 divided by 3.

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:27.720
Let's see, here is another
group of 3 just like that.

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:33.010
And then, maybe I'll take
this group of 3 like that.

00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:34.330
And I'll take this group of 3.

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:37.120
There was obviously a much
easier way of dividing it up

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:39.146
then doing these weird l-shaped
things, but I want to show

00:12:39.146 --> 00:12:40.110
you it doesn't matter.

00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:42.100
You're just dividing
it into groups of 3.

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:43.780
And how many groups do we have?

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:45.550
We have one group.

00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:49.720
Then we have our second
group right here.

00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:53.450
And then we have our
third group right there.

00:12:53.450 --> 00:12:56.610
And then we have-- let me
do it in a new color.

00:12:56.610 --> 00:12:59.110
And then we have our
fourth group right there.

00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:01.900
So we have exactly 4 groups.

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:03.720
And when I say there was an
easier way to divide it, the

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:08.980
easier way was obviously, maybe
not obviously-- if I want to

00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:12.750
divide these into groups of 3 I
could have just done 1,

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:16.740
2, 3, 4 groups of 3.

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:19.260
Either of these I'm
dividing the 12 objects

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:20.710
into packets of 3.

00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:21.790
You can imagine them that way.

00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:26.110
Let's do another one that
maybe has a remainder.

00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:26.675
Let's see.

00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:36.350
What is 14 divided by 5?

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:39.580
So let's draw 14 objects.

00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:47.390
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
9, 10, 11, 12, 13 14.

00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:48.330
14 objects.

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:51.850
And I'm going to divide
it into groups of 5.

00:13:51.850 --> 00:13:55.510
Well, the easiest thing is
there's one group right there,

00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:57.930
two groups right there.

00:13:57.930 --> 00:14:00.570
But then this last one, I
only have 4 left, so I can't

00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:01.990
make another group of 5.

00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:05.680
So the answer here is I can
make 2 groups of 5 and I'm

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:10.070
going to have a remainder--
r for remainder-- of 4.

00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:11.680
2 remainder 4.

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:15.320
Now, once you get enough
practice, you're not always

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:17.810
going to be wanting to draw
these circles and dividing

00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:18.470
them up like that.

00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:20.660
Although that would
not be incorrect.

00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:23.790
So another way to think about
this type of problem is to

00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:27.710
say, well, 14 divided by 5,
how do I figure that out?

00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:29.750
Actually, another way
of writing this and no

00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:31.310
harm in showing you.

00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:35.550
I could say 14 divided by 5 is
the same thing as 15 divided

00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:38.640
by-- this sign right--
divided by 5.

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:40.060
And what you do is you
say, well, let's see.

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:42.750
How many times does
5 go into 14?

00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:43.360
Well, let's see.

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:45.340
5 times and you kind
of do multiplication

00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:45.980
tables in your head.

00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:48.950
5 times 1 is equal to 5.

00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:51.860
5 times 2 is equal to 10.

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:55.960
So that's still less than 14,
so 5 goes at least two times.

00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:59.140
5 times 3 is equal to 15.

00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:01.650
Well that's bigger than 14,
so I have to go back here.

00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:03.980
So 5 only goes two times.

00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:05.630
So it goes 2 times.

00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:08.530
2 times 5 is 10.

00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:09.690
And then you subtract.

00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:12.160
You say 14 minus 10 is 4.

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:15.090
And that's the same
remainder as right here.

00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:18.150
Well, I could divide 5 into
14 exactly two times, which

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:19.670
would get us 2 groups of 5.

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:21.090
Which is essentially just 10.

00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:23.320
And we still have
the 4 left over.

00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:30.950
Let me do a couple of more just
to really make sure you get

00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:33.180
this stuff really, really,
really, really well.

00:15:35.890 --> 00:15:37.560
Let me write it in
that notation.

00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:41.660
Let's say I do 8 divided by 2.

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:44.590
And I could also write
this as 8-- so I want

00:15:44.590 --> 00:15:45.560
to know what that is.

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:46.790
That's a question mark.

00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:52.100
I could also write this
as 8 divided by 2.

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:54.650
And the way I do either of
these, I'll draw the circles in

00:15:54.650 --> 00:15:57.840
the second, but the way I do it
without drawing the circles, I

00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:01.250
say, well, 2 times
1 is equal to 2.

00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:04.160
So that definitely goes into 8,
but maybe I can think of a

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:07.170
larger number that goes into--
that when I multiply it

00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:09.070
by 2 still goes into 8.

00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:11.360
2 times 2 is equal to 4.

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:13.070
That's still less than 8.

00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:15.710
So 2 times 3 is equal to 6.

00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:17.230
Still less than 8.

00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:21.430
2 times-- oh, something
weird happened to my pen.

00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:25.130
2 times 4 is exactly
equal to 8.

00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:27.500
So 2 goes into 8 four times.

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:29.750
So I could say 2 goes
into 8 four times.

00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:33.200
Or 8 divided by 2
is equal to 4.

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:35.030
We can even draw our circles.

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:38.490
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:40.080
I drew them messy on purpose.

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:42.950
Let's divide them
into groups of 2.

00:16:42.950 --> 00:16:48.240
I have one group of 2, two
groups of 2, three groups

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:51.010
of 2, four groups of 2.

00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:54.170
So if I have 8 objects, divide
them into groups of 2,

00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:55.460
you have four groups.

00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:59.210
So 8 divided by 2 is 4.

00:16:59.210 --> 00:17:01.460
Hopefully you found
that helpful.
