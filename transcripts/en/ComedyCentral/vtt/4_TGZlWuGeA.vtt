00:00:04.104 --> 00:00:08.274
Welcome back! Now,
Beyoncé's visual album<i> Lemonade</i>

00:00:08.307 --> 00:00:10.276
has caused quite a stir
on the Internet,

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:12.412
sparking all sorts
of controversies, think pieces,

00:00:12.445 --> 00:00:14.814
and Twitter beefs. So here
to sort through all the drama

00:00:14.847 --> 00:00:16.482
is<i> Nightly Show</i> Contributor
Franchesca Ramsey

00:00:16.515 --> 00:00:18.351
with her segment Hash It Out.

00:00:18.384 --> 00:00:20.320
-(tweeting)
-♪ ♪

00:00:23.389 --> 00:00:27.293
Thanks, Larry. Yep, this week
has been all about<i> Lemonade.</i>

00:00:27.326 --> 00:00:30.430
Beyoncé's new visual album is
the musical journey of a woman

00:00:30.463 --> 00:00:32.098
scorned by her cheating husband.

00:00:32.131 --> 00:00:34.967
Because as the saying goes,
when life hands you lemons,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.036
drag your (bleep)
cheating husband

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:39.705
and collect your Grammys.

00:00:39.738 --> 00:00:43.976
That is, before Kanye tries to
collect those Grammys for you.

00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:45.978
Personally, I loved<i> Lemonade.</i>

00:00:46.011 --> 00:00:48.181
But, obviously,
when Beyoncé drops an album,

00:00:48.214 --> 00:00:50.850
there's one person
we all want to hear from,

00:00:50.883 --> 00:00:53.453
one oracle of wisdom
who can cut through the noise

00:00:53.486 --> 00:00:55.721
and elevate this celebration
of black womanhood

00:00:55.754 --> 00:00:58.124
to its proper place.
I'm talking, of course,

00:00:58.157 --> 00:01:02.195
about failed CNN host
Piers Morgan.

00:01:02.228 --> 00:01:04.797
So, what did Piers Morgan
have to say?

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.066
Let's take a look
at some of his tweets.

00:01:07.099 --> 00:01:10.069
"To clarify, I love Beyoncé
and<i> Lemonade's</i> a great album.

00:01:10.102 --> 00:01:12.605
"I just didn't like
the politically/racially charged

00:01:12.638 --> 00:01:14.140
video that went with it."

00:01:14.173 --> 00:01:16.342
So Piers is mad
because the music video

00:01:16.375 --> 00:01:18.344
for the song "Freedom"
includes the mothers

00:01:18.377 --> 00:01:20.947
of Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner,
and Michael Brown.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.149
It's a sad but powerful moment
in a song

00:01:23.182 --> 00:01:25.685
about overcoming the odds
and fighting for what's right.

00:01:25.718 --> 00:01:27.687
And, apparently, advocating
for black lives

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.288
gets Piers' knickers in a twist.

00:01:29.321 --> 00:01:30.890
I said "knickers," you guys.

00:01:30.923 --> 00:01:34.360
I'm not some sort
of Piers Morgan over here.

00:01:34.393 --> 00:01:35.828
His next tweet says,

00:01:35.861 --> 00:01:38.564
"I've always been consistently
against gun control.

00:01:38.597 --> 00:01:40.366
"Beyoncé's
suddenly turned political.

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:41.968
There's a difference." Sure,

00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:43.769
you've consistently been
against gun control.

00:01:43.802 --> 00:01:47.106
You've also consistently been
a juice-- douche bag.

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:50.176
First off,
music has always been political.

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:52.778
Ever heard of Bob Marley
or John Lennon

00:01:52.811 --> 00:01:56.115
or Bill Clinton playing sax
on<i> Arsenio?</i>

00:01:56.148 --> 00:01:57.783
As far as I'm concerned,

00:01:57.816 --> 00:02:00.453
Beyoncé's music
has always been political.

00:02:00.486 --> 00:02:02.321
"Bills, Bills, Bills"
was clearly about

00:02:02.354 --> 00:02:04.457
raising the minimum wage.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.461
"Single Ladies," the ultimate
marriage equality theme song.

00:02:08.494 --> 00:02:12.999
"Crazy in Love" about funding
m-mental health infrastructure.

00:02:13.032 --> 00:02:15.668
"Freakum Dress,"
reforming tariffs on textiles

00:02:15.701 --> 00:02:17.803
for clothing manufacturers.

00:02:17.836 --> 00:02:21.207
And "Partition," well,
that one's just about (bleep)

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.476
in a limousine.

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:25.445
(cheering and applause)

00:02:26.512 --> 00:02:29.015
But as the Internet does,

00:02:29.048 --> 00:02:31.484
people felt they needed
to jump into the conversation

00:02:31.517 --> 00:02:34.353
and cosign this foolishness
totally uninvited.

00:02:34.386 --> 00:02:36.422
"I agree with Piers Morgan.

00:02:36.455 --> 00:02:39.158
"I'm black and I believe
Beyoncé has exploited our race

00:02:39.191 --> 00:02:40.326
"for album sales.

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:42.595
Let her prove she hasn't
by donating."

00:02:42.628 --> 00:02:44.463
Um, prove it? How?

00:02:44.496 --> 00:02:46.799
Oh, you mean like the millions
she spent to help victims

00:02:46.832 --> 00:02:48.067
of Hurricane Katrina?

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.069
Or her benefit concerts
for Haiti?

00:02:50.102 --> 00:02:53.072
Or her contributions to bail out
the Black Lives Matter activists

00:02:53.105 --> 00:02:54.473
in Ferguson and Baltimore.

00:02:54.506 --> 00:02:56.976
Not to mention
all that stage time she donated

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:59.378
to Coldplay
during the Super Bowl.

00:02:59.411 --> 00:03:01.514
(cheering and applause)

00:03:01.547 --> 00:03:03.516
Come on.

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:05.851
Seriously.

00:03:05.884 --> 00:03:07.520
But back to Piers Morgan,

00:03:07.553 --> 00:03:09.522
'cause, of course,
he wasn't done.

00:03:09.555 --> 00:03:12.725
"Am I even allowed to listen
to Beyoncé's new album

00:03:12.758 --> 00:03:14.327
"given my white skin color?

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.862
I'm confused." Yeah.

00:03:16.895 --> 00:03:21.534
Well, I'm confused by the way
British people spell "color."

00:03:21.567 --> 00:03:24.870
And you can absolutely enjoy
<i> Lemonade.</i> And you should.

00:03:24.903 --> 00:03:27.873
But you also have to realize
that this album isn't about you.

00:03:27.906 --> 00:03:30.876
That's why Beyoncé featured
an ultimate black girl squad

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:32.378
including Serena Williams.

00:03:32.411 --> 00:03:34.714
If<i> Lemonade</i> was about you,
Piers Morgan,

00:03:34.747 --> 00:03:37.483
it would have been called
<i> Metamucil.</i>

00:03:37.516 --> 00:03:40.453
(laughter, applause
and cheering)

00:03:44.423 --> 00:03:46.392
Look, Piers,

00:03:46.425 --> 00:03:49.262
it's like if you try to wear
a pair of apple bottom jeans.

00:03:49.295 --> 00:03:51.397
-(laughter)
-Sure, you can get them on.

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.267
But without a big booty,
they might not fit that well.

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:55.768
(laughter)

00:03:55.801 --> 00:03:57.670
It doesn't mean
that you can't wear them,

00:03:57.703 --> 00:03:59.238
but you're gonna have
a hard time

00:03:59.271 --> 00:04:00.573
feeling totally comfortable,

00:04:00.606 --> 00:04:02.408
because they weren't created
for your comfort.

00:04:02.441 --> 00:04:03.843
So if you're cool with that,

00:04:03.876 --> 00:04:05.544
then go ahead
and get into formation.

00:04:05.577 --> 00:04:07.713
And if you're not,
then in the words of Beyoncé,

00:04:07.746 --> 00:04:10.216
"Please, suck my balls."

00:04:10.249 --> 00:04:12.785
(cheers and applause)

00:04:12.818 --> 00:04:14.854
Franchesca Ramsey, everybody.

00:04:14.887 --> 00:04:19.392
We'll be right back. Man. Whew!
