00:00:07.906 --> 00:00:09.606
&gt;&gt;Patricia: You have to look
very carefully with oysters,

00:00:09.606 --> 00:00:11.706
but you can see where
they come together,

00:00:11.706 --> 00:00:13.036
where the two shells come together.

00:00:13.036 --> 00:00:15.866
&gt;&gt;Narrator: High schools across
the country teach students

00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:19.086
about marine biology in
hands-on labs like this one

00:00:19.086 --> 00:00:22.116
at Daniel Jenkins Academy
in Haines City, Florida.

00:00:22.296 --> 00:00:23.706
&gt;&gt;Some have some more
spots than others.

00:00:23.706 --> 00:00:25.506
&gt;&gt;Patricia: Some have
more spots than others.

00:00:25.506 --> 00:00:27.366
&gt;&gt;Narrator: But at this
school, live interaction

00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:29.846
with the classroom teachers
is the exception to the rule,

00:00:30.006 --> 00:00:32.856
because the students who come
here take most of their courses,

00:00:32.856 --> 00:00:34.736
including this one, online.

00:00:35.196 --> 00:00:37.886
&gt;&gt;Patricia: Here at Daniel Jenkins
the students actually come to school

00:00:37.886 --> 00:00:41.116
and do their classes
online, and normally most

00:00:41.116 --> 00:00:45.166
of the students would actually do
this lab at home, but getting oysters

00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:47.506
and squids in this area is
kind of hard for the students,

00:00:47.506 --> 00:00:50.076
so I was able to obtain
those and bring them out

00:00:50.076 --> 00:00:51.706
and actually interact
with the students.

00:00:51.836 --> 00:00:55.656
&gt;&gt;Does everybody see something
that's kind of silvery-shiny?

00:00:55.836 --> 00:00:58.546
&gt;&gt;Out of the close to 200 students
that I'll deal with this year,

00:00:58.856 --> 00:01:01.866
I will only see maybe
10 of those students,

00:01:02.006 --> 00:01:05.266
so this is a really great
opportunity as an instructor to get

00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:06.726
to meet my students face to face.

00:01:07.326 --> 00:01:10.016
&gt;&gt;This is all part of
the reproductive system.

00:01:10.016 --> 00:01:13.186
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Kretzer believes that
she can relate to her students better

00:01:13.186 --> 00:01:15.486
in a virtual classroom
than in a real one.

00:01:15.726 --> 00:01:18.686
&gt;&gt;Patricia: Being the online
instructor you have a more personal

00:01:18.686 --> 00:01:20.086
relationship with your students.

00:01:20.176 --> 00:01:24.856
Because we do interact with
them online, on the phone,

00:01:25.276 --> 00:01:27.206
you can really get
to know them better

00:01:27.206 --> 00:01:29.766
and you can also identify
their strengths

00:01:29.766 --> 00:01:33.866
and weaknesses much more quickly, I
think, than in the regular classroom,

00:01:33.866 --> 00:01:38.506
because I deal with them only
when I'm working with them.

00:01:38.506 --> 00:01:41.106
If I need to take two hours
with that student to help them,

00:01:41.406 --> 00:01:43.006
then I take two hours
with that student.

00:01:43.486 --> 00:01:44.086
&gt;&gt;Hey, Chelsea.

00:01:44.616 --> 00:01:47.496
All right, which quiz
do we need to do?

00:01:48.176 --> 00:01:50.286
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Kretzer designs
and teaches her courses

00:01:50.286 --> 00:01:52.046
through the Florida Virtual School.

00:01:52.306 --> 00:01:56.746
Established in 2000, the nation's
first Internet-based public school

00:01:56.776 --> 00:02:00.346
offers virtual learning options
for grades seven through twelve.

00:02:01.486 --> 00:02:03.606
&gt;&gt;Julie: We offer a full
high school curriculum.

00:02:04.146 --> 00:02:08.266
It consists of electives, core
courses, advanced-placement courses

00:02:08.616 --> 00:02:11.236
and honors courses, and
they are all the courses

00:02:11.236 --> 00:02:14.836
that a student would actually need
to graduate, to get a diploma.

00:02:15.296 --> 00:02:17.916
Although we don't offer a
diploma, and that is by design,

00:02:18.446 --> 00:02:21.456
our role here in the state of
Florida is to actually fill the gaps

00:02:21.686 --> 00:02:23.566
of our public and our
private schools.

00:02:23.836 --> 00:02:28.666
For example, our rural districts have
less access to high-quality courses

00:02:28.666 --> 00:02:29.826
and high-quality teachers.

00:02:30.186 --> 00:02:32.386
Online learning brings
that to their doorstep.

00:02:32.526 --> 00:02:33.456
&gt;&gt;All right, here it goes.

00:02:33.456 --> 00:02:35.596
&gt;&gt;Our wonderful angel pie.

00:02:35.596 --> 00:02:36.406
&gt;&gt;Oh, look at that.

00:02:36.406 --> 00:02:38.306
&gt;&gt;Narrator: "Florida Virtual"
means different things

00:02:38.306 --> 00:02:39.316
to different students.

00:02:39.316 --> 00:02:43.756
It's allowed Amanda
Gashaw to work full time

00:02:43.826 --> 00:02:47.436
as a waitress while taking high
school and college courses online.

00:02:47.436 --> 00:02:51.316
&gt;&gt;Amanda: I have been able
to hold down a full-time job,

00:02:52.596 --> 00:02:54.336
be considered almost
a full-time student

00:02:54.336 --> 00:02:58.796
at the local community college and
participate in community activities,

00:02:58.796 --> 00:03:01.426
such as cheerleading
and volunteer things.

00:03:01.636 --> 00:03:04.456
And if it weren't for
taking classes online,

00:03:04.516 --> 00:03:07.086
I would not be able to do this.

00:03:07.366 --> 00:03:10.006
&gt;&gt;Katarina: This assignment was
called "The Impact of Change."

00:03:10.006 --> 00:03:12.936
&gt;&gt;Katarina prefers
Florida Virtual's offerings

00:03:12.936 --> 00:03:15.846
and the support she receives
from computer facilitators

00:03:15.846 --> 00:03:19.616
at Daniel Jenkins to the other
local high school environment.

00:03:19.986 --> 00:03:21.966
&gt;&gt;Katarina: Over at the
high school you have

00:03:21.966 --> 00:03:24.216
so many people trying
to get around everybody.

00:03:24.216 --> 00:03:25.546
It's kind of hectic.

00:03:25.546 --> 00:03:30.056
I'd rather have a teacher that's
willing to be here and to help me

00:03:30.056 --> 00:03:32.786
and that's not just upset
about everything else.

00:03:33.076 --> 00:03:34.836
&gt;&gt;Tell me about how
you researched it.

00:03:35.376 --> 00:03:37.366
&gt;&gt;Katarina: And that's how it feels
that a lot of the teachers are

00:03:37.366 --> 00:03:39.796
at the public high school,
because the classes are so large

00:03:39.796 --> 00:03:41.636
and they get so irritated so easily.

00:03:42.166 --> 00:03:45.386
So, from this online high
school, I expected a lot

00:03:45.526 --> 00:03:47.166
from it and I've received a lot.

00:03:48.126 --> 00:03:51.076
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Williams spends the
school day taking online courses

00:03:51.076 --> 00:03:55.226
at Daniel Jenkins and goes to nearby
Haines City High to compete in track.

00:03:56.116 --> 00:03:58.836
&gt;&gt;Katarina: Over there it's
loud; it's overcrowded,

00:03:59.206 --> 00:04:02.396
and I feel like if I'm around the
right type of people that're here,

00:04:02.396 --> 00:04:05.536
then that has just pushed me to
strive and do better at what I do.

00:04:06.216 --> 00:04:07.686
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Florida
Virtual allowed Nick

00:04:07.936 --> 00:04:10.016
to complete his high school classes

00:04:10.016 --> 00:04:12.146
after he injured his
knee playing football.

00:04:12.666 --> 00:04:17.056
His favorite course is the marine
biology unit designed by Pat Kretzer.

00:04:17.936 --> 00:04:21.566
&gt;&gt;Nick: She actually puts a storyline
behind it, like we're supposed

00:04:21.566 --> 00:04:24.206
to be all in this ship and we're
all supposed to be explorers and go

00:04:24.206 --> 00:04:28.606
through the Galapagos Islands,
the Madagascar Islands.

00:04:28.976 --> 00:04:31.476
The answers weren't just there; you
had to go deeper into the Internet

00:04:31.476 --> 00:04:34.636
and find out more stuff, and at the
same time you were learning more

00:04:34.696 --> 00:04:37.226
stuff, so that class
to me is awesome.

00:04:37.286 --> 00:04:39.776
&gt;&gt;Now all the modules you have
to complete before graduation?

00:04:39.776 --> 00:04:39.976
&gt;&gt;Nick: At school.

00:04:40.166 --> 00:04:44.066
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Lisa sometimes
shares a small office

00:04:44.066 --> 00:04:47.566
with her son running an international
virtual business from their home.

00:04:48.126 --> 00:04:51.086
&gt;&gt;Lisa: It's funny, because Nick and
I work in the same office together

00:04:51.086 --> 00:04:53.016
and we kind of fight over space.

00:04:53.286 --> 00:04:53.526
&gt;&gt;What're you

00:04:53.526 --> 00:04:54.166
[ inaudible ]

00:04:54.166 --> 00:04:54.546
. Back up.

00:04:54.896 --> 00:04:57.456
&gt;&gt;So he gets to see a
lot of what I deal with,

00:04:57.456 --> 00:05:01.276
and now he realizes how disciplined
and focused you have to be.

00:05:01.586 --> 00:05:04.166
&gt;&gt;Nick: I would recommend if
you're a procrastinator if you go

00:05:04.166 --> 00:05:06.946
into this class and you
don't want to do the work,

00:05:07.376 --> 00:05:08.756
you keep pushing it off,
"I'll do it tomorrow.

00:05:08.756 --> 00:05:11.246
I'll do it tomorrow," then
don't even try to do it,

00:05:11.246 --> 00:05:13.266
because you're going
to end up way behind.

00:05:13.796 --> 00:05:16.376
&gt;&gt;Lisa: The flexibility that
I think is great for Nick is

00:05:16.706 --> 00:05:20.756
if it takes him two hours, he's
not embarrassed by other children,

00:05:21.356 --> 00:05:24.566
and if it takes him 20 minutes
he's not held back by other kids.

00:05:24.936 --> 00:05:28.146
I think the greatest point about
this school is their correspondence

00:05:28.146 --> 00:05:29.506
and the interaction with the parents.

00:05:30.366 --> 00:05:32.366
I get progress reports constantly.

00:05:32.556 --> 00:05:36.656
I have the flexibility to make
calls any hour of the day,

00:05:36.656 --> 00:05:39.146
because these teachers
are working from home.

00:05:41.176 --> 00:05:44.296
&gt;&gt;Narrator: With the lack of
qualified teachers for every subject

00:05:44.406 --> 00:05:47.126
and growing demands from
students for more flexibility,

00:05:47.526 --> 00:05:50.176
more and more learning
will happen online.

00:05:50.906 --> 00:05:54.046
&gt;&gt;William: The students are going
to be able to use technology more

00:05:54.046 --> 00:05:56.826
and more easily and
readily than ever before,

00:05:57.176 --> 00:06:02.136
not only taking full online courses
but taking parts of courses online,

00:06:02.136 --> 00:06:03.996
so that you would have
what they call "blended" --

00:06:04.236 --> 00:06:08.076
having teachers in the regular
classrooms teaching face to face

00:06:08.146 --> 00:06:11.856
with their students for part of the
time and using the technologies,

00:06:12.056 --> 00:06:15.556
where appropriate, to enhance and
improve the quality of courses.

00:06:15.906 --> 00:06:18.216
&gt;&gt;Patricia: So you can call
me whenever it's flexible

00:06:18.396 --> 00:06:19.276
for you, and then I'll...

00:06:19.276 --> 00:06:20.896
&gt;&gt;William: Our organization's
all about quality,

00:06:20.926 --> 00:06:25.766
and we see the potential of this
as being a tremendous method

00:06:25.766 --> 00:06:27.656
of improving the quality
of education,

00:06:28.076 --> 00:06:29.736
both in our region and
across the country.
