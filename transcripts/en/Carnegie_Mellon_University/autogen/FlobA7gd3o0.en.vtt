smart cities what is a science

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010
smart cities what is a science
 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.520
smart cities what is a science
well I starts with an understanding of

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530
well I starts with an understanding of
 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.979
well I starts with an understanding of
the components and systems and

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989
the components and systems and
 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.770
the components and systems and
terminologies that those within the

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780
terminologies that those within the
 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.740
terminologies that those within the
science used to describe what's going on

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750
science used to describe what's going on
 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.810
science used to describe what's going on
it starts with a better understanding of

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820
it starts with a better understanding of
 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.910
it starts with a better understanding of
the interaction dynamics of what's going

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920
the interaction dynamics of what's going
 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.060
the interaction dynamics of what's going
on between those components and and and

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070
on between those components and and and
 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.799
on between those components and and and
how they form systems and how they

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809
how they form systems and how they
 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.950
how they form systems and how they
behave you start to understand what is

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960
behave you start to understand what is
 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.570
behave you start to understand what is
healthy normal good versus what isn't

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580
healthy normal good versus what isn't
 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.850
healthy normal good versus what isn't
the science helps you to start to

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860
the science helps you to start to
 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.700
the science helps you to start to
understand that it's it you start to

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710
understand that it's it you start to
 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.370
understand that it's it you start to
understand what is known and what is it

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380
understand what is known and what is it
 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.289
understand what is known and what is it
known and you focus on the unknowns and

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299
known and you focus on the unknowns and
 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.520
known and you focus on the unknowns and
and and you accept the knowns as facts

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530
and and you accept the knowns as facts
 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.270
and and you accept the knowns as facts
and then we start to ask what does our

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280
and then we start to ask what does our
 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.910

mention a quick example I recently did a
project with physicians looking at why

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:06.049
project with physicians looking at why
 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:08.440
project with physicians looking at why
kids don't show up for well visits and a

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450
kids don't show up for well visits and a
 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.810
kids don't show up for well visits and a
clinic here in Oakland and we did a lot

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:10.820
clinic here in Oakland and we did a lot
 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.390
clinic here in Oakland and we did a lot
of the data analytics I do speak and

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400
of the data analytics I do speak and
 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.750
of the data analytics I do speak and
geospatial analytics and I use tools to

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760
geospatial analytics and I use tools to
 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.430
geospatial analytics and I use tools to
identify what neighborhoods those kids

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440
identify what neighborhoods those kids
 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.380
identify what neighborhoods those kids
were coming from but what was really

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:20.390
were coming from but what was really
 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:21.789
were coming from but what was really
important in this project was we

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799
important in this project was we
 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:23.650
important in this project was we
identified that and then we were trying

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660
identified that and then we were trying
 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:26.200
identified that and then we were trying
to solve the issue as to why they

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210
to solve the issue as to why they
 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:27.130
to solve the issue as to why they
weren't shown

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:27.140
weren't shown
 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:29.170
weren't shown
we had preconceived notions about

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180
we had preconceived notions about
 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.630
we had preconceived notions about
transportation and other issues that we

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:31.640
transportation and other issues that we
 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.360
transportation and other issues that we
we thought that we knew what it was but

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370
we thought that we knew what it was but
 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.870
we thought that we knew what it was but
what we ended up doing was convening a

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880
what we ended up doing was convening a
 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.490
what we ended up doing was convening a
facilitator to actually go into the

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500
facilitator to actually go into the
 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.640
facilitator to actually go into the
neighborhood work with the the actual

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650
neighborhood work with the the actual
 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:43.930
neighborhood work with the the actual
patients that weren't showing up in the

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940
patients that weren't showing up in the
 

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:45.640
patients that weren't showing up in the
families and we found out it was

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650
families and we found out it was
 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.620
families and we found out it was
actually a trust issue and it was a

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:47.630
actually a trust issue and it was a
 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:49.720
actually a trust issue and it was a
trust issue with not seeing the same

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:49.730
trust issue with not seeing the same
 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:51.820
trust issue with not seeing the same
physician every time that they were

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830
physician every time that they were
 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.010
physician every time that they were
coming to the clinic so I think that we

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020
coming to the clinic so I think that we
 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.600
coming to the clinic so I think that we
talked a little bit earlier about how do

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610
talked a little bit earlier about how do
 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:58.780
talked a little bit earlier about how do
we engage citizens in our research and

00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:58.790
we engage citizens in our research and
 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:01.180
we engage citizens in our research and
our projects and it that's probably one

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190
our projects and it that's probably one
 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:02.770
our projects and it that's probably one
of the more difficult things to look at

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.780
of the more difficult things to look at
 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.410
of the more difficult things to look at
especially when you're looking at cases

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:05.420
especially when you're looking at cases
 

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.750
especially when you're looking at cases
like this so this is one of the things

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:07.760
like this so this is one of the things
 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.510
like this so this is one of the things
that I think that you know we do well at

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520
that I think that you know we do well at
 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.040
that I think that you know we do well at
Carnegie Mellon and we do a lot of this

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050
Carnegie Mellon and we do a lot of this
 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:13.690
Carnegie Mellon and we do a lot of this
science well but how do we then engage

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:13.700
science well but how do we then engage
 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:15.970
science well but how do we then engage
the citizens and I want to mention one

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:15.980
the citizens and I want to mention one
 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:17.020
the citizens and I want to mention one
thing that I think we have another

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.030
thing that I think we have another
 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:19.540
thing that I think we have another
secret sauce to Carnegie Mellon and

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:19.550
secret sauce to Carnegie Mellon and
 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.280
secret sauce to Carnegie Mellon and
that's interdisciplinary but I would say

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:21.290
that's interdisciplinary but I would say
 

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:23.770
that's interdisciplinary but I would say
it's our students as well and so I want

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:23.780
it's our students as well and so I want
 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.510
it's our students as well and so I want
to give a shout out to the students that

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520
to give a shout out to the students that
 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.220
to give a shout out to the students that
we have there's probably far more

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:27.230
we have there's probably far more
 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:29.170
we have there's probably far more
projects than any of us know about that

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:29.180
projects than any of us know about that
 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.060
projects than any of us know about that
are happening here at Carnegie Mellon I

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:31.070
are happening here at Carnegie Mellon I
 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:33.040
are happening here at Carnegie Mellon I
see it in my classrooms and I see the

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.050
see it in my classrooms and I see the
 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:34.690
see it in my classrooms and I see the
engagement that the students have at

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:34.700
engagement that the students have at
 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:36.360
engagement that the students have at
different levels so I think that that's

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370
different levels so I think that that's
 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.430
different levels so I think that that's
something that we have to look forward

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:39.440
something that we have to look forward
 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.500
something that we have to look forward
to to engaging our students and then

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:41.510
to to engaging our students and then
 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:43.510
to to engaging our students and then
just very quickly the other work that I

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:43.520
just very quickly the other work that I
 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.150
just very quickly the other work that I
do is with architecture and planning and

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:46.160
do is with architecture and planning and
 

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.970
do is with architecture and planning and
add on Carter mentioned our project a

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:48.980
add on Carter mentioned our project a
 

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:50.350
add on Carter mentioned our project a
little bit earlier today but we're

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:50.360
little bit earlier today but we're
 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.900
little bit earlier today but we're
working on some really interesting

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:51.910
working on some really interesting
 

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:54.190
working on some really interesting
cross-disciplinary projects looking at

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:54.200
cross-disciplinary projects looking at
 

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.909
cross-disciplinary projects looking at
3d visualization and and using different

00:05:57.909 --> 00:05:57.919
3d visualization and and using different
 

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:00.700
3d visualization and and using different
kinds of tools to help inform citizens

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:00.710
kinds of tools to help inform citizens
 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:05.860
kinds of tools to help inform citizens

cities on a personal basis provide

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:22.430
cities on a personal basis provide
 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:24.820
cities on a personal basis provide
actually a great opportunity to work

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:24.830
actually a great opportunity to work
 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:30.400
actually a great opportunity to work
with people that I actually hadn't had

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:30.410
with people that I actually hadn't had
 

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:32.800
with people that I actually hadn't had
the opportunity before so when we

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:32.810
the opportunity before so when we
 

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:34.750
the opportunity before so when we
started Manuel and I were on sabbatical

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:34.760
started Manuel and I were on sabbatical
 

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:39.030

at NYU adcast we interact a lot with

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:39.040
at NYU adcast we interact a lot with
 

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.100
at NYU adcast we interact a lot with
and physicists that were looking at

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:41.110
and physicists that were looking at
 

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:44.280
and physicists that were looking at
problems of cities which was a surprise

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:44.290
problems of cities which was a surprise
 

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:47.520
problems of cities which was a surprise
why were these people concerned with the

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:47.530
why were these people concerned with the
 

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:51.470
why were these people concerned with the
high energy physics and particles in

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:51.480
high energy physics and particles in
 

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.970
high energy physics and particles in
accelerators and so forth why were they

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:53.980
accelerators and so forth why were they
 

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:57.120
accelerators and so forth why were they
looking at cities and their take was

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:57.130
looking at cities and their take was
 

00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:59.520
looking at cities and their take was
looking at cities from a scale point of

00:06:59.520 --> 00:06:59.530
looking at cities from a scale point of
 

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:03.300
looking at cities from a scale point of
view looking as which which is an

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:03.310
view looking as which which is an
 

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:06.990
view looking as which which is an
interesting point back to to CMU it

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:07.000
interesting point back to to CMU it
 

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.140
interesting point back to to CMU it
turned out that it also provided the

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:09.150
turned out that it also provided the
 

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:12.690
turned out that it also provided the
personally to me to go to a college that

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:12.700
personally to me to go to a college that
 

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:15.420
personally to me to go to a college that
I never worked with before I think which

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:15.430
I never worked with before I think which
 

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:19.260
I never worked with before I think which
was the your College architecture the

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:19.270
was the your College architecture the
 

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:22.290
was the your College architecture the
College of Arts I guess and we don't

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:22.300
College of Arts I guess and we don't
 

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:24.420
College of Arts I guess and we don't
Carter that is somewhere there and it

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:24.430
Carter that is somewhere there and it
 

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:26.400
Carter that is somewhere there and it
has been a pleasure because we talk

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:26.410
has been a pleasure because we talk
 

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:29.070
has been a pleasure because we talk
technology and he doesn't really talk

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:29.080
technology and he doesn't really talk
 

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:31.830
technology and he doesn't really talk
about arts but talks about the cities

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:31.840
about arts but talks about the cities
 

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:34.230
about arts but talks about the cities
and how the cities are organized and the

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:34.240
and how the cities are organized and the
 

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:37.500
and how the cities are organized and the
how whatever we do should impact impact

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:37.510
how whatever we do should impact impact
 

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:41.670
how whatever we do should impact impact
the cities and so Don Shawn came from

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:41.680
the cities and so Don Shawn came from
 

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.980
the cities and so Don Shawn came from
from Seville and the Heinz and the

Schumacher from ECE we have been for the

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:46.300
Schumacher from ECE we have been for the
 

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:49.710
Schumacher from ECE we have been for the
last couple of years brainstorming of

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:49.720
last couple of years brainstorming of
 

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:53.940
last couple of years brainstorming of
how do we look at the city and looking

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:53.950
how do we look at the city and looking
 

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:55.800
how do we look at the city and looking
at the city from an environmental point

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:55.810
at the city from an environmental point
 

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:57.600
at the city from an environmental point
of view looking at the city from the

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:57.610
of view looking at the city from the
 

00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:02.250
of view looking at the city from the
built infrastructure and this paths that

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:02.260
built infrastructure and this paths that
 

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.680
built infrastructure and this paths that
also are in the city which are the

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:04.690
also are in the city which are the
 

00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:08.460
also are in the city which are the
humans and we took the point of view of

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:08.470
humans and we took the point of view of
 

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:12.030
humans and we took the point of view of
looking at that system of systems as we

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:12.040
looking at that system of systems as we
 

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:14.670
looking at that system of systems as we
heard this morning looking at it from

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:14.680
heard this morning looking at it from
 

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:17.670
heard this morning looking at it from
the point of view of mobility so don't

00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:17.680
the point of view of mobility so don't
 

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:20.430
the point of view of mobility so don't
look at everything focus on mobility and

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:20.440
look at everything focus on mobility and
 

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:22.950
look at everything focus on mobility and
even focusing on mobility you get to see

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:22.960
even focusing on mobility you get to see
 

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:25.620
even focusing on mobility you get to see
lots of different dimensions so mobility

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:25.630
lots of different dimensions so mobility
 

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:27.900
lots of different dimensions so mobility
not as a social mobility or economic

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:27.910
not as a social mobility or economic
 

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:31.219
not as a social mobility or economic
mobility but mobility as try as

00:08:31.219 --> 00:08:31.229
mobility but mobility as try as
 

00:08:31.229 --> 00:08:34.740
mobility but mobility as try as
transferring people from A to B and

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:34.750
transferring people from A to B and
 

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:36.900
transferring people from A to B and
actually when you look at mobility and

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:36.910
actually when you look at mobility and
 

00:08:36.910 --> 00:08:38.670
actually when you look at mobility and
look at the city from that point of view

00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:38.680
look at the city from that point of view
 

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:43.080
look at the city from that point of view

but what was more compelling to me in

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:00.850
but what was more compelling to me in
 

00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:03.540
but what was more compelling to me in
some sense was the fact that I don't

it was the fact that in some sense there

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:06.490
it was the fact that in some sense there
 

00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:10.230
it was the fact that in some sense there
were people involved in all these cities

00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:10.240
were people involved in all these cities
 

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:13.050
were people involved in all these cities
that would need a lot of support from

that would need a lot of support from
 

00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:16.980
that would need a lot of support from

and 3rd and 7th Avenue and how we would
 

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.850
and 3rd and 7th Avenue and how we would
shoot these B and what would be the

impact of those decisions in the
 

00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:43.920
impact of those decisions in the
functioning of the city so I thought I

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:43.930
functioning of the city so I thought I
 

00:14:43.930 --> 00:14:45.450
functioning of the city so I thought I
mean and that is the longer a lot is

00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:45.460
mean and that is the longer a lot is
 

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:47.040
mean and that is the longer a lot is
decision making along the lines of the

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:47.050
decision making along the lines of the
 

00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:49.040
decision making along the lines of the
research I do in trying to automate

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:49.050
research I do in trying to automate
 

00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:52.140
research I do in trying to automate
agents to make decisions by combining

00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:52.150
agents to make decisions by combining
 

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:55.260
agents to make decisions by combining
data some kind of planning to achieve

00:14:55.260 --> 00:14:55.270
data some kind of planning to achieve
 

00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:58.140
data some kind of planning to achieve
goals and eventually actually making the

00:14:58.140 --> 00:14:58.150
goals and eventually actually making the
 

00:14:58.150 --> 00:15:01.110
goals and eventually actually making the
decisions but the aspect that I think

00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:01.120
decisions but the aspect that I think
 

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:02.940
decisions but the aspect that I think
that I would like to emphasize with us

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:02.950
that I would like to emphasize with us
 

00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:05.310
that I would like to emphasize with us
all here is that whatever we do in a

00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:05.320
all here is that whatever we do in a
 

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:09.930
all here is that whatever we do in a
city more than processing data making

00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:09.940
city more than processing data making
 

00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:12.840
city more than processing data making
analysis creating an infrastructure

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:12.850
analysis creating an infrastructure
 

00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:16.170
analysis creating an infrastructure
needs to be well justified for the

00:15:16.170 --> 00:15:16.180
needs to be well justified for the
 

00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:18.300
needs to be well justified for the
humans so there is this aspect in

00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:18.310
humans so there is this aspect in
 

00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:20.730
humans so there is this aspect in
machine learning in AI that it will not

00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:20.740
machine learning in AI that it will not
 

00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:23.160
machine learning in AI that it will not
help a city it will not help decision

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:23.170
help a city it will not help decision
 

00:15:23.170 --> 00:15:25.620
help a city it will not help decision

that just say yeah thanks kindergarten

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:28.810
that just say yeah thanks kindergarten
 

00:15:28.810 --> 00:15:31.260
that just say yeah thanks kindergarten
there and then the mayor or the humans

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:31.270
there and then the mayor or the humans
 

00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:31.860
there and then the mayor or the humans
involved

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:31.870
involved
 

00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:34.320
involved
in all these governance we'll ask why

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:34.330
in all these governance we'll ask why
 

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:37.440
in all these governance we'll ask why
and these machines will be black boxes

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:37.450
and these machines will be black boxes
 

00:15:37.450 --> 00:15:40.110
and these machines will be black boxes
that say because I say or something like

00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:40.120
that say because I say or something like
 

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:42.600
that say because I say or something like
this so that's the research I've done a

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:42.610
this so that's the research I've done a
 

00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:45.030
this so that's the research I've done a
lot and I believe it will be part of

00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:45.040
lot and I believe it will be part of
 

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:47.310
lot and I believe it will be part of
these automation of cities and the

00:15:47.310 --> 00:15:47.320
these automation of cities and the
 

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:49.290
these automation of cities and the
automation of all these processing of

00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:49.300
automation of all these processing of
 

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:51.660
automation of all these processing of
information and data and the support is

00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:51.670
information and data and the support is
 

00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:54.570
information and data and the support is
really to provide the interpretability

00:15:54.570 --> 00:15:54.580
really to provide the interpretability
 

00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:57.780
really to provide the interpretability
and the explanations that these data

00:15:57.780 --> 00:15:57.790
and the explanations that these data
 

00:15:57.790 --> 00:16:00.420
and the explanations that these data
analysis needs to provide and especially

00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:00.430
analysis needs to provide and especially
 

00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:04.140
analysis needs to provide and especially
to support decisions in cities which

00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:04.150
to support decisions in cities which
 

00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:06.510
to support decisions in cities which
cannot function without the involvement

00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:06.520
cannot function without the involvement
 

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:09.840
cannot function without the involvement
of people governing them and so that's

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:09.850
of people governing them and so that's
 

00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:12.900
of people governing them and so that's
one aspect that maybe it's common to

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:12.910
one aspect that maybe it's common to
 

00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:15.660
one aspect that maybe it's common to
also doctor's office but I think for

00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:15.670
also doctor's office but I think for
 

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:17.160
also doctor's office but I think for
cities in particular that so many

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:17.170
cities in particular that so many
 

00:16:17.170 --> 00:16:19.170
cities in particular that so many
decisions are long-lasting so you cannot

00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:19.180
decisions are long-lasting so you cannot
 

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:20.820
decisions are long-lasting so you cannot
decide I'm going to put this building

00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:20.830
decide I'm going to put this building
 

00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:23.010
decide I'm going to put this building
here and tomorrow yeah yeah by the way

00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:23.020
here and tomorrow yeah yeah by the way
 

00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:24.720
here and tomorrow yeah yeah by the way
I'm going to move it to the next corner

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:24.730
I'm going to move it to the next corner
 

00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:27.600
I'm going to move it to the next corner
so this is a type of from a mathematical

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:27.610
so this is a type of from a mathematical
 

00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:29.790
so this is a type of from a mathematical
point of view of decisions that are

00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:29.800
point of view of decisions that are
 

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:31.920
point of view of decisions that are
different in a decision that the robot

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:31.930
different in a decision that the robot
 

00:16:31.930 --> 00:16:33.870
different in a decision that the robot
or an agent does in turning left because

00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:33.880
or an agent does in turning left because
 

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:36.300
or an agent does in turning left because
it can recover it can recover afterwards

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:36.310
it can recover it can recover afterwards
 

00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:39.180
it can recover it can recover afterwards
in cities that these meetings with the

00:16:39.180 --> 00:16:39.190
in cities that these meetings with the
 

00:16:39.190 --> 00:16:41.490
in cities that these meetings with the
city of New York officers who were very

00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:41.500
city of New York officers who were very
 

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:43.470
city of New York officers who were very
kind of striking for the long-lasting

00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:43.480
kind of striking for the long-lasting
 

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:45.480
kind of striking for the long-lasting
decisions you decide to change the

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:45.490
decisions you decide to change the
 

00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:47.730
decisions you decide to change the
traffic like that and it stays like that

00:16:47.730 --> 00:16:47.740
traffic like that and it stays like that
 

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:49.440
traffic like that and it stays like that
you decide to put an building like

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:49.450
you decide to put an building like
 

00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:51.990
you decide to put an building like
therein stays like that so I really

00:16:51.990 --> 00:16:52.000
therein stays like that so I really
 

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.480
therein stays like that so I really
think that the explanation process and

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:54.490
think that the explanation process and
 

00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:57.269
think that the explanation process and
getting input from humans and biases and

00:16:57.269 --> 00:16:57.279
getting input from humans and biases and
 

00:16:57.279 --> 00:17:00.180
getting input from humans and biases and
all sorts of like being in these

00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:00.190
all sorts of like being in these
 

00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:02.880
all sorts of like being in these
interpretability and explanation mode is

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:02.890
interpretability and explanation mode is
 

00:17:02.890 --> 00:17:05.929
interpretability and explanation mode is
essential for the automation of a city

00:17:05.929 --> 00:17:05.939
essential for the automation of a city
 

00:17:05.939 --> 00:17:09.360
essential for the automation of a city
Thank You Manuela thank you for all to

00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:09.370
Thank You Manuela thank you for all to
 

00:17:09.370 --> 00:17:12.059
Thank You Manuela thank you for all to
all the panelists to kick this off my

00:17:12.059 --> 00:17:12.069
all the panelists to kick this off my
 

00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:14.069
all the panelists to kick this off my
plan by the way is to ask one or two

00:17:14.069 --> 00:17:14.079
plan by the way is to ask one or two
 

00:17:14.079 --> 00:17:16.319
plan by the way is to ask one or two
questions or have the panelists ask each

00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:16.329
questions or have the panelists ask each
 

00:17:16.329 --> 00:17:18.630
questions or have the panelists ask each
other questions and then open it up to

00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:18.640
other questions and then open it up to
 

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:21.630
other questions and then open it up to
the to the audience the first question I

00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:21.640
the to the audience the first question I
 

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:22.949
the to the audience the first question I
have is you know we've talked a lot

00:17:22.949 --> 00:17:22.959
have is you know we've talked a lot
 

00:17:22.959 --> 00:17:25.110
have is you know we've talked a lot
about the cities being you know systems

00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:25.120
about the cities being you know systems
 

00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:28.890
about the cities being you know systems
of systems and we'll the science be a

00:17:28.890 --> 00:17:28.900
of systems and we'll the science be a
 

00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:32.190
of systems and we'll the science be a
science of Sciences in other words is

this is the science of cities a pullet

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:34.570
this is the science of cities a pullet
 

00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:36.750
this is the science of cities a pullet
is it a political science is it a social

00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:36.760
is it a political science is it a social
 

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:39.990

information science I mean I I think

00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:42.840
information science I mean I I think
 

00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:45.150

parts of all those sign

00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:45.160
parts of all those sign
 

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:49.350
parts of all those sign
are going to have to impact this science

00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:49.360
are going to have to impact this science
 

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:52.800
are going to have to impact this science
of cities and will we ever get to a an

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:52.810
of cities and will we ever get to a an
 

00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:55.230
of cities and will we ever get to a an
understanding of the nones of a city

00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:55.240
understanding of the nones of a city
 

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:57.360
understanding of the nones of a city
that will allow us to be predictive as

00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:57.370
that will allow us to be predictive as
 

00:17:57.370 --> 00:17:59.520
that will allow us to be predictive as
josée said I think being predictive is

00:17:59.520 --> 00:17:59.530
josée said I think being predictive is
 

00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:02.970
josée said I think being predictive is

anybody want to talk about that let me

00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:05.710
anybody want to talk about that let me
 

00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:08.160
anybody want to talk about that let me
start by making one point which is

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:08.170
start by making one point which is
 

00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:09.180
start by making one point which is
especially important to keep in mind

00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:09.190
especially important to keep in mind
 

00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:10.590
especially important to keep in mind
when we're thinking about human services

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:10.600
when we're thinking about human services
 

00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:14.250
when we're thinking about human services
and criminal justice and it's that data

00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:14.260
and criminal justice and it's that data
 

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:16.620
and criminal justice and it's that data
is not neutral and data is not objective

00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:16.630
is not neutral and data is not objective
 

00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:18.180
is not neutral and data is not objective
if you think about the sort of data that

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:18.190
if you think about the sort of data that
 

00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:20.370
if you think about the sort of data that
we collect on citizens at this point in

00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:20.380
we collect on citizens at this point in
 

00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:21.300
we collect on citizens at this point in
time and what we have available

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:21.310
time and what we have available
 

00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:23.550

historically this has been shaped by

00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:23.560
historically this has been shaped by
 

00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:26.760
historically this has been shaped by
decades of processes societal political

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:26.770
decades of processes societal political
 

00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:29.100
decades of processes societal political
and many of those processes have been

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:29.110
and many of those processes have been
 

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:30.900
and many of those processes have been
discriminatory so if you're thinking

00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:30.910
discriminatory so if you're thinking
 

00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:32.700
discriminatory so if you're thinking
about even built infrastructure and

00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:32.710
about even built infrastructure and
 

00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:34.200
about even built infrastructure and
you're ruling out certain locations

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:34.210
you're ruling out certain locations
 

00:18:34.210 --> 00:18:35.760
you're ruling out certain locations
because currently they do not look very

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:35.770
because currently they do not look very
 

00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:38.460
because currently they do not look very
good it doesn't mean that that's an

good it doesn't mean that that's an
 

00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:40.710
good it doesn't mean that that's an
objective fact about those locations or

00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:40.720
objective fact about those locations or
 

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:43.230
objective fact about those locations or
those communities and it's certainly not

00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:43.240
those communities and it's certainly not
 

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:45.150

the case that just because you're
 

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:47.070
the case that just because you're
finding crime were you bothered to go

00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:47.080
finding crime were you bothered to go
 

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:49.650
finding crime were you bothered to go
search for it that that's a practice you

00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:49.660
search for it that that's a practice you
 

00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:52.320
search for it that that's a practice you
should perpetuate so part of I think the

better use of our data and an important
 

00:18:57.190 --> 00:18:58.800
better use of our data and an important
part of that is making sure that we

00:18:58.800 --> 00:18:58.810
part of that is making sure that we
 

00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:00.900
part of that is making sure that we
understand the process that generated

00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:00.910
understand the process that generated
 

00:19:00.910 --> 00:19:02.970

mention that the solution to our project

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:19.570
mention that the solution to our project

mention that the solution to our project
with the no-show patience was to open a

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:21.010
with the no-show patience was to open a
 

00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:22.680
with the no-show patience was to open a
clinic in the neighborhood where those

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:22.690
clinic in the neighborhood where those
 

00:19:22.690 --> 00:19:24.870
clinic in the neighborhood where those
patients were located but I think a lot

00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:24.880
patients were located but I think a lot
 

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:26.220
patients were located but I think a lot
of it too is communication

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:26.230
of it too is communication
 

00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:29.370
of it too is communication
and you know we do a lot of this you

00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:29.380
and you know we do a lot of this you
 

00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:31.080
and you know we do a lot of this you
know if you look at the panel even here

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:31.090
know if you look at the panel even here
 

00:19:31.090 --> 00:19:33.300
know if you look at the panel even here
we have many different areas that we're

00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:33.310
we have many different areas that we're
 

00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:34.950
we have many different areas that we're
working in and how do we communicate

00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:34.960
working in and how do we communicate
 

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:37.170
working in and how do we communicate
that especially across areas that were

00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:37.180
that especially across areas that were
 

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:40.170
that especially across areas that were
not necessarily affiliated with so I

00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:40.180
not necessarily affiliated with so I
 

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:41.670
not necessarily affiliated with so I
think that when we look at the science

00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:41.680
think that when we look at the science
 

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:43.020
think that when we look at the science
of this I would say yes to all of the

00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:43.030
of this I would say yes to all of the
 

00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:44.370
of this I would say yes to all of the
above that you had asked and I would say

00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:44.380
above that you had asked and I would say
 

00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:46.380
above that you had asked and I would say
plus more anymore they were not talking

00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:46.390
plus more anymore they were not talking
 

00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:48.000
plus more anymore they were not talking
right because I think that there is a

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:48.010
right because I think that there is a
 

00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:50.760
right because I think that there is a
lot to this that again goes external to

00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:50.770
lot to this that again goes external to
 

00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:54.870
lot to this that again goes external to
other kinds of disciplines so I just

00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:54.880
other kinds of disciplines so I just
 

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:57.960
other kinds of disciplines so I just
want to add one point I think you guys

00:19:57.960 --> 00:19:57.970
want to add one point I think you guys
 

00:19:57.970 --> 00:19:58.820
want to add one point I think you guys
covered

00:19:58.820 --> 00:19:58.830
covered
 

00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:03.220
covered
well but the unintended consequences so

00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:03.230
well but the unintended consequences so
 

00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:08.240
well but the unintended consequences so
as we were brainstorming with one of the

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:08.250
as we were brainstorming with one of the
 

00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:10.910
as we were brainstorming with one of the
local communities and my emphasis as I

00:20:10.910 --> 00:20:10.920
local communities and my emphasis as I
 

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:14.300
local communities and my emphasis as I
say is look at traffic and mobility and

00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:14.310
say is look at traffic and mobility and
 

00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:18.860
say is look at traffic and mobility and
how people go from A to B the person

00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:18.870
how people go from A to B the person
 

00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:21.260
how people go from A to B the person
from that community said well actually

00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:21.270
from that community said well actually
 

00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:25.280
from that community said well actually
we have no cameras so we couldn't look

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:25.290
we have no cameras so we couldn't look
 

00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:28.130
we have no cameras so we couldn't look
at again but if you by any reason by

00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:28.140
at again but if you by any reason by
 

00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:30.940
at again but if you by any reason by
looking at ways or Google or whatever

00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:30.950
looking at ways or Google or whatever
 

00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:34.610

00:24:46.019 --> 00:24:46.029
pathi size what will happen if we change
 

00:24:46.029 --> 00:24:48.539
pathi size what will happen if we change
these traffic what will happen if a

the parade of the st. Patrick's parade

00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:56.320
the parade of the st. Patrick's parade
 

00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:59.310
the parade of the st. Patrick's parade
takes over all 5th Avenue so there is a

00:24:59.310 --> 00:24:59.320
takes over all 5th Avenue so there is a
 

00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:02.549
takes over all 5th Avenue so there is a
lot of counterfactuals that people need

00:25:02.549 --> 00:25:02.559
lot of counterfactuals that people need
 

00:25:02.559 --> 00:25:05.279
lot of counterfactuals that people need
to solve and need to come up with models

00:25:05.279 --> 00:25:05.289
to solve and need to come up with models
 

00:25:05.289 --> 00:25:07.769
to solve and need to come up with models
of what happens and for those we can

00:25:07.769 --> 00:25:07.779
of what happens and for those we can
 

00:25:07.779 --> 00:25:10.859
of what happens and for those we can
have both also computer science and

00:25:10.859 --> 00:25:10.869
have both also computer science and
 

00:25:10.869 --> 00:25:12.419
have both also computer science and
machine learning solutions and

00:25:12.419 --> 00:25:12.429
machine learning solutions and
 

00:25:12.429 --> 00:25:14.399
machine learning solutions and

engineering in which we kind of can
 

00:25:14.409 --> 00:25:18.049
engineering in which we kind of can
simulate these very complex systems to

to try to stretch their sensitivity to
 

00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:25.499
to try to stretch their sensitivity to
dynamics and to change so we can

dynamics and to change so we can
 

00:25:25.509 --> 00:25:29.430

people be ready for all these outliers

00:25:32.789 --> 00:25:32.799
people be ready for all these outliers
 

00:25:32.799 --> 00:25:36.089
people be ready for all these outliers
of the distributions because it seems

00:25:36.089 --> 00:25:36.099
of the distributions because it seems

collapse so the outliers in some sense

00:25:47.009 --> 00:25:47.019
collapse so the outliers in some sense
 

00:25:47.019 --> 00:25:49.769

are things in which the technology can
 

00:25:49.779 --> 00:25:53.999
are things in which the technology can
make great contributions because maybe

00:25:53.999 --> 00:25:54.009
make great contributions because maybe
 

00:25:54.009 --> 00:25:56.070
make great contributions because maybe
we already have thought of those

00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:56.080
we already have thought of those
 

00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:59.099
we already have thought of those
situations if we train systems to be

00:25:59.099 --> 00:25:59.109
situations if we train systems to be
 

00:25:59.109 --> 00:26:01.200
situations if we train systems to be
able to think about counterfactuals and

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:01.210
able to think about counterfactuals and
 

00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:03.659
able to think about counterfactuals and
that's like one area that I think it's

00:26:03.659 --> 00:26:03.669
that's like one area that I think it's
 

00:26:03.669 --> 00:26:05.330
that's like one area that I think it's
very important is this kind of like

00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:05.340
very important is this kind of like
 

00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:09.210
very important is this kind of like

you and your colleagues reconcile the
academic incentives I guess at the

00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:36.530
academic incentives I guess at the
 

00:26:36.530 --> 00:26:38.560
academic incentives I guess at the
various levels of progression within the

00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:38.570
various levels of progression within the
 

00:26:38.570 --> 00:26:40.740
various levels of progression within the
academic cycle with the fact that

00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:40.750
academic cycle with the fact that
 

00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:43.240
academic cycle with the fact that
challenges facing local governments and

00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:43.250
challenges facing local governments and
 

00:26:43.250 --> 00:26:44.640
challenges facing local governments and
communities are inherently very

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:44.650
communities are inherently very
 

00:26:44.650 --> 00:26:47.020
communities are inherently very
cross-disciplinary and do you think that

00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:47.030
cross-disciplinary and do you think that
 

00:26:47.030 --> 00:26:49.450
cross-disciplinary and do you think that
academia as a whole is sort of well

00:26:49.450 --> 00:26:49.460
academia as a whole is sort of well
 

00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:51.010
academia as a whole is sort of well
incentivized to solve these kind of

00:26:51.010 --> 00:26:51.020
incentivized to solve these kind of
 

00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:52.450
incentivized to solve these kind of
challenges and what can we do to

00:26:52.450 --> 00:26:52.460
challenges and what can we do to
 

00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:54.220
challenges and what can we do to
encourage that kind of behavior going

00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:54.230
encourage that kind of behavior going
 

00:26:54.230 --> 00:27:00.910
encourage that kind of behavior going
forward I'll jump in and start because

00:27:00.910 --> 00:27:00.920
forward I'll jump in and start because
 

00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:04.390
forward I'll jump in and start because
my project is very much the eye on the

00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:04.400
my project is very much the eye on the
 

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:06.190
my project is very much the eye on the
end of our project is can this actually

00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:06.200
end of our project is can this actually
 

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:08.410
end of our project is can this actually
be implemented in the city and so I

00:27:08.410 --> 00:27:08.420
be implemented in the city and so I
 

00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:09.730
be implemented in the city and so I
think that that has to be thought out

00:27:09.730 --> 00:27:09.740
think that that has to be thought out
 

00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:12.040
think that that has to be thought out
when we do all of these projects and and

00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:12.050
when we do all of these projects and and
 

00:27:12.050 --> 00:27:13.840
when we do all of these projects and and
I think that the panel this morning

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:13.850
I think that the panel this morning
 

00:27:13.850 --> 00:27:15.700
I think that the panel this morning
talked about this with the deans you

00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:15.710
talked about this with the deans you
 

00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:18.549
talked about this with the deans you
know how can we do this financially we

00:27:18.549 --> 00:27:18.559
know how can we do this financially we
 

00:27:18.559 --> 00:27:20.020
know how can we do this financially we
can't do any of this without the city

00:27:20.020 --> 00:27:20.030
can't do any of this without the city
 

00:27:20.030 --> 00:27:22.090
can't do any of this without the city
frankly we could do all of this research

00:27:22.090 --> 00:27:22.100
frankly we could do all of this research
 

00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:24.610
frankly we could do all of this research
but we can't deploy it so I think that

00:27:24.610 --> 00:27:24.620
but we can't deploy it so I think that
 

00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:27.040
but we can't deploy it so I think that
for me at least throughout all of our

00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:27.050
for me at least throughout all of our
 

00:27:27.050 --> 00:27:28.450
for me at least throughout all of our
project is we bring in the

00:27:28.450 --> 00:27:28.460
project is we bring in the
 

00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:31.570
project is we bring in the
interdisciplinary team that we need to

00:27:31.570 --> 00:27:31.580
interdisciplinary team that we need to
 

00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:33.310
interdisciplinary team that we need to
solve these problems but I think it's

00:27:33.310 --> 00:27:33.320
solve these problems but I think it's
 

00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:35.380
solve these problems but I think it's
also goes beyond that it goes to the

00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:35.390
also goes beyond that it goes to the
 

00:27:35.390 --> 00:27:36.610
also goes beyond that it goes to the
understanding of the different

00:27:36.610 --> 00:27:36.620
understanding of the different
 

00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:39.250
understanding of the different
disciplines we so much work in silos and

00:27:39.250 --> 00:27:39.260
disciplines we so much work in silos and
 

00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:41.680
disciplines we so much work in silos and
we may not understand so the project

00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:41.690
we may not understand so the project
 

00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:43.030
we may not understand so the project
that I'm working on has entertainment

00:27:43.030 --> 00:27:43.040
that I'm working on has entertainment

educate a lot of these projects as well

00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:52.670
educate a lot of these projects as well
 

00:27:52.670 --> 00:27:57.610
educate a lot of these projects as well
especially the interdisciplinary so I

00:27:57.610 --> 00:27:57.620
especially the interdisciplinary so I
 

00:27:57.620 --> 00:27:59.260
especially the interdisciplinary so I
was going to add to that that if there's

00:27:59.260 --> 00:27:59.270
was going to add to that that if there's
 

00:27:59.270 --> 00:28:01.360
was going to add to that that if there's
any university that could do well in

00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:01.370
any university that could do well in
 

00:28:01.370 --> 00:28:03.940
any university that could do well in
those terms its Carnegie Mellon right so

00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:03.950
those terms its Carnegie Mellon right so
 

00:28:03.950 --> 00:28:06.600
those terms its Carnegie Mellon right so
we already do this almost in our DNA

we already do this almost in our DNA
 

00:28:06.610 --> 00:28:09.070
we already do this almost in our DNA
second point I want to make is you you

00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:09.080
second point I want to make is you you
 

00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:11.380
second point I want to make is you you
are correct that academia being what it

00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:11.390
are correct that academia being what it
 

00:28:11.390 --> 00:28:14.140
are correct that academia being what it
is to ask a junior faculty member to

00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:14.150
is to ask a junior faculty member to
 

00:28:14.150 --> 00:28:17.500
is to ask a junior faculty member to
spread himself or herself in by many

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:17.510
spread himself or herself in by many
 

00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:19.150
spread himself or herself in by many
engagements which may not be directly

focused on all the obvious metrics of
 

00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:25.630
focused on all the obvious metrics of
academic success might be bad advice but

00:28:25.630 --> 00:28:25.640
academic success might be bad advice but
 

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:27.280
academic success might be bad advice but
you know eventually you get to be a full

00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:27.290
you know eventually you get to be a full
 

00:28:27.290 --> 00:28:29.890
you know eventually you get to be a full
professor they don't tell you what your

00:28:29.890 --> 00:28:29.900
professor they don't tell you what your
 

00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:33.430
professor they don't tell you what your
full off at that point okay well you

00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:33.440
full off at that point okay well you
 

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:35.950
full off at that point okay well you
hopefully have a few more decades left

00:28:35.950 --> 00:28:35.960
hopefully have a few more decades left
 

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:38.799
hopefully have a few more decades left
and so there is no reason I look at my

00:28:38.799 --> 00:28:38.809
and so there is no reason I look at my
 

00:28:38.809 --> 00:28:40.720
and so there is no reason I look at my

of the physicists and I start saying oh
 

00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:38.109
of the physicists and I start saying oh
maybe we should look at at cities and

00:30:38.109 --> 00:30:38.119
maybe we should look at at cities and
 

00:30:38.119 --> 00:30:40.269
maybe we should look at at cities and
try to understand the DNA of the city

00:30:40.269 --> 00:30:40.279
try to understand the DNA of the city
 

00:30:40.279 --> 00:30:42.070

so he said we look we should look at

00:31:00.569 --> 00:31:00.579
so he said we look we should look at
 

00:31:00.579 --> 00:31:02.639
so he said we look we should look at
just like in physics there are particles

00:31:02.639 --> 00:31:02.649
just like in physics there are particles
 

00:31:02.649 --> 00:31:05.129
just like in physics there are particles
and particles follow certain rules and

00:31:05.129 --> 00:31:05.139
and particles follow certain rules and
 

00:31:05.139 --> 00:31:07.379
and particles follow certain rules and
the physical rules and so they engage

00:31:07.379 --> 00:31:07.389
the physical rules and so they engage
 

00:31:07.389 --> 00:31:09.209
the physical rules and so they engage
among themselves and form these very

00:31:09.209 --> 00:31:09.219
among themselves and form these very
 

00:31:09.219 --> 00:31:13.019
among themselves and form these very
complex systems we should look at the

00:31:13.019 --> 00:31:13.029
complex systems we should look at the
 

00:31:13.029 --> 00:31:15.569
complex systems we should look at the

wrong by the way but an equivalent and
tried to explain biology from the point

00:31:21.599 --> 00:31:21.609
tried to explain biology from the point
 

00:31:21.609 --> 00:31:24.419
tried to explain biology from the point
of view of interactions of these very

of view of interactions of these very
 

00:31:24.429 --> 00:31:27.509

to do with the you are the one who is
going to tell me then what to do with

00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:10.330
going to tell me then what to do with
 

00:33:10.330 --> 00:33:13.109
going to tell me then what to do with
those with with the the results of this

00:33:13.109 --> 00:33:13.119
those with with the the results of this
 

00:33:13.119 --> 00:33:17.159
those with with the the results of this
technology so I kind of now try to look

00:33:17.159 --> 00:33:17.169
technology so I kind of now try to look
 

00:33:17.169 --> 00:33:19.529

the other way around why is this useful
 

00:33:19.539 --> 00:33:22.139
the other way around why is this useful
to solve which particular problems what

are the questions that you want me to

00:33:24.899 --> 00:33:24.909
are the questions that you want me to
 

00:33:24.909 --> 00:33:28.560
are the questions that you want me to
address so can I take a different tack

00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:28.570
address so can I take a different tack

on this so Raj you may be absolutely

00:33:29.999 --> 00:33:30.009
on this so Raj you may be absolutely
 

00:33:30.009 --> 00:33:31.590
on this so Raj you may be absolutely
right but it may be too soon

they may emerge and have similarities
 

00:34:15.429 --> 00:34:18.599
they may emerge and have similarities
and even more interestingly they may

and even more interestingly they may
 

00:34:18.609 --> 00:34:21.359
and even more interestingly they may
have differences in the solutions and it

00:34:21.359 --> 00:34:21.369
have differences in the solutions and it
 

00:34:21.369 --> 00:34:23.700

that will emerge models of parts of the

00:48:06.630 --> 00:48:06.640
that will emerge models of parts of the
