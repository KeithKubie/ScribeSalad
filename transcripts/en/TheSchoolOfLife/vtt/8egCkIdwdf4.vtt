00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.090
It’s often hard not to feel envious of them
- as they ascend the stage to collect another

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:12.130
prize, float their start-up company, are promoted
a decade ahead of their peers or dominate

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:18.970
the music charts or bestseller lists. Over-achievers
torment us rather a lot.

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:24.530
But we should, more rightly, combine our envy
with a little compassion. It is likely that

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:30.931
these gifted souls are paying an oddly elevated
price for their extraordinary successes, so

00:00:30.931 --> 00:00:35.829
much so that - once their full psychological
profiles are in view - we should start to

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:40.370
feel a bit sorry for the trajectory of their
lives.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:45.590
What distinguishes over-achievers from the
simply highly talented or driven is what powers

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:51.430
them in their work. They labour principally
or primarily not because they uniquely enjoy

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.910
what they do or have more urgent material
demands than the rest of us, but because they

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:03.920
are subject to unusually intense internal,
psychological pressures. Behind their relentless

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:10.110
activity lies an emotional rather than professional
burden. It may look as if they simply want

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:16.290
to sell more books, accumulate more shares
or have their name in lights. But these over-achievers

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.540
are all the while trying to secure something
far more tricky, unusual and unmentioned:

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.700
they are trying - through their work - to
correct an aspect of a troubled emotional

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:33.409
past. They are trying to impress a father
who felt withholding and severe around them

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:39.130
three decades before. They’re hoping their
triumphs will compensate a parent they loved

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:44.030
for the loss of a sibling in childhood. They
are hoping to assuage a feeling of catastrophe

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.840
they experienced in the deprived chaotic home
of their birth.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.780
In other words, over-achievers are trying
to solve a range of psychological problems

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:00.549
through material or worldly means. This is
why their efforts must, in a deep sense, always

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:06.640
be doomed to failure - even when it appears
to most of the world as if they are succeeding

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.009
beyond measure.

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:14.120
Because success is the moment when over-achievers
are likely to notice the doomed nature of

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:21.040
their ambition, it is a particularly troubling
and dangerous eventuality. Depression may

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.780
set in just after the company is sold; the
star will fall into a crisis just after they

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.790
finally gain worldwide recognition. At exactly
the point when their work is acclaimed or

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:37.720
finds its audience, over-achievers are at
risk of severe breakdown. So long as they

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:43.090
are merely running, they can forget to notice
that their goal is misaligned with their true

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.820
inner ambition. They must wait for success
to reveal the fateful nature of their life’s

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:49.820
quest.

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:50.820
This also explains why holidays are a particular
trial for over-achievers, for even a few days

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:51.820
off can allow emotional insights to break
through (amidst the palm trees). No rest is

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:52.820
really the optimal state.

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.350
The cure for over-achievement involves pausing
to address the psychological wounds that made

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:03.300
hard work feel like the only defence against
intolerable trauma. It means returning to

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.740
the situations that made achievement feel
life sustaining. It means a confrontation

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:14.840
with moments of loss, disconnection, lack
of love, sadness and humiliation.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:20.220
The recovering over-achiever should allow
themselves to feel compassion for their earlier

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.390
self, acknowledging how much they wish could
have gone differently and grasping how their

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:32.040
present so-called successful personality has
been shaped as a response to grave wounds.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:39.140
The cure for over-achievement lies in mourning
and analysis in an atmosphere of love.

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:44.230
The over-achiever may eventually come to believe
that they deserve a place on the earth whether

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:50.209
they work or not. They aren’t there just
to perform. The greater need is to connect

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:52.230
and to understand.

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:57.920
We live in a world very interested in huge
achievements and very uninclined to notice

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:04.030
the trauma behind them. We are equally not
encouraged to note the way in which contentment

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:09.739
with modest achievement can be a sign that
things have gone very well for someone emotionally.

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:16.380
It is evidence of health to have no particular
wish to be famous and not to mind too much

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.359
if one doesn’t have a fortune; to be able
to have a so-called ordinary life, to take

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:19.870
pleasure in holidays and to place friendship
and love at the center of things. We should,

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:26.900
on occasion, dare to feel rather sorry for
over-achievers - even if that can mean starting

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.600
to feel sorry for ourselves.
