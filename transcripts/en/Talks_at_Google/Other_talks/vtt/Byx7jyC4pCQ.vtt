BERNIE GLASSMAN: So my name is
Bernie, born in Brooklyn, went

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.100
to undergraduate school in
aeronautical engineering.

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:17.700
I went to LA to work in
interplanetary work for a

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.560
while, but had a dual track.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.410
I got involved in Zen studies.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:28.150
I lived at a Zen center
with my wife and kids.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:35.310
And I started teaching Zen in
1967, probably before many of

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.610
you were born.

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.630
Moved back to New York 1980s.

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:52.130
At McDonnell Douglas, I had
a Ph.D. in applied math.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.220
I originally was, like I say,
interplanetary work, which is

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.580
dynamics, but then got
involved in software

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:00.980
validation.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.480
In those early days, there was
really no way of knowing

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.900
whether software had bugs in it
or not, until they failed.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.420
And of course we were putting
software in manned missions,

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.740
and nuclear reactors.

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:24.610
So some people had the good idea
that we should work on

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.920
figuring out whether the
software will work, and

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.960
especially given different
conditions.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.830
There's so many different
initial conditions.

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:39.090
So I got involved in that field
for McDonnell Douglas

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.240
corporate-wide, which had plants
in LA and St. Louis.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:50.020
But in 1980, I moved back to
New York, actually to the

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.570
Bronx, to a place called
Riverdale.

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.210
I started something called the
Zen Community of New York.

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:01.510
I was born about 75 years ago
in Brooklyn to a Jewish

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.310
Socialist family.

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:09.990
So in my blood I had social
activism as part of my DNA.

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:17.655
And when I moved back, I wanted
to teach Zen, but also

00:02:17.655 --> 00:02:24.600
get involved in social
action things.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:34.460
And I was particularly
interested in something that's

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:39.900
called mandala practice, a
holistic approach to social

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.290
action, where you look at five
different types of energies.

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:50.420
You look at spiritual energy,
training energy, social action

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.390
energy, livelihood energy,
and relationships energy.

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.920
And you try to cover
the gamut.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.830
I decided to work in
homelessness in 1982.

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:10.220
And I looked at a city called
Yonkers, which many of you

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.820
probably know.

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.550
It's a little north of here, in
Westchester County, right

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:15.820
north of the Bronx.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.980
And it had the highest per
capita homeless rate in the

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.252
country at that time.

00:03:20.252 --> 00:03:23.420
And Westchester County was one
of the wealthiest counties in

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.840
the country at that time.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.770
So it seemed like an interesting
place to look.

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:29.600
At it and I looked at
it holistically.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.520
And so we started creating
housing.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.950
But you need jobs in order
to not have the

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.190
housing become slums.

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.040
And since we were dealing with
a lot of single parent

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.640
families, you needed childcare
in order for them

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:42.790
to be able to work.

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.960
And then, because there's a lot
of drugs in their history,

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.670
you needed counseling work,
and family therapy work.

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.810
And then I was asked to get
involved with AIDS when it

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.600
first started becoming
a big deal.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.170
And so I created housing for
folks with AIDS, and a health

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.320
center for HIV positive
people.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.260
That's all going.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.890
It's about 30 years
in progress.

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.670
And it's not as big as Google.

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:11.920
But it is doing good work.

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:19.230
And we brought some cookies
from the Greyston Bakery,

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.160
which has an interesting
hiring policy.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.070
In fact, today, they have
an open hiring.

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.840
Their policy is when there are
openings, it's first come,

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:30.770
first serve.

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.270
We don't do any background
checks.

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.060
So we are hiring a lot of people
that have never worked

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.660
before, or their work
was dealing drugs.

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:46.980
And homeless people, a lot of
people with prison records--

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:50.430
probably everybody homeless
has prison records.

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:51.950
But we don't do any checking.

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:55.810
And then we break the workers
down into teams.

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:58.620
And of course everybody
in the team, they

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:59.150
all know each other.

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.180
They're all from the hood.

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.080
So if somebody comes in
to their team, and

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.410
they know the person.

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:07.470
And if they're paid
a certain amount.

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:11.480
If they overproduce, they
produce more, they split in

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:12.920
the profits.

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:17.330
So they have the incentive of
teaching the person who's

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:21.980
coming into their team to do
well if the person is there

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:25.650
just to get enough money to get
some drugs next week, then

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:26.840
that person won't do well.

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.410
And they will let go
of that person.

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.740
Buddhism--

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:37.310
Zen is just one school
of Buddhism.

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:40.650
Buddhism is about
experiencing the

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:42.780
interconnectedness of life.

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.360
The folks that we have, that
we take off the street and

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:51.290
have started work, most of them,
their interconnection

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:54.170
stops at their own body,
at themselves.

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:01.765
Coming through our teamwork,
they start seeing the

00:06:01.765 --> 00:06:04.360
interconnectedness
of the group.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.240
They may not think
of it that way.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.580
But they are interested
in helping the

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.250
other people do well.

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:14.590
Because they see that
it affects them.

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:17.239
AUDIENCE: Do you also get teams
where the dynamic works

00:06:17.239 --> 00:06:19.460
in reverse, and everyone
on the team is--

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:20.710
BERNIE GLASSMAN: We haven't.

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:27.030
But this teamwork thing has
only been in effect since

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:30.200
about 1990.

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:35.560
So in that short period of
history, we have not yet had a

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.460
case like that.

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:39.785
So that's pretty cool.

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:47.160
Anyway, having done that
work, I then am

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:48.410
feeling good about it.

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:49.580
And I travel around the world.

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.670
And I met other people doing
wonderful things.

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:54.580
I started getting involved
in volunteering

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:58.081
in different countries.

00:06:58.081 --> 00:07:02.760
I worked with the untouchables
in India, in Africa, in Rwanda

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:10.750
with the sorrow and grief from
the 20 year genocide, in

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:20.265
Brazil, in Europe, Sri Lanka,
different places.

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:28.040
About 15 years ago I moved
to Santa Barbara.

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:31.400
And about a year before that I
had seen this movie that I

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:33.850
started off with, asking
about, called "The Big

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:36.460
Lebowski." I loved the movie.

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:41.070
Now, I don't know if you have to
be a New York Jew to really

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:41.710
love the movie.

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:45.700
I don't think so, because it
became quite a cult movie.

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:51.110
And of course there's only one
guy in that movie that really

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:52.220
claims to be Jewish.

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:56.640
And that's John Goodman,
who married a Jew.

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:01.658
Anyway, I don't want to spoil
it for the two of you who

00:08:01.658 --> 00:08:04.170
haven't seen it.

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:07.810
But The Dude is a very
interesting character.

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:11.590
And the lines, for
me, were very

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:14.070
interesting in that movie.

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:16.540
And when I met Jeff Bridges--

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:17.950
who plays The Dude--

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:25.490
15 years ago, what I was a
little surprised about was

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:30.650
that he looked just like
The Dude and acted

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:32.720
just like The Dude.

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:35.510
And in fact, the clothes that he
wore in the movie "The Big

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:38.409
Lebowski" are his own clothes.

00:08:38.409 --> 00:08:42.260
He dresses like that
around the house.

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:48.960
And he has threatened to his
wife to dress like that when

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:51.010
he goes doing interviews,
and whatever.

00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:52.380
And she says, you can't
do it, Jeff.

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:55.540
They've been married 35 years.

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:58.200
And he listens to her.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:01.040
But anyway, I was very
impressed with the

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:01.860
lines in the movie.

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:08.240
And I told him that The Dude
in the movie acts like an

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:09.440
enlightened person.

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:15.090
For me, everybody
is enlightened.

00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:16.730
But there are depths
of enlightenment.

00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:19.330
And enlightenment is a
realization of the

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:21.050
interconnectedness of life.

00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:23.750
And as you go deeper and deeper
in that, and you find

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:26.750
that everything is
interconnected, then when

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:32.250
things come up, you may go
berserk, but not for long.

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:35.790
You bounce back quicker
and quicker as you

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:36.760
go deeper and deeper.

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:42.780
Because you just grok that
it's all one thing, man.

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:47.400
So if something is happening,
that's what's happening.

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:49.620
What are you going to
go crazy about it?

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:50.630
You're going to work with it.

00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:52.670
You're going to take those
new ingredients and do

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:53.510
the best you can.

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:56.290
And it keeps going.

00:09:56.290 --> 00:09:58.150
So he started studying
with me Zen.

00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:01.660
He'd already been meditating
on his own.

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:07.480
And we studied, been studying
now 15 years.

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:11.120
And then about a year and a half
ago, I said, you want to

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:12.960
do a book together?

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:15.560
And we went away for
four days, to a

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:18.190
house he has in Montana.

00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:19.795
And we chatted.

00:10:19.795 --> 00:10:26.210
And it was all taped, videoed,
then transcribed, then edited.

00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:30.230
Then it came out in January as
a book called "The Dude and

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:35.170
the Zen Master."

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:40.660
That's a little flashback
on it all.

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:43.100
And now I want to open
to questions.

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:50.370
Some of the things that people
who know about me want to ask,

00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:54.190
I'll just throw them out before
your questions, is

00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:58.290
about 25 years ago, before I
started getting very heavily

00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:00.990
involved in doing work for the
homeless, I went to live in

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:02.460
the streets.

00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:06.020
And I invited some people
to come with me.

00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:08.270
About 18 came on that first
street retreat.

00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:11.520
And there have been street
retreats happening ever since.

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:16.980
I started in New York.

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:19.490
And there are street retreats
happening in

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:21.550
New York every year.

00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:24.520
Generally in the Bowery
is where they start,

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:25.770
drift around a little.

00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:32.570
Now there's street retreats
happening around the world,

00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:35.200
led by different people.

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:38.600
I just did probably my
last street retreat a

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:40.046
year and a half ago.

00:11:40.046 --> 00:11:41.950
I'm getting a little old.

00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:44.050
It rained the full--

00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:45.820
that was four days.

00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:48.315
Most of retreats I've
done are seven days.

00:11:55.050 --> 00:12:00.515
18 years ago I started an annual
retreat at Auschwitz.

00:12:00.515 --> 00:12:02.630
I call it bearing witness
retreats.

00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:06.990
And that one is dealing with
the issues of diversity and

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:09.730
how we treat others.

00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:14.230
And so it's purposely structured
so that there are

00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:19.200
people from many countries, many
religions, many cultures.

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:21.870
There are survive that come,
children of survivors,

00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:23.920
grandchildren of survivors.

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:27.470
There are children and
grandchildren of SS people who

00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:29.490
ran the camps.

00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:32.225
There are Palestinians and
Israelis that come.

00:12:32.225 --> 00:12:35.020
There are Native Americans that
have come, because they

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:41.290
want to do a similar retreat
in the Black Hills.

00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:45.700
And Rwandans have come, because
we are scheduling for

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:50.360
the 20th anniversary of that
genocide, a retreat in Rwanda,

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:55.160
bringing together the Hutus and
the Tutsis and the people

00:12:55.160 --> 00:13:00.850
from the Congo and Uganda, and
people from Belgium and France

00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:04.670
that were huge factors
in all of that

00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:08.520
stuff, Germany and Poland.

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:11.280
So those are called bearing
witness retreats.

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:17.470
And I talk about all that kind
of stuff in the book.

00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:18.310
I've written other books.

00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:22.070
I've written a book called
"Bearing Witness." And this

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:27.370
model for Greyston, the model
for working with the homeless,

00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:32.070
I'm trying to replicate that in
an Arab city in Israel that

00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:37.100
would employee Israeli
Palestinians, Israeli Jews,

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:41.020
and West Bank Palestinians that
would get work permits.

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:44.050
Because a wall goes through the
city that we're planning

00:13:44.050 --> 00:13:45.210
to put that in.

00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:49.190
So it's that kind of
stuff that I do.

00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:50.440
Now, questions.

00:13:54.268 --> 00:13:56.085
AUDIENCE: When you run your
bakery, you have this process,

00:13:56.085 --> 00:14:01.130
or no process, no background
checks, no--

00:14:01.130 --> 00:14:03.423
BERNIE GLASSMAN: We call
it open hiring.

00:14:03.423 --> 00:14:07.808
AUDIENCE: Open hiring, so what
is the philosophy behind that?

00:14:07.808 --> 00:14:10.464
What it is about the checks that
happen in a lot of other

00:14:10.464 --> 00:14:12.160
jobs that you think--

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:15.080
BERNIE GLASSMAN: Well,
it's fear, I think.

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:20.130
I think people are afraid of
hiring potential violent

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:24.050
people, or no-good people.

00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:29.490
It's stereotyping, profiling,
and fear.

00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:32.460
I think all of those
factors go into it.

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:38.480
And Zen is about experiencing
things, not

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:42.930
holding on to you concepts.

00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:46.080
Have a lot of ideas, and stuff
like that, but not

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:47.140
attaching to those.

00:14:47.140 --> 00:14:51.280
Zen is a practice of trying to
let go of those attachments to

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:56.990
be able to see things as they
are, not as we think they are.

00:14:56.990 --> 00:15:02.780
That's is what went into the
idea of open hiring, that we

00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:06.070
were going to go by the
experience of how they worked,

00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:10.060
rather than what their
background stuff said they

00:15:10.060 --> 00:15:13.480
were, and what our
prototypes were.

00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:21.230
So for example, at that time,
and probably still, many

00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:25.740
people have a stereotype that
homeless people are no good,

00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:28.300
or they're inferior to others.

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:31.670
And in fact, as borne out by
if you're on the streets,

00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:35.240
you'll find that most people
seeing us, seeing a homeless

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:38.950
person, a street person, will
either across the street or

00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:39.920
avert their eyes.

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:41.190
They don't want to look.

00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:42.440
There's a lot--

00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:52.740
at my age or you forget what
you're talking about.

00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:56.940
AUDIENCE: Have you
tried replicating

00:15:56.940 --> 00:15:57.925
that in other places?

00:15:57.925 --> 00:16:00.753
Is there something special
about here that would be

00:16:00.753 --> 00:16:02.780
difficult to replicate
elsewhere?

00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:03.950
BERNIE GLASSMAN: No.

00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:07.000
As I say, I'm trying to
replicate it now in Israel.

00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:11.700
It's studied.

00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:13.980
The model is studied.

00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:15.300
It's interesting.

00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:20.670
The model is a for profit not
for profit spiritual model the

00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:25.970
spirituality of the model is
that as a Zen teacher, when I

00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:30.390
did this, I was hoping that the
people not only would get

00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:35.740
jobs, but would start
interconnecting with others,

00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:38.200
and then with the
bigger world.

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:40.590
Because that's the role of the
Zen teacher, is to help people

00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:45.140
learn about the
interconnectedness of life.

00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:53.300
The spiritual part, Greyston
as a model, as a not for

00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:56.830
profit for profit, what is
called nowadays, for the last

00:16:56.830 --> 00:17:00.890
10 years probably, social
entrepreneurship, that is

00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:03.842
being taught in many business
schools, as you know.

00:17:03.842 --> 00:17:06.530
And Greyston is a model
that is studied in

00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:07.490
many business schools.

00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:12.670
It's studying at Wharton, at
Harvard, at Yale, at Columbia,

00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:14.480
at Stanford.

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:17.140
But they don't incorporate
this spiritual

00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:18.599
component of it.

00:17:18.599 --> 00:17:20.609
Which, if you went to Greyston,
and you walked in,

00:17:20.609 --> 00:17:22.510
you would feel.

00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:26.490
You feel something different
going on.

00:17:26.490 --> 00:17:30.760
Now we don't have [INAUDIBLE]
troops, which I

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:32.367
think is a big lack.

00:17:32.367 --> 00:17:32.844
Yes?

00:17:32.844 --> 00:17:35.229
AUDIENCE: Is there any formal
meditation training offered?

00:17:35.229 --> 00:17:36.660
BERNIE GLASSMAN: No.

00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:40.480
Well, it's offered, but not--

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:45.400
there is a mentioned there is
a Zen meditation hall there.

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:50.050
And now, for example, I come
once a month to volunteer.

00:17:50.050 --> 00:17:52.060
I come down there
once a month.

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:59.780
Because we have a program, which
my wife and I started,

00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:03.170
even with Zen students before
bringing it to Greyston,

00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:04.920
called the Pathmaking Program.

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:07.510
Which, this same holistic
model, we

00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:09.410
introduce to your life.

00:18:09.410 --> 00:18:12.820
We would sit down, and talk
about what's your interest, in

00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:14.190
terms of spirituality?

00:18:14.190 --> 00:18:17.080
What's your interest, in terms
of work, in terms of study, in

00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:19.990
terms of service in the
community, in terms of

00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:21.430
relationships?

00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:25.140
And then next year, six months
later, we look how you're

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:27.770
doing along those, if you
want change a path.

00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:29.330
We call it pathmaking.

00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:34.040
And every employee has a path
that they set up for

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:38.230
themselves with a woman who's in
charge of pathmaking work.

00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:40.610
And Paco here is on the board.

00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:43.500
And he's co-chair of the
pathmaking committee.

00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:46.880
It's a big piece of what
Greyston is about.

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:49.900
That comes from the spiritual
background.

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:51.740
That's not part of the
model of that study.

00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:54.075
And yet it's a key part
of that model.

00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:08.620
Obviously there are other not
for profit for profit

00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:10.660
integrations.

00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:14.890
But I don't think there's
something quite like Greyston.

00:19:14.890 --> 00:19:17.000
And there should be, I think.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.530
Because it works.

00:19:18.530 --> 00:19:23.880
And I've got 30 years
of proof to that.

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:27.000
Theoretically, it should
be duplicated.

00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:34.524
AUDIENCE: Your limit with
homeless was seven days among

00:19:34.524 --> 00:19:35.006
other people.

00:19:35.006 --> 00:19:36.150
Do you think this draws

00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:40.150
attention to homeless awareness?

00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:42.840
BERNIE GLASSMAN: No, except
for the people

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:44.202
that went on it.

00:19:49.910 --> 00:19:52.400
For the people who've been
on the street retreat--

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:53.650
and now there are thousands--

00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:58.840
it changed forever how
they would deal

00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:01.690
with homeless people.

00:20:01.690 --> 00:20:04.230
Because, what do you think is
the biggest thing that a

00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:07.710
person feels when they go
to live on the street?

00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:10.210
I'll tell you what the things
are that they think about

00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:11.950
before they go to live
on the street.

00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:13.870
And you would probably
associate.

00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:16.140
They're concerned
about violence,

00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:18.960
abuse, maybe being raped.

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:20.525
They're concerned about
being hungry.

00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:30.375
That's probably the
biggest concerns.

00:20:30.375 --> 00:20:30.770
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:32.640
BERNIE GLASSMAN: Huh?

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:35.164
Being sick.

00:20:35.164 --> 00:20:38.580
I've never had anybody
have that concern.

00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:40.360
But that would be yours.

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:44.040
What do you think is the biggest
thing that they find

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:47.694
that has affected them when
they're finished?

00:20:47.694 --> 00:20:48.990
AUDIENCE: Shame?

00:20:48.990 --> 00:20:50.060
BERNIE GLASSMAN: Shame.

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:51.900
Loss of dignity.

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:55.310
People not looking at them.

00:20:55.310 --> 00:20:58.310
Middle class and upper class
folks are not so used to

00:20:58.310 --> 00:21:01.800
people not wanting to look
at them, ignore them.

00:21:05.250 --> 00:21:08.970
From then on, people who have
gone on the streets tend to

00:21:08.970 --> 00:21:11.970
ask a homeless person,
how are you?

00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:12.590
What's your name?

00:21:12.590 --> 00:21:15.950
And they don't make contact.

00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:19.690
It's hard not to make contact
when you've--

00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:22.160
AUDIENCE: How about begging?

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:25.120
BERNIE GLASSMAN: Well, I have a
certain rules when you come

00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:26.090
on the streets with me.

00:21:26.090 --> 00:21:30.190
And one of them is that you
can't bring any money, and

00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:32.450
that you have to beg.

00:21:32.450 --> 00:21:35.430
Now there is enough
food to get.

00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:36.540
Food is not an issue.

00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:38.530
There's plenty of food
in the streets.

00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:42.360
There's all kinds of ways
that it's being offered.

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:43.610
Bathrooms is a little harder.

00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:52.080
And resting is hard.

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:55.570
But I insist on begging, because
that's something that

00:21:55.570 --> 00:21:58.660
most people are not
to used to.

00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:02.520
And my very first street
retreat, for example, I

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:07.780
require that you raise $1,000
for every day you came with me

00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:09.940
on the streets.

00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:13.760
And that you couldn't
use your own money.

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:19.230
And you had to ask friends
and relatives or whoever.

00:22:19.230 --> 00:22:21.860
And there was one man, it was
a very wealthy man who came.

00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:25.490
And he said, Bernie, I just
want to pay the $5,000.

00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:27.730
And I said, no.

00:22:27.730 --> 00:22:28.980
You can't do that.

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:32.350
You have to ask.

00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:34.550
He says I can't ask my
friends for money to

00:22:34.550 --> 00:22:37.480
go live on the street.

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:38.870
All his friends were
wealthy friends.

00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:47.650
But that experience of raising
that money initially is the

00:22:47.650 --> 00:22:53.090
kind of experience when you go
out on the streets and beg.

00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:55.800
People think you're crazy.

00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:59.900
Or can't you work.

00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:04.970
They think very negatively
of you.

00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:12.190
Whereas in India, there could
be many holy men that that's

00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:14.155
how they live their
whole life, for

00:23:14.155 --> 00:23:16.140
instance, through begging.

00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:17.670
Begging turns out to be--

00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:21.140
that's why Paco mentioned it--
it happens to be a big factor

00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:23.960
that changes people.

00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:27.820
It also gets people to see
that they can live in any

00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:32.300
circumstances, that they're not
depends and on all of the

00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:34.120
money they think they
need to have.

00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:42.340
You can live, and be very free
in the moment, with nothing.

00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:44.970
Because you have everything.

00:23:44.970 --> 00:23:46.980
We the museums free, art.

00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:48.130
You have the parks.

00:23:48.130 --> 00:23:50.000
You have everything.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.820
It's all out there.

00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:54.070
It's all out here.

00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:58.086
Yeah?

00:23:58.086 --> 00:24:03.040
AUDIENCE: In your experience,
can you stack or rank the best

00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:04.976
ways to reach enlightenment?

00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:22.840
BERNIE GLASSMAN: I defined
enlightenment as the

00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:25.110
experience of the
interconnectedness of life.

00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:34.410
There are depths of different
degrees of enlightenment.

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:43.640
The way you can tell the degree,
the depth to which a

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:49.020
person has achieved
enlightenment is how they

00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:51.910
serve others.

00:24:51.910 --> 00:24:57.460
We're all very used to
servicing ourselves.

00:24:57.460 --> 00:24:59.490
When you're hungry,
you get food.

00:24:59.490 --> 00:25:02.980
You go to a gym to get
in better shape.

00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:06.030
You get a job to make
money, to do things.

00:25:06.030 --> 00:25:12.870
You may read books about
enlightenment, or whatever.

00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:17.310
We do a lot of things in
terms of ourselves.

00:25:17.310 --> 00:25:22.040
That means that you are
enlightened to the degree of

00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:24.720
knowing that you are
all interconnected.

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:26.470
In fact, you don't even
think about it.

00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:27.630
You act that way.

00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:31.550
When you're hungry, your hands
bring food to the mouth.

00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:33.070
If you're bleeding,
the hand takes

00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:34.750
care of what's happening.

00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:37.570
It doesn't think about whether
I should do it or not do it.

00:25:41.030 --> 00:25:46.020
Some women, when they give
birth, don't feel a separation

00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:47.942
between them and the child.

00:25:47.942 --> 00:25:51.630
The child does some colicky
thing, or something, and the

00:25:51.630 --> 00:25:53.050
mother does something
immediately.

00:25:53.050 --> 00:25:56.370
It's not a discussion of whether
to do it or not do it.

00:25:56.370 --> 00:25:57.620
Am I trained enough?

00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:06.770
They are enlightened to the
level of them and their child.

00:26:06.770 --> 00:26:10.430
And with time, they lose that.

00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:13.940
And the child becomes a separate
thing than them.

00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:16.550
But it could be the same.

00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:22.870
In my experience, the Dalai
Lama is serving the world.

00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:27.220
So his degree of enlightenment
is the depth of the world.

00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:32.130
So you already ready enlightened
to the degree of

00:26:32.130 --> 00:26:33.475
take of taking care
of yourself.

00:26:36.550 --> 00:26:39.460
From my definition, what would
be the easiest way of

00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:45.230
learning, of deepening that
experience, of taking care of

00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:47.970
others, is to serve others.

00:26:47.970 --> 00:26:50.885
It can go the other
way around.

00:26:50.885 --> 00:26:54.990
And in the world of Zen, the
majority of teaching is

00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:59.370
teaching that through meditation
you will learn.

00:26:59.370 --> 00:27:02.360
Your attachments will fall away,
and so that you will

00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:04.860
experience this
interconnectedness.

00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:11.340
I've been a pioneer in proposing
that through social

00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:16.730
action you can deepen
that experience.

00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:20.290
Which to me makes sense,
when you say it.

00:27:20.290 --> 00:27:22.030
And of course, you're
doing some good

00:27:22.030 --> 00:27:23.680
things at the same time.

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:24.560
I love to sit.

00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:25.280
I sit every day.

00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:27.800
It doesn't mean you
don't meditate.

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:31.300
But I would say that no matter
what your life is like, if you

00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:37.300
could spend some time serving
others, that will help.

00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:40.605
That would be my approach.

00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:44.738
AUDIENCE: I'm curious.

00:27:44.738 --> 00:27:49.489
You had mentioned you were an
aeronautical engineer, had a

00:27:49.489 --> 00:27:51.461
career in the math field.

00:27:51.461 --> 00:27:57.130
I'm curious about the transition
from that into a

00:27:57.130 --> 00:28:00.335
very social role.

00:28:00.335 --> 00:28:03.621
And I'm not sure I have a
specific question, just in

00:28:03.621 --> 00:28:07.863
terms of how you decided to
make that transition, what

00:28:07.863 --> 00:28:12.222
fears or obstacles you face,
what things turned out to be

00:28:12.222 --> 00:28:14.710
less problematic than
you expected?

00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:19.680
How was that transition
for you?

00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:22.370
BERNIE GLASSMAN: For me
it was no sweat, man.

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:28.830
I got interested
in Zen in 1958.

00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:32.740
I was a junior in undergraduate
school.

00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:34.950
Then I got a job.

00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:39.100
In '60 moved to California, was
in the aerospace industry.

00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:42.560
But I was hooked into
Zen at that time.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.402
was

00:28:47.402 --> 00:28:57.090
It Turns out when I was 11, 12,
I had started a whole book

00:28:57.090 --> 00:29:02.800
of arguments that I came across
for and against the

00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:07.950
existence of God, through
literature, through science.

00:29:07.950 --> 00:29:10.400
I was brought up in a socialist
family, not a

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:11.530
religious family.

00:29:11.530 --> 00:29:17.680
But somehow I had that kind
of spiritual bent.

00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:22.720
When I went to work, I was
already sitting and working.

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:28.550
And then I left there for two
years of work to go to Israel,

00:29:28.550 --> 00:29:30.650
to explore.

00:29:30.650 --> 00:29:32.850
I'd read about a spiritual
kibbutz there,

00:29:32.850 --> 00:29:35.080
and I wanted to explore.

00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:36.610
I didn't find what I wanted.

00:29:36.610 --> 00:29:38.870
Israel was too macho for me.

00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:41.130
And I came back.

00:29:41.130 --> 00:29:42.730
I met my wife there.

00:29:42.730 --> 00:29:46.340
And a little after we came
back and married, she got

00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:55.152
involved in war resistance
league, helping people stay

00:29:55.152 --> 00:29:57.120
out of the Vietnam War.

00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:59.010
Our house was--

00:29:59.010 --> 00:30:01.400
I was working in the
aerospace industry.

00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:03.080
And part of the company
I was working

00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:06.750
for was making missiles.

00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:19.400
And we were working keeping
folks out of the draft.

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:21.930
And working with people that
were part of that movement,

00:30:21.930 --> 00:30:27.150
that wanted to go into the
courts to fight the system.

00:30:27.150 --> 00:30:31.690
That organization started by
a guy named David Harris.

00:30:31.690 --> 00:30:35.620
He and Joan Baez got married.

00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:38.936
This may be all old timers.

00:30:38.936 --> 00:30:40.186
AUDIENCE: Having trouble
following the--

00:30:43.390 --> 00:30:44.600
BERNIE GLASSMAN: But
at any rate, I had

00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:46.260
dual lives going in.

00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:54.280
And at McDonnell Douglas, I they
knew I was in Zen, and a

00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:55.090
Zen teacher.

00:30:55.090 --> 00:31:01.360
And it was OK for me to take
a week off every month, two

00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:06.270
hours every day, come in one
hour later and leave one hour

00:31:06.270 --> 00:31:13.160
earlier to take off a week every
month to do a retreat.

00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:17.420
And then they actually appointed
me as the creativity

00:31:17.420 --> 00:31:20.580
guru, corporate-wide because
of my Zen background.

00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:22.420
I had these mutual paths.

00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:25.466
And it was never a problem.

00:31:25.466 --> 00:31:27.290
It was cool with everybody.

00:31:27.290 --> 00:31:28.540
It was cool with me.

00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:33.120
I didn't have difficulties.

00:31:39.250 --> 00:31:41.725
AUDIENCE: Are you still
interested in technology and

00:31:41.725 --> 00:31:43.050
engineering, and stuff
like that?

00:31:43.050 --> 00:31:46.950
Or is one path really
dominated now?

00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:48.200
BERNIE GLASSMAN: No.

00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:54.290
I'm still interested.

00:31:54.290 --> 00:32:00.170
It's not as heavy, and
not in everything.

00:32:00.170 --> 00:32:04.310
I'm interested in new
developments in

00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:06.580
the computer world.

00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:12.290
I'm interested in chaos stuff.

00:32:12.290 --> 00:32:14.920
My math wasn't, actually.

00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:18.050
I was before the chaos.

00:32:18.050 --> 00:32:21.480
But that interested me.

00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:23.910
I follow up on some
of that, kind of.

00:32:23.910 --> 00:32:27.570
I had a student who was one of
the discoverers, or one of the

00:32:27.570 --> 00:32:30.820
original thinkers on
string theory.

00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:38.260
And he died, early age,
of diabetes, somehow.

00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:41.595
This was when I was back in LA,
when I didn't really know.

00:32:41.595 --> 00:32:45.270
All I knew is it was a
new kind of thing.

00:32:45.270 --> 00:32:47.770
I don't know if any of you
know Fritz Kopper?

00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:54.630
Well, this fellow, Joel
and Fritz were very--

00:32:54.630 --> 00:32:56.355
Frans Kopper.

00:32:56.355 --> 00:32:57.605
Or it was it Fritz?

00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:03.620
They worked together at
the Bern in Geneva.

00:33:07.090 --> 00:33:08.445
Kopper wrote a book.

00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:17.270
And Joel had him send it
to me for comments.

00:33:17.270 --> 00:33:19.700
So this is way, way back.

00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:23.390
And then we did a workshop
together on Dogen and being

00:33:23.390 --> 00:33:28.050
time, and his new physics.

00:33:28.050 --> 00:33:34.885
That kind of stuff I have
a general interest.

00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:39.010
I do not--

00:33:39.010 --> 00:33:40.400
I will have to admit--

00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:42.510
I do not read Buddhist books.

00:33:46.410 --> 00:33:51.210
They seem to be repeating the
same stuff over and over.

00:33:51.210 --> 00:33:52.265
I like new stuff.

00:33:52.265 --> 00:33:54.560
AUDIENCE: So at one
point you did?

00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:56.930
BERNIE GLASSMAN: I read a
lot of Buddhist stuff.

00:33:56.930 --> 00:34:00.150
And then at some point
I stopped.

00:34:00.150 --> 00:34:01.520
It felt like I was repetition.

00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:03.380
AUDIENCE: What do you read?

00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:05.295
BERNIE GLASSMAN: Detective
stories, I love detective

00:34:05.295 --> 00:34:08.840
stories, especially Norwegian
and Sweden.

00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:11.230
They have some great
writers there.

00:34:18.146 --> 00:34:20.122
AUDIENCE: What drew you to Zen,
as opposed to any of the

00:34:20.122 --> 00:34:22.830
other schools?

00:34:22.830 --> 00:34:24.634
BERNIE GLASSMAN: I read
about it in 1958.

00:34:24.634 --> 00:34:27.199
It was the first time
I heard about it.

00:34:27.199 --> 00:34:32.159
And it felt like home.

00:34:32.159 --> 00:34:36.120
What I read about was talking
about the interconnectedness

00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:38.889
of life, and the wonders
of life.

00:34:38.889 --> 00:34:45.260
And most of my experience with
religions and other things was

00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:48.690
really folks separating
themselves, and talking about

00:34:48.690 --> 00:34:50.080
how one's better
than the other.

00:34:54.040 --> 00:35:04.590
There was a certain interest in
exploring mystical things.

00:35:04.590 --> 00:35:07.200
And being Jewish, I
looked into the

00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:08.450
Hasidic ways, Kabbalah.

00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:14.720
But the discrimination between
men and women was

00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:15.565
too huge for me.

00:35:15.565 --> 00:35:17.960
I couldn't get into that.

00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:22.030
And Buddhism had this appeal,
to me, of we're all

00:35:22.030 --> 00:35:23.640
interconnected in this world.

00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:27.060
A little different, but it's
the kind of thing I'd been

00:35:27.060 --> 00:35:27.530
talking about.

00:35:27.530 --> 00:35:29.990
That was a very appealing
to me.

00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:32.794
And I want to experience that.

00:35:32.794 --> 00:35:37.120
Because I didn't feel Common
in most of the

00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:39.340
religions of groups.

00:35:39.340 --> 00:35:42.460
And then later, on I got very
involved in interfaith work.

00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:45.440
And I read about that
kind of thinking in

00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:47.280
almost every religion.

00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:49.110
I've been to Catholic
monasteries.

00:35:49.110 --> 00:35:53.720
I've studied the [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:55.995
I've taken hand as a Sufi.

00:35:55.995 --> 00:35:59.780
I've certainly had
Jewish training.

00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:02.650
And I am a little unusual.

00:36:02.650 --> 00:36:04.510
I have 40 dharma successors.

00:36:04.510 --> 00:36:08.340
That is, there's 40 people that
I have empowered to be

00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:10.820
Zen teachers.

00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:14.200
Some of them are Catholic
priests.

00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:16.990
Some of them are
Catholic nuns.

00:36:16.990 --> 00:36:19.870
Some of them are Sufi sheikhs.

00:36:19.870 --> 00:36:23.060
Some of them are rabbis.

00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:24.590
It's a wide range.

00:36:24.590 --> 00:36:29.620
It's more like an interfaith
Zen then

00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:31.530
strictly a Buddhist Zen.

00:36:31.530 --> 00:36:34.090
Because they still work
in those professions.

00:36:34.090 --> 00:36:36.840
And in fact, one
of the rabbis--

00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:39.670
I don't know how many here are
Jewish-- you know Yom Kippur?

00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:42.660
That's the holiest
day in Judaism.

00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:45.480
It's a day of fasting.

00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:47.050
He's Israeli.

00:36:47.050 --> 00:36:51.050
His family is six generations
Israeli.

00:36:51.050 --> 00:36:54.700
He leads a street retreat on Yom
Kippur in the poorest part

00:36:54.700 --> 00:37:01.194
of Tel Aviv, a very dangerous
part of Tel Aviv

00:37:01.194 --> 00:37:03.270
AUDIENCE: So you say that
there's this interfaith

00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:04.540
dialogue in all religion.

00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:08.610
Where do you think
that gets lost?

00:37:08.610 --> 00:37:11.796
You said that when you studied
other religions, you didn't

00:37:11.796 --> 00:37:13.574
see that divide.

00:37:13.574 --> 00:37:16.574
But then you also said that you
see an interfaith dialogue

00:37:16.574 --> 00:37:17.446
at the core of a lot
of religions.

00:37:17.446 --> 00:37:19.870
So where do you think
that fits?

00:37:19.870 --> 00:37:22.920
BERNIE GLASSMAN: Well, in
Buddhism, it's the main.

00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:24.160
It's the main thrust.

00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:27.880
The word Buddha means
awakened one.

00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:29.450
And awaken to what?

00:37:29.450 --> 00:37:31.910
Awakened to the
interconnectedness of life.

00:37:31.910 --> 00:37:34.550
And we call that experience
enlightenment.

00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:36.970
All of Buddhism is about that.

00:37:36.970 --> 00:37:39.440
And there are many schools
of Buddhism.

00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:43.480
And there are different schools
trying to answer your

00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:48.300
question, what's the best way of
getting that enlightenment

00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:50.840
experience and deepening it?

00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:52.720
There's many different ways--

00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:57.200
visualizations, meditations,
chanting.

00:37:57.200 --> 00:37:59.060
I push social engagement.

00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:02.640
In the Hindu world, karma
yoga is a common thing.

00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:06.870
Karma yoga is that
kind of spiritual

00:38:06.870 --> 00:38:08.450
life, serving others.

00:38:08.450 --> 00:38:10.220
We don't have that
in Buddhism.

00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:13.920
We don't have a school that's
equivalent to karma yoga.

00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:16.710
Now there are some in Japan.

00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:18.020
But not yet in this country.

00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:22.720
And in this country, I'm
probably the one that's--

00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:24.840
my family is called
Zen peacemakers.

00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:27.760
And there are about
140 Zen peacemaker

00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:29.340
groups around the world.

00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:33.260
And theoretically they're
supposed to be interested in

00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:38.670
also helping others.

00:38:38.670 --> 00:38:42.490
But the mainstream of
Buddhism was this

00:38:42.490 --> 00:38:44.570
interconnectedness of life.

00:38:44.570 --> 00:38:49.420
And the other traditions have
felt like those were

00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:53.300
marginalized aspects,
one would say

00:38:53.300 --> 00:38:55.170
the mystical aspects.

00:38:55.170 --> 00:39:00.000
But the mainstream folks in
those religions probably never

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:08.840
heard of it, even though we
might look at them as some--

00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:11.910
for example, in Islam, Rumi--

00:39:11.910 --> 00:39:13.220
most people have
heard of Rumi.

00:39:13.220 --> 00:39:14.470
And Rumi talks that way.

00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:20.195
But yet it's not quite
made mainstream.

00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:37.820
AUDIENCE: So bringing it back
to homelessness, can you

00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:41.690
elaborate on the connection
between Zen and homelessness?

00:39:41.690 --> 00:39:45.050
Can the homeless
learn from Zen?

00:39:45.050 --> 00:39:46.490
Can they become Zen?

00:39:46.490 --> 00:39:48.890
What's your ultimate
focus there?

00:39:48.890 --> 00:39:52.770
Have you learned anything about
the homeless beyond you

00:39:52.770 --> 00:39:55.591
shared already that most
people don't really

00:39:55.591 --> 00:39:57.840
understand?

00:39:57.840 --> 00:40:02.620
BERNIE GLASSMAN: Well, one of
the fascinating things to me

00:40:02.620 --> 00:40:07.380
is that once a year, when I
was there during the early

00:40:07.380 --> 00:40:12.380
days, once a month we had a date
called mandala day, in

00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:14.850
which we brought everybody
together.

00:40:14.850 --> 00:40:16.750
Which meant we had to
close the childcare.

00:40:16.750 --> 00:40:20.780
We had to close all the things
we were doing, for that day.

00:40:20.780 --> 00:40:22.260
And we would bring everybody
together.

00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:27.540
And we had different exercises
about interconnecting each

00:40:27.540 --> 00:40:30.060
other, different things.

00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:33.930
Now, once a year, there's
something called mandala day.

00:40:33.930 --> 00:40:37.850
And the 170 or 180 people
come together.

00:40:37.850 --> 00:40:40.700
And they have to shut
the child care.

00:40:40.700 --> 00:40:43.190
That's a big deal.

00:40:43.190 --> 00:40:44.440
Shut the bakery.

00:40:47.210 --> 00:40:53.270
The bakery is making about $10
million a year now, employing

00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:57.160
about 80 people.

00:40:57.160 --> 00:41:01.340
It does the chocolate fudge
brownies for Ben and Jerry's

00:41:01.340 --> 00:41:04.530
Chocolate Fudge Brownie
Ice Cream and Yogurt.

00:41:04.530 --> 00:41:06.430
That's its biggest customer.

00:41:06.430 --> 00:41:08.950
AUDIENCE: If we buy Ben and
Jerry's Chocolate Fudge ice

00:41:08.950 --> 00:41:10.590
cream, we're supporting--

00:41:10.590 --> 00:41:10.885
BERNIE GLASSMAN: Exactly.

00:41:10.885 --> 00:41:12.820
And it says so on the carton.

00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:17.460
Well, on the carton
it says why they--

00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:18.920
Ben and Jerry-- hooked up.

00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:20.900
And I'm close with
Ben and Jerry.

00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:23.540
So we made that union
a long time ago.

00:41:23.540 --> 00:41:26.900
But they do say why they hooked
up with Greyston, and

00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:28.150
what's going on.

00:41:35.325 --> 00:41:38.650
So once a year there's
this mandala day.

00:41:38.650 --> 00:41:45.180
And one year at the mandala day,
the folks made a mural, a

00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:47.070
large mural.

00:41:47.070 --> 00:41:53.160
And on that mural, the scenes
are interconnectedness with

00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:57.680
each other, serving
the community.

00:41:57.680 --> 00:41:59.540
It blew me away.

00:41:59.540 --> 00:42:03.810
If you told me that any Zen
group in the country was to

00:42:03.810 --> 00:42:07.220
draw a mural like that,
I would be surprised.

00:42:07.220 --> 00:42:09.760
That would be wonderful.

00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:13.450
So here's folks that come from
either the homeless ranks or

00:42:13.450 --> 00:42:15.440
the unemployed ranks,
or the drug.

00:42:18.050 --> 00:42:21.390
And that's what they
came up with.

00:42:21.390 --> 00:42:27.290
And they came up with three
important themes for Greyston.

00:42:27.290 --> 00:42:28.430
They came up with it.

00:42:28.430 --> 00:42:31.530
In the Zen Peacemakers we
have three tenets--

00:42:31.530 --> 00:42:34.380
approaching something without
attachment to your ideas,

00:42:34.380 --> 00:42:38.220
being totally open and
deep listening.

00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:41.180
And second, bearing witness,
trying to remove the

00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:45.070
dichotomy, the dualist way of
thinking between you and the

00:42:45.070 --> 00:42:46.210
environment.

00:42:46.210 --> 00:42:50.260
And third, out of that, let
loving actions arise.

00:42:50.260 --> 00:42:54.920
So my opinion is that loving
actions will arise.

00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:57.780
They came up with
three things.

00:42:57.780 --> 00:43:03.060
The first being, listen
to others.

00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:07.240
The second is, essentially,
bearing witness.

00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:13.400
Feel how the others
are acting.

00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:14.815
And the third is serve
the community.

00:43:18.910 --> 00:43:24.760
I think, for me, the connection
more than clear.

00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:28.270
They wouldn't call it
Buddhist or Zen.

00:43:28.270 --> 00:43:32.630
But that's something that
they would not have said

00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:35.410
20, 30 years ago.

00:43:35.410 --> 00:43:43.050
Most of them are not
there 20, 30 years.

00:43:43.050 --> 00:43:46.880
It's sort of common.

00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:48.880
I knew Jonas Salk.

00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:56.420
And he says, Zen will work
because it's like any cell.

00:43:56.420 --> 00:43:58.790
It's biology.

00:43:58.790 --> 00:44:03.130
You put a healthy cell into
a sick situation.

00:44:03.130 --> 00:44:07.154
If the cell is really healthy,
it will replicate.

00:44:07.154 --> 00:44:12.640
And the system will
become healthy.

00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:18.010
For me, what's happened at
Greyston is a proof of that.

00:44:18.010 --> 00:44:23.540
Not so easy to insert healthy
cells in different places.

00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:26.540
But it's possible.

00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:28.780
Everything's possible.

00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:33.788
AUDIENCE: What do you think is
the largest impediment to our

00:44:33.788 --> 00:44:36.910
society being more Zen-like
and understanding Zen.

00:44:36.910 --> 00:44:38.160
BERNIE GLASSMAN: Being human.

00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:44.780
I work in so many parts
of this world.

00:44:51.510 --> 00:44:55.170
I think it's, in some way,
always been the same.

00:44:55.170 --> 00:44:56.480
People ask me, is it
getting better?

00:44:56.480 --> 00:44:57.850
Is it getting worse?

00:44:57.850 --> 00:45:04.690
And I think, in some sense,
it's useless question.

00:45:04.690 --> 00:45:06.250
It's what am I going
to do now?

00:45:06.250 --> 00:45:07.850
What am I going to do?

00:45:07.850 --> 00:45:10.420
Not whether the system's getting
better or worse.

00:45:10.420 --> 00:45:12.110
What am I going to do?

00:45:12.110 --> 00:45:16.400
That's the only thing I
can get hooked into.

00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:19.650
I don't know if it's getting
better or worse.

00:45:19.650 --> 00:45:21.600
We worked for so long
in the Middle East.

00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:25.750
If you want to work in
frustrating places, that can

00:45:25.750 --> 00:45:28.390
be very frustrating.

00:45:28.390 --> 00:45:31.330
Part of me would say, I
can't do that anymore.

00:45:31.330 --> 00:45:32.970
And then the other part would
say, what are you doing

00:45:32.970 --> 00:45:34.500
quitting, man.

00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:35.750
Just do your best.

00:45:39.110 --> 00:45:42.560
The issue is not to have
any expectations.

00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:46.725
If you have any expectations,
you'll have frustrations.

00:45:49.910 --> 00:45:50.610
You set goals.

00:45:50.610 --> 00:45:51.900
And you work for them.

00:45:51.900 --> 00:45:54.020
But don't expect anything
to come of them.

00:45:54.020 --> 00:45:55.120
You just do all the work.

00:45:55.120 --> 00:45:56.020
You just work with them.

00:45:56.020 --> 00:45:59.540
AUDIENCE: But isn't part
of setting goals having

00:45:59.540 --> 00:46:00.240
expectations?

00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:02.580
BERNIE GLASSMAN:
No, not to me.

00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:03.470
You could define it that way.

00:46:03.470 --> 00:46:05.740
So you've got to define
the words.

00:46:05.740 --> 00:46:11.140
For me, when I started working
in Yonkers, I said my goal was

00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:12.330
I want to end homelessness.

00:46:12.330 --> 00:46:14.180
I didn't think I was going
to end homelessness.

00:46:14.180 --> 00:46:18.080
But that gave me a direction
to steer to.

00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:19.840
This is what I want to
work to do, man.

00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:22.540
And I'll do my best I can.

00:46:22.540 --> 00:46:28.110
And if I don't eliminate
homelessness,

00:46:28.110 --> 00:46:29.880
I won't fall apart.

00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:33.780
If I had an expectation, then
I would probably feel, I

00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:34.750
screwed up.

00:46:34.750 --> 00:46:39.300
I didn't do what I had
expected to do.

00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:42.900
In the meantime,
you did a lot.

00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:48.500
I look at those goals as
points to navigate to.

00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:54.450
But the important thing is the
road you're on, and what

00:46:54.450 --> 00:46:58.390
you're doing on that, how you're
walking that road.

00:46:58.390 --> 00:47:01.290
There's where I'm going.

00:47:01.290 --> 00:47:02.200
And maybe I'll make it.

00:47:02.200 --> 00:47:03.470
Maybe I won't.

00:47:03.470 --> 00:47:04.870
And maybe the point
will change.

00:47:04.870 --> 00:47:09.160
By the time I get here or here,
I'll think differently.

00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:10.800
That's the other thing.

00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:14.470
A Buddhist opinion is that
everything has changed.

00:47:14.470 --> 00:47:19.290
Nothing stays the same, even
one's idea of the goal.

00:47:19.290 --> 00:47:22.086
That won't change.

00:47:22.086 --> 00:47:24.512
AUDIENCE: Did you speak with the
Coen brothers about your

00:47:24.512 --> 00:47:26.967
perspective, and to
Jeff Bridges?

00:47:26.967 --> 00:47:28.690
Did they have any of the
same beliefs going

00:47:28.690 --> 00:47:30.900
into the script writing?

00:47:30.900 --> 00:47:33.000
BERNIE GLASSMAN: I actually
did speak with the Coen

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:38.200
brothers way before we were
going to do the book.

00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:42.390
And one of them said that
he knew about Zen.

00:47:42.390 --> 00:47:46.320
But he had no Zen influence
on the script.

00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:48.790
And the other one said he knew
nothing about Zen, and wasn't

00:47:48.790 --> 00:47:52.830
interested in knowing
anything about it.

00:47:52.830 --> 00:47:58.400
But before we did the book, Jeff
Bridges actually called

00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:01.880
them to get an OK from them.

00:48:01.880 --> 00:48:06.350
He said Bernie and I are
going to do this book.

00:48:06.350 --> 00:48:10.810
And his language is, I don't
want to piss on your carpet.

00:48:10.810 --> 00:48:14.910
So how do you feel about that?

00:48:14.910 --> 00:48:16.280
And they said, go for it, man.

00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:19.440
It sounds great.

00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:23.100
But they do they had
no Buddhist--

00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:25.732
AUDIENCE: You had no involvement
in the movie?

00:48:25.732 --> 00:48:27.600
Your involvement came later.

00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:32.500
BERNIE GLASSMAN: A year after I
saw the movie is when I met

00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:34.590
Jeff, because we moved
to Santa Barbara,

00:48:34.590 --> 00:48:36.170
where he was living.

00:48:36.170 --> 00:48:39.770
And we met, and not because
of the movie.

00:48:39.770 --> 00:48:41.110
We met for other reasons.

00:48:41.110 --> 00:48:44.810
His wife is very involved
in homeless work.

00:48:44.810 --> 00:48:50.280
And he was a high school buddy
of a woman I know pretty well

00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:52.430
whose name is Bonnie Raitt.

00:48:52.430 --> 00:48:56.645
And she suggested
I meet with him.

00:49:01.030 --> 00:49:03.870
AUDIENCE: One of the things you
said repeatedly about how

00:49:03.870 --> 00:49:08.960
Zen is about losing this
separation between yourself

00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:12.582
and the rest of the world--
or life you said.

00:49:12.582 --> 00:49:15.340
When you say life, do
you mean everything?

00:49:15.340 --> 00:49:16.090
BERNIE GLASSMAN: Everything.

00:49:16.090 --> 00:49:16.405
AUDIENCE: --a special?

00:49:16.405 --> 00:49:17.655
BERNIE GLASSMAN:
No, everything.

00:49:20.830 --> 00:49:22.600
AUDIENCE: It reminds me of
something I've heard of a

00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:25.200
number of times.

00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:26.960
BERNIE GLASSMAN: Let me
backtrack for one second.

00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:30.660
It's not between losing the
sense of yourself and

00:49:30.660 --> 00:49:31.910
everything.

00:49:34.100 --> 00:49:38.230
What you gain is the experience
of yourself as

00:49:38.230 --> 00:49:39.480
everything.

00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:48.320
Because if it's all
interconnected, it's all one.

00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:53.036
You can't be talking about the
self and something outside.

00:49:53.036 --> 00:49:54.070
You know set theory.

00:49:54.070 --> 00:49:55.320
You draw a circle.

00:49:57.560 --> 00:49:59.840
You can't have an outside
to the circle if the

00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:01.705
circle is the self.

00:50:01.705 --> 00:50:05.980
AUDIENCE: Do you follow anything
in neuroscience and

00:50:05.980 --> 00:50:07.230
psychology?

00:50:09.850 --> 00:50:12.990
Because I've heard a similar
concept come up a number of

00:50:12.990 --> 00:50:16.080
times when people talk about
the brain development.

00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:18.390
And it's one of these
concepts.

00:50:18.390 --> 00:50:20.800
Below a certain age, you
don't have the concept.

00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:24.145
BERNIE GLASSMAN: Jung talks
about the collective

00:50:24.145 --> 00:50:26.580
unconsciousness.

00:50:26.580 --> 00:50:30.090
That's the same thing,
in a sense.

00:50:35.310 --> 00:50:38.280
There's Dalai Lama has assembled
a group that's

00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:40.270
working, the mind-life group.

00:50:40.270 --> 00:50:44.170
There's a lot of work going on,
nowadays, which is saying

00:50:44.170 --> 00:50:47.020
the same thing in scientific
language.

00:50:47.020 --> 00:50:49.800
AUDIENCE: What I've seen is
they've done experiments with

00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:53.010
children, to try and understand
at what age and

00:50:53.010 --> 00:50:58.040
what brain structures actually
change when children develop

00:50:58.040 --> 00:50:58.650
this concept.

00:50:58.650 --> 00:51:02.026
Below a certain age, they don't
have a concept of the

00:51:02.026 --> 00:51:04.499
self versus the rest
of the world.

00:51:04.499 --> 00:51:07.277
And is it something that
has to develop

00:51:07.277 --> 00:51:08.670
as the brain develops?

00:51:08.670 --> 00:51:10.680
BERNIE GLASSMAN: I
haven't kept up.

00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:11.690
I haven't read.

00:51:11.690 --> 00:51:15.080
There's a lot of research
going on.

00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:20.520
But it seems to me--

00:51:20.520 --> 00:51:23.330
the other thing that I've
learned through life is that

00:51:23.330 --> 00:51:25.030
everything I say
is my opinion.

00:51:25.030 --> 00:51:26.750
And people are saying
other things.

00:51:26.750 --> 00:51:28.560
That's their opinion.

00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:29.620
It's your opinion, man.

00:51:29.620 --> 00:51:30.700
It's my opinion, man.

00:51:30.700 --> 00:51:31.380
And we can share--

00:51:31.380 --> 00:51:34.130
AUDIENCE: Is there no
objective reality?

00:51:34.130 --> 00:51:35.380
BERNIE GLASSMAN: In my
opinion, there's

00:51:35.380 --> 00:51:37.510
no objective reality.

00:51:37.510 --> 00:51:38.700
In my opinion.

00:51:38.700 --> 00:51:41.240
In my opinion, they're all
opinions that we can share.

00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:43.000
And it's great, man.

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:46.380
We can share opinions, and
discuss them, and whatever.

00:51:46.380 --> 00:51:49.980
And once we come up with the
notion of objective realities,

00:51:49.980 --> 00:51:50.950
then we go to war.

00:51:50.950 --> 00:51:53.050
And we get angry.

00:51:53.050 --> 00:51:56.240
All that stuff can exist, if
we accept that it's all

00:51:56.240 --> 00:52:00.990
different opinions,
in my opinion.

00:52:00.990 --> 00:52:06.110
In my opinion, the brain is an
instrument, just like the

00:52:06.110 --> 00:52:07.570
eyes, nose.

00:52:07.570 --> 00:52:09.140
They're just instruments.

00:52:09.140 --> 00:52:11.800
And the brain function,
the functioning of

00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:13.790
the brain, is thinking.

00:52:13.790 --> 00:52:16.010
And it thinks in a
dualistic way.

00:52:16.010 --> 00:52:16.830
That's just the way it is.

00:52:16.830 --> 00:52:17.880
It's just an instrument, man.

00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:19.530
It's not all of us.

00:52:19.530 --> 00:52:23.000
There are other ways of
experiencing life.

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:26.460
So when we experience life
using our brain, we're

00:52:26.460 --> 00:52:27.680
generally--

00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:28.970
like I see the sun--

00:52:28.970 --> 00:52:32.090
the brain is saying,
that's the sun.

00:52:32.090 --> 00:52:33.520
It gave it a label.

00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:35.970
And then it would say,
that's a beautiful.

00:52:35.970 --> 00:52:39.300
It's not as good as the sun.

00:52:39.300 --> 00:52:41.830
It's not experiencing
it directly.

00:52:41.830 --> 00:52:44.030
It's bringing up concepts.

00:52:44.030 --> 00:52:46.710
That's the way it function.

00:52:46.710 --> 00:52:50.960
Zen is about having an
experience that's not negating

00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:56.160
the brain, but not through the
brain, a direct experience.

00:52:56.160 --> 00:53:00.450
Can you imagine experiencing the
sun every day anew for the

00:53:00.450 --> 00:53:02.290
first time?

00:53:02.290 --> 00:53:05.870
And then later making
commentary.

00:53:05.870 --> 00:53:12.290
AUDIENCE: The other thing
that sounds--

00:53:12.290 --> 00:53:14.980
I'm making connections between
what you're saying and what

00:53:14.980 --> 00:53:16.230
I've heard.

00:53:20.050 --> 00:53:26.500
At the same time as what I said,
the brain developing and

00:53:26.500 --> 00:53:29.470
constructing this idea of the
boundaries between me and not

00:53:29.470 --> 00:53:35.710
me, they're finding more and
more that this concept that

00:53:35.710 --> 00:53:39.820
there's a singular stream of
consciousness is actually the

00:53:39.820 --> 00:53:49.130
construct of how a brain
constructs them in experience

00:53:49.130 --> 00:53:50.050
of the world.

00:53:50.050 --> 00:53:59.820
In fact, your brain, you can
have multiple thoughts

00:53:59.820 --> 00:54:02.400
independently, and only
afterwards try

00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:03.650
to intervene them.

00:54:05.508 --> 00:54:09.745
I'm wondering if you see
everything as connected--

00:54:16.780 --> 00:54:21.680
if everything is interrelated,
then you don't need this--

00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:22.646
I'm sorry.

00:54:22.646 --> 00:54:26.510
I'm not sure how it relates.

00:54:26.510 --> 00:54:27.760
BERNIE GLASSMAN: Don't
need what?

00:54:31.410 --> 00:54:33.490
AUDIENCE: If there isn't
a singular stream of

00:54:33.490 --> 00:54:39.990
consciousness that's you, then
you're just part of the world.

00:54:39.990 --> 00:54:43.010
BERNIE GLASSMAN: The cosmic
consciousness.

00:54:43.010 --> 00:54:44.260
You're part of that.

00:54:52.220 --> 00:54:56.260
I'll give you my opinion
on all that.

00:54:56.260 --> 00:54:57.170
Obviously--

00:54:57.170 --> 00:54:57.850
not obviously.

00:54:57.850 --> 00:55:02.100
In my opinion, the brain is
constantly coming up with

00:55:02.100 --> 00:55:05.380
different thoughts, and
different ideas, and whatever.

00:55:05.380 --> 00:55:07.930
Those, to me, are opinions.

00:55:07.930 --> 00:55:08.910
That's one thing.

00:55:08.910 --> 00:55:11.400
It's not going to stop.

00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:14.790
A metaphor for the
interconnectedness of life in

00:55:14.790 --> 00:55:19.880
Buddhism is in one of these
sutras is called Indra's net.

00:55:19.880 --> 00:55:23.830
And it's a net that extends
throughout all space and time.

00:55:23.830 --> 00:55:25.390
It's a pretty big net.

00:55:25.390 --> 00:55:31.692
And at each node on the net,
there's a bright pearl.

00:55:31.692 --> 00:55:36.960
That bright pearl represents a
particular instance of time,

00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:38.560
time and space.

00:55:38.560 --> 00:55:42.860
So I'm a bright pearl.

00:55:42.860 --> 00:55:45.740
The next instant, I'm another
bright pearl.

00:55:45.740 --> 00:55:49.110
It's all these bright pearls.

00:55:49.110 --> 00:55:54.720
Everything, the thought of a
unicorn, that thought is a

00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:57.410
bright pearl.

00:55:57.410 --> 00:56:00.580
Every bright pearl is reflected
in every other

00:56:00.580 --> 00:56:02.770
bright pearl.

00:56:02.770 --> 00:56:04.750
And every other bright pearl
is reflected in this

00:56:04.750 --> 00:56:06.340
background.

00:56:06.340 --> 00:56:10.690
And if you shake the net
anywhere, the vibrations are

00:56:10.690 --> 00:56:12.330
felt throughout the
whole thing.

00:56:12.330 --> 00:56:16.250
So that's our metaphor for your

00:56:16.250 --> 00:56:17.500
interconnectedness of life.

00:56:20.140 --> 00:56:22.240
That metaphor came
up a long time.

00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:26.030
Years later, somebody stole the
word indra-net, converted

00:56:26.030 --> 00:56:28.080
it a little, and called
it internet.

00:56:30.610 --> 00:56:33.370
And instead of a pearl at every

00:56:33.370 --> 00:56:35.480
node, they put computers.

00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:39.930
They put all kinds of things.

00:56:39.930 --> 00:56:41.000
That's my feeling.

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:47.040
The energy of that
interconnectedness now is

00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:48.670
being labelled and felt.

00:56:48.670 --> 00:56:52.585
And I think Arab Spring
is the energy of that.

00:56:52.585 --> 00:56:56.140
That arose without--

00:56:56.140 --> 00:56:59.860
if you ask how did it arise,
people say, it rose because of

00:56:59.860 --> 00:57:02.670
Facebook, whatever.

00:57:02.670 --> 00:57:07.840
But I say that kind of energy
will keep arising in different

00:57:07.840 --> 00:57:09.540
things, and spreading.

00:57:09.540 --> 00:57:12.450
So Arab Spring spread to be
called different things in

00:57:12.450 --> 00:57:14.930
different parts of the world.

00:57:14.930 --> 00:57:19.200
And, of course, the internet
is a huge manifestation of

00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:20.450
that kind of energy.

00:57:22.730 --> 00:57:23.380
[INAUDIBLE]

00:57:23.380 --> 00:57:24.600
interconnectedness.

00:57:24.600 --> 00:57:29.010
And you guys are working on the
fact that there's so much

00:57:29.010 --> 00:57:29.810
interconnected.

00:57:29.810 --> 00:57:34.990
You can go from here to there,
all over the place.

00:57:34.990 --> 00:57:38.830
At least that's my opinion.

00:57:38.830 --> 00:57:45.850
AUDIENCE: So if you had
access to all that

00:57:45.850 --> 00:57:46.160
interconnectedness--

00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:48.380
BERNIE GLASSMAN: We all
have access to it.

00:57:48.380 --> 00:57:50.780
AUDIENCE: At your disposal,
let's say.

00:57:50.780 --> 00:57:53.420
What would be the most effective
thing you'd do to

00:57:53.420 --> 00:57:56.540
increase the sense in which
people feel interconnected?

00:57:56.540 --> 00:57:57.440
BERNIE GLASSMAN: Well
that's my job.

00:57:57.440 --> 00:57:57.848
AUDIENCE: If you could
do anything

00:57:57.848 --> 00:57:58.750
you want to the internet--

00:57:58.750 --> 00:58:00.360
BERNIE GLASSMAN:
That's my job.

00:58:03.010 --> 00:58:09.310
My job and the vow I made in
my job was to help people

00:58:09.310 --> 00:58:12.460
experience the
interconnectedness of life.

00:58:12.460 --> 00:58:16.050
So I'm constantly thinking
of how to do that.

00:58:20.350 --> 00:58:23.395
There was a time when I was
doing that only in the venue

00:58:23.395 --> 00:58:24.960
of a meditation hall.

00:58:27.550 --> 00:58:29.200
That's where I worked.

00:58:29.200 --> 00:58:33.890
And I decided that the venue
you should be the world.

00:58:33.890 --> 00:58:36.660
So then I had to say,
what does it mean?

00:58:36.660 --> 00:58:39.370
How do we work in businesses,
and social

00:58:39.370 --> 00:58:41.910
engagement, and sports?

00:58:41.910 --> 00:58:43.160
And that's a constant thing.

00:58:45.680 --> 00:58:50.666
That's my profession, is to try
to experiment with that.

00:58:50.666 --> 00:58:56.040
AUDIENCE: What have you found to
be the most effective ways

00:58:56.040 --> 00:59:01.040
of getting people to feel just
a little more interconnected?

00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:03.490
To get people started towards
feeling interconnected?

00:59:03.490 --> 00:59:06.440
What's really worked
well for you?

00:59:06.440 --> 00:59:08.990
BERNIE GLASSMAN: For me,
these bearing witness

00:59:08.990 --> 00:59:12.130
retreats have been huge.

00:59:12.130 --> 00:59:16.460
That's a huge effect on people,
when they come to

00:59:16.460 --> 00:59:20.150
those bearing witness
retreats.

00:59:20.150 --> 00:59:24.495
If you want to get a taste, come
to some of those bearing

00:59:24.495 --> 00:59:25.790
witness retreats.

00:59:25.790 --> 00:59:27.920
They're all on our websites,
zenpeacemakers.org.

00:59:35.380 --> 00:59:37.260
But in some way that's
a little passive.

00:59:37.260 --> 00:59:38.240
But that's the teaching.

00:59:38.240 --> 00:59:41.470
If somebody says they want to
study what I'm doing, I say

00:59:41.470 --> 00:59:45.250
come to a bearing witness
retreat, and you'll feel it.

00:59:45.250 --> 00:59:49.780
And then to get deeper,
I say get involved

00:59:49.780 --> 00:59:53.440
serving your community.

00:59:53.440 --> 00:59:56.130
I also would encourage
meditation.

00:59:56.130 --> 00:59:58.600
As I say, I meditate
every day.

00:59:58.600 --> 01:00:02.500
But I also know a lot of people
that meditate every day

01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:06.220
that I don't think are
doing more than

01:00:06.220 --> 01:00:08.470
meditating every day.

01:00:08.470 --> 01:00:10.460
They get relaxed.

01:00:10.460 --> 01:00:12.915
They feel better.

01:00:12.915 --> 01:00:15.370
I don't know if it's about
just feeling better.

01:00:19.390 --> 01:00:23.660
OK, I think I was supposed
to end at 2:00.

01:00:23.660 --> 01:00:24.420
Was that true?

01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:25.830
Or it was no set?
