00:00:20.912 --> 00:00:23.980
PROFESSOR: OK, OK, OK.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.220
Let's settle down.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.770
Weekend is over.

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.160
Tomorrow, weekly quiz.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.080
Today I'll have office
hours 3:00 to 4:00.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.180
I have to go down to Washington,
so I've got to

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.850
leave a little bit earlier
than normal.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:42.420
So I will be available
from 3:00 to 4:00

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.070
The lecture has started and
there's still way too much

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.650
talking in here.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:47.430
Way too much.

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.950
You know how much is too much?

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.040
Any.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.290
Any.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.890
So last day, we started talking
about oxide glasses,

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.700
and we reasoned that we could
have control of the properties

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.420
by control of the composition.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.900
We started with a network
former, which is some oxide

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.505
that has the capacity for
forming covalent bonds through

00:01:16.505 --> 00:01:18.160
a bridging oxygen.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.080
And then we wanted to drop the
processing temperature, and we

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.460
did so by adding modifiers.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.600
Intermediates, we haven't talked
about and we're going

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.570
to do that in just a moment.

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.980
So if you look in the readings,
this is from

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.850
archival notes that were written
by my predecessor,

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:37.210
Professor Witt, these
are compositions of

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:38.870
some typical glasses.

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.280
I don't expect you know these
from memory, but I would

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.370
expect you, if I gave you the
composition, explain to me why

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:46.920
the various constituents
are there.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.060
So let's try few examples.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.210
The first one is soda-lime
glass.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.740
And you see it contains
silica, which

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.150
is the network former.

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.270
It contains sodium oxide,
calcium oxide,

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:59.710
and magnesium oxide.

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.180
And these are alkaline earth
oxides that are ionic, and so

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.270
these are acting as network
modifiers because they're

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.240
donating oxide anions
that go in and break

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.670
the silicate chains.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.630
And then there's this Al203 and
that's sort of halfway in

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:16.490
between, isn't it?

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.610
Silica is Group 4, or
14, if you want to

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.500
use the modern notation.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.130
Sodium is Group 1.

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.670
Calcium, magnesium, Group 2.

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.160
Alumina is Group 3, and it's
sort of halfway in between.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.030
It's amphoteric.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.680
It can either be a former
or a modifier.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.140
And in these instances,
depending on how much modifier

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.150
is present, alumina can act
as an intermediate.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.340
And what's an intermediate do?

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.030
An intermediate is
a covalent oxide.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.680
It's a covalent oxide, or an
oxide that can act as both

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.090
covalent and ionic.

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.040
But in this instance, it's
acting covalent oxide with a

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.880
different coordination number.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.620
And what does that mean?

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.670
Different coordination number?

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:03.440
It coordinates--

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.070
remember last day I
showed you B2O3?

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:07.330
Borate glasses?

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.790
So they have a coordination
of three, whereas

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.170
silicates have four.

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:12.610
And what that means
is that there's

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:13.720
going to be a mismatch.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.640
There's still strong covalent
bonds, but they don't fit

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:17.510
quite right.

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.190
And that's going to give
even more free volume.

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.190
And that excess free volume,
through covalent bonds, gives

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.950
you the ability to endure
thermal shock.

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.210
So if you want to impart thermal
shock resistance in a

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:33.290
glass, you give it lots of free
volume so it can take the

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:34.700
rapid change in temperature.

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:40.810
So it's a covalent oxide with
different coordination number.

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:47.350
That is, nearest neighbors, in a
covalent sense, from that of

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:51.740
the network former.

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:55.340
So you can add a borate or
aluminate, what have you.

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.090
And that'll give you thermal
shock resistance.

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.420
And so alumina here is acting
as an intermediate.

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:02.220
Let's go down here.

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.960
There's borosilicate.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.650
borosilicate is the generic
term for Pyrex.

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.430
So Pyrex is a trade name.

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.500
Pyrex was invented by Corning,
and it contains silica as the

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:14.620
network former.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.600
There's some sodium oxide,
potassium oxide--

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.270
in rather small amounts.

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:21.560
You can see this isn't a heavily
modified network, but

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:22.710
look at this.

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.950
13% B2O3 and 2% alumina.

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.220
That's the modifier.

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.120
And what was the hallmark
of Pyrex?

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.120
It had thermal shock
resistance.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.410
So you could take it out of the
oven and put it under cold

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:36.760
water and it didn't shatter.

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.770
And we have the same analogous
behavior for glass ware in the

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:41.520
laboratory.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.420
For all room temperature and
low temperature work in the

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:48.630
laboratory, we use Pyrex that
has this resistance to

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.450
chemicals and resistance
to heat.

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:51.770
This is the big one, here.

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.140
And that gave birth to
functional crockery in the

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:01.250
kitchen, where you could work in
glass instead of in metal.

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:04.570
And down here we see glass--

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:05.510
let's see, well, here's one.

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:06.900
Light flint optical.

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.220
See, that's 54%.

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:11.150
It's down to 54% silica.

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:14.160
And look at this-- boatloads
of lead oxide.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.080
And the lead oxide is acting as
a modifier and also changes

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.850
the index of refraction.

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:25.070
It modifies so much that we
have almost down to the

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:26.500
orthosilicate.

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:30.390
So that the chains are modified
to the point where

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:32.770
they're almost all terminals.

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:36.250
There's very little of this,
and most of it is just

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:37.710
terminal oxygens.

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.960
And that means that it's more
nearly crystalline, and

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:41.990
therefore, you can cut it.

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:45.760
And this is the lead crystal.

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.000
Lead crystal has that
high value.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.460
So you can see how
that comes out.

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.880
And this is also taken
from the reading.

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.140
It's a plot of viscosity
versus temperature.

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:56.580
Only it's a logarithmic plot.

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:57.650
And what do you see?

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:58.730
Here's pure silica.

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:00.050
That's SiO2.

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:03.560
And if I want to take it down
to the point where, if the

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.330
viscosity goes down, you
have the ability to

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:06.800
work with the glass.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.330
So if I want to melt silica,
I've got to way, way up here.

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.360
Over 2,000 Centigrade.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.890
So if I want to make bottles, if
I want to make cookware, I

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:17.990
don't want to run a lehr
at this temperature.

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.900
Lehr.

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:19.950
L E H R.

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:21.380
It's where you melt glass.

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:24.040
Lehr.

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.190
I don't want to run a lehr
at this temperature.

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:30.230
But you can see if I add
modifier, the more modifier

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:34.190
that I add, the more I
break the network.

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:37.190
So increasing modifier
decreases network

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:40.040
connectivity, and that means I
can go to a lower temperature

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.690
and get the same level
of fluidity.

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:44.250
So there's a whole bunch of
definitions here that I'm not

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:45.430
going to go over.

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:46.470
You'll have this slide.

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:50.430
But basically, it's just
different points in

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:51.610
processing.

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:53.140
So if you go up here.

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:54.260
Strain and annealing.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.060
I mean, these are very, very--

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:58.980
you're especially working with
solid, whereas softening

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:01.950
point, you start getting
the glass to flow.

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:05.390
And the working point, that's
the viscosity that

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:07.350
you have to get below.

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:10.060
Otherwise, the glass is going
to be to resistant to flow.

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:12.740
You want to get the glass tacky
so that you can put it

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:16.390
into an injection mold, shape
it, as they do with bottles.

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:18.870
They take a blob of glass and
boom, they just throw it into

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:20.870
a mold and it sprays out.

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:23.010
And if you've got the right mass
and the right spinning,

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:26.350
it makes the wall thickness
proper.

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:28.690
But you can imagine, if the
glass is really, really

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:31.470
viscous, it's not going
to flow well enough.

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:34.120
If it's too fluid, it'll
drip all over.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.650
So there's an optimum
in there.

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:37.440
And this is telling you
how to figure out what

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:38.750
that optimum is.

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:42.080
And you can see that as you
change the composition, here's

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:43.200
the working value.

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:47.290
This is the viscosity that you
have to get below which in

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:48.160
order to work.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.550
And you can see that as you add
more and more modifier,

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:53.460
you can take the temperature
and get it way, way down.

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:56.330
So to work with silica you have
to be about around 2,000.

00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:58.850
With soda-lime you can
be down around 800.

00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:01.530
So that's going to cut your
energy costs, isn't it?

00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:04.980
And it's going to make
it easier to recycle.

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:08.360
What's the point of recycling if
you consume as much energy

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:10.545
to recycle as if you started
with virgin material?

00:08:10.545 --> 00:08:13.570
At least with virgin material
you can guarantee the quality

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:14.525
of the feeds stock.

00:08:14.525 --> 00:08:17.590
So there's got to be
some big saving.

00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:18.440
All right.

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:22.890
So that gives you a some sense
as to what we can do

00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:24.335
technologically with glasses.

00:08:24.335 --> 00:08:28.340
I want to show you one last
thing with glasses, and then

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:30.610
we're going to move on
to another topic.

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:33.170
You know, new week, new
day, new topic.

00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:35.160
So I want to go back
to this curve.

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:36.180
So what am I showing you here?

00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:40.210
I'm showing you that as we
change the cooling rate, we

00:08:40.210 --> 00:08:43.060
change the amount of quenched-in
excess volume.

00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:47.700
So fast cooling quenches in more
of the liquid free volume

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:48.950
than slow cooling does.

00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:52.520
That's why this V excess is
small here, whereas V excess

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:54.030
is large here for
the other one.

00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:57.000
I'm going to use that in
glass strengthening.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.250
So I want to strengthen.

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:03.500
Strengthening glasses.

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:06.170
We're talking about silicates
or borates.

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:08.210
Strengthening oxide glasses.

00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:10.030
Glass is a fantastic material.

00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:12.400
It's really good in compression,
but it's no good

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:13.400
in tensions.

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:14.490
You know this.

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:16.740
If you try to bend glass,
it'll break.

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:17.330
Why?

00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:19.170
Not because it doesn't
have dislocations.

00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:21.350
It's got strong covalent
bonds.

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:24.300
But you know, suppose you want
to strengthen the windshield

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:26.200
of your car so that
when a stone hits

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:27.350
it, it doesn't shatter.

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:30.280
What can we do to give
it added strength?

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:34.220
So I'm going to show you two
ways, and both of them operate

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:39.000
under this principle that
the yield stress--

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.320
this is the stress that will
break the glass, and I'm going

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:43.390
to say the effective yield
stress, what you

00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:45.320
experience in life--

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:51.510
is equal to the sum of what I'm
going to call the natural

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:54.660
yield stress, which is the basic
property of the glass.

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:59.000
Plus, I'm going to increase
the surface stress.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.540
What I'm going to do is I'm
going to modify the surface,

00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:04.840
and I'm going to put an
additive stress at the

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:08.950
surface, and that's going to
be a compressive stress.

00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:12.920
So that means now the effective
stress that I need

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:15.390
to break the glass is going
to be greater than it

00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:16.590
otherwise would be.

00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:21.350
So the whole gambit here is
surface strengthening.

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:25.232
Service strengthening, which
means surface modification.

00:10:25.232 --> 00:10:28.250
And I'm going to show you two
ways to modify the surface to

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:30.310
bring the strength
of the glass up.

00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:32.910
The first way is thermal.

00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:35.080
Thermal treatment.

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:38.320
And the thermal treatment is
to strengthen the glass.

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:38.830
Well, let's see.

00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:42.050
Let's keep it in the context
of the windshield.

00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:43.580
The technical term
for this, the

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:46.070
technological term is tempering.

00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:49.140
So what I'm going to show you
was how we can look at that

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:54.080
volume versus temperature curve
and understand how we

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:57.070
make tempered glass for
windshields and so.

00:10:57.070 --> 00:10:59.400
So I'm going to show you
a slab of glass.

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:00.900
Here's a slab of glass.

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:05.160
And we just got below the
softening point-- so T just

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:08.080
less than T softening.

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:11.020
So now this thing's going to
start, it's continuing to

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:13.900
become more and more viscous and
getting closer and closer

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:15.580
to glass transition
temperature.

00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:20.920
And what we're going to do is
we're going to introduce air

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:25.430
jets at the surface
of the glass.

00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:27.750
What that's going to do
is it's going to cause

00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:29.910
accelerated cooling
at the surface.

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:32.090
And the same thing happens on
both surfaces, so I'm going to

00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:34.260
cut this piece of glass in half,
and we're just going to

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:35.125
look at the upper surface.

00:11:35.125 --> 00:11:36.800
The same thing happens
in a lower surface.

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:39.220
So let's now blow this up.

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:41.630
I'm just going to look at the
upper-half surface and I'm

00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:42.930
going to divide it
into two zones.

00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:48.430
This is the first level,
most primitive

00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:51.020
finite element analysis.

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:54.150
Finite element analysis.

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:56.300
I'm going to divide it in two,
and I'm going to say, this has

00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:57.750
got two zones.

00:11:57.750 --> 00:12:00.260
Two cooling zones.

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:03.490
Here is the zone of
the center, OK?

00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:04.880
This is the center.

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:09.170
And I'm going to call this
the inner portion.

00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:10.430
And then there's the
outer portion.

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:13.090
Well, take a look at
this curve here.

00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:15.340
Which is going to have
slower cooling?

00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:17.895
In the center or near
the free surface?

00:12:17.895 --> 00:12:21.030
The slower cooling is in the
center and according to this

00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:25.800
graph, the slow cooling has
a smaller residual volume.

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:28.230
I've written, V-interior.

00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:29.890
That's the green line.

00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:32.610
And then the upper one
is a yellow line.

00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:35.130
So the upper one where it's high
cooling, it's going to

00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:36.210
have a higher volume.

00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:38.085
So this is the second piece
of finite element.

00:12:38.085 --> 00:12:41.030
So I'm going to model
this one like so.

00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:43.390
So this is outer.

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:45.450
And the same thing happens
on the other side, OK?

00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:47.340
So it's happening on
the bottom as well.

00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:49.250
But we're just looking
at the top because

00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:50.730
there's symmetry here.

00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:52.970
So you see what I've done?

00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:57.720
This is longer because that
graph says it wants to be

00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:59.500
occupying a larger volume.

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:02.160
Problem is the glass
can't do this.

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:04.970
I can do this with a piece of
chalk, but the glass isn't

00:13:04.970 --> 00:13:06.030
going to look like that.

00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:08.250
The glass is going to
have a flat edge.

00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:10.600
And how can it have
a flat edge?

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:13.880
Because the bottom, here-- this
is not to scale, let's

00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:15.090
make it more to scale--

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:18.505
the top is a narrow zone and
the bottom is a big, thick

00:13:18.505 --> 00:13:19.680
zone, isn't it?

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:23.545
So this big, thick zone, which
has a small volume, is going

00:13:23.545 --> 00:13:27.510
to pull on the thin upper
zone, which has a large

00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:29.160
volume, and pull it in.

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:30.010
Can you see that?

00:13:30.010 --> 00:13:32.110
And it's going to cause
the introduction

00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:35.530
of compressive stresses.

00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:39.520
So we got to compressive
stresses simply using that

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:43.650
graph and a little bit of air.

00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:46.520
So you take that graph, put
differential cooling, and now

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:48.290
you've introduced compressive
stress.

00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:50.570
And that's all tempered
glass is.

00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:57.040
So the V-excess of the outer
layer is greater than V-excess

00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:01.810
of the inner layer, or the
interior, if you like.

00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:02.420
And why?

00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:06.070
Because the cooling rate, the
change of temperature with

00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:13.400
time of the outer zone, is
greater than the cooling rate

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:18.000
of the inner or interior.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.950
And there it is.

00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:20.890
That's the beginning.

00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:25.140
And so now to fracture you have
to apply a greater stress

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:27.270
then you would have otherwise.

00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:29.980
So that's good, and that
saves a lot of lives.

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:31.260
There's another way.

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.920
There's another way to surface
strengthen, and that's a

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:35.170
chemical treatment.

00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:39.030
And again, what am
I trying to do?

00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:40.950
I'm trying to introduce a
compressive stress, but I'm

00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:44.590
going to use a chemical means.

00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:49.050
And this one is called
ion exchange.

00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:51.840
And this is used in
technology, too.

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:55.280
So now I'm going to take
a piece of glass here.

00:14:55.280 --> 00:15:01.550
This is solid glass and let's
put some components in here.

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:05.720
So I'm going to put some silica
as my network former.

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:08.550
I'm going to put some
sodium oxide.

00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:12.120
And I'm going to put some
modifier, B2O3.

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:13.510
So I got all three here.

00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:16.560
Former, modifier,
intermediate.

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:19.800
And just to put a little skin
on the bones here, I want to

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:23.050
show what the sodium oxide
actually looks like.

00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:29.700
Sodium oxide goes in as sodium
cations, and oxide anions.

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:31.510
The oxide anions go in
and they break some

00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:32.850
of the silica chains.

00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:34.870
But the sodiums don't get
involved in that.

00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:37.560
They just sit around
as spectators.

00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:39.270
Now what I'm going to do is
I'm going to put this, I'm

00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:45.600
going to soak this
in molten salt.

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:46.900
Soak in molten salt.

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:50.190
This is huge area of
my own research.

00:15:50.190 --> 00:15:54.550
And the molten salt, one example
might be I'm going to

00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:56.030
take potassium chloride.

00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:58.610
Remember, we talked about making
aluminum or magnesium?

00:15:58.610 --> 00:16:00.235
This is one of the constituents
of the melt in

00:16:00.235 --> 00:16:02.340
which we make electrolytic
magnesium.

00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:03.480
Potassium chloride.

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:08.560
And it exists as potassium
cations and chloride anions.

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:14.120
Chlorine is green,
except we know--

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:15.900
you know, this is the way
chemistry books write it, but

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:19.020
that's stupid because this is
isoelectronic with argon.

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:20.200
And it's not green.

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:20.510
I know.

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:21.530
I've looked at this stuff.

00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:23.540
It's clear, colorless,
and transparent.

00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:26.490
The chloride ion has to be
clear and colorless.

00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:28.780
It's got a complete shell,
but the chemistry books

00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:29.460
will make it green.

00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:32.900
Anyway, here's the potassium
ion here.

00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:34.640
And there's a lot of
potassium ion here.

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:37.440
There's no potassium ion
inside the glass.

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:39.970
There's sodium ion in the glass,
there's no sodium ion

00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:41.385
in the molten salt.

00:16:41.385 --> 00:16:45.970
But these are both media
in which ions live.

00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:48.790
So can you see this is sort of
like the perfume bottle?

00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:50.680
Things move from high
concentration to low

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:51.760
concentration.

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:55.380
Some sodium wants to leave
and enter the melt.

00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:58.770
And some potassium wants
to leave the melt

00:16:58.770 --> 00:17:00.865
and enter the glass.

00:17:00.865 --> 00:17:02.840
And where's the potassium
going to go?

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:05.310
It has to go where there
used to be sodium.

00:17:05.310 --> 00:17:07.440
What's the relative size
of potassium ion

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:08.840
versus sodium ion?

00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:10.590
Potassium ion is bigger.

00:17:10.590 --> 00:17:14.330
So potassium ion goes and
occupies a site formerly

00:17:14.330 --> 00:17:19.500
occupied by sodium and causes
compressive stress, because

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:22.990
you get all these big ions
jamming in there and that's

00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:27.400
going to lead to compressive
stress through ion exchange.

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:30.190
So through ion exchange we
can raised the temp.

00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:34.240
Since r, the radius of potassium
is greater than the

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:39.030
radius of the sodium, we get a
force fit, and this is how we

00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:42.360
got solution hardening.

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:47.250
Hardening is the metallurgical
term for raising the strength.

00:17:47.250 --> 00:17:50.730
Hardening is equal to
strength going up.

00:17:50.730 --> 00:17:53.250
So we get hardening
by solution.

00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:55.720
So this is solution hardening.

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:59.350
Solution hardening because the
potassium ion is in there.

00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:00.730
So we have surface.

00:18:00.730 --> 00:18:02.210
And this gives a lot
of strength.

00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:05.400
We do the same thing
metallurgically if you

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:07.950
carburize the surface
of a piece of steel.

00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:10.740
Tool steels, for example,
surface carburized.

00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:13.630
So we get hard surfaces
that can cut.

00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:15.630
You say, well, why don't you
just put the carbon in all the

00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:16.170
way through?

00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:18.220
Well, then the tool bit
will be brittle.

00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:21.060
So you want something that's got
toughness in the center so

00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:23.460
it can take the impact,
but it's got surface

00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:25.110
hardness so it'll cut.

00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:26.380
And that's an engineered
material.

00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:29.330
We've got one set of properties
at the surface, and

00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:31.440
we've got another set of
properties in the bulk.

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:36.240
And it's all brought to you
by control of chemistry.

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:38.990
And then that's also control
of chemistry.

00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:39.880
OK.

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:42.820
So I mean, I could talk more
and more and more.

00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:45.030
Glasses are just fascinating
things.

00:18:45.030 --> 00:18:47.090
But we've got to get moving.

00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:49.540
So we're going to move
to a new topic.

00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:51.630
We're going to move to
a new topic today.

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:54.280
We're going to start talking
about kinetics.

00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:55.530
Kinetics.

00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:58.280
And what is kinetics?

00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:02.790
Kinetics is the topic that we
put into 3.091, because it's

00:19:02.790 --> 00:19:06.140
important, of course, but it's
all about the study of

00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:08.240
reaction rates.

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:14.235
It's the study of reaction
rates and mechanism.

00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:23.210
So why do we study?

00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:27.250
Well, we study it because
I think it belongs here.

00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:30.820
But first of all, kinetics is
related to productivity and

00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:31.510
resource utilization.

00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:32.920
You've got two factories.

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:37.060
One produces 200 units per time,
the other produces 100

00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:37.860
units per time.

00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:40.410
The one that's producing 100
units per time probably isn't

00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:43.300
going to be in business
that much longer.

00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:46.450
And it's all about understanding
how to get more

00:19:46.450 --> 00:19:50.000
throughput per unit time, and
that leads to competitiveness.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.010
So if you're interested in
international competitiveness,

00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:54.640
you've got to know something
about kinetics.

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:56.290
The two go hand in glove.

00:19:56.290 --> 00:19:57.760
Second thing is energy
and the environment.

00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:01.290
A number of you have come to
talk to me after class, sent

00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:03.120
emails because you're interested
in energy and the

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:03.940
environment.

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:07.740
Efficient use of energy involves
understanding the

00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:11.160
kinetics so you can force
chemical change with the least

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:15.320
amount of energy utilization and
do so in a way because its

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:16.340
mechanism--

00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:18.830
if there's two mechanisms that
allow you to get to the same

00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:21.770
end product, choose the one
that has the least toxic

00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:23.550
impact on the environment.

00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:27.010
Otherwise, you're going to have
to spend money to avoid

00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:30.110
the effluents, which then gets
you back up to number one.

00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:33.260
Your cost of doing business is
higher than the other guy.

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:34.090
Guess what?

00:20:34.090 --> 00:20:35.980
You're creamed in
the marketplace.

00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:37.290
And lastly, societal.

00:20:37.290 --> 00:20:42.680
And this is one that excites
me, is kinetics leads to

00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:45.440
productivity, which keeps
factories open, which keeps

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:46.800
people working.

00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:48.640
So through understanding
kinetics.

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:51.900
You go and you look at places
in the United States where

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:53.300
factories have closed.

00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:58.506
In many, many instances it was
because the technology lagged.

00:20:58.506 --> 00:21:01.330
If you could just keep
things going faster.

00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:02.835
You've got to make things-- you
know how fast you've got

00:21:02.835 --> 00:21:03.740
to make them go?

00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:05.970
You've got to make them go so
fast that even if the foreign

00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:08.560
workers are paid zero, you can
still beat them in the

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:09.490
marketplace.

00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:11.190
That's your standard.

00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:12.840
So that's how you design
your processes.

00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:16.910
You design your processes so
that you can produce at very,

00:21:16.910 --> 00:21:19.080
very low cost.

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:21.810
And there's a huge range
in reaction rates.

00:21:21.810 --> 00:21:25.980
You know, you can start
the range of

00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:28.120
rates, rates of reaction.

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:31.570
At the one that you have
very, very slow.

00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:35.450
And way over here you have very,
very fast, all right?

00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:36.970
So on the slow end, you
have stuff that's

00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:39.740
sort of cosmic scale.

00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:40.990
Geological.

00:21:43.050 --> 00:21:44.320
And then over here,
what do we have?

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:45.570
We have explosions.

00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:50.190
You might say, well, explosions
are usually bad,

00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:50.540
aren't they?

00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:51.360
Well, no.

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:53.680
I can give you an example of
where explosion is used to

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:55.750
your advantage.

00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:57.230
The airbag in the automobile.

00:21:57.230 --> 00:22:00.570
There is no pump, no mechanical
pump fast enough to

00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:03.320
inflate an airbag on demand.

00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:05.190
So how do we make those
airbags work?

00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:08.370
And I hope none of us ever
has to be present at the

00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:09.760
deployment of those airbags.

00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:12.460
But you know, just academically
let's talk about

00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:13.470
how they work.

00:22:13.470 --> 00:22:19.550
There's like an explosion that
occurs when you're driving.

00:22:19.550 --> 00:22:22.325
There's an accelerometer and
this is a key piece.

00:22:22.325 --> 00:22:24.690
The accelerometer has to make
a decision whether you're

00:22:24.690 --> 00:22:27.050
applying the brakes just because
you've lost focus and

00:22:27.050 --> 00:22:28.390
you're, you know, whoops!

00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:29.650
You've had that jerky brake.

00:22:29.650 --> 00:22:33.090
Or maybe this is one of those
holy-mackerel moments, and

00:22:33.090 --> 00:22:34.420
your jamming on the
brakes, and we'd

00:22:34.420 --> 00:22:35.840
better deploy the airbags.

00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:40.390
Once the accelerometer decides
that this is one of those holy

00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:43.410
you-know-what moments, it sends
an electric current

00:22:43.410 --> 00:22:46.990
through a wire, which then
raises the temperature to 300

00:22:46.990 --> 00:22:50.150
degrees C and causes this
reaction to take place.

00:22:50.150 --> 00:22:52.970
When this reaction takes
place, this is a solid,

00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:54.450
nitrogen is a gas.

00:22:54.450 --> 00:22:57.910
So the gas has a much, much
higher volume than the solid

00:22:57.910 --> 00:23:00.400
and within milliseconds
you get inflation.

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:03.320
Well, that's good and that
inflates the bag and prevents

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:06.580
you from hitting the hard
parts of the car.

00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:07.870
But you see the other
byproduct?

00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:08.780
That's sodium.

00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:11.150
And if you look on your Periodic
Table, elemental

00:23:11.150 --> 00:23:15.110
sodium is liquid above
98 degrees Celsius.

00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:16.580
So now you've got
liquid sodium.

00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:19.430
There's no point preserving the
safety of the occupants of

00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:21.810
the car just to cover them
with liquid sodium.

00:23:21.810 --> 00:23:23.270
So we better do something
about that.

00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:26.410
So being chemists, what we do
is we add potassium nitrate

00:23:26.410 --> 00:23:28.060
inside the bag, as well.

00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:28.300
so.

00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:31.290
That that sodium is mopped up
with potassium nitrate, which

00:23:31.290 --> 00:23:35.070
converts it to sodium oxide,
potassium oxide, and a little

00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:35.593
more nitrogen.

00:23:35.593 --> 00:23:36.300
[BLOWING SOUND EFFECT]

00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:39.660
Keep the bag nice and firm.

00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:44.026
But now what happens when the
Fires show up and they

00:23:44.026 --> 00:23:44.760
[SOUND EFFECT],

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:46.670
you know, they start pouring
water on it.

00:23:46.670 --> 00:23:48.440
This turns into caustic.

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:52.072
So now you're going to get
covered and wet lye.

00:23:52.072 --> 00:23:55.140
So that's probably not
too good, either.

00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:58.540
Just remember, you've been
physically saved from smashing

00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:01.470
your skull on the tempered
windshield.

00:24:01.470 --> 00:24:04.680
So it's so far, so good.

00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:07.350
So now what?

00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:10.200
You want a mechanical, you
want a Newtonian death?

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:15.260
Or do you want a Coulombic
death?

00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:17.210
I guess that's the
question, here.

00:24:17.210 --> 00:24:19.500
And so we're going to keep doing
some chemistry here and

00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:20.820
we're going to add silica.

00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:23.290
And what happens if we add
silica to sodium oxide

00:24:23.290 --> 00:24:24.190
potassium oxide?

00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:26.870
Well that's a network former,
these are network modifiers.

00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:29.370
We'll make an alkaline silicate
glass and that's OK

00:24:29.370 --> 00:24:31.330
because we put food
and beverages in

00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:33.040
alkaline silicate glasses.

00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:34.240
So everybody is happy.

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:36.595
So that's all the chemistry that
goes on inside an airbag.

00:24:36.595 --> 00:24:39.740
And we've got to understand
the kinetics.

00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:42.400
So I hope I've whet
your appetite.

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:43.350
OK, that's enough of that.

00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:45.430
Now let's get to
the real stuff.

00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:49.010
So let's write a general
chemical reaction.

00:24:49.010 --> 00:24:50.090
The general reaction.

00:24:50.090 --> 00:24:53.740
What's the formalism if we want
to set up the metrics?

00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:57.540
So I'm going to write just
a plain, old equation.

00:24:57.540 --> 00:25:01.210
This is the classical
P-Chem stuff.

00:25:01.210 --> 00:25:04.920
Little a moles of A, plus little
b moles of B go to

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:07.680
little c moles of C plus
little d moles of D.

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:09.590
So this could have
been lecture two.

00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:11.520
Just a straight chemical
reaction.

00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:13.400
Remember we were studying
stoichiometry?

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:16.885
So the constituents of the left
side of the equation are

00:25:16.885 --> 00:25:19.480
called the reactants, whereas
on the right side of the

00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:22.790
equation we have the products.

00:25:22.790 --> 00:25:28.190
And what kinetics gives us,
kinetics tells us the rate of

00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:29.440
conversion.

00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:32.730
Or the rate of reaction.

00:25:32.730 --> 00:25:35.100
I'm using all these terms
so you understand their

00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:36.860
equivalent.

00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:45.320
So we can write something like
this where the conservation of

00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:46.130
mass kicks in.

00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:48.230
So I can't make products
any faster

00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:49.920
than I consume reactants.

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:51.750
There's no sources
or sinks here.

00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:53.640
When I lose reactants,
I make products.

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:57.850
So I'm going to say, the rate of
change of the total mass of

00:25:57.850 --> 00:25:59.710
the reactants-- this
is summation sign--

00:25:59.710 --> 00:26:03.510
I'm just saying the rate of
change of the sum of all of

00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:06.530
the reactions must equal
the rate of change.

00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:10.470
So the loss rate of reactants
must equal the gain rate of

00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:12.680
all of the products.

00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:15.130
That's just simple
stoichiometry.

00:26:15.130 --> 00:26:17.900
Or some people call this
conservation of mass or Law of

00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:19.680
Mass Action, what have you.

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:23.030
And then we count by
concentration, usually.

00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:26.900
Just reminder.

00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:28.270
This is lowercase c.

00:26:28.270 --> 00:26:31.430
So this is the concentration
of species i

00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:33.110
goes as the mole number.

00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:37.290
n is mole number divided by
the volume of the reactor.

00:26:37.290 --> 00:26:42.330
So this would be in moles
per meter cubed if

00:26:42.330 --> 00:26:43.770
we were in SI units.

00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:48.090
So therefore the rate of change,
the ci by dt, is

00:26:48.090 --> 00:26:51.760
really the rate of change of
mole number, isn't it?

00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:54.820
It's moles of i disappearing,
but the volume

00:26:54.820 --> 00:26:56.900
doesn't change, typically.

00:26:56.900 --> 00:27:00.980
And then the last thing is we
can use this idea up here that

00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:04.980
concentration of products can
only equal the loss rate of

00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:06.140
the reactant.

00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:11.890
So I can write, term by term,
the normalized rate loss of

00:27:11.890 --> 00:27:15.500
the concentration of a divided
by its stoichiometric

00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:18.780
coefficient, for example, would
equal the normalized

00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:23.210
weight gain, or pardon me, the
concentration gain of the

00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:24.990
concentration of d.

00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:28.750
So this is just saying a
disappears no faster than d

00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:32.490
appears, mediated by the
stoichiometric coefficients.

00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:39.550
So this is just Law of Mass
Action, which is stoichiometry

00:27:39.550 --> 00:27:41.290
in motion, isn't it?

00:27:41.290 --> 00:27:43.930
That's all it is.

00:27:43.930 --> 00:27:48.890
Now here comes the cool
thing kinetic theory.

00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:51.670
We look at any reaction, I can
tell you right now what it

00:27:51.670 --> 00:27:52.330
looks like.

00:27:52.330 --> 00:27:56.200
If I applied concentration of
i as a function of time, I

00:27:56.200 --> 00:28:00.410
start off with some value c
naught, some initial value,

00:28:00.410 --> 00:28:03.310
and it just attenuates.

00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:07.020
We know that's going to happen
as we consume the-- it falls

00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:08.490
and there's some
curvature here.

00:28:08.490 --> 00:28:11.990
What we're trying to do next is
to give some mathematical

00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:13.780
representation to this.

00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:17.050
Can we come up with a
mathematical formulation of

00:28:17.050 --> 00:28:18.490
the shape of that curve?

00:28:18.490 --> 00:28:21.660
And we can, and here's
the central

00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:25.540
tenet kinetic of theory.

00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:36.640
Kinetic theory says that the
reaction rate can be expressed

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:38.187
in terms of a driving force.

00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:48.670
And that driving force is the
instant concentration.

00:28:51.170 --> 00:28:51.420
OK.

00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:52.230
These are lofty words.

00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:54.745
I'll show you what it means
with illustration.

00:28:57.970 --> 00:29:00.570
So that's the overall idea.

00:29:00.570 --> 00:29:06.250
So now let's say that the rate
of change, the instant rate of

00:29:06.250 --> 00:29:14.190
change of concentration ci, is
proportional to the instant

00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:16.410
value of the concentration.

00:29:16.410 --> 00:29:17.230
And you know, the concentration

00:29:17.230 --> 00:29:18.830
is changing, right?

00:29:18.830 --> 00:29:20.470
As the concentration
decreases, the

00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:21.670
rate of change decreases.

00:29:21.670 --> 00:29:25.655
So just this alone, this idea
alone would rationalize a

00:29:25.655 --> 00:29:27.460
curve like that.

00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:29.940
As the concentration falls,
the rate of change falls,

00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:32.430
which means the concentration
falls, which means--

00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:35.640
and raised to some power--

00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:37.120
it's not linear, necessarily--

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:40.770
raised to some power.

00:29:40.770 --> 00:29:43.250
There's a power law
at work here.

00:29:43.250 --> 00:29:45.300
So now let's do this
one more time.

00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:46.530
I'm going to write it
mathematically.

00:29:46.530 --> 00:29:48.780
But I want you to first see
the word, concepts.

00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:50.170
So let's write it
mathematically.

00:29:50.170 --> 00:29:53.590
That means minus dci by dt--

00:29:53.590 --> 00:29:57.260
so this is time rate a change of
concentration i, the minus

00:29:57.260 --> 00:29:59.160
means it's falling--

00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:05.160
is equal to the concentration
of i raised to some power n.

00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:06.580
This is order reaction.

00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:08.060
It's not mole number
over there.

00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:10.300
You've got to be pluralistic
today.

00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:11.730
n is going to be used
in different ways.

00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:18.510
So this is called order
of reaction.

00:30:18.510 --> 00:30:19.825
And there's a constant.

00:30:19.825 --> 00:30:20.480
See up there?

00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:21.850
It's a proportionality.

00:30:21.850 --> 00:30:24.660
Here it's an equal sign,
thanks to the constant.

00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:26.270
And this is called the
rate constant.

00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:33.300
And this what all I need
for plant design.

00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:37.300
Suppose I'm running a chemical
plant and I'm taking a plus b

00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:39.590
and making c plus d and the
management says, we want to

00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:41.000
double the rate of
productivity.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:42.440
So you go, I know what to do.

00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:44.230
We'll increase the
concentration.

00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:46.180
They say, by how much?

00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:49.230
Well, this allows you, if you
know the value of k and n, you

00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:50.600
want to double this?

00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:53.090
Then you know what to do here.

00:30:53.090 --> 00:30:55.620
It's not necessarily double
the concentration, Because

00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:57.710
this is a 1.5 power.

00:30:57.710 --> 00:30:59.720
By the way, this doesn't
have to be an integer.

00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:00.760
Could be anything.

00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:11.180
Could be not necessarily integer
and must be determined

00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:12.430
by experiment.

00:31:14.650 --> 00:31:17.030
You can't look at an equation
and say, oh, that's going to

00:31:17.030 --> 00:31:17.980
be second order because
there's a

00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:19.950
two in front of something.

00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:22.385
So here we are, plant
designers.

00:31:22.385 --> 00:31:24.680
And the management wants
to know, how do

00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:25.690
we make things happen?

00:31:25.690 --> 00:31:27.960
So I'm going to go back to that
equation over there and

00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:32.890
I'll say that most generally,
the rate of change of

00:31:32.890 --> 00:31:38.050
concentration of a will then go
as rate constant times the

00:31:38.050 --> 00:31:39.370
concentration of a.

00:31:39.370 --> 00:31:41.860
See, the rate of change
goes as something

00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:43.550
to the power alpha.

00:31:43.550 --> 00:31:47.470
But it could also be
influenced by b.

00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:49.470
So I'm going to put-- this
is the most general form.

00:31:49.470 --> 00:31:51.150
Then once you make your
measurements, a lot

00:31:51.150 --> 00:31:52.570
of these fall out.

00:31:52.570 --> 00:31:56.120
I'm even going to put c
I'm going to put d.

00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:58.900
Everything was in
that equation.

00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:00.270
You might say, well,
wait a minute.

00:32:00.270 --> 00:32:03.630
How can the rate of consumption
of a be influenced

00:32:03.630 --> 00:32:05.350
by the concentration of d?

00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:07.090
d is a product.

00:32:07.090 --> 00:32:08.490
I'll give you two examples.

00:32:08.490 --> 00:32:13.070
One is that d, when I'm making
d, d happens to have some

00:32:13.070 --> 00:32:15.350
catalytic value.

00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:19.740
So when I start making a convert
to d, d catalyzes the

00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:22.810
reaction, which makes it go
faster, which makes more d,

00:32:22.810 --> 00:32:27.060
which makes the reaction go
faster, in which case this is

00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:28.810
going to have a profound
effect.

00:32:28.810 --> 00:32:32.010
And unfortunately, there are
some other situations where a

00:32:32.010 --> 00:32:35.790
converts to d and d retards
the reaction.

00:32:35.790 --> 00:32:38.960
And so I start off with pretty
decent conversion efficiency,

00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:43.120
but as I make more and more d,
the d chokes the reaction, in

00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:47.070
which case the value here is
going to have negative

00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:47.750
implications.

00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:49.980
So that's why you write it most
generally, and then you

00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:51.795
go and you make some
measurements in an experiment,

00:32:51.795 --> 00:32:53.300
and you figure out
what these are.

00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:55.710
Some of them might be zeroes,
and away you go.

00:32:55.710 --> 00:32:58.510
So I'll give you an
example of one.

00:32:58.510 --> 00:32:58.980
Here's one.

00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:01.100
It's Monday after Halloween,
so we'll get

00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:02.770
something kind of toxic.

00:33:02.770 --> 00:33:08.600
This was the manufacture of
phosgene that was banned by

00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:10.220
international convention.

00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:13.110
It was used as one of the toxic
gases for trench warfare

00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:14.700
in World War I.

00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:17.670
So it's made by the
reaction of carbon

00:33:17.670 --> 00:33:19.880
monoxide and chlorine.

00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:21.010
COCL2.

00:33:21.010 --> 00:33:22.720
This is called phosgene.

00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:23.910
It's very bad stuff.

00:33:23.910 --> 00:33:25.430
I used it, actually,
in my research.

00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:29.990
It has really good dehydration
properties for salts.

00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:32.470
If you've got any moisture in
potassium chloride, this'll go

00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:37.110
after it and turn the water into
carbon dioxide and HCl.

00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:39.180
But you've got to be really,
really careful with this.

00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:42.280
Gas leaks lead to a bad
day at the lab.

00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:44.520
All right, this was banned.

00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:47.580
It's still use by tyrants
throughout the world, and

00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:50.580
that's why we have international
war tribunals.

00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:53.700
So here's the kinetics of it.

00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:54.820
Here's the kinetics of it.

00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:55.920
dc by dt.

00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:58.660
So this is the rate of
consumption of carbon monoxide

00:33:58.660 --> 00:34:02.970
determined by experiment goes as
the concentration of carbon

00:34:02.970 --> 00:34:06.850
monoxide and the concentration
of chlorine raised

00:34:06.850 --> 00:34:08.730
to the power 3/2.

00:34:08.730 --> 00:34:13.340
So what I've done
is mimic here.

00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:17.490
So in this case, gamma
and delta are 0.

00:34:17.490 --> 00:34:23.790
Gamma equals delta equals 0, and
it looks like beta equals

00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:26.600
1.5 and alpha equals 1.

00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:29.550
So I would say that this
reaction is first order in

00:34:29.550 --> 00:34:34.650
carbon monoxide of order
1.5 in chlorine, or

00:34:34.650 --> 00:34:36.960
overall, of order 2.5.

00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:37.330
Because, right?

00:34:37.330 --> 00:34:39.340
This is the order of reaction.

00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:41.310
This is c to the power
1, isn't it?

00:34:41.310 --> 00:34:43.840
We don't write the 1.

00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:45.940
This is great.

00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:49.110
So we know, to increase the rate
of reaction we increase

00:34:49.110 --> 00:34:50.080
the concentration.

00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:52.050
There's another way to increase
the rate of reaction.

00:34:52.050 --> 00:34:53.865
What else can we do to increase
the rate of reaction?

00:34:56.990 --> 00:34:58.290
Increase the temperature.

00:34:58.290 --> 00:35:00.270
Things go faster at higher
temperatures.

00:35:00.270 --> 00:35:01.520
Again, how?

00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:02.480
How much?

00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:05.080
Suppose I said, I want to double
the rate of reaction.

00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:07.270
Do I double the temperature?

00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:09.820
Do I raise the temperature
by 10 degrees?

00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:11.750
How do I do that?

00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:20.130
So to increase rate of reaction,
we can increase

00:35:20.130 --> 00:35:21.380
temperature.

00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:24.720
But how?

00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:27.290
And by the way, where
is temperature here?

00:35:27.290 --> 00:35:29.090
I don't see temperature.

00:35:29.090 --> 00:35:31.550
I don't see temperature
in this rate equation.

00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:33.130
You could say, well, if you
increase the temperature

00:35:33.130 --> 00:35:34.470
you're going to increase
the gas volume.

00:35:34.470 --> 00:35:36.550
But that's piddling
effect, right?

00:35:36.550 --> 00:35:38.530
If I double the temperature,
I double the gas volume.

00:35:38.530 --> 00:35:40.190
It doesn't change
the mole number.

00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:42.020
The temperatures in here.

00:35:42.020 --> 00:35:45.160
That's where the temperature.

00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:46.980
Increase temperature,
which then

00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:49.685
operates on the rate constant.

00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:55.540
That's the only place left
in that formalism.

00:35:55.540 --> 00:35:57.420
But what's the quantitative
value?

00:35:57.420 --> 00:36:02.530
Quantitative value was
annunciated to us in 1889 by

00:36:02.530 --> 00:36:03.955
the Swedish chemist Arrhenius.

00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:11.730
And what Arrhenius found, he
found that the rate constant

00:36:11.730 --> 00:36:14.080
varied with temperature in
the following manner.

00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:20.730
Rate constant goes as the
exponential of the ratio of

00:36:20.730 --> 00:36:24.730
minus some quantity call the
activation energy e sub a--

00:36:24.730 --> 00:36:26.750
I'm going to tell you what
that means in a minute--

00:36:26.750 --> 00:36:29.750
divided by the ratio of the
product of the Boltzmann

00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:31.720
constant and temperature.

00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:35.220
And there's a constant of
proportionality which we

00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:38.010
denote A in honor
of Arrhenius.

00:36:38.010 --> 00:36:43.130
Or another way to write this
is A times exponential--

00:36:43.130 --> 00:36:44.460
are you familiar with this?

00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:47.570
Instead of writing e to the
something, if there's a messy

00:36:47.570 --> 00:36:49.970
argument up here you
can write it exp.

00:36:49.970 --> 00:36:55.860
This is the same as this minus
ea over the ratio of Boltzmann

00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:58.520
constant and temperature.

00:36:58.520 --> 00:36:59.550
So what's in here?

00:36:59.550 --> 00:37:00.730
What's in here?

00:37:00.730 --> 00:37:02.180
Boltzmann constant temperature,

00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:03.520
we've seen that already.

00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:06.600
What's the Boltzmann constant
temperature product?

00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:08.030
That's the environment.

00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:11.530
That's the energy of
the environment.

00:37:11.530 --> 00:37:15.720
So this is the final
environment.

00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:23.210
And this thing up on top,
ea, is a barrier.

00:37:23.210 --> 00:37:24.260
It's a barrier.

00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:26.140
Remember we saw the band gap?

00:37:26.140 --> 00:37:27.090
Same idea.

00:37:27.090 --> 00:37:30.630
Those ideas go all through
physical chemistry.

00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:33.860
You got thermal energy that
allows you to do this 10

00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:35.180
trillion times a second.

00:37:35.180 --> 00:37:36.940
Everybody in this room
is doing this 10

00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:39.830
trillion times a second.

00:37:39.830 --> 00:37:41.470
That's what kT is.

00:37:41.470 --> 00:37:43.390
And then there's a
barrier energy.

00:37:43.390 --> 00:37:46.420
Every once in a while
something happens.

00:37:46.420 --> 00:37:49.240
Sometimes one in a million,
sometimes one in a billion.

00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:50.490
Whatever.

00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:56.170
What Arrhenius found was this
relationship, which means we

00:37:56.170 --> 00:38:05.220
could plot the variation
of the rate constant.

00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:06.130
This is a mess, right?

00:38:06.130 --> 00:38:07.980
This is an exponential--

00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:10.740
look, the eye can only
see straight lines.

00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:14.240
What if I show you this?

00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:14.930
What's that mean?

00:38:14.930 --> 00:38:16.640
I don't know.

00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:17.440
Is that first order?

00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:18.150
Second order?

00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:19.150
Is that Lagrangian?

00:38:19.150 --> 00:38:20.420
Is that exponential?

00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:21.730
I don't know.

00:38:21.730 --> 00:38:22.640
I know it's a curve.

00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:24.680
But what's this?

00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:26.640
I know what that is.

00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:27.990
And you know what that is.

00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:31.380
And you can tell goodness
of fit.

00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:33.270
This is what science
is all about.

00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:34.290
Forget all the other stuff.

00:38:34.290 --> 00:38:35.290
You know, all that UROP stuff.

00:38:35.290 --> 00:38:37.660
You're going to work in a
lab and discover stuff.

00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:38.360
Forget that.

00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:39.980
This is what it's about.

00:38:39.980 --> 00:38:40.840
You got data.

00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:42.350
Data are all over the map.

00:38:42.350 --> 00:38:43.230
Here's the thing--

00:38:43.230 --> 00:38:48.560
I need to come up with some
f function here versus a g

00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:52.200
function here that linearize
my data.

00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:54.120
That's all science is about.

00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:55.720
And how do I get to f and g?

00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:56.720
Well, there's two ways.

00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:58.040
One is trial and error.

00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:01.440
The other way is physical
understanding.

00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:03.590
And this is what Arrhenius
taught us.

00:39:03.590 --> 00:39:07.600
Arrhenius taught us that the f
function for how k varies with

00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:09.630
temperature, right?

00:39:09.630 --> 00:39:12.610
The problem, I'm trying
to say, k versus t.

00:39:12.610 --> 00:39:13.990
That's what I'm trying to do.

00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:16.730
And if I plot k versus
t I get a curve.

00:39:16.730 --> 00:39:17.740
No good.

00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:24.650
Instead, if I plot some f of
k versus g of t, I get a

00:39:24.650 --> 00:39:26.290
straight line.

00:39:26.290 --> 00:39:27.740
And this is all science.

00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:29.920
So what's f of k?

00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:31.870
The natural logarithm
of k, right?

00:39:31.870 --> 00:39:34.860
If I've got k equals a
exponential, I take the

00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:37.415
natural log of this, and the
natural log of an exponential

00:39:37.415 --> 00:39:39.650
is just the argument.

00:39:39.650 --> 00:39:40.820
And what's in the argument?

00:39:40.820 --> 00:39:42.940
What's the T function?

00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:44.120
1 over T.

00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:48.750
So if I plot the natural log of
k versus the reciprocal of

00:39:48.750 --> 00:39:51.910
the absolute temperature, I get
a straight line and its

00:39:51.910 --> 00:39:59.020
slope is minus ea, forgive me,
minus ea over k-Boltzmann.

00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:02.120
Minus ea over k-Boltzmann.

00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:05.440
So now it's linearized and I can
look at that and within an

00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:08.330
instant, anybody in this room
can look at and say, the data

00:40:08.330 --> 00:40:10.110
conform or they don't.

00:40:10.110 --> 00:40:11.360
They don't.

00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:13.290
So now let's think about this.

00:40:13.290 --> 00:40:19.650
We say well, what's the
value of this barrier?

00:40:19.650 --> 00:40:21.560
It's called activation energy.

00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:24.820
This barrier energy is called
activation energy.

00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:31.410
ea is called the activation
energy.

00:40:31.410 --> 00:40:34.550
And it typically, it varies,
but it has values--

00:40:34.550 --> 00:40:37.990
just to give you a sense--
about 1 electron volt.

00:40:37.990 --> 00:40:41.500
1 electron volt, which you
know now is about 100

00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:45.620
kilojoules per mole, isn't it?

00:40:45.620 --> 00:40:47.420
I hear the chorus of yesses.

00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:48.600
1 electron volt.

00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:49.750
What is thermal energy?

00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:51.410
What's kT?

00:40:51.410 --> 00:40:54.230
kT at room temperature,
k-Boltzmann at room

00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:59.500
temperature is about 1/40
of an electron volt.

00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:01.910
Now, we are chemical machines.

00:41:01.910 --> 00:41:06.740
This conversation is occurring
because all sorts of chemical

00:41:06.740 --> 00:41:10.460
processes are at work
in me and you.

00:41:10.460 --> 00:41:12.770
And how's that happening?

00:41:12.770 --> 00:41:16.970
When all we've got to suck out
of the environment is 1/40 of

00:41:16.970 --> 00:41:20.662
an electron volt and we need on
the order one electron volt

00:41:20.662 --> 00:41:22.035
to drive certain processes.

00:41:24.990 --> 00:41:28.450
I guess we're all dead.

00:41:28.450 --> 00:41:29.700
Any ideas?

00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:38.520
Ay yay, yay.

00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:39.440
You guys need--

00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:40.050
what's that thing?

00:41:40.050 --> 00:41:43.190
You've got to call your
lifeline or something?

00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:44.260
Come on.

00:41:44.260 --> 00:41:45.110
How does anything happen?

00:41:45.110 --> 00:41:46.630
How do we get--

00:41:46.630 --> 00:41:49.560
Why does anything happen
in this world?

00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:53.160
Why should anything happen in a
world with an environment of

00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:55.210
1/40 of an electron volt?

00:41:55.210 --> 00:41:56.365
AUDIENCE: Catalysts.

00:41:56.365 --> 00:41:58.500
PROFESSOR: Oh, catalysts.

00:41:58.500 --> 00:41:58.990
Catalysts.

00:41:58.990 --> 00:42:00.660
Yeah, yeah.

00:42:00.660 --> 00:42:04.810
I just went to the catalyst
store and I got catalysts.

00:42:04.810 --> 00:42:06.402
Come on.

00:42:06.402 --> 00:42:07.740
AUDIENCE: Potential energy.

00:42:07.740 --> 00:42:08.550
PROFESSOR: Oh, potential
energy.

00:42:08.550 --> 00:42:10.340
Jeez, this is good.

00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:12.130
Who can give me the
wackiest answer?

00:42:12.130 --> 00:42:13.590
Can anybody give me
the right answer?

00:42:13.590 --> 00:42:15.060
How come anything
is happening?

00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:19.110
Over here.

00:42:19.110 --> 00:42:19.560
Again?

00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:20.850
AUDIENCE: Distribution
of temperature.

00:42:20.850 --> 00:42:22.240
PROFESSOR: Thank you.

00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:23.500
Thank you.

00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:26.940
For a moment I thought
we were all dead.

00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:31.460
At some level we were.

00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:33.320
So, yeah, it's
Maxwell-Boltzmann.

00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:35.070
It's this, isn't it?

00:42:35.070 --> 00:42:37.260
And here's room temperature.

00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:39.940
And here is 1 electron volt.

00:42:39.940 --> 00:42:40.930
And this is it.

00:42:40.930 --> 00:42:43.600
And if you use this and you put
it back to there, pretty

00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:45.660
soon you derive the Arrhenius
equation.

00:42:45.660 --> 00:42:49.620
And if you increase
the temperature

00:42:49.620 --> 00:42:50.480
you know what happens.

00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:53.530
After you increase the
temperature, this.

00:42:53.530 --> 00:42:57.200
Time to use a hot
color or chalk.

00:42:57.200 --> 00:43:01.810
So now this is T2
greater than T1.

00:43:01.810 --> 00:43:03.720
That's what's going on.

00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:04.600
That's what's going on.

00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:06.460
So now what is this
activation energy?

00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:08.280
What is the meaning of it?

00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:09.940
You know, I've told you there's
a barrier energy.

00:43:09.940 --> 00:43:10.870
What does it mean?

00:43:10.870 --> 00:43:15.160
Well, you go to the textbook,
you see goofy stuff like this.

00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:17.000
And this is not a slam
against the textbook.

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.660
This is a slam against all
chemistry textbooks, because

00:43:19.660 --> 00:43:21.000
they all write this
stupid stuff.

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:24.360
You see? a plus b goes c plus
d, the energy falls and you

00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:26.640
have to go over this
activated complex.

00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:29.470
You memorize it, and I ask you
to repeat, it and we leave the

00:43:29.470 --> 00:43:31.970
room and we think, wow, we
know physical chemistry.

00:43:31.970 --> 00:43:32.810
There's nothing here.

00:43:32.810 --> 00:43:33.405
This is nothing.

00:43:33.405 --> 00:43:35.230
This is stupid.

00:43:35.230 --> 00:43:36.960
Now this is a little
bit better.

00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:38.070
Can you see this?

00:43:38.070 --> 00:43:39.030
This is the Maxwell-Boltzmann.

00:43:39.030 --> 00:43:42.260
This is actually a beautiful
graph up to a point.

00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:43.840
See the Maxwell-Boltzmann?

00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:45.980
Low temperature, high
temperature.

00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:48.110
Only they've turned this
thing on its side.

00:43:48.110 --> 00:43:48.630
See?

00:43:48.630 --> 00:43:50.490
And there's the energy
you need to get over

00:43:50.490 --> 00:43:51.620
the activated complex.

00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:53.350
You see what's wrong
with this graph?

00:43:53.350 --> 00:43:54.040
What's wrong with it?

00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:55.486
AUDIENCE: The product.

00:43:55.486 --> 00:43:57.160
PROFESSOR: Yeah, the product
is at a higher

00:43:57.160 --> 00:43:58.290
level than the reactants.

00:43:58.290 --> 00:44:01.630
I looked at that and
I thought, whoa!

00:44:01.630 --> 00:44:03.580
I guess you'll activate them,
but they won't go anywhere.

00:44:03.580 --> 00:44:06.940
Anyway, so this is all stupid.

00:44:06.940 --> 00:44:08.030
What can we do?

00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:08.690
What can we do?

00:44:08.690 --> 00:44:11.280
So I decided to give you
a mechanical analogy.

00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:12.970
So imagine this is
the loudspeaker.

00:44:12.970 --> 00:44:14.400
Can you say the x?

00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:16.120
People in the back,
can you see the x?

00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:18.280
Give me a thumbs up.

00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:19.120
Great eyes.

00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:19.570
All right.

00:44:19.570 --> 00:44:22.460
So what do we see here?

00:44:22.460 --> 00:44:24.850
The center of mass, I've
indicated here.

00:44:24.850 --> 00:44:25.370
All right.

00:44:25.370 --> 00:44:28.560
So this is in a certain
energy state.

00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:29.840
Let's get the right
graph up there.

00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:32.440
This is awful.

00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:32.790
All right.

00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:34.680
So this is a plus b.

00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:36.420
Now this is c plus d.

00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:38.630
You see, the center
of mass fell.

00:44:38.630 --> 00:44:39.170
It's lower.

00:44:39.170 --> 00:44:42.310
It's closer to the table
than it is here.

00:44:42.310 --> 00:44:43.920
Can you see when I go like
this, the photon goes?

00:44:46.490 --> 00:44:47.740
Watch this.

00:44:50.210 --> 00:44:51.520
Yeah, only I can see it.

00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:53.990
Your eyes don't go to that
end of the spectrum.

00:44:53.990 --> 00:44:54.270
All right.

00:44:54.270 --> 00:44:55.000
But what's wrong with it?

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:58.030
So why does the box
not fall over?

00:44:58.030 --> 00:44:58.930
Why does it not fall over?

00:44:58.930 --> 00:45:01.790
We agreed that this is a lower
energy state, and it is.

00:45:01.790 --> 00:45:02.810
You're correct.

00:45:02.810 --> 00:45:08.950
So why does the box manage to
stay here and not fall over?

00:45:08.950 --> 00:45:10.758
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE PHRASE]

00:45:10.758 --> 00:45:12.070
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:45:12.070 --> 00:45:14.400
This is the box at 0 Kelvin.

00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:16.940
Now we start raising the energy
of the box, it starts

00:45:16.940 --> 00:45:17.890
doing this.

00:45:17.890 --> 00:45:20.860
Because above 0 Kelvin,
it vibrates.

00:45:20.860 --> 00:45:22.975
The higher the temperature,
the greater the vibration.

00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:28.640
But we're still in trouble here,
you see, because you've

00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:30.840
only got 1/40 of an
electron volt.

00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:33.150
So now we invoke distribution.

00:45:33.150 --> 00:45:34.960
I don't know what's happening
with any box.

00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:36.140
Heisenberg tells me that.

00:45:36.140 --> 00:45:37.870
I don't know what's happening
to any box.

00:45:37.870 --> 00:45:41.510
But if I take Avogadro's number
of boxes I'll get this

00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:42.990
distribution.

00:45:42.990 --> 00:45:47.910
And some boxes will vibrate
very little.

00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:50.600
And some boxes will
vibrate a lot.

00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:53.170
And what's the critical
level of vibration?

00:45:53.170 --> 00:45:54.730
It's to get to here.

00:45:54.730 --> 00:45:58.630
Because once it gets to here
it's downhill all the way.

00:45:58.630 --> 00:46:02.100
And that would be the
activation energy.

00:46:02.100 --> 00:46:05.620
And the fraction of boxes that
get to the value of activation

00:46:05.620 --> 00:46:09.200
energy tip over and then I
restore the distribution,

00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:11.990
because now this one's out of
the game and now I distribute

00:46:11.990 --> 00:46:13.800
that energy over the
remaining ones.

00:46:13.800 --> 00:46:16.550
And as I increase the
temperature, the amplitude of

00:46:16.550 --> 00:46:19.240
the vibration increases, the
average increases, the

00:46:19.240 --> 00:46:22.050
fraction in that red zone
increases, and at some

00:46:22.050 --> 00:46:27.040
temperature it's so, so hot that
they actually do this, in

00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:29.030
which case I have equilibrium.

00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:31.640
The two states are
in equilibrium.

00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:32.940
So that's it.

00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:33.810
This is what's going on.

00:46:33.810 --> 00:46:36.390
So in three space, you can't go
from here to here without

00:46:36.390 --> 00:46:37.400
going to here.

00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:40.390
You can try going this way so
you-- no, you have to do this.

00:46:40.390 --> 00:46:43.470
It still has to be mechanically
activated so we

00:46:43.470 --> 00:46:47.940
can show that this is what
activation means.

00:46:47.940 --> 00:46:49.020
So we can plot--

00:46:49.020 --> 00:46:52.550
this deserves it's own board--

00:46:52.550 --> 00:46:55.220
so we will plot something
like this.

00:46:55.220 --> 00:46:56.640
And now you'll see this.

00:46:56.640 --> 00:46:58.930
Sometimes they write
this in the books.

00:46:58.930 --> 00:46:59.600
It's kind of goofy.

00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:01.790
But they write stuff
like this.

00:47:01.790 --> 00:47:04.440
This is some kind of an
energy coordinate.

00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:05.820
This is an energy coordinate.

00:47:05.820 --> 00:47:10.140
And this is called a reaction
coordinate.

00:47:10.140 --> 00:47:13.080
OR sometimes they write
extent of reaction.

00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:14.500
Again, some P-Chem term.

00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:18.090
They usually use Greek C just
to make it lofty, but it's

00:47:18.090 --> 00:47:18.720
meaningless.

00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:21.290
And then so you write like
this-- reactants here,

00:47:21.290 --> 00:47:26.880
products here, and this is
exactly what we're seeing.

00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:28.770
What do we see?

00:47:28.770 --> 00:47:29.990
We see this.

00:47:29.990 --> 00:47:35.190
Here we have the box
sitting like so.

00:47:35.190 --> 00:47:39.520
And then over here we have
the box sitting like so.

00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:43.285
And right here we have
the box up like so.

00:47:45.830 --> 00:47:48.640
And so now you have, here's
the initial energy.

00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:51.890
This is the energy
of the reactants.

00:47:51.890 --> 00:47:56.170
E of the reactants.

00:47:56.170 --> 00:48:00.170
This is E of the products.

00:48:00.170 --> 00:48:03.440
So then this distance
here must be

00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:04.695
delta E of the reaction.

00:48:07.350 --> 00:48:10.510
And what's this?

00:48:10.510 --> 00:48:12.090
That's the activation energy.

00:48:12.090 --> 00:48:14.140
I have to come up with this;
otherwise, I can't make the

00:48:14.140 --> 00:48:15.440
box fall over.

00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:19.740
So this is ea to go from here
up onto the corner.

00:48:19.740 --> 00:48:21.530
And now you understand what
all this stuff means.

00:48:21.530 --> 00:48:22.440
So that's here.

00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:24.250
And this is the activated
complex.

00:48:27.030 --> 00:48:28.340
What's an activated complex?

00:48:28.340 --> 00:48:30.390
It's a box on its edge
ready to fall over.

00:48:30.390 --> 00:48:31.820
That's what it is.

00:48:31.820 --> 00:48:34.230
All right.

00:48:34.230 --> 00:48:37.640
I think we're out of time, so
let's cut to the end here.

00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:39.190
What've we got.

00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:39.910
Oh, just some plots.

00:48:39.910 --> 00:48:41.390
We'll get to that next day.

00:48:41.390 --> 00:48:42.950
All right.

00:48:42.950 --> 00:48:43.890
So I want to show
you a little bit

00:48:43.890 --> 00:48:45.910
about first-order reactions.

00:48:45.910 --> 00:48:48.280
This is radiocarbon dating.

00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:49.630
n equals 1.

00:48:49.630 --> 00:48:51.970
And strictly speaking, this is
not a chemical reaction, but

00:48:51.970 --> 00:48:53.320
it is first order.

00:48:53.320 --> 00:48:54.600
So I'll lump it in here.

00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:56.520
So this is a nuclear reaction.

00:48:56.520 --> 00:48:58.220
And what happens in the
upper atmosphere?

00:48:58.220 --> 00:49:01.970
Radioactive carbon produced by
cosmic rays, which generate

00:49:01.970 --> 00:49:03.940
neutrons in the upper atmosphere
and then those

00:49:03.940 --> 00:49:07.040
neutrons attack nitrogen
to make carbon 14.

00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:08.650
That's the radioactive
form of carbon.

00:49:08.650 --> 00:49:08.870
Remember?

00:49:08.870 --> 00:49:10.970
It's present in one part per
trillion, if you look on your

00:49:10.970 --> 00:49:13.280
Periodic Table for
the isotopes.

00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:15.760
Now carbon 14 enters
the carbon cycle.

00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:19.410
And so in all of us and in all
living organisms the ratio of

00:49:19.410 --> 00:49:22.790
carbon 14 to carbon 12 is
one part per trillion.

00:49:22.790 --> 00:49:24.760
And carbon 13 is also present.

00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:25.140
I don't know.

00:49:25.140 --> 00:49:25.420
What is it?

00:49:25.420 --> 00:49:27.240
1 point something percent?

00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:30.780
The thing is, the carbon
14 is radioactive.

00:49:30.780 --> 00:49:32.470
And it decays.

00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:33.840
Like this.

00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:36.210
But what happens after
somebody dies?

00:49:36.210 --> 00:49:39.990
Well, they stop exchanging
nutrients with the

00:49:39.990 --> 00:49:40.550
surroundings.

00:49:40.550 --> 00:49:43.810
They stop breathing, so their
carbon level is pegged as it

00:49:43.810 --> 00:49:45.870
was at the time of death.

00:49:45.870 --> 00:49:47.410
And now it's a one0way street.

00:49:47.410 --> 00:49:49.130
It's just carbon decay.

00:49:49.130 --> 00:49:51.885
And it turns out you can measure
the ratio of carbon 14

00:49:51.885 --> 00:49:56.890
to carbon 12 to determine the
age, which is given by 5,730

00:49:56.890 --> 00:50:01.970
years, which is the inverse
of the rate constant.

00:50:01.970 --> 00:50:04.530
Now, you can't use this for
crime scene investigations,

00:50:04.530 --> 00:50:07.290
but certainly you can start
dating things hundreds of

00:50:07.290 --> 00:50:09.940
years old, not hundreds
of minutes old.

00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:12.090
So there's a whole bunch of
other things that can be used,

00:50:12.090 --> 00:50:12.860
not just carbon.

00:50:12.860 --> 00:50:15.140
So this is radiochemical
dating.

00:50:15.140 --> 00:50:19.960
And these are used in trying to
nail down art forgeries and

00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:21.190
all sorts of things.

00:50:21.190 --> 00:50:21.890
All right.

00:50:21.890 --> 00:50:23.030
So here, you can see these.

00:50:23.030 --> 00:50:25.020
These have all been
radiocarbon dated.

00:50:25.020 --> 00:50:27.270
You know, the Dead Sea Scrolls
were radiocarbon dated and

00:50:27.270 --> 00:50:29.290
they look like they're from
about 2,000 years ago.

00:50:29.290 --> 00:50:31.300
Makes sense.

00:50:31.300 --> 00:50:32.970
You go out over here.

00:50:32.970 --> 00:50:37.020
They they found these Indian
sandals from Oregon, and then

00:50:37.020 --> 00:50:40.250
they looked on an electron
microscope, and they found

00:50:40.250 --> 00:50:44.740
something on the sandals that
looks a little bit like that.

00:50:44.740 --> 00:50:46.030
That's a Nike swoosh.

00:50:46.030 --> 00:50:46.630
I don't know.

00:50:46.630 --> 00:50:48.320
You people are so--

00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:49.390
All right.

00:50:49.390 --> 00:50:51.590
So now I want to show you
the Shroud of Turin.

00:50:51.590 --> 00:50:56.470
The Shroud of Turin, as you may
know, for a long time was

00:50:56.470 --> 00:50:59.510
reputed to be the burial shroud
of Jesus Christ. And

00:50:59.510 --> 00:51:01.960
this is taken from the National
Geographic back in

00:51:01.960 --> 00:51:04.050
the late '80s.

00:51:04.050 --> 00:51:06.290
Back in the late '80s, they
did a major study on it.

00:51:06.290 --> 00:51:09.530
So this is the artist rendition
of how the shroud

00:51:09.530 --> 00:51:11.360
might have been wrapped
around a body.

00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:13.550
The question is, what's
the date of this?

00:51:13.550 --> 00:51:15.250
So we can use radiocarbon
dating.

00:51:15.250 --> 00:51:19.520
And so here's the formation
of carbon 14.

00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:23.200
Carbon 14 exchanges with
carbon 12 in flax.

00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:24.820
So it's got one part
per trillion.

00:51:24.820 --> 00:51:28.800
When the flax is harvested the
carbon 14 starts to decay.

00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:30.700
And then we look at
the weaving of the

00:51:30.700 --> 00:51:31.780
shroud and so on.

00:51:31.780 --> 00:51:34.500
And they had three different
labs, they took samples from

00:51:34.500 --> 00:51:35.240
the shroud.

00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:37.050
And they concluded
that the shroud

00:51:37.050 --> 00:51:38.040
dates from this period--

00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:39.900
1260 to 1390.

00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:41.930
And the first time it was
mentioned in the literature

00:51:41.930 --> 00:51:43.010
was around 1354.

00:51:43.010 --> 00:51:45.860
So everything seems to make
sense that this is not the

00:51:45.860 --> 00:51:49.470
burial shroud of Jesus Christ.
It's something that has

00:51:49.470 --> 00:51:54.010
importance to certain members of
the Roman Church, but it's

00:51:54.010 --> 00:51:55.460
scientifically not.

00:51:55.460 --> 00:51:57.320
You know, this stirs up
a lot of passion.

00:51:57.320 --> 00:51:58.680
So people started saying,
wait a minute.

00:51:58.680 --> 00:51:59.440
Wait a minute.

00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:03.910
There was a fire in 1532 and
people repaired the shroud and

00:52:03.910 --> 00:52:06.900
they were using candlelight
and maybe the paraffin and

00:52:06.900 --> 00:52:09.780
mold and so on covered
the fibers.

00:52:09.780 --> 00:52:12.100
So now, are we looking at
the surface effect?

00:52:12.100 --> 00:52:13.490
How do we know what
really happened?

00:52:13.490 --> 00:52:15.350
The only way to know is to take
the whole shroud, put in

00:52:15.350 --> 00:52:18.590
a big Cuisinart and break
open the interior.

00:52:18.590 --> 00:52:21.740
Well, in point of fact, what
they did was take fibers and

00:52:21.740 --> 00:52:22.450
look inside.

00:52:22.450 --> 00:52:26.170
And I think as of the late '90s,
the Roman Church says,

00:52:26.170 --> 00:52:29.200
it's not the burial shroud
of Jesus, but it is

00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:30.330
an object of reverence.

00:52:30.330 --> 00:52:32.160
And I think it's a good
example of how science

00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:35.940
sometimes comes up against
spirituality, and we have to

00:52:35.940 --> 00:52:37.844
be careful how we handle it.

00:52:37.844 --> 00:52:40.360
It's a delicate matter.
