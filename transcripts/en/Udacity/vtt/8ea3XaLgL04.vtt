Remember, I still have 1 3rd of a cup of sugar that I can use at home to make

00:00:04.489 --> 00:00:09.362
brownies. I've drawn it over here, this 1 3rd cup of sugar actually represents 2

00:00:09.374 --> 00:00:14.222
fraction amounts. I can see that this 1 3rd cup of sugar actually represents 1/2

00:00:14.234 --> 00:00:19.015
of a batch of brownies. So I made one batch of brownies from 2 3rds cup of sugar

00:00:19.027 --> 00:00:23.520
and I made a half a batch of brownies from 1 3rd cup of sugar. And all together

00:00:23.532 --> 00:00:27.775
I used 1 3rd and 2 3rds which is 1 cup. I can see all together I made one and a

00:00:27.787 --> 00:00:32.409
half batches of brownies. I used 2 3rds cup of sugar to make one batch. And then

00:00:32.421 --> 00:00:36.875
with the extra 1 3rd cup of sugar I made half of a batch. I saw that, that piece

00:00:36.887 --> 00:00:39.552
was a half of a batch of brownies. So one and a half all together.
