00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:02.794
- Welcome to my shop.

00:00:02.794 --> 00:00:04.337
We're back home
in Interlachen, Florida.

00:00:04.337 --> 00:00:06.047
I like crazy stuff.
I like wild stuff.

00:00:06.047 --> 00:00:08.675
You can see it
in the forges that I build.

00:00:08.675 --> 00:00:11.845
We've got gas forges,
different variations.

00:00:11.845 --> 00:00:14.180
Blower-type gas forges.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:15.140
Atmospheric.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:16.683
I put a lot of effort

00:00:16.683 --> 00:00:18.184
in building these forges,

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:20.478
trying to make 'em look
like different animals.

00:00:20.478 --> 00:00:22.689
We got some more big
weldin' forges right here.

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:24.524
Forged a lot of axes
in this one.

00:00:24.524 --> 00:00:27.527
Got some more of my
critter forges sittin' here.

00:00:27.527 --> 00:00:28.695
When we start buildin' em,

00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:30.280
they take a life of theirself.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.948
It's all built
out of scrap metal,

00:00:31.948 --> 00:00:34.617
and you just gotta envision
what you're looking at,

00:00:34.617 --> 00:00:37.662
and the piece just literally
falls together.

00:00:37.662 --> 00:00:39.873
- Well, we're here
in Kingsley, Michigan.

00:00:39.873 --> 00:00:42.208
I want to show you my shop.

00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:44.127
Here, this is my forge.

00:00:44.127 --> 00:00:45.879
I got LP gas.

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:49.299
I got a 110-CFM blower
off of a copying machine.

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:51.551
And here's a 25-ton

00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:53.720
C-frame hydraulic press.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:55.722
I use it primarily for welding.

00:00:55.722 --> 00:00:58.266
Here's my 110-pound
pneumatic hammer.

00:00:58.266 --> 00:01:00.185
Got a 5-horse motor.

00:01:00.185 --> 00:01:02.687
Self-contained.

00:01:02.687 --> 00:01:04.022
I have a surface grinder,

00:01:04.022 --> 00:01:06.024
and I use this for making
my folding knives

00:01:06.024 --> 00:01:07.901
and just about anything else

00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:09.402
where you want
a nice, flat surface.

00:01:09.402 --> 00:01:12.113
It's priceless.

00:01:12.113 --> 00:01:14.741
- Got my anvil stations here.

00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:17.202
Got three really nice
antique anvils that I use.

00:01:17.202 --> 00:01:19.078
<i>I searched for years
for most of 'em</i>

00:01:19.078 --> 00:01:21.372
<i>to find the ones I wanted.</i>

00:01:21.372 --> 00:01:24.584
This right here
is a Sisco Superior.

00:01:24.584 --> 00:01:26.628
It's a Swedish anvil.

00:01:26.628 --> 00:01:28.421
They're all cast steel.

00:01:28.421 --> 00:01:31.341
Any of the Swedish anvils
are really sought after.

00:01:31.341 --> 00:01:35.053
<i>They're probably some of
the best anvils ever made.</i>

00:01:35.053 --> 00:01:36.596
This is a 20-pound baby Fisher.

00:01:36.596 --> 00:01:38.640
It's more or less like
a salesman sample.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.016
They carry these around
instead of

00:01:40.016 --> 00:01:41.976
carrying the big anvils around.

00:01:41.976 --> 00:01:43.770
When you look at my shop,
it's all...

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.730
kind of unique to what I like.

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:47.649
There's nothing fancy about it.

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:49.150
<i>[music fades out]</i>

00:01:50.276 --> 00:01:52.487
- And here we got
my belt grinder.

00:01:52.487 --> 00:01:55.323
I made this little tree here

00:01:55.323 --> 00:01:58.326
to hold my attachments
for the grinder.

00:01:58.326 --> 00:02:00.286
Got a 2-horse motor.

00:02:00.286 --> 00:02:01.788
Three-phase.

00:02:01.788 --> 00:02:03.540
It has speed control on it.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.625
And I have
this 14-inch band saw

00:02:05.625 --> 00:02:08.294
that is a six-speed.

00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:11.464
Saws steel, and it saws wood.

00:02:11.464 --> 00:02:15.134
Really I think my handiest tool
around here,

00:02:15.134 --> 00:02:17.595
so it really has served me.

00:02:17.595 --> 00:02:19.556
I've had this
about maybe 30 years now.

00:02:19.556 --> 00:02:20.974
Still runs great.

00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:22.475
This is my shop.
I hope you'd enjoy it.

00:02:22.475 --> 00:02:23.685
Thanks for checking it out.
