00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.680
So, opening is a compound operation.

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.080
So erosion and dilation are primitives.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.710
And it's a erosion followed
by a dilation, okay?

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.640
So that's what a opening is.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.219
And it says here, you can show
that an opening of something

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:21.310
of A by B is the union of all the
translations that fit entirely within A.

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.000
That's kind of complicated and wordy.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.250
It's much easier to see in a picture.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.333
So here's our binary thing A, and
this is our structuring element B.

00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:33.391
And the opening is all the places,

00:00:33.391 --> 00:00:37.940
all the translations within A,
that you can fit B.

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.110
And when you do that,
you would get out this thing here.

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.080
And you'll notice that
it has broken the,

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.530
the connection between
those two triangles.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.420
And it's also rounded the edges.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.490
So, it's not surprising that it's
broken them, because it's too small and

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:56.760
the whole thing doesn't fit there.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.650
And the rounding is because
of the shape with B.

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.430
It says here, and, and
you know, this is a, a slide.

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.319
The opening is the area that we
can paint when the brush has

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:06.270
a footprint of B,

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.940
and we're not allowed to let the brush
get outside of the original image A.

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.040
One of the other cool things is,
if you take a look at this,

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.667
if I now have this shape,
I would open with B again.

00:01:18.667 --> 00:01:23.710
Well, it fits everywhere inside of
there, so it wouldn't change, right?

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.520
That is if I kept going,
it would stay the same.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.300
And that's referred to as idempotent,
or idempotent.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.820
I don't know how you pronounce it.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.270
I know how to spell it.

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.190
It's an operation that when you
repeat it, it makes no change.

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.458
So, if you erode and
then dilate, you get something.

00:01:41.458 --> 00:01:45.100
Well if you then erode and dilate again,
you're not going to make any changes.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.020
Which is not the same as saying if you
had erode, erode, erode, and dilate,

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.840
dilate, dilate, that, that would
be the same as erode and dilate.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.790
So you get that?

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.660
So repeated openings,
which are erode, dilate, erode,

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.910
dilate, that doesn't
buy you anything more.

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:00.580
But sometimes, you want to
erode either multiple times or

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.330
with bigger shaped things,
and then, and dilate again.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.780
So let me show you an example
of using opening for

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.430
like that cell colony thing
we were talking about.

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:10.639
It's a different picture,
but it's the same idea.

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:15.400
So, here we have this Thomas Moeslund,
thank you very much, it, in Aalborg.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.302
So here's an original image, okay,
of some cells that are growing.

00:02:19.302 --> 00:02:22.650
Here is a binary image, okay?

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:29.708
And this is the opening using
a 11 pixel disc, all right?

00:02:29.708 --> 00:02:34.920
And you see that it pulls out,
you know, these cells pretty well.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.980
And when you come over here,
you say okay, so it's got that one,

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.850
it's got that one, it's got that one,
it's got that one.

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.760
It's got that one, it's got that one,
it's got that one, it's got that one.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.170
And you know, clearly,
maybe it misses this one, all right?

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.660
Maybe it misses this one.

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.870
So this tends to be common in
sort of these kinds of things.

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.610
You can find some operation which
tend to pull out what you want, but

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.280
it's not going to be perfect.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.780
All right.
