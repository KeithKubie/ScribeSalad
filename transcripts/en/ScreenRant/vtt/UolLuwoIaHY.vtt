00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.870
Nobody said making a film is supposed to be
easy.

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:15.370
Actors and directors sacrifice a lot of blood
and tears to deliver their projects to the

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:16.620
big screen.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:21.090
Even when things are carefully planned out,
accidents – or even something worse – can

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.090
still happen.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.060
It may not look it, but movie making can be
a dangerous line of work, and there are plenty

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.340
of people who are aware that being a film
star isn’t all glitz and glamour.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.190
Here are 10 times things went horribly wrong
on movie sets.

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.260
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.840
At the start of the second Lord of the Rings
film, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli are saddened

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.180
when they believe Merry and Pippin have been
killed by the orcs.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.579
Standing near a burning pile of carcasses,
Aragorn kicks a helmet across the grass and

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:50.430
lets out a cry of agony.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.850
Director Peter Jackson was impressed by Viggo
Mortensen’s level of anguish for fictional

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.370
characters, but the actor’s performance
in the take was partially because he fractured

00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:59.970
his toe during the scene.

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.430
Mortensen was frequently injured in Middle
earth, even losing a tooth in one stunt.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.759
That only endears him to fans even more.

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:07.759
Twilight

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:11.729
Robert Pattinson’s time as Edward Cullen
could not have gotten off to a worse start

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:12.729
if he tried.

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:17.159
In the very first take he shot for the first
Twilight film, the actor had to life his co-star

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.330
Kristin Stewart.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.140
Of the injury he received while filming, Pattinson
was quite frank, saying, “I lifted Kristin,

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.170
ripped my ass cheek, and had to get a bum
massage.”

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.799
It’s one of those things where you can laugh
about it in retrospect, but at the time it

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:32.639
certainly was no funny matter.

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:36.570
Fortunately, Pattinson didn’t let the poor
experience deter him and worked with Stewart

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.329
on all four films, earning millions of admirers
along the way.

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:42.820
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part
1

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.459
Few jobs in Hollywood are as dangerous as
stuntmen.

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:49.049
No matter how many precautions they take,
things can still go wrong.

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.729
While practicing for a broomstick sequence
for the first Deathly Hallows film, Daniel

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.789
Radcliffe’s double David Holmes suffered
a serious injury when an explosion knocked

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:59.000
him off the broomstick and onto the ground.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.039
He lost feeling in his legs and had to be
rushed to the hospital.

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:03.039
He was paralyzed from the neck down.

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:07.039
Radcliffe felt awful about the incident and
in the years since has made sure to highlight

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:11.230
Holmes’ contributions to the franchise and
the friendship the two still have.

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.400
Die Hard

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.620
Action movies are known for loud, explosive
set pieces, and that can make things hard

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.209
on the ears while filming.

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.209
During production on the original Die Hard,
Bruce Willis shot a multitude of guns that

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:25.180
had extra loud blanks in them for maximum
effect.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.090
Unfortunately for the actor, he did some serious
damage to his senses and lost two-thirds of

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.629
his hearing in one ear.

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:35.261
Even with that, Willis still loves playing
the character and has returned for all of

00:02:35.261 --> 00:02:36.470
the Die Hard sequels.

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.180
Let’s hope he brought ear plugs for the
follow-ups so this didn’t happen again.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.319
Quantum of Solace

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:46.209
Being James Bond involved getting through
one death-defying day after another, and Daniel

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.879
Craig has seen the brunt of this during his
time as 007.

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:53.709
While filming Quantum of Solace, the actor
suffered a gruesome injury when one of his

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.600
fingertips was sliced off during an action
sequence.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.849
As you’d expect, there was a lot of blood
loss and Craig had to be taken to the hospital

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:02.390
for emergency treatment.

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.659
Fortunately, it wasn’t too severe and Craig
was reportedly back on set later that day

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:08.080
to resume production.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.800
With all the actor’s been through playing
Bond, it’s no wonder he might be ready to

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:12.800
step down.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:13.800
Top Gun

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.340
Tragedy can strike on film sets, and one such
incident happened during principal photography

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.140
on the 1980s action film Top Gun.

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:26.209
The movie is known for its daring fighter
jet sequences and hired professional air stuntman

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.920
Art Scholl to handle the in-flight camera
work.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.659
Scholl was one of the best in the industry,
having performed similar tasks for commercials,

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:35.819
television shows, and other films.

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:40.680
On Top Gun, Scholl did the flat spin move
and was unable to return his plane to normal

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:41.680
position.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.650
He crashed into the Pacific Ocean saying,
“I have a problem.

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.400
I have a real problem.”

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.650
Neither Scholl nor the plane were ever recovered.

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:50.650
Goodfellas

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.269
Violence is a hallmark of Martin Scorsese’s
filmography, and sometimes that goes beyond

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:56.689
what was in the script.

00:03:56.689 --> 00:04:02.069
One scene in Goodfellas depicts Tommy shooting
bartender Spider to death after Spider offends

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:03.069
him.

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:07.389
The actor playing Spider, Michael Imperioli,
broke a hand on a glass while filming and

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:09.400
had to be taken to the emergency room.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.790
While at the hospital, doctors noticed a chest
wound on Imperioli and tried to treat that,

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.220
before the actor explained the entire situation.

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:19.690
Imperioli was then forced to wait three hours
before he was seen again.

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:24.480
The crew had a good laugh about it after the
fact, and Scorsese even shared the story on

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:25.880
The Tonight Show.

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:26.880
Syriana

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.790
This film is living proof that even dramas
can cause serious harm.

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.760
While filming a stunt for Syriana, George
Clooney suffered a spinal injury that left

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:36.540
him stuck in bed for a month.

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.200
He also endured severe migraines during his
recovery.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.350
He couldn’t do publicity for the upcoming
Ocean’s Twelve.

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:47.590
The actor said things got so bad at one point
he considered taking his own life.

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.590
Surgery was eventually required to repair
the damage, and Clooney has been fine ever

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:52.590
since.

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.720
He even took home an Oscar for his role in
Syriana, so in a way, it was all worth it

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:57.720
in the end.

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:58.790
Rocky IV

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:03.350
Sylvester Stallone loves doing his own stunts,
but he may have taken things a bit too far

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:04.730
for this Rocky sequel.

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:08.810
While filming the Italian Stallion’s big
fight with Drago, Stallone and Dolph Lundgren

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:10.420
punched each other for real.

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:14.140
One hit from Sly’s co-star did a considerable
amount of damage.

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:18.510
Stallone felt a burning in his chest, which
was caused by his heart slamming against his

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:23.670
breastbone and swelling up, cutting off his
blood supply and limiting his oxygen intake.

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:28.830
The actor had to remain in intensive care
for several days at a hospital in Santa Monica.

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:33.620
Rocky’s taken some beatings in his time,
but nothing can really compare to what Stallone

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:34.890
has gone through.

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:36.590
Star Wars: The Force Awakens

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:42.080
A big selling point of Episode 7 was the return
of original trilogy stars like Mark Hamill,

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.430
Carrie Fisher, and Harrison Ford.

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:48.500
Of the three, Ford had the meatiest role,
which meant he was involved with some of the

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:49.960
more physical aspects.

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:54.160
During filming, he now famously suffered a
broken leg when the door of the Millennium

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.780
Falcon came crashing down on him.

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:58.970
In an effort to save his actor, director J.J.
Abrams attempted to lift it, and broke his

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:02.630
back – something he wouldn’t reveal publicly
until months later.

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:07.200
Filming was delayed, giving Abrams more time
to iron out the script, which paid off in

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.200
spades.

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:12.160
Those are just some of the instances of when
things went horribly wrong on movie sets.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:13.450
Which ones did we miss?
