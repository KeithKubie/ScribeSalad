rocket science

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.120
Good Afternoon and welcome to the Department of Chemistry, Welcome to the Cambridge Science Festival,

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.200
And Welcome to this lecture on Rocket Science

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.820
Now, every Rocket that has ever flown,

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.480
whether its a small firework rocket,

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.800
or whether its a giant rocket carrying people to the moon

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.120
every rocket is based on one simple principle.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.060
So i thought i'd begin this lecture by demonstrating that principle

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.680
So this a beautiful reproduction, in miniature

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.160
of a Napoleonic Canon. But its a working model

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:09.460
And its actually capable of firing a live round: A Half inch diameter Lead Cannon Ball

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.880
Today we wont fire a live round, but im going to fire a blank round

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.640
and when we do, i want you to observe what happens to the cannon

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.400
Now the cannon's really just a tube thats closed on this end (left side) and open at this end (right side)

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.280
This is called a muzzle

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.580
and theres a small hole we call a "touch hole"

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.680
that we use to transmit fire to the main charge

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.200
So im going to begin by taking a small slow burning fuse

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.280
And placing that in the "touch hole"

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.560
Then were going to charge this with gunpowder

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.260
So the gunpowder is in this nice powder horn

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.000
the way this works is: I put my finger over the brass nozzle, I press the valve and tip it upside down

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.300
And powder trickles into that brass spout

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.140
So I'm measuring a precise quantity of gunpowder

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.520
And I release the valve and turn it upside... right way up again

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.720
and we have a measured quantity of gunpowder in the spout

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.040
So I'll place that into the barrel of the cannon

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.260
and I thought is since its "Science Week" we'll use a double dose

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.600
*audience laughs*

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:14.480
Here's a double dose of gunpowder going into the cannon

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.360
So that's the gunpowder,

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.960
In the barrel; I'll put this safely out of the way

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.500
Now to keep the gunpowder in the barrel and against the fuse

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:28.980
were going to use a bit of wadding

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.140
so this is some fireproof wadding which I'm going to put into the, into the muzzle of the cannon

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:40.340
and then use this "Ram Rod" to pack the wadding and the gunpowder tight up against the fuse.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.000
Now at this point we would put our cannon ball in but were not going to do that today

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.420
so instead, we'll, we'll simulate that by adding a bit more wadding

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.060
so I'm going to put some more wadding into the barrel

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.120
and again just pack that down

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.960
and then finally, to, uh, to stop the ball rolling out, as it were,

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.440
we'd use a bit more wadding. So, why not, lets do a bit more wadding.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.760
*audience laughs*

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.200
It is the science festival after all.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.220
Okay, so we've got this wadding nicely pack down.

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.840
Our cannon, uh will be loaded, and it's now ready to fire.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.200
So I'm going to light the fuse

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.500
from where I'm standing, it's quite noisy, so I'm going to be covering my ears;

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.500
if you're near the front, you may wish to do the same.
