Well you certainly have the dispersal of information.

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.650
You have the retrieval of information.

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.400
You have from our teaching Shakespeare, it's
a godsend.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.210
Because Shakespeare was never meant to be
read.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:28.679
This idea of a teacher handing a book -- Hamlet,
Romeo and Juliet, Julius Caesar to students

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:31.460
-- I can't think of a worse way to treat Shakespeare.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.000
I can't think of a way to turn off students
more.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.910
It's hard to read Shakespeare, but now we
have DVDs.

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.379
So you see it . . . that's what Shakespeare
said.

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:41.680
He didn't write books.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.440
He wrote parts for plays.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.390
He never imagined anyone would read this stuff.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.799
It's like, you know, you coming and asking
me, you know, "I really want a great, great

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:52.799
symphony."

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:53.799
And I say, "Oh my gosh.

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:57.010
I love Beethoven's Seventh ______.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.440
Here's the music.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.440
Go read it."

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:00.440
And you'd say, "Hold on.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.640
I'm supposed to go read this stuff?

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.480
I mean, why not listed to it?"

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.480
Oh no.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.530
Just read it and that'll be fine.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:13.230
So it's the . . . Technology gives you a way
into a lot of the arts that you didn't have

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:14.720
before, and it's wonderful.
