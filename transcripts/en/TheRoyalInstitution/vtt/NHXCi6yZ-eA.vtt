00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.560
Consciousness matters to us.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.360
Arguably it matters more than anything.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.360
Take away the magic of sensations,

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.800
the magic we create, and we'd be smaller
creatures

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.940
living in the duller world. 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:33.040
Yet consciousness is still a scientific
mystery.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.680
Does it mean there are dimensions to the
universe that science

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.390
doesn't understand?

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.060
Or could it all be an illusion?

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.980
We revel in sensations.

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.910
Colours, sounds, tastes can seem unspeakably wonderful,

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.330
but what's really going on?

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:14.940
Inside my head

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.950
my brain is tracking the stimuli that
reach my body's surface.

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.070
This activity is my brain is a purely
physical process

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.479
but my experience of it seems anything but

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.860
purely physical.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.340
And that's the problem.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.260
Let's take the case of pain.

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.320
Suppose I were to prick my thumb,

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.470
my brain would respond to signals with an

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.149
internalised hurt response - what
scientists call

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:57.829
the neural correlate of pain.

00:01:57.829 --> 00:01:59.760
From an objective point of view,

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.790
this paining is nothing more than the
activity of nerve cells,

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.560
but from my inside subjective point of
view

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.430
well, it seems to be nothing less than
conscious pain.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.520
How can this possibly work?

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.030
How can there be physical matter on one side of the equation,

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.160
and non-physical consciousness on the
other?

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.660
The 'explanatory gap', as it has been called,

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.769
drives philosophers crazy. In fact there are a good many who would say that the

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:33.290
physical brain is just the wrong kind of
thing to give rise to consciousness.

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.420
You might as well suggest, it's been said, that numbers emerge from biscuits

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.790
for ethics from rhubarb. 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.830
Now, I have to agree that when they put it like that,

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.340
the sceptics may be right. You can't get
numbers from biscuits

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.090
and you really can't get pain from nerve cells.

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.490
But here's the thing: who said you can? 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.820
Who said you get pain from anything?

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.780
What if the pain I experience

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.340
doesn't really exist at all?

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.320
let's reconsider.

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.950
When I prick my thumb,

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.570
my brain does something physical in
response.

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.690
It creates the neural correlate.

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.530
When I observe this neural
activity from the inside

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.530
it appears to me, in the theatre of my mind,

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.799
that I'm in the presence of a pain sensation.

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:44.620
But that's just it. Appears to me as pain.

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.239
So what's really at issue is not the
reality of pain but the appearance of it

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:54.180
and the question should be not how can
my brain give birth to pain as such,

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.349
but how can it give birth to something so
remarkable

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:02.471
so tricky, perhaps, that it looks to me like pain?

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
That's why I think

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.099
Richard Gregory's real impossible
triangle

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:13.519
provides such a useful analogy.

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:17.690
Note we don't have to explain the
existence of the impossible triangle.

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.880
We only have to explain

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.960
the existence or something that looks like

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.660
an impossible triangle.

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.700
Now with consciousness I admit we're not
nearly there yet,

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.320
we don't know what the actual illusion-generating mechanism is.

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.500
I'm confident that neuroscientists,

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.970
armed with the right questions will soon
be closing in.

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:48.169
Even so, there must be limits to what a neuroscientific explanation

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:51.009
can tell us about the origins of
consciousness.

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:53.849
Though it may explain the 'how',

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:56.760
it can never explain the 'why'.

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.300
And of course an evolutionary psychologist like me

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.520
can't leave it there. Given that
consciousness has evolved

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.610
by natural selection, we have to ask

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:10.639
what the evolutionary advantage is.

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:19.000
Richard Gregory invented this object precisely so as to amaze us.

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:22.630
Why ever should nature have designed us

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:27.650
to amaze ourselves?

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.759
Well, there's an unexpected answer, but it's the answer that

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:41.519
as a scientist I'd put my money on.

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.240
If we want to learn how these remarkable experiences

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:49.210
contribute to biological survival, we need to look at the lives of conscious creatures

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:52.759
in their natural environment, and for
humans

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:56.859
that means especially the world of other people.

00:05:56.859 --> 00:05:59.359
When we survey the social scene

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:03.689
I think the evidence is clear. The chief
benefit of being conscious

00:06:03.689 --> 00:06:08.549
lies in the way it changes people's
psychological profile.

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:13.040
Consciousness feeds our self-worth,

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.360
our joy in life, our fear of death,

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.740
and especially it increases

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:24.610
our respect for the other conscious
beings we live alongside.

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.360
By  placing each one of us

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.870
at the centre of a mystery, consciousness
encourages us

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:38.849
to think of ourselves and others as
spiritual beings,

00:06:38.849 --> 00:06:42.580
and of the world about us as an enchanted
place.

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:45.400
The philosopher Descartes famously said, 

00:06:45.409 --> 00:06:48.979
"I think therefore I am", but the
consciousness

00:06:48.979 --> 00:06:52.870
that has evolved around the magic of sensations is deeper

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:54.870
and more generous than this. I feel therefore

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:57.640
I feel therefore I am.

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:01.940
Therefore you feel and you are too.

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:21.820
If you want to post your questions

in the comment section below, please do
that, 

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:26.969
and we'll come back and try and provide some answers

00:07:26.969 --> 00:07:32.259
in a follow-up video in a few months
time.
