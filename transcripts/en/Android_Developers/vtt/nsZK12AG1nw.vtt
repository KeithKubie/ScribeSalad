Hello, my name is Reto Meier,
and welcome to this week in

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.200
Android development on Monday,
August 12, 2013.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.870
Last week saw designers in the
Bay Area come together to talk

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.270
about designing for Android
surprising the few

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:15.540
cyberneticists who came along
expecting to design an android

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.300
the size and shape of
San Francisco Bay.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.590
The Google Play games services
team were at it once again

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.920
with another episode of Game On
where Todd and Bruno talked

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:24.850
cloud save.

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.380
And J-F showed us how to detect
overdraw using the

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:28.680
hierarchy viewer.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.470
Our design advocates introduced
design bytes with

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.910
Nick demonstrating responsive
design and Roman donning a

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.690
darker, yet still
color-coordinated ensemble, to

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:37.830
explain how you can flatten

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.430
existing icons using Photoshop.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.670
Chet taught us some cartoon
animation techniques while

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.070
remaining oblivious to the
logo-shirt coordination

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.020
requirements.

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.500
And [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.790
Ankur and J-F went backstage
once more to answer questions

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.970
on Ankur's series of DevBytes
on making apps beautiful.

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.130
And this week, J-F will be
talking about optimizing

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.210
layouts with hierarchy viewer
and opening the Australian top

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.130
order for the fifth
Ashes Test.

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:03.170
And tune in for a new face in
dev bytes with a new clip on

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:04.492
image pixelization.

00:01:04.492 --> 00:01:07.310
If you're in Europe, now would
be a great time to plan a

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.080
vacation with Dan Galpin heading
up the games invasion,

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.740
starting with a stop at the
Google Developer group meet up

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.950
in London on the 15th.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.620
That's all for this week
in Android development.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.110
Be sure to check out this week's
dev and design bytes,

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.390
because it just won't
do without you.
