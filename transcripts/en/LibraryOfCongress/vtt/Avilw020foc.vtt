00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:04.770
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.280
&gt;&gt; Ilse Assmann: "And change
will not come if we wait

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.180
for some other person
or some other time.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.910
We are the ones we've
been waiting for.

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.480
We are the change that we seek."

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.880
And that's a quote
from Barack Obama.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.580
I could not think of a
more appropriate quote

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.270
by an equally appropriate person

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.280
to open the 47th Annual
IASA Conference.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.020
That quote, because our theme
for this conference is "A World

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.510 position:56%
of Opportunity, Audiovisual Archives

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.210
and the Digital Landscape,"
which implies change.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.660
And of course President Obama, as
we are in Washington DC on the eve

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.500
of an election that we'll see the
end of his tenure as president

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.790
of the United States, and
history recording his legacy.

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.440
It is also no coincidence
that I quote the US president.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.490
The very building in which the
conference will be taking place

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.600
over the next few days is testimony
to the rich legacy left to us

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.010
by the various presidents
previously of the United States.

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.980
It's an absolute honor for me to
be standing in this building named

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.860
after the fourth president of
the United States James Madison,

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.740
regarded as the father of
the constitution and the last

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.950
of the founding fathers
to serve as president.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.950
Over and above the remarkable
history of the Library of Congress,

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.530
it has been my wish
since I started my career

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.930
as a radio archivist
almost 30 years ago

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.970
to one day visit this institution
that has had such a profound impact

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.740
on the world of libraries
and archives.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.430
A warm welcome to 2016 IASA
Conference, in particular,

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:06.540 position:56%
to our host, David Mao, the deputy
librarian of Congress, Mark Sweeney,

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.570
associate librarian of Library
Services, Betsy Peterson,

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.060
director of American
Folklife Center, Greg Lukow,

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.410
the chief of the Motion
Picture Broadcasting

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.340
and Recorded Sound Division,

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.600
who all actively contributed
towards this conference.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.550
A warm welcome to Andrea
Kalas, president of AMIA

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.520
and also our keynote speaker.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:35.730
It is my privilege to also
extend a very, very warm welcome

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.960
to previous IASA presidents
and honorary members of IASA.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.510
Gerald Gibson, Gerry
Gibson, where are you?

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:52.230
[ Applause ]

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.010
And of course, Dietrich Schuller.

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.310
[ Applause ]

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:56.650
Thank you.

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.510
Thank you.

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.010
[ Applause ]

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.310
We are very grateful that you
made your way, both of you,

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.080
to attend this conference and
to honor us with your presence.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.530
Thank you so much.

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.700
I also wish to thank
the Library of Congress

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.350
and in particular the
newly appointed librarian

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.620
of Congress who's hosting
the conference.

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.660
And as you probably know,
Carla Hayden is the first woman

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:20.970
and first American--

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.530
African American to lead
the Library of Congress.

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.820
I especially wish to thank
the organizing committee,

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:32.890 position:56%
I already did that in our January
assembly, but I wish to do so again,

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:39.350
Judith Gray, Kate Murray, Carl
Fleischhauer, Guha Shankar,

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:44.720
Stephanie Smith, Megan McShea,
Dave Walker, and Gene DeAnna,

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.400
who are staff of both
the Library of Congress

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.120
and the Smithsonian institution.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.970
In addition, this conference
would not have been possible

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:58.130
without the effort of Jarrod
MacNeil and Thea Austen.

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.500
Then, a heartfelt welcome
to all new student members.

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.560
It is a brand new category
of membership with IASA

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.430
and Judith told me that we have
quite a few student members.

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.450
So, thank you for joining and
really welcome to this conference.

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.650 position:56%
May I also just add that we've noted
the many registrations of people

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:22.020
who are not members of IASA as yet
and we really would like for you

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:24.380
to talk to any one of
us if you feel the need

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.310 position:56%
and we really hope you have the need
to join IASA so that we can talk

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:29.610
to you about the benefits

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.680
of becoming an IASA just a
little from the-- from outside.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.820
And that lastly, I really
need to thank our sponsors

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.110 position:56%
for making this conference possible.

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:44.470 position:56%
Memnon, a Sony company, as the
platinum sponsor for the conference,

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.240
NOA and Cube-Tec, who
are both bronze sponsors.

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:53.030
And then also, our exhibiting
sponsors Gecko, Timestep.

00:04:53.030 --> 00:05:00.590
And if I can just read it there--
I can't make it out, I'm sorry.

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:01.890
&gt;&gt; Bert Lyons: George Blood.

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:03.190
&gt;&gt; Ilse Assmann: George Blood.

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:04.490
Thank you so much, Bert.

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.500
And all of this would
not have been possible

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.980
for the generous contribution by
the Library of Congress as well.

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.540
So, thank you very much
to all our sponsors.

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:15.920
As Judith already has
said, the exhibitors are

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:19.180
in the room next door, they
feel kind of lonely there,

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.600
so in your tea time, coffee
time, please go around,

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.810
visit them, and talk to them.

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:28.200
So, the theme of this year's
conference touches deeply

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.840
on the James Truslow
Adams American dream.

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.620
And I've hinted it-- add
that in my presidential

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.730
or that welcoming note
in the program.

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:39.030
That became the symbol

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:41.820
of opportunity, prosperity,
and success.

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.780
The American dream was
achieved through sacrifice,

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.980
risk-taking and hard work.

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:49.380
All being part of the
entrepreneurial spirit

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:52.120
that became synonyms with America.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:57.210 position:56%
Adams in his book, "The Epic of
America," which was written in 1931,

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:00.950
defined the American dream
as that dream of a land

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:05.420
in which life should be better
and richer and fuller for everyone

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:08.620
with opportunity for each
according to their ability

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:11.220
of achievement-- or achievement.

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:14.170
Put one in this sense,
they [inaudible] a parallel

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:18.720
between Adams's American dream
of opportunity and the discovery

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:23.870 position:56%
of recorded sound, images and moving
images, the establishment of radio

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:28.150
and television, and the consequent
inevitable growth of sound

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:30.340
and audiovisual archives.

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:33.500
With every pioneering
development to record images,

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:37.390
sound and moving images, came
new opportunities to preserve

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:40.330
and expose our collections
to the world.

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:44.660
Ensuring that our collections
were meticulously catalogued,

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:48.690
well-preserved and secured in a
physical sense as well as in terms

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:52.690
of the conflicts and tricky
ownership rights associated

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:57.310
with the content was certainly
not without risk and hard work.

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:00.320
I believe that this pattern
of archives being impacted

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:02.980
by new technologies and
maintaining a balance

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:04.830 position:56%
between safeguarding our collections

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:09.100
and making them accessible has
the ingredients of that trend.

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:12.720
We have no choice but
to take note of trends

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:15.490
that are shaping the
future of our world.

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:19.490
Each technological innovation
and the market's response

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:23.660
to the innovations has the makings
of a trend and the potential

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:27.560
to take us forward, or
sadly, in some cases,

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:29.570
put us a step or two back.

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:34.240
How many of us were not forced
to preserve our audio collections

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:36.750
on mini disc to save storage space?

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:41.680
And how many of us had to fight the
preservation, of the preservation,

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:44.850
using MP3 for the same reason?

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:48.950 position:56%
It is a miracle that our collections
sometimes survive this ostensibly

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:52.610
cost and storage reductions
decisions.

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:55.590
Today I say, and I speak
on personal experience,

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:59.440
that IASA was the saving
grace in many instances.

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:02.520
Trends become discernible
overtime and give us an idea

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:07.000
of what's happening in a particular
field at any given point in time.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.270
Trends provide a view of the
future and hints on how to prepare.

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:14.870
As the sci-fi author William
Gibson who coined terms

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:20.680
such as cyberspace already in the
1980s, long before anyone used it,

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:26.100
say, "The future is here already,
it's just not evenly distributed."

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:27.400
Is this not also the case

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:29.560
where audiovisual archives
are now collections

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:31.690
in the digital landscape?

00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:32.990
We are already connected

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:37.710 position:56%
to our global markets even though we
may not have exposed them fully yet,

00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:39.720
or explored them fully yet.

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:43.240
Do we have a choice about not
thinking more entrepreneurial

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:45.130
about our work and the advantages

00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:48.980
and challenges the digital
landscape offers to us?

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:52.410
In occupying this niche
market, we need to be up-to-date

00:08:52.410 --> 00:08:54.140
with the latest technology.

00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:57.410
We need to know what our
constituencies are wanting from us

00:08:57.410 --> 00:09:01.510
and how demands for access to
information affects us in terms

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:03.570
of offerings to our clients.

00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:08.460
An associate directory-- director
of the Reference Department

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:13.860
at the Library of Congress, one
John L. Nolan, when writing a 1961

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:16.180
about the inclusion of
audiovisuals as part

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:18.420
of the library collections noted

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:22.890
that the fast moving technological
changes made projection

00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:26.610
of present trends-- can
I just repeat that --

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:30.610 position:56%
of fast moving technological changes
made prediction of present trends

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:34.140 position:56%
in this area particularly hazardous.

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:36.360
That was in 1961.

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:40.190 position:56%
Acknowledging this-- his postulation
might just have been wishful

00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:41.950
thinking on his part.

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:46.230
Nolan listed the trends then
as, one, greater production

00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:50.500
of audiovisual materials for
educational and recreational use.

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:55.250
According to Nolan, the audiovisual
industry had doubled in the 1950

00:09:55.250 --> 00:10:00.750
to 1960 period and he predicted
a doubling by the end of 1962.

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:03.250
Two, an urgent need
for trained personnel

00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:07.420
to handle the growing volume and
variety of audiovisual materials,

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:09.690
especially training in
the technical aspects

00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:12.210
of handling audiovisual materials.

00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:16.820
But adding that, far more important
will be the need for imagination,

00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:20.370
initiative, and practical
planning in this field.

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:24.030
Three, the expansion of
technological research

00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:28.470
and development to make possible
greater centralization of service,

00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:31.620
greater simplicity in
use, and lower cost.

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:37.180
In other words, automization to
permit a greater degree of use

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:41.310
through self service and
thorough mass service--

00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:43.050
sorry, and through mass service.

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:47.390
Four, the development of more
systematic bibliographic coverage

00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:52.040
and methods of organizing
audiovisual materials for use.

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:56.210 position:56%
Sixty years later, we see that
Nolan had a good grasp of the future

00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:58.490
and opportunities of the time.

00:10:58.490 --> 00:11:02.450
In a recent research
survey done by the OCLC,

00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:04.810
the following trends were observed,

00:11:04.810 --> 00:11:08.170
growth of especially
audiovisual collections,

00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:12.820
growth of online catalogues,
large scale digitization models,

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:17.580
and integration of once
separated special collections.

00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:19.820
We see the phenomenal growth

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:22.970
of audiovisual collections
on a daily basis.

00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:27.350
I do not need to expand on the vast
impact, social media and technology

00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:28.650
such as smartphones

00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:32.680
and sophisticated software
are having on our collections.

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:35.260
With this comes the shift
towards for more faults

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:38.320
and fewer physical holdings,
especially in the case

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:43.080
of born-digital content which of
course has its own challenges.

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:47.340
The current trend to digitize
archived material increases access

00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:51.040
to previously unknown and
unshareable materials,

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:54.030
those hidden collections,
and opens the potential

00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:56.730
for research and educational use.

00:11:56.730 --> 00:11:58.600
In addition, the usage and value

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:02.890
of previously accessible materials
have both increased as a result

00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:05.820
of greater demand for information.

00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:10.110 position:56%
Online catalogues have become a
trend, more secure and sophisticated

00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:13.640
than ever before in making
audiovisual collections available

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:14.940
to users.

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:18.150
It is impossible not
to think about ITN

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:22.460
and its online catalogue
called ITN Source is an example

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:26.150
of a modern online
catalogue containing more

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:30.150
than one million hours of
footage and growing at a rate

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:34.040
of over 20 hours of
digital content per day.

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:37.700
Not only that ITN see the
opportunity to make available

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:42.580
and sell its collection online,
but ITN also partnered with 24

00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:46.030
of the world's most influential
agencies, which includes

00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:50.420
for instance Reuters, and
syndicates its own news footage

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:53.160 position:56%
to other broadcasters and producers.

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:58.120
Since 2005, ITN has been a
shareholder of the Espresso Group

00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:00.780
that provides digital
content to primary schools

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:04.510
in the UK and also international.

00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:09.170
Digitization dictated that we adapt
our cataloguing practices to focus

00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:12.120
on metadata frameworks and
standards and begin thinking

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:16.050
about the semantic web and
the opportunities it offers.

00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:20.170
The generation of metadata is
no longer solely in our domain.

00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:22.100
We are gradually becoming dependent

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:25.020
on metadata generated
by other sources.

00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:30.590
Annemieke de Jong wrote already in
2007 that more and more metadata

00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:35.850
on the materials that we maintain
is being generated away from us,

00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:40.970 position:56%
outside of the archive realm,
outside of our research and control.

00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:44.690
This concerns metadata that
is derived automatically,

00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:48.140
but also metadata that
is put in by humans.

00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:51.820
De Jong predicted that
professional cataloguers may feel

00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:55.110
that these developments will
cause them to lose a bit

00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:58.110
of their expertise
exclusiveness and that they will

00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:02.460
to have share their job, their
expertise with nonexperts.

00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:07.450
They're bound to have to develop a
few more important new focuses too

00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:09.600
like maintaining the
metadata quality

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:13.370
in the production environment doing
quality checks, advocate the use

00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:16.700
of controlled metadata,
help defining the algorithms

00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:19.980
for a user requirement point
of view and still bring

00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:23.870
in the higher semantics,
controlling the information content

00:14:23.870 --> 00:14:27.580
and the context of digital
audiovisual materials.

00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:31.420 position:56%
The recognition though that metadata
is no longer the sole responsibility

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:34.530
of the cataloguer has
brought with it opportunities

00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:39.160
such as crowd sourcing, the
semantic web, automated tagging,

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:42.730
and other mechanisms to
involve the public, collectors,

00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:44.260
and other interest groups.

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:49.470 position:56%
The BBC and our very own organizing
knowledge committee are instrumental

00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:52.400
in further exploring
these opportunities.

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:54.200
The prospects being yielded

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:58.250
by the audiovisual digital
landscape are enormous and allow us

00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:01.590
to create central repositories
and stimulate collaboration

00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:04.930
and corporation within
and across borders

00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:07.170
to preserve and share content.

00:15:07.170 --> 00:15:11.600
Within the broadcasting arena,
there is a greater demand for reuse

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:15.940
and repurposing content
both to save production cost

00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:18.930
and increase revenue
from content sales.

00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:23.250
We need to explore the training
demands because as Nolan observed,

00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:26.040
there is still an urgent
need for trained archivists

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:30.810
to handle the growing volume and
variety of audiovisual materials.

00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:34.320
This potential for partnerships
with commercial entities,

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:39.830
a concept once frowned about
upon but with modern day reality.

00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:45.820
To realize these opportunities
may require remote access 24/7/365

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:49.450
to meet our users' demand for
instant access to our collections.

00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:53.480
This in turn implies building
comprehensive metadata resources

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:57.750
and optimizing the audiovisual
resources for search and discovery

00:15:57.750 --> 00:16:02.670
and will require investigations of
encrypted media, secure websites,

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:05.350
ethics, and many more aspects.

00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:09.040
Do we actually understand the
stronghand that we've been dealt

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:12.910
with as Peter Kaufmann
so aptly argued

00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:16.910
in his paper assessing the
audiovisual archive market?

00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:20.390
Do we understand that our
collections have become sought

00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:23.240
after assets whether we want

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:27.220
to generate revenue or
provide it for free?

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:30.600
The ball so to speak
is in our hands.

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:35.070
Focal International had the
following to say, our finding show

00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:37.720
that the trade-in archives
is an important part

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:41.140
of the widened media
economy with content supplied

00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:45.700
by archives appearing in an
ever-increasing range of outlets.

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:48.100
The growing variety
consumer platforms

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:51.790
for accessing short form
long tail content means

00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:56.200
that this key role will
only grow in importance.

00:16:56.200 --> 00:17:01.000
Do we still experience our
archives full of stuffy old clips

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.460
of obscure events only to be found

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:08.050
in the off-chance or
wanted once-off?

00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:14.450 position:56%
Our archives have inherent potential
to become dynamic businesses.

00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:18.080
While the digital content
economy has created an environment

00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:20.150
of user-generated content

00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:24.630
and the online consumers challenge
our instinct to create revenue to--

00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:29.120
for ourselves with the expectation
that media content should be mostly

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:33.600
for free, archives enjoying growing
demand from businesses as well

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:36.630
as the public or the wider public.

00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:41.730
It is vital for us to be proactive
in defining the future role

00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:44.980
of the archives as
curators of content.

00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:48.620
We have new channels
for content distribution

00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:51.100
for instance YouTube and Instagram.

00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:54.580
We have the opportunity to
engage with new user groups.

00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:57.960
We have options in exploring
technologies to enrich

00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:00.600
and optimize work processes
and to allow

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:03.890
for creative ways to
access collections.

00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:08.950
A culture of innovation, an
entrepreneurial thinking is vital

00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:13.150
for exploring the possibilities
of corporation with our schools,

00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:17.150
our universities, our
communities, our broadcasters

00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:20.320
because as Johan Ullman
[assumed spelling] had observed,

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:22.090
for the first time, our archives

00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:26.870
and our users are sharing
the same information space.

00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:31.190 position:56%
In closing, I want to quote John
Hawking, assistant secretary-general

00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:34.030
of the UN, who recently
delivered the keynote address

00:18:34.030 --> 00:18:36.930
at the ICI Congress in Korea.

00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:40.270
"Our collections connect
past and future,

00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:44.020
problems to solutions
and people with people.

00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:48.070
Archives do not just
document an explorable past,

00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:53.070
but they are a cherished heritage
to build a more resilient future."

00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:58.150
I wish you a very, very successful
conference, connecting with friends

00:18:58.150 --> 00:19:01.540
and colleagues and
exploring the opportunities

00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:03.350
that may benefit your archive.

00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:08.020
I have no doubt that you will
find value in this conference.

00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:09.820
Welcome.

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:25.050
[ Applause ]

00:19:25.050 --> 00:19:26.600
Thank you.

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:31.360
It is now my pleasure to welcome
up to the podium, David Mao,

00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:35.140
who has been for the past year
very capable acting Librarian

00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:36.440
of Congress.

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:38.980
During the course of the past
few days, we've heard so much

00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:42.840
about you David and
on the appreciation

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:45.140
for your leadership
in the interim period.

00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:48.510
So, it's my pleasure to
welcome you up to the podium.

00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:58.370
[ Applause ]

00:19:58.370 --> 00:20:02.430
&gt;&gt; David Mao: Thank you very much
for that very generous thank you

00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:04.670
and introduction of my tenure year.

00:20:04.670 --> 00:20:07.540
As you may know, I am
honored to be serving

00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:09.400 position:56%
as the deputy Librarian of Congress.

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:12.060
We do have a new librarian,
a 14th Librarian of Congress,

00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:15.550
Dr. Carla Hayden who has
sworn in just two weeks ago.

00:20:15.550 --> 00:20:18.490
So on behalf of her and really
the entire Library of Congress,

00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:21.880
I want to welcome all of you
to the Library of Congress

00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:24.970
for this I'm told the
47th annual meeting

00:20:24.970 --> 00:20:26.730
of the International
Association of Sound

00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:30.030
and Audiovisual Archives or IASA.

00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:33.470
I also want to especially welcome
your president, Ilse Assmann,

00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:36.600
who I probably-- I'm thinking is
probably traveled the farthest

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:38.150
to join us here.

00:20:38.150 --> 00:20:41.280
And I'm very glad that after--
I didn't quite do the math,

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:43.320
was it 30 years that you
finally are able to come

00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:45.590
and visit the Library of Congress.

00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:49.170
And on that, I want to ask, how
many-- for how many of you here,

00:20:49.170 --> 00:20:51.490
is this the first visit to
the Library of Congress?

00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:53.300
And I see many of my
colleagues and former colleagues

00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:55.040
from the library here is
that they don't count.

00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:57.900
Everybody else who-- how many
of you this is the first visit

00:20:57.900 --> 00:21:00.410
to the Library of Congress?

00:21:00.410 --> 00:21:04.250
Wow, that's actually
most of the room.

00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:08.130
And I'm delighted for one because
you are visiting the Library

00:21:08.130 --> 00:21:10.550
of Congress at this
transitional moment for us.

00:21:10.550 --> 00:21:14.580
I'm a little surprised though given
the long history that IASA has had

00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:18.100
with the Library of
Congress, the first president

00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:22.730
of the association being a staff
member here and then a president

00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:25.660
in the 1990s, also a staff member.

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:28.050
And then 25 years later,
we of course have several

00:21:28.050 --> 00:21:29.720
of our staff here who
are serving, Judith,

00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:31.640
you heard from at the
very beginning.

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:37.490
So with that long connection to
the library, I had hoped that many

00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:38.790
of you had been here before.

00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:42.700
But I'm just as delighted that you
are here now for the conference.

00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:45.740
I just want to-- A few quick
remarks, we like to think

00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:47.810
of this library as a
temple of learning.

00:21:47.810 --> 00:21:50.650 position:56%
And for those of you who may have
not, and obviously many of you not--

00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:53.200
have not been here, gone
to the Jefferson Building

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:56.590
across the street, you will
see how beautiful it is.

00:21:56.590 --> 00:22:01.110
We like to think-- If you see the
dome here in the picture here,

00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:03.880
we like to think of it as one of
the most beautiful buildings in all

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:07.890
of Washington D.C., and it
really is a temple to learning.

00:22:07.890 --> 00:22:12.740
But within that temple, there are
several shrines, as we like to say,

00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:16.060
dedicated to sound and
audiovisual recordings.

00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:17.960
And you know them very well.

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:19.590
Our Motion Pictures Broadcasting

00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:23.920 position:56%
and Recorded Sound Division is among
the world's premiere collections

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:27.000
in sound and audiovisual materials.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.900
We also have the library's American
Folklife Center which is helping

00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:33.040
to co-sponsor this event.

00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:37.070
And the AFC as we like to call it
has one of the largest archives

00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:39.170
in the world of ethnographic sounds

00:22:39.170 --> 00:22:43.720
and AV recordings including
the earliest known examples

00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:47.130
on wax cylinders which
is truly phenomenal.

00:22:47.130 --> 00:22:50.470
So, we're very proud here at the
library of both of these divisions.

00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:52.350
We're also very proud
of our Packard Campus.

00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:55.590
I see Greg sitting
here-- over on the side.

00:22:55.590 --> 00:23:00.180
And for those of you who might have
the opportunity later this week,

00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:03.600
I hope you will enjoy
that visit there.

00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:04.900
It's more formally known

00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:07.140
as the National Audio-Visual
Conservation Center.

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:10.270
And it really is a
spectacular facility.

00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:12.830
So, I hope you enjoy that visit.

00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:15.450
So, we have these wonderful
divisions.

00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:18.910
You know that we like to
preserve sound recordings here

00:23:18.910 --> 00:23:20.210
at the Library of Congress.

00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:22.770
And I'd like to say that we do--
sound recordings, I'm sorry,

00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:24.610
sound recordings and
audiovisual materials.

00:23:24.610 --> 00:23:28.200
And I'd like to say that we do
a pretty good job at doing that.

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:30.350
We have a couple of
other opportunities here.

00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:32.900
The National Sound
Recording Registry,

00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:36.830
the National Film Registry, both
of which that I had the privilege

00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:41.670
of adding materials to during
my time as acting librarian.

00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:43.830
And it was really a thrill
and I'm glad that we get to do

00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:46.360
that here at the library.

00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:48.660
But we are the Library of Congress.

00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:53.320
So, we have a few other things,
books at the library in fact.

00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:55.390
So, we have books.

00:23:55.390 --> 00:23:57.300
We have physical objects.

00:23:57.300 --> 00:24:00.260
We have lots of materials,
many of which are on display

00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:02.100
over on our Jefferson Building.

00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:04.950
I hope you'll take the opportunity
to explore some of our exhibits,

00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:08.330
see our beautiful building, take
a look at some of our materials.

00:24:08.330 --> 00:24:11.790
They're just a drop in
the bucket really of one

00:24:11.790 --> 00:24:13.740
of the greatest collections
in the world,

00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:16.510 position:56%
162 million items in our collection.

00:24:16.510 --> 00:24:19.850
And so during your time here,
you will be spending a lot

00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:23.200
of time learning about the best
possible way to move forward

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:25.480
as an organization in
this particular format.

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:27.930
But I hope you will explore
some of the other things we have

00:24:27.930 --> 00:24:31.210
to offer here at the library
and that you will be inspired

00:24:31.210 --> 00:24:37.070
to come back and visit us more and
more whether be in person or really

00:24:37.070 --> 00:24:41.290
through our internet collections
and that you can take this

00:24:41.290 --> 00:24:43.010
and tell everybody
around the world about it.

00:24:43.010 --> 00:24:45.400
So again, welcome on
behalf of the library

00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:46.700
and enjoy your conference here.

00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:48.500
Thank you.

00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:54.380
[ Applause ]

00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:57.570
I believe these are for Dr. Hayden,

00:24:57.570 --> 00:24:59.470
and I will make sure
they get to them.

00:24:59.470 --> 00:25:02.910
She, as I said, just started
and has very full schedule,

00:25:02.910 --> 00:25:06.100
apologize she couldn't be
here to welcome you formally.

00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:07.400
&gt;&gt; Ilse Assmann: Something for you.

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:09.300
It's just a little
something from South Africa.

00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:10.600
&gt;&gt; David Mao: Thank you.

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:11.900
Thank you very much.

00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:14.200
&gt;&gt; Ilse Assmann: Thank you so much.

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:23.140
It's now my privilege to
introduce Andrea Kalas to you.

00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:25.630
She's currently the
president of AMIA.

00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:29.090
And can I just add, it's the
second time she's president.

00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:32.020
And I think-- As I said to
you earlier this morning,

00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:36.350
I think it says a lot about her
and it says a lot about AMIA,

00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:39.520
about AMIA that they wanted
her back and about her

00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:42.010
that she's willing to
do it a second time.

00:25:42.010 --> 00:25:43.310
[ Laughter ]

00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:46.800
I think it speaks of
strength of character.

00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:49.270
But she's also the vice
president of the Archives

00:25:49.270 --> 00:25:52.960
of the Paramount Pictures since
2009 and has worked as head

00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:55.110
of preservation at
the British Library--

00:25:55.110 --> 00:25:59.640
sorry, British Film Institute,
created in co-production,

00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:03.290
digital archiving systems
for Discovery Communications,

00:26:03.290 --> 00:26:06.090
built an archive from
scratch at the Dreamworks SKG

00:26:06.090 --> 00:26:11.850
and preserved new reels at the
UCLA Film and Television Archive.

00:26:11.850 --> 00:26:15.460
She also holds a master's
from the UCLA in film history.

00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:20.630
I don't have to say anything
further about Andrea's experience

00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:24.340
in preserving film and
about her opportunity,

00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:26.860
the opportunities that
she saw there.

00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:30.560 position:56%
She's well-known for the
preservation work, and is well-known

00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:34.630
as being visionary in our
outlook of today's archives.

00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:39.640
So her paper today, "Move into the
Middle, Digital Archiving 2016",

00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:41.940
I'm sure will set the
tone for this conference.

00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:44.430
Andrea, welcome.

00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:46.850
[ Applause ]

00:26:46.850 --> 00:26:48.810
&gt;&gt; Andrea Kalas: Thank you
so much for having me Ilse.

00:26:48.810 --> 00:26:53.110
And thank you so much all
of you for allowing me

00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:55.690
to address you here today.

00:26:55.690 --> 00:26:59.160
I see a few familiar faces
out there from AMIA and some

00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:01.140
of the organizations I've
been privileged to work

00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:03.670
with over the years including
the Library of Congress.

00:27:03.670 --> 00:27:05.670
Thank you for hosting this as well.

00:27:05.670 --> 00:27:10.640
I really appreciate the
opportunity to be here

00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:13.830
to represent the Association
of Moving Image Archivists

00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:16.610
which I will talk about
in a minute or two.

00:27:16.610 --> 00:27:20.450
But really, I'm here as myself,
as a person who's been involved

00:27:20.450 --> 00:27:22.260
with archiving over the years.

00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:26.200
So, I do want to take
the opportunity

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:29.260
to plug our little
organization, the Association

00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:30.990
of Moving Image Archivists.

00:27:30.990 --> 00:27:36.450
What I'm showing you are a set of
gifts that we've created recently

00:27:36.450 --> 00:27:39.060
to just sort of explain
I think as visually

00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:42.120
as we can what the Association of
Moving Image Archivists really is.

00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:47.450 position:56%
And what you're seeing is one of our
members with some of the collections

00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:52.230
that she looks after, one of-- this
is actually a home movie collection

00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:54.410
from a very prominent
African-American

00:27:54.410 --> 00:27:56.500
who donated his materials to UCLA.

00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:59.540
And you see him here
talking with Lena Horne.

00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:03.270
That's one kind of
archivist and her collection.

00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:06.720
Another is Angela Schmidt
from the Alaska Film Archives

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:11.320
and some silent documentary
footage she looks after.

00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:15.710 position:56%
The Bay Area TV Archive, and Alex
Cherian has an incredible collection

00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:18.600
of some of the Black
Power movements materials.

00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:26.080
Ted from Coca-Cola has done
an enormous amount of work

00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:28.840
with actually caring for
all of the commercials

00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:32.440
that Coca-Cola has
made over the years.

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:37.090
Or Brent from NYU who also looks

00:28:37.090 --> 00:28:42.050
after some really amazingly
powerful material news footage of--

00:28:42.050 --> 00:28:44.150
so the early AIDS movement.

00:28:44.150 --> 00:28:49.870
And this someone I worked
with, Miki, who actually had

00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:53.630
to do some really forensic work
to actually restore the images

00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:57.080
that were on LTO tapes that
were previously unrestorable

00:28:57.080 --> 00:29:00.190
until she came into the picture.

00:29:00.190 --> 00:29:05.740
So, our big event is coming up in
November, our annual conference.

00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:10.080
If you've never been to an
AMIA conference, I welcome you

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:12.590
and encourage you to come.

00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:18.010
There's an enormous of different
kinds of people as you saw

00:29:18.010 --> 00:29:22.080
from the gifts that
come to that conference.

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:25.540
And we have screenings
and presentations

00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:30.360
and committee meetings, all sorts
of fun to be had by all archivists.

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:31.660
So, I appreciate.

00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:33.840
We also do something
called the Reel Thing.

00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:38.010 position:56%
We do it at the conference and we
do it several times during the year.

00:29:38.010 --> 00:29:43.290 position:56%
It's basically a really well-curated
presentation of sort of the latest

00:29:43.290 --> 00:29:46.520
and greatest in a lot
of film restoration,

00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:50.610
but also archival technology
dealing with moving images.

00:29:50.610 --> 00:29:53.680
Michael Friend and
Grover Crisp who were both

00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:57.880
at Sony Pictures have been doing
this for 20 years, I believe,

00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:00.340
an amazing contribution
to the field really.

00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:03.160
So if you can find what
are those near you--

00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:06.170
I think there's one in
Amsterdam actually, next year.

00:30:06.170 --> 00:30:10.090
So, we also do something
called Digital Asset Symposium.

00:30:10.090 --> 00:30:12.490
We've been doing this for like
the last three or four years.

00:30:12.490 --> 00:30:13.960
We had one in New York.

00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:17.640
Last May-- We'll do another
one in May in New York again.

00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:20.240
We're hoping to do one
in Los Angeles as well.

00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:25.720
It's a focused day-long single
session discussion, really,

00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:29.680
of what people are doing
with different systems

00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:32.630
of digital asset management
and what all those things

00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:34.070
that that might mean.

00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:39.330
And they've been really, really
fruitful in exploring lots

00:30:39.330 --> 00:30:44.590
of different things, within sort
of-- the entertainment world,

00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:46.970
but outside of that as
well, from all sorts of--

00:30:46.970 --> 00:30:48.440
because all sorts of
people of course have

00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:50.170
to deal with moving images.

00:30:50.170 --> 00:30:54.200
And then, we also just recently
had a projection workshop

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:59.620
for those theaters that still
project 35-millimeter film and want

00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:03.940
to make sure that they're taking
care of those as well as possible.

00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:08.090
We worked with Kodak and the Film
Foundation and the Alamo Drafthouse

00:31:08.090 --> 00:31:13.020 position:56%
to sponsor this three-day long
conference where projection has came

00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:14.840
in and figured out how to make sure

00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:19.990
that the last few remaining
35-millimeter prints we have are

00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:21.750
cared for well.

00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:25.960
So, thank you for letting
me plug AMIA.

00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:29.860
Thank you very much.

00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:32.760
So, "Move into the
Middle," you know,

00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:34.220
it may not be the best title ever.

00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:40.560
But I think-- what I was trying to
really get at by saying that was

00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:44.430
that I think the archivists
right now are in the middle,

00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:47.100
whether we like it or
not, between sort of--

00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:50.640
what I see is the maturation of
both technology and knowledge

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:55.290
about technology, and the
fragility of the artifacts

00:31:55.290 --> 00:31:57.690
that we are increasingly
have to care for,

00:31:57.690 --> 00:32:00.700
especially the digitally born ones.

00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:04.570
And, you know, that's-- what you
see there is Billy Wilder looking

00:32:04.570 --> 00:32:08.520
out of the porthole on the
set of Sunset Boulevard.

00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:12.030
And I just love this photo because
he's directing the movie and

00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:15.430
yet he looks like he's sort
of been left out of there.

00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:17.980
And so, that's sort of a way--

00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:22.480
sort of metaphor for sometimes
how I feel as an archivist.

00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:24.940
It's my job, it's my
responsibility, it's my head,

00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:27.120
it's my, you know, stops with me.

00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:28.600
But sometimes, I have to just sort

00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:32.310
of watch it happen before
me at the same time.

00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:34.560
You know, this film,
Sunset Boulevard,

00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:37.250
is one of the reasons I'm
definitely an archivist

00:32:37.250 --> 00:32:41.930
of Paramount Pictures now and
probably a film archivist at all.

00:32:41.930 --> 00:32:46.460
And it's-- You know, and we had
the chance to restore that film.

00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:51.010 position:56%
And it was actually the Library of
Congress that had an original print,

00:32:51.010 --> 00:32:56.410 position:56%
vintage print, that we borrowed that
was critical to that restoration.

00:32:56.410 --> 00:32:58.180
So, I have to thank you for that

00:32:58.180 --> 00:33:00.470
because it was an amazing
part of that.

00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:04.740
But throughout the years whether
I've been preserving newsreels

00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:10.320
on 35-millimeter early stages of
my career UCLA Film and TV Archive

00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:15.680
or when I moved on to try to make
research easier at the Research

00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:19.360
And Study Center at the UCLA
Film and TV Archive by collecting

00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:23.400
up closed caption texts
from television,

00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:29.790
news shows into a really early
database, whether I had to figure

00:33:29.790 --> 00:33:33.790 position:56%
out how-- before, there was really
much bandwidth at all with discovery

00:33:33.790 --> 00:33:38.110
to bring footage electronically
back to headquarters

00:33:38.110 --> 00:33:40.790 position:56%
from the far stretches of the world.

00:33:40.790 --> 00:33:47.630
Or now, we're really focused within
Paramount Pictures on the concept

00:33:47.630 --> 00:33:50.800
of digitally-preserving
feature films.

00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:55.030
I've always seen technology
through the lens of archiving

00:33:55.030 --> 00:33:57.620
of preservation of access.

00:33:57.620 --> 00:34:04.150
And I think that right now,
I feel within the world

00:34:04.150 --> 00:34:07.530
of digital archiving,
we're-- really, we're in.

00:34:07.530 --> 00:34:09.420
We're 20 to 30 years in.

00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:10.820
It's not new anymore.

00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:14.920
It's not-- We're not scratching
our heads wondering how we're going

00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:16.520
to digitize.

00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:17.820
We're there.

00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:19.120
We are doing it everyday.

00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:22.410
And so, it just-- it seems
to me it's important to sort

00:34:22.410 --> 00:34:25.480
of think what does that mean
now that we are in it really.

00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:27.550
We are here 20, 30 years in.

00:34:27.550 --> 00:34:29.840
What's our role?

00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:32.380
What's our responsibility?

00:34:33.670 --> 00:34:38.370
So, here are two sort of divergent
concepts of a digital archive.

00:34:38.370 --> 00:34:42.090
On the top is the definition
that comes from OAIS.

00:34:42.090 --> 00:34:44.450
"Consisting of an organization
of people and systems

00:34:44.450 --> 00:34:46.700
that accepted the responsibility
to preserve information

00:34:46.700 --> 00:34:50.330
and make it available for
a designated community."

00:34:50.330 --> 00:34:53.970
A useful definition, a very useful
definition, especially I think

00:34:53.970 --> 00:34:57.710
when with the concept of
people and systems together,

00:34:57.710 --> 00:34:59.010
it's a really important one.

00:34:59.010 --> 00:35:02.460
I think that a lot of
people sometimes forget,

00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:05.270
it's as if the technology
works by itself.

00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:12.830
And the other is a recently
available online cloud-based thing

00:35:12.830 --> 00:35:17.340 position:56%
that you can put your digitally-born
materials that you've shot yourself

00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:22.240
into something that's called
a digital video archive, DVA.

00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:27.550
So, two very different ideas
of what a digital archive is.

00:35:27.550 --> 00:35:35.090
One that is-- you know, just the
beginning of different standards

00:35:35.090 --> 00:35:39.960
and ways of actually approaching a
really structured way of thinking

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:43.460
about preserving and providing
access to important materials.

00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:48.810
And the other is really kind of
a shelf that hopefully will be

00:35:48.810 --> 00:35:50.110
around for a little while.

00:35:50.110 --> 00:35:51.410
We don't know.

00:35:51.410 --> 00:35:52.710
This is a startup company.

00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:55.090
You know, it's been around I think
for maybe six months, you know,

00:35:55.090 --> 00:35:57.340
what it will be in the future.

00:35:57.340 --> 00:36:01.660 position:56%
So, it's a-- I think it's an
important thing to show that this is

00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:04.140
where we are in the world where
lots of people are thinking

00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:07.610
about these definitions
in different ways.

00:36:07.610 --> 00:36:12.490
This is kind of what
our archive looks

00:36:12.490 --> 00:36:15.470
like at Paramount a little bit.

00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:22.570
It's a-- This is a way that
we have to think in order

00:36:22.570 --> 00:36:27.160
to really strongly think about
the technical metadata really

00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:30.290
that we need to do-- to have
to manage the feature films

00:36:30.290 --> 00:36:32.200
within our own infrastructure.

00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:35.920
And the below text is just all
sorts of words that go flying

00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:38.480
around the office pretty
much everyday.

00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:45.510
But, as you can see, this kind
of very strong structuring

00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:51.740
of our basic file naming convention
is really what all this is, is--

00:36:51.740 --> 00:36:57.370
has to take into what
the title of the film is,

00:36:57.370 --> 00:37:01.460
what's the current aspect ratio
of this is, whether it's--

00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:05.760 position:56%
was cut for a particular
territory, and even actually was cut

00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:09.340
for a ratings reason or not.

00:37:09.340 --> 00:37:12.460
What resolution is it, where
did it come from, you know,

00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:14.720
where was it created,
which is an important part

00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:16.350
of the process as well.

00:37:16.350 --> 00:37:24.540 position:56%
And I know that this kind of intense
work to systematize, to really think

00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:28.790
about how our assets working
systems is incredibly important

00:37:28.790 --> 00:37:31.250
because we need to
work with technology.

00:37:31.250 --> 00:37:35.080
But within the OAIS definition,
the other definitely part

00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:38.360
of this equation is the great
people that I work with everyday,

00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:43.540
the amazing people that challenge
each other constantly when we come

00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:47.820
up with a new definition
for talking about things.

00:37:47.820 --> 00:37:52.170
When-- You know, somebody who has
had a lot of system experience

00:37:52.170 --> 00:37:54.540
but not much photochemical
experience

00:37:54.540 --> 00:37:59.230
for example will really push on
someone to say, why do you need

00:37:59.230 --> 00:38:03.720
to call that black and white
interpositive fine grain, really?

00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:06.030
Or is anybody going to know
what that means in the future?

00:38:06.030 --> 00:38:07.920
And the arguments that
will go on there forever?

00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:12.690
We work really hard to think about
not only the technical metadata

00:38:12.690 --> 00:38:15.290
that we do, but the content
that we're preserving

00:38:15.290 --> 00:38:17.490
and how we're preserving that
and making that effective.

00:38:17.490 --> 00:38:22.090
So, that's an important
part of who we are.

00:38:22.090 --> 00:38:27.790
You know, as we are 20, 30 years
in, I think the default perceptions

00:38:27.790 --> 00:38:30.950
of archivist still
exist outside of us

00:38:30.950 --> 00:38:33.460
and maybe inside of
us sometimes too.

00:38:33.460 --> 00:38:39.440
And it's difficult not to
sometimes when we're to be to not--

00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:43.350
to be forward-thinking when
we're dealing with, you know,

00:38:43.350 --> 00:38:48.410
backlogs with subcategories
of backlogs as I have myself

00:38:48.410 --> 00:38:52.660
and deterioration issues,
legacy systems

00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:56.570
that will not probably become
anything other than legacy systems

00:38:56.570 --> 00:39:01.170
for years to come, but have to
be integrated into your latest

00:39:01.170 --> 00:39:05.540 position:56%
and greatest digital infrastructure,
budget justifications

00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:10.230
and endless PowerPoints to try
and explain what the risk is

00:39:10.230 --> 00:39:12.150
if you don't do something now.

00:39:12.150 --> 00:39:14.260
It's hard to be forward-thinking
with all

00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:15.740
that around us all the time.

00:39:15.740 --> 00:39:20.790
And it's even more hard when-- this
quote was from a recent article

00:39:20.790 --> 00:39:25.630
on digital asset management which
really compares us to coal miners.

00:39:25.630 --> 00:39:28.850
Thank you very much.

00:39:28.850 --> 00:39:32.020
[laughter] So, you know,
it is hard to move beyond

00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:34.940
that perception and
keep that in mind.

00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:37.160
But, you know, I kind of
think that's OK anyway

00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:41.010
because that is part of who we are.

00:39:41.010 --> 00:39:45.270
So, you know, mass digitization,
a huge impact obviously

00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:48.740 position:56%
on anybody that's calling themselves
a librarian or an archivist.

00:39:48.740 --> 00:39:51.630
A hundred million books, over a 100
million books have been digitized.

00:39:51.630 --> 00:39:55.100
I think-- And maybe that somebody--

00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:59.130
oh no, there's no more book
people in the room anymore.

00:39:59.130 --> 00:40:00.800
But I believe and I just--

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:02.850
Please correct me if anybody
knows this is right or wrong.

00:40:02.850 --> 00:40:08.020
I think every book before
1800 is now been digitized,

00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:10.630
something like that.

00:40:10.630 --> 00:40:13.460
And these are publicly-searched--
is that right?

00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:14.760
Is that wrong?

00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:16.060
Somebody say something?

00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:18.330
By the way, anytime anybody wants
to interrupt me and correct me

00:40:18.330 --> 00:40:20.460
or ask me questions, you're
more than welcome to--

00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:22.520
I don't have to just keep talking.

00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:26.560
But-- And the whole idea is

00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:28.940
to make these things
publicly-searchable online.

00:40:28.940 --> 00:40:30.620
That is the idea of
the digitization.

00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:33.340
And that is fantastic.

00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:34.640
It is amazing.

00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:37.130
It has made things-- It has
made people be able to do

00:40:37.130 --> 00:40:41.310
so much more kinds of research
all over the world and be able

00:40:41.310 --> 00:40:45.490
to really, you know, sort
of do things from distances

00:40:45.490 --> 00:40:47.750
that they were never
able to do before.

00:40:47.750 --> 00:40:50.580
I mean, that kind of
access is incredible.

00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:58.430
And within moving images, you know,
within a very short time, you know,

00:40:58.430 --> 00:41:04.550
I went from saying things like, you
know, one day, we'll be able to go

00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:09.830
on the internet and we'll be able
to actually like click on something

00:41:09.830 --> 00:41:14.400
and watch and listen at the
same time to actually being able

00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:17.410
to manage that and having
that be a major part

00:41:17.410 --> 00:41:21.440
of what Paramount Pictures does
everyday is to move our content

00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:25.660
on to be streamed all
over the world.

00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:29.520
This quote here, "Update,
cat bombs more prevalent

00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:34.710
than previously thought" which
I just loved, is from an article

00:41:34.710 --> 00:41:41.980
from the Atlantic, a guy who
writes a lot about technology

00:41:41.980 --> 00:41:50.760
who had picked up on a researcher's
paper on the fact that there was

00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:57.620
in fact in this 16th century
manuscript what looked like a cat

00:41:57.620 --> 00:42:01.740
with a bomb on its back,
and actually had found more

00:42:01.740 --> 00:42:05.420
than one cat with a
bomb on its back.

00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:08.690
And to me, it just
sort of articulates it.

00:42:08.690 --> 00:42:10.360 position:56%
Yeah, we have all this stuff online.

00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:12.230
We have researchers
looking into this stuff.

00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:16.120
But we also have, you know,
the clickbait universe as well

00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:18.550
who is going to pick up on this

00:42:18.550 --> 00:42:22.320
and maybe trivialize what was a
really important piece of research

00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:25.780
or maybe talk about this in
ways that had nothing to do

00:42:25.780 --> 00:42:31.760
with what the original, you know,
fundraising proposal said about,

00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:34.900 position:56%
you know, scanning these manuscripts
and how critical they were.

00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:36.200
But that exists.

00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:37.650
And that's part of our world now.

00:42:37.650 --> 00:42:39.350
We can't go back from it.

00:42:39.350 --> 00:42:42.080
Maybe we will mature
beyond clickbait land.

00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:43.380
That would be lovely.

00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:44.880
I would love to think
about a world, what we did.

00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:47.540
Maybe this is just a transition
we're going through right now.

00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:50.110
But it's here, and it's
part of what happens

00:42:50.110 --> 00:42:52.810
when we make things
accessible on out there.

00:42:52.810 --> 00:42:56.980
You know, and the other
thing I think that happens

00:42:56.980 --> 00:42:59.630
when we digitize things
whether it's books

00:42:59.630 --> 00:43:01.340
or whether it's moving images is

00:43:01.340 --> 00:43:05.130
that they're not what
they used to be anymore.

00:43:05.130 --> 00:43:09.200
I mean, even though the content
is there, the way that we work

00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:15.340
with them is-- you know,
is-- does obviously change.

00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:19.610
We-- If we are providing
access to moving images online,

00:43:19.610 --> 00:43:24.410
we don't necessarily have to have
several different flatbed editors

00:43:24.410 --> 00:43:26.360
for which we can playback
16-millimeter

00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:30.440
and 35-millimeter prints if those
things are available online.

00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:32.840
So, that skill and that
understanding of how

00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:34.870
that works is going to change.

00:43:34.870 --> 00:43:36.670
I mean obviously, as we look--

00:43:36.670 --> 00:43:39.350
if you look at any kind of
job descriptions that are

00:43:39.350 --> 00:43:44.380
out there today, coding, knowing
some kind of Python scripting

00:43:44.380 --> 00:43:46.820
or other kind of scripting
is a regular part

00:43:46.820 --> 00:43:49.240
of a digital archivist
job description now.

00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:50.670
That wasn't around anymore.

00:43:50.670 --> 00:43:52.580
Our jobs are changing.

00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:54.650
That's part of what we're doing.

00:43:54.650 --> 00:43:58.200
And so, just trying
to think of that,

00:43:58.200 --> 00:44:02.870
the content without the
technology that surrounds it is--

00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:04.170
we can't just do it anymore.

00:44:04.170 --> 00:44:05.950
It's just-- It's here.

00:44:05.950 --> 00:44:13.120
But within that, I think, you know,
what's also happening is, you know,

00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:16.070
we do have some really
incredibly deep

00:44:16.070 --> 00:44:18.680
and useful skills as archivists.

00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:21.810
And we need not-- we need
to remember that always.

00:44:21.810 --> 00:44:29.240
You know, I think this little quote
here is another recent article on,

00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:33.140 position:56%
you know, data mining, big data,
data science, call it what you will.

00:44:33.140 --> 00:44:37.450
And this concept of "dark
data" which I just love

00:44:37.450 --> 00:44:42.660
which is roughly translated
I think, unstructured data.

00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:46.180
And what they're really saying--

00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:48.610
what they were saying in
this article is that, hey,

00:44:48.610 --> 00:44:51.180 position:56%
this metadata thing might be useful.

00:44:51.180 --> 00:44:54.410
That there might be
something to that,

00:44:54.410 --> 00:44:57.010
actually having some
structured data in there.

00:44:57.010 --> 00:44:58.880 position:56%
And they're actually talking about--

00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:01.920
So many people actually
put things into dark data.

00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:04.690
And most of the time, I think
they're talking about just,

00:45:04.690 --> 00:45:10.060
you know, maybe geospatial
data or, you know, call--

00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:12.270
phone metadata, things like that.

00:45:12.270 --> 00:45:13.570
But they're also saying,
oh, wow, you know,

00:45:13.570 --> 00:45:18.260
people actually have e-mails and
files that they put into systems,

00:45:18.260 --> 00:45:21.150
so a little scary, but
anyway, because this is all

00:45:21.150 --> 00:45:22.630
about the internet of things.

00:45:22.630 --> 00:45:24.320
This is the new thing
where, you know,

00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:26.130
your refrigerator will
tell you you're

00:45:26.130 --> 00:45:28.200
out of milk and things like that.

00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:31.030
But, you know, within that--

00:45:31.030 --> 00:45:34.920 position:56%
what they're saying is that there is
a stuff that is actually structured

00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:36.710
that could be useful to us.

00:45:36.710 --> 00:45:41.200
And I always-- I have this sort of
feeling that people in these fields

00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:43.780
of new data science are --

00:45:43.780 --> 00:45:46.680
occasionally they look over at
archivists or librarians and go,

00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:49.310
hey, you know, they might
have actually had something

00:45:49.310 --> 00:45:52.020
when they were talking about how
important it is to structured data.

00:45:52.020 --> 00:45:53.490
So, we shouldn't forget that.

00:45:53.490 --> 00:45:55.820
We've done such great
work in this area.

00:45:55.820 --> 00:46:01.620
And it's so important and so
critical I think not only to sort

00:46:01.620 --> 00:46:07.830
of these emerging kinds of slightly
dodgy, in my opinion, technologies,

00:46:07.830 --> 00:46:11.980
but also because in order to
manage our own collections

00:46:11.980 --> 00:46:17.300
within that new technology, we
need to be firm on structured data.

00:46:17.300 --> 00:46:18.620
I will just sort of say that.

00:46:18.620 --> 00:46:26.990
The other thing is, we've always
had some really cool stuff

00:46:26.990 --> 00:46:29.920
within our own collections.

00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:31.870
And I think it's really--
and that's one thing

00:46:31.870 --> 00:46:37.060
about the OAIS description I would
have loved to seeing, you know,

00:46:37.060 --> 00:46:39.020
people, systems, and cool stuff.

00:46:39.020 --> 00:46:42.870
Because I think actually, that's
another really important part

00:46:42.870 --> 00:46:45.260
of who we are as archivists,
is that we've always cared

00:46:45.260 --> 00:46:48.140
for collections, for material.

00:46:48.140 --> 00:46:50.840
We have incredible knowledge
about those collections,

00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:54.050
deep and impassioned about those
collections most of the time

00:46:54.050 --> 00:46:59.290
as well, an incredible
resource, in my opinion,

00:46:59.290 --> 00:47:04.370
for the rest of the world,
whether it's feature films

00:47:04.370 --> 00:47:08.990
or whether it's menus at
the Los Angeles Library,

00:47:08.990 --> 00:47:11.300
incredible treasure
trove of materials.

00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:16.580 position:56%
And not-- And, you know, it's easy I
think sometimes to forget about that

00:47:16.580 --> 00:47:20.760
when we're dealing with
metadata standards or other kinds

00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:22.800
of file format standards,
just things like that.

00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:24.810
The collections, they're
at the center of it.

00:47:24.810 --> 00:47:27.550
That's why we're in this
field to begin with.

00:47:27.550 --> 00:47:29.460
So just another thing I
think that we're really good

00:47:29.460 --> 00:47:36.890
at is really focusing on what that
resource is and why it's important.

00:47:36.890 --> 00:47:39.670
We decided to help
acquire something.

00:47:39.670 --> 00:47:42.430
We decided to write a
collection profile on it.

00:47:42.430 --> 00:47:46.630 position:56%
We decided that this collection took
a certain priority over others--

00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:50.090
those are all skills that
we have as archivists.

00:47:50.090 --> 00:47:56.550
Another quote from a recent article

00:47:56.550 --> 00:47:59.480
about digital asset management
system, and this is something

00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:02.520
that is near and dear to
my heart too which is,

00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:06.130
this content I call
asset transparency

00:48:06.130 --> 00:48:07.430
which is a horrible phrase.

00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:08.730
I need to come up with another one.

00:48:08.730 --> 00:48:11.210
But the idea is that when we were--

00:48:11.210 --> 00:48:14.050
at Paramount, when we were building
our digital preservation system,

00:48:14.050 --> 00:48:16.820
a key philosophical foundation--

00:48:16.820 --> 00:48:21.230
foundational philosophy was
that we needed to build a system

00:48:21.230 --> 00:48:24.120
that we could take
all of the assets.

00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:28.540 position:56%
And by that, I mean, each individual
file that makes up the picture

00:48:28.540 --> 00:48:33.360
of a feature film, and each
individual WAV file that makes

00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:38.790
up the track that goes along with
that feature film, the video files

00:48:38.790 --> 00:48:42.120
that represent the trailer,
the JPEGs that represent all

00:48:42.120 --> 00:48:45.200
of the photographic
stills, all those assets

00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:49.310
and all their metadata need
to be able to move them

00:48:49.310 --> 00:48:52.660
out of the current digital
asset management system

00:48:52.660 --> 00:48:56.300
and the infrastructure we have
now and into something else.

00:48:56.300 --> 00:48:58.890
Because I know the
software will go away.

00:48:58.890 --> 00:49:01.150
I know the hardware will change.

00:49:01.150 --> 00:49:03.930
That-- Those are the
things I know the most.

00:49:03.930 --> 00:49:07.820
What-- And what-- But what I need
to do is maintain the longevity

00:49:07.820 --> 00:49:10.130
and the permanence of the assets.

00:49:10.130 --> 00:49:14.510
And so in order to do that,
I think it's really important

00:49:14.510 --> 00:49:20.910
to know the machine for-- which
is know what your system is made

00:49:20.910 --> 00:49:22.810
out of, what are its
bits and pieces.

00:49:22.810 --> 00:49:25.880
I think that is something
that we need to know better.

00:49:25.880 --> 00:49:34.890 position:56%
I mean, within my career, I've seen,
you know, the change from, you know,

00:49:34.890 --> 00:49:42.250
when you had-- everyone had
their own data storage system,

00:49:42.250 --> 00:49:45.840
their own tape library or their set
of servers they had in the basement

00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:50.500
or they had some place on their
facility to now moving to a lot

00:49:50.500 --> 00:49:53.820
of people using cloud-based
infrastructures

00:49:53.820 --> 00:49:55.120
and what does that mean?

00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:58.170
It means different
technology roles change.

00:49:58.170 --> 00:50:03.620
This concept of DevOps,
the development operations,

00:50:03.620 --> 00:50:08.880
is a new sort of catch-all job
description for many people

00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:10.670
that work in different
technology fields.

00:50:10.670 --> 00:50:14.770
And what it means is, they have to
do hardware and software together

00:50:14.770 --> 00:50:18.190
where it used to be very,
very segregated across,

00:50:18.190 --> 00:50:21.230
you had system administrators,
you had software developers,

00:50:21.230 --> 00:50:23.470
you had analyst, very segregated.

00:50:23.470 --> 00:50:25.280
Now, everything is
getting smooshed together.

00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:28.100
It's important to know
that because that--

00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:31.500
you're going to need to interact
with those people as you go.

00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:38.400
So knowing what you have now and
also specifically like for example

00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:42.090
at Paramount, not only do I have
my digital asset management system,

00:50:42.090 --> 00:50:47.900
I am absolutely dependent on
other databases within the studio

00:50:47.900 --> 00:50:52.530
to provide me with key metadata
about my assets, whether it's--

00:50:52.530 --> 00:50:56.440
there is a title database for
example that I must interact with.

00:50:56.440 --> 00:50:59.320
There is a rights database
that I must interact with.

00:50:59.320 --> 00:51:03.840
So knowing about those
systems and their fragility

00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:06.560
because often there is
that, their legacy systems,

00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:10.240
it may not be replaced for a while
what information I need is also a

00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:11.540
part of my job.

00:51:11.540 --> 00:51:14.230
So I think that's another
but I think again--

00:51:14.230 --> 00:51:19.360
I think we have the skills for that
because I think naturally we do see

00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:24.740
because we've been working
so hard on really collecting

00:51:24.740 --> 00:51:26.600
and documenting collections.

00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:30.200
We can see in our heads what things
we need from different places.

00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:35.780
So I think we have
the skills to do that.

00:51:35.780 --> 00:51:40.940
So distract-tech, this is my phrase
I won't patent it or anything

00:51:40.940 --> 00:51:45.870
but the-- there's thing called
AdTech and MarTech I don't know

00:51:45.870 --> 00:51:48.270
if you've come across
this concept or--

00:51:48.270 --> 00:51:54.340 position:56%
but right, really what that means is
that advertisers and marketers are

00:51:54.340 --> 00:51:56.260
of course becoming
really savvy about how

00:51:56.260 --> 00:52:00.640
to make sure you're
getting as many things,

00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:04.420
so it was possible whenever
you interact with the interwebs

00:52:04.420 --> 00:52:07.020
or anything connected to it.

00:52:07.020 --> 00:52:12.950
And they, you know, are in the data
science realm, they are in trying

00:52:12.950 --> 00:52:16.310
to make sure that whatever you're,
you know, buying is connected

00:52:16.310 --> 00:52:19.230
to something you bought
before all these kind of stuff

00:52:19.230 --> 00:52:24.760 position:56%
and this quote is I think really apt
which is somebody sort of starting

00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:28.590
to complain if there's really not a
lot of substance there and it does.

00:52:28.590 --> 00:52:29.890
I think, you know, in some cases,

00:52:29.890 --> 00:52:32.530
there is some really good probably
programming behind it but a lot

00:52:32.530 --> 00:52:36.890 position:56%
of it is marketing to themselves,
you know, where our company is going

00:52:36.890 --> 00:52:40.350
to save all your, you know,
to solve all your advertising

00:52:40.350 --> 00:52:42.140
in marketing problems.

00:52:42.140 --> 00:52:46.880
And I just put his sort of hashtag
"we've always had substance,"

00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:50.260
which is-- this is again
what we have as archivists,

00:52:50.260 --> 00:52:53.600 position:56%
is we have the collections, we have
the contents, we have the substance,

00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:59.130
you know, that it's easy I think
to get caught up in the fact

00:52:59.130 --> 00:53:04.510
that if we have digitized a lot
of materials, we feel, you know,

00:53:04.510 --> 00:53:08.300
we must get, you know, push
something out via Twitter

00:53:08.300 --> 00:53:11.920
or Facebook, or Instagram
or Snapchat or something

00:53:11.920 --> 00:53:14.140
into the universe everyday.

00:53:14.140 --> 00:53:16.590
It's an important part of
getting the word out there

00:53:16.590 --> 00:53:18.610
about our digital collections.

00:53:18.610 --> 00:53:21.560
And maybe that's a great idea,
maybe that isn't, I don't know.

00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:26.070
But I think it is, it can
be, you know, sort of,

00:53:26.070 --> 00:53:31.150 position:56%
it could potentially be distracting
too from our mission from my opinion

00:53:31.150 --> 00:53:34.780
that just getting the word
out about our collections

00:53:34.780 --> 00:53:37.240
and spending an enormous amount
of time doing without thinking

00:53:37.240 --> 00:53:43.270
about why it could carry
some risks just a thought.

00:53:43.270 --> 00:53:49.250
You know, this phrase iTunes
metadata decimation is actually a

00:53:49.250 --> 00:53:52.250
quote from a friend of mine
who was talking about how--

00:53:52.250 --> 00:53:57.840
they've had iTunes for, you know,
oh gosh, a decade or so or more

00:53:57.840 --> 00:54:03.910
and have purchased a lot of
music and then, you know,

00:54:03.910 --> 00:54:08.030
and kept very good, you know, he
is very good personal archivist,

00:54:08.030 --> 00:54:11.890
very good care of his
iTunes library overtime.

00:54:11.890 --> 00:54:21.050 position:56%
And then decided to go to the iCloud
and push his library up there and lo

00:54:21.050 --> 00:54:26.990
and behold, new versions of
music actually replaced the ones

00:54:26.990 --> 00:54:28.960
that he had originally purchased.

00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:33.940
You know and iTunes mainly stop
the music, what's your problem.

00:54:33.940 --> 00:54:38.360 position:56%
But, you know, this is I think a key
and an interesting concept to keep

00:54:38.360 --> 00:54:46.230
in mind as archivists, right, which
is that I can see a world where,

00:54:46.230 --> 00:54:50.200
let's say, you know, Paramount
Pictures, oh I don't know,

00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:54.500
is bought up by, oh, I don't know,
a Chinese studio that could happen.

00:54:54.500 --> 00:54:58.630
And the Chinese studios
actually digitized the bunch

00:54:58.630 --> 00:55:02.960
of Paramount Pictures on their
own for some reason overtime

00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:05.900
and they just want to merge
our libraries why not, right?

00:55:05.900 --> 00:55:07.380
It's no big deal.

00:55:07.380 --> 00:55:12.780
Well, we're-- but I've spent, you
know, most of my time making sure

00:55:12.780 --> 00:55:17.040
that when I have Saturday
Night Fever,

00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:19.190
I know it's Saturday night fever.

00:55:19.190 --> 00:55:24.130 position:56%
I know that I have captured the best
possible resolution of that image

00:55:24.130 --> 00:55:27.790 position:56%
that I know that that both technical
and descriptive metadata is

00:55:27.790 --> 00:55:31.580
as accurate as possible that
I've spent this time doing it

00:55:31.580 --> 00:55:33.580
and I don't want to lose that.

00:55:33.580 --> 00:55:39.060
And that's an important key thing
and it's a concept to provenance.

00:55:39.060 --> 00:55:44.070
And I think it is going to be much
more important for us to find ways

00:55:44.070 --> 00:55:47.280
of authenticating and
verifying and making sure

00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:52.920
that we have actual information
about different versions of assets

00:55:52.920 --> 00:55:55.450
and materials as we go forward.

00:55:55.450 --> 00:55:58.380
I was talking to Bert a
little bit before about--

00:55:58.380 --> 00:56:01.480
just about law enforcement
and not the obvious need

00:56:01.480 --> 00:56:04.230
for evidentiary provenance.

00:56:04.230 --> 00:56:09.050 position:56%
So this is, you know, to me this-- I
have a tough girl up there because,

00:56:09.050 --> 00:56:12.390 position:56%
you know, nobody is going to take my
Saturday Night Fever away from me.

00:56:12.390 --> 00:56:16.350
You know, that is my
job to make sure

00:56:16.350 --> 00:56:19.450
that Saturday Night Fever
exists in the best possible way.

00:56:19.450 --> 00:56:23.690
Or more, perhaps, you
know, a film like Nebraska

00:56:23.690 --> 00:56:29.100 position:56%
which was digitally shot and doesn't
have a chance for me to go back

00:56:29.100 --> 00:56:32.620
to some sort of analog
provenance if I need to.

00:56:32.620 --> 00:56:35.220
So this to me, you
know, this is our--

00:56:35.220 --> 00:56:39.420
one of our responsibilities as far
as I see it in the digital realm is

00:56:39.420 --> 00:56:44.350
to make sure that we are the
keepers of the real stuff.

00:56:44.350 --> 00:56:47.120
We're really good at that and
we shouldn't lose that just

00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:52.320
because it's digital or, and so you
were talking about crowd sourcing

00:56:52.320 --> 00:56:55.660
and other kinds of, you know,
that kind of interaction with that

00:56:55.660 --> 00:57:00.830
and I think that none of that is
wrong or off but it's still our job

00:57:00.830 --> 00:57:03.510
in the end to keep that
provenance in that authority

00:57:03.510 --> 00:57:06.440 position:56%
and that verification in my opinion.

00:57:06.440 --> 00:57:08.130
This is a slide I stole

00:57:08.130 --> 00:57:12.020
from my colleague Nicola
Mazzanti some of you know him.

00:57:12.020 --> 00:57:18.010
He's never afraid to be
very strident and he--

00:57:18.010 --> 00:57:25.300
this is a slide that just really
was talking about within, you know,

00:57:25.300 --> 00:57:29.040
as many of you know within
film archives there is a strong

00:57:29.040 --> 00:57:31.460 position:56%
and interesting debate about digital

00:57:31.460 --> 00:57:34.160
versus photochemical
and preservation.

00:57:34.160 --> 00:57:37.510
And this was his way
of saying within Europe

00:57:37.510 --> 00:57:41.400
that if we didn't embrace
the concept--

00:57:41.400 --> 00:57:44.490
if there wasn't an embrace
of digital preservation

00:57:44.490 --> 00:57:48.310
within cinema culture
that there would be a loss

00:57:48.310 --> 00:57:50.810
of investment within archives.

00:57:50.810 --> 00:57:54.860
And so, I think and
that's-- to me that's fine.

00:57:54.860 --> 00:57:57.300
I think either side of this
debate to be straitened

00:57:57.300 --> 00:58:01.820
and to be opinionated is
perfectly well within our rights

00:58:01.820 --> 00:58:05.780
and we should be and
again, our job as archivists

00:58:05.780 --> 00:58:10.020
and as knowledge-keepers of how
to maintain these materials.

00:58:10.020 --> 00:58:20.200 position:56%
This is pizza in a plastic container
that is meant to last forever.

00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:23.180
And I just love the
idea of permanent pizza.

00:58:23.180 --> 00:58:27.490
You know, and I think
this is another,

00:58:27.490 --> 00:58:33.640
this is another really difficult
thing for us to start to face

00:58:33.640 --> 00:58:38.790
when do have so much
to archive now out--

00:58:38.790 --> 00:58:42.360
you know, within each one of our
remits whether it's, you know,

00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:45.820
my remit is to take care
of materials created

00:58:45.820 --> 00:58:48.750
by Paramount Pictures
so that the rest

00:58:48.750 --> 00:58:50.350
of the studio can really use it.

00:58:50.350 --> 00:58:54.030
You know, other people have
the remit to collect things

00:58:54.030 --> 00:58:59.260
for a particular region of the
United States where the people

00:58:59.260 --> 00:59:01.960
that are in that region to use it.

00:59:01.960 --> 00:59:06.410
Within our own remit
where-- what is too much?

00:59:06.410 --> 00:59:09.140
I don't, for example right now,

00:59:09.140 --> 00:59:12.310
collect any Paramount
Twitter feeds, should I?

00:59:12.310 --> 00:59:15.630
Maybe, I don't know, you
know, another discussion.

00:59:15.630 --> 00:59:21.310
I don't collect every
single version of a work

00:59:21.310 --> 00:59:24.080
in progress film before
it's completed, should I?

00:59:24.080 --> 00:59:25.380
Maybe, I don't know.

00:59:25.380 --> 00:59:27.280
There are millions of them.

00:59:27.280 --> 00:59:33.160
And these were just two quotes
which are, you know, by very,

00:59:33.160 --> 00:59:37.450
very smart people trying to figure
out definitions for digital archive

00:59:37.450 --> 00:59:43.320
and for preservation which show
that all smart people like everyone

00:59:43.320 --> 00:59:49.240
in this room and is-- are really
grappling with these ideas

00:59:49.240 --> 00:59:55.080
of what a digital archive is
by either expanding the concept

00:59:55.080 --> 00:59:58.080
like adding value to people's lives
by increasing their understanding

00:59:58.080 --> 01:00:00.120
and appreciation of the past.

01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:05.260 position:56%
That's fantastic but you know what's
step one from there, you know,

01:00:05.260 --> 01:00:11.400
could be anything or a really
great article that really sort

01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:14.140
of just outlines the different
definitions of digital archive

01:00:14.140 --> 01:00:17.000
of digital preservation
that exist out there.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.860
So we're all grappling
with these definitions

01:00:19.860 --> 01:00:23.950
because I think we're grappling
with what we're actually going

01:00:23.950 --> 01:00:28.890
to preserve and not even
the how and the, you know,

01:00:28.890 --> 01:00:31.070
and then how much but what?

01:00:31.070 --> 01:00:36.230
So those are all the things I
think we have in front of us now

01:00:36.230 --> 01:00:40.360
that we're 20 to 30 years into
this whole digital archive thing.

01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:47.230
But I think that we as a
field, those of us within AMIA,

01:00:47.230 --> 01:00:51.070
those of us within IASA and other
archive organizations especially

01:00:51.070 --> 01:00:55.550
dealing with moving images as they
are going to be a critical part

01:00:55.550 --> 01:01:01.790
of how we think about
culture, history,

01:01:01.790 --> 01:01:05.540
education, every part of our lives.

01:01:05.540 --> 01:01:09.840
We have the skills and I
think it's an exciting time

01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:13.050
and I am happy to be a part of it.

01:01:13.050 --> 01:01:14.850
Thanks very much.

[ Applause ]

01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:27.280
I'm happy to answer
questions if anybody has one.

I'm happy to answer
questions if anybody has any.

questions for Andrea?

Any comments?

here, over there.

01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:36.940
Yeah?

George, over there.

01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:39.610
&gt;&gt; George: Do you have any
difficulty getting right

01:01:39.610 --> 01:01:45.510
for the images you're
using in the presentation?

01:01:45.510 --> 01:01:49.320
[ Laughter ]

01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:50.620
&gt;&gt; Andrea Kalas: They're all right.

01:01:50.620 --> 01:01:53.860
They are all from Paramount
Pictures except for the pizza one.

01:01:55.050 --> 01:02:00.570
&gt;&gt; Audience member: Can we
assume from your pizza example

01:02:00.570 --> 01:02:07.240
that there is a connection
between preservation of pizza,

01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:09.510
see within that digital--

01:02:09.510 --> 01:02:15.740
digitization of images cuts
out the taste of the original?

01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:17.040
[laughter]

01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:18.960
&gt;&gt; Andrea Kalas: You could--

01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:23.980
I think you can use that metaphor
anywhere you want, you know,

01:02:23.980 --> 01:02:31.160
I think-- to my using that metaphor
was to say, I like pizza to eat,

01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:33.860
I don't like it to last very
long and that doesn't taste

01:02:33.860 --> 01:02:35.580
as good after a while, you know?

01:02:35.580 --> 01:02:41.120
I don't see the point of keeping
pizza in plastic for a long time.

01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:44.620
That's really what I meant is
that there may be more things

01:02:44.620 --> 01:02:50.080
than we really do need to archive
is really what I'm suggesting,

01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:54.880
that there are so much out there
that the idea of actually trying

01:02:54.880 --> 01:02:59.960
to figure out what to archive that
is digitally born is challenging

01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:03.860
and some of it we do, we may
be preserving some pizza,

01:03:03.860 --> 01:03:07.230 position:56%
erroneously, accidentally, possibly.

01:03:07.230 --> 01:03:10.250
So that's what I'm
trying to communicate.

01:03:10.250 --> 01:03:12.000
&gt;&gt; Audience member: I have
a real question, I'm sorry.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.780
&gt;&gt; Andrea Kalas: No, no.

01:03:13.780 --> 01:03:16.270
&gt;&gt; Audience member: How much are
the original resource material

01:03:16.270 --> 01:03:18.510
that made reference
to you, an original--

01:03:18.510 --> 01:03:22.950
[ Inaudible Remark ]

01:03:22.950 --> 01:03:26.920
-- interest in and get
preservation and restoration.

01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:31.420
How much of the original
source of material

01:03:31.420 --> 01:03:36.590
of these original trends
should be preserved?

01:03:36.590 --> 01:03:40.060
Are they preserved once
they have been digitized.

01:03:40.060 --> 01:03:41.360
&gt;&gt; Andrea Kalas: I'll
try to repeat that just

01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:43.600
so everybody can-- I
hear your question OK?

01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:47.570
And if I go wrong just, you
know, you can throw things at me.

01:03:47.570 --> 01:03:52.750
He's-- the question was in
reference to a comment they made

01:03:52.750 --> 01:03:56.100
about fine grains which is if you
don't know an intermediate element

01:03:56.100 --> 01:03:59.880
for film duplication, it's
not the original negative,

01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:04.950 position:56%
it's the next generation of how many
of those things should be preserved?

01:04:04.950 --> 01:04:08.690
In my opinion, if you've got film
right now, you should keep it

01:04:08.690 --> 01:04:12.050
as long as you can, you know,
so those original materials,

01:04:12.050 --> 01:04:15.090
especially something like a
fine grain should be preserved

01:04:15.090 --> 01:04:20.220
in the best possible way, the best
possible environment, you know,

01:04:20.220 --> 01:04:23.360
as long as possible, those
are original materials.

01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:24.660
We do scan.

01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:28.170
We scan material at the best
highest quality all the time.

01:04:28.170 --> 01:04:30.210
We don't throw the
film at afterwards,

01:04:30.210 --> 01:04:31.510
in answer to your question.

01:04:31.510 --> 01:04:32.810
I hope-- does that
answer your question?

&gt;&gt; Chris: So you said you were here
representing yourself but I'm going

01:05:03.020 --> 01:05:04.320
to put on the spot especially
we have two presidents of AMIA

01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:07.460
and IASA here have to do it.

01:05:07.460 --> 01:05:09.450
So I am just curious, you
talked a lot about, you know,

01:05:09.450 --> 01:05:11.810
the evolving skill set and
the role of the archivist.

01:05:11.810 --> 01:05:16.480
I'd love to hear how AMIA and
IASA are addressing the need

01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:18.990
for this evolving skills set
and what are your thoughts

01:05:18.990 --> 01:05:21.600
on how we move forward there?

01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:22.970
&gt;&gt; Andrea Kalas: Well
I go first and then.

01:05:22.970 --> 01:05:24.270
&gt;&gt; Ilse Assmann: You go first.

01:05:24.270 --> 01:05:25.710
&gt;&gt; Andrea Kalas: OK.

01:05:25.710 --> 01:05:27.560
I think that, you know, the events

01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:31.240
like digital asset symposium are
strongly-focused on trying to bring

01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:35.690 position:56%
in new kinds of members, new kinds
of skill sets into the organization.

01:05:35.690 --> 01:05:42.440 position:56%
I think workshops that happen before
this session including a hack day

01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:45.320
and other kinds of sessions.

01:05:45.320 --> 01:05:48.690
There's a-- There is a
digital preservation stream

01:05:48.690 --> 01:05:52.190
at this year's conference,
I think trying

01:05:52.190 --> 01:05:58.870
to encourage the different kinds of
workshops and skills that's there.

01:05:58.870 --> 01:06:02.300
Actually, our own education
committee which comes out of a lot

01:06:02.300 --> 01:06:05.510
of student memberships
has been amazing at--

01:06:05.510 --> 01:06:11.740
on their own, letting each other
know about new jobs and new kinds

01:06:11.740 --> 01:06:14.190
of training and events
and things like that.

01:06:14.190 --> 01:06:20.030
So, I think AMIA has had a
strong scholarship program

01:06:20.030 --> 01:06:23.320
for a really long time and that's
been I think a really critical part

01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:27.350
of having students come in and
come back to the organization

01:06:27.350 --> 01:06:29.950
after they have graduated
and continuing their career

01:06:29.950 --> 01:06:31.480
and bringing new ideas into things.

01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:34.700
So that's my AMIA answer.

01:06:34.700 --> 01:06:38.550
&gt;&gt; Ilse Assmann: From IASA's
point of view, we've recognized

01:06:38.550 --> 01:06:44.100
that training is extremely critical
and we've set up a task force

01:06:44.100 --> 01:06:46.570 position:56%
under the leadership of both Prentis
[assumed spelling] over here.

01:06:46.570 --> 01:06:50.160
Well I think you need
to just maybe stand

01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:55.150
up because this task force is
really very critical for us

01:06:55.150 --> 01:06:57.200
to build the framework
on where we need to go.

01:06:57.200 --> 01:07:00.290
And anybody who's interested
in joining will

01:07:00.290 --> 01:07:05.250
within that task force is
really welcome to contact him.

01:07:05.250 --> 01:07:08.420
We've just launched
it and that is apart

01:07:08.420 --> 01:07:10.560
from our regular training
program where we go

01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:12.710
and do workshops as well.

01:07:12.710 --> 01:07:18.400
We've initiated a new student
membership and I'm glad to say

01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:20.970
that these couple of students
that have registered already

01:07:20.970 --> 01:07:25.030 position:56%
or become members already, but we've
recognized that we actually need

01:07:25.030 --> 01:07:27.020
to move forward and we need

01:07:27.020 --> 01:07:29.770
to be far more proactive
than we've ever been.

01:07:29.770 --> 01:07:32.170
Apart from that, as
you know already,

01:07:32.170 --> 01:07:38.020
a technical committee is
extremely what's the proactive.

01:07:38.020 --> 01:07:41.560
Not proactive, productive
in publish--

01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:44.760 position:56%
publishing the standard so to speak.

01:07:44.760 --> 01:07:50.500
The first one was on ethical
standards for audio-visual objects

01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:57.760
and then came the TCO4 which
was standard for sound object.

01:07:57.760 --> 01:08:01.550
We also published the
storage, how to store object

01:08:01.550 --> 01:08:04.070
and now we're busy
working on the video one.

01:08:04.070 --> 01:08:08.140
So, IASA is instrumental in doing
that and I think that's all trying

01:08:08.140 --> 01:08:11.350
to incorporate this and
stay with the trends

01:08:11.350 --> 01:08:15.150
that we currently see
in the world, OK.

01:08:15.150 --> 01:08:22.990
&gt;&gt; Audience member: You spoke about
the kind of a standard-- thank you.

01:08:22.990 --> 01:08:26.700
You spoke earlier just slight
about having a relationship

01:08:26.700 --> 01:08:29.810 position:56%
with designated communities as part
of your responsibility as archivist.

01:08:29.810 --> 01:08:31.870
And I wonder if you could
just kind of address

01:08:31.870 --> 01:08:33.440
that in your particular case.

01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:37.760
What-- who are your designated user
communities as you think of them,

01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:40.770
and how do you interrelate
with them?

01:08:40.770 --> 01:08:42.070
&gt;&gt; Andrea Kalas: At Paramount?

01:08:42.070 --> 01:08:43.370
&gt;&gt; Audience member: Yes.

01:08:43.370 --> 01:08:44.990
&gt;&gt; Andrea Kalas: At Paramount, our
designated community is Paramount.

01:08:44.990 --> 01:08:46.910
I mean, we are a corporate
archive, right?

01:08:46.910 --> 01:08:51.640
Our job is to preserve those
materials for people to sell them

01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:56.820
for airlines or for
Netflix or for Blue Ray

01:08:56.820 --> 01:08:58.940
or however they want
to distribute them.

01:08:58.940 --> 01:09:01.620
That's our job, you know.

01:09:01.620 --> 01:09:04.870
We do take very seriously
the fact that another sort

01:09:04.870 --> 01:09:08.500
of designated community that's
not necessarily what we get paid

01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:11.290
for is people that are
interested in film history

01:09:11.290 --> 01:09:13.520
and interested in history of film.

01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:18.200
And we do try to work with that as
much as possible as what we can do.

01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:21.980
But first and foremost,
we're a corporate archive.

01:09:21.980 --> 01:09:25.150
I think, you know, the other
thing that's about that phrase,

01:09:25.150 --> 01:09:30.130
designated communities, too is that
even though that might have been--

01:09:30.130 --> 01:09:33.230
I think that changes now
when you're digitizing

01:09:33.230 --> 01:09:34.530
and put things online, right?

01:09:34.530 --> 01:09:38.290
So that you're-- what you actually
potentially got funding for,

01:09:38.290 --> 01:09:41.450
like I might have gotten
funding for, you know,

01:09:41.450 --> 01:09:44.810
preserving something
for a Blue Ray sale.

01:09:44.810 --> 01:09:49.410 position:56%
Well now, you know, Paramount
actually does have a YouTube channel

01:09:49.410 --> 01:09:50.710
called the Paramount vaut.

01:09:50.710 --> 01:09:52.010
That might be there.

01:09:52.010 --> 01:09:54.310
That's a different designated
community, similar to somebody

01:09:54.310 --> 01:09:56.890 position:56%
who gets funding for educational use

01:09:56.890 --> 01:09:59.560
of a particular news
clip or something.

01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:02.350
But then it gets, you know,
sort of distributed faster.

01:10:02.350 --> 01:10:08.350
Our designated communities shift
and change and so I don't--

01:10:08.350 --> 01:10:10.020 position:56%
again, that phrase, even though it's

01:10:10.020 --> 01:10:13.520
from only IASA's is
useful because it's true.

01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:18.750
We always have our immediate
responsibility as a repository,

01:10:18.750 --> 01:10:20.460
but I think its shifting
and changing.

01:10:20.460 --> 01:10:21.760
&gt;&gt; Audience Memberzz: Hi.

01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:25.430
Thank you very much for
a great presentation.

01:10:25.430 --> 01:10:26.730
&gt;&gt; Andrea Kalas: Thank you.

01:10:26.730 --> 01:10:28.030
&gt;&gt; Audience Member: My
question is regarding

01:10:28.030 --> 01:10:31.170
to their file names' standards,

01:10:31.170 --> 01:10:34.110
that's quite a long
file name standard.

01:10:34.110 --> 01:10:39.260
And I saw it's sort of like a
two-pronged question is what drove

01:10:39.260 --> 01:10:44.220
your decision to include all of
those elements in the file name.

01:10:44.220 --> 01:10:48.160
And, you know, how long, like were
there other people involved in that

01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:50.540
and how long did it take
you to get people to agree?

01:10:50.540 --> 01:10:51.840
[laughter]

01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:54.530
&gt;&gt; Andrea Kalas: It's an excellent
question and it really speaks

01:10:54.530 --> 01:10:58.110
to the heart of sort of what
we do daily because actually,

01:10:58.110 --> 01:11:02.340
we in archive group argued
against files names at all.

01:11:02.340 --> 01:11:04.400
We wanted everybody to
just use our attributes,

01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:06.260
we'd spend a long time using them

01:11:06.260 --> 01:11:07.660
and within our asset
management system

01:11:07.660 --> 01:11:08.960
and what do you mean filenames?

01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:10.350
We-- We've put everything in here

01:11:10.350 --> 01:11:13.090
and we keep it constantly
refreshed and updated.

01:11:13.090 --> 01:11:16.620
So, you know, we didn't have
3D yesterday but now we do.

01:11:16.620 --> 01:11:20.470
So the things that we didn't call,
2D are now called 2D, you know?

01:11:20.470 --> 01:11:25.020
We keep that constantly updated,
so we were a little offended when,

01:11:25.020 --> 01:11:27.970
you know, our colleagues and other
departments, they are like, yeah,

01:11:27.970 --> 01:11:31.580
but we have to send these
files all over the place.

01:11:31.580 --> 01:11:33.410
And we can't actually ensure

01:11:33.410 --> 01:11:36.110
that that metadata follows
that a file over time.

01:11:36.110 --> 01:11:40.780
And there are efforts right now
to try to, you know, correct that.

01:11:40.780 --> 01:11:45.750 position:56%
But the file name was it-- it's like
reading the spine on a book really.

01:11:45.750 --> 01:11:49.450
It's the sort of equivalent of
that for people, one-stop shopping

01:11:49.450 --> 01:11:50.750
and how they can read that?

01:11:50.750 --> 01:11:52.920
I really don't know, but they do.

01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:56.590
And so, but the other part of
your question is absolutely part

01:11:56.590 --> 01:11:59.760
of that is that we're not an
island or not in the archive.

01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:03.480
You know, we work with the people
that are in our mastering group

01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:05.800
and our distribution
group all the time.

01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:08.570
So, and we have weekly
change management meetings

01:12:08.570 --> 01:12:12.450
and that's a critical part of the
development and implementation

01:12:12.450 --> 01:12:16.530
of any digital archive in my
opinion is stakeholder change

01:12:16.530 --> 01:12:18.230
management meetings.

01:12:18.230 --> 01:12:20.910
So you are all agreeing
on it because it's--

01:12:20.910 --> 01:12:25.750
you don't go anywhere
if you don't do that.

01:12:25.750 --> 01:12:28.340
Any other?

01:12:29.540 --> 01:12:32.020
Well thanks again Ilse and
thanks everyone for your time.

01:12:32.020 --> 01:12:34.030
