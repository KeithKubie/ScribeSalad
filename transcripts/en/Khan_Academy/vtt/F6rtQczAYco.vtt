00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:04.360
Maria and Nadia drive from
Philadelphia to Toronto

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:05.850
to visit their friend.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.440
They take two days for
the trip, stopping along

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.120
the way for sightseeing.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.070
To conserve on gas
mileage, they drive

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.350
at a constant speed
for the entire trip.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.910
All right, which of the
following equations, where

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.290
x represents hours,
and y represents miles,

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.420
represents a speed
that is greater

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.590
than Maria and Nadia's speed?

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.440
Select all that apply.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.900
So let's think about
what's happening here.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:37.880
So on day one, they travel for
4 hours and they go 240 miles.

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.910
So if we wanted to
figure out their speed,

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.280
you would figure out
distance divided by time.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.060
So they travel 240
miles in 4 hours.

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.780
240 miles divided by 4
hours is 60 miles per hour.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.322
So they were going
60 miles per hour.

00:00:56.322 --> 00:00:58.738
And assuming they went on a
constant speed the whole time,

00:00:58.738 --> 00:01:01.090
they should have been going
60 miles per hour on day two

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.589
as well.

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:02.790
And we can verify that.

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:07.020
60 miles per hour times 5
hours is indeed 300 miles,

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.350
or 300 divided by 5 is 60.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.440
So they went 60 miles per hour.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.280
So which of these equations
represent a relation

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.000
between time elapsed
in hours and distance

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.890
that represents faster
than 60 miles per hour.

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.651
Well, here, you're
taking the time times 60

00:01:25.651 --> 00:01:27.650
to get distance, which
is what we did over here.

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.220
Time times 60 to get distance,
which is exactly their speed.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.490
But we care about a
speed that is greater.

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.440
And so pretty much all of these
other coefficients are faster.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.950
So here you're taking your
time times 65 miles per hour

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.170
to get-- So you're going
to go more distance, more

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.350
than 60 miles per hour,
in this situation.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.350
Here, you're going
70 miles per hour.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.847
Here you're going
80 miles per hour.

00:01:48.847 --> 00:01:49.680
And we got it right.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.640
Let's do one more.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.860
Some vinyl records,
let's call them

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:59.250
oldies, rotate at the rate
of 78 revolutions per minute.

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.840
The chart below
shows revolutions

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.720
per minute for three
different tracks

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.720
on another type of vinyl
record called goodies.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.419
Which has a greater rate of
revolution, oldies or goodies?

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:12.234
So oldies are at 78
revolutions per minute.

00:02:12.234 --> 00:02:14.400
Let's think about these
revolutions per minute right

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.290
over here.

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.960
So in three minutes, this
one makes 135 revolutions.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.140
So how many per minute?

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.650
So if we divide revolutions by
minutes, you're going to get,

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.330
let's see, 3 goes into 135--
it looks like it would go into,

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.240
let's see, 3 goes
into 120 40 times.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.860
So it looks like
it goes 45 times.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.570
So it's 45 revolutions
per minute for track one.

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.520
Track two is also 45.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.400
4 times 45, if I have 45
revolutions per minute times 4

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.440
minutes, that's 160 plus 20.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.360
Yep, that's 180.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.000
So these are all 45
revolutions per minute

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.530
you can multiply 5 minutes
times 45 revolutions per minute.

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.320
You're going to get 225.

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.290
So the oldies go at 78 RPM.

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.150
So they do 78
revolutions in a minute,

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.540
while the goodies go 45.

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.390
So the oldies do more
revolutions in a minute.

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:12.380
So oldies have a greater rate
of revolutions per minute,

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.540
or they just have a greater
rate of revolutions per minute.
