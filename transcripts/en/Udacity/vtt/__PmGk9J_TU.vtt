00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.890
Now the cool thing about inheritance patterns of dominant recessive

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:06.020
traits is that it all depends on your perspective. I

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:09.110
mean we could focus on Lactose intolerance, which would make

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.170
a recessive pedigree. Or we could the focus on the

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.820
flip side, the dominant corollary, lactase persistence and lactose tolerance.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.160
Right? The ability to digest lactose found in many dairy

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.490
products like milk and cheese. So let's flip the pedigree

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.320
and see what it looks like. So if this is what

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.270
a recessive pedigree looks like, when

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.880
we focus on lactose intolerance, then let's

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:38.550
flip this pedigree and see what it looks like from the dominant perspective. Now

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.370
you're looking at a pedigree of lactose

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.020
tolerance from the dominant perspective. Notice that

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:50.560
the shaded symbols of the pedigree have changed quite a bit. They now show

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:56.320
up in every generation of our pedigree, and we see a much higher frequency. In

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.250
fact, there are a couple of very distinct

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.760
features about a dominant pedigree, compared to a

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.769
recessive pedigree. So, which of the following must

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.430
be true about a pedigree representing a dominant

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.285
trait? Here are four options, and remember that

00:01:11.285 --> 00:01:15.920
this time, affected means lactose tolerant not intolerant.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.610
So go ahead and pick any and all that you think apply.
