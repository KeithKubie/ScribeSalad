00:00:06.912 --> 00:00:09.798
Mining unobtainium is hard work.

00:00:09.798 --> 00:00:13.959
The rare mineral appears 
in only 1% of rocks in the mine.

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:17.883
But your friend Tricky Joe 
has something up his sleeve.

00:00:17.883 --> 00:00:22.732
The unobtainium detector he’s been 
perfecting for months is finally ready.

00:00:22.732 --> 00:00:27.642
The device never fails 
to detect unobtainium if any is present.

00:00:27.642 --> 00:00:30.133
Otherwise, it’s still highly reliable,

00:00:30.133 --> 00:00:34.142
returning accurate 
readings 90% of the time.

00:00:34.142 --> 00:00:36.273
On his first day trying 
it out in the field,

00:00:36.273 --> 00:00:41.032
the device goes off, and 
Joe happily places the rock in his cart.

00:00:41.032 --> 00:00:44.822
As the two of you head back to camp 
where the ore can be examined,

00:00:44.822 --> 00:00:46.742
Joe makes you an offer:

00:00:46.742 --> 00:00:50.641
he’ll sell you the ore for just $200.

00:00:50.641 --> 00:00:56.462
You know that a piece of unobtanium 
that size would easily be worth $1000,

00:00:56.462 --> 00:01:00.598
but any other minerals 
would be effectively worthless.

00:01:00.598 --> 00:01:03.479
Should you make the trade?

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:06.870
Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself.

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.041
Answer in: 3

00:01:08.041 --> 00:01:09.202
Answer in: 2

00:01:09.202 --> 00:01:10.703
Answer in: 1

00:01:10.703 --> 00:01:13.012
Intuitively, it seems like a good deal.

00:01:13.012 --> 00:01:15.691
Since the detector 
is correct most of the time,

00:01:15.691 --> 00:01:18.549
shouldn’t you be able
to trust its reading?

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:20.232
Unfortunately, no.

00:01:20.232 --> 00:01:21.839
Here’s why.

00:01:21.839 --> 00:01:25.587
Imagine the mine 
has exactly 1,000 pieces of ore.

00:01:25.587 --> 00:01:28.499
An unobtainium rarity of 1%

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:32.933
means that there are only 10 rocks 
with the precious mineral inside.

00:01:32.933 --> 00:01:35.411
All 10 would set off the detector.

00:01:35.411 --> 00:01:39.862
But what about the other 990
rocks without unobtainium?

00:01:39.862 --> 00:01:43.962
Well, 90% of them,
891 rocks, to be exact,

00:01:43.962 --> 00:01:45.883
won’t set off anything.

00:01:45.883 --> 00:01:50.653
But 10%, or 99 rocks, 
will set off the detector

00:01:50.653 --> 00:01:53.093
despite not having unobtanium,

00:01:53.093 --> 00:01:56.281
a result known as a false positive.

00:01:56.281 --> 00:01:57.772
Why does that matter?

00:01:57.772 --> 00:01:59.409
Because it means that all in all,

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:02.832
109 rocks will have 
triggered the detector.

00:02:02.832 --> 00:02:05.543
And Joe’s rock could be any one of them,

00:02:05.543 --> 00:02:07.370
from the 10 that contain the mineral

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.511
to the 99 that don’t,

00:02:09.511 --> 00:02:16.683
which means the chances of it containing 
unobtainium are 10 out of 109 – about 9%.

00:02:16.683 --> 00:02:24.258
And paying $200 for a 9%
chance of getting $1000 isn’t great odds.

00:02:24.258 --> 00:02:27.029
So why is this result so unexpected,

00:02:27.029 --> 00:02:31.130
and why did Joe’s rock seem 
like such a sure bet?

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.253
The key is something called 
the base rate fallacy.

00:02:35.253 --> 00:02:39.113
While we’re focused on the relatively 
high accuracy of the detector,

00:02:39.113 --> 00:02:41.791
our intuition makes us forget to account

00:02:41.791 --> 00:02:45.872
for how rare the unobtanium 
was in the first place.

00:02:45.872 --> 00:02:48.702
But because the device’s error rate of 10%

00:02:48.702 --> 00:02:52.322
is still higher than 
the mineral’s overall occurrence,

00:02:52.322 --> 00:02:56.442
any time it goes off is still more likely 
to be a false positive

00:02:56.442 --> 00:02:58.592
than a real finding.

00:02:58.592 --> 00:03:02.053
This problem is an example 
of conditional probability.

00:03:02.053 --> 00:03:06.171
The answer lies neither in the overall 
chance of finding unobtainium,

00:03:06.171 --> 00:03:10.579
nor the overall chance 
of receiving a false positive reading.

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:15.032
This kind of background information 
that we’re given before anything happens

00:03:15.032 --> 00:03:19.733
is known as unconditional, 
or prior probability.

00:03:19.733 --> 00:03:23.380
What we’re looking for, though,
is the chance of finding unobtainium

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.094
once we know that the device did
return a positive reading.

00:03:27.094 --> 00:03:31.341
This is known as the conditional, 
or posterior probability,

00:03:31.341 --> 00:03:36.058
determined once the possibilities have 
been narrowed down through observation.

00:03:36.058 --> 00:03:39.843
Many people are confused 
by the false positive paradox

00:03:39.843 --> 00:03:43.542
because we have a bias 
for focusing on specific information

00:03:43.542 --> 00:03:45.313
over the more general,

00:03:45.313 --> 00:03:49.101
especially when immediate decisions 
come into play.

00:03:49.101 --> 00:03:52.733
And while in many cases 
it’s better to be safe than sorry,

00:03:52.733 --> 00:03:55.869
false positives can have 
real negative consequences.

00:03:55.869 --> 00:04:00.129
False positives in medical testing 
are preferable to false negatives,

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:04.183
but they can still lead to stress or
unnecessary treatment.

00:04:04.183 --> 00:04:06.379
And false positives in mass surveillance

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:11.054
can cause innocent people to be
wrongfully arrested, jailed, or worse.

00:04:11.054 --> 00:04:15.249
As for this case, the one thing 
you can be positive about

00:04:15.249 --> 00:04:18.682
is that Tricky Joe is trying 
to take you for a ride.
