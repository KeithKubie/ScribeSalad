00:00:03.162 --> 00:00:04.620
TOM: So my name is
Tom [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.990
I've been working here
at Google for a while

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.020
and working with mindfulness and
meditation programs for a while

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:11.320
as well.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.650
We've had the really
great opportunity

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.860
to host many wonderful
teachers of meditation,

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.380
and mindfulness, and Buddhist
practice over the years

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:19.900
at Google.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.160
And it's a great honor to
be able to extend tradition.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.550
And so with that
in mind, I'd like

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.050
to introduce Khenpo
Karten Rinpoche, who

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.994
is visiting us here from his
center down in Pacific Grove.

00:00:31.994 --> 00:00:35.240
He's got a wonderful
center very nearby.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.000
Khenpo Karten Rinpoche
has an illustrious career,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.880
having spent many of his years
in personal retreat, some

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.200
of that retreat given
to him as an assignment

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.470
by His Holiness the Dalai Lama.

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.650
And he is also traveling around
the world very extensively.

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:59.657
So he has a nice community here
in sort of the South Bay Area

00:00:59.657 --> 00:01:00.990
or whatever you want to call it.

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.040
But he also has
communities Southeast Asia

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.335
and other places
around the world.

00:01:09.335 --> 00:01:11.460
Just after this talk, he'll
be flying, for example,

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.290
to the East Coast.

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.005
And so if anybody listening
in Boston or New York,

00:01:15.005 --> 00:01:17.770
I believe Rinpoche has some
dates for upcoming teachings

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.760
in those places as well.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.900
I'd also to introduce David
Molk, who's our translator.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.160
David is also a really
wonderful and kind translator

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.910
of Tibetan work.

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.130
We're glad to have them
both here in our presence.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.700
Rinpoche will be
presenting a talk

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.410
on compassion and cooperation.

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.320
And so with that, I will
shut up and hand it over

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.150
to the people who actually know
what they're talking about.

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.406
Thanks everybody for coming.

00:01:40.406 --> 00:01:42.322
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
Good morning everyone.

00:01:44.835 --> 00:01:52.900
I thank you so much today
I am here with you all.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.010
Because this is Google.

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:57.970
I always use the Google.

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.650
I use a lot of Google always.

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:05.211
Sometimes when I [INAUDIBLE],
they give me the big questions.

00:02:05.211 --> 00:02:07.095
They say, I don't answer.

00:02:07.095 --> 00:02:09.180
[INAUDIBLE] check the Google.

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.914
But my English is not very good.

00:02:15.914 --> 00:02:19.718
I have a very good translator.

00:02:19.718 --> 00:02:26.560
Today I'm just here with you
about love and compassion.

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.270
And first you have to
know, I am from Tibet.

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.740
I am monk.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.770
I know only the dharma.

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:44.680
That's where today I talk
of the love and compassion

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.550
and how do we work together,
which is very, very important.

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.375
I'm really happy to talk today.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.504
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.990
DAVID MOLK: So this is
pretty much my first time

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:35.260
to have the opportunity
to speak at Google,

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.694
which is the worldwide famous,
known all over the world.

00:03:39.694 --> 00:03:45.150
I'm very happy to be here
and to meet you all today.

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.600
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:02.620
DAVID MOLK: And in
particular, this subject

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.820
of love and compassion
I find to be

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:09.874
something that's very important
for all of us and for you all.

00:04:09.874 --> 00:04:15.130
So I'm very happy especially
to talk on that subject.

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.060
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.030
DAVID MOLK: So in my own
practice of any kind of dharma

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.882
activity that I'm
going to undertake,

00:04:56.882 --> 00:05:01.846
I find it very important
to set a good motivation

00:05:01.846 --> 00:05:04.230
and intention.

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:10.520
And so I'm going to do that
now as I begin this talk.

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.370
And I'd like to ask all
of you and all those who

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.620
will see this over the
internet to take a moment

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:23.736
to set a good, altruistic,
positive, pure motivation.

00:05:23.736 --> 00:05:27.396
Because that is what will
really make this worthwhile,

00:05:27.396 --> 00:05:31.400
and productive, and fruitful.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.301
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:51.190
DAVID MOLK: So I want to
speak about how we develop,

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:53.250
how we work together
with love and compassion.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.070
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:06:19.147 --> 00:06:20.980
DAVID MOLK: So I thought
to organize my talk

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:25.950
in three categories, first, the
disadvantages and the drawbacks

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:29.125
of lack of compassion, the
problems that arise when there

00:06:29.125 --> 00:06:34.480
is a lack of love and compassion
between people, secondly,

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:37.920
the great advantages
and benefits of love

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:43.030
and compassion, and thirdly,
how love and compassion

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:44.010
can develop.

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:49.041
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:56.603
DAVID MOLK: First
of all, the benefits

00:06:56.603 --> 00:06:58.960
of love and compassion,
they're so important.

00:07:02.051 --> 00:07:03.800
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:29.890
DAVID MOLK: So myself,
being a Buddhist,

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:33.580
to say a word about it
in a Buddhist context,

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:36.180
in all the ways of
Buddhism, all the vehicles,

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:38.700
whether it's the
Theravadan or bodhisattvan

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:43.090
vehicle or the Tantric
practice, love and compassion

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:46.610
is really the basis
of the foundation

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:50.190
of all of Buddhist teachings.

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:53.310
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:07:58.682 --> 00:08:00.140
DAVID MOLK: So
something that is so

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:03.420
important in the context
of Buddhist teachings

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:07.520
is also extremely important
for the world at large.

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.630
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:42.809
DAVID MOLK: So a lot of
people may have the impression

00:08:42.809 --> 00:08:46.160
that compassion is something
you feel for others.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.300
It's other-focused.

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:50.850
It's something that's
for their benefit,

00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:54.570
not understanding that it's very
beneficial for the person who

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:57.566
develops that
compassion themselves.

00:08:57.566 --> 00:09:00.288
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:09:01.174 --> 00:09:02.590
DAVID MOLK: So
it's not like that.

00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:06.491
It's not just for
the sake of another.

00:09:06.491 --> 00:09:08.240
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:27.695
DAVID MOLK: Because when
someone genuinely develops

00:09:27.695 --> 00:09:31.990
love and compassion
in a very sincere way,

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:35.540
that actually brings great
happiness to that person

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:37.470
himself.

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:39.466
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:10:07.066 --> 00:10:08.590
DAVID MOLK: So the
problem is, when

00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:10.786
there's a lack of
love and compassion,

00:10:10.786 --> 00:10:15.210
is that a person becomes
too self-centered, too

00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:17.022
self-focused.

00:10:17.022 --> 00:10:19.970
They're unable to look outwards.

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:24.030
It's as if this closes the
door on their awareness

00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:28.602
to outer world and
other living beings.

00:10:28.602 --> 00:10:31.130
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:39.900
DAVID MOLK: So it's good
open, to widen our horizons,

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:44.570
to think in a more vast way.

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:46.360
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:27.530
DAVID MOLK: So when we
undergo great difficulties,

00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:32.650
painful situations, and so
on, then from the Buddhist

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:35.210
view-- in the
context of Buddhism,

00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:38.440
we see that as something
that we've created ourselves

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:39.380
in terms of karma.

00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:44.000
We've planted the
seeds for that.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.576
But if we just remain focused on
our problem and our suffering,

00:11:47.576 --> 00:11:50.956
we get angry about it,
get self-pitying about it,

00:11:50.956 --> 00:11:53.090
then OK, we've got one problem.

00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:56.047
But our mental attitude
is piling another problem

00:11:56.047 --> 00:11:59.176
on top of that.

00:11:59.176 --> 00:12:01.720
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:12:14.298 --> 00:12:17.670
DAVID MOLK: So we may
experience the same kinds

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:19.480
of sufferings and difficulties.

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:22.250
But to me, the big difference
is in the way that we handle

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:24.230
and the way that we
deal with it, especially

00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:29.390
if we a more vast, open
minded kind of perspective.

00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:31.710
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:16.310
DAVID MOLK: So when someone
is practicing Buddhism,

00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:18.840
there are different levels
at which it can be practiced.

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:21.915
And at the level of
the highest capacity,

00:13:21.915 --> 00:13:24.130
the person remains
very much focused

00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:32.950
on attainment of enlightenment
in a very short time

00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:34.580
or a short number of lifetimes.

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:40.550
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:13:49.066 --> 00:13:50.690
DAVID MOLK: Now the
power of their mind

00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:54.580
is really able to provide
happiness for them continually,

00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:58.695
both in this lifetime and into
the future lifetimes as well.

00:13:58.695 --> 00:14:00.445
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:14:00.445 --> 00:14:02.550
DAVID MOLK: So this
is the first level

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:05.300
in which that power of
the practice or the mind

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:08.470
enables a person to
maintain happiness

00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:10.401
in this and all lifetimes.

00:14:10.401 --> 00:14:12.150
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:14:47.259 --> 00:14:48.800
DAVID MOLK: So at
that highest level,

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:53.321
those problems never create
a problem or unhappiness

00:14:53.321 --> 00:14:54.195
for the practitioner.

00:14:54.195 --> 00:14:58.650
But at a minimum
level, then there's

00:14:58.650 --> 00:15:00.750
these special way
in which the person

00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:04.490
is able to deal with problems is
that they have a lot of tools,

00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:08.540
a lot of methods from the
teachings, which enables them

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:13.455
to transform what would be
difficult circumstances,

00:15:13.455 --> 00:15:17.080
bad conditions of various
types, into something that's

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:20.010
beneficial for their
spiritual path,

00:15:20.010 --> 00:15:24.410
to transform negative conditions
into positive conditions

00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:25.595
for their spiritual path.

00:15:25.595 --> 00:15:27.345
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:15:28.410 --> 00:15:30.910
DAVID MOLK: He said, the dharma
provides them with the tools

00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:31.930
to do that.

00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:35.380
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
Just like in food, OK,

00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:39.780
food-- when you get
hungry, you have to eat.

00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:41.110
Dharma is just like food.

00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:45.810
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:40.995
DAVID MOLK: And
at the very least,

00:16:40.995 --> 00:16:44.340
the dharma should
provide a person

00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:49.476
with means of dealing with
difficulties and problems

00:16:49.476 --> 00:16:51.350
to at least the point
where they don't become

00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:53.760
so overwhelming to
the person that they

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:55.820
feel like they've
got to end their life

00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:59.380
or something like that.

00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:04.430
It gives them means by which
to prevent such an outcome, so

00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:08.040
to be able to deal with it.

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:10.560
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:19.109
DAVID MOLK: And so people
in such situations,

00:17:19.109 --> 00:17:22.579
they don't know where to look
for protection or refuge.

00:17:22.579 --> 00:17:27.930
They seek it in outside
things like alcohol or drugs.

00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:30.350
And so this kind
of outcome is what

00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:34.930
at least should be the benefit
of having the basis of a dharma

00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:36.624
practice, teachings of Buddha.

00:17:36.624 --> 00:17:38.790
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE: I'm
not talking [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:41.430
I'm not talking about
the dharma here.

00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:46.603
I just talking about here love
and compassion, compassion.

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:53.350
I don't know what the
translate to English.

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:56.770
I don't know what this
compassion mean, OK?

00:17:56.770 --> 00:18:02.960
In Tibetan, we call
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:06.050
When I use these words,
they make me cry.

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:10.540
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:33.490
DAVID MOLK: So the
word in Tibetan

00:18:33.490 --> 00:18:36.660
compassion, [SPEAKING TIBETAN],
and [SPEAKING TIBETAN],

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:42.690
great compassion, when I
think about great compassion,

00:18:42.690 --> 00:18:44.320
this really is very emotional.

00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:48.290
It brings a lot of-- it
brings tears in my eyes.

00:18:48.290 --> 00:18:50.720
But we can think
about compassion

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:55.250
in its relative sense,
when on the relative level,

00:18:55.250 --> 00:18:59.526
the feeling of empathy and wish
to free others from suffering.

00:18:59.526 --> 00:19:00.900
But when we say
great compassion,

00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:03.500
then that brings
to my mind a sense

00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:08.240
of ultimate, ultimate
great compassion, which

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:13.220
is connected with
understanding of selflessness,

00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:18.390
ultimate truth, and entities of
Buddha and [SPEAKING TIBETAN].

00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:21.420
So then great compassion
I think of as conjoined

00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:26.150
with that understanding
of ultimate truth.

00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:28.090
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:40.810
DAVID MOLK: But now I
want to bring my remarks

00:19:40.810 --> 00:19:43.250
more specifically to love
and compassion, which

00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:45.970
is not something that's
exclusive to the teachings

00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:47.891
of Buddha.

00:19:47.891 --> 00:19:49.640
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:54.000
DAVID MOLK: Whatever
you want in the world

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.640
needs these qualities
of love and compassion.

00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:59.930
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:26.930
DAVID MOLK: So in, again,
the contest of Buddhism

00:20:26.930 --> 00:20:30.162
and the importance of
love and compassion,

00:20:30.162 --> 00:20:34.390
there's a quotation from the
great Indian master Shantideva,

00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:38.920
where he talks about how all
the happiness that arises

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:39.600
in the world--

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:41.365
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:20:42.355 --> 00:20:47.314
DAVID MOLK: --that arises from
the wish for others' happiness,

00:20:47.314 --> 00:20:49.900
love, wishing others happiness.

00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:53.213
And I want to draw from that
quotation in what I say here.

00:20:56.901 --> 00:20:58.650
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:21:17.910 --> 00:21:22.280
DAVID MOLK: So that
quotation in full

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:25.760
says that all the happiness
that exists in the world

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:29.170
arises from wishing others
happiness, from the love,

00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:31.240
wishing others happiness.

00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:35.080
And all the suffering
that exists in the world

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:37.480
arises from the
self-centered, seeking

00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:40.880
only one's own happiness.

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:44.100
So there's not a
need to say much.

00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:46.380
Just look at the Buddhas
who are dedicated

00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:49.660
to the welfare of
others as opposed

00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:54.510
to ordinary limited beings
who act in an immature way

00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:57.616
and seek only
their own happiness

00:21:57.616 --> 00:21:58.770
and wander in suffering.

00:21:58.770 --> 00:22:01.211
Just look at the difference.

00:22:01.211 --> 00:22:02.960
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:22:39.861 --> 00:22:42.290
DAVID MOLK: So to take
the example from Buddhism,

00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:44.910
bodhisattvas such
as His Holiness

00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:46.790
the Dalai Lama
living in this world

00:22:46.790 --> 00:22:51.440
today, the fact that he can
remain in a happy state of mind

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:57.650
and provide so much
and happiness to others

00:22:57.650 --> 00:23:00.320
is a result of
this being focused

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:06.470
on the welfare of others, having
given up self-centeredness

00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:08.400
and selfishness.

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:11.841
Because of this
altruistic mind, he

00:23:11.841 --> 00:23:14.610
remains in a state of happiness
and able to bring so much

00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:17.180
happiness to others.

00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:18.930
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:23:52.502 --> 00:23:53.960
DAVID MOLK: But as
for the opposite

00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:57.245
of that, which we see
so much this world today

00:23:57.245 --> 00:24:00.780
in our own experience
and in other worse

00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:03.770
realms of existence,
all those sufferings

00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:07.790
that arise come from this
self-centered attitude,

00:24:07.790 --> 00:24:14.020
the selfish attitude, which
then causes people to look down

00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:19.540
on others and disparage
others, and then on that basis

00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:21.160
create negative karma.

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:25.320
And it causes so much suffering.

00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:27.480
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:24:57.090 --> 00:24:59.740
DAVID MOLK: And in the
world in general and here,

00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:04.180
no matter what
situation you look at,

00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:08.690
happiness can't really be
sustained by ones self alone.

00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:11.460
We're all interconnected.

00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:15.150
And the only way that the
welfare of any one person

00:25:15.150 --> 00:25:20.005
can arise is in
dependence upon others.

00:25:20.005 --> 00:25:22.305
So especially in
this world today

00:25:22.305 --> 00:25:24.570
in which we're so
interconnected,

00:25:24.570 --> 00:25:26.690
all of their happiness
depends on others.

00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:31.277
It's as if we've
become big family.

00:25:31.277 --> 00:25:33.026
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:36.236
DAVID MOLK: So to take
the example of a merchant

00:26:36.236 --> 00:26:37.861
or someone who's
selling things or even

00:26:37.861 --> 00:26:44.710
to take the example
of Google, in order--

00:26:44.710 --> 00:26:46.410
it's not possible
for just a few people

00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:48.910
to create this
completely on their own.

00:26:48.910 --> 00:26:51.660
There needs to be people
who want that service, who

00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:53.410
want those goods.

00:26:53.410 --> 00:26:55.954
And in the case of
Google, there are

00:26:55.954 --> 00:26:59.141
millions of people who
use and look at it.

00:26:59.141 --> 00:27:05.750
And that then brings benefit
to the works and people

00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:07.270
involved with Google as well.

00:27:07.270 --> 00:27:13.750
So there's a great benefit
for ones self and others.

00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:14.904
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:27:14.904 --> 00:27:16.654
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:29.140
DAVID MOLK: And
to think about it

00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:34.490
in a vaster sense of the world
that all of our happiness

00:27:34.490 --> 00:27:38.380
depends upon others.

00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:45.012
So yes, there is effort that
we need to put forth ourselves,

00:27:45.012 --> 00:27:47.642
maybe a good percentage of it.

00:27:47.642 --> 00:27:49.350
But if it was just
all left to ourselves,

00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:51.110
we wouldn't be
able to manage it.

00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:56.480
The success depends upon others.

00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:59.000
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:14.250
DAVID MOLK: So how can these
qualities be developed?

00:28:14.250 --> 00:28:18.490
How can we go about developing
love and compassion?

00:28:18.490 --> 00:28:21.190
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:41.994
DAVID MOLK: So there
are two ways in Buddhism

00:28:41.994 --> 00:28:43.330
for this development.

00:28:43.330 --> 00:28:46.690
And I'm going to focus
on one of them, which

00:28:46.690 --> 00:28:50.090
uses the example of
oneself to understand

00:28:50.090 --> 00:28:52.480
others and understand
that just as oneself

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:56.240
doesn't want to experience
suffering, so it is for others.

00:28:56.240 --> 00:29:00.960
Just as oneself would like
to experience happiness,

00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:04.885
understand it's just
the same for others.

00:29:04.885 --> 00:29:06.635
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:29:13.010 --> 00:29:17.235
DAVID MOLK: So in our own case,
we're completely sure, 100%,

00:29:17.235 --> 00:29:19.199
that we don't want
problems, suffering.

00:29:19.199 --> 00:29:23.127
We want happiness
and fulfillment.

00:29:23.127 --> 00:29:26.060
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:29:29.726 --> 00:29:32.340
DAVID MOLK: So the fact is
that every living creature

00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:36.098
has exactly that same attitude.

00:29:36.098 --> 00:29:39.050
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:30:07.025 --> 00:30:10.055
DAVID MOLK: So the first
step is to open our mind

00:30:10.055 --> 00:30:13.430
to this kind of understanding
that that is true,

00:30:13.430 --> 00:30:16.330
that just as I want happiness
and don't want suffering,

00:30:16.330 --> 00:30:21.370
that is completely true for
another and for all others.

00:30:21.370 --> 00:30:23.552
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:58.720
DAVID MOLK: So that in itself
can prevent a lot of problems.

00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:03.260
When we get an urge to
strike out at someone else

00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:06.910
or to hurt another,
there's no other means

00:31:06.910 --> 00:31:09.840
necessary like meditation
or recitation of a mantra,

00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:11.615
but just simply to
bring that thought

00:31:11.615 --> 00:31:14.640
to mind that, oh, this person
doesn't want suffering.

00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:18.640
This person wants happiness
just as much as I do.

00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:23.690
And that very awareness, it can
bring a stop to that impulse

00:31:23.690 --> 00:31:26.880
to strike out and harm another.

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:29.280
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:32:10.530 --> 00:32:15.120
DAVID MOLK: So then by
contemplating that continually

00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:17.520
and thinking both
about the benefits that

00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:22.456
derive from warm, harmonious,
compassionate mind attitude

00:32:22.456 --> 00:32:27.070
towards others as
well as the drawbacks

00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:29.970
and the great problems
that arise from maintaining

00:32:29.970 --> 00:32:34.560
a selfish,
self-centered attitude,

00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:41.186
continually contemplating the
pros and cons of that, then

00:32:41.186 --> 00:32:48.420
along with that, then
bring it into whereas

00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:52.640
how it relates to
others, and realizing

00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:55.006
that they don't want suffering.

00:32:55.006 --> 00:32:58.986
And they have these same kinds
of problems and dynamics.

00:32:58.986 --> 00:33:03.366
And so to bring that into the
way that one relates to others,

00:33:03.366 --> 00:33:06.910
you'll be more kind to.

00:33:06.910 --> 00:33:08.660
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:49.990
DAVID MOLK: So the work
that we do is not easy.

00:33:49.990 --> 00:33:53.150
And also this development
of love and compassion

00:33:53.150 --> 00:33:55.340
is not something
that's very easy to do.

00:33:55.340 --> 00:33:59.660
So it takes continual
perseverance and patience.

00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:04.080
There needs to be a lot
of patience, forbearance

00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:09.006
for developing these attitudes
and working with others.

00:34:09.006 --> 00:34:12.213
So patience really
need to be there as

00:34:12.213 --> 00:34:17.834
like a foundation or a great
aid to the development of love

00:34:17.834 --> 00:34:19.340
and compassion.

00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:21.695
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:31.429
DAVID MOLK: So it's
like the container that

00:34:31.429 --> 00:34:34.840
needs to be there to hold,
or the enclosure there

00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:37.790
that needs to be there in
order to support that love

00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:39.878
and compassion.

00:34:39.878 --> 00:34:42.352
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:18.050
DAVID MOLK: So in the context
of the vows of a bodhisattva,

00:35:18.050 --> 00:35:20.675
there's a very
strong determination

00:35:20.675 --> 00:35:24.530
that I'm not going to do
anything to harm others.

00:35:24.530 --> 00:35:28.720
And if at all possible,
I'm going to help them.

00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:29.870
I'm going to benefit them.

00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:33.650
So there needs to be this kind
of determination and patience

00:35:33.650 --> 00:35:37.850
that's behind maintaining,
developing this attitude.

00:35:37.850 --> 00:35:39.600
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:35:40.696 --> 00:35:42.550
DAVID MOLK: So
patience, forbearance

00:35:42.550 --> 00:35:44.940
is something
extremely important.

00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:48.440
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:36:22.456 --> 00:36:23.830
DAVID MOLK: So
patience can apply

00:36:23.830 --> 00:36:28.450
in a lot of different areas,
patience towards an enemy,

00:36:28.450 --> 00:36:34.590
patience towards dharma and
spiritual development, patience

00:36:34.590 --> 00:36:37.010
in the work that
you're doing to serve

00:36:37.010 --> 00:36:39.890
others, which is not easy.

00:36:39.890 --> 00:36:44.890
It takes a lot of patience
to do that hard work

00:36:44.890 --> 00:36:47.940
for the benefit of others.

00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:51.710
So that's a very
valid form of patience

00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:54.330
and valuable form of patience.

00:36:54.330 --> 00:37:00.125
There can be patience for
people that annoy you,

00:37:00.125 --> 00:37:04.620
that make you angry, and so on.

00:37:04.620 --> 00:37:07.440
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:18.680
DAVID MOLK: So it's said
in the teachings of Buddha

00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:22.510
that patience is the
greatest of austerities.

00:37:22.510 --> 00:37:25.480
It's one of the most
difficult practices,

00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:32.270
one of the most difficult
practices to maintain.

00:37:32.270 --> 00:37:38.015
So it's a great austerity to
be able to practice patience.

00:37:38.015 --> 00:37:40.370
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:38:02.135 --> 00:38:04.780
DAVID MOLK: He said, without
anybody to annoy you,

00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:06.860
then who are you going
to be patient with?

00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:08.440
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:11.532
You know, if everyone's just
fine and having a great time,

00:38:11.532 --> 00:38:14.310
then how am I going to persevere
in developing this love

00:38:14.310 --> 00:38:14.945
and compassion?

00:38:14.945 --> 00:38:19.020
What kind of challenges
is that going to present?

00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:20.891
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:38:36.504 --> 00:38:37.920
DAVID MOLK: So
love and compassion

00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:39.640
is something that
needs to be developed

00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:42.296
in place of hatred and anger.

00:38:42.296 --> 00:38:46.620
So it needs to displace those.

00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:49.470
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:02.480
DAVID MOLK: And so
in that case, then

00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:05.490
we need to be able to develop
love and compassion for someone

00:39:05.490 --> 00:39:10.190
who is an adversary, someone
who provokes that anger

00:39:10.190 --> 00:39:11.641
and hatred in us.

00:39:11.641 --> 00:39:13.390
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:45.460
DAVID MOLK: Then so--
[SPEAKING TIBETAN].

00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:48.050
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
[SPEAKING TIBETAN] He forget.

00:39:48.050 --> 00:39:50.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:56.606 --> 00:39:57.772
DAVID MOLK: Simple to learn.

00:40:01.252 --> 00:40:04.855
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE: He needs
to hear, as he [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:04.855 --> 00:40:05.829
Anyway--

00:40:05.829 --> 00:40:07.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:09.850
DAVID MOLK: [SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.750
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:26.540
DAVID MOLK: So to support
that development of love

00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:31.685
and compassion, there definitely
needs to be this patience

00:40:31.685 --> 00:40:37.970
and perseverance to develop it-

00:40:37.970 --> 00:40:39.720
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:40.821
DAVID MOLK: --from
starting right

00:40:40.821 --> 00:40:42.585
in with those around
you, your family

00:40:42.585 --> 00:40:45.710
and your close associates.

00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:49.140
So not getting angry with
enemies-- and that also

00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:52.833
needs to start right at home to
keep that patience and loving

00:40:52.833 --> 00:40:56.920
attitude right towards the
relations in one own family.

00:40:56.920 --> 00:40:59.405
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:41:25.389 --> 00:41:26.180
DAVID MOLK: Think--

00:41:26.180 --> 00:41:28.641
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE: Think--

00:41:28.641 --> 00:41:29.557
DAVID MOLK: Globally--

00:41:29.557 --> 00:41:31.832
KHENPO KARTEN
RINPOCHE: --globally.

00:41:31.832 --> 00:41:32.540
DAVID MOLK: Act--

00:41:32.540 --> 00:41:34.264
KHENPO KARTEN
RINPOCHE: Act locally.

00:41:34.264 --> 00:41:35.980
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:38.145 --> 00:41:40.456
DAVID MOLK: So he really
likes this phrase,

00:41:40.456 --> 00:41:43.230
think globally, act locally.

00:41:43.230 --> 00:41:45.756
We want to keep our
intentions very, very vast.

00:41:45.756 --> 00:41:47.270
That's what we're intending.

00:41:47.270 --> 00:41:50.380
But where to start with it
is right in our own vicinity

00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:53.621
and our own family as well.

00:41:53.621 --> 00:41:55.370
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:10.330
DAVID MOLK: So we need to
develop this within ourselves

00:42:10.330 --> 00:42:12.280
first.

00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:15.705
And then from there, it can
spread out through the world.

00:42:15.705 --> 00:42:17.455
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:51.600
DAVID MOLK: So this needs to
be practiced in the family

00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:52.230
to begin with.

00:42:52.230 --> 00:42:56.340
And if there is love and caring
between parents and members

00:42:56.340 --> 00:42:59.000
of a family, then it can
spread to the neighbors.

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:00.825
It can spread to the vicinity.

00:43:00.825 --> 00:43:03.970
It can spread to the country.

00:43:03.970 --> 00:43:05.580
And this is really
they only way.

00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:08.590
Because lacking inner
peace ourselves,

00:43:08.590 --> 00:43:11.390
if we want to try to provide
inner peace for the world,

00:43:11.390 --> 00:43:13.402
there's no way that's
going to happen.

00:43:19.570 --> 00:43:22.010
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:43:45.930 --> 00:43:47.440
DAVID MOLK: Now
when we trace back

00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:49.821
the root cause of all
the different conflicts

00:43:49.821 --> 00:43:52.775
and sufferings that
exist in the world,

00:43:52.775 --> 00:43:55.085
they really do trace
back to this lack

00:43:55.085 --> 00:43:59.962
of caring between people, lack
of love, lack of compassion.

00:43:59.962 --> 00:44:03.364
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:32.800
DAVID MOLK: So there needs
to be this kind of attitude

00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:36.520
to alleviate problems in the
world, in our own country,

00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:40.270
and around the world--
this understanding

00:44:40.270 --> 00:44:45.316
that others have exactly
the same wish for happiness

00:44:45.316 --> 00:44:50.310
and wish to avoid suffering and
be free of problems as I do,

00:44:50.310 --> 00:44:54.910
and I'm going to do my
very best to help them.

00:44:54.910 --> 00:44:56.570
And even if I can't,
then at least,

00:44:56.570 --> 00:44:59.310
I'm not going to harm them.

00:44:59.310 --> 00:45:03.566
And keep this kind of
determination and commitment.

00:45:03.566 --> 00:45:05.560
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:27.343
DAVID MOLK: And so if peace
is going to come in the world,

00:45:27.343 --> 00:45:29.690
it will need to
come in this way.

00:45:29.690 --> 00:45:31.370
It can't come from outside.

00:45:31.370 --> 00:45:35.190
It has to be developed
within ourselves.

00:45:35.190 --> 00:45:36.940
And when it is developed
within ourselves,

00:45:36.940 --> 00:45:38.720
then there's the
real possibility

00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:40.490
that it can spread to the world.

00:45:40.490 --> 00:45:45.670
And if we do this, some
time in the future,

00:45:45.670 --> 00:45:49.510
there will actually
be peace on earth.

00:45:49.510 --> 00:45:51.260
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:46:20.470 --> 00:46:24.490
DAVID MOLK: So in the practice
of the teachings of Buddha,

00:46:24.490 --> 00:46:26.810
we develop a
feeling of closeness

00:46:26.810 --> 00:46:30.850
and warmth towards others just
as if they were our closest

00:46:30.850 --> 00:46:33.920
relations such as our mother.

00:46:33.920 --> 00:46:37.896
And even in recitations,
we'll refer to all living

00:46:37.896 --> 00:46:40.140
beings as our mother.

00:46:40.140 --> 00:46:42.650
In other words, in Tibetan,
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]--

00:46:42.650 --> 00:46:47.545
all sentient beings are my
mother, who have been mother.

00:46:47.545 --> 00:46:52.330
And so even if we don't
contemplate that deeply,

00:46:52.330 --> 00:46:54.880
to just say the
words, to me, they're

00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:59.320
very powerful words to bring
in that sense of that closest

00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:04.611
relationship with other living
beings, no matter who they are.

00:47:04.611 --> 00:47:06.360
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:47:41.850 --> 00:47:45.980
DAVID MOLK: So it's so
obvious, all the problems

00:47:45.980 --> 00:47:49.170
that come about, that
develop in the world

00:47:49.170 --> 00:47:52.100
because of lack of
caring, lack of compassion

00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:53.745
and love for others.

00:47:57.020 --> 00:48:02.430
But if we do practice this
development of love and caring

00:48:02.430 --> 00:48:07.540
for others, then as
I mentioned before,

00:48:07.540 --> 00:48:11.220
as for how much direct
benefit it brings to others,

00:48:11.220 --> 00:48:14.130
that may be something
to be investigated.

00:48:14.130 --> 00:48:15.980
But as far as the
way it makes you

00:48:15.980 --> 00:48:19.690
feel when you have a great
feeling of love and compassion

00:48:19.690 --> 00:48:21.990
for others, you will
feel very happy.

00:48:21.990 --> 00:48:24.975
You will bring great happiness
and peace to yourself.

00:48:27.490 --> 00:48:29.240
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:48:55.690 --> 00:48:58.810
DAVID MOLK: We need to recognize
this essential importance

00:48:58.810 --> 00:49:02.240
of love and compassion,
that when it's there,

00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:06.155
it provides happiness for
the person who has it it.

00:49:06.155 --> 00:49:09.910
It makes them much more
able to benefit others.

00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:14.560
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:16.310
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:49:18.936 --> 00:49:21.020
DAVID MOLK: It
leads to happiness

00:49:21.020 --> 00:49:25.420
in the short term, in the
long run, in this lifetime,

00:49:25.420 --> 00:49:28.260
and all lifetimes.

00:49:28.260 --> 00:49:32.401
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
[SPEAKING TIBETAN] Time?

00:49:32.401 --> 00:49:33.323
TOM: 10 minutes.

00:49:33.323 --> 00:49:34.245
KHENPO KARTEN
RINPOCHE: 10 minutes?

00:49:34.245 --> 00:49:34.744
Oh.

00:49:38.910 --> 00:49:40.275
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:50:20.210 --> 00:50:22.840
DAVID MOLK: So developing
love and compassion

00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:26.200
can very much enhance our
work and the effectiveness

00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:30.340
of the work that you do here.

00:50:30.340 --> 00:50:34.890
And it really needs to
be supported by patience.

00:50:34.890 --> 00:50:38.145
When someone annoys you or
with someone you don't like,

00:50:38.145 --> 00:50:41.422
you need to be able to practice
that patience and forbearance

00:50:41.422 --> 00:50:46.112
in order to continually develop
the love and compassion.

00:50:46.112 --> 00:50:47.870
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:51:29.010 --> 00:51:32.666
DAVID MOLK: So as for
these words in English,

00:51:32.666 --> 00:51:35.216
love and compassion,
I don't know

00:51:35.216 --> 00:51:36.870
how much power they convey.

00:51:36.870 --> 00:51:40.372
But in Tibetan, when we speak
of love, [SPEAKING TIBETAN],

00:51:40.372 --> 00:51:42.100
and compassion,
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]--

00:51:42.100 --> 00:51:44.010
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:51:44.505 --> 00:51:46.130
DAVID MOLK: Much
better names, he says.

00:51:46.130 --> 00:51:48.622
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
Is Tibetan names for love.

00:51:48.622 --> 00:51:49.580
I don't know how much--

00:51:49.580 --> 00:51:50.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:50.020 --> 00:51:51.645
DAVID MOLK: But in
the context of the--

00:51:51.645 --> 00:51:53.806
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:57.210 --> 00:52:00.270
In the context of
the teachings, these

00:52:00.270 --> 00:52:02.710
are so fundamental,
so important.

00:52:02.710 --> 00:52:06.010
They bring so much to my
mind to think about them.

00:52:06.010 --> 00:52:09.150
In the context of one
type of meditation called

00:52:09.150 --> 00:52:11.220
the sevenfold cause
and effect meditation,

00:52:11.220 --> 00:52:14.570
we begin with recognizing
other living thins no matter

00:52:14.570 --> 00:52:20.254
who they are as one's closest
relation such as one's mother--

00:52:20.254 --> 00:52:22.720
and then thinking
about the kindness

00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:27.220
that we receive from the mother,
wishing to repay that kindness,

00:52:27.220 --> 00:52:29.635
developing loving kindness
and compassion passion,

00:52:29.635 --> 00:52:33.076
and then a sense of
universal responsibility

00:52:33.076 --> 00:52:35.200
followed by a wish to attain
enlightenment in order

00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:37.930
to be able to liberate
all living beings,

00:52:37.930 --> 00:52:42.340
and then finally that
conjoining of an understanding

00:52:42.340 --> 00:52:45.270
of ultimate truth, selflessness.

00:52:45.270 --> 00:52:48.890
All of this is
fundamentally centered

00:52:48.890 --> 00:52:51.430
around development of
love and compassion.

00:52:51.430 --> 00:52:54.530
It really derives from that.

00:52:54.530 --> 00:52:56.280
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:53:05.610 --> 00:53:08.360
DAVID MOLK: So it's really
the most admired quality

00:53:08.360 --> 00:53:12.250
and realization in the
teachings of Buddha, including

00:53:12.250 --> 00:53:14.370
the Tantras,
there's nothing that

00:53:14.370 --> 00:53:17.180
surpasses these qualities
of caring, love,

00:53:17.180 --> 00:53:19.620
and compassion for others.

00:53:19.620 --> 00:53:21.370
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:53:58.270 --> 00:54:01.295
DAVID MOLK: So it's in
our hands to understand

00:54:01.295 --> 00:54:05.260
that anyone thinking that
they're just going to get ahead

00:54:05.260 --> 00:54:09.330
by themselves, profit on their
own separate from others,

00:54:09.330 --> 00:54:13.750
just does not work in
this world anymore.

00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:18.011
We're totally interconnected
like one family

00:54:18.011 --> 00:54:22.466
unit with all this mutual love
and compassion for each other.

00:54:25.465 --> 00:54:26.840
KHENPO KARTEN
RINPOCHE: How many?

00:54:26.840 --> 00:54:28.298
TOM: Five minutes.

00:54:28.298 --> 00:54:29.950
KHENPO KARTEN
RINPOCHE: Five minutes.

00:54:29.950 --> 00:54:32.218
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:56:01.270 --> 00:56:04.690
DAVID MOLK: So in the work
that you do here-- you know,

00:56:04.690 --> 00:56:06.640
I don't know where
to find Google

00:56:06.640 --> 00:56:09.230
and where to point to and
say, this is Google here.

00:56:09.230 --> 00:56:12.280
Today, it's as if I've come
into contact with Google.

00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:13.900
So here you are.

00:56:13.900 --> 00:56:17.220
So my kind of advice
is some people

00:56:17.220 --> 00:56:20.910
who are involved with
connecting the world

00:56:20.910 --> 00:56:23.140
and bringing that
interconnection

00:56:23.140 --> 00:56:26.900
awareness-- to try to bring this
attitude of love and compassion

00:56:26.900 --> 00:56:33.815
into that to help promote
those kinds of qualities

00:56:33.815 --> 00:56:35.150
throughout the world.

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:39.750
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:57:18.140 --> 00:57:22.158
DAVID MOLK: So these tools that
connect people in the world,

00:57:22.158 --> 00:57:26.810
like Facebook, are very
beneficial to bringing

00:57:26.810 --> 00:57:29.210
that connection
and the possibility

00:57:29.210 --> 00:57:30.860
of developing love
and compassion.

00:57:30.860 --> 00:57:33.650
And as I said
before, in your work

00:57:33.650 --> 00:57:36.970
here, to bring to mind
these kinds of things

00:57:36.970 --> 00:57:40.117
that he was talking
about of how beings

00:57:40.117 --> 00:57:41.825
want happiness, and
don't want suffering,

00:57:41.825 --> 00:57:46.620
and everyone is alike in
that, and to bring that kind

00:57:46.620 --> 00:57:50.020
of a quality to the work.

00:57:50.020 --> 00:57:52.210
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
[SPEAKING TIBETAN] Example,

00:57:52.210 --> 00:57:57.756
OK-- like one example-- I have
my own Facebook [INAUDIBLE].

00:58:00.340 --> 00:58:04.190
My Facebook is main use
to be dharma center.

00:58:04.190 --> 00:58:08.160
And my center's name is
[INAUDIBLE] Dharma Center.

00:58:08.160 --> 00:58:12.200
I always [INAUDIBLE]
some mine teaching

00:58:12.200 --> 00:58:14.450
and some other
teachers who teachings

00:58:14.450 --> 00:58:17.260
sort of like the Dalai Lama.

00:58:17.260 --> 00:58:22.710
Then two years ago, I went to
the monastery in [INAUDIBLE].

00:58:22.710 --> 00:58:26.530
The [INAUDIBLE]
say-- I said to them,

00:58:26.530 --> 00:58:31.860
because I meet them, so sorry,
so sorry, I never meet you.

00:58:31.860 --> 00:58:33.920
You know, it is so long.

00:58:33.920 --> 00:58:36.590
Because I are here, and
they really want to see me.

00:58:36.590 --> 00:58:39.000
They say, oh, it's OK.

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:42.246
I every day see your Facebook.

00:58:42.246 --> 00:58:46.630
Your Facebook is
your dharma center.

00:58:46.630 --> 00:58:48.200
That make me very happy.

00:58:50.930 --> 00:58:53.415
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:59:35.396 --> 00:59:37.270
DAVID MOLK: So I think
we can think of Google

00:59:37.270 --> 00:59:38.920
as an emanation of Buddha.

00:59:38.920 --> 00:59:40.070
[LAUGHTER]

00:59:40.070 --> 00:59:41.730
Emanations of Buddha
don't necessarily

00:59:41.730 --> 00:59:45.913
need to be human beings that
are walking around on two legs.

00:59:45.913 --> 00:59:48.751
They can be all
kinds of varieties.

00:59:48.751 --> 00:59:52.150
They can be artisans.

00:59:52.150 --> 00:59:55.480
It can be-- [SPEAKING TIBETAN].

00:59:55.480 --> 00:59:57.230
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

00:59:57.230 --> 01:00:00.580
DAVID MOLK: It can
be inanimate objects.

01:00:00.580 --> 01:00:02.841
So when Google is used for--

01:00:02.841 --> 01:00:04.590
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

01:00:07.110 --> 01:00:09.220
DAVID MOLK: So he said
that a Buddha could emanate

01:00:09.220 --> 01:00:12.690
as a bridge, a huge bridge
that would enable people to get

01:00:12.690 --> 01:00:14.964
across the body of water.

01:00:14.964 --> 01:00:16.630
So in this way, I
think we can certainly

01:00:16.630 --> 01:00:20.800
think of Google as being an
emanation of Buddha when it's

01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:22.784
used for these
purposes of developing

01:00:22.784 --> 01:00:25.230
harmony and a sense
of interconnectedness

01:00:25.230 --> 01:00:26.752
in the world.

01:00:26.752 --> 01:00:29.374
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

01:00:32.310 --> 01:00:35.900
DAVID MOLK: But how we use
it, it's very important.

01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:39.653
We need to be very careful
with how we use such a tool.

01:00:45.550 --> 01:00:47.861
TOM: Any last words?

01:00:47.861 --> 01:00:49.610
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

01:00:51.684 --> 01:00:53.600
DAVID MOLK: I remember
he did say before, too,

01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:55.826
that he was very happy
to have this opportunity

01:00:55.826 --> 01:00:59.200
to give us a bit of an
induction to the ideas

01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:03.730
of Buddhist teachings
in this context.

01:01:03.730 --> 01:01:05.580
KHENPO KARTEN RINPOCHE:
[SPEAKING TIBETAN]

01:01:46.857 --> 01:01:49.440
DAVID MOLK: So I want to thank
you from the depths of my heart

01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:52.530
for this opportunity
to address you here

01:01:52.530 --> 01:01:58.140
and the people who've
seen Google for this hour.

01:01:58.140 --> 01:02:02.500
As always, when I speak
about the teachings,

01:02:02.500 --> 01:02:06.556
I'm not sure how much it will
benefit you to hear them.

01:02:06.556 --> 01:02:08.180
Because people have
all different sorts

01:02:08.180 --> 01:02:10.150
of ideas and thoughts.

01:02:10.150 --> 01:02:12.880
But for me, when I
have the opportunity

01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:15.460
to speak on these
subjects and to do it

01:02:15.460 --> 01:02:21.340
with a very pure,
altruistic motivation,

01:02:21.340 --> 01:02:23.850
then it's so beneficial for me.

01:02:23.850 --> 01:02:27.961
So again, I want to thank you
very much for this opportunity.

01:02:27.961 --> 01:02:29.960
TOM: Thank you so much
for being here, Rinpoche.

01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:32.490
I think I can say on
behalf of all of us

01:02:32.490 --> 01:02:35.040
from the bottom of our
hearts how grateful we

01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:37.240
are that you have graced
us with your presence

01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:39.850
and with your wisdom today.

01:02:39.850 --> 01:02:40.820
Thank you for coming.

01:02:40.820 --> 01:02:44.164
We hope that you can come
back sometime in the future.

01:02:44.164 --> 01:02:45.580
KHENPO KARTEN
RINPOCHE: Thank you.

01:02:45.580 --> 01:02:47.121
TOM: And thanks also
to David for all

01:02:47.121 --> 01:02:49.940
of your work in translating
and to everyone else

01:02:49.940 --> 01:02:51.240
for coming today.

01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:55.580
And may we just take 30
seconds and think about all

01:02:55.580 --> 01:02:59.700
of our connections in our
work life, in our home life,

01:02:59.700 --> 01:03:01.980
and in this world
and think about them,

01:03:01.980 --> 01:03:04.730
perhaps benefiting
from these things

01:03:04.730 --> 01:03:08.830
that we've learned today--
patience that we may

01:03:08.830 --> 01:03:11.900
act locally and think globally.

01:03:11.900 --> 01:03:13.750
Thank you.
