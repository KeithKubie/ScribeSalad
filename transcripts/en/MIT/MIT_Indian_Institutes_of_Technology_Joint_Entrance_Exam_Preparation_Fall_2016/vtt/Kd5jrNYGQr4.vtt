00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.020
Hi!

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:03.020
I'm Pritish

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:05.500
Today, we will be talking about Trigonometry.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.639
This is the first video on Trigonometry.

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:13.590
I would like to start with "Why do we want
to study Trigonometry?"

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.990
and "What is Trigonometry?"

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:22.350
You would certainly know that Euclidean geometry
is very fundamental to how we think about

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.150
nature.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.770
The way we visualize things in Physics, for
example, we use Euclidean geometry in the

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:31.090
way we think.

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:39.250
And often, Euclidean geometry requires some
amount of innovative thinking to reason about

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:40.590
problems.

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.809
And often when you want to talk about Physics,
you don't want geometry to be

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:49.010
your bottleneck in thinking about Physics.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:59.239
So Trigonometry and Coordinate Geometry are
two subjects which try to make a more systematic

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:06.740
study of Geometry.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.700
And what is "Trigonometry"?

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:26.110
Trigonometry is about a study of angles
in an "algebraic" way.

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.299
You would feel more comfortable doing Algebra

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:37.069
Algebra is something you can do in a more
mechanical way.

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:43.069
Whereas, Geometry often requires an innovative
leap.

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:48.130
Using trigonometry, you'll be able to reason
about geometric problems in a more algebraic

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.110
way.

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.450
Let's start with the very basics of what is
an angle.

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:06.169
You know from basic Euclidean geometry, that
if you have a circle of radius 'r',

00:02:06.169 --> 00:02:15.770
then the perimeter of the circle is equal
to 2.\pi.r.

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.110
We know this from basic geometry.

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:34.640
A basic reasoning will tell you that
length of the arc of half a circle

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.110
is \pi.r.

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:51.350
Similarly, if I take a quarter circle, the
length of the arc is (\pi/2).r.

00:02:51.350 --> 00:03:03.720
In general if I pick out an angle of, say,
\alpha degrees (like this could be 60 degrees),

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:26.600
then you can easily reason that the length
of an arc with angle \alpha degrees is (\alpha/360).(2.\pi.r).

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.990
This is just a basic ratio and proportion
argument.

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:45.030
Let me write this as ((2.\pi.\alpha)/360).r.

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:51.190
We are more generally taught since school
to think in terms of degrees.

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.190
The full circle has 360 degree.

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.300
But now when we have to write the length of
an arc,

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.700
we have to write an annoying expression ((2.\pi.\alpha)/360).r.

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:12.010
It would be much nicer to call this expression
((2.\pi.\alpha)/360) as the "angle" itself.

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:18.459
Instead of \alpha degrees if we could call
((2.\pi.\alpha)/360) as the "angle", then

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:27.490
it would be much nicer.

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.360
As there are different ways to measure objects,
for example, length, you can measure it in

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.080
meters or inches.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.240
similarly this is a different unit for measuring
angles.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:45.529
This is angle in "radians".

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:47.510
Thinking in terms of radians is very important.

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:53.229
My math teacher used to tell me that when
you are learning a new language,

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:55.830
for example, if I am trying to speak in English,

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.960
if I want to learn it well, I should not think
in a different language.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.750
For example, I should not think in Hindi and
translate to English every time I am speaking.

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:07.900
You should really start thinking in English,
if you want to learn English well.

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:14.550
Similarly here, thinking in terms of radians
is often the better thing to do

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:33.639
because now the length of arc with angle \theta
radians is simply (r.\theta).

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:38.949
So that's why thinking in terms of radians
is often the more natural way to think about

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:42.308
angles.

00:05:42.308 --> 00:05:49.719
Just to be more familiar with this conversion,

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:56.830
lets see that 360 degrees is '2 \pi' radians.

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:04.939
The perimeter of the entire circle is '2.\pi.r'
and '2\pi' is the angle of the entire circle.

00:06:04.939 --> 00:06:16.000
Similarly, 180 degrees is \pi. 90 degrees
is \pi/2 and so on.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.520
So we just saw how to measure angles in degrees
and radians

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:27.250
and we said that radians is the more natural
unit to think about angles.

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:33.069
So that now the length of the arc with angle
of \theta radians is just r.\theta.

00:06:33.069 --> 00:06:36.558
In the rest of the video, we will talk about
trigonometric ratios,

00:06:36.558 --> 00:06:40.680
we'll define what they are and we'll talk
about some trigonometric identities.

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:46.999
These are the algebraic tools which will help
us reason about angles in a more algebraic

00:06:46.999 --> 00:06:52.159
way.

00:06:52.159 --> 00:06:54.189
Let's look at an angle \theta.

00:06:54.189 --> 00:07:00.520
Whenever we write \theta as an angle, it is
assumed that it is in radians,

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:03.889
as we know that radians is the more natural
unit to think about angles.

00:07:03.889 --> 00:07:09.539
Let's say the radius is 'r',

00:07:09.539 --> 00:07:19.190
and we just saw that the length of the arc
is r.\theta.

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:23.240
Now there are other interesting parameters
that you would want to know about the angle.

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:30.960
For example, if we drop a perpendicular from
the top vertex,

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:39.210
what is the height of this line segment?

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:47.129
Let's call the vertices as A, B and C.

00:07:47.129 --> 00:07:55.249
This side BC is "opposite" to the angle.

00:07:55.249 --> 00:08:04.110
The side AC is the side that is "adjacent"
to the angle.

00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:17.789
And the side AB is the "hypotenuse".

00:08:17.789 --> 00:08:25.149
So we would like to know the height of the
line segment BC is.

00:08:25.149 --> 00:08:28.180
One thing that you know from similarity of
triangles is that

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:39.000
suppose I have two triangles like this.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:47.100
You know from similarity of triangles that
BC/AB = DE/AD.

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:57.430
(Note that angles BCA and DEA are right angles.)

00:08:57.430 --> 00:09:01.070
These are two triangles which have all three
angles the same,

00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:10.130
and therefore they are "similar" and hence
the ratio of sides are equal.

00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:14.970
Because of similarity of triangles, this ratio
is purely a property of the angle,

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:20.020
and is not related to any of the sides.

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:34.190
This ratio is defined as the "sine" of the
angle.

00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:47.420
To remember it more easily, let's call sin(\theta)
as opposite/hypotenuse.

00:09:47.420 --> 00:10:06.990
Now we can see that since the hypotenuse is
'r', the length of the opposite side is now

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:10.970
'r.(sin \theta)'.

00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:19.130
Similarly, now we can define the ratio of
the adjacent/hypotenuse.

00:10:19.130 --> 00:10:30.840
So that is defined as cos \theta.

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:43.750
Again, since the hypotenuse is 'r', the adjacent
side is of length r.(cos \theta).

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:55.180
In terms of this ratio, this will be AC/AB
= AE/AD.

00:10:55.180 --> 00:11:05.030
And
by similarity of triangles, this is just a

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:06.171
property of the angle,

00:11:06.171 --> 00:11:09.560
and does not depend on the sides of the triangle.

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:21.900
Now, we'll see our first trigonometric identity.

00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:37.910
From Pythagoras' theorem, we know that for
any right angled triangle,

00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:41.510
the sum of squares of the two sides is equal
to the square of the hypotenuse.

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:54.220
So let's write down here : (opp)^2 + (adj)^2
= (hyp)^2.

00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:58.930
This is what Pythagoras' theorem tells us.

00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:13.730
If we divide by (hyp)^2 throughout, we get
that (opp/hyp)^2 + (adj/hyp)^2 = 1.

00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:19.760
Now, if you look at our definitions of sin
\theta and cos \theta,

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:31.430
this tells us that, (sin \theta)^2 + (cos
\theta)^2 = 1.

00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:36.130
A usual convention to write (sin \theta)^2
is that

00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:38.380
you don't write the brackets all the time.

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:51.870
So what we do is, write it as sin^2(\theta)
and cos^2(\theta).

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:57.560
So as to not confuse with, for example, sin(\theta^2).

00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:03.820
This would mean sin(\theta^2), whereas this
is (sin \theta)^2
