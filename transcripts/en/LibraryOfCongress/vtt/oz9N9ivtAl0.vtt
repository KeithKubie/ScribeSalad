00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.670
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress, in Washington, D.C.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.340
&gt;&gt; Sharon Horowitz: Good afternoon.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.320
Welcome to the African and
Middle Eastern Reading Room.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.450
On behalf of the Hebraic
Section, let me thank you all

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.020
for coming to today's program.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.460
My name is Sharon Horowitz.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.100
I am a reference librarian
in the Hebraic Section.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.490
Customarily, our Division Chief,
Mary Jane Deeb greets you all,

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:46.720
our esteemed program attendees, and
today she had a schedule conflict

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:52.440
for this hour, so I was asked to
convey her warm welcome to you all.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.510
The Hebraic Section marks its
beginning in 1912 with the receipt

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.390
of 10,000 Hebrew books
and pamphlets,

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.210
whose purchase was
made possible by a gift

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.820
from New York philanthropist,
Jacob Shiff.

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.340
From those humble beginnings,

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.640
our collections have grown
to around 250,000 items.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.060
In Hebrew, Yiddish,
Latin, Judeo-Persian

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.850
and other Hebraic script languages.

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.640
The Hebraic Section also includes
an important selection of books

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.940
in [foreign words spoken],

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.780
the languages of Ethiopia,
past and present.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.220
Our section's holdings
are particularly strong

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.830
in the subject areas of
Bible and Rabbinics, liturgy

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.910
and Hebrew language, and
response and Jewish history.

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.970 position:56%
Two of our missions in this division
are to publicize our collections,

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.590
and to bring people
into the library.

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.860
One way we accomplish this second
goal is by holding lectures

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.660
and having programs such as the
one we are hosting here today.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.690
And now, a word about
our presenters.

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:58.410
In 2016, Ellen Cassedy won a
PEN/Heim Translation Grant,

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.850
the first ever awarded
to a Yiddish project.

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.000
In 2015 and 16, she was
a Translation Fellow

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.560
at the Yiddish Book Center
in Amhurst, Massachusetts.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.820
Her translations have
appeared in numerous journals.

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.580
She is the author of We Are Here,

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.910
Memories of the Lithuanian
Holocaust,

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.740
which won several national awards.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.810
Yermiyahu Ahron Talb is the
author of five books of poetry,

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.460
including most recently The
Education of a Daffodil.

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.600
He was honored by the Museum
of Jewish Heritage as one

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.650 position:56%
of New York's best emerging artists,
and his short stories have appeared

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.520
in Jewishfiction.net, Jewish
Literary Journal, Jewrotica,

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.850
and Second Hand Stories podcast.

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.970
He is also a colleague of ours
here at the Library of Congress.

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.780
One item of business
before we begin.

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.110
This event is being video taped
for subsequent broadcasting.

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.720
There will be a formal question and
answer period after the lecture,

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.780 position:56%
at which the audience is encouraged
to ask questions and offer comments.

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.680
Please be advised that your
voice and image may be recorded

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.050
and later broadcast
as part of this event.

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.880
By participating in the Q&amp;A
period, you are consenting

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.780
to the Library's possible
reproduction

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.240
and transmission of your remarks.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.850
And now, please join me in
welcoming Mr. Yermiyahu Ahron Talb,

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.510
and Miss Ellen Cassedy.

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:50.080
[ Applause ]

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.380
&gt;&gt; Yermiyahu Ahron Talb: Okay.

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.360
So, [foreign word spoken]
everyone, welcome, welcome.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.940
Thank you, Sharon, for
that warm introduction.

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.060
Thank you all for coming
during your lunch hour today.

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.870
We would like to thank Sharon
Horowitz and Dr. Ann Brenner,

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.350
of the Hebraic Section for
organizing this program.

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.850
Dr. Mary Jane Deeb,
Chief of the African

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.990
and Middle Eastern
Division, for her support.

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:17.280
We also want to thank
our wonderful publishers,

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.240 position:56%
Robert Mandel of Mandel Vilar Press,

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:23.980
and Meryl Lefler [assumed
spelling] of Dryad Press.

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.780
We also honor the work of
the talented translators

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.100
of Yiddish literature
today, and generations past,

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.170
who have made this
great literature known

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.870
to an English language readership.

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:41.310
In particular, we acknowledge
the pioneering work of Bridges,

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.140
a Journal for Jewish
Feminists, and our friends,

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:49.300
for serving as a publication venue
for the translation of the work

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:50.600
of Yiddish women writers.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:58.340 position:56%
In some ways, our work builds on
theirs, was made possible by theirs.

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.270
Today is a great pleasure to
share with you the life and work

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.800
of Blume Lempel, a writer who
deserves to be much better known

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.990
by English language readers.

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:13.330
The two of us have spent more
than 10 years, and many weekends

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:17.230
around Ellen's dining room
table, immersed in the life

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:19.720
and work of this unique writer.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.680
And now, with the publication
of our translated collection

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.950
of her short stories, we are
glad to have the opportunity

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:29.590
to share our findings with you.

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:33.410 position:56%
Today, we will take you on a kind
of mystery tour, to answer questions

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:36.640
like these: where did
this writer come from?

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.630
Who was she?

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:41.890
What set her on her unusual path?

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:44.770
What kept her going
through her long career?

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:46.950
Why did she write in Yiddish?

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:50.130
And what does she have to
offer a contemporary audience

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:52.370
like ourselves?

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:56.210
Blume Lempel was a unique
writer, one of a kind,

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:58.590
but she was part of
a larger picture.

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:01.700
So as we look at Blume
Lempel, we'll also be exploring

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:06.090
that larger context of what it
was to be a writer in Yiddish

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:08.620
in the second half
of the 20th Century

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:11.730
in the United States,
and as a woman.

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:16.440
But first, a word about how
we stumbled into this project,

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.740
and then we'll get into
Blume Lempel's story.

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:25.250
&gt;&gt; Ellen Cassedy: Years ago,
I began studying Yiddish

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:26.960
as a memorial to my mother.

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.860
My mother was Jewish,
unlike my father,

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:32.530
and had grown up around Yiddish.

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:35.920
She didn't actually speak Yiddish,
but she would sprinkle a word here,

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:39.020
and a word there, into her
conversation sort of like a spice.

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:41.080
So in the kitchen,
she might say "hand me

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:45.520
that shissle [phonetic spelling]"
Does anyone know what that means?

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:49.660
No? Bowl. Or she'd stand at the
window on a rainy day and say,

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:52.930
"Amabel [phonetic spelling]"
which meant "a flood."

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:58.230
On the phone, the woman's [Yiddish
spoken], a witch [laughter].

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:03.870
So I hope that by studying Yiddish,
I would strengthen my connection

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:08.240
to my cultural legacy, and really
find a home within Jewish culture,

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:10.230
and that has turned out to be true.

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:15.060
Yiddish is very precious to me,
for its outsider point of view,

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:20.040
its humor, its standing up
for the little guy, its irony,

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:23.060
and its honoring of the everyday.

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:26.480
So early on in my study of Yiddish,
I was living in Philadelphia,

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.760
and I told my teacher, who
was himself a translator,

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:32.140
that I wanted to try
my hand at translation.

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:35.610 position:56%
At that time, I had about two months
of Yiddish study under my belt,

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:37.180
I thought, "I'm ready for this."

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:39.030
And he went straight
to his book shelf,

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:41.880
and he pulled out this
little gray volume.

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:46.490 position:56%
He opened it up, and he told me this
was by a writer named Blume Lempel,

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:48.330
and he showed me how
it was inscribed

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:50.730
to him personally by the author.

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:53.990
Then I met Ahron in a
Yiddish reading group.

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:55.290
&gt;&gt; Yermiyahu Ahron Talb: I grew

00:07:55.290 --> 00:08:00.760
up in an Orthodox Shiva family
surrounded by Jewish languages,

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:04.170
including Yiddish, and I formally
studied Yiddish as an adult.

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:08.380
I've been involved in Yiddish
culture since the early 1990s.

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:09.820
A long time now.

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:14.590
As a reader, writer, translator and
activist, Yiddish is for me a place

00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:19.980
of primal connection, and
cultural imagining and possibility.

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:23.300
&gt;&gt; Ellen Cassedy: So we opened up
this little gray volume and began

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:30.360 position:56%
to read, and we were, frankly, blown
away by its truly unique writing.

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:34.530
Experimental, taboo-defying,
fearless, lyrical.

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:37.130
And there were surprises
at every turn.

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:40.640
In on every page, in
virtually every paragraph,

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:44.950
we had never seen any writer
like this in any language.

00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:50.940
At the time, years ago, we knew
almost nothing about Blume Lempel,

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:56.060
beyond the fact that she'd been
born in 1907, in Khorostkov,

00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:59.190
a little town in what
was then Galicia,

00:08:59.190 --> 00:09:03.420 position:56%
part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire,
later it became part of Poland,

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:08.700
now it is in Ukraine, in what she
described as a whitewashed room

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:12.100
by the banks of a river
that had no name.

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:15.900
And we wondered who was this
woman who came out of this place,

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:19.930
who wrote with such feeling
and with so many exact details

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:26.140 position:56%
about a very wide range of settings,
from the old world to the new,

00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:33.530 position:56%
pre-war Paris, Cosmopolitan Paris,
New York, California, Yosemite Park.

00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:37.350
How did somebody like her emerged
from a little whitewashed room

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:39.990
to become such a groundbreaking
writer?

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:44.070
So we went hunting, and we
tracked down Blume Lempel's heirs,

00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:47.790
her relatives, and her former
colleagues, and found boxes

00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:50.780
of her personal papers
stored in an attic.

00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:53.090
We came here to the
Library of Congress.

00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:57.120
We went to the Jewish Research
Institute called YIVO, in New York.

00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:00.060
And a picture began to emerge.

00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:03.690
&gt;&gt; Yermiyahu Ahron Talb: We
learned that Blume's father,

00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:09.070 position:56%
Abraham Pfeffer, was a butcher, and
that her mother, Pesha, read novels,

00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:14.330
subscribed to a newspaper from
the nearby city of Lvov, Lvov,

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:17.880
and was considered
cultured by the townspeople.

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:20.580
Blume's older brother
received a formal education,

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:23.410
but her own schooling was sporadic.

00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:26.800
For a few years, she attended
a religious school for girls,

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:32.540
and a Hebrew Folk School, and at
times, a tutor came to the house.

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:35.780
As she later recalled in an
interview with the Yiddish scholar,

00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:40.500
Itzel Gottesman, "My father
believed that all a girl needed

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:47.710
to know was how to cook a pot of
food, sew a patch, and milk a cow."

00:10:47.710 --> 00:10:51.190
In Poland, she remembered,
"I didn't write at all.

00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:53.660
I only dreamed of writing."

00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:56.760
As she dreamed, she
stored up observations

00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:59.420 position:56%
that would later appear in her work.

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:03.700
All her life, her childhood
self remained accessible

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:06.690
to her as, "The girl who was.

00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:13.930
The girl whose tides ebb and flow
on my sandy shores, to this day."

00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:16.130
&gt;&gt; Ellen Cassedy: So, for a time,

00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:20.560
Blume Lempel's childhood
world seemed safe and secure.

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:25.420
As the narrator in one story says,
"Enclosed within my father's words

00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:30.960
and my mother's tears, the world
came to me as a completed picture,

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:34.530
and I accepted its
pre-ordained colors and nuances

00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:36.720
as part of the natural order.

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:40.560
Just as the sun rose every
morning behind our barn,

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:42.880
and set every evening
behind the tree

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:45.720
that my father pointed
out with his finger.

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:49.870
So, I stayed within the picture
frame, walking in the light,

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:54.090
avoiding the shadows, never
straying beyond the borders."

00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:57.380
And this is from a story called
Even the Heavens Tell Lies,

00:11:57.380 --> 00:11:58.680
[Yiddish words spoken].

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:02.730
Now, would you like
to hear it in Yiddish?

00:12:02.730 --> 00:12:04.140
A little paragraph.

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:07.140
And for those that don't know
Yiddish, remember the words

00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:11.310
of Franz Kafka, who said, "Ladies
and gentlemen, don't be afraid

00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:14.470
of Yiddish, you'll understand
more than you thought you would."

00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:17.440
So here is that paragraph,
in Yiddish.

00:12:18.510 --> 00:13:14.040
[ Yiddish Spoken ]

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:16.370
&gt;&gt; Yermiyahu Ahron Talb: When
Blume was 12, that comforting sense

00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:18.740
of order began to crumble.

00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:23.720
Her mother died, and when her
father remarried, Blume was pressed

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:27.360
into service as a housekeeper
and nursemaid

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:30.210
for the new couple,
and their young child.

00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:34.890
Her brother, Yisroel, eight
years older, had become involved

00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:37.320
in militant communist activity.

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:44.110
He was caught and imprisoned, then
escaped, and went into hiding.

00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:49.530
Yisroel fled to France,
and in 1929, at age 22,

00:13:49.530 --> 00:13:52.170
Blume too left Khorostkov.

00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:57.950
She was intending to become
a pioneer in Palestine,

00:13:57.950 --> 00:14:01.900
but on the way, she stopped
off in Paris to visit Yisroel,

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:06.650
who settled in the Jewish immigrant
neighborhood of Belleville.

00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:11.050
Captivated by the city of light,
Blume abandoned her pioneer plans.

00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:16.170
She found a job in a factory, where
she met her husband Lemel Lempel.

00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:18.230
They started a family.

00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:21.510
Her dream of becoming a
writer began to take shape.

00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:25.240
She began writing poems, and
meeting other Yiddish writers.

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:27.660
During the 10 years
Blume lived in Paris,

00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:29.540
she fell in love with the city.

00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:33.440
It became the setting for some
of her most important work,

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:36.470
including a novel set
in the years before

00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:40.990
and during World War II,
and many short stories.

00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:44.640
&gt;&gt; Ellen Cassedy: So,
just before World War II,

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:48.910
the family was extremely fortunate
to be able to flee to New York,

00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:54.570 position:56%
and here they are, a couple of years
after the war, the whole family.

00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:56.450
Those two children.

00:14:56.450 --> 00:15:01.400
And in America, Blume reached
out to the New York Jewish,

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:05.910
Yiddish literary scene, especially
the newspaper Morgen Freiheit,

00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:11.010 position:56%
and she began to publish a
serialized novel, and short stories.

00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:15.170 position:56%
But then, the news from Europe
began to trickle in, and she learned

00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:19.150
that back in her hometown, her
father's wife, and their young son,

00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:22.270
had been seized and
killed by the Nazis,

00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:25.950
and that her father had
then burned down the house

00:15:25.950 --> 00:15:29.580
and hanged himself on
a tree in their yard.

00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:33.250
She also learned that on the
day before liberation of France,

00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:36.690
her brother, who had joined the
resistance, was captured and shot,

00:15:36.690 --> 00:15:39.530
leaving behind his
wife and two sons.

00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:44.390
As she later said, she was
catapulted into a deep despair.

00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:48.240
The past was a graveyard,
the future without meaning.

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:52.500
I sat paralyzed within
a self-imposed prison.

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:53.970
The years went by.

00:15:53.970 --> 00:15:57.830
Many desolate, fruitless years.

00:15:57.830 --> 00:16:00.620
She began to burn her work.

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:02.260
But then came a turning point.

00:16:02.260 --> 00:16:06.030
She had two friends who were
Yiddish writers, and they suggested

00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:08.460 position:56%
that she dedicate herself to writing

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:11.330
about the terrible destruction
that was consuming her.

00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:14.640
And that idea, she said,
opened a psychological door.

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:19.150
She wrote, "I felt I must speak for
those who could no longer speak.

00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:21.550
Feel for those who
could no longer feel.

00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:26.150
Immerse myself in their unlived
lives, their sorrows, their joys,

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:28.170
their struggle and their death."

00:16:28.170 --> 00:16:32.640
So she had found her calling, which
was to express the experience of,

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:34.540
as she put it, "The survivors.

00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:39.200
The broken people who attempt after
the war to establish a new link

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:41.880
to life, and who through
it all remain broken."

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:43.980
And this was her own experience.

00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:48.070
An experience of displacement
and flight, and adaptation,

00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:54.260 position:56%
and a special burden of remembering,
retribution, guilt and grief.

00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:57.740
And in an approach that
was uniquely her own,

00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:02.210
she often approached her subject
not head-on, but through a variety

00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:06.340
of subtle literary strategies,
in which the great cataclysm

00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:10.170
of the 20th Century is
never far from the surface,

00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:12.320 position:56%
but it's hovering just out of sight,

00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:16.260
appearing in powerful
glimpses, powerful flashes.

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:19.090
Many of her stories are
jagged and disjointed.

00:17:19.090 --> 00:17:22.850
They don't move smoothly from
point A to point B. Instead,

00:17:22.850 --> 00:17:25.340
sometimes within one
single sentence,

00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:29.940
you'll find Lempel's imagination
moving back and forth between dream

00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:33.510
and reality, past and
present, old world, and new.

00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:37.890 position:56%
And Ahron and I think that this
jaggedness is a carefully considered

00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:41.980
literary choice, one that is
unusual among Jewish writers.

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:45.670
We think it's a conscious
reflection of the disruptions

00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:49.200
in the author's life, and
the lives of her characters.

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:53.140
A brilliant, ingenious
way to convey the restless

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:56.560
and unsettled existence
that she knew so well.

00:17:56.560 --> 00:18:00.470
&gt;&gt; Yermiyahu Ahron Talb:
So here is an example.

00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:04.060
In the story called The
Little Red Umbrella,

00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:08.470
a middle-aged woman named Janet,
in New York City, gets a phone call

00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:11.720
from a poet she met
at a Hanukah party.

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:13.660
He invites her out on a date.

00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:16.800
He is one of a series of dates
she's had over the years.

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:19.240
Most of them not that great.

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:22.730
Including, as she tells
us, a washed-up actor,

00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:27.540
a sock manufacturer, a card-player,
a man who had left his wife

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:31.850
and child to travel around
the world in disguise."

00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:33.300
So it doesn't look good.

00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:36.360
But this is a woman who
doesn't give up hope.

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:40.790
And so listen to how,
within a single paragraph,

00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:47.320
Lempel catapults us out of Janet's
studio apartment, into the cosmos.

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:52.400
The rendezvous with the poet came
like a jolt from the very heart

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:58.190
of life, awakening the butterflies
from their lethargic dozing.

00:18:58.190 --> 00:19:01.870
Light, silk wings hovered
in the air.

00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:06.730 position:56%
The studio apartment, which a moment
before had been cold and dark,

00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:09.450
brightened with an ethereal light.

00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:12.360
The walls began to sing again.

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:16.960
There's still life at close
to 50, she said to the fly

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:19.910
that was spending the
winter in her house.

00:19:19.910 --> 00:19:25.810
Fantastic patterns streamed through
the cracks in the Venetian blinds.

00:19:25.810 --> 00:19:32.720 position:56%
Lost ships swarmed to her mountain,
bringing regards from distant lands.

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:36.980
Magic keys to locked doors.

00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:40.590
Janet followed a voice
through the dark corridors.

00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:43.310
She opens one of the
doors, and inside,

00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:46.830
a purple light filled the room.

00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:54.290 position:56%
On a bed of sky-blue silk, the Greek
was lounging with a high-borne lady.

00:19:54.290 --> 00:19:58.740
Janet swims without moving
over still water, not forward,

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:02.890
but backward in time,
from today to yesterday.

00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:05.560
The shift takes her
to the middle ages,

00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:09.100
to another world, on
another continent.

00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:14.520
She continues on to the land of
Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle.

00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:18.100
Then, to the promised
land of milk and honey.

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:22.200
Under an outspread
fig tree, Adam dozes.

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:23.500
She approaches him.

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:28.490 position:56%
Then, the telephone rings, and Janet
goes to the closet, gets dressed,

00:20:28.490 --> 00:20:32.670
puts on her makeup and steps out
into the streets of Manhattan,

00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:35.490
on her way to the date
with the poet.

00:20:35.490 --> 00:20:37.920
The story goes on from
there, and once again,

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:43.100
the Holocaust makes an
appearance in an unexpected way.

00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:44.520
Now, the erotic imaginings

00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:48.370
of a middle-aged woman are not
standard fare in any literature,

00:20:48.370 --> 00:20:52.670
and Lempel's approach to spooling
out this character's fantasies

00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:55.600
so freely is quite unusual.

00:20:55.600 --> 00:21:00.960
So, how did she summon the
courage to write this way?

00:21:03.950 --> 00:21:07.910
&gt;&gt; Ellen Cassedy: Perhaps the most
important factor was that by 1970,

00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:12.330
she had won the support of
Abraham Sutzkever, who was renowned

00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:17.200 position:56%
through the world of Yiddish letters
as a poet, as a cultural hero

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:21.730
who had rescued treasured Jewish
texts in the Vilna ghetto,

00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:25.540
and as the editor of the leading
Yiddish literary journal called Di

00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:29.330
goldene keyt, which was
published in Tel Aviv.

00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:34.330
Sutzkever's right-hand man
was Alexander Spiegel-Vaught,

00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:36.190
and here is what the
Di goldene keyt,

00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:38.170
which means the golden
chain look like,

00:21:38.170 --> 00:21:41.850
and the golden chain means
the golden chain of Yiddish

00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:44.880
or Jewish literature that
is passed on from one writer

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:47.170
to the next down through the ages.

00:21:47.170 --> 00:21:49.860
So after receiving her
first letter of acceptance

00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:53.310
from Di goldene keyt,
Lempel recalled this.

00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:57.520
"I still remember how surprised
I was at the warm answer.

00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:01.670
I remember even that it was a cold,
cloudy winter day, but for me,

00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:05.590
spring gardens burst into
the most beautiful bloom.

00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:11.810 position:56%
The energy that I'd conserved in my
youth came out from under my apron."

00:22:11.810 --> 00:22:15.230
Sutzkever and Lempel
corresponded for 20 years,

00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:17.730
and here we see an
early letter from him,

00:22:17.730 --> 00:22:21.720
complete with a rather charming
drawing, a portrait, self-portrait,

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:25.230
signed, "All the best,
with love, Sutzkever."

00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:28.610
And while another editor might
have tried to reign her in,

00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:32.460
to smooth out her rough edges,
or tame her bold choices,

00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:34.780
what was critically
important about this editor,

00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:37.610
Abraham Sutzkever,
was that he never did.

00:22:37.610 --> 00:22:40.870
Instead, he deeply
affirmed her individuality.

00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:44.350
He wrote, "You have your own
words, your own observations,

00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:48.530
your own madness, which you
scoop out from within yourself

00:22:48.530 --> 00:22:51.200
like shovelfuls of hot coals.

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:53.520
Your talent is not an ordinary one.

00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:55.720
Of that I am sure."

00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:58.390
So Sutzkever allowed
Lempel free reign

00:22:58.390 --> 00:23:02.050
to pursue her unique
narrative strategies, and this,

00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:06.560 position:56%
like the earlier intervention of
Lempel's few Yiddish writer friends,

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:08.820
was a key factor in the development

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:12.360
of her singular contribution
to Yiddish literature.

00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:14.500
Lempel wrote back to Sutzkever,

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:17.680
"I write not for my
readers, but for myself.

00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:19.440
I write for the dybbuk

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:21.860
that is seeking a transformation
through me."

00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:28.010
Now in Jewish folk culture, a
dybbuk is the soul of a dead person

00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:31.990
that takes up residence inside
a living individual and strives

00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:36.150
for expression through that
person, and Sutzkever wrote back,

00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:38.300
"for that dibbick you must write.

00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:40.740
You must write for
yourself, and for me,

00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:45.680
and for that chosen writer whom
every true talent brings into being

00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:48.070
through the magnetic
power of the work itself.

00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:50.580
Now, I think this is a
very interesting concept,

00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:54.960
that the writer kind of creates
an ideal reader inside his

00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:59.720
or her own head, and that reader is
the one that the writer writes for.

00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:03.450
"Your prose," Sutzkever said, "is
in essence poetic, and therefore,

00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:06.650
it must be pure and
careful, like pure poetry.

00:24:06.650 --> 00:24:10.690
Every drop is as important
as the rushing current.

00:24:10.690 --> 00:24:19.890
Sincerely, and with
much belief in you."

00:24:19.890 --> 00:24:22.510
&gt;&gt; Yermiyahu Ahron Talb:

00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:26.970 position:56%
Another important sustaining force
was the poet, Malka Heifetz Tussman,

00:24:26.970 --> 00:24:31.640
and here we see a photo
of her with her husband,

00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:34.340
both in bathing suits, no less.

00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:39.340
And here is a letter, here is a
letter from her, in which she talks

00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:44.660 position:56%
about the complex and very personal
literary home that Lempel had built.

00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:49.470 position:56%
She writes, "Blume, Blume, why do
you think your poems would shock me?

00:24:49.470 --> 00:24:52.840
Not so. Good poems, Blume.

00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:56.900
You dive into the self,
and behold, a sbibh."

00:24:56.900 --> 00:25:01.290
Here is Blume, and you can see
even the letter itself is written

00:25:01.290 --> 00:25:03.980
as a poem.

00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:08.440
In Yiddish, the word sbibh means
"environment" or "atmosphere."

00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:12.010
But it can also note
fellowship and connection.

00:25:12.010 --> 00:25:13.870
It is a place where one belongs.

00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:18.520
A home. The sbibh that Blume
Lempel constructed for herself,

00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:23.270
the sustaining literary home,
was part privacy and solitude,

00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:25.780
part support and community.

00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:29.110
As writers ourselves, we are
fascinated by Blume's sbibh,

00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:33.360
and how richly rewarding
it clearly was for her.

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:37.960
In Heifetz Tussman's words,
"Blume is her own sbibh."

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:42.870
And that is an important part
of the truth, but only one part.

00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:45.270
The support of other
writers was also a key part

00:25:45.270 --> 00:25:47.880
of what sustained her.

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:51.650
Lempel's work became known
in the Yiddish world.

00:25:51.650 --> 00:25:54.750
As we were able to see in the
holdings here at the Library

00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:58.680
of Congress, it was published in a
great variety of Yiddish journals,

00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:02.210
in Tel Aviv, New York,
Los Angeles, Melbourne,

00:26:02.210 --> 00:26:05.890
Australia, Paris, and South Africa.

00:26:05.890 --> 00:26:08.050
She won several literary prizes,

00:26:08.050 --> 00:26:09.880
including the EKUF
[phonetic spelling] prize,

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:13.060
the I.J. Seigel Prize, awarded
by the Jewish Public Library

00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:17.430
in Montreal, and the Haim
Shetovk [assumed spelling] Prize.

00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:21.370
&gt;&gt; Ellen Cassedy: In
1979, she began preparing

00:26:21.370 --> 00:26:24.940
for her first short story
collection to publish it,

00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:26.760
and for editorial help, she turned

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:30.220
to this Tel Aviv poet named
Denham Heller [phonetic spelling]

00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:34.000
and he urged her to include
even her most daring stories,

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.530
ones that had been rejected
by literary magazines,

00:26:36.530 --> 00:26:38.840
including Oedipus in Brooklyn,

00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:41.440
the story that Sutzkever
himself has turned down.

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:46.640 position:56%
And the result was this book, A
Moment Fun Ams, "a moment of truth,"

00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:51.680
the volume that my teacher
put in my hand 10 years later,

00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:55.120
and once the book was published,
praise began to pour in.

00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:59.220 position:56%
Praise that recognized that hers was
a unique voice, a talent distinct

00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:02.960
from others in the
Yiddish literary world.

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:06.620
The writer, the celebrated
Yiddish writer, Chaim Grade,

00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:10.670
wrote to her how sad it was that
her talent had flowered so late,

00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:14.550 position:56%
when there were so few readers who
could read her work in the original,

00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:17.860
but he said maybe this was
inevitable, because she belonged

00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:20.910
so much to her own
time, and no other time.

00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:22.250
So listen to what he says.

00:27:22.250 --> 00:27:25.860
"It is enough to make one weep
that you appeared in our literature

00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:29.430
at a time when so few
good readers remained,

00:27:29.430 --> 00:27:32.110
but perhaps it could
not have been otherwise.

00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:36.390
Perhaps your magical, sweet,
lyrical tone could not have come

00:27:36.390 --> 00:27:40.370
into being any earlier
than our autumn years.

00:27:40.370 --> 00:27:45.100
You are a modern writer in
the most beautiful sense.

00:27:49.810 --> 00:27:51.890
&gt;&gt; Yermiyahu Ahron Talb: Lempel
also attracted the attention

00:27:51.890 --> 00:27:54.820
of the Montreal writer, Java
Rosenfarb [phonetic spelling],

00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:58.240
who introduced herself
to Lempel in a letter.

00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:01.910
"I've been reading your work
in Di goldene keyt," she wrote.

00:28:01.910 --> 00:28:05.910
"I feel very close to your
way of writing, to your style.

00:28:05.910 --> 00:28:07.740
Who are you?"

00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:12.220
The two women exchanged warm
and frequent letters until 1990,

00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:15.300
critiquing each other's work,
revealing their struggles

00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:20.060 position:56%
with writing and publishing, sharing
their views of other writers,

00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:21.980
some of which are not so positive,

00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:24.360
and offering news about
their families.

00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:27.450
Rosenfarb wrote, "I
admire the beauty

00:28:27.450 --> 00:28:29.640
and austerity of your language.

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:36.120
You are so economical, careful
not to waste a single word."

00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:41.420
We agree. As translators, we found
her prose so poetic and so rich

00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:45.600
that we had to work very hard
to capture her unique melody,

00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:51.810 position:56%
one that we found to be denser, more
idiosyncratic, more well...unhinged,

00:28:51.810 --> 00:28:56.820
than that of other women
or men writing in Yiddish.

00:28:56.820 --> 00:29:01.020
That one...

00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:02.700
&gt;&gt; Ellen Cassedy: Perfect, perfect.

00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:05.580
&gt;&gt; Yermiyahu Ahron Talb: Lempel's
second collection came out in 1986,

00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:10.180
and was called "Balade fun a
kholem," ballad of a dream.

00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:12.980
Like her first book, it
contains an extraordinary range

00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:14.600
of subject matter.

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:18.150
In her stories, we meet
women and girls of all ages.

00:29:18.150 --> 00:29:22.310 position:56%
A lonely little girl who is too
poor to own a doll, so she draws one

00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:24.740
with her finger on
a misty windowpane.

00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:28.040
A madwoman dancing
in the marketplace.

00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:30.190
A mother and son living
in the forest

00:29:30.190 --> 00:29:33.260
with the squirrels to
hide from the Nazis.

00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:38.170
A woman lying on her back on a
table, in an abortion clinic.

00:29:38.170 --> 00:29:42.740
A woman who occupies herself
with extravagant daydreams,

00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:46.880
as she and her husband drive
to Florida for the winter.

00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:53.560 position:56%
An anti-Nazi spy in Paris, disguised
behind a mask of glamorous makeup.

00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:57.030
A deeply religious African
American woman living in Brooklyn.

00:29:57.030 --> 00:30:00.050
A woman named Pakasandra [phonetic
spelling], who tells a lie

00:30:00.050 --> 00:30:03.770
to save her son's life, and
then is obsessed with the fear

00:30:03.770 --> 00:30:08.370
that God will punish her for the
sin of bearing false witness.

00:30:08.370 --> 00:30:13.160
In response to the second volume,
Yunya Fein [phonetic spelling],

00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:17.440
a Yiddish writer, an artist who
lived in New York, wrote to Lempel.

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:22.620
And we think this is a really
nice synthesis of her writing.

00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:27.150
Yunya wrote, "Throughout
your stories, time undulates.

00:30:27.150 --> 00:30:31.780
Not measured or divided into
past, present and future.

00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:36.850
As long as we are alive, we carry
all times within us simultaneously.

00:30:36.850 --> 00:30:41.050
And who knows for sure what
is fact and what is dream?

00:30:41.050 --> 00:30:46.570 position:56%
And who can say with certainty how
much arrival there is in going away?

00:30:46.570 --> 00:30:51.370 position:56%
And how much going away in arriving?

00:30:51.370 --> 00:30:54.620
These and many other
questions are woven

00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:58.030
in a natural way into your work."

00:30:58.030 --> 00:31:01.470
For example, the aforementioned
Pakasandra,

00:31:01.470 --> 00:31:05.680
the woman who told a lie, lives
with the images of Biblical figures

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:08.720
in her mind, all day, every day.

00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:11.660
Here is a brief excerpt.

00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:15.540
"All day, while her mind
was busy with this and that,

00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:17.640
the images were in motion.

00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:21.840
She saw Abraham's caravan
on the edge of the desert,

00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:27.280
and the matriarch, Sarah, encircled
by a retinue of maidservants.

00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:33.310
And wrapped in white linen, riding
side saddle on a small donkey.

00:31:33.310 --> 00:31:39.080
Pakasandra couldn't see her face,
but sensed her royal bearing.

00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:44.090
And with the utmost respect, she
chose not to peel away the swaths

00:31:44.090 --> 00:31:47.480
of fabric protecting her privacy.

00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:52.140
The images populated Pakasandra's
world, which she tended

00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:54.890
in a special chamber of her being.

00:31:54.890 --> 00:31:59.130
Minute as a pinhead,
and yet, infinite."

00:32:00.150 --> 00:32:02.690
&gt;&gt; Ellen Cassedy: And now, a word,
for what you've been waiting for,

00:32:02.690 --> 00:32:05.400
about the title story,
Oedipus in Brooklyn.

00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:06.700
What is this?

00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:09.510
This was a story that Sutzkever
considered too shocking

00:32:09.510 --> 00:32:11.560
to publish and maybe he was right.

00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:13.180
You can be the judge.

00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:16.020
But we find that in Lempel's hands,

00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:19.220
the account of a contemporary
woman involved

00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:23.590
in a transgressive relationship
with her son is not sensational,

00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:26.470
not tawdry, and not
played for laughs.

00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:30.520
Step by step, Lempel leads us
into the heart of darkness.

00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:33.580
She tells about the car
accident that kills the father

00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:37.690
and blinds the son, of the growing
closeness of mother and son,

00:32:37.690 --> 00:32:39.800
and of their increasing isolation.

00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:43.640
And finally, the two of them leave
the familiar streets of Brooklyn,

00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:47.750
and move to Florida, which becomes
a perfect backdrop of horror

00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:50.260
for the tragedy that
is beginning to unfold.

00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:51.730
Here is her description of Florida.

00:32:51.730 --> 00:32:57.330
"A blinding haze hung in
the air like carbon fumes.

00:32:57.330 --> 00:33:00.980
The earth was scorched,
the waterways dried up,

00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:03.350
the white Egrets disappeared.

00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:08.960
Creeping insects of all kinds
eked out their slithery existence,

00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:14.880
leaving behind silver threads of
slime on the desiccated water bed.

00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:18.270
Sylvia and Danny hid from the sun.

00:33:18.270 --> 00:33:23.590
In the house, the air conditioner
cooled their parched bodies."

00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:27.140
So, by the end of the story,
we've come to understand something

00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:32.530
about both the mother and the son,
and perhaps, even to sympathize.

00:33:32.530 --> 00:33:37.690
There's the picture of what
her second volume looked like.

00:33:37.690 --> 00:33:41.110
And here she is near
the end of her life.

00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:45.130
&gt;&gt; Yermiyahu Ahron Talb: Finally,
why did Blume Lempel write

00:33:45.130 --> 00:33:47.680
in Yiddish, and keep
writing in Yiddish,

00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:52.380
even as the Yiddish readership grew
smaller and smaller year by year?

00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:55.540
She wrote, "Yiddish is in my bones.

00:33:55.540 --> 00:33:58.330
I hear my mother's [Yiddish
word spoken] in my head,

00:33:58.330 --> 00:34:00.870
and I lift my eyes to the heavens,

00:34:00.870 --> 00:34:03.540
and hear God answering
me in Yiddish.

00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:06.990
The birds, real and
imagined, speak Yiddish.

00:34:06.990 --> 00:34:09.950
And the wind at my
window speaks Yiddish,

00:34:09.950 --> 00:34:13.270
because I speak Yiddish,
think in Yiddish.

00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:15.690
So Yiddish was a portable homeland.

00:34:15.690 --> 00:34:19.380
A way of remaining true to
a world that was no more,

00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:21.560
while she made her
way to new places,

00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:25.500
confronting new circumstances,
in new languages.

00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:29.740
Yiddish was also a way to honor
the six million who perished

00:34:29.740 --> 00:34:33.620
in the Holocaust, including
the members of her own family.

00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:38.260
She wrote, "My older brother
tells me what to write in Yiddish,

00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:41.650
directing my stories
from beyond the grave.

00:34:41.650 --> 00:34:43.310
This is how it was.

00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:44.740
This is what happened.

00:34:44.740 --> 00:34:47.240
So must it be recorded.

00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:52.730
You did not survive simply to
eat blintzes with sour cream.

00:34:52.730 --> 00:34:55.880
You survived to bring back
those who were annihilated.

00:34:55.880 --> 00:35:00.210
You must speak in their
tongue, point their fingers."

00:35:00.210 --> 00:35:04.160
And for Lempel, Yiddish
was also a way to hide.

00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:06.520
Writing in Yiddish
could feel isolating.

00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:11.080
But we think maybe that
very isolation freed Lempel

00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:15.210
to pursue her own idiosyncratic
vision.

00:35:15.210 --> 00:35:18.410
Even as she was being published
in Yiddish periodicals,

00:35:18.410 --> 00:35:22.010
receiving literary prizes,
and corresponding in Yiddish

00:35:22.010 --> 00:35:27.560
with readers and writers all over
the world, living in her sbibh.

00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:31.180
At the same time, her children
couldn't read what she wrote,

00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:33.470
and her neighbors in
Long Beach, New York,

00:35:33.470 --> 00:35:37.570
had no idea she was a
world published writer.

00:35:37.570 --> 00:35:40.130
She told Itzel Gottesman this.

00:35:40.130 --> 00:35:43.740
"I hide my literary
existence under my apron.

00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:46.310
If you ask my neighbors
about my writing,

00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:48.260
they'd think you were crazy."

00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:52.020
So perhaps writing in Yiddish in
an English-speaking world helped

00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:56.890
to liberate Lempel to be the
taboo-defying writer she was meant

00:35:56.890 --> 00:35:58.320
to be.

00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:02.970
&gt;&gt; Ellen Cassedy: When Blume died
in 1999, at her home in Long Beach,

00:36:02.970 --> 00:36:07.830
Long Island, an article in the
[inaudible], the Yiddish newspaper

00:36:07.830 --> 00:36:11.230
in New York stated, "With
the passing of Blume Lempel,

00:36:11.230 --> 00:36:14.980
Yiddish literature has lost one
of its most remarkable writers.

00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:17.820
An empty spot has opened
in the galaxy

00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:21.030
of talented women Yiddish writers."

00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:25.610
So, in closing, we want to read
to you a luminous passage from one

00:36:25.610 --> 00:36:28.480
of Lempel's most extraordinary
stories called Waiting

and about how her memories have come
with her, have traveled with her

going to read you the Yiddish first,

00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:43.510
and see how much you can get.

[ Yiddish Being Spoken ]

&gt;&gt; Ellen Cassedy: And
now in English,

00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:24.820
"The young Passover son liked
to play with the colored glasses

00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:28.540
that stood on the sideboard
in honor of the holiday.

00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:32.360
The son poured the colors
together and transmuted them

00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:37.420
into shimmering stars that
spangled the whitewashed walls,

with its Seder plate set

in the middle of the snowy cloth.

As I lifted my hands in the air,
the beams rained down over my head,

00:37:49.390 --> 00:37:54.330
like a golden raisin wine that
began to ferment inside me.

00:37:54.330 --> 00:37:58.750
To this day, I capture
handfuls of sunbeams,

00:37:58.750 --> 00:38:02.780
and use them to illuminate
the shadows."

her lifetime, Lempel's dream

00:38:10.290 --> 00:38:15.170
of an English language readership
for the most part eluded her.

00:38:15.170 --> 00:38:19.750
It is a joy for us now to help
her unrealized dream come true.

we're helping this great writer

are welcome, and as Sharon told us

at the beginning, just be aware
that if you do ask a question,

your image will appear on
the podcast that is sent

00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:22.940
Yes sir?

[ Inaudible Question ]

00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:32.670
&gt;&gt; Ellen Cassedy: So the question
is whether there were any outside

00:39:32.670 --> 00:39:37.120
influences on this writer, outside
the Yiddish literary circle.

00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:39.740
&gt;&gt; Yermiyahu Ahron Talb: Go ahead.

00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:42.160
&gt;&gt; Ellen Cassedy: She always
said that she wasn't influenced

00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:45.960
by anybody, that she was not
part of any literary school,

00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:49.980
and that she pursued her
own path and didn't borrow

00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:52.640
from anyone, as she put it.

00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:59.530
On the other hand, I feel that she,
having come from this tiny town,

00:39:59.530 --> 00:40:04.410 position:56%
by the banks of a river that had no
name, became a Western intellectual.

00:40:04.410 --> 00:40:07.960
And she was familiar with,
for example, Oedipus.

00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:11.880
That is part of our
Western literary legacy.

00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:13.710
She knew about Freud.

00:40:13.710 --> 00:40:16.440
That is very evident in the story.

00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:21.100
The Oedipus in Brooklyn,
and she read widely.

00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:24.720
She, according to her children,
had a lot of books in the house.

00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:28.970
So somehow, something seeped in,
but it is not possible to say, oh,

00:40:28.970 --> 00:40:31.330
she is kind of like so-and-so.

00:40:31.330 --> 00:40:35.430
I tried to develop a theory
that she is like a blend

00:40:35.430 --> 00:40:39.450
of the writer Grace Paley, who
is this kind of wise-cracking,

00:40:39.450 --> 00:40:44.050
down to earth, Brooklyn New
York voice, Bronx voice.

00:40:44.050 --> 00:40:48.180
Grace Paley, and Gabrielle
Garcia-Marquez,

00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:52.140
surreal butterflies,
sunbeams, and so on.

00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:53.550
So you could sort of see that.

00:40:53.550 --> 00:40:56.790
But I don't think she read
either of those writers.

00:40:56.790 --> 00:41:00.930
So maybe she picked it up
through her pores, I don't know.

00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:04.950
&gt;&gt; Yermiyahu Ahron Talb: She
also mentions in passing Spinoza,

00:41:04.950 --> 00:41:08.400
and the French philosopher
Henri Bergson.

00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:10.730
Again, just in passing.

00:41:10.730 --> 00:41:14.780
She doesn't really cite
them as major influences.

00:41:14.780 --> 00:41:20.360
But other people have, you
know, said well this knowledge,

00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:23.290
this skill must have
come from somewhere.

00:41:23.290 --> 00:41:27.890
I mean, the thing about
what we know is based a lot

00:41:27.890 --> 00:41:31.620
on this video interview
that we have.

00:41:31.620 --> 00:41:33.900
And it is a moment in time.

00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:38.080
So maybe if someone asked her that
question like five years later,

00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:39.380
there might have been
a different answer.

00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:44.040
It is not like today where
people leave a lot more traces

00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:47.590
of themselves, in terms
of responses to things,

00:41:47.590 --> 00:41:50.030
like the question of
literary influence.

00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:53.180
So yeah.

00:41:53.180 --> 00:41:54.980
&gt;&gt; Ellen Cassedy: Yes?

[ Inaudible Question ]

00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:12.340
&gt;&gt; Yermiyahu Ahron Talb:
So the question was,

00:42:12.340 --> 00:42:17.050
did she have any interaction with
Basheva Singer [phonetic spelling].

00:42:17.050 --> 00:42:19.100
And the questioner thought

00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:23.740
that there was some
magical realism in Singer.

00:42:23.740 --> 00:42:27.280
None that we know of.

00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:29.500
Not as far as I know.

00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:31.060
She may have read him.

00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:36.460
But I don't know of any
personal contact with him.

00:42:36.460 --> 00:42:42.210
At other sessions, someone asked
about Chaim Grade, specifically,

00:42:42.210 --> 00:42:47.540
we mention because that person
thought that some of the passages

00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:50.500
that we were reading
could have come from Grade

00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:52.060
in terms of the poeticism.

00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:59.260
And while we both, while Grade was
a master of both poetry and prose,

00:42:59.260 --> 00:43:05.530
the particular way that Blume
Lempel brought it all together is

00:43:05.530 --> 00:43:06.830
uniquely hers.

00:43:06.830 --> 00:43:10.720
I mean, I read extensively
in Grade, and I did not,

00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:14.200
I've never encountered
anything like this in Grade.

00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:15.530
&gt;&gt; Ellen Cassedy: Someone
also at one

00:43:15.530 --> 00:43:20.080
of our lectures mentioned
Marc Chagall, the artist,

00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:22.480
and said there is something
there about, you know,

00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:26.080
cows flying over the house and
so on, and I think that's true.

00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:30.060 position:56%
But I think it comes from a culture,

00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:33.860
rather than from actual
contact between these writers.

00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:36.310
There was contact between writers,

00:43:36.310 --> 00:43:38.620
and they definitely
sustained each other,

00:43:38.620 --> 00:43:43.830 position:56%
but I don't see a literary influence
so much as just the support for,

00:43:43.830 --> 00:43:46.950 position:56%
go for it, say what you want to say.

00:43:46.950 --> 00:43:48.700
Did somebody else have a question?

00:43:48.700 --> 00:43:51.510
Yes, you.

00:43:51.510 --> 00:44:10.960
[ Inaudible Question ]

00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:14.640
&gt;&gt; Ellen Cassedy: So the questioner
said that we did a lot of research

00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:20.100
on her, and did we find any traces
of the early work that she burned?

00:44:20.100 --> 00:44:22.940
And is there a Bibliography
about her?

00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:25.660
We didn't find traces, no.

00:44:25.660 --> 00:44:28.860
We do know that the
typewriter that she typed on,

00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:32.750
thank goodness she typed, because
her handwriting is pretty fearsome,

00:44:32.750 --> 00:44:38.000
that typewriter was given
to her by the editor of one

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:42.080
of the Yiddish newspapers in New
York early on, and she continued

00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:46.110
to use it for the rest of her
life, and we did find some stories

00:44:46.110 --> 00:44:49.800
that we couldn't track
down in any publications.

00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:52.570
We looked through here at
the Library of Congress,

00:44:52.570 --> 00:44:56.670
we looked through bound volumes
of Yiddish literary journals,

00:44:56.670 --> 00:45:01.470
and we did find some stories
that are not in her collections,

00:45:01.470 --> 00:45:07.290
but I don't think that
those burned works survived.

00:45:07.290 --> 00:45:09.420
But it was quite fascinating.

00:45:09.420 --> 00:45:13.290
We had lots of, she had lots of
correspondence with writers all

00:45:13.290 --> 00:45:17.340 position:56%
over the world, sort of like a
virtual café, where in the old world

00:45:17.340 --> 00:45:19.010
in Warsaw, they might
have been sitting

00:45:19.010 --> 00:45:21.900
around all day drinking
their tea and talking,

00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:23.420
here they were writing
letters to each other,

00:45:23.420 --> 00:45:24.980
and we have those letters.

00:45:24.980 --> 00:45:26.660
So that was quite fascinating.

00:45:26.660 --> 00:45:29.520
As for a bibliography, we have
written an essay about her

00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:34.700
that exists in a collection
of Yiddish women writers.

00:45:34.700 --> 00:45:41.220 position:56%
And we have not put it together, but
there are, we know of some reviews

00:45:41.220 --> 00:45:43.580
of her, everything in Yiddish.

00:45:43.580 --> 00:45:44.930
So yeah.

00:45:44.930 --> 00:45:47.940

[ Inaudible Question ]

00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:13.350
&gt;&gt; Yermiyahu Ahron Talb: So the
question was about the challenges

00:46:13.350 --> 00:46:17.790
of translation given
her unique style.

00:46:17.790 --> 00:46:20.880
And there were many.

00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:25.780
The challenge is how you are
going to represent, you know,

00:46:25.780 --> 00:46:30.590
a writer who moves back and
forth in time, intense in places,

00:46:30.590 --> 00:46:33.290
sometimes within the same sentence.

00:46:33.290 --> 00:46:37.380
Sometimes in the same
paragraph, the same page.

00:46:37.380 --> 00:46:38.680
Is she talking about now?

00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:40.250
Is she talking about
the distant past?

00:46:40.250 --> 00:46:41.950
The not so distant past?

00:46:41.950 --> 00:46:45.010
All those questions came into play.

00:46:45.010 --> 00:46:48.940
It was really good to have
someone to bounce ideas off of

00:46:48.940 --> 00:46:50.930
and to check, is this what you got?

00:46:50.930 --> 00:46:52.360
Did I get this?

00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:56.340
So we did a lot of back and forth.

00:46:56.340 --> 00:46:59.170
We should also just say like
a word about our process.

00:46:59.170 --> 00:47:05.170
We each read all the stories
and then wrote our own kind

00:47:05.170 --> 00:47:11.640 position:56%
of synoptic reviews, recommendations
for inclusion or exclusion,

00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:15.120
and then came up with our short
list and then went back and forth

00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:20.570
and came up with these stories,
and then in terms of the drafts,

00:47:20.570 --> 00:47:24.230
we split up, who would do the
first draft, which stories,

00:47:24.230 --> 00:47:28.760 position:56%
and we did first drafts, then sent
it to the other person for critiques

00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:38.590 position:56%
and lots of red ink and tears, etc.,
etc. But it was all good in the end.

00:47:38.590 --> 00:47:40.510
&gt;&gt; Ellen Cassedy: Yes?

00:47:40.510 --> 00:47:47.040
[ Inaudible Question ]

00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:48.810
&gt;&gt; Ellen Cassedy: How did
we select the stories?

00:47:48.810 --> 00:47:52.850
There are...there are another, I
don't know, maybe 30 or 40 stories

00:47:52.850 --> 00:47:59.010
that are out there that we read and
decided not to put in this volume.

00:47:59.010 --> 00:48:04.420
We pick the best [laughter], the
good ones, the really good ones.

00:48:04.420 --> 00:48:09.570
Yeah, I mean, sometimes it was
hard because even these stories,

00:48:09.570 --> 00:48:12.360
you're sort of going along
a particular narrative path,

00:48:12.360 --> 00:48:15.660
and all of a sudden there is this
[makes sound effect] total 180

00:48:15.660 --> 00:48:18.210
degree turn and you're going off
in a completely other direction,

00:48:18.210 --> 00:48:21.360
and we're thinking, are we going
to be able to keep up with this?

00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:26.240
Are we going to be able to convey
the power of this work even

00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:30.740
with these crazy jagged
twists and turns?

00:48:30.740 --> 00:48:34.150
But in the end, we
feel very satisfied

00:48:34.150 --> 00:48:39.420
with what we've put together,
and it covers, as her work does,

00:48:39.420 --> 00:48:42.660
it goes from the old world to the
new world, there is Paris in there,

00:48:42.660 --> 00:48:45.940
there is New York, there
is the women's movement,

00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:48.650
there is Florida, there
is South Carolina.

00:48:48.650 --> 00:48:54.820
So there is really a very eclectic
group of settings, but it all,

00:48:54.820 --> 00:48:56.850
the themes kind of,
as you go through,

00:48:56.850 --> 00:49:00.420
it is a very satisfying kind
of read, because things build

00:49:00.420 --> 00:49:05.610 position:56%
on each other, and the layers, those
layers go inside you as a reader,

00:49:05.610 --> 00:49:10.270
and you bring that to the
table in each successive story.

00:49:10.270 --> 00:49:11.970
&gt;&gt; Yermiyahu Ahron Talb: I
just want to add to that.

00:49:11.970 --> 00:49:15.070
I mean, the question of
selection is always a challenge,

00:49:15.070 --> 00:49:18.500
and some of it is, you know,
guided by the marketplace,

00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:22.310
the book is already like
well over 200 pages,

00:49:22.310 --> 00:49:27.530
and so we couldn't make it a
collected stories, so we did have

00:49:27.530 --> 00:49:30.050 position:56%
to make some tough decisions, and
you know, there might have been some

00:49:30.050 --> 00:49:33.790
that we could have included
that, on second read, you know,

00:49:33.790 --> 00:49:36.660
maybe could have made the
final cut, but you know,

00:49:36.660 --> 00:49:38.430
in the end, we believe in these.

00:49:38.430 --> 00:49:41.430
So yeah. There are
other gems out there

00:49:41.430 --> 00:49:44.580
that are not in this
collection also.

00:49:44.580 --> 00:49:46.020
&gt;&gt; Ellen Cassedy: Maybe
one last question?

00:49:46.020 --> 00:49:48.510
Mm-hmm.

00:49:48.510 --> 00:50:22.040
[ Inaudible Question ]

00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:24.720
&gt;&gt; Ellen Cassedy: So the question
is, this is the first translation,

00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:29.280 position:56%
the collection of translated work,
stories, and is there any other work

00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:31.240
out there in translation?

00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:35.280
Yes, this is the first collection
of her translated stories.

00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:37.360
Her novel that was serialized

00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:42.260
in a Yiddish newspaper was
translated in 1954, I believe.

00:50:42.260 --> 00:50:44.310
I don't know why whom.

00:50:44.310 --> 00:50:47.130
But there is a copy of it here
at the Library of Congress,

00:50:47.130 --> 00:50:50.140
we found it here, and you
can come in and read it.

00:50:50.140 --> 00:50:55.370
It is called Storm Over
Paris, and it is the story

00:50:55.370 --> 00:51:00.460
of a Jewish woman living in
Paris during World War II,

00:51:00.460 --> 00:51:03.460
who has an affair with a Nazi.

00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:04.760
Pretty wild.

00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:07.410
It's a kind of very different

00:51:07.410 --> 00:51:10.500
from these stories,
it is a realist novel.

00:51:10.500 --> 00:51:12.470
Very plot-driven.

00:51:12.470 --> 00:51:14.090
So there is that.

00:51:14.090 --> 00:51:19.900
And that is, as we said, there is a
story here and there that appeared

00:51:19.900 --> 00:51:24.310
in journals over the years,
but nothing all put together.

00:51:24.310 --> 00:51:28.370
So we are working very hard to
get this work out into the world.

00:51:28.370 --> 00:51:31.260
It is being bought by libraries.

00:51:31.260 --> 00:51:35.420
We are speaking at the Association
of Jewish Libraries in June,

00:51:35.420 --> 00:51:39.730
and our publishers are doing what
they can to get it out there,

00:51:39.730 --> 00:51:43.800
and we are depending on
you to spread the word.

00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:45.530 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Yermiyahu Ahron Talb: And someone
has just told me that he took

00:51:45.530 --> 00:51:48.530
out the book from the
Brooklyn Public Library,

00:51:48.530 --> 00:51:50.410
the Kensington Branch, so it is

00:51:50.410 --> 00:51:51.990
in the Brooklyn Public
Library [laughter],

00:51:51.990 --> 00:51:54.300
which seems very appropriate.

00:51:54.300 --> 00:51:57.730
&gt;&gt; Ellen Cassedy: And it is also
available on Amazon and Barnes

00:51:57.730 --> 00:52:00.210
and Noble, and through
the publisher.

00:52:00.210 --> 00:52:02.090
You can order it online.

00:52:02.090 --> 00:52:03.390
&gt;&gt; Yermiyahu Ahron
Talb: And here today.

00:52:03.390 --> 00:52:05.340
&gt;&gt; Ellen Cassedy: And
also in the book store

00:52:05.340 --> 00:52:06.790
of the library of Congress.

00:52:06.790 --> 00:52:10.120
And also at that table
right behind you.

00:52:10.120 --> 00:52:13.110
We are happy to sign it.

00:52:13.110 --> 00:52:15.510
Okay, so thank you very much.

00:52:15.510 --> 00:52:19.780
[ Applause ]

00:52:19.780 --> 00:52:23.440
