00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.380
So what are we talking about today?

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:09.260
About my favourite problem in geometry when I was a fifth grader

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.580
and it is etched in my memory to the point of being able to recall it at any time

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.880
so we have three squares of the
same sizes next to each other

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.630
the size does not matter

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.869
so what we will do you is pick one of the

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:30.939
top corners let's say the top left
corner and connect it

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:34.630
to the bottom right corners of

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:36.800
each of those three squares.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.940
Next, we
will take this angle here at the bottom let's call
it

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.250
alpha the next one at the bottom

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.699
let's call it well

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:55.410
beta and and that's incorrect

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.809
yeah this is upside down

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:03.039
and finally gamma alright

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:06.369
so the question is asking what

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:10.510
is the sum of these three angle so it's a 
simple enough problem

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:15.119
the interesting part about it is that it
was given to me as a fifth grader

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.310
so I had to a attack it as
fifth-grader

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.900
in fifth grade we learn how to use a protractor so

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.590
I measure the first angle it's about 45
degrees

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.220
and in fact then you can stop and think
about it but of course it has to be 45

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:32.210
 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.689
since the triangle we're looking at is
right

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.750
and iscoclese this guy here

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.159
so it should not be a surprise to
get a 45 degree angle there

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.450
and we go about measuring the others
there perhaps we

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.280
run a little bit out of luck because the second angle

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.219
looks like it's pointing to 25

00:01:57.219 --> 00:02:00.299
and a little bit maybe 26

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.619
and the third angle Wow where is it going

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:07.159
perhaps 15

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:10.569
20 so about 18 so when we

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:13.860
add this up 89

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.540
could that be it what do you think

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.340
it seems a bit arbitrary i don't know

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.980
Yeah and also there were all of these mistakes in our measurement

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.420
and why would they be asking a fifth
grader how much this is

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.050
and ending up with such a random angle?

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:36.310
well if you try to make another
measurement perhaps you will come up

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.690
with 91.3

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.170
and so you would say oh it's a little
bit obtuse

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.840
but maybe it's a little bit acute so
what would be

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.790
conjecture that people will leap to

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.780
if they believe this is a beautiful
problem I would guess that

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.530
the correct answer they would think the correct answer is ninety

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.050
exactly ninety but how would we know really

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.170
is it ninety? Or some ugly angle nearby?

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.269
we cheat a little bit we say okay that
problem was given to a fifth grader

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:18.269
it has got to be a nice answer we will
believe for a moment it's ninety and

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.550
this is what mathematicians call a
conjecture

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.709
and then put all of our effort into
proving that it is ninety

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:28.209
and we are kind of a third of the way

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:31.690
to proving it because we know that one
of the angles

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.410
for sure is forty five

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.680
so what  should be left for the other two angles
in order to make ninety?

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:47.399
well obviously forty five. so somehow we
need to add up the other two angles beta

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:48.209
and gamma

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:54.000
and prove that they add up to up to forty five another experiment which a

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.459
fifth grader might try and you can
also do at home

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:02.319
is cut up the whole thing with scissors

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.960
and eliminate

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.260
some of the error that is coming

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.790
from the protractor when you are
rounding

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.750
the degrees

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:24.600
okay so let's try to put everything together

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.100
if we can

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:34.300
it does look like this is a ninety degree let's check

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:39.680
well yep it does look like 90 degrees

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.840
okay so now we truly believe the
statement and we want to prove it

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.180
well the question is at what level of your mathematical career

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:54.400
or mathematical life you are because
this problem has not only one

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.520
not only two but at least

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.759
54 solutions. 
54 solutions?

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.060
No kidding.
Are we gonna do all of them?

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:08.660
No. we will do the most brilliant one the
most simple one that

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:13.860
a fifth grader may be able to grasp so the idea of our solution

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.820
at least the attempt when we cut with
scissors can be carried forward

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.039
mathematically so we may want to move

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:25.880
all three angles into the same
geometric location in our picture

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.720
so we need to find the best geometric
location where to move those three

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:30.669
angles

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:35.430
well there is no best geometric location
until you know what the solution is

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:38.650
so we might as well just try to move
them all the way

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:42.630
in this corner next to gamma because we
already have

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:47.169
a right angle here this guy we have gamma here

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:51.199
and so the other two angles alpha and
beta must somehow fit

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:55.870
and here comes the brilliant idea for
the solution

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:59.530
as I a said there is something missing in
this picture

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:03.620
what's missing is half of the picture
we will replicate

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:07.970
these 3 squares up and then we'll start
seeing

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:12.460
the truth and now i think I'm going to
start labeling things so people can

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:13.520
refer to them

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:17.380
later on I'm just labelling all of the

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:21.840
important points I will choose point

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.780
H and connect it to two other points

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:30.819
D and E

00:06:30.819 --> 00:06:34.870
and I will say that no more
constructions

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:38.810
will be done in this solution we somehow
have to make sense of

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:42.080
what this picture is telling us well for
starters

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:46.150
we see 3 angles exactly where
we wanted them to be

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:49.560
where this ninety degree angle was we
have our original gamma

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:53.240
and then 2 more could those two angles be indeed

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:57.660
alpha and beta well you can kinda guess that this

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:00.870
angle is bigger

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:04.250
than the next one

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:07.650
by the way it looks so perhaps that will
be

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:12.330
the 45 alpha  because alpha was bigger
than beta

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:16.289
could this be forty five

00:07:16.289 --> 00:07:21.479
and let's try as detectives figure out
where it could come from this picture

00:07:21.479 --> 00:07:24.550
it is involved in this

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:29.360
large triangle

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:33.020
did we see a similar situation earlier in
the problem

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:36.259
certainly right here where we saw

00:07:36.259 --> 00:07:40.000
our original alpha and where we decided
that

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.349
alpha is 45 degrees because this was

00:07:44.349 --> 00:07:47.720
ABE

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:50.830
was a right isosceles triangle

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:54.750
do we have a right isosceles triangle her

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:58.949
we might could EH

00:07:58.949 --> 00:08:04.389
be equal to HD these are the two extra
segments that we draw on top

00:08:04.389 --> 00:08:08.539
the answer is yes because

00:08:08.539 --> 00:08:12.780
these two segments are hypotenuses

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:16.949
Hypoteni or hypotenuses?

00:08:16.949 --> 00:08:21.789
so EH and HD the two segments
which we drew

00:08:21.789 --> 00:08:25.731
are the hypotenuses of two right triangles

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:29.860
two that we also draw on top so I'm going
to mark them

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:33.979
in blue

00:08:33.979 --> 00:08:39.050
so these two sides are hypotenuses of  two right triangles

00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:42.279
E F H and H I D

00:08:42.279 --> 00:08:46.550
the ones which I drew in blue now
they are right because they have a right

00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:47.399
angle here

00:08:47.399 --> 00:08:52.370
coming from top but they are also exactly the
same

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:55.600
size and shape this right triangle has
one leg

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:59.950
two and the other leg 1 and this one also has a leg of two and leg of 1

00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:04.250
which means that their third size, the two

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:08.269
hypotenuses must be the same so
indeed

00:09:08.269 --> 00:09:13.180
EH is equal to HD

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:17.870
and we are on our way to show that
this big green triangle in the middle

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:21.920
is right isosceles it's already
isoseles but the question is why is this

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:23.140
guy right

00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:27.110
okay but what else is around this angle

00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:30.339
there is this guy here

00:09:30.339 --> 00:09:34.000
this angle in this other one

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.269
what do they add up to and  the answer is also very simple

00:09:39.269 --> 00:09:43.209
one of thise angles we already know I claim

00:09:43.209 --> 00:09:46.950
this angle is our angle beta

00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:52.690
because there is a third triangle which
is precisely the same shape

00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:57.959
and size as those because it is right here

00:09:57.959 --> 00:10:01.110
again a right triangle

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:05.250
with legs 1 and two and so therefore this
angle beta

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:08.329
must be equal to this single beta and guess what

00:10:08.329 --> 00:10:12.550
it must be equal to this angle beta they
all share exactly

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:16.570
the same angle so accidentaly

00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:20.660
we have shown that we have moved angle beta to where we wanted it

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:26.570
gamma is there and if that is really 45 we will be done

00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:31.399
and again backtracking we wanted to show
that this big triangle was right

00:10:31.399 --> 00:10:32.870
isosceles

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:37.459
we already know that this angle here is
beta what is this guy

00:10:37.459 --> 00:10:41.140
well this guy this second angle

00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:44.649
participates in a right triangle where the other

00:10:44.649 --> 00:10:48.620
acute angle is beta what could this
guy be

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:53.040
we know that the angles in a triangle
add up to 180

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:58.320
this guy is  ninety therefore these 2 must add up to 90

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:02.060
simple arithmetic shows

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:06.079
this angle here must be ninety minus
beta

00:11:06.079 --> 00:11:09.899
ninety minus beta something and beta

00:11:09.899 --> 00:11:12.959
must overall give you 180

00:11:12.959 --> 00:11:16.450
what is the remaining angle here

00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:20.010
this curly one if you start adding up
let's do it

00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:23.660
beta plus ninety minus beta

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:27.190
plus something must be 180

00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:30.950
so beta goes away and that's
something

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:34.730
turns out to the our 90 degrees

00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:40.360
you've done it! that's right so our angle
alpha is indeed moved here along with beta

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:44.350
and we can conclude the the three angles

00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:47.709
add up to 90 degrees

00:11:47.709 --> 00:11:51.220
and this is an amazing construction which

00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:54.519
uses only squares

00:11:54.519 --> 00:11:57.880
isosceles triangles in congruent

00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:02.010
right triangle with legs 1 and 2

00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:04.860
and that is indeed a brilliant approach

00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:08.010
which mathematicians take to solve
problems

00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:11.050
they complete it to what's missing there

00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:16.110
and then the problem becomes easier
