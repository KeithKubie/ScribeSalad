00:00:01.367 --> 00:00:03.900
Why are there are
seven million people,

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:10.367
and why do each one of us
have our own fingerprint?

00:00:10.367 --> 00:00:12.300
Even twins have
different fingerprints--

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.367
Why?

00:00:13.367 --> 00:00:15.767
Who are otherwise
genetically identical.

00:00:15.767 --> 00:00:16.834
Why?

00:00:16.834 --> 00:00:19.834
Would you rather
we were all the same?

00:00:19.834 --> 00:00:20.633
No.

00:00:20.633 --> 00:00:21.734
I'm--

00:00:21.734 --> 00:00:24.100
Why is that more odd
to you than the fact

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.200
that we all have
different personalities?

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.333
We have different talent.

00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:29.800
But personalities
can be based on--

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:30.900
On what you learn.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.033
Environment-- nurture,
and not just nature.

00:00:34.033 --> 00:00:35.066
Right.

00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:36.400
So I thought about
it the other day,

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.400
and it kind of made me spin.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.266
It's just like, we all have
different fingerprints.

00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:41.400
OK, I get it.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.567
Grand design?

00:00:42.567 --> 00:00:45.300
Well, so it's an
intriguing fact.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.233
But here's something
that may relate.

00:00:49.233 --> 00:00:53.567
Most people who could be
born will never be born,

00:00:53.567 --> 00:00:56.433
will never even exist.

00:00:56.433 --> 00:00:58.200
Like sperm.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.166
OK.
Yeah, sure.

00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:00.233
Yeah.
Yeah.

00:01:00.233 --> 00:01:01.533
One gets in--
- I mean, it's science.

00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:02.867
The rest don't.

00:01:02.867 --> 00:01:03.967
So where do they go?

00:01:03.967 --> 00:01:09.100
They're part of the
number of human beings

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.200
that will never, ever be born.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.967
Well, is that because
there's not enough souls?

00:01:13.967 --> 00:01:15.700
There's already so many
people in the world, though.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.367
That would be something
if you ran out of souls.

00:01:17.367 --> 00:01:19.166
What would a soulless
person look like?

00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:21.333
Do you believe
you have a soul?

00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:23.967
I don't know what a soul is.

00:01:23.967 --> 00:01:25.100
I know there's what--

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.767
here's something that
freaks me out every day.

00:01:26.767 --> 00:01:29.333
Every morning, I wake
up and I say, how is it

00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:32.834
that every morning I wake up
as me and not as someone else?

00:01:32.834 --> 00:01:34.300
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.467
I have that same
feeling sometimes.

00:01:35.467 --> 00:01:37.633
It's like, this
is weird being me.

00:01:37.633 --> 00:01:38.967
What is it like being you?
- Right.

00:01:38.967 --> 00:01:39.934
Well, that's what I'm saying.

00:01:39.934 --> 00:01:42.033
It's like, why am
I me every day?

00:01:42.033 --> 00:01:42.967
How does that happen?

00:01:42.967 --> 00:01:45.767
[explosion sound]

00:01:45.767 --> 00:01:48.433
We have these
electrochemicals in our head.

00:01:48.433 --> 00:01:50.433
And somehow, that's me.

00:01:50.433 --> 00:01:55.800
And I'm me every day,
as far as I know.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.100
As far as--

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.333
I wonder, if I woke up as a
different person each day,

00:02:00.333 --> 00:02:01.333
would I know it?
