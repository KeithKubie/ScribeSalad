they're arguing about maybe that's kind

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210
they're arguing about maybe that's kind
 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.209
they're arguing about maybe that's kind
of the joke or kind of the drama that I

00:04:36.209 --> 00:04:36.219
of the joke or kind of the drama that I
 

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:38.219
of the joke or kind of the drama that I
don't know but you just know they had

actually for me I almost took it as they
almost showed that they can write an

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:26.500
almost showed that they can write an
 

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.280
almost showed that they can write an
episode focusing around Finn and or

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:29.290
episode focusing around Finn and or
 

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:31.830

Marceline without having to have Jake

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:31.840
Marceline without having to have Jake
 

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:34.800
Marceline without having to have Jake
there as like his comedic companion or

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:34.810
there as like his comedic companion or
 

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:36.270
there as like his comedic companion or
the one to get him out of every

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:36.280
the one to get him out of every
 

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:36.990
the one to get him out of every
situation

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:37.000
situation
 

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.480
situation
it felt more like no this is just a Finn

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:39.490
it felt more like no this is just a Finn
 

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:41.820
it felt more like no this is just a Finn
episode Finn doesn't need Jake all the

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:41.830
episode Finn doesn't need Jake all the
 

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:43.290
episode Finn doesn't need Jake all the
time he doesn't always need to be there

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:43.300
time he doesn't always need to be there
 

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:45.120
time he doesn't always need to be there
because the entire time he's obviously

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:45.130
because the entire time he's obviously
 

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:46.950
because the entire time he's obviously
in his pocket and he never hops up to

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:46.960
in his pocket and he never hops up to
 

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:48.960
in his pocket and he never hops up to
help and Finn never asks for help so I

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:48.970
help and Finn never asks for help so I
 

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:50.610
help and Finn never asks for help so I
think those kind of a mill Finn can

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:50.620
think those kind of a mill Finn can
 

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:52.500
think those kind of a mill Finn can

design I mean initially I never thought

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:10.960
design I mean initially I never thought
 

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:13.680
design I mean initially I never thought
about the show from like the design

00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:13.690
about the show from like the design
 

00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:15.780
about the show from like the design
aspect I was always like oh this is

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:15.790
aspect I was always like oh this is
 

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:17.370

pretty neat but every time you say it

00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:17.380
pretty neat but every time you say it
 

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:19.110

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:19.120
it's like yeah you're right the
 

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:21.600
it's like yeah you're right the
designers say so good yeah and it takes

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:21.610
designers say so good yeah and it takes
 

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:23.940
designers say so good yeah and it takes
so much creativity in such abstract

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:23.950
so much creativity in such abstract
 

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:26.550
so much creativity in such abstract
thinking to come up with these ideas oh

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:26.560
thinking to come up with these ideas oh
 

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:28.200
thinking to come up with these ideas oh
you know how to come up with these looks

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:28.210
you know how to come up with these looks
 

00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:30.660

so yeah and this one because when it
 

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:32.310
so yeah and this one because when it
started out I wasn't a fan of the

00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:32.320
started out I wasn't a fan of the
 

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:34.170

you know everything else just in what at
 

00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:41.730
you know everything else just in what at
the time I was like yeah creative but

00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:41.740
the time I was like yeah creative but
 

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:43.470
