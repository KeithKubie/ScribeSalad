00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.110
If you're interested in becoming
an investor, what are things to do or

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:04.610
what are things to think about?

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:09.690
And the first thing I tell people is
to get out Excel and do the math.

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.180
Knowing that if 19 out of 20
companies are going to fail and

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.950
you're going to invest
a certain amount of money.

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.670
One, how many companies
do you need to invest in?

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:19.950
If 19 of 20 are going to fail,

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:22.330
investing in one company is
not going to help you out.

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:28.840
The other thing is,
how much do you have to spread your bet?

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.816
And then,
what kind of returns do you need to see?

00:00:32.816 --> 00:00:36.314
And it is very enlightening,
in particular, actually even if you're

00:00:36.314 --> 00:00:39.423
an entrepreneur, doing that
math is incredibly insightful.

00:00:39.423 --> 00:00:41.170
Because then when you're
talking to the investor,

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.120
you're kind of seeing it from
the other side of the table.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.710
And they're seeing how
they're evaluating your idea.
