00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.800
What I've got here is the graph
of y is equal to cosine of x.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.980
What I want to do is
figure out the area

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.010
under the curve y is equal to
f of x, and above the x-axis.

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:14.850
I'm going to do it
over various intervals.

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.970
So first, let's think about
the area under the curve,

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:24.715
between x is equal to 0 and
x is equal to pi over 2.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.024
So we're talking about
this area right over here.

00:00:33.024 --> 00:00:35.440
Well, the way we denote it is
the definite integral from 0

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.800
to pi over 2 of cosine of x dx.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.320
And remember, all
this is, is kind of,

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.270
it's reminiscent of
taking a sum of a bunch

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.060
of super thin rectangles
with width dx and height

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.751
f of x for each of
those rectangles.

00:00:51.751 --> 00:00:53.250
And then you take
an infinite number

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.390
of those infinitely
thin rectangles.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.000
And that's kind of what this
notation is trying to depict.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.490
But we know how to
do this already.

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.360
The second fundamental
theorem of calculus helps us.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.900
We just have to figure out what
the antiderivative of cosine

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.180
of x is.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.090
Or what an antiderivative
of cosine of x is.

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.150
Evaluate it at pi
over 2, and from that

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.750
subtract it evaluated at 0.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.110
So what's the antiderivative
of cosine of x?

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.286
Or what's an antiderivative?

00:01:20.286 --> 00:01:22.160
Well, we know if we take
the derivative-- let

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.900
me write this up here.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.920
We know that if we take the
derivative of sine of x,

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.250
we get cosine of x.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.520
So the antiderivative of
cosine of x is sine of x

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.550
Now, why do I keep saying sine
of x is an antiderivative?

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.820
It's not just the
antiderivative.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.110
Well, I could also
take the derivative

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.490
of sine of x plus any
arbitrary constant,

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.780
and still get cosine of x.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.530
Because the derivative
of a constant is 0.

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.040
This could be pi, this could
be 5, this could be a million,

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.730
this could be a googol, this
could be any crazy number.

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.180
But the derivative of this is
still going to be cosine x.

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.840
So when I say that we just have
to find an antiderivative, I'm

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.810
just saying, look, we just have
to find one of the derivatives.

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.449
Sine of x is probably the
simplest, because in this case

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:12.800
the constant is 0.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.120
So let's evaluate.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.530
So one way that we
can denote this,

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.590
the antiderivative cosine, or
an antiderivative of cosine

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.900
of x is sine of x.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.620
And we're going to
evaluate at pi over 2.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.780
And from that, subtract
and evaluate it at 0.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.620
So this is going to
be equal to-- let

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.720
me do it right over here.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:39.530
This is going to be equal
to sine of pi over 2 minus

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.210
sine of 0, which is equal
to sine of pi over 2 is 1.

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:45.280
Sine of 0 is 0.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.630
So it's 1 minus 0 is equal to 1.

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.290
So the area of this region
right over here, this area

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.310
is equal to 1.

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.620
Now let's do
something interesting.

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.970
Let's think about the area.

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:06.770
Let's think about the area
under the curve between,

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.970
let's say pi over
2 and 3 pi over 2.

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.870
So between here and here.

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.460
So we're talking
about this area.

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:26.860
We're talking about that
area right over here.

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.760
This is 3 pi over 2.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.980
So once again, the
way we denote the area

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.670
is the definite integral from pi
over 2 to 3 pi over 2 of cosine

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.600
of x dx.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.300
The antiderivative-- or an
antiderivative of cosine of x

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.060
is sine of x.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.490
Evaluated at 3 pi
over 2 and pi over 2.

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:48.770
So this is going
to be equal to sine

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:55.330
of 3 pi over 2 minus
sine of pi over 2.

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.480
What's sine of 3 pi over 2?

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.950
If we visualize the unit
circle really fast, 3 pi over 2

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.270
is going all the way 3/4
around the unit circle.

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:07.490
So it's right over there.

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:11.340
So sine is the y-coordinate
on that unit circle.

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:12.400
So it's negative 1.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.580
So this right over
here is negative 1.

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:18.279
This right over here,
sine of pi over 2

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:20.620
is just going
straight up like that.

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.852
So sine of pi over 2 is 1.

00:04:22.852 --> 00:04:23.810
So this is interesting.

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.840
We get negative 1 minus 1,
which is equal to negative 2.

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.760
We've got a negative area here.

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.120
We got a negative area.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.650
Now how does that make sense?

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.450
We know in the real world,
areas are always positive.

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.780
But what is negative 2
really trying to depict?

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.730
Well, it's trying to
sign it based on the idea

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:46.110
that now our function
is below the x-axis.

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.310
So we could kind of think
we have an area of 2,

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.570
but it's all below the
x-axis in this case.

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:53.110
And so it is signed
as negative 2.

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.600
The actual area is 2, but
since it's below the x-axis,

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.160
we get a negative
right over here.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.220
Now let's do one
more interesting one.

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:04.890
Let's find the definite
integral from 0

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:11.310
to 3 pi over 2 of
cosine of x dx.

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.940
Now this is just denoting
this entire area.

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:19.590
Going from 0 all
the way 3 pi over 2.

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:22.190
And what do you think
is going to happen?

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:23.520
Well, let's evaluate it.

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:30.710
It's going to be sine of 3
pi over 2 minus sine of 0.

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:37.560
Which is equal to
negative 1 minus 0,

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.890
which is equal to negative 1.

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:41.300
So what just happened here?

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:44.450
The area under, all this orange
area that I just outlined,

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:50.150
is clearly not negative, or any
area isn't a negative number.

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:51.840
And the area isn't even 1.

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.320
But what just happened here?

00:05:53.320 --> 00:06:00.370
Well, we saw in the first case
that this first area was 1.

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:03.780
The area of this first
region right over here is 1.

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.610
And then the area of the second
region, we got negative 2.

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:13.250
And so one way to
interpret it is

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:19.400
that your net area above
the x-axis is negative 1,

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.880
or another way to say it,
your net area is negative 1.

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:27.530
So it's taking the 1
region above the x-axis

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:29.950
and subtracting the 2 below it.

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:31.560
So what the definite
integral is doing

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.560
when we evaluate it using the
second fundamental theorem

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.760
of calculus, it's
essentially finding

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:40.629
the net area above the x-axis.

00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:42.170
And if we get a
negative number, that

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:44.920
means that the net area is act--
that actually most of the area

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.680
is below the x-axis.

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:50.116
If we get 0, then that
means it all nets out.

00:06:50.116 --> 00:06:51.740
And if you want to
see a case that's 0,

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:58.570
take the integral from 0 all
the way all the way 2 pi.

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:01.100
And this will evaluate to 0
because you have an area of 1

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:03.380
and another area of
1, but it nets out

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:04.800
with this area of negative 2.

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.070
Let's try that out.

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:10.460
So if we go from 0 to
2 pi of cosine of x dx,

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:15.970
this is going to be equal to
sine of 2 pi minus sine of 0,

00:07:15.970 --> 00:07:19.960
which is equal to 0 minus 0,
which is indeed equal to 0.

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:21.680
Now clearly there was
area here, but all

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.560
of the area that
was above the x-axis

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:27.134
netted out with all the area
that was below the x-axis.
