a few years ago a leading scientific
 

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:11.199
a few years ago a leading scientific
company had a specific challenge it was

00:00:11.199 --> 00:00:11.209
company had a specific challenge it was
 

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:13.299
company had a specific challenge it was
a toothpaste company and they make

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:13.309
a toothpaste company and they make
 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:15.310
a toothpaste company and they make
different fluorides for their toothpaste

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:15.320
different fluorides for their toothpaste
 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.920
different fluorides for their toothpaste
but there was a big mechanical problem

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:17.930
but there was a big mechanical problem
 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.140
but there was a big mechanical problem
the fluoride was getting stuck in the

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:20.150
the fluoride was getting stuck in the
 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.569
the fluoride was getting stuck in the
equipment and it wasn't meshing well the

00:00:22.569 --> 00:00:22.579
equipment and it wasn't meshing well the
 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:24.580
equipment and it wasn't meshing well the
company had engaged all their top

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:24.590
company had engaged all their top
 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.499
company had engaged all their top
chemists to try to figure out what the

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:26.509
chemists to try to figure out what the
 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:28.929
chemists to try to figure out what the
problem was and no one could solve it it

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:28.939
problem was and no one could solve it it
 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:30.850
problem was and no one could solve it it
was taking months and months and time

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:30.860
was taking months and months and time
 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:32.920
was taking months and months and time
and costing hundreds of thousands of

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930
and costing hundreds of thousands of
 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.920
and costing hundreds of thousands of
dollars at that point so the executive

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930
dollars at that point so the executive
 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.900
dollars at that point so the executive
on the team said you know what we have

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910
on the team said you know what we have
 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.030

not been able to solve this who else

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040
not been able to solve this who else
 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.100

could we engage what other networks

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.110
could we engage what other networks
 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.830
could we engage what other networks
could help us solve this problem so the

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840
could help us solve this problem so the
 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.050
could help us solve this problem so the

you're solving a problem today how can

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260
you're solving a problem today how can
 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.650
