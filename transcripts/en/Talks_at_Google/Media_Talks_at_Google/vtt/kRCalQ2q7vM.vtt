RICHARD GINGRAS: I'm so
delighted to do this.

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.930
I'm Richard Gingras,
Senior Product Director

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:10.820
for News and Social.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:12.310
I've known Anna
for, I don't know,

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:14.390
three, four, five years
now, and it's just

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:19.130
always been a pleasure
spending time with you,

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.340
both for the
crispness of your mind

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.210
and the wonderful appeal
of your sense of humor.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.710
So--

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:25.920
ANNA HOLMES: Thank you.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:26.420
RICHARD GINGRAS: Thank you.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:27.120
And that obviously--

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.670
ANNA HOLMES: Thanks
for having me.

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:29.660
RICHARD GINGRAS: --that
always shows in what you do.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:30.810
But it's great to have you here.

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:31.768
ANNA HOLMES: Thank you.

00:00:31.768 --> 00:00:34.190
RICHARD GINGRAS: So recently,
Anna published-- just

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.502
came out with a book,
"The Book of Jezebel."

00:00:36.502 --> 00:00:38.210
But I thought today,
we'd actually talked

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:39.120
about a bit more than.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.745
We'll talk about "The
Book of Jezebel,"

00:00:40.745 --> 00:00:45.320
but I also want to talk about
Jezebel in and of itself.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.110
One of things that occurs
to me, as I think many of us

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.350
in this room know,
is as we've seen

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.320
very dramatic changes
in the underlying media

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.890
ecosystem, that
creates opportunities,

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.720
and, indeed, the need, on the
part of traditional publishers,

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.950
to figure out how do
they create products

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.940
appropriate for this medium.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.950
And in a similar fashion, as
cultures change and evolve,

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.700
there are also
opportunities for new voices

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.100
to appear and address
those cultural changes

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.830
with the audiences that
are affected by them.

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:27.110
I think the interesting
thing about homes in Jezebel

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.450
is that in founding Jezebel
she's really done both.

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.750
Both, being considerably
hard, figuring out

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.130
what kind of product
can work in this realm,

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.390
and Jezebel has,
indeed, and continues

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.020
to work in this realm.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.670
And also, in figuring out how
to address a media landscape

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.050
with an approach that makes
sense for the new culture,

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:54.410
for the evolving culture.

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:59.180
And in that, with
Jezebel, she created,

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.330
a site which was
unapologetic in its politics

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.389
and its sensibilities,
provocative, funny, insightful,

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:10.949
sometimes profane.

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:13.220
Anna, I know, hoped
that it would be,

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.720
and I believe, to
an extent, it has,

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.570
but I'll have you address that
at some point, an antidote

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:22.910
to the historical superficiality
in a relevance of women's media

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:23.920
properties.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.420
A little bit of her background,
and then we'll start getting

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.272
into the why's and where's.

00:02:28.272 --> 00:02:30.730
Because you weren't born with
a silver spoon in your mouth.

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.865
You were--

00:02:30.865 --> 00:02:30.910
ANNA HOLMES: Uh-uh.

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.920
RICHARD GINGRAS: --born in
Sacramento, raised in Davis.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.765
I believe your mom
was a schoolteacher,

00:02:34.765 --> 00:02:39.390
your dad a park ranger in
the National Park Service.

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.423
In the late '90s you went to
New York, started out, as a--

00:02:42.423 --> 00:02:43.170
ANNA HOLMES: Actually,
in the early '90s.

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.300
RICHARD GINGRAS: Early '90s.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.883
ANNA HOLMES: I'm
older than you think.

00:02:45.883 --> 00:02:48.512
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:48.512 --> 00:02:50.220
RICHARD GINGRAS:
Started out as an intern

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.110
at "The New Yorker." you worked
at places like "Glamour,"

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.140
"Entertainment Weekly," "HBO."

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.130
All, I think, good
experiences for you

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.700
to understand at least the
traditional media environment.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:08.296
And then went off to do
what you did with Jezebel.

00:03:08.296 --> 00:03:11.820
You left Jezebel
in 2010, and then

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.404
went on to do the
book of Jezebel, which

00:03:14.404 --> 00:03:16.820
if you haven't looked at it,
it's really a wonderful book.

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.400
And its, I think, both
seriously irreverent

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.680
and irreverently serious.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.520
As, I think, befits the brand.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.430
And by the way, I don't
know if you noticed,

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.960
but you actually now get
a Google auto suggest,

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.450
if you type in "Anna Holmes is."

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:32.233
ANNA HOLMES: Oh.

00:03:32.233 --> 00:03:33.159
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:35.480
ANNA HOLMES: God.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.602
Why would you do that? [LAUGH]

00:03:37.602 --> 00:03:38.560
RICHARD GINGRAS: I did.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.590
I did.

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.150
But so far, all good,
because all it says

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.390
is Anna Holmes is the
founder of Jezebel.

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:46.270
ANNA HOLMES: Oh, OK.

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:47.860
RICHARD GINGRAS:
So congratulations.

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:48.840
ANNA HOLMES: I
don't Google myself.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:49.820
RICHARD GINGRAS: No, that's--

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.025
ANNA HOLMES: I like Google,
but I don't Google myself.

00:03:52.025 --> 00:03:54.483
RICHARD GINGRAS: You really
should put that on your resume.

00:03:54.483 --> 00:03:55.622
ANNA HOLMES: OK. [LAUGH]

00:03:55.622 --> 00:03:58.080
RICHARD GINGRAS: So, but let's
start talking, first of all,

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.160
about the creation
of Jezebel itself.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:04.950
And before I do, I think
appropriate context.

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.570
When I was going
through the book,

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:11.230
I came upon the definition
for lady journalist, which

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.200
has four definitions,
and I'll read the four.

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.930
One, thin, pretty,
30-something woman

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.060
who is sometimes allowed
to handle the less

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.660
hard-hitting television news.

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.450
Two, a writer capable
of covering fashion,

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.400
celebrity gossip,
and the mommy wars

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.490
who's better off leaving
long-form investigative

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.420
reporting to more
qualified colleagues.

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.430
Three, just like
regular journalists,

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.460
only without the awards.

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.020
And four, a smart,
tough woman who

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.680
loves news enough to fight
through all that bullshit

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.642
and do it anyway.

00:04:42.642 --> 00:04:43.350
ANNA HOLMES: Hmm.

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:44.330
RICHARD GINGRAS: And it
seemed, quite frankly,

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:45.440
that number four is you.

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:46.620
ANNA HOLMES: Oh.

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:47.120
Thanks.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.810
RICHARD GINGRAS: So
tell us about that,

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.670
because I'm sure creating
Jezebel was filled

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:56.185
with complexities
and challenges.

00:04:56.185 --> 00:04:57.310
I'd love to hear the story.

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:58.810
ANNA HOLMES: OK.

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.060
I'll tell you the story a bit.

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.500
If it goes on too long
than you should-- because--

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.791
RICHARD GINGRAS: Feel free to--

00:05:03.791 --> 00:05:05.800
ANNA HOLMES: --it
could be a long story.

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.415
I guess I should
start with the fact

00:05:07.415 --> 00:05:09.120
that I had worked
at women's magazines

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.880
before I started the site.

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.820
And when I say
women's magazines,

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:15.680
I mean women's
service magazines,

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.210
such as "Glamour"
and "In Style."

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.900
I also worked at
"Celebrity" magazines.

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.020
Sometimes those two
things intersect, women's

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.241
magazines and
celebrity magazines.

00:05:26.241 --> 00:05:27.990
And that was more just
kind of a function.

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:29.400
That wasn't so much my interest.

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.730
But that's where the jobs
were in New York in media.

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:35.460
And a lot of my
other female friends,

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.802
who may be arrived in New
York and thought oh, we

00:05:37.802 --> 00:05:40.260
want to work for "Harper's,"
or "The Atlantic," or "The New

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.940
Yorker," found ourselves
working in much more

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:47.190
commercial publications,
a lot of which

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:49.160
we didn't like or agree with.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.079
That was me.

00:05:51.079 --> 00:05:52.870
I wouldn't say that I
hated celebrity news,

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:57.010
I just was kind of ambivalent
about it or bored by it.

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:58.980
And with regards to
women's magazines,

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:04.490
I actively hated them, because I
felt that they were patronizing

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:09.100
and were repeating
the same messages over

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.980
and over and over again
to young women, which

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:15.130
were along the
lines of be obsessed

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:18.200
with men, romantically.

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.220
Thereby, totally pushing out
women who were not interested

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:24.070
in men, so they were
very heteronormative.

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:27.680
They were about finding a man--
and I said this line a lot,

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.930
so if you're heard it, you're
going to hear it again.

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:32.051
So they were about finding
a man, keeping a man,

00:06:32.051 --> 00:06:34.050
pleasing a man, making
sure he doesn't leave you

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:36.130
for another woman.

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:41.140
Not really about women
and what they wanted,

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:45.630
but women being afraid of
losing things at all times.

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:48.530
And also they were very obsessed
with physical appearance,

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:50.345
and dieting, and
so on and so forth.

00:06:50.345 --> 00:06:53.360
And it's just so snooze
worthy, and it was offensive.

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:58.980
Because I could be a 32-year-old
and think that I had some sort

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:03.490
of buffer against the messages
that were being communicated

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:06.690
in these magazines, and maybe
I did, and maybe I didn't.

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:10.310
But I knew for a fact that
there were younger women who

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:13.430
were probably more influenced by
those messages in the same way

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:18.410
that maybe I had been when
I had been 18 or 20 or 22.

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:21.074
So I really hated all the jobs
I had at women's magazines,

00:07:21.074 --> 00:07:22.990
because I felt like I
was part of the problem.

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:24.830
But I needed to pay my rent.

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:28.210
I couldn't be like oh, I'm
going to go write a novel.

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:31.740
And at the time
that Jezebel first

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:35.360
started getting discussed,
it was late 2006

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.880
and I was working at "In
Style," which of all the women's

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:40.280
magazines I'd worked for,
was the least offensive

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:41.863
because it was pretty
straightforward.

00:07:41.863 --> 00:07:45.272
It was about there would
be a celebrity on the cover

00:07:45.272 --> 00:07:46.980
and there would be an
interview with her.

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:49.360
And maybe some pictures
from her house, and then

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:52.350
someone else's house
further in the magazine.

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:53.860
And maybe a spread
of the dresses

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:56.700
for spring and maybe
some makeup tips.

00:07:56.700 --> 00:08:00.050
I mean that was much
less offensive to me

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:02.120
than how to lose 30
pounds in 30 days,

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:07.120
or how to use a hair
scrunchie in a sex act.

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.910
That sort of stuff.

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:10.970
So "In Style" was
actually, again,

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:13.460
pretty inoffensive,
so I wasn't as riled

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:15.400
up about women's
magazines as I had been.

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:17.230
But in late 2006
there was a woman

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:19.290
I'd worked with at a
celebrity magazine, who

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:22.040
was my friend, who was
friends with Nick Denton.

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:24.510
And Nick Denton
owns Gawker Media.

00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:29.780
And he wanted her to start what
he was calling girly gawker.

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:32.854
That was a placeholder
name, I think.

00:08:32.854 --> 00:08:35.070
One of his colleagues is
over here in the front row.

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:37.630
So I'm pretty sure girly
gawker was a placeholder name.

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:39.360
So the friend of
mine, Geraldine,

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:41.610
asked me if I'd be
interested in working

00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:43.914
on this project with her,
and I said no, immediately.

00:08:43.914 --> 00:08:45.830
The first thing I said
was no, no, no, no, no.

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:49.800
Because I was a consumer
of the internet,

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:55.020
in the sense that I bought
things on Amazon or eBay.

00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:57.710
I read the internet, and then
I read "The New York Times"

00:08:57.710 --> 00:08:59.620
online, or I read
CNN.com, or I read

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:02.040
"Gawker," or any
number of blogs.

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.510
But is was still not an
environment in which people

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:07.527
in mainstream media
or print media,

00:09:07.527 --> 00:09:09.610
they were not moving over
to the internet, really,

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:12.250
at least the ones that
I knew, and because they

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:13.460
weren't getting paid well.

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:16.754
And the whole knock
against Gawker Media,

00:09:16.754 --> 00:09:18.170
up until that
point, was that they

00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:19.680
didn't pay people very well.

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:21.870
They were paying bloggers
maybe $12 a post.

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:23.930
And at the time I was
34 and I was probably

00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:30.206
making $80,000, $90,000 as
an editor at "In Style,"

00:09:30.206 --> 00:09:32.330
and there was no way I was
going to take a job that

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:35.590
was going to pay me half that.

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:37.480
I didn't have a trust
fund, unfortunately.

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:39.870
So, I said, no,
but then we spent

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:42.100
about two hours talking
about what it could be.

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:44.960
And in this iteration, it was
to be very celebrity focused.

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:47.220
So we just figured we'd
make snarky comments

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:50.120
about celebrity culture.

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:52.430
She then decided,
Geraldine the friend,

00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:55.250
to not work on the
site, for reasons

00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:57.010
that are somewhat
unknown to me, but it

00:09:57.010 --> 00:09:59.218
had to do with her wanting
to go back home to England

00:09:59.218 --> 00:10:00.830
to be closer to her family.

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:06.082
And so I was asked by Nick
Denton and his deputy-- Well,

00:10:06.082 --> 00:10:07.040
I guess I wasn't asked.

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:09.540
It's they told me that I was
going to be running or starting

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:11.190
this on my own.

00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:12.900
And at that point,
maybe the parameters

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:15.880
had been broadened beyond
celebrity to include fashion.

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:19.840
And I thought, OK, I can
oversee media property that

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:22.170
covers that stuff
because I've certainly

00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:24.544
worked within those
genres before,

00:10:24.544 --> 00:10:26.960
but I find the way that they've
been presented in the past

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:27.790
to be offensive.

00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:30.180
And so I wanted to
create a women's site

00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:32.930
that would incorporate
those topics,

00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:34.800
but not focus on
them exclusively.

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:38.120
That would treat them or
present them in a smart way.

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:41.680
That would not purport
to tell the readers

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:43.690
who or what they should be.

00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:46.380
Would not promote
conspicuous consumption.

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:49.790
Because I really felt, at that
time, in 2006, 2007, so many

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:54.410
of these magazines were all
about $1,000 Louis Vuitton

00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:54.960
purses.

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:57.780
And it was like a
frenzy of acquisition.

00:10:57.780 --> 00:10:59.769
It was crazy, and I
found it offensive,

00:10:59.769 --> 00:11:01.435
and most people can't
afford that stuff,

00:11:01.435 --> 00:11:06.670
or oftentimes they were spending
their paychecks on crap.

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:09.430
And I just felt women were
really being ill-served.

00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:11.930
I kind of felt it was tied into
the "Sex In The City" stuff.

00:11:11.930 --> 00:11:16.370
This like obsession with
name brands and luxury goods.

00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:18.020
I found it really gross.

00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:21.996
So when I was conceiving
of what this site would be,

00:11:21.996 --> 00:11:22.870
it was pretty simple.

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:25.990
It was that it would be
something I'd want to read,

00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:30.370
and it would be a kind of
rebuke to women's magazines,

00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:33.670
because the whole kind ethos
of Gawker Media at that time

00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:36.860
was that their sites
when after the big boys.

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:40.510
So Gawker itself went
after large media companies

00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:43.210
on a regular basis, like
Conde Nast, and Time Inc.,

00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:44.510
and Hearst.

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:48.830
ESPN was in the
crosshairs of Deadspin.

00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:53.014
Apple was often being
taunted by Gizmodo.

00:11:53.014 --> 00:11:55.430
So it made sense that we would
go after women's magazines.

00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:57.720
And I felt that I
knew just the way

00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:01.170
to do it because I had a lot
of decades of frustration

00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:02.430
with them pent up.

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:05.944
But in addition to that, that
would kind of announce what

00:12:05.944 --> 00:12:08.360
we weren't, which is to say
to go after women's magazines,

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:10.190
but announce what we
were not going to be.

00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:14.090
But we would also have
content that you didn't often

00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:17.790
find in women's
magazines, like politics,

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:21.930
and a vibrant kind of
constant repetitive discussion

00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:24.510
of politics, whether that's
electoral politics or gender

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:25.310
politics.

00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:27.370
Because all the women
I knew did not just

00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:29.470
want to talk about
fashion and celebrity.

00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:32.160
They were much more
diverse and well-rounded.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:34.975
And in terms of diversity,
that was another thing that

00:12:34.975 --> 00:12:36.637
had bugged me, which
was that the world

00:12:36.637 --> 00:12:38.470
I lived in, and granted
I lived in New York,

00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:41.190
which is a very diverse city.

00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:43.010
But the world I lived
in was not reflected

00:12:43.010 --> 00:12:44.720
on the pages of
women's magazines

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:45.900
or even in a lot of media.

00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:48.040
It was very, very, very white.

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:50.277
And I am not white,
and I felt that was--

00:12:50.277 --> 00:12:52.110
I don't know if I'd use
the word offensive--

00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:56.270
but it wasn't in
keeping with the times,

00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:59.060
because it was, at that point,
2007, and I was seeing a lot

00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:03.570
more-- Everything felt more
global and diverse than it had,

00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:06.364
let's say, when I'd been
growing up in Davis in the '70s.

00:13:06.364 --> 00:13:07.780
But I wasn't seeing
that reflected

00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:10.150
on TV very much
and in magazines.

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:12.500
So that's kind of a
long story, or what

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:16.780
I was thinking about
doing when we were putting

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:18.770
the site together, and
conceiving what kind

00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:22.125
of features would be on
there, and when it got named,

00:13:22.125 --> 00:13:25.050
[LAUGH] by Gabi, who's
sitting in the front row,

00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:27.849
and I hated the name.

00:13:27.849 --> 00:13:29.140
I wouldn't really use the name.

00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:32.110
I wouldn't admit to the name
of the site to people publicly.

00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:34.360
Even like a year later, I
just kind of for some reason

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:36.010
it rubbed me the wrong way.

00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:38.860
RICHARD GINGRAS: Did its
success surprise you?

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:42.640
What were your expectations
when you went in?

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:44.140
ANNA HOLMES: That's
a good question.

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:46.440
Well, I mean I
felt that I was-- I

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:51.789
went into it with a
feeling of a little bit,

00:13:51.789 --> 00:13:53.330
like I was kind of
holding my breath.

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:54.788
Because first of
all, I hadn't been

00:13:54.788 --> 00:13:56.500
planning to start
the site on my own.

00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:58.416
I thought I was going
to do it with my friend,

00:13:58.416 --> 00:14:00.400
and then she drops
out, so now it's on me.

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:03.460
And I was well aware of the
fact that New York media

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:05.560
people read Gawker sites.

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:07.650
And that might be a
tiny little population,

00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:09.860
but their opinion
mattered to me.

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:12.760
And therefore, the site had
to succeed, because if it

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:14.190
didn't, then it would be on me.

00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:17.820
And this would be the
first time my name had ever

00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:19.370
been at the top of something.

00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:22.080
And I really felt that I had
control over whether or not

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:23.060
it succeeded.

00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:24.970
And the way I could
control that was

00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:29.010
that I could just work
my butt off on it.

00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:30.440
So that even if
it didn't succeed,

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:33.350
at least I would know
that I had given my all.

00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:35.476
And that translated into
me working 18 hours a day

00:14:35.476 --> 00:14:36.850
and eventually
getting burned out

00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:38.058
three and a half years later.

00:14:38.058 --> 00:14:41.200
But I had to suspect
that there were

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:45.360
other women my age,
or younger, or older

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:48.960
who were also frustrated
and felt ill-served

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:50.340
by women's media.

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:53.270
I didn't know that
for a fact, but I

00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:56.510
had to assume that they existed,
and that they weren't just

00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:57.926
exactly like me
and my peer group,

00:14:57.926 --> 00:14:59.551
but that they were
all over the country

00:14:59.551 --> 00:15:01.410
and maybe all over the world.

00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:05.000
But I wasn't sure that
it was going to work.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.800
There were some naysayers
who-- I wouldn't

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:11.650
say they were-- maybe they
were just being pessimistic.

00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:14.710
But there were some
naysayers within the company,

00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:16.460
who are my friends,
who weren't sure

00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:18.910
after they saw some of
the test blogs, which

00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:22.915
is to say us doing the
site, but behind a firewall,

00:15:22.915 --> 00:15:24.964
if that's the right word,
before it went live.

00:15:24.964 --> 00:15:26.380
Who kind of went
eh, I don't know,

00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:28.504
because they hadn't seen
anything like that before,

00:15:28.504 --> 00:15:31.120
and I guess I hadn't either.

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:34.460
So I wasn't at all confident
that it was going to succeed,

00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:37.730
but it was one of the only
times in my life, I think,

00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:41.600
when not only when I had
total control over something,

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:43.630
but that I had to
really just believe.

00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:45.740
And it sounds corny,
but believe in myself,

00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:49.134
or believe that other people
would-- that if I built it,

00:15:49.134 --> 00:15:49.800
they would come.

00:15:52.649 --> 00:15:55.190
RICHARD GINGRAS: Can you touch
a little bit on the mechanics,

00:15:55.190 --> 00:16:00.210
because, obviously, folks
here, we don't do editorial.

00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:01.980
How big was the team
when you started?

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:03.340
And how was it constructed?

00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:04.350
How many pieces a day?

00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:07.020
How did you deal
with, as you said,

00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:09.124
were you paying
people $12 a post?

00:16:09.124 --> 00:16:09.790
ANNA HOLMES: No.

00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:11.790
Oh yeah, one thing I
didn't say, the reason

00:16:11.790 --> 00:16:14.480
I decided to do it was
because the editorial director

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:18.285
of the company told me how
much he would pay me per year,

00:16:18.285 --> 00:16:21.696
and he was going to match my
salary, my "In Style" salary.

00:16:21.696 --> 00:16:23.570
And I was like, OK, well
that changes things.

00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:26.780
Because, again, I don't
want to go backwards.

00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:30.020
That said, at the time, they
didn't have health insurance

00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:32.270
or benefits, the company didn't.

00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:33.830
So I was losing
out a little bit,

00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:36.090
but it wasn't-- I think I was
still under the impression that

00:16:36.090 --> 00:16:37.048
I would never get sick.

00:16:37.048 --> 00:16:38.570
Oh, it's OK-- I
don't have to have

00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:41.530
health insurance
for a year or so.

00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:46.550
So was really what made
me decide to go for it.

00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:47.900
But how was it constructed.

00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:51.890
Well, I was given a budget and I
was allowed to hire two people.

00:16:51.890 --> 00:17:00.580
So I hired one woman, Moe, in
maybe March or April of 2007.

00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:04.992
And then the next staffer,
Jennifer, maybe a month later.

00:17:04.992 --> 00:17:06.700
And that was actually
one of the most fun

00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:09.420
times on the site was
sitting around mostly

00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:11.599
with Moe, whose real
name is Maureen,

00:17:11.599 --> 00:17:16.609
and just thinking of ideas and
different features we would do.

00:17:16.609 --> 00:17:20.089
Because were going to
blog, which is to say,

00:17:20.089 --> 00:17:23.449
put up posts that were
reacting to the news of the day

00:17:23.449 --> 00:17:24.490
that we couldn't predict.

00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:27.050
But also, we wanted to have
kind of standalone features

00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:28.410
that we could count on.

00:17:28.410 --> 00:17:31.100
And I feel like we got
paid to sit around and have

00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:31.930
awesome ideas.

00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:36.209
It was really great, and
made us excited for the site

00:17:36.209 --> 00:17:37.000
to actually launch.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.833
So once it launched,
there were three of us.

00:17:38.833 --> 00:17:42.720
I did write probably
four or five posts a day

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:44.220
because there were
only three of us,

00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:48.890
and we were trying to post
once every half an hour or so.

00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:52.330
As the site got
bigger, and I really

00:17:52.330 --> 00:17:56.490
don't if I can pinpoint
when it got bigger.

00:17:56.490 --> 00:18:00.230
But it was successful
pretty quickly,

00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:02.430
in that it got attention,
and it was getting press,

00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:04.440
and there were readers
and they were commenting.

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:06.282
And it seemed like
something was going on.

00:18:06.282 --> 00:18:07.740
But about a month
after the launch,

00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:09.210
I got to hire somebody else.

00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:10.751
And then I got to
hire somebody else.

00:18:10.751 --> 00:18:14.879
And by, I'd say, Fall of 2007,
I had maybe five people total.

00:18:14.879 --> 00:18:16.670
RICHARD GINGRAS: Plus
freelance, I imagine.

00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:18.740
ANNA HOLMES: Yeah.

00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:21.470
I think I still wasn't
willing to use freelancers

00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:25.330
that much then just because
we didn't have a big budget.

00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:29.240
And because I knew that I could
count on these five people

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:30.230
that I had.

00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:31.480
They were easier to deal with.

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:33.870
Like they were easier
to anticipate what

00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:36.470
their various quirks, and
neuroses, and writing styles

00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:38.850
were like.

00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:42.460
And so I'd say that
by a couple months in,

00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:44.470
we were posting once
every 20 minutes.

00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:50.430
It became very neurotic about
scheduling because there

00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:54.060
was so much going on,
that we had to comment on,

00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:57.090
and I wanted it done
in a certain order.

00:18:57.090 --> 00:19:01.830
And in order to keep
my brain from melting,

00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:06.176
I would have us post every 20
minutes or every 10 minutes.

00:19:06.176 --> 00:19:07.550
So you'd see a
little time stamp,

00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:09.132
it would say 9 o'clock, 9:10.

00:19:09.132 --> 00:19:11.340
When I could have just posted
it whenever it was done

00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:12.120
and I'd edited it.

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:16.720
But for some reason, that
added some order to the chaos.

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:19.550
And I'd say by the
second or third year,

00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:22.850
we were posting 70
to 80 things a day,

00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:24.290
which meant that
there were things

00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:26.860
going up every 5 or 10 minutes.

00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:29.230
But it was very
highly scheduled,

00:19:29.230 --> 00:19:35.480
in that things had to
balance each other out.

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:38.310
So the first post that went
up every day was at 9:00.

00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:41.650
I would get up at six, and I
would start finding stories

00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:43.810
for the writers
to consider doing.

00:19:43.810 --> 00:19:46.810
And they would usually get
online at like 7:00, 7:30.

00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:49.019
We all worked remotely
from our apartments.

00:19:49.019 --> 00:19:50.060
So they would get online.

00:19:50.060 --> 00:19:52.476
I'd see them come on IM, and
then we'd have a little chat,

00:19:52.476 --> 00:19:54.730
and I'd send them stories
that they could consider.

00:19:54.730 --> 00:19:57.240
So the first post was
always a gossip roundup.

00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:00.290
And then the next
post was always

00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:02.250
something like the news
of the day-- it could

00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:04.280
have been like
something hard-newsy.

00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:06.950
The next post after that
was usually about politics,

00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:09.910
and I know politics and hard
news can be the same thing,

00:20:09.910 --> 00:20:11.330
but I tried to
keep them separate,

00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:12.496
at least in those two posts.

00:20:12.496 --> 00:20:15.240
And then the next one
would be about a party that

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:19.270
had happened the night
before, and the writer

00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:21.609
would be evaluating the
outfits at some party,

00:20:21.609 --> 00:20:22.650
that she had not been to.

00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:27.210
But Like some movie premiere
with starlets and stuff.

00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:30.170
And so I tried to balance out
the topics-- something serious,

00:20:30.170 --> 00:20:32.050
something superficial,
something serious.

00:20:32.050 --> 00:20:34.410
But also we would put
pictures in between the posts,

00:20:34.410 --> 00:20:36.580
as kind of breathing
room, like interstitial.

00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:40.050
So I guess the best
way to describe

00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:42.790
it is, I had a grad student
come sit with me for three weeks

00:20:42.790 --> 00:20:46.390
and watch me work for
a paper she was doing,

00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:49.240
and she described it as I was
an air traffic controller.

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:52.430
I feel like that was
a good summation.

00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:54.797
I was trying to not
have planes crash.

00:20:54.797 --> 00:20:57.130
Not that it was really-- I
mean that's kind of hyperbole

00:20:57.130 --> 00:20:59.040
because no one was
going to get hurt.

00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:01.685
But it did feel like there were
a lot of things happening all

00:21:01.685 --> 00:21:03.351
at once, and the
writers were IM'ing me,

00:21:03.351 --> 00:21:06.390
and I'm looking at an RSS
feed, and then Facebook,

00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:09.780
and my emails, and there's the
TV on next to me so I can see

00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:13.300
if something-- if Kathy Lee says
something stupid on the "Today

00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:14.340
Show" so I can clip it.

00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:15.925
And it was crazy.

00:21:15.925 --> 00:21:18.260
It was totally crazy.

00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:21.250
RICHARD GINGRAS: I was tracking
your numbers then, and--

00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:21.505
ANNA HOLMES: You were?

00:21:21.505 --> 00:21:23.755
RICHARD GINGRAS: --you built
an audience very quickly.

00:21:23.755 --> 00:21:27.600
Well, Gawker, I have a
lot of regard Gawker.

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:30.690
I mean there are some folks who
are critical of their sites,

00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:31.360
others are not.

00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:34.600
But frankly, Nick
and the larger team

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:37.100
have come up with properties
that have worked, and have been

00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:38.860
successful, and
actually make money.

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:40.109
ANNA HOLMES: Uh-huh.

00:21:40.109 --> 00:21:42.400
RICHARD GINGRAS: But there's
different kinds of impact.

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:46.020
Do you have a sense of
what the impact of Jezebel

00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:50.120
has been on traditional media,
particularly women's media?

00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:51.084
Can you assess that?

00:21:51.084 --> 00:21:51.750
ANNA HOLMES: No.

00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:55.060
I mean people tell me,
but I can't assess it

00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:56.590
for a couple of reasons.

00:21:56.590 --> 00:21:58.570
It might be
reluctance, because I

00:21:58.570 --> 00:22:02.980
think that if I say
what I really suspect,

00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:05.220
and that's somehow
self-aggrandizing.

00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:07.580
Or it could be the
fact is that I feel,

00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:09.410
even though I don't
run the site, still

00:22:09.410 --> 00:22:10.800
too in the midst of it.

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:15.840
I can look back and say,
yes, something was happening

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:19.220
between 2007 and 2010,
the time that I was there,

00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:20.920
that I saw being reflected.

00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:23.195
Whether it was kind of
copycat sites-- and I

00:22:23.195 --> 00:22:24.850
don't mean that in
an insulting way.

00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:27.360
But women sites that
popped up that were

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:31.390
similar in nature and in tone
that came after us that I felt

00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:34.360
were kind of
imitating our style.

00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:36.780
Or things I was
seeing in the culture,

00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:40.560
in the larger, whether
it was popular culture

00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:42.780
or whether it was the
fact that I was seeing

00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:47.092
more discussion
of gender politics

00:22:47.092 --> 00:22:50.440
and feminism in mainstream
media where I had not really

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:52.140
seen that before.

00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:55.330
And I could suspect that
maybe that was because of what

00:22:55.330 --> 00:22:58.500
my writers were
doing, and that they

00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:00.060
were getting a lot of attention.

00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:03.410
But there was no way
for me to quantify.

00:23:03.410 --> 00:23:04.130
I had no proof.

00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:05.590
It was just kind of a feeling.

00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:10.450
And I think I was reluctant
to make a direct connection

00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:15.760
because it is and was
entirely possible that we just

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:19.790
came around at a certain
time when there was a ground

00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:21.740
swell or a hunger for
that sort of content

00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:23.799
and we rode a wave,
as opposed to we're

00:23:23.799 --> 00:23:25.340
the earthquake that
started the wave.

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:31.735
RICHARD GINGRAS: Like I said,
the local properties, there

00:23:31.735 --> 00:23:33.310
are fans, there are non-fans.

00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:36.447
I mean I've been a daily reader
of Jezebel from the beginning.

00:23:36.447 --> 00:23:37.280
ANNA HOLMES: Really?

00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:40.650
RICHARD GINGRAS: I have been,
absolutely, to this day.

00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:45.440
Even though, it's not
as when you ran it.

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:47.950
I have to say that, right?

00:23:47.950 --> 00:23:48.450
But--

00:23:48.450 --> 00:23:49.491
ANNA HOLMES: It's bigger.

00:23:49.491 --> 00:23:52.150
RICHARD GINGRAS: But I'm a
guy, and I'm not, obviously,

00:23:52.150 --> 00:23:54.460
the target demo.

00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:57.540
The feminist
blogosphere, Jezebel

00:23:57.540 --> 00:24:00.090
can be a bit contentious.

00:24:00.090 --> 00:24:04.040
Is it a feminist
blog, or is it not?

00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:05.840
What are your
thoughts about that,

00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:08.062
in a relationship with
Jezebel to feminism?

00:24:08.062 --> 00:24:10.145
ANNA HOLMES: I never called
it publicly a feminist

00:24:10.145 --> 00:24:13.340
blog because that was,
I felt unfair to what

00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:15.000
I think are actual
feminist blogs.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:21.280
And by that I mean not for
profit, labors of love,

00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:25.080
done by a person or persons that
are very activist in nature,

00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:29.020
and whose content
is solely focused

00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:32.810
on the discussion of
feminism and gender politics.

00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:36.515
I felt that they deserved
that kind of definition,

00:24:36.515 --> 00:24:39.960
and that I wasn't going to
announce that Jezebel was that

00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:42.840
because we weren't.

00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:44.960
I mean there's a certain
tension between talking

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:47.030
about serious subjects,
like gender politics

00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:49.140
and making money, I
don't think that they

00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:50.400
are in total conflict.

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:53.010
But in the end, we
were still a site

00:24:53.010 --> 00:24:55.060
that was commercial in nature.

00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:58.107
It may have been a labor of
love, but I being paid for it,

00:24:58.107 --> 00:24:59.190
and so was everybody else.

00:24:59.190 --> 00:25:01.970
And the expectation
was that we would grow,

00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:04.200
and advertisers would
advertise, and there

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:06.734
was a whole other element there.

00:25:06.734 --> 00:25:09.150
So that's why I didn't want
to use the term feminist blog,

00:25:09.150 --> 00:25:11.580
but I don't have a problem
with the word feminist.

00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:13.430
Quite the contrary.

00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:15.580
Part of my
frustration growing up

00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:20.620
had been that my peers, from a
very young age-- and by peers,

00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:27.200
I mean my female peers-- had
been very reluctant to define

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:29.600
themselves or call
themselves feminists,

00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:34.460
even if they agreed
with its basic goals.

00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:39.550
And I think that that's because
the word had been dirtied up,

00:25:39.550 --> 00:25:42.330
especially during my
childhood, during the '80s

00:25:42.330 --> 00:25:47.200
and in the '90s by
a variety of people.

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:49.410
I think that it came
to mean something

00:25:49.410 --> 00:25:56.440
that was far more radical
and hard to swallow

00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:57.830
than what it really was.

00:25:57.830 --> 00:26:01.300
And I guess I never had a
problem describing myself

00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:05.540
as a feminist because my
mother always described herself

00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:06.270
as a feminist.

00:26:06.270 --> 00:26:08.460
So I had that as a role model.

00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:12.810
And as I got older, and I
realized that not everyone was

00:26:12.810 --> 00:26:15.540
as open to talking
about feminism

00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:18.832
or embracing it as I was,
I became very frustrated.

00:26:18.832 --> 00:26:21.040
And I think that was the
case with women's magazines.

00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:22.540
They just didn't
get that political.

00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:26.120
So with the site, we
weren't a feminist blog,

00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:28.140
but we were going to
talk about all the time.

00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:32.700
And talk about it in an
unapologetic and repetitive

00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:35.180
way.

00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:37.735
I felt that people tiptoed
around the word in the same way

00:26:37.735 --> 00:26:40.502
that they tiptoed around
the word abortion,

00:26:40.502 --> 00:26:42.210
or that they tiptoe
around the word rape,

00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:43.040
because these are
all things that

00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:44.373
might make people uncomfortable.

00:26:44.373 --> 00:26:47.090
And so we would not only
talk about those things,

00:26:47.090 --> 00:26:50.090
but we would use them
regularly in headlines,

00:26:50.090 --> 00:26:53.770
when appropriate
and without apology.

00:26:53.770 --> 00:26:57.870
That we would kind of
model to the readers

00:26:57.870 --> 00:26:59.980
that there was
nothing to be ashamed

00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:02.270
of or there was no reason
to be tiptoeing around a lot

00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:04.400
these more difficult subjects.

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:07.647
So people thought of us
as being a feminist blog,

00:27:07.647 --> 00:27:09.980
but I never would, again,
would have publicly said that.

00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:13.980
I would have said oh, we're
a women's site with where

00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:17.027
we try to take a progressive
look at the culture

00:27:17.027 --> 00:27:17.860
through pop culture.

00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:20.318
And we tried to use pop culture,
and fashion, and celebrity

00:27:20.318 --> 00:27:23.240
as entry points into
more serious discussions.

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:26.020
That was really the
ultimate goal of the site.

00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:32.090
In my like most ambitious, and
perhaps, bone-headed moments,

00:27:32.090 --> 00:27:35.890
I thought, well, we're
going to politicize

00:27:35.890 --> 00:27:37.770
a population of young
women who maybe haven't

00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:38.930
thought about these
things, or been

00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:40.139
privy to these conversations.

00:27:40.139 --> 00:27:41.805
And we're going to
do it because they're

00:27:41.805 --> 00:27:43.300
going to come to
look at pictures

00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:46.470
of Misha Barton walking
down an LA street,

00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:48.359
and they're going to
stay because they're

00:27:48.359 --> 00:27:50.650
going to be interested in
the post that comes after it.

00:27:50.650 --> 00:27:52.899
And they're going to be
interested in not only the way

00:27:52.899 --> 00:27:56.250
the writer constructs the post
and the language that she uses,

00:27:56.250 --> 00:27:59.250
which is often humor,
but the conversations

00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:00.590
and the comments that follow.

00:28:00.590 --> 00:28:02.100
And that was an
interesting thing

00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:05.100
is that I do feel a lot of
the readers got politicized,

00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:07.706
and it wasn't just the work
of myself or the writers,

00:28:07.706 --> 00:28:09.205
it was oftentimes
the other readers.

00:28:09.205 --> 00:28:12.820
Because I do think that people
are reluctant to be lectured.

00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:17.000
And so I don't think we did
any lecturing in the posts.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.800
And I do feel like
the readers were more,

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:20.630
because they had created
such a community,

00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:23.520
that they were much more
likely, in many instances,

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:24.762
to listen to one another.

00:28:24.762 --> 00:28:26.220
So sometimes we
would put up a post

00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:28.070
where we would leave
stuff out on purpose.

00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:29.528
I don't mean like
leave a fact out,

00:28:29.528 --> 00:28:33.730
but just the discussion wouldn't
be as nuanced or as detailed

00:28:33.730 --> 00:28:38.720
as it could have been because
it gave the commenters something

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:43.260
meaty to chew on and
talk about themselves.

00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:45.280
And that was really exciting.

00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:47.970
But I do think that
we did politicize

00:28:47.970 --> 00:28:48.900
a lot of young women.

00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:50.200
I don't know what a lot is.

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:51.500
I mean I can't get numbers.

00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:53.940
But and I was hoping
we would do that.

00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:56.050
And I thought that
by using, again,

00:28:56.050 --> 00:28:59.660
these kind of more
accessible topics,

00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:03.530
like pop culture or
celebrity culture,

00:29:03.530 --> 00:29:05.922
that we could do just that.

00:29:05.922 --> 00:29:07.546
RICHARD GINGRAS: I'm
interested to hear

00:29:07.546 --> 00:29:09.770
you talk about the tone.

00:29:09.770 --> 00:29:13.100
I'm always fascinated with the
art and science of crafting

00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:17.100
the right tone for a site,
and you managed to do that.

00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:19.200
But I want to move
on to the book,

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:21.490
because I want to make sure
we talk about in the book,

00:29:21.490 --> 00:29:24.520
and also make sure we have
time for questions from folks.

00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:27.780
Also, a plug for the book,
it's available outside the door

00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:31.430
for the heavily Google-y
subsidized price of $10.

00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:32.180
ANNA HOLMES: Yeah.

00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:33.200
RICHARD GINGRAS: It's
a beautiful book.

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:34.730
ANNA HOLMES: They really
subsidized it. [LAUGH]

00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:35.590
RICHARD GINGRAS: Superb paper.

00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:36.360
Really nice.

00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:36.880
ANNA HOLMES: I'm very grateful.

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:38.350
RICHARD GINGRAS: Buy a bunch.

00:29:38.350 --> 00:29:40.262
Give them as gifts to friends.

00:29:40.262 --> 00:29:40.970
ANNA HOLMES: Yes.

00:29:40.970 --> 00:29:41.980
RICHARD GINGRAS: So
I've got to tell you.

00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:43.470
I got the book last week.

00:29:43.470 --> 00:29:49.490
I opened it up for the first
time to a page in the letter P.

00:29:49.490 --> 00:29:52.090
And the first entry that
hit me was patriarchy.

00:29:52.090 --> 00:29:54.381
ANNA HOLMES: Ah, I thought
you were going to say penis.

00:29:54.381 --> 00:29:56.792
RICHARD GINGRAS: --whose
definition was "smash it."

00:29:56.792 --> 00:29:58.250
So my only question
there, I didn't

00:29:58.250 --> 00:30:00.030
realize that Amazon
had the technology

00:30:00.030 --> 00:30:02.590
to detect my gender
on a book and cause

00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:04.250
me to open to a specific page.

00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:05.416
ANNA HOLMES: Uh-huh, uh-huh.

00:30:05.416 --> 00:30:06.682
Yeah, I'm impressed too.

00:30:06.682 --> 00:30:07.890
RICHARD GINGRAS: Very clever.

00:30:07.890 --> 00:30:09.070
ANNA HOLMES: You should
join forces with them.

00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:10.611
RICHARD GINGRAS:
You pulled that off.

00:30:10.611 --> 00:30:11.550
ANNA HOLMES: [LAUGH]

00:30:11.550 --> 00:30:13.175
RICHARD GINGRAS: But
it's encyclopedia.

00:30:13.175 --> 00:30:18.340
And I think it's an interesting
format that you chose.

00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:21.060
I think there's a
fine history of that,

00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:25.250
from whether it's John
Stuart's wonderful textbook,

00:30:25.250 --> 00:30:26.900
"A Citizen's Guide
to Democracy,"

00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:29.620
or you could, frankly,
go back to Ambrose Bierce

00:30:29.620 --> 00:30:34.800
and "The Devil's Dictionary,"
which is one of my favorite.

00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:36.640
By the way, its
definition for apology

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:39.860
was to lay the foundation
for a future offense.

00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:41.919
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:41.919 --> 00:30:42.960
ANNA HOLMES: I like that.

00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:48.430
RICHARD GINGRAS: So what caused
you to choose the format?

00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:51.680
ANNA HOLMES: Well, that wasn't
the first book idea that I had.

00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:55.460
The first idea I had, and
I'm so glad it didn't happen.

00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:58.000
But at the time,
this is in 2010,

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.540
I was still obsessed
with Sarah Palin.

00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:03.449
She really got under my
skin, and had since 2008.

00:31:03.449 --> 00:31:05.240
I mean if you go back
and look at the posts

00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:08.860
on the site in 2008, there was
at least one or two posts a day

00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:11.030
just going after her,
after she got nominated.

00:31:11.030 --> 00:31:13.420
I was like I just couldn't deal.

00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:15.460
And so it got channeled
into my writers.

00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:17.970
So I was like let's do a
book from Sarah Palin's point

00:31:17.970 --> 00:31:19.560
of view that's like
making fun of her.

00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:20.900
And I wanted to do a yearbook.

00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:24.140
It would yearbook format,
and it would be Sarah Palin's

00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:26.960
yearbook, and the high
school would be DC.

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:30.550
So the principal was Obama,
and the vice president or vice

00:31:30.550 --> 00:31:32.815
principal was Biden, and
she was one of the juniors.

00:31:32.815 --> 00:31:35.329
And it would be
a yearbook format

00:31:35.329 --> 00:31:37.120
that she would have
written in, her friends

00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:38.620
would have written
in, but ultimately, it

00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:40.036
would have been
making fun of her.

00:31:40.036 --> 00:31:42.570
Now, I still think that
could maybe have worked,

00:31:42.570 --> 00:31:44.650
but we were not comedy writers.

00:31:44.650 --> 00:31:48.552
We could be funny, but you need
"Mad" magazine to pull that

00:31:48.552 --> 00:31:50.760
off, because every single
thing in the book like that

00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:52.830
has to be funny.

00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:57.100
And we just couldn't execute
that, so that got shelved.

00:31:57.100 --> 00:31:59.267
Also good, because if that
had actually gone forward

00:31:59.267 --> 00:32:00.724
and that had come
out now, everyone

00:32:00.724 --> 00:32:02.360
would have been
like Sarah Palin?

00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:03.100
Who cares.

00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:07.380
She's just became much
more irrelevant, thank God.

00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:08.930
So then I thought,
OK, how can we

00:32:08.930 --> 00:32:11.710
sum up the sensibility
of the site into a book?

00:32:11.710 --> 00:32:13.140
And I like reference books.

00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:17.800
I like sitting around reading
atlas's, and dictionaries,

00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:18.634
and encyclopedias.

00:32:18.634 --> 00:32:20.050
And I also have
very fond memories

00:32:20.050 --> 00:32:23.980
of sitting in my bed,
as a kid, reading

00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:26.230
I think it was a set of
Golden Book encyclopedias.

00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:28.770
I think it was
children's encyclopedias,

00:32:28.770 --> 00:32:33.400
with lots of pictures
about space or [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:34.250
or what have you.

00:32:34.250 --> 00:32:36.690
So I thought why don't we do
an encyclopedia of the world

00:32:36.690 --> 00:32:38.950
according to the
sensibility of the site.

00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:43.260
And that seemed to be OK with
everyone else who was involved

00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:47.635
in the concept,
and the execution,

00:32:47.635 --> 00:32:50.290
and the selling of the book.

00:32:50.290 --> 00:32:52.440
I also kind of
wanted to preserve,

00:32:52.440 --> 00:33:02.440
in printed form, the site,
at least when I had run it.

00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:05.570
Like have something
tangible that would last,

00:33:05.570 --> 00:33:07.810
because blogs are so ephemeral.

00:33:07.810 --> 00:33:11.630
And I would meet people
who had read the site,

00:33:11.630 --> 00:33:13.285
or I would talk
to former staffers

00:33:13.285 --> 00:33:15.120
and we would reminisce
about the post

00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:17.072
that Moe did about--
I'm actually not going

00:33:17.072 --> 00:33:19.030
to say what it was because
it was really gross.

00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:24.110
But we would have very fun
discussions about posts

00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:26.934
that had been put up on the
site that had made a splash

00:33:26.934 --> 00:33:27.850
or that we just loved.

00:33:27.850 --> 00:33:36.260
And I wanted to, again, have
a permanent piece of the site.

00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:38.110
And I don't think
the book is only

00:33:38.110 --> 00:33:40.320
reflective of 2007 to 2010.

00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:42.420
There's a lot of stuff
from the current iteration

00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:43.960
of the site in there.

00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:47.334
But that's what I
know best is that era.

00:33:47.334 --> 00:33:49.500
And I think the things that
are missing in the book,

00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:52.190
and there are many of
them that I forgot about

00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:55.070
or I realized too late, are
totally indicative of where

00:33:55.070 --> 00:33:57.130
my head is at at
any given moment,

00:33:57.130 --> 00:34:02.180
or the pop culture products
that are on my radar.

00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:03.600
And so when someone
the other day

00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:06.880
asked me, why don't you
have Lauryn Hill in there?

00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:08.380
And I was like,
yeah, right, I don't

00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:09.340
have Lauryn Hill in there.

00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:10.370
But maybe that's because
Lauryn Hill was--

00:34:10.370 --> 00:34:11.139
RICHARD GINGRAS: She
just got out of jail.

00:34:11.139 --> 00:34:12.130
ANNA HOLMES: Well, I
know she'd been in jail,

00:34:12.130 --> 00:34:14.730
where she was off-- She
wasn't in my consciousness.

00:34:14.730 --> 00:34:19.087
And I really did try to
remember, think of everything,

00:34:19.087 --> 00:34:20.420
but that was kind of impossible.

00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:22.004
So maybe there'll
be a second edition.

00:34:22.004 --> 00:34:23.753
RICHARD GINGRAS: I
mean a lot of the stuff

00:34:23.753 --> 00:34:25.179
was written just for the book.

00:34:25.179 --> 00:34:26.457
ANNA HOLMES: It was all
written just for the book.

00:34:26.457 --> 00:34:26.595
Yeah.

00:34:26.595 --> 00:34:26.870
RICHARD GINGRAS: Right, OK.

00:34:26.870 --> 00:34:29.010
And you had a very
impressive stable

00:34:29.010 --> 00:34:30.860
of contributors, a
lot of great writers.

00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:32.840
ANNA HOLMES: A lot of them
had been staffers on the site,

00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:34.381
or were current
staffers of the site,

00:34:34.381 --> 00:34:38.230
or had been contributors
in some way,

00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:43.889
or had just been in
that genre of lady blogs

00:34:43.889 --> 00:34:47.179
and I liked their work.

00:34:47.179 --> 00:34:50.500
But it really was I
did not write the book.

00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:53.885
I wrote like maybe 20 entries,
and there's 1,000 in there.

00:34:53.885 --> 00:34:55.260
I oversaw the
whole thing, but it

00:34:55.260 --> 00:34:59.410
was the writers who-- they
were given assignments

00:34:59.410 --> 00:35:01.810
and they executed
them very well.

00:35:01.810 --> 00:35:04.075
And I think you
can tell that there

00:35:04.075 --> 00:35:06.230
are different voices in there.

00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:09.710
But it also depends on the
post, because a post about Sarah

00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:14.079
Palin is going to be somewhat
jokey and mean-spirited, as

00:35:14.079 --> 00:35:16.620
opposed to a post about Planned
Parenthood, which is actually

00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:19.360
quite straightforward about the
history of how it came to be.

00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:21.110
RICHARD GINGRAS: One
of my reactions to it

00:35:21.110 --> 00:35:25.640
was I would start an entry sort
of expecting kind of a jokey

00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:28.770
and snarky, and instead
I'll get something serious.

00:35:28.770 --> 00:35:30.960
And you kind of
whip-lashed me every time--

00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:31.220
ANNA HOLMES: Sorry.

00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:32.150
RICHARD GINGRAS:
[INERPOSING VOICES],

00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:33.030
which was cool.

00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:35.100
But the format, I
think, one thing I love,

00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:37.330
I think the format makes
it much more accessible.

00:35:37.330 --> 00:35:41.030
It's not a tone that you
feel somehow a responsibility

00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:43.210
to read, and just for
a reluctance to start.

00:35:43.210 --> 00:35:44.792
You can just play with it.

00:35:44.792 --> 00:35:44.840
ANNA HOLMES: You
can flip around.

00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:47.280
And there's also pictures,
which I think makes it fun.

00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:47.910
RICHARD GINGRAS: Yeah.

00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:48.500
ANNA HOLMES: And
that's what I wanted.

00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:49.949
I wanted to have
a lot of visuals

00:35:49.949 --> 00:35:51.740
to it, just because I
really like pictures.

00:35:51.740 --> 00:35:53.380
RICHARD GINGRAS: Buy the
physical book in this case.

00:35:53.380 --> 00:35:53.990
ANNA HOLMES: It's
better than eBook.

00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:54.990
RICHARD GINGRAS: Much
more fun than the eBook.

00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:55.890
ANNA HOLMES: It is.

00:35:55.890 --> 00:35:57.990
RICHARD GINGRAS:
Let's go to questions.

00:35:57.990 --> 00:36:00.510
AUDIENCE: I want to ask
you just about the tone

00:36:00.510 --> 00:36:03.040
of the website itself.

00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:05.830
Did you intentionally
set out to be snarky,

00:36:05.830 --> 00:36:08.160
because that's the Gawker voice.

00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:13.780
And did you mean to be
mean to everybody or just

00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:15.050
some select few?

00:36:15.050 --> 00:36:17.258
ANNA HOLMES: I don't think
we were mean to everybody.

00:36:17.258 --> 00:36:21.430
I think we were just mean to
women's magazines, fashion

00:36:21.430 --> 00:36:25.090
designers who are
assholes, Republicans.

00:36:25.090 --> 00:36:25.861
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:25.861 --> 00:36:27.277
AUDIENCE: And that
would be people

00:36:27.277 --> 00:36:29.150
that maybe you
personally didn't like,

00:36:29.150 --> 00:36:30.927
or just all Republicans, all--

00:36:30.927 --> 00:36:33.260
ANNA HOLMES: At that point,
pretty much all Republicans,

00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:35.570
because they were bananas
then, and they kind of still

00:36:35.570 --> 00:36:37.254
are, at least the Party.

00:36:37.254 --> 00:36:39.420
I'm not saying civilian
Republicans are all bananas.

00:36:42.070 --> 00:36:45.940
We could have been
more fair about things,

00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:49.090
but we all had a
similar point of view.

00:36:49.090 --> 00:36:53.120
And a lot of what was underlying
the tone on those posts

00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:55.849
was anger.

00:36:55.849 --> 00:36:57.765
And I think it was often
channeled into humor,

00:36:57.765 --> 00:37:00.360
because I do think that
a lot of great humor

00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:05.440
comes from an angry place,
or a sense of frustration

00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:10.700
with the world and how
society is structured.

00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:14.410
But when a post had to be
angry, it was just angry.

00:37:14.410 --> 00:37:17.285
And when it maybe
needed some humor

00:37:17.285 --> 00:37:19.410
because there was really
nothing else you could do.

00:37:19.410 --> 00:37:20.790
Like, for example,
there's no way

00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:24.270
to really get angry about
Congresswoman Michele Bachmann,

00:37:24.270 --> 00:37:25.530
because she's ridiculous.

00:37:25.530 --> 00:37:27.290
So you just made
fun of her. [LAUGH]

00:37:27.290 --> 00:37:34.220
Whereas, I think it's much more
legitimate to get angry at,

00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:38.540
for our purposes, the assault
on reproductive rights going on

00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:41.346
throughout various legislatures
around the country.

00:37:41.346 --> 00:37:43.095
Yes, you can make jokes
about stupid stuff

00:37:43.095 --> 00:37:44.770
that politicians say.

00:37:44.770 --> 00:37:49.720
But the underlying reality of
what was going, is going on,

00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:51.680
was not something that
was easy to joke about.

00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:54.590
But it's funny, because Gawker
was known for being snarky.

00:37:54.590 --> 00:37:56.980
So that was a lot of it.

00:37:56.980 --> 00:38:00.840
And also, it just happened,
like the first person I hired,

00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:07.200
Moe Tkacik, is very pointed,
and biting, and very,

00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:12.290
very brilliant, and can be
extremely mean, and very funny.

00:38:12.290 --> 00:38:14.750
And because she
was the first hire,

00:38:14.750 --> 00:38:17.820
I feel like she also
set a certain tone.

00:38:17.820 --> 00:38:20.120
Because I wouldn't describe
myself as a funny writer.

00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:23.130
I can appreciate good humor, and
maybe I can be funny sometimes,

00:38:23.130 --> 00:38:27.300
but there's no way-- that
the humor on the site

00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:29.300
was not being channeled for me.

00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:33.930
It really was thanks to
the specific writers.

00:38:33.930 --> 00:38:37.482
And, again, Gawker's
overall kind of snark.

00:38:37.482 --> 00:38:39.690
AUDIENCE: But it sounds like
you did have some issues

00:38:39.690 --> 00:38:42.015
that you take seriously and
that you kind of campaigned

00:38:42.015 --> 00:38:43.960
on inverted commas.

00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:44.870
ANNA HOLMES: Yeah.

00:38:44.870 --> 00:38:47.250
Every single day.

00:38:47.250 --> 00:38:48.140
Yeah.

00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:49.989
There was a different
tone to every post,

00:38:49.989 --> 00:38:51.530
but it also depended
on who wrote it.

00:38:51.530 --> 00:38:53.210
And I think one of the great
things that Gawker did,

00:38:53.210 --> 00:38:55.770
and this was maybe a month after
the site launched, was they

00:38:55.770 --> 00:38:58.142
put bylines on posts,
across all their blogs.

00:38:58.142 --> 00:38:59.725
Before then there
had been no bylines,

00:38:59.725 --> 00:39:01.308
so you never knew
which of the writers

00:39:01.308 --> 00:39:03.100
was writing what on
any of the sites.

00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:06.440
And then you would see
things, like on gawker.com

00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:09.900
specifically, a use
of the royal "we."

00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:13.800
I feel like maybe the tone
was more, not coherent,

00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:16.550
but cohesive, because
there was no way

00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:19.476
to distinguish which of the
Gawker editors or writers

00:39:19.476 --> 00:39:20.850
was writing any
particular thing.

00:39:20.850 --> 00:39:24.900
And once we got by bylines,
then I just let the writers go.

00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:26.800
Because also, they were
working really hard.

00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:30.842
They worked 10 hours
a day, nonstop.

00:39:30.842 --> 00:39:32.550
They would have to
read multiple articles

00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:36.055
and process them in their
head, and then somehow spit

00:39:36.055 --> 00:39:39.380
them back out in a
well-written funny way.

00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:41.790
And do all that within
the course of 45 minutes,

00:39:41.790 --> 00:39:43.372
and then I'd edit
it and put it up,

00:39:43.372 --> 00:39:45.330
and then they'd do it
again, like over and over

00:39:45.330 --> 00:39:46.329
and over and over again.

00:39:46.329 --> 00:39:47.880
So there was no way
that I was going

00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:51.797
to be able to edit
them into a royal "we."

00:39:51.797 --> 00:39:53.380
But also, they would
have resented it,

00:39:53.380 --> 00:39:56.604
because I was asking
so much of them that I

00:39:56.604 --> 00:39:58.270
had to let them write
in their own voice

00:39:58.270 --> 00:40:00.320
and write the things
they wanted to write.

00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:02.390
Otherwise, I would have
had a miserable staff.

00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:06.576
And I was, again, asking
so much of them already.

00:40:06.576 --> 00:40:07.998
RICHARD GINGRAS: Who's next?

00:40:07.998 --> 00:40:08.950
Yes.

00:40:08.950 --> 00:40:11.550
AUDIENCE: So with your writers
working 10 hours a day,

00:40:11.550 --> 00:40:14.730
it sounds like there was
a huge push for quantity.

00:40:14.730 --> 00:40:18.120
So were you trying to, i
producing so many articles,

00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:20.520
just have broader
appeal to your readers,

00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:23.694
or just by the nature of a
website looking for traffic?

00:40:23.694 --> 00:40:25.110
And if so, did
that ever worry you

00:40:25.110 --> 00:40:28.690
about the erosion of the
quality of the articles?

00:40:28.690 --> 00:40:31.020
ANNA HOLMES: No
one ever pushed me

00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:33.830
to have-- I think if I
had gone to Nick Denton

00:40:33.830 --> 00:40:36.730
and say, how many posts are
we supposed to put up a day?

00:40:36.730 --> 00:40:39.130
He would've just
said, eh, 20 or so.

00:40:39.130 --> 00:40:40.357
I mean I was putting up 70.

00:40:40.357 --> 00:40:41.940
And that was not
because he told me to

00:40:41.940 --> 00:40:43.023
or anyone else told me to.

00:40:43.023 --> 00:40:46.090
It was because we wanted
to cover a lot of ground.

00:40:46.090 --> 00:40:50.380
We felt extremely
energized and excited.

00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:53.740
And then the more successful the
site got, the more crazy I got.

00:40:53.740 --> 00:40:57.610
Which I don't mean that
in a negative way so much.

00:40:57.610 --> 00:41:00.910
But if we were getting
a certain result

00:41:00.910 --> 00:41:03.190
and I was working
at 200% capacity,

00:41:03.190 --> 00:41:05.200
then I figured if I
worked at 300% capacity

00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:06.450
I'd get a different result.

00:41:06.450 --> 00:41:10.250
And there was this
energy that made us,

00:41:10.250 --> 00:41:12.390
or me-- I should just
say me-- made me,

00:41:12.390 --> 00:41:15.560
and then, therefore, make the
staffers work even harder.

00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:18.480
But we were getting stuff
back from the readers.

00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:20.450
It wasn't like we were
putting stuff out there

00:41:20.450 --> 00:41:22.180
and it was just
dying on the vine.

00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:26.460
I mean it felt like there
was this incredible momentum.

00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:29.260
And there was so
much to talk about,

00:41:29.260 --> 00:41:31.300
that it felt very
heady and awesome.

00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:34.120
But yeah, there were
certainly pressures

00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:36.800
to hit certain traffic
goals, but I didn't really

00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:39.190
worry about them that much
because we always hit them,

00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:39.940
for the most part.

00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:42.954
I mean the site
was just growing.

00:41:42.954 --> 00:41:44.370
There was some
months, maybe, when

00:41:44.370 --> 00:41:45.770
it would grow a little less.

00:41:45.770 --> 00:41:48.277
But I never had, from
what I remember--

00:41:48.277 --> 00:41:50.360
I mean I could go back and
look at traffic stats--

00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:52.151
but I don't remember
there ever being a dip

00:41:52.151 --> 00:41:55.705
or where I was taken
aside and someone said,

00:41:55.705 --> 00:41:57.830
you need to fix something
because the traffic's not

00:41:57.830 --> 00:41:58.330
going up.

00:41:58.330 --> 00:42:02.960
I mean at one point, when Gawker
Media was using page views

00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:07.030
as the metric by which people
were judged, before they switch

00:42:07.030 --> 00:42:08.800
to unique visitors.

00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:10.270
I think it was in 2008.

00:42:10.270 --> 00:42:12.530
And it became clear
that we were going

00:42:12.530 --> 00:42:16.420
to out-do gawker.com
in page views.

00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:18.910
And gawker.com had been
around-- when did it start?

00:42:18.910 --> 00:42:19.700
2004?

00:42:19.700 --> 00:42:21.430
RICHARD GINGRAS: Um-hmm.

00:42:21.430 --> 00:42:22.280
ANNA HOLMES: 2002?

00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:22.779
OK.

00:42:22.779 --> 00:42:26.910
So Gawker had been
around for six years

00:42:26.910 --> 00:42:28.644
and was a big well-known
media property,

00:42:28.644 --> 00:42:30.560
and we were going to
out-do them in page views

00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:31.809
within two year of our launch.

00:42:31.809 --> 00:42:34.470
RICHARD GINGRAS: In
fact, in January 2010,

00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:38.900
you did about four million
page views to Gawker's 2.7.

00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:39.790
ANNA HOLMES: Yeah.

00:42:39.790 --> 00:42:41.880
[LAUGH]

00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:43.380
RICHARD GINGRAS:
And your edit staff

00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:44.440
generated about four million--

00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:45.210
ANNA HOLMES: Are you
sure that's page views,

00:42:45.210 --> 00:42:47.236
because I feel like
we had least 30.

00:42:47.236 --> 00:42:48.360
That may have been uniques.

00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:49.020
Really?

00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:49.380
Because I feel like--

00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:49.510
RICHARD GINGRAS: No.

00:42:49.510 --> 00:42:50.301
This is page views.

00:42:50.301 --> 00:42:52.580
Uniques were three
million for Gawker and--

00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:53.300
ANNA HOLMES: Because
we were usually--

00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:53.440
RICHARD GINGRAS: --two for you.

00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:55.760
ANNA HOLMES: --in the 20s, in
like a 20 million, 30 million

00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:56.010
page views.

00:42:56.010 --> 00:42:56.750
RICHARD GINGRAS:
Maybe this is wrong.

00:42:56.750 --> 00:42:58.080
ANNA HOLMES: Well, regardless--

00:42:58.080 --> 00:42:59.370
RICHARD GINGRAS: Oh,
I'm sorry, 44 million.

00:42:59.370 --> 00:43:00.334
ANNA HOLMES: Yeah, OK.

00:43:00.334 --> 00:43:01.750
RICHARD GINGRAS:
I missed a digit.

00:43:01.750 --> 00:43:04.830
ANNA HOLMES: [LAUGH] And I was
very competitive with Gawker,

00:43:04.830 --> 00:43:07.002
even though they
were a different site

00:43:07.002 --> 00:43:07.710
in some respects.

00:43:07.710 --> 00:43:10.287
RICHARD GINGRAS: They were
35 million, and you were 44.

00:43:10.287 --> 00:43:11.370
ANNA HOLMES: That's right.

00:43:11.370 --> 00:43:14.620
RICHARD GINGRAS: Actually,
the 2.76 was-- See,

00:43:14.620 --> 00:43:16.221
I did this analysis.

00:43:16.221 --> 00:43:17.846
ANNA HOLMES: I wasn't
disbelieving you.

00:43:17.846 --> 00:43:18.280
I just felt like--

00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:19.800
RICHARD GINGRAS: The
average Jezebel contributor

00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:21.780
did four and a half
million page views.

00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:23.040
ANNA HOLMES: Ah, OK.

00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:26.580
RICHARD GINGRAS: They received
2.75 [INAUDIBLE] there, see?

00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:28.086
ANNA HOLMES: So
that's very exciting

00:43:28.086 --> 00:43:29.460
when you get that
sort of traffic

00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:31.510
and you just want to keep
doing what you're doing

00:43:31.510 --> 00:43:32.720
or do it better.

00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:39.330
But it made me burnout and a
number of other people burnout.

00:43:39.330 --> 00:43:41.410
RICHARD GINGRAS: Not surprising.

00:43:41.410 --> 00:43:42.186
Next?

00:43:42.186 --> 00:43:44.310
AUDIENCE: You kind of talked
about at the beginning

00:43:44.310 --> 00:43:46.430
how when you were
going to Jezebel,

00:43:46.430 --> 00:43:49.340
there was a demographic of
women that hadn't been touched.

00:43:49.340 --> 00:43:52.850
You wanted to go away from the
material stick, fluffy women

00:43:52.850 --> 00:43:55.880
stuff, and talk about
maybe more substantive,

00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:58.210
whether it's sassy,
irreverent, whatever.

00:43:58.210 --> 00:44:00.810
Once you launched
Jezebel, what did you

00:44:00.810 --> 00:44:03.540
learn from a lot of the
viewers or the readers?

00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:05.090
Did you get a lot of feedback?

00:44:05.090 --> 00:44:06.441
Did a lot of people write in?

00:44:06.441 --> 00:44:07.940
Did they like a lot
of that content?

00:44:07.940 --> 00:44:11.510
Like this demographic was new
to you, so once you entered it,

00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:13.130
what did you learn
from that group?

00:44:13.130 --> 00:44:14.980
ANNA HOLMES: When you say did
they like that sort of content,

00:44:14.980 --> 00:44:17.040
do you mean the more serious
content, or did they like--

00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:17.665
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:44:17.665 --> 00:44:19.265
So just the edge of
Jezebel, probably.

00:44:19.265 --> 00:44:20.725
That you were
taking bold stands.

00:44:20.725 --> 00:44:23.100
That you were maybe talking
about maybe some more serious

00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:24.580
things.

00:44:24.580 --> 00:44:26.400
ANNA HOLMES: They
didn't write in so much,

00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:28.970
but they didn't need to because
they would just comment.

00:44:28.970 --> 00:44:33.650
And they were there under every
post within two minutes of it

00:44:33.650 --> 00:44:34.289
going up.

00:44:34.289 --> 00:44:36.080
And then it would just
snowball from there.

00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:37.704
Either they were
talking to us, or they

00:44:37.704 --> 00:44:38.860
were talking to each other.

00:44:38.860 --> 00:44:41.020
And when I say
talking, that means

00:44:41.020 --> 00:44:45.290
having a nice
conversation, or maybe

00:44:45.290 --> 00:44:49.695
they were giving us the virtual
finger or what have you.

00:44:49.695 --> 00:44:50.800
It ran the gamut.

00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:56.270
But what I learned, and, again,
these are the commenters,

00:44:56.270 --> 00:44:59.100
I think, modeling for
the other readers.

00:44:59.100 --> 00:45:01.240
Because a lot of people
read the site and read

00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:03.140
the comments but didn't comment.

00:45:03.140 --> 00:45:05.550
But the commenters
were notorious

00:45:05.550 --> 00:45:09.570
for being any number of things--
argumentative, pain in the ass,

00:45:09.570 --> 00:45:11.050
totally intelligent
and hilarious.

00:45:11.050 --> 00:45:13.245
I mean they were great
and they were horrible.

00:45:13.245 --> 00:45:15.620
And when I say horrible, just
because I would get annoyed

00:45:15.620 --> 00:45:16.120
with them.

00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:18.520
They actually weren't
that horrible.

00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:22.500
They were modeling in the
comments what I suspected,

00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:25.950
which was that when
that 10:30 post went up

00:45:25.950 --> 00:45:31.700
about the red carpet for the
premiere of "Meet the Fockers,"

00:45:31.700 --> 00:45:34.970
that a well-known commenter
would be saying something funny

00:45:34.970 --> 00:45:38.305
about Ben Stiller's tux.

00:45:38.305 --> 00:45:39.680
And then literally
a half an hour

00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:44.829
later there's a post about
rape in the military.

00:45:44.829 --> 00:45:46.870
And she's saying something
incredibly intelligent

00:45:46.870 --> 00:45:47.470
about that.

00:45:47.470 --> 00:45:50.630
So you saw, within the space
of 15 minutes, 30 minutes,

00:45:50.630 --> 00:45:54.470
that they were able to pivot
very deftly and intelligently

00:45:54.470 --> 00:45:59.087
between hard and soft,
superficial and serious.

00:45:59.087 --> 00:46:00.670
Which is further
underscoring the fact

00:46:00.670 --> 00:46:02.586
that women are very
diverse and have opinions.

00:46:02.586 --> 00:46:04.430
They can walk and chew
gum at the same time.

00:46:04.430 --> 00:46:06.617
So and sometimes
this would be modeled

00:46:06.617 --> 00:46:07.700
by the writers themselves.

00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:09.310
They did have certain beats.

00:46:09.310 --> 00:46:12.840
So it was very unlikely that
the political writer or writers

00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:15.840
were going to write
about reality TV.

00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:19.340
They may have watched
it, but the kind

00:46:19.340 --> 00:46:24.930
of diversity of interest and
versatility was, I think,

00:46:24.930 --> 00:46:28.640
modeled the most
in the comments.

00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:32.060
And that just, again, I guess
underscored my suspicion

00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:35.020
that, again, women can walk
and chew gum at the same time.

00:46:35.020 --> 00:46:36.810
But I didn't get
that many emails

00:46:36.810 --> 00:46:42.527
unless it was someone angry
that I banned them. [LAUGH]

00:46:42.527 --> 00:46:44.610
RICHARD GINGRAS: We're
almost running out of time.

00:46:44.610 --> 00:46:47.810
So I want to come back to--
Do you have a question, Anna?

00:46:47.810 --> 00:46:50.150
AUDIENCE: My first
question is you expressed

00:46:50.150 --> 00:46:53.640
some embarrassment, I think,
about the name of the site

00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:56.670
initially, and I was wondering
if you could talk about why.

00:46:56.670 --> 00:46:58.545
And my second question--
should I ask it now?

00:46:58.545 --> 00:46:59.461
RICHARD GINGRAS: Yeah.

00:46:59.461 --> 00:47:00.110
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:47:00.110 --> 00:47:04.100
Is thinking about what you
were saying about feminism

00:47:04.100 --> 00:47:06.830
and the
version/rejection/repulsion

00:47:06.830 --> 00:47:09.970
to the term, the
last time that we

00:47:09.970 --> 00:47:13.690
had a presidential election--
well, no, before that-- when

00:47:13.690 --> 00:47:17.590
Hillary ran, I remember having
conversations with women

00:47:17.590 --> 00:47:19.850
in their late 20s, which
was my age at the time,

00:47:19.850 --> 00:47:21.930
and they would say
things like, I just

00:47:21.930 --> 00:47:25.660
don't think a woman
can do the job, which

00:47:25.660 --> 00:47:28.030
was really, really horrifying.

00:47:28.030 --> 00:47:30.960
And I was wondering
what you think about

00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:36.856
whether we're ready for
some real female leadership?

00:47:36.856 --> 00:47:37.950
Oh, and thanks for coming.

00:47:37.950 --> 00:47:39.880
ANNA HOLMES: Oh, thanks.

00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:43.280
So the first question, why I
was uncomfortable with the name.

00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:46.590
Well, a lot of the Gawker
Media sites had made up names.

00:47:46.590 --> 00:47:48.470
I mean Gawker I guess
was the real word,

00:47:48.470 --> 00:47:53.010
but Jalopnik is a made up word,
and Gizmodo is a made up word,

00:47:53.010 --> 00:47:55.120
or they're combinations
of words put together.

00:47:55.120 --> 00:47:58.289
And we were trying to come
up with that sort of name

00:47:58.289 --> 00:47:58.830
for the site.

00:47:58.830 --> 00:48:00.750
And I still have
notes somewhere where

00:48:00.750 --> 00:48:02.790
we were coming up with ideas.

00:48:02.790 --> 00:48:04.180
But none of them worked.

00:48:04.180 --> 00:48:06.350
And then I think
the reason I didn't

00:48:06.350 --> 00:48:09.260
like Jezebel was because
it felt obvious to me,

00:48:09.260 --> 00:48:11.150
and also because
it was a real word.

00:48:11.150 --> 00:48:13.350
It wasn't something
made up, so it

00:48:13.350 --> 00:48:15.310
had a lot of baggage
attached to it.

00:48:15.310 --> 00:48:17.950
And I guess I thought the
idea of reclaiming a word that

00:48:17.950 --> 00:48:19.855
meant something bad
was too obvious.

00:48:23.570 --> 00:48:25.330
It's hard for me to,
even now, articulate,

00:48:25.330 --> 00:48:27.550
why I had a problem
with it beyond that.

00:48:27.550 --> 00:48:30.850
And then I actually remember
after the site launched,

00:48:30.850 --> 00:48:33.080
someone sent us an
email, speak emails,

00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:35.530
about the name Jezebel, which
I was well aware of in terms

00:48:35.530 --> 00:48:39.240
of the Bible or the
Bette Davis movie.

00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:41.430
But I had not been
aware that it was also

00:48:41.430 --> 00:48:46.150
a word used to describe
a sexually promiscuous,

00:48:46.150 --> 00:48:50.280
highly emotionally
damaged mixed race woman.

00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:53.370
And it was used this way in
the Southern part of the United

00:48:53.370 --> 00:48:54.660
States.

00:48:54.660 --> 00:48:56.440
So it was very racially coded.

00:48:56.440 --> 00:48:58.002
Had no idea.

00:48:58.002 --> 00:48:59.710
Someone sent me a
Ph.D. paper about this,

00:48:59.710 --> 00:49:01.750
and I remember thinking,
this is really bad.

00:49:01.750 --> 00:49:06.801
Because I'm mixed race, and
the site is not about me.

00:49:06.801 --> 00:49:08.300
And there was a
little avatar, which

00:49:08.300 --> 00:49:10.091
was on the cover, which
was a blonde woman.

00:49:10.091 --> 00:49:13.190
But that made me feel
very uncomfortable,

00:49:13.190 --> 00:49:17.600
because-- I believe the
term is tragic mulatto.

00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:18.810
That was what a Jezebel was.

00:49:18.810 --> 00:49:21.130
Like a woman who was
a tragic mulatto who

00:49:21.130 --> 00:49:23.620
was promiscuous or a slut.

00:49:23.620 --> 00:49:27.207
And I really didn't like all
the implications of that.

00:49:27.207 --> 00:49:29.040
And I think once I
decided I didn't like it,

00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:29.910
I just didn't like it.

00:49:29.910 --> 00:49:31.160
I was being stubborn about it.

00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:32.620
But yeah, I wouldn't
use the word.

00:49:32.620 --> 00:49:34.495
I'd say, and I'd meet
someone and then they'd

00:49:34.495 --> 00:49:36.110
say, where do you work?

00:49:36.110 --> 00:49:37.590
I'd say I work for a blog.

00:49:37.590 --> 00:49:39.510
Oh, what blog?

00:49:39.510 --> 00:49:40.895
Well, it's done by Gawker Media.

00:49:40.895 --> 00:49:41.770
Oh, what is it about?

00:49:41.770 --> 00:49:42.330
It's about women.

00:49:42.330 --> 00:49:43.080
What is it called?

00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:44.760
But I just let it go
on until I finally

00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:45.801
went [FLAT TONE] Jezebel.

00:49:45.801 --> 00:49:47.162
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:47.162 --> 00:49:48.870
RICHARD GINGRAS: In
the interest of time,

00:49:48.870 --> 00:49:53.580
and I want to conflate a second
question with one that I wanted

00:49:53.580 --> 00:49:56.200
to get into, which is about
women in leadership positions.

00:49:56.200 --> 00:50:00.220
And even notion of women
not necessarily accepting

00:50:00.220 --> 00:50:03.020
that they can be in
leadership positions.

00:50:03.020 --> 00:50:08.960
So a) why do you do what you do?

00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:10.960
How are you comfortable
doing what you're doing?

00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:12.177
Who inspired you to--

00:50:12.177 --> 00:50:12.843
ANNA HOLMES: Me?

00:50:12.843 --> 00:50:15.207
RICHARD GINGRAS: Yeah, you.

00:50:15.207 --> 00:50:17.540
ANNA HOLMES: Well, I don't
feel like I'm in a leadership

00:50:17.540 --> 00:50:18.707
position right now because--

00:50:18.707 --> 00:50:20.581
RICHARD GINGRAS: Not
literally at the moment.

00:50:20.581 --> 00:50:21.290
ANNA HOLMES: OK.

00:50:21.290 --> 00:50:23.899
RICHARD GINGRAS: But you've
been in a leadership position.

00:50:23.899 --> 00:50:25.440
ANNA HOLMES: I don't
know that I ever

00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:28.075
had a model of being in
a leadership position,

00:50:28.075 --> 00:50:30.830
but I feel like I fell into it.

00:50:30.830 --> 00:50:32.630
And that there was
definitely a part of me

00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:36.210
that was absolutely terrified
throughout the whole thing,

00:50:36.210 --> 00:50:38.820
even when it was you think
I could have put my feet up

00:50:38.820 --> 00:50:39.470
and relax.

00:50:39.470 --> 00:50:42.360
I was absolutely terrified.

00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:44.590
Because I didn't know
how to be a manager.

00:50:44.590 --> 00:50:46.550
I had to teach myself
how to be a manager.

00:50:46.550 --> 00:50:50.080
And that's a very
specific type of job.

00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:51.820
There's no water cooler.

00:50:51.820 --> 00:50:54.530
You're not taking your
employees out to lunch

00:50:54.530 --> 00:50:55.610
or shooting the shit.

00:50:55.610 --> 00:50:56.390
It's very intense.

00:50:58.524 --> 00:51:00.940
I guess I don't know how to
answer that question because I

00:51:00.940 --> 00:51:03.660
don't know that I've
thought that much about it.

00:51:03.660 --> 00:51:09.260
I certainly am in awe of
women in leadership positions

00:51:09.260 --> 00:51:16.110
that are very visible, like
in business or in politics,

00:51:16.110 --> 00:51:20.580
whether it be Hillary Clinton or
any number of female senators,

00:51:20.580 --> 00:51:23.600
or females of Supreme
Court justices.

00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:26.231
I ran into one of them
in DC two days ago.

00:51:26.231 --> 00:51:27.105
RICHARD GINGRAS: Who?

00:51:27.105 --> 00:51:27.730
Not Ginsburg.

00:51:27.730 --> 00:51:28.771
ANNA HOLMES: Elena Kagan.

00:51:28.771 --> 00:51:30.170
No, I wish Ginsburg.

00:51:30.170 --> 00:51:33.934
Not to diss Kagan. [LAUGH]

00:51:33.934 --> 00:51:35.350
RICHARD GINGRAS:
Justice Ginsburg.

00:51:35.350 --> 00:51:37.580
ANNA HOLMES: Yeah, yeah.

00:51:37.580 --> 00:51:42.000
But I guess I've given women
in leadership positions,

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:43.750
in terms of politics
and business thought,

00:51:43.750 --> 00:51:45.800
but as totally apart
from me, but not

00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:47.410
so much how it relates
to my own life.

00:51:47.410 --> 00:51:53.990
And I think that there's still
a certain amount of inability

00:51:53.990 --> 00:51:54.680
to imagine--

00:51:54.680 --> 00:51:57.660
Well, I think there's a
certain amount of insecurity

00:51:57.660 --> 00:51:59.640
still about what am
I going to do next?

00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:01.660
And am I going to be
the boss of something?

00:52:01.660 --> 00:52:03.070
And what would that look like?

00:52:03.070 --> 00:52:05.680
Even though I've
done that before.

00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:07.580
It's not enough to
stop me from doing it,

00:52:07.580 --> 00:52:10.190
but it's not like
it comes naturally.

00:52:10.190 --> 00:52:13.980
Although, I'm told I was
very bossy as a child.

00:52:13.980 --> 00:52:15.810
So maybe it's in my DNA.

00:52:15.810 --> 00:52:18.190
But I do think
that a lot of girls

00:52:18.190 --> 00:52:24.390
have that socialized out of
them in many complex ways

00:52:24.390 --> 00:52:27.570
that I'm not immune to, and that
I have to challenge as well.

00:52:27.570 --> 00:52:29.900
So I'm sorry if I'm
avoiding the question,

00:52:29.900 --> 00:52:31.840
but it's not one I
have a good answer for.

00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:33.131
RICHARD GINGRAS: It's truthful.

00:52:33.131 --> 00:52:34.860
ANNA HOLMES: Yeah.

00:52:34.860 --> 00:52:37.610
RICHARD GINGRAS: Well,
let's take one more.

00:52:37.610 --> 00:52:38.710
What the heck.

00:52:38.710 --> 00:52:40.850
AUDIENCE: So for those of
you who are unfamiliar,

00:52:40.850 --> 00:52:44.490
Brian Goldberg, who started
Bleacher Report put together

00:52:44.490 --> 00:52:45.780
a woman's blog.

00:52:45.780 --> 00:52:49.000
And I also read a response
that you had to it.

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:51.760
I, admittedly, haven't
actually looked at Bustle,

00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:54.890
so I don't really know
much about the content.

00:52:54.890 --> 00:53:01.864
But I'm just wondering if you
had any tips for him, or what--

00:53:01.864 --> 00:53:03.280
ANNA HOLMES: Write
something else.

00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:03.550
AUDIENCE: --your--

00:53:03.550 --> 00:53:04.210
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:04.210 --> 00:53:06.260
AUDIENCE: --response is to that.

00:53:06.260 --> 00:53:12.220
ANNA HOLMES: I should
probably put them in context.

00:53:12.220 --> 00:53:15.620
Because this young
man got $6 million

00:53:15.620 --> 00:53:18.140
in funding to start this
women's website called Bustle,

00:53:18.140 --> 00:53:19.640
and then he'd wrote
something that

00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:22.100
was published in PandoDaily,
Daily which was a very press

00:53:22.100 --> 00:53:26.950
release soundy, in which he
patted himself on the back

00:53:26.950 --> 00:53:30.660
for having come up with the
brilliant idea of merging

00:53:30.660 --> 00:53:33.125
pop culture and
politics for women.

00:53:33.125 --> 00:53:35.782
It was the weirdest-- At
first I had to read it twice

00:53:35.782 --> 00:53:37.990
because he was describing
any number of websites that

00:53:37.990 --> 00:53:39.920
had been around for a long
time, including Jezebel,

00:53:39.920 --> 00:53:42.290
or even magazines that had been
around long before Jezebel came

00:53:42.290 --> 00:53:42.420
along.

00:53:42.420 --> 00:53:43.030
RICHARD GINGRAS:
[INTERPOSING_VOICES] funding

00:53:43.030 --> 00:53:43.300
proposal--

00:53:43.300 --> 00:53:44.160
ANNA HOLMES: It
was unbelievable.

00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:44.610
RICHARD GINGRAS: --for 1998.

00:53:44.610 --> 00:53:46.780
ANNA HOLMES: It is
so self-aggrandizing.

00:53:46.780 --> 00:53:52.640
And naive, and tone deaf,
and self-congratulatory,

00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:54.940
and it was just weird,
and it made me mad

00:53:54.940 --> 00:54:00.540
because it was erasing
the existence of people

00:54:00.540 --> 00:54:03.770
who had pioneered that
space long before he had.

00:54:03.770 --> 00:54:07.130
It was a bit chest thumpy.

00:54:07.130 --> 00:54:11.426
And there's a certain skepticism
among a lot of the people

00:54:11.426 --> 00:54:13.170
I know in the media,
especially women,

00:54:13.170 --> 00:54:18.180
to Silicon Valley
row chest thumping.

00:54:18.180 --> 00:54:23.650
Even though we're not really
privy to it because a lot of us

00:54:23.650 --> 00:54:24.480
live in New York.

00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:27.105
It was just something that just
really rubbed me the wrong way.

00:54:27.105 --> 00:54:29.380
So I wrote a
comment to the post,

00:54:29.380 --> 00:54:32.930
along with a number of other
women, that wasn't probably

00:54:32.930 --> 00:54:34.130
very nice.

00:54:34.130 --> 00:54:37.570
I mean I didn't call him names,
but I was angry about it,

00:54:37.570 --> 00:54:38.820
as were a lot of other people.

00:54:38.820 --> 00:54:40.530
So what advice would I give him.

00:54:40.530 --> 00:54:42.540
Well, the thing is
that he seems to think

00:54:42.540 --> 00:54:45.930
that he can build his site
into a powerhouse with,

00:54:45.930 --> 00:54:49.110
I don't know-- he was talking
about 50 million uniques

00:54:49.110 --> 00:54:49.720
a month.

00:54:49.720 --> 00:54:50.803
Like that's what he wants.

00:54:50.803 --> 00:54:52.707
Something enormous like that.

00:54:52.707 --> 00:54:54.290
And it's very possible
he can do that,

00:54:54.290 --> 00:54:56.915
but it's also highly likely that
it's not going to be any good.

00:54:56.915 --> 00:54:58.440
Because it sounds
to me that if he

00:54:58.440 --> 00:55:03.090
wants to build a site at
that scale with the quickness

00:55:03.090 --> 00:55:06.260
that he-- I don't know if it's
supposed in five years or what,

00:55:06.260 --> 00:55:09.210
but that it's going to be a lot
of shit throwing at the wall

00:55:09.210 --> 00:55:12.920
and seeing what sticks,
as opposed to quality.

00:55:12.920 --> 00:55:14.500
And I also don't
know if that really

00:55:14.500 --> 00:55:15.970
is a way to build
a community when

00:55:15.970 --> 00:55:19.430
there's just stuff everywhere.

00:55:19.430 --> 00:55:21.250
One of my problems
with women's media

00:55:21.250 --> 00:55:23.350
online, before the
site started, the sites

00:55:23.350 --> 00:55:26.140
that were online, like iVillage.

00:55:26.140 --> 00:55:28.840
I guess that was for older
women, which is fine.

00:55:28.840 --> 00:55:30.410
But I'm not even sure what--

00:55:30.410 --> 00:55:33.010
RICHARD GINGRAS: They
weren't older women then.

00:55:33.010 --> 00:55:34.740
ANNA HOLMES: It was
just incoherent,

00:55:34.740 --> 00:55:36.560
in the same way that the
"Huffington Post" sometimes

00:55:36.560 --> 00:55:37.320
can be incoherent.

00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:40.070
It's like something--
too much going on.

00:55:40.070 --> 00:55:43.220
So if he wants to make an
incoherent media property that

00:55:43.220 --> 00:55:46.114
gets 50 million uniques
a month and makes

00:55:46.114 --> 00:55:48.030
lots of money for him,
great, but I'm not sure

00:55:48.030 --> 00:55:50.500
it's going to be any good.

00:55:50.500 --> 00:55:53.980
But my advice to him
would be like shut up.

00:55:53.980 --> 00:55:56.081
I don't mean he should
like not start a site.

00:55:56.081 --> 00:56:00.100
But he should maybe look at
the space and talk to people

00:56:00.100 --> 00:56:04.220
and take in things
before he pops off

00:56:04.220 --> 00:56:05.810
like he did in that post.

00:56:05.810 --> 00:56:08.967
But I think that he probably
was very chastened by it.

00:56:08.967 --> 00:56:10.800
It seemed like he was
very apologetic by it.

00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:14.760
And I actually felt sorry
for him after a while,

00:56:14.760 --> 00:56:16.670
until "The New Yorker"
article came out,

00:56:16.670 --> 00:56:18.253
and then there was
that picture of him

00:56:18.253 --> 00:56:21.450
using a woman as a table--
one of his female employees

00:56:21.450 --> 00:56:23.710
as a table, on which
he rested his laptop.

00:56:23.710 --> 00:56:26.530
And I was like, OK, I don't
feel sorry for you anymore.

00:56:26.530 --> 00:56:27.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:27.360 --> 00:56:28.110
ANNA HOLMES: Yeah.

00:56:28.110 --> 00:56:32.700
I actually haven't looked
at that site at all.

00:56:32.700 --> 00:56:34.150
I just think I'm not interested.

00:56:34.150 --> 00:56:35.183
At some point I'll
go look at it.

00:56:35.183 --> 00:56:36.000
Are you bringing it up?

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:37.416
RICHARD GINGRAS:
It's right there.

00:56:37.416 --> 00:56:38.530
ANNA HOLMES: Oh.

00:56:38.530 --> 00:56:40.260
RICHARD GINGRAS:
It actually managed

00:56:40.260 --> 00:56:42.260
to nail national cat day today.

00:56:42.260 --> 00:56:43.330
ANNA HOLMES: Wow, OK.

00:56:43.330 --> 00:56:47.010
I thought it was uber
national cat day, or is it--

00:56:47.010 --> 00:56:47.856
RICHARD GINGRAS: No.

00:56:47.856 --> 00:56:49.590
I'm told it's national cat day.

00:56:49.590 --> 00:56:50.120
ANNA HOLMES: I
thought you were going

00:56:50.120 --> 00:56:51.610
to talk about the
crazy cat lady?

00:56:51.610 --> 00:56:52.530
RICHARD GINGRAS: Well, I was.

00:56:52.530 --> 00:56:54.655
And since we're not getting
kicked out of the room,

00:56:54.655 --> 00:56:55.822
yes, it is national cat day.

00:56:55.822 --> 00:56:57.529
I heard somewhere that
your favorite post

00:56:57.529 --> 00:56:58.510
was about cat ladies--

00:56:58.510 --> 00:56:59.055
ANNA HOLMES: Oh, no no.

00:56:59.055 --> 00:57:00.180
RICHARD GINGRAS: Not
post, your entry.

00:57:00.180 --> 00:57:02.082
ANNA HOLMES: It's not
my favorite entry.

00:57:02.082 --> 00:57:04.290
The thing is that I've looked
at the text in the book

00:57:04.290 --> 00:57:07.720
so many times and read the
posts over so many times

00:57:07.720 --> 00:57:11.420
that they all kind
of are a blur to me.

00:57:11.420 --> 00:57:13.740
And what I like about the
crazy cat lady [INAUDIBLE]

00:57:13.740 --> 00:57:17.650
is just an illustration, done
by a San Francisco illustrator,

00:57:17.650 --> 00:57:19.730
is that it, like
some other posts,

00:57:19.730 --> 00:57:26.440
takes a historically
maligned type of individual,

00:57:26.440 --> 00:57:30.160
the crazy cat lady, and honors
her in a very loving way.

00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:32.515
Because I would describe
myself as a crazy cat lady.

00:57:32.515 --> 00:57:33.060
I don't have eight cats.

00:57:33.060 --> 00:57:33.560
I have one.

00:57:33.560 --> 00:57:36.430
But just like there's
just certain things

00:57:36.430 --> 00:57:41.200
that people who have
pets or cats know.

00:57:41.200 --> 00:57:43.075
And that's why I
particularly like that post.

00:57:43.075 --> 00:57:44.449
RICHARD GINGRAS:
Well, thank you.

00:57:44.449 --> 00:57:47.020
And that's proving, once
again, that all conversations

00:57:47.020 --> 00:57:48.760
ultimately get
around back to cats.

00:57:48.760 --> 00:57:49.510
ANNA HOLMES: That's
right, on the internet.

00:57:49.510 --> 00:57:50.009
Yeah.

00:57:50.009 --> 00:57:53.370
RICHARD GINGRAS: So
I thank you usually

00:57:53.370 --> 00:57:55.714
for being here with us
today, and more importantly,

00:57:55.714 --> 00:57:56.630
for doing what you do.

00:57:56.630 --> 00:57:56.755
And--

00:57:56.755 --> 00:57:56.880
ANNA HOLMES: Thank you.

00:57:56.880 --> 00:57:58.720
RICHARD GINGRAS: I just can't
wait to see what you do next.

00:57:58.720 --> 00:57:59.320
ANNA HOLMES: Thank you.

00:57:59.320 --> 00:57:59.920
Thanks, Richard.

00:57:59.920 --> 00:58:01.045
RICHARD GINGRAS: Thank you.

00:58:01.045 --> 00:58:27.419
[APPLAUSE]
