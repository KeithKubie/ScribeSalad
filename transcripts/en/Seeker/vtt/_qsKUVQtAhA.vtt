00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.359
Scientists are looking into sustainably powering
entire cities, and with liquid-based redox

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:08.750
flow batteries, we’re one step closer to
making that happen.

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:13.820
If we’re ever going to replace fossil fuels
with renewable sources like solar and wind

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.840
power, then we’re going to need a way to
store energy for when it’s dark and not

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.100
windy, or just for when the demand for power
exceeds the output.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:27.080
If you’re familiar with any sort of electronic
device, then there is one pretty obvious answer:

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.240
batteries.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.660
Charge them up when demand is low but output
it high, then let the juice loose when that

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:33.660
flips.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.149
But there are different battery types, and
all have their own strengths and weaknesses.

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:42.309
This best battery for a job like this might
be one that uses flowing liquids, called a

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:43.980
redox flow battery.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.590
A redox flow battery is sort of a hybrid between
a battery and a fuel cell.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.480
It consists of two tanks of an electrolyte
liquid, one positive and one negative.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.489
In between the tanks is a cell stack, where
the positive and negative solutions are pumped

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:00.329
to but kept separated by a membrane.

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:06.020
Inside the cell stack the ions in the negatively
charged solution give up an electron, a process

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.870
called oxidation.

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:12.360
Those electrons are picked up by an electrode
in the cell stack, and they travel through

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.160
whatever needs to be powered before arriving
at another electrode on the other side of

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.740
the membrane.

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:24.340
There the ions in the positive solution pick
up the electrons, a process called reduction.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.080
This frees up positively charged hydrogen
ions, which travel back across the membrane

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.230
and maintain the charge balance.

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.690
When charging up, the entire process happens
in reverse.

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.220
But hold up, why go through all this when
we have already lithium-ion batteries?

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.950
You know, the ones in cell phones, laptops,
electric cars, and oh yeah, household battery

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.170
packs designed for exactly this purpose?

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.690
The problem is that while a big ol’ lithium-ion
battery might be suitable for your house,

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.230
they don’t scale up well for something as
big as an entire city.

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:00.710
Lithium isn’t an abundant material either,
so it’s not sustainable to use it for these

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.660
huge applications.

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.200
And anyone who’s had the same phone for
more that a couple years can tell you that

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.939
lithium-ion batteries degrade and lose their
ability to hold a charge over time.

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:15.230
On the other hand, flow cell batteries have
qualities that make them perfect for large-scale

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.290
power storage, like scalability.

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.220
Need to store more energy?

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.269
Get bigger tanks that hold more solution,
that’s it.

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:23.959
Worried about degradation?

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:29.140
Some electrolyte solutions used in redox flow
batteries can last for about 5,000 charge

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.400
cycles, five times longer than lithium-ion
batteries.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.819
What about price and sustainability?

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:36.599
Ah, about that…

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:41.010
The most popular metal used in redox flow
batteries is vanadium because it charges and

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.150
discharges reliably for thousands of cycles.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.079
But the cost of vanadium is rising, and if
vanadium redox batteries go mainstream that

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:51.239
price could skyrocket.

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.760
Researchers have tried to replace vanadium
with organic molecules, but those tend to

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.260
degrade and need replacement every few months,
or the solution they’re in has to be very

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.950
acidic or basic, which can damage pumps or
be hazardous in case of a leak.

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:09.279
But scientists are undeterred, and recently
researchers from USC announced organic water-based

00:03:09.279 --> 00:03:14.879
redox batteries that can last for about 15
years at one tenth the cost of a lithium-ion

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:15.879
battery.

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:19.439
So far the battery they’ve made is enough
for the basic electricity demands of a single

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:25.099
house, but their goal is to one day have electricity
on tap for entire mega-cities.

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:29.650
The technology is promising enough that China
is building a massive vanadium redox flow

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.690
battery with a storage capacity of 800 Mega
Watt hours.

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.010
That’s enough for thousands of homes.

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.159
The battery is scheduled to come online by
2020.

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:42.989
China has plenty of vanadium reserves so they’re
not too concerned about it’s cost, but if

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:47.840
organic flow cell batteries become comparable,
those might not be too far behind.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:53.200
One day in the near future, they might play
a vital role in green energy grids around

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.200
the world.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.200

And then maybe watch this cool video about
how we can make batteries..out of DIAMONDS.

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:04.349
And fun fact: While Vanadium may not be the
future of redox flow batteries, it is super

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:05.349
cool.

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:09.889
When vanadium gains electrons it changes color,
going from yellow, to blue, to green, and

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:11.150
finally purple.

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.329
