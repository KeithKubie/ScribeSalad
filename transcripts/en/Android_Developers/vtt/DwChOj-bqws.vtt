&gt;&gt; BEUST: Hi. My name is Cedric Beust. I am
a Software Engineer on the Android Project.

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.600
One of my favorite features on Android is
Gmail. Whenever I carry my device with me

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:13.080
it stays automatically synchronized between
my desktop and my device. Let me show you

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.470
how this works. This is my inbox and there
are three unread conversations here. I'm going

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:26.860
to mark them as read and then I'm going to
go to the device and see what happens. Now

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:31.100
that my email has changed on my desktop, the
device automatically synchronizes with my

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.840
desktop. And there you go, my email has been
updated.
