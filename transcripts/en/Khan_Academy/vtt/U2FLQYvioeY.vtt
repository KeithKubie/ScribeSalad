00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.590
We're on problem 17.

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:09.240
The sum of three consecutive
odd integers is 111.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.920
That's what they tell
us at the top.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:11.810
I won't write that.

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:14.440
If n represents the least of the
three integers, which of

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:15.900
the following equations
represents

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.010
the statement above?

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.610
So n is the least of the
three integers, so

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:21.040
let's say that's n.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.440
So it's the least of three
consecutive odd integers.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.970
So what's the next odd
integer going to be?

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.080
It's not going to be n plus 1,
because n plus 1 is going to

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.110
be an even integer, right?

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.430
If this was 3 then the next odd
integer's going to be 5,

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.870
which is going to be n plus 2.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.470
And then the next one above that
is going to be n plus 4.

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:42.240
And you can try it out.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.000
Let's say that n was 3, and
this is 5, and this is 7.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.460
That's three consecutive
odd integers.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.820
And they're telling us
that the sum is 111.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:51.900
So the sum is 111.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.870
What's the sum of these
three terms?

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.400
Well, you add up
the three n's.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.110
n plus n plus n is 3n.

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.380
And then 2 plus 4, 3n plus 6.

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.500
And that's going to
be equal to 111.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.060
And that is choice D.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.640
Maybe I just confused you
how I wrote this.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.880
All I did is I said that's the
same thing as n plus n plus 2

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.640
plus n plus 4, which is
equal to 3n plus 6.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:20.890
Next problem.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.160
Problem 8.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.150
And they do this arc.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.720
It looks something like that.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.920
It actually looks better
than what I just drew,

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.190
but you get the point.

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.030
So there's like a distance of 2,
and then there's a distance

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.700
of b, it looks like.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:53.800
So it's 2 then b then 2 then
b then 2 then b again.

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.630
The figure above shows part
of a circle whose

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.660
circumference is 45.

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.260
So the circumference of
the circle is 45.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.600
If arcs of length 2 and length b
continue to alternate around

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.509
the entire circle, so this is
just part of the circle and

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.889
they just keep going
around the circle.

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:12.470
They just keep going around the
circle so that there are

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.020
18 arcs of each length.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.990
What is the degree measure of
each of the arcs of length b?

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.690
So they say there's 18
arcs of each length.

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.880
They say that there are 18 of
these arcs of lengths 2, and

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.690
there's 18 of these b segments
because they're saying this

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.620
is-- well, they drew
this as part of the

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.300
whole circle, right?

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.050
So that means that if the entire
circumference is 45,

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.385
but in terms of 2's and b's, we
know that there's 18 2's ,

00:02:43.385 --> 00:02:45.660
so it's 18 times 2.

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.990
And then we also know that there
are 18 b's, plus 18b.

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:51.940
This is another way of writing
the circumference of the

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.540
circle. because they say that
the circumference is made of

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.660
18 of these arcs and 18 of these
b arcs here, so this is

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.270
also equal to the circumference
of the circle,

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.890
which they told us is 45.

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.500
Now let's see, this is 36.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:13.800
18 times 2 plus 18b
is equal to 45.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.260
Subtract 36 from both sides.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.900
You get 18b is equal to 9.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:26.710
b is equal to 9/18, which
is equal to 1/2.

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:28.070
Now what are they asking?

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:33.310
What is the degree measure of
each of the arcs of length b?

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:40.190
So we know that each b is 1/2.

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.760
And actually, you know what?

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.720
We could have gone
to this step.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.180
We could have said that 18 b's--
well, no, actually, this

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.680
is-- each b is of length
1/2, right?

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.410
So what fraction is that of
the entire circumference?

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.120
This length right here is 1/2.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.370
That's what we just
solved, right?

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.840
You saying there's going to be
18 b's and 18 arcs of length 2

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.120
and they all add up to 45.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.715
We solve for b.

00:04:04.715 --> 00:04:05.770
It's 1/2.

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:07.910
We want to figure out what's
the degree measure.

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:12.600
So to figure out the degree
measure, we say, well, 1/2 is

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:18.230
to the circumference of the
entire circle, which is 45, is

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:22.000
equal to the degree measure over
the total degrees in the

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.460
entire circle, because the
fraction in terms of the

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.520
circumference is the same thing
it's going to be in

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.430
terms of degrees as a fraction
of 360 degrees.

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.680
Why?

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.320
Because there's 360 degrees
in the circle.

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.010
So let's cross-multiply this.

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:39.690
1/2 times 360 degrees, so you
get 180 degrees-- that's 1/2

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:44.020
times 360-- is equal to 45x.

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:49.130
So x is equal to 180
divided by 45.

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.780
And what's 180 divided by 45?

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.740
Let's see, 40 goes into 160,
it's 4 times, right?

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:56.730
x is equal to 4.

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:58.540
4 times 45, right?

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:00.450
So x is equal to 4 degrees.

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:01.690
And that's choice A.

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.230
That also makes sense
intuitively.

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:06.970
4 degrees is a very small amount
of degrees, so that

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:09.190
makes sense if you were
going from the center.

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.270
I know what I just drew just
probably confused you.

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.290
Hopefully, you get the idea.

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:16.620
Figure out how long the b's
are and then what fraction

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:19.430
that is of the entire
circumference and then that's

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:23.120
what fraction it is
of 360 degrees.

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.830
Problem 19.

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:29.090
The cost of maintenance on
an automobile increases

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.190
each year by 10%.

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:34.340
And Andrew paid $300 this year
for maintenance on his

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:35.080
automobile.

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.110
Fine.

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:40.620
If the cost c for maintenance on
Andrew's automobile n years

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:44.680
from now is given by the
function, so c of n is equal

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:52.230
to 300x to the n, what
is the value of x?

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:55.860
So they say every year the
cost increases by 10%.

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:59.130
So what does it mean
to increase by 10%.

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:03.150
Let me say the cost in year 1,
let's say the cost in year 1

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:06.350
is going to be-- what's
the cost in year 2?

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:11.040
It's going to be the cost of
year 1 increased by 10%.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:17.710
So plus 0.1 times the cost in
year 1, which is equal to 1.1

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:20.410
times the cost in year 1.

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:26.320
The cost in year 3 is equal to
1.1 times the cost in year 2,

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.830
which is the same
thing as what?

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:35.630
1.1 times the cost of year
2, which is this.

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:40.620
1.1 times 1.1, cost of year
1, which is the same

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:45.210
thing as 1.1 squared.

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:49.900
So every year that you go out,
you're essentially just taking

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:53.070
1.1 to that power of how many
years you're going out.

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:55.240
Actually, I should probably make
this cost of year 0, make

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:58.620
this cost of year 1, 0, 0, 0.

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:00.956
This is probably confusing you,
but cost of year 2, so

00:07:00.956 --> 00:07:05.020
then the exponents at least
match up: 1 and then 0.

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:06.500
Then the exponents match up.

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:11.450
The cost of year 2 is 1.1
squared times cost of year 0.

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:13.790
So as you can see, all we're
doing when we're doing this,

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:15.290
this is kind of an exponential
growth problem.

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:17.540
But they're just saying
what is this base?

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:19.440
But when you increase something
by 10%, you're

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:22.080
essentially multiplying
it by 1., so

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:23.510
that's all they're asking.

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:26.330
So that's choice C.

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:27.580
Next problem.

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:40.341
They drew this parallelogram,
which I have not drawn well.

00:07:40.341 --> 00:07:41.670
It gets the point.

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:57.060
A, B, C, D.

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:59.720
If the five line segments in
the figure above are all

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:02.930
congruent-- OK, so the five
lines, these are all

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:05.940
congruent, so they're all
equal to each other.

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:08.530
all of those sides, what
is the ratio of the

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:10.990
length of AC, not drawn?

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:14.870
So they want to know AC,
so that's this length.

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:20.560
They want to know
AC to length BD.

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:21.160
All right.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:24.270
So all of those lines
are congruent.

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:24.480
You know what?

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:25.590
Let's just pick a number.

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:27.290
That's what I find to
be easiest when

00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:28.260
they tell us it all.

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:32.669
So let's just say that this
is 1, this is 1, this

00:08:32.669 --> 00:08:34.990
is 1, this is 1.

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:37.510
This whole thing is
going to be 1.

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:41.590
So how long is this and this?

00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:44.830
This will bisect this
line, right?

00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:48.230
I think we know that about
parallelograms that the two

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:51.450
lines bisect each other,
the two diagonals.

00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:56.466
So this is going to be 1/2, and
this is going to be 1/2.

00:08:56.466 --> 00:08:58.730
And there's also something
else we know.

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:05.900
We know that this is 60 degrees,
this is 60 degrees,

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:11.710
that this whole angle is 60
degrees, this whole angle is

00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:12.280
60 degrees.

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:13.010
And how do we know that?

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:14.770
Before we drew the green line,
we knew that both of those

00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:17.980
triangles are equilateral
triangles.

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:21.610
So if this whole angle was 60
degrees, then this angle right

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:24.410
here is going to
be 30 degrees.

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:26.870
And I think you see where
I'm going with this.

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:30.980
This is a 30-60-90 triangle
where this is 1-- that's the

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:32.610
hypotenuse-- this is 1/2.

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:35.960
And then what is the side
opposite the 60-degree side,

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:36.915
which is this?

00:09:36.915 --> 00:09:41.896
The square root of 3 times
this side right here.

00:09:41.896 --> 00:09:45.520
The square root of 3/2.

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:46.250
