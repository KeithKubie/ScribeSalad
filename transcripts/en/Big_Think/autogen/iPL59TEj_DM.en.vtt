really but but one of the things that's
interesting about it to me is the much

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:26.410
interesting about it to me is the much
 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.160
interesting about it to me is the much
looser structure of the game and a much

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:29.170
looser structure of the game and a much
 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.760
looser structure of the game and a much
greater agency that the player has to

what he's tried to do is to offer every
 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.380
what he's tried to do is to offer every
possible variation of every moment you

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390
possible variation of every moment you
 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.599
possible variation of every moment you
know so boy meets girl they fall in love

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:45.609
know so boy meets girl they fall in love
 

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:47.190

Fork yeah and he wants to tell both

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780
Fork yeah and he wants to tell both
 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.450
Fork yeah and he wants to tell both
those stories and then every variation

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460
those stories and then every variation
 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.609
those stories and then every variation
of every moment down both those lines

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619
of every moment down both those lines
 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:55.709
of every moment down both those lines
and of course it's like nuclear fission

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:55.719
and of course it's like nuclear fission
 

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:58.440
and of course it's like nuclear fission
that the possibilities explode into

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450
that the possibilities explode into
 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.480
that the possibilities explode into
millions and billions of possibilities

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490
millions and billions of possibilities
 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.340
millions and billions of possibilities
and it's impossible to write that book

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350
and it's impossible to write that book
 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.279
and it's impossible to write that book
but it seems to me that in some ways the

00:02:05.279 --> 00:02:05.289
but it seems to me that in some ways the
 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:07.440
but it seems to me that in some ways the
Internet is the Garden of forking paths

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450
Internet is the Garden of forking paths
 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.320
Internet is the Garden of forking paths
you know where where you where you can

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330
you know where where you where you can
 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.000
you know where where you where you can
have myriad variant possibilities

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010
have myriad variant possibilities
 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.440
have myriad variant possibilities
offered at the same level of

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450
offered at the same level of
 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.020
offered at the same level of
of authority if you like so I mean I

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030
of authority if you like so I mean I
 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.890

think that's one of the ways in which

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900
think that's one of the ways in which
 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.839
think that's one of the ways in which
storytelling could move and these games

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:24.849
storytelling could move and these games
 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:27.809
storytelling could move and these games
these more freeform games in which the

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:27.819
these more freeform games in which the
 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:31.290
these more freeform games in which the
player can make choices about what the

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300
player can make choices about what the
 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.390
player can make choices about what the
game is going to be you know become a

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400
game is going to be you know become a
 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.860
game is going to be you know become a
kind of gaming equivalent of that

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870
kind of gaming equivalent of that
 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.630
kind of gaming equivalent of that
narrative possibility

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640
 
 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.210
 
there are legitimate concerns there and

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220
there are legitimate concerns there and
 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.580
there are legitimate concerns there and
I worry also that there's a dumbing down

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590
I worry also that there's a dumbing down
 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.620
I worry also that there's a dumbing down

something to be worried about because I

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890
something to be worried about because I
 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.170
something to be worried about because I
think that there is something about

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180
think that there is something about
 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.590
think that there is something about
storytelling that is very intrinsic to

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600
storytelling that is very intrinsic to

storytelling that is very intrinsic to
who we are as human beings that one of

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940
who we are as human beings that one of
 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.780
who we are as human beings that one of
the characters in the book refers to man

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790
the characters in the book refers to man
 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.180
the characters in the book refers to man
as the storytelling animal you know and

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190
as the storytelling animal you know and
 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.310
as the storytelling animal you know and
and so we are we are the only creatures

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:11.320
and so we are we are the only creatures
 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.890
and so we are we are the only creatures
on the earth who do this so and we may

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900
on the earth who do this so and we may

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630

the way that we have a language instinct
you know we may actually have a story

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810
you know we may actually have a story
 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:25.200
you know we may actually have a story

legitimate concern about a new form
 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.510
legitimate concern about a new form

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.460
which may erode our attachment to the
story what would that do to us as human

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470
story what would that do to us as human
 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.820
story what would that do to us as human
beings

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830
