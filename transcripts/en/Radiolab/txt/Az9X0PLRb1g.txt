Speaker 1:          00:00          Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad and I'm Robert Krulwich and we are talking on radio lab about things stochastic like going flips in lottery tickets. Let's just push this whole argument another step forward if we may, which mean let's talk about human beings. Would it surprise you Jen, if I told you that on the subject of predictability, humans and coins are kind of similar. It wouldn't surprise me because I wouldn't believe it. You wouldn't believe it if I made you an argument. So powerful. So phishing that you will be falling back on your buck in surprise and staring at me with a kind of simple admiration that you rarely have because here it is. It is. I'm going to talk to you about basketball, basketball. That is a sport where people have a, what do you know about basketball? I need basketball is a game of skill. Don't even try and pretend is like random forces like coin flip. Nope, nope, nope. Let me make you an argument. Let me make you an argument. Let's just take to make it really interesting. The most skilled basketball team ever. For example, you could take a look at the 82 to 83 76

Speaker 2:          00:57          no, Philadelphia, 76 years. Maurice Cheeks. Quiet. No regular on our show. It's one of the best NBA teams home. All the cheat sheets. The doctor Jake's whooping underneath putting it up in here. So, so during the playoff, isn't it the 76 or it was all incredibly hot. Take my man, Andrew, Tony during this run he was eating sometimes Andrew tooney would make five shots in a row. He would be considered hot. That's the deal. Angela hits his mark once. It's his mark twice. It doesn't like three times. Now I'm going to pass them cause he's obviously hot. The basket looks to him that it's the size of a soccer goal. He's golden. He's got the gods on his.

Speaker 1:          01:41          We're talking about them. We're, because in this situation you'd have to agree to the Andrew. Tony was hot, right? Yes, that's the word. So what exactly do you mean when you say hot? Why are you asking me? [inaudible] he's, he's making a bunch of shots in a row. And if you're on his team and you're coming down the court, you pass the ball to Andrew because he's on a roll with the fan assumes is that after five shots you'd be more likely to make a six shot. That to me just seems like like a common sense. If he's waking lots of buckets, of course you're going to pass the to if did the players assume this? Obviously if they're going to pay. The players all believe this coaches believed this too. The coaches believe it, so it actually dictates the plays they call. Everyone assumes it to be true that the hot end is a real thing and dictates the flow of basketball games. Thank you Jenna Bat, the hot hand doesn't exist.

Speaker 1:          02:29          You could just get, you just went through this whole rigmarole about the six years being hot. Yeah. While they were a great team, but a lot of scientists have looked at this question of hotness and sports and in fact there's a couple of scientists who actually looked at all the maid shots and the Ms Shots of this 76 [inaudible] team. And when they looked directly at the numbers, emotions aside, just the data, here's what they found. At the very moment you think you're hottest, you're actually freezing cold. Wait, that can't be right. Some of these percentages are pretty damning. Take Andrew. Johnny. During the regular season, Tony made 46% of his shot, 46% after hitting three shots in a row, which means he's in the zone. He's totally there. His field goal percentage drops to 34% so that is what I'm saying. That's what I'm telling you Jenn at boom red. And the reason seems to be is that Andrew knows he's hot or he thinks he's hot, so he's taking less responsible shots. He's taking, you know, the three-point jumper from way beyond the art and he assumes his streak will somehow save him.

Speaker 3:          03:30          Cannot be because Johnny UFCU, you've been the basketball games. You see what happens, guy makes three shots in a row. The crowd gets up. Suddenly there's an electricity in the air. Every time the guy gets the ball, everyone stands up and anticipation. You're telling me that's all a figment of our collective imagination.

Speaker 1:          03:45          It is a figment of our collective imaginations and it's, and it's especially a figment of the way we kind of calculate streaks. The reason Andrew seems so hot is because he makes three.

Speaker 2:          03:55          This is the fourth makes the fifth. This is the sixth makes the seventh and eighth. It's really rewrite

Speaker 1:          04:03          that essentially random process. This, this mixture of makes and misses. We rewrite it in terms of, oh, it's a street. Once we think he's hot, we tend to edit what actually happens to kind of preserve that sense of the street. Ah, okay. Don't believe Jonah.

Speaker 3:          04:16          What about Jay Kohler, our statistician from, uh, Arizona state DV. I've listened to him. No reason to think even if, whether he missed seven in a row or made seven or o or made three of his last four, I don't really care. I know that he's a machine. He's like a 52% shooting machine or whatever his number is. No, but he's, and he's a, he's not a machine though. He's sleazy. He's like person with, with uh, with confidence that ebbs and flows. There's a different, there's got to be a difference there. I agree with you. You, you've just described the psychological theory that makes the hot hand beliefs so compelling and so hard to get rid of with data, but it just doesn't matter whether the player made three or miss three, their probability of making that fourth shot, that next one is pretty much the same. This is very, very depressing. Essentially what you're saying is that basketball players are like coins. Coins. Yes.

Speaker 4:          05:11          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          05:11          the fact is, Jed, you are Koby Bryant even is more like a coin than any of us had neared to imagine. Colby now has a pattern. In his case it's what, 50 60 40 on any given night with Kirby, you think, oh, this is, he's back. Tyco always doing because he's just having another night of his very 60, 40 life. And that's just the way it plays out. Even on a shot by shot basis, you're saying, yeah, each shot seems to be kind of a random event. Exactly. Are you, are you willing to concede this statistically this is not yet. It's so counterintuitive. It, I still as a basketball fan, I was just watching game of the night saying pastor cobia cause he's clearly hot. Um, the only exception to this whole whole

Speaker 5:          05:58          literature of streakiness is uh, is, is a hockey, no, is this sport no one cared about? Is it, is it Joe Dimaggio's hitting streak where he eats for 42 games in a row? I've gotten the book somewhere. Actually Jody Maggio's heady streak was 56 games. 56. Yeah. So Joe Dimaggio is just about the only Adler you can find in professional sports. Only real hero. Yep. Well at least I got Joe

Speaker 6:          06:39          [inaudible].

Speaker 5:          06:41          You know what yet one reason you have trouble, I think more than Trello still, you're not the only person who is a person of pattern and habit. We all are pattern rules. The brain. Here's another story. This is again from Joan Alara, but this one is about a woman, I believe. Her name is Ann.

Speaker 7:          07:03          Oh, name Khan. Stabber. I live in a small country town where most people know that the people

Speaker 5:          07:11          n was a high school English teacher. Yeah. Tough for 31 years now lives in West Virginia. Wait, can you wait the Smith, there's someone at my door, I'm sorry. They know that. And then of course of course, and most an upstanding citizen went to church every Sunday was just one of those people who makes the world go round. It makes the world go round. I'm sorry. Not at all.

Speaker 7:          07:33          Anyway, in 1991 I would go to the grocery store and on the occasions I wrote a check for my groceries that was say, gosh, you're shaky.

Speaker 5:          07:45          And she says, she began to notice that her hands would to,

Speaker 7:          07:48          oh, are you all right? But a this something maybe it was because of working hard and trying to get everything then

Speaker 5:          07:57          and it got particularly bad when she said she was just walking in the mall. Doing some shopping

Speaker 7:          08:02          and, and it was balanced self walking and I was like a stepped off a staff that wasn't there you,

Speaker 5:          08:11          it was the first full body tremor. She fell.

Speaker 7:          08:14          And then my husband was a doctor and they sent me to a neurologist who day lists me with Parkinson's.

Speaker 5:          08:25          Well, how old, how old is she by the way? She was at that point in her early fifties. What is Parkinson's? Parkinson's is the death of dopamine neurons in the back of your brain, in the part of your brain that controls bodily movement. And so when these neurons die, the end result is first a shaking hand and the loss of feeling and the loss of movement. And then of course the tremors get worse and worse. Right. Anyway, well the doctor diagnosed with Parkinson's and he gives her a drug called the [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          08:52          quip was a new medicine, 1992.

Speaker 5:          08:56          It's a pseudo dopamine in basically mimics dopamine and the synapse of the cells.

Speaker 7:          09:01          And it was like a miracle drug for me.

Speaker 8:          09:07          [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          09:09          her tremors disappear, her symptoms disappeared. So she's cured or uh, if you looked at her on Requip years after she had Parkinson's, you wouldn't notice anything. She would seem symptom free. So about seven or eight years ago by all the wild, they're upping the doses to compensate for the cell loss. It's still taking place in the early years of 2000 and something sort of unusual happened to Anne.

Speaker 7:          09:35          Some friends of mine had gone to Las Vegas every year for them basketball tournament, the Phantom for type thing. And um, they asked would a, I took a with them and I said yes I would.

Speaker 5:          09:55          So she went to watch basketball, but as often happens in Vegas, one afternoon she and her friends found themselves in a casino. Had you ever gambled before this trip to Las Vegas?

Speaker 7:          10:04          Nah, I was raised in a household that was fairly religious and we considered gambling a sin.

Speaker 5:          10:12          But as she stood there in the Casino in Vegas, she had this inexplicably urge to go to the slot machines,

Speaker 7:          10:18          the frozen quinces and cars and cherries and the lemon. The Shubin will span and see what the pictures did. I've never taken any drags side or anything to compared to bit, it was like a high, that was sort of the beginning of a

Speaker 5:          10:40          um, and then, and then when she comes back to West Virginia,

Speaker 7:          10:42          yeah. It can wait to get to a machine that really want to buy.

Speaker 5:          10:46          She discovers the dog racing tracks. Good spot that 15 miles away from my house.

Speaker 7:          10:51          Yeah. Seven 30 be there when they

Speaker 5:          10:53          open and that's, and that's where she would go. And they had a wider sort of slot machines. Are you

Speaker 7:          11:03          if I had the money at play all day

Speaker 5:          11:05          from seven to three 30 in the morning. Wow. Um, and then she would go home and play slots. The computer on her computer. I'm not even sure

Speaker 9:          11:14          for money.

Speaker 5:          11:16          Just for the sheer visceral thrill.

Speaker 7:          11:19          Oh, apply that now. That's the night. Seven 30 then it's morning. I'll be back

Speaker 5:          11:25          the joint without any sleep at all. No sleep. And she could keep it up for several days in a row.

Speaker 7:          11:32          It's the beginning of my gambling. I'd wake up in the night and just screaming out, Oh God, what am I doing? Help me save me. But eventually I became too hard. Our did I guess, see even pay attention to them.

Speaker 5:          11:48          Her credit cards are all maxed out.

Speaker 7:          11:49          So my mother's silver, so my silverware, things that should've been my son's heirlooms though from the safety deposit.

Speaker 5:          11:59          She steals quarters from her grandkids, steals quarters from her grandkids. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          12:03          Yeah. Anything like that around the house. I thought I could get money out of everyone who knows her as watching her life fall apart. Right. House was filthy, dirty and math have haven't take time to even wash dishes. She lives on peanut butter. It doesn't have any crackers or bread or anything. This had been a better, um, because that's all she can afford and still leave as much money as possible for the slots. Even when I be at church at thing was so many more minutes or so many more hours. I can get gamble. Her husband eventually leaves her. I mean, I loved my son, but I got divorced. There's just no decision. Everything is gambling. One of the neat things about gambling he is, he can do it by yourself.

Speaker 5:          12:53          How much money did you lose during those years, if, if you don't mind me asking,

Speaker 7:          12:57          I lost at least $300,000. 300,000 now,

Speaker 5:          13:02          which to her is, is all your life savings and it's one quarter at a time. Yeah. That's the surreal part.

Speaker 8:          13:10          Bad

Speaker 7:          13:11          dread. Several things. I went to a Rehab facility, uh, father, I told judge rice in a really, they just, Huh. So that is, I would say bad days, but shoot me for bad for the, the, he wouldn't approve of this. He wouldn't be so disappointed me

Speaker 8:          13:37          bed.

Speaker 7:          13:38          See at is getting stop.

Speaker 8:          13:44          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          13:44          let me pause here for a second, Jeff. Uh, I want to just take a moment to try to figure out what exactly is happening to and yeah, why can't she stop? Yeah. It turns out there may be an explanation if you look into her brain. Well remember earlier we talked about a little chemical called dopamine and how she didn't have enough dopamine in her brain. So that was giving her some kind of movement trouble. The Parkinson's. Right. It also turns out to be the case that anytime you do something that makes you feel good, your Brene spurts out dopamine.

Speaker 5:          14:14          For years, that's how scientists saw dope mean as as the neurotransmitter of pleasure, the neurotransmitter of sex, drugs and rock and roll. But you said earlier that dopamine has to do with movement. Well, what is the ultimate purpose of movement? From the perspective of evolution, it's to get you to food. It's to get you to sex. It's to get you to a reward. So that's why the same circuits, the same chemical that controls motivation, that controls what you want, also controls movement.

Speaker 1:          14:38          But if it turned out it was a little more complicated than that. In the, in the mid 1970s guy named Wolfram Schultz decided to take a much closer look. Man, he has subjects. It

Speaker 5:          14:48          was a monkey. So he would put these very thin needles that can record the activity of individual Dokeman neurons in the monkey brain.

Speaker 1:          14:56          And they put the monkey in the room and then every day they would walk down the hall to the room. The hunky was, it opened the door. Hello, monkey flip on the light. They give the monkey some juice. You go monkey. And then when the monkey sip the juice

Speaker 8:          15:14          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          15:14          let me happy monkey. Right. But then comes a surprise.

Speaker 5:          15:17          He soon discovered something very odd about these neurons

Speaker 1:          15:21          as the juiced this monkey. Hey. Hello. Monkey monkey. Danielle. Monkey. Dannon, monkey. The squirt dopamine, which they were always measuring in the monkey's brain seem to move forward in time. What do you mean? Well, at first the dopamine hit when the monkey took the sip juice. Hello Monkey. But after awhile the monkey got the dopamine hit when they entered the room and switched on the light and a monkey. After a few more times, the dopamine hit when the researchers feet could be heard walking down the hall. You see what's happening here? Hello, monkey. Um, not really. You'd have to bring it home for a little bit and I'll, I'll do it again. What the monkey is trying to do is piece together the sequence of events that inevitably lead to juice. Exactly. That's what these cells do. They try to predict reward.

Speaker 5:          16:15          Oh, so this isn't just about movement or about feeling good. It's about finding the pattern of the thing that makes you feel good. Yeah, it's pattern find. Oh, this is pure pattern recognition. This is essentially how your brain makes sense of reality in some very primitive sense. It parses reality in terms of rewards. So this is how you get more food in the wild is you. You can see the reward before anyone else can. So we're talking about like basic survival stuff here. There's one other wrinkle though, method Dokeman system that makes casinos and slot machines so tantalizing, which is that these cells are also programmed to be very sensitive to surprising rewards. So this seems to be, most scientists speculate that the seems to be your brain's way of telling you pay attention. You just got something for free. This must be good. Sit here in this nice comfy velvet chair and try to figure out this reward. So now imagine Anne sitting there at the slot machine. She pushes the button on the machine machine

Speaker 10:         17:14          [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          17:15          and sirens and bells go off coins claim and inside her head

Speaker 8:          17:20          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          17:21          her dopamine. You're on there saying this is wonderful, but now how did this happen? Where did this big Roy come from? What did you do this time? Why are you so happy? All of a sudden

Speaker 10:         17:32          searching for something they had frozen. The number of cherries that she had just before was it that this machine had 13 hits and this was the 14th dot. I can tell you it has all kinds of pattern, like things. It has bells, it has white,

Speaker 5:          17:50          but the problem is is that there is no pattern defined. There is no pattern. It's inherently random. It's inherently unpredictable. And while the rest of us might just, you know, give up and walk away, God, I just wasted a hundred bucks on this stupid machine. I should go get lunch and can't go to lunch. Her dopamine system is too powerful, too potent, oh cause of that drug she's taking, right? It keeps surging and surging, forcing her neurons to fight, fight hard to find a pattern. That's what's gripping her. Her brain is intoxicated at the possibility that it will learn how to succeed, that it will crack and uncrackable code thought I was good at soften and machines. In fact, she told me a story about she would go to buy milk, um, and then spend the next 12 hours with the milk rotting next to her is she puts quarter after quarter after quarter into this machine. Were you surprised when you learn that the medication might be responsible for your gambling addiction?

Speaker 7:          18:48          I mean, as some was said to me, this mezzo causes compulsive gambling. I thought they're crazy.

Speaker 5:          18:57          It's just at that time where the first studies come out showing that this is actually a common side effect of Brexit.

Speaker 7:          19:03          Really. So there were other ans appearing in other places. Same deal. Absolutely. Basically after my neurologist sent me off the rig, clear, her compulsion disappeared instantaneously, almost immediately. That fast. Well, within a weekend say wow, it was gone. Evan gambled for nearly three years. Did her Parkinson's return. Yeah, I have dreamers lot worse recently. Again, like king, I have trouble walking and he's so awkward. So the price of not being a gambling addict is living with debilitating Parkinsonian symptoms. That last son, let me finish about my son, and I told him after the clique game plan, I said, son, so the things that belong to you that you, these said, mom, they're just this really great debut bag.
