MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
Good morning, everyone.

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:03.490
Thanks for joining us today.

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:04.740
My name is Matthew Hendershot.

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.740
I am the video editor,
post-production guy

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.900
for the Talks at Google team.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.400
And for the past year, I've
also served as a very personally

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.340
satisfying role as director
for the original online series,

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:16.420
"Songs of the Road."

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.295
Joining me here today
to talk more about Song

00:00:18.295 --> 00:00:20.040
Craft presents and
"Songs of the Road"

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.170
are the stars of the show,
Ben Arthur, singer/songwriter,

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.226
radio host Rob Reinhart, and
producers Al Houghton and Mike

00:00:26.226 --> 00:00:26.726
Crehore.

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:31.740
Good morning, guys.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:32.479
Good morning.

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:33.490
What don't we go down
the line, and you

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:35.550
guys can just personally
introduce yourself.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.470
Tell us a little bit
about your background

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.800
and what your role
is with the show.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.180
BEN ARTHUR: Sure.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.950
My name's Ben.

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:43.880
I do the songwriting.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.470
So we bring in an artist,
and I sit down with them,

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:52.300
and write and record a song in
a very brief period of time.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.780
ROB REINHART: I'm Rob Reinhart.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.950
I host a syndicated
radio program

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.640
called, "Acoustic Cafe."

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.600
We're in our 21st year.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.260
And in this project,
I drove the car.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.910
I played the bald guy.

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.740
Look at all this hair up here.

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.990
BEN ARTHUR: Not that he's
self-conscious, or anything.

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.820
ROB REINHART: And,
along the way,

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.560
have done some interviews with
the artists that are involved

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.570
in the Song Craft project.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.380
ALAN HOUGHTON: I'm Al
Houghton, musician, producer.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.100
I have a studio downtown
called Dubway Studios.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.190
And we're involved in
producing the music

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.837
that the songwriters write.

00:01:27.837 --> 00:01:29.420
MICHAEL CREHORE: And
I'm Mike Crehore.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.770
I was partners with
Al at Dubway Studios.

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.660
That's how we met up
with Ben originally.

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.220
And helped to produce
the music, and capture it

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.862
in whatever strange place where
we needed to capture it in, so.

00:01:41.862 --> 00:01:43.570
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
Now Rob, as you said,

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.879
you've been doing Acoustic
Cafe for over 20 years.

00:01:45.879 --> 00:01:46.670
ROB REINHART: Yeah.

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.044
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: What
brought you into this situation,

00:01:49.044 --> 00:01:52.810
where you were starting back
over the brand-building process

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.260
in a whole new medium--
that of online video--

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.120
and with a whole
new group of people?

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.940
ROB REINHART: Yeah.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.500
You know, actually,
it's interesting.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.900
I've been turning down video
options since the late '90s.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.550
People who have
come along and said,

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.389
you really have stuff on video.

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:12.346
This is probably 1997, '98.

00:02:12.346 --> 00:02:14.720
And the reason I wanted to
get involved with this project

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.740
was it specifically
was not going

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.532
to be the thing that
I wanted to avoid,

00:02:18.532 --> 00:02:24.640
which was yet another series
of guys and girls with guitars,

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.000
in high definition,
playing their songs.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.690
I just thought,
you know, the web

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.040
was sort of flooded with that.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.570
And I didn't see any
reason to contribute to it.

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.630
I didn't see how it would
extend my brand any.

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.130
What I was interested
in doing was

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.240
something that had a
narrative, something

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.550
that presented a new story.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.300
It wasn't just an
artist doing what

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.080
they do on my radio
program, but with pictures.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.110
Instead, it actually
had a story to it.

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.325
And so that's what was such an
attractive thing when Ben sort

00:02:52.325 --> 00:02:54.410
of threw this idea out there.

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.260
It was an interesting
way to tell a new story.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.500
That's why.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.820
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
So this was about 2013

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.980
when the conversation began for
us to start working together.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.450
But we had been doing
this narrative approach

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:08.980
for quite a bit more than that.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.140
Ben, why don't you talk
about how the three of you,

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.600
and then, ultimately, I got
involved in that, came about.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.360
BEN ARTHUR: Yeah, so
for a couple years

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.370
we had been just
throwing artists together

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.160
in the guys' studio
and writing songs

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.350
with them-- John Wesley
Harding and Ximena Sarinana

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.400
and a whole bunch
of other folks.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:35.220
And we needed to grow our
ability to distribute that

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.460
and to bring in great artists.

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:41.320
And Rob knows everyone.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:42.834
All of the artists.

00:03:42.834 --> 00:03:45.250
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: From the
video standpoint, when we all

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.340
got together and
started doing this,

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.400
we wanted to tell it as
like a reality TV show.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.530
But we knew we were not
going to be on TV at first,

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.465
so it was all about being
online, trying to find a way

00:03:56.465 --> 00:03:57.340
to publish it online.

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.756
I think some of the first ones
we published in five parts.

00:03:59.756 --> 00:04:00.530
BEN ARTHUR: Yeah.

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.080
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: And so
we could keep the size down,

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.040
and keep it contained as
something people would watch.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.400
And then, we also did it in
Dubway Studios, your studio

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.240
downtown.

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.400
So we had a little bit of a
contained studio space as well,

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.922
right?

00:04:10.922 --> 00:04:12.630
Why don't you guys
talk about the process

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.070
that we were going
through back then,

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:17.800
and how it all came
together as a show.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:21.589
ALAN HOUGHTON: Well,
you know, initially it

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:22.650
was pretty small minded.

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.608
It was like, wow, how do
we get more, you know,

00:04:24.608 --> 00:04:27.080
studio hours in the studio?

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.020
But then it became
obvious, this is actually

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.260
way more interesting
and cool than that.

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.740
So by putting songwriters who
don't know each other at all,

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.160
there's a drama
element, automatically.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.614
And we did not know
how that would manifest

00:04:40.614 --> 00:04:41.780
or what would happen at all.

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.860
In fact, we were thinking
almost more technically.

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.776
You know, people'll be
interested in like what

00:04:45.776 --> 00:04:49.160
mike you use, and how you
use the software, and all

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.900
this stuff.

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.120
And as, as it evolved,
it became more apparent

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.450
that actually the dynamic
of the songwriting

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:58.540
is much more the cool story.

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.230
And the other stuff became
less and less critical

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:03.670
as we went on.

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:06.540
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: So
2013, South by Southwest,

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.624
we decide to go down
and take a crack at it.

00:05:09.624 --> 00:05:10.290
How did that go?

00:05:12.796 --> 00:05:14.420
ROB REINHART: Well,
you know, actually,

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:16.909
so you guys started in
'09 doing this at Dubway?

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:18.200
BEN ARTHUR: Somewhere in there.

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.700
ROB REINHART: Because it was
'09 that you first brought this

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:21.280
idea to me.

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:27.249
And I think I said, well, I
don't see any money in it.

00:05:27.249 --> 00:05:29.540
And not to be totally mercenary
about it, but it really

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:31.370
was like, you know, to
really do this well,

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.530
I think it's going
to require a lot.

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:37.230
And for 2013, the key
to going down there

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:40.190
was being able to make sure
that we weren't just doing

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:42.840
this, paying for it
out of our own pockets,

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.955
and having a go at it.

00:05:44.955 --> 00:05:46.330
We were not part
of the festival.

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.134
We were doing this
kind of rogue.

00:05:48.134 --> 00:05:49.400
It was a rogue project.

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.770
We got a condominium
on Riverside.

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:54.300
We just set up, and we
invited people to come.

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:58.070
And we kind of cobbled together
from some independent sources.

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:01.410
You know, just people who would
advertise on the radio program

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:04.000
would underwrite the
videos, would get, you know,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.310
placement within the videos
which sort of started us

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:07.780
down that path.

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:10.509
So being able to pay
for it-- and nobody lost

00:06:10.509 --> 00:06:12.300
any money on that--
and we were able to pay

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:15.170
our artists a little bit
of money to participate,

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:17.450
it sort of changed the
dynamic a little bit,

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:19.480
and made it something
that we were all

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.742
working towards in a different
way than just doing it for fun.

00:06:22.742 --> 00:06:24.450
BEN ARTHUR: And the
studios were awesome.

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:26.075
ROB REINHART: The
songs were fantastic.

00:06:26.075 --> 00:06:26.807
Four of them.

00:06:26.807 --> 00:06:28.140
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Was it four?

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:28.600
Or was it three?

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:28.990
ROB REINHART: Four.

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:30.430
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: I want
to touch back on something.

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:31.560
We got a condominium.

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:32.839
You mentioned that.

00:06:32.839 --> 00:06:34.380
And Al, you went
down the first year.

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:34.880
ALAN HOUGHTON: No, Mike.

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:34.970
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Mike.

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:37.220
Mike, you went down the
first year to do that.

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:41.340
Talk about leaving, you know,
multimillion dollar Dubway

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:43.230
Studio's facility and
going down to record

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:44.230
these things in a condo.

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:44.810
MICHAEL CREHORE:
You kind of have

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:46.620
to think outside of
the box a little bit.

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:49.740
And, but you know,
the whole world

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:53.990
has, has come to this
gorilla recording thing

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:54.820
and embraced it.

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:57.050
I mean, just look at
YouTube and anything else.

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:01.240
Everybody is both
recording, and taking video,

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:02.480
and doing it themselves.

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:05.290
And Al and I both
came-- even though we

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:07.090
had a beautiful
studio to work in-- we

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:09.130
came from a
do-it-yourself background.

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:12.490
So early on, we were-- you know,
before they had computers--

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:15.060
were working with 2-tracks,
and 4-tracks, and 8-tracks,

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:18.760
and 16-tracks, whatever we
could afford to kind of get

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:20.290
the process going.

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:25.444
So for me, it was pretty
invigorating to go.

00:07:25.444 --> 00:07:28.870
Ben said, hey, let's go to South
by Southwest and do this thing.

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:30.520
And I'm like, yeah, OK.

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:33.150
So we took a couple of small
interfaces down with us.

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:35.110
I think we had four inputs.

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:38.197
We were working in a
condominium, which meant Ben,

00:07:38.197 --> 00:07:40.280
you have to get up now,
because the guys are going

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:41.470
to be here in a half hour.

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:43.770
And we've got to move your
bed out of the living room

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:46.764
and put it into the
bedroom so we can work.

00:07:46.764 --> 00:07:49.390
And but it was nice.

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:53.106
And everybody,
everybody who came was,

00:07:53.106 --> 00:07:56.202
were in it for the, for
getting the best song

00:07:56.202 --> 00:07:57.410
they could get in the moment.

00:07:57.410 --> 00:08:01.450
And when that happens,
it just makes the,

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:02.526
makes the process easy.

00:08:02.526 --> 00:08:05.680
I mean, later on, we had to take
the things back to the studio

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:08.160
and enhance some of
the productions a bit,

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.480
which is also fun for me.

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:12.216
Because I get to play a lot of
instruments and put on a lot

00:08:12.216 --> 00:08:12.840
different hats.

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:15.130
But it was great.

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:17.724
I mean, you just have
to capture that moment

00:08:17.724 --> 00:08:22.570
when Ben and this artist
get the kernel of a song.

00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:24.760
And I think Rob, that
first year he was saying,

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:26.170
you know, he's he's, sweating.

00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:28.770
He's going, I don't know
if this is going to work.

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:29.690
Does this really work?

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:30.880
Is this really going to work?

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:33.020
ROB REINHART: Something I
continue to do to this day.

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:34.309
MICHAEL CREHORE:
And so go ahead.

00:08:34.309 --> 00:08:34.850
Tell them--

00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:36.230
ROB REINHART: Well, we should,
we should point out though,

00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:38.771
and we should just make it very
clear that what we were doing

00:08:38.771 --> 00:08:41.350
was trying to create a
brand new song-- brand

00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:44.579
new song-- from nothing in about
a three hour period of time

00:08:44.579 --> 00:08:45.370
with these artists.

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:46.666
We didn't have them for long.

00:08:46.666 --> 00:08:48.040
We just had them
for a few hours.

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:50.030
We were working in a
space that really was not

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:51.307
much larger than this stage.

00:08:51.307 --> 00:08:52.890
MICHAEL CREHORE: No,
it was probably--

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:54.100
ROB REINHART: You put
the kitchen there.

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:54.660
That's it.

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:57.100
This was the condo
we were working in.

00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:59.080
And everybody brought
different ideas.

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.980
I mean, some brought
no ideas whatsoever.

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:03.330
I mean, they really
just-- Ben and the artist

00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:06.030
staring at each
other for a second.

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:06.850
Now we go.

00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:09.000
And we were capturing
it on video and audio,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.070
and yeah, it was a little scary.

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:12.090
Sure.

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:14.520
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Well, and
I think one of things for me

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:17.880
on the video direction
standpoint that

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:21.560
was important was always
telling the real story,

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:25.150
and then focusing on
that creative moment.

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:28.030
One of the things that we talk
about us as creative people

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:29.490
is like demo-itis.

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:31.250
Or that, you know,
when-- the first time

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:32.980
you draw a picture, the
first time you do something,

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:34.300
you're like, aw,
this is perfect.

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:36.758
And then, the more you work on
it, the more you work on it,

00:09:36.758 --> 00:09:39.220
you get further and further
away from that initial charge.

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:41.580
And I know that's a big
philosophy of yours, too, Mike,

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:43.720
is like, catch it
in that first time.

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:46.100
So I think that we really
embraced that, going down

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:48.410
to say, this is the situation.

00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:50.060
This is the reality
of it all, right?

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:53.710
BEN ARTHUR: Yeah, and the songs
aren't meant to be necessarily,

00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:58.120
like, you know, sometimes a
live song goes on an album,

00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:01.850
and some of the falling
apart is beautiful.

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:08.710
But the mess, you know,
is really compelling.

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:12.160
And the fear and the
excitement of trying

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:17.410
to remember the lyrics and
trying to play it right

00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:21.290
is present, and adds,
heightens the song.

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:23.410
So, you know, we've had
artists come on the show,

00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:25.360
and write a song
with us, and then

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:28.040
re-record it for their record,
you know, get in the studio

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:29.920
and take their time.

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:34.280
But that, that
freshness is exciting.

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:36.910
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: So we have
a video clip our first year

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:39.700
down to South by Southwest,
and this features an artist

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:43.250
from upstate New York
named Sean Rowe, who

00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:47.880
came in with a really, kind
of haunting melody and idea

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:51.020
for a song that came
together, and was sort of one

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:53.030
of our biggest successes.

00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:54.380
BEN ARTHUR: That year, yeah.

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:57.490
MICHAEL CREHORE: And also,
he was the first one.

00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:59.150
ROB REINHART: The
very first one.

00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:01.066
MICHAEL CREHORE: He was
the first one at South

00:11:01.066 --> 00:11:03.821
by, so when, as Rob and I were
going, is this going to work?

00:11:03.821 --> 00:11:05.570
As soon as he opened
his mouth, and you'll

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:09.617
see you'll hear this, we
went, oh, yeah, he's great.

00:11:09.617 --> 00:11:11.450
BEN ARTHUR: And the fun
thing about the song

00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:15.890
is that he'd been
working on this chord

00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:19.500
sequence and this
melodic idea that he

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:21.050
brought for seven years.

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:23.050
He'd been trying to
finish this song.

00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:25.760
And brought it to us,
and it's like yeah,

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:27.530
we can, yeah, this is great.

00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:30.695
And a lot of
creativity is about,

00:11:30.695 --> 00:11:31.752
you know, making choices.

00:11:31.752 --> 00:11:33.460
And that's what we
sort of specialize in.

00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:35.100
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: So
seven years of creativity

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:37.600
crammed into three hours of
actually getting it done.

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:40.178
Let's take a look at the clip.

00:11:40.178 --> 00:11:42.563
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:48.310
-I had talked to Rob
with Acoustic Cafe

00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:50.150
about doing this project.

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:52.320
And said, you know,
and he said, well,

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:54.560
if we only get three
hours, is that enough?

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:57.530
And I was like, yeah,
absolutely, that's enough.

00:11:57.530 --> 00:12:00.140
And yet, there was a part
of me that was terrified.

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:06.610
The song got finished
very quickly.

00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:10.310
Like within less than an
hour, we had the song down.

00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:13.400
The first time I heard Sean
play the song through it

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:16.070
was, I mean it's
really a charge.

00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:22.082
[MUSIC - SEAN ROWE, "THE COAT"]

00:14:19.211 --> 00:14:21.170
[END PLAYBACK]

00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:24.900
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: So that was
one of the pieces from the 2013

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:26.580
trip to South by Southwest.

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:29.920
Again, it came from nowhere
except seven years' worth

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:33.150
of ideas, and then three
hours later, it was that song.

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:35.940
One of the other artists
that we worked with in 2013

00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:38.370
was an artist by the
name of Steve Poltz.

00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:39.750
Steve Poltz is
one of those names

00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:42.870
that you don't
know that you know.

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:44.860
But he is actually
the writer, one

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:47.770
of the co-writers behind
Jewel's smash breakout hit,

00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:49.062
"You Were Meant For me."

00:14:49.062 --> 00:14:50.520
So we got to write
with Steve Poltz

00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:52.160
and then stayed
in touch with him,

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:55.800
and that led us to another
interesting opportunity, that

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:57.690
being Folk Alliance
and our first foray

00:14:57.690 --> 00:14:59.300
into actual
broadcast television.

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:00.950
BEN ARTHUR: But
let's pause a moment

00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:03.366
and say that the song that we
wrote with Steve was called,

00:15:03.366 --> 00:15:06.839
"Your Mama has a Tramp Stamp."

00:15:06.839 --> 00:15:08.380
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
At South by, they

00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:10.150
wrote, "the Tramp Stamp" song.

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:11.494
Very fun, bouncy.

00:15:11.494 --> 00:15:12.660
BEN ARTHUR: Yeah, which he--

00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:13.640
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: I
don't have that on--

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:14.100
BEN ARTHUR: Yeah.

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:14.641
That's right.

00:15:14.641 --> 00:15:16.430
Which he then,
that night, played

00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:19.539
live in front of 300 people
at a club, and crowd-surfed.

00:15:19.539 --> 00:15:21.122
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
Made them sing it.

00:15:21.122 --> 00:15:21.470
Right.

00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:22.120
It was--

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:23.440
BEN ARTHUR: Amazing

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:25.565
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: So we
stayed in touch with him.

00:15:25.565 --> 00:15:28.500
And there's a festival
called Folk Alliance that

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:30.710
happens in Kansas
City every year,

00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:32.964
and through-- I don't know.

00:15:32.964 --> 00:15:34.880
Explain to me the
conversation that took place

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:37.680
that, how we connected
with the next step.

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:41.920
BEN ARTHUR: So I was speaking
with a couple folks at PBS

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:44.550
because we've been
connected to some folks

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:45.490
at the national level.

00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:47.860
And one of the folks
there suggested

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:50.300
we speak to the
local PBS station.

00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:55.580
And because we had been talking
about expanding into what

00:15:55.580 --> 00:16:00.040
we thought could be
a half-hour show,

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:03.370
I suggested that we maybe try
to collaborate on something.

00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:05.050
And she said, Yeah, sure.

00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:08.380
We'll give you a
crew, and we'll take

00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:11.980
care of the capturing of it.

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:14.540
And, you know, because that's
expensive to get folks who are,

00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:16.630
fly in folks from New York.

00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:19.110
And we found a bar.

00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:22.499
And Al and I went out
there and put together.

00:16:22.499 --> 00:16:23.540
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Cool.

00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:26.460
And that turned into
a half-hour episode

00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:29.300
which aired on KCPT,
which is the Kansas

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:31.330
City affiliate for PBS.

00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:34.214
We have a clip of that too
that we'd like to show you.

Because if you have to
write, and you give yourself

a deadline, it's
not always good.

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:47.200
There's no rules.

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:53.810
I gotta go.

00:16:53.810 --> 00:16:55.000

the best for them.

MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: So right
after Folk Alliance then, again

00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:11.090
it's South by Southwest.

00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:15.500
And having taken on a
half-hour version of our show,

00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:17.240
and completed the
year before what

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:20.500
we thought were pretty
successful forays into it,

00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:25.170
we had a good bit of momentum,
feeling pretty confident,

00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:28.170
had a bit more brand weight,
and so, going back down to South

00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:32.610
by Southwest in 2014, we
struck out a little bit bigger.

00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:36.872
Why don't you guys talk
about the 2014 South by?

00:19:36.872 --> 00:19:39.874
ROB REINHART: Well,
from my perspective,

00:19:39.874 --> 00:19:42.360
you went back to Fall
of 2013, I actually

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:45.260
ran into a couple of guys
who booked the festival.

00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:48.240
And somehow they had heard
about this rogue effort

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:50.010
that we had put
together in 2013.

00:19:50.010 --> 00:19:51.550
I don't know how.

00:19:51.550 --> 00:19:54.580
And they said, would you be
interested in becoming actually

00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:56.550
part of the festival in 2015?

00:19:56.550 --> 00:19:59.060
We're like, yeah,
sure, that'd be great.

00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:00.930
So they set us up with a panel.

00:20:00.930 --> 00:20:03.120
So we knew that at
the end of the week,

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:05.452
we would be able to
actually present-- much

00:20:05.452 --> 00:20:07.410
like we're doing here--
we'd be able to present

00:20:07.410 --> 00:20:10.544
the work that we did as an
actual part of the festival.

00:20:10.544 --> 00:20:11.460
Plus we got the badge.

00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:13.750
And that was kind of nice too.

00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:17.060
And then, we turned this
into-- then suddenly,

00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:21.120
that homespun effort of 2013,
where we cobbled together

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:23.130
just enough to
meet our expenses,

00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:27.330
suddenly we were confronted with
a budget and branded content.

00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:30.850
BEN ARTHUR: Yeah, so through
a friend of a friend,

00:20:30.850 --> 00:20:33.880
we ran into someone from Subway.

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:35.930
And they asked us if
they'd be, if we'd

00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:39.260
be interested in working
with them as sponsors.

00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:43.730
And it was like, and
you will give us money?

00:20:43.730 --> 00:20:44.525
OK then, yes.

00:20:44.525 --> 00:20:46.150
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
I think at the time

00:20:46.150 --> 00:20:47.733
they were doing a
big thing with South

00:20:47.733 --> 00:20:50.720
by that was all about
Fresh, Get Fresh, Get Fresh.

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:54.426
And so one of the
angles we played was,

00:20:54.426 --> 00:20:56.300
it doesn't come much
fresher than a song that

00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:57.870
was written three hours ago.

00:20:57.870 --> 00:20:59.690
That's pretty fresh.

00:20:59.690 --> 00:21:00.740
It's OK.

00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:02.480
We do-- we also had
the opportunity--

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:05.810
we did seven of the
songwriting sessions

00:21:05.810 --> 00:21:09.040
over the course of five days.

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:14.520
And we hit probably the highest
mark on-- aside from Ben,

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:17.180
of course-- on the
talent scale, which

00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:20.334
was Mercury Prize
nominees Turin Brakes, who

00:21:20.334 --> 00:21:21.250
came in and joined us.

00:21:21.250 --> 00:21:23.120
We do have a clip
of that as well.

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:25.350
And also a really great show.

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:28.220
So if we can roll that clip.

it can be quite isolating and,
you know, quite bare in a way.

00:21:36.650 --> 00:21:39.230
And the minute someone else
starts throwing things in,

00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:41.972

better ideas, as well.

about maturity, but I do,

you know, we have finally
grown up as a band.

Like, it's taken us a long
time to get to the point

00:21:54.371 --> 00:21:56.430

go, this really works.

MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: A
couple things for me

00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:07.040
with that one in particular
that I really enjoy.

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:10.650
And and with all of the
ones from that South by is,

00:23:10.650 --> 00:23:14.640
that was our first foray
into real branded content,

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:17.380
paid ad placement, but we
were able to do in such a way

00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:19.410
to where the ads are
baked into the video.

00:23:19.410 --> 00:23:23.270
So you just saw a commercial
for Subway, Chaotica,

00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:26.880
Taylor guitars, and a handful
of other sponsors, as well.

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:29.490
But we were able to present
it in a different way

00:23:29.490 --> 00:23:31.100
than just commercials.

00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:33.730
And that's always been something
that's been important to me

00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:35.120
from the director side.

00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:38.070
It's like, we don't want
to fall across that line

00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:42.170
and be like "Ace of Cakes,"
which is a joke we made often.

00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:43.860
And then, the other
bit was I'm pretty

00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:48.750
sure that the word "liminal" was
placed in that song on a bet,

00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:49.250
right?

00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:50.208

I was in the edit bay
constantly getting that going.

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:08.200
What else was going on on
the brand front through 2014?

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:10.050
ROB REINHART: Well,
an interesting thing

00:24:10.050 --> 00:24:12.580
coming out of South by
Southwest experience,

00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:16.040
that budget from Subway
allowed all of us

00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:18.960
to attend-- we had a full team.

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:24.430
We had seven artists, as you
mentioned, a larger place,

00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:25.790
we so there was growth.

00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:26.370

00:24:31.884 --> 00:24:32.780
ROB REINHART: Right.

00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:36.200
So coming out of
the festival, we

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:42.180
ran across a publicity person, a
PR person in Detroit, who said,

00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:43.870
gee, you know, this
is a great project.

00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:47.280
Maybe I should take
this to friends

00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:51.620
at Ford, or Team Detroit,
actually-- their agency.

00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:54.257
And we really got a
one word response.

00:24:54.257 --> 00:24:55.590
Because this is what we pitched.

00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:57.010
We pitched, you
would be involved

00:24:57.010 --> 00:24:58.427
in this like Subway was.

00:24:58.427 --> 00:25:00.260
BEN ARTHUR: But we were
like, wait a minute.

00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:02.522
Will you pay us?

00:25:02.522 --> 00:25:03.230
ROB REINHART: OK.

00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:03.870
BEN ARTHUR: OK.

00:25:03.870 --> 00:25:08.100
ROB REINHART: But their
response was no but

00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:14.610
it was no but how do you feel
about putting this on the road?

00:25:14.610 --> 00:25:17.760
And we came back to them with
a proposal, which really became

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:21.160
this Songs of the Road
Adventure through 2015,

00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:23.130
and they sat there for
a couple of months.

00:25:23.130 --> 00:25:25.900
And then they came back and
said, let's give it a try.

00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:28.780
So it was taking the
songwriting sessions now,

00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:33.320
and suddenly, we had to
move this and make it--

00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:37.540
we had to literally move it and
make it a much larger project

00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:38.956
and a larger team.

00:25:38.956 --> 00:25:41.699
And it was amazing.

00:25:41.699 --> 00:25:43.490
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
Well, and the property,

00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:47.580
the property itself is an
interesting mix at that point.

00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:49.070
Because it is branded content.

00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:52.790
We are baking in these sort
of commercial elements.

00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:56.910
And then, it's a hybrid of like
reality TV, and documentary,

00:25:56.910 --> 00:26:00.130
and then packaged
to be viewed online.

00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:02.010
So you look like you
had something to--

00:26:02.010 --> 00:26:03.070
ROB REINHART: Oh,
you know, but I

00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:04.270
wanted to say
something just to be,

00:26:04.270 --> 00:26:05.970
as long as we're talking
about branded content,

00:26:05.970 --> 00:26:07.636
just to be very clear
because we're only

00:26:07.636 --> 00:26:09.350
showing these little clips.

00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:12.460
One of the things,
especially with Ford,

00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:15.710
they specifically
did not want to be

00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:18.342
involved in the creative
element of this project.

00:26:18.342 --> 00:26:19.050
BEN ARTHUR: Yeah.

00:26:19.050 --> 00:26:20.910
It's important to
have that bright line.

00:26:20.910 --> 00:26:21.250
ROB REINHART: Yeah.

00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:23.010
They wanted to make
sure that-- they said,

00:26:23.010 --> 00:26:25.800
we do not-- we were working
out of a Ford C-MAX Energy,

00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:27.950
and they said, we don't
want songs about Ford.

00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:30.797
We don't want songs
about C-MAX and hybrids.

00:26:30.797 --> 00:26:32.380
BEN ARTHUR: They did
have one request.

00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:35.330
They didn't want any
songs about car accidents.

00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:37.194
They were--

00:26:37.194 --> 00:26:39.610
ROB REINHART: --or what might
happen in the back of a car.

00:26:39.610 --> 00:26:41.000
They just let's shy away, maybe.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.990
But really, all they
were interested in

00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:46.140
is that the creative process
would, at some point,

00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:49.370
involve being in the automobile.

00:26:49.370 --> 00:26:52.170
Well, if we were on a road trip,
we had to be in the automobile.

00:26:52.170 --> 00:26:53.920
So that was really great.

00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:56.090
I mean, I was pleasantly
surprised by that.

00:26:56.090 --> 00:26:59.380
I thought that they would
want a firmer hand in that.

00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:00.214
They wanted nothing.

00:27:00.214 --> 00:27:02.130
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Well,
and this whole thing

00:27:02.130 --> 00:27:03.700
raised a new
interesting challenge

00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:09.510
for you, Al and Mike, in that
a lot of the show-- not a lot

00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:12.150
of the show-- a fair amount of
the show takes place in a car.

00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:12.500
MICHAEL CREHORE: Right.

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:14.583
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: And
then, the rest of the show

00:27:14.583 --> 00:27:17.270
takes place that a car
can take you from or to,

00:27:17.270 --> 00:27:20.840
and rarely is that
a recording studio.

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:22.740
So how did that change
your whole approach

00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:25.170
to your involvement
in the project?

00:27:25.170 --> 00:27:28.720
ALAN HOUGHTON: Well, one, you
know, mundane, but big aspect,

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:30.780
was in a car, where
a lot of the dialogue

00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:32.530
between the songwriters
is taking place--

00:27:32.530 --> 00:27:34.946
as they're trying to brainstorm
the lyrics and stuff-- you

00:27:34.946 --> 00:27:36.030
have to record that.

00:27:36.030 --> 00:27:37.670
And get it clean.

00:27:37.670 --> 00:27:39.790
And it's hard in a moving car.

00:27:39.790 --> 00:27:41.910
A little car sounds funny.

00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:45.190
And it's hard to monitor
because there's only room

00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:46.440
for so many people in the car.

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:48.440
So you don't know what
you're recording, really.

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:51.519
So that was a whole learning
curve doing that thing.

00:27:51.519 --> 00:27:53.060
And then, of course,
you don't always

00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:55.250
know where you're going
to end up to record,

00:27:55.250 --> 00:27:58.180
depending on if you're in
Nashville, or LA, or Detroit,

00:27:58.180 --> 00:27:58.840
or whatever.

00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:02.750
So the other aspect is
the actual music recording

00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:05.120
of production with
whatever artist

00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:08.770
is, you know, online for
that thing the whole day.

00:28:08.770 --> 00:28:10.840
So that's another aspect of it.

00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:14.070
MICHAEL CREHORE: Yeah
we've been, and I think.

00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:16.830
It was interesting because
we got to the kind of decide

00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:19.505
depending on where
we were going to go.

00:28:19.505 --> 00:28:22.520
We were in Memphis
for one recording.

00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:24.776
We were in Austin for
another recording.

00:28:24.776 --> 00:28:27.090
We were in LA.

00:28:27.090 --> 00:28:29.940
We were in Woodstock, New
York, and we were in Detroit.

00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:34.410
So in Memphis, which
was the first recording,

00:28:34.410 --> 00:28:36.570
we got to work at
Sun Studios, which

00:28:36.570 --> 00:28:41.639
was this iconic studio,
which is now run as more of a

00:28:41.639 --> 00:28:42.430
BEN ARTHUR: Museum.

00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:43.480
MICHAEL CREHORE: Museum.

00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:46.680
But you can still rent it out
at night to do recordings.

00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:48.330
But when you record
there, you record

00:28:48.330 --> 00:28:49.810
the way they used to record.

00:28:49.810 --> 00:28:51.300
So it's an 8-track.

00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:52.384
BEN ARTHUR: No headphones.

00:28:52.384 --> 00:28:53.675
MICHAEL CREHORE: No headphones.

00:28:53.675 --> 00:28:54.710
All in the same room.

00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:56.490
All analog.

00:28:56.490 --> 00:29:00.090
So your, that's a
certain kind of sound.

00:29:00.090 --> 00:29:03.660
When we went to Boston,
we piggybacked on South

00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:08.590
by Southwest 2015 and did
a few artists in a condo.

00:29:08.590 --> 00:29:10.790
But then the artists that
we worked with on Songs

00:29:10.790 --> 00:29:15.570
on the Road, we did that
all kind of in a, you know,

00:29:15.570 --> 00:29:16.570
gorilla style.

00:29:16.570 --> 00:29:18.570
Ad hoc.

00:29:18.570 --> 00:29:20.730
But then in LA, we got
to go into the Village

00:29:20.730 --> 00:29:23.560
Recorders, which was an
amazing iconic studio.

00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:25.250
In Woodstock, we got
to work in a great

00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:26.791
BEN ARTHUR: Each
new place, you know,

00:29:26.791 --> 00:29:28.490
sort of brought a new thing.

00:29:28.490 --> 00:29:31.029
ALAN HOUGHTON: I mean, one of
the elements-- given the fact

00:29:31.029 --> 00:29:33.320
that we're on the road now,
we're moving from one place

00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:35.510
to another, and
cameras all around,

00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:39.580
and it's, how it's a little
more disconcerting for artists,

00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:43.650
especially the new, the featured
artists, who's never done this.

00:29:43.650 --> 00:29:45.440
So when we finally
did get to the studio,

00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:49.830
and we had to get a performance,
there was a lot more, hey,

00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:52.790
you know, this is--
trying to create

00:29:52.790 --> 00:29:57.500
an environment that's nurturing
and makes that able to happen.

00:29:57.500 --> 00:29:59.090
You know, even in
South by Southwest,

00:29:59.090 --> 00:30:01.320
where we had a-- we could
set up in our condo.

00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:02.419
And we had that set up.

00:30:02.419 --> 00:30:03.460
And people would come in.

00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:05.050
But it was a pretty
controlled environment,

00:30:05.050 --> 00:30:06.900
even though we just set
it up for that week.

00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:10.640
But in these situations, OK,
we're, here we are the studio.

00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:12.090
And at 3 o'clock, we're leaving.

00:30:12.090 --> 00:30:14.800
So we have to look around
and see what's going on,

00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:17.920
and what kind of talent we have,
and what the studio is like,

00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:19.900
and try to get the
best performance out

00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:22.262
of a very harried artist.

00:30:22.262 --> 00:30:23.720
BEN ARTHUR: Yeah,
at heart, there's

00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:27.070
a contradiction in the
show, which is to say,

00:30:27.070 --> 00:30:31.290
the excitement and the fear
is part of what is compelling

00:30:31.290 --> 00:30:32.383
and fun.

00:30:32.383 --> 00:30:36.120
You know, the tick, tick, tick
element adds to the stakes.

00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:39.060
But when it comes to actually
getting the song down--

00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:41.470
and writing it, for that
matter-- if the artist is

00:30:41.470 --> 00:30:45.417
freaking out, then you're
going to have a crappy song.

00:30:45.417 --> 00:30:47.500
MICHAEL CREHORE: And you're
ready for that moment,

00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:49.830
and all of a sudden
it's, hold on a second.

00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:52.780
Gotta get that
other camera angle.

00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:54.510
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Yeah.

00:30:54.510 --> 00:30:56.140
Al tends to take
on the role often

00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:59.000
of like the yogi in the
room keeping everybody calm,

00:30:59.000 --> 00:30:59.859
keeping the vibe.

00:30:59.859 --> 00:31:01.400
I just expect him,
one of these days,

00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:03.630
to walk in with like
sticks of incense.

00:31:03.630 --> 00:31:04.600
Don't worry.

00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:05.920
it's all going to be OK.

00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:07.430
BEN ARTHUR: Take one of these.

00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:08.888
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
I think we have

00:31:08.888 --> 00:31:11.360
a clip from the first
episode of our partnership.

00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:16.220
This features a Nashville
artist, Lera Lynn,

00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:18.429
who has recently seen some
success on True Detective.

00:31:18.429 --> 00:31:19.803
BEN ARTHUR: True
Detective, yeah.

00:31:19.803 --> 00:31:21.044
She starred in it.

00:31:21.044 --> 00:31:23.210
And they used a song that
she co-wrote with Roseanne

00:31:23.210 --> 00:31:25.490
Cash and T-Bone Burnett.

00:31:25.490 --> 00:31:27.860
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: And
next time, a song that she

00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:28.760
co-wrote with us.

00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:29.850
BEN ARTHUR: Yeah, totally.

00:31:29.850 --> 00:31:30.766
We're working on that.

00:31:30.766 --> 00:31:33.160
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: So if we
can show the Lera Lynn clip.

[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:31:33.826 --> 00:31:34.875
-I'm Lera Lynn.

00:31:34.875 --> 00:31:38.750
I am a singing songwriter
from Nashville, Tennessee.

00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:42.730
I have no anxiety
about writing the song,

00:31:42.730 --> 00:31:43.790
or recording the song.

00:31:43.790 --> 00:31:44.960
I'm really excited.

00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:47.376
I mean, that's what
this is all about,

00:31:47.376 --> 00:31:50.990
you know, to get to create
music and record it.

00:31:50.990 --> 00:31:52.860
That's the best
part of this job.

00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:55.830
-So I guess I was
wondering about home,

00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:58.630
you know, just as a sort
of starting off place.

00:31:58.630 --> 00:32:01.280
-So I pictured,
maybe, this couple

00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:05.540
lying together and
pretending that everything

00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:07.690
is going to be OK.

00:32:07.690 --> 00:32:09.170
Even though they're maybe,

00:32:09.170 --> 00:32:10.860
-Maybe it, maybe it's a breakup.

00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:12.460
It could potentially
be like a story

00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:15.360
about knowing that it was over.

00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:16.604
-Someone's been travelling.

00:32:16.604 --> 00:32:18.020
And they're coming
home to someone

00:32:18.020 --> 00:32:21.750
that they don't feel like
they're coming home to anymore.

00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:22.250
Right.

00:32:22.250 --> 00:32:22.750
I love it.

00:32:22.750 --> 00:32:23.250
-OK.

00:32:23.250 --> 00:32:23.970
-I love it.

00:32:23.970 --> 00:32:24.470
-OK.

00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:25.170
Write it.

00:32:25.170 --> 00:32:25.670
-OK.

00:32:25.670 --> 00:32:27.455
-I'm going to get some coffee.

00:32:27.455 --> 00:32:28.186
Just kidding.

[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:33:18.431 --> 00:33:20.347
MICHAEL CREHORE: Oh yeah,
we forgot about that

00:33:20.347 --> 00:33:20.880
until the last minute.

00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:21.790
Undeliverable.

00:33:21.790 --> 00:33:24.410
ROB REINHART: Al and Mike
talked about the fact

00:33:24.410 --> 00:33:26.620
that we did stop by
studios-- some really

00:33:26.620 --> 00:33:29.120
beautiful and iconic studios
over the course of this year--

00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:31.570
but each one of
these episodes also

00:33:31.570 --> 00:33:34.010
had to result in a
live performance done

00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:39.880
using the car as the PA for the
performance, which is, what you

00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:42.730
just saw there was a
performance we did in a very

00:33:42.730 --> 00:33:47.890
odd space in Memphis, where
we set up, and actually

00:33:47.890 --> 00:33:48.840
had a live audience.

00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:51.070
Each one of these
had live audiences.

00:33:51.070 --> 00:33:52.810
So there are about
33, 40 people that you

00:33:52.810 --> 00:33:56.410
didn't see in that
shot listening

00:33:56.410 --> 00:33:59.860
to that performance that was
then channeled through the car

00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:01.850
and recorded that way, right?

00:34:01.850 --> 00:34:02.720
Additional.

00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:04.525
BEN ARTHUR: Right.

00:34:04.525 --> 00:34:05.900
ALAN HOUGHTON: It
was a long day.

00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:07.400
BEN ARTHUR: It was
a long day, yeah.

00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:10.580
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: So we've--
this show continued to evolve.

00:34:10.580 --> 00:34:14.493
And we continued to get better
at it, I think, as we went on.

00:34:14.493 --> 00:34:15.909
Putting them
together, because now

00:34:15.909 --> 00:34:17.117
we're doing this whole thing.

00:34:17.117 --> 00:34:19.880
It's not just like an Ace
of Cakes reality show.

00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:21.790
There's this
performance element.

00:34:21.790 --> 00:34:23.929
So now we're
striking out, saying,

00:34:23.929 --> 00:34:26.120
hey we can do better than
American Idol at having

00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:26.940
live performances.

00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:30.230
We can do better than Ace of
Cakes than being, you know,

00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:33.199
entertaining, and
telling honest reality,

00:34:33.199 --> 00:34:35.549
instead of whatever that is.

00:34:35.549 --> 00:34:36.840
I don't even know what that is.

00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:38.506
BEN ARTHUR: The nice
thing is, you know,

00:34:38.506 --> 00:34:40.909
you can't eat the
cake when you watch

00:34:40.909 --> 00:34:42.040
one of these baking shows.

00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:44.010
But you actually
get to take the song

00:34:44.010 --> 00:34:47.244
and live with it separately
from the show, which

00:34:47.244 --> 00:34:49.199
I imagine is also delicious.

00:34:49.199 --> 00:34:51.214
I hope.

00:34:51.214 --> 00:34:53.380
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: So that
pretty much brings us up

00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:54.005
to the present.

00:34:54.005 --> 00:34:57.960
We published four episodes of
Songs to the Road this year.

00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:00.200
We have one more coming.

00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:03.990
And it puts us into
facing the next year.

00:35:03.990 --> 00:35:06.742
BEN ARTHUR: Well, there's
also the KCPT new.

00:35:06.742 --> 00:35:07.950
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Oh, yeah.

00:35:07.950 --> 00:35:09.160
Flashback.

00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:12.380
So remember the Steve Poltz
piece, the half-hour episode.

00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:13.130
BEN ARTHUR: Right.

00:35:13.130 --> 00:35:16.890
So KCPT PBS station
aired the show

00:35:16.890 --> 00:35:20.800
and called me a couple
weeks afterwards and said,

00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:24.720
hey, we'd like to put you
in for an Emmy nomination.

00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:26.860
And so I called everybody.

00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:28.940
I was like, that's OK, right?

00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:33.080
And to our delight, a
couple months later,

00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:37.120
we got a notification that we'd
been nominated for an Emmy.

00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:41.100
I went to the Emmys--
the mid-America Emmys

00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:46.380
is what these are called-- and
sadly, we lost to a documentary

00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:51.110
about the Rams'
cheerleaders photo shoot.

00:35:51.110 --> 00:35:52.230
No, it was the Rams.

00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:52.530
It was the Rams.

00:35:52.530 --> 00:35:52.920
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Was it?

00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:53.460
BEN ARTHUR: It was the Rams.

00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:54.670
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Aww,
it wasn't even a good team?

00:35:54.670 --> 00:35:55.990
BEN ARTHUR: Yeah.

00:35:55.990 --> 00:35:58.350
But there are certain
things that we can't compete

00:35:58.350 --> 00:35:59.930
with, you know what I'm saying?

00:35:59.930 --> 00:36:00.830
And

00:36:00.830 --> 00:36:01.220
ROB REINHART: Do our best.

00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:01.860
BEN ARTHUR: It's fair.

00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:02.360
It's fair.

00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:05.780
So anyway, but it actually
was an honor-- totally

00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:10.810
unexpected-- to be nominated
for our first half-hour show.

00:36:10.810 --> 00:36:13.560
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
So facing that.

00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:16.000
Emmy nominations, brands
bigger than it's been,

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.110
viewcounts are higher
than they've been.

00:36:18.110 --> 00:36:22.230
We've continued our, you
know, thankfully, touch wood,

00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:24.020
continued our path of growth.

00:36:24.020 --> 00:36:27.430
Where does that put us now,
facing into the next year?

00:36:27.430 --> 00:36:30.040
BEN ARTHUR: Well, we
have one more episode

00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:33.010
of The Songs of the Road to
launch in the next couple

00:36:33.010 --> 00:36:34.030
weeks.

00:36:34.030 --> 00:36:38.170
And then, hopefully
we can figure out

00:36:38.170 --> 00:36:41.010
a way to continue to grow.

00:36:41.010 --> 00:36:43.800
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: What do you
think-- we do want to show you

00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:44.790
guys one more clip.

00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:47.717
And it is a sneak peak of the
episode that has not yet aired.

00:36:47.717 --> 00:36:48.800
So we're going to do that.

00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:50.740
And afterwards, we
want to take Q&amp;A.

00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:52.280
If anybody has any
questions, there

00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:54.390
are Q&amp;A mikes in
the aisles, please.

00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:59.080
We'd love to chat with
you guys about this stuff.

00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:01.440
If there's one thing that you
could sum up and take away

00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:04.730
from the past what is
now six years of working

00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:08.030
on this project for some
of us, like what do you--

00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:08.780
what do you think?

00:37:12.770 --> 00:37:14.269
Stumped him with that.

00:37:14.269 --> 00:37:15.810
BEN ARTHUR: It's an
exciting project.

00:37:15.810 --> 00:37:16.320
It's fun.

00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:20.270
And I, you know, as
long as the process

00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:25.540
itself continues to be
as exciting, and weird,

00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:28.587
and frightening, as
this is, and as long

00:37:28.587 --> 00:37:30.045
as we continue--
I mean, it really,

00:37:30.045 --> 00:37:31.750
it comes down to the art, right?

00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:37.110
So if we do it, if we make a
cake-- to go back to the cake

00:37:37.110 --> 00:37:41.130
metaphor-- that people
take home and, you know,

00:37:41.130 --> 00:37:48.580
listen to cake listeningwise,
and it's rotten,

00:37:48.580 --> 00:37:49.850
then we failed.

00:37:49.850 --> 00:37:52.290
At heart, it's a fun challenge.

00:37:52.290 --> 00:37:54.970
But if the art itself
isn't the center,

00:37:54.970 --> 00:37:57.520
doesn't hold that center,
then it doesn't work.

00:37:57.520 --> 00:37:59.840
And it doesn't work, I
think, internally for us too.

00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:05.260
The art has to have a life,
and to lift up, and feel

00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:07.760
like, yeah, that's a good song.

00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:10.750
Beyond just the
time limit, I think

00:38:10.750 --> 00:38:13.190
as long as that
continues to hold true,

00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:15.070
we're going to keep doing it.

00:38:15.070 --> 00:38:17.930
ALAN HOUGHTON: Yeah, it's
an interesting-- it was not

00:38:17.930 --> 00:38:21.960
a quandary, but it was an issue
to confront early on, given

00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:25.180
all the reality TV
that's out there,

00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:30.080
is you do have this tense
situation that can, you know,

00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:31.420
it can go south.

00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:34.290
With throwing in the
wrong flavors when--

00:38:34.290 --> 00:38:35.571
BEN ARTHUR: --of the cake.

00:38:35.571 --> 00:38:37.120
ALAN HOUGHTON: Of the cake, yes.

00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:38.050
ROB REINHART: The song cake.

00:38:38.050 --> 00:38:40.008
BEN ARTHUR: I never should
have mentioned cake.

00:38:40.008 --> 00:38:42.674
ALAN HOUGHTON: Yeah, the
artists can not get it together,

00:38:42.674 --> 00:38:43.840
some of them can have a fit.

00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:47.270
You can, it doesn't take
much to blow that vibe.

00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:50.864
And a TV producer
could even argue,

00:38:50.864 --> 00:38:52.780
you know, yeah, let's
screw it up a little bit

00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:55.300
and have some drama, and who
cares if the song-- you know,

00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:57.301
if the artist storms out
the door, that's great.

00:38:57.301 --> 00:38:58.550
That's what we're looking for.

00:38:58.550 --> 00:38:59.480
That's perfect.

00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:03.340
But we, you know, we made a
conscious decision, that's

00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:04.819
not what we're going to do.

00:39:04.819 --> 00:39:07.110
We are actually going to end
up with a really good song

00:39:07.110 --> 00:39:07.840
at the end.

00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:09.760
And one of the
things that's really

00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:12.399
heartening about the show--
and it's a surprise to me,

00:39:12.399 --> 00:39:13.940
and probably everybody
a little bit--

00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:16.860
is given all the
random elements,

00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:18.620
and everything that
goes into this,

00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:22.929
is how resourceful people are.

00:39:22.929 --> 00:39:24.220
We're not a big team, you know.

00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:25.800
And we pull off
a show like this.

00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:28.980
But also the artists
who are featured

00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:31.730
bring everything to bear in
a super short amount of time

00:39:31.730 --> 00:39:35.330
and create what've been
really great songs.

00:39:35.330 --> 00:39:36.507
It's probably startling.

00:39:36.507 --> 00:39:38.131
MICHAEL CREHORE: Rob
and I were talking

00:39:38.131 --> 00:39:39.640
about that the other day.

00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:42.790
Because we-- for this
talk we kind of went back

00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:46.220
through the archives and
Matthew had mentioned,

00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:48.410
do we have all the
music in one place?

00:39:48.410 --> 00:39:50.981
And I said, oh yeah, we
should, we should do that.

00:39:50.981 --> 00:39:52.480
So I put all the
music in one place.

00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:54.670
And, you know, we've
got about 20 songs now

00:39:54.670 --> 00:39:58.480
that we've written over
the past few years.

00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:03.150
And they all hold up as--
individually and collectively--

00:40:03.150 --> 00:40:09.860
as really nice songs
and it's enjoyable.

00:40:09.860 --> 00:40:11.730
ROB REINHART:
Acoustic Cafe-- this

00:40:11.730 --> 00:40:13.560
is what that program is about.

00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:15.340
It's about song craft.

00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:18.160
Not this song craft,
but it's about the craft

00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:19.530
of making songs.

00:40:19.530 --> 00:40:20.780
So I listen to a lot of songs.

00:40:20.780 --> 00:40:23.190
So 21 years down
the road, what I

00:40:23.190 --> 00:40:26.520
can say about this project
which has been so gratifying

00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:29.170
is that there is no template.

00:40:29.170 --> 00:40:31.500
Every one of these
situations is different.

00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:36.440
I kept thinking that
we'd get into a pattern.

00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:38.860
And the pattern, we would then
go and execute the pattern.

00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:41.970
What's great, what's
refreshing, what's fun

00:40:41.970 --> 00:40:43.780
is that there is no pattern.

00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:45.810
Every one of these,
I think everyone's

00:40:45.810 --> 00:40:48.600
about to become a
spectacular failure.

00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:49.880
BEN ARTHUR: It is.

00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:51.170
It absolutely is.

00:40:51.170 --> 00:40:52.830
ROB REINHART: And
then it's awesome.

00:40:52.830 --> 00:40:53.700
And it's great.

00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:55.527
One of, one of
these days it may.

00:40:55.527 --> 00:40:57.610
BEN ARTHUR: I thought, I
would have put money down

00:40:57.610 --> 00:40:59.734
that we would have crashed
into a wall before this.

00:40:59.734 --> 00:41:01.070
I absolutely would have.

00:41:01.070 --> 00:41:02.986
ROB REINHART: And this
new one, you know what?

00:41:02.986 --> 00:41:04.670
I am, so every one,
I'm just thrilled

00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:06.870
to get to the next
one, to be able to do

00:41:06.870 --> 00:41:08.964
the segment for
the radio program,

00:41:08.964 --> 00:41:11.460
put it out there on the 100
affiliates that we have,

00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:14.060
and get it heard in the world.

00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:15.860
This new one, I can't wait.

00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:16.890
December 7.

00:41:16.890 --> 00:41:17.890
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Yup.

00:41:17.890 --> 00:41:21.760
December 7 the last episode of
this year's Songs of the Road

00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:23.060
will to air.

00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:24.560
It publishes on YouTube.

00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:28.270
We use the YouTube network
to publish these things,

00:41:28.270 --> 00:41:30.970
and to share them out, and
to make them available.

00:41:30.970 --> 00:41:33.040
And I can say,
from my standpoint

00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:35.970
as the director and
editor of these things

00:41:35.970 --> 00:41:39.040
to put it together, it's always
been very important to me

00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:40.770
to be honest in
our storytelling,

00:41:40.770 --> 00:41:45.590
and to show you what is more
a documentary of the story

00:41:45.590 --> 00:41:48.180
unfolding, rather than
to try to manhandle,

00:41:48.180 --> 00:41:51.180
and manipulate, and go
that route of reality TV.

00:41:51.180 --> 00:41:53.780
I think a lot of
those shows, they

00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:56.550
focus-- even on, not even one
when it's the task at hand.

00:41:56.550 --> 00:41:59.100
You know, they want the
bickering, and the argument

00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:01.310
on the side, and
whatever the show's about

00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:03.180
is actually only
a couple minutes.

00:42:03.180 --> 00:42:08.970
And instead, we've tried to
put forward an honest telling

00:42:08.970 --> 00:42:10.600
of hey, this is what went down.

00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:13.207
And I think it shows
a glimpse into a world

00:42:13.207 --> 00:42:14.790
that a lot of people
don't get to see.

00:42:14.790 --> 00:42:16.498
Unless you're in that
room, unless you're

00:42:16.498 --> 00:42:18.990
one of the people writing
that song, in a normal world

00:42:18.990 --> 00:42:20.470
you would never get access.

00:42:20.470 --> 00:42:23.260
BEN ARTHUR: Yeah, and that's
a funny thing about artists

00:42:23.260 --> 00:42:26.800
is that I think a
lot of us really

00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:32.051
love that creative thing that
is largely a private affair,

00:42:32.051 --> 00:42:32.550
you know?

00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:36.600
Like, except for opportunities
like this, for the most part

00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:37.605
it's done away.

00:42:37.605 --> 00:42:39.980
But it's one of the things
that I get a huge kick out of,

00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:42.760
and I think a lot of artists
get a huge kick out of.

00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:45.240
And sort of opening
up the window on that,

00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:48.500
and sharing that
true fear and joy

00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:50.250
is one of the great
pleasures of the show.

00:42:50.250 --> 00:42:51.791
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
Well, and there's

00:42:51.791 --> 00:42:54.000
a lot of stuff to be learned,
I think, about it too.

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:57.122
No artists have
worked the same way.

00:42:57.122 --> 00:42:58.330
Some want to do lyrics first.

00:42:58.330 --> 00:42:59.610
Some want to do music first.

00:42:59.610 --> 00:43:02.120
And then, we haven't ever
really recorded it the same way.

00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:03.971
So even if you're into
that stuff, you can--

00:43:03.971 --> 00:43:05.470
ROB REINHART: Yeah,
every single one

00:43:05.470 --> 00:43:08.530
has been completely different.

00:43:08.530 --> 00:43:10.742
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: So we
will give you a sneak peak

00:43:10.742 --> 00:43:12.290
of this last little clip.

00:43:12.290 --> 00:43:15.460
This features a very
talented artist.

00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:18.990
My Brightest Diamond, Shara
Worden, who is from Detroit.

00:43:18.990 --> 00:43:20.530
And we went to Detroit to do it.

00:43:20.530 --> 00:43:22.244
And it was quite an event.

00:43:22.244 --> 00:43:23.910
BEN ARTHUR: Yeah, and
a brand new style.

00:43:23.910 --> 00:43:28.450
She wanted to write something
and have a DJ manipulate

00:43:28.450 --> 00:43:31.860
the pieces and
then sort of start

00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:34.650
from that thing which
she hadn't yet heard,

00:43:34.650 --> 00:43:37.320
which we had never tried before,
and we'd never worked with a DJ

00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:38.440
before.

00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:42.560
And she also wanted a
horn section, so it was.

00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:44.210
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
Upping the ante.

00:43:44.210 --> 00:43:47.204
Here's a little tease
of the upcoming episode.

00:43:47.204 --> 00:43:48.009
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:43:48.009 --> 00:43:50.300
-Raise your hand if you're
ready to go perform it live.

00:43:54.580 --> 00:43:56.544
The show, The Eastern
Market is leaving.

00:43:56.544 --> 00:43:57.043
All right.

00:43:57.043 --> 00:43:57.970
Who's driving it?

00:43:57.970 --> 00:43:58.510
-Have fun.

00:43:58.510 --> 00:44:00.370
Listen, I'll go.

00:44:00.370 --> 00:44:01.150
-OK.

00:44:01.150 --> 00:44:03.270
I personally feel like
the live performance

00:44:03.270 --> 00:44:04.950
is going to be great.

00:44:04.950 --> 00:44:07.750
-Wiz is going to do this
all live and take that risk

00:44:07.750 --> 00:44:10.450
because that brings her to
a new level of performance.

00:44:10.450 --> 00:44:15.640
-The most important thing
for me in a live experience

00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:19.600
is feeling, feeling,
feeling, feeling, feeling.

00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:21.510
It's a really hard part to sing.

00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:24.380
And I've never sang without
a guitar in front of me.

00:44:24.380 --> 00:44:26.610
I may actually just
hold it in front of me

00:44:26.610 --> 00:44:27.910
like a security blanket.

00:44:27.910 --> 00:44:29.580
And I've never sang
anything this high.

00:44:33.029 --> 00:44:34.570
We've never had an
audience this big.

00:44:34.570 --> 00:44:37.216
And it's Rob's hometown.

00:44:37.216 --> 00:44:40.105
And it's yeah, some pressure.

00:44:40.105 --> 00:44:42.230
-The performance is going
to be the very first time

00:44:42.230 --> 00:44:45.450
that all six of us
are playing this song.

00:44:45.450 --> 00:44:49.000
Together, first time,
in front of people.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:51.322
We are definitely
working without a net.

00:44:54.214 --> 00:44:54.798
[END PLAYBACK]

00:44:54.798 --> 00:44:56.630
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: So
I encourage you guys.

00:44:56.630 --> 00:44:59.185
December 7 that'll be available
on our YouTube channel, Song

00:44:59.185 --> 00:45:00.300
Craft Presents.

00:45:00.300 --> 00:45:03.045
And guys, anything you want
to say before we open up

00:45:03.045 --> 00:45:04.460
for questions?

00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:06.126
ROB REINHART: Thank
you for taking time.

00:45:06.126 --> 00:45:08.185
BEN ARTHUR: Yeah,
thanks for having us.

00:45:08.185 --> 00:45:10.560
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Happily,
if anyone has any questions?

00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:10.960
AUDIENCE: Hi, guys.

00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:11.500
I'm Lauren.

00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:12.690
Thank you for coming.

00:45:12.690 --> 00:45:14.232
I love your project.

00:45:14.232 --> 00:45:15.190
I had a quick question.

00:45:15.190 --> 00:45:18.864
I wondered how'd you guys find
your talent and the artist

00:45:18.864 --> 00:45:19.780
in each of the cities?

00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:27.150
ROB REINHART: Well, we
sort of crafted lists.

00:45:27.150 --> 00:45:30.270
I mean, I'm sort of,
for the radio program,

00:45:30.270 --> 00:45:32.870
I'm in touch with a
lot of just people.

00:45:32.870 --> 00:45:35.350
And when we knew we were going
to be in a particular place,

00:45:35.350 --> 00:45:38.530
they weren't necessarily
artists from that city.

00:45:38.530 --> 00:45:41.290
In a couple of cases,
we had that happen.

00:45:41.290 --> 00:45:43.580
And then, in others,
you know, people

00:45:43.580 --> 00:45:45.440
were just going to be
at South by Southwest.

00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:49.080
And if they were going to be
there, we would bring them,

00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:50.800
you know, we would
extend the invitation.

00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:53.470
A lot of artists--
you know, the key

00:45:53.470 --> 00:45:57.346
was finding an artist where this
project would work for them.

00:45:57.346 --> 00:45:58.720
We had a lot of
artists who said,

00:45:58.720 --> 00:46:00.178
boy, that sounds
like a lot of fun,

00:46:00.178 --> 00:46:02.330
but I would be
terrified to do that.

00:46:02.330 --> 00:46:03.210
I can't do it.

00:46:03.210 --> 00:46:05.820
So a lot of people
just turned us down.

00:46:05.820 --> 00:46:09.260
BEN ARTHUR: Aesop Rock-- Aesop
Rock is a friend of Wiz's-- DJ

00:46:09.260 --> 00:46:12.000
Wiz-- and I asked
him to ask Ace.

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.150
And Ace emailed
back and was like,

00:46:14.150 --> 00:46:17.101
I would never stop throwing up.

00:46:17.101 --> 00:46:19.114
So it's out of the question.

00:46:19.114 --> 00:46:20.780
MICHAEL CREHORE: And
one of our artists,

00:46:20.780 --> 00:46:23.740
David Mayfield, who
was he was Nashville

00:46:23.740 --> 00:46:28.540
based for a long time, he's
now back in his native Ohio.

00:46:28.540 --> 00:46:31.544
We actually recorded
him in Los Angeles.

00:46:31.544 --> 00:46:33.960
So we had-- it was a different
kind of a road experience--

00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:38.580
but the interesting thing was
we rented an Airbnb which turned

00:46:38.580 --> 00:46:40.056
out to be Roger Miller's house.

00:46:40.056 --> 00:46:41.680
And Roger Miller
wrote King of the Road

00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:44.110
and a bunch of other great hits.

00:46:44.110 --> 00:46:47.959
And Roger Miller, as I'm driving
around with David Mayfield,

00:46:47.959 --> 00:46:50.250
I said, you know, we're
staying at Roger Miller's house

00:46:50.250 --> 00:46:50.750
tonight?

00:46:50.750 --> 00:46:52.880
And he just, he
completely broke down.

00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:55.550
Roger Miller was
his boyhood hero,

00:46:55.550 --> 00:46:58.170
as a singer,
songwriter, entertainer.

00:46:58.170 --> 00:47:01.940
And so it was just this
weird confluence of events

00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:03.840
that we were staying in
Roger Miller's house,

00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:06.380
we're going to be working
in Roger Miller's house

00:47:06.380 --> 00:47:07.500
ROB REINHART: With
an artist from Ohio.

00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:09.250
MICHAEL CREHORE: With
an artist from Ohio,

00:47:09.250 --> 00:47:10.180
who that was his hero.

00:47:10.180 --> 00:47:12.290
So it's kind of an
interesting thing.

00:47:12.290 --> 00:47:15.640
BEN ARTHUR: To get, to
drill in a little more.

00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:18.140
Rob's show-- he doesn't
mention this often.

00:47:18.140 --> 00:47:20.140
But Rob's show airs for
something like 2 and 1/2

00:47:20.140 --> 00:47:21.500
million people a week.

00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:24.430
So he gets pitched
every artist who

00:47:24.430 --> 00:47:30.340
has music within the range
of stuff Acoustic Cafe plays.

00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:35.620
So he's, you know, very
in touch with what's

00:47:35.620 --> 00:47:36.650
out there in the world.

00:47:36.650 --> 00:47:41.400
And so that, plus all of
our collective fandoms

00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:44.730
of various people,
and I think all of us

00:47:44.730 --> 00:47:47.300
have at various points pitched
people that we were just like,

00:47:47.300 --> 00:47:49.050
oh, man, I love her.

00:47:49.050 --> 00:47:49.870
She's amazing.

00:47:49.870 --> 00:47:51.240
We need to get her on the show.

00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:53.149
And sometimes it
works scheduling-wise,

00:47:53.149 --> 00:47:54.190
and sometimes it doesn't.

00:47:54.190 --> 00:47:57.940
Sometimes it works as far as
the fear-- vomiting-- factor.

00:47:57.940 --> 00:47:59.110
And sometimes it doesn't.

00:47:59.110 --> 00:48:00.834
But every once in
awhile, we get,

00:48:00.834 --> 00:48:02.250
you know, the
people that we want.

00:48:02.250 --> 00:48:04.100
And it's a real thrill.

00:48:04.100 --> 00:48:07.060
ROB REINHART: And we also
wanted to allow the artist

00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:10.620
to help to, you know,
design the trip.

00:48:10.620 --> 00:48:14.360
So, what would inspire you
to create something great?

00:48:14.360 --> 00:48:16.929
So with Lera Lynn, she's
like, well-- you know,

00:48:16.929 --> 00:48:19.470
you know, within a three hour
road trip, that kind of thing--

00:48:19.470 --> 00:48:20.890
she said, well, why
don't we go to Memphis?

00:48:20.890 --> 00:48:23.310
And then, the whole thought
of going to Sun Studios

00:48:23.310 --> 00:48:26.600
was a real thrill for her.

00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:28.470
Yeah, I mean, so, you
know, we wanted people

00:48:28.470 --> 00:48:30.610
to-- Shara Worden,
obviously she wanted

00:48:30.610 --> 00:48:34.380
to do kind of a love letter
to Detroit in Detroit.

00:48:34.380 --> 00:48:35.710
We opened it up to her.

00:48:35.710 --> 00:48:37.680
We said, we can go
anywhere you want to go.

00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:38.980
And she said, I want
to stay in Detroit.

00:48:38.980 --> 00:48:39.896
I want to do it there.

00:48:39.896 --> 00:48:42.440
So that was another
part that went

00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:44.180
into the selection,
where they wanted,

00:48:44.180 --> 00:48:45.776
what would inspire
them the most.

00:48:45.776 --> 00:48:47.650
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
Thanks for your question.

00:48:47.650 --> 00:48:49.610
BEN ARTHUR: Thanks.

00:48:49.610 --> 00:48:52.790
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Any
additional questions?

00:48:52.790 --> 00:48:54.020
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:48:54.020 --> 00:48:56.200
Yeah, I've got lots of
questions, but I guess

00:48:56.200 --> 00:48:56.860
BEN ARTHUR: Hit us
with all of them.

00:48:56.860 --> 00:48:57.693
We'll take them all.

00:48:57.693 --> 00:48:59.810
AUDIENCE: The one that
I'm kind of curious

00:48:59.810 --> 00:49:03.810
about it is just about
those choking points,

00:49:03.810 --> 00:49:06.140
when people like
just realize I don't

00:49:06.140 --> 00:49:08.430
think we can do this in
time, or anything like that.

00:49:08.430 --> 00:49:13.510
Have you actually had to extend
the clock for people in order

00:49:13.510 --> 00:49:14.700
to get something done?

00:49:14.700 --> 00:49:15.659
BEN ARTHUR: Not really.

00:49:15.659 --> 00:49:16.950
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: It's funny.

00:49:16.950 --> 00:49:19.180
We've actually had to turn
the screws on bringing

00:49:19.180 --> 00:49:21.040
certain things to a close.

00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:25.290
With the sneak peek
episode-- the new one that

00:49:25.290 --> 00:49:27.670
will come out-- there
was a point where

00:49:27.670 --> 00:49:30.190
I was kind of running around
the studios we're recording

00:49:30.190 --> 00:49:31.930
in saying, guys, it's time.

00:49:31.930 --> 00:49:32.430
We gotta go.

00:49:32.430 --> 00:49:32.930
We gotta go.

00:49:32.930 --> 00:49:33.790
We gotta go.

00:49:33.790 --> 00:49:36.984
And they still wanted
to do more vocal takes.

00:49:36.984 --> 00:49:38.400
You saw them sitting
in the booth.

00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:39.740
BEN ARTHUR: I was trying.

00:49:39.740 --> 00:49:42.130
So, you know, what
usually happens

00:49:42.130 --> 00:49:45.300
is we talk to an artist,
and they're like, well,

00:49:45.300 --> 00:49:47.992
how long would I need to,
you know, maybe the manager,

00:49:47.992 --> 00:49:49.950
how long would the artist
need to be available?

00:49:49.950 --> 00:49:52.960
We can only give you
three hours, or whatever.

00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:59.210
We say now that we've learned,
we'll ask of you three hours.

00:49:59.210 --> 00:50:02.050
But give us an extra
two hours on the end

00:50:02.050 --> 00:50:05.110
because your artist will want
to spend more time doing this.

00:50:05.110 --> 00:50:09.100
Your artist will not be happy
with, you know, the bridge,

00:50:09.100 --> 00:50:10.202
or with the vocal.

00:50:10.202 --> 00:50:11.660
And they will want
to keep playing.

00:50:11.660 --> 00:50:13.950
Because really it's
genuinely a joy.

00:50:13.950 --> 00:50:16.540
AUDIENCE: Is it mostly-- is
the time extension mostly then

00:50:16.540 --> 00:50:18.460
for sort of
production type stuff?

00:50:18.460 --> 00:50:21.130
Like at that point, you've
got lyrics, and melody,

00:50:21.130 --> 00:50:22.540
and all that stuff down?

00:50:22.540 --> 00:50:23.870
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Yeah,
I think that's fair.

00:50:23.870 --> 00:50:25.578
MICHAEL CREHORE: I
don't think we've ever

00:50:25.578 --> 00:50:29.130
come up to the end of the
clock and not had the song.

00:50:29.130 --> 00:50:32.950
The song seems to come together,
and I think most of that

00:50:32.950 --> 00:50:33.760
has to do with Ben.

00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:36.070
Bend is a really
great facilitator

00:50:36.070 --> 00:50:37.660
in the songwriting process.

00:50:37.660 --> 00:50:38.875
BEN ARTHUR: Thanks.

00:50:38.875 --> 00:50:40.166
MICHAEL CREHORE: And it's true.

00:50:40.166 --> 00:50:44.360
He'll, he'll, you know,
whatever they're going through,

00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:46.160
you know, it'll get to a point.

00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:48.990
And he'll bring it to a close.

00:50:48.990 --> 00:50:50.862
Sometimes he's used
the process of,

00:50:50.862 --> 00:50:52.070
let's go into separate rooms.

00:50:52.070 --> 00:50:52.820
You bring a verse.

00:50:52.820 --> 00:50:53.710
I'll bring a verse.

00:50:53.710 --> 00:50:56.632
And sometimes they just
hit it off right away.

00:50:56.632 --> 00:50:58.090
BEN ARTHUR: It's
actually something

00:50:58.090 --> 00:51:02.890
that-- Matthew's encouraged
me to slow down a little bit.

00:51:02.890 --> 00:51:07.770
Because the fear gets into me
too, even after all this time.

00:51:07.770 --> 00:51:11.920
And I'll push into
territory that, you know,

00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:14.780
maybe if I gave a little
more space the artist,

00:51:14.780 --> 00:51:17.280
they'd-- you know, because
you see the sort of blank

00:51:17.280 --> 00:51:18.340
expression.

00:51:18.340 --> 00:51:22.540
And so I will, out of
empathy, if nothing else,

00:51:22.540 --> 00:51:23.730
try to rush in.

00:51:23.730 --> 00:51:26.260
And Matthew has been
very good about reminding

00:51:26.260 --> 00:51:29.330
me to, you know, like
a good psychoanalyst,

00:51:29.330 --> 00:51:31.140
let it hang a little bit.

00:51:31.140 --> 00:51:35.720
And see if that space, they'll
come in and fill that space.

00:51:35.720 --> 00:51:40.210
So the creatively, almost
never that I recall,

00:51:40.210 --> 00:51:45.000
Ben Sollee and Erin McKeown took
a little bit longer than some.

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:46.910
But usually it's a production.

00:51:46.910 --> 00:51:48.440
The artist wants
to keep polishing.

00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:49.100
AUDIENCE: Of course.

00:51:49.100 --> 00:51:50.010
I could see where
that would be--

00:51:50.010 --> 00:51:52.259
MICHAEL CREHORE: The thing
that important for Al and I

00:51:52.259 --> 00:51:55.590
is, I think, is to get a
performance of the vocal.

00:51:55.590 --> 00:51:58.120
Because at the end of
the day, we may not--

00:51:58.120 --> 00:52:01.800
you know, if we get
that lead performance,

00:52:01.800 --> 00:52:03.880
one that we know
we can work with.

00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:07.610
We're not big proponents of
tuning, and moving things

00:52:07.610 --> 00:52:09.290
around, and making
everything perfect.

00:52:09.290 --> 00:52:10.882
We're a little more old school.

00:52:10.882 --> 00:52:13.090
So we want to make sure that
performance is something

00:52:13.090 --> 00:52:14.760
that we can then
build a track around.

00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:17.780
And in some cases, we
worked with A.J. Croce

00:52:17.780 --> 00:52:21.030
down in the South by Southwest.

00:52:21.030 --> 00:52:23.220
And we really couldn't
do anything to his track.

00:52:23.220 --> 00:52:23.510
BEN ARTHUR: He asked us to.

00:52:23.510 --> 00:52:25.468
MICHAEL CREHORE: It was
such a beautiful, yeah,

00:52:25.468 --> 00:52:27.810
it was such a beautiful
performance of the vocal,

00:52:27.810 --> 00:52:30.050
and the guitar--
acoustic guitar--

00:52:30.050 --> 00:52:32.070
that we didn't
want to produce it.

00:52:32.070 --> 00:52:34.761
We started to produce it,
and we went, you know what?

00:52:34.761 --> 00:52:35.260
This is

00:52:35.260 --> 00:52:37.100
AUDIENCE: That was the one
we saw initially there?

00:52:37.100 --> 00:52:37.820
BEN ARTHUR: No.

00:52:37.820 --> 00:52:39.420
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: No
you'll have to go online

00:52:39.420 --> 00:52:41.170
MICHAEL CREHORE: --to
go online to see it.

00:52:41.170 --> 00:52:44.720
But it's just a really, you
know, that was all it needed.

00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:46.907
And for some of the
others, we produced them.

00:52:46.907 --> 00:52:49.240
Brought them up a little bit
with either drums, or bass,

00:52:49.240 --> 00:52:51.190
or some extra guitars,
or some keyboards,

00:52:51.190 --> 00:52:54.565
but it's just really getting
that vocal, you know?

00:52:54.565 --> 00:52:56.190
ALAN HOUGHTON: Yeah,
and to your point,

00:52:56.190 --> 00:52:59.600
these songwriters
are professional.

00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:00.370
You know?

00:53:00.370 --> 00:53:02.560
If you say, you know, 3
o'clock, we have to go.

00:53:02.560 --> 00:53:03.490
Because we have
to be at the place

00:53:03.490 --> 00:53:05.698
where you're actually going
to sing the song in front

00:53:05.698 --> 00:53:07.960
of 40 people, you know,
they don't ignore that.

00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:08.550
You know.

00:53:08.550 --> 00:53:11.090
So everyone's working
to make it happen.

00:53:11.090 --> 00:53:13.420
And maybe, yeah, it'd great
to have 15 extra minutes,

00:53:13.420 --> 00:53:14.540
but sometimes you don't.

00:53:14.540 --> 00:53:15.040
You know?

00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:16.622
And you just go
with what you got.

00:53:16.622 --> 00:53:18.830
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT: Also
from a technical standpoint,

00:53:18.830 --> 00:53:21.524
and I think this applies
a bit to Mike and Al

00:53:21.524 --> 00:53:22.940
as well, but
definitely from where

00:53:22.940 --> 00:53:25.040
I'm coming from
from the video side,

00:53:25.040 --> 00:53:27.580
is that we're essentially
there to document.

00:53:27.580 --> 00:53:30.855
So we definitely don't
want to be pushing it

00:53:30.855 --> 00:53:33.180
in any certain way to
try and-- because then we

00:53:33.180 --> 00:53:36.085
fall into that, just like
any other reality TV show,

00:53:36.085 --> 00:53:38.210
and we're not telling you
the honest story anymore.

00:53:38.210 --> 00:53:40.135
So one of the mottos
on the set all the time

00:53:40.135 --> 00:53:41.210
is, default to reality.

00:53:41.210 --> 00:53:42.340
What's really going on?

00:53:42.340 --> 00:53:43.730
What can we really do?

00:53:43.730 --> 00:53:45.980
And any times when we've
come to the wire, where we've

00:53:45.980 --> 00:53:48.360
had to be like, we don't
have any more time,

00:53:48.360 --> 00:53:51.380
it's because the live
performance is scheduled.

00:53:51.380 --> 00:53:54.000
And people, the audience
is starting to show up.

00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:56.390
And they're like, well,
are they going to show up?

00:53:56.390 --> 00:53:57.473
Are they going to perform?

00:53:57.473 --> 00:54:01.050
So a lot of that is reality
setting that timeline versus us

00:54:01.050 --> 00:54:03.931
trying to manipulate the story.

00:54:03.931 --> 00:54:06.430
And I think that's true a little
bit with the songs as well.

00:54:06.430 --> 00:54:09.254
You guys are just documenting
those beautiful moments,

00:54:09.254 --> 00:54:11.170
and then, you know,
touching it where you can.

00:54:11.170 --> 00:54:13.086
MICHAEL CREHORE: Yeah,
we're not-- we're not--

00:54:13.086 --> 00:54:14.960
very light-handed production.

00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:17.070
BEN ARTHUR: And as per
the artist's instruction.

00:54:17.070 --> 00:54:19.550
Essentially, at the end of
a recording session, we say,

00:54:19.550 --> 00:54:23.520
is there anything you
want us to augment or add?

00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:26.140
And then, depending
on what they want,

00:54:26.140 --> 00:54:28.560
we'll do that, send it to
them, and say, this is right?

00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:31.250
And sometimes it is,
sometimes it isn't.

00:54:31.250 --> 00:54:32.850
And then, and then, move on.

00:54:32.850 --> 00:54:33.820
Because at the end
of the day, we're

00:54:33.820 --> 00:54:35.090
serving that artist's vision.

00:54:35.090 --> 00:54:36.980
And if the song doesn't
sound like the artist

00:54:36.980 --> 00:54:39.020
and doesn't sound natural,
like that's not going

00:54:39.020 --> 00:54:41.460
to be good for us or them.

00:54:41.460 --> 00:54:44.364
AUDIENCE: Well, thanks, you
answered a lot of questions.

00:54:44.364 --> 00:54:45.780
ROB REINHART: Thank
you very much.

00:54:45.780 --> 00:54:46.440
MATTHEW HENDERSHOT:
Unfortunately, we're

00:54:46.440 --> 00:54:48.260
out of time, or we'd
take a couple more.

00:54:48.260 --> 00:54:51.444
If you guys do want to see the
full episodes of the shows,

00:54:51.444 --> 00:54:52.860
and everything
we've done out, you

00:54:52.860 --> 00:54:56.520

or go straight to the source,

00:54:56.520 --> 00:54:59.264

00:54:59.264 --> 00:55:01.180
Thank you guys for taking
the time to join me.

00:55:01.180 --> 00:55:02.110
Thank you as an audience.

00:55:02.110 --> 00:55:02.790
ROB REINHART: Thank you.

00:55:02.790 --> 00:55:03.410
