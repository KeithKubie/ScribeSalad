Speaker 1:          00:06          Like a boss.

New Speaker:        00:06          And I saw this thing called Ovarian psychos and I was like, I want, I want, I got it. Well, I gotta see what this is about. It was about some, uh, some women in east la, mainly Mexican, who are sick of fucking being scared women and they started their own group when they ride around these women's only, um, you know, riding bicycles when there's like a full moon or some shit, I dunno. Ovarian cycles is a young woman of color, a bicycle brigade. It's a refuge for the runaway, for the away

Speaker 2:          00:43          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:43          the majority of us, if not all of us have some kind of trauma in our life.

Speaker 2:          00:49          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:50          I dunno. So I was watching this stuff and of course typical guys look googled you women's, all league like such as

Speaker 3:          00:57          the ovarian cycle, right. As the only right. I'm aware of where they see, no, you're a 15 year old boy, you have the wrong set of genitals go away.

Speaker 1:          01:17          Well, the fire guys all only bud. Right. I hate when people act like it's a level playing field. You know what I mean?

Speaker 4:          01:26          Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:26          It's like they're having this thing because it's not a level playing field. One of the women in there was just like, everything's kind of full fucking men only. What's your, it really is when you really look at it. Okay, I don't want him to fucking come off as like a complete goddamn liberal here.

Speaker 3:          01:40          People would buy like messages on Facebook about why is it okay for women to do this and not for men and guys do is for men.

Speaker 1:          01:51          All right, but you know, it really is. It's just

Speaker 4:          01:55          okay.

Speaker 1:          01:55          It's there for the taking for you. When you're a guy, you know, not saying you're going to get it. Nine out of 10 people still fail. That's one thing that feminists don't realize. You know, when you listen to them talking about what it's like to be a guy that had this cartoonish idea of what it's like to be a guy, you just show up. Oh, and the classic one, the more you act like a Dick, the more people respect you. I love that one. If a woman of a woman does it, she's considered a bitch. If a guy does it, it's like, have they ever done a survey? Just ask the general public, Hey, if you had your choice between working for somebody nice or working for a complete fucking asshole who treats you like shit, which would you pick? Um, anyway, so I'm watching this documentary, check it out. It's actually really a, you only get bothered me about the documentary is the way they spelled psychos, ovarian psychos. It's like you're on cycles. So why didn't you spell the first half? Like cycle and the rest like psycho, you know, little wordplay there. Nothing. All right. Anyways, so I watched it and it was interesting and actually it's this one woman said in it, you know, cause she'd been through all this shit when she was, uh, a little girl with their mother.

Speaker 5:          03:08          At first I thought I would try as much as a kid could try. Right. But I didn't have the words to say to say. And so my mom was saying that I was being silly. That's my dad and that and that, that I have to be, I have to, I use my dad and how can you not love your dad? And so it was very confusing. And so,

Speaker 1:          03:34          and then she had a daughter, I believe she was at least she had a kid, she became a mom. And then her mother said, well, now do you at least understand me? I bet you understand me a lot more. And she said to her mother, no, actually I've never understood you less.

Speaker 5:          03:53          That's my mom. And she comes into the room and she's like, wow, you know, now you know your mother now and now, hopefully now you'll understand me as a mom. Like she's up. And I was like shocked because I don't understand. And I just told her, I was like, I just went through 16 hours of street pain like this labor. And they phoned me up for this child that I am now 100% responsible for her, you know, or just like her, her upbringing and for her to be healthy and you don't say, and, and I told her, I looked her in the eyes and I told her, no, I mom, I friend, I understand you even listen.

Speaker 1:          04:34          And I actually cringed when I, when I saw that and I was just like, you know, that's something if you feel it, you don't say to your mom,

Speaker 6:          04:45          okay,

Speaker 1:          04:45          like what do you get out of saying that to you mother? All you're going to do is devastator and make her feel like she completely failed as a mom and it doesn't get you any real estate. That's something you say to your friend. And now that I have a kid, it's just like, I don't even understand what the fuck my mother did to me. Even more. [inaudible] you fucking clink you wine coolers and then that's it. You don't say it to your mom. We're checking callers.

Speaker 6:          05:15          Do you know what? Can you please go upstairs and get your brother? Why do I always have to do it? Just do it. Don't you give me that book, man? That bitch got herself a nice little dog. What did you just say? You heard me? No. Say it again. Ronnie say to my face, which muddy? You Jealous Young Daughters Ass, Huh?
