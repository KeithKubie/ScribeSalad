Speaker 1:          00:00:01       [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr and It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday, February 15th, 2016 hello. How are you? How was your world going on this Monday? How was your Valentine's Day? Huh? Did you get her something special? Um, if you're a smart son of a bitch, um, you're either not in a relationship or you're not taking her out until, uh, tonight or tomorrow or whatever. Whenever the prices go back down again, you know, and by the way, if enough people start doing this in the old fucking restaurants get wise to it and they start making their prices higher, Valentine's Day prices a few days before, a few days after, then fucking wait a week, wait a month, do it a month earlier. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:00:48       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:00:48       It's the biggest fucking rip off probably of the year, other than probably what's going on to Bernie Sanders, but I don't really understand. I guess she has some super delt delegates, you know? Oh, fucking Hillary Clinton's got the super and she already has the super delegate. She already had a hundred. She only needs a harder, the 20, whatever the fuck that is. Jesus Christ. It's like, it's like playing bridge, trying to keep up what's going on. I have no idea. All I know is I liked that Bernie looks like an old dog trying to eat a meal when he's talking [inaudible] the fucking job was going and the weird thing said his fingers do I like it. I could look at that for four years.

Speaker 1:          00:01:28       Um,

Speaker 2:          00:01:30       I got to admit that as much as I don't like all the racist shit Trump is doing, I do love some fucking jerk off yelling at other politicians. So that part has been enjoyable. You're a liar. There are that, there weren't any mass weapons of mass destruction. And they know it may sound like he's quoting some podcasts.

Speaker 1:          00:01:53       Um,

Speaker 2:          00:01:55       I have no idea. At some point I'm going to start paying attention. There's gotta be some even keeled so-and-so out there. I have no fucking clue. I have no clue. And last week I said that I hate him when people in the public eye talk about, uh, politics. You know, that's not true. I hate when they fucking tell me why I should vote for somebody. Oh Shit. Were you the guy from a interview with the vampire? Oh yeah. Who should I elect for leader of the free world? It was like when Tom Cruise was talking about psychology. It's like, Oh yeah, you pretended to be a shogun warrior in a NASCAR champion. Let me by by all means, let me listen to you talk about a modern medicine.

Speaker 1:          00:02:39       Um,

Speaker 2:          00:02:40       as long as you preface it with like, I'm a fucking moron. I don't know what I'm talking about, but I, here you go. You know? But when you really start believing it, that's when you get in trouble. And maybe I believe it, and maybe this is the way I'm just sort of soft pedal on a team. I'm playing the more on it as I'm fucking feeding you my, let's putting a little, a ringworm and you're fucking ear or whatever people say

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       there with the fucking ear worm, right? Some song you can't stand gets in your fucking head, you know, it's kind of a weird ones. What a song you like gets in your head. And then you don't mind. And then you drive everybody nuts around you. Like, uh, um, Steve Gorman from Steve Gorman sports sent me this, this link to this, uh, this country star that's been, um, that's been struggling for a long, long time. And he finally got a big break. I believe he's a distant cousin of Roy Clark. I'm not sure, but his name is Wheeler Walker Jr and uh, he sent me a clip that I'll send you guys. Uh, it's a great fucking song for Valentine's Day if you are not in a relationship for a man or a woman. And, uh, the hook is just been stuck in my head and I really want to sing it to you, but it's gonna ruin it for you. So go look up a wheeler Walker Jr. Uh, well I guess the song kind of ruins. It's called a fuck you. Yeah, bitch.

Speaker 3:          00:03:57       And it's really catchy and it's a, I dunno, it's fits rich, kind of poetic. I really think the, uh, the chorus really sums up what you feel when somebody breaks your heart. So, um, you know, country music, those country music stars, they can do that t every once in awhile. And it's nice to see someone go to the left, you know, those fucking country singers. So those poor bastards for all these fucking years, you know, they've been abused and drugs and you know, going to clan meetings and beating the shit out of their women. But when they get on TV, they got to do that family values thing. You know, they got to [inaudible]. Yeah. I just want to thank Jesus who I'm just, I just feel blessed that y'all just, you take me into your heart, you know, hey y'all, he wants you on some potato salad.

Speaker 3:          00:04:45       That stupid phony fucking southern thing where if you're from up north the first time you see it, your heart and melts. When you hear that Twang and you just think that dig the nicest fucking person. Nobody can stick the fucking knife in your back like a fucking southerner with that fucking k y'all. How'd you hit all mts work? And they downplay it. They play dumb, but blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And next thing you know, you're laying in a fucking pig trough about ready to get fucking eaten alive. That's how it goes down. All right, now guy from fucking 50 snatches and 40 smoking barrels, that's where we got it from. Okay. Not from that content. You know, I don't know where the fuck I'm talking about. Anyways, I watch a brand new TV show last night and uh, I was really fucking disappointed, you know, I fucking turned it on. I needed a new shelf and I thought it was going to be the one, you know, I was like, this is gonna be it. It's Valentine's Day night. Okay. Me and the lovely Nia, we're not going out. I had a fucking one of those Tomahawk steaks frozen in the freezer. The fucking

Speaker 2:          00:05:59       phrase, right? The frosted dead bitch all day. I watch like 30 youtube videos. His had dude sat, do you know what you're going to do? [inaudible] on Youtube. And I watched like 50 of those fucking things and I just sort of like, I took a survey with temperature and time flippage in all of that stuff. And I went down the middle and, uh, I got a little impatient with the big green egg. My temperature is a little higher than I wanted, so came out of the medium rather than a medium rare, but it was still fucking delish and I, there was a new series at that that I tried to get into last night and I put it on and, uh, it looked good. The acting was great, but the dialogue just wasn't there. And I tried to fucking fight it out for the first 20 minutes. And then I just looked over at Nia. Nia did one of those.

Speaker 2:          00:06:52       Yeah. You know, big inhale in the fucking eyes, like, yeah, this is a, yeah. And then I was just like, well, let's shut it up. She's like, no, you know, we gotta at least watch the pilot episode, you know, which is how she ended up marrying me because I believe 20 minutes into our relationship, she was like, yeah, but she fucking stuck it through night. She kept panning for gold and she found a little nugget and she stuck with me. I didn't, I was just like, fuck this. I'm out. And uh, by 40 minutes into it, I was imitating people in it and, uh, the whole thing just went down the shitter. So once again, but you know what it, you know, I'm finally gonna do I think I'm finally gonna start watching game of Thrones now that they're fucking five, 10, 15 fucking seasons into what I've been trying to watch it for the longest time.

Speaker 2:          00:07:47       But, uh, Nia is just not into it. You know, she doesn't wanna see a bunch of white people running around chasing dragons. It's just not what she's into. And, uh, I'm not really into dragons either, but like, if you're going to cut somebody's fucking head off, like, um, you know, you got to do a lot to lose me after that point. You know, I dunno. Maybe I don't know who the fuck knows. Maybe I, I remember watching the first one and there was some sort of spooky thing going on and there was some little kid that was supposed to watch a beheading and he looked away and then his, I forget what his dad did, put him on the rack or something. I don't remember. Um, but then I don't, I don't know what happened and that just kept it kept going and you know, it's like a train that was coming right.

Speaker 2:          00:08:31       And you could have ran and caught it, but I, but you don't, you just stand there and you watch it disappear. And in that moment when that train disappears and you realize you're late for work in that fucking moment, you question everything that you're doing in your life. Why didn't I run for that train? Because I had this job that I don't like. What am I doing in this relationship? What happened to me? What happened in the last six years in my fucking life? Right? It's a critical moment there where you have to beat all those thoughts down, bury them, and go back to being the Zombie that you are. Which brings me to the walking dead now. I'm kidding. Anyways, I want to thank everyone who came out in Cheyenne, Wyoming. I kept doing a southern accent the entire time I was out there and I was addressing it, but, uh, I don't know what Wyoming people sound like.

Speaker 2:          00:09:21       Um, Cheyenne, Wyoming and Denver, Colorado. I went out with, uh, Dean del Ray and uh, we had the great fucking time to play this, um, the Cheyenne civic center. How cool does that sound? And had all this amazing woodwork inside of it that really look like one of those log cabins that either an oil man or a fucking Hollywood starlet goes and buys. You know, like when people like it, a huge amount of success pretending to be other people at some point they have to get out of La. Then they always end up in like Wyoming or Montana. It's fucking hilarious. And they buy what looks like a log cabin, sort of. It looks like a log cabin and like a fucking resort all at the same time, you know? And then they go out there and they buy, they're a designer. I'm a fucking cattle rancher wardrobe.

Speaker 2:          00:10:14       And then they do the fucking interview, right. With their big stupid cowboy hat on and older, wiser, so and so steps back to a evaluate the last six years of a whirlwind, whatever the fuck it is. Right. You know what I mean? And then they pretend that they could live this little fucking life out there before they go nuts after three days and they call up a chief [inaudible] to pick them up and take them right back, you know, and they end up back down to chateau. Right. The Chateau Mall. I'm doing blow in a bungalow. That's what you do. You find in a little bit of balance. Um, oh, speak in a fucking [inaudible] before I go back on that shit. Speaking of fucking sick ass houses. I was, I went on this Paul Newman kick, you know, he's my favorite of all time. You know, a lot of people go, Steve McQueen.

Speaker 2:          00:11:02       I like Steve McQueen, but Paul Newman's my guy. Um, he's my fella. I just, I dunno, once I look into those blue eyes, I just, I melt to say anything. I believe it or are you a pool shark or you a lawyer? Do you play hockey? Um, I watched, um, well I guess the first thing I watched, I watched, uh, the man with the golden arm, which d, which Delray was telling me to watch, which was a, a movie about a Frank Sinatra playing a heroin addict who, uh, you know, comes out of jail and he gets clean and he plays the drums and he wants to get a gig playing drums. And, uh, I watched a great fucking movie. There's some brutal, brutal over acting. Um, you got to you, I don't know. I would definitely recommend seeing that. So once I've finished that, you know, it's like the next thing that was coming up was, uh, somebody up there likes me, which I had always heard of when I was growing up.

Speaker 2:          00:12:01       And then once I saw it was Paul Newman, I was like, all right, I'm going to watch it. And it was him playing out rocky Graziano the rocky Graziano story. And, um, and I literally forget what I was talking. Oh that's right. That's right. So it just got me on this, this, this Paul Newman thing. And you know what's funny is, uh, this is thing, actually Steve McQueen is in that movie for fucking two seconds. And uh, it's right as, uh, Graziano was getting out of some fucking, uh, you know, juvenile detention home that he fucking escapes. So He's going around the neighborhood, tapping all these guys, all this tough guy, friends on the shoulders to be like, Hey, I'm back in the neighborhood. And all of them turn around like, who the fuck is this guy? Right? Cause cause at Tufts street kids, so fucking, uh, fucking Steve McQueen is shooting pool.

Speaker 2:          00:12:52       They rocky taps them on the shoulder. And he fucking turns around with a knife out, just two seconds. And then he realizes it's reads like it's rocky, a rocky, and he does this stupid fucking thing with his hand that I don't know who fucking, there's certain things in movies that the first guy who plays that guy does. And then it's this weird fucking thing where every other actor after it starts fucking doing it. And you know, nobody ever did it, who's actually the guy that they're playing. But then it's done enough in fucking movies that the people who are actually that guy, then they start fucking doing it. And that's when it becomes a circle. And you don't know who the fuck it is. It's this fucking thing like a, it's almost like say you were getting a mannequin right and you want it to dry off your nails and you do it just exactly a rocky and he's doing this stupid fucking thing with his hand.

Speaker 2:          00:13:46       Um, I don't know. I'm going a really long way here to tell you what I really want to tell you. But like one of my favorite things is to watch actors during that era playing Tufts street kids. Um, like it's just, it's fucking cringeworthy that fucking movie that Marlon Brando did. He's on the motorcycle with the fuck was that one called? It's not the wild bunch. That was a cowboy movie. Rebel without a caught. Now that's James Dean. I can't remember, but just the, the have to sit there and watch that shit. Um, how fucking brutal it is. That west side story, which I don't think I've ever seen. I'm just going to throw that in there cause I need three of them. Um, I dunno. Whatever. So I started watching that. So then I finished that one and then the next one that came on, I can't even remember the name of it.

Speaker 2:          00:14:35       Fuck, hang on a second. Now. I gotta I MDB fucking Paul Newman. Um, he just has the bluest eyes. Paul Newman. I am the fucking be filmography. So anyways, I think it was called not Hudson. The long story was this next movie comes on, right? And in the beginning, he's driving in this car and he's clearly in Los Angeles, which was one of my favorite fucking things ever to just see old footage, black and white or color of La. And you just get to see like you can usually tell by the Hollywood hills and sometimes the highways and shit kind of where they are. And um, you'll see like train tracks and shit that they ripped up those fucking cons or you'll see 'em you know, you'll just see how less populated as all right. Here it is. Harper Harper's the movie, the very beginning of the movie, he goes into a house and uh, Lauren because in there Lauren Bacall who married a Humphrey Bogart bogey and Bacall one of the great couples in Hollywood history and uh, you know, Humphrey Bogart, somebody that Frank Sinatra stole a lot of his swagger from.

Speaker 2:          00:15:51       They were also the first rat pack Humphrey Bogart and all his fucking crew. And uh, not only did, uh, Sinatra steal a lot of Humphrey Bogart swagger, he actually ended up fucking Lauren Bacall later on after Humphrey Bogart died, which is really fucked up. But anyways, I digress. So at Harper, he pulls into this fucking house that I could not believe and uh, I actually looked it up and it still exists. Look it up right now. If you're at work, pretend that you're doing, uh, that you're doing some sort of, I'm busy work. It's, it's on one zero one one north Beverly drive, 10 11 Beverley drive. And uh, this fucking house, I think it's just called the Beverly House, it's in Beverly Hills, probably has one of the sickest fucking pools I've ever seen in my life. It's like a three tiered thing. The first two tiers I believe are just considered a waterfall.

Speaker 2:          00:16:49       And first of all, it has like a half mile driveway that he did. He comes up around in what's Hilarious, which will looks like the first year they had the Porsche, which at this point by 1965, when they shot, it was just considered a piece of shit. Who would know that years later, some baby boomer would play like fucking 900 grand for it. So he's driving up one of, you know, one of the fenders is like that fucking, you know, what's that, that paint that they primer and all that shit. So he pulls up in his fucking house. You've got to see the backyard of it. So actually I looked the fucking thing up, I found out where it was and the next time I fly a helicopter I'm going to fucking fly over the house and check it out. Um, it's actually a, just a little bit north of the Beverly Hills Hotel, but you got to check this fucking thing out.

Speaker 2:          00:17:37       Um, one of the great things about living in Los Angeles, a lot of people, you know, always shit on living in la, but one of the main, I think la arguably has some of the most amazing homes, um, in the country, just for the simple fact that for whatever reason, I don't know if it's the weather out here or what, they haven't been torn down. Um, so many of them, um, you know, other places that I've been to, but they have like craftsman's houses out here and then they have all the, the, the Spanish, the Mediterranean style ones they have, uh, they got, it's just incredible houses. So you've got to check this one out. This house is actually kind of ugly, you know, when you pull up, they shut the godfather part two there, but I'm part one there. This is actually the house where, uh, the horses head scene, um, spoiler alert if you, if you're one of the two people have never seen that fucking movie, they shot that scene in there and JFK and his wife Jackie had their honeymoon in this fucking house and I just saw it recently. The last time it's sold, it's sold for $135 million.

Speaker 2:          00:18:49       And all I'm doing looking at it after by in my old ass house that was made in 1923 all I see is fucking 50,000 square foot of galvanized pipe and cloth wiring that they're going to have to somehow fucking read through where all sections of it. You know, there's a little bit of copper pipe here, a little bit of wiring that was done correctly. Um, but anyways, that's another cool thing about these fucking houses out there is that they've been around so long and if they're in a desirable area in Hollywood, like the stories of like the people that live there, like how cool. I mean, that's $135 million house. Obviously it'd be a fucking amazing house. But how fucking amazing would be to have that house and be like, he didn't see a movie. And you're watching Paul Newman walking across your fucking terrace that you now want. I don't know. I think that Shit's cool as hell. But, um, you know why you're at it. You can check out a lot of those and also just look up famous Hollywood homes. Um, I told you there's a house about,

Speaker 4:          00:19:52       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:19:53       Not even like, I dunno, maybe a 15 minute drive away from me in, in, in Los Angeles, 15 minutes is a big fucking deal. Sometimes just, you know, 15 blocks, it can go one way or another. It can literally go like to, I'm going to get stabbed to how the fuck can you ever afford to live in hi. How many people did you steal from to get this fucking sky's got a moat around his house. Let's, let's wait. La Is, it's like really like patchwork. So like a 15 minute drive away from where I live. Um, my neighbor told me there's a house that went up for sale. I think I told this story before and um, it's an old ass house. It's pre-prohibition. And Basically, uh, when prohibition came around, this House had a pool and then it had a, a Cabana and in the companion, this guy, he built a bar during prohibition and he had illegal booze or I don't know if he was making beer in the bathtub, whatever the fuck he was doing.

Speaker 2:          00:20:53       But he used to, he used to have all these famous people come over there and they would just booze it up. And, um, he, anybody who came over there and drank that was famous, he would have them carve their names into the bar. And, uh, evidently according to my neighbor who went and looked at the house, even though he couldn't afford it, he just wanted to see the bar. He went and looked at it. And it's one of those things, if you buy the house, it's that bars obviously protected by the historical society is some shit. But you go in there and everyone from like Louis Armstrong to like fucking Humphrey Bogart have, have carved their names into that fucking bar. So, um, whatever, that's some sort of nerdy Los Angeles. How shit. But um, yeah, definitely. Uh, rather than work today, just go on Google earth and just look at some of those fucking houses.

Speaker 2:          00:21:44       Um, or just Google, like famous Hollywood homes too. This homes where like, you know, when I was watching that, you know, somebody up there likes me. Uh, right. I should really know the name of the fucking actress, the one who plays Paul Newman's love interest obviously is an absolute, uh, fucking knockout. And I had never heard of her. So the fact that I never heard of her, I'm like, ah, fuck. I, I've looked up enough of those, those old movies, like I got this creepy thing that I always look people up like an older person. Like, all right, that person's definitely dead. Let's see how long that they lived for. Right. Or you try to find a cast where like everybody's dead, you know, which is a very difficult thing to, to, so anyways, so I started looking up, you know, the people that were, you know, this woman, I hope I say her name right.

Speaker 2:          00:22:34       It's p, I. E. R. Is it Pierre? Pete Pier? I don't know. And Jelly. I have no idea. I looked her up and I was immediately going like, she probably died of pills cause back then like, I dunno, like getting, giving people pills, like it seems back then every guy either died of a heart attack in his fifties and sixties, or he died at cancer and like 90% of the women died of an accidental, like barbiturate overdose because back then, like, you know, the woman came in and she had some emotional issues, you know, the doctors are like, for God's sakes, get all to yourself. And they would just give her some pills to relax her. It was like in that movie airplane where they will just slapping you and giving you a backhand and shit. So, um, she was just gorgeous, amazing actress. And then of course I looked it up and um, you know, she died accidentally. Um, some people say suicide, some people say accidentally at 39 years of age. And then I look it up and sure enough, the place was, she fucking overdosed is still there. That's another one of those things. It's a really fucking you, I would see the coolest,

Speaker 3:          00:23:46       creepy, all these fucking houses that people died in. There's another actor in there. This guy's Sal Mineo or whatever. Um, I swear to God, who's a dead ringer for Ralph Maggio. He's in it. And uh, he ended it. He got fucking stabbed to death in like the mid Seventies. It's fucking on real man. Like a lot of people, a lot of stars back in the day. They didn't make it. They didn't fucking write it out. It seemed like just crazy shit happen to them. And I guess what I'm saying is that a lot of these houses still exist. And if you're sort of, um, I guess I'm becoming morbid in my older ages, I realize, you know, you know what I mean? You're your mortality. You start looking how long this person live? How do they live? How did they die? Fuck. Is that going to happen to me? You know, that type of ship.

Speaker 3:          00:24:32       I don't know. All right, let's, let's read the street. A little fucking advertising here for the week.

Now if you're flying south, that's where Bravo airspace begins along the coastline. And when you're there, you have to be at 150 feet or below at or below one 50. And then you transition the bravo airspace. If you go a little bit further south, you'll see lax. All right. And that's to the south of it is to five, right in two, five left and to the north there's two five, right? Two five left, those two runways.

Speaker 2:          00:28:47       And those are where the big boys are taken off. So you fly underneath those guys or ladies and you stay at or below, um, 150 feet until you get two. And then you got to zoom in a, the Manhattan Beach Pier and, uh, which is almost a beam as they say, the, uh, comedy and magic club down in Hermosa beach. Um, so you want to be, you want to be right down there, 150 fucking goddamn feet. Um, now wait a minute, wouldn't it be Hermosa? Yeah, no, I'm sorry. Hermosa beach pier is where the comedy clubs that, but the Manhattan Beach Pier, that's where you want to be. You got us from, from there to Marina del Ray, you're going to be at or below 150 feet. So if you come out here and you're on the beach as a tourist, you see these helicopters flying by really low.

Speaker 2:          00:29:42       Uh, they're not buzzing the beach looking at your or whatever they are. Uh, they are transitioning the bravo airspace. So I'm going to be doing that. Um, I don't know on one day, but that's my big goal this week with the helicopter thing there. Uh, but anyways, let's get back to the, uh, skip back to the podcast here. Um, where is it? What else did I want to talk about? Oh, how about those Boston Bruins. Now I know we lost, I know we lost to a, the Redwings. I didn't get to see the, uh, the game yet. I have a taped, I'm a game behind. I watched, um, the f I'm actually game and two thirds behind. I watched the first quarter of a, of us beating the wild and Brad Marshawn scored again his 12th goal in 12 games. And I actually looked up the ticket and I saw that he scored his 13th fucking goal.

Speaker 2:          00:30:35       And, uh, in 13 games, the guy's on fire. And, uh, I saw his goal in the, um, the Minnesota wild game, um, a shorthanded goal, just a beautiful pass and uh, and it was fucking awesome. And he's gonna have like guys, he's on his way. He's gonna have like 40 goals his fucking year. Um, and I got to say just the Bruins and the Celtics this year, both of them, I was just going to be like, this is, you know, after all the moves they made, you know, I just kind of felt that neither one was going to be that competitive and it was going to be tough to watch. And this year, and, uh, I am, I think they're both over achieved and it's been fun to watch them, although for some reason my fucking recorder stopped taping the Celtics Games. I was really getting into it watching Isaiah Thomas and, um, Crowder, uh, Jae Crowder and, uh, who's the jam band guy that finally learned his fucking name?

Speaker 2:          00:31:28       They're a Kelly Olynyk. Right. I was enjoying watching it and our young coach there who I still don't know his fucking name cause I always taped the games and they talked to them and I just fast forward through all of that shit. And then they just show him, I think his name is Stan Steven, something with an s Shawn, I dunno, but he looks like a baby man. The guy's like fucking 15 years younger than me and he's coaching the Celtics. He's doing a great job. And evidently we got a couple of number one draft picks. We're in a great fucking position. Um, I missed the all star weekend stuff. I saw some of the dunking stuff and Kevin Hart, did anybody see Kevin Hardy or he went up against some other NBA guy. I can tell, I don't watch the fucking NBA. He went up against a professional basketball player and a three point contest.

Speaker 2:          00:32:18       Um, should I give you a spoiler alert or should I do that? The clickbait and the results will surprise you and it gives a fuck. He actually beat the guy. And what I loved about it, besides being a big fan of, uh, his stuff and everything was when he went to start shooting his three pointers, they were playing disrespectful music underneath them. They were playing this, I'm always in this like, oh, it's adorable. Or is it, it's silly that this little man is going to come out here and try and beat one of our professional athletes and a,

Speaker 4:          00:32:54       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:32:54       They were right through the first two racks and then he fucking close strong. And I think he might've beat him on the last ball. You got to see it, Matt. I mean, it's a, it's pretty fucking impressive. If I remember correctly, in long time ago, he was telling me that before he was a comedian, he went to a a, you know, he went to a basketball camp that had a young unknown Coby Bryan and that type of shit. So, um, but still, man, you know, it was a long fucking time ago. Since then, he's gone all the way to selling out the eagles football stadium doing standup comedy. You'd think that his basketball game would drop off a little bit, that maybe he'd be a little rusty at the y. Forget about being able to beat a fucking NBA player in a three point contest.

Speaker 2:          00:33:38       It was pretty, pretty God damn impressive. Um, so anyways, let me get back. Jesus Christ, Wyoming, Cheyenne, Wyoming. So I go there and um, you know, this was the last of the 50 that I had to do. So of course I'm reading all up on Wyoming and all that type of stuff and I see that Yellowstone park is right in the north northwest corner of it. And I'm like, Oh fuck. I gotta go up there and go do a gig in the middle of nowhere at some point. And uh, maybe I'll do a nice run through Montana, Idaho and all that shit. The Dakotas, um,

Speaker 2:          00:34:14       you know, I get into all that fucking nerdy shit, right? So we do the Gig, we have a great time. It takes some pictures with some people afterwards. And when I was on stage, I was saying, hey, where should we go tonight if I want to go out and have a pot? Right. So of course everybody's yelling out everything at the same time and I can't hear anything. So I'm like one at a time, one at a time. And then just in the back, this guy yells out the gray door, said to go to the green door, and then the whole crowd just goes, ah, like, you know, don't go there. And I was like, I was like, I didn't even need you guys to say that. The green door just sounds like some creepy serial killer place. So I go, I'm not fucking going there. So then somebody said, I forget the fuck it was called the Cadillac lounge or something. I took a picture of it. So, um,

Speaker 4:          00:35:01       I, uh,

Speaker 2:          00:35:03       I decide, you know, all right, that's where the fuck we'll go. We'll go over to this thing. I'm actually looking at the picture right now on my, uh, uh, my phone here. Um,

Speaker 4:          00:35:14       yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:35:14       come on. Come on. Where is it? Where is it? There it is. The Cadillac Cadillac ranch. Sorry. So we go in there, you know, there's a big American flag lit up on the side. I'm like, all right, here we go. Let's fucking go in there and see what this place is about. And we went in there and I gotta tell you, man, it was the most diverse group of fucking people I've ever seen in my life. And I think for the simple fact, there was no other place to go. So there was like a group of bikers. There was, there was soldiers. Um, there was like ranchers, there was a group of lesbians and then it was just filler people that you couldn't really tell what the fuck they were. They was older, younger, the whole fucking thing. So we're in, they're like, wow man, this is fucking, this is nuts.

Speaker 2:          00:36:07       And then it had a real like cowboy kind of feel to it. Yet there was like a fucking DJ play in like modern music. It was this, it was fucked. So we're in there and dean for whatever fucking reason is just pointing at Shit and people going, look at that fucking guy. Look at this shit, look at his fucking bar. And I'm sitting there going, Dean, stop pointing at Shit. Stop Pointing Shit. You know? And Dean's been sober for like 20 fucking years, so he's got no excuse. He just kept pointing at Shit. Um, and then finally, you know, I had a, you know, I was talking to a couple of the people in there talking to this guy that was in the middle of taking a two year welding class, which of course was really interesting to me. I was talking to about that shit. I was talking to some other people.

Speaker 2:          00:36:48       And, uh, then at one point somebody said, hey, you wanna a whiskey. So like, um, my thing now when I go on the road and I drink, I have a beer and a, and a and a whiskey or a scotch, and then that's it. I call it a fucking night. And it's been working out great for me, you know what I mean? So I have a nice little taste, but then I don't get hammered and then I'm fine the next morning and I kind of work out and shit. Right. So, uh, this guy offers, you know, he comes over, hey, you know, I've got gotta buy a drink. I said, well, I'm just getting a beer. And I said, all right, well, you know, I was going to get a whiskey too. He goes, what do you want? He goes, we got a local fucking Wyoming whiskey.

Speaker 2:          00:37:20       I was like, all right, when in Cheyenne, let's fucking do it right? So he gets me this fucking shot and he brings it over and it looked, it was almost like see-through. Now I don't know if they did whiskey and water or what, but I fucking took a sip of it and they had no bite or anything. I was just looking at him like, dude, what the fuck is his? He goes, he goes, well, it hasn't been aged at all. I've got to tell you, dude, it was the worst whiskey I've ever had in my apology to the person who bought me the shot. I couldn't finish it. I looked, I said, Dina, go look at this fucking thing. And he was just like, yeah, dude, that looks like piss. So, um, and then at that point I wasn't looking, but dean was saying that the bikers people were mean mugging everybody and he goes to, let's get the fuck outta here.

Speaker 2:          00:38:03       So we get outta there. And, uh, oh, as we were driving over there, I noticed that there was a drive, there was a liquor store with a drive through. So I was like, Oh God, I gotta get a picture of that. So I get pulled over, I get a picture of it. And then I'm just like, dude, I gotta do it. I gotta go to a drive through liquor store. So I fucking pull up. We actually, I posted video of this and I just wanted to get one beer and the guy goes, well, I can give you like the 24 ounce. So I got like a Budweiser and I'll repost the video on the, uh, the, the Monday morning podcast, Twitter page. So I went up, I ordered a fucking beer. And what was really cool was it had the old fucking remember the old air hoses when you would pull up at the, the, uh, the gas station. And it would ring the bell like, Dang, Dang is your, is your car pulled in? It was so fucking cool. And um,

Speaker 4:          00:38:55       okay,

Speaker 2:          00:38:56       well he was sitting there and then this dude just sort of walked into the place or whatever. And as we drive out, there's an Arby's across the street, which I never fucking eat, you know, fucking fast food roasts, roast beef. I mean, I like to think I'm a courageous person, but that's just a little, that's, that gets a little too shady for me. Right. I'd rather eat the pink slime. Um, so anyways, uh, del Rey's going like, hey man, it goes, let's hit the Arby's. I'm hungry. So I go, all right, so we go into the Arby's, right? He ordered some shit. Then I ordered like some chicken sliders, which I shouldn't have fucking got. They were fucking disgusting. It was like eating the heel of some chicks fucking boot boot, you know, just the way they were shaped like clogs. They were just fucking gross. So, um,

Speaker 4:          00:39:42       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:39:43       We go around to the drive through and this is right across from the drive through liquor store. And I look across the street and I read the sign. And what does it say? It says the green door. So the drive through liquor store is part of this shady fucking teddy bar called the green door. That urban legend said that there was a one legged stripper and now the younger me would have been like, I got to go in and go see that shit. The older me goes like, oh my God, that's somebody's daughter. So, um, so technically I kinda did go to the green door. I didn't, I didn't go in there. I just fucking pulled up or whatever. So I'll, I'll, I'll post some pictures of that shit. Um, let me see if I actually took him. So, and then the next day we got up right.

Speaker 2:          00:40:25       And we wanted to go to some local place to get a, uh, to get breakfast. And we went to this local place. And I don't know if the regular chef was out of town, but I ordered eggs over easy and I cut into them. Dude, they was so under cooked, like it came out clear, like the white part of the egg was still clear. Like, you know, when those people drink like egg whites, it was like that. And so dean's eggs were the same way and uh, I just never sent food back, so I just stirred him in with the fucking Hash. I mean, they should've just served the eggs in a glass like fucking rocky Balboa and I just suck it down. And I noticed a woman diagonally from me, she sent her eggs back to, and then in the end when I went to, uh, I went to pay, she was just like, how was it?

Speaker 2:          00:41:13       And when I said it was great, I kinda stumbled on when it was great. It was great. And then she goes and that she me looked up, she goes, is everything okay? Is Everything okay? So I'm just guessing that the, the normal chef was out of town, so I'm not gonna out. This place is being a, a as being something bad. But, uh, it was pretty rough. It was one of the worst breakfasts I've ever had. But, uh, when we, when we came back down, um, we'd drive down to Denver. I Lu feel like a little kid right now, like I'm just telling you every moment of this fucking this tour. But a dean's a big motorcycle guy, he's been Ryan for 30 years, so they had this huge fucking Harley Davidson dealership right on the 25 as we would come down. So we stopped in and I didn't know, but Harley has a new bike that's just right out of my childhood.

Speaker 2:          00:42:01       It's called the 72. And it's got the big spoked front wheel. It's got the handle bars. It's like fucking Arthur fonds and rallies bike, which obviously was fucking, uh, from the s the, you know, the 50s or whatever. But um, I haven't written in like a year and a half and uh, I dunno man, I think I gotta ride that bike. I think I'm going to rent it just one day. There's a park up around where I'm at co rented on like a Sunday and just go up there in the morning time and just fucking ride around and bring it back. I'm too much of a pussy to ride all the time cause a, you know, I got too much to fucking lose and um,

Speaker 1:          00:42:38       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:42:39       Oh my God. They had one in this black and gold metal flake was fucking gone. It's just perfect man. As much as I loved the road king, like every one to be motorcycle rider who watched a couple episodes of a whatever that fucking show was. What was that fucking show there that everybody watched about it? About the bikes. Um,

Speaker 1:          00:42:59       okay.

Speaker 2:          00:43:00       You know like every fucking want to be bad ass who doesn't have a tattoo and it's not a motorcycle guy. Like del Ray took a picture of me on the fucking 70 to 72 and I just started laughing. I was like, how much, how much am I not a motorcycle guy? Like do you realize if what a fucking nerd you have to look like to sit on a Harley and still look like a fucking still look like somebody you could bully. I look like every fucking just white dude having a midlife crisis. They're like, you know who watched it? What does that fucking show? What is the fucking show that was all about the motorcycles that everybody watched. I never got into it. Um, goddammit, it's the perfect reference for this shit. But, um, anyways, I might have to rent one coming up, uh, might go ride a dirt bike and get my fucking, my skills back up to the ridiculously low level that they were.

Speaker 2:          00:43:58       I just go to a local park out here and I just drive this loop around and around and around. It's actually good because, uh, there's a lot of downshifts in that shit. A lot of turns. You gotta look your way through all this shit that I learned in the safety course and everything. But like I told you guys the one time when I rode a motorcycle down sunset all the way out to the beach, just like I wanted to just thinking, ah, this is gonna feel, you know, freedom man America. Right. And I was going to see all this shit, dude, I didn't see shit. I was fucking terrified. There was just too many fucking people. And I'm, you know, we went later than I to go, I rode with Dean and dean had done spots, so he didn't get up to like 10, so we didn't get on the road till like 11.

Speaker 2:          00:44:36       And I wanted to go at like seven in the fucking morning when there was nobody on the road and really just be able to relax a little bit and not have somebody right behind me. Um, and I just remember getting off the bike and I was like shaking and I was just like, I had to have that fucking get out of your ego moment and just be like, Bill, this isn't in you. You don't have this in your blood. You're not a motorcycle fucking guy. He just not, so don't be that shit head. And, uh, I immediately sold the bike or got rid of it, whatever the fuck I did. I don't even remember. But, um, I don't know. I think every once in a while, if, you know, I smoke a couple cigars a month, I got that under control. Every once in a while I run a motorcycle and I know everybody's going to fucking be like, oh, [inaudible] Jewish, cause you're going to be fucking rusty r right.

Speaker 2:          00:45:23       Taking all the fun out of everything. Um, all right. Oh also, uh, this week, um, I got back into like drinking juices and shit and there was this fucking allergy shit, which was disgusting when I drank it. But I felt amazing afterwards and I'm trying to, uh, you know, like Dean said, you know, it's a good addiction to have. Like you get addicted to shit. I realized that. And if you're addicted to like working out and good stuff, that's obviously a much better thing for you. So I'm, I try to get back into that type of stuff. But anyways, um, this, uh, this past weekend, on Saturday night when I got back, I went to a, uh, this music music cares event. And, um, every year they honor somebody and whoever they're honoring, everybody comes out and I'm just, does this person's music. So say they wandering ACDC, a bunch of famous fucking musicians that are into ACDC would come out and do all their songs and switch them up and do different versions of them.

Speaker 2:          00:46:32       So is Lionel Richie, right? Oh, what a feeling, right? So I go to this fucking thing and it was unreal. It was like Lenny Kravis usher, who I couldn't believe how small he was. He fucking crushed it. Um, John Legend, Stevie wonder. All right, all these monsters and then Stevie wonder, and I knew Dave Grohl was going to go on and I'm, I kind of fuck is Dave Grohl gonna follow us? Is he going to play drums and saying, is he going to do the come out with his blue guitar and sing? And he just went up and just sang a song. That was it. He told this fucking story about, you know, when he broke his leg or he fell off the stage where he broke his leg. He was talking about all the outpouring from the fans and all that. And then one day he just got this giant fucking basket of muffins.

Speaker 2:          00:47:23       The biggest basket, I guess ever. This fucking giant thing. And there was no note or anything on, and as he's telling this story that the band sorta just playing, you know, some music underneath it and he's telling this story and he's got people laughing, but they're listening and all that shit. And then like two days later, I guess he got a, he got a, a a call from his manager who said, yeah, uh, Lionel Richie, Lionel Richie just called up to see if you got the fucking giant basket of muffins. And then he just goes, uh, so I just, you know, I forget how we fucking ended the story. I'm butchering it now, right as he ends the store and you realize that it was Lionel Richie, they kick into that his song, you are a Dave Grohl just crushed it, you know, let's argue you are this something and you are the rain.

Speaker 2:          00:48:14       And he just was up there singing it, fucking crushed. It went on after Stevie wonder and crushed it. Um, so I, I got to, I got to do that. You know, it was funny was, uh, I, I went down there and, um, you know, I'm not a suit guy, but you had to wear like a shirt and tie dude. And I swear to God, like, I dunno, just like me when I was on the motorcycle, when I had on that suit and tie, dude, I don't know what I was. Sometimes I look all right. But, uh, the thing about suits is if you, if you, you got to buy them, like they go on a style really quick. And this one was like three, four years old. I just gotten a dry clean to some show the last time I wore it. And I put this fucking thing on.

Speaker 2:          00:48:56       And, uh, I was talking to Nia, I was like, and I just kept going. I look like an asshole right there. I like, she's like, no, you look fine. I guy. Yeah, I don't think so. I look like an asshole. So the whole fucking night, um, you know, anytime I would walk into the bathroom, you know, it was a long fucking, I was like a four hour fucking thing, you know. And, uh, anytime I would go in there and I would wash my hands, I would just sit there and I would look at myself in the mirror. I just kept laughing. What a fucking jerk off I look like. Uh, I don't know. It wasn't a good scene, you know, I don't like hate myself. It's not a good place for me to be say, I think it's time to retire that suit. Um, all right, let's get into some of the, uh, some of the fucking questions here for the week.

Speaker 2:          00:49:41       Um, ah, here we go. A judge Scalia, bill listener from Virginia here, the death of Judge Scalia brought out some jokes on social media and a lot of people took the angle that they were happy that he died. Now I'm assuming this is somebody on the supreme court because I don't pay attention to shit, but I did see some stuff about this is the first time the supreme court won't be conservative. He goes, what's your position on making jokes about being happy people died. Thanks for, for, for that. Laughs. Thank you. Me. Thank you. Thanks for the laughs. Um, my position on making joke about why, yeah, I think you got a B. Uh, I think you gotta be like a dictator for people to do shit like that. Yeah. I mean PR I wouldn't say don't do it cause there's always a joke. I mean, some day when I die, there's going to be a joke. I mean, I'm, I know if I'm hovering around as a ghost, I'm going to laugh about it. What the fuck do I care? I'm a ghost at that point. Right. I didn't go to hell. All right. I'm floating around. I could deal with this. Uh, but yeah, I don't do that. Um, well look, if you just make a joke joke, that's fine, but if you're doing it because you didn't share like their political views, uh,

Speaker 3:          00:51:03       yeah, I'm not into doing that type of shit. Like, you know, some, some shit head. I'm going to start doing this. Like this shit had tweeted the week, somebody sent me a text today telling me that I needed to distance myself. Bill, just to let you know, you need to distance yourself from so and so. Um, and then sent me a link and this is somebody that had been friends with for 20 fucking years. And then I see this link and it has to do with being a vegetarian or eating meat and the name of the video is so and so is an ignorant moron, which right there I love, like that's your angle, like to get someone to listen to your opinion. Um, right there. I just look at it like this is just, this is just somebody trying to make a name for themselves, trashing somebody that, that has made a name for themselves, you know, with some over the top title. First of all, I love is an ignorant moron. Like that's like redundant,

Speaker 2:          00:52:00       you know, he's a stupid, not smart person. I'm like, I need to distance myself from say from someone who's been a great friend for 20 years because of their dietary decisions, you know, because they talk about food and nutrition in a way that's a truth that they believe in all of this, you know, like, and then anyone what, you're a fucking genius, you know? And it's just, you know, I don't know. I don't know why people do shit like that. So that kind of ties into, and I would never, obviously, you know, that's, I dunno, I would never tweet it. Somebody like that. You need to distance yourself from this person because I don't agree with their workout regimen. And the same thing with like that, like if I, I wouldn't be happy that somebody died because I didn't like their political views, you know what I mean? I always have that in my head. They had somebody's dad, somebody's husband or some shit, you know, whatever. He was a gay judge. That's somebody's boyfriend. Right. I had a fucking dumb I, yeah, I don't do shit like that, but if somebody does, you know, I'm not the comedy fucking police. Um, all right, summer home,

Speaker 3:          00:53:10       Phil. My wife wants to own a home by a lake in New Hampshire. That's fucking awesome. I'm trying to convince her that it's cheaper to just rent a sick house every summer for a couple of weeks instead of paying 15 grand a year in taxes on top of the mortgage. Help me sort out this business. Please go fuck yourself. Well, what I would say is, you know, you can rent out your house, your summerhouse, you know, this is what I would do. Okay. I would, I would buy that house on the lake and then I would just rent the whole fucking thing out. And then whenever I wanted to go, I would rent some other place. You know what I mean? And this is how I'm weird because I wouldn't want to go into a place that I owned knowing that everybody fucked in my bed. I would rather go to a place knowing that a bunch of people fucked in somebody else's bed. It makes no sense. What you should do is buy it and then rent it out. I mean, buying property is always great. However, if you're having a rough time, like I'm a big believer in no paying down your first house,

Speaker 1:          00:54:21       um,

Speaker 3:          00:54:23       you should really pay that thing down and get it under control before you go and get a summer house. And I do know that in relationships, when it comes to money, there's usually one person understands it and the other person doesn't understand it and they want everything. Yesterday, and you might be a little more conservative, which is what you sound like. So, um,

Speaker 3:          00:54:48       I w you know, I would just sit down and just say, look, first of all, you're in a great position because it doesn't sound like she can just go out and pull the trigger herself. So I just say, listen, I definitely want to do that, but we need to, we need to pay down this house a little bit or, you know, if we can't afford it, let's buy it and then we'll rent the thing out all the weekends that we're not going to be there. Um, I think that's definitely to, it's definitely a smart way to do it. But, uh, I would just sit down,

Speaker 1:          00:55:19       okay.

Speaker 3:          00:55:19       And write out all the points that you want to make and then draw a smiley face. This is what I do when I'm being a smart person because I know how short a fuse I have. And, uh, I write all this shit out, everything that I want to say and all that stuff. And then I draw a smiley face reminding me to not lose my temper. Reminding me that other people are entitled to have different opinions and uh, you know, and not to be a cunt. I didn't do that a couple of days ago and ended up having a big stupid fight over the, the, the bathroom sink. You know, I'd gone on the road and it did start, started to clog up and I didn't have time to fucking fix it, but you know, we can't drain up. So I figured, you know, my wife would fucking handle it and I come home to brush my teeth and I turn it on and within fucking two seconds it's already filling up as a puddle. It's completely backed up

Speaker 1:          00:56:16       and you know,

Speaker 3:          00:56:19       it's usual shit, usual shit in a relationship. You say to somebody else, did you notice? No. You had noticed and in your head you're like, how the fuck did you not notice this shit? But what I learned in that argument is I have to understand that this shit that she's looking at me at looking at me at about like, how the fuck do you not notice it? And it's just, cause I'm just not wired like that. And that's why you get married. Hopefully you're a yin and a Yang. I finally set him right. I didn't say it,

Speaker 2:          00:56:45       Yang and Yang. I said, [inaudible] why I, and I think this the first time publicly I've ever said it right. Um, yeah, they're going to be good at this shit that you're not good at. And um, actually had a great day with Nia yesterday. Like I didn't do shit for once and we just hung out all day and um, you know, we watched some movies and shit. You made a little bit of food and I always forget that, that every once in a while you guys, you gotta hang out with each other rather than just being roommates to remind yourself like, oh yeah, that's right. We actually really love each other. I forgot about that shit and I don't, the amount of times I've had to fucking learn that, you know, she get married, you really start doing the math. Like, dude, fuck do shit. I don't need anything. I will literally give her everything.

Speaker 3:          00:57:37       I will fucking just give you fucking everything and I will walk out with the shirt on my fucking back and I will start all over again. Like I think that that's the way to fucking do it and just walk down the street after it like Johnny fucking apple seed. And um,

Speaker 2:          00:57:56       because I really think you just get into having all of this fucking stuff, but if you just let go of all of it, then you don't have it. I think getting divorced could be a really light feeling.

Speaker 3:          00:58:05       This is how far I went over and argument over a clogged up sink before he came to my census. I was walking down the street with the, with the stick, with the Bandana and a peanut butter and jelly sandwich in it. Then I was just finally like,

Speaker 2:          00:58:17       what am I doing? You know, stop being a fucking idiot. All right, let's get to some advertising here. All right, me undies, everybody. Oh Gee, I got to sing this quietly because we have company over here right now. Podo poop. Poop me and eat me undies. No more sweaty nuts. Badu do. Do me on these BMDS keep a dry with your butts when that doesn't make sense. Ah, I said nuts. I was thinking bus would rhyme.

Your balls will say your a saint. Uh, show your special day. That fucking guy up there either. Can you shake

Something that says you deserve the best. I have to tell you right now, you, if you give somebody underwear for a gift, you better be fucking them. Are they better be your kid? Cause other than that, it's fucking weird. Uh, you know, give you kid underwear. You know, you're, there you go. Jesus Christ straighten up and fly. Right.

Speaker 1:          00:59:48       You know,

Speaker 3:          00:59:50       I have a little respect for yourself, you know, and then if you, you know, you're with the person intimately, you can give it to them, you know, there's no fucking way actually is a joke. You can do that.

Speaker 1:          00:59:59       You know,

Speaker 2:          01:00:00       you know, I was actually thinking the other day when I went to buy my wife a Valentine's Day card, you know, I was looking for the blank ones cause I hate the fucking Valentine's Day cards. You know, they're either over the top gross or they're just fucking like too distant. You know, it's very hard to find that one. That's the nice balance of I love you, but let's not be gross. Um, so I was looking for the blank ones and I came to the sympathy cards and, uh, I just was thinking like, you know what, I really want to stand up with Joe de Rosa again and then send him a sympathy card afterwards. You know, telling them I hope he feels better and everything and just basically, right. Joe, I saw your set last night. I know you're going through a rough time.

Speaker 1:          01:00:42       Okay.

Everybody a Billie bubbles, barely bubbles in the rain. Um, I went to high school with a guy who picks up my trash. I get along with them and I always wave and sometimes if he's not rushing, I'll have a short conversation with them. Last week I saw my neighbor yell at him. He wasn't a, he wasn't a jerk back, but he wasn't a dick either.

Speaker 2:          01:03:21       What? He wasn't a jerk back, but he wasn't a dick either. Later on that day, my neighbor came over and asked me if I'd make a statement about the issue that he harassed her. I saw the whole thing go down. He didn't harass her. She yelled at him for coming a day late during a week when a holiday pushed everything back a day in terms of sanitation pickup. Uh, what a comment. She said that even without my statement, she's going to press charges and file a complaint. I'm going to call the town or police and let them know what's going on. I'm so livid that she would ruin this guy's life. He's a great dude. Thoughts on how he should handle this? Should I report her for lying? APP's a fucking lately and I would take time off from work to testify that she's Elian Whore App's a fucking Luli.

Speaker 2:          01:04:08       Who the fuck yells at a trash man? The service that they're providing. Fuck her. Fuck her. Do you know something? I would 100% do it and I would, I would even fucking tell her that you're going to do it at some point. Not Not in the beginning because you don't want to. We can his case, but I would do it without a doubt. And when the whole fucking thing goes away, I would let her know that you did that and I would let her know what a small person you think she is and that she's disgusting and to stay away from you and anybody else that you love because she subhuman there. I was at the limit dilemma, Dear Bill. Oh, what a fucking whore. He came in day late and then you harassed me. Gee, you know what? You know what she I, you know what?

Speaker 2:          01:04:52       I bet she does for a living. She sounds like a blogger, always playing the fucking victim and always going down and just trying to get somebody in trouble and try and fuck over their, their ability, you know, to earn a living. What a fucking Twat. Alright, dear. Would you rather have to live in an air balloon for a month? Never having set down or would you rather live in a submarine? Never breathing the surface for a whole month. Both scare the shit out of me for a whole month, but I think I choose to submarine seems more natural. Yeah. And there's also a bathroom. I wouldn't want to have to shit on people. And P why would obviously wait until I was over a, a rural area.

Speaker 1:          01:05:40       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:05:41       Yeah. Plus you, you'd be inside, you'd have a bed p when you're in the summary, you have a blanket, you know, you get to be down there with all the fellow of, Hey, I'm no man. I mean, I think it would be cool to fucking look out the window and see all the fucking, uh, the sea life and all that shit. I would go fucking nuts down there. But, um, I don't know. Fucking up there in an air balloon gets cold or hot. You're really dealing with the fucking elements when you're up there and starts fucking raining. Um, yeah, I dunno. I W I would be a, I would get over that really quickly, but I think being in a sub, you know, you're down there, you could flake cards, you could fucking break each other's balls or whatever. I Dunno. Yeah, I definitely would take out a much rather do a sub. Um, and if I had to die the way, I'd rather die in a sub. I'd rather have it just fucking, you know, if you're going to die in the sub, it's going to be quick. You know, it's just over, right? Yeah. I don't know. Yeah. I don't know if sometimes maybe it might not be quick. They close that door. Yeah. Those are two terrifying things I got to go with you. Gotta go with you on that. Um,

Speaker 1:          01:07:02       yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:07:04       All right. Dilemma Billy bully. Uh, if you had to choose which holiday to get canceled and never celebrate again, would you choose Valentine's Day of President's Day? Who deserves more recognition, your girl for doing what you do all year without a holiday. That's hilarious. Yeah. We don't get a holiday. Um, no, maybe I read that wrong. Or presidents who may or may not be horrible people who hurt the country. I canceled president's Day because I'd rather keep the one that involved chocolate being around. Oh, that's a good reason for it. Um, if I had to get rid of one, I don't think anybody really celebrates president's Day. I don't really consider it a day off. It's kind of like flag day, you know what I mean? Or a buttermilk pancakes day isn't there one of those fucking days to um, Jesus, do you want me to cancel a holiday? Uh, I wouldn't cancel Valentine's Day just cause women like it so much. Believe it or not, I am a consequent. I'm not that fucking bad. So I, I'd keep that one. Yeah. You know what? Fuck President's Day. All those guys have bought and sold anyways. You've seen it with Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. You've seen how the Democrats had just going to pick her because going to play ball,

Speaker 3:          01:08:16       they are all tied into the fucking, the fucking, I dunno what you want to call it. Did she? She that Bernie Sanders is too fucking radical. He's going to switch shit up too much and then they're not going to work with them. Even if Bernie Sanders gets fucking elected, they're not gonna work with them. They're going to show their fucking true colors. They're a bunch of that. Just a bunch of, they're all bought and paid for it. They thought, well, how the fuck do that? Clinton's got $3 million to throw their kid a wedding. You know what I mean? Let me have fucking break. Because you went out and you gave speeches to all the people that fucking financed your campaign and then you hooked him up and look the other fucking way. I swear to God, I swear to God. Do you want to how the fucking pharmaceutical companies and the people who fucked up the food supplier able to do it and there's nothing, there's nothing behind it.

Speaker 3:          01:09:04       It's cause they fucking paid everybody off. I swear to God. All right, I'm on my stuff on my I, this is why I always vote for that third party guy. And everybody goes, Oh, you throw it away. You fucking vote. How is throwing away my fucking vote? Voting for somebody who's a decent fucking human being? I sweat it. Got People, they don't want to try to do what's right. They just want to win. They want to be like, oh my God. One again. See that every time I sit there and I trashed people for fucking given their public opinion, then look and make the gummy. I do the exact same thing. I am what's known as a hypocrite. The HIPAA count. Um, all right, that's the a, the podcast for this week. Um, I wanna thank everybody that came out. Cheyenne, Wyoming. I know there was last second, but uh, I had a great time.

Speaker 3:          01:09:49       Had a great time in your, uh, your state capitol. Um, Joe was just a really, really cool fucking town and I had a great time in the, uh, Cadillac ranch there. That sounds, I swear to God, like the fucking bunny ranch. It sounds like a fucking whorehouse, but it wasn't. Um, it was cool talking to the people there and thank you to everybody, you know, that bought me a beer and a shot and all that shit. Thank everybody Denver, by the way, which was just a fucking insane show. Um, that was another special one. Just cause I've done so many fucking gigs. Yeah. Colorado in the middle of nowhere. I always bring up Arapaho community college. I'll never forget that. Nooner where they had me standing in an area where three hallways met right before class ended. That was a fucking nightmare. Next to a popcorn machine and five people scattered out about 40 chairs, empty chairs. There's, um, anyways, that's the podcast for this week. Uh, I'm going to try to watch some Celtics and get caught up on the Bruins games, um, and keep drinking my juice. All right. Go Fuck Yourself. I'll talk to you later on this week.
