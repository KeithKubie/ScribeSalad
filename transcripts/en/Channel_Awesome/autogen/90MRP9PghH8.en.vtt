backwards in front well this this was
 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.430
backwards in front well this this was
supposed to feel like this if we had

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440
supposed to feel like this if we had
 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.980
supposed to feel like this if we had
more time or if we did this different or

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:09.990

appreciate even more how much they do
 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.640
appreciate even more how much they do
fit in and how much it is emotionally

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650
fit in and how much it is emotionally
 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.270
fit in and how much it is emotionally
satisfying majority of the time yeah um

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280
satisfying majority of the time yeah um
 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.469

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590
the pacing of this you know like
 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:26.660
the pacing of this you know like
especially the ending was

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:26.670
especially the ending was
 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:29.690
especially the ending was
as you know pretty adult but it just was

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700
as you know pretty adult but it just was
 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.870
as you know pretty adult but it just was
not the right character and possibly not

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880
not the right character and possibly not
 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.900
not the right character and possibly not
even the right story so yeah again

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:35.910
even the right story so yeah again
 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:37.670

the dream sequences I actually that's
 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.660
the dream sequences I actually that's
about the only thing I enjoyed about it

00:04:59.660 --> 00:04:59.670
about the only thing I enjoyed about it

I had this one was boring to me and I
 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.060
I had this one was boring to me and I
think part of it is because I really

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.070
think part of it is because I really
 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:10.610
think part of it is because I really
can't stand lemonhope that I just don't

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620
can't stand lemonhope that I just don't
 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.460
can't stand lemonhope that I just don't
care so if I don't care my mind wanders

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:13.470
care so if I don't care my mind wanders
 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:18.740
care so if I don't care my mind wanders
because I just I don't care I hear you a

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750
because I just I don't care I hear you a
 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.110
because I just I don't care I hear you a
lot when you say maybe if it was a

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120
lot when you say maybe if it was a
 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.210
lot when you say maybe if it was a
different character this could be so

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:23.220
different character this could be so
 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.310
different character this could be so
much more I I agree with you a hundred

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.320
much more I I agree with you a hundred
 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.530
much more I I agree with you a hundred
percent I think that's what they were

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:27.540
percent I think that's what they were
 

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.420
percent I think that's what they were
going for but for whatever reason

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.430
going for but for whatever reason
 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:32.360

lemonhope isn't doing it for me it's not

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:32.370
lemonhope isn't doing it for me it's not
 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:35.830
lemonhope isn't doing it for me it's not
doing it for you

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840
 
 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.220
 
that whole singing thing I mean it was

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:40.230
that whole singing thing I mean it was
 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:43.310
that whole singing thing I mean it was
okay and it probably means so much more

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:43.320
okay and it probably means so much more
 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.110
okay and it probably means so much more
but I think the issue for me personally

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120
but I think the issue for me personally
 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.730
but I think the issue for me personally
is that I just don't like it and I've

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740
is that I just don't like it and I've
 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:54.050
is that I just don't like it and I've
checked out like halfway through so by

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.060
checked out like halfway through so by
 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:55.670
checked out like halfway through so by
the time we get to this song and it was

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680

00:05:59.510 --> 00:05:59.520
no nevermind and it's like she finally
 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.560
no nevermind and it's like she finally
sings and it's like oh god yes okay

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:02.570
sings and it's like oh god yes okay
 

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:04.880
