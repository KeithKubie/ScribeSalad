00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.320
People living in Königsberg,

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.480
in what is now Russia or Poland...

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:06.400
Hard to say which.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.020
They had seven bridges across

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.800
two shores of the Pregel River and

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.380
there's [sic] two islands!

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.460
One island here...

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.540
An island over here...

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:16.360
Bluh

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.180
Bank over here,

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.360
bank over here.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.880
And they've got it set up

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.420
so that there's seven bridges.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.800
One, two... So you could go, you know,

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.120
you'll wanna walk over this way.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.980
You could take a horse
and bug over to that side,

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.200
cross over here,

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:33.660
cross over here,

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:35.500
and cross over here.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:36.740
One, two, three,

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.020
four, five, six, seven bridges!

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:45.080
People argued: "Can you take a Sunday walk and just cross every bridge once?"

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.440
So, I wanna go out someday

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.380
and just walk across this bridge,

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.000
walk across this bridge,

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.100
walk this bridge...

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.900
Ah, I'll go this way this time!

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:55.420
Walk across here,

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.400
walk across here... Oops!

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.880
I can't do it, 'cause I've already crossed those

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:00.920
and I've left one.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.620
I don't care where I start and where I stop.

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:07.680
But can I cross every bridge one time?

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.980
People argued about it.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.600
Nobody was able to do it.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.880
Euler's at Saint Petersburg, working for the tsars,

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.260
and he hears about this problem.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.700
And up until then people had said:

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.380
"Well, we have to make a list"

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.480
"of all possible ways to do this."

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.020
"We have to try here, go there..."

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.800
[sound of a series of choices]

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.500
And in this wonderful paper that Euler writes,

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:31.460
he says,

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.560
Trying to solve it, one at a time,

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.280
doesn't tell us anything new.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.760
It's today what we would call a numerical solution.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.380
That might give you an answer, but

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.060
it doesn't give you understanding.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.280
He's saying, "Hm, how do I do this, ahn?"

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.320
And then, he says,

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.480
"Think about ordinary bridges."

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.640
Every time I walk across a bridge onto an island,

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.060
I go from Blue to Polka Dot Land...

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.940
Oh, Blue to Polka Dot Land,

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.220
Polka Dot Land to Red,

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.920
the Red Shore over to Polka Dot Land...

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:10.560
Oh, okay.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.320
Euler resigned concentrating on the bridges,

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:14.600
starts saying,

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.460
"Look at the islands, look at the landmasses."

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.080
"Let's label those and think about that."

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.720
So he goes over and says,

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:23.300
"I'll label them."

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:24.480
Oh, okay.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.420
I'll label, what I call Polka Dot Ville,

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:28.620
I'll call that A.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.220
I'll reach my pocket and call that B over here.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.980
Over here, this side, let's call it C.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.080
And, oh! Look at this!

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.080
There's D.

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.580
I shouldn't be walking in the water.

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:40.980
I should just stay on the b...

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.080
In fact, I can't do that.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.940
I ought to just stay on the bridges the whole time.

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.140
Keep me honest, you, Brady. Ahn...

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.220
[Brady]: Oh, you stepped on the water.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.160
Oh! Opa pa pa!

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.240
Let's make it real simple.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.640
If I have nothing but

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.760
a bridge going from

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.420
C to D to B.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.900
Let's start from C to D.

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.180
Po po popopo...

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:06.740
Ok, that's legal.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.320
So I have C -&gt; D.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.180
Then I go from D to B.

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.440
Oh, it's D -&gt; B.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.940
Every time I get from one to another,

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.880
from one landmass to another landmass,

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:25.880
I can make a list -- of -- my -- travels.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.900
Oh! Oops, stay out of the water!

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.540
Euler says, "This means that"

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.040
"if I have even number of bridges,"

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.360
"one-one,"

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.580
"going into and out of an island,"

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.280
"that's completely legal."

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.180
I can go right through the island

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.280
if I have two or

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.640
if I have four bridges...

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.020
Oh, you can come across here, come across here,

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:54.780
back, over, and back.

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.980
But an *odd* number of bridges...

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:01.820
Okay...

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:03.680
I can come across here,

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.380
and come across here...

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:07.440
But I'm stuck!

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:10.780
Go this way, turn around,

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.280
but I haven't crossed this one.

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.080
Alternatively, I could start on yellow... on D,

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.800
walk this way, come back here,

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.160
and then walk out here.

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.040
Euler says, "Oh!"

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.420
"If I have an odd number of bridges"

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.540
"to any or from any island, I have to either"

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.620
"start my walk at that location"

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.960
"or end my walk at that location."

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:46.820
Right now,

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.600
island A has two bridges going to it.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:57.320
That means, oh, if I do not start on this island,

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.460
I can just traverse it.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.460
You know, Euler goes on and says,

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.560
"And if I start in that island,"

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:07.700
"I can go around -- blah, blah, blah"

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:09.360
"Vu vu vuf -- and return to it."

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.160
Even numbered islands,

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:16.300
islands that have an even number 
of bridges going to 'em.

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:18.400
I've got it made!

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.580
This makes it possible for me to -- to -- to--

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.620
almost eliminate them from my thought process.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.640
And it works whether it's

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.080
two, four, or even...

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:30.220
Or even six.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.720
Ok, got that one.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.920
Any landmasses, any place that has a

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.120
bridge connected to it,

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.000
if it has an even number of bridges -- oh!

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:40.540
Easy! Piece of cake.

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:42.940
If it has an odd number of bridges,

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:44.560
then it's a special case.

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:49.260
Clearly, if there is just one landmass

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.120
that has an odd number of bridges,

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.660
I can start on it,

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:00.000
but I won't be able
to get back to it to stop on it.

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:09.720
But if I have two islands that have
an odd number of bridges leading to them,

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:12.120
I can start on one, traverse around,

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:14.720
and then end on the other one.

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:19.740
Now, let's go back to what was really 
happening in Königsberg around 1725.

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:21.260
Seven bridges, remember?

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:23.540
Wasn't arranged like this.

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:24.040
It was...

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.500
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Ok.

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:27.480
Let me see...

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.160
[splashing water sound]

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.560
Let me see how I'm doing.

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.760
This section, the Red Shore,

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:35.580
what he calls C,

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:39.460
I have -- one, two -- three bridges from.

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:40.080
[Brady]: Odd.

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:41.800
Oh, it's and odd number!

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:43.360
Odd number!

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:44.420
Okay.

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:45.520
How about D?

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.380
Let go over D, island D.

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.080
One, two -- three bridges.

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.080
Oh, this is odd.

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.280
How about... The North Shore, B?

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.240
One, two, three -- odd number.

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:00.680
What about island A?

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:02.580
One, two, three, four -- five!

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:03.720
An odd number.

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:10.560
All of this landmasses have an
odd number of bridges leading to 'em.

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:12.960
Euler says, "Nuh-uh,"

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:16.060
"none of them have an even number of bridges."

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:17.340
"All are odd."

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:19.100
No matter where you start,

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:21.760
you cannot traverse all those bridges. ∎

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:25.500
Along, comes World War II: bomber attacks.

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:29.120
Horrible! Just a desperately horrible situation.

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:31.260
Two of these bridges get destroyed.

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:33.680
The town is devastated,

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:34.980
but at the end of the war,

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:37.580
there's five bridges left.

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:39.100
So, in a sense, today

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:41.220
there's no Seven Bridges of Königsberg anymore.

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:43.640
Not only there are not seven bridges,

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:46.520
the city of Königsberg doesn't exist.

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:49.440
It's been renamed to Kaliningrad.

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.540
It's a part of Russia today.

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:53.640
Or I think the Baltic Fleet works out of there.

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:56.420
And there's five bridges.

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:57.140
Well...

00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:02.140
Suppose you're sitting around in 
today's city.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.400
Could you do this?

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:08.220
Well, before even trying, let's just note:

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:11.180
C over here, node C,

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:15.900
this landmass of C, has two bridges today.

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:17.820
An even number.

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:20.340
Over there, the landmass B, the blue one,

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:22.780
has one, two bridges from it.

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:25.640
What about island A?

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:29.560
One, two, three bridges, an odd number.

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:32.580
Island D -- one, two -- three bridges.

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:39.100
Oh! Thus, today there is no problem!

00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:46.000
From what Euler said, we could
start on either of the odd-bridged islands.

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:48.100
So I can start here,

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:51.320
and I'll end there.

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:55.460
I have to choose a path that takes me
from here to there.

00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:56.920
Ok. I'll go like this:

00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:57.700
(Po po po po)

00:08:57.980 --> 00:08:59.220
Crossed one bridge.

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:00.880
Crossed two bridge.

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:03.000
I'll walk across my third bridge backwards.

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:06.460
Walk across the fourth bridge forwards,

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:08.920
back to where I started, but wait!

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:10.160
There's one more bridge.

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:11.400
(Po po po po)

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.280
I've traversed the entire path.

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:15.380
Started there, ended there.

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:18.380
Euler has told us that, if there are exactly

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:22.700
two islands that have an odd number of bridges,

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:26.540
you have to start on one of them
and end on the other one.

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:31.420
If there were three islands that had,
each had an odd number of bridges,

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:32.540
no way!

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:34.120
You couldn't solve the problem.

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:40.880
However, if each island had
an even number of bridges...

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:45.540
Suppose next week there's an earthquake.

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:49.140
At the Baltic Sea, it knocks down one bridge.

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:54.300
Now, every landmass has
two bridges going to it.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.200
And even I can figure it out,

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.580
oh, yeah, I can traverse them all.

00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:01.180
Here's the first one, here's the second one,

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:03.100
here's the third one, here's the fourth one.

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:05.560
I traversed them all without any problem at all.

00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:09.020
Ok, suppose we only have
three bridges today.

00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:10.580
[Brady]: Another earthquake.

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:11.860
Another earthquake happens!

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:13.340
Ahh! Another bridge falls down!

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:20.040
Now, Island A has one bridge
leading to it: an odd number.

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:25.380
North Shore B has two bridges
leading to it: even.

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:30.060
D over here, Island D has two bridges

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:34.000
and C, where I'm standing,
has only one bridge on it.

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:40.140
In this case, Euler tells us, yes,
we can still make a circuit

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:43.600
that crosses all three bridges

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:46.880
but we have to start on
an odd-numbered place

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:48.440
and end on an odd number. So,

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:50.760
I'm on the odd-numbered C,

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:52.840
there's only one bridge,
one is an odd number.

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:54.240
Okay -- (po po po po!)

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:55.200
Got to D.

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:56.560
D is an even one. Oh, ok.

00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:57.940
I'll walk across this one.

00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:58.860
(Pop pa!)

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:01.540
And then I get to B and, oh,

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:04.600
I can walk across this.

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:08.360
I end up on an odd-bridged island

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:10.260
and have completed traversed it.

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:15.120
If all the islands have an even number of bridges,

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:16.600
even everywhere!

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:19.440
Then, we're even-Steven, piece of cake.

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:22.580
You can make this traverse and 
everybody in the saloon,

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:24.580
in their Sunday walks, they're happy!

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:28.100
What if there's only one
odd-numbered island?

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:30.760
Turns out you can't make such a thing.

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:32.140
If I have...

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:35.280
Consider just one bridge.

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:39.920
I have an island here, oh,
it's got an odd number o' bridges.

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:42.940
But, oh, here's a second island
that has an odd number of bridges.

00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:43.860
I can't...

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:46.460
I could sort of send it up into the air

00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:49.080
or it could have, you know,
goes out into the water,

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:50.280
you walk the plank.

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:52.480
But no, for a legitimate bridge,

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:57.780
if there's one odd, there has to be
another matching somewhere on the graph.

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:02.420
So, Euler showed that this
bridge problem is kind of cool.

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:05.160
So if you're in a saloon or
going out on a Sunday walk,

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:08.940
it is nice to know -- oh, I can or can't
complete the circuit.

00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:10.060
Who cares?

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:16.800
Well, you can't pick up a book on
discrete mathematics...

00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:19.060
Discrete mathematics and its applications...

00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:20.960
Discrete mathematics and computer science...

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:22.720
Discrete mathematics with ducks...

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:26.680
You can't touch a book on this

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:28.560
without turning to a page

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:30.760
that has Euler on it!

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:33.480
And sure enough, over here,

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:38.080
"The Swiss mathematician, Leonhard Euler,
solves this problem -- blah blah blah"

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:41.540
Euler invented graph theory.

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:48.100
This is the first time, 1830 [sic],
that graph theory has been thought of.

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:52.580
And instead of analyzing this as a
"let's walk across bridges",

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:55.680
Euler recognized that...

00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:59.660
That connections from one place to another

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:03.420
were central to a part of mathematics.

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:05.320
Even cooler than that!

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:08.820
Euler said, "This is a geometric problem"

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:12.520
"that has no triangles, it doesn't have
hypotenuses in it."

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:16.840
It's what he called
a geometry problem of location.

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:20.960
This was the beginning of topology.

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:27.060
Euler's solution for this created graph theory.

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:31.940
Euler's solution to this created topology.

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:38.560
All this from a guy who,

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:40.420
"Oh, yeah, I got a little bit of time"

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:44.340
"to think about a problem that I heard about
from people going out on Sunday walks."

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:46.540
That's brilliant.

00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:48.560
