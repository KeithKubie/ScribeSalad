00:00:04.036 --> 00:00:05.738
Narrator: ATMs --

00:00:05.738 --> 00:00:09.776
THEY DELIVER THE MONEY
THAT MAKES THE WORLD GO AROUND.

00:00:09.776 --> 00:00:12.578
BUT HOW DOES AN ATM
MAKE SURE IT HANDS OUT

00:00:12.578 --> 00:00:15.749
THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF CASH
TO THE RIGHT PEOPLE?

00:00:18.818 --> 00:00:22.455
400 PARTS WORK TOGETHER --

00:00:22.455 --> 00:00:26.793
A SMART CARD READER
THAT CHECKS YOUR BALANCE...

00:00:28.594 --> 00:00:31.998
TWO SECURE VAULTS...

00:00:31.998 --> 00:00:36.001
THAT CAN HOLD 3,000 BILLS...

00:00:36.001 --> 00:00:38.571
HIGH-FRICTION ROLLERS

00:00:38.571 --> 00:00:42.542
THAT PICK JUST ONE BILL
AT A TIME...

00:00:42.542 --> 00:00:47.580
AND SENSORS THAT SPOT WHEN
A SECOND BILL SLIPS THROUGH.

00:00:49.582 --> 00:00:55.387
SUPER-STRONG WELDS FUSE TOGETHER
A 480-POUND STEEL CASE

00:00:55.387 --> 00:00:59.392
TO KEEP THE CASH SAFE
AND READY TO FLOW.

00:00:59.392 --> 00:01:03.229
AT THE HEART OF THE ATM
IS THE CONTROL PANEL

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:06.566
THAT MATCHES YOUR PIN
TO YOUR BANK ACCOUNT.

00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:09.502
THE ATM's CARD READER
AND MOTHERBOARD

00:01:09.502 --> 00:01:12.071
ACT AS GATEKEEPERS
BETWEEN THE PUBLIC

00:01:12.071 --> 00:01:15.408
AND THEIR BANK ACCOUNTS.

00:01:15.408 --> 00:01:18.244
ONCE THEY VERIFY A PIN,
THE MACHINE MUST DELIVER

00:01:18.244 --> 00:01:21.280
THE RIGHT NUMBER OF BILLS
AT BREAKNECK SPEED

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.950
WITHOUT A RIP OR A JAM.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.753
THIS IS HOW IT DOES IT.

00:01:28.721 --> 00:01:31.724
DEEP IN THE HEART
OF THE MACHINE,

00:01:31.724 --> 00:01:38.531
TWO STEEL CASSETTES
HOLD OVER 1,000 BILLS EACH.

00:01:38.531 --> 00:01:40.967
A SERRATED RUBBER ROLLER

00:01:40.967 --> 00:01:44.904
KICKS UP ONE BILL
FROM THE STACK...

00:01:44.904 --> 00:01:47.640
TO A PAIR OF SMOOTH ROLLERS

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.677
THAT FEED IT ONTO
A CONVEYOR BELT.

00:01:51.677 --> 00:01:55.848
A SENSOR CHECKS THAT BILLS
NEVER DOUBLE UP...

00:01:55.848 --> 00:01:58.151
SO THIS ROBOTIC TELLER...

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:05.191
CAN SPIT OUT UP TO FIVE BILLS
EVERY SECOND.

00:02:05.191 --> 00:02:10.796
AN ATM CAN CONTAIN UP
TO $300,000 IN CASH.

00:02:10.796 --> 00:02:13.899
HOW DOES IT KEEP THE CASH
IN THE SAFE

00:02:13.899 --> 00:02:18.538
BUT MAKE IT EASY TO REFILL
WHEN THE MONEY RUNS OUT?

00:02:18.538 --> 00:02:24.376
UNDER THE SKIN OF THE ATM
IS A 480-POUND BOX.

00:02:24.376 --> 00:02:27.847
ITS WALLS --
HALF AN INCH OF SOLID STEEL.

00:02:29.715 --> 00:02:33.986
THE DOOR HAS A SUPER WIDE BOLT
THAT RUNS ALONG ITS EDGE.

00:02:33.986 --> 00:02:36.022
THE ONLY WAY IN --

00:02:36.022 --> 00:02:39.993
A KEYPAD WITH
A MILLION COMBINATIONS.

00:02:39.993 --> 00:02:44.597
IT ROTATES TO RELEASE
A DEADLOCK...

00:02:44.597 --> 00:02:48.700
SO THE HANDLE CAN SWING
AN ALUMINUM PENDULUM

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.237
TO PULL BACK THE BOLT.

00:02:51.237 --> 00:02:55.608
IT'S LIKE FORT KNOX IN A BOX.
