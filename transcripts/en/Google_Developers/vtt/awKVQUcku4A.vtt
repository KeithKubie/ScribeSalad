KAI HALEY: All right.

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:05.100
Welcome.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.140
Thank you all for joining me.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.120
I'm very excited to be here
today to talk to you guys

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.970
about how design sprints
are flexing for success.

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:17.740
I wanted to start by
introducing myself.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.220
I'm Kai Haley.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.080
I'm a user experience
designer and I'm also

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.420
a lead of our Sprint
Master Academy at Google.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.300
How many of you are familiar
with design sprints?

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.620
Awesome.

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:34.270
How many have you been
in a design sprint?

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:35.160
Fantastic.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.130
That's really exciting.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.110
For those of you who are not
familiar with design sprints,

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.320
it's a framework, a
collaboration framework

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.770
for answering critical business
questions through design

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.900
prototyping and user research.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.570
And the Sprint Master
Academy is a program

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.230
we have at Google
for training people

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.640
to be sprint masters, to
lead and run design sprints.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.710
So I run the curriculum,
I create the curriculum

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.730
with a group of
passionate people,

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.420
and I've trained close
to 300 people at Google.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.880
I'm also a Sprint
Master and I run

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.380
a lot of sprints
for various teams

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.130
at Google, as well as outside
with our partners and startups

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:17.290
and even some nonprofits.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.010
So I'm really excited
and passionate

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.660
about this methodology and happy
to share it with you today.

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.210
I wanted to start
with a personal story.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.040
When I joined Google
five years ago,

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.520
my design and product
development cycle

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:32.990
looked a little bit like this.

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.810
Product manager would come to
me with a request or an idea

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.250
wanting me to make some mocks.

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.640
And I would ask them
a lot of questions

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.010
and try to figure out
what they wanted to do,

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.170
spend some time making the
mocks, maybe a week or two,

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.090
send it back to them.

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.630
Invariably there would
have been miscommunications

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.630
and we would need to make
another round of edits

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.060
or changes.

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.730
We would work on that,
and if I was really lucky,

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:02.330
we'd be good enough to send
it off to the development team

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.220
to be built.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.110
Usually the engineer
would have a lot of ideas

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.970
and a perspective as well,
and ask a lot of questions,

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.212
and sometimes even
send it back and say,

00:02:13.212 --> 00:02:14.920
there's no way we're
going to build this.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.140
Come on, guys.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.540
So this might take four weeks,
it might take five weeks,

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.570
and never at any
point in this process

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:25.130
did we take it to
our users and say,

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:26.305
do you guys even want this?

00:02:26.305 --> 00:02:27.680
Is this going to
meet your needs?

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.410
Is it going to solve
some of your pain points?

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.950
So you can see how
inefficient this process is.

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.510
It's not a great way
of collaborating,

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.490
and frustrating for
everybody involved.

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.080
I was lucky enough to
participate in the first sprint

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.050
week at Google.

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.370
The Ads and Commerce
team brought together

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.320
people from different
product areas

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.220
to spend a week focused
on innovating new ideas.

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.440
And this was really
inspiring and exciting to me.

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.570
I was so enthralled
with this process

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:01.820
that I volunteered to
become a sprint master

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.990
right at that moment
and started running

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.300
design sprints with my team,
with other teams at Google.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.120
And it really changed my
life and changed the way

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.720
that I work.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.700
So it's really amazing.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.260
And what it does is bring
product managers, UX designers,

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.131
researchers, developers all
into the conversation together.

00:03:22.131 --> 00:03:24.380
These perspectives are all
being added to the strategy

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.340
conversation at the beginning,
and this really increases

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:32.500
collaboration and improves
actually executable ideas,

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.870
because everyone's able to
put their input in together.

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.890
So it's really a
cross-functional process.

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.990
So today I want
to share with you

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:46.230
how you can use sprints in your
product development lifecycle

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.200
from idea all the way
to launch and beyond.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.750
I'm going to talk a little
bit at a high level about what

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.580
design sprints are and then
share three examples of how

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.180
teams are using sprints
to create success

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.564
for their products.

00:04:02.564 --> 00:04:03.730
So what is a designs sprint?

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.195
It sounds like a lot of you
are pretty familiar with this,

00:04:06.195 --> 00:04:08.440
so I'll try to go
through this quickly.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.920
As I mentioned before,
it's a framework

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.400
for answering a critical
business question.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.160
Maybe you want to know how
to increase your customer

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.220
acquisition.

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.519
Maybe you want to improve
specific small flow

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:23.880
of your product, like improve
your onboarding experience.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.060
Maybe you want to create a new
product and brand new vision.

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:28.894
Sprints can be
used for any stage.

00:04:28.894 --> 00:04:30.810
They can be used at the
beginning, the middle,

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.900
and as you evolve over time.

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.657
Really, it's a
shortcut to learning.

00:04:38.657 --> 00:04:40.490
Rather than going through
this process where

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:41.910
you start with an
idea, you spend

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.050
a lot of time building it
and getting it exactly right

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:46.820
and then launching
it out into the world

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:50.700
and learning at that point, we
shortcut that and get straight

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:51.380
to the learning.

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.360
And sprints allow us to do this.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.400
So where does this come from?

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.320
It was created at Google by
a couple of different people,

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.950
Jake Knapp, Nadya
Direkova, and some others,

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:06.280
and it's evolved over time
among different groups.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.460
But really it's a set of methods
that we've polled and selected

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.390
from the greatest hits of
business strategy, design

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:16.670
thinking, user research,
and even some psychology.

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:21.500
And we've ordered them in a
specific way, tested that order

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.840
to get it just
right so that we are

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.737
using the most effective methods
in the most effective way.

00:05:26.737 --> 00:05:28.320
And we've put them
into this framework

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.560
to support divergent
and convergent thinking.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.170
So you'll see
throughout this process

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:36.660
ways in which we diverge
and then converge again.

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.660
And we've tested this
for different goals

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:40.826
and different
deliverables over time.

00:05:40.826 --> 00:05:42.700
But the thing that really
makes it different,

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:45.740
and the thing that I have
found so valuable-- because I

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.650
did a lot of design thinking
prior to discovering sprints--

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:53.430
is that we set a clear goal
and a clear deliverable

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:54.490
at the beginning.

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:55.570
We time box it.

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:58.520
We don't spend a lot of time,
maybe at most five days.

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.140
And it's very user-centered.

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:03.610
We put the user at the
center of that process,

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:06.430
so we know that we're
building the right thing

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.460
for the right people,
and we do this very fast.

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.450
So the first phase,
understand, is

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:14.950
where the team gets together
and creates shared knowledge

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:16.260
and a shared brain.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.690
You map out the problem space.

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:21.930
And we do this by
inviting knowledge experts

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:23.320
to give lightning talks.

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.660
These are 10-minute,
really quick talks

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:28.680
on different aspects
of the problem space.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.470
So you might bring
in a business person

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:32.570
to talk about the
business opportunity.

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:35.630
You might look at
a competitor audit

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:38.220
of what the space looks like.

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:40.790
You might look at the
technological opportunity

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:42.510
or constraints.

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:45.780
You'll do an existing
audit, talk to users,

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:46.940
these sort of things.

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:49.900
The sprint master will
capture all of this content

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:53.061
that you're creating on
whiteboards and on the walls

00:06:53.061 --> 00:06:54.310
as you're creating the sprint.

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:56.760
So this is like the
visual brain that you're

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:59.300
using and pulling from
as you generate ideas

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:00.584
throughout the process.

00:07:00.584 --> 00:07:02.000
And we have some
different methods

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.390
for capturing these ideas.

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:06.440
One of them is called
the How Might We.

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:09.569
And this is a technique for
transforming pain points

00:07:09.569 --> 00:07:10.360
into opportunities.

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.010
We listen to our
users, and you might

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:17.960
hear them say
something like, oh, I

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:19.710
can't remember my passwords.

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:21.380
I have a really hard time.

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:23.400
I go to this website,
I go to that app,

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:25.110
and I just can't keep
track of them all.

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:26.651
The how might me
that you would write

00:07:26.651 --> 00:07:29.677
from that is, how might we help
making password entry easier?

00:07:29.677 --> 00:07:31.510
And so we're looking
for things that are not

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:33.114
too broad and not too narrow.

00:07:33.114 --> 00:07:35.530
But this is a way to capture
these opportunities as you're

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:36.904
listening to your
lightning talks

00:07:36.904 --> 00:07:39.310
or listening to your
user interviews.

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:41.840
We share these so
each team member,

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:44.610
each sprinter gets to
share out the opportunities

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:45.780
that they've captured.

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:47.010
And then we categorize them.

00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:48.140
We affinity map them.

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:50.220
And this helps us
to provide structure

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:52.400
to how we look at
the problem space,

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:54.159
and then allows us
to prioritize, what

00:07:54.159 --> 00:07:55.950
are the opportunities
that we should really

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:58.750
focus on to have the
most impact for our user?

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:01.620
And where are we going to
start sketching our ideas?

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:03.710
We also have a
user journey method

00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:07.530
that allows us to really get
into the mindset of our user.

00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:11.260
We look at their experience
from the first to all the way

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.190
through to the end,
experiencing with our product.

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:17.660
And this allows us to
surface pain points, which

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:19.660
is where we're pulling
those opportunities from.

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:21.600
What does the experience
look like today?

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.627
Where are the challenges
and the problems

00:08:23.627 --> 00:08:24.710
that our users are having?

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:26.820
How can we improve
that and create really

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:29.660
a better user journey for them?

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:31.760
The understand phase
usually concludes

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:35.150
with a team conversation
about what success looks like.

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:37.059
What should the success
of this product be,

00:08:37.059 --> 00:08:38.900
and how do we
drive towards that?

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:43.360
So we're all on the same page
working towards the same goal.

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.260
Then we move into
the sketch phase,

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.560
which is where-- this is
the diverging phase where

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:50.250
we're going to generate
a broad range of ideas.

00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:52.150
And we might start
off by looking

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:54.670
at a comparable problem.

00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:57.030
Often good ideas
are not new ideas.

00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:58.840
They're just borrowed
from other spaces.

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:01.960
So we might go and pull
in some examples of things

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:03.160
to inspire us.

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.450
We might do a
note-taking exercise

00:09:05.450 --> 00:09:07.150
where we collect our
thoughts, and this

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:09.730
is to prepare us for our
really, really fast sketching

00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:11.750
that we do called crazy eights.

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:14.920
We give people eight minutes
to sketch eight ideas.

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:16.390
And what this does
is help people

00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:18.219
get beyond their first idea.

00:09:18.219 --> 00:09:20.260
You really want to get to
a broad range of ideas,

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:22.870
and often you kind of get
stuck on that first one.

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:26.100
That time boxing motivates
people to come up

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:29.580
with a lot of ideas, and this is
really the individual ideation

00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:33.970
portion of the sprint and
where the meat of the creation

00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:35.190
happens.

00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:39.350
We close out the sketching
phase by narrowing down

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:42.000
to a very well-articulated
solution sketch

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.270
that each person will create.

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:44.820
And this is an
opportunity for people

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:47.930
to sketch out what
they think is the best

00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:49.150
solution to this problem.

00:09:49.150 --> 00:09:51.760
And then they take this
into the design phase,

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:54.560
where the team
decides, as a group,

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:57.304
what it is that they want to
build for their prototype.

00:09:57.304 --> 00:09:58.970
What do they need to
take to their users

00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:02.260
in order to get the learnings
that we're trying to get here?

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:05.200
And we use a number of
different methods for deciding.

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:07.990
We have a dot voting method,
where we give people three dots

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:11.244
and we say, pick
the thing that you

00:10:11.244 --> 00:10:13.660
think we should really build
that's going to have the most

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:15.170
impact for our users.

00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:16.900
Sometimes we'll do
a heat map voting

00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:19.880
where we let people vote
on specific features,

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:23.199
and this lets you
pull and choose

00:10:23.199 --> 00:10:25.240
from the variety of ideas
that have been created.

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:27.620
You don't have to just
commit to one idea.

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:30.140
And if you find you're getting
a lot of groupthink or people

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:32.590
are all sort of following
one or two people,

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:34.540
we have a note and
vote method that's

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:37.850
sort of like a secret voting,
which lets people express

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:40.890
their opinion and their
idea more authentically

00:10:40.890 --> 00:10:43.640
so we don't have as much
of this group think.

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:46.230
At the end of this
phase, the team

00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:47.890
has come to a
conclusion about what it

00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:49.410
is that they want to prototype.

00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:51.210
And moving into the
prototype phase,

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:54.296
they start off by
creating a storyboard.

00:10:54.296 --> 00:10:55.920
And the storyboard
is where you map out

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:58.510
exactly what you want to
build in your prototype.

00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:00.510
And this is done
as a group effort.

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:02.660
The important thing to
remember with prototyping

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:05.540
is, we're not building a
fully functioning prototype.

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:07.540
We're just creating a
real enough experience

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:10.200
to take it to our users to
get the feedback that we want.

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:12.940
So it's like a facade of
the idea that you have.

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:14.550
So if you're
creating an app, you

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:17.520
might just do a
set of static mocks

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:18.880
that you can click through.

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:22.280
Or if you're creating a
space or an experience,

00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:24.320
you'd want to try to
prototype that actual space

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:26.430
and give people a
feeling for what it is.

00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:31.350
You need to create the most
useful and real experience

00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:33.740
so that you can
get your learnings.

00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:35.710
And the important
thing here is we also

00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:37.340
do this really, really fast.

00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:40.010
We generally don't spend more
than a day on a prototype.

00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:42.650
So it's amazing what you
can accomplish in a day.

00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:46.310
And sometimes we'll even do
it in two or three hours.

00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:48.060
And then we move into
the validate stage,

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:51.515
and this is the
really exciting moment

00:11:51.515 --> 00:11:52.890
at the end of the
sprint when you

00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:54.700
get to take your
ideas to your users

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:56.380
and get that feedback
and that learning.

00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:58.580
And we encourage
everybody in the sprint

00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:01.620
to be there to get to
hear from their users

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:04.870
and see what their
experience is.

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:08.340
This is also a time when we
might bring in a stakeholder

00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:09.510
to get a stakeholder review.

00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:13.670
If you haven't had your
CEO in this context

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:15.500
of the whole sprint,
this is a great time

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:18.200
to get feedback and
validation from them.

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:21.170
And then you can also do a
technical feasibility review

00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:24.680
if you need special
engineering input to make sure

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:27.580
that what you designed
you can actually build.

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:29.204
This is a really
good time to do that.

00:12:29.204 --> 00:12:30.620
And this is the
end of the sprint.

00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:33.050
And at this point, you've
got some really good ideas

00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:34.010
on how to move forward.

00:12:34.010 --> 00:12:36.270
And you may end up deciding
to run another sprint,

00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:38.440
but at this point, you've
got some learnings.

00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:40.830
You know what it is
that you want to build,

00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:43.490
and you can take the next step.

00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:45.860
Space is really
important for sprints.

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:49.280
Conference rooms are not
great for creativity.

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:52.650
So we have a couple different
types of spaces at Google.

00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:54.940
This is our garage, which
is a maker space where

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:56.390
we run a lot of our sprints.

00:12:56.390 --> 00:12:58.330
And it's a really
fantastic place to work.

00:12:58.330 --> 00:13:01.390
Gets people out of their chairs,
standing, working together,

00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:03.300
writing on whiteboards,
and not just sitting

00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:05.460
at desks falling asleep.

00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:12.150
So many of you, maybe, have
heard of the Google Ventures

00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:14.020
Sprint book that's out there.

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:15.990
They have a five-day model.

00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:19.400
And if you're a startup and
this is your only product

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:22.290
that you're working on,
spending five days on it

00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:25.590
makes a ton of sense
and is a great use

00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:29.830
of your time to save yourself
weeks and weeks of development

00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:30.520
time.

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:32.050
At Google we have
product teams that

00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:33.970
are working on many
different products,

00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:35.800
so it can be hard to
get everybody together

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:36.970
for five days.

00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:40.690
So sometimes we'll adjust
the schedule a little bit

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:42.780
to accommodate the
needs of our team.

00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:45.100
We'll do some advance
work, some planning.

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:46.780
We'll pull those
lightning talks in.

00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:48.940
We'll pull in all the research.

00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:50.950
And we'll adjust and
compress the amount of time

00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:54.450
we spend on our methods to
meet the needs of the team.

00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:56.190
And sometimes we
might even go down

00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:58.274
to two days or even one day.

00:13:58.274 --> 00:13:59.940
There are some one-day
examples that I'm

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:01.260
going to share with you today.

00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:02.720
And in here, the
important thing is

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:04.650
that we are getting validation.

00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:06.870
We may just not be getting
it within that one day.

00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:09.510
We'll do it later, or
we'll look at other ways

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:10.760
to get that user validation.

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:14.685
But the user validation is
really, really important.

00:14:14.685 --> 00:14:16.060
And the way we're
able to do this

00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:18.720
is because we have
our sprint masters.

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:22.700
And as I mentioned before,
we have at least 300 now.

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:24.970
And they're all trained
in these methods,

00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:27.270
and they know how to work
with the product teams.

00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:30.590
They help them define their
goals and their deliverables

00:14:30.590 --> 00:14:32.630
and then adjust the
schedule and the agenda

00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:36.500
to be realistic to reach
those goals and deliverables.

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:38.190
So every sprint
has a sprint master

00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:40.810
who is the facilitator
who works with the team

00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:42.090
to make this happen.

00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:45.560
And also depending on where you
are in your product life cycle,

00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:48.206
you might be at the
beginning, where

00:14:48.206 --> 00:14:49.580
you're doing a
project initiation

00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:50.890
and you might need more time.

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:53.809
Or you might have
a new forming team,

00:14:53.809 --> 00:14:55.600
so you might also have
collaboration needs.

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:58.120
If you've been working
together for a long time,

00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:00.420
you might have different
needs for what methods

00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:03.810
you want to utilize.

00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:05.960
So the first example I want
to share with you today

00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:10.280
is for a team that used sprints
at every stage in their product

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:13.250
life cycle, from
project initiation

00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:15.180
all the way to launch.

00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:17.610
And this is a product
called Google Home Services

00:15:17.610 --> 00:15:19.190
which recently launched.

00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:22.590
It connects consumers to
qualified local service

00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:23.090
providers.

00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:26.520
So if you need a dishwasher
repairman to come to your house

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:29.230
and fix your dishwasher,
Google Home Services

00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:32.710
can help connect you to
somebody appropriate and nearby

00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:34.520
in an easy way.

00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:37.880
This idea came out of
the 2014 Sprint Week,

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:42.100
where we brought together
150 people for a week working

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:44.370
on 23 different
product ideas ranging

00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:49.020
from moonshots and brand new
products to evolving existing

00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:49.970
products.

00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:53.620
And the team was
focused on creating

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:56.420
a vision for the full
product experience.

00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:59.400
And they really wanted to take
this to stakeholders for buy-in

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:01.680
to get project kickoff.

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:04.710
So they needed a vision deck
as their deliverables and high

00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:08.080
fidelity mocks of the key
moments that articulated

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:10.670
that full narrative.

00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:13.910
They were looking at what the
experience was like today,

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:17.850
what it should be in a year,
two years out, and even four

00:16:17.850 --> 00:16:18.380
years out.

00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:23.490
So they were really looking
at ideal experience over time.

00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:25.900
They started by understanding
the problem space,

00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:28.810
doing lightning talks, inviting
some experts to come and talk

00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:32.259
to them about what the
experience was like now, what

00:16:32.259 --> 00:16:34.300
the competitive space was
like, what the business

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:36.990
opportunity was
like, thinking about

00:16:36.990 --> 00:16:39.770
technological requirements.

00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:45.410
We generated how might we's
and prioritized and categorized

00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:46.330
them.

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:50.797
They sketched ideas for what
the different states would

00:16:50.797 --> 00:16:53.380
be in those key moments and what
the overall experience should

00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:54.360
look like.

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:58.340
And they took these early
stage sketches to their users

00:16:58.340 --> 00:16:59.749
to get early validation.

00:16:59.749 --> 00:17:01.290
Because it was a
brand new idea, they

00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:03.248
wanted to be sure they
were on the right track.

00:17:03.248 --> 00:17:06.140
Before they even started making
their full-fledged mocks.

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:08.381
They said, does
this fit your needs?

00:17:08.381 --> 00:17:09.839
Is this going to
fit into your flow

00:17:09.839 --> 00:17:11.589
of trying to find a plumber?

00:17:11.589 --> 00:17:14.740
And then they responded
to that feedback,

00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:17.690
started working on their
mocks and their prototypes,

00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:20.310
and looking at how can
we help them diagnose

00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:22.740
the problem-- this was
a big pain point that

00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:25.670
came out-- and ended
up with a vision deck

00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:27.420
that they took back
to their stakeholders.

00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:29.630
And this project was approved.

00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:30.880
The vision deck did its job.

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:33.004
Everyone said, wow, this
is a really great concept.

00:17:33.004 --> 00:17:35.685
We absolutely need
to invest in this.

00:17:35.685 --> 00:17:37.830
The schedule for
this sprint, so you

00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:40.210
can take a look at how
this framework has flexed

00:17:40.210 --> 00:17:42.930
a little bit, was three days.

00:17:42.930 --> 00:17:45.800
And they spent the first day
understanding and sketching.

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:48.290
Early validation on day two.

00:17:48.290 --> 00:17:51.070
More sketching, and then
deciding and prototyping

00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:53.540
on the last day.

00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:56.630
After this they
ran another sprint

00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:59.670
to look at the
experience from searching

00:17:59.670 --> 00:18:01.700
for a provider to booking
a provider, so just

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:04.800
a small slice of the
product experience.

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:07.467
They really wanted to diverge
and get a broad range of ideas,

00:18:07.467 --> 00:18:09.550
and they wanted to make
sure they were considering

00:18:09.550 --> 00:18:14.870
all the different aspects of
this particular set of flows.

00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:17.540
And they wanted very
low-fidelity deliverables

00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:20.880
for this, user flows
and sketch mocks.

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:23.740
So they identified what were
the steps, what was the piece

00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:26.740
that they wanted to solve for.

00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:29.230
They reviewed existing
research that they'd

00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:32.432
done before, a lot of
reminding themselves of,

00:18:32.432 --> 00:18:34.140
these were the pain
points and the things

00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:38.670
that we heard, reviewing
competitor experiences, what

00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:41.670
was good about that, what
was not so good about that.

00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:44.369
They generated how might
we's and prioritized those.

00:18:44.369 --> 00:18:45.660
Where should we focus for this?

00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:48.240
What are the best ideas
that we have here?

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:49.580
Sketches.

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:52.010
And then sketches were really
where they ended the sprint.

00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:55.264
And the UX team took
this back to their desks

00:18:55.264 --> 00:18:57.180
and started actually
building mocks from this.

00:18:57.180 --> 00:18:59.990
So this was kind of a
little turbo boost, more

00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:03.290
of a brainstorming workshop.

00:19:03.290 --> 00:19:05.400
The schedule for
this was a one-day

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:08.000
because they were looking
for pretty low fidelity.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.250
They spent the first portion
of the day understanding,

00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:12.590
and then sketching
and prototyping

00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:14.980
in the second half of the day.

00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:17.240
The third sprint
that they ran was

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:20.530
to design the end-to-end
assistive experience,

00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:22.730
so helping people to
diagnose their problem,

00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:26.700
helping them to connect
with a good provider,

00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:29.955
and for both sets of audiences,
consumers and providers.

00:19:29.955 --> 00:19:31.910
So they had two users.

00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:35.390
And they wanted a
high-level user journey map

00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:38.730
that would let them create
a prioritized project plan,

00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:41.550
figuring out what exactly do
we have to build for launch,

00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:44.430
and what can we save for later?

00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:47.240
They all got together, reviewed
their use cases, thought

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:50.200
about the goals for the sprint,
what do we need to cover here?

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:52.470
They spent time
thinking about what

00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:54.710
are the needs for
each user, generating

00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:58.460
how might we's for the
providers versus the consumers.

00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:00.170
They even did some
more user interviews

00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:02.320
because they wanted to
fill in the gaps on things

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:04.220
that they had missed before.

00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:07.510
And then they created end-to-end
user-- very, very detailed user

00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:08.010
journeys.

00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:12.180
And they identified specific
steps in the process,

00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:13.960
and this helped
them to prioritize.

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:14.960
Well, maybe we
don't have to worry

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:16.960
so much about the grow
at the end or the promote

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:17.870
at the beginning.

00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:20.080
To get to launch, we need
to focus on this here

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:20.800
in the middle.

00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:23.670
And that was something that
the team really needed in order

00:20:23.670 --> 00:20:25.650
to move forward.

00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:28.480
So they did this in
a day and a half.

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:31.840
They spent half of the first day
understanding and figuring out

00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:34.510
what they wanted to create,
sketching, deciding,

00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:36.060
and then prototyping
and validating

00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:37.559
with the rest of
the team afterwards

00:20:37.559 --> 00:20:40.730
and creating that project map.

00:20:40.730 --> 00:20:43.000
The launch product is
on the search page.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.330
You can go search for
a plumber near you now,

00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:49.360
and you'll get an assistive
UI that will take you

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:51.550
into an immersive experience
that will help you

00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:53.640
find a plumber for your needs.

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:55.730
And then you can also
do this on desktop.

00:20:55.730 --> 00:20:57.770
And it really helps
people to connect

00:20:57.770 --> 00:20:59.022
with multiple providers.

00:20:59.022 --> 00:21:00.480
And that was one
of the pain points

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:02.310
that came out of all
of their interviews,

00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:06.040
was managing all of
these different plumbers

00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:08.010
is actually really
difficult. So they

00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:12.610
solved for some of those key
problems with this product.

00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:16.000
And they utilized these
sprints at the beginning

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.140
for the kickoff, in the
middle as a turbo boost,

00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:21.920
and then towards the end
to prioritize what they

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:24.340
needed to build for launch.

00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:26.250
And the outcomes were,
as I mentioned before,

00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:29.570
generating approval to
initiate the project, really

00:21:29.570 --> 00:21:31.240
creating a shared
vision for the team

00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:34.060
to help them know
what they were working

00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:37.700
towards over the long term,
giving a little turbo boost

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:40.170
in the middle to their
design, and then innovating

00:21:40.170 --> 00:21:43.400
ideas towards the end for the
full end-to-end experience.

00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:47.900
The second example I
want to share with you

00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:52.280
is for a team that used a sprint
to actually start a completely

00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:53.740
brand new business.

00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:55.530
It was a Project Kickoff.

00:21:55.530 --> 00:21:58.100
And the business is
called HarvestPort.

00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:02.670
It is a marketplace for
sharing agricultural assets

00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:06.350
like vegetable bins and farming
equipment and stuff like that,

00:22:06.350 --> 00:22:08.710
allowing people to monetize
when they're not using it

00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:10.810
in the offseason.

00:22:10.810 --> 00:22:13.120
And they wanted to define
that product offering

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:15.584
for the new asset
sharing marketplace

00:22:15.584 --> 00:22:17.250
and create a shared
vision for the team.

00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:20.040
So they had an idea, but they
really wanted to figure out,

00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:22.960
what is this idea and what
does this space look like?

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:25.710
They wanted user flows
and high fidelity mocks

00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:28.590
that they could then take
and build from later.

00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:33.410
So they were looking for
a mid-level of fidelity.

00:22:33.410 --> 00:22:38.690
We all came together and
invited lightning talk speakers,

00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:40.799
experts from the
agricultural industry,

00:22:40.799 --> 00:22:43.340
to come talk to us about what
the business opportunity really

00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:45.830
was, what the
existing systems were,

00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:47.769
what the competitive
space looked like.

00:22:47.769 --> 00:22:50.060
And one of the really fantastic
things about this brand

00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:52.550
is that we actually had
farmers-- there are two of them

00:22:52.550 --> 00:22:56.470
in this picture here-- with
us for the entire sprint,

00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:59.110
creating how might we's
and sketching with us.

00:22:59.110 --> 00:23:01.280
And this gave us this
constant validation

00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:03.940
as we were working together.

00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:07.310
We also interviewed some
potential customers.

00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:08.982
So we did the user
interviews as well

00:23:08.982 --> 00:23:11.190
to get a sense of, what was
the environment that they

00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:11.970
were working in?

00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:14.280
What are their Wi-Fi
connections like?

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:16.540
What are their
technological capabilities?

00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:19.240
And this really helped
us to understand

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:22.260
the broad base of users.

00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:27.770
We generated how might we's and
prioritized those, and created

00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:30.910
user flows looking at, what is
the experience for the lender?

00:23:30.910 --> 00:23:33.850
What is the experience
for the borrower?

00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:37.520
Sketched ideas for what the
UI would look like for this

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:40.280
and shared out those sketches.

00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:44.200
And then as the team decided,
what do we actually really want

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:46.920
to make mocks of for this team?

00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:49.570
What is our prototype
going to be?

00:23:49.570 --> 00:23:52.480
So we voted and decided
as a team on that,

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:55.520
and then had UXers
working really, really

00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:59.000
fast to create these mocks to
show what the experience might

00:23:59.000 --> 00:23:59.500
look like.

00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:02.120
And I think our prototyping for
this was like two hours, maybe

00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:03.940
an hour and a half.

00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:06.590
And so we created mocks
that show how might you

00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:10.910
represent your assets, how are
you going to search for them

00:24:10.910 --> 00:24:14.396
and suggest pricing
or post them?

00:24:14.396 --> 00:24:15.270
These sort of things.

00:24:15.270 --> 00:24:18.340
And you can see the
fidelity is pretty good.

00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:23.350
The team was launched
recently, in the last couple

00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:28.000
months, so a year from project
initiation to marketplace

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:28.500
launch.

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:32.810
And if you have any vegetable
bins that you want to monetize,

00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:37.260
you can sign up here now and
offer them to the community.

00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:40.160
Their structure was--
this was a one-day,

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:42.230
so we accomplished
a lot in one day.

00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:44.372
And one of the reasons
we were able to do this

00:24:44.372 --> 00:24:46.330
is that we actually had
our users in the sprint

00:24:46.330 --> 00:24:50.250
with us, so we were validating
through the whole process.

00:24:50.250 --> 00:24:52.800
And it was really,
really fantastic.

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:56.620
This sprint was the kickoff,
but they took this with them

00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:58.760
as they formed their team
and started the company

00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:02.430
and started utilizing this
process over and over again

00:25:02.430 --> 00:25:03.500
until they got to launch.

00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:06.850
So they definitely embraced it.

00:25:06.850 --> 00:25:09.790
And the CEO was so
excited by this process.

00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:14.030
He was really impressed with
how it could be spontaneous yet

00:25:14.030 --> 00:25:18.150
really structured and focused
and keep us on strategic course

00:25:18.150 --> 00:25:22.500
the whole time while still
allowing for that creativity.

00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:24.850
So the outcomes were, we
created a shared vision

00:25:24.850 --> 00:25:27.400
for the product, really
galvanized the team

00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:30.770
and brought them together,
and formed the company.

00:25:30.770 --> 00:25:32.800
Also secured their
largest investor

00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:35.476
and key advisory board, which
is a pretty unusual thing

00:25:35.476 --> 00:25:36.475
to come out of a sprint.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.050
The last example I want
to share with you today

00:25:41.050 --> 00:25:44.020
is focused on UX and
engineering collaboration.

00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:46.850
This is a team at Google
called Firebase Analytics.

00:25:46.850 --> 00:25:49.160
Some of you guys might
be familiar with it.

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:53.860
And the UX designer
and the developer

00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:55.914
were feeling a
little bit like this.

00:25:55.914 --> 00:25:58.080
They felt like they weren't
communicating that well.

00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:00.962
They didn't really understand
each other's roles and the work

00:26:00.962 --> 00:26:03.170
that they were doing, and
they felt like they weren't

00:26:03.170 --> 00:26:05.150
collaborating that effectively.

00:26:05.150 --> 00:26:07.879
The UX designer said, why
don't we run a sprint?

00:26:07.879 --> 00:26:10.170
I think this would be a really
great opportunity for us

00:26:10.170 --> 00:26:12.450
to improve our collaboration.

00:26:12.450 --> 00:26:14.974
And the engineer looked
at the framework and said,

00:26:14.974 --> 00:26:16.390
well, that sounds
cool, but can we

00:26:16.390 --> 00:26:20.760
really focused on collaboration
rather than user validation,

00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:24.430
and pull the methods that
emphasize collaboration.

00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:30.070
So their goal was to explore
and build new interactions

00:26:30.070 --> 00:26:31.920
and experiences
for their product,

00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:34.670
but to do it together,
so with engineers

00:26:34.670 --> 00:26:36.920
as opposed to the designers
off creating ideas

00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:39.840
and then throwing
it over the fence.

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:42.090
And their deliverables
were a set of features,

00:26:42.090 --> 00:26:43.830
prototypes, and a
game plan for how

00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:46.800
they were going to work
together moving forward.

00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:49.790
They decided to give
their sprint its own name.

00:26:49.790 --> 00:26:50.800
They called it a blitz.

00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:54.080
And because it was wintertime
and their team nickname

00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:56.480
was Snowman, they
called it a blitzard.

00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:58.990
And they wrapped up the
sprint by going to DQ

00:26:58.990 --> 00:27:02.820
and getting a special
blizzard made for them.

00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:04.930
They really wanted to
create a safe sandbox

00:27:04.930 --> 00:27:08.170
where they could brainstorm
together effectively.

00:27:08.170 --> 00:27:13.250
So they all got together and
created shared knowledge,

00:27:13.250 --> 00:27:17.760
had lightning talks, brought in
information about their users,

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:21.190
really took a look at what
were the pain points of them,

00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:23.250
what problems were they having.

00:27:23.250 --> 00:27:27.120
And they did this
sketching and prototyping,

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:30.400
sketching and prototyping
sort of structure,

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:32.820
sharing back with each other
after they started creating

00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:35.320
ideas throughout the process.

00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:40.320
So a much more cyclical cycle.

00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:42.060
Cyclical cycle.

00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:46.890
Their schedule looked like this,
where they spent the first day

00:27:46.890 --> 00:27:49.360
on a small portion
of understand,

00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:51.600
and then sketching and
prototyping and sharing back,

00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:52.850
and sketching and prototyping.

00:27:52.850 --> 00:27:55.820
And they found this to be a
really, really effective method

00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:58.090
for them.

00:27:58.090 --> 00:28:02.190
They have started
using this repeatedly

00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:03.190
throughout their cycle.

00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:06.760
So they did one in the fall.

00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:08.670
They had another
one a month ago,

00:28:08.670 --> 00:28:11.040
and they found that
they pull it in whenever

00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:14.810
they need some focused
time to really inject speed

00:28:14.810 --> 00:28:17.240
into their process.

00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:19.890
And the UX designer
and developer

00:28:19.890 --> 00:28:21.550
feel a little bit
more like this now.

00:28:21.550 --> 00:28:23.890
They have a better understanding
of each other's working

00:28:23.890 --> 00:28:25.670
methodology, their roles.

00:28:25.670 --> 00:28:27.810
And when the developer
is coding and he's

00:28:27.810 --> 00:28:31.540
coming across UI challenges
that haven't been resolved,

00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:33.940
he'll now walk over to
the UX designer's desk

00:28:33.940 --> 00:28:36.560
and say, hey, let's solve
this together instead

00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:38.640
of sort of working in silos.

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:42.020
So it's been really fantastic
for their collaboration

00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:44.000
and for their innovation.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.780
So the outcomes are a
deeper understanding

00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:47.400
of each other's work.

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:50.220
The designers become a lot
less precious about design,

00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:53.340
not fixating too much on
getting it exactly right,

00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:56.190
but trying to get through
an iteration process faster.

00:28:56.190 --> 00:28:58.730
And it's changed the way
they think about prototyping.

00:28:58.730 --> 00:29:01.470
They said prior to this
process, they kind of

00:29:01.470 --> 00:29:03.767
thought about prototyping
as a throwaway activity.

00:29:03.767 --> 00:29:05.850
You're building something,
but you're not actually

00:29:05.850 --> 00:29:08.610
going to use that in
your live product.

00:29:08.610 --> 00:29:12.250
And so they're trying to shorten
that gap between prototyping

00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:13.320
and building.

00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:17.330
And this allowed them to
decrease the time from idea

00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:19.740
to mock to prototype,
and to increase

00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:22.130
the number of executable
ideas, because they're really

00:29:22.130 --> 00:29:23.950
focused in on, is this viable?

00:29:23.950 --> 00:29:25.930
Is this a good idea?

00:29:25.930 --> 00:29:29.070
And created a strong sense
of ownership with the team.

00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:31.080
Everyone really
had an investment

00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:34.780
in the ideas that were created.

00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:36.750
So you can see how
we're shortcutting

00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:41.880
getting from idea to learn fast,
and doing this over and over

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:45.190
and over again
throughout our process

00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:49.390
to really get to an
effective innovation method.

00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:53.970
And we don't approach sprints
in a cookie cutter way.

00:29:53.970 --> 00:29:57.880
No two sprints are the same no
two sprinting team is the same.

00:29:57.880 --> 00:29:59.810
Every product has
different needs.

00:29:59.810 --> 00:30:02.440
And it's a flexible
framework that we use.

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:05.370
Based on the goals and the
deliverables of the team,

00:30:05.370 --> 00:30:08.710
we can adjust in order
to meet those goals.

00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:12.070
So it's a really,
really fantastic method.

00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:15.220
And if you're going to start
thinking about running sprints

00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:18.164
with your teams, it's
important to understand

00:30:18.164 --> 00:30:19.080
what they're good for.

00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:21.310
They're really great
for user validation,

00:30:21.310 --> 00:30:25.370
really fantastic for
speed and collaboration.

00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:27.370
So thinking about how
you want to structure

00:30:27.370 --> 00:30:29.150
your sprint for those needs.

00:30:29.150 --> 00:30:31.630
And hopefully I've given
you some inspiration

00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:35.670
to try this with your teams.

00:30:35.670 --> 00:30:38.710
Some of you may have read the
book that Google Ventures wrote

00:30:38.710 --> 00:30:39.490
called "Sprint."

00:30:39.490 --> 00:30:41.280
It's a really fantastic read.

00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:42.890
I encourage you to get it.

00:30:42.890 --> 00:30:46.730
We also have a playbook
on developer relations.

00:30:46.730 --> 00:30:49.780
And design.google.com has
a lot of great content

00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:52.620
that we'll be updating there
for sprints in the future.

00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:55.440
So stay in touch with us there.

00:30:55.440 --> 00:31:02.341
And I think we have time
for Q&amp;A. So questions.

00:31:02.341 --> 00:31:02.840
Yes.

00:31:05.756 --> 00:31:06.548
Should we use the--

00:31:06.548 --> 00:31:08.172
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah,
if you guys could

00:31:08.172 --> 00:31:11.102
go to the microphone in the
center of the room for Q&amp;A,

00:31:11.102 --> 00:31:13.585
that'd be great.

00:31:13.585 --> 00:31:15.460
AUDIENCE: Thank you for
the wonderful speech.

00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:19.330
I have a question that trying
approach the design sprint

00:31:19.330 --> 00:31:21.330
into our current company.

00:31:21.330 --> 00:31:23.730
And in order to
make that happen,

00:31:23.730 --> 00:31:26.230
I think one of
challenges is that really

00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:30.110
make the decision makers
onboard about the design sprint.

00:31:30.110 --> 00:31:35.070
For example, the decision maker
may involve a CEO or as COO

00:31:35.070 --> 00:31:40.126
or a CPO who potentially
they didn't see directly

00:31:40.126 --> 00:31:44.020
value before this design
sprint actually went out.

00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:47.700
And also I think another
challenge for my company

00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:50.220
is we have very
tight release cycles,

00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:54.720
and also our company's very
data-driven, so in that sense

00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:56.780
that everything
should be communicated

00:31:56.780 --> 00:32:01.550
in a way that have a direct
impact in certain KPIs.

00:32:01.550 --> 00:32:06.380
So I think I talked to
several designer in this room,

00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:09.590
so it looks like this is
a really common issues

00:32:09.590 --> 00:32:12.260
among a lot of tech companies.

00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:15.570
Just wondering how do you
guys solve this problem.

00:32:15.570 --> 00:32:18.190
How do you align everyone
into this design sprint

00:32:18.190 --> 00:32:22.214
in the very beginning, make sure
they are willing to be involved

00:32:22.214 --> 00:32:22.880
and participate.

00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:25.070
The [? delegated ?]
to the outcomes

00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:28.690
they may achieve by the end.

00:32:28.690 --> 00:32:29.680
KAI HALEY: Thank you.

00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:32.480
That was a very long question.

00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:36.700
I think what you're asking is,
how do we get everybody there,

00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:39.950
and how do we justify
them dedicating the time?

00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:41.330
Is that correct?

00:32:41.330 --> 00:32:44.210
Because we actually
do, at Google,

00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:47.272
have metrics showing that
this has increased innovation.

00:32:47.272 --> 00:32:48.730
It's increased the
number of ideas.

00:32:48.730 --> 00:32:50.105
It's decreased
the amount of time

00:32:50.105 --> 00:32:52.479
we spend going round
and round in cycles.

00:32:52.479 --> 00:32:54.020
And it's decreased
the amount of time

00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:56.260
we spend building things
that users don't want.

00:32:56.260 --> 00:32:58.780
So in terms of
being data-driven,

00:32:58.780 --> 00:33:01.220
we have data to show
that, which helps.

00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:04.480
And we've been
testing and utilizing

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:07.390
this methodology for the
last two and 1/2 years.

00:33:07.390 --> 00:33:09.480
And so we've seen a lot
of fantastic results.

00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:12.160
Being able to tell
people that this

00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:14.990
is what it will accomplished
for you helps to get them there.

00:33:14.990 --> 00:33:19.300
We can't always get stakeholders
into the sprint itself.

00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:21.840
But we involve them
in the beginning,

00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:23.720
at the understand
phase, and then we

00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:24.987
have a check-in at the end.

00:33:24.987 --> 00:33:27.570
So they don't have to dedicate
three days or four days or five

00:33:27.570 --> 00:33:28.070
days.

00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:31.157
We just make sure that they're
there for the initiation

00:33:31.157 --> 00:33:33.740
and that they've signed off on
the goals and the deliverables.

00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:36.170
And so we'll have some planning
meetings at the beginning

00:33:36.170 --> 00:33:38.150
to get buy-in from everybody.

00:33:38.150 --> 00:33:40.684
This is what we want to
dedicate our time towards,

00:33:40.684 --> 00:33:42.600
and this is the outcome
that it's going to be.

00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:44.420
And everyone agrees
to that beforehand.

00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:47.222
And that helps people to
actually come to the sprint,

00:33:47.222 --> 00:33:49.430
because they know this is
what we're going to create.

00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:51.170
And we actually
really do need this.

00:33:51.170 --> 00:33:54.240
So that's the way
that we approach it.

00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:56.749
Does that make sense?

00:33:56.749 --> 00:33:57.290
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:33:57.290 --> 00:33:59.980
So you mentioned the
design sprint book.

00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:04.089
And I was just wondering how
related to the design sprint

00:34:04.089 --> 00:34:05.880
book that came out last
year from O'Reilly,

00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:10.690
if they were similar or related,
this is the same process?

00:34:10.690 --> 00:34:12.780
KAI HALEY: You know,
I just got that book.

00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:16.889
So I can't really speak to
the origin of that book.

00:34:22.590 --> 00:34:24.120
Most of this is in there.

00:34:24.120 --> 00:34:29.370
So I'm under the impression that
they pulled it from some teams

00:34:29.370 --> 00:34:29.870
here.

00:34:29.870 --> 00:34:31.710
But as I said, it's
a very big company

00:34:31.710 --> 00:34:34.830
and there are many different
teams utilizing design sprints.

00:34:34.830 --> 00:34:40.572
So I can't comment on
the value of it as a book

00:34:40.572 --> 00:34:42.030
because I haven't
actually read it.

00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:44.710
But my understanding
is it has a lot

00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:47.130
of the same information in it.

00:34:47.130 --> 00:34:50.800
AUDIENCE: Actually I
have another question.

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:53.639
And you mentioned you brought
in users to actually validate

00:34:53.639 --> 00:34:54.389
during the sprint.

00:34:54.389 --> 00:34:57.567
I think that's awesome, and
I was wondering how you time

00:34:57.567 --> 00:34:59.650
boxed that for the sprint,
because I would imagine

00:34:59.650 --> 00:35:03.354
you have to limit the things
that you can learn and limit

00:35:03.354 --> 00:35:05.570
the things that you
put them through,

00:35:05.570 --> 00:35:06.615
or put the users through.

00:35:06.615 --> 00:35:07.990
KAI HALEY: It
depends on the user

00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:09.670
and the capability of the user.

00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:11.980
So I think it's a
really good question.

00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:14.710
With the farmers
and business owners,

00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:17.590
they were capable of
participating and contributing

00:35:17.590 --> 00:35:20.140
through the whole thing,
particularly because this

00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:23.610
was a marketplace,
so everyone is

00:35:23.610 --> 00:35:25.760
sort of a free agent
in that marketplace.

00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:28.660
But for example, the YouTube
team will bring in kids

00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:31.410
and do co-creation
exercises with them.

00:35:31.410 --> 00:35:34.420
And they can't, obviously,
participate in the whole thing.

00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:37.030
So I think you have to customize
it to accommodate what kind

00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:38.280
of user you have.

00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:42.180
And so traditional
user interviews

00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:46.000
are the way that you do
that, or site observations

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.950
where you go and watch
them in their environment.

00:35:48.950 --> 00:35:51.680
But if they're capable of
generating ideas with you

00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:54.750
and sketching, then it's really
valuable to have them there.

00:35:54.750 --> 00:35:55.500
AUDIENCE: Awesome.

00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:55.700
Thank you.

00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:56.366
KAI HALEY: Yeah.

00:35:56.366 --> 00:35:57.749
Absolutely.

00:35:57.749 --> 00:35:59.499
AUDIENCE: Thank you
for that presentation.

00:35:59.499 --> 00:36:04.250
I'm interested in
the [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:04.250 --> 00:36:07.880
My question is, do you change
[INAUDIBLE] of each step

00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:11.520
while doing the design sprint?

00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:14.925
So I think that
sometimes understanding

00:36:14.925 --> 00:36:15.800
may take longer time.

00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:23.940
So that do you have any
tips to arrange [INAUDIBLE]?

00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:28.270
KAI HALEY: Well, it
really depends on what

00:36:28.270 --> 00:36:29.950
your goals and deliverable are.

00:36:29.950 --> 00:36:32.520
And sometimes you'll spend a
lot more time understanding

00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:35.220
if your goal is very
broad and if you

00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:37.012
need to spend that
time sort of narrowing

00:36:37.012 --> 00:36:38.970
in on what's going to be
the target that you're

00:36:38.970 --> 00:36:40.100
going to focus on.

00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:42.720
So sometimes you might
take a whole day,

00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:44.690
you know, an entire
day for understand.

00:36:44.690 --> 00:36:46.541
And sometimes we might
just take an hour.

00:36:46.541 --> 00:36:48.790
If you have a really good
understanding of the problem

00:36:48.790 --> 00:36:52.319
space and you're just bringing
and surfacing the content,

00:36:52.319 --> 00:36:54.360
and you're not spending
a lot of time discussing.

00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:57.870
But in terms of tips
for figuring that out,

00:36:57.870 --> 00:37:02.100
you have to get a read on
the challenge and the team.

00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:04.731
And sometimes people want to
have a lot of conversation.

00:37:04.731 --> 00:37:06.730
And that will lead to a
longer understand phase.

00:37:06.730 --> 00:37:08.440
So I've certainly
been in situations

00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:11.051
where the team needed to have
the conversation because one

00:37:11.051 --> 00:37:12.800
person had one
perspective, another person

00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:13.810
had another perspective.

00:37:13.810 --> 00:37:15.750
And in that understand
phase, you're

00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:17.540
sharing those
perspectives and coming

00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:20.684
to a common understanding,
and then making a decision,

00:37:20.684 --> 00:37:23.100
is the product going to be
this or is it going to be that?

00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:25.750
So sometimes that can
take a while, it's true.

00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:28.650
But the thing with the
sprint is, you actually

00:37:28.650 --> 00:37:31.170
have a timer up here, and it's
like, you've got 10 minutes

00:37:31.170 --> 00:37:33.060
to come to a conclusion.

00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:35.750
And you'd be surprised
at what people will

00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:38.260
do when that timer goes off.

00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:41.130
They're like, OK, we'll do it.

00:37:41.130 --> 00:37:41.910
Yeah.

00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:42.422
Go ahead.

00:37:42.422 --> 00:37:44.755
AUDIENCE: When I've participated
in sprints in the past,

00:37:44.755 --> 00:37:46.780
and the ones you
mentioned today,

00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:49.115
it's been mostly around
launching new features,

00:37:49.115 --> 00:37:50.350
new products.

00:37:50.350 --> 00:37:51.770
I'm curious, from
your experience,

00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:53.490
if you've seen this work
well with other things,

00:37:53.490 --> 00:37:55.930
say, design-driven initiatives,
if you're dealing with,

00:37:55.930 --> 00:37:58.730
say, a lot of product
or design debt

00:37:58.730 --> 00:38:02.110
that's like cross-platform
inconsistencies, product

00:38:02.110 --> 00:38:06.800
hierarchy, is this mechanism
effective for helping

00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:09.040
solve those challenges as well?

00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:11.830
And a lot of those may
not involve users as much.

00:38:11.830 --> 00:38:13.440
It should always involve users.

00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:16.254
But it's a little bit different,
I would say, kind of process.

00:38:16.254 --> 00:38:16.920
KAI HALEY: Yeah.

00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:19.127
Your users may be more
complex at that point

00:38:19.127 --> 00:38:20.710
because you've got
multiple people who

00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:22.810
are engaging with something.

00:38:22.810 --> 00:38:24.530
It is effective for that.

00:38:24.530 --> 00:38:25.870
It can be more complex.

00:38:25.870 --> 00:38:29.680
And you have to think about
using your time efficiently

00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:34.510
and trying to organize the
problem a little bit more.

00:38:34.510 --> 00:38:38.320
And I've only done a couple
that are more larger processes

00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:40.110
or cross-platform.

00:38:40.110 --> 00:38:43.380
And what I often do
is I'll divide it.

00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:45.700
So I won't try to tackle
everything in one sprint.

00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:47.380
I'll say, let's
look at this piece,

00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:51.320
and then you solve that and
then take it to the next one.

00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:54.080
So if you can-- even like
that user journey map,

00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:56.400
or you can sort of divide
it up into sections.

00:38:56.400 --> 00:39:00.070
And then each section will
maybe inform the next one.

00:39:00.070 --> 00:39:04.256
But oftentimes you can't bite
off everything all at once.

00:39:04.256 --> 00:39:05.880
But I certainly
encourage you to try it

00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:09.140
with something like that,
because it's a really great

00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:10.470
collaboration method.

00:39:10.470 --> 00:39:12.930
And the other thing
I encourage people

00:39:12.930 --> 00:39:14.760
is to try other methods, too.

00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:18.790
I mean, we've selected
30 from over 300

00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:20.279
out there in the world.

00:39:20.279 --> 00:39:21.820
But the framework
is flexible and you

00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:25.370
can pull in other methods as
needed based on your needs.

00:39:28.839 --> 00:39:29.380
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:39:29.380 --> 00:39:30.880
Can you go into a
little more detail

00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:34.200
around what the sprint mater's
role is during the sprint,

00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:36.283
and also, who can play that?

00:39:36.283 --> 00:39:38.600
Is it anyone?

00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:39.654
KAI HALEY: Yeah.

00:39:39.654 --> 00:39:41.070
It's really great
to have somebody

00:39:41.070 --> 00:39:43.210
who's good at
facilitation, who is

00:39:43.210 --> 00:39:49.880
able to read the room well
and get a sense of how people

00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:52.830
are feeling and how they're
responding to each other.

00:39:52.830 --> 00:39:56.380
So we often have UX
people because it's

00:39:56.380 --> 00:39:58.090
a very user-centered process.

00:39:58.090 --> 00:39:59.850
But really lots
of different roles

00:39:59.850 --> 00:40:03.210
can take on the role of
facilitator, provided

00:40:03.210 --> 00:40:08.550
that you enjoy that kind of
work where you're oftentimes

00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:13.070
corralling people and asking
people to make decisions.

00:40:13.070 --> 00:40:17.090
And so you have to be
comfortable with sort

00:40:17.090 --> 00:40:19.190
of holding to your
rules and saying,

00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:20.790
OK, well, this is
the time frame,

00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:22.730
and we gotta keep moving.

00:40:22.730 --> 00:40:25.840
So people who are more
used to being taskmasters

00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:28.400
sometimes are helpful,
but that can do it gently,

00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:31.490
because-- I mean, I always
start a sprint and say,

00:40:31.490 --> 00:40:33.070
I'm going to move you along.

00:40:33.070 --> 00:40:34.300
I'm going to cut you off.

00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:34.950
It's a sprint.

00:40:34.950 --> 00:40:36.800
We're going to move fast.

00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:41.330
So people who are good at that.

00:40:41.330 --> 00:40:46.080
And the important thing is being
able to pivot at any moment

00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:49.020
during the sprint, because
you're learning new things

00:40:49.020 --> 00:40:50.520
throughout the whole process.

00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:53.420
And at any point in time you
might just adjust everything.

00:40:53.420 --> 00:40:55.560
And so you'll change
your schedule,

00:40:55.560 --> 00:40:58.150
and you may end up
changing your deliverables.

00:40:58.150 --> 00:41:00.600
So you have to be flexible
and able to think on your feet

00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:04.540
really well and have a
good sense of product

00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:06.410
problem solving,
like really helping

00:41:06.410 --> 00:41:07.978
the group problem solve.

00:41:07.978 --> 00:41:09.770
AUDIENCE: So that
person isn't sketching,

00:41:09.770 --> 00:41:11.220
isn't doing the process.

00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:13.760
They're the kind of bystander
that moves it along.

00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:15.350
KAI HALEY: They are
the facilitator.

00:41:15.350 --> 00:41:21.080
And sometimes they might
interject some ideas.

00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:24.080
And I've certainly run sprints
for my team and my product

00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:26.740
area, and I'm a designer
so I'm invested in it.

00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:28.740
It's a little bit harder,
because you really

00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:30.280
want to sketch and
generate ideas,

00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:33.370
but you're exhausted from
getting everybody excited

00:41:33.370 --> 00:41:35.330
and keeping everybody
focused and engaged

00:41:35.330 --> 00:41:37.620
and talking them
through every exercise.

00:41:37.620 --> 00:41:40.190
So generally we
recommend that people

00:41:40.190 --> 00:41:43.110
don't try to be a sprinter
and a sprint master.

00:41:43.110 --> 00:41:45.460
We say you'll be much more
effective if you focus

00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:47.850
on just being a sprint
master, and look

00:41:47.850 --> 00:41:50.836
at the process as opposed to
the content of the sprint.

00:41:55.390 --> 00:41:57.630
AUDIENCE: So I have a
question around when

00:41:57.630 --> 00:42:01.033
you go into a sprint, it could
be that you're spending a day

00:42:01.033 --> 00:42:03.325
or two working
together, collaborating,

00:42:03.325 --> 00:42:05.830
and you have to kind of
block out your schedule.

00:42:05.830 --> 00:42:08.260
And how do you cancel
out all the other noise

00:42:08.260 --> 00:42:11.040
that's coming in from other
projects and other PMs?

00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:13.797
And how can you just
focus on one thing

00:42:13.797 --> 00:42:15.630
and not worry about the
million other things

00:42:15.630 --> 00:42:16.490
that you have to do?

00:42:16.490 --> 00:42:17.980
KAI HALEY: It's
really challenging.

00:42:17.980 --> 00:42:19.610
It's very challenging for teams.

00:42:19.610 --> 00:42:21.490
Sometimes we'll go offsite.

00:42:21.490 --> 00:42:24.560
So we'll take the whole
team to another location,

00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:27.720
and then people can't duck out
for meetings and take calls.

00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:29.210
And you change
their environment,

00:42:29.210 --> 00:42:30.690
and then everyone can focus.

00:42:30.690 --> 00:42:33.107
So that's one thing you can do.

00:42:33.107 --> 00:42:35.440
We set the ground rules for
the sprint at the beginning.

00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:38.940
We say, we're asking you to
be here for this time period.

00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:41.260
If you need to jump out
for one call, that's fine.

00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:42.700
But if you're in
a sprint, you're

00:42:42.700 --> 00:42:44.460
in a sprint from the
beginning to the end,

00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:46.650
because it's very disruptive
to jump in and out.

00:42:46.650 --> 00:42:49.320
And you're really creating
this collaborative space

00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:50.680
and this team.

00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:53.210
So when people
leave, it disrupts

00:42:53.210 --> 00:42:55.480
that team building
that's happening

00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:59.460
and the effectiveness
of working together.

00:42:59.460 --> 00:43:03.110
So it's a challenge, though.

00:43:03.110 --> 00:43:04.790
At Google it's become a culture.

00:43:04.790 --> 00:43:07.690
So every team here is sprinting.

00:43:07.690 --> 00:43:10.940
And so people are more used,
to seeing the auto response,

00:43:10.940 --> 00:43:12.280
I'm in a sprint for three days.

00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:14.539
Sorry I'll get back to
you at the end of the day.

00:43:14.539 --> 00:43:16.580
So there's a little bit
more of that expectation.

00:43:16.580 --> 00:43:19.970
And I think as you're
able to make that culture

00:43:19.970 --> 00:43:24.390
shift within a company,
that will help some, to say,

00:43:24.390 --> 00:43:26.780
OK, this is actually something
that we're all doing.

00:43:26.780 --> 00:43:31.020
And so we'll respect
about space and that time.

00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:32.320
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:33.740
KAI HALEY: Absolutely.

00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:35.337
OK.

00:43:35.337 --> 00:43:36.170
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:43:36.170 --> 00:43:37.380
I guess this works
perfectly, because I

00:43:37.380 --> 00:43:39.710
was going to ask you about
the timeline that you set up.

00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:41.376
Have you found that
it's better to do it

00:43:41.376 --> 00:43:44.000
in a block of a day as
opposed to two hours one day,

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:45.210
three hours a day?

00:43:45.210 --> 00:43:46.420
KAI HALEY: Absolutely.

00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:49.310
Well, the framework and the
process, like I was saying,

00:43:49.310 --> 00:43:52.540
the methods are ordered
to build into each other.

00:43:52.540 --> 00:43:55.030
So as you create this
shared knowledge,

00:43:55.030 --> 00:43:56.630
as you create all
these opportunities,

00:43:56.630 --> 00:43:58.990
it starts to generate
ideas in your head.

00:43:58.990 --> 00:44:00.610
And then if you
jump into sketching,

00:44:00.610 --> 00:44:02.620
you've got those
ideas and it's really

00:44:02.620 --> 00:44:07.670
this-- you have this
brainstorm and creative moment.

00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:11.790
If you wait another week,
all of that is gone.

00:44:11.790 --> 00:44:15.110
So the stages build
into each other,

00:44:15.110 --> 00:44:17.690
and so that's the other reason
why we do it all in a row.

00:44:17.690 --> 00:44:21.640
And we give people breaks,
and sometimes we do 10 to 5

00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:24.570
instead of 9 to 5 and try
not to wear people out.

00:44:24.570 --> 00:44:29.850
But I always encourage
people to do it in succession

00:44:29.850 --> 00:44:32.380
and not break up and kill
that creative moment,

00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:35.000
because this is really about
innovation and ideation.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:38.550
And we're setting it up so
that you are in the best place

00:44:38.550 --> 00:44:40.320
to generate the best ideas.

00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:41.290
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:44:41.290 --> 00:44:43.670
KAI HALEY: Absolutely.

00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:44.650
Last one.

00:44:44.650 --> 00:44:45.350
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:44:45.350 --> 00:44:48.520
As a non-Googler, are
there any opportunities

00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:50.800
for any sort of formal
training or workshops,

00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:53.700
or something more low level
than-- this is a really

00:44:53.700 --> 00:44:56.280
high-level presentation.

00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:58.520
I would love to be
able to exercise

00:44:58.520 --> 00:45:01.250
trying to be this sprint
master and to get feedback.

00:45:03.746 --> 00:45:05.370
And again, not being
a Google employee,

00:45:05.370 --> 00:45:06.950
do you know of
anything like that?

00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:09.830
Is there any
opportunities there?

00:45:09.830 --> 00:45:11.570
KAI HALEY: Well,
you can buy the book

00:45:11.570 --> 00:45:13.460
and go try and run
one with your team.

00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:16.530
And I think you've
read it already.

00:45:16.530 --> 00:45:18.360
That's what Jake recommends.

00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:22.050
Get together with some
people and just try it out.

00:45:22.050 --> 00:45:23.500
The best way to
learn is by doing.

00:45:25.940 --> 00:45:27.440
There are some
meetups I've seen out

00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:32.320
there of people who are getting
together and talking about it.

00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:34.770
Maybe approach a nonprofit.

00:45:34.770 --> 00:45:36.940
I want to run a sprint for you.

00:45:36.940 --> 00:45:40.020
A lot of nonprofits are
looking for UX support

00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:43.390
and it would probably be really
excited at the opportunity

00:45:43.390 --> 00:45:44.939
to try out the process.

00:45:44.939 --> 00:45:47.230
Things like that, volunteering
your skills for somebody

00:45:47.230 --> 00:45:50.892
if your particular team is
not ready to take it on.

00:45:50.892 --> 00:45:52.850
But the more experience
you can get the better.

00:45:52.850 --> 00:45:56.130
Absolutely And I wish we had an
external Sprint Master Academy

00:45:56.130 --> 00:45:59.190
that I could invite you guys all
to come to, but at the moment

00:45:59.190 --> 00:46:00.010
we don't.

00:46:00.010 --> 00:46:00.510
AUDIENCE: That's great.

00:46:00.510 --> 00:46:01.009
Thank you.

00:46:01.009 --> 00:46:02.990
KAI HALEY: Yeah, absolutely.

00:46:02.990 --> 00:46:03.490
All right.

00:46:03.490 --> 00:46:04.780
I think we're done.

00:46:04.780 --> 00:46:05.620
Thank you guys.

00:46:05.620 --> 00:46:07.170
[APPLAUSE]
