[APPLAUSE]

00:00:05.237 --> 00:00:06.570
MALE SPEAKER: Welcome to Google.

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:08.278
AMERIGO GAZAWAY: Thank
you for having me.

00:00:08.278 --> 00:00:10.640
MALE SPEAKER: We're
very happy to have you.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.220
You are actually from
Nashville, Tennessee.

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:14.040
Is that right?

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.081
AMERIGO GAZAWAY: Correct.

00:00:15.081 --> 00:00:17.660
Yeah, my mother's from
Brazil, Rio de Janeiro.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.202
My dad's from the Ozarks,
but I grew up in Nashville.

00:00:20.202 --> 00:00:21.660
MALE SPEAKER: So
Nashville's a town

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.760
that has a very rich
musical history.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.700
Did that have any
influence on you

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.305
in terms of steering
you towards music?

00:00:30.305 --> 00:00:32.430
AMERIGO GAZAWAY: Yeah, I
think Nashville definitely

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.010
rubbed off on me because, one,
it's just a rich musical town.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.422
Everybody I know whose father,
uncle was in the music biz

00:00:41.422 --> 00:00:42.380
or something like that.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.160
And then it's just a
rich musical history.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.440
So we've got a lot of
really good record shops

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:55.630
in Nashville that you can
find rare records that were

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.320
significant to that region.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.870
Specifically, stuff that
was recorded in Nashville

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.930
like old gospel, soul,
blues albums that you really

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.430
couldn't find anywhere else.

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.850
MALE SPEAKER: Do you remember
the first record you bought?

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.225
AMERIGO GAZAWAY:
The first record

00:01:09.225 --> 00:01:15.930
I bought, I think it was like
a Mexican bullfight record.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.044
But most of my
record collection,

00:01:18.044 --> 00:01:20.460
honestly, is hand me downs
from people, people that'd just

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.376
call me up, be like,
hey, my dad's giving away

00:01:22.376 --> 00:01:23.360
all his old records.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.540
I know you're into hip
hop and so-- you know,

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.170
a lot of my collection
is $0.99 dollar

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.160
been records, hand-me downs.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.470
And it ends up
forcing you to be more

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.530
creative because
those types of records

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.970
aren't necessarily meant
for sample, or you know,

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.530
you wouldn't actually think to
sample those kind of records.

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.640
But yeah, another big influence
for me in Nashville growing up

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.030
was the Vanderbilt station,
WRVU, which is now shut down.

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.210
But when I was growing
up, that was home

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.665
to a lot of good radio
shows such as Ken Berryhill.

00:02:00.665 --> 00:02:03.420
He had a show called "The
Old-Time Record Shop"

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.820
and "The Old Jazz Boy" that I
used to listen to on the way

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.500
to college every day.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.790
And those would always put me
on to all types of old jazz

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.130
and blues that I
had never heard of.

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.620
And then another show that
was really influential for me,

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.510
and a lot of other
Nashvillians at the time,

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.410
was the "911
Emergency Show" hosted

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.830
by DJ Egon and Count Basie.

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.530
And so that show was really
influential for anybody

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.820
in Nashville who listened
to hip hop at that time.

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.440
They would play hip hop
in breaks and samples

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.404
and kind of connect the dots for
people and show the evolution,

00:02:40.404 --> 00:02:41.820
kind of like what
I'm doing today.

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.650
And so that was a huge influence
me growing up, as well,

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:45.704
and living in Nashville.

00:02:45.704 --> 00:02:46.620
MALE SPEAKER: Awesome.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.410
So beyond just having a
musical city to grow in,

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.370
you actually grew up
in a musical household.

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.280
For those of you who
don't know, your dad

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.254
is actually a jazz trumpeter.

00:02:57.254 --> 00:02:58.170
AMERIGO GAZAWAY: Yeah.

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.045
MALE SPEAKER: What was
it was like growing up

00:03:00.045 --> 00:03:02.440
in El Buho's house.

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.857
AMERIGO GAZAWAY: It was awesome.

00:03:03.857 --> 00:03:05.690
Growing up, I was always
surrounded by music

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.930
and virtuoso musicians.

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.080
And it's funny because
it really didn't

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.360
dawn on me until I got older
how legendary and virtuoso

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.450
these guys actually were, and
so you start to appreciate

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:19.370
that as you get older.

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.430
But yeah, growing
up I was always

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.530
surrounded by samplers
and beat machines,

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.739
and I spent summers
at my dad's, just

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:30.030
going through his jazz records
and listening to records

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.760
and messing around with,
like, old synthesizers.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.860
And I think that
definitely rubbed off.

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.620
When I was 17, my dad
took me on tour with him

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.230
with his band in
Colorado, and that

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.050
was a really big eye-opening
experience for me.

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.330
It was my first official
time going out on the road,

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.460
touring in real venues,
using real equipment.

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:55.260
And so that was definitely an
invaluable experience for me

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:55.875
too.

00:03:55.875 --> 00:03:59.672
MALE SPEAKER: So what was your
road from there to here like?

00:03:59.672 --> 00:04:01.380
Like, how did you
figure out-- like, what

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.960
did you come to music
motivated by, like,

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.460
would did you want
to get out of it?

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:07.959
And then how did
you figure out what

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:11.030
you needed to know and pursue
learning all of those things

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.414
to fill the gaps to be able
to do this type of thing

00:04:13.414 --> 00:04:14.330
that you're doing now?

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:20.040
AMERIGO GAZAWAY: Well, I
started dabbling with music

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.140
when I was pretty young, like
I said, when I was a kid,

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:26.120
I was just messing around with
keyboards and synthesizers.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:31.350
And when I was about,
I guess, 13 or so,

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:35.220
I started working at my
friend's computer shop.

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.460
And he taught me how
to build computers,

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.010
and so I got really
nerdy, into software,

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:42.120
and putting together
computer parts.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:48.420
And eventually, that led to me
getting my hands on some DAW

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:49.445
software for producing.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.950
And then after that I got
my first set of turntables,

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:58.040
started buying records.

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.620
But I was into music
long before I even

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.550
started thinking about
hip hop or mashups

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.320
and I was even
producing long before I

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.510
started doing these
conceptual collaborations.

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:09.770
You know, I was
just creating beats

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:13.100
in my bedroom and kind of
honing my skills over time.

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:17.940
And then back in 2009,
2010, my friend and I

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:23.504
started this DJ crew called
Bebop and Rocksteady,

00:05:23.504 --> 00:05:25.920
based on the Ninja Turtles
super villains, if you guys are

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:26.419
familiar.

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:28.170
But anyway, you know,
it was basically

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:31.481
like a mashup, kind of your
basic cut and paste mashup

00:05:31.481 --> 00:05:31.980
style.

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:34.519
So where you just take one
track or an instrumental

00:05:34.519 --> 00:05:36.060
in an acapella and
put them together,

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.270
and we had a lot of
success with that.

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:41.910
We had a good couple years DJing
around Nashville, doing that,

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:43.840
and people really dug it.

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.060
But with the Soul
Mates project, I

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:48.830
wanted to take
that a step further

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:52.970
and start to dig a little deeper
and actually, like I said,

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:55.780
try to recreate studio
sessions between these artists,

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:58.676
and make it sound more authentic
and not like it was just cut

00:05:58.676 --> 00:05:59.175
and paste.

00:05:59.175 --> 00:06:01.490
And so that's kind
of the evolution

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:03.700
of how I got to where I am.

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:06.570
MALE SPEAKER: So with so
many different exposures

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:08.110
that you had
growing up, is there

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:10.530
anything that stands
out to you as something

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:14.240
that was sort of one of the more
valuable or more inspirational

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:18.980
experiences that
you had as a child?

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:20.920
AMERIGO GAZAWAY: Like
I said, just witnessing

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:24.700
all the virtuoso musicians
and my dad, going to his shows

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:27.970
and accompanying him.

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:30.480
And I think just being around
that in general, you know,

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:32.890
it seeps into you.

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:35.440
And, like I said,
the older you get,

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:37.800
the more you start to
appreciate those experiences.

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.341
At the time, I was just a kid
just having fun. (SELF MOCKING)

00:06:40.341 --> 00:06:41.810
Oh, this is fun music.

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:45.450
Now that I look
back on it, those

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:49.180
experiences definitely
shaped who I am today.

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:54.480
But I think my biggest influence
and inspiration is just

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:57.324
the art of discovery and going
to the record store and digging

00:06:57.324 --> 00:06:59.740
through old records and getting
my hands dusty and reading

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:00.520
the liner notes.

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:03.020
And, you know, that's
what inspires me.

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:07.300
I get inspired by others or
listening to like a Pete Rock

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:09.679
beat and noticing the
sample and then figuring

00:07:09.679 --> 00:07:10.470
out it's Fela Kuti.

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:13.770
And then who's Fela Kuti,
and then doing my research

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:17.530
and then eventually creating
a whole project based

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:20.090
around that, so
I think discovery

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:23.657
is what I thrive
on as an artist.

00:07:23.657 --> 00:07:25.740
MALE SPEAKER: I'm sure
these guys want to discover

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:26.698
some more of your work.

00:07:26.698 --> 00:07:30.440
But before we get into the
next demo, I have to ask,

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.170
you've been on tour
since you were young.

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:34.950
You're on tour now.

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:38.090
What is the craziest thing
that you've experienced while

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:38.740
on tour?

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:42.540
Like, what is the
standout moment?

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:46.670
AMERIGO GAZAWAY: Well, I went on
tour with this cannabis culture

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:51.636
website called 420 RAW,
and it was a spring break

00:07:51.636 --> 00:07:52.760
tour that was pretty crazy.

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:54.920
You know, we're rolling
around in this huge bus

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:57.360
with 420 written
on the side of it,

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:00.550
getting pulled over by
border patrol every day.

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:04.004
And so that was a very
unique experience.

00:08:04.004 --> 00:08:05.420
But no, being on
the road's crazy.

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:07.760
You know, to me it's
just crazy that I'm

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:10.570
on the road and the fact
that, like, I just got back

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:13.910
from Europe in December, and the
fact that I could go to Germany

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:15.910
or Switzerland and
people actually

00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:18.419
know who I am and are paying
money to come see me perform,

00:08:18.419 --> 00:08:19.460
get their records signed.

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:22.410
That's like the greatest
feeling in the world and truly

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:25.260
blessing, so I'm very
thankful to be where I am.

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:27.010
MALE SPEAKER: Right
now, you're best known

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:28.750
for your fictional
collaborations.

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:31.440
One of the tracks
from Yasiin Gaye

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:34.049
was just picked up for--
I know you guys have seen

00:08:34.049 --> 00:08:38.880
it-- the Apple-iPod TV spots.

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:40.490
We should play it afterwards.

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:42.877
AMERIGO GAZAWAY:
Yeah, we can do that.

00:08:42.877 --> 00:08:44.460
MALE SPEAKER: But
you do so much more.

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:47.720
How do you compare a work
like "Selective Hearing"

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:50.360
or the track that you just
produced for The Pharcyde

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:53.160
to more of these
collabos that people

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:56.771
seem to be very excited about?

00:08:56.771 --> 00:08:59.020
AMERIGO GAZAWAY: Yeah, well,
with "Selective Hearing,"

00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:02.240
that was my first album
that I released in 2010.

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.240
That was kind of an
instrumental trip hop,

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:10.019
hip hop album, and so with
"Selective Hearing," that's

00:09:10.019 --> 00:09:11.310
kind of what the title implies.

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:14.362
I have selective hearing, and
so that's the natural process

00:09:14.362 --> 00:09:16.070
that I go through when
I listen to music,

00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:18.900
is I take the parts
that I like the most

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:21.200
and reinterpret them
in my own way and so,

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.910
for me, "Selective Hearing"
is a little more personal,

00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:28.070
gives me a little more freedom
to just go anywhere and go

00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:30.010
to different places of music.

00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:33.410
Whereas with a conceptual
collaboration like Yasiin Gaye

00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:37.490
or Bizarre Tribe or Fela
Soul, it's less about me

00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:42.990
and it's more about the artists
and helping tailor the project

00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:45.740
to help tell their
story and, like I said,

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:47.410
make it sound as if
they were actually

00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:49.100
in the studio
collaborating together.

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:50.766
So I think that's the
biggest difference

00:09:50.766 --> 00:09:54.932
between Selective Hearing and
the conceptual collaborations.

00:09:54.932 --> 00:09:56.640
MALE SPEAKER: So with
the collaborations,

00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:00.250
are there any combinations
that stand out

00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:04.210
as either much harder
than you expected or much,

00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:08.594
much easier than they would
have seemed on the surface?

00:10:08.594 --> 00:10:10.010
AMERIGO GAZAWAY:
All the ones I've

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:13.600
done so far have just come
really easy and naturally,

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:16.260
and that's what's beautiful
about it is you just get lucky.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:19.000
And a lot of the
time, I'm never really

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.110
sure if it's going to
work out when I start,

00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:25.470
and so I'll spend a lot of time
just researching and listening

00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:28.330
to the catalogs and
then connecting the dots

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:30.620
and then trying to find
those overlaps before I even

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:32.890
begin to start
remixing or sampling

00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:34.313
or chopping anything up.

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:41.434
And yes, so with Yasiin Gaye
it just kind of unfolded

00:10:41.434 --> 00:10:41.975
so naturally.

00:10:41.975 --> 00:10:43.810
You know, there were
so many similarities

00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:47.300
between Mos Def and Marvin
Gaye's music and so many parts

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:50.110
where they could kind
of create a conversation

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:52.630
where it seemed as though they
were talking to one another.

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:55.170
And I guess it helps that Mos
Def is a huge Marvin Gaye fan,

00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:57.740
so he mentions him in
his songs, and there's

00:10:57.740 --> 00:10:59.201
a lot of overlap there.

00:10:59.201 --> 00:10:59.700
But--

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:01.200
MALE SPEAKER: You
also have a couple

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:05.250
that are not necessarily obvious
like, for example, "Ghostface

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:07.000
Thriller."

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:07.770
Where were you?

00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:09.342
What did you have for breakfast?

00:11:09.342 --> 00:11:11.730
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:14.120
Like, how did that
come together?

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:17.019
Like, what was the
[INAUDIBLE] process there?

00:11:17.019 --> 00:11:18.810
AMERIGO GAZAWAY: Well,
"Ghostface Thriller"

00:11:18.810 --> 00:11:22.340
is kind of a Halloween,
just, novelty try.

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:25.086
It's not like a
conceptual collaboration,

00:11:25.086 --> 00:11:25.960
so don't get excited.

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:27.710
There's not going to be a
"Ghostface Thriller" album

00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:28.760
or anything like that.

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:29.820
But Halloween's my--

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:30.736
MALE SPEAKER: I'm out.

00:11:30.736 --> 00:11:32.621
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:32.621 --> 00:11:34.370
AMERIGO GAZAWAY: You
know, Halloween's one

00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:35.610
of my favorite
holidays, so I really

00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:37.860
just want something I could
play at the next Halloween

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:38.622
party I DJ at.

00:11:38.622 --> 00:11:40.330
One thing cool about
"Ghostface Thriller"

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:44.000
was that I actually found this
unreleased recording floating

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.570
around on the internet
of Michael Jackson

00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:49.710
and Vincent Price in the
studio together clowning around

00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:51.482
before they actually
did the takes.

00:11:51.482 --> 00:11:53.690
And so you hear a little
bit of that in the beginning

00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:55.446
of "Ghostface Thriller."

00:11:55.446 --> 00:11:57.640
You know, they're
like, how do I say it?

00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:59.780
Do I say it like, (WHISPERS)
thriller, thriller, am

00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:01.550
I supposed to say it like that?

00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:03.870
You can hear my Michael
Jackson, and then there's

00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:05.710
also Vincent's rap.

00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:07.960
Vincent Price has like
a secret third verse

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:10.692
that nobody's ever really heard,
and so I was able to find that.

00:12:10.692 --> 00:12:12.650
MALE SPEAKER: How do you
find all these things?

00:12:12.650 --> 00:12:14.025
AMERIGO GAZAWAY:
I'm just a nerd.

00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:19.030
I live and breathe this
stuff, so like I said,

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:23.210
discovery is just
what I thrive on.

00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:24.903
MALE SPEAKER: So
the right answer

00:12:24.903 --> 00:12:27.770
would have been at
Google search but--

00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:29.875
AMERIGO GAZAWAY:
Google I use daily.

00:12:29.875 --> 00:12:31.250
MALE SPEAKER:
Speaking of Google,

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:34.685
so Google is a technology,
and a lot of folks

00:12:34.685 --> 00:12:36.560
are interested in the
technology that you use

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:39.730
and how you apply technology.

00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:45.270
What software, hardware,
other aspects of technologies

00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:51.050
you find sort of most useful
for the work that you do?

00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:52.800
AMERIGO GAZAWAY: Well,
one thing that I've

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:54.749
come to realize over
the years of being a DJ

00:12:54.749 --> 00:12:56.290
and touring and
being out on the road

00:12:56.290 --> 00:13:00.320
is that the turntable
itself is still relevant.

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:02.020
And that's something
that I don't

00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:04.110
think it's going to
go-- it's irreplaceable.

00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:06.690
You know, I've tried a lot
of different DJ controllers

00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:09.520
and launch pads and MIDI
controllers and stuff

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:10.540
for DJing.

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:12.736
And at the end of
the day, I always

00:13:12.736 --> 00:13:13.860
come back to the turntable.

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:16.640
There's nothing like the
satisfaction and the freedom

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:18.990
and the control you
have with the turntable,

00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:21.140
manipulating a vinyl record.

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:24.750
And so I think that will always
be a significant part of what

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:27.060
I do.

00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:34.120
As far as software goes, I'm
a big fan of Ableton Live.

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:37.290
And one of the main features
in Ableton Live that

00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:40.330
allows me to do what I do is
it's time stretch and warping

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:41.050
capabilities.

00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:44.629
So in Ableton Live, you
can take a sample-- usually

00:13:44.629 --> 00:13:46.420
when you're playing a
sample on a turntable

00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:48.560
and you speed it up, it
sounds like a chipmunk.

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:50.860
If you slow it down, it
sounds chopped and screwed.

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:53.240
With Ableton Live, I can
prevent that from happening,

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:55.570
and so I can slow down
a sample while still

00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:59.710
maintaining the tone of
someone's voice or vice versa.

00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:02.740
I can pitch it up without
changing the speed of it,

00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:08.170
and so that feature alone
is a very significant part

00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:11.190
of mashing things up
and warping things

00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:13.970
into place so that they all
lock in and fit in the grid

00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:14.680
perfectly.

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:17.990
And so, Yeah, Ableton Live
is definitely a huge part

00:14:17.990 --> 00:14:19.440
of what I do as well.

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:20.856
MALE SPEAKER: Do
you think there's

00:14:20.856 --> 00:14:23.620
anything that is lacking in the
technology that's available?

00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:26.580
So like, let's say you
had a fairy-god nerd that

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:28.910
would grant you
whatever your whish was,

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:30.910
what would you wish for?

00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:36.500
AMERIGO GAZAWAY: I really
want a talk box or a vocoder.

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:38.090
I think that'd be
pretty cool, but--

00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:39.640
MALE SPEAKER: Something
that doesn't exist.

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:41.098
AMERIGO GAZAWAY:
Yeah, well I mean,

00:14:41.098 --> 00:14:44.220
I think as far as technology,
we've come a really long way.

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:48.170
And there's, essentially,
unlimited amounts of options

00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:51.630
that you can do now that
you couldn't even do before,

00:14:51.630 --> 00:14:54.180
and so the options
are pretty limitless.

00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:55.680
And it can be
overwhelming at times,

00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:58.410
and so I'm glad I
came up during an era

00:14:58.410 --> 00:15:00.940
where I was still bound
by certain limitations

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:03.050
because I think that
encourages-- limitations

00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:04.830
encourage creativity.

00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:09.710
And so it makes me appreciate
the technology even more.

00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:13.060
But yeah, if I had
one wish, I think

00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:16.740
it would be for the industry
and the copyright laws

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:21.810
to adapt to the technology that
we have because, like I said,

00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:23.530
we have everything
we need and it's just

00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:28.310
a matter of us working
together to try to come up

00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:30.640
with a better solution.

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:33.930
And so if companies like
Pandora and Spotify,

00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:36.080
streaming companies
that are already

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:42.200
paying for the licensing for
these tracks to stream online,

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:45.160
you know, if they were to
extend that license for people

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:49.530
like me to come along and
remix and reinterpret and then

00:15:49.530 --> 00:15:53.102
have those remixes available for
streaming on the same service.

00:15:53.102 --> 00:15:54.560
Something like
that, I think, could

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:58.190
benefit, not only the original
artist, but the record labels,

00:15:58.190 --> 00:16:04.750
the publishers, and even
give people more incentive

00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:09.320
to subscribe to the service
and also hopefully introduced

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:11.810
new generations to
this music, which

00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:15.520
is a big part of
what I do as well.

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:20.150
MALE SPEAKER: So we have mics
at the end of either aisle

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:25.190
if anyone wants to come up
and ask Amerigo any questions.

00:16:25.190 --> 00:16:28.050
And while you guys
are getting set,

00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:34.252
you are a mere 28 years old,
and you've done quite a bit.

00:16:34.252 --> 00:16:35.460
AMERIGO GAZAWAY: 29 actually.

00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:38.762
MALE SPEAKER: Oh, did
you-- happy birthday.

00:16:38.762 --> 00:16:41.024
AMERIGO GAZAWAY: No, I have
to think about that too.

00:16:41.024 --> 00:16:42.190
MALE SPEAKER: One more year.

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:46.652
What's next for you?

00:16:46.652 --> 00:16:48.860
AMERIGO GAZAWAY: Well, I
just got confirmed for South

00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:50.490
by Southwest in Austin.

00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:53.470
I'm really excited about that.

00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:56.400
As far as new projects, I like
to keep things under wrap,

00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:59.130
so I can't really
speak on that just yet.

00:16:59.130 --> 00:17:02.280
But I will probably be
premiering a song or two

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:04.450
from my next project
at South by Southwest,

00:17:04.450 --> 00:17:07.650
so stay tuned for that.

00:17:07.650 --> 00:17:12.240
And I'm also working on a
soulful EP with a singer

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:15.770
vocalist by the name of
Xiomara Grace Watson, which

00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:17.680
you can check out
some of her stuff

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:20.990
at Xiomaramusic.com,
with an x, Xiomara.

00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:23.260
MALE SPEAKER: You also
have a show coming up.

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:25.093
AMERIGO GAZAWAY: Oh, I
have a show on Sunday

00:17:25.093 --> 00:17:28.170
with George Clinton,
Funkadelic, P-Funk in Philly,

00:17:28.170 --> 00:17:30.762
so super excited about that.

00:17:30.762 --> 00:17:31.911
And yeah.

00:17:31.911 --> 00:17:32.910
MALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:34.035
AMERIGO GAZAWAY: Questions?

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.590
AUDIENCE: OK, I'll start.

00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:41.540
Back in the day, I used to
DJ for students and student

00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:42.550
parties.

00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:45.760
I encountered my first mashup.

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:50.110
It was Madison Avenue with
Blur, "Don't Call Me Song 2,"

00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:51.380
and my head just like blew up.

00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:54.339
It was like playing two
songs where people, you

00:17:54.339 --> 00:17:56.130
could see them like
going in one direction.

00:17:56.130 --> 00:17:58.213
And then suddenly, like,
the other song showed up,

00:17:58.213 --> 00:18:02.142
and it was fantastic like to
see the reactions of the people.

00:18:02.142 --> 00:18:03.600
At that point, I
realized that that

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:06.150
was like a totally new genre.

00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:10.900
It's going to like bring some
new like music, like you do.

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:13.307
But at the same time,
I realized that like it

00:18:13.307 --> 00:18:15.640
could lead to a situation in
which, like, with copyright

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:17.500
laws like they're
introducing right now,

00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:19.600
it was going to be a
disaster for a lot of people.

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:24.877
Because fair use and sampling,
it has always been like a--

00:18:24.877 --> 00:18:26.210
AMERIGO GAZAWAY: Slippery slope.

00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:28.320
AUDIENCE: --slippery slope,
like a really thin line

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:30.310
on the ground that you'd never
know when you're crossing

00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:30.950
or not.

00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:32.750
But have you, like you mentioned
it before, but have you

00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:34.450
encountered any
of those problems?

00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:36.550
Like, releasing your
albums, do you always

00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:38.830
have to do like
agreements with people

00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:40.720
or have you just,
like, released things

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:42.930
and then, like, figured
out that the FBI was, like,

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:44.510
knocking on your door?

00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:46.080
What is your
experience with that?

00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:47.288
AMERIGO GAZAWAY: Not the FBI.

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:52.940
But yeah, we've received a lot
of opposition to our projects.

00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:54.680
"Bizarre Tribe" is
no longer available

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:59.110
online or for
distribution, and so we've

00:18:59.110 --> 00:19:01.450
had a lot of uphill
battles in terms of that.

00:19:01.450 --> 00:19:04.790
But we just do it anyway
because this is something

00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:06.770
that I'm passionate
about doing, and the fans

00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:07.770
are passionate about it.

00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:11.580
And it's something that, I
think if given the opportunity

00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:14.094
to exist, I think people
see the value in it.

00:19:14.094 --> 00:19:15.510
So like with the
Apple commercial,

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:18.341
I think that was a huge
breakthrough for us

00:19:18.341 --> 00:19:20.590
because, you know, we've
been getting cease and desist

00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:24.570
letters up until now, and so
when we were able to work out

00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:27.320
the deal with the
Apple commercial,

00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:28.730
Apple pays for the licensing.

00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:31.850
Interscope released
the single on iTunes.

00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:34.770
All the content owners
and artists got paid,

00:19:34.770 --> 00:19:39.400
and I think that in itself
is proof that what I do

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:43.950
is a valuable art form
and transformative

00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:49.880
and also can potentially lead to
profit for the original content

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:50.380
owners.

00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:52.660
And so I think that's
one of the things

00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:57.212
that we're trying to
demonstrate with what we do so.

00:19:57.212 --> 00:19:57.920
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:00.617
AMERIGO GAZAWAY: Thank you.

00:20:00.617 --> 00:20:02.950
AUDIENCE: Quick follow up and
also a different question.

00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:06.681
Quick follow up, the friction
between artists and labels,

00:20:06.681 --> 00:20:07.180
right?

00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:09.350
Labels are the main people
that are getting pissed

00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:11.400
that you're taking
their stuff and then

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:14.166
chopping it up and mixing
it with other stuff.

00:20:14.166 --> 00:20:16.290
Are they just being
overprotective in your opinion?

00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:18.660
I mean, as an artist, you
have the same kind of "I need

00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:22.559
to get paid" concerns as any
other artist would hopefully,

00:20:22.559 --> 00:20:25.100
so the fact that the labels are
going after people, you know,

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:27.370
are they just being greedy?

00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:28.997
Who's wrong in this situation?

00:20:28.997 --> 00:20:30.580
I'm just curious to
hear your opinion.

00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:32.800
I mean, obviously there's no
one person clearly in the wrong,

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:33.870
otherwise people would
have done something,

00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:35.516
but I'm curious to your opinion.

00:20:35.516 --> 00:20:37.140
And then also who
you grew up-- why hip

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:39.720
hop, why hip hop in general?

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:42.130
AMERIGO GAZAWAY: Yeah, I
mean, I respect their right.

00:20:42.130 --> 00:20:44.070
You know, like they
definitely have a right

00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:49.360
to protect what they own.

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:54.590
And I'm not really on
the side of just screw

00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:56.000
the record labels.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.700
I really would like
to get to the point

00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:01.870
where we can negotiate
and come to agreements.

00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:09.150
Like, the Apple is an
example and yeah, I mean,

00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:12.270
I think there's just a
lot of things-- a lot

00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:15.370
of room for negotiation
that hasn't really--

00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:17.440
those bridges haven't
really been crossed yet.

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:22.080
And so if anything, by
putting these projects out,

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:25.180
quote unquote, "illegally," it
gets people talking about it,

00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:26.810
and it gets the
conversation going.

00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:29.577
And, you know, I may
not have the solution,

00:21:29.577 --> 00:21:31.660
but if I can get everyone
in this room and a bunch

00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:34.730
of other people thinking about
it and on their minds then

00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:36.610
maybe we can come up
with a solution that

00:21:36.610 --> 00:21:40.840
benefits everybody, myself,
the artist, the record labels.

00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:43.800
And so it's really
just about creating

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:49.790
awareness for what I do and the
value and impact that it has.

00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:51.004
What was your other--

00:21:51.004 --> 00:21:51.920
AUDIENCE: Why hip hop?

00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:52.503
I was curious.

00:21:52.503 --> 00:21:54.365
I mean, Nashville
was a great-- it's

00:21:54.365 --> 00:21:55.800
got sort of a
logical progression

00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:58.520
from blues, soul,
disco, funk, and now

00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:02.080
we finally have hip hop, but
I don't think of Nashville,

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:05.910
right now, as a leading city
in the hip hop industry.

00:22:05.910 --> 00:22:08.222
So I'm curious how
you got into that.

00:22:08.222 --> 00:22:10.430
AMERIGO GAZAWAY: Well, shout
out to my brother Ricky.

00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:11.330
He's over there.

00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:17.041
He put me on to a lot of
hip hop when I was younger.

00:22:17.041 --> 00:22:19.540
When I was younger, I found
this old shoebox full a cassette

00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:23.820
tapes when he left for college,
and none of the cassette tapes

00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:27.030
were in the shoe box, but it was
all album covers, Gang Starr,

00:22:27.030 --> 00:22:28.630
Souls of Mischief, De La Soul.

00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:30.980
And so at the time,
I just started

00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:33.350
buying these tapes
on impulse, you know,

00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:36.710
repurchasing these albums
and listening to them.

00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:43.160
And then, like I said, WRVU,
the radio show, "911 Emergency"

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:46.910
with DJ Egon and Count Basie
was also a big influence for me

00:22:46.910 --> 00:22:49.560
at the time, putting
me on to hip hop

00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:52.196
and getting my gears
turning for hip hop.

00:22:52.196 --> 00:22:54.780
But like I said,
hip hop is what--

00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:56.170
it was really the opposite.

00:22:56.170 --> 00:22:58.290
You know, I was into
hip hop, and then

00:22:58.290 --> 00:23:02.430
that led me to discover
disco and funk and soul

00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:04.910
and blues and jazz
and really dig deeper

00:23:04.910 --> 00:23:06.420
into all those
other genres, and so

00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:08.580
that's why I've
always considered

00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:10.455
hip hop an important
tool for learning

00:23:10.455 --> 00:23:13.919
and a tool for music
discovery through sampling.

00:23:13.919 --> 00:23:15.710
MALE SPEAKER: Cool,
thanks for stopping by.

00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:16.793
AUDIENCE: I appreciate it.

00:23:16.793 --> 00:23:19.040
AMERIGO GAZAWAY: Thank you.

00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:19.980
Over here.

00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:22.360
AUDIENCE: Yep, outside
of the legal issues

00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:25.220
that you guys encounter
with the examples and stuff,

00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:29.750
when an artist like Mos Def
actually does hear the mashup,

00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:33.091
do you ever get any response
from them like this is sick?

00:23:33.091 --> 00:23:33.870
This is amazing?

00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:35.832
MALE SPEAKER: You get
asked to produce a track.

00:23:35.832 --> 00:23:38.040
AMERIGO GAZAWAY: We've gotten
a lot of feedback from,

00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:41.450
you know, Talib
Kweli shouted us out.

00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:45.360
Janis Gaye recently
mentioned in an interview,

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:49.510
they asked her what-- if
she had any favorite remixes

00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:51.940
or reinterpretations,
and she brought me up.

00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:56.430
And The Pharcyde, I was able
to collaborate with them

00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:59.140
and perform with them
at South by Southwest.

00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:01.330
And so, as he mentioned,
a lot of times

00:24:01.330 --> 00:24:03.010
the artists are
in support of it.

00:24:03.010 --> 00:24:06.360
It's just the labels and
the actual publishers

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:09.080
and content owners
that are opposed to it,

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:15.900
and so, yeah, we've gotten a lot
of support from artists so far.

00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:19.550
AUDIENCE: And then also,
I have two more questions.

00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:21.630
First, do you have any shows?

00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:24.160
Are you performing while
you're in the city?

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:27.160
AMERIGO GAZAWAY: No, I'm playing
in Philly on Sunday with George

00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:29.440
Clinton and P-Funk, but
hopefully I'll be back in New

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:31.479
York soon doing some gigs so--

00:24:31.479 --> 00:24:32.270
AUDIENCE: OK, cool.

00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:35.870
And then the tracks that
you, that you actually

00:24:35.870 --> 00:24:38.480
can separate the
samples like the locals

00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:41.720
from the cores and the drums.

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:45.990
How do you actually get
access to that fragmented

00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:50.012
form of the track?

00:24:50.012 --> 00:24:51.470
AMERIGO GAZAWAY:
Just the internet.

00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:55.480
I'm not really-- I don't
really want to tell you where

00:24:55.480 --> 00:25:00.670
because I want it to still
exist for other people tomorrow.

00:25:00.670 --> 00:25:06.935
But also there's, for instance,
the game "Rock Band" or "Guitar

00:25:06.935 --> 00:25:10.340
Hero," those games
actually have a lot

00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:12.696
of the multi tracks for all
those songs broken down.

00:25:12.696 --> 00:25:14.820
So you, you know, when
people are playing the game,

00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:18.360
they're adding the multi tracks
just like I was, one by one.

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:22.660
And so a lot of those actually
came from those games,

00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:26.869
a lot of the multi tracks, but
there's also a handful of them

00:25:26.869 --> 00:25:27.660
floating out there.

00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:31.440
And in the '90s, you
know, and earlier on, it

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:35.050
was more commonplace
for vinyl singles

00:25:35.050 --> 00:25:40.220
to have instrumentals and
acappellas and dub edits

00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:41.720
and stuff like
that on the record.

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:45.580
Now that, I guess, because of
remixing has become so rampant

00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:47.950
and people are trying to
curb that, they're not

00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:50.940
doing it as much, but a
lot of the older stuff,

00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:53.430
you can still find
acappellas for multi track.

00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:55.740
And so I'm always on
the hunt for stuff

00:25:55.740 --> 00:26:01.500
like because it really
changes, you know, the options

00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:05.200
and what's available-- I
can really dig in a lot more

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:07.670
when I have those isolated
stems than when I'm just working

00:26:07.670 --> 00:26:10.317
with the individual song so.

00:26:10.317 --> 00:26:11.510
AUDIENCE: Yep, cool.

00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:12.950
AMERIGO GAZAWAY: Thank you.

00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:13.995
MALE SPEAKER: Last
question, over here.

00:26:13.995 --> 00:26:16.244
AUDIENCE: Who are you listening
to now, not old stuff,

00:26:16.244 --> 00:26:19.280
but current artists.

00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:23.960
AMERIGO GAZAWAY: Current
artists, I guess not current,

00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:24.520
Prince.

00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:27.750
I've been listening to
the new Prince album,

00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:31.670
and the new D'Angelo
is also a really good,

00:26:31.670 --> 00:26:36.356
"Black Messia," and Big KRIT.

00:26:36.356 --> 00:26:39.590
Being from the south, I'm
a huge fan of southern rap,

00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:42.660
and so I've been listening
to his new album,

00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:43.640
"Cadillactica" a lot.

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:46.810
But a lot of funk stuff.

00:26:46.810 --> 00:26:49.310
I'm really excited
for "Tuxedo," which

00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:52.370
is John Mayer or, not John
Mayer, Mayer Hawthorne, excuse

00:26:52.370 --> 00:26:54.250
me, Mayer Hawthorne
and Jake One.

00:26:57.100 --> 00:26:59.340
And what else?

00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:01.713
Run the Jewels, I've
been listening to a lot,

00:27:01.713 --> 00:27:06.684
but yeah, that's probably
what's on my iPod right now.

00:27:06.684 --> 00:27:07.975
MALE SPEAKER: All right, great.

00:27:07.975 --> 00:27:09.920
Hey, it's been great
hanging out with you.

00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:10.420
Thank you.

00:27:13.410 --> 00:27:14.326
Big round of applause.

00:27:14.326 --> 00:27:16.320
