00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.180
- [Mark] Good morning, I hope
you're having an amazing day!

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:03.013
It's Mark Wiens.

00:00:03.013 --> 00:00:05.570
I'm in Sapporo, Japan, but
today we are taking a day trip

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:07.500
to Otaru, which is a little ways outside

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.490
of the city on Ishikari Bay.

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:11.150
They are known for their seafood,

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.810
for their old town and seafood market,

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:16.290
and they're known for uni as
well, which is sea urchin.

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:18.510
So, we're gonna take a day trip there.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:19.820
We're gonna eat some seafood.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.120
We're gonna just walk around.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.050
It's pretty cold, but
we're gonna have fun,

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.090
and I'm gonna share everything
with you in this video.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.030
But to get there, we
gotta first make our way

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:32.390
to Sapporo Station and then
take the train from there.

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:33.864
So we are on our way!

00:00:33.864 --> 00:00:36.781
(upbeat pop music)

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.543
(loud motor vehicle)

00:00:44.543 --> 00:00:47.390
(train skidding)

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.340
In order to get to Sapporo
Station from where we're staying,

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.180
we have to take the tram and then walk,

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.973
and then we'll be at Sapporo Station.

00:00:57.818 --> 00:01:00.735
(upbeat pop music)

00:01:16.921 --> 00:01:20.127
(speaks foreign language)

00:01:20.127 --> 00:01:23.044
(upbeat pop music)

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.000
Made it to JR Sapporo Station.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.323
Bought ticket, 640 yen to Otaru.

00:01:32.681 --> 00:01:36.181
(ticket dispenser beeps)

00:01:37.556 --> 00:01:40.540
Okay, and then should be...

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.305
Is it Track number 2, right?

00:01:43.305 --> 00:01:44.530
Track number 2!

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.447
(upbeat pop music)

00:01:55.059 --> 00:01:57.072
Train is always right on time.

00:01:57.072 --> 00:02:00.996
I believe that it's about
a thirty-minute ride

00:02:00.996 --> 00:02:01.829
to get to Otaru.

00:02:03.722 --> 00:02:05.988
(baby babbling)

00:02:05.988 --> 00:02:08.905
(foreign language)

00:02:17.577 --> 00:02:20.494
(upbeat pop music)

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.470
Okay, welcome to Otaru.

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.030
I think that took about forty
minutes on the local train.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.013
Looks like a very snowy city.

00:02:52.167 --> 00:02:54.150
The plan is, we go to the
first of the fish market

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.760
which is right outside the station.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:56.910
Then we walk around some more.

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.813
Then we go to the canal and
walk around and eat some more.

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.330
Walk outside the station,
immediately to your left,

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:11.330
hike up a flight of stairs,
and this is the seafood market.

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:12.403
Yes!

00:03:12.403 --> 00:03:14.340
This is one of the top reasons

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.580
that I wanted to come to
Otaru in the first place,

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:17.420
to come to the market.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:18.329
Hello!

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:19.240
- [Clerk] (speaks foreign language)

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.130
- Good, thank you.

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.963
From Thailand.

00:03:20.963 --> 00:03:21.796
- [Clerk] Thailand?

00:03:21.796 --> 00:03:22.629
- Yes!

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:24.080
Wow, very nice.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.333
Okay, thank you, thank you!

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.293
Crab... do you have hakkaku?

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:32.730
Oh, you have hakkaku also.

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.563
Yeah, this one is from local, right?

00:03:36.563 --> 00:03:37.396
- Yeah

00:03:38.271 --> 00:03:39.522
- Hakkaku, it's sashimi?

00:03:39.522 --> 00:03:40.360
- Sashimi

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.214
- Sashimi

00:03:41.214 --> 00:03:43.557
- (speaks in foreign language)

00:03:43.557 --> 00:03:44.474
- Oh, okay.

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:46.953
Okay, thank you.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.670
This market is immediately amazing.

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.309
I just stepped inside and
everyone is so friendly!

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:56.220
The seafood is just blooming!

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.573
There's tanks of crabs.

00:03:57.573 --> 00:04:01.406
There's hairy crabs, there's
king crabs, there's fish.

00:04:01.406 --> 00:04:02.543
Wow, this is--

00:04:02.543 --> 00:04:05.068
This is a little seafood alley paradise.

00:04:05.068 --> 00:04:06.106
Thank you.

00:04:06.106 --> 00:04:08.460
Yeah, I want to have one hakkaku, yeah?

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:10.070
- Together, together?

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:11.253
- [Mark] All together, yes.

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:13.732
Awesome.

00:04:13.732 --> 00:04:16.370
I took a little walk all
the way down the market,

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.060
and there's some very popular restaurants,

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.351
very popular stalls, but he's so friendly.

00:04:20.351 --> 00:04:21.184
Thank you.

00:04:21.184 --> 00:04:22.120
(laughing)

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.450
He greeted us as we entered,
that we came back for him.

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:26.283
He's awesome.

00:04:26.283 --> 00:04:27.126
- Youtuber?

00:04:27.126 --> 00:04:28.083
- Yes, youtube, youtube.

00:04:28.083 --> 00:04:29.057
Yes, yes yes.

00:04:29.057 --> 00:04:30.163
(laughs)

00:04:30.163 --> 00:04:32.320
About food, about food.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.373
So, he's so friendly, and so cheerful.

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.953
Um I, there's one fish that
I really wanted to try.

00:04:37.953 --> 00:04:42.100
It's the hakkaku, which
in English is sailfin-

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.160
sailfin something.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.440
But it looks like a dragon,

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.150
it looks like a prehistoric figure--

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:50.420
Swimming figure.

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:51.760
Uh, so we got a couple of those.

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.710
Then I wanted to try the hairy crab.

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.772
What is hairy crab in Japanese?

00:04:55.772 --> 00:04:57.032
Kani..?

00:04:57.032 --> 00:04:57.961
- [Clerk] Japanese?

00:04:57.961 --> 00:04:58.794
- [Mark] Kan-Kani...

00:04:58.794 --> 00:05:01.005
- Kani... Kegani, Japanese, Kegani.

00:05:01.005 --> 00:05:02.075
- Oh, Kegani.

00:05:02.075 --> 00:05:03.228
- Ke-ga-ni

00:05:03.228 --> 00:05:06.203
- Kegani, that's the hairy crab.

00:05:06.203 --> 00:05:07.350
- Hairy crab is very good.
- And then also, ooh,

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.240
and then also uni, which is sea urchin,

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.646
it's very, very famous in Hokkaido.

00:05:10.646 --> 00:05:14.530
Uh, so he said he had
some local sea urchin,

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:15.363
but this-

00:05:15.363 --> 00:05:17.300
Not from this Bay at the moment,

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.390
it's not in season, but from
the other side of Hokkaido,

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:20.254
the uni, yeah?

00:05:20.254 --> 00:05:22.032
Okay, (speaks foreign language)

00:05:22.032 --> 00:05:24.449
- Thank you
- Thank you, okay!

00:05:27.612 --> 00:05:30.107
- [Clerk] 6,500 yen.

00:05:30.107 --> 00:05:32.186
- This one is good one?
- Similar, similar.

00:05:32.186 --> 00:05:33.243
More big, better (laughs)

00:05:33.243 --> 00:05:35.123
- This one is good-good one?

00:05:37.065 --> 00:05:42.065
- This is a good (speaks foreign language)

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:02.500
- Looks like a prehistoric
fish, but he has to like--

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.920
It really takes precision to cut it

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:05.872
and its like a drag

00:06:05.872 --> 00:06:08.170
and then he has to actually
kind of rip off the skin,

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:09.420
almost like a snake skin.

00:06:32.528 --> 00:06:34.940
Hakkaku is only in winter?

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:35.773
Winter time?

00:06:35.773 --> 00:06:36.606
- [Chef] No.

00:06:36.606 --> 00:06:37.809
- [Mark] Or all year?

00:06:37.809 --> 00:06:39.247
- [Chef] Winter time, number one.

00:06:39.247 --> 00:06:40.164
Number one.

00:06:41.676 --> 00:06:44.259
(upbeat music)

00:06:45.952 --> 00:06:48.285
- [Mark] So there's the uni.

00:07:34.016 --> 00:07:36.683
(phone ringing)

00:07:39.056 --> 00:07:41.906
- [Mark] (speaks foreign language)

00:07:41.906 --> 00:07:43.820
Oh, I almost forgot I
ordered the hairy crab

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:45.330
which is still on it's way.

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:50.186
Ah, this is beautiful,
its so fresh it's shining.

00:07:50.186 --> 00:07:54.035
The uni, that color is
unbelievable and that texture,

00:07:54.035 --> 00:07:56.010
ah, but we gotta try the fish first.

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:57.700
In Japanese, it's called the Hakkaku fish.

00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:00.040
In English, it's a Sailfin Poacher,

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:02.310
and I had seen this in some photos,

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:03.380
I knew I wanted to eat it

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:04.950
cause this is local from Hokkaido.

00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:09.330
Um, it is just
extreme-looking with the fan,

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:12.137
with the bone, with the like snout.

00:08:12.137 --> 00:08:15.040
Before adding any soy sauce
or any wasabi or anything,

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:16.290
I'm just gonna try it here.

00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:17.810
Oh, there is a little bit of wasabi

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:19.563
on my chopstick already actually.

00:08:21.824 --> 00:08:22.657
Mmmm.

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:26.237
Wow, it's like...

00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:31.270
It's not like melt in
your mouth, tender-soft.

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:34.140
Has a little bit of texture
to it, flavor is so pure

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:35.600
it's almost like milky.

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:38.250
I'm gonna go in for a little
soy sauce and wasabi next time.

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:40.330
For this bite I will put a little bit of--

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:43.510
apply a little bit of
wasabi onto the actual fish

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:45.470
on my chopsticks then dip.

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:46.603
Little dip.

00:08:49.534 --> 00:08:51.000
Mmmm.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.980
Oh yeah, that's wonderful.

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:55.010
Its, I mean...

00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:57.650
it's fresh, it's creamy...

00:08:57.650 --> 00:08:59.130
its yeah.

00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:02.490
That's just a delicious
sashimi experience.

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:04.400
And the presentation, I
can't get over the beauty

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:07.990
of the presentation, how
they cut it, how they--

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:12.300
The expertise it takes him
to cut this fish as sashimi.

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:13.943
Another piece before we move on.

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:18.163
Okay, let's move onto to the uni bowl.

00:09:19.059 --> 00:09:22.200
I don't know if I've ever
been so excited to eat uni

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:25.000
and he literally put
on an entire box of uni

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.540
onto a base of rice.

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:30.840
And a lot of the best uni
from Japan is from Hokkaido,

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:32.838
the island of Hokkaido,
somewhere along the seas.

00:09:32.838 --> 00:09:36.500
This particular uni is
not from Otaru today,

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:40.835
but it is from Hokkaido, it
is from the the east coast,

00:09:40.835 --> 00:09:44.870
the owner explained to me,
but it's fresh, it's local.

00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:46.957
It is the, even--

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:50.730
It's not even all orange,
like the different colors.

00:09:50.730 --> 00:09:52.850
The oranges, the hues, the yellows,

00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:54.642
like some are more saturated than others.

00:09:54.642 --> 00:09:56.958
And that texture, it looks like,

00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:59.120
it looks like your tongue
almost, the texture.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:01.205
That little bumpy, bumpiness.

00:10:01.205 --> 00:10:03.788
(upbeat music)

00:10:09.069 --> 00:10:11.327
Wow!

00:10:11.327 --> 00:10:14.308
It's just like it's melting on my tongue.

00:10:14.308 --> 00:10:15.990
Oh that is...

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:18.764
That is outrageously delicious.

00:10:18.764 --> 00:10:22.820
It's so creamy!

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:26.833
I love that like
bitter-sea-foodiness of it.

00:10:26.833 --> 00:10:30.583
The complexity of taste then
paired with that warm rice,

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:32.313
wow.

00:10:32.313 --> 00:10:35.540
Beyond incredible and
what's amazing about this

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:39.990
is it's nothing other than rice, the uni,

00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:42.259
and that's it, there's nothing on that.

00:10:42.259 --> 00:10:43.304
That's just the pureness,

00:10:43.304 --> 00:10:46.510
that's just relying on the uni itself.

00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:47.343
Wow.

00:10:47.343 --> 00:10:49.840
That is like, it's just like melting,

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:51.490
you don't even need to chew that.

00:10:52.381 --> 00:10:54.964
(upbeat music)

00:10:56.513 --> 00:10:59.120
That is just uni dreams

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:03.463
and the nuttiness, wow, I can
taste almonds in that uni.

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:06.610
To be honest its so good.

00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:07.827
I don't even need,

00:11:07.827 --> 00:11:10.173
I don't even feel the
need to add anything.

00:11:10.173 --> 00:11:12.103
Okay, maybe a little bit of wasabi.

00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:17.930
And then yeah, as you keep
on stirring it around,

00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:19.499
as you keep mixing it
with your chopsticks,

00:11:19.499 --> 00:11:21.760
it will literally, just starts to melt

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:23.613
like your rice starts to coat in uni.

00:11:25.719 --> 00:11:27.348
Whoa.

00:11:27.348 --> 00:11:31.502
With that little bit of
wasabi, that is awesome.

00:11:31.502 --> 00:11:34.085
(upbeat music)

00:11:44.212 --> 00:11:47.530
I'm blown away, it's like unbelievable.

00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:49.827
Like I've had uni, I've had like--

00:11:51.352 --> 00:11:54.369
I had uni but it's always
like just one bite,

00:11:54.369 --> 00:11:58.425
just enough to taste to
like wet your appetite.

00:11:58.425 --> 00:12:00.453
Having an entire bowl of it,

00:12:01.512 --> 00:12:03.740
this is just an uni game changer.

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:07.363
This is a sea urchin,
like dream come true.

00:12:08.759 --> 00:12:11.483
Okay, let's move on to the hairy crab.

00:12:12.622 --> 00:12:15.205
(upbeat music)

00:12:19.299 --> 00:12:21.299
(snips)

00:12:38.273 --> 00:12:41.190
Alright so, hairy crab also
known as the horse hair crab.

00:12:41.190 --> 00:12:46.042
This is another very famous
crab to eat in Japan.

00:12:46.042 --> 00:12:47.730
Especially in Hokkaido.

00:12:47.730 --> 00:12:50.450
And its also, uh, the hairy
crab is very well known

00:12:50.450 --> 00:12:54.160
for the roe inside the head,
but you can also eat the legs,

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:55.307
the pincers the claws the body.

00:12:55.307 --> 00:12:58.510
Um, but let's try that, they
even put a spoon directly

00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:00.853
into the head so you can
just begin with that.

00:13:00.853 --> 00:13:02.730
Okay so this will be my first
time to ever eat a hairy crab.

00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:05.953
And that, it really does
feel like, like hair.

00:13:05.953 --> 00:13:08.550
It's so soft actually, that's amazing.

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:10.683
Alright let's try some of that head roe.

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:16.933
Wow!

00:13:18.474 --> 00:13:20.630
I was not expecting that.

00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:22.669
Oh, oh that is--

00:13:22.669 --> 00:13:25.036
Oh wow that's stunning!

00:13:25.036 --> 00:13:28.890
Its' like a burst of
saltiness but you taste like

00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:30.140
the bitterness of the roe,

00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:33.270
you taste like the creaminess
of it, it's kind of like...

00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:36.750
I don't even, I--

00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:37.583
I'm almost--

00:13:37.583 --> 00:13:38.680
This is one of those things
we're I'm kind of stumped

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:40.688
and that's my first tie to ever try it.

00:13:40.688 --> 00:13:43.150
That's like roe unlike
any other roe I've had

00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:44.380
and I like how it's kind of runny,

00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:47.291
it's kind of like liquid-y,
it's almost like watery.

00:13:47.291 --> 00:13:51.283
But then actually like
creamy at the same time.

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:55.280
That might be the best pudding
I've ever had in my life.

00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:57.350
Moving on for the legs.

00:13:57.350 --> 00:13:59.290
Yeah, it really is so awesomely hairy.

00:13:59.290 --> 00:14:01.723
It's not sharp at all,
just like so fluffy.

00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:04.433
Okay, it is a little bit spiky.

00:14:04.433 --> 00:14:07.753
Move that crab meat, oh, very flaky.

00:14:11.077 --> 00:14:13.340
Mmm-mmm.

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:17.040
Whoa, really sweet, it's
stringy, it's flaky,

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:20.279
it's almost like slightly
fishy-tasting, that's incredible.

00:14:20.279 --> 00:14:21.460
Wow.

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:23.126
And then the combination, both the meat

00:14:23.126 --> 00:14:25.730
and the eggs, the roe together.

00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:29.140
That's sensational,
absolutely sensational.

00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:31.970
Incredibly pure and fresh.

00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:35.000
And then finally this section
which is kind of like the--

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.070
that's in the section between
the head, the whole body

00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:39.395
and the legs.

00:14:39.395 --> 00:14:42.070
Maybe it's easier, this
is like the baseball mitt

00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:43.029
is what I like to call it.

00:14:43.029 --> 00:14:46.133
Think it's easier to pick this
up, it looks like fingers.

00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:49.610
You could wave at someone with this.

00:14:53.830 --> 00:14:55.820
Yeah, that is stunning.

00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:58.144
Full of meat, it's so sweet.

00:14:58.144 --> 00:14:58.977
Mm.

00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:02.539
This is like the ultimate--

00:15:02.539 --> 00:15:06.760
it's really like crab
complexity in flavor.

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:10.800
You know you taste the red
king crab, it unbelievable,

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:13.875
it's so good, it's sweet, um

00:15:13.875 --> 00:15:17.834
but it doesn't have
that bitter complexity.

00:15:17.834 --> 00:15:20.334
The hairy crab has more
of that bitter complexity.

00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:24.880
It's like really the full flavor of crab.

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:27.440
And as you keep on reaching,
its so incredibly stringy,

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:28.273
look at that.

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:34.243
As you dig it out,
they're just like strands.

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:42.840
The legs and the claws are just

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:45.433
like ultimate crab strandiness.

00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:49.362
They just like strand apart.

00:15:49.362 --> 00:15:50.310
Mmm!

00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:53.680
And the flavor, it's like
the most vibrant crab flavor.

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:57.063
I think a little hairy
strand went down my sleeve.

00:16:02.513 --> 00:16:03.383
Wow.

00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:08.930
This was a spectacular, spectacular meal.

00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:11.990
This market alone, is like enough reason

00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:15.860
to come straight to Otaru from
anywhere you are in Japan.

00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:16.860
In the world!

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:19.038
What is the name of your shop?

00:16:19.038 --> 00:16:22.140
- My restaurant is Ka-wa-shi-ma.

00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:23.103
- [Mark] Kawashima.

00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:27.960
- My restaurant is, sen-guo-shoku-do

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:30.550
ka-wa-shi-ma

00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:31.556
Okay?

00:16:31.556 --> 00:16:32.834
- [Mark] Very good
- Thank you.

00:16:32.834 --> 00:16:33.667
- [Mark] (speak foreign language)

00:16:33.667 --> 00:16:35.204
Very good, thank you very much.

00:16:35.204 --> 00:16:36.353
Oh this is-okay.

00:16:36.353 --> 00:16:37.840
(speak foreign language)

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:38.911
Thank you, thank you.

00:16:38.911 --> 00:16:41.120
Goodbye, thankyou.

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:44.240
Man, what an amazing meal,
what an amazing place

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:47.480
and yeah like, there are
many places to choose from

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:49.610
but they are so friendly they're so nice,

00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:52.520
they're so welcoming here
and they have the full range

00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:54.360
of seafood that you could want,

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:56.440
massive king crabs, hairy crabs,

00:16:56.440 --> 00:17:00.040
hanasaki crabs, the fish, the...

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:03.093
Yeah the uni bowl is just unbelievable.

00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:07.360
Step outside, the market packed now.

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:09.920
Ah, but this is a really,
like it's pretty small

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:13.030
its so friendly there, it's
just loaded with seafood.

00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:14.960
Then that was one of those meals...

00:17:15.807 --> 00:17:17.543
Wow, look at that plate of food.

00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:23.690
That was one of those meals
where like I could just,

00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:25.250
right there, it's only the morning,

00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:27.820
but I could straight up
call it a day, right now,

00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:28.850
I'm that happy.

00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:29.683
Hello, how are you?

00:17:29.683 --> 00:17:31.475
- Hello, how are you?

00:17:31.475 --> 00:17:32.308
Hi.

00:17:33.296 --> 00:17:37.043
- Nice to meet you.

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:44.360
Back outside and from
here we're gonna walk over

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:46.570
to the canal side, one of
the most famous things to do

00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:49.580
in Otaru is walk along the
canal, I think there's shops,

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:51.120
there's little restaurants,

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:52.420
it's just a nice place to walk around.

00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:53.920
That's where we're up to next.

00:17:55.845 --> 00:17:58.428
(upbeat music)

00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:02.731
We made it to the famous
and historic Otaru canal

00:18:02.731 --> 00:18:06.030
which is one of the icons of the city,

00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:09.340
there's old warehouses
and shops, and restaurants

00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:13.040
and now kind of like souvenir
shops along the canal.

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:14.390
So you can just walk along the canal,

00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:16.390
there's little museums as well to visit.

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:21.913
Walking through a valley
of snow right now.

00:18:23.530 --> 00:18:26.630
Not totally sure what we are doing,

00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:27.864
but we're just taking a stroll

00:18:27.864 --> 00:18:30.127
and that's what lot's
of people do in Otaru.

00:18:30.127 --> 00:18:32.853
Even when it's freezing cold.

00:18:35.650 --> 00:18:37.890
This reminds me of like a bobsled track.

00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:39.832
I think you could take
a bobsled though here.

00:18:39.832 --> 00:18:42.415
(upbeat music)

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:56.255
We're just kind of walking
around, not that much to do

00:18:56.255 --> 00:18:59.030
and then we just stopped
at this little corner

00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:01.650
that has some little snacks,
some little restaurants.

00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:04.413
This is uh, you can just
order the melon ice cream.

00:19:09.577 --> 00:19:10.711
Mmm, pretty good.

00:19:10.711 --> 00:19:12.650
Can I have the Hokkaido fried chicken?

00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:13.483
Yes, one please.

00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:16.490
(speaks foreign language)

00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:18.142
Thank you.

00:19:18.142 --> 00:19:20.350
I'm not so huge on the sweet snacks.

00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:22.943
So I decided to try some
Hokkaido fried chicken.

00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:28.540
You can see like almost
the crackling on the skin,

00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:30.883
it's just like completely golden crispy.

00:19:35.554 --> 00:19:36.953
O-ho-ho-ho.

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:40.790
Wow.

00:19:40.790 --> 00:19:44.370
Okay, it is like slightly
better with maybe like rice

00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:45.370
or mochiko flour.

00:19:45.370 --> 00:19:46.631
That tastes incredible though.

00:19:46.631 --> 00:19:47.980
You can taste the ginger on it.

00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:50.788
And it's so warm and nice and crunchy.

00:19:50.788 --> 00:19:52.958
Oh, that's delicious.

00:19:52.958 --> 00:19:55.595
(upbeat music)

00:19:55.595 --> 00:19:56.428
Mmm.

00:19:57.620 --> 00:19:58.533
It's so good.

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:03.260
And on that note of fried chicken

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:05.310
I am going end this video in Otaru,

00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:07.870
we're just gonna walk
around, not really do much

00:20:07.870 --> 00:20:09.840
and then head back to Sapporo.

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:11.500
Definitely the highlight for me

00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:14.434
and well worth your visit coming here,

00:20:14.434 --> 00:20:17.130
to visit Otaru is for that seafood market.

00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:22.130
And that uni bowl, that
was just uni of your dreams

00:20:22.690 --> 00:20:27.130
in an entire bowl, not just
a single bite of it, so good.

00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:29.120
That was, yeah, unbelievably good.

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:30.850
Huge thank you for watching this video,

00:20:30.850 --> 00:20:32.710

thumbs up if you enjoyed it.
