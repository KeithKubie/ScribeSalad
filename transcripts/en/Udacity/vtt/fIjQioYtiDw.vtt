00:00:00.565 --> 00:00:02.570
Well, I can think of at two reasons why my

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:06.000
computer science professor from college may be upset with the quality

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.810
of this code. The first is that I'm doing something

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:13.090
repetitive inside my code. Things like move forward, turn right, move

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:15.860
forward, turn right. I do that four times, but I

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.310
don't use any sort of a loop. Another reason is that

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.570
the name of my function is draw_square. Which I do.

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.650
But then I go ahead and draw a circle inside that

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.190
function also. That doesn't seem quite logical to me.

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.310
So, based on those two ideas, what changes would you

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.450
make to the code that we've written thus far

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.300
to make it more usable? I want you to make

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.420
those changes and then upload a screenshot of the

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.700
code to the discussion forum. Here's an extra credit assignment,

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.510
which is to create a third turtle, and this one

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.640
will draw a triangle. Once you are done with that,

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.650
I want you to upload a screenshot of the new output to the discussion

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.940
forum. Make sure you check this box

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.920
after you've submitted your responses to the forum.
