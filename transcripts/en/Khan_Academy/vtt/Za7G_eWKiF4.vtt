00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.190
The marching band is holding a
raffle at a football game with

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:05.340
two prizes.

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.790
After the first ticket is pulled
out and the winner

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.100
determined, the ticket is
taped to the prize.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.070
The next ticket is pulled out to
determine the winner of the

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.560
second prize.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.660
Are the two events
independent?

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:19.890
Explain.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.480
Now before we even think about
this exact case, let's think

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.040
about what it means for events
to be independent.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.980
It means that the outcome of one
event doesn't affect the

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.220
outcome of the other event.

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.040
Now in this situation, the first
event-- after the first

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.650
ticket is pulled out and the
winner determined-- the ticket

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.410
is taped to the prize.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.990
Then the next ticket is pulled
out to determine the winner of

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:45.360
the second prize.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.490
Now, the winner of the second
prize-- the possible winners,

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:53.220
the possible outcomes for the
second prize, is dependent on

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.890
who was pulled out for
the first prize.

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.300
You can imagine if there's
three tickets, let's say

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.510
there's tickets A, B,
and C in the bag.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:12.020
And for the first prize,
they pull out ticket A.

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.430
That's for the first prize.

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.110
Now, when we think about who
could be pulled out for the

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:24.000
second prize, it's only going
to be tickets B or C.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.800
Now the first prize could
have gone the other way.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.260
It could have been
A, B, and C.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.120
The first prize could have
gone to ticket B.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.120
And then the possible outcomes
for the second prize

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.940
would be A or C.

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.390
So the possible outcomes for
the second event, for the

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:49.500
second prize, are completely
dependent on what happened or

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.310
what ticket was pulled out
for the first prize.

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.440
So these are not independent
events.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.500
The second event-- the outcomes
for it, are dependent

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.180
on what happened in
the first event.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.450
So they are not independent.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.949
The way that we could have
made them independent is,

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:12.330
after the first ticket was
pulled out, if they just wrote

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.170
down the name or something,
and then put

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.660
that ticket back in.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:16.780
Instead they taped
it to the prize.

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.550
But if they put that ticket
back in, then the second

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.260
prize, it would have still had
all the tickets there.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.300
It wouldn't have mattered who
was picked out in the first

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:26.980
time because their name was just
written down, but their

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.210
ticket was put back in.

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.290
And then you would have
been independent.

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.980
So if you had replaced the
ticket, you would have been

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:32.720
independent.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.748
But since they didn't replace
the ticket, they taped it to

00:02:34.748 --> 00:02:38.510
the prize, these are not
independent events.
