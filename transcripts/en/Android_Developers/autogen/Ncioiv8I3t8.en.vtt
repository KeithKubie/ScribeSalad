00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.420
 My name is Max. 

00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:06.030
 I am a partner manager for Google Play in Berlin. 

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:13.090
 My daily interaction is 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:14.565
 Communicate with app developers 

00:00:14.565 --> 00:00:18.230
 Please help me reset my notes? 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.680
 Discussed throughout the emerging device ecosystem 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:28.300
 How to develop a correct interaction strategy 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.020
 Although from the current point of view 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.500
 The main platform for your interaction with customers 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.220
 Is a smartphone 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.670
 But we think 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.986
 A complete ecosystem of intelligent networking devices 

00:00:42.986 --> 00:00:47.270
 Will become the main interactive platform 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.650
 Such as smart TV 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:52.680
 Smart watch, smart car 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.830
 These devices will bring new ways for user interaction 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.760
 We can see the development of beacon deployment 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.680
 Although it is still in its early stages 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.190
 But it will surely continue to grow and develop in the future. 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.790
 And with the development of the Internet of Things growing 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.310
 It will also create new opportunities for you. 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.360
 Let you interact with users in the real world 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:19.390
 We saw this slide in Mateo's presentation before. 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.940
 I think this slide accurately captures the focus. 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.970
 For developers, the key challenge is 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.920
 Find the right strategy to get the most out of it 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.310
 Evolving networked device ecosystem 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.690
 We found after observing various categories of applications. 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:46.570
 Interact with your app regularly 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.740
 Helps build loyalty to your audience 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.760
 Thereby having a better chance of cultivating long-term customers 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.960
 Or establish a long-term relationship with the user 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.740
 So today I will introduce to you. 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.880
 In the era of "one person, many machines" 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.375
 How to develop a sensible interactive strategy 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.750
 Oh, sorry! I am not standing in the spotlight 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.430
 In this more complex world 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.620
 Developers are constantly looking for new answers 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:25.860
 To solve their problems 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.180
 So how do you target interactions with users? 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.130
 Personalized adjustments and customizations? 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.400
 How to make the most of these emerging 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.276
 Emerging types of devices? 

00:02:35.276 --> 00:02:38.200
 How to develop a sensible interactive strategy for this situation? 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.950
 How to make users connect with others 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.690
 Interact with the surrounding environment? 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.760
 In the next 20 minutes or so 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.330
 We will talk about how Google helps you. 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.147
 Looking for satisfactory answers to these questions 

00:02:51.147 --> 00:02:52.355
 And develop a sound strategy 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.710
 Let’s first introduce how to tailor the interaction. 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:01.890
 This chart shows the data of the United States. 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.420
 But it also works in many European countries. 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:06.860
 Please think about it now. 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:13.050
 Next year, users who use your app on their smartphones 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.410
 60% will also be able to use your app on your tablet 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.430
 I think this number is quite impressive. 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:25.210
 this means 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:29.480
 If your service, application or product 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.730
 Need to rely on user login to provide personalized content or services 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.630
 Or track the value of your advertising channel 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:40.260
 Basically, you need to find a way 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.000
 On all devices used by your users 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.520
 Give them an easy and smooth login experience 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.390
 And Google can help you 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.290
 Today, I want to introduce you to Smart Lock (password specific) 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.610
 This is a lightweight API for Android and Chrome. 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:03.930
 Mainly used to store your users 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.320
 Login information used on the web and on Android 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.700
 It will remember that your users are using email and passwords 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.360
 Still using Google login or Facebook 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.529
 Authenticate in your app 

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:20.279
 If the user performs these actions online 

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:22.660
 Smart Lock (password specific) will do the same on Android 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.400
 User-entered credentials 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.510
 Will also be successfully synchronized in the background 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.620
 All devices it logs in to 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:37.100
 That is sync to Android smartphone tablet and Chrome 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.570
 Let's take a look at the actual efficacy of this feature. 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:44.350
 If you have web content 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.590
 One of your users has previously been authenticated on the site 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.390
 But now it’s your first time installing your app. 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:53.030
 Then the user will not see the login screen 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:54.960
 Or a prompt asking for a password 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.280
 But will let them log in automatically 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.370
 We can see that 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.190
 A partner who uses this feature in the market 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:09.250
 Allow 10% of your audience to sign in immediately on Android 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:13.500
 Because they have already developed a huge group of login users on the website. 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.780
 If the user has registered multiple accounts 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:18.770
 Smart Lock will ask the user 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.340
 Sign in with your Gmail account 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.840
 Still using a Hotmail account to log in? 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.780
 For you, this means 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:31.000
 When the user switches between platforms or devices 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.080
 They won’t see the login prompt so there won’t be users leaving your app. 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.520
 Users will appear in your app soon 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.960
 But you will still meet 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.530
 User registration for the first time 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:47.190
 When a user opens an account in your app 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:52.090
 A prompt will appear in the app asking if the user wants to save the password. 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:55.940
 Or do you want to sign in with your Google account? 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:58.290
 After that, the feature will remember the user's choice. 

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:03.540
 And provide the same choice when users use your app on a tablet or on a website. 

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:08.480
 About 50% to 60% of users see the prompt 

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:09.134
 Will agree with this option 

00:06:09.134 --> 00:06:10.550
 We believe that we can do better 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:14.420
 The method is to improve the user experience and prompt process 

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:18.460
 We have a partner who uses this feature called Orbit. 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:21.170
 They found that they logged in via an Android device 

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:23.830
 User population increased by 5% 

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:28.200
 And it’s done by just showing this prompt. 

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:33.010
 Therefore, it is recommended that you work on all different devices. 

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:34.940
 Confirm the identity of your users 

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:39.120
 And let them switch devices 

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:43.060
 Easy to authenticate 

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:47.360
 Next, I want to give you a brief introduction. 

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.070
 Why notifications are important user interaction strategies 

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:50.950
 And introduce the utilities we provide 

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:58.220
 We all saw that notifications are a very important tool. 

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:01.210
 Ensure that users can keep returning 

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:06.820
 But if you want to have a substantial impact on attractiveness 

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:09.310
 You need to ask yourself a few important questions 

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:12.090
 In order to develop a notification strategy 

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:14.250
 You need to identify a key goal 

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:16.350
 Let's take a look at "Share the Meal". What does the developer do? 

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:20.260
 Their key goal is to raise donations 

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:21.950
 So when the developer sends you a notification 

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:24.500
 I hope you can open the app and donate 

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:26.520
 In addition, they also want to know 

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:29.370
 The specific environment and time when the system sends notifications 

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:32.160
 When you receive the notice 

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.820
 May be having breakfast, lunch or dinner 

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:37.630
 And the time or frequency of sending notifications 

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:40.880
 May be once a week, once a month or even once a day 

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:43.160
 After solving the above problem 

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.750
 You still need to figure it out 

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:49.700
 How to target notifications 

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:54.440
 Users in different groups? 

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:58.330
 In addition, you still need to think 

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:01.310
 What technical resources do you want to invest in? 

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:02.520
 To actually implement your notification strategy 

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:05.990
 Google Cloud Messaging is a free notification service provided by Google 

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:09.470
 Can really help you achieve 

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:11.380
 First-rate notification strategy 

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:13.370
 And applies to all use cases 

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:17.560
 You can use this service to send messages for background thinking 

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:21.000
 And implementing messaging 

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.210
 As for the use case 

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:26.180
 You can enable messaging across devices platforms 

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:29.790
 This way, if someone praises your photo on any device 

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:33.520
 You will be notified on all devices 

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:36.750
 The advantage of this service is that it is built on Google infrastructure. 

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:40.000
 Very reliable when dealing with high message loads 

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.230
 So you don’t have to worry about being unable to 

00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:44.960
 Cover your users 

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.800
 In addition, the service consumes less power 

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:48.750
 This is great 

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:50.890
 Because your app doesn't need to fetch data from your server 

00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:55.860
 When implementing the strategy 

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:57.850
 This service can radically reduce your engineering complexity 

00:08:57.850 --> 00:08:59.480
 And the best part is that this feature is completely free 

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:02.110
 It has all the features of the beta 

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:06.990
 And there are no restrictions on use. 

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:09.410
 I want to focus on an important function below. 

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:13.450
 Oh, there is a small logo missing here. 

00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:16.350
 There should have been a cloud messaging service logo here. 

00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:20.400
 I want to introduce a new feature that is highly inquiring. 

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:24.960
 That is the topic messaging function 

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:26.360
 The logo is here? 

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:31.850
 You can assign users to individual topics 

00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:35.010
 First, you need to create a list of topics. 

00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:36.780
 They refer to this list as an app marketing list. 

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:40.670
 Then you can automatically assign users to this list 

00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:45.110
 This allows a group of devices to subscribe to the topic. 

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:48.730
 Alternatively, you can also ask the user to log in. 

00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:51.150
 At this time, you can ask the user such a small question. 

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:53.600
 Are you an application marketing manager? Or ask a similar question 

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:57.340
 Then you can send a message to Google and simply explain 

00:09:57.340 --> 00:10:00.400
 You want to open a new beta test via the topic message 

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:03.150
 And send relevant messages to the topic app marketing list 

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:05.450
 Then you don't have to worry anymore 

00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:07.260
 Any subscription management work 

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.210
 Because Google will help you get everything done. 

00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:12.000
 The benefit of this service is 

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.820
 You can do it quickly and efficiently 

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:15.710
 Implement subscription 

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:17.260
 Currently, this service is still in beta 

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:20.650
 Therefore, the maximum number of subscribers per app is 1 million. 

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:27.520
 The part of tailored interaction has been finished 

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:32.650
 Next, I will continue to introduce 

00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:35.750
 How to extend your interaction strategy to other devices 

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:39.080
 Android continues to expand the scope of services 

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:45.670
 From mobile phones and tablets to TV, wearables and automotive 

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:50.350
 Android and Play provide you with a platform 

00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:53.980
 But only with apps built by developers 

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:57.380
 These platforms can really play a real role 

00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:59.960
 And create value for users 

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:03.570
 Currently, this is still a very new field. 

00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:07.090
 Therefore, you can take advantage of this opportunity. 

00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:11.610
 Thinking about how to target these new devices and platforms 

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:13.500
 Tailored interactive strategy 

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:16.840
 We are very much looking forward to seeing 

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:19.870
 Creative ideas of all of you 

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:23.670
 When it comes to the Wear platform, I will mention three use cases here. 

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:26.720
 These use cases are sorted according to the difficulty and complexity of the integration work. 

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:31.500
 You can refer to these practices 

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:35.330
 Reach the Wear platform and users of smart watches to use your app again 

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:37.330
 And interact with them 

00:11:37.330 --> 00:11:41.270
 So the notification function is still very important. 

00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:43.080
 Because most notifications don't need to be set up anymore. 

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:44.660
 If you already have an Android device 

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:47.620
 Optimize notifications 

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:49.970
 Then these notifications can already be used on Wear. 

00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:55.740
 If you use the action buttons to improve your notifications 

00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:59.320
 Then these operations 

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:00.490
 Will automatically function on the Wear device automatically 

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:04.150
 In addition, you can also use some great enhancements specifically for Wear. 

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:07.730
 Such as scratch pads, pages, and voice responses 

00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:11.360
 The dial theme is also a great exposure medium 

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:13.520
 Because it can make your brand or application 

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:17.110
 Displayed on the user's watch 

00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:20.660
 Quite conspicuous 

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:22.740
 Moreover, watches are also the personal devices that users view most often. 

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:27.120
 So you can apply app related updates 

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:29.510
 Pushing to the dial theme will have unexpected effects. 

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:32.750
 The hardest thing to do is to create an app. 

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:35.170
 So you can build these apps 

00:12:35.170 --> 00:12:37.550
 And let it run on the Wear device 

00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:42.060
 These apps can do almost everything a smartphone app can do. 

00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:44.100
 Therefore, these applications can be used with these applications. 

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:46.660
 Sensor on Wear device 

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:50.970
 We will talk about some use cases later. 

00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:58.300
 In order to provide a great Wear experience 

00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:02.030
 We have been innovating since the launch of Wear last year. 

00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:03.960
 In fact, we have made great progress 

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:06.170
 I want to introduce an important feature in particular. 

00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:09.050
 That is the "always on" feature. 

00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:12.530
 Roughly speaking, this feature can make your app 

00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:16.030
 Always showing it at the top, it consumes very little power 

00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:19.270
 And the update interval is longer 

00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:21.280
 Updated approximately every 10 seconds 

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:24.210
 Such as running applications 

00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:27.530
 Can show the distance you have ran 

00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:31.700
 Or show the gate information when you walk into the airport 

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:35.860
 And don’t need to waste too much power 

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:38.310
 Will not degrade the performance of wearable devices 

00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:43.090
 In addition, we also launched the dial theme 

00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:46.470
 And is an interactive dial theme 

00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:49.900
 In general, you just tap the dial theme 

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:54.730
 Or tap the custom watch face 

00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:55.990
 Show other content or more related content 

00:13:55.990 --> 00:14:00.890
 For example, just tap the watch face and tap the calendar button. 

00:14:00.890 --> 00:14:02.980
 You can view your day’s schedule 

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:05.440
 No need to open the app at all 

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:08.430
 In addition, we have released other upgrades. 

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:11.090
 For example, we allow apps to use Wi-Fi 

00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:13.530
 This way, this feature can provide you with a lot of convenience when your phone is not around. 

00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:17.000
 You can use built-in GPS. This feature is very important for running applications. 

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.470
 You can also use the Maps API 

00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:21.760
 On the Wear device 

00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:24.630
 Enjoy a great map experience 

00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:28.720
 And we also support iOS now. 

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:30.110
 Next, I will give a few good examples. 

00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:31.530
 One of them is The Guardian. 

00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:36.910
 Loading time is a bit long 

00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:40.550
 The Guardian will be directly on your watch. 

00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:42.010
 Show notifications for the latest news 

00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:44.210
 If you are interested in this news 

00:14:44.210 --> 00:14:46.150
 You can make a mark 

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:49.820
 And save this news so that you can read it later on your phone. 

00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:52.640
 City Mapper also has successful use cases 

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:56.150
 It can plan the route between the two locations for you to travel freely in most major cities. 

00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:58.290
 And the "always on" feature saves power 

00:14:58.290 --> 00:15:00.640
 Eliminate your concerns about running out of power on your way to work in London 

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:02.640
 American Airlines is also an excellent use case 

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:05.820
 You can go through your own watch 

00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:07.662
 View all your flight information 

00:15:07.662 --> 00:15:09.870
 This way, when you forget your seat number 

00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:12.100
 You don’t have to take out your phone all the time to check it out. 

00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:15.610
 What's more, you may still have big bags of luggage in your hand. 

00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:18.260
 What's Up is also very well done 

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:22.510
 They enhanced their Wear app 

00:15:22.510 --> 00:15:23.960
 So sometimes you don’t even have to open your phone 

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:26.560
 You can reply directly from your watch 

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:29.390
 Next is the fitness app I talked about before. 

00:15:29.390 --> 00:15:32.430
 You can choose to use the "always on" mode 

00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:35.720
 And check your running distance at any time while running 

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:38.130
 And the time it takes to run 

00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:42.730
 Then there is the trip, it should be music. 

00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:45.185
 You can browse your playlists smoothly with Spotify 

00:15:45.185 --> 00:15:46.560
 If you are at home your phone is charging with a power plug 

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:49.730
 And you are walking around again 

00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:53.210
 You can control music playback by pressing the play button 

00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:57.320
 In this way, you can comfortably lie on the sofa. 

00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:00.430
 Without getting up and getting a mobile phone 

00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:04.230
 Next, we will also briefly introduce 

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:04.940
 TV experience service 

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:08.660
 We can use Google Cast and AndroidTV 

00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:11.120
 First talk about Cast, this is a technology. 

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:16.160
 With this technology you can do it wirelessly 

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:19.790
 Put your favorite entertainment, apps, or websites on your phone or phone 

00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:21.850
 Project to your TV or sound system 

00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:25.270
 Cast is very popular 

00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:28.780
 We sold more than 17 million devices worldwide 

00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:33.580
 You can buy Cast in 35,000 stores in 26 countries. 

00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:36.950
 This is actually a mobile platform 

00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:38.860
 Well catered to consumer trends 

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:42.290
 And we found 

00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:45.470
 Equipment usage increased by 60% year-on-year 

00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:49.370
 There are already 22,000 apps that support Cast 

00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:52.820
 AndroidTV is well designed for multiple uses 

00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:55.390
 It is to a greater extent for users to enjoy the experience of viewing content on a large screen. 

00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:57.170
 You just sit comfortably on the sofa. 

00:16:57.170 --> 00:16:59.880
 If you don't know what program you want to watch. 

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:02.400
 Just turn on your smart TV. 

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:06.410
 Our goal is to create such an experience. 

00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:12.750
 You just have to sit in the living room with ease 

00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:14.579
 Be able to discover new media content 

00:17:14.579 --> 00:17:16.950
 We have some partners 

00:17:16.950 --> 00:17:22.050
 It is itself a TV supplier such as Sony, Philips and Grundig 

00:17:22.050 --> 00:17:25.380
 In addition, we are with set-top boxes and game console manufacturers. 

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:25.880
 There is also cooperation 

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:29.370
 So, we launched the Nexus device, NVIDIA 

00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:31.040
 Huawei and Razer devices 

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:34.800
 Because it is also a huge gaming platform 

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:38.380
 Technically, the working principle of Cast is 

00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:41.270
 You can use Cast to cast audio and video 

00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:43.540
 You can also develop games that support Google Cast. 

00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:47.860
 So you can build great HTML5 games 

00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:53.480
 Another use case is to extend your app. 

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:56.320
 So that the user experience of your app can be extended to the second screen 

00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:58.430
 Thus achieving a dual screen experience 

00:17:58.430 --> 00:18:04.950
 To use AndroidTV and our Lean back content library 

00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:07.700
 We will ask you to create a directory browser 

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:11.011
 And provide card view 

00:18:11.011 --> 00:18:11.510
 And detailed background playing cards 

00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:14.340
 This way, if the user is watching a show in your app. 

00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:16.710
 Turned off your app 

00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:19.070
 The corresponding program will continue to play in the background. 

00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:22.230
 AndroidTV has a very important function 

00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:25.670
 That's what makes it easy for users to discover your content. 

00:18:25.670 --> 00:18:30.900
 Therefore, we recommend that you make your content and apps available for others to search. 

00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:35.110
 And provide users with in-app search capabilities 

00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:38.520
 this point is very important 

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:40.890
 In addition, you also need to provide us with the right content. 

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:47.690
 Next, I want to give a brief introduction to Android Auto. 

00:18:47.690 --> 00:18:52.560
 Android Auto started slightly slower 

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:57.190
 But we have established a partnership with Volkswagen, SEAT and Skoda. 

00:18:57.190 --> 00:19:00.630
 Audi is also about to become our partner 

00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:06.500
 Some of GM's brands such as Vauxhall Automotive 

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:10.720
 Announced that we will be able to purchase with us in Europe in early 2016. 

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:12.500
 Support for Android Auto's Pioneer self-provisioning upgrade content 

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:15.160
 In other words, users can purchase self-contained upgrade content. 

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:18.370
 In addition, we learned about other manufacturers 

00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:20.350
 We have signed contracts with 28 manufacturers. 

00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:24.830
 Other manufacturers are also about to offer Android Auto services 

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:27.710
 If you are developing a communication or music application 

00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:30.980
 Then you can take this opportunity 

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:35.030
 Take a place in the market 

00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:37.790
 In addition, I want to introduce Cardboard quickly. 

00:19:37.790 --> 00:19:39.890
 In short, its function is 

00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:45.110
 Help developers easily create virtual reality experiences 

00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:48.990
 Users only need to use their mobile apps with the open source toolkit provided. 

00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:53.410
 Can experience many common virtual reality features 

00:19:53.410 --> 00:19:58.920
 Such as lens distortion 

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:01.830
 Correction and head tracking 

00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:06.830
 So this way you can effectively interact with your app. 

00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:13.030
 Expand to different platforms and emerging devices 

00:20:13.030 --> 00:20:16.390
 Finally, I want to give a brief introduction. 

00:20:16.390 --> 00:20:22.170
 How the app interacts with its surroundings 

00:20:22.170 --> 00:20:25.760
 And how users interact with other users around them 

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:30.720
 Let’s take a brief look 

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:32.330
 Nearby Proximity API 

00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:35.850
 This is a new technology that Google recently launched. 

00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:38.980
 simply put 

00:20:38.980 --> 00:20:42.200
 You can use this technology to create a great experience 

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:46.990
 Enable users close to each other to discover each other 

00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:49.830
 Or discover the surrounding beacons 

00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:51.710
 This contains two components 

00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:53.070
 One is the nearby messaging function. 

00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:57.360
 That is, adjacent devices 

00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:58.140
 Easily exchange messages 

00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:02.550
 For example, collaborative editing is like discussing a whiteboard through a conference room. 

00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:05.420
 Or create a group, vote for something 

00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:08.700
 Or disseminate resources 

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:10.700
 Another component is the nearby connection function 

00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:14.460
 Allow devices using the same network to discover each other 

00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:17.570
 For multiplayer games 

00:21:17.570 --> 00:21:20.940
 The best thing about the Nearby Proximity API is 

00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:23.460
 It works on iOS and Android 

00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:28.000
 Can also interact with beacon devices 

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.060
 And your users don’t need to sign in to use the features. 

00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:33.010
 This is also very good 

00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:35.650
 In addition, you only need to focus on research 

00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:37.110
 The actual use case to be implemented 

00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:38.470
 Google will help you get the rest 

00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:42.280
 We can use Bluetooth, WLAN 

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:47.310
 And sounds that can be received through the device but are inaudible to the human ear. 

00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:51.410
 To communicate with other devices 

00:21:51.410 --> 00:21:53.760
 At the moment, we have seen some great 

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:55.090
 Implementation case 

00:21:55.090 --> 00:22:00.635
 For example, E-DJing launched a cool feature 

00:22:00.635 --> 00:22:01.960
 Allow listeners to playlist votes 

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:04.115
 That is, when the DJ releases the playlist 

00:22:04.115 --> 00:22:06.570
 The audience can vote 

00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:08.090
 What song do they want to listen to next? 

00:22:08.090 --> 00:22:12.580
 Pocket Cast allows two or more users 

00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:16.180
 Publish their subscribed podcasts 

00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:19.030
 Then you can pick from it 

00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:21.950
 And subscribe to podcasts that interest you. 

00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:26.970
 And Trello allows users to share 

00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:27.730
 Nearby bulletin board 

00:22:27.730 --> 00:22:31.440
 This way, you can subscribe to the project bulletin board. 

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:35.020
 For example, you can subscribe to the bulletin board for other people in this room. 

00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:38.360
 So you can take advantage of this powerful technology 

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:42.430
 Interact with other users in your app 

00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:45.090
 And enhance your product 

00:22:45.090 --> 00:22:47.580
 Attractive to them 

00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:50.120
 In addition, I still want to talk about beacons. 

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:52.610
 You can play a little imagination 

00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:58.400
 Think of the beacon as a beacon 

00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:00.750
 It can be added at 

00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:02.190
 On a certain location in the room 

00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:08.760
 They can be applications that use beacons 

00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:10.980
 Provide precise geographic location and environmental cues 

00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:15.010
 For example, we can use beacons to indicate a bus stop somewhere. 

00:23:15.010 --> 00:23:17.710
 In this way, your phone will know 

00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:19.110
 To show the time of the next bus arrival 

00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:20.430
 Or prompt you to prepare your ticket 

00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:24.530
 Or, we can also add beacons to museum exhibits. 

00:23:24.530 --> 00:23:26.660
 Thereby providing information about the exhibits 

00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:30.170
 Additional information or background information 

00:23:30.170 --> 00:23:33.570
 Google can help you with this interaction. 

00:23:33.570 --> 00:23:37.260
 All with the help of the Goolgle beacon platform 

00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:41.820
 The platform consists essentially of three parts 

00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:45.010
 The first is low-cost beacon equipment 

00:23:45.010 --> 00:23:50.450
 These devices must comply with our hardware specifications 

00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:56.750
 To ensure that it works with our API 

00:23:56.750 --> 00:24:00.630
 We use Eddystone as our beacon format. 

00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:04.280
 Eddystone is an open source format produced by Google 

00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:07.920
 This format basically defines three payloads 

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:11.700
 You can use the device identifier 

00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:14.220
 Provide contextual information to your app 

00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:16.870
 This will interact with them 

00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:19.920
 So you can use this content to create an interactive experience. 

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:24.630
 Eddystone beacons can broadcast compressed URLs 

00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:28.320
 So you can give users direct access to these URLs 

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:31.940
 That is, you can place deep links in relevant places in your app. 

00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:35.230
 In addition, such beacons also broadcast telemetry data. 

00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:38.310
 So it will show the temperature in the beacon 

00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:41.880
 And related information such as whether the beacon is moving or not. 

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:44.480
 You can build services for this type of event. 

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:48.070
 In addition, we also have the Proximity Beacon API 

00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:52.790
 You can use this API to register a large number of beacons. 

00:24:52.790 --> 00:24:55.240
 And remotely manage beacons 

00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:57.560
 So you don't have to go find your own beacons. 

00:24:57.560 --> 00:24:59.460
 Confirm if they are still working 

00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:00.820
 And is the remaining battery power sufficient? 

00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:06.390
 Finally, I want to bring everyone to look into the future. 

00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:10.240
 What is the future situation? 

00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:11.550
 What is our direction? 

00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:15.570
 That is Brillo and Weave. 

00:25:15.570 --> 00:25:19.510
 We are working hard to make more progress after launching the beacon 

00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:22.450
 And make full use of the Internet of Things 

00:25:22.450 --> 00:25:26.030
 Brillo is actually a networked device 

00:25:26.030 --> 00:25:29.100
 Android platform 

00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:32.382
 In theory, the platform uses our standards so you can easily set up the platform 

00:25:32.382 --> 00:25:34.590
 And devices can communicate as expected 

00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:39.930
 Basically, we can think of Brillo as 

00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:41.300
 Internet of Things operating system 

00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:46.380
 And Weave is the Internet of Things agreement. 

00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:49.630
 It can be between your devices 

00:25:49.630 --> 00:25:50.660
 Provide seamless and secure communication 

00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:54.960
 This communication is not limited to your smartphone and IoT devices. 

00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:58.150
 Can also be done between different devices 

00:25:58.150 --> 00:26:01.580
 In addition, it is also integrated into Google Play. 

00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:04.020
 So from the beginning 

00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:06.800
 Android app developers can go directly 

00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:08.430
 Create great applications based on this system 

00:26:08.430 --> 00:26:12.300
 It ensures that all devices can communicate 

00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:15.740
 We have provided a certification program 

00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:19.540
 To ensure that the equipment meets all standards 

00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:21.100
 This is the end of my speech. 

00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:23.320
 Thank you for your participation. 

00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:27.840
 I hope that everyone knows what I am talking about. 

00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:31.750
 The first is a platform that is now very well functional. 

00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:33.310
 Tailored interaction 

00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:34.660
 This is also the core of your business. 

00:26:34.660 --> 00:26:38.300
 Then, we learned about some emerging platforms like Wear, Smart TV. 

00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:40.770
 Chrome Cast and Cardboard 

00:26:40.770 --> 00:26:42.480
 You must also take these platforms into consideration. 

00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:45.070
 To ensure coverage 

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:46.270
 Important user 

00:26:46.270 --> 00:26:52.370
 In addition, we also mentioned the online world, beacons and the Internet of Things. 

00:26:52.370 --> 00:26:55.154
 Everyone must start thinking hard 

00:26:55.154 --> 00:26:56.570
 How to reach the target user 

00:26:56.570 --> 00:26:59.450
 How to ensure your users 

00:26:59.450 --> 00:27:02.020
 Will continue to use your app 

00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:03.730
 thank you all! 

00:27:03.730 --> 00:27:10.030
 [applause] 

00:27:10.030 --> 00:27:15.480
