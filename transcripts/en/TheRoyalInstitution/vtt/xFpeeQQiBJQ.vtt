00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.110
Mercury.

00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:06.380
It's a really beautiful substance.

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.349
It's the only metal that's a liquid at room
temperature and pressure.

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:14.280
It doesn't become a solid until it goes below
-38 degrees Celsius.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.870
In its liquid state the atoms have enough
thermal energy to overcome the rigid metallic

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:20.870
bonds

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:23.870
that confine most metals to solid structures
at room temperature.

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:31.870
Because of this, the atoms haev enough energy
to jiggle about and flow past one another.

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:34.370
And it's the third law of thermodynamics

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.140
which links the temperature to the level of
entropy in a system.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.660
So, as the temperature of a system reaches
absolute zero,

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.520
the level of entropy reaches its lowest possible
value.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.079
When the mercury atoms in the liquid have
enough thermal energy

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:51.149
they can break free from the surface in the
form of a vapour.

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.190
This vapour has a higher entropy state, meaning
there are more ways in which the atoms can

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.000
arrange themselves in the space around them.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.820
The less energy there is in a substance, the
more ordered the atoms are within it.

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.940
This is why when you cool the liquid it turns
into a solid.

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.030
So if we use liquid nitrogen to take the temperature
of the mercury down below its freezing point

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.190
at -39 degrees,

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.880
we know that we will also be reducing its
entropy.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.960
Which means we'll be able to play around with
it as a solid.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.760
Say mould it into something like....

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.060
a hammer!

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.890
At this point mercury becomes more like many
of the solids you may be familiar with at

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.140
room temperature.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.610
It's much more rigid and less malleable.

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.500
It forms a solid metal in which all the atoms
are ordered in a regular crystalline structure.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.619
Which means the atoms arrange themselves in
a repeating pattern throughout the solid.

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.409
But although the atoms are arranged in this
solid crystalline structure,

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.780
they're not completely motionless.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.210
A more precise phrasing of the third law would
state:

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:03.570
'the entropy of a perfect crystal at absolute
zero is exactly equal to zero.'

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.890
So we'd have to have a perfectly arranged
crystal and remove absolutely all the thermal

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.950
energy to reduce the entropy to zero.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.349
The problem is that the concept of absolute
zero is a theoretical one.

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:22.940
It's just not possible to completely remove
all the thermal energy from within a substance.

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:28.080
So it might seem strange to have absolute
zero in our laws of thermodynamics,

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.720
given that it's a theoretical temperature,

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.090
but it provides us with an absolute scale
with which we can link temperature and entropy.

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:42.920
This in turn allows us to understand how temperature
influences the behaviours of systems and materials

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.470
in the world around us,

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.980
which is pretty important when we study the
climate, or design anything from

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:57.100
spacecraft to microwaves to... mercury hammers.

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.160
(It fell down!)

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.510
(Ooh!)

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.420
(Were we filming?)

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:06.420
(Yeah.

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:07.690
It's like the Terminator...)
