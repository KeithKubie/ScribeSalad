00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
Hi! I’m John Green, this is Crash Course
Literature, and It’s alive!

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.240
Mr. Green? Mr. Green? That’s my favorite
part of the movie…

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.079
No. No. No. No. Me From The Past don’t you
dare. That line is not in the book. And Frankenstein

00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:18.490
is the doctor not the monster. Also, there
is no Igor in the book or in the movie for

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.390
that matter. His name was Fritz. Let’s move
on!

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:30.000
[Theme Music]

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.600
So, way before you actually read Mary Shelley’s
Frankenstein, you probably heard about it...

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.120
I mean the novel is almost 200 years old now, but
we can’t seem to get away from its story and its ideas.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.480
Its been adapted into plays, and books, and
comics, and more than 100 movies — from your

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:50.989
classic Boris Karloff picture to “Blackenstein,”
“Frankenstein Meets the Space Monster,”

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:53.739
“The Erotic Rites of Frankenstein”...

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:59.899
And of course 2013’s “I, Frankenstein”
which has a resounding 4% fresh on RottenTomatoes.com

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:03.639
By the way I wanted to blow Crash Course’s
entire budget on licensing “The Erotic Rites

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.980
of Frankenstein” but Stan said we couldn’t!

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:11.260
Anyway, after all those experiences with he story,
reading the novel is kind of surprising because

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:17.220
it opens not with the story of Victor Frankenstein,
but with a series of letters from an Arctic explorer.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.640
Also, the monster, who as previously noted
is not named Frankenstein, he doesn’t have

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.369
a name that’s really important actually,
but he’s a pretty articulate guy. I mean

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:29.380
he reads “Plutarch’s Lives” and “Paradise
Lost.” He’s better read than most of us.

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.619
So genre wise, Mary Shelley’s “Frankenstein”
is kind of a triple threat. I mean it’s

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:36.760
often recognized as the first work of science
fiction. It’s one of the greatest horror

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.130
novels ever. And it’s often called the greatest
capital “R” Romantic novel.

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.659
I mean like Lord Byron romantic not Danielle
Steele romantic. You know the idea that like

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:49.790
emotions like awe and terror and horror - the
modern emotions - can be the center of an

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:55.780
aesthetic experience. Also, Percy Shelley romantic which reminds me to talk about Mary Shelley’s biography.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.400
Mary Shelley’s father was an anarchist author,
and her mother was Mary Walstonecraft, a famous

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.040
early feminist who died just 11 days after
Mary was born.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.149
Her mother’s death was a huge influence
on Mary Shelley and if you’re into biographical

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.489
readings, then you can look at Frankenstein
as a story of a monstrous and disastrous birth.

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:18.540
Anyway, when Mary was 14, Percy Shelley, one
of the great lyric poets of the age, came

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.600
to visit her father after being thrown out
of Oxford for writing a pamphlet on atheism.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.220
Percy Shelley was already married, but two
years later, when Mary was just 16, they eloped

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.020
to the continent along with Mary Shelley’s stepsister
Claire Clairmont… are these names made up?

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:38.040
By then Mary was already pregnant with their
first child. So, it’s 16 and Pregnant, the

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.680
British Romantic Literature edition.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.320
So a couple of years later... oh it must be time
for the Open Letter 'cause my desk just moved.

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.780
An open letter to Percy Shelley’s heart.
Metaphorically, you were complex.

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.459
I mean after you fell in love with 16 yr old
Mary Shelley you repeatedly threatened to

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:57.129
commit suicide even though you were already
married to a different person named Harriet.

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:01.150
After leaving Harriet for this teenager, Mary,
Harriet would go on to commit suicide while

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.150
pregnant with Percy Shelley’s child.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.500
And another woman who was in love with you, Mary
Shelley’s half-sister Fanny also committed suicide.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.580
But I want to talk about your literal heart
Percy Shelley, because when you drowned in

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.780
a sailing accident, your friends burned your
body and were stunned to see that your heart

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.760
did not burn. Somebody grabbed it from the
fire, it traded hands a few times, it ended

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:27.200
up with Mary. And it was eventually buried with
Mary and Percy’s son 67 years after Percy died.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.440
And some people think the reason the heart
didn’t burn is because Percy Shelley suffered

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.310
from calcification of the heart which turned
his heart almost into a bone-like structure.

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.680
In short, you were literally, hard-hearted.
Best wishes, John Green.

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.230
So a couple years later Mary Shelley, Percy
Shelley, Claire Clairmont, Lord Byron (with

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.750
whom Claire was having an affair -- although
who wasn’t having an affair with Lord Byron),

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.780
and Byron’s doctor were all hanging out
in Geneva.

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.019
And despite all the lakes and chocolate, Geneva
was pretty boring, and also the weather was

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:01.720
unrelentingly terrible so there was nothing to do all day except sit around reading creepy German ghost stories.

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.480
So naturally enough, a novel-writing contest
ensued.

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:08.379
It was basically like the most productive
NaNoWriMo of all time. The doctor wrote a

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:12.470
story that would later be a huge influence
on Bram Stoker’s “Dracula,” and Mary

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.159
Shelley wrote “Frankenstein.”

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:19.719
She was still a teenager. It’s just not
fair! Anyway, in the introduction to the 1831

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:24.349
edition of the novel, Mary Shelley explained,
“How I, then a young girl, came to think

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:29.839
of, and to dilate upon, so very hideous an
idea.” She wanted to write a story that

00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:35.619
would “speak to the mysterious fears of
our nature, and awaken thrilling horror.”

00:04:35.619 --> 00:04:40.419
The idea that art could awaken that horror
and awe and connect us to the broader natural

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.620
world was really key to the romantics.

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.680
But she couldn’t figure out how to turn
ideas into like a plot until she stayed up

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:51.620
late one night listening to Percy Shelley and Byron
discuss new developments in electricity and the

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:58.180
possibility of the dead being brought back to life. That night she went to bed and had a terrible waking dream.

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:03.619
She wrote, “I saw the pale student of unhallowed
arts kneeling beside the thing he had put

00:05:03.619 --> 00:05:09.610
together. I saw the hideous phantasm of a
man stretched out, and then, on the working

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:16.610
of some powerful engine, show signs of life,
and stir with an uneasy, half vital motion.

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:18.480
Frightful must it be.”

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:23.680
Uggh. it’s so creepy. Anyway, that’s Mary
Shelley’s story of the creation of Frankenstein.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:29.229
Let’s talk about now what she created, the
upshot of which is: Don’t re-animate corpses.

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:31.180
Alright, Let’s go to the Thought Bubble

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:35.059
So the novel opens with with the aforementioned
boring letters that arctic explorer Walton

00:05:35.059 --> 00:05:39.169
sends to his sister in England. Walton is
sailing toward the North Pole when he sees

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:41.869
a man cruising by on a dog sled.

00:05:41.869 --> 00:05:46.529
The man is Victor Frankenstein. Once upon
a time, he was a nice Swiss boy with a couple

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:51.129
of younger brothers, a dead mother, a best
friend, and a cute cousin. But then he went

00:05:51.129 --> 00:05:56.159
to university and took organic chemistry and
became obsessed with reanimating the dead

00:05:56.159 --> 00:05:59.860
which is why you should never go to college.
Just kidding, go to college.

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:03.770
So eventually Victor figures out how to make
dead flesh live and he assembles this huge

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:09.610
creature out of dead bodies and farm animal
parts , hooks up the juice, and animates it.

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:15.000
Only he’s so horrified that he runs away and
conveniently develops a bad case of brain fever.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.020
Rejected by his creator, the monster wanders
into the wilderness where he seeks shelter

00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:21.020
and then eventually learns to read and write.

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:24.199
The monster returns to Victor and he’s like
“look I’ve done so much book learning”

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:28.929
but that doesn’t convince Victor that the
monster is not a monster. So the monster becomes

00:06:28.929 --> 00:06:33.559
a real monster. He kills Victor’s youngest
brother and then when Victor rejects the monster’s

00:06:33.559 --> 00:06:39.240
request for a mate, the monster kills Victor’s
best friend and then his cousin -- to whom Victor

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.360
is getting married, because, you know, that’s
what they did back then.

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.080
The creature flees to the Arctic and then
Victor pursues him which is how he ends up

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:49.889
on Walton’s ship where he dies. The creature,
who they’ve found, is so distraught that

00:06:49.889 --> 00:06:54.259
he says he’s going to die too. And then
Walton has to turn the ship around and never

00:06:54.259 --> 00:06:59.189
achieve his sublime goal, and everything’s
terrible. Because this is what happens when

00:06:59.189 --> 00:07:04.409
you major in Organic Chemistry like my brother,
Hank, instead of something healthy and good

00:07:04.409 --> 00:07:06.689
like film or history or literature.

00:07:06.689 --> 00:07:10.800
Thanks Thought Bubble. So Frankenstein is
fundamentally a story about creation, about

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:16.499
new and terrifying ways to bring light and
life into the world. And in that sense, it’s

00:07:16.499 --> 00:07:21.039
loosely tied to two other creation stories,
which Mary Shelley acknowledged in the text.

00:07:21.039 --> 00:07:24.889
The first, is right there in its subtitle,
“The Modern Prometheus,” which is taken

00:07:24.889 --> 00:07:29.169
of course from Greek mythology. Prometheus
is a Titan, he’s best known for giving fire

00:07:29.169 --> 00:07:31.899
to Mankind - an idea that Zeus of course hated.

00:07:31.899 --> 00:07:35.209
I don’t know why Zeus thought we couldn’t
be trusted with fire… come on, Stan, please

00:07:35.209 --> 00:07:36.580
stop having my head blow up.

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:40.439
Anyway, to punish Prometheus, Zeus has him
chained to a rock and he has an eagle show

00:07:40.439 --> 00:07:46.219
up every day to peck out Prometheus’s liver,
which then grows back every night, until Hercules

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:47.930
stages the ultimate prison break.

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:52.840
Read one way, this myth is a cautionary tale.
If you overreach yourself, if you share secret

00:07:52.849 --> 00:07:55.559
knowledge, you’re going to get you liver
pecked out everyday, but that’s not how

00:07:55.559 --> 00:07:59.659
the Romantics read it. To them Prometheus
was a hero. They saw Prometheus as a figure

00:07:59.659 --> 00:08:02.999
who never gives up even when faced with incredible
suffering.

00:08:02.999 --> 00:08:06.819
But “Frankenstein” has a more ambivalent
relationship to the myth. I mean you can definitely

00:08:06.819 --> 00:08:12.039
read the novel as a story about what happens
when humans overstep. After all, that’s

00:08:12.039 --> 00:08:16.819
what Mary Shelley says when she tells the
story of her dream, that Frankenstein’s

00:08:16.819 --> 00:08:19.529
creation would be horrifying because quote

00:08:19.529 --> 00:08:24.580
“supremely frightful would be the effect
of any human endeavour to mock the stupendous

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:28.960
mechanism of the Creator of the world.”
My god, she could write a sentence.

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:32.639
And Victor Frankenstein is certainly punished
for his actions, right, I mean he see’s

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:39.120
the murder of his friends and family and then
he dies a tragic icy death at the ripe old age of 25.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:42.360
Which for the record high school students,
is not old.

00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:47.490
But you can also read “Frankenstein” another
way. As a celebration of ambition and super-human

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:51.800
effort. I mean, why is that whole arctic explorer
frame a thing?

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:56.790
Frankenstein only begins to tell Walton his
story when Walton suggests that he is willing

00:08:56.790 --> 00:09:00.029
to risk his own life and that of his crew
for knowledge.

00:09:00.029 --> 00:09:04.199
So it seems like Victor’s trying to share
his own experience as a cautionary tale.

00:09:04.199 --> 00:09:09.519
But then, at the end, when crew demands that
Walton turn back SO THAT EVERYONE DOESN’T

00:09:09.519 --> 00:09:16.199
DIE, Victor is furious. “Oh! be men, or
be more than men,” he says. “Return as

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:22.500
heroes who have fought and conquered, and who
know not what it is to turn their backs on the foe.”

00:09:22.509 --> 00:09:27.720
But Walton defers to the crew, writing his
sister, “Thus are my hopes blasted by cowardice

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:31.410
and indecision; I come back ignorant and disappointed.”

00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:35.220
So I don’t think the novel is arguing that
like the heroic human life is one that lives

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:37.120
in a quiet bubble of ignorance.

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:41.670
That kind of ambivalence — We shouldn’t
overreach! Wait, except at sometimes maybe

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:46.040
we should! — is typical of the novel and it’s
also typical of Mary Shelley herself. She

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:51.399
once wrote in her journal, “I am not a person of opinions
because I feel the counterarguments too strongly.”

00:09:51.399 --> 00:09:55.870
The other creation myth with which “Frankenstein”
is intertwined is of course the biblical one

00:09:55.870 --> 00:10:02.000
as recounted by John Milton in the very good,
very long “Paradise Lost,” which we aren’t

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.980
reading in Crash Course Literature because
I didn’t wanna.

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:09.000
One thing to pay attention to in books is
what books the characters are reading and

00:10:09.009 --> 00:10:12.780
it’s no coincidence that the monster conveniently
reads “Paradise Lost”.

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:16.400
Plus the novel’s epigraph comes from Milton
in a scene in which Adam says to God:

00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:21.509
"Did I request thee, Maker, from my clay
To mould me Man, did I solicit thee

00:10:21.509 --> 00:10:23.250
From darkness to promote me?"

00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:25.959
It’s essentially the same thing as when
you say to your parents “I didn’t ask

00:10:25.959 --> 00:10:28.490
to be born!” but of course that doesn’t
make as good of an epigraph.

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:33.009
So in this interpretation Victor is playing
God and the creature is the sinning Adam.

00:10:33.009 --> 00:10:37.649
But it’s hardly so simple I mean Victor
refers to the creature as a devil and the

00:10:37.649 --> 00:10:39.620
creature seems to support this at times.

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:43.959
Plus, In the middle of the book they have
this intense argument about moral philosophy—you

00:10:43.959 --> 00:10:48.399
know as you do with monsters, Godzilla was
into Immanuel Kant, King Kong, of course,

00:10:48.399 --> 00:10:53.500
huge fan of Thomas Hobbes - anyway, the monster
says, “I am thy creature; I ought to be

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:59.760
thy Adam; but I am rather the fallen angel,
whom thou drivest from joy for no misdeed.

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:04.900
Everywhere I see bliss, from which I alone
am irrevocably excluded.”

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:11.180
It’s hard out there for a monster and it’s important to remember that God did not expel Satan for no misdeed.

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:15.120
But part of what makes this so rich is that
both “Frankenstein” and “Paradise Lost”

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:20.509
defy easy readings. I mean, “Frankenstein”
allies the creature with Satan but that doesn’t

00:11:20.509 --> 00:11:25.639
mean the creature is all bad. There are readings
of Milton’s poem that perceive God as sort

00:11:25.639 --> 00:11:30.819
of a stick in the mud and Satan as the really
interesting character who struggles undaunted

00:11:30.819 --> 00:11:32.220
despite his exile from heaven.

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:36.120
Anyway, that was the view the Romantics took
and part of why the poet Robert Southey referred

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:41.400
to Byron and Percy Shelley and their circle
as belonging to the Satanic school of Romanticism.

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:45.600
But anyway, all these allusion to Milton bring
up some pretty tough questions: I mean Does

00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:51.649
Victor see himself as God? And if so is he
a good God? Does the monster deserve his exile?

00:11:51.649 --> 00:11:56.660
Is he inherently sinful or is sin something
that God allows to enter, as in Milton’s

00:11:56.660 --> 00:12:00.620
poem? Just as we wonder whether Victor and
Walton should be praised or damned for their

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:03.860
pursuit of knowledge we have to wonder that
about the monster as well.

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:08.509
Whether we’re talking about mad scientists
or the monsters they create or arctic explorers,

00:12:08.509 --> 00:12:14.050
seeking knowledge is a way of becoming human.
Both in the best and worst senses of the word.

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:19.100
And to me the great question of the novel is: Who’s
more human - Victor of the monster he has created?

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:22.230
Next week we’ll continue our discussion
of “Frankenstein” by examining those questions

00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:24.670
through different lenses. Until then thanks
