00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:02.730
I love dogs, I’ve always loved dogs.

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.430
But there’s always the debate... purebred
or mutt?

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:13.809
It’s a great year to be a dog lover!

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:17.570
Apparently 7 new dog breeds will be shown
at the Westminster dog show!

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.000
I don’t know about you, but dog shows…
give me mixed feels.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.901
On a personal level, PUUPPIES, but the science
part of me wants to know, why are there so

00:00:25.901 --> 00:00:28.670
many different dog breeds and is that good
for the species?

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:34.470
I mean domesticated dogs might have been around
for 40,000 years and all pretty much looked

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:35.470
like wolves.

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.280
But the few hundred dog breeds we know and
love today, have only been around for a couple

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.450
of hundred years at the most.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.510
Humans tinkered with dogs, selecting for temperament
or physical traits.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.300
Things like distinguishing markings, the color
of a coat and other physical features like

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.829
head and body shape.

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.780
A new dog breed has to meet very specific
requirements to qualify as an official breed.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.329
Many organizations like the American Kennel
Club demand proof that every dog used to make

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:01.140
the new breed was a certified purebred.

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.842
And in many cases, breeders need to get their
dogs DNA and genotype tested to show a “an

00:01:05.842 --> 00:01:09.420
acceptable DNA variation sample for the breed”.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.359
Since 2003, researchers have been able to
see exactly what that genetic pool looks like

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:18.539
thanks to an effort lead by Ewen Kirkness
at The Institute for Genome Research which

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:20.770
sequenced the dog genome.

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.039
They also studied the genomes of different
breeds.

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:27.340
And not surprisingly they found that the variation
of genes was greater between dogs of different

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.659
breeds than they were within the same breed.

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:34.090
So, a black lab and a golden lab will have
less variation than a black lab and a bulldog.

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:40.200
But what’s interesting is that variation
can be as much as 27.5 percent between dogs

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.340
of different breeds, even though essentially,
they are the same species.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.759
Now compare that to humans who only have a
genetic variation of 5.4 percent.

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:54.369
When humans mess with dog’s shape and coloring,
they are actually messing with their genes.

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.779
Like size is pretty much controlled by one
gene on chromosome 15 called insulin-like

00:01:58.779 --> 00:01:59.779
growth factor-1.

00:01:59.779 --> 00:02:02.669
(IGF1), which is known to influence body size
in humans and mice.

00:02:02.669 --> 00:02:07.979
But it’s mutation can be found in a lot
of unrelated smaller breeds, suggesting it’s

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:08.979
ancient.

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.049
Even though it’s a few thousand years old,
it’s a change that still happened faster

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:14.049
than it would happen naturally.

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:18.700
So all the tinkering humans do to dog breeds,
dramatically changes dog’s genes faster

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.010
than nature would.

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.329
With all that genetic tinkering, some weird
stuff happened.

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:28.290
Not surprisingly, breeding for aesthetic purposes
has some.. unintended consequences.

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.040
Like pug encephalitis and hip problems in
German shepherds.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.750
And one study in PLOS One found that changing
a dog’s face, changes their brains too.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.770
In dogs with short snouts, their brains have
rotated 15 degrees backwards and the smell

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:45.620
region in their brain is in a completely different
place from other breeds.

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.140
And these kinds of brain changes are common
in other dogs too.

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:54.409
Another study also published in PLOS One found
that Chiari malformation in dogs actually

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:56.469
changes their skull and brain formation.

00:02:56.469 --> 00:03:01.269
It’s a physical defect that occurs in a
lot of small dogs that are bred to look more

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:02.269
“doll like”.

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:05.819
It basically makes the forehead bigger but
also changes the brain shape.

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:10.299
It can cause chronic conditions like headaches,
problems with walking or even paralysis.

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:14.709
One of the lead authors of the study Clare
Rusbridge, described the condition “as trying

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.249
to fit a big foot into a small shoe.”

00:03:17.249 --> 00:03:19.640
Which just sounds utterly painful.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.620
The physical defects caused by inbreeding
is a huge problem and it’s one of the reasons

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.390
why some breeders are calling for stricter
regulations and practices.

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.319
Thankfully there are responsible breeders
who are using genetic science to ensure they

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:36.180
are breeding to maintain genetic diversity,
resulting in new breeds that are both healthy

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.180
and happy.

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.560
While we’ve bred dogs to be stronger, smaller,
or even more docile, they all come from a

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.400
wolf like ancestor thousands of years ago.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.249
At some point, dogs evolved to become man’s
best friend?

00:03:47.249 --> 00:03:50.450
When did this take place?

00:03:50.450 --> 00:04:09.749
So what’s your fav dog breed?

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:16.840
Mine’s a mutt.
