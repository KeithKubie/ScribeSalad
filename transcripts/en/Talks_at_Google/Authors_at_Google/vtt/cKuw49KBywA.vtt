&gt;&gt;Karen: Okay, I'm not sure a man who's been
entertaining a group with stories and keeping

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.510
these rapt faces out of their laptop needs
an introduction.

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:18.490
I also don't think the mikes working, so I'm
gonna put it down and just talk.

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:19.490
How about this?

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:20.490
Photo op there we go.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:21.550
&gt;&gt;Sully: Improvise, we can improvise here.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:22.820
&gt;&gt;Karen: This is awesome.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.330
So I'm Karen May for those of you I don't
know.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.970
Oh this is, wow what an introduction.

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.300
I manage our talent team which is leadership
development, learning and development, talent

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.829
management and so forth.

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.670
And so what an honor for me to introduce this
man I'm so close to.

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:48.070
To introduce to you Sully Sullenberger who
you may know as a hero and you may think of

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.839
when you think of the word hero.

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:58.140
But you may also think of as a leader, as
a man who's an expert, who's responsible,

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.850
who's creative and who's able to lead a team
through a significant crisis to a very good

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:05.850
end.

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:06.850
Right?

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.210
Yes, he's standing here, very good end.

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:16.240
But I wanted to highlight three other characteristics,
leadership characteristics that really matter.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.549
The first is he's a curious man.

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:24.960
Even after extraordinary success he stays
curious.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.409
And the second is that he's focused on learning
from others.

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:32.329
Even people who are quite different from him.

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:37.240
And then the third is that he seeks to share
that knowledge, to share what he learns.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.619
And he actually took this book that he wrote,
"Making a Difference", the one he's here to

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:48.570
talk to us about as an opportunity to interview
people, 11 people that he admires.

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.210
Leaders that he admires.

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.899
And to learn from them and then in turn to
share what he learned with the world.

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.850
And he's here today to share that with you,
and what an honor for us.

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:59.850
So thank you.

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:00.850
[Applause]
&gt;&gt;Sully: Thank you, thank you so much.

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.619
&gt;&gt;Karen: I'll just stay here.

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.909
&gt;&gt;Sully: [Laughs]
That was a very nice introduction, thank you

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:09.630
I'll try to live up to it.

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.970
But yeah I have been intellectually curious
my whole life.

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.410
And in the introduction to the second book,
"Making a Difference: stories in vision and

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.110
courage from America's leaders," I talk about
why that's the case or why I think that's

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.610
the case.

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.920
And one of the reasons is that even before
my birth my family valued education.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.080
All four of my grandparents and these are
people who were born in the 1880s and 1890s,

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.570
in the 19th century went to college.

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.680
And that was especially remarkable for women
of that era.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.000
My mother was a first grade teacher in this
small town in Texas where I grew up.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.280
A first grade teacher for 25 years, and so
from her I got wonderful lifelong gifts of

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.070
a love of reading and of learning and those
have served me well throughout my career.

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:59.200
And so I've tried to do what I've encouraged
others to do and that's to continue to invest

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.200
in yourself.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.590
Never stop learning, never stop growing either
professionally or personally throughout your

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:04.590
life.

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:11.010
And I think that's become a necessity now
because with the pace of change only accelerating

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.300
I think most people cannot get through an
entire working lifetime with just one skill

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.300
set.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:21.760
We have to keep learning, have to keep growing
sometimes reinvent ourselves like I did on

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:28.340
January 15, 2009 to learn very quickly a way
of living this entirely new life.

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:33.090
On January 15, 2009 I had never given a public
speech in my life.

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.860
Never wanted to, I was convinced that wouldn't
be good at it.

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.280
I'd never written a book.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.830
I'd been a professional pilot, but I stayed
curious.

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:47.910
And so I approached these new careers, and
I have four of them now to replace the airline

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.140
career I left after 30 years two years ago.

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:57.400
As a speaker, as an author as a consultant
to industry and as a CBS news aviation consultant.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.280
I approach that with the same discipline and
diligence I did in my flying career.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.810
And we seem to have lost the speaker in the
room or is it just been muted?

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.270
&gt;&gt;Male #1: I think it's better without it.

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:10.480
&gt;&gt;Sully: Is it better without it?

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.440
&gt;&gt;Male #2: I think we've got a little bit
of speaker.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:18.070
&gt;&gt;Sully: Okay, I've got just enough that you
can hear me let me know if you can't.

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.269
So why this book and why now?

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.919
I think, like the first book, "Highest Duty,"
my memoir, a lot of this book was already

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:26.240
in me.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.870
That I had lived my life in a way that had
prepared me without knowing it for that event

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.770
and for all this attention as a public figure
and the aftermath.

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:40.069
I'd been thoughtful, I grew up in an environment
in which ideas were important and in which

00:04:40.069 --> 00:04:42.050
education was important.

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.199
And striving for excellence was expected of
me.

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:53.189
And so when I had these amazing opportunities
to travel the world and meet world figures

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:54.639
the last three years.

00:04:54.639 --> 00:05:00.770
And I began to hear these very personal stories,
these moving and inspiring stories sometimes

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.900
funny but all of them really incredible.

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:09.090
About people who have changed the world, who
have changed the lives of others and done

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.280
amazing things, I just had to share them,
I had to put them on a page.

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.780
And so that's why.

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:20.729
And I intentionally chose a very diverse group
of people from a variety of walks of life.

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:25.050
Younger and older, men, women, some well know
some you've never heard of.

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:26.830
But all people that I admire and respect.

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.560
All people who have certain things in common.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:35.919
One of the things they have in common is that
I think they all view the world the same way.

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:38.780
They view the world as an opportunity for
good.

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:43.289
And they're people who are willing to serve
a cause greater than themselves, greater than

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:45.190
their own immediate needs.

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:49.879
They're people who like one of them literally
says, they're able to check their ego at the

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:51.280
door.

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.120
They're able to do things for the right reasons.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.699
And they're able to lead people.

00:05:55.699 --> 00:06:00.219
You know I think people deserve to be led,
that they want to be led.

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:08.710
We may manage things, we may manage money,
but we must lead people, and that requires

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:09.710
human skills.

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:15.050
You know some, especially in really evidence-based
domains and I've done a lot of patient safety

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:22.889
work too, trying to apply what we've learned
over the last century in aviation to medicine.

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:29.680
Some in these evidence-based domains like
medicine think of these human skills as soft

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:35.099
skills as opposed to hard skills or clinical
or technical skills.

00:06:35.099 --> 00:06:38.050
But they're not really soft skills or human
skills.

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:44.689
And even in medicine, even in an evidence
based domain like that these human skills

00:06:44.689 --> 00:06:49.949
have the potential to save more lives than
technical skills do.

00:06:49.949 --> 00:06:57.479
Because much of what we're seeing in medicine
right now is we have like in so many industries

00:06:57.479 --> 00:07:01.229
islands of excellence in a sea of systemic
failures.

00:07:01.229 --> 00:07:06.669
We have some areas that are doing very well,
some that are very safe and some that are

00:07:06.669 --> 00:07:08.580
not.

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:11.740
And so I think these human skills are very
important.

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:20.240
And now when we as a society are facing huge
and intractable and ambiguous and complicated

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:27.309
problems that are going to require generations
to solve, we need people now more than ever

00:07:27.309 --> 00:07:30.879
who can feel a sense of civic duty.

00:07:30.879 --> 00:07:34.330
Who can be willing to share sacrifices.

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:40.129
Who can give us a vision of a possible future
and help us to get there.

00:07:40.129 --> 00:07:46.159
And be as Jennifer Granholm says, a former
Michigan Governor who I profile in the book,

00:07:46.159 --> 00:07:52.719
"Who can be more pragmatic and less dogmatic?"

00:07:52.719 --> 00:07:58.139
So with that in mind, I can, I'll tell you
a few stories about some of the people in

00:07:58.139 --> 00:08:00.500
my profile and why I chose them.

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:06.099
And then I'd like to open it up into a wide
ranging discussion about what these people

00:08:06.099 --> 00:08:13.289
mean, what they've done and what we can learn
from them and take away as everyday things

00:08:13.289 --> 00:08:14.789
we can use in our lives.

00:08:14.789 --> 00:08:19.180
And one of the things I wanted to do in this
book is to make it accessible.

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:26.529
There are shelves full of leadership books,
but many of them are written by or for CEOs

00:08:26.529 --> 00:08:28.460
or salespeople.

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:30.069
But this book is for everybody.

00:08:30.069 --> 00:08:36.320
Whether you have a big job or a fancy title
or not.

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:40.060
Everybody can learn to be a leader and everybody
can learn to be a better leader than they

00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:42.870
are currently.

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:47.820
The very first profile I do is as Admiral
Thad Allen.

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:52.780
You may know the name, he's a recently retired
coastguard commandant.

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:55.640
Just about a contemporary of mine, maybe a
year to two older.

00:08:55.640 --> 00:09:01.890
He spent his whole life serving others, saving
lives.

00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:07.120
And he was the one brought in in the darkest
hours of the federal response to Hurricane

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:10.360
Katrina to turn it around.

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:14.480
It was in chaos, it was uncoordinated.

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:18.150
The rescue workers were being beaten up in
the press on a daily basis.

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:20.510
They were completely demoralized.

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:26.340
And so when he finally got to New Orleans
he turned to his military aid who happened

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:29.890
to be interestingly enough named Katrina.

00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:34.001
[Laughter]
And she said, "Well Admiral, now that we're

00:09:34.001 --> 00:09:35.920
here what are you going to do?"

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:39.150
And he said, "I'm gonna do the first thing
that any new commander does, I'm gonna call

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:40.150
an all hands meeting."

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:45.630
And she said, "Admiral there are 4000 people
in this building."

00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:49.510
And he said, "I want to gather as many of
them in one place as you can and I want to

00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:51.390
talk to them right now."

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:55.850
And so on the first floor of this large building
they gathered 2500 people.

00:09:55.850 --> 00:10:03.000
And as he entered the area, he saw faces almost
hanging on the floor.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:10.100
And so he stood up on a desk, he grabbed a
microphone and then with a very simple message

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:14.840
in just a few words he said, "I want you to
listen to me I'm going I'm going to give you

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:17.510
a direct order.

00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:24.760
I want you to treat everyone you encounter
as if they were a member your immediate family.

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:29.920
As if they were your father, your mother,
your brother, your sister.

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:33.370
And if you do that two things are going to
happen.

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:38.290
First if you make a mistake you're going err
on the side of doing too much not too little.

00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:42.940
And second if anyone has a problem with what
you've done, then their problem is with me

00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:43.940
and not with you."

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:50.990
And he said you could hear a huge collective
sigh of relief people actually began to weep

00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:56.340
because nobody before that had told them that
what they were doing was important or why

00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:58.060
or that their boss was behind them.

00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:00.150
And in just a few words he had done that.

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:07.760
For a very graphic exercise of leadership
by his personal example.

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:12.160
And he did the same thing again with the BP
oil spill in the Gulf and with the response

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.360
to the earthquake in Haiti in 2010.

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:17.330
And that's just one story, one profile and
the first chapter of the book.

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:21.440
And there are so many that are like that.

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:25.530
Robert Reich was here I know and spoke to
you last August.

00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:28.200
I had an extended conversation with him.

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.090
I've admired him for many years.

00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:36.050
And my conversation with him in his office
over at Berkeley was by far the most intellectually

00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:37.410
stimulating of them all.

00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:40.400
It was almost a Socratic dialogue.

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.730
And we talked about many things.

00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:45.760
He talked about where he got his inspiration.

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:52.000
He's a little bit older than I and in the
early 1960s during the civil rights movement

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.030
one of his close friends, a mentor, a man
a little bit older than he is Mickey Schwerner

00:11:57.030 --> 00:12:04.210
who you may remember was murdered along with
two other civil rights workers in Mississippi

00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:08.840
that led to the story and movie "Mississippi
Burning".

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:15.170
And when Robert, when Bob learned about this
man's death it shocked him to the core.

00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:20.920
That such evil could exist in our country,
in this time.

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:30.230
And he made a promise to himself that he would
do what he had the inclination to do and what

00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:35.710
he said was an assumption that he would do,
he would assume that he would spend his life

00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:38.780
in what he calls public service.

00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:41.100
Now that sounds like an archaic term doesn't
it?

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:42.620
It's not one commonly hears these days.

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:47.850
But this is literally what he means is that
he intended to spend his life serving the

00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:48.850
public.

00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:52.740
And it wasn't that he was going to go into
politics or become a politician or to work

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:59.610
in government, his goal was to be a public
servant which is what he did.

00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:04.380
He relates to me another example of his personal
leadership.

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:08.590
When he first got to the Labor Department
as the new labor secretary under President

00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:12.730
Clinton, he had a meeting with his staff.

00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:14.970
And he opened it up to questions.

00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:17.780
A large group of employees in the Labor Department.

00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:21.300
And someone asked him, "Mr. Secretary, why
do we still have time cards?

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:23.720
Why do we have to mess with that?

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:25.200
What's purpose of that?"

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:30.970
And so he canvassed his lieutenants and they
decided that there really wasn't a purpose

00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:32.750
to the time cards.

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:36.630
And so he said, "Okay starting next week no
more time cards."

00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:38.160
And people were stunned.

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:44.510
But then more suggestions came, and people
became more engaged and had other ways to

00:13:44.510 --> 00:13:48.120
make things better and more productive and
more useful.

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:53.940
And one of the best ideas that came out of
this meeting was to as changes to the economy

00:13:53.940 --> 00:14:00.350
took place to try to very quickly identify
which jobs were likely to go away and never

00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:01.370
come back.

00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:09.750
And which jobs in which someone could be quickly
retrained to do something else similar.

00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:14.190
And then to redeploy the forces and the resources
to do the most good.

00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:18.330
So in a sense doing triage.

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:22.900
One name that you haven't heard is Sue Sheridan.

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:26.970
And through my patient safety work I became
familiar with her story through a physician

00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:28.300
friend of mine.

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:32.410
Sue Sheridan is a mother of two from Boise
Idaho.

00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:40.470
And the reason I profile her is because her
family endured two awful and preventable medical

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:42.400
tragedies.

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:48.870
First her son Cal when he was born as many
babies do became jaundiced.

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:55.850
He wasn't diagnosed, he wasn't tested, he
wasn't treated in time and he suffered brain

00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:56.850
damage.

00:14:56.850 --> 00:15:02.400
He has cerebral palsy and he requires special
care the rest of his life.

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:11.930
And not long after that, her husband Pat had
a tumor that they were initially told was

00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:13.230
benign.

00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:17.850
He had surgery to remove as much of it as
could be done.

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:26.370
And then when the tumor recurred the surgeons
at that time wondered why he wasn't treated

00:15:26.370 --> 00:15:29.170
for cancer earlier at the time of his first
surgery.

00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:34.170
They kept saying, "Well because we were told
it was benign."

00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:39.240
And after about the third of fourth Doctor
or pathologist asked her the same question,

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:41.680
why wasn't he treated earlier for cancer?

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:46.360
She went down to the records room and checked
out his records herself and saw on the original

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:50.570
pathology report malignant sarcoma.

00:15:50.570 --> 00:15:58.450
And so again a systemic breakdown in communication
led to a fatality.

00:15:58.450 --> 00:16:07.470
And as he was dying he made her promise to
go kick some ass, to save others from that

00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:10.800
fate, and to change the world.

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:16.700
And so rather than devolve into bitterness,
anger and despair as many would feel every

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:21.010
right to do she educated herself.

00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:23.720
She gained allies.

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:28.850
She took on the often imperious medical establishment
as a mom.

00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:35.050
And she single-handedly managed to change
the care that we give newborns globally.

00:16:35.050 --> 00:16:40.620
And she now has a new job that I helped her
get as a patient safety advocate as part of

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:44.210
the World Health Organization.

00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:50.810
It's amazing what people can do when they
choose to.

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:57.320
So that's why I wrote the book and for me
that's what it's about.

00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:00.600
It's that each of us can choose to do these
things.

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:06.169
Each of us can learn to be more fulfilled
at work to be better leaders at home, at school

00:17:06.169 --> 00:17:08.040
or at work.

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:12.089
But let's take your questions.

00:17:12.089 --> 00:17:17.149
We have some mikes that we'll pass through
the room and if we all can't hear you clearly

00:17:17.149 --> 00:17:23.300
that I'll repeat the question.

00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:25.720
Right over here, yes sir.

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:27.809
I remember seeing you before, good to see
you again.

00:17:27.809 --> 00:17:29.399
&gt;&gt;Male #3: Whoops, I am on.

00:17:29.399 --> 00:17:33.200
Good to see you again, thanks for coming.

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:39.049
In terms of making a difference, you went
from being an airline pilot getting being

00:17:39.049 --> 00:17:44.700
ready to retire to becoming an advocate for
aviation safety.

00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:50.150
I'm wondering, you see you've been making
good use of this, the bully pulpit.

00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:54.740
[Microphone Feedback] these are things that
we are seeing wrong with the way that airlines

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:58.940
are regulated, the ways that pilots and flight
crews are being compensated, recognized.

00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:10.529
Are you starting to see any progress, any
response from policymakers and from the airlines

00:18:10.529 --> 00:18:11.980
to that work?

00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:12.980
&gt;&gt;Sully: Some.

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:21.549
The answer in order is yes from some of the
policymakers and pretty much no from the industry.

00:18:21.549 --> 00:18:26.330
We have in this country a formal lessons learned
process through the National Transportation

00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:27.330
Safety Board.

00:18:27.330 --> 00:18:31.720
An independent federal agency that investigates
major transportation accidents, not just airlines

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:35.389
but rail, pipeline, highway and others.

00:18:35.389 --> 00:18:41.450
As a result of the final report on flight
1549 the final report was issued just about

00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:43.900
two years ago.

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:51.091
Some two dozen recommendations were made to
make the system safer, to make this kind of

00:18:51.091 --> 00:18:53.409
an accident less likely to happen in the future.

00:18:53.409 --> 00:18:56.570
And let me ask you what you think the result
has been.

00:18:56.570 --> 00:19:02.179
Of those two dozen recommendations made by
this independent agency that's charged with

00:19:02.179 --> 00:19:06.130
making the recommendations but cannot themselves
implement them.

00:19:06.130 --> 00:19:10.970
It's a province of our regulatory agency the
FAA to change the rules and the airlines to

00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:12.070
adopt them.

00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:15.669
Of the two dozen, how many do you think have
been implemented thus far?

00:19:15.669 --> 00:19:17.919
How many think that half have been raise your
hand?

00:19:17.919 --> 00:19:22.049
How many think five have been?

00:19:22.049 --> 00:19:25.320
Gosh you guys are a cynical bunch.

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:30.309
[Laughter]
How many of you think two have been?

00:19:30.309 --> 00:19:32.470
And how many think one has been?

00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:36.340
Does anybody think none has been?

00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:37.549
You're right.

00:19:37.549 --> 00:19:41.649
[Laughter]
You're right thus far none of the recommendations

00:19:41.649 --> 00:19:44.559
has been implemented.

00:19:44.559 --> 00:19:54.049
And so to get back to your question right
now aviation is ultra-safe but if we're going

00:19:54.049 --> 00:19:59.049
to keep it at that level and make it better
which is what we should be doing because our

00:19:59.049 --> 00:20:01.330
passengers deserve and expect it.

00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:05.869
We got to do more work than we're doing right
now.

00:20:05.869 --> 00:20:10.690
Unfortunately just a month after our flight
in February 2009 in Buffalo New York there

00:20:10.690 --> 00:20:12.419
was a crash that claimed 50 lives.

00:20:12.419 --> 00:20:14.350
The Continental Connection Culkin air 3407.

00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:20.009
49 on the airplane and one person on the ground
whose house the crash hit.

00:20:20.009 --> 00:20:26.029
The families of the victims of the Culkin
air crash have been ardent and tireless advocates

00:20:26.029 --> 00:20:27.190
of safety.

00:20:27.190 --> 00:20:32.809
And they've been very active lobbying legislators
on capital here.

00:20:32.809 --> 00:20:34.830
They've been lobbying the airline industry.

00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:38.669
And it's largely through their efforts with
some help from me and my first officer on

00:20:38.669 --> 00:20:43.690
my flight Jeff Skiles that we got through
the Congress two bills that passed in the

00:20:43.690 --> 00:20:51.129
fall of 2009 and the summer of 2010 that have
required greater experience for pilots especially

00:20:51.129 --> 00:20:56.119
young pilots in the regional airlines from
the unbelievable low minimum level now of

00:20:56.119 --> 00:20:58.830
250 hours to be an airline pilot.

00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:03.740
It's laughably small to at least 1500 hrs.

00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:07.279
And also to improve the rules that prevent
pilot fatigue.

00:21:07.279 --> 00:21:11.460
But you know what, the airline industry and
their lobbyists are fighting as hard as they

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:14.120
can tooth and nail.

00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:20.070
They're spending millions of dollars to fight
this, to weaken it, to delay it, to kill it.

00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:22.940
I've had them personally call me a liar.

00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:29.899
I've had them fight in every way that they
can to say that this isn't necessary, that

00:21:29.899 --> 00:21:33.090
we really, it's okay the way it is.

00:21:33.090 --> 00:21:34.090
It's good enough.

00:21:34.090 --> 00:21:36.389
And of course it isn't.

00:21:36.389 --> 00:21:42.909
So were fighting entrenched interests who
have a big financial stake in the status quo.

00:21:42.909 --> 00:21:45.490
And I don't see that happening anytime soon.

00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:51.080
And unfortunately in our society like every
other it almost takes a crisis to focus the

00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:53.990
public attention and political will to get
these things done.

00:21:53.990 --> 00:22:01.289
And as we recede in time from these events
and we get back to business as normal and

00:22:01.289 --> 00:22:06.960
those that we're opposing can say, "Well we
haven't killed anybody lately so were doing

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:09.159
everything okay."

00:22:09.159 --> 00:22:12.850
And were saying, "You can't define safety
only that way, you have to look proactively

00:22:12.850 --> 00:22:14.669
at the risks and vindicate them."

00:22:14.669 --> 00:22:16.850
It's gonna be an ongoing battle.

00:22:16.850 --> 00:22:17.850
Yes sir.

00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:23.799
&gt;&gt;Male #4: It seems to me like him NTSB is
unusually competent and effective if underpowered

00:22:23.799 --> 00:22:29.980
whereas the FAA suffers from regulatory capture
and terrible inertia and bureaucracy.

00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:34.210
You can be forgiven if you want to punt on
this question because it's political.

00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:41.720
Why do you think that the in NTSB has that
spark whereas the FAA is like many other regulatory

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:42.799
agency's not.

00:22:42.799 --> 00:22:45.999
&gt;&gt;Sully: I think it's twofold.

00:22:45.999 --> 00:22:48.769
First the NTSB is an independent agency.

00:22:48.769 --> 00:22:54.289
It's somewhat more insulated from the political
process although not completely by any means.

00:22:54.289 --> 00:23:00.720
And also just a practical matter the rulemaking
agency the FAA is the one that's going to

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:03.259
impose costs on the operators.

00:23:03.259 --> 00:23:06.990
It's the one that's going to make the rules
that determine how much it costs them to operate

00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:09.080
in accordance with the new standards.

00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:13.890
How inconvenient it is for them, and of course
they and their lobbyists are fighting anything

00:23:13.890 --> 00:23:18.860
that's deemed to be either the least bit more
costly or the least but more inconvenient

00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:19.940
for them.

00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:23.580
And that they view as a regulatory burden
quite frankly.

00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:30.909
And so I think it's just a matter of practicality,
it's the rulemaking process where the differences

00:23:30.909 --> 00:23:31.909
are made.

00:23:31.909 --> 00:23:34.070
And that's where the cost are gonna be felt.

00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:40.629
So I think it's not just the FAA, I think
that many of the federal agencies have that

00:23:40.629 --> 00:23:41.629
problem.

00:23:41.629 --> 00:23:46.409
And I think it's, whether it's in the financial
world where we're seeing these kinds of things

00:23:46.409 --> 00:23:49.230
happening are on Capitol Hill.

00:23:49.230 --> 00:23:53.529
The influence of money is too great in our
society and I'm not going to punt on a political

00:23:53.529 --> 00:23:58.360
question even though this is not a really
political book I don't shy away from answering

00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:02.179
or addressing an important questions that
people care about that affect our lives.

00:24:02.179 --> 00:24:06.720
And the influence of money is too great in
our entire political system.

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:11.759
And it's even worse now after that wrongheaded
Supreme Court decision in Citizens United

00:24:11.759 --> 00:24:17.799
that gives corporations the ability to donate
to unlimited sums, and super pacs.

00:24:17.799 --> 00:24:22.499
And it disenfranchises the rest of us because
the lobbyists can get the rules written in

00:24:22.499 --> 00:24:23.499
their favor.

00:24:23.499 --> 00:24:28.100
And it's not in the favor of the traveling
public, it's not the favor of the average

00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:31.590
Americans it's in favor of specific industries
or specific companies.

00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:36.649
&gt;&gt;Male #4: On a more hopeful note, do you
know of any recipes to have more agencies

00:24:36.649 --> 00:24:44.179
like the NTSB that could perhaps help to regulate
the financial industry and some of the other

00:24:44.179 --> 00:24:46.499
risk areas where it wouldn't suffer from the
same political shenanigans?

00:24:46.499 --> 00:24:49.179
&gt;&gt;Sully: I think having longer terms would
help.

00:24:49.179 --> 00:24:55.739
And having appointees that are more based
on competence and not political affiliation.

00:24:55.739 --> 00:25:03.649
Again I get back to my response to when people
have on occasion asked me my political affiliation.

00:25:03.649 --> 00:25:07.970
And I anticipated very early on, I mean three
years plus that that question would eventually

00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:08.970
he asked.

00:25:08.970 --> 00:25:14.100
I've been shocked and surprised that it's
only been asked twice in 3 1/2 years.

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:18.580
But I had a ready answer and it's not a flippant
one it's a real answer.

00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:24.239
When people ask me if I'm a Republican or
a Democrat I say I'm an American, and I think

00:25:24.239 --> 00:25:31.549
as an American and I vote as an American and
I wish more of us did that.

00:25:31.549 --> 00:25:32.769
Yes ma'am back here in the back.

00:25:32.769 --> 00:25:33.769
&gt;&gt;Female #1: Yes hi.

00:25:33.769 --> 00:25:34.840
&gt;&gt;Female #2: Wait wait wait.

00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:36.360
I'm sorry, do we have somebody else first?

00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:37.360
Should I wait for the mike?

00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:40.549
&gt;&gt;Female #3: Thank you so much for coming
to speak with us.

00:25:40.549 --> 00:25:46.240
My question for you is about how we can teach
the next generation of leadership.

00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:51.549
You mention in your book that leadership is
accessible, it's for all of us.

00:25:51.549 --> 00:25:54.590
I'm sure that's true for the younger generation.

00:25:54.590 --> 00:26:01.039
But you talk about your daughters, and I'm
just curious if you could share with us how

00:26:01.039 --> 00:26:04.070
we can teach leadership to that next generation.

00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:08.539
&gt;&gt;Sully: Through your own personal example,
by modeling the behavior you want to see in

00:26:08.539 --> 00:26:09.539
them.

00:26:09.539 --> 00:26:15.150
They are not going to listen to what you say
as much as what they'll watch what you do.

00:26:15.150 --> 00:26:18.419
And our daughters and are 19 and 17.

00:26:18.419 --> 00:26:24.919
And my wife is a wonderful partner and a wonderful
mom and I think part of the reason that they

00:26:24.919 --> 00:26:28.850
turned out the way they are is it's in their
DNA.

00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:33.929
And my daughters are adopted, so they're not
biologically related to us directly.

00:26:33.929 --> 00:26:39.080
But part of who they are is our DNA, but that's
only a part of it.

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:45.460
My wife has done a great job of being there
for them, mentoring them.

00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:49.679
We read to them from a very early age and
cuddled with them even before they could even

00:26:49.679 --> 00:26:50.769
understand the words.

00:26:50.769 --> 00:26:56.809
And it was really fun to see them then try
to "read" even before they could to their

00:26:56.809 --> 00:26:58.549
stuffed animals or to their dolls.

00:26:58.549 --> 00:27:04.009
Or the older one to the younger one, mimicking
what we had done with them.

00:27:04.009 --> 00:27:10.700
So I would say just act around them the way
you want them to act in every way.

00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:17.499
The words you choose, the way you treat shopkeepers
or people you pass on the highway.

00:27:17.499 --> 00:27:19.350
Whatever it is, they will notice what you've
done.

00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:23.980
It's one of the things I say in the book about
my time as a captain, and practicing for 22

00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:27.789
years of a captain out of my 30 years as an
airline pilot.

00:27:27.789 --> 00:27:30.929
Meeting a new group of people, a new crew
every week and trying to quickly take this

00:27:30.929 --> 00:27:34.889
collection of individuals, some of whom may
not even know each other and form a team.

00:27:34.889 --> 00:27:38.990
So if something bad happens on the first takeoff
we can work together effectively and solve

00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:40.289
the problem.

00:27:40.289 --> 00:27:47.299
And I say in the book that few interactions
with others went unnoticed or were completely

00:27:47.299 --> 00:27:48.330
without consequence.

00:27:48.330 --> 00:27:55.200
People notice those things, or as I say about
my friend Chris who died of cancer three years

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:56.200
ago.

00:27:56.200 --> 00:28:01.340
And I spoke at his memorial service, Chris
was able to live his life in such a way that

00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:02.859
his values were apparent.

00:28:02.859 --> 00:28:06.330
He didn't have to tell you what he believed,
you could see in his actions and in his attitudes

00:28:06.330 --> 00:28:07.330
what he believed.

00:28:07.330 --> 00:28:09.720
That would be it I think.

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:10.809
Yes over there.

00:28:10.809 --> 00:28:23.100
&gt;&gt;Male #5: You mentioned the people you interviewed
for this book are people that made you feel

00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:24.100
inspired.

00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:37.549
If one day I would write a book like this,
you would be one of those people for me.

00:28:37.549 --> 00:28:38.999
[mike feedback].

00:28:38.999 --> 00:28:41.159
&gt;&gt;Sully: Thank you.

00:28:41.159 --> 00:28:50.480
&gt;&gt;Male #5: My question is there any additional
stories that you wanted to put into the book

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:51.480
but weren't able to?

00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:52.480
&gt;&gt;Sully: Oh gosh that's a great question.

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:56.350
Fortunately just about everybody I asked to
interview said yes.

00:28:56.350 --> 00:29:00.630
They were very anxious to be a part of this
progress, process which was wonderful.

00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:08.090
Are there stories that I would like to have
included that I didn't have time to?

00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:11.059
Yes absolutely, there was one I touch on briefly.

00:29:11.059 --> 00:29:17.220
One of the people I really wanted to interview
and wasn't able to make our schedules mesh

00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:23.220
was now the Secretary of Veterans Affairs,
the former four-star Army general Chief of

00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:27.019
Staff of the Army Eric Shinseki.

00:29:27.019 --> 00:29:32.789
He as a young infantry officer in Vietnam,
badly wounded, lost part of one foot.

00:29:32.789 --> 00:29:36.519
Served with distinction throughout his entire
career, rose to the highest rank in the Army

00:29:36.519 --> 00:29:42.039
and is now as Veterans Affairs secretary trying
to do his very best to give the best care

00:29:42.039 --> 00:29:44.600
for our veterans that we can.

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:49.230
One thing in particular that really caught
my attention about him in terms of his personal

00:29:49.230 --> 00:29:51.919
moral courage.

00:29:51.919 --> 00:29:57.309
Early in 2003 before the March invasion of
Iraq he was asked to testify before Congress

00:29:57.309 --> 00:30:03.510
about the numbers of ground troops that would
be required to control, to pacify the country

00:30:03.510 --> 00:30:05.779
after the invasion phase was over.

00:30:05.779 --> 00:30:11.980
And he testified truthfully, or rightly about
the fact that several hundred thousand would

00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:17.190
be required which was a much larger number
than then secretary of defense Donald Rumsfeld

00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:21.110
was publicly stating along with the rest of
the administration.

00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:27.100
And he paid a political and professional price
for that and ended up retiring and leaving

00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:29.559
and not being able to continue.

00:30:29.559 --> 00:30:36.700
And I think that was just a perfect example
of the kind of moral courage I'm talking about,

00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:38.609
that I admire in many of these people.

00:30:38.609 --> 00:30:42.309
I would like to have told more of his story
and meet him personally and I wasn't able

00:30:42.309 --> 00:30:56.289
to make our schedules work.

00:30:56.289 --> 00:31:21.909
&gt;&gt;Female #4: A question about when you actually
landed the plane.

00:31:21.909 --> 00:31:22.909
I imagine there may have been times when,
I think you said it was very grueling following

00:31:22.909 --> 00:31:23.909
the established processes [Inaudible].

00:31:23.909 --> 00:31:24.909
But I wonder did you also have to break rules
and processes and potentially handle conflict,

00:31:24.909 --> 00:31:25.909
perhaps with your [Inaudible] about what to
do?

00:31:25.909 --> 00:31:26.909
Was there conflict with the rules and processes
[Inaudible] and how did you make the choices

00:31:26.909 --> 00:31:27.909
that you made?

00:31:27.909 --> 00:31:28.909
&gt;&gt;Sully: That's a great question, it's a big
question and I'll try to distill it down to

00:31:28.909 --> 00:31:29.909
its essential elements.

00:31:29.909 --> 00:31:34.929
What happened to us on January 15th 2009 on
flight 1549 was extraordinary.

00:31:34.929 --> 00:31:40.850
It was very rare statistically to have an
airliner hit either so many birds or such

00:31:40.850 --> 00:31:45.059
large birds that it basically disabled it
and damaged the engines.

00:31:45.059 --> 00:31:46.390
It turns out irreparably.

00:31:46.390 --> 00:31:54.369
Then leading to an engine out emergency landing
in water just 208 seconds after we had left,

00:31:54.369 --> 00:31:56.720
just under 3 1/2 minutes.

00:31:56.720 --> 00:32:00.230
So that was something, it was a novel and
unanticipated event for which we had never

00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:02.139
specifically trained.

00:32:02.139 --> 00:32:05.470
So it was very much outside the box.

00:32:05.470 --> 00:32:09.379
And there wasn't an exact protocol to follow
in that case.

00:32:09.379 --> 00:32:16.659
And so yes it required a great deal of improvisation,
it required a great deal of deciding that

00:32:16.659 --> 00:32:23.169
many of the things that we're taught to do
in less dire situations weren't really appropriate

00:32:23.169 --> 00:32:24.830
in that situation.

00:32:24.830 --> 00:32:28.850
I'll try to go through a few of them really
quickly.

00:32:28.850 --> 00:32:34.619
The fact that this happened so soon, just
100 seconds after takeoff at such a low altitude,

00:32:34.619 --> 00:32:40.590
about 2700 feet with so few options over one
of the most densely developed populated areas

00:32:40.590 --> 00:32:47.889
of the planet, Manhattan meant that we had
to act very quickly, very decisively to make

00:32:47.889 --> 00:32:54.070
tough choices, to get them right immediately
based upon imperfect and ambiguous information.

00:32:54.070 --> 00:32:59.751
The big advantage that we had was that unlike
some other situations, unlike Air France 447

00:32:59.751 --> 00:33:06.340
for example where there was some ambiguity
about exactly what was going on, we knew clearly

00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:12.229
exactly what happened, exactly why and what
that entailed for us.

00:33:12.229 --> 00:33:17.480
There was no doubt about what had happened,
so that part of the situation was actually

00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:21.389
very clear and relatively easy.

00:33:21.389 --> 00:33:29.779
The difficult part was that the stress levels
were so high that they were marginally debilitating.

00:33:29.779 --> 00:33:34.700
It didn't leave me with the ability to do
the math on the altitude and distance quite

00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:35.700
frankly.

00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:44.879
So what I did was I relied upon my experience
of having flown thousands of flights, 20,000

00:33:44.879 --> 00:33:45.879
hours.

00:33:45.879 --> 00:33:51.429
And I was able to look out the window over
my shoulder, look at the nearer runways and

00:33:51.429 --> 00:33:54.450
say, "No."

00:33:54.450 --> 00:33:56.350
And be right.

00:33:56.350 --> 00:34:03.169
Very quickly under those conditions was remarkable
because the NTSB as is their charter spent

00:34:03.169 --> 00:34:08.659
a year and a half thoroughly investigating
every aspect of this including computer simulations

00:34:08.659 --> 00:34:12.000
to determine if theoretically we had enough
energy, we had enough altitude speed.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:16.400
You know the one half MB squared part of it,
the kinetic energy to make it to a runway,

00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:18.379
taking into account human reaction time.

00:34:18.379 --> 00:34:23.200
It turns out we did not by a little bit.

00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:30.040
And after, remember when you were a kid and
they would say don't get into trouble a we'll

00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:31.319
put it on your permanent record?

00:34:31.319 --> 00:34:36.809
Well if there is such a thing it's probably
having an in NTSB report written about you.

00:34:36.809 --> 00:34:46.210
Where they literally scrutinize for a year
and a half every thought that we had, every

00:34:46.210 --> 00:34:52.389
syllable we uttered, every choice we made,
every action that we took.

00:34:52.389 --> 00:34:57.129
And to have us be vindicated after that process,
I was very happy with it.

00:34:57.129 --> 00:35:04.690
One of the other things that we did that's
not typical is in a less dire emergency it's

00:35:04.690 --> 00:35:10.960
thought best based upon the data we've had,
the studies that have been done for the captain

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:16.299
not to fly the airplane but to be the decision-maker
and take in the whole situation, be aware

00:35:16.299 --> 00:35:19.339
of all the predictable parameters.

00:35:19.339 --> 00:35:24.349
To make a choice announce it and begin directing
the first officer to take certain actions,

00:35:24.349 --> 00:35:26.109
there wasn't time for that.

00:35:26.109 --> 00:35:30.100
The work load was so intense, the time pressure
so extreme that Jeff Stiles my first officer

00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:33.559
and I never had time to even discuss the situation.

00:35:33.559 --> 00:35:38.480
We had simply to act, and so it was best that
I fly rather than try to direct him because

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:41.049
there wasn't time.

00:35:41.049 --> 00:35:44.819
And so I called for the checklist, I began
making a left turn sort of taking actions

00:35:44.819 --> 00:35:49.730
by memory because there wasn't time to again
one of the other protocols we deviated from

00:35:49.730 --> 00:35:55.660
was rather than wait until a minute plus later
over a third of the way through remaining

00:35:55.660 --> 00:35:59.930
flight time when we finally got to this part
of the checklist where we first would start

00:35:59.930 --> 00:36:04.920
taking remedial actions like turning on the
engine ignition, starting the auxiliary power

00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:09.829
unit to provide a backup source of electrical
generation, I took them in the first 2 seconds

00:36:09.829 --> 00:36:11.570
by memory.

00:36:11.570 --> 00:36:14.369
But there were several ways that we deviated
from the normal course of things just due

00:36:14.369 --> 00:36:16.289
to the exigencies.

00:36:16.289 --> 00:36:21.980
And that was critical, had I not done so we
couldn't have had as good an outcome.

00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:28.930
So this whole thing was one series of improvisations
after another but done based upon 42 years

00:36:28.930 --> 00:36:33.859
of flying, 20,000 hours in the air and having
a clear understanding of the end state I was

00:36:33.859 --> 00:36:35.790
going to achieve.

00:36:35.790 --> 00:36:39.920
And knowing which options were possible and
which ones were not by looking out the window

00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:40.920
and being right.

00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:41.920
So that's what we did.

00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:44.910
There was a question up here that we have
been neglecting.

00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:53.349
&gt;&gt;Male #6: I have a short one.

00:36:53.349 --> 00:36:54.349
What would you suggest that?

00:36:54.349 --> 00:36:55.630
&gt;&gt;Sully: Hold on a minute
&gt;&gt;Male #6: What would you suggest for engineers

00:36:55.630 --> 00:36:56.630
who are working safety bases?

00:36:56.630 --> 00:36:57.630
&gt;&gt;Sully: I'm sorry, one more time.

00:36:57.630 --> 00:36:58.630
&gt;&gt;Male #6: What can you suggest engineers
who are working on safety critical systems?

00:36:58.630 --> 00:37:02.170
&gt;&gt;Sully: A couple of things to do.

00:37:02.170 --> 00:37:09.119
I would say the engineers who are working
on safety critical systems to realize that

00:37:09.119 --> 00:37:14.740
just as in medicine, just as in aviation,
just as in many other critical industries

00:37:14.740 --> 00:37:22.000
what we have now are human technology systems
that must function together seamlessly.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:27.849
And we need to involve the end-users as early
as possible in the system design.

00:37:27.849 --> 00:37:36.099
We need to take advantage of the limitations
and the abilities of the technology and of

00:37:36.099 --> 00:37:40.430
the humans and assign them appropriate roles
accordingly.

00:37:40.430 --> 00:37:49.789
For example in aviation as in many domains
technology is great, it affords us wonderful

00:37:49.789 --> 00:37:57.720
functionality, wonderful displays of information,
high levels of integration of electronic connectedness.

00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:03.140
But the downside of that is that technology
for the most part can only do what has been

00:38:03.140 --> 00:38:05.720
foreseen and programed.

00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:08.900
It's humans who can innovate.

00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:15.490
And by the way, my favorite definition of
innovation is changing before you're forced

00:38:15.490 --> 00:38:16.560
to.

00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:20.619
By regulation, by competition, by circumstance.

00:38:20.619 --> 00:38:25.839
And so what we did that day was to innovate
and the technology helped us to some extent

00:38:25.839 --> 00:38:34.700
but it was basically hand, manually flying
and making choices in terms of our human capabilities.

00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:37.850
So I would say keep the human factor in mind.

00:38:37.850 --> 00:38:42.589
Your engineering can be top-rated, first rate,
but if you don't take into account sufficiently

00:38:42.589 --> 00:38:47.940
appropriately the, how humans are going to
use it, the fact that humans are going to

00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:52.900
make mistakes and your systems need to be
tolerant of that and to make them as least

00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:58.230
likely as possible and you can still fail
and fail spectacularly if you don't do that.

00:38:58.230 --> 00:38:59.230
Yes sir.

00:38:59.230 --> 00:39:01.789
&gt;.Male #7: With that in mind how do you feel
about Airbus's programmed flight envelope

00:39:01.789 --> 00:39:05.800
and how it takes it all away from the pilot.

00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:12.970
&gt;&gt;Sully: I, the short answer is I prefer Boeing's
philosophy which is that when you approach

00:39:12.970 --> 00:39:20.319
certain limitations it will warn you, the
stick may shake or it may make a noise.

00:39:20.319 --> 00:39:25.570
But if you must go beyond that to avoid hitting
the ground, to avoid a collision, it's possible

00:39:25.570 --> 00:39:27.810
to do so.

00:39:27.810 --> 00:39:31.770
People have asked me if we would've had a
similar outcome in a Boeing airplane that

00:39:31.770 --> 00:39:38.420
day and my answer is I think we would have
as long as it was the general geometric layout

00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:45.450
was similar, in the airplanes shape and size
were similar we would've had a similar outcome.

00:39:45.450 --> 00:39:50.960
The Airbus I was flying was a fly by wire
airplane in which there is no longer a direct

00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:55.079
mechanical connection between the flight controls
in the cockpit, and the flight control circuits

00:39:55.079 --> 00:39:56.890
in the wings and tail.

00:39:56.890 --> 00:40:01.900
Instead there are flight control computers
that interpret and mediate the pilots inputs

00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:09.589
and then send electrical impulses to actuators
that move the control surfaces.

00:40:09.589 --> 00:40:16.289
The flight envelope protections that the Airbus
fly by wire system affords us we didn't need

00:40:16.289 --> 00:40:21.490
because we never got to the maximums at which
it would have essentially protected us from

00:40:21.490 --> 00:40:23.950
seeing certain limitations.

00:40:23.950 --> 00:40:31.039
And in one important way it hindered us and
this has not been well told, well known.

00:40:31.039 --> 00:40:36.090
We look at the digital flight data recorder
that has all kinds of streams of data, all

00:40:36.090 --> 00:40:40.619
the flight control positions, altitude, airspeed,
acceleration etc.

00:40:40.619 --> 00:40:47.930
And in the last 4 seconds of flight, that's
right before we touched down I was not yet

00:40:47.930 --> 00:40:52.500
achieving the maximum lift from the wings.

00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:58.500
I was commanding for more, pulling back full
aft on the stick and the flight control computers

00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:04.450
prevented me from getting more lift therefore
we hit harder than we would have, there was

00:41:04.450 --> 00:41:08.630
more damage underneath, more water came in
sooner.

00:41:08.630 --> 00:41:13.380
One structural piece of metal was driven up
through the back floor which cut Doreen Welsh,

00:41:13.380 --> 00:41:15.630
the flight attendants, leg.

00:41:15.630 --> 00:41:18.589
So that was not the way we were trained it
would work.

00:41:18.589 --> 00:41:24.210
It turns out there's a little-known software
feature known only then to a few Airbus software

00:41:24.210 --> 00:41:27.700
engineers, and to no pilots to no airlines
that was the case.

00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:29.550
It's called a phugoid mode.

00:41:29.550 --> 00:41:33.220
And it was not the way we were trained the
airplane should work, apparently it is the

00:41:33.220 --> 00:41:35.000
way the airplane does work.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:39.010
But that was not apparent to us and so in
that sense it actually hurt us.

00:41:39.010 --> 00:41:41.809
&gt;&gt;Male #5: Was it in direct law?

00:41:41.809 --> 00:41:44.190
&gt;&gt;Sully: No, he's asking if we were in direct
law.

00:41:44.190 --> 00:41:53.960
And there are three categories of sophistication
that are possible in the Airbus flight control

00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:55.359
system.

00:41:55.359 --> 00:41:59.829
The highest level, the normal level is called
normal law in which everything is working

00:41:59.829 --> 00:42:03.789
and all these flight protections are intact.

00:42:03.789 --> 00:42:09.250
It prevents you from going too fast or too
slow, or too high or too low, too much bank

00:42:09.250 --> 00:42:11.920
too much acceleration in terms of G.

00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:15.340
In alternate law you have some of those protections
but not all of them.

00:42:15.340 --> 00:42:19.539
That's a degraded mode but the flight control
protections are still somewhat active.

00:42:19.539 --> 00:42:25.809
In direct law none of the flight control protections
is active, it's possible to aerodynamically

00:42:25.809 --> 00:42:32.520
stall the wing, it won't prevent you from
doing that and it flies more like a more conventional

00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:33.520
airplane.

00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:37.650
Now we stayed in normal law the entire time
because in the first 2 seconds I started our

00:42:37.650 --> 00:42:44.110
airplanes auxiliary power unit and by the
time the left engine ripped up, the speed,

00:42:44.110 --> 00:42:50.140
RPMs decayed below the point at which the
left generator could continue power on electrical

00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:53.260
buses the APU generator was online.

00:42:53.260 --> 00:42:56.310
So we remained in normal law and all those
protections were intact.

00:42:56.310 --> 00:43:03.950
&gt;&gt;Male #7: We don't care about Republican
or Democrat, we just Airbus versus Boeing.

00:43:03.950 --> 00:43:05.589
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Sully: Okay.

00:43:05.589 --> 00:43:06.869
Alright let's see who else, there must be
some others.

00:43:06.869 --> 00:43:07.869
Yes sir, right here.

00:43:07.869 --> 00:43:11.849
&gt;&gt;Male #8: So you have mentioned about the
increasing flight time requirements from 250

00:43:11.849 --> 00:43:15.030
hours to 1500 hours.

00:43:15.030 --> 00:43:16.619
&gt;&gt;Sully: Yes.

00:43:16.619 --> 00:43:23.192
&gt;&gt;Male #8: So what kind of advice would you
give to younger pilots to get through that

00:43:23.192 --> 00:43:24.192
grind?

00:43:24.192 --> 00:43:25.192
Those who dream of being an airline pilot.

00:43:25.192 --> 00:43:26.192
&gt;&gt;Sully: How do you get from 200, if you want
to be a pilot at you get from 250 hours to

00:43:26.192 --> 00:43:27.192
1500 hours?

00:43:27.192 --> 00:43:31.440
Well that's, I think you'll do the same thing
that we've always done and if you don't go

00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:34.180
through the military which there are fewer
options now.

00:43:34.180 --> 00:43:38.770
And even if you decide to go that route you
owe the military more years to make up the

00:43:38.770 --> 00:43:44.059
12 now versus the five or six it used to be,
you'll have to do something else.

00:43:44.059 --> 00:43:49.950
But there are jobs out there and I think in
one way there probably are a few better situations.

00:43:49.950 --> 00:43:55.000
It used to be that you would go to one type
of an operation to fly and maybe via flight

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:57.540
instructor and small single engine propeller
flights for a while.

00:43:57.540 --> 00:44:02.060
And you would change companies and go somewhere
else to fly as copilot in a turboprop doing

00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:03.060
charters.

00:44:03.060 --> 00:44:05.940
And then eventually you could fly a Lear jet
someplace else.

00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:10.359
Now there are a few more operations where
it's more vertically integrated and you'll

00:44:10.359 --> 00:44:14.640
have more options to progress within that
same company.

00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:17.270
But it's a difficult thing to do, you're right.

00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:20.330
But there are options in spite of what the
regional Airlines Association lobbyists say

00:44:20.330 --> 00:44:26.030
there are options besides just flying banner
tows along the beach or being a flight instructor

00:44:26.030 --> 00:44:27.710
in small single engine airplanes.

00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:32.549
But it's always been hard, and it's no easier
now but does it really matter?

00:44:32.549 --> 00:44:38.970
I mean would you want to put your kids on
a regional jet where the first officer has

00:44:38.970 --> 00:44:40.359
250 hours I wouldn't.

00:44:40.359 --> 00:44:43.990
I mean it doesn't matter how hard it is it's
what's required.

00:44:43.990 --> 00:44:44.990
Yes.

00:44:44.990 --> 00:44:51.760
&gt;&gt;Male #9: Do you think a less experienced
pilot would've had a prayer?

00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:54.770
&gt;&gt;Sully: I think it would've been much harder.

00:44:54.770 --> 00:45:01.701
I think in every way whether it had been night,
whether it had still been snowing, whether

00:45:01.701 --> 00:45:04.180
we were little bit further from the river
is.

00:45:04.180 --> 00:45:10.140
If any of those things had changed it would've
been much harder and had I had with me, well

00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:12.170
I'm assuming you're talking about both pilots.

00:45:12.170 --> 00:45:19.289
Had the captain been less experienced it might
not have been as hardwired in his or her brain

00:45:19.289 --> 00:45:28.130
a way of synthesizing a lifetime of experience
and training to come up with a way to solve

00:45:28.130 --> 00:45:31.550
this new problem you've never seen before
in 208 seconds.

00:45:31.550 --> 00:45:37.369
Had I had a less experienced first officer,
I still wouldn't have had time to direct them.

00:45:37.369 --> 00:45:42.339
So it would've meant that I would've had to
do more things myself which I probably really

00:45:42.339 --> 00:45:43.680
couldn't have done.

00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:46.470
Because I was maxed out.

00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:51.350
And I wouldn't have had as much help because
Jeff Stiles had also been a captain before

00:45:51.350 --> 00:45:56.059
on a 737 before all the cutbacks had forced
him back into the right seat to be a first

00:45:56.059 --> 00:45:57.059
officer again.

00:45:57.059 --> 00:46:00.270
He also had 20,000 hours of flying time like
I did.

00:46:00.270 --> 00:46:05.670
And so he intuitively and immediately grasped
the situation as it built as I did.

00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:08.450
I didn't have to tell him what was going on,
he saw it and he knew it.

00:46:08.450 --> 00:46:12.240
He was able to listen to my conversation with
the air traffic controller on the radio and

00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:14.220
infer my intent.

00:46:14.220 --> 00:46:18.960
He knew intuitively and immediately to shift
his priorities on his own initiative, I didn't

00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:23.500
have a chance to tell him later in the flight
to stop trying to regain usable thrust, using

00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:29.039
the checklist with what turned out to be these
irreparably damaged engines and instead by

00:46:29.039 --> 00:46:32.980
calling out airspeed and altitude to me he
help me judge that final critical maneuver

00:46:32.980 --> 00:46:34.460
at the height above the river.

00:46:34.460 --> 00:46:38.010
Judging it visually at which I began raising
the nose to start to land.

00:46:38.010 --> 00:46:42.260
If I'd waited too long, we have hit too hard,
wouldn't have gotten the nose up enough.

00:46:42.260 --> 00:46:46.849
If I began to raise the nose too soon we go
to slow and drop and hit too hard.

00:46:46.849 --> 00:46:51.790
So he had to call out the airspeed and altitude
to me to help me judge that critical height.

00:46:51.790 --> 00:46:57.069
So had either one of us been not as experienced
we could not have had as good an outcome.

00:46:57.069 --> 00:47:04.190
Everything, every part of it would've been
harder that's why, we make it look so easy

00:47:04.190 --> 00:47:08.150
being an airline pilot because so much goes
so right so much of the time.

00:47:08.150 --> 00:47:13.099
But at any given moment you have to be able
to handle whatever the cosmos throws at you

00:47:13.099 --> 00:47:15.520
even if it's never been thought of before.

00:47:15.520 --> 00:47:17.150
And get it right the first time.

00:47:17.150 --> 00:47:19.280
That's our job and that's why experience matters.

00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:20.280
Are we out of time?

00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:21.710
&gt;&gt;Male # 11: We're out of time, so a big round
of applause.

00:47:21.710 --> 00:47:23.270
[Applause]
&gt;&gt;Sully: thank you, thank you.
