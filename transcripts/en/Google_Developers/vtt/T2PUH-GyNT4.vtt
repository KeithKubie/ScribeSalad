[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.744 --> 00:00:09.880
FLORINA MUNTENESCU: Hi,
and welcome to I/O live.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.400
I'm Florina
Muntenescu, your host.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.400
And I'm here today with
Sascha Prueter, Director

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.464
of Product of Android TV.

00:00:15.464 --> 00:00:16.630
SASCHA PRUETER: Hi, Florina.

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:18.255
FLORINA MUNTENESCU:
So tell me, Sascha,

00:00:18.255 --> 00:00:21.040
what's new with Android TV?

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.980
SASCHA PRUETER: We
have a bunch of stuff

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.050
that we are excited to talk,
specifically with developers

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.480
at Google I/O, because it is a
developer conference after all.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.619
So we do a lot of
talks and sessions

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:38.470
here about how TV app developers
can actually integrate really

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:39.620
well with Android TV.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.400
So as you can see on
the screen, if I just

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.310
stroll around a little
bit, we want app developers

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:49.390
to get their top content and
really beautiful pictures,

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.220
all the metadata on screen.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.260
But we want to make sure
it's not only YouTube

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.020
or HBO that can do that stuff.

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.890
We want every app
developer can do this.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:57.390
Right?

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.320
So we talk a lot
about new ways, how

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.545
we can do this
integration really nice,

00:01:02.545 --> 00:01:05.410
what ways we have to
help you with this.

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.640
And basically, want to enable
developers to have really

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.060
the best content on the TV and
make the content really shine.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.970
Because we want to help them
make their apps popular.

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:17.562
And then, obviously,
it's Google I/O.

00:01:17.562 --> 00:01:19.270
So we're talking about
Android P as well.

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.370
We have a bunch of new stuff
in Android P for users,

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:26.370
but also for developers.

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.490
So some examples for users are--
we have a very new set up flow

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.380
that gets you all
your favorite apps

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.990
already, when you
set up a device.

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.540
We have features
like autofill, where

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.970
if you have already logged
in on some other device,

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.970
you already get your login
credentials on Android TV.

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.140
So you don't have to
clumsily enter passwords

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.140
with the remote control.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.870
No one likes that, right?

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:51.900
But also they have
cool, new platform APIs

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.570
in Android P where,
for example, we

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.990
have external camera support.

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:01.360
So you could start to develop
camera apps on TV as well.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.010
That's some of the stuff with
Android P where you can use

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.169
the new Android P preview SDK.

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:09.729
It has a TV Emulator,
and you can get

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.074
started with it if you want.

00:02:12.074 --> 00:02:13.740
FLORINA MUNTENESCU:
I know last year you

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.270
launched the Assistant in
the US, but I live in London.

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.339
Can I finally use
it in London, also?

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:19.880
SASCHA PRUETER: A
very good question.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.430
Actually, the
international support

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.686
for the Google
Assistant on Android TV

00:02:24.686 --> 00:02:25.810
is rolling out as we speak.

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.810
So specifically, the UK and
some other European countries

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.570
rolled out in the
next few weeks.

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.640
But since you mentioned
the Assistant,

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.470
one really cool thing we
announced here at Google I/O

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.770
is our new sound bar project
that we did with JBL.

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.420
It's the JBL link bar
that you can see here.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.210
And we really like
the combination

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.780
of having a TV device
powering a TV screen,

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.060
but with really awesome sound,
and a far-field microphone

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.630
built in.

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.330
So you don't really need
this remote control anymore.

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.490
You can basically
just sit on the sofa

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:01.210
and control your TV
device, or any device

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:03.220
connected to the sound bar.

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.120
So you can ask things
like, hey Google.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.892
What's my agenda today?

00:03:09.892 --> 00:03:11.850
GOOGLE ASSISTANT: Today,
there's only one thing

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.290
on your calendar.

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.792
It's at 6:00 PM and its
title is, "Pick up the dog".

00:03:16.792 --> 00:03:19.000
SASCHA PRUETER: Yeah, I
really shouldn't forget that.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.446
But it's really nice.

00:03:20.446 --> 00:03:22.320
You don't have to get
up from the couch, look

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.611
for the remote control anymore.

00:03:23.611 --> 00:03:27.120
You just talk to your TV
in a very natural way.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.380
Hey, Google, go home.

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:30.630
FLORINA MUNTENESCU: OK, great.

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.180
So I can continue losing
my remote control.

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.190
But still, I'm an
Android developer.

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.990
So what can I do practically?

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:42.067
Is there some code that
I can already write?

00:03:42.067 --> 00:03:44.400
SASCHA PRUETER: You could
download the Android P Preview

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.920
SDK with your Emulator,
but we know developers want

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.399
to work with real hardware.

00:03:48.399 --> 00:03:50.940
So one really cool thing we are
announcing here at Google I/O

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.660
is the ADT-2 Developer Device.

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.580
For those of you who
have been developing

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.830
for Android TV for a
while, might remember

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:01.740
we had a ADT-1 Developer
Device in 2014,

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.750
launched at Google I/O.
And after four years,

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.800
we thought, it's time
to do that again.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.590
So it's a neat little
Android TV dongle

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.960
you can connect to your TV.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.260
You can sign up for this.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.740
We have a sign-up form live.

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.119
And we are selecting--

00:04:17.119 --> 00:04:18.660
it's a limited
edition device, but we

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.951
make sure a lot of developers
are getting one of those.

00:04:20.951 --> 00:04:23.010
It's a real cool small
Android TV dongle,

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:24.390
voice-enabled remote control.

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.181
So all the things we've
been talking about,

00:04:26.181 --> 00:04:28.590
content integration, Assistant
integration for your apps,

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.642
you can try that all
out on the device.

00:04:30.642 --> 00:04:31.725
FLORINA MUNTENESCU: Great.

00:04:31.725 --> 00:04:33.019
Thank you very much, Sascha.

00:04:33.019 --> 00:04:35.310
So we already have a lot of
new things for Android TV--

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.230
both for developers
and for end users.

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:41.370
So now all we need to do
is check out the developer

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.940
documentation and also
sign up for the dongle.

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.020
Thank you, Sascha.

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.209
SASCHA PRUETER: Thank you.

00:04:47.209 --> 00:04:49.250
FLORINA MUNTENESCU: This
is Florina for I/O live.
