00:06:41.254 --> 00:06:43.590
LOUIS GRAY: Welcome back to
Google Developers Live.

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:46.150
I'm Louis Gray here with Google
Developers Live from

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:48.310
Mountain View, California
at Google headquarters.

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:50.850
I have a great guess with me for
the second day in a row,

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:53.900
Brian Fitzpatrick, coming here
to talk to us about Data

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:56.620
Liberation and the Data
Liberation Front all the way

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:58.600
from sunny Chicago, Illinois.

00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:59.637
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: It's
very sunny right now,

00:06:59.637 --> 00:07:00.411
as a matter of fact.

00:07:00.411 --> 00:07:01.610
LOUIS GRAY: Welcome, Fitz.

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:03.060
It's always good to
have you around.

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:07.100
And I know from my time prior
to joining Google, we got to

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:09.230
talk a lot about the work that
you're doing in this really,

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:12.770
kind of, unique and individual
project with Data Liberation.

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:15.635
We often talk a lot about new
products that are coming out

00:07:15.635 --> 00:07:17.760
and new features that are
getting rolled out.

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:20.590
But then the users go
ahead and use that.

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:22.620
And they put in a little
bit of data.

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:24.220
And usually, that's the
end of the story.

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:26.420
And you've done something
completely different, which is

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:28.730
talking about getting
that data out.

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:31.330
And so I want to really
start at the very top.

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:34.045
Let's talk about Data Liberation
Front, where are

00:07:34.045 --> 00:07:36.860
you coming at with this, and
what can users do to

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:37.650
get their data out?

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:39.102
Why is this important?

00:07:39.102 --> 00:07:41.565
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Well,
I want to answer

00:07:41.565 --> 00:07:42.320
the important question.

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:46.000
I think it's important more than
anything because it's the

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.630
data you put into your products
and the data that you

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:51.360
create into products in any
company that's holding your

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.680
data for you, it's
stated, that you

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:54.830
should be able to control.

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:56.470
You should be able
to put it in.

00:07:56.470 --> 00:07:57.510
You should be able
to take it out.

00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:59.220
And you should be able
to delete it.

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:01.390
And that's the basic argument.

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:04.380
The interesting thing is that I
found, when we were talking

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:06.750
about starting the Data
Liberation Front, that many

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:11.010
companies, Google included,
would make it, I would say,

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:12.440
possible for you to take
your data out.

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:14.290
But it wasn't always easy.

00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:18.720
So our thought was, instead of
doing public relations to say,

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:21.380
yes, you can get your data out
and it's easy when it really

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:24.370
wasn't, that, as an engineering
company, we could

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:26.350
actually build products.

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:29.420
And make engineering changes
to make it easy for you to

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:30.160
take your data out.

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:31.780
LOUIS GRAY: And what are
those kinds of changes?

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:34.309
I know from having used this
product myself, you have

00:08:34.309 --> 00:08:37.049
essentially centralized one
place for me to get my data

00:08:37.049 --> 00:08:38.340
out from multiple services.

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:39.380
Is that right?

00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:40.370
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Correct.

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:43.000
Google Takeout is where
we are today.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.100
But we first started this
project, internally, back in

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:49.840
2007, which seems like a long,
long time ago now.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:52.490
And we, basically, put together
a small team of

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:55.135
engineers to go from product to
product and say, hey, have

00:08:55.135 --> 00:08:58.010
you ever considered making
it easy for users to

00:08:58.010 --> 00:08:59.290
export their data?

00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:00.400
And everyone would
say, oh, yeah.

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:01.500
We've been thinking about it.

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:04.990
It's been on our roadmap
since, like, 1993.

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:07.560
But it's really low priority
because we've got a lot of

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:08.660
other stuff we're
trying to do.

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:12.650
And people aren't beating the
door down asking leave.

00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:13.825
LOUIS GRAY: That's a good
thing that they're

00:09:13.825 --> 00:09:14.745
not trying to leave.

00:09:14.745 --> 00:09:16.080
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: It
is a good thing.

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:20.460
But I said, what if we come
in and help you do the

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:20.830
[INAUDIBLE].

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:22.080
What if we did the work
with your team?

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:23.690
Just parachute in and,
actually, do

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:24.790
the engineering work.

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:26.750
And every one was like, oh, this
is the best thing ever.

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:27.610
Please, come right in.

00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:28.480
You know?

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.080
Have a cup of coffee.

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:31.300
So we started doing that.

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:33.140
We went from product
to product.

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:36.690
It was, actually, Notebook and
iGoogle, which were the first

00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:39.030
things before we warmed up to
Blogger, which was the big

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:40.890
first project we did.

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:44.150
And as we started doing this,
the team started to realize

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:46.920
that this was just intractable
because Google was adding new

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.340
products at the time.

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:52.030
And we had these, sort of,
three questions to

00:09:52.030 --> 00:09:53.450
ask with your data.

00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:55.210
Can I get it out?

00:09:55.210 --> 00:09:56.630
How long is it going to
take to get it out?

00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:57.990
And how much is it
going to cost?

00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:01.760
And we realized that the
how long was just

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:03.520
continuing to go linearly.

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:05.453
Every time we had a product,
that means one more thing you

00:10:05.453 --> 00:10:06.420
have to go download.

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:09.910
So being engineers, my
team was like this

00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:12.890
doesn't seem right.

00:10:12.890 --> 00:10:14.540
I said, well, what would
you like to do?

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:16.800
If you could do anything you
want, what would you guys do?

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:19.560
And they went off, and they
came back to me two weeks

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:21.640
later and said we want to
create this thing, which

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:24.240
turned out to be Takeout, where
you can go and get all

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:26.540
your data at one place.

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:28.220
Just click and get all your data
for all Google products.

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:29.460
Now we're still working
on getting some

00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:31.370
products, to be clear.

00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:33.980
But I'm like, that sound
suitably insane.

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:35.400
Let's make it happen.

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:38.690
So they started working
on that a while back.

00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:42.430
And we launched that the same
day Google+ launched in 2011.

00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:44.080
And over the course of
the past to years--

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:45.160
LOUIS GRAY: I bet that
was a big day.

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:47.950
I mean, not working at Google
at that time trying to cover

00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:48.990
all the news that
was coming out.

00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:51.530
I know we did a Hangout talking
about the Google

00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:53.020
Takeout project that
[INAUDIBLE].

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:53.210
BRIAN FITZPATRICK:
That's right.

00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:55.870
That was one of the first
Hangout press interviews ever.

00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:57.900
LOUIS GRAY: And we had
a dedicated circle.

00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:00.160
And those of us dialed in from
our homes, where we were, and

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:00.810
learned about it.

00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:02.520
And there was a lot to
cover at that time.

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:05.780
You're talking about bringing
your data and moving along

00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:08.330
from project to project and
product to product.

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:11.980
As someone who's been using the
internet for some time,

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:14.540
you and I, probably, have
accumulated our own history of

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:16.290
number of email addresses
and number of email

00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:17.400
clients that we've had.

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:20.050
And prior to Gmail, most of
these were like software.

00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:21.990
So I've been one of those guys
that's, kind of, been an email

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:26.190
hoarder and moved it from
Eudora over to Microsoft

00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:27.210
Outlook Express.

00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:30.530
And maybe back to Apple Mail and
then back over to Gmail.

00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:32.720
So we've always thought there
was that capability where you

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:34.800
could export it and then
move it along.

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.500
But that doesn't seem
to be the way that

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:37.570
most software works.

00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:40.640
And maybe I'm one of those odd
people who doesn't abandon my

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:42.720
10 year ago email.

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:45.260
What kind of data do you think
is the thing that people

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:46.430
export the most?

00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:51.060
What is the most valuable to
them to get a hold of?

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:52.960
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Well, first
of all, I'd like to say that

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:58.100
I've got all my email,
since 1995, in Gmail.

00:11:58.100 --> 00:11:59.970
And I actually went through,
recently, in search for

00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:02.430
something that came from 1996.

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:04.830
So it's pretty awesome
to have that around.

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:05.880
LOUIS GRAY: That's a
lot of gigs, Fitz.

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:07.540
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Actually,
it's not that much because,

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:09.680
back in the '90s, people
didn't mail

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:11.050
anything around but text.

00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:13.180
Like, I didn't get pictures
and movies and

00:12:13.180 --> 00:12:13.710
crazy things like that.

00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:15.430
LOUIS GRAY: Attachments that you
would send could take the

00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:16.610
company server down.

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:17.240
BRIAN FITZPATRICK:
Yeah, exactly.

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:19.740
So you never wanted to like--
and people had limits on their

00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:20.260
signatures.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:20.620
You remember?

00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:22.510
Like, anything more than
four lines, someone

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:24.590
would yell at you.

00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:29.230
Yeah, but the most valuable
things tend to be things that

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:30.820
people don't consider as data.

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:33.670
Like, I think contacts are very
valuable, for one thing,

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:35.110
because it's your way of
getting a hold of your

00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:37.040
friends, and family, and
that sort of thing.

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:40.470
But the most valuable one that
I see, really, is photos

00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:42.960
because photos are very
emotional things.

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:46.880
The example that I tell people
when I meet someone new and

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:47.580
they say, what do
you at Google?

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:49.180
Do you work on the doodles
with the Pac-Man thing?

00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:50.610
And they say, oh,
that's great.

00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:51.990
And I said, no, I don't
work on that.

00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:53.860
And they're just like,
I'm not interested.

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:55.090
But I say, what I work
on is this Data

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:56.080
Liberation Front thing.

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:58.615
And if they're not a technical
person, they're like

00:12:58.615 --> 00:12:59.480
[SNORING SOUND]

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:00.780
because this is boring
to them.

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:01.840
Why should they care
about data?

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:03.820
LOUIS GRAY: It's boring until
they really want it.

00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:05.660
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Not only
that, but it's boring until I

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:09.380
say, look, at home do you have
a shoe box full of old photos

00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:10.890
and letters from your
grandparents

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:12.680
from back in the day?

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:13.830
And they're usually like yeah.

00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:14.450
It's up in a closet.

00:13:14.450 --> 00:13:16.030
It's not very useful to me.

00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:17.770
I said, you don't share
it with folks.

00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:21.300
You can't look at it very easily
and leaf through it and

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:22.340
search through it.

00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:25.490
But if that disappeared, you'd
probably be pretty upset.

00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:26.900
And [INAUDIBLE] says,
of course.

00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:28.640
This is very emotional
and very valuable.

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:30.100
I said, it's the same thing
with the data that you're

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:34.210
creating in your blog, or
Google+, or your photos, or

00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:35.870
any of this type of stuff.

00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:39.290
So I really encourage people to
think of their data not as

00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:41.830
a bunch of ones and zeroes but
as something that is your

00:13:41.830 --> 00:13:43.060
digital legacy.

00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:47.300
It's that shoe box but in a much
more useful fashion and

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:48.610
stored on the internet.

00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:51.510
And we're, sort of, custodians
of that data.

00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:54.280
We need to make sure that we
don't lose it, for one.

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:56.190
But we also need to make sure
that you could take a copy of

00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:59.420
it with you if you want to go
somewhere else, or try a

00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:02.830
different product somewhere, or
just have another copy at

00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:04.520
home for peace of mind
because disk

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:05.950
storage is so cheap nowadays.

00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:07.850
LOUIS GRAY: One of the
interesting things you have,

00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:10.650
from an engineering perspective,
is the challenge

00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:13.280
itself of picking the correct
standard and making sure it

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:14.630
sticks around for a while.

00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:16.350
I remember from your
introductory video that's

00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:20.080
quite famous, you walk through
the zip drives, and the beta

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:22.590
disks, and DVDs, and the CDs.

00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:25.090
And over time, some of these
places where we used to store

00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:27.210
data start to seem quaint.

00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:29.210
Who really carries these
floppy disks around?

00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:31.220
So how do you approach a problem
like that, from the

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:34.560
technology perspective, and say
all of these photos that

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:37.680
you're going to be able to
export from be it Picasa or

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:39.310
Google+ Photos or somewhere?

00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:40.860
What's the right standard
to choose?

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:43.200
How do you know that it's going
to be good to export?

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:46.300
And, possibly, good to import
somewhere else?

00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:48.010
And does that ever change?

00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:48.890
BRIAN FITZPATRICK:
It does change.

00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:50.570
Standards change all the time.

00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:52.000
And the interesting thing
about standards is that

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.030
there's so many to
choose from.

00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:54.750
That's the, sort
of, old adage.

00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:57.600
But our baseline is
for exporters.

00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:00.520
We choose open standards that
are not encumbered by patents

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:04.520
that are as simple as possible
so that engineers, like the

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:07.510
team that works on Data
Liberation Front, can easily

00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:10.500
write a program that could parse
it, put it into another

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:13.610
product, and transform
it in some fashion.

00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:16.590
The interesting thing is that
when you have data on your

00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:19.760
laptop, like you used to years
ago, you have a Chromebook,

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:22.030
which is an amazing
piece of hardware.

00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:25.180
LOUIS GRAY: This pixel has maybe
two megs of content,

00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:27.080
locally, on my hard drive
because I never need to do it.

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:27.960
It's like transitory.

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:29.600
If I'm going to take it down,
I'm going to put it right back

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:30.645
up in the cloud and that's it.

00:15:30.645 --> 00:15:31.476
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: It's To extra
copy, typically, but

00:15:31.476 --> 00:15:32.680
it's all stored in the cloud.

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:34.850
But in the old days, when you
have something in your laptop

00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:38.470
and formats would change,
you'd be stuck behind.

00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:39.200
You'd have to find a

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:40.900
translation program or something.

00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:47.480
On my laptop, I have an old Word
Processor file from 1995.

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:49.850
There's no Word Processor
available to open that file.

00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:53.190
And it's an actual valid
file, as far as I know.

00:15:53.190 --> 00:15:56.710
It's just that the file format
has gone the way of the dodos.

00:15:56.710 --> 00:15:58.060
LOUIS GRAY: To the data
standard graveyard.

00:15:58.060 --> 00:15:59.850
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: To the data
center graveyard, yes.

00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:02.850
And the interesting thing about
that is that if Google

00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:04.600
has all your data, or some
other company online is

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:07.190
storing data for many,
many people.

00:16:07.190 --> 00:16:12.170
We can run a program over all
that and change from format to

00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:14.290
format, in many cases,
losslessly.

00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:17.590
So as new formats
come into play--

00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:19.730
I think YouTube is as
an example of this.

00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:20.430
Right?

00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:24.940
They can transcode your videos
from mobile to be much more

00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:28.570
bandwidth effective
or much less

00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:29.860
inefficient using bandwidth.

00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:32.210
They can transcode things
for lower resolution,

00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:33.140
that kind of thing.

00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:34.930
But they still got the
original there.

00:16:34.930 --> 00:16:39.300
And in fact, when YouTube went
into Takeout, we made sure you

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:41.870
could get your original copy so
you're not losing any data

00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:42.620
there at all.

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:44.830
LOUIS GRAY: We're broadcasting
on YouTube right now.

00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:45.300
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Really?

00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:46.000
LOUIS GRAY: I don't know
if you knew that.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:46.410
It's happening--

00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:46.530
BRIAN FITZPATRICK:
This is awesome.

00:16:46.530 --> 00:16:47.410
LOUIS GRAY: --right
now this second.

00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:48.270
BRIAN FITZPATRICK:
The future's now.

00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:50.130
LOUIS GRAY: One of the cool
things about broadcasting on

00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:52.090
YouTube is you have the live
version, and then you have the

00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:54.220
archive copy, which people can
go in later and, as you

00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:55.330
mentioned, you can
download it.

00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:57.040
And if you're somebody who's
really good with software, you

00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:59.710
can just make a edit
and put it back up.

00:16:59.710 --> 00:17:00.930
One of things I was
thinking of--

00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:03.360
I get this question a lot when
we're talking about Google,

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:05.021
and I think we mentioned a
little bit yesterday when we

00:17:05.021 --> 00:17:07.650
were discussing organizational
manipulation--

00:17:07.650 --> 00:17:10.030
is altruism.

00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:13.680
People tend to not trust
companies that provide

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:15.569
software or services.

00:17:15.569 --> 00:17:17.329
And they're wondering, why is
it that you're providing me

00:17:17.329 --> 00:17:18.450
with this service?

00:17:18.450 --> 00:17:21.540
Why do you want me to
get my data out?

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:23.660
Don't you care about the
customer being locked in?

00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:26.140
Don't you want to have
more user data?

00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:28.246
Like, what's your deal?

00:17:28.246 --> 00:17:30.930
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: I disagree
with your first statement.

00:17:30.930 --> 00:17:34.710
I think people don't trust
companies period because why

00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:35.215
should they?

00:17:35.215 --> 00:17:37.860
The reputation and if you look
at past performance, I think

00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:39.890
many companies have done things
that have shown users

00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:42.220
that we're not to be trusted.

00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:45.130
And I don't think that Google
is doing any of this data

00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:46.690
liberation stuff.

00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:48.310
We'll talk about transparency
tomorrow.

00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:50.810
None of this is because we're
nice people or altruistic.

00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:53.220
Although, I think you and I,
at least, are nice people.

00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:54.470
LOUIS GRAY: That's two down.

00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:55.100
BRIAN FITZPATRICK:
Yeah, exactly.

00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:55.780
Two down.

00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:58.210
Several 10,000 to go.

00:17:58.210 --> 00:18:02.140
But really it's because it's
good for business long term.

00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:05.360
And I think Google has managed
to tie its' success with the

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:06.710
success of the internet.

00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:08.980
And it's a very consumer
friendly attitude.

00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:11.350
So many times it may look like
we're doing this Data

00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:12.660
Liberation thing for altruism.

00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:18.060
But honestly, it's by focusing
on keeping users by

00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:19.300
engineering innovation.

00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:22.200
Making our products better and
making our products faster.

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:27.060
I think that it's a better way
to compete and a better way to

00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:28.050
keep our users.

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:31.835
For example, I ask people all
the time who are at Google who

00:18:31.835 --> 00:18:33.500
ask me why we're doing this
Data Liberation thing.

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:35.590
I say, well, do you
use Google search?

00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:37.270
And, most of the time,
they'll say yes.

00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:39.730
I'll say, did you buy
a two year contract

00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:41.260
to use Google search?

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:42.350
They're like, no.

00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:44.060
I'm like, did you buy a piece
of hardware that only works

00:18:44.060 --> 00:18:45.840
with Google search?

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:46.980
And they'll say no.

00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:47.680
Of course not.

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:48.710
I use my browser.

00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:50.630
I can go to Bing.com
if I want to.

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:53.500
All right, well, why are you
still using Google search?

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:55.720
And their response usually is,
well, it finds what I want and

00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:56.370
gets out of my way.

00:18:56.370 --> 00:18:58.660
It's the best product
for my needs.

00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:01.400
And my argument is that
all of our products

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:02.460
should be that way.

00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:04.620
If Blogger isn't the best
product for needs, then you

00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:07.360
should be able to take your data
and go use WordPress, or

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:08.460
TypePad, or something
like that.

00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:09.930
Same goes for photos.

00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:11.490
Same goes for your G+ stream.

00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:12.170
That sort of thing.

00:19:12.170 --> 00:19:14.260
LOUIS GRAY: So you think, maybe,
it puts a little bit of

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:16.950
pressure on the services that
we provide to get better and

00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:18.570
make sure that we're maintained
as being the best.

00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:23.280
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Well, I
think it's partly that.

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:26.530
But I think part of it is the
fact that, if you lock your

00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:28.970
users in, your product can be
dying in the vine and you're

00:19:28.970 --> 00:19:32.470
not even going to know it
because the users will reach a

00:19:32.470 --> 00:19:35.310
point we're they'll just leave
without their data.

00:19:35.310 --> 00:19:37.320
And the interesting thing
about us is we

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:38.390
have a lot of products.

00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:40.530
So if you decide you want to
leave one of our products

00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:42.640
today because you found a better
product to meet your

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:45.800
needs, I would argue that that
experience with leaving has to

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:48.060
be a good experience for you.

00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:49.850
Otherwise, we're not going to
get you to come back next

00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:51.370
week, or tomorrow, or
the month after

00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:53.270
to try a new product.

00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:56.660
And I think the fact that we're
on the internet where

00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:58.735
it's super easy to try new
products and super easy to

00:19:58.735 --> 00:20:02.310
switch, I think trust is more
important than it was years

00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:05.890
ago when you would have to go
to the store and get a box

00:20:05.890 --> 00:20:08.280
with a diskette in it or a
bunch of diskettes in it.

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:11.580
And come home and install
it and reboot.

00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:14.590
Then neighbor kid comes over
and tells you you got the

00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:17.420
wrong software and you have
to go back to the store.

00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:18.930
LOUIS GRAY: Hopefully,
they do returns

00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:19.740
without too much damage.

00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:21.180
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: But they
don't because it's a shrink

00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:22.780
wrap EULA, right?

00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:24.080
We're in a different place.

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:29.020
Most software on the web you can
try for either a reduced

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:32.530
functionality version or for a
limited period of time and see

00:20:32.530 --> 00:20:33.150
if you like it.

00:20:33.150 --> 00:20:36.180
And if you like it, then you go
ahead and you use it or you

00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:40.390
buy it whether it's ad driven
or you pay a subscription.

00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:45.010
So there's a lot of, I think,
things that have changed in

00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:48.700
the past 15 years that mean that
that trust is important.

00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:50.620
And I think that's one
of the most valuable

00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:51.220
things that we have.

00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:53.520
And I think Data Liberation is
a way of protecting that.

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:54.030
LOUIS GRAY: Now, you
talked about

00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:55.050
this at the very beginning.

00:20:55.050 --> 00:20:57.470
The initials sell, I guess, for
the Data Liberation Front,

00:20:57.470 --> 00:21:01.070
you had to go product to
product, person to person, and

00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:02.580
say I have this idea.

00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:03.830
How can I help you?

00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:04.910
Is that still the case?

00:21:04.910 --> 00:21:06.990
I mean, the Data Liberation
Front, you say

00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:07.890
you started in '07.

00:21:07.890 --> 00:21:10.180
I think it was announced
in '09.

00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:12.880
Takeout was introduced
in 2011.

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:14.630
So it's been around
for a while.

00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:17.910
How do you go about going to the
next product and trying to

00:21:17.910 --> 00:21:18.750
make a case?

00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:19.910
Is it harder now?

00:21:19.910 --> 00:21:21.120
Is it easier now?

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:24.520
When Google products are made do
they have Takeout in mind?

00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:26.790
Or is it still, kind of, going
back to the start?

00:21:26.790 --> 00:21:28.390
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: It's
a lot easier now.

00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:33.340
I mean, it's a lot easier now
because, internally, Googlers

00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:38.240
have seen the value, the
benefit, that the user trust

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:41.670
that their products get from
having Takeout integration.

00:21:41.670 --> 00:21:45.170
So, typically, what happened
nowadays is a product, either

00:21:45.170 --> 00:21:48.100
an existing product or one that
hasn't launched yet, will

00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:50.440
come to us and say, hey, we
want to be in Takeout.

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:52.660
And we have a little integration
document that's

00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:54.580
super straightforward
and very simple.

00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:56.950
And we've refined it over the
years to make sure that it's,

00:21:56.950 --> 00:22:00.490
actually, easy to follow, that
they can go ahead and

00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:04.510
implement the following little
bit of API, and then do a last

00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:05.800
little time with us.

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:08.000
And it's, relatively,
straightforward to make it

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.220
easy for us to put your
data into Takeout.

00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:14.750
So a lot of products come
directly to us and say, hey,

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:16.100
we want to do this.

00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:18.150
In some cases, some products
ask us for help.

00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:20.050
In some cases, we go and say,
hey, we'd like to have your

00:22:20.050 --> 00:22:21.490
product in Takeout.

00:22:21.490 --> 00:22:25.020
But we're very selective about
the ones that we go after.

00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:27.230
But it's never a fight.

00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:29.350
It's always like, hey,
this is great.

00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:30.760
Thank you guys for
helping us out.

00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:31.890
LOUIS GRAY: And do you ever find
that it's kind of like a

00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:32.640
user swell?

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:36.180
Like, if persons one through one
million say I want to get

00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:39.470
my data out of product x, does
that help your push?

00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:42.650
And say I need to go and extract
more data out of, say,

00:22:42.650 --> 00:22:45.490
G+ or Chrome, or one of the
other supported services?

00:22:48.032 --> 00:22:49.720
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: I don't think
there's ever been that

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:50.350
little problem.

00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:55.330
I think the push the really hard
pushes always come from

00:22:55.330 --> 00:22:56.930
myself and the team itself.

00:22:56.930 --> 00:22:58.080
They always want it
to be better.

00:22:58.080 --> 00:22:59.740
I mean, the team of engineers
I have working at Data

00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:02.050
Liberation are some of the
finest engineers I've ever

00:23:02.050 --> 00:23:02.840
worked with.

00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:06.100
They've got to dive into parts
of Googles and code base

00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:07.330
across the board.

00:23:07.330 --> 00:23:11.390
And it's a real challenge just
from a systems point of view.

00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:13.480
They're dealing with lots
of data, in some cases.

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:14.650
YouTube, for example.

00:23:14.650 --> 00:23:16.350
Those videos can get very big.

00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:19.660
They're dealing with lots of
smaller files in other cases.

00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:23.500
And they're dealing with,
basically, securely

00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:25.300
authenticating across systems.

00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:26.650
We can't just go and
grab your data.

00:23:26.650 --> 00:23:28.780
We need to make sure that
we're passing your

00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:30.760
authentication along the way.

00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:33.330
And we securely get it so we
can never look at it at any

00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:34.842
point or anything like that.

00:23:34.842 --> 00:23:36.310
LOUIS GRAY: You brought
up something that's an

00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:36.760
interesting point.

00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:37.800
You were talking about
the pixel.

00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:40.450
And I've transitioned to
being full Chrome OS.

00:23:40.450 --> 00:23:41.545
I've been that way
for, probably, a

00:23:41.545 --> 00:23:42.910
year and a half now.

00:23:42.910 --> 00:23:45.650
But what's interesting with me
is I don't have a shoe box in

00:23:45.650 --> 00:23:46.350
the closet.

00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:47.880
What I have are old laptops.

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:51.550
So I've got a Mac that I stopped
using when I changed

00:23:51.550 --> 00:23:52.420
jobs in '09.

00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:55.120
I've got a Mac that I used
from '09 to 2011.

00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:57.810
I've got the Mac I got when
I started working here.

00:23:57.810 --> 00:23:59.370
And then I've got the pixel.

00:23:59.370 --> 00:24:02.690
So I, kind of, have a slice
of time in my own

00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:04.200
history of my data.

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:07.130
Like, here are the photos of
when my kids were two to four.

00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:09.440
Here's photos when my kids
were four to five.

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:12.630
And what I've done is taken a
lot of work to get it all into

00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:14.570
the cloud and get
it protected.

00:24:14.570 --> 00:24:18.460
And when you start to think
about that as a service owner

00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:22.270
or a service manipulator, going
back to yesterday, how

00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:25.980
much additional pressure is it
to get that right when the

00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:28.530
cloud starts to take up an
increasing percentage of

00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:31.200
user's data so that you know
they, probably, don't have a

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:32.440
local copy anymore.

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:35.050
How much more challenging is it
to make sure you've got the

00:24:35.050 --> 00:24:37.255
right standards and that we
don't delete anything?

00:24:37.255 --> 00:24:38.930
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Well, I think
it's always a challenge

00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:41.290
to make sure that we never
lose any data.

00:24:41.290 --> 00:24:42.750
That would be horrible.

00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:44.590
That's a big trust issue.

00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:46.660
And that's why, a lot of the
times, we talk about the fact

00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:49.360
that we store multiple copies
across multiple physical

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:51.980
locations in case the data
center over here

00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:53.280
gets hit by a meteor.

00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:55.150
We want to make sure that your
data's still available to you

00:24:55.150 --> 00:24:57.550
immediately because people
have an expectation.

00:24:57.550 --> 00:25:01.320
They go to look to show their
child's photo to someone else

00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:03.350
and it says, I'm sorry, your
data center's down for

00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:04.100
maintenance or something.

00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:06.210
That would be very awful.

00:25:06.210 --> 00:25:08.560
So I think there's a huge
pressure to that.

00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:14.230
But the one thing I tell anyone
that I talk to is

00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:17.070
please have multiple copies
of your data.

00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:20.090
If you have a copy in Google,
you should make a backup copy

00:25:20.090 --> 00:25:25.280
to have on a home server, or a
home laptop, or somewhere.

00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:28.580
Or take that copy and push
it up somewhere else.

00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:31.920
But you should always have
multiple copies of your data.

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:33.930
I can't tell you how many
stories I've heard from

00:25:33.930 --> 00:25:37.180
people, many of them my friends,
who have lost every

00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:38.850
picture of their kids.

00:25:38.850 --> 00:25:41.780
One of my friends lost every
picture of her son from birth

00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:44.420
to age three because it
was all in one laptop

00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:45.475
that she got stolen.

00:25:45.475 --> 00:25:45.750
LOUIS GRAY: Right.

00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:46.220
And what if [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:47.220
crashed or one got stolen?

00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:48.800
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Yeah, that
scares the heck out of me.

00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:49.680
It's horrifying.

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:50.690
LOUIS GRAY: Yeah.

00:25:50.690 --> 00:25:52.950
So pleasant.

00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:54.000
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: I'm
here to scare you.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.530
LOUIS GRAY: Every conversation
we're like, ooh, better make

00:25:55.530 --> 00:25:57.160
it happy at the end.

00:25:57.160 --> 00:26:00.210
So when we download this
data, what services

00:26:00.210 --> 00:26:01.470
let you import it?

00:26:01.470 --> 00:26:04.375
Sometimes we talk about is
Google the only company that

00:26:04.375 --> 00:26:05.490
can provide a service
like this.

00:26:05.490 --> 00:26:07.400
And we can answer that
question, as well.

00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:10.400
But if I take my data out of
Google, is it really easy to

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:13.580
get it into other places and
other equivalent networks.

00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:16.980
Do they have the ability to have
an import tool that's as

00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:17.930
good as our export?

00:26:17.930 --> 00:26:19.255
Or is it still a challenge?

00:26:19.255 --> 00:26:19.940
BRIAN FITZPATRICK:
I think it's a

00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:20.950
chicken in an egg issue.

00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:23.430
But I think if the data's not
available you're never going

00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:26.180
to get the import parts done.

00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:27.420
But there's some examples,
which are

00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:28.350
very easy, like photos.

00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:31.280
You pull out your photos and
you get a bunch of JPEGs or

00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:35.650
whatever the heck photo format
your photo was initially in.

00:26:35.650 --> 00:26:38.700
And it's easy to take those and
put them up anywhere else,

00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:39.480
I would say.

00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:41.790
In contacts, for example, the
contact import is very

00:26:41.790 --> 00:26:43.560
straightforward. vCards
and calendars are very

00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:46.890
straightforward with
iCal format.

00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:49.330
Documents, spreadsheets, word
processor documents,

00:26:49.330 --> 00:26:51.110
spreadsheets, and those
type of things.

00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:53.090
We give you a couple
of choices.

00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:54.880
If you want to stick with the
open formats, you can use the

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:56.210
open office formats.

00:26:56.210 --> 00:26:59.280
If you're working with folks who
use Microsoft Office, you

00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:02.990
can choose the Microsoft
Office formats.

00:27:02.990 --> 00:27:05.040
So those are the typical
easy examples.

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:09.360
It gets a little harder when
there's not a defined standard

00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:11.480
for moving data from one
system to another.

00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:12.940
For example, Blogger.

00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:14.780
There's no blog format.

00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:17.360
So what we do is we create
a simple atom feed.

00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:20.270
We've documented the
format publicly.

00:27:20.270 --> 00:27:22.000
We have created an open
source project.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.040
I believe it's called Google
Blog Converters, and you can

00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:27.910
find that on Google Code.

00:27:27.910 --> 00:27:29.680
And that is a reference
implementation that will

00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:32.900
translate our format into
WordPress, and TypePad, and

00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:35.170
maybe something else and back.

00:27:35.170 --> 00:27:36.465
And that's under the
Apache license.

00:27:36.465 --> 00:27:39.720
So any developer at any other
company can take that and say

00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:39.965
look at this.

00:27:39.965 --> 00:27:41.770
Say, oh, this is
how this works.

00:27:41.770 --> 00:27:44.940
This is how we parse this
document format.

00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:47.160
And this is how we can
put it in our format.

00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:49.460
So that's there and
that's available.

00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:52.470
I'm not sure who have made
use of it or not yet.

00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:55.040
But that is, I think, the
solution to dealing with

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:58.380
formats where there's no real
web standard for them.

00:27:58.380 --> 00:27:59.790
But we are using an
ad hoc standard to

00:27:59.790 --> 00:28:02.280
a simple XML container.

00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:04.830
LOUIS GRAY: And what are the
kind of services today that

00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:06.820
are supported by Data
Liberation Front?

00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:07.320
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Wow.

00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:09.210
Well, Takeout's got a
ton of stuff in it.

00:28:09.210 --> 00:28:11.840
I mean, we initially launched
with social services.

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:15.210
So it was photos, it was your
contacts, it was your circles,

00:28:15.210 --> 00:28:18.630
you're G+ stream, and probably
something else.

00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:21.760
And then, pretty quickly after
that, we added Google Voice.

00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:24.230
Then we added Google Drive,
which is Docs and

00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:25.890
spreadsheets.

00:28:25.890 --> 00:28:29.640
And we just continue to add
things to it over time.

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:33.500
So we've got YouTube and dozens
of other products.

00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:37.540
And we're still working
on adding a last few.

00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:40.189
So my team won't rest until
everything's in

00:28:40.189 --> 00:28:40.900
there, pretty much.

00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:41.690
LOUIS GRAY: Right.

00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:42.910
You got more to go.

00:28:42.910 --> 00:28:44.310
Now, you introduced
something as a

00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:45.660
little bit of a deviation.

00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:47.470
Earlier this year, you talked
about legacy account

00:28:47.470 --> 00:28:48.570
management.

00:28:48.570 --> 00:28:50.380
And for those who are
unfamiliar, we

00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:51.150
can talk about that.

00:28:51.150 --> 00:28:55.410
But that's, essentially, if your
account is closed or if

00:28:55.410 --> 00:28:58.620
you pass on, that your data
becomes available to someone

00:28:58.620 --> 00:28:59.920
who you've designated it to.

00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:00.530
Is that correct?

00:29:00.530 --> 00:29:01.480
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: That's
an inactivity manager.

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:03.090
Correct, yes.

00:29:03.090 --> 00:29:08.440
We worked with a team to provide
that if you don't

00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:10.280
login to Google for a specified
period of time--

00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:13.570
I think the minimum is three or
six months up to a year--

00:29:13.570 --> 00:29:17.990
you can say notify this person
and give them access to these

00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:23.880
pieces of my data as opposed to
leaving somebody your user

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:25.580
name and your password.

00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:28.210
This way you could just say, if
I don't log into Google for

00:29:28.210 --> 00:29:30.570
six months and something
happens, delete all my email

00:29:30.570 --> 00:29:32.420
but give all my photos
to so and so.

00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:33.050
LOUIS GRAY: Right.

00:29:33.050 --> 00:29:33.460
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Right.

00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:35.570
LOUIS GRAY: And that's another
way we're utilizing the same

00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:37.700
kind of back up, the same kind
of take out, and the same kind

00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:40.580
of open standards could be
reused for a new way to help

00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:41.360
the people out there.

00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:41.790
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Absolutely.

00:29:41.790 --> 00:29:44.960
In fact, that uses the same
exact sort of systems that

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:46.570
Takeout works on.

00:29:46.570 --> 00:29:47.490
LOUIS GRAY: Absolutely.

00:29:47.490 --> 00:29:50.630
So what else can you tell our
viewers when they take a look

00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:51.710
at Data Liberation Front?

00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:54.700
What should they be thinking
about when it comes to,

00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:56.500
either, putting their
data into a service

00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:57.240
or taking it out?

00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:58.720
You said there's, really,
three steps.

00:29:58.720 --> 00:29:59.510
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Well, yes.

00:29:59.510 --> 00:30:01.180
So there's three questions that
you should ask before

00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:06.640
using any software application
that's storing data for you.

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:08.490
And the first question, I think,
is the obvious one.

00:30:08.490 --> 00:30:10.990
It's can I get my data
out in open format?

00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:13.210
And that's, sort of,
like table stakes.

00:30:13.210 --> 00:30:16.000
If the answer to that is no,
then I'm out of here.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.660
Or if I do use your product, I'm
going to be very careful

00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:22.180
about what I put in it because
I know it's locked up.

00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:24.950
The second question is, what
does it cost me to get it out.

00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:28.490
And that answer should
always be nothing.

00:30:28.490 --> 00:30:30.970
So if it's a free service,
it should be free to

00:30:30.970 --> 00:30:31.770
get your data out.

00:30:31.770 --> 00:30:34.570
If your service costs $20 a
year or $50 a year, that

00:30:34.570 --> 00:30:37.270
should include export
of your data.

00:30:37.270 --> 00:30:38.660
And the third question,
I think, is more

00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:39.310
of the tricky one.

00:30:39.310 --> 00:30:43.220
It's how much of my time does
it take to get my data out?

00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:45.120
And the example I gave
here is photos.

00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:47.510
And this is where PR
often solved these

00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:48.750
problems in the past.

00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:49.930
Someone would say,
hey, can I get my

00:30:49.930 --> 00:30:51.600
photos out of this product.

00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:53.290
And the PR answers, well,
of course you can.

00:30:53.290 --> 00:30:55.780
This is open and it's free.

00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:57.450
And you, basically,
go to the photo.

00:30:57.450 --> 00:30:59.730
And you click Save download,
Save As, go to

00:30:59.730 --> 00:31:01.465
Desktop, and hit OK.

00:31:01.465 --> 00:31:03.130
LOUIS GRAY: 2,000 times.

00:31:03.130 --> 00:31:04.700
BRIAN FITZPATRICK:
Yeah 2,000 times.

00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:06.920
Or 5,000 or 10,000 times.

00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:08.830
So take a week off of work and
click your mouse button.

00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:11.200
LOUIS GRAY: Just do a
right-click, Save As, repeat

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:13.150
168,000 times, and you're
in a good spot.

00:31:13.150 --> 00:31:13.570
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: Right.

00:31:13.570 --> 00:31:17.970
So this is why you
should have--

00:31:17.970 --> 00:31:21.140
I just hate to say one click--
a minimal amount of numbers.

00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:23.906
The amount of data you have
shouldn't correspondent to the

00:31:23.906 --> 00:31:26.690
amount of time it takes you
to get that data out.

00:31:26.690 --> 00:31:28.160
So I think those are
the three things

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:29.250
that are most important.

00:31:29.250 --> 00:31:31.390
And those are the things that
I think about before I start

00:31:31.390 --> 00:31:35.690
using any online service because
often say, oh, this

00:31:35.690 --> 00:31:36.690
stuff doesn't matter to me.

00:31:36.690 --> 00:31:37.240
LOUIS GRAY: It's trivial.

00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:38.660
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: My stream
isn't important.

00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:39.140
It's trivial.

00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:40.350
My tweets aren't important.

00:31:40.350 --> 00:31:43.245
But the interesting thing is
that there's no way to know

00:31:43.245 --> 00:31:46.240
today what's important
in the future.

00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:49.390
I look back to the emails that
I wrote back in the mid '90s

00:31:49.390 --> 00:31:52.550
and I'm like, gosh,
these are dumb.

00:31:52.550 --> 00:31:56.220
But it's like it's really neat
because I found early emails

00:31:56.220 --> 00:31:59.060
that my wife and I said back and
forth when we were dating

00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:02.110
and early messages with some
of my friends from college.

00:32:02.110 --> 00:32:04.150
And it's messages with one
of my friends who died a

00:32:04.150 --> 00:32:05.250
couple years ago.

00:32:05.250 --> 00:32:08.680
And it's like, suddenly, this
stuff is valuable to me.

00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:10.800
If you'd ask me at the time,
I be like, oh, no.

00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:13.082
But I'm just a digital pack
rat, so I keep everything.

00:32:13.082 --> 00:32:13.430
LOUIS GRAY: Right.

00:32:13.430 --> 00:32:15.450
I think everybody has
a story like that.

00:32:15.450 --> 00:32:17.890
You talk about those types of
emails and it, kind of, jogged

00:32:17.890 --> 00:32:18.760
a memory with me.

00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:20.660
My wife and I were dating, and
we were trading emails

00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:21.690
constantly.

00:32:21.690 --> 00:32:25.030
And somehow in a blitz, I lost
several months worth of that.

00:32:25.030 --> 00:32:27.880
And so we go from dating, and
the next thing you know we're

00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:29.240
planning the wedding.

00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:30.500
I missed all the stuff
in between.

00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:31.870
I don't remember if I
said anything cool.

00:32:31.870 --> 00:32:32.670
Like, what was it?

00:32:32.670 --> 00:32:33.610
It's gone.

00:32:33.610 --> 00:32:34.080
[LAUGHING]

00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:35.340
LOUIS GRAY: Probably
nothing cool.

00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:38.030
But it would be good to have
that back some time.

00:32:38.030 --> 00:32:39.290
And I'm glad, at least,
we're doing this.

00:32:39.290 --> 00:32:41.050
So Fitz, thank you so much
for coming back in.

00:32:41.050 --> 00:32:41.400
BRIAN FITZPATRICK:
My pleasure.

00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:43.070
LOUIS GRAY: I definitely want
people who are curious about

00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:46.310
this to take a look at
dataliberation.org.

00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:47.300
dataliberation.org.

00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:48.440
It's still free to log in.

00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:49.830
Free to check it out.

And that is the Data
Liberation Front.

00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:54.320
So Fitz, I know we're going to
be back here tomorrow here in

00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:56.030
Mountain View before you
fly back to Chicago.

00:32:56.030 --> 00:32:57.645
BRIAN FITZPATRICK: One more
day and you throw me out.

00:32:57.645 --> 00:32:58.380
LOUIS GRAY: That's right.

00:32:58.380 --> 00:32:59.500
That's all we can get.

00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:01.200
But thank you very much for
checking in at Google

00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:01.930

I'm Louis Gray, and we'll
see you in the studio.
