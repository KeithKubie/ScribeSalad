00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.550
Hello I'm Daven Hiskey, you're watching the
Today I Found Out YouTube channel.

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:08.910
In the video today, we're looking at why book
copyright pages often have the numbers 1-10

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.570
written on them
The number line, or printer's key, often seen

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.109
on the copyright page of books is simply a
method of record-keeping that helps identify

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.019
the book's printing and, for some, year of
printing a specific book, which may or may

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:28.140
not be different than the original copyright
date listed elsewhere on the page.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.739
Common examples of these number lines are
as follows:

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:36.750
While different publishers use different conventions
for these number lines, generally speaking,

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.820
the smallest number in the line indicates
a books printing.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.781
So if 1 through 10 is at the bottom of the
page, it is a first printing; if the number

00:00:43.781 --> 00:00:47.691
one has been removed, so the number line is
2 through 10, it is a second printing; and

00:00:47.691 --> 00:00:48.691
so on.

00:00:48.691 --> 00:00:52.200
The reason they remove a number each time
instead of, say, just changing one number

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.690
has to do with the way publishers have historically
printed books.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.700
For instance, in offset printing, you can
relatively easily remove something from the

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.030
printing plate, but adding a number would
require creating a whole new plate.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.280
You might have also noticed sometimes number
lines are accompanied by the words First edition

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.640
but that does not necessarily mean it is the
first printing; for example, the numbers 3

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.420
through 10 accompanied by the text First Edition
would indicate the third printing of the first

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:18.420
edition.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.500
There may be many printings of an edition,
the latter of which may be defined as a single

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.820
"setting-up of type without substantial change."

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.420
So, if the author doesn't change the text
of the book (like text books authors frequently

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.250
do), and the pages all stay the same, then
if the publisher simply makes another round

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.720
of copies, it isn't a new edition, it's just
a new printing.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.469
If, however, the pages are substantially modified,
or the book is reformatted, such as for printing

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:45.520
in paperback, then the printings in this new
format will be a new edition.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.860
Note, though, that it may not be designated
as a second edition (or third or fourth),

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.659
and instead may be called a first paperback
edition, first US edition or Penguin Classics

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:55.780
first edition.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.630
Serious collectors typically consider these
last inferior to the cherished first edition,

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:01.630
first printing.

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.909
Depending on the publisher, the number line
might also indicate the year the printing

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:09.369
was done, as follows.

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.700
This reveals that this second printing was
done in 1990.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.830
Much like with the print run numbers, if the
book is printed again the following year,

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.200
the 90 would be removed, leaving the year
part of the string as 93 92 91.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.489
Moreover, if the publisher contracts with
an outside company to do the printing, that

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:30.730
company may be indicated in the number line
as well; in this example, the number line

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.709
shows Melissa's Printing Company was hired
to do a third printing in 2016.

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:40.310
In addition, some publishers prefer other
kinds of lines; for example, Anness Publishing

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:47.340
uses a number line that alternates its digits
as follows, and a second or fifth printing

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.349
from this publishing company would look like
this.

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:55.510
This particular schema is used to keep the
number line relatively centered over multiple

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:56.510
print runs.

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.270
Further demonstrating the lack of standardization
across publishers for the printer's key, the

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:05.370
publishing giant Random House has indicated
its first edition, first printing with the

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:12.989
words first edition but with a number line
that begins with 2 as follows; however, it

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:17.800
uses this same number, just without the words
first edition, to indicate a second printing.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.690
So I hoped you enjoyed this video, if you
did please do give it a like below and consider

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.980
sharing it with anyone you think might also
enjoy it.

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:23.980
It really helps us out a lot.

We’ve got some good perks there, including
perhaps the most requested thing on this channel-

Thanks for watching.
