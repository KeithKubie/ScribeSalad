00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.009
This episode of Dnews was proudly made possible
by the all-new 2015 Subaru Legacy.

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.040
It’s not just a sedan, it’s a Subaru.

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.070
You know those people who claim that they
actually ENJOY exercise?

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.190
Well it turns out, they may be right.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.180
Damnit.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:24.199
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and try as
we might, some of us just seem predisposed

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:25.679
to loving exercise.

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:29.570
You get addicted to the endorphins, they say
- and even though I personally can’t understand

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.370
what that’s like, it turns out there IS
a part of our brains dedicated to that - and

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.170
it may explain why some people are more motivated
to exercise than others.

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.580
Scientists at the Seattle Children’s Research
Institute have discovered a tiny region of

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:46.519
the brain in mice - called the dorsal medial
habenula - that controls their desire to exercise.

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:51.219
It’s also responsible for mood regulation
and motivation, but its similarity to a structure

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:56.110
in human brains - means it could lead to improved
treatments for depression, which typically

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.059
coincide with a lack of motivation.

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:01.910
The link between exercise and depression - has
been proven time and time again.

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:07.080
“Changes in physical activity and the inability
to enjoy rewarding or pleasurable experiences,

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.350
are two of the hallmarks of major depression”
- so it makes sense that exercise would be

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.150
one of the more effective treatments for it.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.490
But the brain pathways responsible for exercise
motivation haven’t been well understood

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.490
- until now.

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.500
For their study, a team of researchers examined
3 different groups of mice.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.050
The first group, was a control.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.469
The second group, was genetically engineered
to have their dorsal medial habenula blocked

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:33.729
- and the third group, were given the option
of hyperactivating their dorsal medial habenula,

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:35.009
using laser technology.

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.149
Sure enough, the second group, whose brain
region was blocked - were much more lethargic

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:40.390
than the control mice.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.530
Meaning even though they were physically capable
of running on their wheel - they just didn’t

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:45.530
want to.

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.780
On the flip side, the third group of mice
- had the option of either activating or suppressing

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.380
their dorsal medial habenula, by turning one
of two response wheels.

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.610
Turns out, mice strongly preferred activating
that area, as opposed to suppressing it.

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.560
And that signifies that this part of the brain
is strongly tied to rewarding behavior.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.789
It makes sense that the mice would choose
that option, too.

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:07.960
After all, nobody WANTS to be depressed or
lazy - it’s just something that happens.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.030
So you can imagine how useful a drug would
be, that specifically targets and activates

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.140
that area.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.140
Depression may be a well-understood disease,
but the treatments for it - are still lacking.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.239
So researchers hope that this discovery - can
help develop better therapies for people who

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:22.770
lack the motivation to help themselves.

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.160
What do you guys think?

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.830
Aside from the depression aspects, would you
take a drug that made you more motivated to

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:29.830
exercise?

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.840
Let us know your thoughts in the comments
below - and as always, thank you guys for

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:33.170
watching!
