INTERVIEWER: So this is the
"Indie Game, The Movie" panel.

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:09.950
And we have here Lisanne Pajot
and James Swirsky.

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.720
Or actually, [INAUDIBLE]
in Polish.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.050
So let's just kind of
kind of see what

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:16.560
the movie's all about.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:24.030
[BEGIN VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:25.860
TOMMY REFENES: I am determined
to make video games, and I

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.720
make video games
because I can.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.340
PHIL FISH: I mean, it's the sum
total of every expressive

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.010
medium of all times,
made interactive.

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.020
Like how is that not--

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.290
it's awesome.

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.250
EDMUND MCMILLEN: My whole career
has been me trying to

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.230
find new ways to communicate
with people, because I

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.120
desperately want to communicate
with people, but I

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.570
don't want the messy interaction
of having to make

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:47.930
friends and talk to
people, because I

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.460
probably don't like them.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:50.430
PHIL FISH: And it's
not just the game.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.190
Like, it's--

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.460
I'm so closely attached to it,
this is my identity, is "FEZ."

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.590
I'm Guy Making "FEZ."
That's about it.

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.010
JONATHAN BLOW: Making it was
about, let me take my deepest

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.960
flaws and vulnerabilities and
put them in the game.

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.520
PHIL FISH: I'm on the line.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.900
Me.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.000
Like my name, my career.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.706
If this fails, I don't think
I'll work in games again.

00:01:48.706 --> 00:01:51.450
EDMUND MCMILLEN: I'm like in a
fucking concentration camp.

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.910
If you can't get the work done,
then the past two years

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.520
are basically worth nothing.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.760
No pressure.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.080
PHIL FISH: All we've
been doing for four

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.150
years, is look at this.

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:04.980
Like this close.

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:05.970
Like--

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:07.070
you can't see anything else.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.130
You don't even see the mistakes
in it anymore.

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:20.320
TOMMY REFENES: What
the fuck is that?

00:02:23.046 --> 00:02:25.034
[SHOUTS AND LAUGHS]

00:02:39.944 --> 00:02:41.194
PHIL FISH: Damn it!

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:57.940
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:58.670
INTERVIEWER: Cool.

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.320
So I'm curious, first of all--

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.270
so I love the movie.

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:05.460
I've watched it three
times by now.

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.550
And every time, I kind of
want to do something.

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.440
First time, I decided I should
make a documentary, because

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.630
it's apparently very easy, and
we're going to hear about it.

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.630
The second one, I wanted
to write an indie game.

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.630
And the third time, I haven't
really processed it yet,

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:21.680
because it was two days ago.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:22.820
But we'll see.

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.580
But I'm curious, well, first of
all, how did it all start?

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.720
How did you get the idea?

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:30.782
JAMES SWIRSKY: Cool.

00:03:30.782 --> 00:03:32.870
It all kind of started with--

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.320
prior to doing the movie,
we had a kind of

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:39.380
commercial/corporate video gig,
and we kind of worked on

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.600
that for about the last
seven years or so.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.430
And we actually got hired by the
Canadian government to do

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.170
a series of profiles on
Winnipeg tech stories.

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.900
And one of them was on this guy
Alec Holowka, who along

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.430
with Derek Yu made this great
game called "Aquaria" that won

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.370
the biggest prize you could
possibly win in independent

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.430
gaming back in 2007, I think.

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.740
And we got tasked with making
this short, little five-minute

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:04.430
piece on it.

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:05.900
And we thought it was
going to be this

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.290
kind of, fluffy, light--

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:09.190
look, I made a game.

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.810
Isn't that cool?

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:10.630
Type of video.

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.600
And ultimately, we did
make that video.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.650
But the process of making that
video and talking to Alec, the

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.079
story was just so much more.

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.510
It was kind of this story about
this guy who thought he

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.680
was making one game, and then
ended up with this completely

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.850
different game that reflected
all this stuff that he was

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:26.810
going through this life
while making the game.

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.590
It became darker and
more emotional.

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.090
It was just, his experience
making the game was completely

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:32.270
tied to the game itself.

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:37.350
And so it was this whole idea
of games being used as story

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.080
or expression that
was new to us.

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.480
It was not a new idea, but it
was kind of something new to

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.160
us, like seeing someone in
their own game so much.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.200
And then shortly after that,
we went down to the Game

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.630
Developers Conference, which
we had been going to for

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:51.280
various reasons for
a couple of years.

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.320
And we were hanging around the
Independent Games Summit.

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.510
And we just kept on hearing
story after story of very

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:57.380
similar things.

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.170
Like people pouring everything
they had into their game, and

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:02.600
these really dramatic
dev cycles.

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.310
And we thought to ourselves, if
we can get that in a movie,

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.510
if we can get that on tape, or
just even a semblance of that,

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.580
that's something that we
would love to watch.

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.470
And then we kind of looked
around for video-game design

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.850
documentaries, and there
were hardly any.

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:18.940
There were very few.

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.190
I think "Get Lamp," by Jason
Scott, was the only one I

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:22.100
could find.

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.730
And we thought, this
needs to exist.

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:26.400
Why hasn't someone
told this story?

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.320
There needs to be a "Helvetica"
or "Objectified"

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:29.440
of video games.

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.490
And we set out kind of with
the idea of making that.

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.940
In the end, we made something
quite different.

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:40.010
But that was kind of our first
impetus of it, is Alec leading

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:43.150
to GDC, leading to something
needs to exist--

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:44.850
let's make it.

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:50.860
INTERVIEWER: And as far as I
remember, your original idea

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:53.050
for the movie-- and you actually
had a cut of some

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:57.710
sort that turned out to be
something completely different

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:00.340
than what we can see today.

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:03.880
So was it kind of the same story
for you, that you made a

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.776
movie and then you realized
you'd have to remake it again,

00:06:06.776 --> 00:06:09.110
just to say something
different.

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.780
LISANNE PAJOT: Yeah.

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:13.520
We started out interviewing lots
of different developers.

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.420
Because we really didn't know
where this land, or we didn't

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:17.560
really know what it was.

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.100
We knew that it was going to be
a film about indie games,

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:22.650
and so we called it "Indie
Game, The Movie" on,

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:24.370
like, the first day.

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:25.100
JAMES SWIRSKY: It was
a working title.

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:26.040
LISANNE PAJOT: It was
just this project.

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:29.220
And yeah, so we thought the film
would involve a lot more

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:31.230
developers, and we interviewed
a lot of people.

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:33.310
But throughout the process, we
ended up spending more and

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:37.603
more time with the creators of
the three main game, "Super

00:06:37.603 --> 00:06:39.220
Meat Boy," "Fez," and "Braid."

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:41.490
And the way we met these people
were, we were like,

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:43.660
hey, Alec, who should
we talk to?

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:45.010
And that's sort of
how it started.

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:47.490
And we started reaching out to
people and talking to people

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:50.330
that were in the process of
making games, but a lot had

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:52.500
already made their games.

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:55.990
And we thought the film would be
this sort of marriage of a

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:58.470
story, like, someone making and
releasing a game, and then

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:00.710
in between, you'd jump off to
all these different people

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:03.420
that had made games and you'd
find out more about them, and

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:04.270
more about the process.

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:06.695
But it just turned into more
of a journey film following

00:07:06.695 --> 00:07:07.500
these three games.

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:08.180
So it was very different.

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:11.260
Our first cut of the film was
about three hours long and

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:12.450
really awful.

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:14.280
It just wasn't a good movie.

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:15.270
INTERVIEWER: Are you
going to include it

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:16.540
on the DVD or Blu-ray?

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:17.380
LISANNE PAJOT: Yeah, we're
going to cut it

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:20.300
apart and make it better.

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:20.760
JAMES SWIRSKY: Make it
more digestible.

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:22.890
LISANNE PAJOT: On the
special edition.

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:26.460
But yeah, no, the project
really sort of morphed.

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:29.020
We were discovering what the
movie was throughout.

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:31.640
The first thing that we had done
was we actually went down

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:34.630
to Santa Cruz, where we're
staying right now, and we

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:38.610
filmed with Edmund and Tommy
from "Super Meat Boy."

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:42.130
And we shot this little piece
and we put it up on the web in

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:43.840
May 2010, on Kickstarter.

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:46.070
And this was early days
for Kickstarter.

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:47.290
Not many people were using it.

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:51.100
And we made our goal, which was
a modest goal of $15,000

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:53.060
in less than two days.

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:55.160
And to us, that was
a huge thing.

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.960
It was a life-changing moment
to have all these people

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:01.780
around the world, like 300
people, decide that they

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:03.046
wanted to support this film.

00:08:03.046 --> 00:08:06.690
And it sounds small, but to
us as two filmmakers from

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:08.980
Winnipeg, it was huge.

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:11.516
And that's what made
us decide to--

00:08:11.516 --> 00:08:13.010
it sounds kind of silly now.

00:08:13.010 --> 00:08:17.220
It made us decide to give up our
work and take this on it

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:19.170
as a goal for the next year.

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:21.100
We thought it would take a
year to make the film.

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:23.920
It ended up taking two years.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:27.550
INTERVIEWER: So Kickstarter
was one of the kind of

00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:32.940
interesting aspects of
your project, right?

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:35.669
And you were really, really open
about the whole process

00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:37.450
throughout the making
of the movie.

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:43.329
You, I think, posted 90 minutes
worth of video as you

00:08:43.329 --> 00:08:44.540
were working on it.

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:47.340
Which by then, like, why would
you ever watch the movie, if

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:49.890
you already saw 90 minutes
of video, right?

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:50.630
JAMES SWIRSKY: That's what
a lot of film people

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:51.270
were saying to us.

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:51.960
They're like, oh, you're
giving away

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:52.980
all your DVD extras.

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:54.420
What are you doing?

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:55.660
LISANNE PAJOT: Yeah,
it was 90 minutes.

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:57.690
But only five minutes are
actually in the movie.

00:08:57.690 --> 00:08:59.070
So it was all extras.

00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:00.770
Yeah, it's kind of a problem.

00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:02.850
Yeah, we could make about
20 movies out of

00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:03.575
the footage we recorded.

00:09:03.575 --> 00:09:04.870
We still have--

00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:06.045
we shot 300 hours.

00:09:06.045 --> 00:09:07.210
It was kind of silly.

00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:08.600
Like we just kept shooting.

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:09.730
We're still shooting.

00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:11.800
JAMES SWIRSKY: Yeah,
yeah, yeah.

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:15.380
But in a good way, I think,
as we discovered the movie

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:16.760
through that process.

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:20.540
We're finding, with
documentaries, it's really

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:21.920
easy to call it wasted effort.

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:24.950
We've done and edited and shot
so many things that just

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:26.240
ultimately wasn't right
for the movie.

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:29.680
But you have to kind of explore
those stories and

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:31.980
those characters and see if
those techniques work.

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:35.960
And yeah, it's weird when you
look at all the stuff that

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:37.000
didn't make it into the movie.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.130
It's a whole bunch of
expended effort.

00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:42.610
But I think it made for
a better movie.

00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:43.800
LISANNE PAJOT: Yeah.

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:45.170
So we did share a lot.

00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:47.200
So we put out all these little
pieces of things that were,

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.370
like, oh, this won't make
it in the movie.

00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:51.510
Let's just cut something from
the hotel where we're shooting

00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:53.310
and put it up on the internet.

00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:55.440
And we just wanted to share as
much as we could, because we

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:57.350
felt this immense amount
of responsibility

00:09:57.350 --> 00:09:59.060
to these 300 people.

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:01.330
And then that's community
grew over the course

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:03.310
of making the film.

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:06.370
And that's really what gave us
a lot of confidence to move

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:10.260
forward, and be like, yeah,
this is a good idea.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.590
JAMES SWIRSKY: We were also
really inspired by what indie

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:15.790
game developers themselves were
doing at the time, like

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:18.640
doing things like pre-orders and
open betas and just being

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:21.160
really painfully honest about
where their game's at and

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:22.390
where their game's heading.

00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:26.130
And we saw all these great
examples of people building up

00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:28.440
their audiences even before
their game was released, even

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.860
a long time before their
game was released.

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:34.160
And that kept the audience
engaged and kept them engaged,

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:36.840
and I just really liked the idea
of working that way, of

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:39.660
kind of sharing about the movie
as we're making it.

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:43.390
And so we embraced that
wholeheartedly, and put out

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:45.060
all this content and let people
know where we were

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:46.030
going with it.

00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:48.410
And it had, for the
most, I think,

00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:49.970
really positive effects.

00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:52.410
It got people excited and we hit
the ground running when it

00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:53.910
came time, to June.

00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:56.310
We didn't have to bring a whole
bunch of people up to

00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:58.610
speed as to what we were doing,
and I think we probably

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:00.840
saved a lot of marketing
dollars that way.

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:05.540
It does have this weird effect
of enhancing this weird time

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:07.370
warp that happens on the
internet when you're kind of

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:10.560
paying attention to something
for a long time.

00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:12.590
You know, if you watch something
on the internet for

00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:15.910
like a year, it seems like three
years or four years.

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:18.920
And there's a weird kind
of dog-year phenomenon.

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:21.990
So people, even though they had
only been paying attention

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:23.680
for eight months, it felt
like three years.

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:26.530
So doing it again, we'd probably
manage it a little

00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:26.920
bit different.

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:29.300
But not too, too different.

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:32.550
INTERVIEWER: And so what
happened afterwards?

00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:35.490
I think you had another
Kickstarter campaign.

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:37.760
And then all sorts of wonderful

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:39.730
things started happening.

00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:43.390
I remember you had a blog post
eventually chronicling the

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:48.110
timeline of the movie, and it's
just amazing, trying to

00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:50.860
just read that, what kind of
things happened afterwards.

00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:53.330
So I was curious if you
can recap that for us.

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:55.240
LISANNE PAJOT: Yeah.

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:57.300
When you're work on a project
like this, it's all-consuming,

00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:58.910
and it was really all-consuming
to us.

00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:01.500
But when we looked back at the
timeline, there was something

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:04.440
significant that happened,
like, every two weeks.

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:05.690
Which-- we're kind of tired.

00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:09.890
But we did another Kickstarter
campaign because the film had

00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:11.370
transformed into something
different.

00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:13.980
We felt like at first it would
be this film that we would put

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:16.650
out on the internet and
people would like, and

00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:17.270
that would be that.

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:19.660
But then it sort of grew into
something that we could see as

00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:21.850
a theatrical film, that we
could put in theaters.

00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:24.900
And it had a story and it
was tense and emotional.

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:27.310
And so we needed a bit more
money to finish it.

00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:31.305
Because basically, $23,000 was
our budget and just our time.

00:12:31.305 --> 00:12:34.090
James and I did all the shooting
and the editing and

00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:34.960
all the stuff ourselves.

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:36.870
So it was just time
that we needed.

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:38.580
But at that point, we
had to bring on--

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:41.210
we brought on a composer and
we did do some color

00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:42.320
correction and things
like that.

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:45.290
So we appealed to the community
again, and by this

00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:47.520
time, there was more people
following the project.

00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:51.690
INTERVIEWER: This is
the second page.

00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:52.200
LISANNE PAJOT: Yeah.

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:53.830
And then we made
that in a day.

00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:56.030
And so that--

00:12:56.030 --> 00:12:57.700
that was shocking.

00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:00.286
INTERVIEWER: So you should have
gone with a third one and

00:13:00.286 --> 00:13:01.283
a fourth one.

00:13:01.283 --> 00:13:03.010
LISANNE PAJOT: Yeah, just
keep delaying it.

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:09.010
No, but that was an awesome vote
of confidence, again, and

00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:11.430
made us feel really good, and
gave us enough money to pay a

00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:15.560
composer and finish the movie.

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:18.760
INTERVIEWER: So the soundtrack
is about the only thing you

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:21.930
were not really responsible
for yourselves, right?

00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:24.690
LISANNE PAJOT: Yeah, and the 5.1
mixing, we got a company

00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:25.620
to do that.

00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:27.370
INTERVIEWER: And there was also
an interesting kind of

00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:29.540
indie game-ish story, right?

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:30.940
Finding the composer.

00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:31.440
JAMES SWIRSKY: Oh, yeah.

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:31.740
Yeah.

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:33.930
Basically when we were kind of
making the movie and editing

00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:37.370
it, I was playing this game,
"Sword &amp; Sorcery" by Capybara,

00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:39.470
a Super Brothers game.

00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:42.810
And the music in that
game is amazing.

00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:45.450
It's done by a guy, Jim Guthrie,
who's also Canadian.

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:48.950
And we kind of kept on going
back and forth, because we

00:13:48.950 --> 00:13:51.640
were scoring the movie
with temp music--

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:52.930
LISANNE PAJOT: With "The
Social Network."

00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:53.300
JAMES SWIRSKY: Yeah.

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:53.540
Yeah.

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:58.190
And we'd never worked with a
composer before, so we didn't

00:13:58.190 --> 00:14:00.670
really know how to
go about this.

00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:05.350
And so we thought, wouldn't it
be amazing if the guy who did

00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:07.970
this game, Jim Guthrie,
if he did our music?

00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:10.610
So we shot him an email,
thinking that there's no way

00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:11.180
he's going to do this.

00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:12.860
Because he's actually a
rock star in Canada.

00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:14.910
LISANNE PAJOT: He has
the equivalent

00:14:14.910 --> 00:14:16.150
of a Grammy in Canada.

00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:17.070
JAMES SWIRSKY: A Juno.

00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:17.450
LISANNE PAJOT: Yeah.

00:14:17.450 --> 00:14:19.990
So we were just, like, uh, he's
never going to reply.

00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:21.220
Let's just email him anyway.

00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:24.320
And within like 10 hours, he
said yeah, let's do it.

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:26.860
And he had watched the
first cut the film.

00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:29.060
INTERVIEWER: We actually have
his email right here.

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:30.750
JAMES SWIRSKY: Yeah.

00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:32.480
INTERVIEWER: Because at
Google, we kind of--

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:34.628
no, you had it on your
[INAUDIBLE].

00:14:34.628 --> 00:14:38.480
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:39.210
JAMES SWIRSKY: Yeah.

00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:42.700
This was the very first feedback
we got from a rough

00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:43.160
cut of the film.

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:46.080
Not the three-hour cut, but this
was the first time anyone

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:47.560
had seen it.

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:50.110
And this was huge for us.

00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:53.660
Not only was it the first time
we got positive feedback, and

00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:57.650
it had fucks and everything--
like he was excited.

00:14:57.650 --> 00:14:58.970
And yeah--

00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:00.220
INTERVIEWER: That's how you
know it's true, right?

00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:01.660
JAMES SWIRSKY: Yeah, completely,
because there's

00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:03.950
four exclamation points.

00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:04.380
Yeah.

00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:06.550
And so it was amazing.

00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:08.620
Not only that, but it was the
guy that we really, really,

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:10.480
really wanted to work with.

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:12.550
And then from there, he just
started making music.

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:16.000
And he made all the music for
the movie in about two months,

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.760
maybe even a little
less than that.

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:18.490
LISANNE PAJOT: Like
five weeks.

00:15:18.490 --> 00:15:20.050
JAMES SWIRSKY: It was a crazy
crunch, 'cause we were.

00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:20.460
LISANNE PAJOT: He did
80 minutes of new

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:21.450
music in five weeks.

00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:22.420
He works crazy.

00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:23.210
He doesn't really sleep.

00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:24.700
He only sleeps four
hours a day.

00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:26.570
So it worked out for us.

00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:29.000
JAMES SWIRSKY: And everything
he gave us was just perfect

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.300
and fantastic and took the
movie in places we didn't

00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:31.970
think it would.

00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:34.820
And it was like a dream
experience with a composer.

00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:38.220
LISANNE PAJOT: Now it's out
as an album online.

00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:38.930
jimguthrie.org.

00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:39.640
JAMES SWIRSKY: Jim
Guthrie, yeah.

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:40.200
Look it up.

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:43.580
INTERVIEWER: So what happened
afterwards?

00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:48.920
JAMES SWIRSKY: At that point,
it was turning into this

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:52.030
thing, and Jim's music was
making it so much better.

00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:54.000
LISANNE PAJOT: We applied for
some festivals and we were

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.600
working up towards a
festival deadline.

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:58.210
And we thought if we got into
any sort of film festival--

00:15:58.210 --> 00:15:59.940
which really wasn't our
plan initially--

00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:02.140
we'd get into a Canadian one.

00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:05.920
Then we got rejected,
which really sucked.

00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:06.950
JAMES SWIRSKY: Because we
thought, if we're going to get

00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:09.300
into any upper-tier festival,
it'd be a Canadian one,

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:11.630
because they have home court
advantage and they have to

00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:12.980
show so many Canadian films.

00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:15.790
And so hopefully we're one
of the top five Canadian

00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:16.760
documentaries that year.

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:17.540
And we weren't.

00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:19.740
LISANNE PAJOT: We applied to two
festivals and we got into

00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:21.570
one, but we didn't get
into the big one.

00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:23.720
And so we were a little
disappointed.

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:27.710
But then a few weeks later, we
found out that we got into

00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:29.840
Sundance, which sort of
changed everything.

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:32.900
Which was just such
a huge thing.

00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:37.570
We just never thought that
this little film--

00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:39.460
in our plan, you write
down your plan--

00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:40.910
OK, make the movie,
get the great

00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:42.210
composer, then go to Sundance.

00:16:42.210 --> 00:16:43.090
JAMES SWIRSKY: Premiere
at Sundance.

00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:44.210
LISANNE PAJOT: You don't
write that down.

00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:44.950
JAMES SWIRSKY: Yeah.

00:16:44.950 --> 00:16:47.840
LISANNE PAJOT: So that was sort
of a big thing for us.

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:51.220
INTERVIEWER: And that, you also
did something interesting

00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:54.390
with distribution, right?

00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:56.100
JAMES SWIRSKY: Yeah.

00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:58.860
We went to Sundance and--

00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:03.010
the whole process of making this
movie, we treated it very

00:17:03.010 --> 00:17:04.380
pragmatic and very practical.

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:08.069
And we had our idea of DIY
distribution, like what would

00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:10.140
happen if we got no distribution
deal or

00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:11.099
anything like that.

00:17:11.099 --> 00:17:13.319
We would go, we'll take it out
on tour, and then we'll

00:17:13.319 --> 00:17:16.955
release it ourselves where we
can, and then we'll distribute

00:17:16.955 --> 00:17:18.150
it online, and all this stuff.

00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:20.710
So we had this really
base plan of what we

00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:22.099
wanted to do ourselves.

00:17:22.099 --> 00:17:25.170
And then once we got into
Sundance, things changed, and

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:28.530
they changed really quickly
and really dramatically.

00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:30.580
But at the same time, they
didn't change for us.

00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:34.640
But we got 1,000 emails that day
it was announced we were

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:35.420
in Sundance.

00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:38.010
And then the next day, we got
like 800 emails, and then 600.

00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:41.260
And it was just this crazy
overwhelming crush of

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:44.440
opportunity that you have
to kind of sift through.

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:46.660
And we went into Sundance
thinking, OK, well, let's

00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:48.570
listen to absolutely
everything.

00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:52.930
We have ideas of what we can do
and what would be good, but

00:17:52.930 --> 00:17:53.890
we're new to everything.

00:17:53.890 --> 00:17:56.575
So we thought, let's embrace
traditional distribution where

00:17:56.575 --> 00:18:00.210
it makes sense, and do
what we want where it

00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:01.690
doesn't make sense.

00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:03.720
LISANNE PAJOT: So generally,
when people go to a big

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:06.320
festival like Sundance or
Cannes or the Toronto

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:08.720
International Film Festival, is
you go there and you show

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:11.610
your movie, and then you have
a sales agent who's like a

00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:14.800
real estate agent, and then they
try to get all the buyers

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:17.010
really excited about your movie
and try to get them to

00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:18.780
bid against each other so
they'll give you like a

00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:20.940
million dollars in one night.

00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:23.820
Well, that didn't
really happen.

00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:26.280
And we weren't really
banking on it.

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:28.680
But we did get lots of interest,
and the film ended

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:32.140
up being optioned by HBO and
Scott Rudin to make into TV

00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:35.320
series, a fictional TV series,
which was kind of insane.

00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:37.170
Scott Rudin happens to be the
producer of "The Social

00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:39.750
Network," which is bizarre.

00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:41.240
INTERVIEWER: Karma for using
their score, right?

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:42.270
LISANNE PAJOT: I know.

00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:44.510
As temp music.

00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:48.360
And we got lots of offers and
lots of excitement, and we did

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:51.490
lots of interviews with, like,
German "Glamour." It was just

00:18:51.490 --> 00:18:54.410
very weird.

00:18:54.410 --> 00:18:57.165
But then we decided we didn't
want to sell it.

00:18:57.165 --> 00:18:58.330
There wasn't--

00:18:58.330 --> 00:19:01.245
everybody was saying that the
film wouldn't be able to come

00:19:01.245 --> 00:19:04.970
out until the fall, and they'd
push it out theatrically, and

00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:06.510
then they'd control
the digital.

00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:09.400
And our worry was we had, at
this point, about 10,000

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:12.500
people that had pre-ordered
the movie, from

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:13.620
all over the world.

00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:15.620
And so our concern was if we
put it out traditionally,

00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:17.370
people wouldn't receive
it at the same time.

00:19:17.370 --> 00:19:18.490
Because generally,

00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:20.230
distribution happens per territory.

00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:22.930
We were just learning
all this stuff.

00:19:22.930 --> 00:19:25.320
And so we decided not to sell
it, and do it ourselves.

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:27.030
So we took the film
out on tour.

00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:31.150
We did a tour across the States
with a partner, Adobe.

00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:34.320
And then it went in theaters
in twelve centers, which we

00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:36.580
booked ourselves, and
37 in Canada.

00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:42.800
And then we put it out online
ourselves, on iTunes, Steam--

00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:43.930
a big gaming platform--

00:19:43.930 --> 00:19:46.320
and our own website, on
June 12 worldwide.

00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:47.530
And that hadn't really
been done before

00:19:47.530 --> 00:19:49.300
for a feature film.

00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:51.390
And luckily, it worked out.

00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:52.640
It was kind of stressful.

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:54.680
INTERVIEWER: Was this actually
the first movie on Steam?

00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:56.240
LISANNE PAJOT: Yeah.

00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:56.660
JAMES SWIRSKY: Yeah.

00:19:56.660 --> 00:19:59.440
There was a short movie made by
couple Valve employees that

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:01.360
happened, I think, six
years ago or so.

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:04.550
But this is the first feature
film on Steam.

00:20:04.550 --> 00:20:05.780
And it's been great.

00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:07.560
It's absolutely the perfect
place for it.

00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:10.750
It's sitting right next to
"Super Meat Boy" and "Braid"

00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:13.664
and "World of Goo." And yeah,
it's just perfect.

00:20:13.664 --> 00:20:15.940
LISANNE PAJOT: Through the
distribution part.

00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:19.270
INTERVIEWER: And I guess
that brings us to--

00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:21.680
what was the reaction from
people watching?

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:25.340
Because the interesting part
about this movie is that as

00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:28.220
you mentioned, you could have
done it a number of different

00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:28.590
ways, right?

00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:30.730
You could have focused on the
technology or the history of

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:36.200
indie games, or like 15
different developers just kind

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:37.970
of chatting randomly.

00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:42.030
And you decided to tell,
essentially, two, three

00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:45.755
stories of three different
games, but not as much games

00:20:45.755 --> 00:20:47.760
as people behind those
games, right?

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:55.780
And was this something that
surprised people who were

00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:57.040
expecting something else?

00:20:57.040 --> 00:21:00.040
And did you get different
reactions from people who

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:04.940
maybe are not gamers, and then
all of these hard-core people

00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:08.570
who'd played all these games
before and they were like, we

00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:10.504
wanted to know more about those
games, rather than about

00:21:10.504 --> 00:21:11.960
the people?

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:12.640
LISANNE PAJOT: Yeah.

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:13.280
Yeah.

00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:16.330
I think the film ended up
turning into something really

00:21:16.330 --> 00:21:20.800
strong, in part because we
focused on it, but also the

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:23.600
guys that we focused on in the
film are really generous with

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:24.600
their thoughts.

00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:27.760
And they were really generous
with us and with the audience,

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:29.900
in terms of how vulnerable
they are at times.

00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:32.970
Like, it's a stressful movie.

00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:35.200
We were filming people at the
most stressful points in their

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:38.580
lives, and little did we know
it would get so stressful.

00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:41.290
And I think people bizarrely
connect with that.

00:21:41.290 --> 00:21:45.440
And so no matter whether you're
a gamer or you're--

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:47.140
that--

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:49.350
he's a little stressed there.

00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:50.600
INTERVIEWER: We have more.

00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:53.760
LISANNE PAJOT: No matter whether
you're a gamer or a

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:57.340
developer or just a maker, we
related to it, so we hoped

00:21:57.340 --> 00:21:58.730
other people would
relate to it to.

00:21:58.730 --> 00:22:00.330
And people really connect with
their stories because they

00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:03.620
share so much, and they're so
much themselves in the film,

00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:06.930
in these sort of super
intense moments.

00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:10.560
And so it sort of transcended
beyond just people that were

00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:11.120
into gaming.

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:13.800
And we wanted that, but
we were really sort of

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:15.120
surprised by that.

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:17.840
JAMES SWIRSKY: And every
screening, there's always--

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:19.180
we do Q&amp;As and stuff
like that.

00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:20.350
There's always someone--

00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:25.080
it's usually like a woman in
her '40s or '50s that was

00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:27.010
brought there by a son or just
kind of brought there because

00:22:27.010 --> 00:22:28.510
she likes documentaries
or something.

00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:30.540
But she'll ask a question,
but the

00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:32.180
question's more like a statement.

00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:33.760
And she's just--

00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:35.470
and we've gotten this
four or five times.

00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:39.000
And it's always something to
the effect of, you know, I

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.290
don't play games, I don't like
games, I never picked up a

00:22:41.290 --> 00:22:46.260
controller, but games are
kind of like art, right?

00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:49.890
And it was like this
revelation to her.

00:22:49.890 --> 00:22:54.460
And that's this kind of dream
reaction that we can hope for.

00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:57.730
And we've gotten that over and
over again, just people that

00:22:57.730 --> 00:23:00.700
have never really thought about
games in this way-- and

00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:02.320
that's fine, because it's
not part of their lives.

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:05.210
There's no reason for them to
really consider games as

00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:07.880
something more than just these
little playthings.

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:12.570
But when we do get those people
into the theater and

00:23:12.570 --> 00:23:16.020
they do actually change their
opinion of games in some

00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:17.100
little way--

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:18.540
they're not going out and
buying an Xbox or

00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:19.120
anything like that.

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:21.730
But it's just that they're a
little more thoughtful towards

00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:25.700
games, which is a huge victory,
an amazing victory.

00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:27.460
We got a lot of that.

00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:30.840
INTERVIEWER: Do you think
anybody who watched this movie

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:35.640
decided that they're going to
go indie, like, right now.

00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:36.080
LISANNE PAJOT: It's funny.

00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:39.120
We were talking about
this earlier.

00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:41.250
And I think a lot of programming
works this way--

00:23:41.250 --> 00:23:44.010
you see yourself, people
identify with certain

00:23:44.010 --> 00:23:46.930
characters in the film, or
read in what they want.

00:23:46.930 --> 00:23:48.600
It's sort of like a personality
test, in a way.

00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:51.410
So if you walk out of this film
thinking, oh yeah, I want

00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:52.710
to make a game, that
means that you're a

00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:53.930
little bit of an idealist.

00:23:53.930 --> 00:23:55.350
And that's wonderful.

00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:57.340
Or if you walk away and be like,
ugh, I don't want to

00:23:57.340 --> 00:24:00.330
become independent at all.

00:24:00.330 --> 00:24:02.330
People read into their
own things.

00:24:02.330 --> 00:24:04.190
So when we were on tour, we had
a lot of people come up.

00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:08.060
And in particular, we were
showing in Chicago and this

00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:11.720
girlfriend of a guy said, hey,
my boyfriend watched movie and

00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:15.310
he quit his job and he's
living with me now.

00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:17.695
JAMES SWIRSKY: So, thanks.

00:24:17.695 --> 00:24:19.225
LISANNE PAJOT: And he's
doing a Kickstarter.

00:24:19.225 --> 00:24:20.475
You should tweet about it.

00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:24.000
INTERVIEWER: Here's
your free DVD.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.240
Sorry.

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:27.140
LISANNE PAJOT: Sorry.

00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:27.440
Yeah.

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:32.890
So the reactions have been a lot
of wonderful things, and

00:24:32.890 --> 00:24:34.700
really beyond what
we ever thought.

00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:37.960
It's weird that 13-year-old,
12-year-old kids are watching

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:38.650
a documentary.

00:24:38.650 --> 00:24:42.360
We get a lot of emails from
kids saying that they are

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:44.350
really excited by this, or
they make a video of

00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:46.810
themselves on YouTube reviewing
it at 12 o'clock at

00:24:46.810 --> 00:24:50.750
night in their bedrooms so
their parents can't hear.

00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:54.720
It's bizarre to see the way that
the people in the film

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:56.700
have touched so many people.

00:24:56.700 --> 00:24:58.930
And it's about making games,
so it's kind of weird.

00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:04.770
INTERVIEWER: So let's open
it up for questions.

00:25:04.770 --> 00:25:07.910
I have the number
of them here.

00:25:07.910 --> 00:25:11.270
Crazy technology of people
asking remotely.

00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:16.260
But I wonder if anybody in the
audience has any questions.

00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:18.800
And I guess we should repeat the
question so I don't know

00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:20.560
if you want me to do that.

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:25.610
LISANNE PAJOT: So how did we
choose to characterize people?

00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:26.290
Hm.

00:25:26.290 --> 00:25:27.100
I don't know.

00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:31.550
I think we were capturing people
at an elevated time.

00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:35.510
So everything is a little more
high stakes than usual.

00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:37.860
I would say that all the people
in the film, in their

00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:41.460
day-to-day now, after this
experience has happened, are

00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:45.110
much more low-key versions
of themselves.

00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:45.410
JAMES SWIRSKY: Yeah.

00:25:45.410 --> 00:25:49.060
And actually Phil joined us for
a few Q&amp;As and was asked

00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:51.010
very similar questions.

00:25:51.010 --> 00:25:57.100
And he says, that's what I was
like then, in that moment.

00:25:57.100 --> 00:26:00.140
We literally were filming
these people at the most

00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:03.780
stressful periods of their
lives, and this

00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:05.350
kind of crazed thing.

00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:08.620
And a lot of people, I think,
go through similar periods,

00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:12.840
but there's never a camera crew
there and then asking you

00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:15.710
to talk through what's
going on your mind.

00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:21.020
And so it's a small segment of
their lives, which is where

00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:23.480
the story revolves around.

00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:30.410
But yeah, it's not completely,
absolutely the full picture.

00:26:30.410 --> 00:26:30.850
LISANNE PAJOT: Yeah.

00:26:30.850 --> 00:26:31.200
Yeah.

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:32.720
So we didn't get to add here.

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:34.490
So the game "Fez"
did come out.

00:26:34.490 --> 00:26:38.810
It came out on Friday the 13th
in April, and it did really

00:26:38.810 --> 00:26:41.820
well on Xbox.

00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:43.990
And Phil's doing great.

00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:44.800
He's in Montreal.

00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:46.880
He's creating lots of
new things now.

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:49.200
He has a girlfriend,
which is awesome.

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:55.210
And we did film an epilogue with
him, but we didn't get

00:26:55.210 --> 00:26:57.780
him when he was releasing the
game because we were already

00:26:57.780 --> 00:27:01.080
on tour with the film, which
killed us, because he was with

00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:03.220
his new girlfriend in Nashville
and we were in

00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:03.710
Chicago or something.

00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:05.230
JAMES SWIRSKY: I wanted
to be there so bad.

00:27:05.230 --> 00:27:05.710
Yeah.

00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:06.950
LISANNE PAJOT: So we
did film with him.

00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:09.380
We filmed with him in Montreal
after the game had actually

00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:10.980
finished in December.

00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:12.450
He finished in December.

00:27:12.450 --> 00:27:14.420
And then we caught up with him
at the Game Developers

00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:18.620
Conference this year, where you
won the top award, which

00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:20.990
was a big validation for him.

00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:23.720
So he won the Seamus McNally
award, which is the biggest

00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:25.170
award you can get in
independent gaming.

00:27:25.170 --> 00:27:28.330
So we followed him
through that day.

00:27:28.330 --> 00:27:29.950
JAMES SWIRSKY: Yeah.

00:27:29.950 --> 00:27:32.580
How it came about was like, we
always thought, wouldn't it be

00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:34.080
great if we were on Steam?

00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:37.230
And we actually introduced to
the Steam folks through Ron

00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:39.530
Carmel, "World of Goo," and
then also Edmund McMillen,

00:27:39.530 --> 00:27:40.970
who's in the movie.

00:27:40.970 --> 00:27:42.300
And they just kind
of hooked us up.

00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:44.140
And then it was about
eight months of

00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:45.590
arm-twisting, in a way.

00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:48.520
Like subtle arm-twisting.

00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:50.890
LISANNE PAJOT: Yeah, eventually
we flew down to

00:27:50.890 --> 00:27:54.710
Seattle, and we said, OK, we
know that you don't do with

00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:56.610
movies, but we'll make it
into an app so it's

00:27:56.610 --> 00:27:57.840
easy for your system.

00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:01.220
And it will be moderately
interactive, but not really.

00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:03.210
And we'll show it to you.

00:28:03.210 --> 00:28:05.960
So we went down and we showed
them, and they had a really

00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:06.920
great reaction to the film.

00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:09.850
And I think it's sort of
an experiment for them.

00:28:09.850 --> 00:28:12.640
Because what's interesting is if
you're on Steam, and let's

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:15.430
say, your friend is watching
"Indie Game, the Movie." It'll

00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:18.130
say, "Playing 'Indie Game, the
Movie.'" They're not set up

00:28:18.130 --> 00:28:19.140
for movies right now.

00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:20.780
This is sort of a
big exception.

00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:22.540
But it's been incredible.

00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:26.900
Steam has been the strongest
platform for this film,

00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:29.580
numbers-wise.

00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:31.650
And they're really merchandised
really well.

00:28:31.650 --> 00:28:34.370
They know how to do online sales
and all these things

00:28:34.370 --> 00:28:38.650
that the movies areas-- like,
we're on Amazon and all these

00:28:38.650 --> 00:28:40.410
different places-- they don't
do those things yet.

00:28:40.410 --> 00:28:45.510
These guys know how to
do sales and stuff.

00:28:45.510 --> 00:28:48.360
So we basically follow, in real
time, "Super Meat Boy."

00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:52.770
Oh, so the question was, why
are they all successes?

00:28:52.770 --> 00:28:53.980
JAMES SWIRSKY: Was
that planned?

00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:55.230
LISANNE PAJOT: Yeah,
was that planned?

00:28:55.230 --> 00:28:56.970
No.

00:28:56.970 --> 00:29:00.210
We filmed with a lot of
developers, but they were all

00:29:00.210 --> 00:29:03.110
interviews, and nobody was
in the moment developing.

00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:05.030
And the only two teams that were
in the moment developing

00:29:05.030 --> 00:29:06.980
that we followed were "Super
Meat Boy" and "Fez."

00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:08.956
When we caught up with Phil,
we weren't sure if he was

00:29:08.956 --> 00:29:11.080
going to finish at all.

00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:12.760
He was at a point
where he was--

00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:15.460
you see him halfway through the
movie saying, I don't know

00:29:15.460 --> 00:29:16.850
what I'm going to do.

00:29:16.850 --> 00:29:19.250
And nobody knew how well "Super
Meat Boy" would do.

00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:23.190
So it was really just by
chance that we started

00:29:23.190 --> 00:29:25.860
following them, that it ended
up being successful.

00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:28.180
JAMES SWIRSKY: Like "Super Meat
Boy" had buzz, and that's

00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:31.270
how they got on our radar,
and then we did

00:29:31.270 --> 00:29:32.710
our research on them.

00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:35.710
But they didn't have, like,
"you're going to sell million

00:29:35.710 --> 00:29:38.850
copies" buzz, and "be game of
the year" type of thing.

00:29:38.850 --> 00:29:42.420
And so when you see it, in the
movie, when all the reviews

00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:46.580
are rolling in, Edmund is
genuinely surprised at all

00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:47.080
these things.

00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:49.910
No one is hating this game.

00:29:49.910 --> 00:29:53.530
Like no one is saying horrible
things about it.

00:29:53.530 --> 00:29:55.860
And I guess he was
half-expecting that, but they

00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:59.450
were just these amazing,
huge successes.

00:29:59.450 --> 00:30:01.240
And of course, that's not
every indie game.

00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:05.000
We know that for sure, and we're
not trying to say that.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.890
But it's just the stories
of these games.

00:30:07.890 --> 00:30:08.910
Yeah.

00:30:08.910 --> 00:30:09.690
So it was kind of--

00:30:09.690 --> 00:30:11.130
LISANNE PAJOT: That we happened
to hook up with a

00:30:11.130 --> 00:30:13.560
year and a half before they
became successes.

00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:15.370
JAMES SWIRSKY: Yeah.

00:30:15.370 --> 00:30:17.060
LISANNE PAJOT: We
did interview--

00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:20.740
in terms of, we had a few
talking-head expert types.

00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:24.640
We did interview women, and
we got comments from them.

00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:27.660
But it just turns out that the
people that we talked to

00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:30.110
didn't say things that connected
in a way that we

00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:31.370
needed to explain
what we wanted.

00:30:31.370 --> 00:30:34.860
Like, we could have shoehorned
a woman into the film as an

00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:38.840
expert, just to have a woman,
but they didn't say the things

00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:39.980
that we needed them to say.

00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:40.830
JAMES SWIRSKY: And I think--

00:30:40.830 --> 00:30:43.690
at one point, it was going to
be this essay-type film with

00:30:43.690 --> 00:30:47.270
this narrative back-end, or
narrative arc, being the

00:30:47.270 --> 00:30:49.820
structure and then these little
vignettes happening.

00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:54.310
And we did capture woman
interviews for those pieces,

00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:57.170
but then as things evolved and
the stories of "Fez" and

00:30:57.170 --> 00:31:01.200
"Super Meat Boy" became these
more involved things that

00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:03.780
demanded more time in the film,
it pushed out all these

00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:05.590
vignette pieces that we thought
would be there.

00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:07.560
We thought we'd have about
five or six vignettes.

00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:09.400
LISANNE PAJOT: And the women
that we spoke to were talking

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:12.330
in past tense about the games
that they had made.

00:31:12.330 --> 00:31:14.100
So it didn't connect
into the story.

00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:18.890
It was more just a function
of story than it was any

00:31:18.890 --> 00:31:22.280
deliberate choice of having all
white men in the movie.

00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:23.910
JAMES SWIRSKY: Who are
making platformers.

00:31:23.910 --> 00:31:24.990
All white men making
platformers.

00:31:24.990 --> 00:31:25.900
LISANNE PAJOT: All making
platformers.

00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:27.020
That wasn't--

00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:28.570
INTERVIEWER: High concept
platformers.

00:31:28.570 --> 00:31:28.990
JAMES SWIRSKY: Yeah.

00:31:28.990 --> 00:31:29.910
LISANNE PAJOT: Yeah.

00:31:29.910 --> 00:31:30.340
Renault?

00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:30.840
Yeah.

00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:34.020
We did interview him,
and we included him.

00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:36.360
Yeah.

00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:39.590
There wasn't a specific
reason.

00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:41.500
He wasn't at PAX.

00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:46.820
So he was there during the
beginning of it, and we

00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:49.560
include a little bit from
that section, that trip.

00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:53.460
But he didn't appear at PAX
until the third day.

00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:56.620
And so that was sort of a
story problem as well.

00:31:56.620 --> 00:31:59.020
Because he didn't show up as
much later in the film and

00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:02.250
wasn't present later in the
film, we couldn't show more of

00:32:02.250 --> 00:32:03.720
him in the beginning of the
film, because you'd wonder

00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:04.660
where he was later.

00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:06.060
It's sort of a story thing.

00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:06.360
JAMES SWIRSKY: Yeah.

00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:09.340
And also one of the main theses
of the film is kind of

00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:10.890
games as personal expression.

00:32:10.890 --> 00:32:12.480
That's one of the sub-theses.

00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:15.400
And so we were really drawn to
people who are making games

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:17.150
that are a reflection
of themselves.

00:32:17.150 --> 00:32:21.140
And Phil, as the designer, kind
of spoke more to that.

00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:23.570
Renault definitely, obviously
has huge influence in the

00:32:23.570 --> 00:32:26.280
game, and his fingerprints
are all over that game.

00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:30.630
But it just felt more natural
for what we were pursuing to

00:32:30.630 --> 00:32:35.640
just concentrate on
those four guys.

00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:37.845
INTERVIEWER: On that note, did
you try to reach out to Phil

00:32:37.845 --> 00:32:42.580
Fish's partner, that's like all
pixelated a couple times,

00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:45.410
but no dialogue or monologue,
whatsoever.

00:32:45.410 --> 00:32:49.370
LISANNE PAJOT: That was a hugely
surprising storyline,

00:32:49.370 --> 00:32:53.570
sub-storyline, that happened.

00:32:53.570 --> 00:32:56.550
We arrived in Boston
thinking that--

00:32:56.550 --> 00:32:58.900
we knew Phil would be nervous
about showing the game for the

00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:02.600
first time in four years at PAX,
but we didn't know about

00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:04.230
that until we arrived.

00:33:04.230 --> 00:33:08.160
And it was sort of taking us by

00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:09.450
surprise, what was happening.

00:33:09.450 --> 00:33:12.080
JAMES SWIRSKY: Yeah, so we
filmed that lobby scene, and

00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:14.890
we thought it wouldn't end up
making it in the film, but we

00:33:14.890 --> 00:33:21.380
had to show it, because it ended
up completely clouding

00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:22.320
Phil's reaction to PAX.

00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:24.760
Like all of a sudden, you just
have this guy who's really

00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:27.320
depressed at PAX for no reason,
or just really, really

00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:29.250
super-stressed out and you
don't want know why.

00:33:29.250 --> 00:33:35.060
So we ended up including it, and
yeah, we tried to tell the

00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:38.280
story from the point of
view of the creators.

00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:40.060
You know, it's the story of
making "Fez" and what Phil's

00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:41.010
going through.

00:33:41.010 --> 00:33:45.430
And we thought if we went into
this dissolution of a

00:33:45.430 --> 00:33:49.330
partnership thing and told the
whole story of that, it would

00:33:49.330 --> 00:33:54.160
be this we off-branch and take
the movie into a place that is

00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:56.850
further removed from making
this game and pouring

00:33:56.850 --> 00:33:58.290
everything you have
into this game.

00:33:58.290 --> 00:34:00.310
So yeah, we didn't really
pursue that.

00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:01.630
No.

00:34:01.630 --> 00:34:04.500
I think it was the most
interesting aspect and

00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:07.230
surprising story about
post-release,

00:34:07.230 --> 00:34:08.900
that we came across.

00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:10.909
It was actually this
through-line of everyone who

00:34:10.909 --> 00:34:14.590
had these wonderful successes,
they go through this kind of

00:34:14.590 --> 00:34:17.270
postpartum depression
of sorts.

00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:20.610
And John's was the most dramatic
and surprising.

00:34:20.610 --> 00:34:24.409
And we thought that it kind of
dovetailed really nicely with

00:34:24.409 --> 00:34:27.449
the other two stories we were
pursuing, because with "Fez,"

00:34:27.449 --> 00:34:29.650
you have a game that's kind of
in development, and will they

00:34:29.650 --> 00:34:30.690
make it or won't they make it?

00:34:30.690 --> 00:34:33.820
With "Meat Boy," you have a game
that's fully developed

00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:35.070
and released, and so
you get to see

00:34:35.070 --> 00:34:37.040
that part of the process.

00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:41.760
And then with John, it fit
really nicely, thematically,

00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:45.040
to have what happens
after release.

00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:48.730
And so it predicts into the
future what's in store for

00:34:48.730 --> 00:34:50.650
Edmund and Tommy, in some way.

00:34:50.650 --> 00:34:53.190
Of course, it's a very extreme
example of that.

00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:59.700
But it just seemed like a great
take on that section of

00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:03.700
the process, and just dovetailed
quite nicely.

00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:07.410
And we think it shows a side
of John that is really

00:35:07.410 --> 00:35:07.950
surprising.

00:35:07.950 --> 00:35:10.520
Like, I think he has an internet
persona, and I hope

00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:12.620
this kind of goes against that
internet persona a little bit.

00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:15.160
That's a small, light
question.

00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:17.200
INTERVIEWER: The question is,
why do indie games matter?

00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:22.480
LISANNE PAJOT: What was
interesting to us about

00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:27.450
pursuing independent games was
that it was just people doing

00:35:27.450 --> 00:35:30.260
something different with a
medium that you're familiar

00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:31.360
with in a certain way.

00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:34.900
So these are people that are
pushing that in a different

00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:37.920
direction and exploring smaller
personal things in the

00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:40.830
same way that you would have
seen with independent film in

00:35:40.830 --> 00:35:45.930
the '90s or the '70s, people
using a medium in a different

00:35:45.930 --> 00:35:47.190
way to tell different stories.

00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:48.230
And that was

00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:48.736
compelling to Us.

00:35:48.736 --> 00:35:52.420
It was also compelling to us
because these people, the

00:35:52.420 --> 00:35:55.370
people that we follow-- and
maybe we're like this, too--

00:35:55.370 --> 00:35:56.710
are kind of obsessive.

00:35:56.710 --> 00:36:00.400
And I think it was just a neat
way for us to look at creative

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:04.910
obsession and that creative
process through these artists,

00:36:04.910 --> 00:36:07.110
as opposed to other kinds
of artists like poets or

00:36:07.110 --> 00:36:08.540
filmmakers or whatever.

00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:10.900
I think we were interested in
looking at those ideas through

00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:12.580
these people.

00:36:12.580 --> 00:36:13.070
JAMES SWIRSKY: Yeah.

00:36:13.070 --> 00:36:15.000
I agree with all that.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:16.350
LISANNE PAJOT: That's why it
mattered to us, rather.

00:36:16.350 --> 00:36:17.640
JAMES SWIRSKY: Yeah.

00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:20.410
INTERVIEWER: So actually, on
that note, a lot of the things

00:36:20.410 --> 00:36:23.440
you portrayed in movie, like the
agony of creation or the

00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:26.660
sacrifices you make and that
kind of vulnerability, or

00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:28.800
like, yourself, you put in it.

00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:30.030
Those are universal, right?

00:36:30.030 --> 00:36:32.570
And I think that's why a lot of
people reacted to the movie

00:36:32.570 --> 00:36:35.810
the way they did, even if
they never played games.

00:36:35.810 --> 00:36:39.060
I'm curious if there are any
parallels between those things

00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:41.170
that we saw and your
own adventure

00:36:41.170 --> 00:36:43.220
in making it a movie.

00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:44.730
Any kind of, you know--

00:36:44.730 --> 00:36:45.030
LISANNE PAJOT: Totally.

00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:46.680
JAMES SWIRSKY: Oh, yeah.

00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:49.520
LISANNE PAJOT: We went crazy
this past two years.

00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:52.030
It's been up and down, like
a lot of the same things.

00:36:52.030 --> 00:36:54.530
Like the idea of putting
yourself out there

00:36:54.530 --> 00:36:55.370
through your work.

00:36:55.370 --> 00:36:57.390
When this went out there, I
thought, what is everyone

00:36:57.390 --> 00:36:59.020
going to say?

00:36:59.020 --> 00:37:01.770
We value certain things, and
by choosing these things in

00:37:01.770 --> 00:37:04.100
the film, they're going
to see what I value.

00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:05.350
That was sort of a thing.

00:37:05.350 --> 00:37:07.010
And having it all over the
internet, and people on

00:37:07.010 --> 00:37:08.700
YouTube saying awful things.

00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:13.590
JAMES SWIRSKY: And great things,
but just like in the

00:37:13.590 --> 00:37:17.580
movie, you'll have 1,000
positive comments and then

00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:19.690
you'll have two or three
negative ones, and all you pay

00:37:19.690 --> 00:37:21.070
attention to is the negative.

00:37:21.070 --> 00:37:24.340
It seemed like every emotional
arc in this movie, we went

00:37:24.340 --> 00:37:25.460
through making it.

00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:28.860
It felt, in many ways, that we
were filming ourselves six

00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:30.770
months into the future, although
we had no idea of

00:37:30.770 --> 00:37:31.200
knowing it.

00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:33.640
But it was like, we're filming
Tommy crunching

00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:34.570
for his Xbox deadline.

00:37:34.570 --> 00:37:37.230
And then fast-forward six
months, and we're crunching to

00:37:37.230 --> 00:37:38.210
hit this festival deadline.

00:37:38.210 --> 00:37:40.650
And then we lose all our
renders the day before.

00:37:40.650 --> 00:37:44.200
And it's just like
all these things.

00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:46.180
LISANNE PAJOT: We're fixing bugs
in the Steam app up until

00:37:46.180 --> 00:37:48.650
the minute that it goes live.

00:37:48.650 --> 00:37:50.660
It was very, it was remarkably
similar.

00:37:50.660 --> 00:37:53.480
And we didn't realize that
when we were making it.

00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:54.720
INTERVIEWER: I found this photo,
and I think this is

00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:57.250
your photo, but correct
me if I'm wrong.

00:37:57.250 --> 00:37:58.783
That was pretty funny.

00:37:58.783 --> 00:38:02.410
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:02.410 --> 00:38:03.820
INTERVIEWER: I think someone
needs to make a movie about

00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:05.076
this thing.

00:38:05.076 --> 00:38:06.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:06.510 --> 00:38:10.850
LISANNE PAJOT: Yeah, so we've
been both making videos and

00:38:10.850 --> 00:38:12.730
television for about 10 years.

00:38:12.730 --> 00:38:14.040
I started--

00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:15.360
I was really lucky.

00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:17.830
I got a job at the Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation, and

00:38:17.830 --> 00:38:20.770
I worked in television, in
television news, and then

00:38:20.770 --> 00:38:22.980
worked into lifestyle
television,

00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:23.930
like gardening shows.

00:38:23.930 --> 00:38:25.740
And then I ended up
in documentaries.

00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:28.730
And so I was sort of working
in documentaries, and James

00:38:28.730 --> 00:38:31.580
has a slightly different
background.

00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:31.980
JAMES SWIRSKY: Yeah.

00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:36.490
I went to university
and I took--

00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:37.820
when you want to be a filmmaker
in Winnipeg,

00:38:37.820 --> 00:38:41.510
Manitoba, it seems like a
silly thing to pursue.

00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:44.400
So when I went to university,
I took business, and then I

00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:47.080
took film studies on the side.

00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:49.280
And if you're in Canada and you
want to go into film, you

00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:50.940
either go to Vancouver
or you go to Toronto.

00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:53.280
So I went to Vancouver, trying
to break into film.

00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:55.850
And I couldn't get a job at all,
so I took a good job as a

00:38:55.850 --> 00:38:57.830
games tester for Electronic
Arts.

00:38:57.830 --> 00:38:59.510
And I spent two years there.

00:38:59.510 --> 00:39:03.830
And it was the best and worst
job I've ever had in my life.

00:39:03.830 --> 00:39:06.820
And it actually turned me
off games for a while.

00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:09.460
I hadn't touched games for,
like, eight years, until

00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:11.020
actually discovering
indie games.

00:39:11.020 --> 00:39:12.500
That kind of brought
me back to games.

00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:14.080
But I'm getting off-topic.

00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:16.780
So shortly after that, I moved
back to Winnipeg, and someone

00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:19.930
offered me money to do a high
school graduation, and

00:39:19.930 --> 00:39:20.710
videotape it.

00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:22.540
And so I was, like, oh,
yeah, that's awesome.

00:39:22.540 --> 00:39:23.040
I'll do that.

00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:25.380
And then it was just like this
thing clicked in my head.

00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:27.800
I was like, oh, people will
pay me money to do

00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:29.000
things with my camera.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:31.110
And so that turned into
another high school

00:39:31.110 --> 00:39:32.940
graduation, which turned into a
wedding, which turned into a

00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:36.610
commercial, and then it created
this 10 years of doing

00:39:36.610 --> 00:39:38.960
commercial corporate work
that grew and got more

00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:40.570
ambitious with time.

00:39:40.570 --> 00:39:42.170
LISANNE PAJOT: Eventually I left
CBC and started working

00:39:42.170 --> 00:39:43.230
with him on commercials.

00:39:43.230 --> 00:39:45.140
And so we were doing commercials
in Canada.

00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:46.300
It was going really well.

00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:49.310
We'd worked up to a point where
we had, like, national

00:39:49.310 --> 00:39:50.470
clothing retailers.

00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:51.530
It was like, whoa.

00:39:51.530 --> 00:39:53.010
JAMES SWIRSKY: Yeah, we were
finally getting the jobs and

00:39:53.010 --> 00:39:55.520
gigs that we wanted, the
size and the budgets

00:39:55.520 --> 00:39:56.140
and all that stuff.

00:39:56.140 --> 00:39:58.410
And it was literally--

00:39:58.410 --> 00:40:00.870
in Canada, there's a lot of RFP
lists, and we were finally

00:40:00.870 --> 00:40:03.210
on the rarefied lists,
the ones you

00:40:03.210 --> 00:40:04.390
really want to get onto.

00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:06.840
And then we decided
to make this.

00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:10.180
We kind of naively thought that
we could make this in

00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:12.480
about a year, and not only will
it take a year, but we

00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:16.510
can take breaks and knock off a
commercial gig for cash flow

00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:17.680
and stuff like that.

00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:19.670
And that didn't happen at all.

00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:21.590
It was like "Indie Game,"
24/7, for the

00:40:21.590 --> 00:40:22.890
last 2 and 1/2 years.

00:40:22.890 --> 00:40:25.210
That just kind of took
over our lives.

00:40:25.210 --> 00:40:27.710
But all though that period,
we've kind of been doing

00:40:27.710 --> 00:40:31.610
everything, like shooting,
editing, motion graphics.

00:40:31.610 --> 00:40:34.810
And it just always worked for
the projects that we were on.

00:40:34.810 --> 00:40:38.580
And so we just kind of naively
took that thinking into "Indie

00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:42.420
Game," thinking that this
would just be like 18

00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:44.220
five-minute videos, that's
all we need to do.

00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:45.940
That type of effort.

00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:48.550
And it wasn't, at all.

00:40:48.550 --> 00:40:50.840
But we learned a lot of lessons
doing it, and I think

00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:51.500
we're better for it.

00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:54.960
But I think our naivete kind
of worked in our favor,

00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:57.760
because had we known, we
might not have done it.

00:40:57.760 --> 00:40:59.720
INTERVIEWER: I have online
question that's maybe the

00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:00.000
[INAUDIBLE]

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:00.380
a little bit.

00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:02.090
Did you miss any great moments
while filming?

00:41:02.090 --> 00:41:05.210
Did you have to restage
anything?

00:41:05.210 --> 00:41:05.550
LISANNE PAJOT: No.

00:41:05.550 --> 00:41:06.390
JAMES SWIRSKY: No.

00:41:06.390 --> 00:41:08.095
LISANNE PAJOT: We didn't restage
anything, but there

00:41:08.095 --> 00:41:10.920
was a lot of things that could
have happened that could have

00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:14.090
had us not capture
certain things.

00:41:14.090 --> 00:41:18.220
Like for instance, at the end
of the film, Edmund has this

00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:22.680
wonderful postmortem interview,
reflecting on the

00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:25.620
experience, and it would've been
much more difficult if he

00:41:25.620 --> 00:41:26.395
had shaved.

00:41:26.395 --> 00:41:28.676
He was about to shave
off his beard.

00:41:28.676 --> 00:41:29.570
JAMES SWIRSKY: Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:41:29.570 --> 00:41:32.490
Well, basically, Edmund just
watched some reviews, and it

00:41:32.490 --> 00:41:35.110
was at the end of his four days
of release of "Super Meat

00:41:35.110 --> 00:41:39.620
Boy." And I went to the hotel to
offload footage and kind of

00:41:39.620 --> 00:41:41.590
gave Edmund and Danielle
some alone time.

00:41:41.590 --> 00:41:45.850
And Edmund was this close
to shaving for the final

00:41:45.850 --> 00:41:47.890
interview, which would have
completely screwed up

00:41:47.890 --> 00:41:48.510
everything.

00:41:48.510 --> 00:41:51.000
And Danielle stopped him from
doing it-- not because she

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:54.990
thought it would be bad for the
movie, but she thought it

00:41:54.990 --> 00:41:58.100
might be something that they
want to get for the movie.

00:41:58.100 --> 00:42:00.770
But thank God that she stopped
him, because otherwise we

00:42:00.770 --> 00:42:02.370
would have this weird--

00:42:02.370 --> 00:42:05.430
it would've been a title
card. "Edmund shaved."

00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:06.580
INTERVIEWER: Or,
you know, CGI.

00:42:06.580 --> 00:42:07.326
LISANNE PAJOT: Yeah.

00:42:07.326 --> 00:42:08.320
JAMES SWIRSKY: Yeah, or CGI.

00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:10.670
LISANNE PAJOT: Facial hair
changes actually sort of are

00:42:10.670 --> 00:42:12.180
kind of a timeline
in the movie.

00:42:12.180 --> 00:42:14.930
And so that would have screwed
up a little bit.

00:42:14.930 --> 00:42:15.370
LISANNE PAJOT: Yeah.

00:42:15.370 --> 00:42:15.780
Yeah.

00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:19.820
You can kind of like see their
state, their mental and

00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:22.730
emotional states as through
their facial hair.

00:42:22.730 --> 00:42:24.680
And yeah.

00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:26.135
INTERVIEWER: What's next, and
Humble Bundle, maybe?

00:42:28.730 --> 00:42:29.340
JAMES SWIRSKY: Yeah.

00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:32.260
Well, because we're
self-releasing, we're still on

00:42:32.260 --> 00:42:33.220
this thing.

00:42:33.220 --> 00:42:34.490
We're probably going to
be on it for about

00:42:34.490 --> 00:42:36.260
another five, six months.

00:42:36.260 --> 00:42:38.520
And I've been underestimating
everything all throughout this

00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:39.680
thing, so it's probably--

00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:40.540
LISANNE PAJOT: When he says
five, six months,

00:42:40.540 --> 00:42:41.390
just think a year.

00:42:41.390 --> 00:42:41.680
JAMES SWIRSKY: A year.

00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:42.420
Yeah.

00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:43.830
So we're going to--

00:42:43.830 --> 00:42:45.860
we hope to actually be starting
something new.

00:42:45.860 --> 00:42:48.500
We have three ideas and we're
pursuing all three of them.

00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:49.750
We're going to kind of
see what sticks.

00:42:49.750 --> 00:42:52.330
And we hope to start filming
in May/June of next year.

00:42:52.330 --> 00:42:53.920
LISANNE PAJOT: Watch for
the Kickstarter.

00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:54.940
JAMES SWIRSKY: Yeah.

00:42:54.940 --> 00:42:57.020
And Humble Bundle would
be awesome.

00:42:57.020 --> 00:42:58.050
I think that would be cool.

00:42:58.050 --> 00:43:02.130
They haven't done movies yet,
but Steam hasn't done movies.

00:43:02.130 --> 00:43:02.965
Oh, the Cookie, right?

00:43:02.965 --> 00:43:03.410
LISANNE PAJOT: Cookie.

00:43:03.410 --> 00:43:04.490
JAMES SWIRSKY: Yeah,
yeah, yeah.

00:43:04.490 --> 00:43:05.680
Yeah.

00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:08.200
Those guys are awesome, and we
love what they're doing, and

00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:10.580
we would love to do
it with them.

00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:14.170
INTERVIEWER: So in the process
of researching this, I just

00:43:14.170 --> 00:43:15.880
want to show this picture
because I think it's the most

00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:17.390
awesome thing ever, and
I kind of want to

00:43:17.390 --> 00:43:19.760
hear the back story.

00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:24.010
So there's Will Arnett,
and there's a

00:43:24.010 --> 00:43:26.260
Power Glove, and Christmas.

00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:28.700
So it's almost too much.

00:43:28.700 --> 00:43:31.480
But I want to know
what this is.

00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:32.420
LISANNE PAJOT: This
was all his idea.

00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:33.690
JAMES SWIRSKY: Yeah.

00:43:33.690 --> 00:43:35.890
There was a local radio station
in Winnipeg, and Will

00:43:35.890 --> 00:43:38.250
Arnett does awesome charity
work, and he was there with

00:43:38.250 --> 00:43:41.520
the United Way of Winnipeg and
they were launching this

00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:43.940
fantastic thing, where they
were giving Jets season

00:43:43.940 --> 00:43:46.150
tickets to sick kids.

00:43:46.150 --> 00:43:47.740
And really awesome stuff.

00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:51.350
And he was in town promoting
that, and the radio station

00:43:51.350 --> 00:43:52.970
had this contest.

00:43:52.970 --> 00:43:54.810
LISANNE PAJOT: Like, get your
office together to take a

00:43:54.810 --> 00:43:55.810
photo with Will Arnett.

00:43:55.810 --> 00:43:57.740
But he, like, staged it.

00:43:57.740 --> 00:43:58.310
JAMES SWIRSKY: Well, yeah.

00:43:58.310 --> 00:43:59.640
It was supposed to be--

00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:02.910
basically, yeah, highest bidder
gets their Christmas

00:44:02.910 --> 00:44:03.770
card with Will Arnett.

00:44:03.770 --> 00:44:04.280
And you can send it off--

00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:04.920
LISANNE PAJOT: Your company
Christmas card.

00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:05.910
JAMES SWIRSKY: Your company
Christmas card, and you can

00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:08.500
send it off to all your
customers and stuff like that.

00:44:08.500 --> 00:44:12.880
And yeah, so I bid,
and we won.

00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:15.650
And these are the only marketing
dollars we ever

00:44:15.650 --> 00:44:17.600
spent for the movie.

00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:20.670
And so I think he was kind of
expecting just to kind of go

00:44:20.670 --> 00:44:23.090
and do like, hey, how
are you, and do a

00:44:23.090 --> 00:44:24.500
meet-and-greet type of thing.

00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:27.900
And I had plans, and so I
directed the photoshoot.

00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:29.181
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:29.181 --> 00:44:30.730
JAMES SWIRSKY: I was, like, no,
we want you put on this

00:44:30.730 --> 00:44:31.220
red sweater.

00:44:31.220 --> 00:44:33.540
Which he didn't want to do,
which was understandable,

00:44:33.540 --> 00:44:35.580
because it was kind of gross,
and he was looked

00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:36.660
very good at the time.

00:44:36.660 --> 00:44:39.020
So he just kind of hung it on
his shoulder, and I'm like,

00:44:39.020 --> 00:44:42.560
OK, and you have this present,
and it's to be a

00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:43.090
Power Glove in it.

00:44:43.090 --> 00:44:44.910
And he didn't really know what
a Power Glove was, but he was

00:44:44.910 --> 00:44:46.870
really game and he was
really nice about it.

00:44:46.870 --> 00:44:49.120
And you open it, and we're going
to be proud parents,

00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:50.960
then you'll put it on.

00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:52.770
And we'll take photos throughout
the whole thing.

00:44:52.770 --> 00:44:55.640
And then we turned it into this
album art, and that was

00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:57.900
our Christmas card for that.

00:44:57.900 --> 00:44:59.170
And yeah.

00:44:59.170 --> 00:45:01.560
He was awesome throughout
the whole thing.

00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:09.070
INTERVIEWER: On that
note, yeah.

00:45:09.070 --> 00:45:10.930
I'm curious--

00:45:10.930 --> 00:45:13.000
we have five minutes, so maybe
one or two more questions.

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:13.430
JAMES SWIRSKY: Yeah, totally.

00:45:13.430 --> 00:45:17.310
INTERVIEWER: I'm curious about
the kind of iconic Super

00:45:17.310 --> 00:45:21.270
Nintendo controller kind of
hanging there in the-- well,

00:45:21.270 --> 00:45:23.210
everywhere, pretty much.

00:45:23.210 --> 00:45:25.450
Is there any story
behind that?

00:45:25.450 --> 00:45:27.020
LISANNE PAJOT: Yeah.

00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:29.680
INTERVIEWER: And why Super
Nintendo, and not, like, I

00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:30.190
don't know--

00:45:30.190 --> 00:45:30.290
LISANNE PAJOT: NES.

00:45:30.290 --> 00:45:30.660
Yeah.

00:45:30.660 --> 00:45:32.300
We've gotten that
question before?

00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:34.270
INTERVIEWER: Atari joystick?

00:45:34.270 --> 00:45:34.980
LISANNE PAJOT: Atari.

00:45:34.980 --> 00:45:38.440
It was actually the first
thing we ever shot.

00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:41.510
We went to breakfast one day and
we were talking about this

00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:44.230
idea of doing a film about
game design and game

00:45:44.230 --> 00:45:45.010
development and whatever.

00:45:45.010 --> 00:45:47.570
And then we sort of left, and
we were like, yeah, yeah, I

00:45:47.570 --> 00:45:48.300
think we'll start.

00:45:48.300 --> 00:45:49.990
JAMES SWIRSKY: This was about
four or five months before we

00:45:49.990 --> 00:45:51.680
actually even decided
to do the movie.

00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:53.120
LISANNE PAJOT: So we were just
sort of talking about it, and

00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:55.770
walked outside in a back alley,
and there hanging was a

00:45:55.770 --> 00:45:58.270
Super Nintendo controller
from the sky.

00:45:58.270 --> 00:45:59.240
And so we shot it.

00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:01.730
And we just shot it as like-- it
was like a little bit of a

00:46:01.730 --> 00:46:03.240
sign, in a way--

00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:06.180
not really realizing what
we'd use it for.

00:46:06.180 --> 00:46:08.010
Just, oh, that's kind
of interesting.

00:46:08.010 --> 00:46:12.232
Incidentally, there was an NES
controller just down the road.

00:46:12.232 --> 00:46:14.150
JAMES SWIRSKY: But it wasn't
as artfully hanging.

00:46:14.150 --> 00:46:17.590
Like it was there, but it the
composition wasn't good.

00:46:17.590 --> 00:46:18.760
LISANNE PAJOT: This is
an area in Winnipeg

00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:19.360
that's called Wolseley.

00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:20.300
It's kind of artsy.

00:46:20.300 --> 00:46:24.440
And so there's just random
things hanging from the sky.

00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:27.130
And so we did our first
Kickstarter in May 2010, and

00:46:27.130 --> 00:46:29.230
we needed a little bit of video
to put on the front of

00:46:29.230 --> 00:46:30.980
it, for whatever reason.

00:46:30.980 --> 00:46:34.260
And we included this video, and
we put "Indie Game, the

00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:35.740
Movie" beside the controller.

00:46:35.740 --> 00:46:41.300
And that ended up being the
Vimeo tab, and that went

00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:42.040
everywhere.

00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:43.390
We just didn't realize.

00:46:43.390 --> 00:46:46.640
And so that turned into the
image, just through Google

00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:49.140
search, essentially ended
up being the main

00:46:49.140 --> 00:46:49.820
image for the movie.

00:46:49.820 --> 00:46:51.200
And it just sort of stuck.

00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:52.360
And so we didn't
fight with it.

00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:53.930
We just kind of left it.

00:46:53.930 --> 00:46:55.290
JAMES SWIRSKY: And this
is kind of like--

00:46:55.290 --> 00:46:56.920
"Indie Game, the Movie," was
also a working title.

00:46:56.920 --> 00:46:58.860
We thought at some point we'd
come up with something much

00:46:58.860 --> 00:46:59.465
more evocative.

00:46:59.465 --> 00:47:00.510
LISANNE PAJOT: And better.

00:47:00.510 --> 00:47:02.350
JAMES SWIRSKY: Something
better than that.

00:47:02.350 --> 00:47:06.260
But it was kind of like one of
the downsides to communicating

00:47:06.260 --> 00:47:09.530
from day one-- even before day
one, actually, of shooting--

00:47:09.530 --> 00:47:12.920
is that your marketing your film
and you're talking your

00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:15.580
film, but you're kind of also
laying all this groundwork.

00:47:15.580 --> 00:47:17.580
And we just thought of it from
an audience-building

00:47:17.580 --> 00:47:20.660
perspective, and we weren't
really thinking about--

00:47:20.660 --> 00:47:23.250
we just thought, we can change
the title and morph the image

00:47:23.250 --> 00:47:27.890
of the movie as we need, and it
just got picked up so much

00:47:27.890 --> 00:47:33.380
more, so much earlier than
we thought, that we felt

00:47:33.380 --> 00:47:34.820
compelled to stick with it.

00:47:34.820 --> 00:47:38.470
And we liked it, too, and we
liked that you could kind of

00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:42.020
read into the image and what it
means, and all that stuff.

00:47:42.020 --> 00:47:45.470
But originally, it just started
as a pretty picture in

00:47:45.470 --> 00:47:46.690
front of our Kickstarter
campaign.

00:47:46.690 --> 00:47:49.010
And we just ran with it.

00:47:49.010 --> 00:47:55.410
But yeah, it's a neat lesson to
learn about communication,

00:47:55.410 --> 00:47:58.240
and being so open so early.

00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:00.600
I wouldn't ever dissuade anybody
from doing that, but

00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:03.220
it's just something that I would
consider a little more

00:48:03.220 --> 00:48:05.330
for our next project.

00:48:05.330 --> 00:48:07.640
INTERVIEWER: So I think that
last question, you learned a

00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:10.550
lot about making games, making
indie games, from the movie.

00:48:10.550 --> 00:48:13.410
I was curious if you could share
one piece of advice, if

00:48:13.410 --> 00:48:16.830
you want to go and start
making a documentary.

00:48:16.830 --> 00:48:19.050
I'm kind of selfishly asking,
because I'm curious, but I

00:48:19.050 --> 00:48:20.615
hope other people are too.

00:48:20.615 --> 00:48:22.660
Is there one thing that learned
that had no idea

00:48:22.660 --> 00:48:25.180
before that would be important,
that you can pass

00:48:25.180 --> 00:48:26.350
on to other people.

00:48:26.350 --> 00:48:28.063
LISANNE PAJOT: Well, we shot
about 300 hours, but I wish we

00:48:28.063 --> 00:48:29.270
would have shot more.

00:48:29.270 --> 00:48:32.290
So just never turn
the camera off.

00:48:32.290 --> 00:48:33.390
That would be my advice.

00:48:33.390 --> 00:48:35.160
JAMES SWIRSKY: Yeah, because
there are so many moments in

00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:38.030
the movie that are actual
beautiful moments, really

00:48:38.030 --> 00:48:40.570
strong moments in the movie,
that we were this close to

00:48:40.570 --> 00:48:43.280
turning the camera off, and then
this magic just happened.

00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:46.260
And sometimes, even when the
magic's happening, you don't

00:48:46.260 --> 00:48:49.640
really realize it, that it's
happening and that it'll end

00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:50.750
up in the movie.

00:48:50.750 --> 00:48:53.290
Like Danielle crying.

00:48:53.290 --> 00:48:55.720
There's this one scene where
Edmund reads a review, and

00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:57.210
then Danielle kind of breaks
down into tears.

00:48:57.210 --> 00:49:01.140
And that was something, that
was one of those instances

00:49:01.140 --> 00:49:04.060
where I was like this close to
stopping record, and actually

00:49:04.060 --> 00:49:05.390
packing up and leaving
for the night.

00:49:05.390 --> 00:49:07.540
And then this beautiful
stuff happens.

00:49:07.540 --> 00:49:11.030
Same thing, when she's talking
about the cats.

00:49:11.030 --> 00:49:12.550
I thought that was a
throwaway piece.

00:49:12.550 --> 00:49:16.320
I thought, it's a cute moment,
but it really worked really,

00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:20.060
really well to kind of add a
little bit of levity right

00:49:20.060 --> 00:49:21.820
when you needed it.

00:49:21.820 --> 00:49:23.270
Yeah, so never stop filming.

00:49:23.270 --> 00:49:26.610
And also, I would say to people
out there, I know a lot

00:49:26.610 --> 00:49:29.720
of other filmmakers that wait
for everything to be perfect.

00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:31.860
They wait until they have the
perfect script and that they

00:49:31.860 --> 00:49:34.290
have all their budget and that
they have the perfect camera

00:49:34.290 --> 00:49:36.620
that they want, or they're
waiting for the next camera to

00:49:36.620 --> 00:49:40.370
come out, and all these things
that can really just act as

00:49:40.370 --> 00:49:43.630
these hurdles towards your
actually getting out there and

00:49:43.630 --> 00:49:44.990
making something.

00:49:44.990 --> 00:49:47.590
Had we waited for situations to
be perfect for this movie,

00:49:47.590 --> 00:49:49.010
we probably wouldn't
have made it.

00:49:49.010 --> 00:49:53.450
And so I'm a big fan of just
going out there and doing it.

00:49:53.450 --> 00:49:56.210
And maybe you won't do the job
that you wanted to, but at

00:49:56.210 --> 00:49:58.180
least you got there and you made
something, and you can

00:49:58.180 --> 00:49:58.800
build on that.

00:49:58.800 --> 00:50:00.370
And the next thing will be
better, because you'll be

00:50:00.370 --> 00:50:01.700
learning through actual doing.

00:50:01.700 --> 00:50:05.210
But a lot of people, yeah, they
just kind of wait until

00:50:05.210 --> 00:50:07.120
everything's absolutely
perfect.

00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:11.090
And it very rarely
ever, ever is.

00:50:11.090 --> 00:50:11.490
INTERVIEWER: Right.

00:50:11.490 --> 00:50:13.760
Well, on that note,
I suppose--

00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:15.590
yeah, thank you so
much for coming.

00:50:15.590 --> 00:50:17.510
Again, it's a great movie.

00:50:17.510 --> 00:50:19.820
For those two people in the
audience who haven't seen it,

00:50:19.820 --> 00:50:22.270
please do, or see it again.

00:50:22.270 --> 00:50:23.300
Thanks for coming.

00:50:23.300 --> 00:50:27.010
And if you want to stick around,
we actually have a

00:50:27.010 --> 00:50:30.950
16-inch version of
"Cybervision." Other than

00:50:30.950 --> 00:50:33.100
that, thank you so much.

00:50:33.100 --> 00:50:33.510
LISANNE PAJOT: Guard
your [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:33.510 --> 00:50:34.710
JAMES SWIRSKY: Thanks
for having us.

00:50:34.710 --> 00:50:38.902
