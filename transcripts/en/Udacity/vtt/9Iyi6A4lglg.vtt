00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.830
So let's see if we understood the impact of branch predictors on performance.

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.140
We will consider the old Pentium 4 Prescott processor which has an extremely

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:16.620
deep pipeline. It fetches then does 29 stages worth of work and

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:21.950
only then it resolves branches. It of course uses branch prediction and

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:26.970
is capable of executing multiple instructions per cycle. So that in a program,

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.229
where about 20% of all instructions are branches, only 1% of branches might

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:38.870
be mispredicted, and let's say that that gives us a CP1 program of 0.5.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.950
So the question for you is, if we had a slightly worse predictor, so

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.320
that 2% of branches are mispredicted in the program,

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.690
how would that change the CPI? What would the CPI be?
