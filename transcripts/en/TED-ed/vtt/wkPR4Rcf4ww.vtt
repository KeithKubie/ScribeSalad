00:00:06.758 --> 00:00:09.918
"Someone must have been telling
lies about Josef K.

00:00:09.918 --> 00:00:14.791
He knew he had done nothing wrong,
but one morning, he was arrested."

00:00:14.791 --> 00:00:16.756
Thus begins "The Trial,"

00:00:16.756 --> 00:00:20.754
one of author Franz Kafka's
most well-known novels.

00:00:20.754 --> 00:00:24.194
K, the protagonist, 
is arrested out of nowhere

00:00:24.194 --> 00:00:26.477
and made to go through
a bewildering process

00:00:26.477 --> 00:00:28.635
where neither the cause of his arrest,

00:00:28.635 --> 00:00:31.011
nor the nature 
of the judicial proceedings

00:00:31.011 --> 00:00:33.168
are made clear to him.

00:00:33.168 --> 00:00:37.197
This sort of scenario is considered
so characteristic of Kafka's work

00:00:37.197 --> 00:00:39.787
that scholars came up 
with a new word for it.

00:00:39.787 --> 00:00:44.954
Kafkaesque has entered the vernacular
to describe unnecessarily complicated

00:00:44.954 --> 00:00:47.663
and frustrating experiences,

00:00:47.663 --> 00:00:51.955
like being forced to navigate labyrinths
of bureaucracy.

00:00:51.955 --> 00:00:55.191
But does standing in a long line
to fill out confusing paperwork

00:00:55.191 --> 00:00:58.441
really capture the richness 
of Kafka's vision?

00:00:58.441 --> 00:01:03.262
Beyond the word's casual use,
what makes something Kafkaesque?

00:01:03.262 --> 00:01:08.319
Franz Kafka's stories do indeed deal
with many mundane and absurd aspects

00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:10.131
of modern bureaucracy,

00:01:10.131 --> 00:01:14.390
drawn in part from his experience
of working as an insurance clerk

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.080
in early 20th century Prague.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.382
Many of his protagonists 
are office workers

00:01:19.382 --> 00:01:22.098
compelled to struggle through
a web of obstacles

00:01:22.098 --> 00:01:24.546
in order to achieve their goals,

00:01:24.546 --> 00:01:29.194
and often the whole ordeal turns out
to be so disorienting and illogical

00:01:29.194 --> 00:01:33.326
that success becomes pointless
in the first place.

00:01:33.326 --> 00:01:35.700
For example, in the short story, 
"Poseidon,"

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.056
the Ancient Greek god is an executive
so swamped with paperwork

00:01:40.056 --> 00:01:44.015
that he's never had time to explore
his underwater domain.

00:01:44.015 --> 00:01:47.472
The joke here is that not even
a god can handle the amount of paperwork

00:01:47.472 --> 00:01:50.201
demanded by the modern workplace.

00:01:50.201 --> 00:01:52.352
But the reason why is telling.

00:01:52.352 --> 00:01:55.108
He's unwilling to delegate any of the work

00:01:55.108 --> 00:01:59.079
because he deems everyone else 
unworthy of the task.

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:03.230
Kafka's Poseidon is a prisoner
of his own ego.

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.570
This simple story contains 
all of the elements

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.105
that make for a truly Kafkaesque scenario.

00:02:09.105 --> 00:02:11.692
It's not the absurdity 
of bureaucracy alone,

00:02:11.692 --> 00:02:16.288
but the irony of the character's 
circular reasoning in reaction to it

00:02:16.288 --> 00:02:18.940
that is emblematic of Kafka's writing.

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.473
His tragicomic stories act as a form of
mythology for the modern industrial age,

00:02:24.473 --> 00:02:27.417
employing dream logic to explore
the relationships

00:02:27.417 --> 00:02:33.008
between systems of arbitrary power
and the individuals caught up in them.

00:02:33.008 --> 00:02:37.261
Take, for example, Kafka's 
most famous story, "Metamorphosis."

00:02:37.261 --> 00:02:40.942
When Gregor Samsa awaken's one morning
to find himself transformed

00:02:40.942 --> 00:02:42.949
into a giant insect,

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:46.221
his greatest worry 
is that he gets to work on time.

00:02:46.221 --> 00:02:49.823
Of course, this proves impossible.

00:02:49.823 --> 00:02:54.319
It was not only the authoritarian realm
of the workplace that inspired Kafka.

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:57.601
Some of his protagonists' struggles
come from within.

00:02:57.601 --> 00:02:59.387
The short story, "A Hunger Artist,"

00:02:59.387 --> 00:03:05.320
describes a circus performer whose act
consists of extended fasts.

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.389
He's upset that the circus master
limits these to 40 days,

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:13.035
believing this prevents him from achieving
greatness in his art.

00:03:13.035 --> 00:03:15.577
But when his act loses popularity,

00:03:15.577 --> 00:03:19.103
he is left free 
to starve himself to death.

00:03:19.103 --> 00:03:22.440
The twist comes when he lays dying
in anonymity,

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.975
regretfully admitting that his art
has always been a fraud.

00:03:25.975 --> 00:03:28.132
He fasted not through strength of will,

00:03:28.132 --> 00:03:32.165
but simply because he never found
a food he liked.

00:03:32.165 --> 00:03:33.362
Even in "The Trial,"

00:03:33.362 --> 00:03:35.887
which seems to focus 
directly on bureaucracy,

00:03:35.887 --> 00:03:40.974
the vague laws and bewildering procedures
point to something far more sinister:

00:03:40.974 --> 00:03:44.913
the terrible momentum of the legal system
proves unstoppable,

00:03:44.913 --> 00:03:48.359
even by supposedly powerful officials.

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:50.798
This is a system 
that doesn't serve justice,

00:03:50.798 --> 00:03:54.608
but whose sole function 
is to perpetuate itself.

00:03:54.608 --> 00:03:56.484
What political theorist Hannah Arendt,

00:03:56.484 --> 00:03:58.620
writing years after Kafka's death,

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.854
would call "tyranny without a tyrant."

00:04:01.854 --> 00:04:05.104
Yet accompanying 
the bleakness of Kafka's stories,

00:04:05.104 --> 00:04:06.851
there's a great deal of humor

00:04:06.851 --> 00:04:10.570
rooted in the nonsensical logic
of the situations described.

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:15.855
So on the one hand, it's easy to recognize
the Kafkaesque in today's world.

00:04:15.855 --> 00:04:20.949
We rely on increasingly convoluted systems
of administration

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:24.973
that have real consequences on
every aspect of our lives.

00:04:24.973 --> 00:04:28.941
And we find our every word judged
by people we can't see

00:04:28.941 --> 00:04:32.096
according to rules we don't know.

00:04:32.096 --> 00:04:36.787
On the other hand, by fine-tuning
our attention to the absurd,

00:04:36.787 --> 00:04:40.596
Kafka also reflects our shortcomings
back at ourselves.

00:04:40.596 --> 00:04:45.603
In doing so, he reminds us that the world
we live in is one we create,

00:04:45.603 --> 00:04:47.945
and have the power 
to change for the better.
