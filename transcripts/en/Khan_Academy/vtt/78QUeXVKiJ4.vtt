00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.540
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:03.770
is talk about proteins,
and some of you all

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:05.310
might already be familiar with them,

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.080
at least in some context.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.180
If you look at any type
of packaging on food

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:14.580
you'll oftentimes see a
label that has protein listed

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.780
and a certain number of grams per serving,

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.410
and some of you who might
be athletically inclined

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.170
might associate it with things
that help you build muscle.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.020
And none of that is
incorrect, but as we'll see

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.120
in this video and in many future videos,

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.050
proteins are involved
in almost every, single

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.050
biological process and every,
single living organism.

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.040
And if we ask ourselves what are they,

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.040
well, they're biomolecules.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.370
They're molecules found
in biological systems.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:44.040
And they're large biomolecules.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.660
We could call them macro
molecules, molecules,

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.120
which is just referring to they're made up

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.030
of many, many, many, many, many atoms.

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.560
These right here are pictures,

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.950
two different views, of
the chaperonin protein,

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.330
and this is, the chaperonin
protein is roughly

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.320
800,000 times the mass of a hydrogen atom.

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.880
So it's going to contain tens of thousands

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.860
of atoms which would very
much make it a macro molecule.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.780
Now one thing to be careful of,

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.720
even though these are very, very large

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.490
on a molecular scale,
even the largest protein

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.730
we know of, titan, is about
one micrometer in length,

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.040
and that's much larger
than this chaperonin here.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.000
And a micrometer is one
thousandth of a millimeter.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.240
So even the largest
proteins are microscopic.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.240
Now another way to think about proteins

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.410
is what they are made up of.

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.270
So some proteins are
made up of a single chain

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.000
of something called amino acids,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.930
and things like chaperonin are made up

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.750
of multiple chains of amino acids.

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.240
So in a little bit I'll
show you some particular

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.370
amino acids but for now just think of them

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.730
as the building blocks of proteins.

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:55.440
So let's say that's an amino acid

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.810
and then it will bond
to another amino acid,

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.650
and it's not just one type of amino acid

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.490
and they can form these really,
really, really long chains.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.860
And so let me be very clear,
this is an amino acid,

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.890
and it's called that because
it contains an amine group,

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.170
which you don't have
to worry about for now,

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.520
and they are the monomers
that form the polymers

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.500
of what's known as polypeptide chains.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.830
So these are monomers.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.130
You connect them together,
and you could keep going,

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.430
you could have hundreds or
even thousands of these,

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.510
and so this whole thing right
over here you can consider

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.090
to be a polymer, and a
chain of amino acids,

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.646
the polymer of amino acids
is known as a polypeptide.

00:02:44.646 --> 00:02:46.660
Polypeptide.

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.040
And sometimes a polypeptide
chain is a protein,

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.750
but sometimes a protein
can be made up of multiple

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.680
polypeptide chains put together.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.710
And what happens is after
these amino acids connect

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:04.360
or bond to each other, they
bend and they form the shape

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.360
of these proteins.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.450
So you can imagine the chaperonin protein

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.350
right over here, it has
these chains of amino acids

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.360
that bend, that have a
conformation that form the shape,

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.640
and that's really what
gives proteins their power.

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.660
And as I mentioned, proteins are involved

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.770
in almost every, single
biological function.

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:27.770
They play a structural, structural role.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.070
They play a mechanical role.

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:32.300
When your muscles contract,

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.560
you have actin and myosin proteins

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.320
interacting with each other
so that your muscle contracts.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.810
They can act as enzymes,
which we will talk about

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.570
in a lot more depth in future videos.

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.120
Enzymes help catalyze reactions.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.680
They help biological,
biochemical reactions

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.240
happen in biological systems.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.610
They can be involved
with the immune system.

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.120
They could be involved with signaling.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.080
They can send signals
from one part of the body

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.470
to another, or they can
be receptors on cells

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:03.960
that receive signals.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:07.930
So proteins are incredibly,
incredibly important.

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.340
Now with that out of the way,
let's dig a little bit deeper

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.850
into the building blocks of proteins,

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.330
the monomers that build up the polymers

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.650
that are polypeptides,
which could be proteins

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.840
or which could be used
to build up proteins.

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.650
So what we see on the
left here is a typical

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.500
structure of an amino acid.

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.050
Notice you see some oxygens,
you see some hydrogen,

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.490
some carbons, and nitrogen.

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.420
And then bonded to this
carbon right over here

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:35.720
you see this R.

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.130
And you say what element is that.

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:38.430
Well, this is not an element.

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.810
This is referring, this
is kind of a placeholder

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.220
for a side chain, which differentiates

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:44.820
the common amino acids.

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.780
And you see some of the common
amino acids in this diagram

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:49.613
right over here.

00:04:49.613 --> 00:04:51.620
And you can see what the R would be.

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.680
For this arginine right over here,

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.260
that R group would be this part,

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.900
and you don't have to understand
the biochemistry of it

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.950
in too much detail, but you can see

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:04.880
that they all have this
top part in common,

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:09.710
but then they all have a
different R group right over here.

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.450
And it's different sequences
of these amino acids

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:16.830
that give us the diversity
of all of the proteins

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.180
that we have in biological systems

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:20.570
of all of the various shapes.

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:23.330
And it really, really,
really, really is amazing.

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.530
I mean, just going back to
this picture of chaperonin

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:29.490
which is involved with
helping other proteins

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:34.430
get their shape, it chaperones
the protein folding process,

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:35.460
so to speak.

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:36.760
Just think about the complexity.

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.730
This looks like a complex machine,

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:41.890
but it forms naturally
in biological systems.

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:44.630
And as we explore more and more biology,

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:48.070
we keep seeing these fascinating
proteins that look like

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:52.130
these incredible systems that
really boggle the imagination.
