00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.921
So, let's start with where we
were.

00:00:05.921 --> 00:00:13.235
We were talking about
exponential growth in

00:00:13.235 --> 00:00:15.325
populations.

00:00:15.325 --> 00:00:25.078
And, we said we could describe
this as one over the dN/dt

00:00:25.078 --> 00:00:31.000
equals some growth rate,
r.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.250
And, in this case,
we're talking about,

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.973
let me ask that is a question.

00:00:43.973 --> 00:00:54.657
As a model for population
growth, what's wrong with this?

00:00:54.657 --> 00:01:00.000
What does this project?

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.012
This is N.

00:01:01.012 --> 00:01:02.329
This is time.

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:04.658
There's no stopping it.

00:01:04.658 --> 00:01:10.531
I mean, we'd be knee deep in
everything if populations grew

00:01:10.531 --> 00:01:15.797
according to this model,
OK, because it just goes off

00:01:15.797 --> 00:01:19.139
into infinity in terms of
density.

00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:22.683
So, we know that this is
inadequate.

00:01:22.683 --> 00:01:28.658
In fact, some people describe
the entire field of population

00:01:28.658 --> 00:01:34.936
ecology as a field that tries to
determine why real populations

00:01:34.936 --> 00:01:40.000
can't grow according to this
model.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.944
In other words,
the whole field is trying to

00:01:43.944 --> 00:01:49.357
understand what the mechanisms
are in populations that limit

00:01:49.357 --> 00:01:50.550
their growth.

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.311
So, they don't grow
exponentially forever.

00:01:54.311 --> 00:01:58.715
So, in this case,
this is really a maximum growth

00:01:58.715 --> 00:02:00.000
rate.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.432
We can call that r Max.

00:02:02.432 --> 00:02:05.921
And in this case,
it's a constant.

00:02:05.921 --> 00:02:10.891
So, when we're talking about
exponential growth,

00:02:10.891 --> 00:02:17.235
the growth rate per unit time
is the maximum growth rate that

00:02:17.235 --> 00:02:23.580
that population is capable of
under those conditions and it's

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:24.743
a constant.

00:02:24.743 --> 00:02:29.607
So, if we want to plot it this
way, one over N,

00:02:29.607 --> 00:02:35.000
dN/dt, as a function of N,
is constant.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.448
It doesn't change as density
changes.

00:02:40.448 --> 00:02:48.470
So, now we're going to take a
historical look at this.

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:55.281
Back in the 1920s,
two fellows named Pearl and

00:02:55.281 --> 00:03:03.000
Reed wanted to model human
population growth.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.099
And they looked at this
exponential growth equation,

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:13.800
and they said there's got to be
something wrong with that.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:19.699
We can't just apply that to
humans, although if they plotted

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:24.699
as a function of time,
and this is humans in the US

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:28.599
from 1800 to 1900,
and this is the human

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:33.000
population size,
if they plotted this on this

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.000
curve, they got something that
looked like this.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.030
So, it kind of looked like
exponential growth.

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:52.536
But, when they went in it
actually looked at one over ND,

00:03:52.536 --> 00:04:00.711
dN/dt, which would be the slope
along here, they found that it

00:04:00.711 --> 00:04:05.000
looks something like this.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.406
In other words,
the actual growth rate of the

00:04:08.406 --> 00:04:12.974
population was decreasing as the
number of humans increased.

00:04:12.974 --> 00:04:28.000
And this is called a density
dependent response.
00:04:17&lt;clear/&gt;
 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:35.225
OK, so if we look at this,
remember from last time that r

00:04:35.225 --> 00:04:41.290
is equal to the birth rate minus
the death rate,

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:42.064
right?

00:04:42.064 --> 00:04:48.258
So, we can look at,
this is just a simple cartoon

00:04:48.258 --> 00:04:52.387
drawing of what's going on here.

00:04:52.387 --> 00:05:00.000
Density dependent factors
regulate population size.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.197
So, if we plot one over ND,
dN/dt as either a birth rate or

00:05:04.197 --> 00:05:07.092
a death rate,
as a function of population

00:05:07.092 --> 00:05:11.506
density, when you have density,
really the one that's the most

00:05:11.506 --> 00:05:15.342
important here is looking at
this one, that death rate

00:05:15.342 --> 00:05:18.815
increases as population
increases, and birth rate

00:05:18.815 --> 00:05:19.539
decreases.

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:23.809
And you have an intersection
here where birth rate and death

00:05:23.809 --> 00:05:27.065
rate are equal,
and your population's going to

00:05:27.065 --> 00:05:31.263
stabilize there where there will
be no change in population

00:05:31.263 --> 00:05:33.000
growth.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:39.204
And these density dependent
birth rates and death rates

00:05:39.204 --> 00:05:42.765
introduce a stabilizing factor.

00:05:42.765 --> 00:05:47.936
As N increases,
r decreases in the population.

00:05:47.936 --> 00:05:53.910
And that's what brings
population back into some sort

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:55.634
of equilibrium.

00:05:55.634 --> 00:06:00.000
OK, so all right,
forget that.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.379
So, let's go back over to Pearl
and Reed.

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:09.087
We're going to stay on the
board for awhile.

00:06:09.087 --> 00:06:14.562
So the question is,
how do we modify that equation,

00:06:14.562 --> 00:06:20.474
our simple exponential growth
equation, so that it more

00:06:20.474 --> 00:06:26.496
realistically describes real
populations that can't grow

00:06:26.496 --> 00:06:30.000
totally unconstrained?

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:40.659
So what Pearl and Reed did,
how do we modify the

00:06:40.659 --> 00:06:44.969
exponential growth?

00:06:44.969 --> 00:06:57.670
So, here's what we want the
characteristics to be of this

00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:59.711
equation.

00:06:59.711 --> 00:07:10.824
We want one over N,
dN/dt, to go to zero as N gets

00:07:10.824 --> 00:07:14.000
large.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.137
And we want it to go to our
max, the maximum growth rate,

00:07:19.137 --> 00:07:21.247
when N approaches zero.

00:07:21.247 --> 00:07:24.550
In other words,
at really, really low

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:28.770
population density is,
you can effectively have

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:34.000
exponential growth because
nothing's limiting you.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:41.725
When the density gets very,
very large, you want this

00:07:41.725 --> 00:07:45.588
growth rate to go to zero.

00:07:45.588 --> 00:07:51.234
So, they came up,
so let's plot this N.

00:07:51.234 --> 00:08:00.000
This is T, and here's our
exponential growth equation.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:13.147
And they came up with a
function that looks like this.

00:08:13.147 --> 00:08:25.550
So, this would be one over N,
and to describe this,

00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:32.000
we have this equation.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.753
And this is called the logistic
equation for reasons that are

00:08:37.753 --> 00:08:39.767
historically obscure.

00:08:39.767 --> 00:08:44.657
This is a French term that has
something to do with,

00:08:44.657 --> 00:08:47.630
anybody know,
who speaks French?

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:51.082
It has to do with something
military.

00:08:51.082 --> 00:08:56.835
Anyway, I've never been able to
figure out why they call this

00:08:56.835 --> 00:09:00.000
the logistic equation.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:11.414
But it doesn't matter what it's
called, this is what it is.

00:09:11.414 --> 00:09:22.042
And K here is the carrying
capacity of the environment.

00:09:22.042 --> 00:09:32.867
It's the maximum number of
organisms were the population

00:09:32.867 --> 00:09:37.000
levels off, OK?

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.408
All right, so let's look at
this.

00:09:41.408 --> 00:09:48.022
Let's replot this,
because it's easier to analyze

00:09:48.022 --> 00:09:49.813
the features.

00:09:49.813 --> 00:09:57.528
We're going to plot one over N,
dN/dt as a function of N.

00:09:57.528 --> 00:10:03.866
If we want to rewrite the
equation, one over N,

00:10:03.866 --> 00:10:08.000
dN/dt equals our max.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:20.260
We're just rearranging that
equation to make it easier to

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.449
visualize.

00:10:22.449 --> 00:10:23.106
OK?

00:10:23.106 --> 00:10:33.177
So that we have a line that we
can put that on,

00:10:33.177 --> 00:10:45.000
such that K is the X intercept,
and what's this?

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.088
Our max, exactly.

00:10:49.088 --> 00:11:01.835
So, you can see these features
over here at this plot,

00:11:01.835 --> 00:11:04.000
right?

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.003
So, as this goes to zero,
or as N is very large,

00:11:09.003 --> 00:11:12.303
one over N, dN/dt goes to zero.

00:11:12.303 --> 00:11:18.158
And, when N is very small,
one over N, dN/dt is near our

00:11:18.158 --> 00:11:18.583
max.

00:11:18.583 --> 00:11:21.245
You're basically growing.

00:11:21.245 --> 00:11:27.419
You're over here where the
exponential growth curve and the

00:11:27.419 --> 00:11:32.422
logistical curve are essentially
the same thing.

00:11:32.422 --> 00:11:32.954
Yeah?

00:11:32.954 --> 00:11:37.000
Do I have something wrong?

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:44.338
Oh, very good,
very good, very good.

00:11:44.338 --> 00:11:46.435
Thank you.

00:11:46.435 --> 00:11:50.000
Absolutely right.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:12:01.532
OK, so the slope here is going
to be minus r max over K.

00:12:01.532 --> 00:12:03.000
.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:17.168
OK, so here we have a nice
density dependent response.

00:12:17.168 --> 00:12:30.000
OK, let's analyze some more
features of this.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:37.714
Just looking at the exponential
and the logistic,

00:12:37.714 --> 00:12:45.589
just to summarize,
one over N, dN/dt as a function

00:12:45.589 --> 00:12:54.750
of N, and if we just look at the
dN/dt as a function of N,

00:12:54.750 --> 00:13:03.750
for exponential we already said
that this is a flat line,

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:06.000
right?

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.524
It's a constant,
but the actual change in

00:13:11.524 --> 00:13:18.154
numbers as a function of time is
a straight line,

00:13:18.154 --> 00:13:25.889
whereas for the logistic,
one over N, dN/dt as a function

00:13:25.889 --> 00:13:31.000
of N, what does this look like?

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.463
We just did it,
so we are summarizing here.

00:13:36.463 --> 00:13:42.317
But here's one that I want you
to think about.

00:13:42.317 --> 00:13:48.821
What does the dN/dt look like
as a function of N if

00:13:48.821 --> 00:13:55.845
something's growing according to
the logistic equation?

00:13:55.845 --> 00:13:57.146
Like this?

00:13:57.146 --> 00:14:00.788
Yes, there you go,
like that.

00:14:00.788 --> 00:14:03.000
Right.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:09.500
Because there is an inflection
point here, right?

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:16.677
So, this is what's sometimes
called the optimum yield,

00:14:16.677 --> 00:14:23.718
and believe it or not,
this model is actually used in

00:14:23.718 --> 00:14:29.000
fisheries conservation for
years.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:35.213
Now we know that it's so much
more complicated than that that

00:14:35.213 --> 00:14:38.526
you can't just set the model is.

00:14:38.526 --> 00:14:44.843
But one could argue that if you
are managing a population that

00:14:44.843 --> 00:14:49.813
you want to harvest,
that you try to keep them at

00:14:49.813 --> 00:14:55.923
the density at which the dN/dt,
the production of organisms,

00:14:55.923 --> 00:14:57.062
is maximal.

00:14:57.062 --> 00:15:04.000
So, you try to maintain a
population there at that point.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:20.615
One of the features of the
logistic equation is that it

00:15:20.615 --> 00:15:40.000
assumes instantaneous feedback
of the density on growth rate.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.618
In other words,
it says in a population of a

00:15:43.618 --> 00:15:46.899
certain density,
the results in terms of

00:15:46.899 --> 00:15:49.592
offspring will be instantaneous.

00:15:49.592 --> 00:15:51.948
And we know that's not true.

00:15:51.948 --> 00:15:54.724
So, this is an
oversimplification.

00:15:54.724 --> 00:15:59.605
Even in the simplest organisms,
even microbes in a culture,

00:15:59.605 --> 00:16:04.485
say you suddenly starve them up
some substrate that they're

00:16:04.485 --> 00:16:06.000
using.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.768
It takes a while for their
biochemistry to readjust before

00:16:09.768 --> 00:16:10.099
that.

00:16:10.099 --> 00:16:14.132
They might have one generation
that's still at the same growth

00:16:14.132 --> 00:16:17.107
rate as it was before,
before the biochemistry

00:16:17.107 --> 00:16:20.214
readjusts and says,
whoa, we can't keep going at

00:16:20.214 --> 00:16:20.876
this rate.

00:16:20.876 --> 00:16:21.537
Slow down.

00:16:21.537 --> 00:16:24.975
And then for higher organisms,
you might have a whole

00:16:24.975 --> 00:16:27.157
generation before that sets it
in.

00:16:27.157 --> 00:16:30.000
Plants that make seeds,
etc.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.915
So we know that there's a
problem here.

00:16:32.915 --> 00:16:36.905
So, people have tried to
introduce time lags into the

00:16:36.905 --> 00:16:39.360
equation, and we don't have
time.

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:44.040
I mean there's lots of really
neat things that you can do with

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:44.424
this.

00:16:44.424 --> 00:16:49.181
If this was an advanced ecology
course, you'd be modeling it on

00:16:49.181 --> 00:16:52.173
your computer,
and putting time lags in,

00:16:52.173 --> 00:16:55.780
and see what happens and all
that kind of stuff.

00:16:55.780 --> 00:17:00.000
So we don't have time to do any
of that.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:06.014
I show you this more as a way,
I want you to learn how

00:17:06.014 --> 00:17:12.595
population ethologists think,
not that this is actually the

00:17:12.595 --> 00:17:16.907
most important model that ever
existed.

00:17:16.907 --> 00:17:22.581
So how do we introduce time
lags into the logistic?

00:17:22.581 --> 00:17:27.460
Well, the simplest way is to
introduce time.

00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:32.000
So, we're going to say dNt/dt.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:41.799
Let me just make sure that's
not ambiguous.

00:17:41.799 --> 00:17:56.033
dNt/dT, is equal to r max times
N at that time t times K minus

00:17:56.033 --> 00:18:00.000
Nt minus tao.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.648
In other words,
the density at some time,

00:18:03.648 --> 00:18:07.753
tao hours or days or whatever,
earlier than t,

00:18:07.753 --> 00:18:08.939
divided by K.

00:18:08.939 --> 00:18:14.594
So, what this says is that the
growth rate of the population is

00:18:14.594 --> 00:18:19.064
a function of the density up a
little bit earlier,

00:18:19.064 --> 00:18:24.537
or some amount earlier than the
time at which we're measuring

00:18:24.537 --> 00:18:27.000
the growth rate.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:49.000
So t or tao is the time lag
between sensing environments,

00:18:49.000 --> 00:19:00.000
and change in growth rate.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:05.370
So let's look at what that
means in terms of,

00:19:05.370 --> 00:19:10.862
this brings us to another level
of complexity.

00:19:10.862 --> 00:19:15.622
So let's look at the
possibilities here.

00:19:15.622 --> 00:19:21.236
So, with no lag,
we have our logistic equation,

00:19:21.236 --> 00:19:21.968
right?

00:19:21.968 --> 00:19:29.169
The population just reaches the
carrying capacity and levels

00:19:29.169 --> 00:19:31.000
off.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:37.031
With a very short lag,
and of course you have to play

00:19:37.031 --> 00:19:42.134
with this to understand what I
mean by short,

00:19:42.134 --> 00:19:49.094
long, and medium because you
have to change all the different

00:19:49.094 --> 00:19:50.369
parameters.

00:19:50.369 --> 00:19:56.517
But if you have a short lag,
what you get is an actual

00:19:56.517 --> 00:20:02.316
overshoot of the carrying
capacity in the near term

00:20:02.316 --> 00:20:08.000
because the feedback hasn't
kicked in.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.641
But then, it will come back and
it will level off at the

00:20:12.641 --> 00:20:14.160
carrying capacity.

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:18.632
If you have a medium lag,
you will often see something

00:20:18.632 --> 00:20:23.358
like this where you get a couple
of oscillations in here.

00:20:23.358 --> 00:20:28.000
But it levels off at the same
carrying capacity.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:33.694
And, a long lag,
you can end up with behavior

00:20:33.694 --> 00:20:40.164
that ultimately ends up in the
population crashing.

00:20:40.164 --> 00:20:45.082
And we don't have time to
analyze this,

00:20:45.082 --> 00:20:52.588
but at the end of the lecture
I'm going to come back to why

00:20:52.588 --> 00:21:01.000
this is so important in terms of
human population growth.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.927
And for those of you who are
interested in complex systems

00:21:03.927 --> 00:21:06.238
and chaos theory,
the logistic equation in its

00:21:06.238 --> 00:21:09.268
discrete form actually will go
chaotic for certain parameter

00:21:09.268 --> 00:21:09.628
values.

00:21:09.628 --> 00:21:12.247
And for a long time,
for those of you who don't know

00:21:12.247 --> 00:21:14.199
what I'm talking about,
just ignore me.

00:21:14.199 --> 00:21:16.664
And for those who are
interested ought to spend a

00:21:16.664 --> 00:21:18.000
minute on it.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.963
For a long time,
this equation goes into a state

00:21:22.963 --> 00:21:28.982
of sort of chaotic oscillations,
but that can be described

00:21:28.982 --> 00:21:30.566
mathematically.

00:21:30.566 --> 00:21:35.424
And for a long time,
ecologists kept looking at

00:21:35.424 --> 00:21:39.754
populations trying to see
whether, indeed,

00:21:39.754 --> 00:21:46.196
they were growing according to
this chaos theory and it hasn't

00:21:46.196 --> 00:21:51.687
really developed to anything,
but it was interesting.

00:21:51.687 --> 00:21:56.122
Chaos theory first started
coming to light;

00:21:56.122 --> 00:22:02.142
the sea collision was one of
the first that people started

00:22:02.142 --> 00:22:07.000
looking into,
coincidentally.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.144
But just because an equation
has certain properties,

00:22:11.144 --> 00:22:15.696
it doesn't mean that thing it's
trying to model has those

00:22:15.696 --> 00:22:16.590
properties.

00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:20.166
So that was a really
interesting development.

00:22:20.166 --> 00:22:23.254
OK, so let's go back to Pearl
and Reed.

00:22:23.254 --> 00:22:24.717
Where did they go?

00:22:24.717 --> 00:22:26.424
Oh, they're up there.

00:22:26.424 --> 00:22:30.000
OK, so this was all a
digression.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:37.294
So Pearl and Reed were looking
at the human population data,

00:22:37.294 --> 00:22:40.138
and trying to model it.

00:22:40.138 --> 00:22:47.680
And they showed that they had
this density dependent response.

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:54.109
They developed this equation in
order to describe it.

00:22:54.109 --> 00:23:01.403
And then, they looked at the
data again using this graphical

00:23:01.403 --> 00:23:04.000
formulation.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.059
So, let's look at that.

00:23:07.059 --> 00:23:12.646
We're just going to use the
graphic method,

00:23:12.646 --> 00:23:17.036
because it's easier to
illustrate.

00:23:17.036 --> 00:23:24.486
And now, we're looking at the
human population in the US,

00:23:24.486 --> 00:23:30.605
and this is one over N,
dN/dt, and this is N in

00:23:30.605 --> 00:23:33.000
millions.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:40.671
And so, they have some data
points that they put on here.

00:23:40.671 --> 00:23:43.547
This is 1800 to 1810.

00:23:43.547 --> 00:23:51.630
So, they have different data
points for different intervals,

00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:57.383
and their last point here was
1900 to 1910,

00:23:57.383 --> 00:24:03.000
an average of the population
size.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:08.491
And so, they projected down
here there were 100 million

00:24:08.491 --> 00:24:09.711
people then.

00:24:09.711 --> 00:24:13.881
So, they said,
so they asked the question:

00:24:13.881 --> 00:24:18.966
OK, we're modeling this
population, we're saying it

00:24:18.966 --> 00:24:25.067
grows according to the logistic
equation, we can predict what

00:24:25.067 --> 00:24:30.661
the carrying capacity in the
United States for humans by

00:24:30.661 --> 00:24:34.525
simply doing a regression
through this,

00:24:34.525 --> 00:24:39.000
and seeing where it intercepts.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:46.419
So, that should be the carrying
capacity.

00:24:46.419 --> 00:24:57.177
And they predicted that we'd
have 197 million when we reach

00:24:57.177 --> 00:25:02.000
the carrying capacity.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.345
And that was in the year 2030.

00:25:05.345 --> 00:25:11.701
So that was a prediction of
their model back in the 1920s,

00:25:11.701 --> 00:25:17.723
that the carrying capacity of
the US for humans was 197

00:25:17.723 --> 00:25:22.964
million, and that that would be
reached in 2030.

00:25:22.964 --> 00:25:26.309
Well, they missed it by a lot.

00:25:26.309 --> 00:25:33.000
So, let's look at the data,
which is not surprising.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.212
Here's 1965.

00:25:35.212 --> 00:25:42.217
We reached 200 million way
before 2030.

00:25:42.217 --> 00:25:49.039
1990, 250 million,
and actually today,

00:25:49.039 --> 00:25:58.256
at 10:45 this morning,
because I looked it up on my

00:25:58.256 --> 00:26:06.000
trusty population clock on the
Web,

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.409
we had 295,979,238 people.

00:26:09.409 --> 00:26:17.147
This is also done by modeling,
we're not counting people one

00:26:17.147 --> 00:26:18.459
at a time.

00:26:18.459 --> 00:26:25.934
But this website is keeping
track based on various models.

00:26:25.934 --> 00:26:31.573
And, based on the models that
we have today,

00:26:31.573 --> 00:26:38.000
in 2030 we should have about
345 million.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:43.498
But these models are based on
something entirely much more

00:26:43.498 --> 00:26:47.839
complex now than the simple
logistic equation.

00:26:47.839 --> 00:26:53.337
OK, so the contribution of
Pearl and Reed was to be yet to

00:26:53.337 --> 00:26:58.932
get people to start thinking
about the feedback mechanisms,

00:26:58.932 --> 00:27:04.623
how to model population growth,
and think about the feedback

00:27:04.623 --> 00:27:08.000
mechanisms in that model.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:13.771
You don't have that in your
handout, but it's not important.

00:27:13.771 --> 00:27:18.173
It's not on the web,
but if you care about it,

00:27:18.173 --> 00:27:24.336
there is the website that keeps
track of human population in the

00:27:24.336 --> 00:27:24.630
US.

00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:30.597
So, here's the total population
number that I got this morning

00:27:30.597 --> 00:27:35.000
at 10:14 and 17 seconds off the
web.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:39.853
And these are just some
interesting statistics for the

00:27:39.853 --> 00:27:45.347
US, and I have them for the last
three years: one birth every

00:27:45.347 --> 00:27:49.102
eight seconds,
one death every 13 seconds,

00:27:49.102 --> 00:27:54.322
one migrant every 26 seconds,
and a net gain of one person

00:27:54.322 --> 00:27:55.879
every 12 seconds.

00:27:55.879 --> 00:28:00.000
So they're keeping close track
here.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.718
OK, all right,
so now are going to move on to

00:28:03.718 --> 00:28:07.521
global population growth,
humans on the earth,

00:28:07.521 --> 00:28:09.718
the whole shoot and match.

00:28:09.718 --> 00:28:14.704
And, there's this wonderful
book for anyone who's interested

00:28:14.704 --> 00:28:18.507
by Joel Cohen,
called, How Many People Can the

00:28:18.507 --> 00:28:19.690
Earth Support?

00:28:19.690 --> 00:28:24.169
And, it's a great book for MIT
students because it's a

00:28:24.169 --> 00:28:26.366
wonderfully nerdy account.

00:28:26.366 --> 00:28:30.000
I'm a nerd, so I can say that.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.497
I'm a total nerd.

00:28:31.497 --> 00:28:35.284
But it's just a wonderful
account, analysis,

00:28:35.284 --> 00:28:40.480
if you analyze human population
growth, and at the same time

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:45.059
looking at the phenomenon in a
totally objective way.

00:28:45.059 --> 00:28:47.613
He's a theoretical ecologist.

00:28:47.613 --> 00:28:50.167
So, this is in your textbook.

00:28:50.167 --> 00:28:52.369
But, it's from this book.

00:28:52.369 --> 00:28:56.772
And, it's from 10,000 B.C.
up to here we are today,

00:28:56.772 --> 00:29:01.000
the population on Earth in
billions.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.942
And, this is back in the hunter
gatherer era.

00:29:04.942 --> 00:29:07.092
We had 4 million people.

00:29:07.092 --> 00:29:12.736
And this was a small revolution
at the time, the introduction of

00:29:12.736 --> 00:29:17.306
the agriculture and
domestication of animals allowed

00:29:17.306 --> 00:29:21.606
for higher birth rates,
and so had a little blip,

00:29:21.606 --> 00:29:23.936
went up to 7 million here.

00:29:23.936 --> 00:29:28.595
And then for a long time,
there was just no change in

00:29:28.595 --> 00:29:32.000
human population on Earth.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.675
And so then,
here you start to get,

00:29:35.675 --> 00:29:39.783
I'm not sure what started this
up rise.

00:29:39.783 --> 00:29:44.324
Maybe when we see the next
slide we'll see.

00:29:44.324 --> 00:29:48.000
No, I'm not sure what started
that.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.135
We'll have to look into that.

00:29:51.135 --> 00:29:57.405
Maybe just the accumulation of
people that you can't see on

00:29:57.405 --> 00:30:04.000
this scale, here's the bubonic
plague, a decrease.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.486
Here's the beginning of the
Industrial Revolution and the

00:30:08.486 --> 00:30:12.732
introduction of modern medicine,
which greatly reduced

00:30:12.732 --> 00:30:13.534
mortality.

00:30:13.534 --> 00:30:17.620
So, you see this incredible,
and here's fossil fuel,

00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:21.225
increase in the population of
humans on Earth.

00:30:21.225 --> 00:30:25.311
So, if you look at this curve,
you think, oh my God,

00:30:25.311 --> 00:30:31.000
we're in the middle of this
incredible exponential increase.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.529
And, the reality is this
doesn't fit at all in an

00:30:34.529 --> 00:30:36.367
exponential model at all.

00:30:36.367 --> 00:30:40.632
I mean, if you tried to fit
that to our simple exponential,

00:30:40.632 --> 00:30:41.808
it does not fit.

00:30:41.808 --> 00:30:46.000
We are going to explain what's
happening here in a minute.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.500
So here we are at 6 billion
people.

00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:50.632
And we hit 6 billion in 1999.

00:30:50.632 --> 00:30:53.426
And here we are with a steady
increase.

00:30:53.426 --> 00:30:55.926
I've just got the last three
years.

00:30:55.926 --> 00:31:01.000
This marks the lectures that
I've given in this class.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.947
Every year I check in and see
where we are.

00:31:03.947 --> 00:31:06.122
It's kind of a living document.

00:31:06.122 --> 00:31:10.122
And, we're now projected to
reach 9 billion and level off.

00:31:10.122 --> 00:31:14.263
When I first started teaching
about human population growth,

00:31:14.263 --> 00:31:16.649
the projections were at 12
billion.

00:31:16.649 --> 00:31:18.122
And I'm not that old.

00:31:18.122 --> 00:31:21.982
This number keeps changing,
and luckily it's changing in

00:31:21.982 --> 00:31:23.385
the right direction.

00:31:23.385 --> 00:31:27.245
We keep predicting fewer and
fewer humans before it will

00:31:27.245 --> 00:31:29.000
level off.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.995
But it's still 3 billion more
humans than we have now,

00:31:32.995 --> 00:31:37.292
and many people think now were
already beyond the carrying

00:31:37.292 --> 00:31:38.951
capacity of the Earth.

00:31:38.951 --> 00:31:43.097
So, I'm not saying not to
worry, I'm just saying that at

00:31:43.097 --> 00:31:46.037
least it's going in the right
direction.

00:31:46.037 --> 00:31:48.827
So, in Cohen's book,
he analyzes this,

00:31:48.827 --> 00:31:53.199
sort of the history of humans
on Earth as having four major

00:31:53.199 --> 00:31:57.496
evolutionary changes where you
have the dramatic change in

00:31:57.496 --> 00:31:58.853
population growth.

00:31:58.853 --> 00:32:03.000
You have local agriculture in
8000 B.C.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:07.941
And, the doubling time of the
population before and after

00:32:07.941 --> 00:32:13.147
those evolutions went from what
he estimates to be 40,000 to

00:32:13.147 --> 00:32:18.441
300,000 years for a population
to double down to 1000 to 3000

00:32:18.441 --> 00:32:21.441
years for the population to
double.

00:32:21.441 --> 00:32:25.235
In other words,
this is an incredibly faster

00:32:25.235 --> 00:32:30.000
growth rate, because this is
doubling times.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.158
And then, with global
agriculture in the 1700s,

00:32:34.158 --> 00:32:39.041
again you have a shortening of
the doubling time of the

00:32:39.041 --> 00:32:40.035
population.

00:32:40.035 --> 00:32:45.008
And then in the 50s with the
introduction of real public

00:32:45.008 --> 00:32:48.805
health across the world,
another reduction,

00:32:48.805 --> 00:32:53.054
and luckily in the 70s,
with the introduction of

00:32:53.054 --> 00:32:56.942
fertility control,
at least in the developed

00:32:56.942 --> 00:33:03.000
countries, is the first time you
actually see a shift.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:08.238
We've gone from growing faster,
and faster, and faster to

00:33:08.238 --> 00:33:10.951
actually growing more slowly.

00:33:10.951 --> 00:33:13.851
The doubling time is extending.

00:33:13.851 --> 00:33:18.809
So, the good news is we're not
in some kind of runaway

00:33:18.809 --> 00:33:23.487
population growth that's going
to continue forever.

00:33:23.487 --> 00:33:29.193
We've already peaked out as a
globe, and we are going to level

00:33:29.193 --> 00:33:32.000
off in terms humans.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.248
And the real big question is
when we level off,

00:33:36.248 --> 00:33:40.958
will we be above the carrying
capacity of the Earth?

00:33:40.958 --> 00:33:42.713
Have we overshot K?

00:33:42.713 --> 00:33:47.700
And we don't know yet because
these feedback mechanisms

00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:49.363
haven't come back.

00:33:49.363 --> 00:33:54.719
So, let's now analyze this a
little bit more before we look

00:33:54.719 --> 00:33:59.337
at it in that context,
because this is an important

00:33:59.337 --> 00:34:01.000
thing.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.241
First of all,
before we do that,

00:34:03.241 --> 00:34:07.219
I want to remind you that all
of these lectures are tied

00:34:07.219 --> 00:34:11.413
together because remember this
from lecture 20 when we were

00:34:11.413 --> 00:34:13.945
talking about biogeochemical
cycles?

00:34:13.945 --> 00:34:18.139
And, here's the same population
size and billions on Earth,

00:34:18.139 --> 00:34:19.296
the brown curve.

00:34:19.296 --> 00:34:22.695
It's smoothed over,
and these are the greenhouse

00:34:22.695 --> 00:34:26.022
gases, concentration of
greenhouse gases in the

00:34:26.022 --> 00:34:26.817
atmosphere.

00:34:26.817 --> 00:34:30.000
This is the human footprint.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.977
This is how we've changed the
metabolism of the Earth,

00:34:34.977 --> 00:34:38.171
by this explosive growth of
humans.

00:34:38.171 --> 00:34:43.994
And one more slide just showing
you that this is another way to

00:34:43.994 --> 00:34:49.535
look at it, showing that the
growth of the global population

00:34:49.535 --> 00:34:50.569
has peaked.

00:34:50.569 --> 00:34:54.795
So, over here,
each of these is the population

00:34:54.795 --> 00:35:00.243
in billions, and it basically
shows you the number of years

00:35:00.243 --> 00:35:04.000
necessary to add a billion.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:09.043
And you could see that it's
taking longer and longer to add

00:35:09.043 --> 00:35:09.913
a billion.

00:35:09.913 --> 00:35:14.260
You can see that there is an
inflection point here.

00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:18.608
So, using the tools that we've
developed to analyze

00:35:18.608 --> 00:35:23.652
populations, let's look at why
this growth is leveling off.

00:35:23.652 --> 00:35:30.000
What caused the growth to begin
with, and why it's leveling off?

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.928
And the really important
feature here is what's called a

00:35:34.928 --> 00:35:36.989
demographic transition.

00:35:36.989 --> 00:35:41.918
This is what we are going
through on the Earth right now

00:35:41.918 --> 00:35:45.054
in terms of human population
growth.

00:35:45.054 --> 00:35:50.073
And, the way we look at this,
we are planning birth rates

00:35:50.073 --> 00:35:54.374
here, which is the pink one,
and death rate here,

00:35:54.374 --> 00:35:56.435
which is the green one.

00:35:56.435 --> 00:36:01.902
And, when birth rates and death
rates are both uniformly high,

00:36:01.902 --> 00:36:07.279
which is the way it was back in
the early days when we didn't

00:36:07.279 --> 00:36:11.580
have fertility control,
and we didn't have modern

00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:14.000
medicine.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.703
So, you had a lot of babies and
a lot of people dying.

00:36:17.703 --> 00:36:20.497
And growth rate,
and so this is the total

00:36:20.497 --> 00:36:21.266
population.

00:36:21.266 --> 00:36:24.131
So, you don't have much
population growth.

00:36:24.131 --> 00:36:27.414
Then, what happens,
you get to a place where you

00:36:27.414 --> 00:36:30.000
have a very high birth rate.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:35.283
Birth rate continues to stay
high, but with the introduction

00:36:35.283 --> 00:36:38.597
of public health,
and modern medicine,

00:36:38.597 --> 00:36:42.716
we were able to keep people
alive a lot longer.

00:36:42.716 --> 00:36:46.835
And, that came in advance of
fertility control.

00:36:46.835 --> 00:36:50.955
So, what happens,
when these two curves deviate

00:36:50.955 --> 00:36:54.805
from one another,
you have explosive growth,

00:36:54.805 --> 00:37:00.000
and that's what this big
exponential shoot is.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.154
But then, if you then reduce
the birth rates through

00:37:04.154 --> 00:37:09.042
fertility control to match the
death rates, you then have low

00:37:09.042 --> 00:37:11.648
birth rates and low death rates.

00:37:11.648 --> 00:37:14.744
Then you have no population
growth, OK?

00:37:14.744 --> 00:37:19.061
So, it's very simple and
intuitive when you understand

00:37:19.061 --> 00:37:22.564
what's going on,
but I don't think that most

00:37:22.564 --> 00:37:27.533
people really have come to the
point of thinking about it like

00:37:27.533 --> 00:37:29.000
that.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:37.346
And where we are on Earth today
is the developed countries have

00:37:37.346 --> 00:37:42.865
gone through their demographic
transition.

00:37:42.865 --> 00:37:50.942
And you have a sense of that
just from looking at family size

00:37:50.942 --> 00:37:53.500
in these countries.

00:37:53.500 --> 00:38:00.096
So, if we look at,
this is Sweden as an example of

00:38:00.096 --> 00:38:04.000
a developed country.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.107
And this was 1800.

00:38:06.107 --> 00:38:08.097
And this is 2000.

00:38:08.097 --> 00:38:11.375
You see something like this.

00:38:11.375 --> 00:38:14.887
This is just an approximation.

00:38:14.887 --> 00:38:20.624
This is the birth rate and this
is the death rate,

00:38:20.624 --> 00:38:28.000
and the population growth rate
looks something like this.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:36.098
The populations leveled off
whereas if you look at a country

00:38:36.098 --> 00:38:43.921
like Egypt over the same time
frame, and you can get these

00:38:43.921 --> 00:38:51.470
curves off the web easily,
it looks something like this.

00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:56.000
You have a high birth rate.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:02.018
And death rate has gone down,
but they're not matching each

00:39:02.018 --> 00:39:03.367
other at all.

00:39:03.367 --> 00:39:07.415
So, population look something
like this.

00:39:07.415 --> 00:39:10.839
It hasn't even begun to level
off.

00:39:10.839 --> 00:39:16.235
So the real trick is,
in terms of trying to level off

00:39:16.235 --> 00:39:21.113
at someplace lower than 9
billion, is to get the

00:39:21.113 --> 00:39:27.235
birthrates in the developing
countries to drop as fast as we

00:39:27.235 --> 00:39:29.000
can.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:34.610
And that will determine the
level at which humans will level

00:39:34.610 --> 00:39:35.847
off on Earth.

00:39:35.847 --> 00:39:40.412
So, let's just briefly,
let me go back over here,

00:39:40.412 --> 00:39:44.691
and let's go back over this
carrying capacity.

00:39:44.691 --> 00:39:49.731
And this is basically what Joel
Cohen's book is about,

00:39:49.731 --> 00:39:53.821
where he says,
how many people can the Earth

00:39:53.821 --> 00:39:54.582
support?

00:39:54.582 --> 00:39:58.671
He's asking,
what's the carrying capacity of

00:39:58.671 --> 00:40:02.000
the earth for humans?

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:05.566
And here are the possibilities.

00:40:05.566 --> 00:40:09.938
And of course,
I'm simplifying the most

00:40:09.938 --> 00:40:17.185
complex system that we know into
a simple two-dimensional graph,

00:40:17.185 --> 00:40:22.362
but I think it's a good way to
think about it.

00:40:22.362 --> 00:40:28.000
Here's the way we've been
living on Earth.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:31.189
We have been growing like this.

00:40:31.189 --> 00:40:36.437
Granted, we're starting to
level off, but we've been

00:40:36.437 --> 00:40:38.289
growing like this.

00:40:38.289 --> 00:40:44.257
And what we've been assuming,
is that the carrying capacity

00:40:44.257 --> 00:40:46.418
will grow with us,
OK?

00:40:46.418 --> 00:40:52.282
We can handle as many humans as
we want to put because we,

00:40:52.282 --> 00:40:56.501
smart people,
with technology can increase

00:40:56.501 --> 00:41:00.000
the carrying capacity.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:04.795
If we don't have enough grain,
we'll genetically engineer to

00:41:04.795 --> 00:41:06.096
make more grain.

00:41:06.096 --> 00:41:08.371
We can fix it;
we can fix it,

00:41:08.371 --> 00:41:10.891
so let's just go with the flow.

00:41:10.891 --> 00:41:15.443
And indeed, technology has
greatly increased the carrying

00:41:15.443 --> 00:41:18.044
capacity of the earth for
humans.

00:41:18.044 --> 00:41:20.157
There's no doubt about it.

00:41:20.157 --> 00:41:22.596
But there's got to be a limit.

00:41:22.596 --> 00:41:26.091
So, is this the model that we
want to go by?

00:41:26.091 --> 00:41:29.179
So, some people argue,
so, the climate,

00:41:29.179 --> 00:41:33.000
we'll fix that with technology.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:37.932
We can fix any of this with
technology, and if things get

00:41:37.932 --> 00:41:42.336
really bad, we'll go to Mars;
we'll terraform Mars.

00:41:42.336 --> 00:41:44.362
We'll colonize planets.

00:41:44.362 --> 00:41:49.295
That's not that far-fetched,
so why should we worry about

00:41:49.295 --> 00:41:51.937
all these humans on the Earth?

00:41:51.937 --> 00:41:56.077
We'll just figure out,
we'll go out and find new

00:41:56.077 --> 00:41:56.694
places.

00:41:56.694 --> 00:41:58.455
So that's one model.

00:41:58.455 --> 00:42:02.243
Another model is,
if we're going to do this,

00:42:02.243 --> 00:42:07.000
here's what I call the
optimistic model.

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:15.606
Well, I guess this is the super
optimistic model.

00:42:15.606 --> 00:42:26.544
This one assumes that it'll do
something like this that we may

00:42:26.544 --> 00:42:28.337
overshoot.

00:42:28.337 --> 00:42:35.058
And then birth rates,
and if you want to you can

00:42:35.058 --> 00:42:39.649
easily describe a scenario that
says that we have overshot,

00:42:39.649 --> 00:42:44.160
that this whole environmental
movement, the measurement of

00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:47.643
toxins in our environment,
the global change,

00:42:47.643 --> 00:42:51.284
all of that is really
overshooting the carrying

00:42:51.284 --> 00:42:51.997
capacity.

00:42:51.997 --> 00:42:56.667
And we wouldn't be worrying
about things that we're worrying

00:42:56.667 --> 00:43:01.179
about if we hadn't overshot it,
but that if we get our act

00:43:01.179 --> 00:43:06.232
together,
we won't have eroded the

00:43:06.232 --> 00:43:13.775
Earth's natural system so much
that we can come back to a

00:43:13.775 --> 00:43:15.526
stable level.

00:43:15.526 --> 00:43:21.857
And then, of course,
the pessimistic scenario is

00:43:21.857 --> 00:43:25.628
that, indeed,
we've overshot,

00:43:25.628 --> 00:43:33.440
and we've overshot so much that
we have eroded the carrying

00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:38.577
capacity,
and that we will level off at

00:43:38.577 --> 00:43:44.088
some level that the Earth will
no longer be able to support the

00:43:44.088 --> 00:43:49.599
level of humans that it can even
support now, that we have lost

00:43:49.599 --> 00:43:53.777
so much topsoil,
and modern agriculture won't be

00:43:53.777 --> 00:43:57.688
able to overcome that,
that our water will be

00:43:57.688 --> 00:44:02.488
polluted, that the climate will
change so dramatically,

00:44:02.488 --> 00:44:05.866
the fisheries will be
eliminated, yada,

00:44:05.866 --> 00:44:08.000
yada, yada.

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:11.248
I shouldn't say yada,
yada, yada.

00:44:11.248 --> 00:44:14.294
Those are catastrophic things.

00:44:14.294 --> 00:44:16.832
Erase that from the tape!

00:44:16.832 --> 00:44:21.807
Every once in a while,
I remember I'm being taped.

00:44:21.807 --> 00:44:25.868
So, those are bad things,
not to be yada,

00:44:25.868 --> 00:44:28.000
yada, yada'd.

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:32.670
So, anyway, this is what some
people are worried about,

00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:35.178
that we are,
indeed right now,

00:44:35.178 --> 00:44:39.675
in your lifetime and in fact
mostly in your lifetime,

00:44:39.675 --> 00:44:44.345
you are inheriting this,
notice the time frames on this

00:44:44.345 --> 00:44:44.864
graph.

00:44:44.864 --> 00:44:49.535
I mean, this is just this
little snippet of time in the

00:44:49.535 --> 00:44:54.637
history of life on Earth where
all these dramatic things are

00:44:54.637 --> 00:44:55.502
happening.

00:44:55.502 --> 00:45:00.000
And we just happen to be living
in it.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:03.503
Just think if you're living
back here, and thousands and

00:45:03.503 --> 00:45:06.498
thousands of years went by,
and nothing changed.

00:45:06.498 --> 00:45:09.874
OK, so we don't have any
answers, but this is a way to

00:45:09.874 --> 00:45:12.805
think about it,
and a lot of people are putting

00:45:12.805 --> 00:45:16.563
a lot of energy into modeling
the systems, and try to figure

00:45:16.563 --> 00:45:19.239
out where we are the scariest
trajectories.

00:45:19.239 --> 00:45:22.233
So, the next two lectures
Professor Martin Polz,

00:45:22.233 --> 00:45:25.864
who is a professor in civil and
environmental engineering,

00:45:25.864 --> 00:45:29.496
and the microbiologist is going
to come in and talk to you

00:45:29.496 --> 00:45:33.000
about, again,
its population economy.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.757
He'll talk to you about
population genetics,

00:45:35.757 --> 00:45:39.669
and some really exciting work
that's going on in the field now

00:45:39.669 --> 00:45:42.876
using genomics to decipher
evolution and population

00:45:42.876 --> 00:45:43.389
biology.

00:45:43.389 --> 00:45:46.788
And then I'll be back with some
really neat DVD clips.

00:45:46.788 --> 00:45:47.788
So, come back.
