00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:06.420
I'm here to talk to you about a topic that sort of summarizes what we do in my lab.

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.680
That's sort of lumped together under

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.680
this title of The Mechanical Side of Artificial Intelligence.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.010
So I'm going to start off with a few definitions first to get us on the same page.

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:21.940
And then I'm going to jump into, the best way I think I can describe our work is by example.

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:25.865
And so I'm just going to go through three examples from our work that I think highlights

00:00:25.865 --> 00:00:28.120
the themes that I want to get across in this sort

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.165
of notion of the mechanical side of artificial intelligence.

00:00:31.165 --> 00:00:33.190
So to start off,

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.250
let's start with a definition that you're probably familiar with,

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.020
which is the sort of maybe now classical side of artificial intelligence,

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.110
which is basically having computers, robots,

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.750
machines able to perform tasks,

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.175
which would normally involve the level of intelligence of a human.

00:00:51.175 --> 00:00:52.900
So things in terms of perception,

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.920
autonomy control, that would normally require human intervention.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.970
So this is a very old concept,

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.735
coined just down the streets at MIT.

00:01:01.735 --> 00:01:03.665
So, that's not what we do,

00:01:03.665 --> 00:01:05.920
so in my lab we do kind of the other side of this,

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.660
which again we call the mechanical side of artificial intelligence.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:13.360
To contrast  this, this is developing new technologies,

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.340
new robot platforms specifically,

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.905
which make these questions of perception autonomy and control

00:01:17.905 --> 00:01:21.215
easier by virtue of their mechanical design,

00:01:21.215 --> 00:01:25.040
their material systems, their manufacturing strategies etc.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.510
So we're really thinking about,

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:32.580
let's build new robots that can make these sort of higher order AI concepts.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.060
Make those things easier.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.220
So how do we do that? So, that's what I'm

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.410
going to talk about for the rest of this discussion.

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.360
Well one of the things I want to point your attention to,

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.265
is that this concept is not new.

00:01:42.265 --> 00:01:47.300
In fact, I'll argue towards the end of this discussion that this is actually much,

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:52.560
much older than what we think about usually today, is artificial intelligence.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.320
Okay. So, let's jump right in.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.380
So I'm going to illustrate,

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.945
as I said through examples and the examples I'm going to give

00:01:58.945 --> 00:02:02.275
are in these three categories: Robotic insects,

00:02:02.275 --> 00:02:06.365
soft robotics in particular soft robotics for deep sea applications,

00:02:06.365 --> 00:02:10.815
and then I'll talk about some more recent work in developing an entirely soft robot.

00:02:10.815 --> 00:02:14.445
So let's jump right in. Robotic insects, what do I mean by this?

00:02:14.445 --> 00:02:16.550
One good example of this,

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.180
is this device here which we call the RoboBee.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:25.425
So this is a 80 milligram device which is supposed to mimic the key functions of bees.

00:02:25.425 --> 00:02:27.710
And when I say this is relatively low level.

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.444
So just understanding flight behaviors,

00:02:30.444 --> 00:02:34.960
understanding fluid mechanics being able to translate these into bio inspired designs.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.690
Understanding how we can overcome obstacles in terms of,

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.150
how do we manufacture things at small scales?

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.205
How do we develop actuators that mimic

00:02:42.205 --> 00:02:46.240
the muscle function and structure that we see in natural systems?

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.770
How do we understand what sensors and

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.890
sensor modalities we'd want to have for given tasks?

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.210
How do we understand new computational architectures that would really satisfy the size,

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:57.810
weight and power constraints imposed by such a system?

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.400
Then eventually on to power systems,

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.550
power storage energy distribution within this device.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.440
Then finally thinking about having lots of

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.100
these things do interesting things in aggregate.

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.850
I'm not going to talk much about the application side.

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.150
Why would we do this?

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.690
The answer might be very sort of unsatisfying in the sense that,

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.400
the motivations from a sort of

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.210
task perspective or an application perspective are going to be basically the same thing,

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:25.460
that anybody that's developing an autonomous robot is going to tell you.

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:28.960
So basically, you put these things where you wouldn't want to put a human or an animal.

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.090
Tasks that are repetitive, dangerous,

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.800
whatever, that's where these things might find application.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.575
Maybe you can go beyond,

00:03:35.575 --> 00:03:39.810
what you might typically see with PackBots and Roombas and the like.

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.325
By thinking about these things is very small, very agile,

00:03:42.325 --> 00:03:43.930
being able to get into nooks and crannies,

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.120
that you might not be able to get into otherwise,

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:51.055
maybe you can motivate things by having lots of distributed systems, distributed agents,

00:03:51.055 --> 00:03:54.600
which could increase the effectiveness of coverage or efficiency of coverage,

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.710
graceful degradation of failure and maybe

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:59.695
these things can be made so cheap that they could be disposable.

00:03:59.695 --> 00:04:01.350
But am I going to talk about all of that.

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.090
Really, what drives us,

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.160
what motivates us, is not those things.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.080
It's really the technological exploration that has to come about,

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:10.400
if we want to really do this.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.400
I will try to allude to this throughout,

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.260
but and this is something that's directly relevant to our role in this institute,

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.160
is we're constantly trying to figure out if we can solve some of these things.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.670
If we can answer some of these questions.

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:25.500
Then what are those solutions good for outside of this context.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.300
So, I'll try to allude to this throughout, but for example,

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:34.290
if we can resolve issues in micro fabrication and small scale actuation incensing.

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:37.240
Then maybe we can make small scale surgical devices.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.275
Better and more effective, more dexterous,

00:04:39.275 --> 00:04:42.235
more feedback to the surgeon and we're doing that as well.

00:04:42.235 --> 00:04:44.140
As part of this project,

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:45.840
as I said, we have to answer all these questions.

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.135
The first question that we had was,

00:04:48.135 --> 00:04:51.740
how can we build something at these scales?

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.300
On one end of the spectrum,

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.850
we have MEMS (micro electromechanical systems) and techniques that are derived from

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:01.690
the integrated circuit industry for the last five, six decades.

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:05.945
That provide us with a suite of tools on micrometres or sub- micrometre,

00:05:05.945 --> 00:05:08.210
sort of size scales.

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.920
We don't really want to go that direction.

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.400
It fits the sort of need in terms of the scales that we're interested in,

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.270
but it limits us in other ways.

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.875
It limits us in terms of the suite of materials that we can use,

00:05:19.875 --> 00:05:22.950
the sort of dimensionality of the structures we can build,

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:24.300
you know two and a half dimensional.

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:25.830
Maybe we can get out of,

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.290
more sort of surface and bulk micro machining processes,

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:29.325
but we really want to create

00:05:29.325 --> 00:05:32.420
rich three dimensional objects with all sorts of degrees of freedom,

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:37.130
articulation etc., as you would have in the organisms that inspire some of this work.

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:39.750
Most importantly, which is a theme that will come

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:42.630
up over and over again in this discussion is,

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.970
if we want to be able to build these things,

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:46.650
we really don't understand them.

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.270
We really don't understand,

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.505
despite our best efforts and all the modeling that we could put on these things,

00:05:51.505 --> 00:05:54.600
the best way we can understand these systems is by build and test,

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.970
build and test and often to failure.

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:59.150
So we really have to have a process which is,

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.950
a manufacturing strategy which is going to give us the ability to

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:04.780
manufacture things on the order of days.

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:08.540
Whereas more MEMS type processes might be on the order of months.

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:12.585
So that's may be the most important distinction here.

00:06:12.585 --> 00:06:14.670
Okay, so that's one end of the spectrum.

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:16.560
On the other end of the spectrum,

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:22.335
I'm sort of illustrating the construction of an assembly of a internal combustion engine.

00:06:22.335 --> 00:06:24.600
I don't want to operate in this regime either.

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.900
I don't want to be assembling thousands of

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.365
arbitrarily shaped components with

00:06:30.365 --> 00:06:34.165
feature sizes ranging from micrometres to centimeter, under a microscope.

00:06:34.165 --> 00:06:36.270
Consider this sort of the nuts and bolts approach to this.

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:38.700
So I don't want to do that for reasons of yield

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:42.300
and complexity and maybe this is sort of intuitive.

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:43.740
But I'm going to contradict myself,

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:46.080
because this is exactly how we started doing this.

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.850
Another way to describe this would be

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:51.030
the graduate student with tweezers manufacturing strategy,

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:52.840
which pissed off a lot of graduate students.

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:58.680
It is really not conducive to building things on this very sort of short time scale.

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.100
It takes a tremendous amount of skill.

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:06.240
This is basically one of my former graduate students that has a surgeon like skill,

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.860
and able to do this under a dissection microscope.

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:13.605
All of these pieces if you can tell are some millimetre or millimeter sort of range,

00:07:13.605 --> 00:07:15.150
and there are complex objects.

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:18.765
It's not Lego type system where you can just sort of click things together.

00:07:18.765 --> 00:07:24.840
So this has a lot of problems but really the main problem with this is,

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:27.010
if you were to do things in this way,

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:30.960
where it might take the most skilled students that I've had in

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:35.220
my lab in terms of sort of physical skill and spatial reasoning,

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:38.030
all this, it takes him

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:40.840
a few weeks to assemble something like this.

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:44.320
The problem is then these devices become precious and it doesn't really allow us

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:48.240
to explore the rich design space that we would otherwise really want to explore.

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:52.220
So, we set out to change this and explore new options.

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:54.450
So, this is, I think, really where one of

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:57.955
the first examples of this concept of mechanical intelligence.

00:07:57.955 --> 00:08:01.640
How can we embody all of the motions that were

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:05.780
being conducted by that student as he assembled that device?

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:07.955
How can we embody them within

00:08:07.955 --> 00:08:10.295
a composite structure and have this

00:08:10.295 --> 00:08:13.180
all do all of these complex assembly procedures for us?

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:16.375
So for that, we took inspiration from two places,

00:08:16.375 --> 00:08:22.035
the first was Nobel laureate Richard Feynman who back in the late 50s was

00:08:22.035 --> 00:08:28.185
prophecizing the many aspects of micro robotics and micro machines in general,

00:08:28.185 --> 00:08:31.720
talking about the economies of scale that you would get as you shrink down in size,

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:35.000
talking about small systems building other small systems,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.805
building replicas of themselves.

00:08:36.805 --> 00:08:40.145
So, tiny hands building robots,

00:08:40.145 --> 00:08:43.290
and so that was one piece of inspiration that we had.

00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:45.730
The other piece of inspiration was from my son

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:49.435
who at the time was very much into pop-up books.

00:08:49.435 --> 00:08:54.155
So, you could think about pop-up books as being these, everybody is played with these,

00:08:54.155 --> 00:08:59.800
these fantastically complicated structures that come about by very simple means,

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:02.400
very very simple actuation, if you will.

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:04.080
You unfold something, you push something,

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:05.325
you pull something and out pops,

00:09:05.325 --> 00:09:07.595
these really fantastically complicated structures, right?

00:09:07.595 --> 00:09:10.190
This gave rise to this assembly paradigm that we

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:13.160
call pop-up book MEMS which is illustrated here.

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:16.465
So, now we have this device which is sort of in the middle here,

00:09:16.465 --> 00:09:19.190
you can kind of see what's happening is we have this sort of

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:22.480
device that we want and around it we have this thing we called

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:25.570
an assembly scaffold which is basically just a set of linkage mechanisms

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:28.050
which if I want to wing over here and

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:30.925
an actuator over here and a transmission mechanism over here,

00:09:30.925 --> 00:09:32.980
then I can build those.

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:39.865
The articulation, the motion that is involved with linking those components by folding.

00:09:39.865 --> 00:09:41.840
So, that's exactly what you're seeing here,

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:45.790
is what happens is we create this structure,

00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:48.270
I'm not going to have time to go into all the details of how we do this,

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:54.580
but we basically take a bulk micro machining process where we take individual layers.

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:56.390
These individual layers can be anything,

00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:57.460
they can be metal, ceramics,

00:09:57.460 --> 00:09:59.290
polymers, composites, it doesn't really matter.

00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:05.530
We use a non-contact direct right laser machining process to make patterns,

00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:07.110
to make cuts on these individual layers of

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:09.720
relatively thin materials and then we stack these materials together,

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:13.775
create a laminated structure which is what you are seeing as the video progressed.

00:10:13.775 --> 00:10:17.290
This structure then had many many layers, so 10, 20,

00:10:17.290 --> 00:10:21.110
30, 40 layers of these constituent materials.

00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:23.480
Within this, we can also make these parallel devices,

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:26.670
we can make mechanisms by folding.

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:31.185
So, that's a very simple concept but the implementation of it is basically,

00:10:31.185 --> 00:10:34.690
if I have rigid materials surrounding a compliant material,

00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:37.300
that compliant material then describes a fold,

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:40.160
describes a region, a weakened region,

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:43.420
that we can then array however we want throughout this device,

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:45.225
and then create these linkage mechanisms

00:10:45.225 --> 00:10:47.160
which then can create arbitrary degrees of freedom.

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.150
So, I can get anything, think back to

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:54.180
the most complex pop-up book mechanism that you've ever seen, we can do that,

00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:55.385
but we can do that now,

00:10:55.385 --> 00:10:57.835
that arbitrary scales to very small,

00:10:57.835 --> 00:10:59.150
even smaller than what I'm showing you,

00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:01.390
to arbitrarily large if you'd want,

00:11:01.390 --> 00:11:03.605
although there's better ways to do things the larger scales.

00:11:03.605 --> 00:11:05.810
So, this has a number of nice features.

00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:09.490
The features that this has are we can create anything,

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:14.095
any complex mechanism or device and this is not just hand way view,

00:11:14.095 --> 00:11:15.120
we can actually prove this.

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:19.270
In fact, we work with some computational origamists at MIT Erik Demaine,

00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:22.855
Daniela Rus who we spent a lot of time talking with about

00:11:22.855 --> 00:11:24.785
these types of processes and it turns out

00:11:24.785 --> 00:11:27.080
that it's provable that you can make any mechanism you want,

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:28.510
any structure or any mechanism you want,

00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:30.065
by this process of folding.

00:11:30.065 --> 00:11:32.270
So, that's one nice thing. Another nice thing I

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:34.495
already told you is that we can include any material you want.

00:11:34.495 --> 00:11:36.310
One question that I often get is well why don't you

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:38.240
3D print these devices you want to make.

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:39.945
That's a good question.

00:11:39.945 --> 00:11:42.490
Some of the challenges associated with scale aside,

00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:46.355
3D printing techniques are typically limited in terms of the types of materials you

00:11:46.355 --> 00:11:50.345
can have and the material diversity you can have within a given parts.

00:11:50.345 --> 00:11:52.560
This is not so. So, we can have

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:56.020
any arbitrary material combination you want and in fact in the video,

00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:58.640
you saw I didn't point it out but within

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:01.325
this layered structure are the muscles for this device.

00:12:01.325 --> 00:12:07.190
So, we use piezoelectric actuators and they're buried within the layers of this device.

00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:09.295
Related to that is these things,

00:12:09.295 --> 00:12:10.830
you could be scratching your head and saying,

00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:12.950
well you're basically just making

00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:15.825
a multilayer printed circuit board then folding it and that's exactly what we were doing.

00:12:15.825 --> 00:12:17.930
So, we can actually have circuits pattern

00:12:17.930 --> 00:12:20.125
directly onto the surfaces of these things and create

00:12:20.125 --> 00:12:22.515
complex electromechanical devices that

00:12:22.515 --> 00:12:25.485
require no post assembly in their three dimensional shape.

00:12:25.485 --> 00:12:27.940
Scale invariance, and so I think I hit all the highlights.

00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:30.860
So, this allows us to build devices like this,

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:35.955
this is a few years old now but this particular design was quite successful.

00:12:35.955 --> 00:12:38.210
The next challenge then was design,

00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:39.495
I'm going to sort of gloss over this

00:12:39.495 --> 00:12:42.355
because I don't have time to tell you the chronology of this,

00:12:42.355 --> 00:12:44.840
it basically, with this process,

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:46.765
with these types of processes in hand,

00:12:46.765 --> 00:12:49.430
now we can make devices like this in a matter of hours.

00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:51.045
I'm exaggerating a little bit, but not really,

00:12:51.045 --> 00:12:52.670
I mean it's a very quick process to be able to build

00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:54.500
these types of devices and certainly a very minimal

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:58.280
manual labor or you can go back to the very manual if you want,

00:12:58.280 --> 00:12:59.705
but we can build these things very quickly.

00:12:59.705 --> 00:13:02.515
So, we've iterated over

00:13:02.515 --> 00:13:05.845
dozens and dozens and dozens of generations of these types of

00:13:05.845 --> 00:13:09.295
devices in trying to figure out how do we understand?

00:13:09.295 --> 00:13:11.085
How do we move the wings through the air?

00:13:11.085 --> 00:13:15.485
Do we just do biomimicry and try to recreate the types of

00:13:15.485 --> 00:13:20.550
motions and types of morphologies that we see in natural systems in flying insects.

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:23.160
By the way, bees is just a metaphor,

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:25.230
it's supposed to invoke the social insect nature,

00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:26.895
these are more like flies actually,

00:13:26.895 --> 00:13:30.120
flies being the only order of insects which actually have two wings.

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:32.040
That was chosen partially for

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:35.265
their agility but also partially because two wings are easier than four.

00:13:35.265 --> 00:13:36.420
So, then the question of design.

00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:39.710
So how do we actually think about designing these systems?

00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:41.910
This is a very simple device.

00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:47.735
The way that it works is I cut the robot down the middle and I have

00:13:47.735 --> 00:13:50.280
an actuator in either side and that actuator is

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:53.780
basically just a little artificial muscle that's doing this.

00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:58.190
That very small motion is then mapped through a flexer based transmission mechanism,

00:13:58.190 --> 00:14:00.400
it's just a gearbox without the gears,

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:03.155
because those wouldn't work and I'd be happy to tell you that offline.

00:14:03.155 --> 00:14:07.865
Then that flap, that little motion then gets amplified into this large flapping motion.

00:14:07.865 --> 00:14:11.300
Then the second, I think interesting sort

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:14.650
of connection to this concept is the mechanical side of artificial intelligence is,

00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:17.715
that's a lot of passivity in this device.

00:14:17.715 --> 00:14:21.010
So, when I started thinking about how do we build a device like this?

00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:23.785
We worked with biologists and the biologist said, "Well,

00:14:23.785 --> 00:14:27.135
you have two wings and each wing should do this sort of

00:14:27.135 --> 00:14:31.270
flapping motion and this wing rotational motion."

00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:34.040
So, I'm an ignorant roboticist, I just thought, "Okay,

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:35.770
well that means two degrees of freedom,

00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:37.125
two actuators per wing."

00:14:37.125 --> 00:14:41.345
But it turns out that's it's not a very efficient way to do this because as you're

00:14:41.345 --> 00:14:43.540
actuating these devices and we happen to actuate

00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:45.790
them at resonance for purposes of efficiency,

00:14:45.790 --> 00:14:46.900
it turns out you have a two input,

00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:48.345
two output system that you're operating,

00:14:48.345 --> 00:14:50.990
at one of the resonate modes and it turns out you'd be going to be throwing away

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:53.940
energy into the other resonate mode if you do that.

00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:59.315
So anyways, we actually use a lot of passive modes in these devices.

00:14:59.315 --> 00:15:01.510
One of the passive modes is this rotation.

00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:06.270
So, we actuate this motion and allow this to be passive and just tune,

00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:08.225
this is mediated by a little flex of your hands,

00:15:08.225 --> 00:15:11.545
your little fold at the base of the wing that you probably can't really see here.

00:15:11.545 --> 00:15:13.805
By tuning the inertia of the wing,

00:15:13.805 --> 00:15:17.980
the axis of rotation of the wing and the stiffness of this fracture,

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:21.985
we can get this quasi-static rotation modes

00:15:21.985 --> 00:15:25.945
tuned to the appropriate phase relative to flapping to generate optimal lift.

00:15:25.945 --> 00:15:28.090
It turns out after we did this, we realized,

00:15:28.090 --> 00:15:30.210
we looked back at the biological literature and there's

00:15:30.210 --> 00:15:32.690
a lot of evidence that flies do the exact same thing.

00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:35.230
So, I'm not going to talk a lot about

00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:39.540
that aspect which I just alluded to the fact that we can start to use

00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:42.170
these bio inspired devices to reverse the error of

00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:44.810
bio inspiration and start to use these things to tease

00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:47.420
out biological hypotheses in ways that would be difficult with

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:50.360
the animal but that's an example perhaps of that.

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:52.585
So, this is illustrating what I just said about

00:15:52.585 --> 00:15:55.900
the ability to individually address each wing.

00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:59.500
So, then the way that this works, is I flapped these things and it's basically like

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:04.305
an amplitude modulation scheme with a cross product with the way a helicopter flies.

00:16:04.305 --> 00:16:07.950
So, the way that that works is I can control,

00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:09.150
I flap these things at resonance,

00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:10.750
so I don't change the frequency of operation,

00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:12.690
I just create bilaterally

00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:15.330
asymmetric amplitude changes which

00:16:15.330 --> 00:16:18.500
then if I have a fixed frequency and change the amplitude,

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:20.120
I'm changing the velocity of the wing,

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:23.430
the lift force generated goes as velocity squared roughly,

00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:30.315
so then I can do force modulation independently on each wing to create body torques.

00:16:30.315 --> 00:16:31.905
The way I do that is by,

00:16:31.905 --> 00:16:34.450
if I have a larger amplitude on one side than the other,

00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:37.130
then I have a larger force on one side than the other, so I do this, right?

00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:40.390
If I have, if I sort of bias

00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:44.575
my motion for after with respect to the center of mass of the robot,

00:16:44.575 --> 00:16:46.015
then I got a pitching motion.

00:16:46.015 --> 00:16:47.970
Then yaw is a little bit more tricky,

00:16:47.970 --> 00:16:50.115
I basically have to keep the frequency

00:16:50.115 --> 00:16:52.970
fixed and have a faster downstroke than an upstroke.

00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:54.275
So, I get the sort of paddling,

00:16:54.275 --> 00:16:56.055
I'm not doing right, like that.

00:16:56.055 --> 00:16:58.350
I get this paddling motion with asymmetric drag.

00:16:58.350 --> 00:17:00.335
All right. So, I can build these devices.

00:17:00.335 --> 00:17:02.530
I told you about how we design them.

00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:08.775
So, this is an illustration of the thorax if you will, of these devices.

00:17:08.775 --> 00:17:12.430
This is something by a former graduate student who is trying

00:17:12.430 --> 00:17:17.130
to inject more control degrees of freedom in the device.

00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:18.790
So in order to do this,

00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:20.950
he was adding in things like,

00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:23.620
I don't remember all of the numbers here but there is, I think,

00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:25.315
four parallel four bars,

00:17:25.315 --> 00:17:27.420
two spherical four bars,

00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:31.590
and two spherical five bars all within a couple of cubic millimeters.

00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:34.635
So, this is and then you can see this in this device.

00:17:34.635 --> 00:17:37.880
So, you get a sense of the rich topological complexity

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:41.125
and mechanism complexity we can achieve using these devices.

00:17:41.125 --> 00:17:44.520
It's hard to see because thanks to James Weaver for making this image.

00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:45.855
But you can't see the materials here.

00:17:45.855 --> 00:17:47.875
But there is carbon fiber, and there is titanium,

00:17:47.875 --> 00:17:49.630
and there is poly-amides,

00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:52.125
and all host of other materials.

00:17:52.125 --> 00:17:54.460
Okay. So, we can make these things.

00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:58.120
Hopefully, you're convinced now that we can make these sort of complex devices,

00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:00.105
bio-inspired devices on these scales.

00:18:00.105 --> 00:18:02.350
The next thing that we turned to in

00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:05.955
this project is how do we actually think about flight control for these things.

00:18:05.955 --> 00:18:07.410
So, I haven't really told you about that yet

00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:10.045
but we've spent quite a bit of time trying to

00:18:10.045 --> 00:18:12.075
understand the fluid mechanics associated with flapping

00:18:12.075 --> 00:18:14.600
wing flights, structure function relationships.

00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:16.085
How do we understand how to design a wing?

00:18:16.085 --> 00:18:18.855
Is an insect wing exactly what we should be doing?

00:18:18.855 --> 00:18:21.590
There's a huge morphological diversity within insect wings.

00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:23.815
In fact, that's how insects are classified by the wing shape.

00:18:23.815 --> 00:18:25.935
So, I mean to some extent.

00:18:25.935 --> 00:18:27.590
So, how do we actually think about

00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:29.420
understanding fluid mechanics? I'm not going to tell you about that.

00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:33.090
But we've spent a lot of time developing strategies both numerically,

00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:36.250
analytically, and experimentally to understand that.

00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:38.300
So, we can control wing motions.

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:39.680
We can control fluid forces.

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:42.060
Now, the question is how do we control body attitudes?

00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:45.240
We've done this through this schematic here,

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:48.080
just shows the architecture that we have,

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:50.355
which is doing things off board.

00:18:50.355 --> 00:18:53.120
So, having an off-board set in  motion capture cameras.

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:56.250
You can think about this is the same thing that is used in CGI, right?

00:18:56.250 --> 00:19:02.120
To the mix Gollum and I'm forgetting the names from the new Star Wars movie.

00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:06.340
But with all of them where they wear suits of little retro reflective markers,

00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:07.855
and then move around,

00:19:07.855 --> 00:19:09.490
and then be recreated in CGI.

00:19:09.490 --> 00:19:11.010
So, it's the same environment,

00:19:11.010 --> 00:19:12.220
but now it's shrunk down,

00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:15.930
and these little markers are now on our little robots.

00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:18.260
So, that's what it looks like in reality.

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:21.070
You can't really see what's going on here, but there's the robot.

00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:22.820
If I do this now,

00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:25.310
thinking about what control actually means for these things,

00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:27.540
if I just plug these things in and turn them on,

00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:28.750
this is what happens, right?

00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:31.545
So, these are open loop flights.

00:19:31.545 --> 00:19:33.960
This is slow down by a factor of eight.

00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:37.480
I'm showing this to illustrate two things or three things.

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:41.935
One is that the open loop dynamics are very fast.

00:19:41.935 --> 00:19:44.085
So, I'll show you this in real time in a minute.

00:19:44.085 --> 00:19:47.035
I'll show to you now. So, this is that real time.

00:19:47.035 --> 00:19:49.420
So, open loop dynamics are really fast, which is good.

00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:50.560
We want to take advantage of that.

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:53.620
The open loop dynamics are unstable, which is also good.

00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:54.740
We want to take advantage of that.

00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:59.105
Insects are the fighter jets of the animal kingdom, right?

00:19:59.105 --> 00:20:01.635
I mean you've seen these things if you try to swat a fly, you know this.

00:20:01.635 --> 00:20:06.075
They operates very dissimilar to a passenger jet

00:20:06.075 --> 00:20:08.950
where in the absence of active controls

00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:11.930
if the pilot takes his or her hand off of the stick,

00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:15.700
it should, by virtue of positive wing dihedral,

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:18.840
it should remain with a stable attitude.

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:23.140
So, the antithesis of that are of many flying insects.

00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:25.420
So, it's operating on

00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:28.185
the other end of that spectrum and we want to take advantage of that.

00:20:28.185 --> 00:20:31.980
But nonetheless, we still need to be able to stabilize this unstable system.

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:34.160
So, I won't get into the details of how we do this.

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:36.470
It dives deep into some control theory.

00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:38.160
There's some really interesting aspects of this,

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:39.940
and some not so interesting aspects of this.

00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:42.980
But it turns out using this architecture,

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:45.145
we can prototype whatever controller you want.

00:20:45.145 --> 00:20:47.295
The key things here are latencies.

00:20:47.295 --> 00:20:52.410
So, between perception information that's coming in this case from motion capture,

00:20:52.410 --> 00:20:55.110
but we also have on-board sensors that we can put on now as well.

00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:59.420
Keeping the latency down between that information and your actuation is key.

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:00.740
But if you do that well,

00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:02.075
then you can do things like this.

00:21:02.075 --> 00:21:04.580
Hovering is really particularly challenging because as I said before,

00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:06.090
in the absence of active control,

00:21:06.090 --> 00:21:08.185
this thing is just going to fly out of control.

00:21:08.185 --> 00:21:10.095
In the absence of forward flights,

00:21:10.095 --> 00:21:11.780
there's no hope of passive stability here.

00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:12.860
So, you really have to be active.

00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:15.120
That last half second there are actually just

00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:18.250
illustrated one of the nice things about operating at these scales.

00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:20.515
You can crush these things all you want and they're not going to break.

00:21:20.515 --> 00:21:23.160
So, larger systems, certainly human sized vehicles,

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:25.920
but even these small drones and UAVs,

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:29.430
you even come close to a wall and they're going to shatter, right?

00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:32.630
So, not so in these cases and this is due to the physics of scaling.

00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:34.030
I'm happy to talk to you about that offline.

00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:37.900
We can also get much more aggressive with these types of maneuvers.

00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:40.190
This is something called iterative learning control

00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:42.640
where by the fact that we can crash these things,

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:44.595
we don't care about crashing these things.

00:21:44.595 --> 00:21:47.450
I'm exaggerating a little bit, but we don't really care about crashing these things.

00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:53.310
So, we can try to do these aggressive maneuvers where this is trial eight or seven.

00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:57.020
In the first seven or eight of these things have failed. They crash into the wall.

00:21:57.020 --> 00:22:00.130
But you learn from understanding

00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:04.320
the dynamics of those crashes of those failures how to actually do this well.

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:06.125
A little bit more recently,

00:22:06.125 --> 00:22:08.260
we've actually taken advantages

00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:11.260
of the relatively high payload that we have for these systems,

00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:14.540
and develop some perching strategies that leverage

00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:16.870
active electrode adhesives that we put on the top of

00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:20.005
the device and allows us to go and perch on whatever we want.

00:22:20.005 --> 00:22:22.550
So, the motivation here is simple is basically

00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:26.680
the energetics of flight at this scale are so power hungry,

00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:30.280
so energetically expensive that you're not going to fly around for too

00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:34.245
long without expending your battery or whatever power source you have.

00:22:34.245 --> 00:22:37.560
So, perching strategies make a lot of sense for any real mission.

00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:39.890
Okay. So, I'm going to shift gears here.

00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:42.320
So, I should say a few words about where this project is,

00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:43.515
just in case you're curious.

00:22:43.515 --> 00:22:45.220
You'll notice that all of these videos had

00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:47.390
a tether and they all had external motion capture.

00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:50.770
You can make batteries that are they can fit on board.

00:22:50.770 --> 00:22:54.169
Just yesterday we got the control electronics

00:22:54.169 --> 00:22:58.185
and control board that will go on board that are being integrated as we speak.

00:22:58.185 --> 00:23:00.860
So, hopefully those challenges will be resolved,

00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:04.760
and the tether will be cut and fully autonomous sometime in the near future.

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:06.400
By the way, has anybody seen Black Mirror?

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:08.345
So, you're probably like, ''Why the hell are you doing this?

00:23:08.345 --> 00:23:10.545
This is crazy.'' Right. So, yeah.

00:23:10.545 --> 00:23:14.920
These are 30 40 years away from anything remotely practical,

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:17.205
let alone doing harm.

00:23:17.205 --> 00:23:20.320
Another device that is a little bit more mature but

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:23.880
relies on some of the same strategies that I just described is this device.

00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:27.155
It is very similar actuation strategies to make small-legged devices.

00:23:27.155 --> 00:23:30.875
These things have a number of nice features that we can make them fully autonomous.

00:23:30.875 --> 00:23:34.775
They have fairly high payloads which is actually not surprising given

00:23:34.775 --> 00:23:38.680
their biological inspiration also has very high payloads relative to their weight.

00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:41.615
They actually turn out to be some of the fastest robots on earth,

00:23:41.615 --> 00:23:43.255
if you normalize to body length.

00:23:43.255 --> 00:23:45.950
They also happen to be very highly dynamic.

00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:48.895
So, these are not particularly useful gates but

00:23:48.895 --> 00:23:52.920
they illustrate this highly dynamic nature of these robots.

00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:54.825
This is partially due to their scale and I'm

00:23:54.825 --> 00:23:57.070
happy to go into that a little bit deeper offline.

00:23:57.070 --> 00:23:59.375
I'm also not showing a result here because it's unpublished,

00:23:59.375 --> 00:24:01.565
but we can get them climbing on walls and ceilings as well.

00:24:01.565 --> 00:24:03.815
One of the things that we're aiming for for

00:24:03.815 --> 00:24:06.490
these types of robots is high value asset inspection.

00:24:06.490 --> 00:24:10.365
So, we're working with a company

00:24:10.365 --> 00:24:14.380
that is interested in having small robots go where borescopes can't go.

00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:16.490
Basically go and inspect things, look for cracks,

00:24:16.490 --> 00:24:20.375
cracks in engines for example which would not require them to be taken out of service.

00:24:20.375 --> 00:24:22.825
So, I'm going to move on to another example which is

00:24:22.825 --> 00:24:25.430
entirely different but hopefully shares some of the same things.

00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:27.979
In fact, I think this actually illustrates

00:24:27.979 --> 00:24:30.275
the overall thesis that I have about

00:24:30.275 --> 00:24:33.035
the mechanical side of artificial intelligence better than the rest,

00:24:33.035 --> 00:24:34.930
and that's soft robots for the deep sea.

00:24:34.930 --> 00:24:40.760
So, this story starts off with this and I want you to hear that.

00:24:41.310 --> 00:24:45.040
I 'm not sure he's going to swim anymore.

00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:53.120
There he goes! And it's sideways, I told you he'd swim sideways.

00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:55.390
This is from friends at NOAA,

00:24:55.390 --> 00:24:58.460
this is exactly, it is what it is.

00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:03.790
So, this is a robotic arm on the ocean floor trying to do a sampling,

00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:05.075
trying to do a collection task.

00:25:05.075 --> 00:25:07.880
So, there is a group of scientists and

00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:11.760
marine biologists who are very interested in both exploration,

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:15.535
what's in the deep sea, what are in the deepest parts of the ocean we don't know.

00:25:15.535 --> 00:25:18.320
I could quote you statistics and stuff but I'll save that for you.

00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:22.520
The other thing is just generally speaking there's a lot of reasons to try

00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:28.080
to collect organisms from depths that go beyond what humans can reach,

00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:30.540
so beyond scuba or technical diving.

00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:34.650
So, those are things like understanding how mesopelagic organisms

00:25:34.650 --> 00:25:38.835
are reacting to ocean acidification or warming temperatures,

00:25:38.835 --> 00:25:41.870
and so you want to get these things and be able to sample them.

00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:43.400
But you also want to do this gently,

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:46.090
not only because you don't want to mangle the things like it's happening here,

00:25:46.090 --> 00:25:49.680
or like here, this is another example,

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:52.530
I believe it's a glass sponge.

00:25:57.790 --> 00:26:00.010
We want to be able to collect this,

00:26:00.010 --> 00:26:02.485
but with this sort of jaws of life looking thing it's impossible.

00:26:02.485 --> 00:26:06.030
Right? Not only is there no way to get it really,

00:26:06.030 --> 00:26:07.275
but even if you've got it,

00:26:07.275 --> 00:26:12.235
it's biology is going to be masked by the stress that you just induced on it.

00:26:12.235 --> 00:26:17.340
I saw these videos when I was at a meeting of the National Geographic Society,

00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:19.755
and there was one of our now colleagues that was there,

00:26:19.755 --> 00:26:21.450
and was trying to grab these things from

00:26:21.450 --> 00:26:24.970
the deep ocean and it couldn't for these reasons.

00:26:24.970 --> 00:26:27.380
So, right around that time we

00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:34.325
were starting to work in this nascent subfield of robotics called soft robotics.

00:26:34.325 --> 00:26:36.110
Soft robotics is just what it sounds like,

00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:37.730
trying to make robots out of rubber.

00:26:37.730 --> 00:26:41.235
So, there's a number of reasons you might want to do this,

00:26:41.235 --> 00:26:43.510
if you want to make anything,

00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:45.770
I could start off with a question to you.

00:26:45.770 --> 00:26:48.480
If I asked you to close your eyes and think about a robot,

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:53.380
and setting where robots can exist, what are you thinking of?

00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:56.560
Where are robots practical?

00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:58.410
Sorry, factories.

00:26:58.410 --> 00:26:59.650
So factory floors,

00:26:59.650 --> 00:27:01.575
assembling welding doors on cars whatever.

00:27:01.575 --> 00:27:06.775
So, that's a typical and extremely successful automation example of robotics.

00:27:06.775 --> 00:27:10.275
But what do you not see in that in that vision?

00:27:10.275 --> 00:27:11.710
Soft robots.

00:27:11.710 --> 00:27:14.695
You don't see soft robots if you don't see humans, you don,t see anything soft.

00:27:14.695 --> 00:27:17.350
You don't see anything delicate near them because they're dangerous.

00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:19.640
In fact, you see cages around them such

00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:22.740
that they're not going to harm anything or anyone.

00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:26.615
So, the motivation for soft robots is kind of get away from that to make robots that are

00:27:26.615 --> 00:27:30.420
impedance matched to natural systems to humans.

00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:34.150
We have some efforts in wearable robotics,

00:27:34.150 --> 00:27:36.000
there's a lot of efforts that are led at the Wyss Insitute to by

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.215
Conor Walsh in Wearable Assistive Devices.

00:27:39.215 --> 00:27:40.790
So, that's one application,

00:27:40.790 --> 00:27:42.650
it sort of gives you the flavor of soft robotics.

00:27:42.650 --> 00:27:46.435
So, we were doing this a few years ago trying to figure out,

00:27:46.435 --> 00:27:48.740
well, if we're going to make robots out of soft materials,

00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:50.560
how do we make the core components?

00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:53.540
So, how do we understand and how do we make sensors and actuators?

00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:57.240
Very simple things. How do we make a motor equivalence but out of rubber?

00:27:57.240 --> 00:27:59.400
So, this is an example where it's just in

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:02.555
the last tumeric balloon that's being pressurized internally,

00:28:02.555 --> 00:28:06.060
and if you pressurize this thing it'll change it's shape.

00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:12.380
One of the tricks that went in here is if I start to reinforce this last tumeric balloon

00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:13.970
with an extensible fibers or

00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:18.820
any inextensible material then I can get extension bending coupling,

00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:20.550
extension twisting coupling, I can get all sorts of

00:28:20.550 --> 00:28:23.925
complex motions and I can do this without control.

00:28:23.925 --> 00:28:26.545
So, there's no control here. I just pump in pressure

00:28:26.545 --> 00:28:29.230
and the thing deforms the way I want it to, the way I programmed it to.

00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:31.570
So, this is again coming back to the original thesis

00:28:31.570 --> 00:28:33.650
involving this mechanical side

00:28:33.650 --> 00:28:35.870
of artificial intelligence. I want to get away from control.

00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:38.680
I'll wrap control at a higher level around this,

00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:43.660
but at the lower level I want to have things sort of figure things out for themselves.

00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:46.870
This is just a simple example of anthropomorphic hand,

00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:52.510
but nonetheless we show that we can create very effective devices.

00:28:52.510 --> 00:28:56.345
So, we convinced the National Geographic Society to send us on an expedition.

00:28:56.345 --> 00:28:58.455
In this case, it was over to the Red Sea,

00:28:58.455 --> 00:29:00.000
it was with our collaborator who had

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.890
this remotely operated vehicle where we basically cut the hand

00:29:02.890 --> 00:29:07.480
off of the arm that was on it and put our soft hands on it.

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:09.865
So, this was the first example

00:29:09.865 --> 00:29:12.360
of this is a shameless plug back to the National Geographic Society

00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:18.180
where that's me thanking our sponsors effectively.

00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:20.395
What we did was,

00:29:20.395 --> 00:29:26.320
the first example of delicate manipulation at the bottom of the ocean in this case,

00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:29.205
this was only a couple of 100 meters or about 150 meters

00:29:29.205 --> 00:29:34.355
below the surface where we were trying to grasp these whip corals.

00:29:34.355 --> 00:29:35.900
But it was the first successful,

00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:37.775
we were able to actually grab these gently

00:29:37.775 --> 00:29:39.970
and there's a little cutter at the bottom here,

00:29:39.970 --> 00:29:42.545
just snip them off and bring them back up to the surface.

00:29:42.545 --> 00:29:45.505
You can imagine, go back a couple of slides,

00:29:45.505 --> 00:29:47.885
if I have that rigid gripper system,

00:29:47.885 --> 00:29:50.450
and I want to grab this thing and I am a couple of

00:29:50.450 --> 00:29:53.800
100 meters even more in some of the videos I'll show you in a minute.

00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:57.530
A couple of 100 meters below me and all I have a visual feedback from the cameras.

00:29:57.530 --> 00:29:59.090
They're very nice cameras but all I have is basically

00:29:59.090 --> 00:30:01.225
two dimensional visual feedback from the ROV,

00:30:01.225 --> 00:30:02.680
and now the boat's rocking right.

00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:06.525
So, how do I do this really tricky manipulation task?

00:30:06.525 --> 00:30:08.875
In this case and maybe I'll play this again,

00:30:08.875 --> 00:30:12.420
in this case it turns out to be a trivial thing in the sense

00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:16.600
that we take advantage of this concept that I said before about bending, twisting,

00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:20.750
coupling, and I just get close enough and power this thing and it

00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:24.960
wraps itself up into a helix and grabs this thing.

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:27.315
There's other types of examples that we had,

00:30:27.315 --> 00:30:28.880
this is more of broccoli

00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:33.090
looking coral where we can just basically give it a nice gentle hug,

00:30:33.090 --> 00:30:37.530
there's all sorts of features here which enhance the gentleness of this come in,

00:30:37.530 --> 00:30:39.745
clip it, and bring it back to the surface.

00:30:39.745 --> 00:30:41.680
So, that was a couple of years ago.

00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:44.110
We then wanted to expand this,

00:30:44.110 --> 00:30:47.270
and so we've basically been hitching rides on anybody that has a big boat.

00:30:47.270 --> 00:30:51.690
A couple of times now we've been with with Bob Ballard on the Nautilus and hooked

00:30:51.690 --> 00:30:57.170
up these soft manipulators to this case, this ROV hercules.

00:30:58.130 --> 00:31:03.210
I think this is about 1.8 kilometers below

00:31:03.210 --> 00:31:07.290
the surface where this is grabbing this holothurian here,

00:31:07.290 --> 00:31:10.320
the sea cucumber where this is something which is

00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:14.190
effectively the consistency of wet tissue paper under water.

00:31:14.190 --> 00:31:20.050
But nonetheless, we're able to very delicately grab it, pick it up, put it back down.

00:31:20.050 --> 00:31:21.920
We didn't bring it to the surface in this case because this was

00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:24.280
just an exploration mission of what we actually could do.

00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:28.520
But I take this example specifically as one of the most delicate objects I can

00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:33.190
imagine gripping and in one of the harshest environments I could imagine doing this in.

00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:35.680
I throw a very dumb gripper.

00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:38.730
It's just a simple three finger thing that I just pump

00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:42.960
sea water into and I can do this task very well.

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:47.560
I understand, and James you can correct me that these animals have

00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:49.790
a defense mechanism or they invert their stomachs

00:31:49.790 --> 00:31:53.025
as a defense mechanism if they're frightened,

00:31:53.025 --> 00:31:56.445
as one of my students said sort of take my wallet and leave me alone kind of thing,

00:31:56.445 --> 00:32:00.005
and this guy showed none of those.

00:32:00.005 --> 00:32:03.665
We can also grasp.

00:32:03.665 --> 00:32:06.780
These are things, by the way, you can kind of hear the banter of

00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:09.980
the ROV pilots while this is happening.

00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:11.660
A lot of times we hear like, "Oh,

00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:15.150
we would never go after that thing with a rigid grip or it just would work."

00:32:15.150 --> 00:32:15.290
Yeah.

00:32:15.290 --> 00:32:20.370
Here's one example where it's not necessarily a delicate thing.

00:32:20.610 --> 00:32:27.320
This is a crab but we can go down and grab basically whatever we want.

00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:28.315
It's awesome.

00:32:28.315 --> 00:32:30.100
Then, put it back down unharmed.

00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:32.620
The last thing I want to tell you about is,

00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:36.905
a project that we had with with Jennifer Lewis' group.

00:32:36.905 --> 00:32:43.180
It starts with the following obvious observation which is sure,

00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:47.750
the end effectors of those things are soft but everything from here on is rigid.

00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:52.880
So, your rigid arm and valve manifold and pumps and ROV,

00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:55.435
whatever is all sort of classical,

00:32:55.435 --> 00:32:57.610
very well engineered but nonetheless is,

00:32:57.610 --> 00:32:59.890
sort of a rigid body devices.

00:32:59.890 --> 00:33:04.300
So, the question is, can we create robots that are entirely soft?

00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:06.595
Where there are absolutely no rigid components.

00:33:06.595 --> 00:33:10.105
So, that's what we set out to do and

00:33:10.105 --> 00:33:15.040
that boiled down for us into some sort of sub-questions.

00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:16.390
Those sub-questions were:

00:33:16.390 --> 00:33:18.940
How do we create the core components for these things?

00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:21.600
The core components of any robot might be,

00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:22.620
at least on a lower level,

00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:23.710
thinking about the mechanisms.

00:33:23.710 --> 00:33:26.210
We have sensors, actuators, computation, and power.

00:33:26.210 --> 00:33:28.535
So, how do we do those four things?

00:33:28.535 --> 00:33:29.980
So, actuation, I already told you about,

00:33:29.980 --> 00:33:31.940
we can create fluidic actuation no problem.

00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:34.570
Sensors, I didn't tell you about but I can tell you about off line,

00:33:34.570 --> 00:33:36.225
we can do that fairly easily as well.

00:33:36.225 --> 00:33:39.855
But in terms of, how do we think about creating a little controller that's soft?

00:33:39.855 --> 00:33:43.140
How do we think about having power that soft?

00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:45.180
Certainly not traditional batteries.

00:33:45.180 --> 00:33:52.330
So, long story short is that we leveraged chemical power for these systems.

00:33:52.330 --> 00:33:57.500
So, the the fluidic based actuators require pressurized fluid gas or liquid.

00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:00.470
So, what we do is, we rely on peroxide decomposition.

00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:02.750
So, our modern propellant decomposition,

00:34:02.750 --> 00:34:04.600
in this case hydrogen peroxide,

00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:06.425
in the presence of a platinum catalyst.

00:34:06.425 --> 00:34:08.525
So, it's a very energetic reaction and I can tell you

00:34:08.525 --> 00:34:10.965
about the kinetics of this later but nonetheless,

00:34:10.965 --> 00:34:13.500
the products of this are hot gases basically,

00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:17.625
that are useful to power whatever fluidic actuator you want downstream.

00:34:17.625 --> 00:34:20.445
Okay, that's great but that doesn't say any about control.

00:34:20.445 --> 00:34:24.080
If I just sort of dump peroxide on a catalyst and then, capture that gas,

00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:26.170
that's going to actuate me just fine but it's not

00:34:26.170 --> 00:34:28.390
going to do anything with any sort of sequence or control.

00:34:28.390 --> 00:34:32.675
So, the second piece of this puzzle is leveraging many decades worth of

00:34:32.675 --> 00:34:37.805
progress in microfluidics and soft lithography to create fluidic-based control circuits.

00:34:37.805 --> 00:34:40.630
So, it turns out, you can use microfluidic systems to

00:34:40.630 --> 00:34:45.645
create almost any sort of copy, in a loose way,

00:34:45.645 --> 00:34:49.420
to any electrical circuit that you might want, circuit components, resistors,

00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:52.810
capacitors and even high order things like

00:34:52.810 --> 00:34:57.620
digital logic and sequencers, counters, comparators, whatever.

00:34:57.620 --> 00:35:00.130
I can do that all in fluidic systems.

00:35:00.130 --> 00:35:02.310
This is an example of what we used which

00:35:02.310 --> 00:35:04.730
is a very simple example of just a fluidic oscillators.

00:35:04.730 --> 00:35:07.440
So, I pump in a constant positive pressure and the output is

00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:10.170
basically an oscillation of pressure on multiple outputs.

00:35:10.170 --> 00:35:13.440
So, there is the architecture that we have where we have this fuel goes through

00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:17.060
this microfluidic logic circuits gets broken down,

00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:21.210
past the check valve into a catalyst site that then catalyzes this reaction,

00:35:21.210 --> 00:35:24.395
produces gas that then actuate these actuators downstream.

00:35:24.395 --> 00:35:26.810
So, this is where some beautiful innovation from

00:35:26.810 --> 00:35:29.980
our collaborators in the Lewis group came in.

00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:35.045
So, this is a concept that they developed called Embedded 3D printing where you take,

00:35:35.045 --> 00:35:38.015
what you're seeing here is a vat of

00:35:38.015 --> 00:35:41.240
uncured elastomer and this uncured elastomer

00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:44.175
then is being injected with a sacrificial ink.

00:35:44.175 --> 00:35:48.345
So, there's all sorts of tricks that are associated with realogy of this,

00:35:48.345 --> 00:35:50.990
to get these to be stable structures even though uncured.

00:35:50.990 --> 00:35:52.790
But nonetheless, let's ignore that for a minute.

00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:54.575
They were able to inject

00:35:54.575 --> 00:35:57.520
this sacrificial ink wherever they want

00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:00.270
within the sort of structure of this uncured elastomer.

00:36:00.270 --> 00:36:05.380
This eventually forms the vasculature if you will, of this robot.

00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:09.240
So, what happens is, once this printing process is done,

00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:12.805
and so you're seeing the actuators and the limbs being printed now.

00:36:12.805 --> 00:36:15.130
Once this printing process is done,

00:36:15.130 --> 00:36:19.790
this whole thing is cured and so the elastomer solidifies then,

00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:23.585
you still have this sacrificial ink within the vasculature.

00:36:23.585 --> 00:36:28.920
It turns out that the silicone-based elastomers that we use are porous to water and the

00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:30.740
Pluronic that's used as the ink for

00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:34.790
these things will break down basically in the water and then, self-evacuate.

00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:36.170
So, you basically have voids that are

00:36:36.170 --> 00:36:39.535
formed more or less for free at the end of this process.

00:36:39.535 --> 00:36:41.020
So, that's the vasculature,

00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:44.305
that's the main, sort of internal structure of this device,

00:36:44.305 --> 00:36:46.610
and they also figured out ways to print

00:36:46.610 --> 00:36:51.820
platinum-laden inks as well to do the catalyst site as well.

00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:54.080
Then, the last step which you

00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:56.720
didn't quite see but it sort of illustrated on the top here is,

00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:58.415
prior to all of this we use

00:36:58.415 --> 00:37:02.340
soft lithography techniques to create this microfluidic control system,

00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:05.255
plant that in the uncured elastomer matrix and then,

00:37:05.255 --> 00:37:07.360
prints into that device as well.

00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:10.210
So, what that gives you at the end is this,

00:37:10.210 --> 00:37:12.010
which we call the Octobot,

00:37:12.010 --> 00:37:14.515
and also this is a bit metaphorical.

00:37:14.515 --> 00:37:18.710
I would say almost every single talk I've seen by somebody that mentions

00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:22.880
the word soft robotics shows an octopus as inspiration which makes sense.

00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:25.535
So, that was our inspiration I guess in some ways as well.

00:37:25.535 --> 00:37:28.220
This is a robot now and I'm going to use

00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:31.370
quotes purposely and you can see the components of this device,

00:37:31.370 --> 00:37:33.605
sort of in florescence here,

00:37:33.605 --> 00:37:36.325
where you have your fluidic control system,

00:37:36.325 --> 00:37:38.500
a fluid reservoir, catalyst sites.

00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:42.105
You see all of this is a vasculature that make up the actuation sites.

00:37:42.105 --> 00:37:45.010
Okay, so how does this work? So, here's the schematic

00:37:45.010 --> 00:37:48.230
again of this thing in operation and here's what actually happens.

00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:50.990
So, I inject a fuel being done on the bottom left here,

00:37:50.990 --> 00:37:54.720
on the bottom two videos and the pressure from the fuel,

00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:59.120
sort of expanding the elastomeric reservoir pushes the fuel through the control system.

00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:01.620
Then like I said, it gets broken down at the catalyst site,

00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:04.140
it gets alternated between catalyst sites and then,

00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:07.350
downstream then gets alternated between actuation sites.

00:38:07.350 --> 00:38:11.715
So, at the end of the day, this fantastic robot just basically just does this.

00:38:11.715 --> 00:38:15.490
Okay. So, that I mean we're very proud of this. We're very excited by this.

00:38:15.490 --> 00:38:18.430
This I think speaks very clearly to this notion of trying to do

00:38:18.430 --> 00:38:22.330
as much of the sensing actuation control power,

00:38:22.330 --> 00:38:26.830
whatever in hardware, prior to actually wrapping a controller around it.

00:38:26.830 --> 00:38:31.405
It is the first, entirely soft robot if you will again in quotes.

00:38:31.405 --> 00:38:34.310
So, we were happy about this and this got published in Nature a couple of years ago.

00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:36.765
But really it's more about being provocative.

00:38:36.765 --> 00:38:37.910
I think that there's a really,

00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:40.375
I want to end with this sort of notion.

00:38:40.375 --> 00:38:41.830
Who's familiar with this?

00:38:41.830 --> 00:38:42.915
This is called an automata,

00:38:42.915 --> 00:38:47.385
which was made back in the 1700's unsurprisingly by Swiss watchmakers.

00:38:47.385 --> 00:38:48.735
It's a piece of art which is,

00:38:48.735 --> 00:38:50.290
if you sort of open up and look under the hood,

00:38:50.290 --> 00:38:56.160
it's a series of gears and cans and levers which are all connected to this mechanism,

00:38:56.160 --> 00:39:03.270
which allows this boy to write out complex passages of text. Is this a robot?

00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:09.145
Is it programmable?

00:39:09.145 --> 00:39:15.445
Is it programmable? No. It's programmable design time but not re-programmable, certainly.

00:39:15.445 --> 00:39:18.060
So, now I'm seeing you're shaking your heads.

00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:20.140
No. No, it's not really a robot, right?

00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:21.450
What if I were to go and buy

00:39:21.450 --> 00:39:27.010
a Baxter and put a pen in its hands and do all the path planning

00:39:27.010 --> 00:39:30.045
control for the exact same passage of text and have

00:39:30.045 --> 00:39:34.200
it react to the page and maybe have some vision system.

00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:38.780
Is that a robot? There's no wrong answer here.

00:39:38.780 --> 00:39:41.675
But yeah, I mean yeah, that's a robot, right?

00:39:41.675 --> 00:39:44.420
So, I guess the question I'm trying to get at is,

00:39:44.420 --> 00:39:48.630
at what point do we take this very simple concept that we had,

00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:52.570
this trivial controller which is just sort of making this oscillation happen.

00:39:52.570 --> 00:39:55.710
Many groups have done far,

00:39:55.710 --> 00:39:58.135
far more complicated fluidic networks.

00:39:58.135 --> 00:40:00.180
Thousands and thousands of valves which

00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:02.855
you can equate a valve to a transistor in a very loose way.

00:40:02.855 --> 00:40:06.550
So, we can get much more complex behaviors if you will out

00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:10.100
of these types of systems and I'm not going to pretend to answer this question.

00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:12.750
This is the subject, I think of some of the philosophy I work now.

00:40:12.750 --> 00:40:16.680
But, at what point do we stop with this path of

00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:20.890
trying to increase the mechanical complexity and sort of,

00:40:20.890 --> 00:40:24.165
at the potential expense of performance or not,

00:40:24.165 --> 00:40:27.285
and where do we sort of bring in decades worth of

00:40:27.285 --> 00:40:33.085
classical electrical controllers and AI that are very common in robotics?

00:40:33.085 --> 00:40:35.060
So, that's where I want to stop.

00:40:35.060 --> 00:40:37.180
We worked on a bunch of other topics that I'm sort of

00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:39.740
illustrating here related to artificial muscles,

00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:42.480
bio-inspired robots, ultra-fast motion.

00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:44.755
This is the sensors that I was alluding to before.

00:40:44.755 --> 00:40:47.300
We're working on projects where we're taking some of

00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:50.320
these micro fabrication techniques to make small scale surgical tools,

00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:52.595
endoscopy tools that have just finished animal trials.

00:40:52.595 --> 00:40:54.275
We can make self-holding robots,

00:40:54.275 --> 00:40:55.600
3D-printer robots that jump.

00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:58.690
This is also a jeans and a whole host of other things that I'm happy

00:40:58.690 --> 00:41:02.210
to tell you more about if you want to buy me a drink next door.

00:41:02.210 --> 00:41:04.170
I'll stick around. Otherwise, I'm very

00:41:04.170 --> 00:41:06.495
grateful for your attention, for your participation.

00:41:06.495 --> 00:41:08.710
Thank you again for the invitation.
