00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:06.010
Many applications require configuration
settings in secret such as TLS certs

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:07.550
to run in a production environment.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.635
One problem we saw before when we used
Docker was that many devs want to

00:00:12.635 --> 00:00:15.742
bake in their configs and
put those on the public Docker.

00:00:15.742 --> 00:00:16.920
Don't do it.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.960
So then what should we do?

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.333
Some say to put configuration
management tools into the Pod.

00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:26.203
You can, you shouldn't.

00:00:26.203 --> 00:00:28.098
There's a better way.

00:00:28.098 --> 00:00:32.400
In there are Configmaps and
Secrets to take care of these problems.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.210
Configmaps and

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.280
Secrets are similar except Configmaps
don't have to be sensitive data.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.890
They can use environment variables and
they can tell downstream pods that

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.030
configuration is changed along a pod or
restart itself if necessary.

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:47.810
Let's talk about secrets.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.900
It's really easy to create
a secret from a file.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.080
Using the cube CTO
creates secret command.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.280
In our example we've done this and

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.620
the Kubernetes Master already
knows about our secret.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.110
Then we can upload that secret to a pod.

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.850
Let's see how this works.

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.070
What happens if we start up
a pod that uses a secret?

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:14.080
Well after we run this cube CTO
create Pod command, a pod is created,

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.410
then our secret is mounted
onto our pod as a volume.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.310
This way creators can make sure
that our configs are there

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:22.450
before our container start.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.980
Once that volume is there,
we can take the contents of it and

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.040
expose it on the file system to
wherever our pods would go to mount it.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.240
Then our pod starts to come online.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.070
And finally our container is spun up.

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.700
We're good to go.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.220
So now let's have Kelsey
teach us more about

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.070
creating Secrets to store
sensitive application data.

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.080
And creating Configmaps to
store application config data.
