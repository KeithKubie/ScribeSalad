[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.432 --> 00:00:09.299
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:11.590
JEFFERY C. HOOKE: It's
obviously a pleasure to be here.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:14.600
I'm going to start
off by taking a poll.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.670
How many people
have heard the fairy

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.690
tale "Jack and the Beanstalk?"

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:22.100
OK, most of you.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.080
Well, as you recall
from that fairy tale,

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.960
Jack was asked by his
mother to take the family

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.000
cow to the market and sell it.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.110
Instead, he was waylaid
along the way to the market

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.390
by someone who
offered to exchange

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.361
magic beans for the cow.

00:00:38.361 --> 00:00:39.860
And those magic
things were supposed

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.980
to translate into great wealth
for Jack and his mother.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.510
So in that particular case, as
you recall from the fairy tale,

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.110
the magic beans
did return wealth.

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.070
He had to steal gold from
the giant way up above.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.960
But it did result in wealth
for Jack and his mom.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.610
But when we talk
about private equity,

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:59.800
they have the same system.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.340
They're promising a magic
elixir, or magic beans

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.740
for investors-- that they're
going to beat the stock

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:07.980
markets dramatically.

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.860
And as we're going
to learn today,

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.210
it simply isn't the case.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.980
And that's why the
subject of this talk

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.010
is called the Myth
of Private Equity.

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.680
So I like to start off a talk by
telling you exactly what we're

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:19.400
going to go over.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.020
So we've got six topics today.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.030
We've got my background.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.220
What is private equity?

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.710
Is it a savior for
institutional investors that

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.430
want to beat the stock market?

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.820
We'll talk a little bit
as [? Pernesh ?] indicated

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.840
about private equity returns
and the associated fees.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.230
And then we'll close with,
how do big institutions

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.670
select a private equity fund?

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.910
And then I'll take
some questions.

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.120
So my background is
a little unusual.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.810
I've had a number of
different positions.

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.610
I was an investment banker
in New York for 15 years.

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.560
I was an institutional
lender both in New York

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.100
and at the World Bank
in Washington, DC.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.350
I've done private equity
in the emerging markets

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:03.940
for a very large
private equity fund

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.360
as well as for the World Bank's
private equity operation.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.860
As he pointed out,
I'm an author.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.870
I've also been an expert
witness in front of judges

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.350
regarding financial matters.

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:16.960
And as he pointed
out, I'm currently

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.260
a professor of finance.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.640
So I've had quite a number
of different positions.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.880
Deal-wise, I've done
deals all over the world.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:25.870
I've done US.

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.689
I've done deals in Asia,
Latin America, Europe.

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:30.730
There probably isn't a
deal that I haven't seen--

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.870
M&amp;A, IPOs, large debt
offerings, project finance.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.300
I've kind of seen
it all in my career.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.060
And that's led me to look
at things in various ways

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.180
because I've been exposed to so
many different transactions as

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.460
well as different
cultures-- how people

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.770
in various countries
and various institutions

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.620
look at transactions
in corporate finance.

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.950
So I've had sort of an
intellectual bent, which

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.730
you don't see with a lot
of Wall Street-type people.

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.170
And so I kind of analyze things.

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.487
I don't think it's necessarily
helped my career much,

00:03:06.487 --> 00:03:07.570
but it's been interesting.

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.030
And of course, you've
maybe heard the expression,

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.610
the unreflected life
is not worth living.

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.250
So I guess I've
lived by that motto.

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.000
Some books-- as he pointed
out, Wall Street-type books--

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.720
but I've done some academic
work lately as a professor.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.810
And the professors that I've
worked with, we've done papers

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.440
on private equity,
state pension funds,

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.000
and we just finished
a paper that's

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.970
going to be published by a
journal on private foundations

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.700
and their investment techniques.

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.890
I do a lot of pro bono work.

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.905
If you don't know what pro
bono means, it means free.

00:03:44.905 --> 00:03:48.400
It's Latin for free.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.160
Because I have quite an
investment banking and finance

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.040
background, I've done work for
citizens groups and taxpayer

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.140
groups in these four areas--

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.900
tobacco lawsuit fees, which
ran into the billions,

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.390
like, 15 or 20 years ago.

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.790
Casino legalization
in various states--

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.550
Many of the legislators wanted
to give these casinos licenses

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:07.662
out for free.

00:04:07.662 --> 00:04:08.620
I thought it was wrong.

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:09.828
I thought it was un-American.

00:04:09.828 --> 00:04:12.720
So I led a fight to try to
get these states to charge

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.100
quote, "fair market
value" for these licenses.

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.360
And we had some success.

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.690
It probably cost the casino
industry $2 or $3 billion

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:20.709
in fees.

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.750
Public utility mergers,
where the utilities

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.760
aren't giving enough of
their benefits of the merger

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.160
to the ratepayers--

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.990
and then, as I said,
I've also done,

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.900
not only academic research,
but some testimony

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.540
on behalf of state pension
funds and investors

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:39.285
and employee unions to see that
those things are run properly.

00:04:39.285 --> 00:04:42.430
My pro bono work also
extends to the CFA society.

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.310
I'm a big fan of
the CFA Institute.

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:46.570
And so when I do travel--

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:48.670
sometimes on vacation,
sometimes on business--

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:50.620
if I have enough
advanced notice,

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.170
I'll contact the
local CFA Society.

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:57.280
It's a global organization, so
I've been in front of audiences

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.980
in places, like
Moscow and Thailand.

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.619
So it's been kind of
interesting there as well.

00:05:02.619 --> 00:05:05.160
I know some of you are in the
Investment Club here at Google.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.840
Investment Club
often means, I like

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.436
to buy stocks and sell stocks.

00:05:11.436 --> 00:05:12.810
So I'll talk of
a couple of words

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:17.500
about stock picking
based on my experience.

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.729
Tens of thousands of
people are involved

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:20.770
in the picking of stocks.

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.050
And many are
extremely well-trained

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:25.731
at the top business schools
and have a lot of experience.

00:05:25.731 --> 00:05:27.355
So if you're picking
stocks personally,

00:05:27.355 --> 00:05:31.780
you remember, you've got a
lot of competition to be right

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:33.800
and, actually, to
beat the market.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.750
So even with all these
smart people doing it,

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:39.640
it's very tough to
beat the market.

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.760
Most professionals can't do it.

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.980
And these people are working
24/7 trying to beat the market.

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:48.300
They just can't do it.

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.600
Those that can consistently
beat the market,

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.300
it's a very small percentage.

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:58.590
If you look at fund managers
going up against the S&amp;P 500,

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:03.000
less than 0.1% have beaten
it over the last 10 years

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.800
consistently.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.710
So they have the
rare combination

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:10.510
of extreme ability and luck.

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:12.460
And if you look
at statistically,

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:16.530
if you're guessing, buy
or sell for 10 years,

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:19.270
if that's a binary
choice, the chances

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:23.430
of being right for 10
years are 1 in 1,000.

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:27.530
So it's tough, tough
to beat the market.

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:30.290
I think it's a good
hobby, so I do it,

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:32.747
even though I don't think my
results are that terrific.

00:06:32.747 --> 00:06:33.830
I think it's a good hobby.

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:36.500
It's easy to measure your
performance against the market.

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:40.200
It's objective like being a
baseball hitter or something.

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:43.280
But if you are someone like
the people in this room,

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.290
you probably have a
job that's full time.

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:48.440
You're not going to be able
to really research stocks

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:49.910
effectively against the pros.

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:53.690
So I would say reserve part of
your portfolio for fun stock

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:58.590
picking, but index most of it.

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:02.150
So let's get to the
topic of today's talk,

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:05.950
which is private equity
and why it's a myth.

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:08.740
I'll describe private
equity for a minute.

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:12.250
So the way a private
equity fund works is,

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:15.010
you have a number of large
institutional investors--

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:17.112
10 or 15, sometimes 20--

00:07:17.112 --> 00:07:19.570
putting in tens of millions,
sometimes hundreds of millions

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:22.000
of dollars into a fund.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.400
So it's a big pot of money.

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:29.350
And the fund is run by
investment banker-types

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:31.770
like myself.

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:37.950
And so the fund is buying
companies for the most part.

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:40.510
And it's going to have a
portfolio of, say, 5 or 10

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:42.530
companies.

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:44.750
And then these
companies are then

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:48.290
going to be sold after a
certain holding period.

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:50.810
So it's like a mutual
fund, except the number

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:54.430
of investments is very small,
and you control each one.

00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:56.060
So the fund is
actually in control

00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:59.640
and helps guide the company.

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:03.080
So the interesting thing I find
about private equity as opposed

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:05.690
to, say, a mutual fund is
that the investors have

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:09.120
a much longer time horizon.

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:13.370
So if you're going to buy
companies and then sell them,

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:15.170
first, you have to find them.

00:08:15.170 --> 00:08:19.820
So finding a deal, in itself,
is a full-time job, believe me.

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:25.500
Then you have to negotiate
and close the transaction.

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:27.574
So if you've got a fund
of, say, $1 billion,

00:08:27.574 --> 00:08:29.240
that's going to take
three or four years

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:32.120
to invest that $1 billion.

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:33.679
Then, over the next
few years, you're

00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:38.130
trying as a PE fund
manager to work

00:08:38.130 --> 00:08:40.620
with the management teams
of these various companies

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:41.429
that you own.

00:08:41.429 --> 00:08:43.526
You're trying to
improve the company.

00:08:43.526 --> 00:08:45.900
Much like if you buy a piece
of real estate, you may say,

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:47.220
well, I'm going to paint it.

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:50.256
I'm going to put an addition
on it, and then I'll flip it.

00:08:50.256 --> 00:08:51.880
So they're trying to
do the same thing.

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:53.490
Except, in a
corporate world, where

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:55.260
they've got a few
years to try to improve

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:59.390
the earnings of the
company, improve the sales

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:02.350
and then get the
company ready for sale.

00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:05.560
Get this company ready
for sale and liquidation.

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:08.350
So then they've got three or
four years after the holding

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:10.225
period to sell the company.

00:09:10.225 --> 00:09:14.320
Now, most of them are
sold in M&amp;A deals.

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:16.420
There are very few IPOs
in the United States.

00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:18.003
There's only a few
hundred every year,

00:09:18.003 --> 00:09:20.650
where there's 15,000
M&amp;A deals every year.

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:24.040
So then they sell the companies
at the end of 10 years,

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:28.480
and hopefully, the investors
have got a good profit.

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:34.450
So if you look at it in the
narrow stock-picking way,

00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:37.480
these managers are
picking companies

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:40.570
almost like you might pick
stocks in a portfolio.

00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:43.060
So they're very concentrated,
but they're essentially

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:46.300
picking stocks, except they're
buying the whole company.

00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:49.600
So that's the way they do it.

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:55.410
Now, this chart doesn't show it,
but there are three categories

00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:56.700
that dominate private equity.

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:58.640
The largest one would
be Leveraged Buyouts,

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.690
and I'll talk about
that in a minute.

00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:04.050
Venture capital and growth
equity would be about 20%.

00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:08.040
But LBOs would be
over 60% of the money.

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:10.510
And what's a Leveraged Buyout?

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:13.390
Well, a leveraged buyout fund--

00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:15.490
it's got a basic
strategy here, which

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:18.190
is you buy 5 or 10
low-tech companies.

00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:21.544
They have to be non-cyclical,
and they have to be profitable.

00:10:21.544 --> 00:10:22.960
So they can borrow
a lot of money.

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:26.320
Banks like loaning to
firms that make money.

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:31.270
And so the idea is that the
LBO will have a lot more debt

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:34.180
than a similar publicly-traded
company like those

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:36.430
in the Russell 2000.

00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:39.880
And the idea, very basically,
is that the more debt

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:45.290
you put on a conservatively
managed low-tech company,

00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:47.590
the lower the cost of capital.

00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:50.710
If the market goes
up, the stock market

00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:54.610
goes up, as does the M&amp;A
market at the same pace,

00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:58.120
the internal rate of return of
the private equity portfolio

00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:00.850
will be greater than
a similar portfolio

00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:04.520
of publicly-traded stocks
because it has more debt.

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:08.670
More debt would mean higher rate
of return to the equity holder.

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:13.000
Of course, if the stock market
falls, the reverse happens.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.970
So you will have
more losses compared

00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:19.050
to the public market if
you've got a lot of leverage.

00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:22.260
So the private equity
fund, in theory,

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:23.940
should have more volatility.

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:27.330
It should go up and down more
than the stock market because

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:28.360
of the greater debt.

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:32.090
But the returns will be
enhanced either up or down.

00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:33.900
Now, venture capital
funds-- you know,

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:35.970
we're here in Silicon
Valley-- venture capital

00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:37.120
is a little different.

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:38.286
But it's the same principle.

00:11:38.286 --> 00:11:41.110
You buy 5 or 10 Venture
Capital investments.

00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:44.340
There, usually the private
equity fund or the VC fund

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:46.530
is not controlling the company.

00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:48.872
They don't own a
majority interest.

00:11:48.872 --> 00:11:50.580
They're buying companies
that are already

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:52.090
in business for the most part.

00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:54.840
So they're not working out
of a garage or something.

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:57.960
And not all the VC
investments are high tech.

00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:00.390
So here, the companies
are a lot younger

00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:01.750
than the buyout business.

00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:07.090
So the VC partners are
providing not only cash,

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:08.890
but some guidance and advice.

00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:11.910
So it's a little different
than the LBO business

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:14.410
because I think there's more
involvement with the management

00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:15.810
team.

00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:19.960
So the fundamental objective
of the private equity industry

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:23.760
is they'd like to
beat the stock market.

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:26.360
Because if they're not
beating the stock market,

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:29.060
the investors-- big
institutions, like Harvard,

00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:32.612
or Singapore Sovereign
Wealth Fund-- will say,

00:12:32.612 --> 00:12:33.570
what do I need you for?

00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:36.390
I can just buy public stocks.

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:40.290
So the idea is to have a higher
rate of return with less risk.

00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:42.850
That's the sales pitch.

00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:49.390
So if you look at
that sales pitch,

00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:54.820
it would put the
private equity business

00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:58.700
at a higher rate of return
the S&amp;P 500 with lower risk.

00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:01.260
Now, some of you may
remember, if you ever

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:05.040
took a finance course, that that
defies all finance theory back

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:06.810
from the '50s.

00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:11.160
Supposedly, if you're higher
than this market line,

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:12.970
the market will come in.

00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:15.360
Everybody will invest
in this and, therefore,

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:19.260
drive the returns down to what's
on the securities market line,

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:20.100
it's called.

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:21.600
So that's the theory.

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:23.580
So it contradicts the theory.

00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:27.400
A lot of PE
investors are saying,

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:30.930
not only do I want to have
the S&amp;P return from my Private

00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:32.650
Equity fund, I want to beat it.

00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:35.400
And that's because you
can't sell these funds.

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:38.490
You can't sell your part
of a private equity fund

00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:40.730
like you can sell stocks.

00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:44.870
And you're also not
getting instant feedback

00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:47.360
on what the price of your
private equity portfolio

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:50.150
is, because there's some
uncertainty about what

00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:53.360
a private company is worth.

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:56.970
So there are thousands
of funds out there.

00:13:56.970 --> 00:13:59.180
As I said, I used
to work for one.

00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:03.260
And the idea from the
fund manager's perspective

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.750
is, I want to start fund one--

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:08.330
getting the fees
from the investors

00:14:08.330 --> 00:14:10.190
and hopefully getting profits--

00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:12.630
and then, while this fund
is four or five years old,

00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:14.300
I'll start the next one.

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:17.285
I don't need a lot of extra
management to start a new fund.

00:14:17.285 --> 00:14:20.800
So I'll start this fund
next, get these from that

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:22.700
while I'm selling part of one.

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:25.280
And then, as fund two
starts getting invested,

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:26.420
I'll go to fund three.

00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:31.280
So I'm compounding the profits,
and I've got economies of scale

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:34.290
with the management.

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:39.620
Now, as I said, it'd be
nice if investors could beat

00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:41.240
the market with these funds.

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:43.310
And earlier, they were.

00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:46.980
Say, before 2005,
as you can see,

00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:49.010
the funds that were
started before that

00:14:49.010 --> 00:14:52.750
were consistently
beating the S&amp;P 500.

00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:57.180
But people then started
plunging into these funds.

00:14:57.180 --> 00:14:59.540
Because these funds
got much bigger,

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:02.310
there was more
competition for deals.

00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:03.720
And so, as you
might expect, when

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:05.760
there's more competition
for transactions,

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:08.370
the cost of the M&amp;A goes up.

00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:10.290
And the returns, as
a result, declines.

00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:13.980
So over the last 12
years or so, the returns

00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:18.840
have not been very good
relative to the S&amp;P 500.

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:20.656
And if you look,
this is buyout funds.

00:15:20.656 --> 00:15:22.280
If you look at venture
capital, there's

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:24.260
a similar return
pattern where people

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:27.050
were piling into these funds,
and so the returns have not

00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:30.940
been so terrific.

00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:33.990
So if you look at
fees as one element

00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:38.830
of the whole private equity
equation, they're pretty high.

00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:42.460
So the fees on an
indexed mutual fund

00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:44.770
that you might buy from
Vanguard or Fidelity

00:15:44.770 --> 00:15:46.790
might be five basis
points a year.

00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:49.350
They're peanuts, almost nothing.

00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:51.170
And in fact, there's
been some news

00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:54.340
that Fidelity is starting
to offer funds for nothing.

00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:57.780
So you would invest in
it and not pay anything.

00:15:57.780 --> 00:15:59.530
Private equity,
on the other hand,

00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:01.660
is about 300 basis
points a year.

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:05.010
So the fees are
60 times as great.

00:16:05.010 --> 00:16:08.490
So the manager of the
private equity fund

00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:13.290
has got to beat the S&amp;P by 3%
every year just to compensate

00:16:13.290 --> 00:16:14.590
the investors for the fee.

00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:16.160
So that's pretty tough.

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:20.190
And so if you look at it
like this kind of graph,

00:16:20.190 --> 00:16:25.670
getting into this part of
performance is so hard.

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:27.210
Just a small
percentage of people

00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:30.400
can do that with
the public markets.

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:32.520
And as a result, with
the high fee drag,

00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:35.520
you're not investing the
investor's money 100%.

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:37.860
Perhaps, the private
equity fund's

00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:39.970
only investing 80%
of investor's money.

00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:42.495
So there's a lot of
hurdles that the PE fund

00:16:42.495 --> 00:16:46.320
has got to conquer to try
to beat the stock market.

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:49.110
And I looked at one fund.

00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:52.030
A lot of states, a
lot of universities,

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:53.560
and a lot of big
institutions don't

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:55.240
know what their carry fees are.

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:56.830
They don't ask.

00:16:56.830 --> 00:17:00.850
So they're not billed
for a carry fee.

00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:05.589
The fees are deducted before
the investors see their returns.

00:17:05.589 --> 00:17:10.579
The only fee that is disclosed
in an accounting way as 1.8%.

00:17:10.579 --> 00:17:12.849
So unless the state or
the university asks,

00:17:12.849 --> 00:17:14.829
they don't get the carry fee.

00:17:14.829 --> 00:17:17.150
New Jersey is one of the few
states that actually asks.

00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:19.030
So I just put that
up here on the slide.

00:17:19.030 --> 00:17:24.310
It shows you the fees
are about 3% last year.

00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:28.349
Now, the interesting thing
about private equity funds

00:17:28.349 --> 00:17:31.230
is the performance--

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:33.510
for the positive,
performance is really

00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:36.030
dominated by the
top quartile, which

00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:39.790
means the top 25% of
funds do very well.

00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:42.210
The second quartile is
around the stock market,

00:17:42.210 --> 00:17:45.150
and the third and
fourth are below.

00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:48.410
So you've got half the
people that don't have

00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:50.312
a very good batting average.

00:17:50.312 --> 00:17:51.770
And if you look at
venture capital,

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:56.540
the chart would be
very, kind of, similar.

00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:59.550
The interesting thing about
those performance numbers

00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:01.560
is that a lot of the
performance numbers

00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:04.390
are based on transactions
that haven't been sold yet.

00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:06.660
In other words, the PE firm
has bought the company--

00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:08.780
hasn't sold it yet.

00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:10.750
So how are they measuring
their performance?

00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:14.330
Well, they have the
ability to mark to market

00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:16.700
their own investments.

00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:18.110
Nobody's really double-checking.

00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:20.090
Like the auditors,
the investors,

00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:23.105
the limited partners
do not check.

00:18:23.105 --> 00:18:25.560
It's sort of an honor system
that always surprised me.

00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:27.440
Maybe I'm a little
hard-bitten and cynical.

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:30.860
But it surprised me that
trillions of dollars going in,

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:32.930
and nobody's really checking it.

00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:36.590
So I liken the whole
process to a third grader

00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:39.380
grading their own
homework, which

00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:42.180
is a little strange for
this kind of business.

00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:43.820
So here's the evidence.

00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:49.080
So if you look at buyout funds,
these are, like, 10 years ago.

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:52.520
And this is statistics--
are reasonably recent.

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:56.120
You can see, even,
like, 2010, 2011, most

00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:57.980
of the returns that
they're vouching for

00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:01.215
haven't happened yet
in terms of cash.

00:19:01.215 --> 00:19:03.810
Now, these deals
haven't been sold.

00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:06.750
So you've got funds that are
seven, eight, nine years old

00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:09.510
that haven't sold half
the stuff they own yet.

00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:13.550
So I question a little bit
whether they're worth as much

00:19:13.550 --> 00:19:15.300
as the managers say they are.

00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:23.260
So if you want to get a
little more into the weeds,

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:26.170
are they really worth
as much as they said?

00:19:26.170 --> 00:19:27.880
I did a study with
one of my colleagues.

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:32.930
And we looked at what was the
market experience in the crash?

00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:36.260
You would expect a company
with more leverage,

00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:39.930
like the portfolio companies
of a leveraged buyout fund

00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:42.260
to decline more than the
stock market for the reasons

00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:43.680
I mentioned earlier.

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:46.070
But if you look at
the way they reported

00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:49.910
it, the leveraged buyout
industry said, guess what?

00:19:49.910 --> 00:19:53.210
Our results were better
than the stock market,

00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:55.680
despite our higher leverage.

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:58.560
So that, again, would
strike me as being

00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:01.080
totally the opposite of what
finance theory would tell you.

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:06.230
So we call that--

00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:08.970
"return smoothing"
is the expression.

00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:13.100
So you have the flexibility
to put your own markings

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:14.330
on your portfolio.

00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:16.400
You're obviously going to
do it a little slightly

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:18.440
in your favor, if you're
a rational person,

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:20.570
to make yourself look better.

00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:22.220
Of course, as I
said, the sales pitch

00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:25.680
is, not only do we have higher
returns in the stock market,

00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:28.170
but we're also less volatile.

00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:31.860
Anyway, the sales pitch
has made believers out

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:33.090
of a lot of big institutions.

00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:37.050
And so I looked, again
with one of my colleagues--

00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:39.930
we looked at pension fund
returns to the big states,

00:20:39.930 --> 00:20:42.560
like California,
New York, Maryland.

00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:44.010
We looked at their
pension funds.

00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:47.850
And they've made a
much larger dedication

00:20:47.850 --> 00:20:50.220
to alternative assets
like private equity

00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:52.790
funds, hedge funds.

00:20:52.790 --> 00:20:57.360
But that stampede into private
equity and other alternatives

00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:00.880
has not really provided
a higher level of return.

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:04.350
So if you just compare your
average state pension fund

00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:07.950
or endowment with a
60/40 index that you

00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:11.760
can buy from
Vanguard or Fidelity,

00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:14.610
there's a big difference
if 60/40 outperforms that

00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:16.174
by a significant margin.

00:21:16.174 --> 00:21:18.090
People that aren't really
acquainted with math

00:21:18.090 --> 00:21:20.520
say, well, it's only 1%.

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:21.940
What's the big deal?

00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:25.050
But if you're running
a $50 billion pension,

00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:30.510
and it's 1% every year,
that's $500 million a year.

00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:32.880
Sooner or later, you're
talking some serious cash.

00:21:35.862 --> 00:21:38.010
So how do these
institutions, how

00:21:38.010 --> 00:21:39.750
do they pick the
private equity funds?

00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:41.150
They're trying to do their best.

00:21:41.150 --> 00:21:44.970
They're trying to find ones
that are in the top quartile.

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:46.630
How do they do it?

00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:48.660
So there's two ways they do it.

00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:53.960
One is they look at a fund
that was in the top quartile

00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:55.410
previously.

00:21:55.410 --> 00:21:59.310
So that fund is coming out with,
let's say, fund number two.

00:21:59.310 --> 00:22:02.730
So the investor would
say, OK, they did well

00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:03.540
in fund number one.

00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:08.870
I presume they'll repeat the
performance in fund number two

00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:10.500
or fund number
three, in this case.

00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:15.650
So what is the
statistical probability

00:22:15.650 --> 00:22:20.410
of the third or the second
fund beating the prior fund?

00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:26.400
It's about 30%.

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:29.030
So it's almost random.

00:22:29.030 --> 00:22:33.800
So that, in Wall Street terms,
that's called mean reversion.

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:35.790
You may be doing
well for a while,

00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:38.230
but then, gradually,
as time goes on,

00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:40.665
you revert to the average.

00:22:40.665 --> 00:22:43.330
You're the same
as everybody else.

00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:45.270
So with LBOs, it's about 30%.

00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:46.740
So it's almost random.

00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:49.980
With VC, there seems to
be more staying power.

00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:54.810
VC firms are more adept at
repeating their performance.

00:22:54.810 --> 00:22:56.630
Now that's one option.

00:22:56.630 --> 00:23:01.079
So you try to go to
your top-quartile funds,

00:23:01.079 --> 00:23:02.620
and hope they repeat
the performance.

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:05.060
Unfortunately,
most of them don't.

00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:07.840
So what about option number B?

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:12.220
That would be where you say,
I'm just going to play it safe.

00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:14.750
I'm going to pick a
big brand-name fund.

00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:18.650
I'll go with Goldman, or Carlyle
Group, or Kohlberg Kravis.

00:23:18.650 --> 00:23:20.730
They've got six or seven funds.

00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:21.480
There's a history.

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:22.870
They're big names.

00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:25.490
I'll just invest in them.

00:23:25.490 --> 00:23:27.460
The problem with
that is that if you

00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:30.550
look at the big-fund
families, like Carlyle,

00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:37.570
or Apollo, or KKR, they don't
outperform the no-name fund.

00:23:37.570 --> 00:23:42.730
So strategy A or B doesn't
seem to be a good option.

00:23:42.730 --> 00:23:46.180
B, obviously gives the
people at the pension

00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:48.820
fund or the endowment
some air cover.

00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:51.160
They can always say,
well, it wasn't my fault

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:52.360
that the fund screwed up.

00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:54.010
I went with Goldman Sachs.

00:23:54.010 --> 00:23:57.491
They're supposed to
know what they're doing.

00:23:57.491 --> 00:23:58.990
So there's the old
saying, you can't

00:23:58.990 --> 00:24:01.300
get fired by going with IBM.

00:24:01.300 --> 00:24:04.570
It would be the same thing in
the private equity business.

00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:12.130
Portfolio patterns-- how does
it look with these funds?

00:24:12.130 --> 00:24:15.500
If you've got 10 companies in a
fund, like a leveraged buyout,

00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:17.620
you've got about three
that will go bankrupt

00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:19.660
because of the high debt.

00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:22.210
Sometimes it doesn't work out
when you borrow a lot of money.

00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:24.400
Four will be OK in
terms of returns.

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:25.900
Three will be, as
the saying goes,

00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:30.220
home runs where it might be
a 20% or 30% rate of return.

00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:32.357
The VCs are a little different.

00:24:32.357 --> 00:24:33.690
There, it's more of a crapshoot.

00:24:33.690 --> 00:24:35.370
You're dealing with
younger companies.

00:24:35.370 --> 00:24:37.510
A lot of times
they're technology,

00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:39.190
so they're undeveloped.

00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:42.150
The customer base in
technology are not known.

00:24:42.150 --> 00:24:45.360
So you've got a lot
more bankruptcies.

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:49.320
When they do hit a premium
return, it could be very high,

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:52.560
just big returns on, say,
a boring, low-tech company

00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:53.750
in the buyout business.

00:24:56.830 --> 00:24:58.900
Couple of case studies
for those of you

00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:01.540
that are interested
in venture capital.

00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:03.290
I'm sure you've all
heard of this one--

00:25:03.290 --> 00:25:04.900
Theranos.

00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:06.730
I guess, once you get
on "Forbes" magazine,

00:25:06.730 --> 00:25:09.550
that's, like, the end of it.

00:25:09.550 --> 00:25:12.910
I always used to think,
when some CEO writes a book,

00:25:12.910 --> 00:25:14.380
the stock is going to tank.

00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:15.880
Because I've seen
so many instances

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:17.921
where there's a book come
out, and then the stock

00:25:17.921 --> 00:25:19.750
of the company tanks.

00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:21.400
This story is kind
of well-known.

00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:24.240
She invented the--
what people thought

00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:27.570
was an exclusive technology to
do blood tests just pricking

00:25:27.570 --> 00:25:31.290
your finger instead of
getting a needle in your arm.

00:25:31.290 --> 00:25:33.960
And people were
buying the story,

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:35.850
put in hundreds of
millions of dollars

00:25:35.850 --> 00:25:39.480
from very knowledgeable
Silicon Valley investors.

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:40.980
She got a lot of publicity.

00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:42.180
Most of it was pretty good.

00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:44.490
The value of the company
on a private basis

00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:46.500
went all the way
up to $9 billion

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:51.150
until the roof caved in when
the "Journal" started picking up

00:25:51.150 --> 00:25:54.240
rumors that the technology
really wasn't what

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:56.491
she and others said it was.

00:25:56.491 --> 00:25:57.990
And of course, the
company, I guess,

00:25:57.990 --> 00:26:00.090
just announced it was
liquidating a couple of weeks

00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:00.589
ago.

00:26:00.589 --> 00:26:05.180
So the investors and the
equity were totally wiped out.

00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:06.410
What about a good one?

00:26:06.410 --> 00:26:07.314
Why talk about bad?

00:26:07.314 --> 00:26:08.480
Let's talk about a good one.

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:09.830
There are many good ones.

00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:12.920
Roku is a real success story.

00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:15.410
So it's about 10 years old.

00:26:15.410 --> 00:26:18.899
They invented the first
streaming box for Netflix.

00:26:18.899 --> 00:26:20.690
And then they developed
some other products

00:26:20.690 --> 00:26:24.050
and went the normal
process that you'd

00:26:24.050 --> 00:26:27.290
like to see for a high-tech
company of raising

00:26:27.290 --> 00:26:30.290
VC and gradually
getting a higher value

00:26:30.290 --> 00:26:32.690
and then going public
at a big number.

00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:35.730
And everybody got a
terrific rate of return.

00:26:35.730 --> 00:26:38.790
Now Roku is still losing money
despite all this success.

00:26:38.790 --> 00:26:41.810
So we're just going to have
to wait and see in a few years

00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:45.440
if it turns out to be a real
solid business entity that

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:48.780
can sustain its momentum.

00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:53.730
So you might say, why
do people still invest?

00:26:53.730 --> 00:26:57.030
Why do big institutions
invest in private equity?

00:26:57.030 --> 00:27:00.310
Haven't they seen
these statistics?

00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:04.500
Well, I'm a little bit of
a student of human nature.

00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:08.660
And I've come up with a
few theories about it,

00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:10.840
having talked to many people.

00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:13.000
So I think one
category of investor

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.554
may be a true optimist.

00:27:15.554 --> 00:27:17.470
People always like to
think they can do better

00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:18.440
than the stock market.

00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:21.350
They're saying, I think I've got
a plan that we can do better,

00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:24.440
and I think private
equity is the way to go.

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:26.260
So these would be
the true believers.

00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:29.380
And I was doing some work on
behalf of New Jersey employee

00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:30.580
unions.

00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:35.140
And I was looking at the
private equity portfolio.

00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:39.490
And I remember hearing the head
of the investment committee

00:27:39.490 --> 00:27:40.660
talk.

00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:44.080
And he's saying, Mr. Hooke
doesn't know anything.

00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:49.150
We only invest in the top
quartile private equity funds.

00:27:49.150 --> 00:27:53.026
They invested in 100 different
funds, and I looked at them.

00:27:53.026 --> 00:27:54.400
And I looked at
their performance

00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:56.300
on a private equity database.

00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:58.830
And they weren't top quartile.

00:27:58.830 --> 00:28:00.580
They weren't bottom,
but they weren't top.

00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:02.970
If you took all
100 together, they

00:28:02.970 --> 00:28:05.140
were exactly in the middle.

00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:06.870
They were doing, say,
between the second

00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:09.245
and the third quartile, which
is what you'd expect if you

00:28:09.245 --> 00:28:10.860
selected the funds at random.

00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:14.750
But you have these people
that simply believe that.

00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:20.270
Now, the other group would
be institutional investors

00:28:20.270 --> 00:28:22.720
that listen to their
consultants a lot.

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:24.730
So every big pension
fund-- most endowments

00:28:24.730 --> 00:28:27.220
will have a consultant that
would tell them, here's

00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:29.067
the portfolio
allocation you have.

00:28:29.067 --> 00:28:31.150
You should allocate some
to stocks, some to bonds,

00:28:31.150 --> 00:28:33.740
and some to alternatives.

00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:35.650
So they're always
pushing alternatives,

00:28:35.650 --> 00:28:37.390
these consultants.

00:28:37.390 --> 00:28:38.890
And so if you listen
to them, you're

00:28:38.890 --> 00:28:40.942
going to be in
alternatives yourself.

00:28:40.942 --> 00:28:42.400
Now a cynic might
say, why are they

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:45.850
pushing alternatives if they
have seen these statistics?

00:28:45.850 --> 00:28:47.530
Well, if you are
consultant, you're

00:28:47.530 --> 00:28:51.514
getting paid millions
of dollars a year,

00:28:51.514 --> 00:28:52.930
why would they
continue paying you

00:28:52.930 --> 00:28:55.650
if you just walked into
the office and said,

00:28:55.650 --> 00:28:57.990
I think you should index
the whole portfolio?

00:28:57.990 --> 00:29:00.115
Well, then they say, well,
what do we need you for?

00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:05.800
C is the one I think is
probably the most applicable.

00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:06.860
And it's unfortunate.

00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:09.379
But if you're working
at a big endowment,

00:29:09.379 --> 00:29:11.420
or if you're working at
a big state pension fund,

00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:14.410
you're in the investment office.

00:29:14.410 --> 00:29:17.079
You have a job of
picking managers usually.

00:29:17.079 --> 00:29:18.870
So you're not investing
the money yourself.

00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:21.420
But you're picking managers
in stocks, or bonds,

00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:24.430
or hedge funds,
or private equity.

00:29:24.430 --> 00:29:28.080
So it's unlikely
that you are going

00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:30.330
to look at all the numbers
and say, well, our strategy

00:29:30.330 --> 00:29:30.930
is wrong.

00:29:30.930 --> 00:29:33.270
We screwed it up to last
10 years because we're not

00:29:33.270 --> 00:29:36.380
beating a 60/40.

00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:40.970
Those people's jobs
are dependent on having

00:29:40.970 --> 00:29:44.040
a lot of different investments
to manage and supervise.

00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:47.510
So if they were to walk into
the board of directors office

00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:51.560
and say, we can't produce any
premium return over an index

00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:54.420
so I, therefore, hand
in my resignation.

00:29:54.420 --> 00:29:59.160
Not many people are
going to do that.

00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:01.640
In finance, that's
called an agency problem

00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:05.600
where the investors are using
the managers as agents, hoping

00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:08.060
to get a good return.

00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:12.670
And the last one is really what
I call the Stockholm syndrome.

00:30:12.670 --> 00:30:15.800
The Stockholm syndrome
is based on people,

00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:17.780
like, 20 or 30 years
ago that were kidnapped

00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:21.540
by a gang in Stockholm, Sweden.

00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:24.390
And so over time, as
they were kept captive,

00:30:24.390 --> 00:30:28.700
they started sympathizing
with their kidnappers,

00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:30.909
believing what the
kidnappers told them.

00:30:30.909 --> 00:30:32.450
And it was kind of
a very interesting

00:30:32.450 --> 00:30:36.450
psychological
experiment or situation.

00:30:36.450 --> 00:30:41.140
So if you talk to people in
the business, many of them

00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:43.120
go to conferences,
and they're all

00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:46.405
talking about how great private
equity is or hedge fund.

00:30:46.405 --> 00:30:47.780
And so if you hang
around people,

00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:51.920
and they talk about this
stuff, you start to believe it.

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:53.590
That might be the fourth theory.

00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:55.660
But again, as I said,
I think probably C

00:30:55.660 --> 00:31:00.610
might be the overriding
theory of why we still

00:31:00.610 --> 00:31:04.080
see a lot of private equity.

00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:06.090
I like to tell my classes
at the university,

00:31:06.090 --> 00:31:10.360
private equity M&amp;A is a
business for optimists.

00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:12.370
So you have to
think you're going

00:31:12.370 --> 00:31:14.630
to do better than the average.

00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:17.890
And human nature tends to be,
in many cases, optimistic.

00:31:17.890 --> 00:31:20.230
And that's the investment
business in a nutshell.

00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:21.940
If you think you can
get higher returns,

00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:24.970
you're going to be an optimist
relative to many others.

00:31:28.050 --> 00:31:31.320
So there's a little
bit of a circular facet

00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:34.590
to this where you've got
the claims of the PE funds.

00:31:34.590 --> 00:31:37.810
And they basically
can, as I said,

00:31:37.810 --> 00:31:40.530
mark to market their
own businesses.

00:31:40.530 --> 00:31:43.380
Many PE fees are secret,
so people don't know

00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:47.040
what the states are paying.

00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:50.470
Accounting doesn't require
that the fees be disclosed.

00:31:50.470 --> 00:31:54.042
So it's a
self-perpetuating circle,

00:31:54.042 --> 00:31:55.250
and it's been very effective.

00:31:55.250 --> 00:31:57.860
That's why, if you believe in
the efficient market theory,

00:31:57.860 --> 00:31:59.180
you'd say, well, wait a second.

00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:00.836
Time out.

00:32:00.836 --> 00:32:02.960
There shouldn't be a private
equity industry as big

00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:04.250
as it is.

00:32:04.250 --> 00:32:06.110
But the market's
not quite efficient,

00:32:06.110 --> 00:32:08.900
because the information
simply isn't out there

00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:11.650
for many of the investors.

00:32:11.650 --> 00:32:17.310
So on that note, I will stop
and take a few questions.

00:32:17.310 --> 00:32:20.010
Anybody have a question
they'd like to ask?

00:32:23.632 --> 00:32:24.590
AUDIENCE: Thanks, Jeff.

00:32:24.590 --> 00:32:26.210
Appreciate the talk.

00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:28.820
I was wondering if you
had the same sort of view

00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:35.830
towards private equity
funds that, say,

00:32:35.830 --> 00:32:37.720
that they specialize
in a particular asset

00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:43.390
class like real estate or
infrastructure funds versus,

00:32:43.390 --> 00:32:45.535
I guess--

00:32:45.535 --> 00:32:49.990
well, yeah, do you have any
thoughts about those types

00:32:49.990 --> 00:32:55.270
of funds, how they
compare to funds that

00:32:55.270 --> 00:33:01.540
are purchasing businesses, like
LBOs versus, we invest in roads

00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:02.422
or whatever?

00:33:02.422 --> 00:33:03.380
JEFFERY C. HOOKE: Sure.

00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:06.430
Well, infrastructure
funds are kind

00:33:06.430 --> 00:33:12.210
of too new to be analyzed in
that way where you can look

00:33:12.210 --> 00:33:14.379
at a long-term track record.

00:33:14.379 --> 00:33:16.170
The other problem with
infrastructure funds

00:33:16.170 --> 00:33:18.720
is there tends to be no
public equivalent that's

00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:23.310
easily definable in the same
way as a private Infrastructure

00:33:23.310 --> 00:33:23.812
fund.

00:33:23.812 --> 00:33:25.020
So that would be a tough one.

00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:28.060
Real estate, on the other
hand, has a long track record.

00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:32.370
So private real estate funds
would do roughly the same

00:33:32.370 --> 00:33:35.067
as publicly-traded REITs,
Real Estate Investment

00:33:35.067 --> 00:33:37.650
Trusts that are publicly-traded
vehicles that buy real estate.

00:33:40.387 --> 00:33:42.220
I haven't done a whole
lot of study on this.

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:45.030
But if you look at
private real estate funds,

00:33:45.030 --> 00:33:47.400
they also tend to
be less volatile

00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:49.020
than publicly-traded
REITs, which

00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:53.808
has raised some questions about
their mark to market ability.

00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:57.690
AUDIENCE: I think I'm
pretty [INAUDIBLE]..

00:33:57.690 --> 00:33:59.773
JEFFERY C. HOOKE:
[? Pernesh, ?] you got one here?

00:33:59.773 --> 00:34:00.860
Go ahead.

00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:03.280
AUDIENCE: So I noticed that
there were folks like Ray

00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:07.000
[INAUDIBLE] and whatnot--

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.670
the fact that they
kind of double-dip--

00:34:08.670 --> 00:34:11.590
they're in the VC world,
and they're also in PE--

00:34:11.590 --> 00:34:13.960
what is that called
when they do both,

00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:18.159
or they kind of play
around in both worlds?

00:34:18.159 --> 00:34:20.560
JEFFERY C. HOOKE: Well,
it's clear these folks are

00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:22.810
running a business, right?

00:34:22.810 --> 00:34:25.389
They're running a business
to obviously benefit

00:34:25.389 --> 00:34:26.679
their investors.

00:34:26.679 --> 00:34:28.630
But also, they've got
to benefit themselves

00:34:28.630 --> 00:34:30.870
as the owners of the
business or the PE fund.

00:34:30.870 --> 00:34:33.639
So the trend for
the larger ones is,

00:34:33.639 --> 00:34:36.070
we've done about
all we can in VC.

00:34:36.070 --> 00:34:38.848
We can't grow much bigger in
that market, because there just

00:34:38.848 --> 00:34:40.139
aren't enough good investments.

00:34:40.139 --> 00:34:42.850
So it's not unusual that they
say, well, some of the skills

00:34:42.850 --> 00:34:45.764
are very similar
to private equity.

00:34:45.764 --> 00:34:47.889
So we'll take what we've
learned in venture capital

00:34:47.889 --> 00:34:52.211
and transfer it to growth
equity or, maybe not buyouts,

00:34:52.211 --> 00:34:52.960
but growth equity.

00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:53.630
And I agree with them.

00:34:53.630 --> 00:34:55.921
I think there are a lot of
similarities-- deal closing,

00:34:55.921 --> 00:34:57.850
evaluation of
companies, evaluation

00:34:57.850 --> 00:34:59.800
of management and markets.

00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:01.160
So it's a natural progression.

00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:03.160
And you've seen some of
the bigger buyout firms,

00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:05.170
not only go into
growth capital--

00:35:05.170 --> 00:35:07.360
not so much venture
capital-- but you

00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:09.400
see them going into hedge funds.

00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:11.290
You see them going
into lending, where

00:35:11.290 --> 00:35:13.690
they say, well, we've
done a lot of buyout deals

00:35:13.690 --> 00:35:14.620
as an equity investor.

00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:16.300
We can also do lending.

00:35:16.300 --> 00:35:18.360
So it's just diversifying
your business

00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:22.738
makes the patterns of earnings
more stable and predictable.

00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:30.370
AUDIENCE: I was wondering if you
know any differences in, say,

00:35:30.370 --> 00:35:33.760
attitude for
investing in cultures,

00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:35.670
for example, in other
countries, like Asia,

00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:37.904
versus the United States?

00:35:37.904 --> 00:35:39.820
JEFFERY C. HOOKE: I got
into Asia quite a bit.

00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:43.990
I think you've
got to distinguish

00:35:43.990 --> 00:35:47.700
between retail investors
and institutions.

00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:51.580
If you go to retail
in Asia, I think

00:35:51.580 --> 00:35:56.440
they're much more
interested in speculation.

00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:59.170
Here, I think investors,
even the retail

00:35:59.170 --> 00:36:01.030
tend to be more
analytically inclined.

00:36:01.030 --> 00:36:04.100
And they might study the
PE ratio of the company,

00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:05.530
and how does it
compare to others,

00:36:05.530 --> 00:36:08.210
and what's the growth record,
and all that sort of thing.

00:36:08.210 --> 00:36:12.454
But I think the Asian retail
investor will be saying,

00:36:12.454 --> 00:36:14.870
oh, I heard it's a hot stock,
and they go and buy it-- not

00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:16.704
do much analysis.

00:36:16.704 --> 00:36:19.120
Not that they don't do that
here in the States and Europe,

00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:22.200
but I think they'd be a little
more on the speculative side.

00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:25.020
Institutionally, I haven't
noticed much difference

00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:28.140
between, say, a big Chinese
sovereign wealth fund and, say,

00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:29.040
a big university.

00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:32.370
I think they tend to
travel in the same circles,

00:36:32.370 --> 00:36:37.130
and they sort of do the
similar investing techniques.

00:36:37.130 --> 00:36:39.749
See you later, Kurt.

00:36:39.749 --> 00:36:40.540
AUDIENCE: Hi, Jeff.

00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:43.480
Thanks for the talk.

00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:46.420
Just riffing off the
previous question,

00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:49.540
if you said the retail
investors in certain countries

00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:54.730
or locations tend to be more
whimsical or so, have you seen,

00:36:54.730 --> 00:37:00.930
in your studies,
a correlation, we

00:37:00.930 --> 00:37:03.630
would say, of PE
being successful

00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:06.150
in some areas versus not--

00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:08.870
some emerging markets versus--

00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:12.120
there are these
compounding factors

00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:16.505
that basically make them any
bit more successful or not?

00:37:16.505 --> 00:37:17.880
JEFFERY C. HOOKE:
Well, there are

00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:21.930
PE in lots of
emerging markets now.

00:37:21.930 --> 00:37:24.390
But it's a relatively
new phenomenon.

00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:31.050
Private equity in, say, India,
or Malaysia, or South Africa--

00:37:31.050 --> 00:37:33.480
I don't think there's enough
data points really to measure

00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:36.550
it, whether they have PE
funds in emerging markets

00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:38.470
have beaten the ones--

00:37:38.470 --> 00:37:40.470
I shouldn't say-- where
they've beaten the stock

00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:41.570
markets in those countries.

00:37:41.570 --> 00:37:43.736
I just don't think there's
enough information there.

00:37:46.570 --> 00:37:49.386
AUDIENCE: Thank you
for the lecture.

00:37:49.386 --> 00:37:52.214
I couldn't help but note the--

00:37:52.214 --> 00:37:53.630
you presented a
great slide, which

00:37:53.630 --> 00:37:57.620
was the history of performance
relative to the S&amp;P

00:37:57.620 --> 00:37:59.300
or was it a 60/40?

00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:02.395
I wasn't quite clear which.

00:38:02.395 --> 00:38:05.060
And it seemed
fairly clear that it

00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:10.230
was working relative to
the S&amp;P for a good while

00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:11.450
and then stopped.

00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:15.860
Do you have any theories
about why that is?

00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:17.710
JEFFERY C. HOOKE:
Yeah, of course, I do.

00:38:17.710 --> 00:38:18.769
Sure.

00:38:18.769 --> 00:38:20.060
I wouldn't be here if I didn't.

00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:28.280
I've talked to a bunch of
people in the business about it.

00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:30.620
I think, when there
was a lot of success,

00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:35.720
as this chart points
out, investors just

00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:39.950
started buying into these funds
based on their historical track

00:38:39.950 --> 00:38:41.190
record.

00:38:41.190 --> 00:38:45.260
And so as I sort of
suggested, as people

00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:49.690
pile into these funds, the
prices for the targets--

00:38:49.690 --> 00:38:51.220
because there's
only so many targets

00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:54.760
out there that fit the
requirements to be a buyout

00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:56.170
candidate, for example--

00:38:56.170 --> 00:38:59.080
so the price of the
targets, therefore, went up.

00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:01.120
So as the price of
the targets goes up,

00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:04.300
the corresponding return to the
LBO investor drops a little.

00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:06.850
It doesn't go to zero,
but it drops a little.

00:39:06.850 --> 00:39:09.970
And so the difference, you can
see, is illustrated by here.

00:39:09.970 --> 00:39:14.020
Once people started looking at
this track record, they got--

00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:17.830
'05, '06, '07 were some of the
biggest years for new funds.

00:39:17.830 --> 00:39:19.750
So there's a lot of
competition for deals.

00:39:19.750 --> 00:39:22.820
And I noticed that because I
am part time at an investment

00:39:22.820 --> 00:39:23.320
bank.

00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:26.200
And I see the competition
for transactions

00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:29.680
where, for an LBO candidate,
we might get six, seven offers.

00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:30.730
So who's the winner?

00:39:30.730 --> 00:39:33.090
The one that offers
the higher price.

00:39:33.090 --> 00:39:35.920
Of course, the winner,
then, could be the loser

00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:37.750
as they're paying
too high a price.

00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:40.330
So you've got supply-demand
because there's

00:39:40.330 --> 00:39:44.560
so much money trying to
find the same transaction.

00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:46.840
The other aspect
would be the fees.

00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:48.930
The fees are just high.

00:39:48.930 --> 00:39:51.010
So if you've got a
pretty high fee level,

00:39:51.010 --> 00:39:55.280
that's just going to be
a drag on the return.

00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:57.670
Any other questions?

00:39:57.670 --> 00:39:58.653
I got one over here.

00:40:02.127 --> 00:40:06.910
AUDIENCE: Similar to that
point, in the last few years,

00:40:06.910 --> 00:40:11.150
there's been a lot of
discussion about the value--

00:40:11.150 --> 00:40:15.070
just [INAUDIBLE] index
funds and go that route.

00:40:15.070 --> 00:40:18.520
And so a lot of money is
flooding that way now.

00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:20.350
And do you anticipate
that there's

00:40:20.350 --> 00:40:22.764
any type of similar
kind of effect

00:40:22.764 --> 00:40:24.930
that was actaully had when
you saw the returns on PE

00:40:24.930 --> 00:40:25.510
was great.

00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:27.593
A lot of money came that
way and, eventually, then

00:40:27.593 --> 00:40:29.160
the returns aren't there?

00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:31.750
Is there any potential the same
thing's happening on the index

00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:33.374
side now that people
are just investing

00:40:33.374 --> 00:40:35.292
their equity into index funds?

00:40:35.292 --> 00:40:37.000
JEFFERY C. HOOKE: I
think, at some point,

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:40.060
if there's too much money
going into index funds,

00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:42.610
then there's going to be
more opportunities for stock

00:40:42.610 --> 00:40:43.510
pickers--

00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:46.330
people that study and then
pick individual stocks.

00:40:46.330 --> 00:40:51.190
Because so many passive
funds will misprice.

00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:53.290
They're just buying stuff
based on market cap.

00:40:53.290 --> 00:40:56.920
But if you look at the retail
market for mutual funds,

00:40:56.920 --> 00:40:59.410
it's about 30% indexed.

00:40:59.410 --> 00:41:04.180
And institutionally,
big pools of money

00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:07.390
like pension funds, or
endowments, or universities,

00:41:07.390 --> 00:41:13.580
I think the indexing is only
around 15, so it's small.

00:41:13.580 --> 00:41:15.400
So when I've thought
about it and talked

00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:18.130
with people, whose
opinions I respect,

00:41:18.130 --> 00:41:22.070
I think the indexing part
can probably go to 75% or 80%

00:41:22.070 --> 00:41:25.760
before indexing
returns will then

00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:30.530
be beat by those people
that aren't indexing.

00:41:30.530 --> 00:41:32.760
So there's a long way
to go, long way to go.

00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:35.060
The other thing is that--

00:41:35.060 --> 00:41:36.860
perhaps I should
correct myself--

00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:39.320
there are a lot
of people managing

00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:42.590
money that do what's
called closet indexing.

00:41:42.590 --> 00:41:47.140
So they're running a big large
cap fund for some money manager

00:41:47.140 --> 00:41:49.010
or some state pension fund.

00:41:49.010 --> 00:41:53.470
So they're trying to conform
their results to the large cap

00:41:53.470 --> 00:41:54.580
index.

00:41:54.580 --> 00:41:56.039
So they are, in effect--

00:41:56.039 --> 00:41:58.330
even though they claim they're
picking stocks and doing

00:41:58.330 --> 00:42:00.220
all kinds of analysis--
they're trying

00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:03.430
to stay close to what the
stocks are in the index

00:42:03.430 --> 00:42:05.700
so that they won't
outperform or underperform it

00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:07.630
by any meaningful amount.

00:42:07.630 --> 00:42:10.520
So that's a very conservative
strategy, you might say.

00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:13.780
But I think, if you
include closet indexing--

00:42:13.780 --> 00:42:16.420
my percentages, you
maybe double them

00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:17.890
for what's indexed right now.

00:42:21.994 --> 00:42:22.630
Over here.

00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:27.200
AUDIENCE: Thank you
for the talk, Jeff.

00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:28.570
I have a question.

00:42:28.570 --> 00:42:31.840
So do you think the competition
from the private equity

00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:36.440
actually leaked or
affect the public market?

00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:38.490
For example, for
the recent year,

00:42:38.490 --> 00:42:47.950
it seems the price of the IPO
or the valuation of the IPO

00:42:47.950 --> 00:42:52.600
is pretty high, and there's
not much juice out of the IPO.

00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:54.795
So is that part of it?

00:42:54.795 --> 00:42:56.170
JEFFERY C. HOOKE:
So the question

00:42:56.170 --> 00:42:58.780
is, is the private
equity market competing

00:42:58.780 --> 00:43:02.020
with the public market
for new listings?

00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:04.030
I'd say, absolutely.

00:43:04.030 --> 00:43:06.730
You have a lot of
companies that you'd think

00:43:06.730 --> 00:43:09.910
would be a good IPO candidates.

00:43:09.910 --> 00:43:13.430
And they're saying there's
so much private equity

00:43:13.430 --> 00:43:15.289
money out there, why
should I do an IPO?

00:43:15.289 --> 00:43:17.580
Because it's a pain in the
neck to be a public company.

00:43:17.580 --> 00:43:19.663
You've got everything laid
out there for everybody

00:43:19.663 --> 00:43:20.720
to read about.

00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:24.230
You've got so many regulatory
matters you have to address.

00:43:24.230 --> 00:43:28.370
Everything that you talk about
on TV or in press releases

00:43:28.370 --> 00:43:31.160
can be microscoped by a lawyer.

00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:34.400
So for many companies, I
think it's a better idea

00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:35.604
to go private equity.

00:43:35.604 --> 00:43:37.020
So there's so much
private equity,

00:43:37.020 --> 00:43:40.940
I think they're really
retarding the number of IPOs.

00:43:40.940 --> 00:43:45.530
And I don't see that
process slowing down.

00:43:45.530 --> 00:43:47.520
I personally, would
like to see more IPOs

00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:49.880
so public investors
have a shot at getting

00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:51.360
into a lot of growth companies.

00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:54.920
But right now, there's just
too much private equity money

00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:56.390
available.

00:43:56.390 --> 00:43:59.090
And I'm sure you see it here
in Silicon Valley a lot.

00:43:59.090 --> 00:44:00.923
You see a good little
company and say, well,

00:44:00.923 --> 00:44:02.390
gee, that's a good
IPO candidate.

00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:04.170
But it's just not happening.

00:44:04.170 --> 00:44:06.680
The other factor, which
you often hear mentioned,

00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:09.530
is that the investment
banking community

00:44:09.530 --> 00:44:11.400
has shrunk considerably.

00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:13.550
So now you probably
have 5 or 10 firms that

00:44:13.550 --> 00:44:15.670
really dominate the business.

00:44:15.670 --> 00:44:18.260
And they would
dominate IPOs as well.

00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:22.580
So they tend to want
to see bigger deals.

00:44:22.580 --> 00:44:23.620
They're big companies.

00:44:23.620 --> 00:44:26.270
It's economical for
them to do large IPOs.

00:44:26.270 --> 00:44:28.820
So with the demise
of many smaller banks

00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:32.390
who got acquired
or just closed, you

00:44:32.390 --> 00:44:34.536
don't see as many smaller deals.

00:44:34.536 --> 00:44:36.410
There just aren't enough
people to sell them.

00:44:36.410 --> 00:44:39.000
So you've got those
two factors, I think,

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.390
working against the public
market-- having more listings,

00:44:41.390 --> 00:44:43.942
at least for now.

00:44:43.942 --> 00:44:46.510
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:44:46.510 --> 00:44:50.110
AUDIENCE: I have a general
question about valuation,

00:44:50.110 --> 00:44:53.150
since you've written
such a great book.

00:44:53.150 --> 00:44:58.580
During the Graham times, there
was a lot of focus on price

00:44:58.580 --> 00:44:59.780
to book.

00:44:59.780 --> 00:45:03.990
And then the world moved
on as the economy changed

00:45:03.990 --> 00:45:05.780
and the nature of
businesses changed

00:45:05.780 --> 00:45:10.330
to looking at P/E ratios and
price to free cash flows.

00:45:10.330 --> 00:45:13.630
Do you think there's yet
another paradigm shift,

00:45:13.630 --> 00:45:16.660
or this is more where
a good idea is taken

00:45:16.660 --> 00:45:19.930
to an extreme, which of
the two it is where you

00:45:19.930 --> 00:45:24.040
have a very intangible economy.

00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:26.470
Customers acquired
now, whose values

00:45:26.470 --> 00:45:29.620
are realized over
the long time, and PE

00:45:29.620 --> 00:45:31.310
doesn't reflect that economics?

00:45:31.310 --> 00:45:32.810
JEFFERY C. HOOKE:
Well, you remember

00:45:32.810 --> 00:45:34.900
when Graham and Dodd
wrote that book,

00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:38.360
we were just getting over
a huge stock market crash.

00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:41.120
And so the book was ultra
conservative saying--

00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:44.390
it focused heavily
on the balance sheet.

00:45:44.390 --> 00:45:45.554
That's your backup plan.

00:45:45.554 --> 00:45:46.970
If you had a strong
balance sheet,

00:45:46.970 --> 00:45:49.470
it's unlikely that the
company could go bankrupt.

00:45:49.470 --> 00:45:51.600
So that was sort of
their starting point.

00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:53.330
Look at the balance
sheet, then let's

00:45:53.330 --> 00:45:54.690
look at the income statement.

00:45:54.690 --> 00:45:55.790
So now, it's reversed.

00:45:55.790 --> 00:45:58.970
People are looking much more
at the income statement.

00:45:58.970 --> 00:46:01.850
And I guess that's been
pretty much the fashion

00:46:01.850 --> 00:46:03.300
for the last 30 years.

00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:04.910
And that's sort of
what my book was--

00:46:04.910 --> 00:46:10.100
sort of an update of the Graham
and Dodd authoritative book.

00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:13.110
And I don't think the
paradigm has really changed.

00:46:13.110 --> 00:46:15.830
I think people today
are still focusing

00:46:15.830 --> 00:46:20.430
on, as you kind of
pointed out, cash flow,

00:46:20.430 --> 00:46:22.940
EBITDA, not looking
at the balance sheet

00:46:22.940 --> 00:46:25.040
much unless it's, say,
a financial institution,

00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:28.430
like a bank or an
insurance company.

00:46:28.430 --> 00:46:31.310
What I think has been
noticeable the last few years--

00:46:31.310 --> 00:46:35.060
and this is sort of a
repeat of, say, '99, '98,

00:46:35.060 --> 00:46:38.780
2000-- is people are
more willing to take

00:46:38.780 --> 00:46:41.810
a flyer on companies
that have a good sales

00:46:41.810 --> 00:46:45.470
progression without earnings.

00:46:45.470 --> 00:46:46.970
So they've got good sales.

00:46:46.970 --> 00:46:49.130
Earnings are going
to come later.

00:46:49.130 --> 00:46:54.290
And I think, now is sort of a
repeat of, say, 20 years ago.

00:46:54.290 --> 00:46:57.312
And I think people have
learned their lesson.

00:46:57.312 --> 00:46:59.645
They're probably being a
little more analytical about it

00:46:59.645 --> 00:47:02.270
than they were 20 years
ago-- the last internet boom.

00:47:02.270 --> 00:47:04.970
But I'm still a little
cautious about it.

00:47:04.970 --> 00:47:07.730
I'm still a little
reluctant to advocate

00:47:07.730 --> 00:47:11.832
buying the stock of companies
that have huge losses, even

00:47:11.832 --> 00:47:13.290
though they are
gathering customers

00:47:13.290 --> 00:47:17.327
that could make a return in
the future for the business.

00:47:17.327 --> 00:47:18.824
Yeah?

00:47:18.824 --> 00:47:22.820
AUDIENCE: I guess maybe
what I was trying [? to-- ?]

00:47:22.820 --> 00:47:28.120
on a more unit economic basis
in the last dot-com bubble.

00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:31.090
Probably the companies
were not profitable, even

00:47:31.090 --> 00:47:33.820
on a unit economics
versus today.

00:47:33.820 --> 00:47:36.760
One could argue that,
sure, they're losing money,

00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:39.910
but that's because the fixed
costs right now is very high.

00:47:39.910 --> 00:47:43.240
But on unit economics,
they're still very profitable.

00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:46.725
And if they got the scale,
then those fixed costs

00:47:46.725 --> 00:47:47.350
may be covered.

00:47:47.350 --> 00:47:49.890
Obviously, it's risky to
know whether they [? got ?]

00:47:49.890 --> 00:47:51.250
to the scale or not.

00:47:51.250 --> 00:47:52.645
JEFFERY C. HOOKE: No.

00:47:52.645 --> 00:47:55.060
You're absolutely right.

00:47:55.060 --> 00:47:56.860
Once you've got the
fixed costs in place

00:47:56.860 --> 00:47:59.290
for a lot of these
companies like Uber,

00:47:59.290 --> 00:48:00.940
or Twitter, or
somebody like that--

00:48:00.940 --> 00:48:03.450
once you've got the
fixed costs in place,

00:48:03.450 --> 00:48:07.270
as the customer count goes
up and the revenues go up,

00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:09.910
you're going to get a lot
of pure profit dropping

00:48:09.910 --> 00:48:11.409
to the bottom line.

00:48:11.409 --> 00:48:13.450
But I think, as you and
I talked about yesterday,

00:48:13.450 --> 00:48:16.240
predicting which ones
can actually pull

00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:20.200
that off is a little tough.

00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:21.890
People have tried
it in the past.

00:48:21.890 --> 00:48:24.970
And most of them that picked
10 or 15 companies that are

00:48:24.970 --> 00:48:26.837
similar to ones you describe--

00:48:26.837 --> 00:48:28.420
it's going to be
like venture capital.

00:48:28.420 --> 00:48:31.330
Two or three will be
absolutely fantastic returns.

00:48:31.330 --> 00:48:32.810
Four or five will disappear.

00:48:32.810 --> 00:48:36.400
And then three or
four will be OK.

00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:38.350
I'm sorry that's the
way the statistics work.

00:48:38.350 --> 00:48:39.519
It frustrates people.

00:48:39.519 --> 00:48:41.560
They're saying, well, I
think I can pick winners.

00:48:41.560 --> 00:48:42.685
I've got all this training.

00:48:42.685 --> 00:48:44.240
Or I know the internet business.

00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:47.900
But it's just very hard
to consistently do it.

00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:54.660
AUDIENCE: I had a question.

00:48:54.660 --> 00:48:57.460
In today's low
interest rates, Jeff,

00:48:57.460 --> 00:49:00.630
how do you think about what
your discount rate should be

00:49:00.630 --> 00:49:03.850
and margin of safety should
be in valuing equity?

00:49:03.850 --> 00:49:08.050
JEFFERY C. HOOKE: So a lot of
predictions on the future cash

00:49:08.050 --> 00:49:10.930
flow then have to be
brought back to the present

00:49:10.930 --> 00:49:13.160
if you're doing an
analysis of the company.

00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:15.190
So here, we've
had seven or eight

00:49:15.190 --> 00:49:18.400
years of very low interest
rates by historical standards.

00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:23.410
2% or 3% for government bond is
very low compared to history.

00:49:23.410 --> 00:49:30.179
So what I do and what other
some other more conservative

00:49:30.179 --> 00:49:31.720
investors do is say,
well, now, we're

00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:34.010
in a period of
unusually low rates.

00:49:34.010 --> 00:49:38.680
So if I'm projecting cash flow
15 years out or 10 years out,

00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:44.310
to use 2% or 3% as my
base is just unrealistic.

00:49:44.310 --> 00:49:48.100
So I think a more
rational approach

00:49:48.100 --> 00:49:53.680
is, what's a normal US Treasury
Bond rate for the last 30

00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:54.280
or 40 years?

00:49:54.280 --> 00:49:56.090
Probably around 5% or 6%.

00:49:56.090 --> 00:49:59.950
So I use that as the base rate
for some kind of projection,

00:49:59.950 --> 00:50:01.790
and then I add the risk on top.

00:50:01.790 --> 00:50:06.040
So if you've got your base
rate of 5, you add 6 or 7

00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:08.940
for investing in the stock
market as the equity risk

00:50:08.940 --> 00:50:10.015
that you're facing.

00:50:10.015 --> 00:50:11.890
And then you've got to
add another one or two

00:50:11.890 --> 00:50:14.470
points, depending on
what industry you're in

00:50:14.470 --> 00:50:17.210
or whatever unique
attributes the company has.

00:50:17.210 --> 00:50:20.570
So for a garden variety
equity investment

00:50:20.570 --> 00:50:23.000
I think someone has
to use a discount

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:29.730
rate of, say, 11% or 12%
to be fair and objective.

00:50:29.730 --> 00:50:31.190
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:50:31.190 --> 00:50:32.430
JEFFERY C. HOOKE: Thank you,
[? Pernesh, ?] appreciate it.

00:50:32.430 --> 00:50:33.263
Thank you very much.

00:50:33.263 --> 00:50:35.830
[APPLAUSE]
