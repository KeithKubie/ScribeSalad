enter into various situations with you
 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:45.580
enter into various situations with you
and see how you respond to various

and see how you respond to various
 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.819
and see how you respond to various
things and how you guide them to respond

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:48.829
things and how you guide them to respond
 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:52.209

kids pick up sort of by osmosis right I

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300
kids pick up sort of by osmosis right I
 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.819
kids pick up sort of by osmosis right I
mean I mean they pick up due to the

00:00:57.819 --> 00:00:57.829
mean I mean they pick up due to the
 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.389
mean I mean they pick up due to the
their desire to imitate and to learn

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:01.399
their desire to imitate and to learn
 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:04.090
their desire to imitate and to learn
them to follow that they pick up the

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100
them to follow that they pick up the
 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.840
them to follow that they pick up the
practicalities of your values and and

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850
practicalities of your values and and
 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.010
practicalities of your values and and
and your culture and interestingly this

for us humans so it it's absurd to think
we could start an AI with our current

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090
we could start an AI with our current
 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.330
we could start an AI with our current
human values and they're going to stick

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340
human values and they're going to stick
 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.900
human values and they're going to stick
with our

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910
with our
 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.040
with our
18 human values forever our own values

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050
18 human values forever our own values
 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.560
18 human values forever our own values
are going to drift right so all we can

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.570
are going to drift right so all we can
 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:40.630
are going to drift right so all we can
ask for is the AI starts out with the

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:40.640
ask for is the AI starts out with the
 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.330
ask for is the AI starts out with the
values that we hold dear now and as its

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340
values that we hold dear now and as its
 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.430
values that we hold dear now and as its
values grow and evolve this growth and

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440
values grow and evolve this growth and
 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.290
values grow and evolve this growth and
evolution is coupled with our own growth

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300
evolution is coupled with our own growth
 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.020
evolution is coupled with our own growth
and evolution whose direction we cannot

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030
and evolution whose direction we cannot
 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.470
and evolution whose direction we cannot
foresee at this time

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:53.480
foresee at this time
 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.720
foresee at this time
