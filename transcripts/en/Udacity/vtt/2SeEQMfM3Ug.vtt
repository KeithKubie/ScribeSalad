00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:01.600
All right one other question.

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.740
I'm actually kind of
surprised you didn't ask me,

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:07.160
is what's this rollout nonsense?

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.290
&gt;&gt; I recognize that from
reading about T.D. Gammon.

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:10.460
&gt;&gt; How is it the same?

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.760
&gt;&gt; Because it's a word actually
comes from an understanding of how

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.740
people figure out which backgammon
boards are better or worse.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.240
They actually, the rolling here is
the rolling of the backgammon dice.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.290
&gt;&gt; That's not at all
what I was thinking.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:25.830
&gt;&gt; What are you thinking?

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.150
&gt;&gt; Well, I was just thinking that
we have some roll out policy

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:31.460
which tells us what to
do when we're here.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.320
And I said well let's just act randomly,
but

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.670
I don't know why that's
the right thing to do.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.080
I mean, if I end up here and

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:42.180
I've got to do something we're trying
to get an estimate of this state, and

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.310
taking this particular action and
ending up in this state.

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:46.680
Why is that good or bad?

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.170
And the way you're going to do it is,
I'm going to say,

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.440
well I know how good it is to be here by
behaving randomly from that point on.

00:00:52.622 --> 00:00:58.020
I mean, that'll give you probably an
underestimate of the true value, but it

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.840
would be nice if you could do something
that perhaps made a little more sense.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.290
So people who have done work on MCTS
have often put some effort into,

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:07.320
well lots of things.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.520
Being clever about this expansion,
keeping the right set of statistics,

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.390
kind of shoving their
expiration in very smart ways.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.090
But other people have spent a little
bit of effort trying to figure out

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.630
can I come up with a better
policy besides behaving randomly?

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.470
That will help me to have a better
estimate of this particular q value.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.520
And we can talk about I'm going to just
quickly talk about one by mentioning

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.280
something that we have already
talked about so far in this lesson.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.870
Do you remember the command
you came up with Pac-Man?

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.290
&gt;&gt; It was like eat, eat, eat, avoid.

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.580
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; So like eat little dots,

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.550
eat big dots, eat ghosts, avoid.

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.770
&gt;&gt; Right, so I'm going to
point out that of those four.

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:51.660
Which I'll just call eat,
eat, eat, and avoid.

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:52.700
Which one of those is different?

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:53.830
&gt;&gt; So, I don't know.

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:54.670
The first one.

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.390
&gt;&gt; Eat?
&gt;&gt; Where you're eating big dots.

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.180
Yeah, or small dots.

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.960
Now I guess you want to say, avoid.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.130
Because it's the word that's
different in the list.

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.460
&gt;&gt; Avoid is different, but it's
actually different in a different way.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.960
Here we said, eat a little dot, eat a
big dot, eat a ghost, and avoid ghosts.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.430
Remember when I said before that

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.880
temporal extraction
becomes goal extraction?

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.370
I'm going to claim that each
of these does have a goal.

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.140
One is to eat little dots.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.920
One is the big dots.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.270
And one is the little goblins.

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.230
But that when you execute the eat
small dot, it actually terminates.

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.610
At some point you eat a small dot.

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.220
And now you can move
on to the next thing.

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.920
At some point you eat large dot and
now you can move on to the next thing.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.320
At some point you eat a goblin and
then you can move on to the next thing.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.530
But avoiding goblins, avoiding ghosts,
that isn't really something that ends.

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.492
You're supposed to be
avoiding ghosts all the time.

00:02:43.492 --> 00:02:46.060
&gt;&gt; I see.
Well, I guess it's sort of the negation.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.090
I do understand how
that's different now.

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.710
So hitting the ghost
ends when you succeed.

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:53.258
Avoiding I want to say
ends when you fail.

00:02:53.258 --> 00:02:53.933
[LAUGH] Right.

00:02:53.933 --> 00:02:55.314
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; Like I'm avoiding the ghost

00:02:55.314 --> 00:02:56.170
then said ooh.

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:57.770
I wasn't able to avoid the goals.

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.690
Right, so in fact these things have sort
of goals, they have success conditions.

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.500
They end when you succeed.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.060
Avoid is a little different.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.160
It sort of ends only when you fail.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.320
You can never succeeded avoiding goals
you can only fail at it in some sense.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.580
Whereas here there a sort of finite
time in which you achieve your goal and

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:16.680
that success.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.260
So it turns out that when you ask
people to come up with these kinds of

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.280
options, they actually come up
with things that look like this.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.250
Lots of goals with lots
of success metrics.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.790
But they also come up with things
where you can sort of only fail.

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.760
We actually have a word for that and
they're called constraints.
