00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.029
&gt;&gt; This whole recombination thing

00:00:02.029 --> 00:00:04.370
seems pretty complicated but really important.

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:07.730
&gt;&gt; It really is important in conjunction with the law of segregation and

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:10.070
independent assortment, it's what makes sex

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:12.990
so worth while genetically speaking. Now, it

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.310
allows us to mix and match different genetic alleles for the next generation.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.690
But, can you think of a scenario

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:22.070
that undermines this kind of genetic variability?

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.720
&gt;&gt; Well, what if you started with a reduced genetic pool

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:26.630
in the beginning?

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.850
&gt;&gt; Well, that's true. And where might we

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.369
find a population of people with less genetic variability?

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.300
&gt;&gt; Inbreeding?

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.170
&gt;&gt; Yep, inbreeding. This genetic shuffling can be undermined if a pedigree

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.815
keeps sex within the family. Now genetically speaking, aside from all the

00:00:43.815 --> 00:00:46.675
social issues surrounding it, I want you to tell me, in light

00:00:46.675 --> 00:00:50.940
of recombination, what do you think the biggest problem is with inbreeding?

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.450
Don't worry about getting your answer right or wrong here. I just

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.170
want you to give me your best answer in regards to recombination.
