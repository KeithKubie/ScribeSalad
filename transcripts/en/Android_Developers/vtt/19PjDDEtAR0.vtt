00:00:02.177 --> 00:00:04.260
TRISHA PRABHU: Part of
being in the tech community

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:05.940
means that things
are unpredictable,

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.890
and big ideas happen
fast, and you just

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.420
have to go, go, go, go, go.

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.394
ED COOKE: Creativity
is at its best when

00:00:11.394 --> 00:00:13.560
people with different ideas
and different expertises

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:14.340
come together.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.590
SEBASTIAN STRICKER: When we
started with ShareTheMeal,

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.410
we had surprisingly
little knowledge

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.891
about pretty much everything.

00:00:20.891 --> 00:00:22.890
The reason why we stand
where we stand right now

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.348
is because we found
people that are

00:00:24.348 --> 00:00:26.430
willing to collaborate with us.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.460
RITESH AGARWAL: Collaboration
was not necessary,

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:29.220
it essential.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.729
All your partners are the most
important part of the puzzle.

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:34.380
We have been able
to work together

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.180
with those hotel
partners, and they have

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.885
responded in a massive way.

00:00:37.885 --> 00:00:39.510
GONZALO RODRIGUEZ:
Since I was a child,

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.280
I always wanted to
create something

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.830
that creates an impact
on thousands of people.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.260
I found that, with
technology and collaboration,

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.277
we could do it.

00:00:47.277 --> 00:00:49.110
TRISHA PRABHU: We are
this new internet age.

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.693
And what's so exciting
is we get to be

00:00:50.693 --> 00:00:52.020
the first to make a difference.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.270
And we get to
harness that power.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.280
Behind every
successful person is

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.639
a group of people
making it happen,

00:00:58.639 --> 00:01:00.930
helping to organize, and put
things together, and think

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:01.870
about things.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.400
ED COOKE: At Memrise, we've got
coders, film makers, linguists,

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.759
product designers, and a
crazy Italian bus driver.

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:09.300
We've got a whole
community of people

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.640
around Europe participating
in the creation

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.900
of this video dictionary of
all of Europe's languages.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.359
[NON-ENGLISH]

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:18.150
SEBASTIAN STRICKER: We
found out that there

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.460
are 20 times as many people
that have smartphones

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.510
than hungry children.

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.940
And ShareTheMeal wanted
to make it as easy

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.580
as possible for people to
do good, whenever they want,

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.417
wherever they are.

00:01:28.417 --> 00:01:30.000
RITESH AGARWAL:
India, on one side had

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.440
three million rooms available.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.130
On the other side, there
was half a billion people

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.100
who wanted to stay.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.230
I realized that there
was a huge amount

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.965
of problem in being able to
connect both of these people.

00:01:38.965 --> 00:01:40.700
Our aspiration was
saying, we will

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.530
solve it, which is why, for
three months, almost every day,

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.780
I would stay in a new motel,
a guest house, a service

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:46.280
department.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.363
GONZALO RODRIGUEZ: And
with the use of technology,

00:01:48.363 --> 00:01:49.980
we can create great
games that will

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.470
help kids be smarter every day.

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.660
Today, we feel that
there are no barriers.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.249
We can have anyone from all
over the world working with us.

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:59.290
And that is a nice thing.

00:02:01.944 --> 00:02:03.360
TRISHA PRABHU: I
am the generation

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.370
that was the first to
grow up with technology.

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.230
And so I wanted
to use technology

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.330
to solve a problem that I think
technology itself has created.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.670
ReThink is able to detect when
the combination of keystrokes

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.040
creates offensive
content or hurtful words.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.820
We provide a second chance
to reconsider their decision.

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.790
ED COOKE: Technology
allows people anywhere

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.370
to come into contact
with anything.

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.390
It makes connections.

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.980
It extends people's powers.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.287
It makes things which weren't
accessible, accessible.

00:02:31.287 --> 00:02:33.495
RITESH AGARWAL: Feels great
that we have the smartest

00:02:33.495 --> 00:02:36.055
brains in the country
coming together and solving

00:02:36.055 --> 00:02:38.430
a problem more passionately
than the founder who actually

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.120
started it.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.610
And we'll do anything
to make it successful.

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.120
There's one thing about Play
Store that I can tell you.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.079
They make sure that you
learn almost every week

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:47.828
or every month, because
they're themselves

00:02:47.828 --> 00:02:49.080
making their systems better.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.854
And we're all learning together.

00:02:50.854 --> 00:02:52.270
SEBASTIAN STRICKER:
We didn't know

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.952
whether this would turn out
to be an innovation that

00:02:54.952 --> 00:02:56.220
is impactful.

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.650
And as of today, we stand
roughly 7.3 million daily food

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:02.700
rations, so far.

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.560
TRISHA PRABHU: Coding
opens doors to make it

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.514
more than just an app.

00:03:05.514 --> 00:03:06.930
People everywhere
are standing up,

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.880
uniting behind a
piece of technology

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.250
that they think has the
potential to change the world.

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.875
That's amazing.

00:03:11.875 --> 00:03:13.624
RITESH AGARWAL: The
next five or ten years

00:03:13.624 --> 00:03:15.340
are possibly the
most exciting times,

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.006
which means, if we
can bring all of them

00:03:17.006 --> 00:03:19.950
together, collaborate, and bring
something to users which really

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.160
solves a problem, I'm pretty
sure that a lot of these things

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.630
will form the basis to building
better nations in times

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.630
to come.

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.380
