model works but in the open-source world

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:44.989
model works but in the open-source world
 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:46.479
model works but in the open-source world
that's kind of a different thing there's

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489
that's kind of a different thing there's
 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:47.950
that's kind of a different thing there's
some companies that open source software

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960
some companies that open source software
 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.959
some companies that open source software
and then sell support on top of it so

00:00:49.959 --> 00:00:49.969

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:50.920
and then sell support on top of it so
that's one way to make money off

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930
that's one way to make money off
 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.100
that's one way to make money off
open-source for us we think that the

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110
open-source for us we think that the
 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:55.990
open-source for us we think that the
open source thing works for us because

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000
open source thing works for us because
 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.670
open source thing works for us because
first of all the products better and we

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680
first of all the products better and we
 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.279
first of all the products better and we
get to use rails and so if other people

00:01:00.279 --> 00:01:00.289
get to use rails and so if other people
 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:01.690
get to use rails and so if other people
are improving it that's good for us we

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:01.700
are improving it that's good for us we
 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:02.889
are improving it that's good for us we
can use that in our pay products

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899
can use that in our pay products
 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:04.900
can use that in our pay products
secondly whenever people mention rails

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:04.910
secondly whenever people mention rails
 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:06.850
secondly whenever people mention rails
they mention 37signals or they mentioned

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860
they mention 37signals or they mentioned
 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.670

Basecamp or high-rise or us in some way

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680
Basecamp or high-rise or us in some way
 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.920
Basecamp or high-rise or us in some way
and that indirectly benefits us as well

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930
and that indirectly benefits us as well
 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.260
and that indirectly benefits us as well
so that's kind of the guiding principle

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270
so that's kind of the guiding principle
 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.310
so that's kind of the guiding principle
for us so some stuffs free most us pay

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320
 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.840
well ads do make sense in some cases but

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850
well ads do make sense in some cases but
 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.310
well ads do make sense in some cases but

tremendous amount of traffic and that's

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280
tremendous amount of traffic and that's
 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.729
tremendous amount of traffic and that's
really really really hard there's also a

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739
really really really hard there's also a
 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:21.560

ad supported model the people who pay
for your product are enough people use

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070
for your product are enough people use
 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:36.830
for your product are enough people use

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840
it people pay for the advertisers and
 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.479
it people pay for the advertisers and
the people who use it are the users and

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489
the people who use it are the users and
 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:39.949
the people who use it are the users and
there's a disconnect so who are you who

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959
there's a disconnect so who are you who
 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.449
there's a disconnect so who are you who
are you building it for who do you

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459
are you building it for who do you
 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.820
are you building it for who do you
really have to make happy you know in

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830
really have to make happy you know in
 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:44.870
really have to make happy you know in
many cases it ends up being the

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880
many cases it ends up being the
 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.250
many cases it ends up being the
advertisers which is why you see a lot

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260
advertisers which is why you see a lot
 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.720
advertisers which is why you see a lot
of new sites especially they're just ads

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730
of new sites especially they're just ads
 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.850
of new sites especially they're just ads
everywhere and that's a pretty crappy

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860
everywhere and that's a pretty crappy
 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.789
everywhere and that's a pretty crappy
experience I think so I'm not a big fan

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799
experience I think so I'm not a big fan
 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:54.080
experience I think so I'm not a big fan
of that model I think it you know some

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090
of that model I think it you know some
 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.910
of that model I think it you know some
people can make it work but I'm not a

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920
people can make it work but I'm not a
 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.170
people can make it work but I'm not a
big fan of it and I think the default

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180
big fan of it and I think the default
 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.699
big fan of it and I think the default
idea that we'll just put ads on it

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709
idea that we'll just put ads on it
 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.110
idea that we'll just put ads on it
that's what we'll support we'll put ads

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120
that's what we'll support we'll put ads
 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.600
that's what we'll support we'll put ads
on it is a terrible idea and it's much

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610
on it is a terrible idea and it's much
 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.190
