00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.510
&gt;&gt; From The Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:23.060
[ Pause ]

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:24.360
&gt;&gt; Eugene Flanagan: Hello.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.390
I'm Eugene Flanagan,
Director of National Programs

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.090
at The Library of Congress.

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.470
And it's my pleasure to
welcome you here this afternoon

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.520
to Spotlight on Native Writers.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.930
The event is sponsored
by The Library's Poetry

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.080
and Literature Center, home to
among other programs The Library

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.910
of Congress Prize for
American Fiction presented

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.610
in 2010 to Louise Erdrich.

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.980
Last fall Erdrich participated
in a terrific session

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.670
of the National Book
Festival, and we are excited

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.960
to have today's event occurring in
conjunction with Erdrich's return

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.890
to the Capitol for the debut of
her new novel, and you'll hear more

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.350
about that later from Rob
Caspar, the Head of the Center.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.130
Spotlight on Native
Writers gives The Library

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.570
of Congress an opportunity
to feature a few

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.900
of the many essential Native
literary voices active today.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.800
And Erdrich has prefaced today's
event with the observation that,

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.570
and I quote, bringing our
contemporary Native stories to life

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.550
in one of our country's
greatest institutions is a worthy

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.100
and delightful enterprise.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.630 position:56%
Helping us today in that enterprise,
that delightful enterprise, right,

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.810
are our four guests,
three on the stage now.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.210
Eric Gansworth is an artist and
author of 10 novels and a play.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.860
In the fall Eric will be
NEH Visiting Professor

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.940
of Native American Studies
at Colgate University.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.340
His next novel is Give
Me Some Truth.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.200
Linda LeGarde Grover is a
writer and poet and the winner

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.300
of the Flannery O'Connor Award.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.870
Linda is a Professor of American
Indian Studies at the University

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:02.610
of Minnesota, Duluth, and her next
poetry collection is titled The

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.720
Sky Watched.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.180
Stephen Graham Jones is
the author of 16 novels

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.980
and six short story collections.

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:14.470
Stephen teaches in the FMA programs
of the University of Colorado

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.020
at Boulder and the University of
California, Riverside-Palm Desert,

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.490
and his current novel is Mongrels.

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.950
Following readings by Eric,

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.490
Linda and Stephen we will have a
moderated discussion led by poet

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.210
and scholar, Deborah Miranda.

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.620
Deborah is the John Lucian Smith
[Assumed Spelling] Junior Professor

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.640
of English at Washington and
Lee University and author

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.510
of three books of poetry.

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.840
Her next book is collection
of essays, The Hidden Stories

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.860
of Isabelle Meadows and Other
California Indian Lucini

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.160
[Assumed Spelling].

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.490 position:56%
But before we start, some logistics.

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:52.350
Please turn off your cell phones
and all electronic devices.

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.400
If you have questions
during the q-and-a portion

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.880
of the program please wait for
us to give you a portable mike.

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.440
Also, please note that
by participating

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.920
in the q-and-a session you give The
Library permission to include you

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.150
in future audio and webcasts.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.450
When the program concludes there
will be a book signing by all

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.060
of our authors at the back
of the room, with Josh there.

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.850
And to find out more about the
Poetry and Literature Center

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:22.050 position:56%
in general or this program please
visit our website at loc.gov/poetry.

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.360
But now please join me in
welcoming Eric Gansworth,

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.510
Linda LeGarde Grover, Stephen
Graham Jones, and Deborah Miranda.

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:36.510
[ Applause ]

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:43.940
[ Pause ]

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.240
&gt;&gt; Eric Gansworth: Good afternoon.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.540
Thank you for coming.

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.130
Thank you to The Library
of Congress for inviting me

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.720
to participate in this event.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.630
It's really delightful to
be here on the same occasion

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.710 position:56%
as Louse's new novel being launched,

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.950
which I'm sure many people are very
excited about, as much as I am.

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.670
I'm going to read an excerpt

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.920
from a forthcoming
novel, Give Me Some Truth.

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.330
It is a follow-up to my last
novel, If I Ever Get Out of Here.

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.900
I'm working on a four-novel
sequence of Beatle's books.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.440
I'm not really sure what's going
to happen when we get to Ringo,

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:21.230
but so this is the first chapter
from this narrative point of view,

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:24.440
this is the John and Yoko book
so they get equal billing.

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.040
And so this is from a 15-year-old
girl who is a bead worker.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.880
Are you from an Indian reservation
near here, the new groom asked,

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.390
while his bride eyed up a pair

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:39.530
of beadwork dangle
earrings from our display.

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.000
Technically, my sister Marie said.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.610
Immediately new groom's
ears perked up.

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.900
He clearly didn't want to
be buying fake Indian goods.

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.920
Either you are or you aren't
Indian, isn't that right, he asked.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.920
Our mom was walking back
from the lady's room,

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.450
a half million miles
from our vendor's table.

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:00.910
Marie never engaged in her mild
sabotage when our mom was around.

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:02.340
It was Memorial Day weekend,

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.720
the beginning of our season
selling handmade Indian souvenirs

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.720
at Niagara Falls State Park.

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.760
We personally enforced
our tribal treaties

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.870
with the likes of New York State.

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:14.170
It gives you a sense of power

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:18.770
in your otherwise woefully
powerless 15-year-old girl life.

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:22.350
Oh, yeah, we are definitely
Indian, Marie said,

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:25.050
don't my beautiful
red skin prove it?

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.020
New groom was edgy, but new bride
had already locked her tractor beam

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.840
eyes on the earrings.

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.140
We just don't live

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:35.380
on the reservation
anymore, but I wish we did.

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:36.680
Most of our family does,

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.240
and I'm tired of living
in the city, Marie said.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.740
Suddenly switching
to her forlorn tone.

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:45.970
Our mom greeted our
potential customers

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:50.820
with the humble Indian craftsperson
face she had mastered years ago.

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:54.730
We longed to be among our people,
I said, going along with Marie.

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:57.750
Trying out new routines
could be fun.

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:01.220
So why aren't you among your
people, new groom asked.

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.620
A lot of tourists ask
this pushy question,

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.900
testing to see if we
were real Indians.

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.280
Our vendor permit was pinned

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.250
to the appropriately ingenie
[Assumed Spelling] Pendleton

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:11.780
covering our table.

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:15.160
The Parks Department required
it be visible at all times,

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.600
the permit, not the Pendleton.

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:24.140
Sad fact, I said, adopting my own
version of forlorn Indian, Indians,

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:26.270
they don't buy much beadwork.

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:30.220
A little lie, they tended to buy
only a certain kind of beadwork.

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:34.060
Keychains, trucker caps or baseball
caps, disposable lighter cases,

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:37.110
bingo bags and eyeglass cases.

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:43.750
So here we are building bridges to
the larger culture with our art.

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:49.250
I modeled my look on the
crying antipollution TV Indian.

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:53.590
This broach is designed by my
elders to go with the earrings.

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:56.540
I slid a little basswood
carving forward.

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:58.850
My dad made it last week.

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:01.750
The expression on new bride's
face said she couldn't see herself

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:03.050
in this combo.

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:06.540
She didn't love Indians that much.

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:10.590
This is our specialty, I added,
revealing one of our canoes,

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:13.590
which I did whenever
I saw that expression.

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:16.700
In my best mystical Indian
voice, all clipped confidence

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:19.670
and draggy vowels,
the works, I said,

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:24.400
each Indian family has
their own signature,

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:30.860
ours is the double heart canoe,
very popular among honeymooners.

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:35.440
This was a phrase I usually closed
the deal with, chopping out my y's

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:39.940
and pronouncing popular
like a variety of tree.

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:42.210
You can spot honeymooner
hands immediately.

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:45.210
New bride usually fans her
fingers like piano players,

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:47.670
hoping you'll ask about
her engagement ring

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:50.780
so she can tell you all
the carats and setting.

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:54.260
New groom is usually spinning
his new ring with his thumb,

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:57.780
the way you might absently
work a burst blister.

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:00.740
They wanted something
we could provide.

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:03.800
Maintaining our tables we kept
the porter agreement alive.

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:06.770
You can bet official parks
vendors had tried for years

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:09.040
to justify breaking that treaty.

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:12.850
What I had said, though, a
sales pitch was still true,

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:15.730
the double heart canoe
was our signature item.

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:19.340
You do best with something that's
like traditional Indian beadwork,

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:22.710
but that also commemorates
something for the tourists.

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:24.010
I helped design this.

00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:28.660
My family developed the beadwork
equivalent of the concert T-shirt,

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:31.030
with tour dates and
cities on the back.

00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:34.730
You see, Niagara Falls is official
honeymoon capitol of the world.

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:38.160
I'm not sure why a giant waterfall
above a bunch of sharp rocks made

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:43.420
that cut, maybe because when people
get married they say they're taking

00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:45.800
the plunge.

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:48.290
Together we came up
with this killer idea

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:51.160
for the schatzki inclined
newlywed tourists.

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:53.080 position:56%
My dad made little birch bark canoes

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:57.720
that my mom stuffed two plump
velvet heart pincushions inside of.

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:02.400 position:56%
We beaded the hearts with a date and
initials while the customer watched.

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:05.480
I've carved so many initials and
hash marks into little hearts

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:10.600
that I could maybe qualify as a
graffiti minded cardiac surgeon.

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:14.340
Despite our signature,
our mom left our dad,

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:16.570
his rental shack when I was eight.

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:19.130
Our apartment was in
something called the projects,

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:22.540
which made it seem like we lived
in a classroom science experiment.

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:24.320
Add an Indian woman
and her kids to a set

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:27.480
of low rent apartment buildings
jammed with too many people,

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:30.460
all colors except white,
what happens?

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:32.750
Do they bind and make
a new substance?

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:36.950
If so, is it like epoxy or acid?

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:39.610
Even after we moved out my
parents shared the treaty

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:43.150
and short vendor permit, and
my mom still sold my dad's work

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:45.970
since you needed a res address
to apply for the permit.

00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:50.110 position:56%
At first they refused to collaborate
on the double heart canoes.

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:53.130
They each insisted they were
stuck with the hard part and,

00:09:53.130 --> 00:09:55.290
thus, should get a bigger cut.

00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:58.300
None of us kids dared suggest
we had the hardest part.

00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:00.080
Though it was true,
we had to chit-chat

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:03.990 position:56%
with the newly in-love couples while
we maimed velvet hearts for them.

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:06.570
The city wasn't a bad
place to finish out school,

00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:10.410 position:56%
and we did the same vendor table
gig we'd always done in the summers.

00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:12.730
It was like being near
a satellite reservation,

00:10:12.730 --> 00:10:14.540
at least in the summertime.

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:17.580
The reservation heavy tavern
softball league teams played

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:20.190
in the park near the projects.

00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:23.050
There were worse ways to spend your
summer evenings than watching men

00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:25.380
in tight uniforms running
around, every now

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:30.710
and then rearranging their favorite
equipment inside those tight pants.

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:34.420
Oh, hon, the new bride
said, isn't this the cutest?

00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:37.850
While new groom glanced at
the canoe, suddenly searching

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:41.430
for a hangtag to see what
it was going to cost.

00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:43.880
We could smudge it with
some tobacco, Marie said,

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:45.610
reaching under the
table for her purse

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:48.510
where I knew she had
a pack of Kool's.

00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:52.470
Get you off on the right foot
for a lifetime of happiness.

00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:55.240
Is that extra, new groom asked?

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:58.000
He had not yet learned his lines.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.850
My daughter jokes, our mom said,
kicking Marie under the table,

00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:06.550
just like on a sitcom except there
was no joke there, no stunt kicks.

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:10.060
We do, though, offer to bead
your initials and the date,

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:13.980
usually $10 extra, but this
beautiful Memorial Day,

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:18.220
she said opening her arms wide
to provide her generosity,

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:21.080
we give you that part for free.

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:22.920
Oh, hon, new bride said.

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:25.720
And new groom got out his wallet.

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:28.630
My blushing bride here, he
said, grabbing her shoulders

00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:32.770 position:56%
and squeezing her close to him,
she's a DAR, so her mother wanted us

00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:36.260
to get married on the 4th of July.

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.850
DAR, our mom said, burning
through her gas tank of charm,

00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:44.110
your name is Darlene, Darla?

00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:46.680
D-A-R, new bride said giggling,

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:49.400
Daughters of the American
Revolution.

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:51.680
It was important to my
mother, she hastened to add,

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:54.210
my parents wanted us to get
married on the 4th of July,

00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:57.110
invite all their other DAR friends.

00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:58.840
We're from Concord.

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:01.800
Apparently that was supposed
to mean something to us.

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:03.800
But we're not really like that.

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:08.100 position:56%
Then she leaned in conspiratorially,
we eloped to avoid a big production.

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:10.560
So nice to have a memento.

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:14.170 position:56%
If they want to throw us a reception
on Independence Day, great,

00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:18.330
but we get to be married
where and when we want.

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:20.050
We've got beaded picture
frames, too,

00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:23.670
I said to new groom,
upping the ante.

00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:26.800
Make great thank you gifts
for your new in-laws.

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:30.320
Got some here with two
beaded birds, like lovebirds.

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:34.290
I hated using poor grammar, but it
tended to make the sale smoother.

00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:37.970
I revealed an elaborate
velvet beadwork picture frame.

00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:42.650
The bride ran her fingers over the
rich velvet, leaving little trails.

00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:45.360
I could even bead a couple
little bees on it, I said,

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:50.290
joining her giggle, since this is
your honeymoon, birds and bees.

00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:51.800
New groom grinned.

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:54.650
Not sure your mother would
care for that, he laughed.

00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:59.310
My mom was about to blow a gasket
thinking I'd lost the sale.

00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:02.480
Might be kind of a fun
secret joke, he added,

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:04.810
how long before it could be ready?

00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:08.860
Fifteen minutes, I said, I could
do this beading in my sleep.

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:12.370
Half hour, our mom interrupted,
handing the double heart canoe

00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:15.090
to Marie and digging
out her receipt book.

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:18.120
My daughters work quick, but
it's very trick work, she said,

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:20.940
doing a double drop y, as I had.

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:23.200
I made big eyes at Marie.

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:27.030
My mom asked for 50% down since
we couldn't sell it to anyone else

00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:28.790
with their initials on it.

00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:32.650 position:56%
The groom, still chuckling about
the secret sexy joke he'd be playing

00:13:32.650 --> 00:13:36.220
on his mother-in-law,
said he'd pay in full.

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:37.670
When our mom got their initials

00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:40.780
for the custom beading
she showed him the receipt

00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:42.940
with $100 in the total line.

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:46.960
His eyes bugged, but I was
already breaking out my yellow

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:50.130
and black beads to do
a couple quick bumbles.

00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:54.360
He paid and they watched their art
being created right before their

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:56.530
eyes, commemorating their day.

00:13:56.530 --> 00:13:58.510
Thank you.

00:13:58.510 --> 00:14:09.800
[ Applause ]

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:14.680
&gt;&gt; Linda LeGarde Grover: Ojou
[Assumed Spelling], everybody.

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:16.040
Linda Grover [inaudible].

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:23.260
And I'm going to read the
introductory part to my book,

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.960
The Road Back to Sweetgrass,
and then a part

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:29.320
of a chapter depending
on how the time looks.

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:31.660
So we start out this way,

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:35.620
the introduction is
called The Odissimaa Bag.

00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:43.440 position:56%
Today, the opening day of the Mozhay
Point Ojibwe Reservations wild rice

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:47.590
harvest, cumulous clouds drift
slowly over the boat landing

00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:52.550
on Lost Lake, bringing with
them the scent of sweetgrass.

00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:55.850
Among the ricers, who pause
to inhale the blessing,

00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:59.680
are a teenage boy and his father,
who park at the side of the road

00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:05.100
in a gray primered Ford truck faded
to the near no-color of glass.

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:06.840
A young married couple, who argue

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:10.090
as they carry her parents'
canoe toward the water,

00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:13.940
and an elderly woman, who has just
placed a pot of coffee to boil

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:18.250 position:56%
on an old car grill over a campfire.

00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:21.720
On this western edge of Mozhay
it happens that way occasionally,

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:24.090
when the wind comes
from the northeast,

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:26.630
the scent of sweetgrass
edging and swirling

00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:29.090
from the LeForest [Assumed
Spelling] family allotment land,

00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:31.950
its source somewhere near
the maple sugar bush,

00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:35.490
making its invisible way past
the cabin and down the driveway

00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:38.210
to the road where it
dissipates and fades

00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:41.020
when it reaches the boat landing.

00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:44.780
The Mozhay Point ricers, who
know that no sweetgrass grows

00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:48.990
on the LeForest land even
in the swamp on the far side

00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:53.710
of the allotment, occasionally stop
in their work to wonder about this.

00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:57.140
But the scent reminds us that
we've been blessed by the Creator

00:15:57.140 --> 00:16:01.080
in all ways, understood or
otherwise, here during our time

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:06.290
on Mother Earth, and so we accept
the mystery for what it is.

00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:10.440
And yet in the old muskrat family
sugar bush, there near the middle

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:14.950 position:56%
of the land that more than a century
ago became the LeForest family land

00:16:14.950 --> 00:16:20.350
allotment is where spirits tread so
lightly that their feet transparent

00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:25.050
as the air make no more mark
on the ground than air, itself.

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:29.940
With every step the scent invisibly
compressed and released renews

00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:34.860
and rises into LeForest
allotment atmosphere.

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:39.240
And the earth that is covered by
leaves in fall, snow in winter,

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:43.230
mud in spring, and sparse
northern moss in summer.

00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:46.670
A small deerskin bag
sewn with red thread

00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:50.850
and blue beads holds an
infant's umbilical cord

00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:54.460
and Odissimaa wrapped
in dried sweetgrass.

00:16:54.460 --> 00:17:04.510
This chapter is called
In Her Dream Margie.

00:17:04.510 --> 00:17:09.060
The young Margie Robineau,
moving through the landscape

00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:10.870
of her early-morning dreams,

00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:16.150
knew as well as a much older woman
all the songs and where they ended.

00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:19.540
She had danced this
one a hundred times.

00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:23.170
As it neared the tail, the last
minute of the fugue of drumbeat

00:17:23.170 --> 00:17:27.740 position:56%
and voices, she danced nearer to the
men at the drum, who in anticipation

00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:32.320 position:56%
of the quickening of the pace leaned
forward on their folding chairs.

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:35.790
The lead singer bent to pick a
Styrofoam cup up from the floor

00:17:35.790 --> 00:17:40.070
with his left hand, his right hand
holding the drumstick in midair

00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:44.200
as he swallowed a mouthful of
water between skipped beats.

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:47.910
He cupped his left hand to hear,
his ear, as he raised his voice.

00:17:47.910 --> 00:17:51.330
The pitch, a wolf singing into
the wind, striking the drum harder

00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:54.950
with every other beat, volume
muffled by the sheepskin wrapping

00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:59.540
on the end of the drumstick to
a deep boom, felt by the girl

00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:02.420
who was Margie, Margie Endus
[Assumed Spelling] at the back

00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:06.630
of the curved arabesque
of her ribs as she danced.

00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:08.780
She watched Jowosh's
[Assumed Spelling] head bob,

00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:12.660
now his white hair reflecting
the fluorescent lighting

00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:15.830
of the gymnasium ceiling
to the silver of Lost Lake

00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:17.500
under a full moon in winter.

00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:21.630
Now as the fugue bent,
dipped, turned the corner

00:18:21.630 --> 00:18:25.480
into the tail of the song, now.

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:28.010
The girl's gaze turned from
the singers to the blur

00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:30.600
of the powwow circle then inward.

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:33.960
Her feet stayed with the drum, out
of her sight but seen in her mind

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:39.400 position:56%
as she danced, moccasins beaded with
blue skies and rivers, green leaves

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:43.710
and vines, flowers the color of
late summer, prancing and stepping,

00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:47.350
kicking and turning, sending her
prayers to the Creator by way

00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:52.310
of skies and rivers, leaves,
vines and flowers of late summer.

00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:56.040
When the song ended her
practiced feet hit the ground

00:18:56.040 --> 00:19:00.770 position:56%
on the last beat, side by side,
together, toes first, heels grounded

00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:02.980
on the last split second.

00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:06.710
Hewa [Assumed Spelling],
Jowosh didn't say it out loud.

00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:13.030
She woke to the hesitant gurgle of
the toilet flushing weak and thin

00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:17.070
on the other side of her bedroom
wall as the middle-aged Margie,

00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:20.510
who duct-taped her large supports
into her dance boots as she dressed

00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:25.090
for grand entry and who needed
more than six hours of sleep.

00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:28.510
Half opening her eyes to the
osmotic fogginess of the beginnings

00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:31.910
of illumination, that gray
light that seeps into rooms

00:19:31.910 --> 00:19:34.940
where morning sleepers
endeavor to extend the night.

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:38.540
She blinked at probing fingers
of reality, forcing daylight

00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:41.320
through slats of drawn
vinyl window blinds,

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:44.960
prying apart the crack
between drawn curtains.

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:48.300 position:56%
Did I dance like that, she wondered?

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:49.940
Am I young?

00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:52.480
No, she remembered, I
have a daughter older

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:55.750
than I was in the dream.

00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:57.470
Crystal jiggled the flush handle

00:19:57.470 --> 00:20:01.770
to stop the irritatingly apologetic
sound of the running toilet.

00:20:01.770 --> 00:20:04.490
She coughed, deep and dry.

00:20:04.490 --> 00:20:07.460
Wrestled cellophane,
her pack of Camels.

00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:11.440
Lit a match, sucked smoke, exhaled.

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:15.150
Passing the bedroom door she looked
in to see if her mother was awake.

00:20:15.150 --> 00:20:18.480
Her left hand was cupped over her
mouth, cigarette between her second

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:22.960
and third fingers,
filter close to her lips.

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:26.970 position:56%
Margie saw an old man's
silhouette, short-legged and skinny,

00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:29.960
with those stringy muscular
arms standing in the doorway

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:34.310
to the bedroom, gray and
indistinct, an aberration.

00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:38.870
Jowosh? Margie rubbed the back
of her wrist against her eyes.

00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:41.650
The aberration stretched,
crossed its wrists

00:20:41.650 --> 00:20:44.680
above its head and
became her daughter.

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:47.670
Oh, I'm in Aunt Beryl's [Assumed
Spelling] trailer, she remembered,

00:20:47.670 --> 00:20:49.510
not in the allotment house.

00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:50.810
I live here.

00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:55.120
Joe lives at the hospital
in convalescent care.

00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:57.070
You up, Crystal asked.

00:20:57.070 --> 00:20:59.310
How late did you work?

00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:03.250
Almost two, busy at Chiwadek
[Assumed Spelling] last night.

00:21:03.250 --> 00:21:04.710
Where were you?

00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:07.120
Out. With who?

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:10.960
Just out. She glared at her
mother, none of your business.

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:13.440
Did you find out about
blackjack training?

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:15.890
Coughed, dropped her cigarette.

00:21:15.890 --> 00:21:17.190
Watch the rug.

00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:19.810
No, they haven't decided yet if
they're going to have the class.

00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:22.120
Where's auntie Beryl?

00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:23.760
Down at the boat landing.

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:26.900
Hey, I'm going to go down there,
see if I can find a ricing partner.

00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:29.320
Can I borrow the rowboat,
use Michael's stuff,

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:30.950
his duckbill and knockers?

00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:32.250
I know he's not there.

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:34.100
I'm broke.

00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:36.720
You look like hell, who
would want to rice with you?

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:38.020
Are you hung-over?

00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:40.140
Well, what do you think?

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:43.280
Crystal gulped, swallowing
back the dry heaves.

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:45.350
Go ahead, it's Michael's
stuff, not mine,

00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:48.540
take whatever you want,
he's not around.

00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:51.800
The young woman went back into
Beryl's squirrely bathroom.

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:54.980
She ran water noisily into
the sink while she wretched.

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:57.890
Took deep breaths to
settle her stomach.

00:21:57.890 --> 00:22:00.120
Ah, Pepto-Bismol, she thought.

00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:02.530
There was a bottle in
the medicine cabinet.

00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:04.640
She took two chalky
peppermint swallows

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:06.430
from the bottle and wretched again.

00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:08.900
Knelt on the floor to see if
she had heaved pink liquid

00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:12.980
on the matching pink shag bathmat.

00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:14.920
She held a wet washcloth
over her face,

00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:18.760 position:56%
counted to 10, and cautiously stood.

00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:22.320
Lifting the washcloth she
saw herself, slack faced,

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:25.360
staring out at the mirror with
eyes that looked like two pee holes

00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:28.610
in the snow, as Margie would say.

00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:33.720
Above the reflection showed her two
impossibly pretty Indians embraced,

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:38.000
a vaguely effeminate brave and a
Nordic featured princess simpering

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.030
in front of a pink and gold sunset.

00:22:41.030 --> 00:22:44.700 position:56%
Auntie Beryl had won the laminated
plaque at Saturday Night Fever bingo

00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:47.720
and hung it in the bathroom
where it could be seen twice,

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:49.700
on the wall and in the mirror.

00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:51.400
Ick, she muttered.

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:56.190
She sipped water from the
plastic cup shaped like a rosebud.

00:22:56.190 --> 00:22:59.510
Crystal, her mother said when
she came out of the bathroom,

00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:03.160
I've been thinking about us moving
back into the allotment house.

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:05.940
Michael is just about never there
and even when he is he sleeps

00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:08.750 position:56%
in the shed most of the time anyway.

00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:11.160
It doesn't even have a furnace.

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:14.470
Ah, but even in winter it's
plenty warm with the woodstove

00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:16.380
and then we'd have our own place.

00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:19.430
We did fine there before we
moved in with Auntie Beryl.

00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:24.210
We could take care of it, you and
me, it just needs a little work.

00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:27.610
And take a chance into
running into Michael,

00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:30.630
that bum who couldn't be
bothered by his own daughter?

00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:33.500
It's a wreck, it has
raccoons under the stairs.

00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:35.480
God, no thanks.

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:37.420
Let Michael deal with that place.

00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:38.720
Beryl needs you here.

00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:43.210
Now that the weather is still nice,
we could try it again, Crystal,

00:23:43.210 --> 00:23:45.500
do a little work, get
it ready for the winter.

00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:47.910
Jowosh would like that.

00:23:47.910 --> 00:23:50.840
God, I'm going to the landing.

00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:53.730 position:56%
Crystal picked up her cigarettes
and lighter from the kitchen counter

00:23:53.730 --> 00:23:56.310
and walked out, letting
the door slam.

00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:58.630
At the bottom of the steps
she spun around and went back

00:23:58.630 --> 00:24:01.560
into the kitchen to take her
plaid flannel shirt from the hook

00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:04.000
by the door and a piece
of left-over fry bread

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.810
from the bowl on the table.

00:24:06.810 --> 00:24:09.730
That's yesterday's,
cautioned Margie.

00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:11.810
I'll eat it before
I get to the road.

00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:14.250
Crystal squeezed her
mother's shoulder,

00:24:14.250 --> 00:24:17.940
you know the cabin is
a dump, see you later.

00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:21.360
At the bottom of the stairs she
called back, they'd better let you

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:23.780
into Blackjack training,
those bastards.

00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:27.180
If they're letting Theresa do
it they'd better let you, too.

00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:29.390
She walks, as she always
did, quickly,

00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:32.380
impatiently with a long
short-legged stride

00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:35.610
down the driveway and to the road.

00:24:35.610 --> 00:24:38.510
As Margie absentmindedly
bit into a piece

00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:41.070
of day-old fry bread
she wondered to herself

00:24:41.070 --> 00:24:43.850
when the cabin's barrel
stove had been last cleaned

00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:47.380
and if the back door had
been properly latched?

00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:49.390
One of the worst things
to do once it gets cold,

00:24:49.390 --> 00:24:53.480 position:56%
cleaning up after a dirty stove in a
freezing room, she said to herself.

00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:56.240
Even worse if a raccoon gets in.

00:24:56.240 --> 00:25:00.060 position:56%
She microwaved a cup of instant
coffee, positioned her arch supports

00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:03.760
into Jowosh's old moccasins
that waited for her feet.

00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:05.810
Then, still in her pajamas,

00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:10.050
sat outside on the log-splitting
stump dunking day-old fry bread

00:25:10.050 --> 00:25:14.360
and contemplating the cutoff path
that led from Beryl's trailer back

00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:18.110
to the LeForest allotment house.

00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:19.910
[Indian] Thank you.

00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:27.510
[ Applause ]

00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:32.040
[ Pause ]

00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:33.340
&gt;&gt; Stephen Graham Jones: Hello.

00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:35.100
You all can hear me, yes?

00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:36.400
All right.

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:38.600
You'll notice I skated in
at the last possible moment.

00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:41.790
There's a lot of knife
drama with getting

00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:46.790
into this building
evidently, you know?

00:25:46.790 --> 00:25:50.450
But nobody got cut or
threatened or anything.

00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:54.370
Really, when it showed up in my
inbox asking me to come here,

00:25:54.370 --> 00:25:58.740 position:56%
like I had the idea that The Library
of Congress was like an abstract,

00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:00.040
I thought it was an idea.

00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:02.470
I didn't know it was a
physical place, you know?

00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:05.400
So coming here it's like
I'm going to a fake -

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:08.570
like stepping into a
platonic ideal kind of,

00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:10.940
it's kind of cool, I like it.

00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:13.200
Thank you, all, for coming out.

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:14.500
Thank you, all, for hosting.

00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:17.770
This is really a cool,
cool thing to do.

00:26:17.770 --> 00:26:21.550
And I want to read you all a little
bit from my new novel, Mongrels,

00:26:21.550 --> 00:26:24.810
and also thank you all for
letting me read here because I get

00:26:24.810 --> 00:26:27.030
to hang-out with my
editor who got the book,

00:26:27.030 --> 00:26:28.750
for like three minutes
I get to see her later.

00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:30.410
It's going to be cool, you know?

00:26:30.410 --> 00:26:37.690 position:56%
All you need to know at this point
in the novel is werewolves are real,

00:26:37.690 --> 00:26:42.040
and there's an uncle named Darren,
an aunt named Libby, and a kid,

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:45.540
he's 14 years old, he's waiting to
see if he's got the blood or not,

00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:47.060
if he's a werewolf or not.

00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:52.660
And I forgot my glasses,
so this could be fun,

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:56.070
and I'm on the wrong page, too.

00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:58.610
Hold on, hold on.

00:26:58.610 --> 00:27:01.350
This is only my third time
to read from this book.

00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:04.510
Today is the actual official
launch date for this book.

00:27:04.510 --> 00:27:09.150
[ Applause ]

00:27:09.150 --> 00:27:10.450
Thank you.

00:27:10.450 --> 00:27:13.070
This is from a chapter
titled American Ninja.

00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:16.820
Did you all watch American
Ninja coming up, any of you all?

00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:19.430
Michael Dudikoff, he can
kick like anybody in the face

00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:21.640 position:56%
and that solves all problems, right?

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:22.940
That's pretty cool.

00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:25.480
All right.

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:27.290
We're werewolves.

00:27:27.290 --> 00:27:30.910
Each night at dusk one of us leans
out the door to burn the trash.

00:27:30.910 --> 00:27:32.600
Just because we all
know what can happen

00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:34.950
if that trash is left
in the kitchen.

00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:37.540
Somebody will go wolf in the night.

00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:41.190
And because shifting burns up every
last bit of fat reserves you have

00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:43.580
and even leaves you
in the hole for more,

00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:45.760
the first thing you
think once you're a wolf,

00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:50.640
the only thing you can think if
you're just starting out is food.

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:53.090
It's not a choice,
it's just survival.

00:27:53.090 --> 00:27:56.540 position:56%
You eat whatever is there and fast,
be it the people sleeping around you

00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:59.090
at the rest stop or if
you get a trailer rented

00:27:59.090 --> 00:28:01.750
for four months, the kitchen trash.

00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:04.280
It sounds stupid, but it's true.

00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:08.000 position:56%
When we first open our eyes as
werewolves the trash is so fragrant,

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.760
so perfect, so right
there, except there's things

00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:16.190
in there you can't digest, I
don't care how bad you are.

00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:19.440
Ever wake with the ragged
lid of a tin can in your gut?

00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:23.650
Darren says it's like a circle
saw blade in first gear,

00:28:23.650 --> 00:28:27.590
but it's only because you're so
delicate in the morning, so human.

00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:31.570
Even a twist-tie can stab through
the lining of your stomach.

00:28:31.570 --> 00:28:32.870
The wolf doesn't know any better,

00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:37.270
just knows to eat it
all and fast and now.

00:28:37.270 --> 00:28:40.130
Come daylight, though, so
many werewolves die this way,

00:28:40.130 --> 00:28:42.340
Libby had told me, so many die

00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:44.520
with a broke tined
fork stabbing them open

00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:46.880
from the middle, from the inside.

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:49.030
With a discarded whole
beef rib pushing

00:28:49.030 --> 00:28:51.560
through their spleen,
their pancreas.

00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:54.500
She said she even heard of
somebody dying from a housedog

00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:57.700
that had had its pelvis put
together with a metal rod.

00:28:57.700 --> 00:29:00.350
The metal rod, it went down
the wolf's throat fine,

00:29:00.350 --> 00:29:03.310
along with the crunchy domestic
bones, but in the morning

00:29:03.310 --> 00:29:06.990
for the man it was a spear.

00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:10.570
Libby had stopped meaningfully
on spear, settled me in her stare

00:29:10.570 --> 00:29:13.330
to make sure I was paying
the right kind of attention.

00:29:13.330 --> 00:29:15.450
I had been, sort of.

00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:18.570
Because I was sure I was going
to shift just any night now,

00:29:18.570 --> 00:29:20.780
was going to pad on all
fours down the long hall

00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:22.610
from my bedroom at any moment.

00:29:22.610 --> 00:29:24.740
Sniff at the coffee table,
then turn my attention

00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:27.210
to the much richer
scent of the kitchen,

00:29:27.210 --> 00:29:28.920
because that was definitely
going to happen.

00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:31.340
I always lug the trash out.

00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:34.360 position:56%
Never mind that Libby had always
been careful to not leave steel wool

00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:36.820
or bleach containers in there.

00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:39.260
Never mind that we kept a jug
of black pepper right there

00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:42.630 position:56%
on the counter to sprinkle on to the
trash as it built through the day.

00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:44.600
I'd be able to smell
through that, I knew.

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:47.620
I was going to be that
kind of werewolf,

00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:50.320
in spite of Libby's prayers.

00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:53.440
The life she wanted for me, it
was a life my mom should have had,

00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:56.130
the life that her not being a
werewolf should have been mine

00:29:56.130 --> 00:29:59.190
by birthright, but
something had gone haywire.

00:29:59.190 --> 00:30:00.490
Just once, just waiting, though.

00:30:00.490 --> 00:30:02.430
That was the part her and
Darren couldn't figure.

00:30:02.430 --> 00:30:05.490
I had the blood, but was
that blood ever going to rise

00:30:05.490 --> 00:30:07.990
or had it been a onetime thing?

00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:11.630
With grandpa five years gone there
weren't even any old-timers to ask,

00:30:11.630 --> 00:30:15.010
did this happen before, had
there ever been somebody like me?

00:30:15.010 --> 00:30:16.740
There had to have been.

00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:19.300
Werewolves have always been here.

00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:22.780
Every variation of us, it has
to have happened at some point.

00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:26.050
Just it's the remembering
that's tricky.

00:30:26.050 --> 00:30:28.980
Until we knew for sure one way or
the other Libby was packing my head

00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:32.640
with facts, like trying to
scare me back across the line.

00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:36.570
driving here from East Texas, the
big Delta 88 eating up the miles,

00:30:36.570 --> 00:30:40.000
the trunk empty because all our
stuff had burned a move or two ago.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.990
She'd evened her voice out to
sound like a safety pamphlet

00:30:42.990 --> 00:30:44.920
and recounted all the
ways we usually die.

00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:51.650
It was the werewolf version of The
Talk, just with more dead bodies.

00:30:51.650 --> 00:30:54.980
It took nearly the whole 10 hours,
no radio, no books, nothing.

00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:56.540
I stared a hole into the dashboard,

00:30:56.540 --> 00:30:58.840
not wanting to let her see
how perfect all this was,

00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:02.380
how much I was loving every
single wonderful fact.

00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:04.940
She had already told
me about the trash.

00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:07.430
The rest, though, being
a werewolf it's a game

00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:09.660
of Russian roulette,
Darren would say.

00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:12.040
It's waking up every morning
with that gun to your temple.

00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:13.990
And then he'd snap
his teeth over the end

00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:16.200
of that sentence and
give a yip or two.

00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:18.850
And I'd have to look away so
Libby wouldn't see me smiling.

00:31:18.850 --> 00:31:21.840
I wanted to be him so bad.

00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:23.890
But trash isn't the only way we go.

00:31:23.890 --> 00:31:27.300
The modern world its custom
design to kill werewolves.

00:31:27.300 --> 00:31:29.790
There's French-fries for one.

00:31:29.790 --> 00:31:31.540
The idea, Libby said,
switching hands

00:31:31.540 --> 00:31:34.420
on the Delta 88's thin steering
wheel and steering straight ahead,

00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:36.850
boring holes into the
night with her eyes -

00:31:36.850 --> 00:31:39.850
the idea is werewolves think
they'll burn all those calories

00:31:39.850 --> 00:31:41.150
up the next time they shift.

00:31:41.150 --> 00:31:46.120
And they're not wrong, you burn up
your French-fry calories and more.

00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:49.390
But calories aren't the
dangerous part of the French-fry,

00:31:49.390 --> 00:31:52.490 position:56%
the dangerous part of the French-fry
is that once you have a taste

00:31:52.490 --> 00:31:57.090
for them then running around in a
pasture one night chasing wild boar

00:31:57.090 --> 00:32:00.140
or digging up rabbits or
whatever, all honest work,

00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:02.700
you'll catch that salty
scent on the air.

00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:05.470
If you still had your human
mind you'd know not to chase

00:32:05.470 --> 00:32:08.480
that scent down, you'd know better.

00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:10.510
You're not thinking
like that, though.

00:32:10.510 --> 00:32:13.000
You run like smoke through
the trees, over the fences,

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.900 position:56%
and when you find those French-fries
they're usually on a picnic table

00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:19.410
in some deserted place,
which is a dream, right?

00:32:19.410 --> 00:32:23.380 position:56%
Except for the couple sitting on
opposite sides of that picnic table.

00:32:23.380 --> 00:32:26.000
They can be young and broke,
having had to dig into couches

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.690
for enough change for this
weekly basket of fries to split

00:32:28.690 --> 00:32:30.390
out at their favorite place.

00:32:30.390 --> 00:32:33.300 position:56%
Or they can be the 50-year
anniversary set indulging themselves

00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:35.230
on exactly the kind
of greasy fat they're

00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:37.990
under strict orders
to stay away from.

00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:40.960
What they should really stay
away from, it turns out,

00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:43.810
is eating those French-fries
out in the open.

00:32:43.810 --> 00:32:46.380
They don't know they live
in a world with werewolves.

00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:49.970
By the time they do
know it's too late.

00:32:49.970 --> 00:32:52.520
Blind with hunger you
barrel up under that table

00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:54.480
and snatch the fries
in a single motion.

00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:56.350
I've eaten them bag
and all by the time

00:32:56.350 --> 00:32:59.810
that picnic table is two
leaping bounds behind you.

00:32:59.810 --> 00:33:02.400
At which point you register
that distinct flavor of salt

00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:06.460
on this couple's fingertips,
as well, around their lips.

00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:09.340
Your paws skid in the gravel,
the dust under that gravel rising

00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:12.970
in a plume, you're about to
rip open, explode back through.

00:33:12.970 --> 00:33:15.890
The newspaper the next day
won't show crime scene photos

00:33:15.890 --> 00:33:18.970
of the remains or the blood
splashed picnic table.

00:33:18.970 --> 00:33:20.490
You won't need them.

00:33:20.490 --> 00:33:23.060
You'll have those photographs
in your head already.

00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:26.800
And those kind of visual flashes
Darren says you get in the daytime,

00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:28.940
like half-remembered dreams.

00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:31.440
And you'll think French-fries.

00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:34.510
And the next time you follow that
salty scent in from the pasture,

00:33:34.510 --> 00:33:38.040
an honest rabbit dangling limp
from either side of your jowls,

00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:41.370
that two-lane highway you have to
cross to get to that tanginess,

00:33:41.370 --> 00:33:44.220
maybe this time there'll be a
semi hurtling down the near lane,

00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:46.940
it's grill guard thick
and purposeful.

00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:49.890
Or there'll be men on the roof
of the cinderblock bathroom,

00:33:49.890 --> 00:33:52.730
their rifles waiting,
obituaries folded

00:33:52.730 --> 00:33:55.150
in their tall leather wallets.

00:33:55.150 --> 00:33:57.460
I'm going to skip a page here

00:33:57.460 --> 00:34:00.790
because I don't want
to go over my time.

00:34:00.790 --> 00:34:05.160
This is another way they die,
there's a lot of ways they die.

00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:09.190
There's not an easy
way to transition

00:34:09.190 --> 00:34:10.550
to this, so I'll just jump in.

00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:16.770
Frankenstein didn't have to worry
about Lycra, though, or spandex.

00:34:16.770 --> 00:34:21.020 position:56%
Stretch pants are just as
dangerous to werewolves as highways.

00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:22.520
Libby is always careful
to wear denim

00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:25.500
and Darren wouldn't be caught
dead in anything but jeans.

00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:26.820
Me either.

00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:29.850
The good thing about jeans
is that they rip-away.

00:34:29.850 --> 00:34:31.470
Not at the seams, like you'd think,

00:34:31.470 --> 00:34:33.560
that yellow thread there
is tough like fishing line.

00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:37.510
In the center of the denim,
where it's worn the thinnest.

00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:39.920
It sucks always having to
buy new ones or finding ones

00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:41.580
at the [inaudible] store
with long enough legs,

00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:43.540
but that's just part
of being a werewolf.

00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:48.270
A pair of tights, though,
man, pantyhose are murder.

00:34:48.270 --> 00:34:50.780
Libby had only heard
about this, never seen it,

00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:53.960
but supposedly what can happen is
you've wriggled into a pair of hose

00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:56.540 position:56%
or tights, except for color I really
don't understand the difference

00:34:56.540 --> 00:34:59.820
between the two, and then over
the course of the day they're

00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:01.490
such a constant annoyance
that you kind

00:35:01.490 --> 00:35:03.720
of forget about them all together.

00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:07.550
Enter night then, begin
the transformation.

00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:10.660
Where pants will tear away,
split over the thigh and calf,

00:35:10.660 --> 00:35:13.280
burst at the waist no matter
how double-riveted they are,

00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:17.440
your fancy pantyhose, your stretch
pants they wolf out with you.

00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:20.460
I'd imagine you look kind of stupid
with your legs all sheer and shiny,

00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:23.640
but anybody who laughs you
just rip their throat out,

00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:27.530
feast on their heart,
problem solved.

00:35:27.530 --> 00:35:30.210
At least until morning
when you shift back.

00:35:30.210 --> 00:35:33.750
Just like that tick that impacted
itself into grandpa's skin,

00:35:33.750 --> 00:35:37.480
a pair of pantyhose, they'll
retract with your legs.

00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:40.610
Except instead of one tick
embedding itself in your skin,

00:35:40.610 --> 00:35:41.910
flaring into some infection,

00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:45.380
this time every hair is pulling
something back in with it.

00:35:45.380 --> 00:35:50.450
What happens is your skin, your
human skin is part pantyhose now.

00:35:50.450 --> 00:35:53.290
Like the hose have melted on
to you, but deeper than deep.

00:35:53.290 --> 00:35:56.270
And because you just used all
your calories shifting back,

00:35:56.270 --> 00:35:57.670
it's not easy like on television.

00:35:57.670 --> 00:36:01.110
And because you're hurt now you
probably can't go back to wolf yet,

00:36:01.110 --> 00:36:04.920
can't get tough enough to sustain
this kind of all-over injury.

00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:08.920
Worst, this isn't an immediate
death, you linger through the day.

00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:10.730
If your family, your
werewolf family,

00:36:10.730 --> 00:36:12.570
if they really love you
they'll end it for you.

00:36:12.570 --> 00:36:15.300
If you're alone then its hours
of trying to pull those pantyhose

00:36:15.300 --> 00:36:16.940
up from your bloody skin.

00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:19.770
Its fine, slippery threads of
that hose ducking into your veins

00:36:19.770 --> 00:36:22.560
and getting pumped
higher into your body.

00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:25.700
If you're lucky one of those
clumps makes its way to your brain.

00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:28.250
If you're not lucky then you end
up trying to use your human teeth

00:36:28.250 --> 00:36:30.450
to peel-up all the skin
from the top of your thigh,

00:36:30.450 --> 00:36:33.000
the back of your calf,
wherever you can reach.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.620
It doesn't help.

00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:36.250
I don't know what the
coroner calls these kind

00:36:36.250 --> 00:36:38.550
of deaths, probably drug psychosis.

00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:41.940
Obvious enough to him that a
blood test isn't even necessary.

00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:44.180
Look at this trailer, this living
room, how they were living.

00:36:44.180 --> 00:36:46.090
Look at how she was
picking at her skin.

00:36:46.090 --> 00:36:49.870
Bag her up, team, and drop
a match on your way out.

00:36:49.870 --> 00:36:53.820
But there's another way we die,
too, the oldest way maybe -

00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:55.250
which is in the rest of the book.

00:36:55.250 --> 00:36:57.510
Thank you, all.

00:36:57.510 --> 00:37:09.330
[ Applause ]

00:37:09.330 --> 00:37:12.570 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Deborah Miranda: Thank you,
everybody, that was really terrific.

00:37:12.570 --> 00:37:14.000
My name is Deborah Miranda.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.280
I'm from the Ohlone-Costanoan
Esselen Nation

00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:17.980
of the Greater Monterrey Bay Area.

00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:21.410
So I am a long way
from home right now.

00:37:21.410 --> 00:37:24.770
Never in a million years did I
think I would be standing here

00:37:24.770 --> 00:37:28.980
at an indigenous panel in The
Library of Congress in Washington,

00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:33.600
D.C. Washington, D.C. is a city
that's been the source of a lot

00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:37.720
of devastating legislature
for Native Americans,

00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:40.330
legislature that was meant
to separate Native people

00:37:40.330 --> 00:37:44.730
from our lands, our
cultures and even our lives.

00:37:44.730 --> 00:37:49.930
My own people, a conglomeration
of California Indian tribes,

00:37:49.930 --> 00:37:56.520
were on the receiving end of
nearly $2 million of bonds approved

00:37:56.520 --> 00:38:00.670
by Congress to fund extermination
of tribes in California

00:38:00.670 --> 00:38:05.100
that were blocking various
kinds of American expansion.

00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:09.920
So our population plummeted from
about one million pre-contact

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:13.410
to 5,000 to 10,000 150 years later.

00:38:13.410 --> 00:38:15.950
A lot of that was funded
right here in Washington,

00:38:15.950 --> 00:38:24.580
D.C. But the good news is I'm here
and we are here, and a large part

00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:30.020
of that is due to some pretty
innovative survival techniques.

00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:33.450
So we're still here and
we're still telling stories.

00:38:33.450 --> 00:38:40.560
My first question that I have
for this crew here, I wanted to -

00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:42.800
I was thinking about something

00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:44.510
that Elizabeth Cookland
[Assumed Spelling] said,

00:38:44.510 --> 00:38:49.080
she's Crow Creek Lakota
Native poet and writer,

00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:51.030
and she said that any nation

00:38:51.030 --> 00:38:54.470
that does not tell its own
stories cannot actually say,

00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:58.330 position:56%
claim that status of being a nation,

00:38:58.330 --> 00:39:02.410
if you let somebody else tell your
stories then you've already lost.

00:39:02.410 --> 00:39:07.740
And I was wondering what you think
about that statement from Liz,

00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:12.810
who is a fairly well known
person as well as writer?

00:39:12.810 --> 00:39:19.450
So what do you think
about that saying?

00:39:19.450 --> 00:39:21.210
&gt;&gt; Stephen Graham Jones: I guess
I pretty much always disagree

00:39:21.210 --> 00:39:22.510
with everything she says.

00:39:22.510 --> 00:39:25.080
I probably disagree
with it, finally.

00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:30.530
&gt;&gt; Deborah Miranda: I
think the word people use

00:39:30.530 --> 00:39:33.210
for her is polemic,
that's the polite word.

00:39:33.210 --> 00:39:35.360
Eric, how about you?

00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:37.850
&gt;&gt; Eric Gansworth:
Well, it's very extreme

00:39:37.850 --> 00:39:41.910
and I think that's
sort of her signature.

00:39:41.910 --> 00:39:46.640
There's just so much more nuance
in what we do that I just -

00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:51.580 position:56%
I think that it doesn't really leave
a lot of room for other people.

00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:52.880
&gt;&gt; Stephen Graham Jones:
That's the trick,

00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:55.490
the leaving room is the hard part
because people always want to build

00:39:55.490 --> 00:39:57.460
like exclusive clubs
on top of a mountain

00:39:57.460 --> 00:39:59.560
that only certain people can get
into, and it seems like a lot

00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:03.380
of her stuff does that, you know?

00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:05.730 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Linda LeGarde Grover: I'd like
to say something, but I can't figure

00:40:05.730 --> 00:40:11.470
out how - oh, I bet it's
this thing, you think so?

00:40:11.470 --> 00:40:14.760
&gt;&gt; Stephen Graham Jones: A
lifesaver, it's on the bottom.

00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:19.920
&gt;&gt; Linda LeGarde Grover:
I think it's this one.

00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:24.430
All right, thank you so much.

00:40:24.430 --> 00:40:28.340
I wonder if perhaps
what she is saying is -

00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:30.230
she's certainly never met my dad,

00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:33.790
who lived way up in
Northern Minnesota there.

00:40:33.790 --> 00:40:39.360
but what he used to tell us in
experiences that we were having

00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:42.160
and some were great and
some were not so great,

00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:45.250
but he would always
say make it your own.

00:40:45.250 --> 00:40:50.840
And so, you know, just kind
of take it and make it part

00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:52.140
of the greater experience

00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:56.870
and whether you actually
purposely tell a story

00:40:56.870 --> 00:41:02.690
or not these things do become
part of the larger story.

00:41:02.690 --> 00:41:07.880
I'm not sure what he would have
said if he read this quote,

00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:12.870 position:56%
but I think he would have encouraged
us to remember, to always remember,

00:41:12.870 --> 00:41:17.270
and that at some point the time
will be right to make it yours,

00:41:17.270 --> 00:41:22.050
use it for the best way
and perhaps pass it on.

00:41:22.050 --> 00:41:23.680
&gt;&gt; Deborah Miranda: Well, I
think that's a great point

00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:25.990
because I think what
Cookland forgets there is

00:41:25.990 --> 00:41:28.180
that sometimes Native
people are put in a position

00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:33.320 position:56%
where they are not allowed to speak,
cannot speak, and so you don't speak

00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:36.080
because you need to
save your life, right?

00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:38.620 position:56%
Stephen, what were you going to say?

00:41:38.620 --> 00:41:40.150 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Stephen Graham Jones: I was going
to say that I do usually disagree

00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:42.950
with Cookland on pretty much
everything, but I'm glad she's

00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:45.470
out there because she gives
us like a rallying point

00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:48.730
to negatively define ourselves
against, which is fun.

00:41:48.730 --> 00:41:50.940
I like that, you know?

00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:53.040
You can drop anything she
says in any conversation

00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:54.610
and you've got three
hours of conversation

00:41:54.610 --> 00:42:01.800
after that, which is good I think.

00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:03.910
I'm glad she's doing
what she's doing.

00:42:03.910 --> 00:42:05.810
She's not here, is she?

00:42:05.810 --> 00:42:07.520 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Deborah Miranda: Would it matter?

00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:09.250
That's why they took
your knife away.

00:42:09.250 --> 00:42:15.250
Okay, my second question
is one that I stole

00:42:15.250 --> 00:42:17.080
from Monacan [Assumed
Spelling] poet,

00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:19.530
Karen Wood [Assumed
Spelling], who is here today.

00:42:19.530 --> 00:42:21.960
And she said that she asked Sherman
Aleslie [Assumed Spelling] this

00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:24.320
question and it stumped
him and that he got away

00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:25.910
without really answering it.

00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:29.510
So the question is what is the
biggest risk you've ever taken

00:42:29.510 --> 00:42:34.460
as a writer, and that's the tricky
part, as a writer, not as a person?

00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:36.760
What's the biggest risk?

00:42:37.890 --> 00:42:40.410
&gt;&gt; Linda LeGarde Grover:
Writing nonfiction.

00:42:40.410 --> 00:42:42.140
&gt;&gt; Deborah Miranda: Okay, how come?

00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:43.440
&gt;&gt; Linda LeGarde Grover: How come?

00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:49.570 position:56%
I think there's a reason that I went
to fiction and I found it was easier

00:42:49.570 --> 00:42:55.980 position:56%
to tell the story with that little
barrier, that little veil between me

00:42:55.980 --> 00:43:00.320
as the person responsible
for this particular story

00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:04.400
at this particular time and then
whoever reads it or hears it

00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:06.250
or receives it in some way.

00:43:06.250 --> 00:43:10.940
And so I actually haven't had
- I really haven't had the guts

00:43:10.940 --> 00:43:18.680
yet to take the risk of writing
nonfiction, though I might.

00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:19.980
&gt;&gt; Deborah Miranda: Okay.

00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:21.280
&gt;&gt; Stephen Graham Jones: Nonfiction
is scary, it's like standing

00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:23.670
in front of everybody and slowly
taking all your clothes off,

00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:24.970
you know?

00:43:24.970 --> 00:43:26.270
It's a weird thing.

00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:27.690
I don't understand -
nonfiction is wonderful and fun,

00:43:27.690 --> 00:43:30.910
but it's so difficult and scary.

00:43:30.910 --> 00:43:33.910
The biggest risk I've taken,
I guess I'm still taking it.

00:43:33.910 --> 00:43:37.690
When I first started out writing
my publishers wanted - they said,

00:43:37.690 --> 00:43:38.990
hey, you're American Indian.

00:43:38.990 --> 00:43:42.670
And I said, yeah - it wasn't
that interesting to me,

00:43:42.670 --> 00:43:45.210
but it was interesting to them,
it's a marketing hug, you know?

00:43:45.210 --> 00:43:49.640
And they said why don't you
go by your family's name,

00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:50.940
Calf Looking [Assumed Spelling],

00:43:50.940 --> 00:43:52.960
and they said that'll
sell books, that's exotic?

00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:58.210
And I thought, well, I do want to
sell books, but then I thought also

00:43:58.210 --> 00:44:02.140 position:56%
that it'd be a much bigger coup if
I can make it as a boring old Jones,

00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:06.240
then it's all on my writing ability
or inability or whatever, you know?

00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:10.460
Whereas, if I were still a Calf
Looking then I would always be

00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:13.430
wondering are people picking
up my book because that looks

00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:17.150
like a whole sentence or what,
I mean what is it, you know?

00:44:17.150 --> 00:44:18.450
So I'm still taking that.

00:44:18.450 --> 00:44:19.750
&gt;&gt; Deborah Miranda: So
you're not [inaudible]?

00:44:19.750 --> 00:44:21.050
&gt;&gt; Stephen Graham Jones: No, no.

00:44:21.050 --> 00:44:22.350
&gt;&gt; Deborah Miranda: All right.

00:44:22.350 --> 00:44:23.650
Eric?

00:44:23.650 --> 00:44:26.450
&gt;&gt; Eric Gansworth: I think
I probably did it unaware,

00:44:26.450 --> 00:44:30.870
and that was to kind of recognize
at some point that I was writing

00:44:30.870 --> 00:44:35.380
about the nuances of very
small tribal politics

00:44:35.380 --> 00:44:44.590
and that do not really speak to
a larger audience in its nuances.

00:44:44.590 --> 00:44:48.560
I worked very briefly for the
Administration for Native Americans

00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:53.210
and this is how I discovered
how insular my work was.

00:44:53.210 --> 00:44:56.420
That I was working, you know,
you're doing grant reading.

00:44:56.420 --> 00:44:59.830
And one of the employees came
up and knocked on my door

00:44:59.830 --> 00:45:02.430
and said can we speak
to you for a minute?

00:45:02.430 --> 00:45:04.710
And I thought, oh,
what have I done now?

00:45:04.710 --> 00:45:09.130
And said, well, you are affiliated
with two of the only three tribes

00:45:09.130 --> 00:45:10.790
that refuse to have a relationship

00:45:10.790 --> 00:45:13.890
with the Federal Government,
can you tell us why?

00:45:13.890 --> 00:45:16.980
And I didn't realize it,
I guess I had assumed

00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:21.490
when you're deeply inside
of something you assume

00:45:21.490 --> 00:45:24.420
that many other groups are
along those same lines.

00:45:24.420 --> 00:45:29.890
So inadvertently I just rolled them
up, very insular tribal politics.

00:45:29.890 --> 00:45:31.230
&gt;&gt; Deborah Miranda:
Okay, and that was a risk

00:45:31.230 --> 00:45:34.140
because of readership and interest?

00:45:34.140 --> 00:45:36.560
&gt;&gt; Eric Gansworth: Yes, I think
probably, yes, it's too obscure

00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:39.520
for a general reader and
I think the community I'm

00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:43.410
from is probably mortified that I
wrote about such insular things.

00:45:43.410 --> 00:45:47.540
So I think I wrote a
book for four people.

00:45:49.010 --> 00:45:54.120
&gt;&gt; Deborah Miranda: Oh, that's
risky, all right, in many ways.

00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:58.070
Okay, so my next question
I'm going to steal

00:45:58.070 --> 00:46:01.320
from Dorothy Ellison [Assumed
Spelling], this is the question

00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:04.690
that she always asks
during her workshops -

00:46:04.690 --> 00:46:09.390
what is the story you
cannot die without telling?

00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:16.730
What is the story still
ahead that you haven't yet?

00:46:16.730 --> 00:46:18.030
&gt;&gt; Stephen Graham Jones:
That's terrifying

00:46:18.030 --> 00:46:20.630
because this werewolf one is
the one I always wanted to tell.

00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:21.930
&gt;&gt; Deborah Miranda: Oh, no.

00:46:21.930 --> 00:46:26.050
&gt;&gt; Stephen Graham Jones:
So I'm going to die now.

00:46:26.050 --> 00:46:28.230
&gt;&gt; Deborah Miranda: The
rapture is upon you.

00:46:28.230 --> 00:46:29.530
All right.

00:46:29.530 --> 00:46:30.960
Linda, any ideas?

00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:34.310
&gt;&gt; Linda LeGarde Grover: What
I'm working on now maybe,

00:46:34.310 --> 00:46:37.330
which is another part of the story

00:46:37.330 --> 00:46:41.940
that continues the
fictional extended family,

00:46:41.940 --> 00:46:46.730
the fictional Mozhay Point
Reservation in Northern Minnesota,

00:46:46.730 --> 00:46:56.470 position:56%
which brings us into some really,
really difficult issues having to do

00:46:56.470 --> 00:47:01.450
with foster homes and home
placements and experiences.

00:47:01.450 --> 00:47:06.860
And so I certainly hope I live
long enough to finish this.

00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:08.770
It's a story that I
would like to tell.

00:47:08.770 --> 00:47:13.140
I'm not the only person with a
story like that, but I can tell -

00:47:13.140 --> 00:47:15.320
but that's what I hope to do.

00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:16.650
&gt;&gt; Deborah Miranda: Okay.

00:47:16.650 --> 00:47:18.840
Anything come to mind?

00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:21.470
&gt;&gt; Eric Gansworth: I think that I'm
kind of in the process of doing it.

00:47:21.470 --> 00:47:23.580
Usually when I'm starting
a new project I look

00:47:23.580 --> 00:47:25.130
to see what I've been avoiding.

00:47:25.130 --> 00:47:29.060
Because I find as a writer that
where I'm most tense is probably

00:47:29.060 --> 00:47:31.670
where the most interesting
material is going to come from.

00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:34.950
And after several novels I realized
that I was writing a pattern

00:47:34.950 --> 00:47:38.320
of childhood, childhood,
childhood, early adulthood,

00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:41.260
and there was a whole gap of
seven years of middle school

00:47:41.260 --> 00:47:45.860
to high school that were just
so traumatizing and horrifying

00:47:45.860 --> 00:47:49.850
that I pretended they do not
exist for most of my career.

00:47:49.850 --> 00:47:52.650
And so gradually over the last
few years I've been working on it,

00:47:52.650 --> 00:47:55.320
and it's tough, it's tougher
than I thought it was going to be

00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:59.050
because you have to
relive some of it but then

00:47:59.050 --> 00:48:03.190
at the same time it
seems like it's also some

00:48:03.190 --> 00:48:05.380
of the material that's been
the most important to me.

00:48:05.380 --> 00:48:11.120
I guess it dwells most inside and
I've been refusing to let it out.

00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:12.420
&gt;&gt; Deborah Miranda: Go ahead?

00:48:12.420 --> 00:48:13.720
&gt;&gt; Stephen Graham Jones: We
should make a writing team

00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:15.940
because I write really good from
like 12 years old to 17 years old.

00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:19.000
&gt;&gt; Deborah Miranda: There you go.

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:21.960
Well, that's interesting,
the whole conversation there,

00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:26.750
because I really think writing
what we're most afraid of is kind

00:48:26.750 --> 00:48:29.740
of the whole point
of writing, right?

00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:32.180
&gt;&gt; Stephen Graham Jones: You know
what I'm most afraid of is people

00:48:32.180 --> 00:48:34.480
with dog heads, that terrifies me.

00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:36.850
Like that's my nightmare, I'm going
to walk around a corner and walk

00:48:36.850 --> 00:48:38.600
into a chest, and I'm going
to be like, excuse me, sir.

00:48:38.600 --> 00:48:40.470 position:56%
And I'm going to look up and there's
going to be a dog head there.

00:48:40.470 --> 00:48:41.930
That's going to be the
end of it, you know?

00:48:41.930 --> 00:48:43.230
But that's why I write
about werewolves

00:48:43.230 --> 00:48:45.990
because that's basically
what they are, you know?

00:48:45.990 --> 00:48:49.520
I keep thinking if write on the
page well enough or well enough

00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:51.540
for myself that I can
move on to the next thing,

00:48:51.540 --> 00:48:54.420
but it just makes it more
real and more scary, you know?

00:48:54.420 --> 00:48:55.970
&gt;&gt; Deborah Miranda: It's
supposed to capture it, you know,

00:48:55.970 --> 00:48:58.150
provide some safety there.

00:48:58.150 --> 00:49:02.350
Last question here I think
and then we'll do q-and-a.

00:49:02.350 --> 00:49:08.260 position:56%
I wanted to know, I know that you're
all teachers, you all teach writing

00:49:08.260 --> 00:49:10.680
in some way, and I'm wondering, a,

00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:15.060
how does teaching create a writing
affect, you as a writer or, b,

00:49:15.060 --> 00:49:20.590
you can pick, you have options
here, b, does being somebody

00:49:20.590 --> 00:49:21.890
who identifies as indigenous

00:49:21.890 --> 00:49:26.170
and probably teaches mostly
non-indigenous students how does

00:49:26.170 --> 00:49:31.470
that affect your writing,
if it does?

00:49:31.470 --> 00:49:32.930
&gt;&gt; Linda LeGarde Grover: I
don't teach creative writing.

00:49:32.930 --> 00:49:34.230
&gt;&gt; Deborah Miranda: Oh, okay.

00:49:34.230 --> 00:49:35.530
&gt;&gt; Linda LeGarde Grover:
That's fine.

00:49:35.530 --> 00:49:38.910
I teach a variety of American
Indian studies classes,

00:49:38.910 --> 00:49:42.940
and one of them is
a literature class.

00:49:42.940 --> 00:49:47.190
But, yes, it is true
that where I work most

00:49:47.190 --> 00:49:49.450
of the students are non-Native.

00:49:49.450 --> 00:49:53.180 position:56%
And how does that affect my writing?

00:49:53.180 --> 00:49:59.110
In some ways I think it
perhaps strengthens it

00:49:59.110 --> 00:50:03.870
and even perhaps eases it,
knowing that there's stories

00:50:03.870 --> 00:50:07.670
that can be told and that must
be cared for and protected

00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:10.710
and then perhaps passed
on in that way.

00:50:10.710 --> 00:50:18.490
And so and I also think that
I perhaps gain a little bit

00:50:18.490 --> 00:50:21.830
of understanding of some things in
the world outside of Indian country

00:50:21.830 --> 00:50:26.530
through reading the papers
that my students write.

00:50:26.530 --> 00:50:33.380
It's a real eye opener and also a
real privilege and a treat a lot

00:50:33.380 --> 00:50:38.770 position:56%
of times to read their
perceptions and what they have taken

00:50:38.770 --> 00:50:42.310
out of a novel and want
to give back to me.

00:50:42.310 --> 00:50:48.800
Of course, the problem is
that students that really want

00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:55.190 position:56%
to please me, you know, their grade
doesn't depend on their pleasing me.

00:50:55.190 --> 00:50:59.430
And so the perceptions
of those students I think

00:50:59.430 --> 00:51:01.150
that it's a great help.

00:51:01.150 --> 00:51:03.470
I hadn't thought about
that till you asked that.

00:51:03.470 --> 00:51:04.770
So, yes, thank you for asking.

00:51:04.770 --> 00:51:06.410
I'm going to go read
some more papers.

00:51:06.410 --> 00:51:10.530
&gt;&gt; Deborah Miranda: Wow, that's
the first time that's happened.

00:51:10.530 --> 00:51:13.300
Eric, how about you?

00:51:13.300 --> 00:51:16.310
&gt;&gt; Eric Gansworth: I would
say that I was kind of unaware

00:51:16.310 --> 00:51:19.310
that I was writing from an
indigenous perspective at first.

00:51:19.310 --> 00:51:24.500 position:56%
I was not a particularly avid reader
and I probably started reading

00:51:24.500 --> 00:51:28.290
because it was the era of
pre-VCR and so the only way

00:51:28.290 --> 00:51:31.370
to relive movies was to read
these really terrible novels

00:51:31.370 --> 00:51:33.260
that were made for horror films.

00:51:33.260 --> 00:51:36.650
And I wandered into reading
Carrie and Salem's Lot,

00:51:36.650 --> 00:51:38.120 position:56%
thinking they were non-realizations.

00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:43.900
And, wow, these are way better
than a lot of those others.

00:51:43.900 --> 00:51:47.430
And so that kind of was
the beginning of my desire

00:51:47.430 --> 00:51:50.070
to be a writer, was having
discovered Stephen King.

00:51:50.070 --> 00:51:53.510
And in college I had
written a novel and shown it

00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:56.580
to my creative writing professor,
and I thought I had really written

00:51:56.580 --> 00:51:59.080
like a Stephen King-ish novel.

00:51:59.080 --> 00:52:01.730
And when he handed it
back he said, well,

00:52:01.730 --> 00:52:03.870
that was a really fascinating
novel of the reservation,

00:52:03.870 --> 00:52:06.750
but what were those
monsters doing in there?

00:52:06.750 --> 00:52:11.010
And it was like a very illuminating
moment, like I had no idea

00:52:11.010 --> 00:52:13.660
that I had in fact already
started to internalize

00:52:13.660 --> 00:52:15.540
that story and refracted.

00:52:15.540 --> 00:52:18.960
And so at that point I said I
guess this is what I'm writing.

00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:23.480
And the monsters gradually wander
back in every now and then,

00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:29.010
but mostly after his comment I
saw that my family offered me

00:52:29.010 --> 00:52:36.330
such riches to tell about that I
wanted to do their stories right.

00:52:36.330 --> 00:52:37.630
&gt;&gt; Stephen Graham Jones:
Yes, it's the same for me.

00:52:37.630 --> 00:52:39.180
Like when I write about a
zombie who comes and messes

00:52:39.180 --> 00:52:41.740
up Sunday dinner it's really
the time my uncle got drunk

00:52:41.740 --> 00:52:44.110
and came to see us.

00:52:46.340 --> 00:52:50.080
But I'll try to tackle the
first part of that question,

00:52:50.080 --> 00:52:53.970
teaching creative writing, how
does that impact my writing?

00:52:53.970 --> 00:52:57.780
It makes me have to be accountable
because I tell my students,

00:52:57.780 --> 00:53:01.720
I just try to condition them
such that they spell okay

00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:03.370
with four letters, not two letters,

00:53:03.370 --> 00:53:05.160
and they don't put
their prose together

00:53:05.160 --> 00:53:06.590
with just and though and but.

00:53:06.590 --> 00:53:08.390
There's this whole litany of things

00:53:08.390 --> 00:53:11.800
that I think produces
better writing.

00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:15.400
So then when I'm at my own
keyboard doing my stuff I'll notice

00:53:15.400 --> 00:53:19.310
if I use just like three times
in a paragraph I'm like, man,

00:53:19.310 --> 00:53:23.130
Caitlin from class is going to
see that, I've got to be better.

00:53:23.130 --> 00:53:24.960
And so I think it makes me better,

00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:27.020
it makes me a more
aware writer anyways.

00:53:27.020 --> 00:53:30.530
And I think the more you can be on
the page the better author you are.

00:53:30.530 --> 00:53:33.400
&gt;&gt; Deborah Miranda: I agree.

00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:37.500
Okay, at this point we're going to
open it up to questions and answers

00:53:37.500 --> 00:53:40.600
from the audience, and we're going
to have a microphone that goes

00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:43.060
around so if you have a
question just raise your hand

00:53:43.060 --> 00:53:50.790
and we'll bring the mike to you.

00:53:50.790 --> 00:53:58.360
Anybody have questions?

00:53:58.360 --> 00:54:03.000
&gt;&gt; I'd love to know who have
been your particular individual

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:07.460
inspirations in your life,
your lives, when you were young

00:54:07.460 --> 00:54:11.800
as readers and then when
you were actually thinking

00:54:11.800 --> 00:54:15.050
about constructing literature?

00:54:15.050 --> 00:54:17.360
And those are maybe
two different things,

00:54:17.360 --> 00:54:21.070 position:56%
but who have been your
inspiration as reader and as writer?

00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:26.990
&gt;&gt; Eric Gansworth: I was
kind of the reader kid,

00:54:26.990 --> 00:54:29.660
I mean even though I was not
a particularly huge reader,

00:54:29.660 --> 00:54:32.590
like everybody in my family
hated reading, so that I liked it

00:54:32.590 --> 00:54:37.740
at all was kind of an anomaly.

00:54:37.740 --> 00:54:41.530
And I discovered, the Cliff notes
for my cousins, they don't want

00:54:41.530 --> 00:54:45.380
to read their books, they knew
I read books so they asked me

00:54:45.380 --> 00:54:49.100
to read their books and tell them
what it was they were supposed

00:54:49.100 --> 00:54:51.020
to have read for class.

00:54:51.020 --> 00:54:57.660
And I discovered The Red Pony and
To Kill a Mockingbird very early,

00:54:57.660 --> 00:55:00.430
and book now called The Pig Man.

00:55:00.430 --> 00:55:05.840
And I just found that I was being
moved by them, that I really wanted

00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:09.630
to meet these characters and it was
kind of that love of Stephen King

00:55:09.630 --> 00:55:14.790
after discovering that you could do
something beyond the novelization.

00:55:14.790 --> 00:55:18.580
And the tremendous luxury of right
as I was beginning to be serious

00:55:18.580 --> 00:55:21.330
about writing, Love
Medicine came out,

00:55:21.330 --> 00:55:26.430
so I was 19 when Love Medicine
came out and I thought, oh,

00:55:26.430 --> 00:55:28.610
well, this is what you can do.

00:55:28.610 --> 00:55:33.000
And so Louise Erdrich's, her first
novel was a really defining moment

00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:35.770
for me as a writer.

00:55:35.770 --> 00:55:37.070
&gt;&gt; Stephen Graham Jones:
You know, I started out,

00:55:37.070 --> 00:55:39.930
by the time I was 12 I had read
all of Louis L'amour's novels.

00:55:39.930 --> 00:55:42.290
Up until that time
there were 95 of them,

00:55:42.290 --> 00:55:43.930
and I thought they were
true, they were gospel.

00:55:43.930 --> 00:55:47.760
They're not exactly best friends
of the Indian or anything,

00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:50.060
but I loved them, you
know, I loved them.

00:55:50.060 --> 00:55:52.290
And I read novelizations,
too, the horror movies.

00:55:52.290 --> 00:55:54.740
I remember seeing inside Jason
Borghese's [Assumed Spelling] head

00:55:54.740 --> 00:55:56.120
was so cool and everything.

00:55:56.120 --> 00:55:59.760
But then, yes, I graduated -
I don't know if I graduated,

00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:03.380
graduated suggests a hierarchy - I
moved like laterally into Pynchon,

00:56:03.380 --> 00:56:07.660
Thomas Pynchon, and then
Thomas Pynchon was a gateway

00:56:07.660 --> 00:56:09.350
to Jerald Bezener [Assumed
Spelling].

00:56:09.350 --> 00:56:13.770
And then from tracking down Jerald
Bezener, everybody around him,

00:56:13.770 --> 00:56:16.380
I did - this sounds corny that
I would say Love Medicine, too,

00:56:16.380 --> 00:56:19.870
but Love Medicine really was a
transformative work for a lot

00:56:19.870 --> 00:56:21.880
of us, I suspect, you know?

00:56:21.880 --> 00:56:23.180
It did hit me hard.

00:56:23.180 --> 00:56:25.220
I've read that book a lot
of times trying to figure

00:56:25.220 --> 00:56:29.830
out its peculiar magic, and I don't
think I've figured it out yet.

00:56:29.830 --> 00:56:34.970
And, yes, Stephen King,
too, definitely [inaudible]

00:56:34.970 --> 00:56:36.320
and just comic books, too.

00:56:36.320 --> 00:56:38.080
I grew up on comic books, you know?

00:56:38.080 --> 00:56:40.060
I still read comic
books all the time.

00:56:40.060 --> 00:56:42.030
If I could draw I wouldn't
have any novels published

00:56:42.030 --> 00:56:46.990
because I'd be trying to
do comic books, you know?

00:56:46.990 --> 00:56:48.290
&gt;&gt; Linda LeGarde Grover:

00:56:48.290 --> 00:56:52.980
My inspiration I guess would be
the stories that I listened to

00:56:52.980 --> 00:56:57.420
and eavesdropped on when I
was a child because I was one

00:56:57.420 --> 00:57:02.250
of those kids who read a lot but
was also directed to get my nose

00:57:02.250 --> 00:57:04.090
out of the book and
go outside and play.

00:57:04.090 --> 00:57:06.800
And then I would hang
around and eavesdrop,

00:57:06.800 --> 00:57:10.240
and so probably annoyed
the adults very much.

00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:13.590
But that became like
reading a book for me,

00:57:13.590 --> 00:57:15.990
and I've always loved reading.

00:57:15.990 --> 00:57:21.330
I mean I read everything
I saw when I was a child.

00:57:21.330 --> 00:57:25.330
My uncle was - one of my uncles was
a janitor in our school district

00:57:25.330 --> 00:57:29.350
and he actually was supposed to be
disposing of a bunch of old books,

00:57:29.350 --> 00:57:32.880
and a ton of them were about
Russia during the Czar time,

00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:34.360
novels, history books.

00:57:34.360 --> 00:57:36.990
And he was supposed to toss them
out or incinerate them or whatever,

00:57:36.990 --> 00:57:38.650 position:56%
and he brought them up to our house.

00:57:38.650 --> 00:57:42.190
And so when I was a kid I had
a great time reading those.

00:57:42.190 --> 00:57:45.480
He brought me a big box of Reader's
Digests from the '40s and '50s

00:57:45.480 --> 00:57:47.410
and I loved reading those, too.

00:57:47.410 --> 00:57:50.050
I love Agatha Christie.

00:57:50.050 --> 00:57:55.620
I love Louise Erdrich's stuff
and for me the Erdrich book

00:57:55.620 --> 00:57:59.050
for me was Tracks when it came out

00:57:59.050 --> 00:58:00.610
and Fleur Pillager
[Assumed Spelling].

00:58:00.610 --> 00:58:05.390
So I loved to listen and
to read, and eventually

00:58:05.390 --> 00:58:07.800
after awhile I started
to write them I guess.

00:58:10.010 --> 00:58:11.310
&gt;&gt; Stephen Graham Jones: You
know, that compulsion to read,

00:58:11.310 --> 00:58:12.770
I had that too when I was a kid.

00:58:12.770 --> 00:58:15.980
I'd run out of Reader's Digests
so I'd go to my grandma's kitchen

00:58:15.980 --> 00:58:18.750 position:56%
and spin her Lazy Susan and it
would stop and I'd pull out of a can

00:58:18.750 --> 00:58:21.140
of soup and I'd read
everything on that soup can.

00:58:21.140 --> 00:58:23.530
Yes, then I'd do the beans and
then I'd move on down the -

00:58:23.530 --> 00:58:25.000
I just had to be reading,
if I wasn't thinking

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:34.230
in words I didn't feel like I
belonged on the planet, you know?

00:58:34.230 --> 00:58:37.290
&gt;&gt; The transformative
power of humor,

00:58:37.290 --> 00:58:40.860
you are a very literate
group, I wonder if any

00:58:40.860 --> 00:58:47.070
of you has a George Custer joke?

00:58:47.070 --> 00:58:50.400
&gt;&gt; Eric Gansworth: I'm not sure
it's a joke, but a major setting

00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:55.640 position:56%
for this novel that I just read from
and it's a major plot line, as well,

00:58:55.640 --> 00:58:58.030
is a stand these kids take

00:58:58.030 --> 00:59:01.450
against an ice cream stand
called Custard's Last Stand.

00:59:01.450 --> 00:59:02.750
&gt;&gt; Deborah Miranda: Do
you have a Custer joke?

00:59:02.750 --> 00:59:07.820
&gt;&gt; Stephen Graham Jones: I
don't have a Custer joke.

00:59:07.820 --> 00:59:09.730
&gt;&gt; Linda LeGarde Grover: I
don't have a Custer joke,

00:59:09.730 --> 00:59:13.350
but I did read a book about
Custer that was a big little book,

00:59:13.350 --> 00:59:15.840
does anybody know what those
are, from a long time ago

00:59:15.840 --> 00:59:18.010
and we had a box of those, too.

00:59:18.010 --> 00:59:23.260
At some point George Custer's
wife and her friends were afraid

00:59:23.260 --> 00:59:25.600
of being attacked by Indians
and somebody told them

00:59:25.600 --> 00:59:27.350
if they pretended they were drunk

00:59:27.350 --> 00:59:29.560
that the Indians were really
afraid of drunk women.

00:59:29.560 --> 00:59:35.310
I thought, well, of course.

00:59:35.310 --> 00:59:39.630 position:56%
Anyway, so I was kind of
fascinated by that part in the book.

00:59:39.630 --> 00:59:42.060
I can't help it, I
still laugh about it

00:59:42.060 --> 00:59:45.450 position:56%
and I don't know where it came from.

00:59:46.640 --> 00:59:58.130
You need to put that in something
you write, it can be true.

00:59:58.130 --> 01:00:02.430
&gt;&gt; Hi. This week begins Indigenous
Week [inaudible] events going

01:00:02.430 --> 01:00:04.440
on around the world.

01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:18.600
Do you see your writing reflecting
indigenous issues outside

01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:22.450
of the United States
[inaudible] in any kind of way

01:00:22.450 --> 01:00:24.270
or movements, indigenous people?

01:00:24.270 --> 01:00:29.090
&gt;&gt; Stephen Graham Jones: I do think
a lot of the concerns and issues

01:00:29.090 --> 01:00:32.190 position:56%
that many people face in America,
yes, I mean they're not all the same

01:00:32.190 --> 01:00:33.490
across the whole globe
I don't think,

01:00:33.490 --> 01:00:36.060
but I think some of
them are, you know?

01:00:36.060 --> 01:00:39.210
I mean appropriation, thievery,
all that stuff, you know?

01:00:39.210 --> 01:00:40.510
I think that, I mean it's
not the same everywhere,

01:00:40.510 --> 01:00:41.880
but if you reduce it to a
thumbnail enough it's probably

01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:43.180
true [inaudible].

01:00:43.180 --> 01:00:45.040
[ Inaudible ]

01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:46.840
&gt;&gt; Stephen Graham Jones:
Not intentionally for me,

01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:50.800
if it happens it's a complete
happy accident, you know?

01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:52.100
&gt;&gt; Eric Gansworth:
Well, my grandparents

01:00:52.100 --> 01:00:56.210
and their siblings all went
to Carlisle Indian School,

01:00:56.210 --> 01:01:00.640
and I have to say that in
Canada they've recognized

01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:04.760
or at least admitted that the
residential schools was cultural

01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:08.500
genocide and the United States has
refused to make that admission.

01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:12.450
So in that way my work is -
it kind of draws on that a lot

01:01:12.450 --> 01:01:18.150
and their experiences and the
ramifications I see in my family

01:01:18.150 --> 01:01:22.110
and friends from home,
two generations later.

01:01:22.110 --> 01:01:26.510
And so I think that - do I
wish the US would rise up

01:01:26.510 --> 01:01:28.510 position:56%
and actually admit that that's true?

01:01:28.510 --> 01:01:30.810
Yes.

01:01:32.310 --> 01:01:35.130
&gt;&gt; Linda LeGarde Grover: I don't
know what they would say then,

01:01:35.130 --> 01:01:36.430
what would they say next?

01:01:36.430 --> 01:01:37.730
I can't imagine that.

01:01:37.730 --> 01:01:39.030
&gt;&gt; Eric Gansworth: That's part
of the problem, there would have

01:01:39.030 --> 01:01:40.650 position:56%
to be some kind of further response.

01:01:40.650 --> 01:01:41.950
&gt;&gt; Stephen Graham Jones: Yes.

01:01:41.950 --> 01:01:43.250 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Eric Gansworth: Yes, we did that.

01:01:43.250 --> 01:01:44.550
&gt;&gt; Linda LeGarde Grover:
Yes, I know.

01:01:44.550 --> 01:01:50.860 position:56%
So I write a lot about - my research
field is affects of policies,

01:01:50.860 --> 01:01:54.630 position:56%
boarding school policies and the
boarding school era and termination,

01:01:54.630 --> 01:01:59.350
policies on individuals
and families.

01:01:59.350 --> 01:02:07.000
And so I see these kind of
the destruction of people

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:11.750
and the destruction through
policies that people invent

01:02:11.750 --> 01:02:14.090
that they say were done
with the best of intentions.

01:02:14.090 --> 01:02:17.610
I just have a really hard
time swallowing that one,

01:02:17.610 --> 01:02:21.240
and so I see that worldwide.

01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:24.160
And I parallel, when I'm
thinking of things and writing

01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:26.720
about things I often
parallel them to, well,

01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:31.510
at that point in history say
what was my grandmother doing?

01:02:31.510 --> 01:02:38.170
And I think about the terrible
destruction that has been brought

01:02:38.170 --> 01:02:41.670
and how just a regular
woman just living her life,

01:02:41.670 --> 01:02:46.000
having her children taken away
from her, and all the things.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:49.350
This isn't only my family,
its many families' stories.

01:02:49.350 --> 01:02:53.770
And so if it's many families'
stories in the world that I know,

01:02:53.770 --> 01:02:58.350
what stories are like this
worldwide, how do we keep -

01:02:58.350 --> 01:03:01.660
and I guess I can say
we, as human beings,

01:03:01.660 --> 01:03:04.310
how do we keep hurting
other people in the name

01:03:04.310 --> 01:03:11.300
of what we have decided
is a righteous thing?

01:03:11.300 --> 01:03:14.930
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of The Library of Congress.
