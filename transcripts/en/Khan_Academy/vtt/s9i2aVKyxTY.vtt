00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.280
We're asked to simplify the cube
route of 8a squared b to

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.780
the fifth c to the
third power.

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:10.720
Now the easiest way to simplify
a cubic radical like

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.660
this, where you have to find
the cube root, is to factor

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.270
this expression inside the
radical into things that are

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:19.190
perfect cubes and things
that aren't.

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:21.530
And the things that are perfect
cubes, we can just

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:25.260
take the cube roots of those and
then kind of take them out

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:25.970
of the radical.

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.070
And everything else we
can leave under it.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.110
So first let's just focus on the
8, figure out if it can be

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.280
factored into a perfect cube, or
if it maybe it's a perfect

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.470
cube itself.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.880
8 is 2 times 4.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.020
4 is 2 times 2.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.270
So 8 is 2 times 2 times 2.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.170
Or it's 2 to the third.

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.250
2 to the third is equal to 8.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.570
Or we could say that the cube
root of 8 is equal to 2.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.040
So 8 is already a nice,
perfect cube.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.600
So let's worry about this
other stuff over here.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.890
So let me rewrite the radical.

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.790
Let me rewrite the radical
over here.

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.459
I'll leave the 8 the way it is
because it's a nice, perfect

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:06.800
cube already.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.730
I'll leave the 8
the way it is.

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.110
And then, let me focus-- well,
a squared, I'm not going to

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.740
really be able to factor that
into kind of a to the third

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:15.630
times something else.

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.670
I mean I could if I wanted to
be really tricky, but I'll

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.130
just leave it as a
squared for now.

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.750
Let me do that in a
different color.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.230
So that's a squared.

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:24.750
Put a squared.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.650
b to the fifth, I can write that
as b to the third power

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:32.470
times b squared.

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.870
And that way I have a perfect
cube here and then I have

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:35.620
something that's not.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.950
But this, at least, I could
take the cube root of.

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.000
And then, c to the third.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.820
That's already a perfect cube.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.540
c to the third, the cube
root of that is c, so

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.500
times c to the third.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.750
And so we can rewrite this
expression here, just

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.400
reordering things
a little bit.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.010
This is the same thing as the
cube root of 8-- that's the

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:06.640
first term right there-- times
the cube root of b cubed times

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:12.190
the cube root of c cubed.

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.410
So, so far I've taken care
of that term, that

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:15.680
term, and that term.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.180
And these are all of the ones
that I can actually take the

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.700
cube root of.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.320
And I can leave the other two
under this larger cube root.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:29.910
So times the cube root of-- we
have our a squared here and

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.280
then our b squared.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.000
Our a squared and then we have
a b squared right here.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.830
Now, the cube root of 8 is 2.

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.050
The cube root of b to
the third is b.

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.000
Let me do it in the same colors,
makes it more visually

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.950
compelling.

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.890
Cube root of c to
the third is c.

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.890
And then this, you can't really
simplify anymore.

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.770
I mean you could kind of play
around with it, but this is

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.865
about as simplified as you can
get for this cubic radical, or

00:02:56.865 --> 00:02:59.715
this cube root radical, or this
third root, depending on

00:02:59.715 --> 00:03:00.440
how you view it.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:07.350
So, times the cube root of
a squared b squared.

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:08.910
And we're done.
