00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:02.520
- Building a fully-equipped tree house

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.670
was the highlight of Harriet's summer,

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.990
even though it got in the
way of the class trip.

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.470
So we have this pronoun it
that they're underlining,

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:12.870
and we can either not change it

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.990
or we could swap it out
for she, they, or he.

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.560
So let's think about
what it is referring to.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.950
So building a fully-equipped tree house

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:24.720
was the highlight of Harriet's summer.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.130
So what it is referring to,

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.800
even though it got in the way, what is it?

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.270
Well, it is building a
fully-equipped tree house.

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.280
This right over here is a gerund phrase.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.530
This right over here is a gerund.

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.460
It's a verb with an -ing
ending that's used as a noun.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.530
Building a fully-equipped tree house.

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:42.950
This is the thing that got in the way.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.210
And you could test it by
replacing the it with that.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.450
Even though building a
fully-equipped tree house

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:51.440
got in the way of the class trip.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.560
That's exactly what this
sentence is trying to say.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.450
So it makes sense to me that if it is

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.510
referring to something that has no gender,

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.690
like building a fully-equipped tree house,

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:03.980
and it's not plural,

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.800
then you would just want to keep it, it.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.760
You definitely wouldn't want it to be she.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.310
Building a fully-equipped tree
house is not a female gender,

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.870
it's not a male gender,
and it's not a plural.

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:16.600
So you wouldn't want say they either.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.360
So I'm definitely going with,

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.823
I'm definitely going with no change.
