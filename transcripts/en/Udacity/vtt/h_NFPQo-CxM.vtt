00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
This quiz can easily be answered if you recall our initial state diagram.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Initially, we were in the state no quote, no tag.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
If we see a beginning of a tag, we go into the no quote and tag mode.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
And in this mode, we can go into quote and tag mode, from which we exit

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
again by seeing a closely quote, and when we see the closing tag,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
we go back into the non-quote, non-tag mode.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
These are the three states that a program can be in. Which state is missing?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
The state that is missing is the state in which we would have quotes,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
but we are outside of tags.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
This is exactly the problem we would be handling in our program.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
We would take care of quotes, even outside of tags.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
This state should not be reached.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
So how can we express this with our assert statement?

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
What we want to make sure of is that this state can never be reached.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
So this is quote and not tag. The inversion of this is tag or not quote.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
You can see that either we are in non-quote mode, or if we are in quote mode

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
then we are in tag mode, and the assertion that actually checks this is this one.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
This is, therefore, the correct answer.
