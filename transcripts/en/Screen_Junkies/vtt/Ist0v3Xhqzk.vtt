00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.030
From the studio dumb enough to sell their
Marvel franchise rights to Disney

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.930
comes yet another movie that only exists to
set up The Avengers.

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:18.480
Captain America: The First Avenger

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.770
So stand tall for a superhero movie with an
important message:

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.470
It’s what’s on the inside that counts.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.140
Except for when it comes to fighting,

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.869
or being respected,

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:30.869
"Look at that.

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.250
He's making me cry."

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.250
or getting laid.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.270
"Women aren't exactly linin' up to dance with
a guy they might step on."

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.620
Meet Johnny Storm, the Human Torch --

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.590
Wait, no, that's the wrong movie.

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.980
Meet Steve Rodgers, a grown man’s head CGI’d
onto a little boy’s body.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.600
He’s a skinny kid from Brooklyn who dresses
like it’s the 1940’s.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.850
So basically a modern day kid from Brooklyn.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.210
Watch as he becomes a superhero in the most
American way possible:

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:57.210
steroids.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.890
"How do you feel?"

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:00.890
"Taller."

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:01.890
Aaaaaaabs.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.071
He’ll juice up to become Captain America,
a soldier with the powers of...

00:01:06.071 --> 00:01:09.630
Being a little bit stronger than a regular
strong guy,

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.049
Ultimate frisbee,

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:13.999
And, umm, super sobriety?

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:16.259
“I can’t get drunk”

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.090
Forget Tony’s ridiculous 3D holograms, return
to an analogue world full of

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:27.679
lever pulling,

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:30.740
switch flipping,

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:36.240
button pushing,

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.460
dial turning,

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:45.249
and people calling out percentages with absolutely
no context.

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:46.389
"That's 10%."

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:47.529
"That's 70%."

00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:48.659
"That's 50%."

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:49.659
"20%."

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:50.659
"That's 40%."

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:51.659
"60."

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:52.659
"30."

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:53.659
"60."

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:54.659
"80."

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:55.659
"40."

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:56.659
"90."

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:57.659
"That's 100%!"

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.450
Ride along with Captain America as he faces
off against the evil Red Skull,

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.750
Who along with everyone else in sci-fi and
fantasy is played by Hugo Weaving.

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.280
Cheer as the Captain defeats his legendary
arch-nemesis

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.709
in a brisk 2 minute montage.

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:14.620
All to leave more time for

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:15.620
Foreshadowing

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:16.810
The Avengers,

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.430
Introducing the plot device from

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:19.450
The Avengers,

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.010
Unnecessarily freezing himself so he can be
in

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.010
The Avengers,

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.870
And an after credits scene that is literally
a trailer for

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.769
The Avengers.

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:30.769
Starring...

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:32.530
The 90 Year Old Virgin

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.269
Tommy Lee Groans

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:37.200
One Face Two Face Red Face Ew Face

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.200
German Capote

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.370
Dr. Strangelove

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:41.819
The Winter Spoiler

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:43.379
Agent Love Interest

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:45.670
and Robert Downey Sr.

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:52.250
Captain America: The First Avenger...'s trailer.

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.760
Raiders of the Lost Ark did it better.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:55.850
Just sayin'.

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.030
Hey Screen Junkies, can't get enough of my
buttery voice?

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.670
Then check out Honest Game Trailers over on
Smosh Games.

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:17.790
How's that for a slice of fried gold?
