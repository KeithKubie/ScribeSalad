Speaker 1:          00:00          Hey everyone. I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab, the podcast. Robert and I are about to go on tour literally in a few hours to la in Seattle. Yep. But before we do, um, we leave you with a, um, well why don't you set it up? Well this is just a, one of those crazy and wonderful conversations that just popped into being. Uh, one of my favorite books of the last couple of years was a book called the age of wonder. It was written by Richard Holmes and it describes a particular group of people, a bunch of people who kind of invented modern science sort of together in the 1780s, the 1790s in the early 18 hundreds. A crazy and wonderful group. Balloonists and explorers and astronomers who believed that the world was full of miracles and surprising rules that could be detected if you looked hard and experiment an experimentation was your thing.

Speaker 2:          01:00          Anyway, I was talking to Mr. Holmes about his book and move a little to the left, why he wrote it and how it all came to being a move. That just a bit full him down and begin the conversation by mentioning somebody's name. It's Yvonne East Gullah if at least the guys was so like what happened to you? Okay. That's a great, great story. It's to do with how I fell into writing science after literature. There are various reasons for this. Um, I had it when I go a lot scientific childhood, which we weren't going to now, but in fact as a, as a kid I was fascinated by science and because of the the Wade literature literature. Yeah, the education is sort of streamed. I was taken away from that as a kid. I could build radios, I could strip motorcycle engine. Actually Modelez you were one of the things, I was one of those and I had a wonderful uncle in the Royal Air Force who taught me a lot about fight and actually I can now set once, smuggle me in to a v Boma and atomic bama.

Speaker 2:          02:02          I have to say, we didn't take over. There were bombs. It was [inaudible]. It was, it was one of those Big v bombers that could carry smuggled, doing it in a nice way as a tourist. Or he thought he was going to drop you out of state. Yeah, no, he saw it. He thought, H, here's the kid. Let's educate him. Say, took me in. He showed me how it worked. Sat me in the copilot seat. We were still on the ground. We was not. Um, and then he smuggled me out again. I've never forgotten it. It was under a coat. Now you just said it was the same as on the parkway. It was his plane after had his name on it. He was the pilot. Okay. And he's a, I denied what he said to the engineer. I would just take, take my nephew in, you know?

Speaker 2:          02:41          Yeah. So, so I had that last interview, which all began to come back when I started work on their magic scientists. I also had this amazing braking. We're getting into, everybody's got one now. I was given what they call a visiting fellowship at Trinity College, Cambridge. That's Cambridge, England. This is Newton's college or it Barron's college. It's famous for its scientists, among other things, astrophysics, particularly in mathematics. And one you're invited as a writer about poets. You've been now writing biographies and books about side. And I was meant to be doing research thing on biography, the history of bog literary biography. And what actually happened was I found these wonderful scientific archives, particularly the letters of Hash or that kept there in Cambridge. And I started reading this. He's talking about William and Caroline Herschel. This is a brother and sister team that did build big telescopes and meet all kinds of fascinating discoveries about stars and planets in those days.

Speaker 2:          03:38          And uh, and gradually I was drawn. I thought this is absolutely wonderful and there's all this, this last side of me started fading back plus, uh, at trinity there's this tradition, they talk about the high table. It's actually very democratic. You go in every evening to have a very rapid dinner, but you sit next to whoever happens to be there. There's no system of seating. Okay. So this is you and all the other teachers? This is, no, this is all the, the senior research faculty and so on. Okay. So these are people of imp, Beazer Wiki people. There were seven Nobel prize winners. Okay. And I sat next to each of them at various points. All right. And as this is one of these long tables where every plate is set that Friday and every knife is perfectly exactly right. Formal way form of silverware, jugs of water and sound.

Speaker 2:          04:29          And you talk basically the person on your left or your right and you have to talk fast because they don't, we imagine, you know, these don't sit around bruising. They don't, that I think I've really noticed the meal would probably be over in about 25 minutes. Amazing. Okay. And you talked, and once you got talking, I often never had time to finish my meal because it was, I would sit next to, I'd be next to an astrophysicist. And the famous thing I, which for me, this was something that for you at this point, like you were just laughing and he was, yes, I mean I was absolutely riveted and I found things like scientists love to discuss their science. They're very often very good at describing it, which I loved compared with some of the literary Don's you know God and you're going to literary theory and these guys want you to understand.

Speaker 2:          05:15          And I love that. On this particular occasion I sat down too next to a man who became clear a that he was Russian and he spoke no English at all. And B, that he was a mathematician. Okay. About which, you know, which I knew very little. I was trying to learn a bit to catch up with the hurdles. Very, very little. So I thought, I cannot let this pass. There's no possibility of communication, but come on. The math and common or the language. Yes. Okay. So I think about this for a moment and in studying beginning to tell you this period, I have indeed been looking at the mathematicians of this period and the French mathematicians of this period are where the cutting edge is. And there's one particular thing what the 1790 years at exactly Jim, particularly during the French revolution, right. And there's a young mathematician whose name was ever east gala, at least gala itself is music to my ears.

Speaker 2:          06:15          And, and he lived, his life was a short, as a romantic poet. He from at school, he was at least a little, the, I think got thrown out of almost every institution he was in. But he had a natural gift for mathematics, theoretical mathematics. And he also was politically rather radical. And to cut the story short in a row, I've got the exact date, but maybe about roundabout age and 20, something like that. Um, he was writing on the theory of mathematics number theory in a more advanced way than anybody could understand. He sent in papers to the academy and they were sent at the age of 19. Yes, 19 2021 he was okay. And then he was developing a theory which will come to, which he got involved in. We're not quite sure if it was a political thing, but it involved a deal he was challenged to do and we think it was over a young woman as so many Jews are, if you're 1819 or 20 and he is summoned out to have this June in the borderline and the night before this deal he sits down and he writes a mathematical paper. He puts in everything he knows into the single paper and it's very moving. I've seen the manuscript, I have some grasp of what's going on, but it's also that there are lines of poetry in it that lines, which are clearly about this girl. We don't acquire what we don't know what her name was. And the repeated thing is I have no time.

Speaker 2:          07:46          I have no time. There is no time. So he's cramming this all in until dawn. It's unbelievable situation. This paper and the math is in there too. And the masters in that too. Okay. And he, he completes the Syrian. We'll come to this in a moment. Uh, and then he goes out and he shot and he dies and this paper is left on his desk and he's a great friend, saves it. And it's published about, I think about 20 years later, the math bits or maths and the love stuff, not the love stuff. Um, and it's the beginning of a stage, a mathematical theory, which is called groups. Every group theory right now, this much I knew and very, very broadly, here's my analogy to what groups here is a very, very dangerous, uh, it's to do with certain kinds of equation. All right? That, you know those things with an equal sign and Ab and, yeah.

Speaker 2:          08:44          Okay. It involves what they call cubix. So when something has x to the power of three, it's a particular form of equation, which will, you cannot work it, it will not produce the result. It will when it's square, but not when it's cubed or when it's, what would it call four times in Sonic? So it's a temperamental, it is a temperamental equation and no mathematics and had found a way of solving it at the higher power. All right, so the analogy is it's like a box, which when it reaches a certain size, you can't act in it anymore. Okay. Now group theory will be v, this is my fashion of it, which I had vaguely come to understand. It's like you kind of open that box. So what you do is you put that box inside a bigger box and you can open the bigger box and that somehow lets you into the little one.

Speaker 2:          09:36          Oh, okay. I can't take you further than that. Okay. Right. So back to the Russian mathematician. So I turned to him as it were, with the soup thing still in my hand. And I said every gala means you just needed to start the conversations. Right. That's the only thing I could think of doing. I could just blurted out the name of a 19 year old ancient French mathematician, Nutso, ancient romantic French mathematician. I looked him dead between the eyes. I said every gala and there was a pause and to this day, this wonderful thing, he looked at me and this sort of seraphic green plastic face. And then he did this gesture, which you cannot see being radio, which is so visual, but what it is, his right hand went over his heart as if he was saluting the flag. All right. And then both hands went out, was in a big embracing gesture.

Speaker 2:          10:24          And what he was saying to me to start, it was every Skylar's so dear to my heart and to any mathematician. Alright. And then the big gesture meant he invented group theory. Okay. And then he looked at me and then the smile got bigger and then he leaned across the table and he pulled in all the Crockery, the silver water jug, the knife, the fort, the plates. And he showed me group theory of what I tried to explain to you the little box inside the big box in terms of the knife spoons, played salts, no words, no words. There was no way. I knew he was talking about groups theory and that's how he explained it to me. So if I hear the sound first of a hand gun. Yes, that's right. I hear the clanking of silver. Well, there's this wonderful gesture which can cause, right?

Speaker 2:          11:14          The broad gestures. Yes. And in wonderful way. And it's very trinity this none of the other dance turn her hair. She's dragging all the crockery over and things, you know? Yes, yes. Of course. You know, what else would we expect? And there he is explaining to and giving this model that I've tried to explain on air as the little box you can't open, you put it in a bigger box. [inaudible] position was 10 minutes long. Okay. Well it couldn't be more than 25 because the dinners never lasted more. I think that was one of the days identically I ate anything from the thing. I think I had a glass of water. Maybe I had a glass of wine probably to keep myself going. But that whole conversation took place wordlessly yes. And I say that for sort of the period of time, that 20 minutes I sort of understood group's area because he somehow, the way he did it, I thought, Oh yes.

Speaker 2:          12:05          Okay. It's that. It's that, it's that. And to me it was kind of, it was a one off. It was a sort of revelation moment really. And I thought, I love you science people that you won't, nothing will stop you. You or Jaguar going to explain this. And also I thought, you know, here I am sitting at one of the great universities with this chance to learn, okay and learn a new field and said, this guy, this wonderful rush method, he's done this to me. I am now going to, I work at this and try and produce, I know this is a big leap, but it was in my mind, I would try and write a book that was somehow do the same thing. I didn't know how the hell I'm going to do this at this time. Okay. I don't know enough sense some, but I'll work at it.

Speaker 1:          12:51          And that's how he got to right. The age of wonder, which was the best book of the year from the National Academies of science and Engineering, whatever the other one is. It's it and it's uh, is such a, Oh man. I mean, it was kind of an adventure story. It's an adventure. Great. Yeah. Anyways, so that's Richard Holmes, and I guess that's the vodcast. Uh, I'm Jad Abumrad and I'm Roberta quilvent. Thanks for listening.
