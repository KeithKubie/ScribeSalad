00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.670
And now I want to go over some
of the other core exponent

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:04.170
properties.

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.340
But they really just fall
out of what we already

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.010
know about exponents.

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.960
Let's say I have two
numbers, a and b.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.980
And I'm going to raise it to--
I could do it in the abstract.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.451
I could raise it to the c power.

00:00:17.451 --> 00:00:19.200
But I'll do it a little
bit more concrete.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.310
Let's raise it to
the fourth power.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.410
What is that going
to be equal to?

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.450
Well that's going
to be equal to-- I

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:29.110
could write it like this.

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:31.130
Copy and paste this,
copy and paste.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:40.290
That's going to be equal to
ab times ab times ab times ab

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.650
times ab.

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:45.600
But what is that equal to?

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.200
Well when you just multiply
a bunch of numbers like this

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.660
it doesn't matter what order
you're going to multiply it in.

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.060
This right over here is going
to be equivalent to a times

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.329
a times a times
a times-- We have

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:01.370
four b's as well that
we're multiplying together.

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.990
Times b times b times b times b.

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.590
And what is that equal to?

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.480
Well this right over here
is a to the fourth power.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:21.390
And this right over here
is b to the fourth power.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.860
And so you see, if you take
the product of two numbers

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.900
and you raise them
to some exponent,

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.750
that's equivalent to
taking each of the numbers

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:29.940
to that exponent.

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.580
And then taking their product.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.530
And here I just used
the example with 4,

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:41.020
but you could do this really
with any arbitrary-- actually

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.460
any exponent.

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.140
This property holds.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.850
And you could satisfy yourself
by trying different values,

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.470
and using the same
logic right over here.

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.680
But this is a general property.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.870
That-- let me
write it this way--

00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:02.125
that if I have a to
the b, to the c power,

00:02:02.125 --> 00:02:16.131
that this is going to be equal
to a to the c times b to the c

00:02:16.131 --> 00:02:16.630
power.

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.440
And we'll use this to
throughout actually

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.430
mathematics, when we try to
simplify things or rewrite

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.700
an expression in
a different way.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.880
Now let me introduce you
to another core idea here.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.480
And this is the idea of raising
something to some power.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.630
And I'll just use example of 3.

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.790
And then raising
that to some power.

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.850
What could this
be simplified as?

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.050
Well let's think about it.

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.440
This is the same thing
as a to the third--

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.300
let me copy and paste that--
as a to the third times

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.010
a to the third.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.140
And what is a to the
third times-- So this

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.390
is equal to a to the third
times a to the third.

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.750
And that's going to be equal
to a to the 3 plus 3 power.

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.760
We have the same
base, so we would add

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.210
and they're being multiplied.

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:09.690
They're being raised
to these two exponents.

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.040
So it's going to be the
sum of the exponents, which

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.700
of course is going to
be equal to a-- that's

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.530
a different color a-- it's going
to be a to the sixth power.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.130
So what just happened over here?

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.210
Well I took two a to the thirds.

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:31.600
And I multiplied them together.

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.360
So I took these two 3s
and added them together.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.200
So this essentially
right over here,

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.935
you could view
this as 2 times 3.

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.076
That's how we got the 6.

00:03:49.076 --> 00:03:50.700
When I raise something
to one exponent,

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.110
and then raised it
to another, that's

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.770
the equivalent to
raising the base

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:58.700
to the product of
those two exponents.

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.920
I just did it with this
example right over here.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.630
But I encourage you try other
numbers to see how this works.

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.850
And I could to do
this in general.

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:12.840
I could say a to the b power.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.220
And then-- let me
copy and paste that--

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.506
and then I'm going to
raise that to the c power.

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.564
Well what is that
going to give me?

00:04:26.564 --> 00:04:27.980
Well I'm essentially
going to have

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:32.994
to take c of these,
so one, two, three.

00:04:32.994 --> 00:04:34.410
I don't know how
large of a number

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.404
c is, so I'll just
do the dot, dot dot.

00:04:36.404 --> 00:04:38.780
So dot, dot, dot.

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.835
I have c of these,
right over here.

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:49.670
So what is that
going to be equal to?

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:53.650
Well that is going to be
equal to a to the-- well

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.575
for each of these
c, I'm going to have

00:04:55.575 --> 00:04:57.366
a b that I'm going
to add together.

00:04:57.366 --> 00:04:58.240
So let me write this.

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:03.110
So I'm going to have a b plus
b plus b plus dot, dot, dot

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:04.240
plus b.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.800
And now I have c
of these b's, so I

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.300
have c b's right over here.

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.530
Or you could view
this as a, this

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:18.800
is equal to a to
the c times b power.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.380
c or a, you could do
a to the cb power.

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:24.350
So very useful.

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:32.740
So if someone were to say
what is 35 to the third power,

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:37.760
and then that raised
to the seventh power?

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.264
Well this is going to
obviously be a huge number.

00:05:40.264 --> 00:05:42.180
But we could at least
simplify the expression.

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:46.840
This is going to be equal to
35 to the product of these two

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:47.820
exponents.

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:53.790
It's going to be 35 to the
3 times 7, or 35 to the 21,

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:56.529
or to the 21st power.
