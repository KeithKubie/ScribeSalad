Speaker 1:          00:00          Oh, any blinded. This is how crooked the game was. He applied it. Ali Cassius clay. So listen wasn't above, you know, cheating. Yeah. Do you remember that fighter? Oh my God, this is so frightening. He, he wrapped something in his Louie Resto. Yeah, with it cement sums junior. No, he took all the padding out of his gloves back in the day. The, they used to use horse hair with the gloves and you could, you could put a little hole in the gloves and pull the padding out. And Louie Resto, Panama Lewis was his trainer and Panama Lewis was also the same guy that gave, uh, Aaron Pryor, that little a jab of cocaine right before he knocked out Alexis Arguayo remember, I mean they think it was cocaine. He said gimme the other bottle, the one that I prepared, he gives it to Aaron Pryor. And then Aaron Pryor goes out and starches Aleks, SARC way out.

Speaker 1:          00:52          And they had a crazy war of a fight. And then he gives them something in this little bottle. And then Aaron Pryor goes out like a bat out of hell. And, and the, the question was always what was in that bottle cause there was no sophisticated drug testing back then, but Panama Louis, but there was one of them that actually puts cement or something in their gloves. Um, there was that, that was a more recent one that was a, that Mexican gentleman that fought, uh, what did he do that too? Is that the red hand? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. He doesn't isn't fight anymore. Fuck, I'm drawing a blank on his name. But he, he beat up some really prominent fighters that way.

Speaker 1:          01:33          Who the fuck did he, it was a one fight in particular. Boy, I'm seeing the guy in my face. Yes. Antonio Margarito who pull, pull up his record because he did it to, uh, he did it to some like legit fighters and uh, really beat them up and they were like, it didn't even make sense how hard he was hitting me because he, he would put plaster of Paris apparently inside the wraps and Miguel Cotto that's who it was. Right. And then Miguel Cotto beat the shit out of it. And the rematch. Shane Mosley, sugar Shane Mosley beat the fuck out of him when they found this seat. After he knocked out Miguel Cotto, we beat him up in the 11th round. He stopped him and was a horrible stoppage too. He beat the shit out of them. Then the Shane Mosley fight was the fight that he lost. That was the next fight.

Speaker 1:          02:16          And during the wrapping of the gloves, Shane Mosley's camp was go, what the fuck is in his raps? They recognized it and it had a Murray wrap his hands and then Shane Mosley beat his fucking ass and then he'd beat Robert Garcia and then Manny Pacquiao fucked him up. And then Miguel Cotto fucked him up. Um, but the Miguel Cotto fight, the first one, it was, it was bad. I mean his face was busted up and that's when people had suspicions, but they didn't know until they saw the wrapping of the gloves. And then they looked at every one of his fights before that. And then we'd go, oh, this motherfucker had plans. You go see the movie. Um, that city fat city, Stacy Keach. It's about club fighters down at Stockton, California. Fantastic movie bridges. First movies. Yeah. And John used and directed it. We one of the best fight movies ever.

Speaker 1:          03:09          This fight that I was talking about earlier, the Louie Resto fight, this Billy Collins junior guy was a, he was an up and coming contender and he was blinded in the fight and can never fight again. Wow. This kid a that he fought Louie Resto, they pulled all the padding out of the gloves and he just fucked up this guy's face to the point where, you know, I had detached retinas and he couldn't see straight came an alcoholic afterwards when you're is right there, look at his face. Wow. Yeah. And it became a, a, a really big, a big store with a deadly weapon right there, I think at the end of the other guys life or at some point he admitted that he did it. There was some documentary about it that the guide finally admitted that he was using. Oh, people have done that forever.

Speaker 1:          03:54          People have done that forever. I was sparring with a guy once and I want to touch his gloves and I was like, what the fuck is in your gloves? And His padding had all been, it was those old style old style boxing gloves. The padding little putting pushed back and it was like, it was all like almost raw knuckle people are assholes. Yeah, I've, I've experienced that before. What's interesting now is that people are actually fighting bare knuckle. There's a whole bare knuckle boxing organization out of Wyoming. Do you have all your knuckle? Yeah, they're all there. They've been single in one broken up. One note was broken. Yeah. Oh, wow. Moves Weird cliques. That was Bobby cell and he's knows Bobby Salvey. Is there a more fucking Boston named Bobby Saudi? Bobby Salvey. I fucking hit him. What a fucking over hand fucking lefty. Fuck. I went down like this.
