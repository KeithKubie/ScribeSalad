00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:11.020
- So the final keynote address--
I'll just try to glue the two--

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:14.080
the last panel
and this together.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.500
So I've seen Chris
talk in the spring

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.250
at the new aquarium about
whales and noise pollution,

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.210
and I was thinking,
how could we look at--

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.010
could protect this resource?

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.120
And I was out sea
kayaking off of Cape Cod

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.950
with one of these
VHF transceivers,

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.320
and when I get bored
when I'm sea kayaking,

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.590
I just turn it on and listen to
the chatter of what's going on.

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.212
And I heard frequently
that the Coast Guard would

00:00:41.212 --> 00:00:42.670
come on and advise
that there would

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.250
be a right whale
somewhere and would

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.299
caution mariners to stay
away from the location

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:49.090
of the right whale.

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:54.250
So they have a certain function
in protecting marine resources.

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.190
So we're lucky today to
have the Rear Admiral here,

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.640
and to introduce him
is Richard Lazarus, who

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.269
is a professor of law
here at the law school

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.880
and he specializes in
environmental and natural

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:07.881
resource law.

00:01:07.881 --> 00:01:08.380
Richard.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:09.200
- Thanks so much.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.921
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:17.410
Well, it's my great
pleasure and my honor

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.730
to introduce Rear Admiral Steven
Poulin at Harvard University

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:25.030
and welcome you here and
to the Radcliffe Institute.

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.360
Rear Admiral Poulin
assumed the duties

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:34.570
of Commander of the First Coast
Guard District in May 2016,

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.040
in that capacity overseas
11,000 active duty reserve

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.790
civilian and auxiliary personnel
who perform Coast Guard

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.860
missions across the eight
Northeastern states,

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.450
including over 2,000 miles of
coastline of the United States.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.330
He served in a variety of
legal governmental affairs

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.230
and personal operational
assignments in the Coast Guard

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.740
including command
ashore as well.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.360
He also served as
special adviser

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.240
to the vice president
of the United States,

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.340
as well as the Coast
Guard's liaison

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.450
in the State Department's
office of ocean affairs.

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.260
And with that, I welcome you.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.633
Thank you.

00:02:16.633 --> 00:02:19.591
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.210
- It's a tremendous honor
for me to be here today,

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:30.710
and I'm truly humbled that I
have the privilege of providing

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:33.830
the closing remarks for this
productive and informative

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.300
symposium.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.970
The exchange of ideas
and our dialogue

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.410
will certainly make a difference
in protecting our oceans.

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.140
Before I get started, just
because we had a kayak story,

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.390
I'd be remiss as a
Coastie if I didn't

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.110
say I hope that you wear your
personal flotation device carry

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.510
a light.

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.910
And you-- good.

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.780
Very good, very good.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.460
You know, I really
enjoy getting a chance

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:05.010
to see the posters
over the lunch break.

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.230
So I commend all the scientists
and the scholars that

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.310
did all the hard work and put
together that great research

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:14.750
and analysis.

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.480
It's truly inspiring.

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.030
As a Coast Guard officer,
I took a very keen interest

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.570
in the study concerning
ocean locomotion.

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.450
There was also a study
on the use of robotics

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.120
to aid in search and rescue.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.490
There was one presentation
on the mapping

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:34.400
of genetic resources, and I
know that's a very big issue

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.520
that we're dealing
with internationally.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.830
The rights of the
genetic resources

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:43.397
beyond national boundaries
is a very hot topic.

00:03:43.397 --> 00:03:45.230
And there were a lot
of other presentations.

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.840
I was also struck by
the great work that's

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:55.280
being done on the pressures
and impacts of ocean vortexes

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.350
on risers if I understood
the analysis correctly.

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.270
I was a incident commander
during the Deepwater Horizon

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.790
oil spill.

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.150
I was down there from the
time the Deepwater Horizon

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.880
exploded until we
turned the lights off.

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.560
At the incident
command post in Mobile,

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.110
I was responsible for
clean-up operations

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:15.020
in Mississippi, Alabama,
and the Florida panhandle,

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:20.649
so that certainly is something
that I took great interest in.

00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:22.760
I think it's
important that we all

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.850
continue to push our
thinking and our innovation

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:29.870
on ways to tackle the
stress on our oceans

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:34.130
from increased global
competition, greater

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:37.160
exploitation as well as
emerging issues such as warming

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.460
water, rising sea
levels, and pollution,

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.300
and I'll talk a little bit about
marine pollution here in a bit.

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:48.380
We must ensure that we're
good stewards of our oceans

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:53.070
and that we do all that we
can to ensure sustainability.

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.730
So I congratulate and
thank Radcliffe as well

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:57.830
for sponsoring this symposium.

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.440
It's very timely
and absolutely what

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:05.870
we need to catalyze action,
so thank you very much.

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.640
So why after a full
day of listening

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.730
to astonishingly smart
scientists and scholars

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:13.230
am I here?

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:17.490
I'm neither a scientist
nor am I an academician,

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:19.980
although I did stay at a
Holiday Inn Express last night.

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:21.150
I couldn't resist, guys.

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.070
I just couldn't resist.

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:27.870
Honestly, I am a bit
intimidated to be here in front

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.090
of such distinguished
scientists and scholars

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:33.839
because I got a D in
calculus, and that's

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:35.880
one of the reasons I
decided to go to law school.

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.280
I knew I would never
have to calculate

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.151
the area under a curve
in practicing law.

00:05:42.151 --> 00:05:44.400
The good thing about being
a lawyer in the Coast Guard

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.070
is that we're all line officers
unlike the other military

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:49.350
services, so we
get the opportunity

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:52.530
to get out to the field
and do hands-on Coast Guard

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:57.060
operations, which is what brings
me to Boston as you heard.

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.370
What brings me to the
Radcliffe Institute

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:03.840
here today is my hope that I can
provide some context, perhaps

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.260
even a new perspective on
the need for cooperation

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.140
and collaboration in
protecting our oceans.

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:12.600
My further hope is that
I can share some insights

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:18.510
on how we as a community can
collectively manage the oceans.

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:20.400
Just to set the
framework, I believe

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.390
that the key is committed
partnership and cooperation.

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:28.500
The pillars of this effort must
include individuals, industry,

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:33.270
science, academia,
governments of all echelons,

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:34.740
and non-governmental
organizations.

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.470
All of these will
play an essential role

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:40.080
in ensuring the
vitality of our oceans.

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:43.860
The Coast Guard is a
nation's federal Maritime law

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:48.810
enforcement agency, we're an
Environmental Protection Agency

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:52.140
and we're the nation's
Maritime first responder.

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:55.170
We also safeguard and facilitate
safe Maritime commerce

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:56.370
and Maritime activity.

00:06:56.370 --> 00:07:00.360
Obviously then, changes
in the ocean environment,

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:04.501
changes in climate patterns
are of great interest to us.

00:07:04.501 --> 00:07:06.750
We need to be agile enough
to adjust to these changing

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:10.590
conditions to continue to
do what America expects

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:13.140
of its Coast Guard, and
I should say what America

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:18.120
expects of your Coast Guard.

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.468
So I'm going to ask
your indulgence first.

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:27.720
It helped me give you a
thumbnail sketch of the Coast

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:29.100
Guard.

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:31.560
I find that most people know
a little bit about the Coast

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:34.380
Guard because of such
personal interaction,

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:38.400
but perhaps you don't know the
comprehensive picture of all

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:41.850
that we do as an organization.

00:07:41.850 --> 00:07:44.340
The Coast Guard is
a military service.

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:47.880
We reside in the Department
of Homeland Security.

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:51.290
This is a snapshot
of our workforce.

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:53.940
41,000 active duty
personnel, which

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:58.320
is just a little bit larger
than the New York City Police

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:00.580
Department if you
can believe it.

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:03.660
And then we have 8,000 members
of the federal civilian

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:06.270
service, and I'm very thankful
that we have the surge

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:08.940
capacity of 7,000
reservists who have

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:12.930
the status of reserve members
of the other military services.

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:16.260
And we have 30,000
civilian volunteers

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:17.330
who we call auxiliarists.

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:20.850
You saw one earlier today asking
a question in this full Coast

00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:25.290
Guard regalia, so it
was neat to see that.

00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:26.950
I should also say
that we're hiring.

00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:31.290
So if you want to enlist,
please come up and see me.

00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:34.140
I know it's a shameless plug,
but I'd be remiss as a Coastie

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:37.750
if I didn't ask you to join up.

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:41.062
And as you can see, our core
mission is making pizza.

00:08:41.062 --> 00:08:43.422
[LAUGHING]

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:52.500
As much as we like pizza, our
core responsibility in reality

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:55.080
is to ensure
America's sovereignty

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:58.230
along 95,000 miles of US
shoreline and the associated

00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:00.360
territorial sea, as well
as to protect America's

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:04.110
sovereign rights throughout
that 3.4 million miles

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:06.160
of our exclusive economic zone.

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:07.830
While our name
Coast Guard suggests

00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:09.990
that we operate
in the littorals,

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:12.090
it's somewhat of a misnomer.

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:16.110
We are globally deployed and
we operate as far out to sea

00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:17.700
as possible.

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:21.900
When it comes to intercepting
threats to America's homeland,

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:24.450
we want to play an away game.

00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:27.420
We don't want to play
goal line defense.

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:29.760
When it comes to
Maritime threats

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:32.010
and transnational
organized crime,

00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:37.810
we intend and we do project
effective presence offshore.

00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:39.570
Now we have 11
statutory missions,

00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:41.820
and it would take me
all of my allotted time

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:44.640
to discuss the parameters
of each of those missions

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:45.990
with you.

00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:48.090
I think it's better
that I just sort of

00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:52.310
give you a summary
of what we do.

00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:55.230
And here it is broken down
into three general categories--

00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:59.340
Maritime safety, security,
and Maritime stewardship.

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:02.000
But even those are hard
to get your arms around,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.640
so what I like to say
is we protect America

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:10.320
from threats delivered by sea,
we protect those on the sea,

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.820
and that we protect
the sea itself.

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:15.210
I think that's a much more
understandable way of knowing

00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:17.790
the Coast Guard and what we do.

00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:23.110
It's that third mission
that I want to talk mostly

00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:27.220
about today, and that is
Maritime stewardship--

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:30.550
protecting the sea itself.

00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:32.830
And when I talk about
Maritime stewardship,

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:35.620
I'm talking about marine
environmental protection

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:38.140
and I'm talking about
our responsibilities

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:39.802
for living marine
resource enforcement.

00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:48.600
Now I bared my soul to you about
my lack of scientific prowess,

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:51.640
and I'm going to step carefully
into some scientific data

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:54.310
that I feel is very compelling.

00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:55.450
Now it's not my work.

00:10:55.450 --> 00:11:00.010
If it were my work, it would
be D quality as we all know.

00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:02.950
And I think the prior
panel did a much better job

00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:05.860
than I could ever dream of doing
in talking about what we're

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:07.810
seeing up here in New
England with respect

00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:13.804
to migration of fisheries
and warming ocean trends,

00:11:13.804 --> 00:11:15.220
but it's in my
slide presentation.

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:17.590
I'm going to do it anyway.

00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:18.670
This is not my data.

00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:22.530
The credit goes to Pinsky
Lab at Rutgers University.

00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:24.940
It goes to Noah's National
Marine Fisheries Service,

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:27.231
the Connecticut Department
of Environmental Protection,

00:11:27.231 --> 00:11:29.470
and the Millstone
Nuclear Power Plant.

00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:32.984
The first data set that you see
is from Connecticut Department

00:11:32.984 --> 00:11:34.150
of Environmental Protection.

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:36.525
It reflects their analysis of
temperatures on Long Island

00:11:36.525 --> 00:11:38.830
Sound, and these
are temperatures

00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:41.260
that were reported by the
Millstone Nuclear Power

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:41.760
Station.

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:44.470
Regulations require them
to report temperatures

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:49.750
twice daily, and this is
the trend from 1976 to 2015.

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:55.437
And I know again this is maybe
a difficult curve to read,

00:11:55.437 --> 00:11:56.520
but what it shows is this.

00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:59.260
The blue lines starts at
76 and go through 2015.

00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.710
The green line, which is above
the bell curve of the blue,

00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:05.592
is reflecting
temperatures of 2012.

00:12:05.592 --> 00:12:07.300
And then the red bell
curve is reflecting

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:10.690
the 2015 temperatures that
started lower, but then went

00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:11.620
higher.

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:13.960
In essence, what
this graph shows

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:16.210
is empirical data that
water temperature trends

00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:18.550
in Long Island Sound
are getting warmer,

00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:23.305
or is in 2015 experiencing
lower lows but higher highs.

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:29.260
The next slide shows the
changing distribution

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:30.880
of lobsters over
time, and I think

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:33.130
it validates the temperature
readings from Long Island

00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:33.760
Sound.

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:36.120
And I think it also validates
what you heard earlier.

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:38.320
The Pinsky Lab at
Rutgers analyzed data

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:39.940
that NOAA's National
Marine Fisheries

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:42.060
Service had been
collecting for years,

00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:44.110
and I believe these results
were quite traumatic

00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:45.234
when you look at the trend.

00:12:45.234 --> 00:12:48.940
The red reflects the
higher density of lobster,

00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:50.980
and the blue are
lower density looking

00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:54.810
at the comparison between the
'70s to the '90s, to 2015.

00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:57.490
I think it's clear that
the lobsters are migrating

00:12:57.490 --> 00:12:59.410
North and East in general.

00:12:59.410 --> 00:13:02.650
And as I understand it, the
current scientific explanation

00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:05.920
is that lobsters are moving
to remain in colder water

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:08.040
as that water trends North.

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:10.660
And just as another
data point perhaps,

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:13.930
Connecticut used to land about
3.7 million pounds of lobster

00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:18.130
a year, worth about
$12 million in 1990.

00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:19.840
But in 2014, that
amount diminished

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:23.350
to about 127,000 pounds.

00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:27.280
Now to show you that this isn't
just about lobster as we heard

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:30.370
earlier, this is also about
trends in other species

00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:32.080
such as black sea bass.

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:34.120
This shows the movement
from Maryland, Delaware

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:37.150
starting in the '70s,
steadily moving northward

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:40.510
up into New England by 2015.

00:13:40.510 --> 00:13:42.096
Again, the point
is that marine life

00:13:42.096 --> 00:13:43.720
is adapting to ocean
temperature change

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:48.356
by migrating North and East
to remain in cold water.

00:13:48.356 --> 00:13:50.980
Now one of the other reasons why
I wanted to show you this data

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:54.610
was not so much to show
you the trends-- as I said,

00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:57.130
others could do that
much better than I.

00:13:57.130 --> 00:13:59.770
But it's to reinforce the
point that partnership

00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:02.860
and collaboration is essential
because this data was

00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:06.910
assembled, compiled, and
represented by the great work

00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:10.360
and collaboration of
industry, state, academia,

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:12.010
and federal agencies.

00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:17.410
The sharing of scientific
study, data, and information

00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:19.180
is a critically
important element

00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:21.220
in managing our ocean resources.

00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:25.090
Sharing information will
always have a unifying effect

00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:27.100
that I think will promote
a common understanding

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:30.040
of the challenges and
trends in the oceans.

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:32.110
They'll forge
consensus on solutions

00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:37.180
and allow us to assess and
forecast effectiveness.

00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:40.480
Now I understand the
sharing of technology,

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:43.030
the sharing of
proprietary information,

00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:46.210
sharing of intellectual
property is a sensitive issue.

00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:48.460
That's not what I'm advocating.

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:50.650
What I'm advocating
is that we maximize

00:14:50.650 --> 00:14:54.280
our shared learning and our
understanding of ocean science.

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:58.240
That we seek to expand
our circle of discussions

00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:00.160
that engage the broad
set of stakeholders

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:01.560
that I mentioned earlier.

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:05.140
Frankly to me as a layman,
there are disparate views

00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:09.130
among stakeholder groups
as to the nature and extent

00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:11.350
of the stress on
our oceans, which

00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:14.384
also leads to disparate
views on solutions.

00:15:14.384 --> 00:15:16.300
I think expanding
information and sharing will

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:19.740
build confidence and consensus.

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:22.320
I was in St. John's,
Newfoundland,

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:24.235
this week to talk
about Maritime safety

00:15:24.235 --> 00:15:25.360
and security in the Arctic.

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:28.820
It was a symposium that brought
together industry, academia,

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:31.420
and governments to talk
about how we improve safety,

00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:33.220
security, and
environmental preparedness

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:35.830
and response in the Arctic.

00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:39.660
The Arctic's a strategic
imperative for many nations,

00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:41.410
so there has been much
study and attention

00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:43.360
paid to it in recent
years, especially

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:45.400
over the past decade.

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:47.410
What I found refreshing
about that symposium

00:15:47.410 --> 00:15:50.020
was that all of us
who spoke had a shared

00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:53.330
understanding of the
problem set in the Arctic.

00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:57.860
The rising sea levels,
the loss of permafrost,

00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:00.620
increased shipping and
other man-made activity,

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:03.290
remoteness and the
tyranny of distance,

00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:05.420
and the lack of infrastructure.

00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:07.460
Our shared understanding
of the problem

00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:12.110
allowed us to then focus our
energy on discussing solutions.

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:16.070
For the Coast Guard, we followed
President Obama's lead in 2013

00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:19.460
and published our own
supporting Arctic strategy

00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:21.410
and implementation plan.

00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:25.790
Our strategic objectives in the
Arctic, which is ocean space,

00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:29.780
is first to improve our
awareness of all the activity

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:33.030
both man-made and natural that
is occurring in the Arctic.

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:35.390
To modernize governance,
which I think in part

00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:38.710
is to ensure that we can
project an effective presence

00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:40.530
in that part of the world.

00:16:40.530 --> 00:16:42.837
The Arctic is not a new
operating environment

00:16:42.837 --> 00:16:43.670
for the Coast Guard.

00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:47.000
We have been up there off Alaska
since Alaska was a territory.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.750
But as we know, the
challenges are growing

00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:52.940
and the need for a Coast
Guard presence is growing,

00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:55.940
and we must be able to
modernize our governance.

00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:58.730
And the last underscores
the point and the theme

00:16:58.730 --> 00:17:00.920
of my discussion
here, and that is we

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:04.770
need to broaden partnerships.

00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:09.079
Now our Coast Guard motto is,
"Semper paratus," always ready.

00:17:09.079 --> 00:17:11.240
And in order to maintain
that high standard,

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:13.319
it's important that
we work with others.

00:17:13.319 --> 00:17:15.680
And in today's world of
constrained resources

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:18.380
and rapidly shifting
complex matters,

00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:20.460
the Coast Guard simply
can't do it alone.

00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:23.220
Ensuring safety, security,
and environmental responsible

00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:26.790
maritime commerce and
activity are important goals,

00:17:26.790 --> 00:17:30.960
but it's not solely a
Coast Guard responsibility.

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:33.960
It's a shared responsibility
for all of us.

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:35.690
We have to all
recognize that we are

00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:39.890
actors in the continuum of
actions related to the ocean.

00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:42.890
Take for example the
movement of the vessel.

00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:45.650
I view this as a continuum
of critical linkages

00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:48.380
that involves the shipping
company, shippers,

00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:52.204
Maritime agents and insurers,
the crews, and the government.

00:17:52.204 --> 00:17:53.870
There are many more
actors in the chain,

00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:57.920
but I just wanted to give you--
sort of paint a picture for you

00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:01.100
by highlighting a few of what
I consider the key actors.

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:03.780
Each element in the chain
is a critical link that

00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:06.810
has an important role to play.

00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:08.810
Now if you noticed,
I put governments

00:18:08.810 --> 00:18:12.170
at the end of that chain
because while I believe

00:18:12.170 --> 00:18:15.800
government oversight
is important,

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:19.850
it should not be viewed as the
primary means of compliance

00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:21.440
to sound Maritime practice.

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:25.910
Governments cannot be seen as
guarantors of safety, security,

00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:29.600
and stewardship because frankly
the chain is just too big

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:31.370
and it's too long.

00:18:31.370 --> 00:18:32.940
We must rely on the
greater guarantee

00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:37.669
that each link in the
chain will do its part.

00:18:37.669 --> 00:18:39.210
We need to rely on
shipping companies

00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:41.570
to put in place good
business practices

00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:44.840
and have robust compliance and
oversight programs themselves.

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:47.400
Crews must be well-trained
and they must understand

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:49.070
the responsibilities.

00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:51.570
They need be empowered by their
companies and their officers

00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:54.110
to take action, to
mitigate safety, security,

00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:56.280
and environmental
risks, including

00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:59.250
being empowered to come forward
and report discrepancies

00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:00.750
and violations.

00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:03.110
And absolutely yes,
governments need

00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:07.160
to fulfill their obligations
as flag states, coastal states,

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:09.000
and port states.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.650
This continuum needs to
be a culture of shared

00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:17.780
responsibility, and I think
that shared responsibility

00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:21.860
is made easier the more we
collaborate and exchange

00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:25.272
information and best practices.

00:19:25.272 --> 00:19:27.480
Let me turn to marine
environmental protection, which

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:30.630
is perhaps the most visible
and obvious area where we

00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:32.760
have a shared responsibility.

00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:34.670
Preservation of our
oceans means that we

00:19:34.670 --> 00:19:36.990
must tackle persistent
noncompliance

00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:39.270
with pollution prevention laws.

00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:43.640
In 2014, we investigated over
3,600 pollution incidents

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:47.630
in our navigable
waterways-- 3,600.

00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:51.350
We conducted more than
25,000 inspections

00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:53.460
on hazardous
materials containers,

00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:55.560
and we found over
5,000 discrepancies

00:19:55.560 --> 00:20:00.080
that if left uncorrected could
have impacted our waterways.

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:02.520
And we also continue
to find vessels

00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:05.330
intentionally disabling or
bypassing required pollution

00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:07.400
prevention equipment.

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:11.540
And frankly, this
issue confounds me.

00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:14.210
Now criminal referrals
vary from year to year,

00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:18.210
but overall we have not
seen a decrease over time.

00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:21.080
In 2015, we had 16
criminal referrals

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:24.410
for environmental
violations and we

00:20:24.410 --> 00:20:26.840
save those criminal referrals
for the most egregious

00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:32.780
of cases, and that was up from
15 referrals a year before.

00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:36.480
When we do the math,
only about 0.15%

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:39.540
of all compliance boardings
lead to criminal referral so let

00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:40.420
me be clear.

00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:43.790
I think that the vast
majority of Maritime industry

00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:46.166
are good environmental
stewards and they're

00:20:46.166 --> 00:20:47.790
serious about
environmental compliance.

00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:51.000
I'm not here to suggest
otherwise-- far from it.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.700
I've seen vast improvements
across the spectrum

00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:57.570
of the Maritime sector, but
it's an unfortunate reality

00:20:57.570 --> 00:21:00.320
that some companies
and some individuals

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:02.030
are unwilling to comply.

00:21:04.550 --> 00:21:07.070
And I said this is an important
responsibility to the Coast

00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:07.570
Guard.

00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:08.930
We cannot do it alone.

00:21:08.930 --> 00:21:12.030
We count on the
committed support

00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:14.090
from other criminal
investigators

00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:15.650
and also the
Department of Justice

00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:17.570
who litigate these cases for us.

00:21:17.570 --> 00:21:20.380
Now I was part of the early
efforts in the Coast Guard

00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:23.040
where we tried to spur greater
environmental compliance

00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:25.500
through launching
criminal referrals.

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:29.660
Before that, we relied mainly
on administrative sanctions

00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:31.130
and other measures.

00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:34.500
And we thought that it would
be a temporary program.

00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:37.550
Well, much to my regret, we're
still in this line of business

00:21:37.550 --> 00:21:39.369
and I don't want to be.

00:21:39.369 --> 00:21:41.160
We're seeing time and
time again that we're

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:42.950
referring the same
kinds of cases

00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:47.450
to the Department of
Justice for criminal action,

00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:52.220
and it's the same pattern--
dumping oil, falsifying record

00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:55.790
books, and lying
to the Coast Guard,

00:21:55.790 --> 00:21:58.340
and encouraging others
to lie to us as well.

00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:00.330
It just doesn't make
sense in my mind

00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:02.900
why there is still a
subculture of noncompliance

00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:05.570
in some segments in
the Maritime industry.

00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:07.980
I don't know why people,
companies would put themselves

00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:09.800
at risk and my
crew members would

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:12.110
put their own liberty at risk.

00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:15.050
Now I appreciate that the
reasons for non-compliance

00:22:15.050 --> 00:22:18.140
could be complex.

00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:21.540
But since the 1990s when
we launched this program,

00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:23.900
companies have paid
over $330 million

00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:27.290
in vessel pollution fines.

00:22:27.290 --> 00:22:30.620
We banned vessels from calling
at United States ports.

00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:33.597
People have gone to prison.

00:22:33.597 --> 00:22:35.930
Companies have had to implement
environmental compliance

00:22:35.930 --> 00:22:40.430
programs, they've had to do
audits, there are legal fees.

00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:43.130
There are significant costs
associated with noncompliance,

00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:46.640
yet again we aren't seeing
a decrease in referrals.

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:49.287
So let me be clear-- we
have a continuing problem.

00:22:49.287 --> 00:22:50.870
But I think it's
also clear that if we

00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:54.110
meet our responsibilities--
that shared responsibility--

00:22:54.110 --> 00:22:57.780
and each part of that continuum
of compliance does its part,

00:22:57.780 --> 00:23:01.580
we can change the subculture.

00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:04.500
Now you may ask, what can I do?

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:06.050
I'm not in the
shipping industry.

00:23:06.050 --> 00:23:07.460
I'm not an enforcement agency.

00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:09.590
How is this relevant to me?

00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:13.610
Well, I think we must
continue to rely on science

00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:16.590
and we have to rely on
academia to help us develop

00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:19.770
the technologies, the
processes, and protocols to help

00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:21.190
meet environmental standards.

00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:23.360
And I could give
you a full array

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:25.770
of examples when I'm just
going to give you a few

00:23:25.770 --> 00:23:27.800
to highlight my point.

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:31.230
The first is we need to develop
good oil spill detection

00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:33.320
technology.

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:36.540
We need to stimulate
oil spill technologies--

00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:38.660
oil spill cleanup
technologies especially

00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:42.440
to address heavy oils
that sink and not flow.

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:43.980
We need technologies
to neutralize

00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:45.950
aquatic nuisance species.

00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:49.550
We need capabilities to expand
our Maritime domain awareness.

00:23:49.550 --> 00:23:51.540
And we need metrics
for assessing

00:23:51.540 --> 00:23:57.030
the effectiveness of enforcement
on preserving the biomass.

00:23:57.030 --> 00:24:00.230
Now my hope again is that we'll
close this line of business,

00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:03.030
but the only way we can
do that is with your help.

00:24:03.030 --> 00:24:05.020
and with that shared
responsibility

00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:07.250
that I mentioned.

00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:09.480
Protecting and sustaining
living marine resources,

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:13.730
or more commonly what we call
fisheries, is a global concern.

00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:15.620
We face multiple
challenges in our fight

00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:18.410
to ensure sustainable
fish stocks.

00:24:18.410 --> 00:24:21.347
We've heard throughout this
symposium about trends,

00:24:21.347 --> 00:24:23.180
we've heard about the
migration, we've heard

00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:25.530
about diminishing fish stocks.

00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:29.780
Frankly, part of the problem
is us, the global population

00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:30.830
that consumes fish.

00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:33.540
The demand for
protein's growing.

00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:36.347
It will continue to grow
geometrically, I suspect.

00:24:36.347 --> 00:24:38.180
More than three billion
people, many of whom

00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:40.250
live in the least
developed countries,

00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:43.340
rely on food from the ocean as
their most significant source

00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:43.880
of protein.

00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:46.940
And more than 50 million people
worldwide make their living

00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:49.250
based on the fishing industry.

00:24:49.250 --> 00:24:51.360
And again, I believe the
vast majority of those

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:54.050
are good stewards and want a
sustainable fishery to maintain

00:24:54.050 --> 00:24:55.710
their quality of life.

00:24:55.710 --> 00:24:59.280
However, even here
we're seeing significant

00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:04.600
noncompliance, predominantly
illegal, unreported,

00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:05.600
and unregulated fishing.

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:07.730
Known as IUU fishing.

00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:11.660
And according to the UNFAO,
the Food and Agricultural

00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:14.930
Organization, about 15% to
30% of global annual catches

00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:17.180
are the result of IUU fishing.

00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:20.040
And it presents a direct
threat a direct threat

00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:23.430
to not only global economies,
but I think global stability.

00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:25.430
And we're at the forefront
of this challenge.

00:25:25.430 --> 00:25:27.590
We're trying to meet
it head on here,

00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:30.764
not only projecting our
own presence as we do here

00:25:30.764 --> 00:25:32.180
in the First Coast
Guard district,

00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:33.780
but also working
with our partners

00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:35.738
and through the various
international fisheries

00:25:35.738 --> 00:25:36.589
organizations.

00:25:36.589 --> 00:25:38.130
As we say in the
Coast Guard, we want

00:25:38.130 --> 00:25:41.250
to take a round turn on this
problem and get ahead of it,

00:25:41.250 --> 00:25:43.880
but we can only do that
with a committed support

00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:46.814
of our partners.

00:25:46.814 --> 00:25:48.230
The other thing
that we need to do

00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:51.830
is we need to rely on our
scientists and our academicians

00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:55.980
and our scholars to help
us better project trends.

00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:58.130
We need to better
target our resources

00:25:58.130 --> 00:26:00.000
for fisheries enforcement.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.660
We can't afford to
simply turn a screw

00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:03.930
and punch holes in the ocean.

00:26:03.930 --> 00:26:07.140
We need to do targeted
enforcement because resources

00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:10.300
are limited, and
we need your help

00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:12.750
in defining those
metrics so that we

00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:16.260
know that we're putting
effective resources on top

00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:20.655
of the problem to ensure that
we have sustainable fish stocks.

00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:26.420
Now part of "Semper paratus,"
our motto, "Always ready,"

00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:28.830
means that we have to
take a hard look at what's

00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:31.870
coming at us in the future.

00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:34.294
And of course, we're very
mindful of the trends

00:26:34.294 --> 00:26:35.960
that we're seeing in
the Maritime domain

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:39.440
through climate change
rising sea levels.

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:41.850
We're the Maritime
first responder agency,

00:26:41.850 --> 00:26:44.420
so of course we are very
concerned about what

00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:47.760
the effects will be
on storm predictions,

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:52.670
and the severity in number of
storms we may see in the future

00:26:52.670 --> 00:26:54.230
because part of
our responsibility

00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:56.521
is ensuring the resiliency
of the marine transportation

00:26:56.521 --> 00:26:57.470
system.

00:26:57.470 --> 00:26:59.450
But we are the Coast Guard.

00:26:59.450 --> 00:27:01.310
We operate and
live on the coast.

00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:02.500
Our units are on the coast.

00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:05.150
Our infrastructure
is on the coast.

00:27:05.150 --> 00:27:10.130
And I recall a discussion that
I heard our commandant, Admiral

00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:11.760
Zukunft, talked about recently.

00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:13.940
He was talking about
his recent visit

00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:17.180
to Greenland with
Jakobshavn Glacier,

00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:20.300
and he talked about how
that glacier has receded

00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:24.000
25 miles in only the past five
years and the dire predictions

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.780
that sea level could
rise up to 2 meters.

00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:32.010
And then he also talked about
the National Snow and Ice Data

00:27:32.010 --> 00:27:34.700
Center in NASA's announcement
that Arctic sea ice

00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:37.560
set a record low in March
for the lowest winter maximum

00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:39.470
in the satellite record.

00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:42.540
And while the lowest maximum
winter doesn't necessarily

00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:45.170
mean we're going to see the
lowest minimum in summer,

00:27:45.170 --> 00:27:47.660
it certainly doesn't bode well.

00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:50.120
The trend's becoming more
and more clear I think,

00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:52.260
and we are taking note of it.

00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:56.150
So it goes beyond just the
impact of warming oceans,

00:27:56.150 --> 00:28:00.830
on fisheries, and the trends
of migrating fish stocks.

00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:04.190
It goes beyond the displacement
of indigenous populations

00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:10.550
in Alaska which rely on Coast
Guard support and protection.

00:28:10.550 --> 00:28:13.290
It goes beyond what we're
seeing with some Pacific Island

00:28:13.290 --> 00:28:13.970
nations.

00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:17.190
Fundamentally, it goes to the
Coast Guard's ability to remain

00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:19.070
"Semper paratus"--
always ready--

00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:22.640
to respond to emerging threats
as we see sea levels rise

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:27.060
and encroach upon our
critical infrastructure.

00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:32.120
So we are very much focused
on planning forward.

00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:35.570
Now this is somewhat
of an eye chart here

00:28:35.570 --> 00:28:38.220
and it's not my intent
to have you read it all.

00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:40.310
It's simply my
intent to give you

00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:44.120
a snapshot of what
Maritime activity looks

00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:46.670
like in part of my
area of responsibility

00:28:46.670 --> 00:28:48.950
here up in the Northeast.

00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:53.660
These are competing, often
conflicting and overlapping

00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:58.310
waterways uses, and it
creates a real conundrum

00:28:58.310 --> 00:29:03.560
on how you make sure that the
waterways remain safe with all

00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:07.250
of this growing complexity.

00:29:07.250 --> 00:29:09.600
And frankly, one
of the ways we're

00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:11.430
trying to address
this complexity

00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:13.370
is through the
Northeast Regional Ocean

00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:15.880
Council, or NROC for short.

00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:18.710
The group was formed
over a decade ago in 2005

00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:22.700
by the New England
governors who then invited

00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:25.379
federal agencies that
have particular expertise

00:29:25.379 --> 00:29:27.170
and relevant authority
like the Coast Guard

00:29:27.170 --> 00:29:30.270
to come together to discuss
these regional ocean issues.

00:29:30.270 --> 00:29:33.290
And again, it was
prompted by the complexity

00:29:33.290 --> 00:29:35.671
of a very dynamic
operating environment.

00:29:39.650 --> 00:29:44.870
As I said, quite a
conundrum for us.

00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:46.820
Again, another eye
chart and I apologize.

00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:50.090
This is a snapshot of
the kind of complexity

00:29:50.090 --> 00:29:52.550
in the offshore environment.

00:29:52.550 --> 00:29:58.100
The NROC did a great job in
launching a data portal that

00:29:58.100 --> 00:30:01.880
provides access to critical
information for agencies

00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:04.880
and stakeholders such as us
to better plan and execute

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:06.440
our responsibilities.

00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:10.756
This happens to show the portal
for the offshore environment.

00:30:13.530 --> 00:30:16.689
Again, another snapshot
from the portal on what

00:30:16.689 --> 00:30:17.730
traffic trends look like.

00:30:17.730 --> 00:30:23.330
In the previous panel, it showed
sort of global traffic trends.

00:30:23.330 --> 00:30:26.040
This kind of data--
this sharing of data,

00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:28.640
this sharing of
information helps us better

00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:31.250
plan and allocate our resources.

00:30:31.250 --> 00:30:33.710
We need to stay ahead of the
power curve, and the best way

00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:37.670
to do that is to have good,
solid, sound scientific data

00:30:37.670 --> 00:30:44.360
to stand behind as we allocate
those scarce resources.

00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:45.890
And the federal
government finally

00:30:45.890 --> 00:30:48.500
caught up with the
New England governors

00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:50.630
and a presidential
executive order

00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:53.750
was issued to establish both
the national ocean council

00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:56.210
and regional advisory councils.

00:30:56.210 --> 00:30:58.790
The one for New England here is
called the Northeast Regional

00:30:58.790 --> 00:31:00.000
Planning Body.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.910
Since the NROC was
already established,

00:31:01.910 --> 00:31:04.770
the NROC basically was
leveraged as the entity

00:31:04.770 --> 00:31:08.590
to meet that presidential
directive and the entity

00:31:08.590 --> 00:31:11.860
to develop the
Northeast ocean plan.

00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:14.560
It was due in large part
to the NROC's existence

00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:16.940
that New England was the
first region in the nation

00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:20.140
to respond to a presidential
executive order.

00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:22.910
And this Northeast
ocean plan is meant

00:31:22.910 --> 00:31:25.730
to strengthen inter-agency
coordination while enhancing

00:31:25.730 --> 00:31:27.850
the public's ability
to participate

00:31:27.850 --> 00:31:29.540
in the process of
managing resources.

00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:31.810
It doesn't dictate the
way we're going to do it,

00:31:31.810 --> 00:31:34.360
but what it does is
it sets up a framework

00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:37.700
to ensure collaboration
and improve transparency

00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:41.720
so that we are making the
best decisions possible.

00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:44.630
So the NROC and the
Northeast ocean plan

00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:46.640
sets up that framework
for stakeholders

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:51.000
to better plan and
ensure safety, security,

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.030
environmental
protection in the area.

00:31:53.030 --> 00:31:55.900
But we know that oceans
don't stop at state, local,

00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:57.950
or national
boundaries, and I don't

00:31:57.950 --> 00:32:03.770
think any symposium on the
oceans-- certainly not one

00:32:03.770 --> 00:32:09.740
from sea to changing sea or a
presentation like this titled

00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:12.910
"Future of the Oceans" would be
complete without a discussion

00:32:12.910 --> 00:32:16.300
of the 1982 Law of
the Sea Convention.

00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:18.230
I've got a number of
notes here, and I'm just

00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:19.910
going to sort of
ad lib a little bit

00:32:19.910 --> 00:32:24.260
because I've lived
this issue ever

00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:27.850
since I've been a lawyer
in the Coast Guard.

00:32:27.850 --> 00:32:31.390
Many of you know that
the United States is not

00:32:31.390 --> 00:32:34.660
a party to the 1982 Law
of the Sea Convention.

00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:37.870
The United States was the
catalyst for that negotiation

00:32:37.870 --> 00:32:40.460
of that 1982 convention.

00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:43.120
We were dissatisfied
with the 58 conventions.

00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:44.920
They were good, but
they left many gaps

00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:46.174
that needed to be addressed.

00:32:46.174 --> 00:32:47.590
One of the most
important of which

00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:49.430
was the breadth of
the territorial sea.

00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:51.170
The other was the
rights and obligations

00:32:51.170 --> 00:32:53.560
in the exclusive
economic zone, and issues

00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:55.220
like how do you claim
sovereign rights

00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:56.678
over an extended
continental shelf.

00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:04.970
For most of the convention, it
was considered a huge victory

00:33:04.970 --> 00:33:06.710
for the United States.

00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:08.450
There were some
serious deficiencies

00:33:08.450 --> 00:33:11.320
in what's called Part 11 of the
original agreement, the Deep

00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:13.370
Sea Mining Provisions.

00:33:13.370 --> 00:33:15.940
There were forced
technology provisions.

00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:18.470
President Reagan
was not satisfied

00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:21.530
that the size of the
international seabed authority,

00:33:21.530 --> 00:33:25.760
both its size and the authority
to act would be kept in check.

00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:29.990
So in 1994, we were able to
conclude a separate agreement

00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:33.980
on Part 11 that fixed all
the issues that President

00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:35.510
Reagan was concerned about.

00:33:35.510 --> 00:33:37.730
Now keep in mind those
were only very narrow

00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:41.840
issues that moved the United
States away from signing

00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:43.390
the convention at that point.

00:33:43.390 --> 00:33:47.440
Those issues were fixed in
'94, but despite the fact

00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:49.490
that those were
addressed, we still

00:33:49.490 --> 00:33:52.570
have not been able to get this
convention over the finish

00:33:52.570 --> 00:33:54.070
line.

00:33:54.070 --> 00:34:01.390
The convention has 166 countries
including the European Union.

00:34:01.390 --> 00:34:05.380
Yet, we've not yet ratified it.

00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:06.880
Now the importance
of the convention

00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:10.870
is that it sets up the
international framework

00:34:10.870 --> 00:34:15.130
for cooperation on
peaceful uses of the ocean.

00:34:15.130 --> 00:34:20.330
This is the umbrella over which
all Maritime activity should

00:34:20.330 --> 00:34:23.800
take place-- peaceful
Maritime activity.

00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:26.300
There are comprehensive
provisions

00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:27.860
on marine environmental
protection,

00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:29.500
marine environmental research.

00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:32.439
It locks in rights concerning
freedom of navigation that

00:34:32.439 --> 00:34:33.730
are critically important to us.

00:34:33.730 --> 00:34:38.090
It secures the limits
of the territorial sea.

00:34:38.090 --> 00:34:39.335
It is foundational.

00:34:42.250 --> 00:34:47.710
We apply it as customary
international law.

00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:51.110
I think we need to move forward
and accede to the convention

00:34:51.110 --> 00:34:53.480
so that we can
assert those rights

00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:56.960
and protections on the strongest
legal footing possible,

00:34:56.960 --> 00:35:00.930
and that is treaty law.

00:35:00.930 --> 00:35:02.888
And I'm happy to talk
about that and questions.

00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:11.130
In closing, let me simply
leave you with this.

00:35:11.130 --> 00:35:14.130
We as a community are facing
extraordinary challenges

00:35:14.130 --> 00:35:16.650
as ocean temperatures
and sea levels rise,

00:35:16.650 --> 00:35:21.550
as marine life habitats change,
and government simply cannot

00:35:21.550 --> 00:35:22.420
address this alone.

00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:26.590
The calculus is much more
complex than one agency,

00:35:26.590 --> 00:35:29.670
and the calculus cannot be
balanced unless we ensure that

00:35:29.670 --> 00:35:33.670
the full continuum of
the equation meets its

00:35:33.670 --> 00:35:35.260
responsibilities.

00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:38.400
That full equation,
those critical factors

00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:40.650
need to be validated
and totaled.

00:35:40.650 --> 00:35:46.230
We must collaborate, we must
partner at different levels.

00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:48.730
Even those of us
with disparate views,

00:35:48.730 --> 00:35:50.550
we need to share
information and build

00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:52.980
on each other's good
works, the good ideas,

00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:54.460
and the good practices.

00:35:54.460 --> 00:35:55.980
We need scientists
to analyze data

00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:58.110
that industry and
government collects

00:35:58.110 --> 00:36:02.860
so that we may do our
business smarter and better.

00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:06.510
We need industry to comply
with environmental regulations

00:36:06.510 --> 00:36:09.210
to help achieve long
term sustainability.

00:36:09.210 --> 00:36:13.664
We need citizens to
continue to be vigilant.

00:36:13.664 --> 00:36:15.580
It's like if you see
something, say something.

00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:16.996
That applies to
Homeland Security,

00:36:16.996 --> 00:36:20.260
but it implies the protection
of our oceans just as much.

00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:25.930
We must work collaboratively at
all echelons-- local, regional,

00:36:25.930 --> 00:36:28.190
and internationally.

00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:30.490
We in the Coast Guard look
forward to working with you,

00:36:30.490 --> 00:36:32.380
and I thank you so much
for this opportunity

00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:33.900
to spend a little
bit of time with you

00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:35.540
and I look forward to
answering your questions.

00:36:35.540 --> 00:36:37.039
Thank you for a
fantastic symposium.

00:36:37.039 --> 00:36:39.900
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:47.710 --> 00:36:49.172
- I get to ask the
first question.

00:36:49.172 --> 00:36:50.630
I'll just ask one
question and then

00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:52.450
we'll turn it over
to the audience.

00:36:52.450 --> 00:36:53.870
So here's my question.

00:36:53.870 --> 00:36:55.580
10 days from now,
we're going to have

00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:56.870
an election in this country.

00:36:56.870 --> 00:37:00.210
Most people probably
know about that.

00:37:00.210 --> 00:37:02.570
What you may or may not
know is that right now there

00:37:02.570 --> 00:37:05.267
are two different
teams who are working

00:37:05.267 --> 00:37:07.100
in charge of the
transition depending on who

00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:09.230
wins the presidential election.

00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:11.960
Chris Christie is
heading the transition

00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:15.230
for the Republican
nominee Donald Trump,

00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:18.965
and Ken Salazar is
heading the transition

00:37:18.965 --> 00:37:23.139
on behalf of Hillary Clinton.

00:37:23.139 --> 00:37:25.430
As part of the transition,
what will happen-- whichever

00:37:25.430 --> 00:37:28.790
team's nominee
wins, they're going

00:37:28.790 --> 00:37:31.610
to come to all parts of the
executive branch including

00:37:31.610 --> 00:37:32.870
the Coast Guard.

00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:35.360
And they're going
to ask you, what

00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:39.440
are the pressing issues-- with
the new administration-- has

00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:40.460
to address?

00:37:40.460 --> 00:37:43.970
And so my question is when
the transition team comes

00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:45.890
with the Coast Guard,
and if and when

00:37:45.890 --> 00:37:48.774
they meet with you--
whichever team it is,

00:37:48.774 --> 00:37:50.690
it should make no
difference which team it is.

00:37:50.690 --> 00:37:54.350
Your reports should
be precisely the same.

00:37:54.350 --> 00:37:55.590
What will you tell them?

00:37:55.590 --> 00:37:57.256
What do you think the
Coast Guard should

00:37:57.256 --> 00:37:59.720
tell them-- are
the pressing issues

00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:03.981
the Coast Guard faces in
addressing the kinds of topics

00:38:03.981 --> 00:38:05.480
we're talking about
here, and that's

00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:09.000
going to be the oceans
and climate change.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.310
- I guess the first thing--
thanks for the question.

00:38:11.310 --> 00:38:12.920
I think the first
thing I would tell

00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:15.500
them is based on everything
that you saw here,

00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:17.458
you're going to need
a bigger Coast Guard.

00:38:17.458 --> 00:38:18.820
[LAUGHING]

00:38:19.730 --> 00:38:21.590
The other thing that
I would tell them

00:38:21.590 --> 00:38:25.141
is that they must remain
committed to recapitalizing

00:38:25.141 --> 00:38:26.390
the United States Coast Guard.

00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:28.880
We're in the midst of
recapitalization efforts

00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:31.220
for our deepwater fleet.

00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:35.930
We are just led a contract
to procure 25 offshore patrol

00:38:35.930 --> 00:38:39.020
cutters that will
project presence down

00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:41.180
in the transit zone for
counter-drug primarily

00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:43.629
and migrant
interdiction operations.

00:38:43.629 --> 00:38:45.670
But it's about projecting
that effective presence

00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:48.780
that I talked about
in the presentation.

00:38:48.780 --> 00:38:51.830
The next thing that I
would tell them is they

00:38:51.830 --> 00:38:56.090
need to commit to building
heavy icebreakers for the United

00:38:56.090 --> 00:38:57.440
States.

00:38:57.440 --> 00:38:59.690
I'm not going to say this
is a Coast Guard icebreaker

00:38:59.690 --> 00:39:01.130
because it's a national asset.

00:39:01.130 --> 00:39:02.770
I think many people
misunderstand that.

00:39:02.770 --> 00:39:05.270
This is a national asset that
just happens to be painted red

00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:07.700
and has a Coast
Guard stripe on it.

00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:10.250
Most people don't
realize that the United

00:39:10.250 --> 00:39:13.730
States has one medium
icebreaker that can only

00:39:13.730 --> 00:39:17.750
operate in the Arctic
and only has one--

00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:20.420
let me say that again--
one heavy icebreaker,

00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:21.710
the Polar Star.

00:39:21.710 --> 00:39:23.600
The Polar Sea, its
sister ship, is

00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:25.490
welded to the dock in Seattle.

00:39:25.490 --> 00:39:29.270
We had to take parts of it
to keep Polar Star running.

00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:32.240
We are losing ground when it
comes to building icebreakers

00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:36.660
to project effective presence
in the polar regions.

00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:39.350
The next thing I
would tell them is

00:39:39.350 --> 00:39:44.630
to ensure that we remain
focused on the Arctic.

00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:46.760
It's an opening area.

00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:49.010
We're continuing to see
increased man-made activity

00:39:49.010 --> 00:39:52.580
and the Coast Guard will
be the Maritime presence

00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:56.690
in the Arctic, and so we must
commit to a sustainable Arctic

00:39:56.690 --> 00:39:57.610
presence.

00:39:57.610 --> 00:39:58.850
- Thank you very much.

00:39:58.850 --> 00:39:59.737
We'll take questions.

00:39:59.737 --> 00:40:01.820
The price of asking a
question is you should first

00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:03.270
introduce yourself.

00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:04.550
- My name is David Arnold.

00:40:04.550 --> 00:40:05.450
Good afternoon.

00:40:05.450 --> 00:40:12.040
Who was holding out on
the 1982 treaty and why?

00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:17.230
- There are a lot of
members of Congress

00:40:17.230 --> 00:40:20.860
who believe that the
convention is not in the best

00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:24.460
interests of the United States.

00:40:24.460 --> 00:40:26.560
I think, and I'm just
going to generalize here

00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:30.130
because I don't want to point
to any particular individual.

00:40:30.130 --> 00:40:33.040
I'm just going to generally
talk about some of the concerns

00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:34.240
that I've heard.

00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:37.570
The first is I think there's
some misinformation out there.

00:40:37.570 --> 00:40:40.780
The problems that plague
the 1982 convention

00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:43.900
are still talked about as
reasons why we shouldn't join.

00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:46.369
This convention is modified
by the Part 11 agreement.

00:40:46.369 --> 00:40:48.160
So there's just
fundamental misinformation.

00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:51.100
People talk about forced
technology sharing.

00:40:51.100 --> 00:40:53.170
That's resolved.

00:40:53.170 --> 00:40:57.190
There are other people who
don't like the mandatory dispute

00:40:57.190 --> 00:40:58.900
resolution mechanisms.

00:40:58.900 --> 00:41:01.900
However, if you look at
a lot of US agreements,

00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:03.700
they have dispute
resolution mechanisms.

00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:05.722
And so, I'm not sure
why we're shying away

00:41:05.722 --> 00:41:07.930
from dispute resolution,
especially when we carve out

00:41:07.930 --> 00:41:10.000
military activities,
law enforcement

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:13.420
activities, and other things
that just aren't going to be

00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:16.240
subject to dispute resolution.

00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:19.930
I think there is some
concern about paying

00:41:19.930 --> 00:41:27.780
royalties for exploration in
the extent of continental shelf.

00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:29.980
There's a scheme set up
through the convention

00:41:29.980 --> 00:41:32.020
that if you have an extended
continental shelf, although you

00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:34.050
get sovereign rights to that
extent of continental shelf

00:41:34.050 --> 00:41:35.425
and I should say
parenthetically,

00:41:35.425 --> 00:41:38.200
we believe that if we
follow the procedures

00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:39.870
in the convention
which we now hold

00:41:39.870 --> 00:41:40.890
is customary international law.

00:41:40.890 --> 00:41:43.098
But if we went through the
process and the convention

00:41:43.098 --> 00:41:45.180
and secured the greatest
legal footing possible,

00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:47.850
we could claim an extended
continental shelf that's

00:41:47.850 --> 00:41:49.510
probably twice the
size of California

00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:52.140
or at least the size of
California-- it's huge--

00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:54.030
and we would get
sovereign rights.

00:41:54.030 --> 00:41:56.320
And that means the ability
to explore and exploit

00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:58.890
those resources
beyond 200 miles.

00:41:58.890 --> 00:42:01.870
But the convention
sets up a system

00:42:01.870 --> 00:42:06.367
where you have to pay a
certain percentage of royalties

00:42:06.367 --> 00:42:07.950
to the international
seabed authority,

00:42:07.950 --> 00:42:09.410
and people just don't like that.

00:42:09.410 --> 00:42:12.580
However, those provisions
were negotiated in large part

00:42:12.580 --> 00:42:14.800
by the offshore industry
back during the conventions

00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:16.120
negotiations.

00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:19.390
They have no problem
with the royalty scheme.

00:42:19.390 --> 00:42:21.990
In fact, the royalty scheme
only kicks in five years

00:42:21.990 --> 00:42:24.010
after you start production.

00:42:24.010 --> 00:42:26.830
A lot of wells are pretty
much exhausted by the time

00:42:26.830 --> 00:42:28.540
you get to five years.

00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:33.580
So those are just a few
reasons, and again there's just

00:42:33.580 --> 00:42:36.307
some bad information out there.

00:42:36.307 --> 00:42:38.890
Beyond just stale information,
just bad information out there,

00:42:38.890 --> 00:42:40.848
for example I've heard
some people say it would

00:42:40.848 --> 00:42:43.750
create a United Nations Navy.

00:42:43.750 --> 00:42:46.140
There ain't nothing I've
seen that says that.

00:42:46.140 --> 00:42:49.290
It says that no military
activities will be

00:42:49.290 --> 00:42:50.540
subject to dispute resolution.

00:42:50.540 --> 00:42:52.150
We know that's not true.

00:42:52.150 --> 00:42:54.010
And I could go on
and on and on, but I

00:42:54.010 --> 00:42:57.550
think what we tried to do a few
years ago when we were trying

00:42:57.550 --> 00:43:01.660
to move it through the Senate
as an administration was

00:43:01.660 --> 00:43:06.190
to correct any misperception
and to focus on what we see

00:43:06.190 --> 00:43:08.430
is large strategic benefits
to the United States,

00:43:08.430 --> 00:43:11.550
such as making sure that
we continue to project

00:43:11.550 --> 00:43:14.100
global leadership
on ocean policy,

00:43:14.100 --> 00:43:16.600
making sure that we can secure
those rights on the strongest

00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:20.320
legal footing possible,
making sure that we can secure

00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:23.260
and perfect title
to those resources

00:43:23.260 --> 00:43:25.660
on an extended
continental shelf.

00:43:25.660 --> 00:43:27.160
- I just want to
add a quick comment

00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:28.890
to what the Admiral
said, and that is it

00:43:28.890 --> 00:43:32.470
underscores the significant
voice the nation's military has

00:43:32.470 --> 00:43:34.942
right now on a lot of fronts.

00:43:34.942 --> 00:43:36.400
We have a national
government which

00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:39.720
for decades has been
largely paralyzed

00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:42.490
by partisanship
and by increasing

00:43:42.490 --> 00:43:45.120
distrust of the government.

00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:47.050
The nation's military
has a distinctively

00:43:47.050 --> 00:43:49.720
reliable and credible
voice that can really

00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:52.530
help break some of the logjams
on many of these pressing

00:43:52.530 --> 00:43:54.371
issues.

00:43:54.371 --> 00:43:56.370
- Hi, I'm Peter Girguis
from Harvard University.

00:43:56.370 --> 00:43:57.786
Thank you for that presentation.

00:43:57.786 --> 00:43:58.660
I have two questions.

00:43:58.660 --> 00:43:59.970
I'll start with the easy one.

00:43:59.970 --> 00:44:04.660
In light of your commitment to
appropriate resource management

00:44:04.660 --> 00:44:06.700
and environmental
protection security,

00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:10.700
have you considered running
for president-- question one?

00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:16.120
And on a more-- on maybe
a more difficult note,

00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:20.370
I've been part of the National
Science Foundation's council

00:44:20.370 --> 00:44:23.350
that oversees the US
academic research fleet.

00:44:23.350 --> 00:44:25.789
And one I can
absolutely corroborate

00:44:25.789 --> 00:44:28.080
what the Rear Admiral said,
and that is the icebreakers

00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:29.530
are a real problem.

00:44:29.530 --> 00:44:31.990
That the US academic
community depends

00:44:31.990 --> 00:44:35.490
on those icebreakers for
research in the polar regions,

00:44:35.490 --> 00:44:39.030
and at this point it's
actually embarrassing

00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:40.560
that we're at the
state we're at.

00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:42.101
But the question I
have for you, sir,

00:44:42.101 --> 00:44:44.910
is do you see an opportunity
to have academics engaged

00:44:44.910 --> 00:44:48.330
with your more daily and routine
activities given that we've

00:44:48.330 --> 00:44:50.850
lost about a third of our
academic research fleet

00:44:50.850 --> 00:44:52.830
and given that
your ships maintain

00:44:52.830 --> 00:44:54.600
a more substantial presence?

00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:58.100
Do you see a way that we can
collaborate across agencies,

00:44:58.100 --> 00:45:00.820
whether it's the US Coast
Guard and the National Science

00:45:00.820 --> 00:45:01.990
Foundation or so on?

00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:03.450
Thank you.

00:45:03.450 --> 00:45:05.200
- Thanks for the question.

00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:07.930
I absolutely do, and
I hope I mentioned

00:45:07.930 --> 00:45:09.430
some of those in my remarks.

00:45:09.430 --> 00:45:12.520
I think it's important for
the scientific community

00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:17.160
and the academic community
to help us push technology,

00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:18.250
to protect the oceans.

00:45:18.250 --> 00:45:21.490
I mentioned oil spill detection.

00:45:21.490 --> 00:45:24.164
We have real challenges now
with some of the heavier oils

00:45:24.164 --> 00:45:26.080
that are being transported
that actually sink.

00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:26.788
They don't float.

00:45:26.788 --> 00:45:29.140
You can skim oil on
top of the surface

00:45:29.140 --> 00:45:32.370
or you can clean it when
it hits the beaches.

00:45:32.370 --> 00:45:35.941
It's hard to clean up oil that
has a specific gravity-- what

00:45:35.941 --> 00:45:36.940
is it, greater than one?

00:45:36.940 --> 00:45:39.370
Somebody help me with science.

00:45:39.370 --> 00:45:40.500
Thank you, whew!

00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:42.240
[LAUGHING]

00:45:43.590 --> 00:45:45.600
- Chemistry major.

00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:47.910
- But I think the other
thing that's very helpful,

00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:50.243
and I'm going to speak as a
commander of the First Coast

00:45:50.243 --> 00:45:52.990
Guard district who has a large
fisheries responsibility up

00:45:52.990 --> 00:45:57.660
here in New England, and that
is to help us really develop

00:45:57.660 --> 00:46:01.080
the kind of metrics that
we need to make sure

00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:05.080
that our enforcement
actions are bearing fruit.

00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:07.240
Not in terms of penalizing
the fishing fleet,

00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:12.090
but in terms of
preserving the fish stock.

00:46:12.090 --> 00:46:14.620
Is enforcement having an effect?

00:46:14.620 --> 00:46:17.490
We can do it when we talk
about Coast Guard counterdrug

00:46:17.490 --> 00:46:18.300
efforts.

00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:23.787
We know generally how much
cocaine is produced worldwide.

00:46:23.787 --> 00:46:25.120
We know how much we're catching.

00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:27.020
We have good detection
and monitoring

00:46:27.020 --> 00:46:29.530
so we know often
when the bad guys go

00:46:29.530 --> 00:46:32.890
by because we just don't have
the resources to get them.

00:46:32.890 --> 00:46:35.910
The equation is a little
bit easier in counterdrug.

00:46:35.910 --> 00:46:38.200
It's not easy when it comes
to fisheries enforcement

00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:39.880
because each fish
stock is different,

00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:41.850
each species is different.

00:46:41.850 --> 00:46:45.330
They're migratory and
I'm not sure we've

00:46:45.330 --> 00:46:48.430
got the best possible
handle that we can

00:46:48.430 --> 00:46:53.240
on what the nature
of the problem is.

00:46:53.240 --> 00:46:56.080
I'm responsible for
putting Coast Guard

00:46:56.080 --> 00:47:00.260
resources to use the most
effective way possible.

00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:02.170
The only way I can
do that is if I

00:47:02.170 --> 00:47:04.300
can circle back
and look at metrics

00:47:04.300 --> 00:47:06.402
that say I'm having an effect.

00:47:06.402 --> 00:47:08.110
It's hard for me to
do that in fisheries.

00:47:08.110 --> 00:47:11.680
We're working on it within
the Coast Guard, but, wow,

00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:16.420
wouldn't it help if academia
and scientists joined us

00:47:16.420 --> 00:47:19.510
in that effort?

00:47:19.510 --> 00:47:22.360
- I'm Tanya [? Vartanian. ?]
I'm a musician with interest

00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:25.080
in the sciences.

00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:28.720
I was wondering
how much the-- how

00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:33.820
do you reconcile the
military experimentation that

00:47:33.820 --> 00:47:39.250
goes on in the oceans
with preserving

00:47:39.250 --> 00:47:43.060
the acoustical environment of
the sea mammals and other sea

00:47:43.060 --> 00:47:44.560
animals?

00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:48.370
I know there is a conflict
there that sometimes becomes

00:47:48.370 --> 00:47:50.790
the subject of discussion.

00:47:50.790 --> 00:47:54.760
- Yeah, you're not going to like
my answer to this because I'm

00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:57.700
not the expert on
sonars and acoustics

00:47:57.700 --> 00:48:00.600
because no Coast Guard
cutters have sonar.

00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:06.940
We took sonars off years
ago, so we're not the experts

00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:09.040
by any means.

00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:11.660
Somebody correct me if the
new cutters have sonar.

00:48:11.660 --> 00:48:13.710
I stand corrected.

00:48:13.710 --> 00:48:17.210
But no, we're not the
experts on acoustics.

00:48:17.210 --> 00:48:19.750
I mean, I listened to
the prior presentation

00:48:19.750 --> 00:48:24.370
with great interest, but it's
not something that we focus on.

00:48:24.370 --> 00:48:28.450
What I found more
applicable to us

00:48:28.450 --> 00:48:32.170
were the commercial
vessel trends transiting

00:48:32.170 --> 00:48:34.990
through the right
whale areas, and we

00:48:34.990 --> 00:48:37.180
do enforce the
speed restrictions

00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:38.710
to protect the right whales.

00:48:38.710 --> 00:48:39.820
- Thank you.

00:48:39.820 --> 00:48:42.160
- Sorry I didn't have a
better answer for you.

00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:43.610
- Thank you very much.

00:48:43.610 --> 00:48:46.757
- And with that, we'd like to
thank the Admiral, Richard.

00:48:46.757 --> 00:48:49.739
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:52.730 --> 00:48:55.610
So this has been a
delightful symposium

00:48:55.610 --> 00:48:57.740
because of all the
amazing presentations

00:48:57.740 --> 00:48:59.820
and great questions.

00:48:59.820 --> 00:49:03.470
The first one was amazing.

00:49:03.470 --> 00:49:05.240
I was really pleased
to learn about all

00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:06.860
the different
metabolic pathways.

00:49:06.860 --> 00:49:11.340
I will mention that one of the
poster session people, Joey

00:49:11.340 --> 00:49:17.330
Nelson, did her dissertation
on sulfur-- bacteria that uses

00:49:17.330 --> 00:49:19.385
sulfur as an energy source.

00:49:19.385 --> 00:49:20.510
So you may want to see her.

00:49:20.510 --> 00:49:24.560
The second panel looks--
it's somewhat sobering

00:49:24.560 --> 00:49:27.530
to look at the effects of
temperature changes, especially

00:49:27.530 --> 00:49:32.480
this number that-- I guess if
30% of the sea ice-- Arctic sea

00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:36.110
ice is left, that means
that 70% has gone away.

00:49:36.110 --> 00:49:38.900
And most of what is
remaining is not old ice,

00:49:38.900 --> 00:49:42.590
but it's just new
ice and just seems

00:49:42.590 --> 00:49:45.440
like we're looking
at a disaster there.

00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:48.920
It also shows the
incredible heat capacity.

00:49:48.920 --> 00:49:52.610
That little graph that showed
how much of the heat capacity

00:49:52.610 --> 00:49:55.940
is in the atmosphere compared
to how much is in the ocean-- I

00:49:55.940 --> 00:49:58.170
mean, I kind of knew
that conceptually,

00:49:58.170 --> 00:50:00.650
but to see it
displayed was just-- it

00:50:00.650 --> 00:50:01.850
really hit home to me.

00:50:01.850 --> 00:50:04.520
So that was incredible.

00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:08.030
We heard about very detailed
engineering strategies

00:50:08.030 --> 00:50:11.240
about how to mitigate the
risks of sea level rise.

00:50:11.240 --> 00:50:14.570
Because as we heard,
already the sea level rise

00:50:14.570 --> 00:50:16.030
is baked into the atmosphere.

00:50:16.030 --> 00:50:18.470
I mean, we can make choices
now about CO2 emissions,

00:50:18.470 --> 00:50:21.920
but it's coming and so
we have to get prepared

00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:24.050
and it's our decision
whether or not

00:50:24.050 --> 00:50:26.480
it's going to get really
bad or whether or not

00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:27.980
it becomes manageable.

00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:31.190
So that was what we saw there.

00:50:31.190 --> 00:50:33.760
And then the third
panel-- again,

00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:36.980
the effects of global warming.

00:50:36.980 --> 00:50:40.370
I caught a sea bass over
the summer off of Cape Cod,

00:50:40.370 --> 00:50:42.572
and we looked at it
and said, what's this.

00:50:42.572 --> 00:50:44.030
And we had to get
our little thing.

00:50:44.030 --> 00:50:46.696
And then the first thing he says
was, yeah, it's global warming.

00:50:46.696 --> 00:50:48.550
And then we tossed
it back and I just

00:50:48.550 --> 00:50:50.340
realized it was global warming.

00:50:50.340 --> 00:50:53.930
So, thanks.

00:50:53.930 --> 00:50:58.840
It's impressive the stress that
we're putting on New England

00:50:58.840 --> 00:51:03.400
biomass out there, and
I think next time I

00:51:03.400 --> 00:51:06.020
hear I have to stay away
from a right whale area,

00:51:06.020 --> 00:51:07.910
I'll definitely be doing it.

00:51:07.910 --> 00:51:11.050
And finally, I think
with the closing talk

00:51:11.050 --> 00:51:15.380
by the Admiral and just looking
at the diversity of ways

00:51:15.380 --> 00:51:17.990
of looking at this,
it just gets me back

00:51:17.990 --> 00:51:20.120
to at least a somewhat
hopeful state.

00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:22.130
I mean, when I was
in the Marshalls,

00:51:22.130 --> 00:51:25.880
as I opened up the talk,
I realized that we really

00:51:25.880 --> 00:51:27.980
are highly dependent on
protecting the ocean,

00:51:27.980 --> 00:51:31.220
and all of us have to think
about becoming protectors

00:51:31.220 --> 00:51:33.080
of the ocean because
it's something

00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:34.300
that affects all of us.

00:51:34.300 --> 00:51:37.880
And I hope the symposium
today brought home that,

00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:40.970
and as you go home you start
to reflect on what you heard

00:51:40.970 --> 00:51:44.000
and how you may
contribute in some way.

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:47.270
So thank you all and
enjoy the reception.

00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:50.320
[APPLAUSE]
