00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.270
Tamara: I have to say, it's a real treat for
me to introduce Ken

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.790
Auletta, who's written the "Annals of Communications"
column for the

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:10.680
New Yorker since 1992 and is here to discuss
his 11th book, which some

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:16.440
of you have, "Googled: The end of the world
as we know it". It chronicles

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.070
the rise of Google and its intercession with
the traditional media

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.910
world which could be of particular interest
to everyone here.

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.170
Umm, and Eric, I believe, called it one of
the most insightful

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:34.809
analyses of Google in a book ever.
Umm, Publishers Weekly said similarly, "It's

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:39.059
a sharp and probing
analysis of the apocalyptic upheavals in the

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.559
media and entertainment
industries."

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:47.499
NPR said it -- that "Few of its points couldn't
be discovered by

00:00:47.499 --> 00:00:52.859
Google Search in a fraction of a second."
But interestingly, the last -- what was going

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:56.719
to be the last chapter
of the book is instead available for free

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:01.870
on Ken's web site,
Kenauletta.com, and it consists of 25 media

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.850
maxims which he deduced
from his 13 visits to Mountain View over the

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.510
last two and a half
years of researching and writing.

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.740
And, uh, so maybe he can talk to us about
why he made that decision.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:20.530
So, uh, it's a pleasure to welcome him and
please join me in welcoming

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.700
Ken Auletta.
Thanks.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:23.700
&gt;&gt; [Clapping]

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.790
Ken: Thanks, Tamara.
What Tamara didn't say was that she was one

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.610
of my handlers as I was
spending this time in -- in Mountain View

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.860
and the truth is that --
that she was great, as was her boss, David

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.670
Crane.
And I was mentioning to her something that

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.750
was true for anyone in
communications.

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.300
If you are, umm, a PR person, one of the things
that -- that I found

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.660
in my experience as a journalist, uh, you
understand implicitly that

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.580
you represent two bosses.
Your primary boss is the company you work

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.320
for, or the government you
work for, or whatever your employer is. But

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.100
you have an obligation to
the journalist as well, to tell the truth.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.079
And, in fact, to do your job, you have to
earn the trust of that

00:02:09.079 --> 00:02:13.069
reporter.
Because someone like David Crane or Tamara

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.180
kept me away from making
mistakes of following false leads because

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.590
trusted them.
They weren't going to lie to me.

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.030
So it made my life a lot more efficient in
setting up appointments and

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.650
everything else.
And so I thank you.

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.319
Umm, and Ellen West, in don't know if she's
here, but Ellen was also from

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:35.279
here.
Many of my interviews here she -- she arranged.

00:02:35.279 --> 00:02:39.980
I was out last week, I was out in Mountain
View speaking there last

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.749
week, umm, on Thursday and on Monday of last
week I spoke with

00:02:44.749 --> 00:02:47.799
Microsoft.
So I have regards from your good friend to

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:48.799
the north.

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:49.799
&gt;&gt; [Laughing]

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:52.810
Ken: Not.
Umm, it was actually a very interesting visit

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.049
because I had done a
book ten years ago on Microsoft.

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:02.719
I covered their trial and I remember, umm,
the swagger that they had

00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:06.099
ten years ago before they were found guilty
in two federal courts.

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:12.469
Umm, they believed that they were advancing,
uh, a good, that they

00:03:12.469 --> 00:03:15.980
were creating an operating system that everyone
could use, it was

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:22.629
uniform, and wasn't that efficient and cool?
Umm, but they weren't thinking about the law

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:28.689
and -- and monopoly law,
etc., strength of trade laws, etc -- and they

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:32.170
got caught.
And -- but they -- at the time they felt that

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.361
they were on top of the
world.

00:03:33.361 --> 00:03:37.060
Remember, they were called the evil -- the
evil empire.

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:42.059
Umm, and when I went back ten years later,
last -- a week ago Monday,

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:49.120
I was stunned that at how tentative they had
become and how

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.180
questioning they were.
They were intently interested in finding out

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:58.439
more about you guys.
Tell us, what's Google like?

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:03.739
And that suggested a certain, you know, sweat
on the upper lip, umm,

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:07.340
to me.
They were -- they were much more humble, uh,

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.779
certainly friendly.
It was a very pleasant, umm, session I had

00:04:11.779 --> 00:04:16.260
and questions and all but it
was a different company, a company that realized,

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:21.660
umm, that they
were -- that they had slipped some and they

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.600
had a ways to get back,
and that maybe you were, uh -- had gained

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.130
on them.
And I remember -- I tell this story at the

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.770
beginning of the second
chapter of my book with an interview I do

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:38.690
with Gates in '98 and I said
to him, uh, Mr. Gates, I said, what do you

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.910
worry about when you think
about the future?

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.940
What's your nightmare?
And he -- he thought deeply and as he's thinking

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:48.870
deeply I'm thinking
he's gonna start naming Netscape, and Oracle,

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.420
and Apple, Sun, and he
didn't.

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:58.090
He gently rocked back and forth after he fetched
himself a Diet Coke

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:02.150
in the refrigerator behind his desk -- without
thinking to offer me

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:03.380
one -- umm --

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:04.380
&gt;&gt; [Laughing]

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.810
Ken: Social graces is not something you often
find in engineers.

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:12.540
You'll forgive my insult.
Umm, I saw some of the same traits at -- at

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:16.910
Google.
Umm, and, uh, I didn't make a blank statement

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:21.250
by the way so if some of
you are engineers, umm, can be excused.

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.670
Umm, and he said, I'll tell you what I worry
about, Ken.

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:28.990
He said, I worry about someone in a garage
inventing something, some

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:33.580
new technology I've never thought about and
that -- that's my

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:40.110
nightmare.
And in fact in '98 two people in a garage,

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:46.520
uh, Larry and Sergay, and --
and they've become Microsoft's worst nightmare.

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:51.480
In -- in my visit to -- I liken what I do
to visiting other planets

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:56.340
and -- and so I liken -- I visit the Google
planet and spent time and

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:01.210
tried to understand the natives, and the culture,
and -- and what was

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:06.330
different about your company.
Umm, and then I went back and visited other

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:09.580
planets while I'm
reporting this book including the planet where

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:14.680
I had spent more time
for earlier books, umm, traditional media

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:19.340
planet, and tried to
understand them and how they related to you

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:23.960
in the digital world which
in most cases was, uh, blindfolded.

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:29.900
Uh, they were not -- in my judgment, had not
spend the time they

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:34.800
should have spent, uh, trying to ride that
digital wave that people

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:39.050
like you have -- have created.
And that's why they've crashed into it.

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:45.000
So I -- I came away from this experience visiting
that planet with a

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.990
sense that they had -- that they -- they claimed
they were being

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:52.330
murdered.
In fact, they were much more guilty of committing

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:56.290
suicide, uh, over
the years and by not being proactive, and

00:06:56.290 --> 00:07:00.500
not making investments,
by -- I mean, you think about music companies

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:05.150
deciding that the -- you
can only buy an entire CD and then iTunes

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:10.160
comes along and -- and gives
consumers what you give them, which is choice.

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.941
And, umm, they didn't get it.
Or you think about newspapers;

00:07:12.941 --> 00:07:16.960
They would come back, say the New Yorker,
we had online editions 15

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:20.590
years ago and I would say to them, you did.
I know you did.

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:25.510
But who was in charge of the online editions?
The editor of the print newspaper.

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:28.620
And were they allowed to break stories instantly
as news was

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:29.620
happening?
No, no.

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:32.140
You had to wait 'til the next morning'tll
it appeared.

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:35.311
And do the people running that understand
that the internet or online

00:07:35.311 --> 00:07:40.250
was a very different medium than a newspaper?
It was multimedia, it was instant?

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:41.770
No.
They didn't get that either.

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:47.710
Did they make investments in digital companies?
Did they try and make a deal early on with

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:50.430
Google?
Nada.

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:55.710
So I learned that but I learned some things
in visiting your world.

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:59.700
One of the things that absolutely enthralled
me about Google is I kept

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:06.750
on saying to myself, where did two guys in
their 20s get such clarity

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:09.900
of thought?
And because when you think about it, here

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:15.010
are -- how did Larry Page,
and Sergay Brin, decide that they wouldn't

00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:19.010
have ads on their home
page, unlike, say, Yahoo!?

00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:23.730
How did they decide in their 20s, that unlike
Yahoo! or AOL that

00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:27.530
Google was not going to be a portal?
That people did a search and they were going

00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:31.900
to chase 'em off the Google
site to the destination of their choice?

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:36.490
How'd they decide that build it and they will
come?

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:41.830
We'll figure out a way of monetizing it.
And it took them three and a half years before

00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:44.159
they were able to
monetize it and advertise.

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:50.980
But they had faith that they could do it.
How they -- how they had the sense that give

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:55.880
engineers 20 percent of
their time off to work on projects of their

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:58.000
choice and that this would
be a great innovation?

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.660
How did they come up with the idea of having
two classes of stock,

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:05.940
where the New York Times or Warren Buffett
does, in order not to play

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:11.520
the Wall Street game of short term, of considerations?
So I was just dazzled by that and I did a

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:17.050
fair amount of reporting to
try and figure that out and -- and, umm, and

00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:22.010
I report that in my book.
I was also dazzled by something else, which

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:29.560
is as I would attend your
meetings, umm, and I would watch the engineers

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:33.460
speak the language that
to me was Swahili -- I mean, I literally didn't

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:36.250
understand half the
words that were being spoken, honestly.

00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:40.260
But I that had the luxury of time.
I could go around and Columbo-like and say,

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.980
tell me what that -- that
word means would you please.

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:47.280
And it was actually really an incessant question.
I wanted to know the answer.

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:51.650
So I had -- I had time to figure that out.
But as I'm sitting in these engineering meetings,

00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:55.720
two things came to
mind: One, I kept on thinking of Terry Semel,

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:59.170
who was the head of
Yahoo!, or originally when he took it over

00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:04.640
in 2001 the same year as
Eric Schmidt came to -- to Google, he had

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:08.980
done a very good job of
settling down Yahoo!, and it did very well,

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:14.880
and, umm, but then Yahoo!
slipped in its engineering, as, by the way,

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:19.820
Apple did when John
Sculley, another non engineer, was in charge.

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:23.300
And you realize as you're sitting there, that's
why it slipped, 'cause

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:26.770
these guys couldn't understand -- like me,
they couldn't understand

00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:30.360
the words and the language that the engineers
were speaking to them,

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:34.620
could not inspire them, could not challenge
them the way Larry Page,

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:39.610
and Sergay Brin, and Eric Schmidt, all engineers,
could.

00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:43.080
So that really struck me as -- as -- as kind
of significant.

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:50.730
But also another thing struck me which is
that key to your culture and

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:52.940
your success -- and I'm going to talk about
some of your failures in

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:57.730
a -- in a minute so I'm not here to give you
wet kisses -- umm --

00:10:57.730 --> 00:10:58.730
&gt;&gt; [Laughing]

00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:02.520
Ken: But, umm, key to your success is that
the engineers are treated

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:04.862
like a king.
And if you think about it, one of the things

00:11:04.862 --> 00:11:09.530
that -- the thoughts that
came over me as I'm reporting this book is

00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:13.520
that the engineer at
Google -- the engineer at a lot of these companies,

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:17.790
facebook, etc. --
is often the -- a content creator, is often

00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:22.190
the Martin Scorsese, if
you will, because those apps that they're

00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:26.290
creating are things that
occupy people's attention.

00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:32.000
And it's content; and why it's content is
because if I'm spending two

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.900
hours on Google Search or two hours -- or
an hour on Google Maps or I'm

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:42.410
spending two hours on facebook, that's an
hour or two hours I am not

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:48.110
spending watching CBS or reading a book.
That becomes content to me.

00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:51.810
And -- and the content creator's a person
who's created that cool

00:11:51.810 --> 00:12:00.040
application that's riveted my attention.
I learned something else: That the virtue

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:05.920
of these engineers is also
often -- and I emphasize often because I -- I

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:10.610
don't make -- I try not
to make sweeping generalizations -- but often

00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:15.180
that virtue, its flip
side is that it's often advice.

00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:21.440
And what I mean by that is that engineers
are really good at things

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:27.010
you can quantify and measure.
And one of the things you've done brilliantly

00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:29.510
here is you ask a series
of questions.

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:32.080
You started with search.
Why can't it be more efficient?

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:36.420
Why do we have to have ads on home page?
Why do -- why don't we just send people off

00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:37.850
and not treat it like a
port?

00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:44.520
All those questions that you asked with search.
But then as you started asking other questions:

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:48.041
Why do advertisers --
why do clients, advertising clients, have

00:12:48.041 --> 00:12:52.270
to pay four or 5 percent to
a media ad firm if we can do it more efficiently

00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:55.230
and we charge them when
we click on an ad?

00:12:55.230 --> 00:13:00.870
Why can't we have Google news and aggregate
news and provide 25,000

00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:04.050
newspapers and magazines from all around the
world--really cool -- why

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:08.740
can't we digitize all the books in the world?
I mean, all these things are wonders to someone

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:11.910
like me.
I mean, doing a book like this without Google?

00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:15.940
I mean, you can't do it.
I mean, I have to be getting up, and out of

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:19.300
my gym shorts when I'm
writing which is very -- and away from my

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:23.420
refrigerator, both of which
are great comforts to me, and go to the library

00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:24.970
and, you know, it --
so it's really cool.

00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:27.980
But -- but as you start asking all those questions
about Google Books,

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:31.899
and Google News, and -- and advertising and
how about for your

00:13:31.899 --> 00:13:35.420
telephone service?
You know, and -- and how about YouTube and

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:38.480
television?
Why can't we get that through John Stewart.

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:43.990
Why can't you see it on, we're on a plane.
User generated contents or whatever.

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:48.850
Or cloud computing, then you start -- Google
starts to call itself not

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:53.910
a search company but by 2004 you were calling
yourself a media

00:13:53.910 --> 00:14:00.180
company, which you've become.
But as you become a media company, because

00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:05.930
you want to be able to
quantify things, just as happened to Microsoft

00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:12.180
in '98, '99, 2000.
Microsoft, if you would say to them -- I mean,

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:15.450
I'll tell you, this
literally happened to me talking to Bill Gates

00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:17.090
when I'm reporting that
Microsoft book.

00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:21.930
He said, how can the government question my
 -- Microsoft's intentions?

00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:25.440
How could they think we're trying to do evil
 -- they didn't use the

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:29.420
word "evil" but -- but actually that was a
phrase that was affixed

00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:33.870
to -- as you know well, to Microsoft back
in that point in time.

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:38.050
He was generally outraged.
It was not an act on his part.

00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:43.870
He was generally outraged by it.
And because he and -- and -- and Steve Ballmer

00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:48.040
and the people at
Microsoft couldn't understand why people might

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:53.370
fear the size of
Microsoft and might, in looking at their e-mail

00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:57.270
traffic -- which was
all on display in that courtroom -- uh, why

00:14:57.270 --> 00:14:59.550
people might feel that
they were acting like thugs.

00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:04.500
Umm, they thought they were advancing some
kind of social group.

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:10.860
And I think similarly you have been very late
to understand at Google

00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:17.600
the fears that your size and dominance creates.
Now, you're not -- as Eric Schmidt often said

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:21.590
to me when I would pose
this question -- and I think he's right -- people

00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:24.300
are only one click
away from dropping Google.

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:25.700
and that's true, unlike Microsoft.

00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:30.560
You can't, 95 percent of the operating systems
as they had, you couldn't just

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:34.490
drop Microsoft.
you needed access.

00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:38.140
so there is a difference and I'm not claiming
comparability.

00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:42.390
I'm not claiming the sameness but I am claiming
some comparability and

00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:47.990
the comparability is that they didn't understand,
at Microsoft, the fear if

00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:52.350
they aroused.
And Google has been late to understand that

00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:54.339
fear.
but it's not just -- it's not just the issue

00:15:54.339 --> 00:15:57.720
of size or concentration
of power.

00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:03.780
You've got two other issues that you face
that are potentially atomic.

00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:08.330
One is privacy.
You create -- you create or collect a mountain

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:12.790
of data on people from
all of your various applications, not just

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:16.060
Search.
That is a tremendous amount of information.

00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:20.269
As you know, there are countries in Europe
that have more stringent

00:16:20.269 --> 00:16:23.459
privacy regulations than we do and the fears
are even greater.

00:16:23.459 --> 00:16:28.790
But that fear will rise and it will rise not
just because of what you

00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:32.490
do but because of what advertisers increasingly
demand.

00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:35.760
And in fact when you talk to advertisers,
as I do for this book, or

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:39.240
you talk to the telephone companies, as I
do for this book, or the

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:42.120
cable companies, as I do for this book, it's
quite astonishing what

00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:45.990
they -- the brave new world they envision
or what they will do with

00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:49.040
the data.
Not just your data, but the data that every

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:54.170
cable box has or the data
that -- that -- that -- that every telephone

00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:57.480
company has, and your
create card numbers, and lots of other material

00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:00.820
about what you do.
what you watch, how long, what you like, what

00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:04.520
you buy, etc.
And that will -- that is going to create a

00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:11.970
conflict as sure as we're here
today between governments, or other businesses,

00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:15.209
or the public
concerned about privacy.

00:17:15.209 --> 00:17:20.079
The third potential atomic issue that I think
you face and that I

00:17:20.079 --> 00:17:24.660
think you have not been as sensitive as you
might have been was -- is

00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:28.800
copyright.
I mean, you saw that -- you -- you will be

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:31.740
in a court soon if they
don't settle- and I don't think you will-

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:36.490
with Viacom over YouTube, where
they've sued you for a billion dollars.

00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:39.930
You were sued, uh, for a period of time by
the publishers and the

00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:44.710
authors guild.
You settled that and yesterday the judge,

00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:48.630
uh, allowed it to go forward
until a hearing in February when the Justice

00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:54.010
Department has to weigh
in as to whether they concur with the settlement.

00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:58.230
But you were going to have a lawsuit there
had you not relented and

00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:02.400
understood that there were copyright issues
here and your definition

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:09.830
of "fair use", you were pushing too far.
And -- and -- and similar things are gonna

00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:12.090
happen.
You see Murdoch threatened you with -- you

00:18:12.090 --> 00:18:17.230
know, the pull of all his
newspapers, not just, you know, from Search

00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:19.970
as well as from Google
News, etc.

00:18:19.970 --> 00:18:24.350
That issue will -- will rear up and, you know,
a lot of these old media

00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:27.520
guys are gonna come hat and hand and say,
"Make my business whole."

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:30.870
That's not Google's responsibility to make
them whole.

00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:33.570
And there are a lot of newspapers you would
not want to, you know,

00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:37.370
contribute money to.
But, I don't know, when Larry Page says to

00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:42.950
me, as he did and as I report
in this book, you know, we depend -- for search,

00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:47.330
we depend on good
information and so we have a real stake in

00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:51.320
the New York Times
surviving and some other -- and the Wall Street

00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:54.040
journal and others --
he mentioned the Times specifically.

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:58.010
And, you know, that -- so the New York Times
is going to go hat in hand,

00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:01.600
at some point, as the Wall Street journal
would and say, if you have a

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:04.670
stake in us for good search, shouldn't you
be subsidizing?

00:19:04.670 --> 00:19:07.710
And the problem, of course, that you're gonna
confront is you're gonna

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:11.610
have the trail behind them of every newspaper
in the world who said

00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:16.030
they want, you know, they want support and
subsidy, and you're not going to

00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:17.540
do that.
That's not your responsibility.

00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:21.610
But you're will be confronted with some big
issues about, uh, whether

00:19:21.610 --> 00:19:27.471
you share in that information.
Now, I can say in the short term that it is

00:19:27.471 --> 00:19:34.510
terrific for us as -- as
users to be able to search and get access

00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:38.179
to any newspaper story in
the world.

00:19:38.179 --> 00:19:40.730
It really -- it -- it -- I mean, it's just
a wonderous thing for me to

00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:45.020
be able to search books or academic journals,
wonderful thing.

00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:50.020
But one of the questions in the future is,
if the New York Times, for

00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:54.570
instance, doesn't survive, and other really
estimable newspapers

00:19:54.570 --> 00:20:01.679
don't survive, and they can't maintain bureaus
in Kabul, or Baghdad,

00:20:01.679 --> 00:20:07.250
or can't spend two or three months doing an
investigative report, then

00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:12.080
I don't think the blogosphere can replace
that kind of journalist, which

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:16.250
we, as citizens, all have a stake in.
Interestingly enough, Larry Page has thought

00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:19.830
a lot about this and I
had a long conversation about this with him

00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:23.990
and he was reading some
books on -- on journalism at the time and

00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:25.200
was really concerned about
it.

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:28.890
Now, how do you translate that kind of concern
into some kind of an

00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:31.090
action?
I don't know the answer to that and he obviously

00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:33.090
didn't when we were
talking.

00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:37.290
But in my last interview in Mountain View,
which was April 1st, umm, and

00:20:37.290 --> 00:20:42.980
it wasn't a joke even though it was April
Fool's day, I left Eric Schmidt's

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:47.090
office and I went down to the cafeteria and
who do I bump in to but Arthur

00:20:47.090 --> 00:20:50.169
Sulzberger, Jr., the proprietor -- the owner
 -- the proprietor of the New

00:20:50.169 --> 00:20:55.370
York times, and he was going up to see Eric,
and they were trying to

00:20:55.370 --> 00:21:00.460
figure out is there some way that we could
provide more help to the

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:04.450
Times without busting our bank, and without
taking responsibility for

00:21:04.450 --> 00:21:07.720
all the mistakes the Times and other papers
have made?

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:13.070
And that, I know, is an ongoing discussion.
But it's one that I think- whether you work

00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:17.780
at Google or not- we all
have a stake in -- in -- in having good journalism.

00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:23.240
When I spend -- before I -- I -- I open the
questions, when I look at

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:29.950
the future, which I try to do at the end of
 -- of this book, umm, I

00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:34.370
think you're a great company.
Umm, I think Microsoft's a great company.

00:21:34.370 --> 00:21:41.570
Umm, but you're right now a greater company
than they are, and you do amazing things.

00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:47.970
Umm, you -- but you -- you are gonna face
some huge issues.

00:21:47.970 --> 00:21:52.870
Umm, one of them I've just mentioned which
is that that sensitivity

00:21:52.870 --> 00:22:00.130
gene- which is not always exhibited at Google-
will be challenged as you

00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:06.110
go forward by governments, by other companies,
uh, and by the public,

00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:11.700
uh, on issues like privacy.
And -- and that's going to be a real challenge.

00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:15.180
You -- you know the challenge you face as
you get big and success.

00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:20.010
you start losing good people, people want
to get with a start up where they

00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:23.730
have an opportunity.
If they came here after 2004 to maybe make

00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:27.350
a killing, maybe
to have a bigger job responsibility, maybe

00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:30.420
because they're frustrated,
they feel some of the people above them are

00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:34.330
 -- are -- have lost some
energy.

00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:37.151
So they want to move on.
You're going to have some challenges with

00:22:37.151 --> 00:22:40.880
 -- with -- with users just as
Microsoft did.

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:43.530
With the sense of -- you know, it's a -- you
live in a very cloistered

00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:45.670
world.
You get free food.

00:22:45.670 --> 00:22:49.920
You know, out there, I mean, you get massages,
and -- and car washes,

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:54.180
and oil changes, and physicians.
I don't know how many of those services you

00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:57.270
have here.
I assume you have many of them.

00:22:57.270 --> 00:23:01.530
Umm, it's quite a -- a cloistered, comfortable
world.

00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:04.850
But it's a world where it is very easy, particularly
if you've had the

00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:11.440
success and growth you've enjoyed, it's very
easy to -- to get full of

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:15.130
yourself and lose the humility that I think
anyone in any business,

00:23:15.130 --> 00:23:19.770
particularly journalism, which is about asking
questions and not

00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:23.929
having the answers before you ask the questions,
umm, that needs to

00:23:23.929 --> 00:23:28.690
function in this world.
So I -- I think as great as you are and as

00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:34.419
ambitious as you are, and
all the cool things you do, you are a challenged

00:23:34.419 --> 00:23:39.559
company and -- and --
and as -- as some of the old media folks that

00:23:39.559 --> 00:23:43.610
I write about are
challenged in a much more severe way, up,

00:23:43.610 --> 00:23:48.720
ask it's -- it's always
useful to remember that as you, uh, as you

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:53.419
think about how that stock
is at $700 a share.

00:23:53.419 --> 00:23:55.710
Anyway, I'd love to take your questions and
thank you.

00:23:55.710 --> 00:24:00.179
&gt;&gt; [Applause]

00:24:00.179 --> 00:24:06.850
&gt;&gt; Hi.
Thanks for coming.

00:24:06.850 --> 00:24:08.910
Question, though.
Now, it turns out that knowing the future

00:24:08.910 --> 00:24:12.910
and even preparing for it --
knowing the future has a limited utility and

00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:15.251
in the specific area that you
were talking about there.

00:24:15.251 --> 00:24:18.630
Uh, for instance, I'm from a large -- surprisingly
large, I think

00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:21.620
and constantly growing group of people who
for well over the last

00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:27.760
15 to 20 years, okay, has been taking a sincere
interest in, umm,

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:31.060
in -- in an industry that we're in the process
of disrupting, and that

00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:34.930
is the mainstream media, the traditional media
of journalism and such,

00:24:34.930 --> 00:24:39.220
and we've been constantly warning these people
of what would happen,

00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:42.340
how they should prepare for it, how they should
compete with us, how

00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:47.220
they should work with us, etc.
Umm, in fact, my gut feel is I don't think

00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:52.080
in history, okay, any group
of disrupters has ever had such a deep and

00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:56.210
principled interest in the
industry that they are disrupting nor given

00:24:56.210 --> 00:25:00.530
it so much energy and
assistance in trying to keep it going.

00:25:00.530 --> 00:25:05.340
But we've been consistently ignored, we've
been consistently -- uh,

00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:10.200
all the advice has been consistently rejected,
and we're talking onto

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:13.750
two decades probably of the -- the conversation
here being noisy.

00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:17.460
Now, we're at the point now where people sort
of are finally beginning

00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:21.210
to realize there really is a problem.
The stuff we were telling them back in the

00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:27.040
early 90s, it's happening.
So, the question is, for you, because you've

00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:31.500
been in this business for
a long time, how can we get them to listen

00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:35.100
to what we're saying and
what in the world, at this point, can you

00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:38.730
suggest that we might be
able to do to keep journalism going?

00:25:38.730 --> 00:25:43.340
Because 20 years of advice has simply been
ignored.

00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:48.179
Ken: Umm, it's a very good question and I
wish I had a very good answer.

00:25:48.179 --> 00:25:53.870
I don't have a simple answer for that.
I mean, one of the things -- I -- I -- I came

00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:58.170
away from this book
believing is a long-winded way of answering

00:25:58.170 --> 00:26:01.750
your question.
My -- one of the differences between you guys

00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:07.280
and Microsoft.
Microsoft were cold businessmen.

00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:12.750
They were people who really wanted to kill
their competition.

00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:18.049
Google, I think, is composed much more of
 -- of cold engineers and

00:26:18.049 --> 00:26:21.370
they're -- they're -- they're looking for
efficiencies and you've

00:26:21.370 --> 00:26:25.059
looked for efficiencies.
Now, you have said-- to introduce the point

00:26:25.059 --> 00:26:30.960
you made -- you said despite the fact
that I say you're cold engineers and that's

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:35.950
a much more of a
complement than saying a cold businessman

00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:40.970
obviously -- that you're
saying you tried to reach out to traditional

00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:43.559
media and -- and work
with them.

00:26:43.559 --> 00:26:46.289
And there's some evidence of that and I produce
some in the book of

00:26:46.289 --> 00:26:52.730
meetings that were held.
Umm, they -- a reason I -- I think they committed

00:26:52.730 --> 00:26:55.870
suicide more than
they were murdered is because they didn't

00:26:55.870 --> 00:26:59.090
get it.
They didn't -- they weren't proactive, they

00:26:59.090 --> 00:27:04.090
didn't figure out that we
have to reach -- do something in the digital

00:27:04.090 --> 00:27:08.299
world and maybe we have
to grab on to the Google hand whether it was

00:27:08.299 --> 00:27:12.780
outreached or not.
And what they do now I think one of the things

00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:16.410
you're going to -- we're
going to be facing -- and I -- I think this

00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:23.370
is a real shift that's taking
place in the valley -- there's a -- a growing

00:27:23.370 --> 00:27:29.530
willingness to accept
the notion of pay, not just advertising as

00:27:29.530 --> 00:27:35.280
the means of paying for,
umm, for things online.

00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:39.290
And that ultimately if -- if true -- and let
me just give you some

00:27:39.290 --> 00:27:43.720
evidence why I think it is true -- could actually
be a bit of a life

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:50.010
raft for traditional media.
Let me just say what I mean.

00:27:50.010 --> 00:27:54.869
You're shaking your head.
Tell me why you're shaking your head.

00:27:54.869 --> 00:27:55.869
&gt;&gt; [Quiet]

00:27:55.869 --> 00:27:57.590
&gt;&gt; The news that most people care about, at
least the news for the

00:27:57.590 --> 00:28:00.799
public, is essentially the tip-of-the-iceberg
news.

00:28:00.799 --> 00:28:06.240
It's the -- out of any industry, say you take
pharmaceutical, take computers business,

00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:09.799
whatever, there's a vast amount of news that
happens on any particular

00:28:09.799 --> 00:28:11.799
day.
The vast majority of -- of it is only of interest

00:28:11.799 --> 00:28:13.900
to people that are
in the industry.

00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:16.900
The stuff that the newspapers work with is
the tip of the iceberg,

00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:20.870
it's the few hot stories.
Unfortunately, the few hot stories, for the

00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:24.480
most part, the bulk of
their material -- the bulk of what they cover,

00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:26.130
not the investigative
reporting -- those few hot stories are very

00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:30.500
easy to find, they're very
easy to discover, and as a result there's

00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:34.352
tremendous -- there's a low barrier
of entry to find them.

00:28:34.352 --> 00:28:37.770
So competition will commoditize the tip-of-the-iceberg
news.

00:28:37.770 --> 00:28:40.130
There is a business -- and there always has
been -- a tremendous

00:28:40.130 --> 00:28:45.049
business in the deep news.
Organizations like the Bureau of National

00:28:45.049 --> 00:28:47.000
Affairs, Congress
Clearinghouse, Nature Publishing Organization,

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:50.330
etc., they make
tremendous amounts of money in newsletters,

00:28:50.330 --> 00:28:53.130
make tremendous amounts of
money in -- on the deep news.

00:28:53.130 --> 00:28:55.620
But the -- and that business is going on and
will continue.

00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:58.740
The business we're concerned about is public
journalism which,

00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:03.370
unfortunately, is the tip-of-the-iceberg news
and that stuff is --

00:29:03.370 --> 00:29:06.350
will be exceptionally difficult for anybody
to get enough of a

00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:09.331
competitive and sustainable advantage that
they can charge for.

00:29:09.331 --> 00:29:12.070
Ken: I -- I wasn't just talking about news
 -- newspapers, by the way.

00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:16.740
I mean, if -- take a look what you're doing
on YouTube.

00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:21.650
YouTube increasingly is -- realized that -- that,
the engineers made a

00:29:21.650 --> 00:29:24.360
mistake at YouTube.
The engineers thought that if you have the

00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:26.580
traffic, advertisers will
come.

00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:30.539
They weren't coming.
You were projected to lose $500 million at

00:29:30.539 --> 00:29:34.110
YouTube this year.
You've reduced those losses dramatically.

00:29:34.110 --> 00:29:38.580
Still going to lose money this year.
And the reason you reduced losses is you have

00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:39.580
more professional
contact.

00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:43.770
When I went to Eric Schmidt for my next to
last interview back in

00:29:43.770 --> 00:29:48.179
December -- last December, I said, John Hennessy,
the President of

00:29:48.179 --> 00:29:51.230
Stanford, who's on the board of Google said
to me, he believes the

00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:54.560
mistake that was made early on in the internet
is that we didn't

00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:59.299
charge, that we're too reliant on advertising.
One of the things that you see from recession

00:29:59.299 --> 00:30:03.049
is that advertising
dollars shrink and people become more alarmed

00:30:03.049 --> 00:30:06.200
and worried, also more
dependent on advertising which is another

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:09.270
source for work.
Do you agree with -- with Hennessy.

00:30:09.270 --> 00:30:11.180
He said, I don't.
I think free is the right model.

00:30:11.180 --> 00:30:16.670
In my last interview with Eric in April, I
said, Eric, do you still agree

00:30:16.670 --> 00:30:18.850
with what you said to me in December?
He said, no.

00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:23.130
I've changed my mind.
He said, I think you need another -- source

00:30:23.130 --> 00:30:24.970
of income.
And that's what you're doing.

00:30:24.970 --> 00:30:29.320
I -- I bet you you're going to start having
some sort of subscription

00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:34.400
model on YouTube, some sort of payment model
on YouTube at some point

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:36.600
in the future.
That -- that's just -- that's in terms of

00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:39.850
 -- because one of the things
you realize is that the advertiser needs a

00:30:39.850 --> 00:30:43.860
friendly place -- a
predictable place to put their friendly ads,

00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:47.120
A, but B you want to have a
multiple source of income.

00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:50.400
You don't want to make the same mistake broadcasting
made.

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:54.059
Broadcasting shrinks in part because it has
a single source of

00:30:54.059 --> 00:30:57.120
revenue, advertising. Cable is a much more
robust business because it

00:30:57.120 --> 00:31:00.909
also has a subscription model.
And I think you're gonna be moving that.

00:31:00.909 --> 00:31:04.710
Now, your point about newspapers becoming
commod -- news becoming

00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:08.620
commoditized I think that's largely true and
that's a real problem,

00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:13.740
uh, for them.
But I -- I -- I think if you look long-term,

00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:17.789
not short-term -- and
maybe there's no good solution to this; but

00:31:17.789 --> 00:31:21.150
I think you've got to try to
find one and you've got to do some things

00:31:21.150 --> 00:31:25.720
including testing some -- some
pay models, being with the Kindle or whatever

00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:29.270
 -- but and -- and -- and
maybe some revenue models with the -- with

00:31:29.270 --> 00:31:35.530
the Google, umm, that you
can never replicate Dexter Filkins in Afghanistan

00:31:35.530 --> 00:31:38.280
for the New York
Times.

00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:41.660
Never.
You can never replicate the kind of deep,

00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:44.570
investigative reporting where
someone -- I mean, take -- take a look with

00:31:44.570 --> 00:31:48.210
the New York Times.
They did seven parts on the reporter David

00:31:48.210 --> 00:31:50.440
Rohde who was -- who was
kidnapped in Afghanistan.

00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:55.730
And he wrote seven days of the most extraordinary
stories and

00:31:55.730 --> 00:31:59.429
stories, by the way, I would argue that you
got a better glimpse at

00:31:59.429 --> 00:32:03.330
who the Taliban was and what their motivations
were than any other thing I've

00:32:03.330 --> 00:32:07.240
ever read about them.
You can't replicate that.

00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:09.900
And -- and we, as citizens, have an interest
in preserving that.

00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:15.950
Whether we can is another question.
Ken: You want the last word?

00:32:15.950 --> 00:32:17.549
&gt;&gt; [Laughing]

00:32:17.549 --> 00:32:20.900
&gt;&gt; Well, I -- I think -- I think you can replicate
it and I think the

00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:26.650
problem is that people haven't tried.
Just to be really brief, pool reporting.

00:32:26.650 --> 00:32:30.810
If you cut down the number of people who are
in the area, umm, of a

00:32:30.810 --> 00:32:34.850
particular area, they can sell the content.
For instance, if you had an organization,

00:32:34.850 --> 00:32:40.640
umm, that specialized in the
Afghan war news, it would have a lot of output

00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:42.750
 -- lot of -- lot
of -- lot of different markets that it could

00:32:42.750 --> 00:32:45.110
sell the content into.
Some of them would be deep content markets,

00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:47.860
others would be, uh,
tip-of-the-iceberg markets.

00:32:47.860 --> 00:32:52.690
Umm, there's a tremendous number of ways to
monetize news about

00:32:52.690 --> 00:32:56.390
Afghanistan.
Uh, what we haven't seen so far is people

00:32:56.390 --> 00:33:00.500
who go into the business of
do things like monetizing the news about Afghanistan.

00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:05.100
Uh, they're trying to continue the old models
of, you know, how do I

00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:08.460
distribute this stuff for free?
Umm, we don't have, for instance, the New

00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:09.460
York Times.
Yeah.

00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:11.049
They produce these great written reports.
Okay.

00:33:11.049 --> 00:33:15.549
But they're only doing what goes in the newspaper.
They're not, for instance, also building out

00:33:15.549 --> 00:33:18.710
the deep news, they're
not holding the conferences, they're not holding

00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:22.491
 -- they're not doing
all the other 27 ways of monetizing a news

00:33:22.491 --> 00:33:24.820
organization.
They're only doing the one thing that they've

00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:26.980
done in the past.
And that's the problem.

00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:29.760
They keep thinking that they're in the newspaper
business instead of

00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:32.230
being in the news business.

00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:39.420
Ken: I don't -- I don't disagree with anything
you've just said.

00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:41.175
&gt;&gt; If you're in the news business, you can't
monetize -- [Inaudible]

00:33:41.175 --> 00:33:43.029
Ken: Yeah.
The only -- the only qualification I would

00:33:43.029 --> 00:33:47.940
have to what you said is
that -- and I -- again, it goes back to the

00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:50.929
thesis -- I don't think
these people have been inventive at all.

00:33:50.929 --> 00:33:55.160
I think they've been reactive.
But, I mean, there are some brilliant people

00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:58.970
like Clay Shirky, the NYU
professor who writes a brilliant blog and

00:33:58.970 --> 00:34:00.260
he said the issue isn't the
New York Times.

00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:05.260
It's journalism.
How do you preserve good journalism?

00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:09.691
And I think one of the things that -- that
Clay misunderstands and a

00:34:09.691 --> 00:34:14.129
lot of people, and perhaps you are guilty
of this as well -- is that

00:34:14.129 --> 00:34:18.970
not understanding that good journalism is
not an individual effort.

00:34:18.970 --> 00:34:21.440
Just as what you do here is not an individual
effort.

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:25.580
It's a team effort.
When I want to do a story for the New Yorker,

00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:31.190
let's say, I talk to a
couple of editors; right, and we kick around

00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:36.270
ideas, and then when I
hand in that piece I am getting feedback and

00:34:36.270 --> 00:34:41.480
they're saying to me,
"You buried your lead and it's on Page 13."

00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:45.599
Or, "I don't think you've personalized this
enough" or -- or whatever.

00:34:45.599 --> 00:34:49.040
Their -- their input is very important to
that product.

00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:53.429
But it's not just them.
As the piece is going through edits, other

00:34:53.429 --> 00:34:57.200
editors are looking at it.
And then fact checkers at the New Yorker -- which

00:34:57.200 --> 00:35:00.710
is not typical in
that sense of other institutions -- are doing

00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:02.619
it.
And then the copy editor is getting it.

00:35:02.619 --> 00:35:07.890
So it becomes a team effort.
It's my name on the piece but it's a team

00:35:07.890 --> 00:35:08.890
effort that helped produce
it.

00:35:08.890 --> 00:35:11.330
And if you think about newspapers, you're
standing around, you're

00:35:11.330 --> 00:35:14.850
getting ideas from people at -- in that news
room.

00:35:14.850 --> 00:35:20.790
And -- and it's incredibly valuable.
Umm, and -- and I think at -- I think people

00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:24.180
who are -- who -- who
know more about technology than they do about

00:35:24.180 --> 00:35:28.310
journalism fall into the
trap of -- of missing that truth.

00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:29.310
That's the argument I would make.
Yes, sir?

00:35:29.310 --> 00:35:36.580
&gt;&gt; Hi there.
Uh, in your reporting on the book -- and I

00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:38.430
confess I haven't read it.
I apologize.

00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:42.670
Uh ... yes.
Uh, were you particularly inclined to speak

00:35:42.670 --> 00:35:49.730
to regulators and, you
know, in the governments do you feel that

00:35:49.730 --> 00:35:54.970
our future will -- where --
where do you see regulation and in our -- in

00:35:54.970 --> 00:35:56.920
our industry and our
business fitting together?

00:35:56.920 --> 00:36:02.089
Do you think the government is going to be
an important protector of

00:36:02.089 --> 00:36:04.740
consumer rights, especially when it comes
to privacy?

00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:07.060
Do you think the government will increasingly
be an inept gate keeper

00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:09.710
of progress?
How do you see that relationship evolving?

00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:14.950
Ken: I think I describe the government in
my book as a "great bear"

00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:18.280
and -- and it can really hurt you, uh, much
more than Microsoft can

00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:24.460
and some of the people you compete against.
And, uh, and it's not just this government.

00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:29.430
It's the European Union, and it's China, and
 -- and Thailand, and

00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:35.830
whatever -- whatever government you go to.
The -- the -- there is a belief that I encountered

00:36:35.830 --> 00:36:39.960
at Google that
things are going to be cool in the future

00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:44.410
because your friend Obama is in
the White House and he made that great talk

00:36:44.410 --> 00:36:48.760
in 2007 at -- in Mountain
View and -- and people loved that.

00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:53.740
And Eric is one of his advisers, and David
Drummond, among others, is a long-time

00:36:53.740 --> 00:36:59.330
fervent supporter.
But I think you, you at your peril would forget

00:36:59.330 --> 00:37:03.910
that Democrats tend to
be in favor of regulation, umm, and -- and

00:37:03.910 --> 00:37:07.440
Republicans tend to be
favor of less regulation.

00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:11.330
And because these issues are so atomic- privacy,
compensation, power,

00:37:11.330 --> 00:37:17.109
copyright- you're going to see more moves
toward regulation.

00:37:17.109 --> 00:37:20.150
And -- and don't forget you've got a lot of
industries who've got a

00:37:20.150 --> 00:37:24.670
lot of power in a place like Washington.
Think about the National Association of Broadcasters.

00:37:24.670 --> 00:37:27.750
Think about newspapers.
What do these people do?

00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:32.150
They have influence on members of Congress
not just because they do

00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:35.300
lobbying, right, and because they make campaign
contributions -- the

00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:40.060
newspapers do less of that -- they have influence
because they are the

00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:42.650
platform for these people to make their public
speeches.

00:37:42.650 --> 00:37:45.690
I want coverage.
So -- and it's not just them.

00:37:45.690 --> 00:37:48.760
It's advertisers, and Microsoft, and a lot
of other companies.

00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:52.540
So you've got a lot of forces out there that
are going to be arguing for

00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:56.090
more regulation.
And so you've just got to be more aware and

00:37:56.090 --> 00:38:00.300
more sensitive as you have
been in the past to this great bear.

00:38:00.300 --> 00:38:03.403
And also the bear can be a dumb bear.
You know?

00:38:03.403 --> 00:38:06.410
Bear often doesn't know what it's doing and
they just wanna do

00:38:06.410 --> 00:38:10.580
something. I mean, and that's another danger.
Umm ...

00:38:10.580 --> 00:38:11.580
&gt;&gt; [Silence]

00:38:11.580 --> 00:38:14.880
&gt;&gt; Hi.
My name's Rob.

00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:17.960
I have a copy of your book --

00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:18.960
Ken: You what?

00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:21.660
&gt;&gt; I have a copy of your book next to my bed.
I'm just getting through Bill Simmons' Basketball"

00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:22.770
book first but
yours is next.

00:38:22.770 --> 00:38:27.720
Umm, my question is perhaps a little more
specific version of that

00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:31.300
question.
And, umm, I know Microsoft in the 90s, early

00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:34.720
90s, would have been
flabbergasted if you had told them that the

00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:40.570
specific practice of
bundling internet explorer with Windows was

00:38:40.570 --> 00:38:46.750
monopolistic.
We- I think in this company also -- we would

00:38:46.750 --> 00:38:50.050
also have a similar view that
we're not really doing anything monopolistic

00:38:50.050 --> 00:38:53.430
or that denies choice.
What's -- but what specifically do you think

00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:57.250
is our blind spot in
terms of a prac -- a specific practice that

00:38:57.250 --> 00:38:59.340
we engage in that you
think people perceive as monopolistic or is

00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:02.330
going to expose us to
antitrust scrutiny?

00:39:02.330 --> 00:39:05.310
Do you have any ideas on that?

00:39:05.310 --> 00:39:09.130
Ken: Uh, I -- I -- I don't think -- I think
Microsoft was a monopoly.

00:39:09.130 --> 00:39:14.170
Umm, I don't think you are.
I mean, I think -- I'm much more prone to

00:39:14.170 --> 00:39:17.670
accept Eric Schmidt's
argument that people are one click away from

00:39:17.670 --> 00:39:18.710
changing their search
engine.

00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:23.970
I don't think you lock people in.
Umm, I think, though, that -- that you -- you

00:39:23.970 --> 00:39:27.690
would miss something
that's historically true in America, that

00:39:27.690 --> 00:39:31.140
people are afraid of power.
And people tend not to like power.

00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:34.750
Just look at the debate on Wall Street about
Wall Street today in

00:39:34.750 --> 00:39:37.510
America.
There's a tremendous rise -- and you see it

00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:41.640
in the attacks on -- on
the Secretary of Treasury yesterday in the

00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:46.490
Congress.
There's a tremendous rise of populous outrage

00:39:46.490 --> 00:39:48.630
that you save Wall
Street: what about us?

00:39:48.630 --> 00:39:51.840
What have you done?
And the true is, the Obama administration

00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:56.310
set out not to save Wall
Street but to save the American economy and

00:39:56.310 --> 00:39:59.170
Wall Street, they felt,
had to be saved.

00:39:59.170 --> 00:40:06.480
They're not naturally prone to love Wall Street.
But nevertheless if you did a survey or a

00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:09.990
poll today I think you would
find a majority of people think we -- we bailed

00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:13.850
out -- unfairly bailed
out Wall Street and that's a reflection in

00:40:13.850 --> 00:40:18.330
part not just of the
economic climate of the times but about power.

00:40:18.330 --> 00:40:22.200
And you have power.
You have, you know, dominance in search, you

00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:27.160
have all this information
on people in the data that you've collected,

00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:30.880
uh, you're expanding
into other industries which displaced them

00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:36.770
and arouse fears.
So fear is something you can't quantify but

00:40:36.770 --> 00:40:39.800
it's there.
And it's historically there in America about

00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:41.440
power but you -- you've
aroused it.

00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:44.630
Do I think you're guilty of -- of abuse of
power?

00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:49.089
No.
I -- I -- in the reporting I did, I didn't

00:40:49.089 --> 00:40:51.050
encounter that.
That okay?

00:40:51.050 --> 00:40:52.050
That answer your question?

00:40:52.050 --> 00:40:54.880
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
I was just interested in if you think we have

00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:56.780
any blind -- specific
blind spots or specific practices that come

00:40:56.780 --> 00:41:03.660
across to you as -- as --
as an observer as sharp or anticompetitive

00:41:03.660 --> 00:41:05.720
and it sound like you don't
think there any.

00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:08.820
Ken: I -- again, anticompetitive I didn't
find but blind spots I

00:41:08.820 --> 00:41:13.339
found.
I report on lots of them in my book, which

00:41:13.339 --> 00:41:17.120
you'll read after you
finish the other one.

00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:18.120
&gt;&gt; [Laughing]

00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:19.380
&gt;&gt; Few days away.

00:41:19.380 --> 00:41:20.380
&gt;&gt; [Quiet]

00:41:20.380 --> 00:41:26.030
&gt;&gt; First of all, thanks again for coming.
Uh, we briefly -- when I was up there -- spoke

00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:30.160
about privacy and the
issues that you've alluded to during your

00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:33.950
speech here.
Umm, one of the other points that you raised

00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:39.390
was the fact that media
needs to figure out additional ways to monetize

00:41:39.390 --> 00:41:43.940
and you also alluded to
the fact that in your visits to Mountain View

00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:46.990
some of the lingo of the
engineers was, you know, incomprehensible

00:41:46.990 --> 00:41:51.829
and I think it is, too, a
lot of us in this room who are non engineers

00:41:51.829 --> 00:41:57.230
but the technology that
we discuss every day, uh, even the non technologists

00:41:57.230 --> 00:42:00.420
among us do
understand it in a way that people outside

00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:05.310
these walls may not.
Umm, I guess a two-part question.

00:42:05.310 --> 00:42:10.620
One, given the fact that media is struggling
to survive in this

00:42:10.620 --> 00:42:15.880
economy, any regulation or a lot of regulation
that's being bandied

00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:20.540
about that focuses on privacy would deprive
media of -- of a revenue

00:42:20.540 --> 00:42:25.589
stream that they currently have.
So, umm, do you think that the regulatory

00:42:25.589 --> 00:42:28.880
environment is being
sensitive to that issue, and secondly --

00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:29.960
Ken: I wanna be sure I understand first that
I understand the

00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:33.460
sensitivity of the issue.
Any regulation of privacy would do what?

00:42:33.460 --> 00:42:38.890
&gt;&gt; I think that certain privacy regulations
that would, uh, decrease

00:42:38.890 --> 00:42:43.790
the ways in which revenue -- that advertising
could be used on certain

00:42:43.790 --> 00:42:48.320
web sites and data can be collected may take
revenue streams away from

00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:50.540
the publishers who are monetizing their inventory.

00:42:50.540 --> 00:42:51.540
Ken: Right.

00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:54.079
&gt;&gt; Umm, and so one -- my question is, one,
do you think that

00:42:54.079 --> 00:42:57.361
regulators are sensitive to that particularly
when media is trying to

00:42:57.361 --> 00:43:00.240
survive.
And then secondly, do you think that they

00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:05.540
understand the technology
well enough to be able to permit certain practices

00:43:05.540 --> 00:43:08.890
that aren't harmful
in the way that they might potentially overshoot

00:43:08.890 --> 00:43:13.099
like we saw in
spyware legislation that brought in technology

00:43:13.099 --> 00:43:15.940
that was not spyware in
the sense that people were concerned about?

00:43:15.940 --> 00:43:20.410
Ken: The answer to your questions are no,
and no.

00:43:20.410 --> 00:43:26.420
And the explanation for those answers are,
every -- every issue --

00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:31.900
most every issue you deal with, the -- the
answer is a balance in one.

00:43:31.900 --> 00:43:36.160
You have rights that are in collision here.
You have industries that are in collision

00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:38.800
here.
And so what you want are sophisticated people

00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:41.220
who can make balanced
judgments.

00:43:41.220 --> 00:43:43.849
The privacy issue.
Umm, yes.

00:43:43.849 --> 00:43:50.480
Behavioral advertising and a lot of other
new ways of targeting

00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:54.660
consumers and making sure there's less waste
in the advertising

00:43:54.660 --> 00:44:00.460
message, uh, are much more efficient.
And -- and -- and you could even imagine -- which

00:44:00.460 --> 00:44:02.481
these people have
talked to me about and I have reported this

00:44:02.481 --> 00:44:07.860
in the book -- you can
imagine a system where they say, "Dear consumer,

00:44:07.860 --> 00:44:10.980
if you will give up a
little of your privacy, we'll be willing to

00:44:10.980 --> 00:44:16.230
subsidize some services to
you that'll help us gather information about

00:44:16.230 --> 00:44:19.079
you and what you like.
You want free HBO?

00:44:19.079 --> 00:44:23.220
Time-warner will give it to you in return
for that."

00:44:23.220 --> 00:44:27.150
We go down a list of things you might subsidize.
It's a balancing act.

00:44:27.150 --> 00:44:31.540
And -- and -- and -- and only government could
 -- can make that

00:44:31.540 --> 00:44:35.200
balancing act.
And -- and then the question is, does government

00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:38.829
have the
sophistication and judgment to do it and will

00:44:38.829 --> 00:44:44.730
it be done in a
thoughtful way or in a kind of rushed, haphazard,

00:44:44.730 --> 00:44:47.760
panicky, political
way.

00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:52.230
And I -- I fear the latter, actually.
Umm, but I think there are really profound

00:44:52.230 --> 00:44:55.440
issues of privacy that are
coming -- you just see what street view.

00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:58.950
I mean, people suddenly are saying what?
What's going on here?

00:44:58.950 --> 00:45:01.490
You know, it's not that anything hideous is
going on.

00:45:01.490 --> 00:45:06.829
but it's a change.
And, I mean, I got the other day a ticket

00:45:06.829 --> 00:45:11.171
in the mail saying --
with -- with three pictures on it and it was

00:45:11.171 --> 00:45:15.210
me -- me -- me in my
car -- you didn't see me but you saw my -- you

00:45:15.210 --> 00:45:20.850
saw my car and you saw
my license plate going -- just -- I was in

00:45:20.850 --> 00:45:22.829
the crosswalk when the red
light had turned.

00:45:22.829 --> 00:45:27.869
So they caught me passing a red light and
they said in print form, uh,

00:45:27.869 --> 00:45:31.700
"Dear Mr. Auletta, you passed a red light
on 68th and Third Avenue,

00:45:31.700 --> 00:45:35.990
these are the pictures.
Uh, it's a 50-dollar fine and no points on

00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:38.710
your license."
They -- they -- they caught me.

00:45:38.710 --> 00:45:41.690
I paid and I went in.
But I was actually astonished by that.

00:45:41.690 --> 00:45:45.250
You know, it's not- and there are pictures
and cameras everywhere.

00:45:45.250 --> 00:45:49.890
And these will increasingly raise issues for
the public and for

00:45:49.890 --> 00:45:52.640
government.
And whether they're dealt with in a balanced

00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:54.339
thoughtful way is one of the
questions.

00:45:54.339 --> 00:45:56.670
But they're -- they're really serious issues
of privacy.

00:45:56.670 --> 00:45:59.670
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.
And I'm certainly not intending to diminish

00:45:59.670 --> 00:46:05.010
the -- the intricacy or
the significance of these issues but there

00:46:05.010 --> 00:46:07.760
is, as you point out, a
degree of understanding that's necessary to,

00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:09.460
uh, make sure the balance
is properly struck.

00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:11.589
Ken: I understand.
What people don't understand is that they

00:46:11.589 --> 00:46:16.710
say we’ll just opt out of cookies you know,
and -- and -- I say, oh really? You want to

00:46:16.710 --> 00:46:19.160
sign on and go through the laborious
process all the time?

00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:22.420
I like it when I go to Google and search and
it gives me "do you

00:46:22.420 --> 00:46:25.390
mean?"
And the only reason that you know that is

00:46:25.390 --> 00:46:28.359
because you know something
about my searches and that's -- that's -- I

00:46:28.359 --> 00:46:32.230
mean, if I say, "jobs"
they know I'm -- I'm inquiring about Steve

00:46:32.230 --> 00:46:33.230
Jobs, not employment.

00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:34.230
&gt;&gt; Thanks again.

00:46:34.230 --> 00:46:35.230
Ken: Thank you.
Hi.

00:46:35.230 --> 00:46:36.230
&gt;&gt; So, one of the teams that I work with is
Google Health and I

00:46:36.230 --> 00:46:39.100
wonder if you had any thoughts on Google's
umm, activities in this

00:46:39.100 --> 00:46:41.600
space.
We're working obviously with personal health

00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:43.020
records, electronic
health records.

00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:47.310
The Obama administration and Washington at
large asked us to weigh in

00:46:47.310 --> 00:46:53.869
a lot.
I just wondered what you thought about that.

00:46:53.869 --> 00:46:59.270
Ken: I think it's great.
I mean, I interviewed the person -- the doctor

00:46:59.270 --> 00:47:04.040
that Google hired to
run the program in Mountain View and I think

00:47:04.040 --> 00:47:07.960
what you're doing, what
Microsoft is competitively doing, I think

00:47:07.960 --> 00:47:11.109
that's fabulous.
I mean, I think some efficiencies are really

00:47:11.109 --> 00:47:15.070
great and serve --
efficiencies are really great and serve the

00:47:15.070 --> 00:47:19.820
public and that's an
efficiency, I mean, that I can have at my

00:47:19.820 --> 00:47:23.270
fingertips, my records that
I can share with doctors or that I can search

00:47:23.270 --> 00:47:25.380
and find relevant
information that relates to my health, I mean,

00:47:25.380 --> 00:47:26.380
it's a miracle.

00:47:26.380 --> 00:47:31.520
&gt;&gt; Do we need to be in that space in that
capacity or should we just

00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:34.440
be doing the trends trends and search-related
health queries and

00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:35.609
things of that nature?

00:47:35.609 --> 00:47:39.630
Ken: If you could do it good -- I mean, the
same question applies to

00:47:39.630 --> 00:47:43.640
Google Books.
I mean, who else was gonna digitize 20 million

00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:45.581
books?
You're willing to do it.

00:47:45.581 --> 00:47:49.180
God bless you.
It's very expensive to do that.

00:47:49.180 --> 00:47:53.070
And so, you know, I don't want government
getting in the way of that and -- and,

00:47:53.070 --> 00:47:56.280
umm, it's real cool.
But then there are going to be some privacy

00:47:56.280 --> 00:48:01.400
issues and they have --
the -- the government referee -- the government

00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:05.330
is -- is not a player
in the game, but a referee and they have to

00:48:05.330 --> 00:48:07.390
blow the whistle if
there's a foul.

00:48:07.390 --> 00:48:12.680
And one of the fouls you look for is privacy.
And -- but you won't understand that privacy

00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:16.359
is changing just as I
learned when I got that ticket in the mail.

00:48:16.359 --> 00:48:20.990
So you want to -- you want to have people
who are thoughtful hopefully.

00:48:20.990 --> 00:48:25.819
But I -- I think what you're doing is great,
personally.

00:48:25.819 --> 00:48:29.999
I -- I said I'd tell one story.
You asked me to tell a story and then I'll

00:48:29.999 --> 00:48:32.550
 -- I'll let you go back to
work and make more money.

00:48:32.550 --> 00:48:38.980
Umm, the reason I didn't put the last chapter
in the book, umm, is

00:48:38.980 --> 00:48:44.619
that I -- it -- it basically is it -- it tries
to distill 25 -- came

00:48:44.619 --> 00:48:48.940
to 25, I didn't know it would -- but I came
up with 25 what I call

00:48:48.940 --> 00:48:53.330
"media maxims" or things that I learned from
visiting your planet but

00:48:53.330 --> 00:48:58.140
also from visiting over the years the different
media planets I've

00:48:58.140 --> 00:49:01.010
covered.
And I -- so I wrote this and I -- I -- it

00:49:01.010 --> 00:49:02.050
was going to be my last
chapter.

00:49:02.050 --> 00:49:04.630
It's one of the things -- one of the interesting
problems you have as

00:49:04.630 --> 00:49:08.670
a writer when you're writing a book about
 -- it's not a biography

00:49:08.670 --> 00:49:13.360
where someone dies and you have the end.
You don't have a natural ending for a book

00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:16.050
like this.
And so I thought maybe the way is to end it

00:49:16.050 --> 00:49:20.010
by -- by doing that rather
than the way I do end it which is the future

00:49:20.010 --> 00:49:22.980
and where -- where things
might be going.

00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:26.080
Umm, but as I wrote it and -- and I was happy
with it.

00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:31.319
It's about 35 pages long I'm -- I'm guessing,
umm, I looked at it and

00:49:31.319 --> 00:49:34.980
I said, I think it -- it -- it breaks up the
narrative.

00:49:34.980 --> 00:49:38.369
The book tends to be a narrative and this
is not a narrative.

00:49:38.369 --> 00:49:42.380
But also it makes it look like it's a -- it's
a how-to book and it

00:49:42.380 --> 00:49:46.830
feels very commercial, as if I'm trying to
get the best of another

00:49:46.830 --> 00:49:51.109
world- meaning selling books in the how-to
section as well as the

00:49:51.109 --> 00:49:54.359
business or sociology section- and I just
felt uncomfortable.

00:49:54.359 --> 00:49:57.069
My editor -- my editor violently disagreed
with me and -- and wanted

00:49:57.069 --> 00:50:01.710
to keep it in.
But basically was a nonquantifiable decision

00:50:01.710 --> 00:50:05.380
that was based on my
instincts, which could be wrong, but they

00:50:05.380 --> 00:50:09.440
were mine and it's my name
on the book so screw the publisher.

00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:10.440
So --

00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:11.440
&gt;&gt; [Laughing]

00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:13.710
Ken: That's why -- that's why it was like
that.

00:50:13.710 --> 00:50:18.020
Anyway, I could not have done a book like
this without the cooperation

00:50:18.020 --> 00:50:21.931
of a company like Google and -- and for that
I'm grateful as I say in

00:50:21.931 --> 00:50:25.690
the book.
I mean, Google was very cooperative.

00:50:25.690 --> 00:50:29.840
Whether -- I would hope that they're not entirely
pleased and I would

00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:32.849
not have done my job as a journalist if -- if
the people you write

00:50:32.849 --> 00:50:35.960
about are entirely pleased and I said that
all the way through --

00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:38.670
through the book.
But it -- it -- you have a miraculous company

00:50:38.670 --> 00:50:41.710
and it was great fun to
visit your planet and now I'll move onto another

00:50:41.710 --> 00:50:42.710
one.
Thank you.

00:50:42.710 --> 00:50:51.049
&gt;&gt; [Applause]
