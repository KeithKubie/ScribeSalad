Carnegie Mellon has a very distinguished

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:04.320
Carnegie Mellon has a very distinguished
 

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.290
Carnegie Mellon has a very distinguished
history and brain research starting in

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:06.300
history and brain research starting in
 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.110
history and brain research starting in
the late 1950s we had some of the most

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120
the late 1950s we had some of the most
 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.180
the late 1950s we had some of the most
prominent people in the world that were

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190
prominent people in the world that were
 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.620
prominent people in the world that were
starting the field of computer science

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630
starting the field of computer science
 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:13.940
starting the field of computer science
and thinking about what we think of now

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950
and thinking about what we think of now
 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.890
and thinking about what we think of now
as artificial intelligence and so this

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900
as artificial intelligence and so this
 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.529
as artificial intelligence and so this
really set the stage that became all the

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539
really set the stage that became all the
 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:19.910
really set the stage that became all the
things we think of as modern brain

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920
things we think of as modern brain
 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.920
things we think of as modern brain
research through the rest of the century

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930
research through the rest of the century
 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.470
research through the rest of the century
and present day the human brain is a

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480
and present day the human brain is a
 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.170
and present day the human brain is a
fascinating device because it's probably

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180
fascinating device because it's probably
 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.820
fascinating device because it's probably
the most complex device in the known

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830
the most complex device in the known
 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.830
the most complex device in the known
universe and it's something that we

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840
universe and it's something that we
 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.510
universe and it's something that we
really don't understand very well at

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520
really don't understand very well at
 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.160
really don't understand very well at
this point but we have all of the

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170
this point but we have all of the
 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.510
this point but we have all of the
potential and all the research that

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520
potential and all the research that
 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.180
potential and all the research that
we're doing to connect all the dots my

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190
we're doing to connect all the dots my
 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.490
we're doing to connect all the dots my
own personal research has to do with

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500
own personal research has to do with
 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.660
own personal research has to do with
understanding the human visual system

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670
understanding the human visual system
 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.060
understanding the human visual system
and I've been interested not in how the

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070
and I've been interested not in how the
 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.979
and I've been interested not in how the
eye works or how the early parts of the

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989
eye works or how the early parts of the
 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.900
eye works or how the early parts of the
visual system work really how you take

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910
visual system work really how you take
 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.340
visual system work really how you take
all that information that's screaming

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350
all that information that's screaming
 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.600
all that information that's screaming
and constantly from your everyday

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610
and constantly from your everyday
 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.370
and constantly from your everyday
experience and turn that into your

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:52.380
experience and turn that into your
 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.340
experience and turn that into your
experience about object scenes people

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350
experience about object scenes people
 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.229
experience about object scenes people
faces all the things that we actually

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239
faces all the things that we actually
 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.389
faces all the things that we actually
think about and then we interact with

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399
think about and then we interact with
 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.040
think about and then we interact with
all the time that really make up or

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050
all the time that really make up or
 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.080
all the time that really make up or
visual world it's really something that

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090
visual world it's really something that
 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.579
visual world it's really something that
provides incredible challenges because

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589
provides incredible challenges because
 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.950
provides incredible challenges because
incredible benefit not only for

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960
incredible benefit not only for
 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.480
incredible benefit not only for
understand the basic science but also

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490
understand the basic science but also
 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.340
understand the basic science but also
thinking about how we can take our

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350
thinking about how we can take our
 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.160
thinking about how we can take our
understanding of human behavior and turn

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170
understanding of human behavior and turn
 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.770
understanding of human behavior and turn
it into benefits for all society

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780
it into benefits for all society
 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.940
it into benefits for all society
