will divulge more about that in the
 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.330
will divulge more about that in the
future as we get closer to it but some

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340
future as we get closer to it but some
 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.000
future as we get closer to it but some
of the projects will involve rod

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010
of the projects will involve rod
 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.860
of the projects will involve rod

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239
months now so I have a huge pile of
 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:36.940
months now so I have a huge pile of
styrofoam pieces that we are going to be

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950
styrofoam pieces that we are going to be
 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.270
styrofoam pieces that we are going to be
able to use so not all of that is going

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280
able to use so not all of that is going
 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.860
able to use so not all of that is going
to go into this particular build but a

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870
to go into this particular build but a
 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.750
to go into this particular build but a
lot of it is going to be used in general

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760
lot of it is going to be used in general
 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.729
lot of it is going to be used in general
for this overall project also all of

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739
for this overall project also all of
 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:50.949
for this overall project also all of
these plastic containers I've got

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959
these plastic containers I've got
 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:54.129
these plastic containers I've got
several bins full of these plastic food

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:54.139
several bins full of these plastic food
 

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:55.839
several bins full of these plastic food
containers I've been saving them all

00:03:55.839 --> 00:03:55.849
containers I've been saving them all
 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:58.360
containers I've been saving them all
over the past few months I also have a

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370
over the past few months I also have a
 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.120
over the past few months I also have a
ton of plastic and PVC pieces that I

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130
ton of plastic and PVC pieces that I
 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.580
ton of plastic and PVC pieces that I
save from other builds or things that

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590
save from other builds or things that
 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.699
save from other builds or things that
are leftover or scrap or sometimes we

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709
are leftover or scrap or sometimes we
 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:08.349
are leftover or scrap or sometimes we
just break down a build and the stuff

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:08.359
just break down a build and the stuff
 

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:11.140
just break down a build and the stuff
that's left over and I have a bunch of

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150
that's left over and I have a bunch of
 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.599
that's left over and I have a bunch of
items that I just found at Goodwill or a

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:13.609
items that I just found at Goodwill or a
 

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:15.729
items that I just found at Goodwill or a
dollar store that I just thought would

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739
dollar store that I just thought would
 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:17.680
dollar store that I just thought would
look interesting different interesting

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690
look interesting different interesting
 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.530
look interesting different interesting
shapes things like

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540
shapes things like
 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.410
shapes things like
in a dollar store this is for your

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:25.420
in a dollar store this is for your
 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:28.470
in a dollar store this is for your
silverware in your drawer but a couple

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:28.480
silverware in your drawer but a couple
 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.510
silverware in your drawer but a couple
of these together give an interesting

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520
of these together give an interesting
 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.550
of these together give an interesting
shape same thing with these dollars to

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560
shape same thing with these dollars to
 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.490
shape same thing with these dollars to
our food trays flipped around you add

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500
our food trays flipped around you add
 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.660
our food trays flipped around you add
different elements to this and make it

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:39.670
different elements to this and make it
 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:41.640
different elements to this and make it
part of something else it kind of blends

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650
part of something else it kind of blends
 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:42.990
part of something else it kind of blends
in it looks come like it could be a

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000
in it looks come like it could be a
 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.480
in it looks come like it could be a
control pad or something like that

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490
control pad or something like that
 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:46.950
control pad or something like that
all of these things make this great

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960
all of these things make this great
 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.290
all of these things make this great
things to work with as you're building

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300
things to work with as you're building
 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:50.730
things to work with as you're building
especially if you're building somewhat

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740
especially if you're building somewhat
 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.280
especially if you're building somewhat
organically and you're kind of thinking

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:53.290
organically and you're kind of thinking
 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.080
organically and you're kind of thinking
like well I need that a piece to fit

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090
like well I need that a piece to fit
 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:57.960
like well I need that a piece to fit
here or a piece to fit there it's kind

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970
here or a piece to fit there it's kind
 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:59.310
here or a piece to fit there it's kind
of fun to play with all these different

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.320
of fun to play with all these different
 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.560
of fun to play with all these different
elements and see what kind of works best

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570
elements and see what kind of works best
 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:02.940
elements and see what kind of works best
for you so one of the first things we're

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:02.950
for you so one of the first things we're
 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:04.080
for you so one of the first things we're
gonna do is paint the walls of the

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090
gonna do is paint the walls of the
 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:06.300
gonna do is paint the walls of the
interior of our corridor I'm probably

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310
interior of our corridor I'm probably
 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.160
interior of our corridor I'm probably
just gonna go with like a flat gray or

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:08.170
just gonna go with like a flat gray or
 

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:10.170
just gonna go with like a flat gray or
something and then you can either go

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.180
something and then you can either go
 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.180
something and then you can either go
lighter or darker from that you want to

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190
lighter or darker from that you want to
 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.730
lighter or darker from that you want to
have elements that are white or you want

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740
have elements that are white or you want
 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.440
have elements that are white or you want
to go darker with darker objects and I

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:16.450
to go darker with darker objects and I
 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:18.090
to go darker with darker objects and I
think the gray will be a nice kind of

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.100
think the gray will be a nice kind of
 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.660
think the gray will be a nice kind of
backdrop to it and it'll give it some

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:21.670
backdrop to it and it'll give it some
 

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:23.550
backdrop to it and it'll give it some
dimension then either way also I want to

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560
dimension then either way also I want to
 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.200
dimension then either way also I want to
point out a way that's kind of going to

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.210
point out a way that's kind of going to
 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.770
point out a way that's kind of going to
be easy to quickly change up how you

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:28.780
be easy to quickly change up how you
 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:34.470
be easy to quickly change up how you
dress your set is magnets so I took a

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:34.480
dress your set is magnets so I took a
 

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.110
dress your set is magnets so I took a
piece of steel flat bar and screwed it

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120
piece of steel flat bar and screwed it
 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.300
piece of steel flat bar and screwed it
right to my wall then I just took a

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:39.310
right to my wall then I just took a
 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.490
right to my wall then I just took a
piece of styrofoam and glued some little

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.500
piece of styrofoam and glued some little
 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:49.220
piece of styrofoam and glued some little
magnets to the corners so you could just

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:49.230
magnets to the corners so you could just
 

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:52.410
magnets to the corners so you could just
throw it up there rearrange it if you

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:52.420
throw it up there rearrange it if you
 

00:05:52.420 --> 00:06:00.840
throw it up there rearrange it if you
wanted

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:00.850
 

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:03.340
pretty easy it works really well with

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:03.350
pretty easy it works really well with
 

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:05.290
pretty easy it works really well with
super light objects like the styrofoam

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:05.300
super light objects like the styrofoam
 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:08.710
super light objects like the styrofoam
or these plastic pieces that I was

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:08.720
or these plastic pieces that I was
 

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.210
or these plastic pieces that I was
talking about I actually just put a

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:10.220
talking about I actually just put a
 

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:13.390
talking about I actually just put a
little piece of self-adhesive magnetic

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:13.400
little piece of self-adhesive magnetic
 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:18.550
little piece of self-adhesive magnetic
strip on the back and then that to just

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:18.560
strip on the back and then that to just
 

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.170
strip on the back and then that to just
throw it up on the magnet now you can

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:20.180
throw it up on the magnet now you can
 

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:21.490
throw it up on the magnet now you can
use the bigger sheets or use them

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:21.500
use the bigger sheets or use them
 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.580
use the bigger sheets or use them
however you want and you can place the

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:24.590
however you want and you can place the
 

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:27.610
however you want and you can place the
flat bar all the way across or in

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:27.620
flat bar all the way across or in
 

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:29.470
flat bar all the way across or in
different sections depending on how you

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:29.480
different sections depending on how you
 

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.300
different sections depending on how you
want to dress it up but this is going to

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:31.310
want to dress it up but this is going to
 

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:33.550
want to dress it up but this is going to
make it much easier to dress and redress

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:33.560
make it much easier to dress and redress
 

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:34.870
make it much easier to dress and redress
your corridor if you're going to be

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:34.880
your corridor if you're going to be
 

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.450
your corridor if you're going to be
shooting multiple scenes and it has to

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:37.460
shooting multiple scenes and it has to
 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:43.600
shooting multiple scenes and it has to
look like multiple corridors just pop

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:43.610
look like multiple corridors just pop
 

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:47.620
look like multiple corridors just pop
that off throw the next pieces on

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:47.630
that off throw the next pieces on
 

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:49.630
that off throw the next pieces on
whatever I will say though that the

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:49.640
whatever I will say though that the
 

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.420
whatever I will say though that the
steel flat bar is rather expensive it's

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:52.430
steel flat bar is rather expensive it's
 

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:53.670
steel flat bar is rather expensive it's
about seven or eight dollars a piece

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:53.680
about seven or eight dollars a piece
 

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.860
about seven or eight dollars a piece
depending on the piece I think this is a

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:56.870
depending on the piece I think this is a
 

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:00.010
depending on the piece I think this is a
four-foot piece that was about eight

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:00.020
four-foot piece that was about eight
 

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:02.650
four-foot piece that was about eight
bucks so it is kind of is kind of pricey

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:02.660
bucks so it is kind of is kind of pricey
 

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:05.200
bucks so it is kind of is kind of pricey
you could just get a roll of steel strap

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:05.210
you could just get a roll of steel strap
 

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:06.730
you could just get a roll of steel strap
but you probably just need to use a

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:06.740
but you probably just need to use a
 

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:08.470
but you probably just need to use a
stronger magnet for that but it would be

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:08.480
stronger magnet for that but it would be
 

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:11.770
stronger magnet for that but it would be
much cheaper I have a few of these I'm

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:11.780
much cheaper I have a few of these I'm
 

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:13.630
much cheaper I have a few of these I'm
going to use and then I'm probably also

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:13.640
going to use and then I'm probably also
 

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:16.240
going to use and then I'm probably also
going to be incorporating the steel

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:16.250
going to be incorporating the steel
 

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:19.090
going to be incorporating the steel
strap and then some other ways we're

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:19.100
strap and then some other ways we're
 

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:21.250
strap and then some other ways we're
just going to be mounting directly on to

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:21.260
just going to be mounting directly on to
 

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.770
just going to be mounting directly on to
the board but for now we're gonna paint

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:23.780
the board but for now we're gonna paint
 

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:27.010
the board but for now we're gonna paint
it all and then we'll start kind of

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:27.020
it all and then we'll start kind of
 

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:29.950
it all and then we'll start kind of
dressing it up and seeing what different

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:29.960
dressing it up and seeing what different
 

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:35.050
dressing it up and seeing what different
stuff you could do

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:35.060
 

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:37.900
all right so I just used a great primer

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:37.910
all right so I just used a great primer
 

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:41.140
all right so I just used a great primer
and two coats kind of did the trick I

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:41.150
and two coats kind of did the trick I
 

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:47.380
and two coats kind of did the trick I
ate some scrap cardboard that I laid out

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:47.390
 

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:50.780
and just start sifting through all the

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:50.790
and just start sifting through all the
 

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:54.560
and just start sifting through all the
pieces and arranging them in a manner

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:54.570
pieces and arranging them in a manner
 

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:57.590
pieces and arranging them in a manner
that looks right to you however you kind

00:07:57.590 --> 00:07:57.600
that looks right to you however you kind
 

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:00.740
that looks right to you however you kind
of just start arranging the pieces in a

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:00.750
of just start arranging the pieces in a
 

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:03.380
of just start arranging the pieces in a
way that looks good to you but I was

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:03.390
way that looks good to you but I was
 

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:27.680
way that looks good to you but I was
like just going with similar patterns

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:27.690
 

00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:30.530
so once I figured out kind of where I

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:30.540
so once I figured out kind of where I
 

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:33.770
so once I figured out kind of where I
wanted all my elements to be I traced

00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:33.780
wanted all my elements to be I traced
 

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:36.170
wanted all my elements to be I traced
along the corners of all of them with

00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:36.180
along the corners of all of them with
 

00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:38.480
along the corners of all of them with
Sharpie markers so I would the placement

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:38.490
Sharpie markers so I would the placement
 

00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:40.880
Sharpie markers so I would the placement
of the different objects was and then I

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:40.890
of the different objects was and then I
 

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:43.730
of the different objects was and then I
used my hot glue gun and went over and

00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:43.740
used my hot glue gun and went over and
 

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:50.580
used my hot glue gun and went over and
glued them all in place

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:50.590
 

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:52.650
you can see what a difference the paint

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:52.660
you can see what a difference the paint
 

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:56.020
you can see what a difference the paint
job men

00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:56.030
 

00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:58.600
now these plastic panels they're already

00:08:58.600 --> 00:08:58.610
now these plastic panels they're already
 

00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:00.790
now these plastic panels they're already
black but I wanted to dull him down a

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:00.800
black but I wanted to dull him down a
 

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:03.130
black but I wanted to dull him down a
bit so I went over them with krylon flat

00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:03.140
bit so I went over them with krylon flat
 

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:11.560
bit so I went over them with krylon flat
black and then I went over that with a

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:11.570
black and then I went over that with a
 

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:13.300
black and then I went over that with a
nickel finish just kind of a light

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:13.310
nickel finish just kind of a light
 

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:14.860
nickel finish just kind of a light
dusting that kind of highlights some of

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:14.870
dusting that kind of highlights some of
 

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:22.750
dusting that kind of highlights some of
the different elements and then kind of

00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:22.760
the different elements and then kind of
 

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:24.810
the different elements and then kind of
give the splash of color I use red oxide

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:24.820
give the splash of color I use red oxide
 

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:27.460
give the splash of color I use red oxide
to kind of give it a little bit of a

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:27.470
to kind of give it a little bit of a
 

00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:32.140
to kind of give it a little bit of a
busted look so when using a Styrofoam

00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:32.150
busted look so when using a Styrofoam
 

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:34.000
busted look so when using a Styrofoam
you can't use spray paint because

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:34.010
you can't use spray paint because
 

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:35.950
you can't use spray paint because
aerosol and the can actually eats the

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:35.960
aerosol and the can actually eats the
 

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:39.630
aerosol and the can actually eats the
foam so I just use the black latex paint

00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:39.640
foam so I just use the black latex paint
 

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:44.290
foam so I just use the black latex paint
give it a base coat you may have to use

00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:44.300
give it a base coat you may have to use
 

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:47.350
give it a base coat you may have to use
two or three coats depending on the look

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:47.360
two or three coats depending on the look
 

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:49.510
two or three coats depending on the look
you're going with or depending on how

00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:49.520
you're going with or depending on how
 

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:58.830
you're going with or depending on how
dense and absorbent that styrofoam is

00:09:58.830 --> 00:09:58.840
 

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:01.110
before that dries using dry brushing

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:01.120
before that dries using dry brushing
 

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:06.910
before that dries using dry brushing
with gray or light blue

00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:06.920
 

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:09.710
kind of highlight all of those edges and

00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:09.720
kind of highlight all of those edges and
 

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:23.920
kind of highlight all of those edges and
raise

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:23.930
 

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:26.940
now I have tons of scrap wire so I took

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:26.950
now I have tons of scrap wire so I took
 

00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:30.580
now I have tons of scrap wire so I took
different colored wires and blue black

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:30.590
different colored wires and blue black
 

00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:34.180
different colored wires and blue black
white yellow and nested it together and

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:34.190
white yellow and nested it together and
 

00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:36.610
white yellow and nested it together and
taped it together so that I'm gonna use

00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:36.620
taped it together so that I'm gonna use
 

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:40.060
taped it together so that I'm gonna use
that to run in between some of the

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:40.070
that to run in between some of the
 

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:41.590
that to run in between some of the
different elements some of the different

00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:41.600
different elements some of the different
 

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:44.320
different elements some of the different
boxes and things and so they can be

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:44.330
boxes and things and so they can be
 

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:45.580
boxes and things and so they can be
hanging and stuff like there's no

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:45.590
hanging and stuff like there's no
 

00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:48.280
hanging and stuff like there's no
ceiling but this will give it an added

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:48.290
ceiling but this will give it an added
 

00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:51.020
ceiling but this will give it an added
texture and give it more of a life to it

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:51.030
texture and give it more of a life to it
 

00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:52.370
texture and give it more of a life to it
this is another way to add some color

00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:52.380
this is another way to add some color
 

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:54.590
this is another way to add some color
and they kind of tied things together

00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:54.600
and they kind of tied things together
 

00:10:54.600 --> 00:11:13.580
and they kind of tied things together
Lieber

00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:13.590
 

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:15.560
so you can start to see some of it

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:15.570
so you can start to see some of it
 

00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:26.749
so you can start to see some of it
coming together a little bit

00:11:26.749 --> 00:11:26.759
 

00:11:26.759 --> 00:11:28.920
