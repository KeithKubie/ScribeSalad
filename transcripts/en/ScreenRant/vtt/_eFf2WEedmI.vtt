00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.560
Making a Star Wars movie is a demanding and
pressure-filled task.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.340
There are millions of people carefully watching
the film’s development, meaning it’s on

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.330
the director and screenwriters to craft a
compelling, entertaining story filled with

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.640
memorable characters.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.810
They’re – justifiably – so concerned
about getting the larger picture down pat,

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.500
that sometimes they can’t catch the tiniest
error while overseeing the final cut.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.029
Here are 10 Star Wars movie mistakes that
slipped through editing.

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:33.700
The Falcon’s Rader Dish – A New Hope

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.340
The design of the Millennium Falcon is extremely
iconic and well known across the globe, including

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.340
its radar dish.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.400
Fans are so aware of that component that J.J.
Abrams made sure to update it for The Force

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.400
Awakens.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.520
But before the Falcon became a part of cinematic
lore, the filmmakers weren’t too concerned

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:49.699
with its overall look.

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:54.690
When it’s first shown in the 1977 original,
the radar dish is nowhere to be seen, magically

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.670
appearing when the ship reaches space.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.640
No explanation is provided, and with all the
alterations this movie has seen in the years

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.539
since, it’s surprising George Lucas never
fixed this.

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.760
Captain Antilles Returns from the Dead – A
New Hope

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.150
Darth Vader is firmly established as an intimidating
villain in his first few moments of screen

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.410
time, particularly when he chokes and kills
Captain Antilles with his bare hands.

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.050
When the Rebel captain is dead, Vader tosses
his body aside towards a wall.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.940
Though Antilles is supposed to be dead, the
actor clearly raises his hands for protection

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.000
as he makes impact.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.900
Conceivably, multiple takes of the scene were
done, but this was the one that made the finished

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:26.900
film.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:27.900
Maybe there was no way around it.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.950
It’s probably better for the actor to use
his hands quickly than get a face full of

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:31.950
wall.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.350
Han’s Carbonite Pose – The Empire Strikes
Back

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.130
Han Solo being frozen in carbonite is one
of the most emotional moments in the entire

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.210
saga, and viewers were probably too caught
up in his wellbeing to notice that his hands

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.710
change positions before and after the process.

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.960
As Han is enters the chamber, his hands are
visibly in handcuffs, and they are never removed.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.560
When his frozen body is shown for the first
time, the cuffs are no longer there and his

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.970
hands appear to be grasping something.

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.740
It is jarring to see, and it’s a mystery
that will most likely never be solved.

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.050
Perhaps the handcuffs are adverse to cold
temperatures?

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.480
C-3PO’s Breathing – The Empire Strikes
Back

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.240
Anthony Daniels was the perfect pick to play
protocol droid C-3PO, but even he couldn’t

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.350
truly master portraying the character in a
deactivated state.

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.830
When his constant worrying annoys Han and
Leia, C-3PO is switched off so the two can

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:15.830
have a talk in peace.

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.060
If you watch C-3PO closely, you’ll notice
that he’s moving in the background – an

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.200
indicator of Daniels’ breathing – instead
of being completely still.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.939
It’s understandable that Daniels couldn’t
hold his breath for the entire time, but with

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:31.790
a massive budget, they could have built a
model of the droid to avoid any problems.

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.129
Luke the Ventriloquist – Return of the Jedi

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:38.049
Luke is apparently so skilled with the Force,
he can use it to speak without moving his

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:39.049
mouth.

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:42.489
As he looks to make a daring escape of Jabba’s
barge with Leia, Luke tells his sister, “Come

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:44.670
on” before the two swing off to safety.

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.280
Though audiences hear Mark Hamill deliver
the line, it’s obvious that the actor did

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.950
not actually say it while on set.

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.349
His lips do not move during this part, creating
a glaring audio error that’s never been

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:57.349
fixed.

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:00.269
Most likely, this was a result of dubbing
in post, but somebody should have told Hamill

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:03.469
to at least mouth the line so it looked natural
on screen.

00:03:03.469 --> 00:03:05.980
Inverted Starship Controls – The Phantom
Menace

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.770
When young Anakin stays in a fighter cockpit
to stay safe from the fight, things don’t

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:13.150
go according to plan and he ends up in a space
battle with R2-D2.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.469
Once the autopilot is overwritten, he plays
around with the controls to get a feel for

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:17.469
his new ride.

00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:20.120
He tries to do a spin move, turning the steering
mechanism to the left.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.100
But the vehicle spins to the right.

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.950
This is particularly egregious since right
before this sequence, Anakin turned the ship

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.989
left by moving the steering mechanism in that
direction.

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:33.730
One of the moves is incorrect, an unintended
question George Lucas never meant to pose.

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.730
Walking Through Doors – Attack of the Clones

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.480
The prequels pushed the boundaries of digital
filmmaking, and while the spectacle was impressive,

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:41.890
it wasn’t always seamless.

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.980
After landing on Geonosis, Anakin and Padme
enter the underground droid factory.

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.670
When the door opens, they have to duck to
get through.

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.599
While Natalie Portman is able to enter without
any issues, the taller Hayden Christensen

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:53.599
wasn’t so lucky.

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:56.810
Though he does lower himself, it wasn’t
far enough, and his head goes through the

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:58.230
digital door that was created in post.

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.709
A lot of work goes into adding CGI, but it
couldn’t have been too hard to slightly

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:05.099
alter this so it wasn’t so noticeable.

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:07.279
Obi-Wan’s Clean Clothes – Revenge of the
Sith

00:04:07.279 --> 00:04:11.689
After a lightsaber duel on a volcanic planet,
one would expect that your outfit would suffer

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:15.810
some damage, especially in a physical confrontation
like Anakin vs. Obi-Wan.

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.200
Yet, when Kenobi comes back on board the ship
to leave Mustafar, his costume has little-to-no

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.750
indication of a titanic struggle, appearing
relatively clean.

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.920
Later on, when Obi-Wan discusses what to do
with the Skywalker twins with Yoda and Bail

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.920
Organa, his costume sports several dirt and
burn marks, which should have been present

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:32.920
earlier on.

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.180
Obi-Wan probably didn’t get burned on his
ship, so he must have suffered these on Mustafar.

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.070
Finn’s Disappearing Blaster – The Force
Awakens

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:44.310
When landing on Takodana, Han Solo gives Finn
a blaster for protection, which he carries

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:45.310
with him at all times.

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:48.730
He’s shown holding the blaster when Maz
Kanata gives him Luke’s old lightsaber to

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:52.730
give to Rey, but when the First Order bombs
Maz’s castle, Finn remarks that he needs

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:55.850
a weapon to defend himself, before learning
that the lightsaber is a weapon.

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.920
Since the blaster was on Finn at all times,
it’s odd that it’s all of a sudden missing

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:04.250
when he needs it the most, with no explanation
provided for why it’s gone.

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.410
Boarding the Falcon’s Ramp – The Force
Awakens

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:11.090
During their hectic escape from Jakku, Rey,
Finn and BB-8 are left with no choice but

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.780
to give the Millennium Falcon a shot and see
if it will fly.

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:17.210
When the trio approaches the ship, the come
to the ramp from the right side of it.

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:20.120
Yet, when the characters are shown boarding
the Falcon, they’re coming from the left

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.160
side of the ramp.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:25.310
Given that they were in a life-or-death situation,
it seems odd they would run all the way around

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:26.950
to get on their only option available.

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:30.070
Chalk this one up to the dangers of splicing
multiple takes.

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:33.090
Those are our picks for Star Wars movie mistakes
that made it through editing.

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:34.150
Are there any we missed?

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:37.440
Which ones do you notice every time you journey
to a galaxy far, far away?
