00:00:03.734 --> 00:00:06.334
Narrator: SENIOR RESEARCH
ENGINEER KURT LONG

00:00:06.334 --> 00:00:09.934
HAS KINDLY OFFERED HIS MINIATURE
WIND TUNNEL FOR TESTING.

00:00:11.334 --> 00:00:13.467
Long: HERE WE GO.

00:00:13.467 --> 00:00:14.868
PERFECT.

00:00:14.868 --> 00:00:17.501
ALL RIGHT, JUST BOLT IT DOWN,
AND WE'RE READY TO GO.

00:00:17.501 --> 00:00:20.567
BUT READY TO GO
WITH WHAT EXACTLY?

00:00:20.567 --> 00:00:23.300
THIS MAY LOOK PRETTY COOL,
BUT I ASSURE YOU THAT YESTERDAY,

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.968
THIS WAS NOTHING BUT A BIG SHEET
OF STEEL WITH POTENTIAL.

00:00:26.968 --> 00:00:28.567
Narrator:
AND IT DIDN'T TAKE LONG

00:00:28.567 --> 00:00:30.968
FOR THAT STEEL
TO FULFILL ITS POTENTIAL,

00:00:30.968 --> 00:00:33.601
TRANSFORMING
INTO A SMALL-SCALE HOUSE.

00:00:33.601 --> 00:00:35.467
LIKE MOST SIMPLE HOMES,

00:00:35.467 --> 00:00:38.667
IT'S GOT FOUR WALLS,
A ROOF, AND SOME WINDOWS.

00:00:38.667 --> 00:00:42.200
BUT THIS IS
AN ENGINEERING MARVEL.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.734
ALL OF THE WALLS OF THE HOUSE
HAVE A HINGE ALONG THE BOTTOM,

00:00:44.734 --> 00:00:47.667
AND THAT ALLOWS THE WALL
TO FLEX IN AND OUT.

00:00:47.667 --> 00:00:49.634
AND BECAUSE WE'VE ATTACHED
A CYLINDER INSIDE

00:00:49.634 --> 00:00:51.901
THAT'S FILLED WITH A BLUE FLUID,

00:00:51.901 --> 00:00:53.767
WHEN THE WALL MOVES IN OR OUT,

00:00:53.767 --> 00:00:56.467
IT PUSHES THAT CYLINDER
UP OR DOWN,

00:00:56.467 --> 00:01:00.701
WHICH MOVES THIS BLUE FLUID
IN THE HOSE UP OR DOWN.

00:01:00.701 --> 00:01:03.200
NOW, BECAUSE THE CYLINDER
IS ACTUALLY QUITE LARGE

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.167
AND THIS HOSE IS QUITE SMALL,

00:01:05.167 --> 00:01:07.634
WE GET A LOT OF MOVEMENT
ON THE HOSE

00:01:07.634 --> 00:01:10.868
THAT WE CAN SEE CLEARLY
WITH RELATIVELY LITTLE MOVEMENT

00:01:10.868 --> 00:01:12.367
ON THE WALL.

00:01:12.367 --> 00:01:15.267
Narrator: EACH WALL
AND THE ROOF IS COLOR-CODED,

00:01:15.267 --> 00:01:17.934
SO THE BLUE WATER
RUNS UP A CLEAR TUBE

00:01:17.934 --> 00:01:21.434
TO MATCH A CORRESPONDING COLOR
ON THE BIG BOARD.

00:01:21.434 --> 00:01:24.267
THAT WAY, THEY CAN SEE
EXACTLY WHICH WALL

00:01:24.267 --> 00:01:27.901
IS FEELING THE FORCE OF THE WIND
WITH WINDOWS OPEN OR CLOSED.

00:01:27.901 --> 00:01:31.100
THIS STEEL BOX RIGHT HERE
IS OUR TEST PLATFORM

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.634
FOR MONITORING PRESSURES
ON A HOUSE

00:01:33.634 --> 00:01:36.300
WHEN THE WINDOWS ARE OPEN
OR CLOSED IN A WINDSTORM.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.767
IT'S GOT FOUR WINDOWS,
ONE ON EACH SIDE,

00:01:38.767 --> 00:01:42.834
AND WE CAN OPEN THEM BY REMOVING
ANY WHICH ONES WE WANT.

00:01:42.834 --> 00:01:46.334
Narrator: TIME TO TEST
THE RELATIVE PRESSURES

00:01:46.334 --> 00:01:48.901
FROM SEVERAL
HURRICANE WINDOW SCENARIOS,

00:01:48.901 --> 00:01:52.234
AND WE'LL KICK IT OFF
WITH A TOTAL LOCKDOWN.

00:01:52.234 --> 00:01:55.033
Jamie: NOW, THIS TEST
IS WITH ALL WINDOWS CLOSED,

00:01:55.033 --> 00:01:57.901
AND THIS WILL BE OUR BASELINE
FOR ALL THE OTHER TESTING.

00:01:59.701 --> 00:02:01.601
Narrator:
KURT STARTS THE SUCTION,

00:02:01.601 --> 00:02:03.767
RAISING THE WIND SPEED
IN AN INSTANT

00:02:03.767 --> 00:02:05.434
TO 60 FEET PER SECOND.

00:02:07.767 --> 00:02:10.901
THE TALE OF THE TURBULENCE
COULDN'T BE MORE CLEAR.

00:02:10.901 --> 00:02:12.767
JAMIE, THERE YOU GO.

00:02:12.767 --> 00:02:14.467
WITH ALL WINDOWS CLOSED,

00:02:14.467 --> 00:02:17.067
THE FRONT WALL BORE
THE BRUNT OF THE BLAST,

00:02:17.067 --> 00:02:20.400
THE ROOF BEGAN TO LIFT,
AND THE BLUE WATER WENT WILD.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.000
THE ROOF IS LIFTING
JUST A LITTLE BIT.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.601
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT WE'D EXPECT.

00:02:25.601 --> 00:02:27.567
I THINK WE'RE GOOD.
WE CAN BRING IT DOWN.

00:02:27.567 --> 00:02:29.133
THAT'S PERFECT.

00:02:29.133 --> 00:02:30.834
LET'S CUT IT.

00:02:30.834 --> 00:02:33.067
Narrator: SO THEY STOP
THE MINI-HURRICANE,

00:02:33.067 --> 00:02:36.501
RESETTING THE TINY HOUSE
WITH ALL WINDOWS OPEN.

00:02:36.501 --> 00:02:38.067
Adam: SO, THE MYTH IS

00:02:38.067 --> 00:02:39.834
THAT LEAVING YOUR WINDOWS OPEN
IN A HURRICANE

00:02:39.834 --> 00:02:42.501
WILL RESULT IN LESS
STRUCTURAL DAMAGE TO YOUR HOUSE.

00:02:42.501 --> 00:02:45.501
IF THIS MYTH IS TRUE,
WHEN WE RUN THIS TEST

00:02:45.501 --> 00:02:48.367
WITH ALL THE WINDOWS
OF OUR TEST HOUSE OUT,

00:02:48.367 --> 00:02:51.434
WE SHOULD SEE A LOT LESS
MOVEMENT OF ALL THE SIDES.

00:02:51.434 --> 00:02:52.734
Narrator: ONCE AGAIN,

00:02:52.734 --> 00:02:56.234
KURT CRANKS THE BREEZE
UP TO 60 FEET PER SECOND.

00:02:56.234 --> 00:02:57.901
[ LAUGHS ]

00:02:57.901 --> 00:03:00.868
AND THE MOVEMENT, AS PREDICTED,
IS MINIMAL.

00:03:00.868 --> 00:03:05.634
THE WALLS AND THE WATER
BARELY BUDGE.

00:03:05.634 --> 00:03:07.501
THAT'S COMING DOWN
JUST A HAIR.

00:03:07.501 --> 00:03:09.467
YEAH.

00:03:09.467 --> 00:03:11.367
A LOT LESS STRESS
WITH THE WINDOWS OPEN.

00:03:11.367 --> 00:03:12.901
YEP.

00:03:12.901 --> 00:03:17.167
SO WINDWARD SIDE PUSHED IN
8 1/2 INCHES.

00:03:17.167 --> 00:03:19.300
A LOT LESS
THAN LAST TIME.

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.133
THE ROOF PUSHED UP
JUST A TINY BIT.

00:03:21.133 --> 00:03:23.000
EVERYTHING WAS LESS.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.200
EVERYTHING WAS LESS WITH THE
WINDOWS OPEN RATHER THAN CLOSED.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.400
Narrator: AND THAT'S GOOD NEWS
FOR THE MYTH.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.601
WITH ALL WINDOWS OPEN,

00:03:29.601 --> 00:03:32.434
SOME OF THE WIND BLEW
CLEAN THROUGH THE HOUSE.

00:03:32.434 --> 00:03:34.701
LESS PRESSURE
ON THE WALLS AND ROOF

00:03:34.701 --> 00:03:36.300
SHOULD MEAN LESS DAMAGE.

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.667
BUT THIS TYPHOON TEST ISN'T
RESTRICTED TO ALL OR NOTHING.

00:03:40.667 --> 00:03:41.868
NEXT.

00:03:41.868 --> 00:03:44.968
ONLY THE WINDWARD WINDOW OPEN.
ALL THE OTHERS CLOSED.

00:03:44.968 --> 00:03:49.267
ADAM AND JAMIE TRY OUT A RANGE
OF SINGLE-WINDOW OPTIONS.

00:03:49.267 --> 00:03:52.367
FIRST, THEY JUST OPEN
THE ONE UP FRONT.

00:03:52.367 --> 00:03:55.100
60 FEET A SECOND.
ZERO.

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.200
[ LAUGHS ]

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.334
THEN THEY TRY A SIDE WINDOW.

00:03:58.334 --> 00:03:59.901
BEAUTIFUL!

00:03:59.901 --> 00:04:03.834
AND FINALLY THEY REMOVE
THE ONE OUT BACK.

00:04:03.834 --> 00:04:07.801
[ Aussie accent ] I FEEL LIKE
I'M BIRTHING A MECHANICAL COW.

00:04:07.801 --> 00:04:12.934
BUT ALL WINDOWS OPEN IS STILL
BY FAR THE BEST OPTION.

00:04:12.934 --> 00:04:15.701
[ Normal voice ] NOTHING,
NOTHING, NOTHING, NOTHING.

00:04:15.701 --> 00:04:17.434
IT'S ALL
IN THAT FRONT SPACE.

00:04:17.434 --> 00:04:18.400
YEAH.

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.901
I'VE SEEN EVERYTHING
I NEED TO SEE.

00:04:19.901 --> 00:04:20.701
YOU WANT TO CALL IT?

00:04:20.701 --> 00:04:21.367
YEAH.

00:04:21.367 --> 00:04:22.567
ALL RIGHT.

00:04:24.267 --> 00:04:26.534
Adam: THE SINGLE WORST THING
YOU CAN DO IN A WINDSTORM

00:04:26.534 --> 00:04:30.734
IS OPEN THE WINDWARD-SIDE WINDOW
AND NONE OTHER.

00:04:30.734 --> 00:04:32.434
YOUR HOUSE FEELS LIKE A BALLOON.

00:04:32.434 --> 00:04:35.467
IT PUTS THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT
OF STRESS ON THE STRUCTURE.

00:04:35.467 --> 00:04:37.968
IT TURNS OUT
THAT IN THIS TEST,

00:04:37.968 --> 00:04:40.501
THE LEAST AMOUNT OF STRESS
ON YOUR HOUSE

00:04:40.501 --> 00:04:44.300
WILL RESULT FROM YOU OPENING
ALL OF YOUR WINDOWS.

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:45.634
HMM.
