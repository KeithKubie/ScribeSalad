00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.180
Solve for a and
check your solution.

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.054
And we have a plus
5 is equal to 54.

00:00:06.054 --> 00:00:07.470
Now, all this is
saying is that we

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.310
have some numbers,
some variable a.

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:13.484
And if I add 5 to
it, I will get 54.

00:00:13.484 --> 00:00:15.400
And you might be able
to do this in your head.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.820
But we're going to do it a
little bit more systematically.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.570
Because that'll be
helpful for you when we

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.070
do more complicated problems.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.361
So in general, whenever you
have an equation like this,

00:00:23.361 --> 00:00:24.930
we want to have the variable.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.670
We want this a all by itself
on one side of the equation.

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.360
We want to isolate it.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:32.819
It's already on
the left-hand side,

00:00:32.819 --> 00:00:34.360
so let's try to get
rid of everything

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.490
else on the left-hand side.

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.490
Well, the only other thing
on the left-hand side

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:38.580
is this positive 5.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.440
Well, the best way to get rid
of a plus 5, or a positive 5,

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.910
is to subtract 5.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.300
So let's subtract 5.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.110
But remember, this says
a plus 5 is equal to 54.

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.180
If we want the
equality to still hold,

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.430
anything we do to the left-hand
side of this equation,

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.550
we have to do to the right
side of the equation.

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.660
So we also have to
subtract 54 from the right.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.090
So we have a plus 5 minus 5.

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.030
Well, that's just
going to be a plus 0.

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.080
Because if you add 5 and you
subtract 5, they cancel out.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.400
So a plus 0 is just a.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.520
And then 54 minus 5, that is 49.

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.220
And we're done.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.975
We have solved for a.

00:01:16.975 --> 00:01:19.460
A is equal to 49.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:20.810
And now we can check it.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.270
And we can check it by
just substituting 49 back

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.100
for a in our original equation.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.600
So instead of writing a
plus 5 is equal to 54,

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.040
let's see if 49 plus
5 is equal to 54.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.010
So we're just
substituting it back in.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:39.920
49, 49 plus-- let me do that
in that same shade of green.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.730
49 plus 5 is equal to 54.

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:45.270
We're trying to check this.

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.210
49 plus 5 is 54.

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.140
And that, indeed,
is equal to 54.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.080
So it all checks out.
