analogy to another sport I think that's
why I appreciate college basketball more

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500
why I appreciate college basketball more
 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.640
why I appreciate college basketball more
than than NBA because the kids in

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650
than than NBA because the kids in
 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:08.990
than than NBA because the kids in
college I mean they make more mistakes

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000
college I mean they make more mistakes
 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.460
college I mean they make more mistakes
and so you can almost relate to them

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470
and so you can almost relate to them
 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.219
and so you can almost relate to them
more and so when there's I don't know

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229
more and so when there's I don't know
 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.080
more and so when there's I don't know
what the pros they never miss baskets

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090
what the pros they never miss baskets
 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.999

you know the NBA guys and and there's

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009
you know the NBA guys and and there's
 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.230
you know the NBA guys and and there's
like they're doing things that most

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240
like they're doing things that most
 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.060
like they're doing things that most
average people can I feel like with

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070
average people can I feel like with
 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.399
average people can I feel like with
soccer like I touched upon earlier like

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409
soccer like I touched upon earlier like
 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.230
soccer like I touched upon earlier like
anybody of any shape or size can play

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240
anybody of any shape or size can play
 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.060
anybody of any shape or size can play
and so they feel like they can do what

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070
and so they feel like they can do what
 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.859
and so they feel like they can do what
we can do and they probably could if

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869
we can do and they probably could if
 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.530
we can do and they probably could if
they practice and got fit and you know I

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540
they practice and got fit and you know I
 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.730
they practice and got fit and you know I
well I don't wanna say it's that easy

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740
well I don't wanna say it's that easy
 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.170
well I don't wanna say it's that easy
but because then it doesn't make me look

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180

a nice shiny career and it's
 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.570
a nice shiny career and it's
disappointing obviously you don't want

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580
disappointing obviously you don't want
 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.490
disappointing obviously you don't want
that to happen you know in terms of like

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500
that to happen you know in terms of like
 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.969

kind of the cheap cheap shots I've been
on a lot of ends of that to have broken

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450
on a lot of ends of that to have broken
 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.350
on a lot of ends of that to have broken
my jaw twice and so you know I've been

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360
my jaw twice and so you know I've been
 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.600
my jaw twice and so you know I've been
on the end of some stuff but it's part

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610
on the end of some stuff but it's part
 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.430
on the end of some stuff but it's part
of it they could probably cut out that

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440
of it they could probably cut out that
 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.990
of it they could probably cut out that
but I don't know how they can police

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000
but I don't know how they can police
 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.309
but I don't know how they can police
that without having more referees on the

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319
that without having more referees on the
 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:20.110
that without having more referees on the
field and nobody wants more referees on

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120
field and nobody wants more referees on
 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.120
field and nobody wants more referees on
the field so you know that's always

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130
the field so you know that's always
 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.699
the field so you know that's always
going to exist you know the strongest

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709
going to exist you know the strongest
 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:26.199
going to exist you know the strongest
are going to survive that people can

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209
are going to survive that people can
 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:29.500
are going to survive that people can
deal with that still find success
