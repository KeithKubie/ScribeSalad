00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.740
Do you ever anticipate a problem like with guys that are supposed to be fighting

2
00:00:04.741 --> 00:00:08.130
each other?
You know,
like what just happened with Mazda doll recently?

3
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.490
Like we're an actual fist fight breaks out,
man,

4
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.210
you find most of these guys wanna get paid to fight,
not pay the fight.
Right.

5
00:00:15.211 --> 00:00:19.440
But when you see like cameras are on,
they're not.
So yeah,
that fight with w yeah,

6
00:00:19.441 --> 00:00:21.120
that's true.
Right.
When the cameras aren't on.

7
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.280
The other thing is when you're leading into a fight,

8
00:00:23.281 --> 00:00:26.760
my thought was you cannot let that person think the intimidated you.

9
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.610
And if that means you actually have to hit them,
maybe it does.
But the,
the,

10
00:00:29.611 --> 00:00:33.150
you know the ideas that I can't let you think that you have a mental advantage,

11
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.020
right.
In any other sports.
So we know why I ever want to see that.
Like,
dude,

12
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.830
it's just like you gotta stop that.
But in fighting it's like,
oh,

13
00:00:40.831 --> 00:00:44.190
they're just doing extra fighting.
Yeah.
Right,
right.
I was like,

14
00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.000
you guys are getting paid.
Yeah.
Look it was a basketball player,

15
00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.940
sucker punches another basketball player in the face and some sort of press

16
00:00:50.941 --> 00:00:55.470
conference like that,
like Mazda doll did.
I mean,
you'd be like,
what?

17
00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.200
No Way.
But in fighting like,
oh,
these are the extra fighting,

18
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.580
but you don't,
you don't connect for buddy or extra credit for do.

19
00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:05.700
But let's be honest,

20
00:01:05.701 --> 00:01:09.340
people like to offer that performance was going to get extra money.

21
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.760
Just stunning knock out of Darren tills,

22
00:01:11.761 --> 00:01:14.540
one of the top guys in the welterweight division,
the weight Kao.

23
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.950
Then it was crazy.
So he got it from that.

24
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.550
And then to tee off on Leon Edwards after the fight like that,

25
00:01:20.551 --> 00:01:25.440
it's like another one,
like that's part of that is very good for him,

26
00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.310
unfortunately.
Like I don't want him to do that and I,
I don't wanna encourage,

27
00:01:29.311 --> 00:01:33.450
but if you want to think about like a fighter's popularity building,

28
00:01:33.451 --> 00:01:37.290
their brand brown,
he's an,
I don't give a fuck,
I'll punch you in the face guy.

29
00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.550
And they're like,
well,
a lot of people are now.
He's a real,
I don't give a fuck.

30
00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.910
I'll punch you in your face guy.
They're real.
They're really exist.

31
00:01:44.911 --> 00:01:49.110
And he's a world class fighter.
Like that's a,
that's sellable.
It's unfortunate.

32
00:01:49.111 --> 00:01:51.370
I wish guys wouldn't ever fight at press conference.

33
00:01:51.371 --> 00:01:54.060
It's like Cormier and Jon Jones.
I fucking hated that.

34
00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.090
But tell me that didn't sell more tickets.
No doubt.

35
00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.800
That's sold a shitload more tickets.
How many times they throw out,

36
00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.720
show Connor thrown that Dolly.

37
00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.200
How many times they show that even in the Promos,
I hated when that happened.

38
00:02:08.201 --> 00:02:11.200
There was a terrible thing that Conner did that Goddamn,

39
00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.950
that's sold some tickets.
That's a,
that's a fine line.
Right?

40
00:02:13.951 --> 00:02:18.330
That's kind of a funny thing.
People that weren't even involved got cut.

41
00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.910
You got hit with glass.
It's got canceled on me that,
I mean,
using it promoted.

42
00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.120
Yes,
yes,
yes.
Yeah.
We just tried to avoid it and hide it.

43
00:02:27.121 --> 00:02:31.270
Or do we let people know that this is a real thing?
They call all,

44
00:02:31.271 --> 00:02:34.620
all people involved.
Go,
look,
this is a business.
We're here to get paid.
Okay,

45
00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.690
we're gonna run it.
We're gonna run it every 15 minutes.

46
00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.430
I'm going to show that Dolly Smash.
Oh,
and that's we'll Harris's company.

47
00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.860
Is that the,
the the gentleman,
what is it?

48
00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.250
What is it called and not to me of a fighter.
Yes.

49
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.270
That's his youtube show that I often thought was a UFC show.

50
00:02:51.271 --> 00:02:52.890
I didn't even know that he had his own show.
