00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.970
And of course, this is a bit of a nitpicker question but it equals O(1.3câ‚„^n&lt;i&gt;n to some constant)&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:15.380
and the reason being is that 4/3 is equal to 1.3333, of course, this goes on infinitely,

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.280
and for O notation to be correct, of course, you have to round up,

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.630
no matter what the digit is that you're rounding.

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.930
So the expected running time for this algorithm here is actually exponential in n.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.770
Now, you might be asking--well, okay, so we know that three SAT is solvable in exponential time,

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.410
now we introduce randomness, which means we're not even sure that we're finding

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.680
the satisfying assignment, at least not totally sure, and we're still ending up

00:00:38.680 --> 99:59:59.000
with exponential running time, so what's the deal here.
