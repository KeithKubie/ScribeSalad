00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:05.680
Video games get a bad rap, but can they cause
seizures?

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:14.060
Hello Everyone, Crystal your friendly neuroscientist
here for DNews to talk videogames and epilepsy.

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:18.240
Normally, the activity in your brain is a
lot of neurons firing at different times.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.500
The activity of these neurons are highly regulated
and there are inhibitory systems in place

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.770
to make sure they don’t fire out of control.

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:29.240
Right now many of your brain regions are active
processing this stimulating video, but they

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.460
are all working independently of each other.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.280
In some cases though, a glitch can occur and
the activity syncs up.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.380
When this happens it can trigger what we know
as a seizure.

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.269
Seizures are often described as a storm of
concerted brain activity with all circuits

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:43.609
firing in rhythm together.

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:48.930
There are many different types of seizures,
and not all lead to a diagnosis of epilepsy.

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.829
Epilepsy is a disorder characterized by a
specific form of recurring seizure, a reduced

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.579
seizure threshold, and it usually requires
an electroencephalogram (EEG) or neuroimaging

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:57.579
for diagnosis.

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:02.709
It might come as a surprise but over the course
of a lifetime 4% of our population will experience

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:07.369
epilepsy and it is the fourth most common
neurological disorder on par with dementia

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:08.369
and stroke.

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.060
What does this have to do with video games?

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.890
Well, somehow it seems that certain types
of repetitive sensory stimuli can trigger

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.210
a seizure, and pulsing light, like the flashes
from a computer or television screen can fit

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.210
the bill.

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.409
About 3 percent of people with epilepsy, and
some individuals without, experience photosensitive

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:26.299
seizures in response to flashing light.

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:30.079
These types of seizures are more common in
children and adolescents, the portion of the

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:33.290
population for whom video games are the greatest
concern.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.600
Many people don’t know that they are sensitive
to flickering lights until they experience

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.600
a seizure.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.070
Factors that can trigger a photosensitive
seizure are 1) how quickly the light flashes,

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.159
2) the intensity of the flashing lights, 3)
the distance between the viewer and the light

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:47.899
source, and 4) the color or wavelength of
the light.

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:52.320
Any repetitive visual stimuli can trigger
seizure, video games are seen as frequent

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.210
culprits, but the incidence of these seizure
events has been on the rise since the advent

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.290
of television in the 1950s.

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.710
In the 90’s there was a famous Japanese
incident in which over 600 children experienced

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.150
seizures and were hospitalized after watching
a saturday morning Pokemon cartoon, and in

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.600
the UK a noodle commercial that triggered
seizures led to increased regulations for

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.300
broadcast television.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.410
Here in the united states, seizure warnings
are becoming more and more common, but we

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.150
have yet to enact the regulatory approaches
taken by the UK and Japan.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.780
It is important to note that isolated seizures
caused by a distinct visual triggers are not

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.170
enough for an epilepsy diagnosis.

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.280
So to say videogames cause epilepsy is a bit
misleading.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.170
But they can cause seizures!

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.360
And these episodes can occur when they are
least expected are not without consequence.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.880
Repeated seizure activity can lead to cognitive
impairment, behavioral abnormalities and even

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:41.880
brain damage!

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.290
So the next time you sit down at a computer
or television screen just know that you might

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.740
be putting your brain at risk for much more
than just a good time.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.330
