00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:06.790
It is a quirk of our minds that not every
emotion we carry is fully acknowledged, understood

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:12.849
or even truly felt. There are feelings that
exist in an ‘unprocessed’ form within

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:19.720
us. A great many worries may, for example,
remain disavowed and uninterpreted and manifest

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:26.680
themselves as powerful directionless anxiety.
Under their sway, we may feel a compulsive

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:33.100
need to remain busy, fear spending any time
on our own or cling to activities that ensure

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:39.380
we don’t meet what scares us head on (these
might include internet pornography, tracking

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:48.659
the news or exercising compulsively). A similar
kind of disavowal can go on around hurt. Someone

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:55.120
may have abused our trust, made us doubt their
kindness or violated our self-esteem but we

00:00:55.120 --> 00:01:01.179
are driven to flee a frank recognition of
an appalling degree of exposure and vulnerability.

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:08.939
The hurt is somewhere inside, but on the surface,
we adopt a brittle good cheer (jolliness being

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:15.369
sadness that doesn’t know itself), we numb
ourselves chemically or else adopt a carefully

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:21.310
non-specific tone of cynicism, which masks
the specific wound that has been inflicted

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:30.100
on us. We pay dearly for our failure to ‘process’
our feelings. Our minds grow unoriginal from

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:36.540
a background apprehension as to their contents.
We grow depressed about everything because

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:43.719
we cannot be sad about something. We can no
longer sleep, insomnia being the revenge of

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:51.740
all the many thoughts we have omitted to process
in the day. We need compassion for ourselves.

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:57.649
We avoid processing emotions because what
we feel is so contrary to our self-image,

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:03.619
so threatening to our society’s ideas of
normality and so at odds with who we would

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:10.250
like to be. An atmosphere conducive to processing
would be one in which the difficulties of

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:19.200
being human were warmly recognised and charitably
accepted. We fail to know ourselves not out

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:29.560
of laziness or casual neglect; it simply hurts
a lot. Processing emotions requires good friends,

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:35.959
deft therapists and ritual moments like Philosophical
Meditation, in which our normal defences can

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:43.410
safely be put aside and unfamiliar material
ring fenced for investigation. The outcome

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:50.379
of processing our emotions is always an alleviation
in our overall mood. But first we must pay

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:56.221
for our self-awareness with a period of mourning
in which we gradually acknowledge that, in

00:02:56.221 --> 00:03:03.200
some area or other, life is simply a lot sadder
than we would want it to be
