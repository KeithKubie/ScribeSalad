I'd heard the story
about this battle,

00:07:16.811 --> 00:07:18.563

were all so caught up

00:07:18.563 --> 00:07:21.608

covering where were the WMDs,

00:07:21.608 --> 00:07:24.653

those questions.

00:07:28.657 --> 00:07:31.242
And I think, for them
and for their spouses,

00:07:31.242 --> 00:07:34.079

was healthy and helpful.

a hundred yards that way.

civilian bridge to the military.

I could talk to the spouses

fired a weapon at an enemy

by the enemy.

eight main characters

puzzle to put together.

from the work on "Mad Men"

multiple times,

00:15:44.527 --> 00:15:46.654
went back out in the field
to rescue these guys

00:15:46.654 --> 00:15:49.490

into the eye of the storm.

pretty good.

ALANNE: Robert Miltenberger,
to me, is one of the most

00:15:59.584 --> 00:16:01.252
fascinating characters
in this story.

00:16:01.252 --> 00:16:03.379
He's deeply embittered
by the fact

00:16:03.379 --> 00:16:06.007
that he's been stop-loss,
and on top of that,

00:16:06.007 --> 00:16:07.842

that he's going to die.

SISTO: It's pretty impressive,

00:16:09.844 --> 00:16:11.971
the fact that you were able
to carry out in that.

of all that, was, uh...

00:16:15.474 --> 00:16:17.685

surprised, me, too.

SISTO: Robert actually is,
in some ways,

00:16:30.698 --> 00:16:32.575
healthier than
some other soldiers

aware of the sadness,

a weeklong boot camp

the basic infantry skills --

weapons handling, tactics,
things like that --

00:19:07.772 --> 00:19:09.732

the weight and the gravity

were representing.

ALANNE: They have been
such amazing partners.

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:20.983
From the very beginning,
they were attracted

00:23:20.983 --> 00:23:23.527
to the ambition and
complexity of the project.

00:23:23.527 --> 00:23:25.404
SALOMON: Action!
(machine-gun fire)

00:23:25.404 --> 00:23:28.657
BONILLA: National Geographic is
famous for telling the truth.

00:23:28.657 --> 00:23:30.492
I love that they're
making honest, real,

00:23:30.492 --> 00:23:32.328
hard-hitting television.

00:23:32.328 --> 00:23:36.624
This is the closest we can get
without being there ourselves.

00:23:36.624 --> 00:23:39.209

00:23:39.209 --> 00:23:42.671
BOURQUIN: They ambushed us
to draw out the rescues.

00:23:42.671 --> 00:23:44.340
Now they're gonna come
for us for real.

00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:46.133
ALANNE: When you watch it,
you literally feel

00:23:46.133 --> 00:23:48.677
that you are trapped in the
situation with our characters.

00:23:48.677 --> 00:23:50.846
AGUERO: We got to move!
RADDATZ: You will feel

00:23:50.846 --> 00:23:55.059
exactly what those soldiers
and what those families felt.

00:23:55.059 --> 00:23:57.353

00:23:57.353 --> 00:23:59.521
KELLY: The events
of April 4, 2004,

00:23:59.521 --> 00:24:01.398
happened so quickly
and instinctively

00:24:01.398 --> 00:24:04.818
that their true impact could
only be revealed in hindsight.

00:24:04.818 --> 00:24:07.696
What has emerged, looking back
all these years later,

00:24:07.696 --> 00:24:11.158
is a portrait not just
of courage and sacrifice,

00:24:11.158 --> 00:24:13.577
but one of family...
GARZA: You doing all right?

00:24:13.577 --> 00:24:15.621
KELLY: ...not just at home
and on the front lines,

00:24:15.621 --> 00:24:18.248
but now on both sides
of the camera, as well.

00:24:18.248 --> 00:24:20.501
SALOMON: Action.

00:24:20.501 --> 00:24:22.711
KELLY: It is a bond that serves
as a fitting tribute

00:24:22.711 --> 00:24:25.881
to the memory
of those who were lost.
