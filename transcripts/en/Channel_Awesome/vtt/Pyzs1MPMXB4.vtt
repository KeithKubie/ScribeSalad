00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:40.580
Critic: Wait a minute!

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.880
Where's the crawl? And the Star Wars title, and the big music?

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.400
Well, it's a different kind of Star Wars movie.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:47.900
D'ahh!

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.240
You see, this isn't part of the trilogies that spanned three generations.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.500
This is more of a spinoff film.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.220
It's a story that stands on its own, but also happens to be in the same universe.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.000
Hence the title. Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.840
Ok, Chris, why the hell are you talking like that?

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.240
Like what?

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:07.240
Like I'm somehow in front of you even though I'm clearly to your left.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.480
That's just the Chris Stuckman tradition.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.160
I always address the camera with my edited thoughts.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.700
It's kind of... the Chris Stuckmann way!

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.860
Yeah, well, how about the Star Wars way, and we have an opening crawl?

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.380
I told you, Critic, it's not that kind of movie.

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.800
Rogue One is the first of what is currently an unending series of Star Wars Universe films.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.960
While the trilogies will continue to follow the stories of the characters we know and love from the first movie,

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.200
these will be more background stories.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.060
Think of them as the appendix in The Lord of the Rings.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.040
A way to get more history of fictional events and characters.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.860
They're standalone films that give us more information on a world we can't get enough of.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:51.560
So the idea of cutting out the crawl is just a way to show it's one of the many side stories that's yet to come.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.700
But we had another holiday theme! A Star Wars Solstice.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.500
This is totally gonna ruin next year when we do

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.700
a Star Wars Feast Day Of Our Lady Of Guadalupe.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.940
Look, this is just what Star Wars is now.

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.340
It can't be any worse than the changes they made in the past.

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.820
No, this is MY show, and I want a crawl!

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.420
Let 'er roll!

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.300

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.300
Now that's more like it!

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.560
WHOAAAAA!!!!

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.500
[thud, thud]

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.460
Hey! What's the holdup?

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.460
I'm sorry, we're only making letters float through space!

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.100
If you can think of a better way to make letters float through space,

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.400
then I'd like to see it!

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.540
GRRRHHHHHH!!!

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.540
Well, I guess we're stuck here for a bit.

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.760
Hey, look! I'm a kitty cat!

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.000
Knock that off!

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.500
While we're waiting for the crawl to get fixed, I guess we should go ahead and start the review.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.380
You got it!

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.700
Stop that!

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.360
This is Rogue One.

[dramatic music]

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.320
Sir, why did we park so far away?

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.260
Chris: So a young brunette girl with a British accent is separated from her family

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.380
as she spends most of her life with no direction, trying to cope with that tragic day.

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.820
Actually, that was Rey's character from Force Awakens.

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.380
Oh yeah, duh! How did I get those two mixed up?

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:17.760
[clears throat]

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.800
Chris: So a young brunette girl with a British accent is separated from her family

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:27.580
as she spends most of her life with no direction, trying to cope with that tragic day.

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.540
Not that Star Wars doesn't have a lot of repeat, but don't you think that's a little cut-and-paste?

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.540
Oh, I'm sorry. I guess the young American guys didn't get enough attention.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.100
Critic: Ok.
Chris: Fair enough.

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.100
Critic: After cheerfully accompanying the Rebel Alliance,

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.640
Jyn is taken to their headquarters where one of Rebels named Cassian

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.880
reveals that her father Galen is the architect of a new weapon called the Death Star.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.880
The man who raised you named Saw --

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:49.740
[snort] His name is Saw?

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.820
Trust me, you'll forget all these names once the movie is over.

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.000
-- has secret information from your father.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.420
We're hoping you can infiltrate him to figure out what it is.

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.860
Well, I don't want to, but I guess I have no choice.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.440
Critic: Now, how long did it take to say all that? Less than a minute?

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.280
Chris: I guess.

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.640
Critic: So, why does it take us less than a minute

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.580
and the movie a DOZEN minutes to say the same thing?!

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.360
This movie goes beyond taking its time.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:16.520
It stretches out so much info for a story we already kind of have figured out.

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:19.940
It's like watching it in slo-mo yet they somehow talk in normal speech.

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:21.560
Chris: Some of it doesn't even add up,

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.320
like when this pilot named Rook

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.760
wants to defect for the Rebellion, yet Saw doesn't trust him,

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.780
so they hook him up to a lie detector squid.

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:34.080
Saw: This squid can sense your feelings,

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.420
your lies, and your inner thoughts.

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:40.180
Ok... how does he do that?
-- I don't know.

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.740
Where did you find him?
-- I don't know.

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.940
Why does he want to help you out?
-- I don't know.

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.860
What'll you do if I'm lying or not lying?
-- I don't know.

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.120
What DO you know?
-- I really like tentacle hentai.

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.500
Ughh, that's gross!
-- LIES!

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.960
Chris: It also doesn't help that this movie jumps all over the place.

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:00.020
It seems like every other minute, it cuts to a new planet or solar system.

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.200
I'm taking you to Rebel headquarters.

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.920
I'm taking you to find Saw.

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.940
I'm taking you to the Death Star.

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.220
I'm taking you out to lunch.

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:16.160
I completely forgot why we came here.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.320
That's right, lunch!

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.680
It's like they're trying to make a simple story seem bigger by constantly trying to seem angry and busy.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.480
Ah, the George Costanza method.
-- Basically.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:32.140
Chris: Thankfully, their team is full of people who distract from that like K-2SO.

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.080
Critic: Who's kinda like C-3PO if they sucked out all the pussiness.

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.940
Greetings and salutations. I am C-3P--

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:41.680
Ohhhh, piss off, you pansy! Suck my big black rod!

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.220
Chris: There's also a freedom fighter named Baze

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:49.240
whose philosophy is shoot first, ask questions in... whatever this world calls hell.

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.360
Critic: Actually, I think it's just hell.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:56.000
Chris: So this universe has both angels and hell, yet no Christianity?

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.560
Critic: Keep with the Midichlorian Church.

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.720
Critic: And then of course there's the blind warrior named...

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.460
Umm... yeah. I'm just calling him Toff.

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.580
Chris: But the downside is, while many of them are entertaining,

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:09.660
we don't really know that much about them.

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:11.980
We have no idea how these two know each other.

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:14.360
Why the pilot Rook defected.

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.680
Or why the hell Squidward was in this movie!

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:20.800
Critic: Dude, you gotta let that go.
Chris: NO! What... WAS that??

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:26.840
Why was that in the movie?! Stop putting scenes with tentacles your movies. They don't work!

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:29.880
Critic: It might be a good thing not knowing their stories though,

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:33.880
as when you do, it almost makes us less interested in them somehow.

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:36.060
-- I'm kind of angry with you.
-- I'm kind of angry with you too.

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:38.420
-- I thought you were my kind-of father.
-- I thought I kind of raised you.

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:42.700
-- I thought we had a kind of connection.
-- Kind of! -- Kind of! -- Kind of!

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:46.160
Saw: Wow, we went over everything, and I feel like, no attachment.

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.380
Yeah, I'm not gonna miss you when you die.
-- Speaking of which...

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:51.340
Whoa! Hoh... all right.

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:54.020
Chris: That blast, by the way, was a test by the Death Star

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:56.700
done by General Krennic and Grand Moff Tarkin.

00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:00.940
Critic: Wait a minute. How did they do that if Peter Cushing is dead?

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:04.000
-- Oh, no, not!
-- That's right! Digital Talkin' Tarkin!

Oh, God! It's like Jeff Bridges from Tron Legacy mixed with Jim Carrey from A Christmas Carol.

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:15.700
Well, it's actually not THAT bad.

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:19.220
Sometimes.

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:23.640
The CG is very impressive. It always looks like somebody's really there.

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:27.560
But the uncanny valley distracts from ever fully accepting it.

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:29.080
Critic: Sometimes he looks convincing,

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:34.140
but the rest of the time, you'd swear they put the fake lips of John Lennon from Forrest Gump on there.

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:36.820
Make it so they have nothing left on that planet.

Dismissed.

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:44.480
Critic: Ugh, good, at least the scene is over.

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:48.220
Oh, and don't forget, we have like five more meetings in the next 24 hours.

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:49.260
UGGGHHHHHH!!!!

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:53.700
That's the other thing. He's in this film... a LOT.

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:57.200
Chris: It kind of makes you wonder why they didn't just replace him with Darth Vader

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:59.980
who's only given less than 10 minutes in the movie.

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:03.820
He's one of the most famous villains who always wears a mask.

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:06.100
Why not use this guy as much as possible?

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:11.680
Critic: Well, to be fair, it might be because James Earl Jones's voice is sounding a little tired

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:13.680
after doing it all these years.

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.820
Vader: Oh my God, are they still making these?

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:18.640
Ok, where's the script. How many lines do I have?

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:22.540
What? That's it? Christ, I was in The Sandlot longer.

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:25.380
What am I, literally just taking a bath while I'm
off-screen?

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:27.580
Ok, ok. *clears throat*

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:29.900
Look here, General Krennic.

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:32.260
Krennic? What the hell kind of name is that?

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.560
It's like in one ear and out the other, forgotten.
I forgot I even said it.

00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:39.060
Oh, fuck it. Just don't have me scream "noooo" and we'll be good.

00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:43.280
Chris: I don't care if he sounds old. He's Darth Vader!
We deserve more of him.

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:48.000
Remember when this guy directed Aaron Taylor Johnson, also starring Godzilla?

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.240
Oh, that Godzilla movie that had almost no Godzilla!
-- Right!

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:55.820
Oh yeah, but to be fair, that movie had such bland main characters

00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:58.940
that just weren't that interesting and you couldn't get sucked into.

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:01.920
You see where I'm going with this?
-- Yeah.

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:03.920
Critic: While the side characters work well enough,

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:06.780
our main leads are mostly pretty flat.

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:12.100
It's almost like they were given direction to not be awful, but not be interesting either.

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:13.740
How do you know your father's not the enemy?!

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:15.480
I saw his message. He's on our side!

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:16.800
-- Is that so?
-- Yes!

[subdued] Yes. In a totally passable yet unexceptional way.

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:26.920
I am passionate about this... but not too passionate

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:28.440
in case we're all to die at the end.

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:31.480
Right, so the people don't get too depressed

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:35.680
we can still market this as a deep, yet enjoyable adventure.

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:39.620
Oh, did I mention we have toys?

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:45.660

[Nostalgia Critic theme sting plays]

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:03.520
Jyn's father is killed by the Empire as, once again,

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:06.780
it doesn't seem as emotionally investing as it probably should be.

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:10.840
Jyn, I put a weakness in the Death Star so small

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:12.840
that they'll never notice it.

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:17.100
In fact, it's so small, that every time they build a new one,

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:19.100
it'll have the exact same weakness.

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:20.540
Really? They never catch on?

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:25.780
They use Jolly Ranchers for badges. They're not exactly the brightest stars in the solar system.

00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:28.380
Ok, I'm dead now.

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:30.740
Nooooooooo!!!

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:31.500
[buzzer]

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:33.120
Oh, I mean... uh...

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:35.880
[fake] No... father... whatever.

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:39.860
Chris: Upon finding out that the Rebels don't want to sneak in to get the plans for the Death Star,

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:43.640
our team decides to go it alone and get it themselves.

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:45.500
[on radio] You on that ship, what's going on?

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:47.940
Uh, everything's under control, situation normal.

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:48.940
[on radio] What happened?

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:52.460
Uh, had a slight weapons malfunction but we're perfectly fine here.

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:56.380
We're all fine here, now, thank you... how are you?

00:10:56.380 --> 00:11:00.060
[on radio] What's your ship name? It better sound poetic and look good on a poster.

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:02.200
Our name? Uhh...

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:04.420
Just think of something. Hurry!

00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:05.240
Uhh...

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:10.460
Rogue One.

00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:15.280
[on radio] Rogue One? That sounds like a so-so comic series that was never given time to bloom.

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:17.280
Well, it makes more sense than just coming up with it out of the blue.

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:18.200
[blaster sound]

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:20.780
Boring conversation anyway. We're gonna have company!

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:23.940
Chris: So Rogue One goes to the Empire's base steal the plans,

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:28.580
the Rebels eventually end up joining them and...

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:31.100
Critic: You know how Force Awakens was friggin' awesome

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:33.160
but the climax was kind of... meh?

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:37.720
Chris: Rogue One was kind of meh, but the climax was friggin' awesome!

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:40.860
Critic: If you wanna know the truth, we haven't gotten a great space battle

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:42.480
since Return of the Jedi.

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:44.720
We did eventually get a good Star Wars film,

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:49.400
but the space battles were still usually too busy with too much clutter going on.

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:53.660
Chris: This follows one ship at a time again, making it feel like you're there.

00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:57.380
In fact, a lot of it really feels like you're in the action because of the exciting,

00:11:57.380 --> 00:11:59.580
even realistic way it's shot.

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:02.740
Critic: But it doesn't just stop there. It moves it to the next level.

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:06.140
Chris: You know how, in Return of the Jedi, they smash a Star Destroyer,

00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:08.660
which, by the way, never destroys any stars.

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:11.460
Ironic because they have a weapon that destroys planets.

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:14.660
In fact, doesn't Death Star and Star Destroyer kind mean the same thi--

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:16.340
Critic: Ahem!
Chris: Anyway...

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:19.420
You remember how it smashed into the Death Star in a giant blaze.

00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:22.380
Well, in this one, a ship pushes it in just the right place,

00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:26.360
crashes into another Star Destroyer, which crashes into the shield blocking the planet,

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:30.320
and just before another one shows up, crashing into a dozen other ships!

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:32.600
It's AMAZING!!!!

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:35.780
This does still raise the question, though...

00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:40.460
If Vader is in this movie, why isn't he down there on that beach kicking ass?

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:43.900
Stormtrooper: Uh, hello... sand?

00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:45.900
Krennic: Oh, right. He hates sand.

00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:48.160
Stormtrooper: It's so coarse and rough and irritating.

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.000
Krennic: And it gets everywhere.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.480
Stormtrooper: He has posters, like, all over the place. How could you miss this?

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:55.740
Krennic: Ugh, I guess I'll have to go down there.

00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:57.400
Stormtrooper: Don't you have like a million Stormtroopers?

00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:00.380
Krennic: Yeah, but I can actually hit something!

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:02.600
Stormtrooper: What an asshole.

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:05.300
Chris: However, Darth Vader comes back.

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:08.220
Critic: By God, does he come back!

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:11.440
Chris: Just when you think he contributed nothing to this movie...

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:14.680
Critic: He comes aboard one of the ships and is like...

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:19.280
Vader: I have come to deliver the most awesome scene in the movie.

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:22.300
[lightsaber sound]
[dramatic music]

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:25.320
Vader: Yeah, no. This is nothing. This is literally nothing.

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:27.960
I can do this with no hands. Watch.

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:34.240
Ahh, yeah, mmm, get down, uhh, wah, yeah.

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:37.200
My saber is also great at making people shorter.

00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:45.040
And you. You you you you! You belong on the ceiling!

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:47.880
Check it out, check it out. I'm not even looking at you. I'm not even LOOKING at you!

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:51.500
That's how easy this is! I'm so COOL!

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:54.980
Huh, look at his punk ass. Looks like Rebel Kool-Aid.

00:13:56.440 --> 00:14:01.880
Ohh, that's right, bitches. I'm stopping that with my hand. With my goddamn hand!

00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:03.320
But you know what they say,

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:07.480
what goes in, must come out. Out my ass. OK, here we go, everybody.

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:12.360
I am fucking amazing.

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:15.400
Ohh, whatchu gonna do, whatchu gonna do? Shit's getting hot in here, huh?

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:19.760
Oh, ok, yeah, we're gonna duke it out.
We're gonna duke it out!

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:22.140
You're a tough guy, huh? Oh, I'm so scared!

00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:24.320
Darth Vader's gonna die from your pussy fists!

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:26.480
You're gonna save the galaxy with those hands, right?

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:28.180
Oh wait, I forgot, I can choke a bitch.

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:40.640
Dark Side, motherfuckers.

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:47.000
Both: Ahhhhhh...

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.900
Critic: So umm... yeah, that was the greatest Darth Vader scene in all movie history.

00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:58.800
Chris: Despite all the film's flaws, it gave us two solid minutes of holy-shitness.

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:02.120
Critic: And speaking of flaws, there are still a few before we wrap up,

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:05.280
like how the emotional highlight is supposed to be the death of our two leads

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:08.160
you're not really gonna lose sleep over.

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:11.200
Jyn: You won't miss us.
Cassian: But you didn't dislike us either.

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:13.320
Jyn: Our job is complete.
[ding]

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:15.720
Chris: And because the Tarkin wasn't freaky enough,

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:19.580
we also get a CGI Princess Leia to top it all off.

00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:22.700
Critic: Oh, Christ, just tell me they do it better than Tarkin.

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:27.340
Chris: Sometimes it looks better, and sometimes it looks worse. It's kinda weird.

00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:30.760
Critic: How long is she on screen?
Chris: About ten seconds.

00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:34.280
Critic: How can there be such a drastic change in only ten seconds?

00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:40.360
Both: Ehh, it's not bad... pretty good... it's actually not bad...

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:44.620
Chris: FUCK! NO! SHIT DAMMIT!
Critic: No no no no no no no...

00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:48.640
Both: Uhh, that's pretty good, better than the... everything and the...

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:52.600
Chris: Ohh FUUUUUUCK!
Critic: No no no no no no no!

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:56.260
Leia: We have a new hope.
Critic: You need an exorcist.

00:15:56.260 --> 00:16:00.020
Thus the Rebels head off with the plans, and the film comes to a close.

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:06.820
And we were in this tooooo... !

00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:13.220
Critic: And that was Rogue One.
Chris: The most above average Star Wars prequel.

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:17.740
Chris: The film has famously gone through rewrites and reshoots, and it clearly shows.

00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:21.700
A lot of the time it feels all over the place, but some of the places they go to

00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:23.880
have some great atmosphere and action.

00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:28.960
The biggest problem is the characters aren't as memorable or fun as some of the other films,

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:31.800
meaning it doesn't feel as large or epic.

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:37.200
There's certainly problems with it, but it's hard to say there aren't a lot of cool scenes that overshadow them.

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:41.540
Critic: It's not fun, per se, but it is... cool.

00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:46.840
It's definitely more aggressive and like an actual war, and that oftentimes make the world feel more real.

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:51.920
It never quite goes too aggressive, but it doesn't really take any chances either.

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:54.980
There's no surprises, and you get exactly what you expect,

00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:59.520
but what I expected wasn't that bad, so I enjoyed myself fine.

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:02.840
It's a perfectly OK movie.

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:03.460
[mechanical elevator noise]

00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:05.460
Chris: Oh good, they got the crawl working!

00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:06.560
Critic: Oh, it's about time.

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:10.580
[Star Wars-like music plays]

00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:54.980
You know, this does raise a good question.

00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:58.620
What if we do get too many Star Wars movies?

00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:02.680
Critic: I mean, before, Star Wars was gigantic, whether it was loved or hated.

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:05.820
But, what if it just becomes OK?

00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:10.680
What if it's not great, not awful, it's just... average?

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:14.260
What if it becomes like every other franchise?

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:18.940
Chris: You know, before the prequels, there were a lot of cool Star Wars stories.

00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:24.340
Books, video games, comics, and a lot of them had a wide variety of acceptance.

00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:28.240
Some were great, some were awful, but some were just... OK.

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:33.000
So you see, Critic, Star Wars was a franchise before it was a franchise.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.880
Critic: Huh, I never thought of it like that.

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:39.860
And yeah, we'll always have the original movies... ish.

00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:42.480
I guess that does count for something.

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:48.160
Chris: You know, Critic, no matter what, Star Wars will always be special.

00:18:55.580 --> 00:19:01.060
Critic: But will we ever get a Darth Vader scene as cool as the one in this movie?

00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:07.260
Chris: Look, Darth Vader is one of the best villains of all time. They could do anything with him.

00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:12.020
Who knows what's on the horizon that is Star Wars?

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:18.120
Critic: Like what?

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:22.140
Chris: OK, I felt like we were at a good spot there. It was a good spot to stop.

00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:24.380
Critic: Really? I wasn't feeling that.

00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:26.500
Chris: Oh, you weren't feeling that.
Critic: Like, like what?

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:31.120
Chris: Uhh... they could CG a cartoon face on Bea Arthur.

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:33.120
Critic: Wow, that'd be amazing!

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:34.780
Chris: Yeah, ok, we'll stop there.

00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:38.460
Critic: More.
Chris: Ok, I really need an out. I need an out.

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:46.140
Vader: Yeah, I can fly too, bitches. I'm AMAZING!!!

00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:51.720
I'm Chris Stuckman, and I can breathe in space for some reason.

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:47.000
Dude, that's it. We're done.

00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:52.320
Nothing more. That's the last review of the year.

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:58.200
I don't know what else you're expecting. That's it. We're done. I'll see you in January.

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:01.760
Wait a minute. Next month is January.

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:04.380
You know what that means!

00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:07.820

00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:10.980

00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:16.140
AAAAHHHHHH!!!!!

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:20.240
Vader: Dark Side, motherfuckers.
