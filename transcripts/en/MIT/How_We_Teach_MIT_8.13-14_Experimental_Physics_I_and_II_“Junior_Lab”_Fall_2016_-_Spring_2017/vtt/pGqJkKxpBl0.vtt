ATISSA BANUAZIZI: When
students give their oral exams,

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.490
they are presenting the
results of their experiment

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.910
to their faculty member, their
professor for that section,

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.240
and typically also for the TA.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:21.820
And so they have an audience
of about two people.

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.830
Not very big.

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.870
And in that oral exam, they give
the presentation pretty much

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.030
straight without interruption.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:35.110
Then they get a Q&amp;A session
from the professor and the TA.

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.740
And then they may also typically
get a lot of immediate feedback

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.320
from the professor
about how well it went

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.600
and some suggestions for
how to do better next time.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.490
In the moment, it
can be hard for them

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:50.170
to process all of that.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.530
Some little time following that
they will make an appointment

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.130
with me and we will
sit down and watch

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:59.830
the digital video
that was produced

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:01.450
when they gave their talk.

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.190
And typically on
another monitor,

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.170
we will have the
actual slides that they

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.106
use to give the presentation
so we can really sync that up.

00:01:08.106 --> 00:01:09.730
This gives them the
opportunity to look

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.340
at their video in a
more objective way.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.260
It's not immediately
afterwards, they've

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.044
had some time to
think and process.

00:01:18.044 --> 00:01:19.960
They have a chance to
think about the comments

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.190
of their instructor through
this new lens, of somebody

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.190
who's actually watching
their own work.

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.280
We ask them to reflect on sort
of what their experience was

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.660
in the moment.

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.840
And then we sit down
and watch the video.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:41.260
And we'll typically stop and
sort of debrief a little bit

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.510
when we notice things.

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.540
And I'll ask them to talk
about what they notice

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.817
and I'll tell them
what I notice.

00:01:48.817 --> 00:01:50.650
And then when we're
done watching the video,

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.680
we might go over some of the
individual slides in some more

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.060
detail.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.140
And then we brainstorm
together about things

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.560
that they would want to
focus on for next time,

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.650
particular issues that
they might have had,

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.840
ways that they can
strategize about improving

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.880
that for the next
round of presentations.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.160
So this all happens after the
first ungraded oral exam on one

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.950
of their practice experiments.

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.590
But the process of
giving the oral exams

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.600
continues throughout
the semester.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.540
And some of them choose
to meet optionally

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.250
with me before
their presentations

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.130
if they want to do a
dry run or rehearsal.

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.724
Some of them will choose to meet
with me immediately afterwards.

00:02:33.724 --> 00:02:35.140
But the next thing
that's actually

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.440
built into the schedule
comes much closer

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.690
to the end of the semester.

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.030
At this point, they've given
their three oral exams.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.390
And they get to choose their
favorite one to present

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.520
for a larger audience.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.640
And once they've made that
choice, they meet with me

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.220
and we do pretty much the same
thing, we look at the video,

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:55.540
we look at the slides.

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.850
Only this time, it's with
an eye towards revising it

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:01.200
for public consumption
and a bigger audience.
