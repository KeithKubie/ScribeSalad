00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.080
Fillings may soon be a thing of the past!

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:05.450
Thank goodness cuz the only kind of filling
I need in my life is the kind that goes in

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:06.990
pie.

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:14.340
Hey everyone, Laci Green here for DNews.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.520
Cavities have got to be one of the worst parts
of being a human.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.840
I've only had one filling in my life when
I was like 12 and I'm still mildly traumatized.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.069
But thank goodness -- fillings may be a thing
of the past in as soon as 3 years!

00:00:25.069 --> 00:00:26.929
What a time to be alive!

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:30.289
Researchers at King's College London have
created a device that can fix cavities by

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:33.270
spurring teeth to repair themselves instead.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.680
The current procedure for treating tooth decay
is based on some pretty primitive stuff actually

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.520
-- it's basically the same today as the original
procedure discovered in 1875.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.530
The tooth decay is drilled out and then the
hole is filled back up.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.170
Back in the day, the hole in your tooth was
filled with silver, but now they're filled

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:48.500
with amalgam or resin.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.890
The new procedure is called Electrically Accelerated
and Enhanced Remineralization, and it basically

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.990
sidesteps the drilling and filling phases
altogether by using an electrical current

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:58.290
that remineralizes the tooth.

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:59.530
There are two steps.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.220
First, the surface of the tooth is prepared,
and then the device delivers an electric current

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.929
that forces minerals like calcium and phosphate
into the tooth.

00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:10.479
This effectively rebuilds the tooth -- which
makes the tooth even stronger and naturally

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:12.119
repairs the cavity.

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.840
The scientists say that the electrical current
used is gentle -- so gentle, in fact, that

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.009
you can't even feel it.

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.369
I meeeaaann.....this sounds like a dream come
true does it not?

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.040
As an added bonus, the cost of the procedure
will likely be about the same price or cheaper

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.389
than current tooth decay treatments.

00:01:25.389 --> 00:01:27.520
AND, the device can even whiten teeth.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.520
SIGN.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:29.520
ME.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.520
UP!

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.079
The only known drawbacks to note are that
the device can't repair cavities which have

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:35.659
progressed too far -- so you'll still want
to stay on top of your dental appointments.

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:39.369
The scientists also noted that the device
can't actually physically regrow a new tooth

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:41.139
so....you're out of luck on that one.

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:45.319
I'm super excited for this thing to get rolling
-- about 35% of the world's population deals

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:46.520
with untreated tooth decay.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.600
It's a problem that only been exaggerated
in recent decades by the increasing availability

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.679
of sugary foods.

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:54.670
So basically: this thing could literally change
the world!

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:55.670
Are you ready for it?

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.609
Let me know what you think about this new
device down below.

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:59.509
Thanks for joining me for Dnews everyone!
