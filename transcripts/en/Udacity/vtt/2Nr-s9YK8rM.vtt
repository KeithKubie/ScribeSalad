00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:04.622
Log base 2 of 24 minus log base 2 of 3 should, according to the quotient

00:00:04.622 --> 00:00:11.327
property, equal log base 2 of 24 over 3. And 24 over 3 is just 8, so this is

00:00:11.327 --> 00:00:16.760
log base 2 of 8. However, we can rewrite 8 as 2 to the 3rd power, and we know

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.820
that log base 2 of 2 to the 3rd is just 3, 3 is the exponent we need to take a

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:27.260
2 to, to get 8. There we go, once again the quotient property has seriously

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.990
helped us simplify a log expression. Instead of log base 2 of 24, minus log

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.373
base 2 of 3, we just have the number 3.
