1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,080
Or the guys like Lucy Kay who selling
out everywhere and doing great comedy.

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:05,063
Like he can't,

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:08,040
he could sell out fucking staple center
right now multiple times in a row.

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,310
What's crazy is he doesn't want to,
doesn't want to just do in comedy clubs.

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,530
Just working.
Yeah.

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:20,400
He could easily come back like
tiger woods easily right now.

7
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,960
He said that's so fucked up too because
they asked me why I did it. He goes,

8
00:00:24,961 --> 00:00:26,580
I like to jerk off and I
don't want to be alone.

9
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:33,180
I like to jerk off and I don't like
to be alone. Like oh and then you know

10
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:39,200
he's great man. Yeah. I mean he always,
he did some creepy shit. Definitely did,

11
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:42,860
did some creepy shit. I definitely
approve of it but he didn't molest anyone.

12
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:46,910
I don't think we know exactly what
happened either. I don't know.

13
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:50,030
But I do know is he could
sell out staples center. Yeah.

14
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:54,920
Cause I think most guys and fans go,
all right man. But the other thing that,

15
00:00:54,921 --> 00:00:56,570
and he's really good at comedy.
Yeah.

16
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,800
That's the other thing that we always
have to think about whenever we talk about

17
00:01:00,801 --> 00:01:02,540
anything is that we're dudes.

18
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:05,150
And so when you ever to talking about
someone jerking off in front of you,

19
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:08,270
just imagine a woman
jerking off front of us.

20
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:13,220
Now you can't because that's not the same
cause it was it the only reason why a

21
00:01:13,221 --> 00:01:14,480
girl could jerk off in front of you.

22
00:01:14,481 --> 00:01:16,910
And it's hilarious because
she can't rape you.

23
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:19,700
See if a guy is jerking
off in front of you,

24
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:23,480
most guys are bigger and
stronger than most women.

25
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:25,370
Obviously there's some variables there,

26
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:30,970
but most guys are bigger and stronger and
men make all the rape and women aren't

27
00:01:33,441 --> 00:01:35,870
out there raping dudes
show, right? It's all men.

28
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:39,830
So if a guy has his dick out
and he's jerking off scary shit,

29
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:43,070
that's why it's scary. It's
scary. It's creepy to, if a girl,

30
00:01:43,071 --> 00:01:45,350
if you go over a girl's house
and for whatever reason she goes,

31
00:01:45,351 --> 00:01:48,320
I want you to watch it sit down and
fucking, you know, fucking fuck.

32
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:52,070
She starts fingering herself
fucking, you know, like Whoa. Yeah,

33
00:01:52,071 --> 00:01:53,210
but you wouldn't laugh.

34
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:57,200
You would laugh and you would come back
to here and we would talk about it.

35
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:59,650
Cause I know I can get out
of in time. Yeah, right.

36
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,720
We'd be crying laughing but it
wouldn't be like you were in danger.

37
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:05,310
But if a guy is with safety,

38
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:09,230
you have a daughter and your daughter
weighs 110 pounds different animals and

39
00:02:09,231 --> 00:02:13,090
she's with a guy and the
guy in front of her. Yeah.

40
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:17,810
And he asked to do it and she
says yes cause she scared. Fuck.

41
00:02:17,811 --> 00:02:19,880
Then it's like what?
What would actually happen?

42
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:24,910
And see he hasn't really said anything
other than the stories are true and you

43
00:02:27,081 --> 00:02:27,914
know

44
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:28,790
yeah.

45
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:31,670
Does come from a guy that sounds like,
you know, cause you have two daughters.

46
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:33,530
Yeah.
Well it's so you have to think like that.

47
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:36,290
Well you have to think like that
as a human being, right? Yeah.

48
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:39,290
But I'm saying to you is probably the
first thing you think of because you have

49
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:43,220
two daughters. Right. But I don't
think that's what he did. I think from,

50
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,850
I can't say too much cause I don't know.

51
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:52,280
But I think he did some regrettable
things and I think he would admit that,

52
00:02:52,281 --> 00:02:56,150
but I don't think he did what a lot of
people are claiming he did in terms of,

53
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,110
that's what I've heard.

54
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:00,910
How often he did it or he did
or what the circumstances were,

55
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:05,200
but it was either way.
There's no defending when it
was bad. No, it's not good.

56
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:08,200
There's no deficiency.
It's a terrible thing to do,

57
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:13,100
but what's the punishment for that?
You know how much I should punish them,

58
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:17,260
do you not pay for it and lost all
his jobs, lost all his TV deals,

59
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:21,910
$35 million in a year of work and people
still were say no, but he's still,

60
00:03:21,911 --> 00:03:24,900
he's fine. I've heard that
argument that he's fine. Like what?

61
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:29,680
These are also, these are also things
that he did like more than a decade ago.

62
00:03:29,681 --> 00:03:33,730
Right. What, when do you
offer someone compassion?

63
00:03:33,731 --> 00:03:37,420
Like when do you, when do you let
them explain themselves? When do you,

64
00:03:37,421 --> 00:03:41,200
when is it enough is enough or it should
he have to do something like what would

65
00:03:41,201 --> 00:03:43,450
people like someone to do?
Well,

66
00:03:43,451 --> 00:03:46,150
I think they're coming because something
like this, there's only a year.

67
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,940
And then he's back and killing it
because he's so good at comedy.

68
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:52,390
Cause like with tiger woods, right.
People hated tiger. Well there was that,

69
00:03:52,391 --> 00:03:55,900
but there was also the material
that got leaked when he came back.

70
00:03:55,901 --> 00:03:59,800
So people were upset at the jokes.
The parkland joke. Yeah. Not the best.

71
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:03,670
It's that shit falls in line with
how he's always done jokes though.

72
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:08,110
I told him whether he did this or not.
He says the fucked up thing to say,

73
00:04:08,111 --> 00:04:11,830
it's part of what makes him really funny.
And he does that in real life too.

74
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:14,890
It's not,
it's a style of comedy man.

75
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:19,150
I mean it's just like a Quentin
Tarantino has a style of making movies.

76
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,620
His style of comedy is
to say fucked up things.

77
00:04:21,621 --> 00:04:24,370
So that compounded the fact that people
were upset at him that a year ago,

78
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:28,960
you know, he said he was going to take
some time off, but it's, um, I don't,

79
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:29,261
you know,

80
00:04:29,261 --> 00:04:33,680
I think it's really important to know
that I don't know what happened and,

81
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,520
and you know,
he knows and they know and it's,

82
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,680
it's never good when someone's upset
that you jerked off in front of them.

83
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:45,190
That's not a good time.
It's is never good for anybody,

84
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:48,730
but also him losing $35 million
in only been out a year.

85
00:04:48,731 --> 00:04:52,510
I think people are upset. That was
such a quick turnaround. Like Tj,

86
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:56,860
is that a quick turnaround,
man? I mean, not as a comic,
but for, to the, to the, uh,

87
00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:00,550
normal person like a year. That
ain't shit, dude. But as a comic,

88
00:05:00,551 --> 00:05:05,380
not to be able to do, let's imagine that
he's going to live another 50 years,

89
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:09,940
right? A year, a year out of 50.

90
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:15,780
It's like 2%, right? Yeah. It's a lot.
It's a lot and a lot of money. Yeah.
