00:00:00.497 --> 00:00:02.579
- [Voiceover] Now what I want
to to do for the RC circuit

00:00:02.579 --> 00:00:05.793
is a formal derivation of exactly what

00:00:05.793 --> 00:00:08.040
these two curves look like.

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.847
And then we'll have a
precise definition of

00:00:11.847 --> 00:00:13.597
the natural response.

00:00:16.403 --> 00:00:20.403
What I want to do now is
draw our circuit again.

00:00:24.256 --> 00:00:26.006
There's R, there's C.

00:00:29.273 --> 00:00:31.537
And we have some initial voltage, we said,

00:00:31.537 --> 00:00:34.537
on the capacitor, which is V naught.

00:00:35.418 --> 00:00:38.335
And what we want to find is V of T.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.057
And there's R, and there's C.

00:00:47.944 --> 00:00:52.502
So let me also label the
currents in these guys.

00:00:52.502 --> 00:00:55.730
This is the current in the resistor,

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.147
and this is the current in the capacitor.

00:01:01.041 --> 00:01:03.730
So now I'm gonna write
the two voltage current

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.119
relationships for these two components.

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.869
And Ohm's Law tells me
that equals one over R

00:01:12.852 --> 00:01:13.685
times V.

00:01:15.604 --> 00:01:19.187
And the current in a
capacitor, this is iR,

00:01:22.511 --> 00:01:26.261
current in a capacitor
equals C times dv, dt.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.687
That's the two currents in our devices.

00:01:33.687 --> 00:01:37.122
Now, gonna use Kirchhoff's
Current Law on this node

00:01:37.122 --> 00:01:39.744
right here, and that says
that all the currents

00:01:39.744 --> 00:01:43.673
flying out of that node
have to add up to zero.

00:01:43.673 --> 00:01:44.827
So let's do that.

00:01:44.827 --> 00:01:47.577
Let's say iC plus iR equals zero.

00:01:52.477 --> 00:01:55.560
This is KCL, Kirchhoff's Current Law.

00:01:58.748 --> 00:02:02.748
C dv, dt, plus one over
R, times V, equals zero.

00:02:09.903 --> 00:02:12.016
Now I'm just gonna divide through by C

00:02:12.016 --> 00:02:13.349
just to be tidy.

00:02:14.292 --> 00:02:18.125
Dv, dt plus one over RC,
times V, equals zero.

00:02:28.086 --> 00:02:30.871
So what we have here,
this expression here is

00:02:30.871 --> 00:02:34.954
referred to as an ordinary
differential equation.

00:02:36.251 --> 00:02:38.249
It has a derivative in it,
and that's what makes it

00:02:38.249 --> 00:02:41.371
a differential equation,
and you can go look up

00:02:41.371 --> 00:02:45.980
ODE and search for this in
Khan Academy and elsewhere

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.870
and in the mathematical
videos, you'll find out

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.199
different ways to solve this equation.

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:54.164
Now we're gonna do the same thing here,

00:02:54.164 --> 00:02:58.370
and we're gonna try to find
an expression for V of t.

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.787
We're gonna define V of
t in a way that makes

00:03:02.787 --> 00:03:04.457
this equation true.

00:03:04.457 --> 00:03:07.929
So we plug the function
in here, whatever it is,

00:03:07.929 --> 00:03:10.890
and then we take its derivative
and plug that in here

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.593
and that has to make this
whole expression true.

00:03:14.593 --> 00:03:16.545
There's a couple of different
ways to do this, and the one

00:03:16.545 --> 00:03:18.730
that we're gonna use
here is we're gonna guess

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.242
at an answer.

00:03:20.242 --> 00:03:23.348
So what we need is, we need
a function whose derivative

00:03:23.348 --> 00:03:26.825
looks kind of like
itself, because this thing

00:03:26.825 --> 00:03:28.658
has to add up to zero.

00:03:29.611 --> 00:03:33.778
So that means that the function
V and the function dv, dt

00:03:34.621 --> 00:03:37.032
they have to be of the
same form so that they have

00:03:37.032 --> 00:03:39.532
a chance of adding up to zero.

00:03:40.737 --> 00:03:42.977
The function that I know
whose derivative looks

00:03:42.977 --> 00:03:45.815
like itself is the exponential.

00:03:45.815 --> 00:03:49.201
So we're gonna propose that
there's gonna be an exponential

00:03:49.201 --> 00:03:52.402
and the way we do it is say,
we'll put in some constant here

00:03:52.402 --> 00:03:54.397
that we can adjust,
and then we'll put some

00:03:54.397 --> 00:03:55.897
constant out here.

00:03:59.211 --> 00:04:00.165
So this is our guess.

00:04:00.165 --> 00:04:03.904
Our guess is gonna be that
the solution for V of t

00:04:03.904 --> 00:04:06.802
is gonna be something of
the form, some constant

00:04:06.802 --> 00:04:10.135
times e to another constant, s, times t.

00:04:13.215 --> 00:04:15.951
The way we test our guess
is to put it back into

00:04:15.951 --> 00:04:18.350
the equation and see if it works.

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.156
And if it does, then we made a good guess.

00:04:20.156 --> 00:04:21.578
If it doesn't work,
then we have to go back

00:04:21.578 --> 00:04:23.890
and try something else.

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:25.226
So one of the things we
need, we're gonna plug

00:04:25.226 --> 00:04:27.142
v of t in right here.

00:04:27.142 --> 00:04:31.065
We're gonna need derivative
of v with respect to time.

00:04:31.065 --> 00:04:33.732
So let's take a derivative here.

00:04:37.006 --> 00:04:39.506
Equals d dt of k, e to the st.

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:48.342
And that equals K, and the S comes down.

00:04:52.218 --> 00:04:54.218
And e to the st remains.

00:04:57.366 --> 00:05:00.432
So we just took the derivative
of our proposed solution

00:05:00.432 --> 00:05:01.984
and now we're gonna plug
it into the equation

00:05:01.984 --> 00:05:03.734
and see what happens.

00:05:09.691 --> 00:05:12.762
So now I'm gonna plug in
the derivative that we had,

00:05:12.762 --> 00:05:15.178
plus the proposed solution,
and see if our equation

00:05:15.178 --> 00:05:16.428
comes out true.

00:05:18.884 --> 00:05:21.717
So dv, dt is sk, e to the st, plus

00:05:28.201 --> 00:05:30.118
one over RC stays here.

00:05:32.141 --> 00:05:35.558
And we plug in V, and V was ke to the st.

00:05:38.785 --> 00:05:41.035
And that'll all equal zero.

00:05:43.778 --> 00:05:47.741
Now I'm gonna factor out,
here's the common term

00:05:47.741 --> 00:05:51.908
for each one of these, so
we'll just factor that out.

00:05:52.795 --> 00:05:56.962
So now we get ke to the st,
times S plus one over RC

00:06:06.335 --> 00:06:07.335
equals zero.

00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:12.258
Okay, now let's take
a little peek at this.

00:06:12.258 --> 00:06:14.783
We have to make this
zero by the way we pick

00:06:14.783 --> 00:06:15.616
K and S.

00:06:18.047 --> 00:06:20.199
How can we make this zero?

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:22.204
There's three terms in
here, there's three terms

00:06:22.204 --> 00:06:23.168
in the product.

00:06:23.168 --> 00:06:25.585
There's this, this, and that.

00:06:26.788 --> 00:06:29.614
Any three of these terms could be zero.

00:06:29.614 --> 00:06:32.633
The first one, K is
zero, that's a boring one

00:06:32.633 --> 00:06:35.567
because it says if we have
a circuit with no energy

00:06:35.567 --> 00:06:37.505
it sits there with no energy.

00:06:37.505 --> 00:06:40.488
So that's not so interesting.

00:06:40.488 --> 00:06:44.830
Now, e to the st, we
can make that go to zero

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:47.973
but that takes a long time
because we have to let

00:06:47.973 --> 00:06:49.390
t go to infinity.

00:06:50.571 --> 00:06:53.290
S would have to be a negative
number, and t would have to

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:55.534
go to infinity, which
is a long time to wait

00:06:55.534 --> 00:06:57.839
for something to happen,
so that's not a very

00:06:57.839 --> 00:06:59.606
interesting solution either.

00:06:59.606 --> 00:07:00.927
So here's the interesting one.

00:07:00.927 --> 00:07:04.513
The interesting one is
when S plus RC equals zero

00:07:04.513 --> 00:07:08.596
so the interesting solution
is S plus one over RC

00:07:11.056 --> 00:07:15.223
equals zero, and that says that
S equals minus one over RC.

00:07:19.464 --> 00:07:22.466
That makes this solution true.

00:07:22.466 --> 00:07:26.631
And if that's the case,
now we can say v of t,

00:07:26.631 --> 00:07:28.412
we're making good progress here,

00:07:28.412 --> 00:07:31.912
k, some k, times e to the minus t over RC.

00:07:38.962 --> 00:07:41.068
Now something really
interesting just happened here.

00:07:41.068 --> 00:07:44.496
Look up here where we
have this RC term here.

00:07:44.496 --> 00:07:46.163
See this right here?

00:07:49.191 --> 00:07:52.859
This whole exponent has to
have no units by the time

00:07:52.859 --> 00:07:54.281
we evaluate it.

00:07:54.281 --> 00:07:58.031
That means that RC has
to have units of time.

00:08:02.214 --> 00:08:04.964
RC is a measure, it's in seconds.

00:08:09.558 --> 00:08:14.005
RC is the units of R times
C, ohms times farads,

00:08:14.005 --> 00:08:15.627
is actually seconds.

00:08:15.627 --> 00:08:18.764
This whole exponent has to
have no units by the time

00:08:18.764 --> 00:08:20.211
we evaluate it.

00:08:20.211 --> 00:08:23.996
And that means that RC
has to have units of time.

00:08:23.996 --> 00:08:26.921
And it's actually ohms times farads,

00:08:26.921 --> 00:08:28.921
comes out to be seconds.

00:08:31.127 --> 00:08:32.917
Now we solve for S, and that means we only

00:08:32.917 --> 00:08:34.167
have to find K.

00:08:35.277 --> 00:08:36.944
Let's work on K now.

00:08:42.523 --> 00:08:45.968
K is a variable here, time is a variable,

00:08:45.968 --> 00:08:47.541
and voltage is a variable.

00:08:47.541 --> 00:08:51.345
If we knew V and T at
the same time, we would

00:08:51.345 --> 00:08:53.627
be able to figure out K.

00:08:53.627 --> 00:08:55.829
And there's a time when we do know that.

00:08:55.829 --> 00:08:57.293
And that is t equals zero.

00:08:57.293 --> 00:09:01.675
At t equals zero we know that
the battery was hooked up

00:09:01.675 --> 00:09:04.242
and there's a bunch of
charge on the capacitor

00:09:04.242 --> 00:09:07.294
so we know that the
voltage on the capacitor

00:09:07.294 --> 00:09:10.211
at time zero, is equal to V naught.

00:09:13.275 --> 00:09:15.452
So now we have a pair of variables here.

00:09:15.452 --> 00:09:17.441
We know v and t at the same time, so let's

00:09:17.441 --> 00:09:20.015
plug that into our
proposed solution and see

00:09:20.015 --> 00:09:21.182
how k pops up.

00:09:25.363 --> 00:09:28.200
So we're gonna put these two
into our proposed solution

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.891
and see what happens to k.

00:09:30.891 --> 00:09:35.383
V, at time equals zero,
is V naught, and that's

00:09:35.383 --> 00:09:39.133
equal to k times e to
the minus t, minus zero

00:09:43.179 --> 00:09:45.012
at time zero, over RC.

00:09:47.159 --> 00:09:50.742
Now this whole expression
is e to the zero,

00:09:52.455 --> 00:09:53.911
or one.

00:09:53.911 --> 00:09:57.049
So it drops out of the expression

00:09:57.049 --> 00:10:00.049
and all we get is k equals V naught.

00:10:01.222 --> 00:10:04.805
K is the starting
voltage on the capacitor.

00:10:06.424 --> 00:10:09.896
And that gives us to our
final answer, which is

00:10:09.896 --> 00:10:13.313
v of t equals V naught, starting voltage,

00:10:16.669 --> 00:10:19.002
e to the minus time over RC.

00:10:28.434 --> 00:10:30.371
We can go one small step
further and find out

00:10:30.371 --> 00:10:31.621
what is i of t.

00:10:34.051 --> 00:10:37.301
Well, i of t is equal to v of t over R,

00:10:40.067 --> 00:10:43.266
that's just Ohm's Law, and so i of t

00:10:43.266 --> 00:10:47.349
equals V naught over R,
e to the minus t over RC.

00:10:54.363 --> 00:10:58.073
That is the natural
response of an RC circuit.
