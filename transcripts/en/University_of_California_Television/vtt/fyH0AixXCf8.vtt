00:00:05.458 --> 00:00:08.041
(upbeat music)

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.460
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.923
Bipedal, naked, large brained,

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.713
long the master of fire,
tools, and language,

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.023
but still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.903
Aware that death is inevitable,

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:30.863
yet filled with optimism.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.683
We grow up slowly.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.243
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.283
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.410
We shape the future from our

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.693
shared understanding of the past.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.160
Carta brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.703
to exchange insights on who
we are and how we got here.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.950
An exploration made
possible by the generosity

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.703
of humans like you.

00:01:15.238 --> 00:01:17.821
(upbeat music)

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.420
- It is such an honor to be here

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.380
among all of these brilliant speakers

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.720
so thank you so much for having me.

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.950
Human beings occupy two worlds,

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.430
the real world is what
actually happened in the past,

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.580
is actually happening right now,

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.500
and will actually happen in the future.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.200
And while we certainly
think about that world,

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.090
we also this enormous amount of time

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.960
considering all the many possible worlds.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.920
What philosophers and
psychologist typically

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.520
refer to as counterfactuals.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.353
That is all the ways

00:02:01.353 --> 00:02:03.510
that the world could have been but wasn't,

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.400
and all the ways that the
world could be but aren't.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.970
And not only is counterfactual
thinking pervasive

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.180
in our every day thought,

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.150
perhaps you're doing it right now,

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.130
but engaging with these
imagined possibilities

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:16.160
deeply effects us.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.210
It effects our decisions,

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:18.320
it effects our judgements,

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.682
and it effects out emotional experiences.

00:02:20.682 --> 00:02:22.290
And from an evolutionary perspective,

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.140
this initially seems a
bit surprising, right?

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.450
Well, it's obvious why engaging deeply

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.210
with our actual real experience

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.300
would give us some sort of edge.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.320
It's less obvious what we get
from engaging so profoundly

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.690
and emotionally with these
imagined worlds as well.

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.190
And this seems particularly paradoxical

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.640
when you consider the
huge proportion of time

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.650
that very young children are engaging

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.360
with these imaginary worlds.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.710
In fact, as soon as babies can talk,

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.210
they immediately begin
talking about the possible,

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:53.850
in addition to the real,

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.910
they begin to spontaneously
produce symbolic play,

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.270
substituting things like a mouse

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:01.850
from a computer for a telephone.

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.540
Very early on, around 18 months,

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.770
there's even evidence that 15 month olds

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:07.620
are recognizing pretend sequences

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.550
that are produced by adults
in their environment,

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:11.320
so that's pretty early.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.870
So, why, right?

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.590
Why would very, very young children,

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.220
who by their very definition

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.970
have so much that they have to learn about

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:21.450
the actual world, spend
so much of their time,

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:22.720
and energy, and resources,

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.660
not to mention the resources
of their caregivers

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.570
who are responsible for them,

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:28.260
engaging with unreality?

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.710
Right, we have to answer this question.

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:33.050
So classically, psychologists,
including the father

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:34.960
of developmental psychology Jean Piaget,

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.940
but also our friend Sigmund Freud here

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.490
who pops up all over the place,

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:41.360
offered some pretty
uncharitable characterizations

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.930
of pretend play in childhood.

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.180
They essentially attributed its prevalence

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.390
to children's inability to differentiate

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.100
between the products of their
imaginations and reality.

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.663
Between fantasy and reality.

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.840
Decades of research have
shown that, to the contrary,

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.350
children are actually quite proficient

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:59.000
and sophisticated at distinguishing

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.180
between real objects, events, and people,

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:03.270
and those that are products
of their imagination

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:05.430
and the imaginations
of other's around them.

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.040
I'm gonna give you just
one example of a study,

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.350
this was conducted by Jackie Willy,

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.080
just to show you how this work
is typically done with kids.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.020
A child might enter a
room with three boxes.

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.340
They'll watch as an experimenter
puts a pencil in box one.

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.900
Box two is left empty, and box three,

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.800
the child is told to imagine

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.300
that there is a pencil inside the box.

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.880
Afterwards, the experimenter might ask

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.110
the child a bunch of questions
and engage with them.

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:29.580
One of those questions will be,

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.140
is there a pencil in box three?

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:32.640
And children have no problem with this.

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:33.690
They say, yeah, sure, right?

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:35.910
They have no issue with
transporting themselves

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.540
into this imagined space
in which there is a pencil

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:39.490
inside of box three.

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.360
But if some person comes
in from the other room,

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.000
who wasn't engaged in this
fictional context initially

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.510
and says, hey I need a
pencil, can you give me one?

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.560
Children even as young as
two aren't going to make

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.370
the mistake of looking in box three.

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.480
They know there's no
actual pencil in there.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.230
Instead, they reach into box one

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:57.480
and give the experimenter

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.880
what it is that they actually asked for.

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.750
So even though children
spend hours and hours

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:03.200
of their lives pretending,

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.100
they know that they're pretending.

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:08.200
And this ability then, to
adopt this counterfactual

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.740
or false premise, like there's
a pencil inside of this cup,

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.920
to make inferences about
events that might happen

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.340
in a world in which there
were a pencil in the cup,

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:19.210
but also to separate that imagined space

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:22.260
from the real world is already present

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.050
from as early as two years of age.

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.020
This is very, very early on.

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.370
In fact, there's other prominent features

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:29.460
of pretend play that
suggest that it's the result

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.310
of competence rather than
cognitive limitation.

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:35.000
So it's largely unique to human beings,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.530
it's often social in nature,

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:38.630
like many of our more complex functions,

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:40.580
it becomes increasingly
elaborate over time.

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:42.660
You'd expect the opposite
if it was the result

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.050
of a cognitive limitation.

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:46.280
Young children do this
object substitution,

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.320
as they get a little bit older
they don't even need objects

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:49.670
to scaffold their pretend play with.

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:52.480
They just imagine things,
completely imaginary events.

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:53.750
A little bit later, they might develop

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:55.640
an imaginary friend or companion.

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:58.270
This is an entity that has
a consistent psychology

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:00.040
that they interact with over time.

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.850
A rich and complex
psychology in social life.

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:06.050
Even later in late childhood,
and adolescence even,

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:08.090
children engage with paracosms,

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:10.040
the little micro world that they construct

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.480
of their own design,

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.100
and, of course, as we know, this extends

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:15.370
into adulthood as well.

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:17.620
We all appreciate fictional artifacts

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:20.003
and this is continuous
throughout the lifespan.

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:24.150
Given that very young children
engage with imaginary worlds,

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:27.020
which seems obvious,
and that this engagement

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:28.370
doesn't stem from their confusion,

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:31.600
which is a bit less obvious
but not so much anymore,

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.360
then why are they doing it?

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.780
Why are they doing it and how?

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:36.632
How are they doing it?

00:06:36.632 --> 00:06:38.760
Well, we know that play is characteristic

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.550
of young animals across
a wide range of species

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:43.370
and that the behaviors
that are involved in play

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:45.750
are also those that will
typically be most important

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:47.740
for adults of that species.

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:51.530
And in this way, play is a
form of exploratory learning.

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:54.630
So the immature animal
can explore and practice

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:56.934
alternative forms of action in low cost,

00:06:56.934 --> 00:06:59.900
low risk environment
without any of the pressures

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:02.470
of having to actually
achieve a particular goal,

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:04.530
like staying alive for example,

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:07.490
and, in fact, one of the
most distinctive features,

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:09.300
biological features of human beings,

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:12.730
is our unusually long
period of immaturity.

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:14.640
Compared with our closest
primate relatives,

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:16.830
we've evolved to have this
dramatically extended,

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:19.070
protected period of childhood.

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:21.260
Early, middle, late, adolescents,

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:22.550
after we go to college,

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:25.770
we're still protected in
the spirit of immaturity,

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:27.240
and what we're encouraged to do

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:28.650
is explore during this period of time.

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:31.440
We're engaging in this
exploratory learning.

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:33.810
So while it's sort of easy
to see how physical forms

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:35.890
of exploratory play like
play fighting and hunting,

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:39.630
and climbing, might translate
into later adult skills,

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:42.330
pretend play is, sort of
by its very definition,

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:43.870
severed from reality.

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:46.070
So in order to make
this analogy with play,

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:47.540
with other forms of play work,

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:48.960
we have to really identify the role

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:50.700
that this particular type of cognition,

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:55.060
this counterfactual type of
cognition plays in cognition.

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:56.850
So, to put this in the form of a question,

00:07:56.850 --> 00:07:59.130
why might it be beneficial
to draw conclusions

00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:02.220
from false premises like
there's a pencil in the cup?

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:05.020
So to answer this question we can consider

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:07.960
how children's minds are
constructed to support

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:11.010
and also to encourage their
generation of a wide array

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:12.900
of alternative possibilities.

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:14.870
And it turns out that new ideas about

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:16.890
children's earliest
learning mechanism suggests

00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:20.540
that the very same abilities
that allow children to learn

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:21.920
so much about the world,

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:24.100
and to reason so powerfully about it,

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:27.480
also allows them to imagine
alternatives to that world.

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:30.330
And more specifically, it's
the ability to represent

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:33.000
cause and effect relationships that seems

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.730
to underpin some of the ability
to imagine possible worlds.

00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:37.760
And, not only that,

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:39.960
but the ability to
imagine possible worlds,

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:42.150
feeds back to facilitate our reasoning

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:44.780
about cause and effect relationships.

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:46.570
So the rest of this talk, I'm going to,

00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:48.640
very quickly try to unpack

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:51.623
the sort of theoretical
grounds for making this claim.

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:54.170
So by about five years of age,

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:56.930
children have already developed
complex causal theories

00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:58.410
in variety of domains.

00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:00.860
Everything from understanding
biological principles

00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:03.400
to other minds to the nature
of other physical forces

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:04.940
and properties in the world.

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:06.510
And the question that
motivates my research,

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:08.550
but also just sort of the
field of cognitive development

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:10.600
in general is just how this ever happened.

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:13.140
How is that young
children are able to learn

00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:15.970
these abstract, structured,
causal representations

00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:18.140
of the world so quickly and accurately,

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:20.470
given the relatively limited
information that's available

00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:22.760
to them from their senses.

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:25.170
What's the origin of this knowledge?

00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:28.540
And one classic answer from
developmental psychology,

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:30.710
points to the similarities
between children's learning

00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:31.890
and learning in science.

00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:34.810
And the idea here proposes
that children's early theories

00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:39.080
share, in a meaningful
way, structure, function,

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:43.210
and dynamics to theory change in science.

00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:46.000
And in particular, that children
just like little scientists

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.960
are implicitly formulating
hypotheses about the world,

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:52.820
and then testing and rationally
revising those hypotheses

00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:55.450
in light of new evidence
that they observe.

00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:58.330
So this sounds a bit far
fetched when you first hear it.

00:09:58.330 --> 00:09:59.770
To help you imagine this,

00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:02.750
I'm going to show you
a video of this idea.

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:04.680
What this child is doing in this video

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:06.050
is playing with a blicket detector,

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:08.560
which is a toy that we
typically use in my lab.

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:10.230
This is just a flexible causal system.

00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:12.470
It's a box that lights
up, which is the effect,

00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:14.050
for certain things, which is the cause.

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:15.180
And it allows us to explore

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:17.580
children's causalate
inferences really well.

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:18.450
So I'm just gonna let you watch

00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:20.650
and I want you to keep
an eye out for the child

00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:22.630
engaging in hypothesis testing behavior,

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:23.833
similar to a scientist.

00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:29.723
- We need this on the box
and this on the box, look.

00:10:31.416 --> 00:10:32.950
- [Experimenter] Uh huh.

00:10:32.950 --> 00:10:36.310
- This makes that light up the box.

00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:38.630
- Mm hmm.
- How about this.

00:10:42.436 --> 00:10:45.132
That makes the other side.

00:10:45.132 --> 00:10:47.251
- [Caren] Here is a new hypothesis.

00:10:47.251 --> 00:10:48.084
- Uh oh.

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:53.513
Nothing.

00:10:55.695 --> 00:10:58.893
This one's lighted up and this one's not.

00:10:58.893 --> 00:11:00.522
So that means.

00:11:00.522 --> 00:11:02.605
- [Woman] Here's another.

00:11:05.126 --> 00:11:07.891
- What's making this light up?

00:11:07.891 --> 00:11:09.262
Hmm.

00:11:09.262 --> 00:11:10.500
- [Caren] That's a familiar
expression to those

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:14.413
of us who do science.
(audience laughing)

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:20.883
Despair.

00:11:22.385 --> 00:11:23.218
- Oh no.

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:31.720
Oh it's because that this
needs to be like this.

00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:38.250
And this needs to be like that.

00:11:38.250 --> 00:11:39.083
That's why.

00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:42.970
Oh.

00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:46.000
Probably the boxes are the wrong way.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.010
- This was the child's
idea, pretty imaginative.

00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:52.010
(audience laughing)

00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:57.080
And like in science, it
ends with embarrassment

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.180
in front of our peers.

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:01.970
So even though these ideas
about children's learning

00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:03.140
have been around for quite some time,

00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:04.890
recently there's been some major advances

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:06.300
in our ability to formally describe

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:08.380
the cognitive processes
that might be taking place

00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:09.430
and the way that this is done

00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:11.260
is by integrating developmental psychology

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:14.373
so this kind of work with
computational theories.

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:17.110
So one of the central
ideas in this frame work

00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:18.980
is that children's
intuitive causal theories

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:21.150
can be expressed in a kind of causal map

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:23.290
or abstract picture of
how the world works.

00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:24.230
A little bit like this.

00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:27.870
So for example, sunlight and
water cause plants to grow,

00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:30.920
forces and contact cause
objects to move through space,

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:32.450
desires and beliefs cause someone

00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:35.520
to act towards a particular goal.

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:37.680
And in many ways, these
causal maps are analogous

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:39.630
to the more familiar
spacial maps that depict

00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:41.110
the various locations of objects

00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:42.910
in relation to one another.

00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:43.900
This is a cognitive feature

00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:45.190
that we share with other animals,

00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:47.680
including rodents, like depicted here.

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:50.050
So having a special map is useful

00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:50.930
and this is mentioned earlier

00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:51.920
because it allows for this

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:54.140
non egocentric
representation of knowledge.

00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:56.430
It doesn't matter where I am in the space,

00:12:56.430 --> 00:12:58.060
I can still represent the space.

00:12:58.060 --> 00:12:59.240
This means that it's flexible.

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:01.250
I can plan my route in advance

00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:02.260
and think about the different ways

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:03.980
that I might approach this problem.

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:06.060
And it becomes updated as new information

00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:08.730
about the space becomes available.

00:13:08.730 --> 00:13:10.110
So in similar way,

00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:14.030
having a causal map provides
a complex representation

00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:16.790
of the causal relationships
or an abstract picture

00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:19.750
of how one thing might be
causally connected to another,

00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:21.680
and, just like our
special maps, it's updated

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:24.400
as new information
becomes available to us.

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:26.210
So you can think of each
of these different causal

00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:27.900
models as a particular hypothesis

00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:29.540
that we might hold about the true

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:31.260
causal structure of the world.

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:33.210
So, for example, if I
notice that the flowers

00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:35.360
in my window begin to wilt

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:38.100
I might entertain several
possible causal models.

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:41.650
Each of which generate their
own patterns of predictions.

00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:43.770
So it could be that too much sunlight

00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:47.380
is causing both the dry
soil and the wilted flowers,

00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:50.120
or it could be that the
sunlight is actually

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:52.230
causing the dry soil
and it's the dry soil,

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:54.240
right, that's causing my flowers to wilt.

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:57.380
And if I'm holding a causal
model that happens to be correct

00:13:57.380 --> 00:13:59.620
and the predictions that it
generates will be accurate

00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:01.800
with respect to my
observations in the world.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:05.000
But if it's incorrect, if I
hold the wrong causal model,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.660
my predictions are going to fail me.

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:08.850
And this will prompt me
to adjust my causal model

00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:11.140
to better approximate
the true causal structure

00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:12.010
of the world.

00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:15.650
So in affect, this process,
the process of early learning,

00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:18.940
might be conceived as a process
of comparing possible worlds

00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:21.070
and updating those possibilities in light

00:14:21.070 --> 00:14:24.050
of new evidence as you observe it.

00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:26.360
And critically these
casual maps also include

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:28.950
a means for representing
possible future actions

00:14:28.950 --> 00:14:30.540
for planning in the world.

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:32.730
So if we return to the
two sort of versions

00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:35.120
of the wilted flowers
that I described earlier,

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:36.700
even though each of these representations

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:40.060
have the save variables,
sunlight, soil, flowers,

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:41.530
the differences in their structure lead

00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:43.620
to really different effects
following some action

00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:45.760
that I might take on the world.

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:47.900
So let's say I intervene on my dry soil

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:49.700
by watering my plants.

00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:50.870
Hopefully what you can see here

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:53.370
is that depending upon which
of the two causal structures

00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:55.660
is an accurate
representation of the world,

00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:58.400
watering my plants here in the first one

00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:00.200
is gonna have no effect on my flowers

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:01.380
right because it's the sunlight that's

00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:02.970
directly causing them to wilt.

00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:04.430
In the other case though,

00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:08.400
watering the soil will
actually have some effect.

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:10.470
And importantly these
interventions could be real.

00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:12.210
I could actually do them.

00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:14.880
Or they can be imagined
hypothetical actions.

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:16.420
I can just sort of think
what it would be like

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:18.800
if I were to intervene on the
world in a particular way.

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:20.440
And it turns out, that the evidence shows,

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:22.440
that even preschool aged
children are able to do this.

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:24.340
Are able to reason about interventions,

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:27.850
both in the real world and
also in their imaginations.

00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:30.700
So this gives us an
extremely powerful tool

00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:32.840
for planning and
considering in the outcomes

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:34.770
of potential actions in advance.

00:15:34.770 --> 00:15:36.520
We start with a premise
that might be false

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:37.500
with respect to the world

00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:39.320
and then we just reason
about the implications

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:41.350
of that premise downstream.

00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:43.840
This leads us to the ability
to design new interventions

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:46.410
and to literally change the future

00:15:46.410 --> 00:15:48.820
for ourselves and our environment.

00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:50.880
So now we have to push the
pause button for a minute

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:53.290
'cause this all sounds really,
really complicated to us.

00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:54.550
All of these things are, of course,

00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:56.810
happening implicitly not explicitly

00:15:56.810 --> 00:15:57.810
but you might be wondering whether

00:15:57.810 --> 00:16:00.170
or not kids could actually do this.

00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:02.220
So if we return to
pretend play for a minute,

00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:05.320
we see that children are
routinely considering premises

00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:07.450
that contradict their own knowledge.

00:16:07.450 --> 00:16:09.364
They ignore the fact
that the teacup is empty

00:16:09.364 --> 00:16:11.700
and they proceed to
wipe up the imagined tea

00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:13.670
when the cup is overturned anyway.

00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:16.490
Any time, really, that
children are acting out

00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:18.950
the outcome of pretend
events, they're necessarily

00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:21.090
setting aside their
interpretation, their causal model

00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:22.990
of the real world, and reasoning

00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:26.220
about the causal consequences
of some pretend premise.

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:28.370
Some other possible world.

00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:29.203
And in fact,

00:16:29.203 --> 00:16:32.350
it's causation itself that
gives fantasy its logic.

00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:34.320
Despite the fact that
children could, in principle,

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:36.490
pretend about anything at
all, it's pretend after all,

00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:38.110
if you've ever hung out with children,

00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:40.860
you know that they don't
actually usually do this.

00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:42.950
Instead, some research
by Paul Harris has shown

00:16:42.950 --> 00:16:44.710
that if a child pretends
to spill the sugar

00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:46.050
during their tea party, they're gonna opt

00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:47.660
to sweep it up with a broom.

00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:51.970
If they spill the milk, then
they'll grab a mop or a sponge.

00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:54.380
And it's precisely this
unique blend of knowledge

00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:56.260
and imagination that really characterizes

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.540
early pretend play in childhood.

00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:01.260
And in fact, the cognitive
processes that are involved

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:03.670
in pretend play, aren't
only useful for planning,

00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:06.770
they're also critical for learning.

00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:09.440
For example, children who
create imaginary companions

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:11.940
tend to show increased theory of mind.

00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:13.690
So this is just an increased understanding

00:17:13.690 --> 00:17:15.480
of the cause and effect relationships

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:18.423
that dictate the psychological
and social world.

00:17:19.688 --> 00:17:21.800
So I propose then that
pretend play is really

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:24.860
just a precocious display of
children's developing abilities

00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:25.700
in causal reasoning.

00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:28.393
It arises out of those
abilities quite naturally.

00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:32.750
And that engagement in imaginary
worlds actually feeds back

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:34.770
to serve as an engine of learning as well

00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:36.720
promoting these abilities that we need.

00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:40.700
So to sort of summarize the
logic in a single slide here,

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:44.220
the long period of protected
immaturity winds up leading

00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:48.590
to increased time for exploratory
learning through play.

00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:51.630
Exploratory play allows for
more flexible kinds of learning

00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:54.070
mechanisms that support the
development of causal models

00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:57.110
that slowly adjust to the
environment over time.

00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:59.160
These models support
counterfactual reasoning,

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:01.250
it's sort of inherent to the
model to think about ways

00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:02.950
that you might change it in order to think

00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:04.500
of how things could be different.

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:06.690
And this is initially
expressed in young children

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:08.030
in the context of pretend play

00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:10.850
really as early as they can start to talk.

00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:13.350
And finally that reasoning
about these possibilities

00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:16.260
feeds back to support the very mechanisms

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:19.373
that underlie causal learning in humans.

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:22.450
So I'm gonna end with a quote

00:18:22.450 --> 00:18:24.070
from my colleague Alison Gopnik,

00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:27.290
with whom I've coauthored
all of my work in this area,

00:18:27.290 --> 00:18:29.231
and I'd like to thank
you for your attention.

00:18:29.231 --> 00:18:32.314
(adience applauding)

00:18:34.936 --> 00:18:37.519
(upbeat music)
