00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.520
Attackers can also use analysis
of his attacks to disrupt

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.240
the network intrusion detection process.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.520
In addition to intrusion
detection systems,

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.120
there's also intrusion
prevention systems.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.400
Instead of simply sending
alerts like and IDS.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.520
And IDS would try to block the attack
when it detects malicious activities.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:22.370
For example,

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:26.590
it can block network traffic that
involves malicious activities.

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.280
Similar to an IDS, an IPS can
be deployed at the end host and

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.420
the network perimeter or
a combination of different locations.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.580
An IPS also uses the similar
detection algorithms of an IDS.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:41.530
For example,

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.720
it can use anomaly detection algorithm
to detect abnormal behavior.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.310
And stop such abnormal behavior.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.350
And this is the main difference
between an IPS and a firewall.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.780
A firewall typically only use simple
signatures of attacks to stop traffic.

00:00:58.825 --> 00:01:03.190
Whereas, an IPS can use very
sophisticated detection algorithms.
