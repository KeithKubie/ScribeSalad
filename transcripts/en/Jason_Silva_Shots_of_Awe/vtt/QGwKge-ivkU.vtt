JASON SILVA: What's
going on guys?

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.310
Welcome to "Shots of Awe."

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.460
Now, we're doing these
extended conversations,

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.880
these creative sessions
with some of the luminaries

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.040
who have inspired so
many of these episodes.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.360
And you're about to see my
conversation with Erik Davis.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.520
Erik Davis wrote
"TechGnosis," which

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.530
is a book that literally
tickles my brain,

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:25.330
and is a cognitively
ecstatic experience

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:26.494
to read that man's words.

00:00:26.494 --> 00:00:27.910
And it's fascinating,
because it's

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.640
commentaries about technology,
myth, magic, and mysticism

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:31.780
in the age of information.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.840
Actually, they put
me in his head.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.355
I feel like I read
his observations,

00:00:35.355 --> 00:00:36.297
and I relate to them.

00:00:36.297 --> 00:00:37.880
And the thrill of
feeling like there's

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.630
someone else in the
world who's thinking

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.480
this way about these big
issues is astonishing.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.390
So I hope you guys enjoyed
this extended creative session

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.910
with the brilliant Erik Davis.

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.630
So Erik Davis, it's a
thrill to be here with you.

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:55.490
You have inspired me to no end.

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.130
I've just got to say, first
of all, let me thank you.

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.790
Thank you for your work, for
your ideas, for your book,

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:03.720
"TechGnosis," which
is being reissued,

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.850
and which has blown
my mind to know end.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.170
This book looks at technology
in a very different way

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.960
than most people
think of technology.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.430
People use technology to extend
their capacities in the world,

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.720
to extend their
communication abilities.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.150
But people also have an
apprehension about technology.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.450
They're afraid of that the
robots are taking over.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.700
You look at the
Gnostic undertone.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.570
So why don't you, at
first, just tell me

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.720
a little bit about where
"TechGnosis" came from.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.490
ERIK DAVIS: No, that's
a great question.

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.380
I got a sense of
what was going to be

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:39.820
happening with technology.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.690
In the late '80s already, I was
studying postmodern philosophy,

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.100
and reading agnosticism,
and science fiction,

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.400
and Philip K Dick.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.140
And then I became
a culture critic.

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.930
I wrote for "The
Village Voice," and I

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.096
wrote a lot of record
reviews, and things like that.

00:01:54.096 --> 00:01:56.660
But I noticed on the
horizon that there

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.420
were these strange
juxtapositions of technology,

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.340
and religion technology,
and mysticism.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.650
And they were so
peculiar, because we don't

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:04.920
organize the world that way.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:05.711
JASON SILVA: Right.

00:02:05.711 --> 00:02:08.139
ERIK DAVIS: There's religion,
and mysticism, and magic.

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:10.850
There are old stuff over
there, maybe in our dreams,

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:11.992
maybe in our fantasies.

00:02:11.992 --> 00:02:12.700
JASON SILVA: Yep.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.560
ERIK DAVIS: And then we have
the technology, the world we

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.061
actually--

00:02:15.061 --> 00:02:16.351
JASON SILVA: Ration of science.

00:02:16.351 --> 00:02:18.270
ERIK DAVIS: Rationality,
science, progress,

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.100
leaving the shadows in the wake.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.670
And I noticed that
that's actually not true,

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.770
and that there's all ways in
our stories, in our habits,

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.800
in the images of the way that
technologies are packaged

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.390
and sold where we actually draw
from the religious imagination,

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.910
let's call it, whether it's
from Christian ideas of progress

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.160
or occult ideas of
magic spells and powers,

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.300
or Gnostic dreams
of transcendence,

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.690
and moving onward and
upward into the heavens

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:53.810
through our technology.

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:54.260
JASON SILVA: Right.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.843
ERIK DAVIS: And so
what I wanted to do

00:02:55.843 --> 00:03:00.300
is tell a secret history, an
esoteric history of technology

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.760
that paid attention and drew all
of these shadows, and figments,

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.710
and stories out
of the background

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:10.070
and brought them forward so
that people could see really

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:11.900
what was going on
already in a lot of ways.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:12.770
JASON SILVA: 1,000%.

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:15.700
And what continuously
blows my mind,

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.460
and I experience a kind
of bibliomancy every time

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:20.120
I open this book.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.930
And any page that I
open it to, there's

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.286
something really relevant
and really just astonishing

00:03:25.286 --> 00:03:28.330
that you point out about our
relationship with technology.

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.350
One of your chapters is
called the spiritual cyborg,

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.000
that we are a cyborg.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.440
We are in a coevolution
with our technology.

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.530
We extend our minds into our
tools, and so on, and so forth.

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.200
But that there is this
spiritual yearning,

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.140
that we are beset with a thirst
for meaning that continues.

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:48.660
We may build the
Hubble Space Telescope,

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.140
put that in space,
mainline space and time

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:52.330
through the optic nerve.

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:53.170
But because why?

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.280
Because we're looking
for the holy other.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.659
We're trying to
blast new tunnels

00:03:57.659 --> 00:03:58.950
between the mind and the other.

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.490
It always comes
back to the pressure

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:05.060
of being a conscious being, to
be sentient, to face mortality,

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.320
to fancy ourselves
as gods, but to be

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:08.960
ultimately food for worms.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.550
And I just felt that you
just identified that thread

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:13.050
throughout.

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:14.133
And you did it so vividly.

00:04:14.133 --> 00:04:16.730
And your power with
language, with words--

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:19.500
where do you go when
you write this stuff?

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.300
And also, these observations
that you were making probably

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.520
reflect a journey
that you were taking,

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.660
and it probably comes from
a place of you wanting

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.580
to understand, and
you being beset

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.132
with a thirst for meaning.

00:04:32.132 --> 00:04:32.840
ERIK DAVIS: Yeah.

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.350
JASON SILVA: So
tell me about that.

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.880
ERIK DAVIS: Well,
like a lot of people,

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.630
I would say I was a
spiritual seeker of sorts.

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.422
And for me, it was often a
very intellectual pursuit

00:04:43.422 --> 00:04:45.880
where I wanted to know where
these things were coming from,

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.840
religions, and
mystery, and magic,

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.240
and the occult, and
meditation, and all that stuff.

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.160
But I was also a practitioner.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.620
I was searching.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.550
And in some sense, I still am.

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:56.360
JASON SILVA: Yes.

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.050
ERIK DAVIS: So I was
fired up by that.

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.270
But at the same time, I
saw technology coming.

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:02.470
I understood it really well.

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.190
It was like my
father's a scientist.

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.190
I was really tuned into
science and mathematics.

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:08.430
I studied mathematics.

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.010
And even though I didn't
end up studying science--

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:13.760
I got seduced by
the humanities--

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:14.080
JASON SILVA: Right.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.760
ERIK DAVIS: --I've always
had a real attraction to it,

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.910
unlike a lot of people who
work in the humanities.

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:18.580
JASON SILVA: Mm-hmm.

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.730
ERIK DAVIS: So I started to see
that all this stuff was coming.

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:22.220
And then it was really
going to change everything.

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:23.678
It was already
changing everything.

00:05:23.678 --> 00:05:24.750
It was changing finance.

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:27.640
It was changing our self image.

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.660
It was changing how we
think about ourselves.

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:34.670
And so I could see this almost
apocalypse on the horizon.

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:36.220
And it was the
early '90s, and you

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.790
could tell the end of
the century's coming.

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:39.880
What's going to happen?

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.085
There's this sense
of a millennialism

00:05:42.085 --> 00:05:46.400
that I was tuning into that
brought these worlds together.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.950
So for me, it was
really an attempt

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:51.120
to integrate different
sides of myself,

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.500
and to continue
to tune into what

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.560
was happening in the
future, but to recognize

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.419
that these yearnings
aren't going to go away.

00:05:58.419 --> 00:05:59.210
JASON SILVA: Right.

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:00.220
ERIK DAVIS: They
just get rephrased

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:01.221
in a new point of view.

00:06:01.221 --> 00:06:02.220
JASON SILVA: Repackaged.

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:02.928
ERIK DAVIS: Yeah.

00:06:02.928 --> 00:06:05.050
So this spiritual cyborg
is basically the idea

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:08.860
that a lot of people who
yearn for spirituality

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:10.330
or for a religious
connection, they

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:13.589
might think that technology is
taking us away from everything.

00:06:13.589 --> 00:06:14.380
JASON SILVA: Right.

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:16.380
ERIK DAVIS: That we need
to return to our roots,

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:17.130
return to nature.

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:20.110
We're too artificial,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:21.930
I have a lot of
appreciation for that view.

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:23.350
But in a way, it's obvious.

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:23.780
JASON SILVA: Yeah.

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:26.071
ERIK DAVIS: And I wanted to
ask a deeper question which

00:06:26.071 --> 00:06:28.850
is, what happens when
you actually embrace

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:30.262
the technological framework?

00:06:30.262 --> 00:06:30.970
JASON SILVA: Yes.

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:36.192
ERIK DAVIS: Including the idea
that we are DNA meat machines?

00:06:36.192 --> 00:06:37.900
JASON SILVA: We're
made of language, bro.

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:38.150
ERIK DAVIS: Right.

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:38.770
JASON SILVA: It's software.

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:40.936
ERIK DAVIS: Spinning ourselves
in the void, and now,

00:06:40.936 --> 00:06:43.460
as we've extruded all
of these algorithms

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:46.740
and technological processes
that have a life of their own,

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.970
that we're now
riding this thing,

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:53.240
how do we engage all that
and embrace that, but still

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:57.730
pay attention to, even be driven
by these deeper yearnings that

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:00.550
go much, much farther
back in our past?

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:04.060
And so that's the dialectic
or tension that I'm really

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:05.669
trying to work out in the book.

00:07:05.669 --> 00:07:06.960
JASON SILVA: Which is dazzling.

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:10.050
And you talk a lot about
the emergence of the cyber

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:13.020
culture in the late '90s and the
connection with the millennium,

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:14.770
and this idea there
was this dream,

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:16.890
that these tools we're
going to liberate us

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:20.177
from the biological
meat machine,

00:07:20.177 --> 00:07:22.760
the biological straitjacket, and
that we were going to unleash

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:24.710
our minds into a virtual world.

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:27.280
As Terence McKenna said
about virtual reality,

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:30.480
this will allow us to
turn our minds inside out,

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:32.789
that new forms of
intersubjectivity

00:07:32.789 --> 00:07:35.080
could be attained, because
we would graduate from being

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.090
naked monkeys making
little monkey noises,

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:38.950
thinking they see
God, and actually

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:41.110
actualize a cosmos
for the imagination

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:42.850
that we could inhabit.

00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:45.899
Technology, as McKenna used to
say, is congealed imagination.

00:07:45.899 --> 00:07:46.690
ERIK DAVIS: Mm-hmm.

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:48.315
JASON SILVA: But now,
we could actually

00:07:48.315 --> 00:07:51.770
move into and live inside of
our congealed imagination.

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:52.970
We're already doing it.

00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:53.970
Talk about architecture.

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:54.920
Talk about air crafts.

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:57.900
But even more so, the promise
of virtual reality, this

00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:00.120
was there in that cyber
culture in the '90s,

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:01.520
and you were pointing to it.

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:04.000
But then there's been
this disenchantment now.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.900
Do you think it's
going to come back?

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:07.800
Now, virtual
reality is emerging.

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:10.760
Now, I can rub the magic
mirror on my iPhone

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:13.960
and summon a car that
synchronizes with my Spotify

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.490
playlist to play the
music that I love

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:19.450
so that my phenomenological
flow starts to feel

00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:21.080
like a reenchanted world.

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:23.740
The internet of things,
predictive, contextual

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:26.880
computing, starts to create
a world of enchanted objects,

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:28.360
a world of animism.

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:29.950
So all of us start
to feel like we're

00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:31.590
in an altered state
of consciousness

00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:33.659
where everything
is in sync with us,

00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:37.179
and we start experiencing
engineered serendipities.

00:08:37.179 --> 00:08:38.669
Do you think that
that's possible?

00:08:38.669 --> 00:08:40.860
Or are you feeling like
it's a bunch of corporations

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:41.693
are manipulating us?

00:08:41.693 --> 00:08:43.250
ERIK DAVIS: Well,
one of the things

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:46.790
that I talk about in
technosis is that when

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:50.470
new information technologies
enter into a culture, when

00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:53.240
you have the telegraph, when
you have the telephone, when you

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:58.020
have television, radio, when
those technologies initially

00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:01.060
enter into social reality
and begin to transform

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:03.770
the way that we experience
ourselves, communication,

00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:06.760
and a relationship
to time and space.

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:08.240
When those things
happen, there's

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:12.640
a weird gap in the world
where suddenly, there's

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:16.400
a recognition that we're
making this up as we go along,

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:18.740
and it's not really clear
what the new form is.

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:19.531
JASON SILVA: Right.

00:09:19.531 --> 00:09:23.160
ERIK DAVIS: So into that gap
rush fantasies, and dreams,

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:26.430
and revelations, and terrors,
and demons, and fears.

00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:27.180
JASON SILVA: Yeah.

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:29.400
ERIK DAVIS: And
that that tension

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:33.240
between the up and the down,
the demon and the angel,

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:36.290
is part of the
inheritance of technology.

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:40.290
So when you asked that
question, the answer, in a way,

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:41.040
is boring.

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:46.120
It's both and, and that the
moment of revelation that we're

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:49.090
moving into in that
sense of oh my god,

00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:51.040
it's all things coming together.

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:52.860
There's a kind of
fantasy that I'm

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:54.180
living through the technology.

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:56.320
There's a synchronicity,
these effects

00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:00.790
that are producing a much
more enchanted sense of moving

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:01.950
through ordinary life--

00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:02.658
JASON SILVA: Yes.

00:10:02.658 --> 00:10:06.380
ERIK DAVIS: --are intimately and
absolutely coupled with a deep

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:07.647
suspicion and alienation--

00:10:07.647 --> 00:10:08.480
JASON SILVA: Uh-huh.

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:11.870
ERIK DAVIS: --and that those
are also features of technology.

00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:14.350
They're features of
advanced capitalism,

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:17.520
and that if anything,
they're closer.

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:19.610
They rub up against
each other even more--

00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:20.460
JASON SILVA: Than ever before.

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:21.668
ERIK DAVIS: Than ever before.

00:10:21.668 --> 00:10:24.590
And so I know I'm
neither an optimistic

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:26.929
nor a pessimist in
the way that people

00:10:26.929 --> 00:10:27.970
like to align themselves.

00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:29.900
I'm much more
interested in trying

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:34.200
to see how the dance
between these poles happens,

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:37.590
and then always paying
attention to I have to own,

00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:41.300
we have to own our
own projections too.

00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:44.680
We have to recognize, what
are we really fearing?

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:46.630
What are we really
trying to transcend?

00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:48.220
What do we really want?

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:49.620
You talk about Becker a lot.

00:10:49.620 --> 00:10:50.370
JASON SILVA: Yeah.

00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:52.119
ERIK DAVIS: How much
is our fear of death,

00:10:52.119 --> 00:10:56.360
our secret, constant,
unconscious awareness

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:59.450
that we are mortal
creatures motivating

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:02.692
our trivial perceptions,
our desires, our enjoyments?

00:11:02.692 --> 00:11:03.400
JASON SILVA: Yes.

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:04.983
ERIK DAVIS: And so
for me, it's really

00:11:04.983 --> 00:11:10.540
about using historical
complexity, conflict,

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:15.090
this weird conjunction of
beauty, and awe, and terror,

00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:17.830
and paranoia, as
this opportunity

00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:22.440
to go even deeper into this
ever evolving human condition

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:24.310
and to keep that edge sharp?

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:24.820
JASON SILVA: Well,
it's funny you

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:26.861
mentioned Becker and the
idea of human mortality.

00:11:26.861 --> 00:11:32.610
But ultimately, technology
is the ultimate antientropic

00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:34.840
extension of biology.

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:37.490
Bucky Fuller used to say,
life is antientropic.

00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:40.510
So entropy moves towards
destruction and simplification

00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:42.027
of everything, but
then life moves

00:11:42.027 --> 00:11:44.360
towards greater complexity
and organization-- upwillings

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:48.855
of structure, self-organizing,
sublime complexity that

00:11:48.855 --> 00:11:49.730
just seems to emerge.

00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:53.410
And then we extend our
biology with the technosphere.

00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:55.065
Kevin Kelly calls
it the technium.

00:11:55.065 --> 00:11:57.810
He says it's an organism,
the seventh kingdom of life.

00:11:57.810 --> 00:12:01.390
And so that this moves
towards this antientropic move

00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:03.950
towards more
complexity, of course

00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:05.800
is connected to
our desire to want

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:09.800
to overcome entropy itself,
to overcome mortality itself.

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:13.010
On the one hand, you can listen
to a beautiful piece of music

00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:16.030
while listening to your
Boise wireless headphones,

00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:17.730
and the magical
music is streaming

00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:19.350
from your magical
smartphone which

00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:22.610
has 10,000 melodies
magically stored

00:12:22.610 --> 00:12:24.240
in its electronic circuitry.

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:27.030
And you listen to it, and that
gives you a real experience.

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:29.380
There's nothing virtual
about virtual reality.

00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:32.150
That's a real virtual
reality, as [INAUDIBLE] says.

00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:34.870
And I listen to that music,
and I might get moved to tears.

00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:36.780
And I'll get the
goosebumps, and the chills,

00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:39.410
and I feel connected to
something larger than myself.

00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:44.380
I technologically mediate
ecstasy and become as a god

00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:44.880
almost.

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:47.520
I enter god mode, to
use a video game term.

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:48.270
ERIK DAVIS: Right.

00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:50.520
JASON SILVA: But that the
next day, I have a headache,

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:53.720
or I see a person
who's older and is

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:54.840
suffering from an illness.

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:56.370
And I'm like, holy shit.

00:12:56.370 --> 00:12:57.700
This is the existential bummer.

00:12:57.700 --> 00:12:58.450
ERIK DAVIS: Right.

00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:00.200
JASON SILVA: Should
we not use these tools

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:02.410
to transcend our mortal coil?

00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:04.920
Should we not--
the ape that wants

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:06.430
to molt himself into angel.

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:07.180
ERIK DAVIS: Right.

00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:08.070
JASON SILVA: That's your line.

00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:08.870
ERIK DAVIS: Yeah.

00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:10.760
JASON SILVA: We must
become machines.

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:12.520
We must become gods.

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:14.110
Man is a bridge, but not an end.

00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:14.560
ERIK DAVIS: Right.

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:15.490
JASON SILVA: What do
you think about that?

00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:17.490
ERIK DAVIS: Well, I'm going
to approach it from a slightly

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:17.960
different angle.

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:18.310
JASON SILVA: OK.

00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:20.280
ERIK DAVIS: And we'll
get to that point, which

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:24.660
is I have a whole riff that I'm
pretty convinced about which

00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:28.440
is that hedonism, the
pursuit of pleasure including

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:34.280
awe and wonder, is
it a profound path?

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:37.000
In most ways of
looking at it, hedonism

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.910
is seen as superficial,
materialistic.

00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:40.830
It's not religious.

00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:41.560
It's unethical.

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:42.490
It's not higher.

00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:43.281
JASON SILVA: Right.

00:13:43.281 --> 00:13:46.882
ERIK DAVIS: And our society
and ourselves are very hedonic.

00:13:46.882 --> 00:13:47.590
JASON SILVA: Yes.

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:50.110
ERIK DAVIS: We are trained,
and we are learned to enjoy,

00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:52.830
and we have great pleasures
that are at our fingertips

00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:54.920
if we are lucky
enough to be part

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:57.490
of this aspect of our world.

00:13:57.490 --> 00:13:58.410
JASON SILVA: Yes.

00:13:58.410 --> 00:13:59.868
ERIK DAVIS: But I
think what people

00:13:59.868 --> 00:14:01.900
miss about hedonism, what
they don't understand

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:05.810
is that if you're really asking,
is this really pleasurable?

00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:08.900
What is the whole package that
comes along with my pleasures?

00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:09.650
JASON SILVA: Yeah.

00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:11.066
ERIK DAVIS: If you
start to become

00:14:11.066 --> 00:14:12.990
aware of the
network of effects--

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:15.710
where things come from,
where are they leading?

00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:18.844
What is the larger arena
within which I am enjoying?

00:14:18.844 --> 00:14:19.510
JASON SILVA: OK.

00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:20.885
ERIK DAVIS: Then
suddenly, things

00:14:20.885 --> 00:14:23.120
start to shift a little
bit, because it becomes

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:26.980
a little harder, for
example, to truly exalt

00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:28.825
in the god power
of your device--

00:14:28.825 --> 00:14:30.640
JASON SILVA: When
it was made in the--

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:32.890
ERIK DAVIS: Right, when you
know about rare earth, you

00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:33.700
say, oh, wait.

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:37.610
Those are actually the
materials that we need in order

00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:38.880
to shrink technology.

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:42.480
Come with it almost as some
kind of chemical allegory,

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:44.880
our bound with
highly radioactive

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:48.349
material that is very toxic
and extremely expensive to get.

00:14:48.349 --> 00:14:49.640
JASON SILVA: Working with fire.

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:51.260
ERIK DAVIS: Right.

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.897
We're still in the
out chemical wager.

00:14:53.897 --> 00:14:54.730
JASON SILVA: Mm-hmm.

00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:56.320
ERIK DAVIS: It's
a kind of alliance

00:14:56.320 --> 00:15:00.170
with forces of the earth and
forces of destruction and fire,

00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:02.267
as well as light
and transcendence.

00:15:02.267 --> 00:15:03.100
JASON SILVA: Uh-huh.

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:05.510
ERIK DAVIS: And I'm not
saying that recognizing this

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:10.000
means that we should pull
back, and destroy the machines,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.390
and try to return to some
paleolithic existence.

00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:12.690
JASON SILVA: Right.

00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:14.231
ERIK DAVIS: But I
do believe that you

00:15:14.231 --> 00:15:18.840
have to go further and further
into the complexities as part

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:21.480
of the pursuit of
true enjoyment.

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:24.550
So for me, you start
to ask a question, what

00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:25.600
is transcendence?

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:25.880
JASON SILVA: Yeah.

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:27.671
ERIK DAVIS: What does
it mean to transcend?

00:15:27.671 --> 00:15:29.950
Is it really transcendence
to embed myself

00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:31.750
in particular
technological frames?

00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:32.583
JASON SILVA: Mm-hmm.

00:15:32.583 --> 00:15:34.470
ERIK DAVIS: Or perhaps
there are other ways

00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:37.760
of moving the mind, other
ways of touching what

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:43.010
is essential in us that perhaps
move at a different angle

00:15:43.010 --> 00:15:45.479
than the relentless
pursuit of the high.

00:15:45.479 --> 00:15:46.270
JASON SILVA: Right.

00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:49.220
ERIK DAVIS: Because that
comes with entailments.

00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:51.460
That comes with hidden packages.

00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:58.087
It's all allies, alliances,
packs, deals, balances.

00:15:58.087 --> 00:15:58.920
JASON SILVA: Always.

00:15:58.920 --> 00:15:59.390
ERIK DAVIS: Always.

00:15:59.390 --> 00:16:00.200
JASON SILVA: Always.

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:01.730
Well, it's so interesting
to hear you say that,

00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:03.660
because I think there's
different flavors

00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:04.840
of transcendence.

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:07.350
I think on the one
hand, there's a feeling

00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:09.750
of ecodelic interconnection
with everything

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:11.770
where you basically are
extending your empathy.

00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:14.199
Most people say,
empathy rarely extends

00:16:14.199 --> 00:16:15.240
beyond our line of sight.

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:17.010
If it's out of sight,
it's out of mind.

00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:19.250
So an elevation in
consciousness means

00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:22.630
you start to be aware of more
interconnection, the more

00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:25.180
consequences to your
everyday experience.

00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:27.100
And so you extend your empathy.

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:28.860
And that's a kind
of transcendence,

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:32.200
and a kind of communion
with everything else.

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:34.530
But there's also other
kinds of transcendence.

00:16:34.530 --> 00:16:37.510
There's just the
mediation and steering

00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:40.590
of awareness towards states
of exultation and the sublime.

00:16:40.590 --> 00:16:44.230
And that can just be listening
to Rachmaninoff on the piano

00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:45.940
and being moved
to tears while you

00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:48.710
stare into the iris of
a lover's eye, which

00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:53.190
is something I've been trying to
do since I was in high school.

00:16:53.190 --> 00:16:54.970
That's why I love
cinema, because it's

00:16:54.970 --> 00:16:56.145
the last alter left.

00:16:56.145 --> 00:16:56.853
ERIK DAVIS: Yeah.

00:16:56.853 --> 00:16:59.540
JASON SILVA: I get to go to
that temple of the IMAX theater,

00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:02.025
which is the modern equivalent
of the Gothic cathedral,

00:17:02.025 --> 00:17:04.690
it's what Alison Griffith wrote
about in the book, "Shivers

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:07.859
Down Your Spine," that this
is a temple and a place where

00:17:07.859 --> 00:17:11.650
your awareness can be mediated
and pushed towards places that

00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:12.750
tickle your soul.

00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:13.458
ERIK DAVIS: Yeah.

00:17:13.458 --> 00:17:15.942
JASON SILVA: Crack for the
soul, and at the soundscape,

00:17:15.942 --> 00:17:19.869
and that the massive screen
can push you somewhere else,

00:17:19.869 --> 00:17:21.750
can silence the part
of the brain that's

00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:23.085
responsible for self awareness.

00:17:23.085 --> 00:17:24.339
You forget yourself.

00:17:24.339 --> 00:17:24.630
ERIK DAVIS: Mm-hmm.

00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:26.088
JASON SILVA: And
that transcendence

00:17:26.088 --> 00:17:27.319
is pretty blissful too.

00:17:27.319 --> 00:17:29.612
We're all bliss
junkies in a way.

00:17:29.612 --> 00:17:30.320
ERIK DAVIS: Sure.

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:32.861
JASON SILVA: And I still think
that there's validity in that.

00:17:32.861 --> 00:17:34.547
There's some kind of
static about that.

00:17:34.547 --> 00:17:36.130
ERIK DAVIS: Another
way of approaching

00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:38.210
that is just asking
this question, which

00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:40.594
there's been a lot of
neuroscientific study

00:17:40.594 --> 00:17:41.260
of the emotions.

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:42.020
JASON SILVA: Yeah.

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:43.450
ERIK DAVIS: But it's
an interesting goal.

00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:45.201
Like with any science,
you always go, why?

00:17:45.201 --> 00:17:46.575
They're asking
certain questions,

00:17:46.575 --> 00:17:48.280
and they're not asking
other questions.

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:49.561
So what do they look at?

00:17:49.561 --> 00:17:56.120
They look at love, pair bonding,
fear, anxiety, depression.

00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:58.660
These are the things that's
worth tons of research dollars.

00:17:58.660 --> 00:17:59.160
Like wait?

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:00.410
What's happening in the brain?

00:18:00.410 --> 00:18:01.320
JASON SILVA: Right.

00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:03.060
ERIK DAVIS: Very,
very little work

00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:05.360
has ever been done
on wonder and awe,

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:08.920
as if wonder and awe are not
absolutely fundamental parts

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:11.940
of our nervous systems, to
our humanness, as if they're

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:13.920
sort of some kind
of weird fluff they

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:16.960
can be ignored as we get
to the real deal, which

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:19.160
is these survival tactics.

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:22.000
And part of the reason is
because wonder and awe,

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:30.051
it's not so clear what their
sort of selection, viability

00:18:30.051 --> 00:18:30.550
is.

00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:31.830
Why do we have that?

00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:34.520
It's not clear
exactly why that leads

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:37.670
to the perpetuation of the
species the way that fear,

00:18:37.670 --> 00:18:40.370
and anxiety-- and
even depression,

00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:41.400
they have arguments for.

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:42.852
JASON SILVA: There was a book.

00:18:42.852 --> 00:18:44.310
And I did a video
about it, called,

00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:46.580
"The Biological Advantage
of Being Awestruck," where

00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:49.270
he says, our capacity to
awe makes us work harder

00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:51.452
to survive because of the
bliss we get from it--

00:18:51.452 --> 00:18:52.160
ERIK DAVIS: Yeah.

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:53.350
JASON SILVA: And that that's
why I was biologically

00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:54.120
selected for.

00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:54.870
ERIK DAVIS: Right.

00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:56.809
JASON SILVA: It makes
us be impregnated

00:18:56.809 --> 00:18:59.100
with meaning because of that
feeling of being connected

00:18:59.100 --> 00:18:59.725
with something.

00:18:59.725 --> 00:19:04.262
It's almost like the idea that
the brain has a god hack in it.

00:19:04.262 --> 00:19:04.970
ERIK DAVIS: Yeah.

00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:06.890
JASON SILVA: That the reason
that god hack was preselected

00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:09.060
for was because it makes us
feel like we are holy beings,

00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:10.860
and that makes us fight
harder to survive.

00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:13.319
ERIK DAVIS: Particularly, in
terms of a group collectivity.

00:19:13.319 --> 00:19:14.068
JASON SILVA: Yeah.

00:19:14.068 --> 00:19:16.200
ERIK DAVIS: Like religion
clearly exists partly

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:19.200
not just as an
ideological control,

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:20.480
a mind control kind of thing.

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:21.230
JASON SILVA: Yeah.

00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:23.063
ERIK DAVIS: It's also
a way of orchestrating

00:19:23.063 --> 00:19:25.050
our affects, and
our experiences,

00:19:25.050 --> 00:19:27.250
and our sense of
awe and communion

00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:29.680
so that we collectively
begin to identify

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:32.540
with shared myths, shared
rituals that bring us

00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:36.360
into resonance and allow us
to survive and to prosper

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:37.400
as a collectivity.

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:37.610
JASON SILVA: Right.

00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:39.540
ERIK DAVIS: I think one of the
problems that we have right now

00:19:39.540 --> 00:19:41.706
is that you can just see
there's so much dissension.

00:19:41.706 --> 00:19:44.640
There's so much violence
between religion,

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:47.230
and people, different
perspectives that in a way,

00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:52.560
we're like how do we tap
into that potential for awe,

00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:55.170
that potential for
compassionate, blissful

00:19:55.170 --> 00:19:58.630
connection with an idea,
with people, with ritual--

00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:03.980
but somehow, take it out of the
parochial quality and the sort

00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:05.050
of tribal quality?

00:20:05.050 --> 00:20:08.120
It's like we both
want, we need some

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:11.190
of the essence of
tribalism to return

00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:14.340
to in the breakdown
and the dirty,

00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:15.670
the breakdown of progress.

00:20:15.670 --> 00:20:18.870
And yet, that tribalism
also has within it

00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:21.350
a lot of the most
terrifying possibilities

00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:24.580
of growth of fascism, of
a hatred, and increasing--

00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:25.371
JASON SILVA: Right.

00:20:25.371 --> 00:20:26.530
Because we've seen
people share in that.

00:20:26.530 --> 00:20:28.360
They bond over their
hate over something.

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:31.040
ERIK DAVIS: So when I
see even the conflict now

00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:33.400
with the Republicans
and the Democrats

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:38.920
and just how nasty it's
gotten, how worse--

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:42.430
it seems like the rules
are being broken down.

00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:43.600
It's more feral.

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:45.680
It's more out of control.

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:48.030
That sense, which I think
is pervasive in our society,

00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:51.950
it has that real scary
question of where

00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:54.550
does a certain kind of
tribalism-- I believe this.

00:20:54.550 --> 00:20:57.239
You guys are all crazy, and I
have the websites to prove it.

00:20:57.239 --> 00:20:58.030
JASON SILVA: Right.

00:20:58.030 --> 00:21:00.220
ERIK DAVIS: Everything
feeds back on itself.

00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:03.360
And yet, there's something
in that connection,

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:07.130
that bond that's very archaic
that we're working on.

00:21:07.130 --> 00:21:10.030
JASON SILVA: So how do we
dissolve those boundaries?

00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:12.832
McKenna used to talk about get
on an airplane flight 12 hours

00:21:12.832 --> 00:21:14.290
and go into another
reality tunnel.

00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:16.930
And once you get to have a
visceral experience of how

00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:19.392
other people live, you tend to
be a little less judgmental.

00:21:19.392 --> 00:21:21.850
You start to realize there's
not so many rights and wrongs.

00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:22.830
It's just different.

00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:23.210
ERIK DAVIS: Yeah.

00:21:23.210 --> 00:21:24.668
JASON SILVA: But
my question that I

00:21:24.668 --> 00:21:28.820
wanted to ask you was we're
seeing a revolution now

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:31.310
that's connected to that
idea of dissolving boundaries

00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:33.110
with psychedelic research.

00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:34.970
McKenna used to say,
computers are drugs,

00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:36.460
and drugs are computers.

00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:39.280
They're basically
computers for inner space.

00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:42.260
And we are seeing society
have a turnaround,

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:43.860
a change in the attitudes.

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:45.770
Marijuana is
probably going to be

00:21:45.770 --> 00:21:49.310
made federally legal very soon.

00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:51.600
Psilocybin studies, where
people with terminal cancer

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:54.350
have been given magic
mushrooms reconfiguring

00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:56.800
their whole perception
of life and death.

00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:59.110
Do you think that this is a
step in the right direction

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:01.800
for potentially
the instantiation

00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:03.970
of a new kind of consciousess?

00:22:03.970 --> 00:22:07.970
Like club culture-- you
go to a party in Vegas,

00:22:07.970 --> 00:22:10.460
or a party in Miami Beach,
and that is the expression

00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:12.780
of party, alcohol culture.

00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:15.650
Our drugs turn it
into our environments.

00:22:15.650 --> 00:22:18.625
Our intoxicants are then
reflected in how we hang,

00:22:18.625 --> 00:22:20.750
and where we hang, and what
the places we hang look

00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:21.900
like and feel like.

00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:25.730
As more people start to
turn on, as the culture

00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:29.660
of these entheogenic substances
becomes more accepted,

00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:31.047
how will that change the world?

00:22:31.047 --> 00:22:31.755
ERIK DAVIS: Yeah.

00:22:31.755 --> 00:22:32.520
JASON SILVA: Not
to get all Utopian.

00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:33.850
ERIK DAVIS: No, no.

00:22:33.850 --> 00:22:36.020
A lot of things will
be happening at once.

00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:39.400
I never underestimate the
capacity for human beings

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:40.559
to degrade the sublime.

00:22:40.559 --> 00:22:41.350
JASON SILVA: Right.

00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:43.460
ERIK DAVIS: And
you could even take

00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:45.340
that even with looking
at party culture

00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:49.730
and how MDMA and ecstasy,
whatever's being sold as MDMA,

00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:52.640
and those had to have very
different expressions.

00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:55.499
There's something very
Utopian about the rave scene,

00:22:55.499 --> 00:22:57.290
and there are aspects
of it that are really

00:22:57.290 --> 00:23:01.400
just an extension of that
alcohol, crass party thing.

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:02.260
Which is fine.

00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:07.000
It's part of our human baggage
as well to not be judgmental,

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.620
but it also shows
that initially, MDMA

00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:13.420
was seen as oh, this
is maybe a panacea.

00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:16.620
This is the Utopian pill
that we need to create

00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:17.980
bonding and connection.

00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:20.300
JASON SILVA: 10 years of
couples' therapy in a pill.

00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:22.627
ERIK DAVIS: And of
course, the results

00:23:22.627 --> 00:23:23.835
are a little more fragmented.

00:23:23.835 --> 00:23:26.110
And I think something like that
will happen with psychedelics,

00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:26.610
as well.

00:23:26.610 --> 00:23:29.620
On the other hand, it's an
obviously extremely positive

00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:34.610
development-- one factor that
does seem to stay with people.

00:23:34.610 --> 00:23:36.110
Because that's one
of the questions.

00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:39.140
You can have awesome
experiences--

00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:44.030
transcendent, sublime, cosmic,
all the beautiful adjectives

00:23:44.030 --> 00:23:44.610
in the world.

00:23:44.610 --> 00:23:45.360
JASON SILVA: Yeah.

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:48.530
ERIK DAVIS: The question of
how it changes people over time

00:23:48.530 --> 00:23:50.190
is much more murky.

00:23:50.190 --> 00:23:54.720
It's not clear that
if there's anything

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:58.900
inherent in any experience to
change someone permanently,

00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:01.030
where true transformation
comes from,

00:24:01.030 --> 00:24:02.680
is much more of a
difficult question.

00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:03.660
JASON SILVA: Mm-hmm.

00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:05.630
ERIK DAVIS: You get a
bliss junkie, people fall

00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:07.297
into addiction; they revert.

00:24:07.297 --> 00:24:09.130
There's all sorts of
things that can happen.

00:24:09.130 --> 00:24:09.880
JASON SILVA: Yeah.

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:13.830
ERIK DAVIS: But one thing that
seems to be, studies show,

00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:19.347
as a result of psychedelic use
is greater openness to novelty.

00:24:19.347 --> 00:24:20.180
JASON SILVA: Mm-hmm.

00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:22.530
ERIK DAVIS: That there
seems to be a genuine sense

00:24:22.530 --> 00:24:25.290
that the nervous system, the
mind, whatever you want to say,

00:24:25.290 --> 00:24:31.030
the soul gets better at
handling questions, ambiguities,

00:24:31.030 --> 00:24:32.589
boundaries, and others.

00:24:32.589 --> 00:24:33.380
JASON SILVA: Right.

00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:36.600
ERIK DAVIS: And for me,
you mentioned the other

00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:38.300
at the beginning of
this conversation.

00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:40.730
For me, increasingly as I
think about these things,

00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:43.730
as I think about spirituality,
I think about ecology,

00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:46.900
as I think about psychedelics,
as I think about what are we

00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:49.200
doing with all of our
devices, it really

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:53.270
comes into how are we
getting closer to the others.

00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:54.020
JASON SILVA: Yeah.

00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:56.669
ERIK DAVIS: And by the
others, I mean the cosmos.

00:24:56.669 --> 00:24:57.460
JASON SILVA: Right.

00:24:57.460 --> 00:24:58.670
ERIK DAVIS: I mean animals.

00:24:58.670 --> 00:24:58.930
JASON SILVA: Yeah.

00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:00.116
ERIK DAVIS: I mean microbes.

00:25:00.116 --> 00:25:00.865
JASON SILVA: Yeah.

00:25:00.865 --> 00:25:02.500
ERIK DAVIS: I mean circuits.

00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:03.920
I mean databases.

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:08.130
I mean this non-human,
ahuman world

00:25:08.130 --> 00:25:10.870
that we're absolutely,
inextricably enmeshed

00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:16.099
in that is in some sense
alive with its own--

00:25:16.099 --> 00:25:18.140
not just in the sense that
the animals are alive,

00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:20.794
but the whole system
has a spriteliness.

00:25:20.794 --> 00:25:21.960
JASON SILVA: There's agency.

00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:23.230
The matrix has meaning.

00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:24.369
The matrix is alive.

00:25:24.369 --> 00:25:26.410
So I want to talk to you
a little bit about that,

00:25:26.410 --> 00:25:30.800
as well, because now, in
order to be able to witness,

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:34.010
to make observations
about this aliveness,

00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:37.124
to alter our experience of the
world enough that it becomes

00:25:37.124 --> 00:25:39.040
reenchanged that we feel
more connected to it,

00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:40.623
that we feel more
compassionate to it.

00:25:40.623 --> 00:25:42.730
And then we're alive
to the magic of being--

00:25:42.730 --> 00:25:44.821
we need to be playing
with subjectivity,

00:25:44.821 --> 00:25:46.070
which is an obsession of mine.

00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:47.070
You've written about it.

00:25:47.070 --> 00:25:49.040
You wrote an essay called
"Experienced Design

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:51.635
and the Design of Experience,"
where you describe experience

00:25:51.635 --> 00:25:54.750
as an evanescent flux of
sensation and perception

00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:57.910
that is, in a way, all
we have, and all we are.

00:25:57.910 --> 00:26:01.500
And you say that new media
technologies, the culture

00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:03.420
production of
media technologies,

00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:05.510
needs to get better
and has to acknowledge

00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:10.410
that what it's trying to do is
engage the technical material

00:26:10.410 --> 00:26:11.735
of subjectivity itself.

00:26:11.735 --> 00:26:12.030
ERIK DAVIS: Mm-hmm.

00:26:12.030 --> 00:26:14.571
JASON SILVA: That our cultural
technologies are becoming more

00:26:14.571 --> 00:26:17.310
like roller coasters than
like movies and books,

00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:19.650
that we are hacking
the body, mind,

00:26:19.650 --> 00:26:20.900
and being taken to new places.

00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:22.160
ERIK DAVIS: Mm-hmm.

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:24.900
JASON SILVA: Talk to me a
little bit about subjectivity

00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:26.180
and how we play with it.

00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:26.930
ERIK DAVIS: Right.

00:26:26.930 --> 00:26:29.330
JASON SILVA: You use
the term "heterotopia"

00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:31.500
to create, to describe,
the buzz that happens

00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:33.610
at certain gatherings
and conferences when

00:26:33.610 --> 00:26:35.950
people that share certain
values come together.

00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:38.140
And you start to
enter this other space

00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:40.192
with these people,
or the space when

00:26:40.192 --> 00:26:42.650
you're talking to somebody on
a telephone across the ocean.

00:26:42.650 --> 00:26:44.220
Where is your mind
in that moment?

00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:44.570
ERIK DAVIS: Mm-hmm.

00:26:44.570 --> 00:26:45.990
JASON SILVA: Tell me
about heterotopia,

00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:48.545
and playing with subjectivity,
and mediating subjectivity.

00:26:48.545 --> 00:26:49.170
ERIK DAVIS: OK.

00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:52.900
Well, I start talking
about heterotopia.

00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:55.560
That's a term from Foucault.

00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:57.430
And what he's trying
to point to is

00:26:57.430 --> 00:27:00.970
that we have an idea of utopia,
of like some perfect place

00:27:00.970 --> 00:27:02.160
where everything works out.

00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:02.910
JASON SILVA: Yeah.

00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:04.430
ERIK DAVIS: And
he's like, maybe.

00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:05.190
Good luck.

00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:07.910
But hetertopia is a
place where otherness

00:27:07.910 --> 00:27:10.127
is allowed to run riot.

00:27:10.127 --> 00:27:10.960
JASON SILVA: Uh-huh.

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:15.140
ERIK DAVIS: So an easy
example with qualifications

00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:17.990
would be something like
Burning Man, where people go.

00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:20.760
And particularly
early on when there

00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:24.320
were less cultural ideas of how
you were supposed to behave,

00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:26.900
and what it was meant, and what
clothing was supposed to be,

00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:28.340
and the furry hats.

00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:31.950
And all of it develops its
own-- heterotopia never lasts.

00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:35.840
It's always an evanescent point
where people come together,

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:38.170
and there's a kind of
open-ended question of we

00:27:38.170 --> 00:27:40.880
don't know what social
interaction is going to be.

00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:42.900
We don't know what
subjectivity is going to be,

00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:44.940
how our connections are
going to happen here.

00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:47.660
And I think there's a part
of us that really seeks that,

00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:51.150
because we recognize in that the
possibility that things could

00:27:51.150 --> 00:27:54.030
be done other than they are,
that the world doesn't have

00:27:54.030 --> 00:27:55.530
to be the way it that it is.

00:27:55.530 --> 00:27:57.125
JASON SILVA: But that's
thrilling, because then we

00:27:57.125 --> 00:27:59.280
transcend Michael Pollan's
been there's and done

00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:00.430
that's of the adult mind.

00:28:00.430 --> 00:28:01.138
ERIK DAVIS: Yeah.

00:28:01.138 --> 00:28:05.070
JASON SILVA: The existential
boredom, or despair, or belief

00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:06.070
that you've seen it all.

00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:07.653
And there's nothing
else to be excited

00:28:07.653 --> 00:28:09.820
about for a novelty
junkies, for people

00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:11.820
who get a thrill from the
idea of something new,

00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:14.502
of something more, that
seems to be the antidote.

00:28:14.502 --> 00:28:15.210
ERIK DAVIS: Yeah.

00:28:15.210 --> 00:28:17.251
JASON SILVA: Anything that
triggers an experience

00:28:17.251 --> 00:28:20.330
that there could be
something else is addicting.

00:28:20.330 --> 00:28:21.199
ERIK DAVIS: Yeah.

00:28:21.199 --> 00:28:21.990
JASON SILVA: Right?

00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:23.520
ERIK DAVIS: And
that's a good point.

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:26.810
Once it becomes addicting,
if it really is addicting,

00:28:26.810 --> 00:28:28.530
then something
more complicated is

00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:34.640
entered than just the sort
of generosity and richness

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:37.400
of such experiences, because
they become a little bit--

00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:39.900
JASON SILVA: Because now, you
know what you want from them--

00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:40.810
ERIK DAVIS: [INAUDIBLE],
and you got this.

00:28:40.810 --> 00:28:42.310
So there that's
part of the trap.

00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:43.559
That's part of the dielectric.

00:28:43.559 --> 00:28:46.660
And for me what it
means, part of the idea

00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:49.260
about subjectivity and
becoming more aware

00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:52.150
of how our subjectivity
is produced

00:28:52.150 --> 00:28:57.270
is that even as we refine
and extend our pleasures,

00:28:57.270 --> 00:28:59.830
our enjoyment, our
capacity for intensity,

00:28:59.830 --> 00:29:03.340
our capacity for transcendence,
for connections with others,

00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:05.660
that there also
has to be and will

00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:07.910
be either by ourselves
or by the people

00:29:07.910 --> 00:29:11.340
who are producing those
experiences, an increasingly,

00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:14.670
let's say, third person
understanding of how

00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:16.020
those things come about.

00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:17.335
What are the forces that are--

00:29:17.335 --> 00:29:19.710
JASON SILVA: The anthropology
tests make the observations

00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:20.490
from the outside.

00:29:20.490 --> 00:29:21.240
ERIK DAVIS: Right.

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:23.890
Or the technologist
who's tweaking the device

00:29:23.890 --> 00:29:25.289
that you're using to get off.

00:29:25.289 --> 00:29:26.080
JASON SILVA: Right.

00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:30.630
ERIK DAVIS: So to my mind,
expanded consciousness

00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:34.650
is not just the exaltation,
especially the exaltation

00:29:34.650 --> 00:29:36.200
produced from technologies.

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:38.230
JASON SILVA: The expertise as
to what it takes to get there.

00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:39.063
ERIK DAVIS: Exactly.

00:29:39.063 --> 00:29:40.740
And so it's a movement.

00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:43.920
It's a movement where
we move into intensity.

00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:45.600
We take everything
we can from it.

00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:46.390
We enjoy it.

00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:49.430
We draw from it,
and we feed it back

00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:51.035
into a more critical
understanding

00:29:51.035 --> 00:29:52.320
of what's leading to this.

00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:52.560
JASON SILVA: Right.

00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:53.810
ERIK DAVIS: What's
actually behind it?

00:29:53.810 --> 00:29:54.601
JASON SILVA: Right.

00:29:54.601 --> 00:29:56.229
ERIK DAVIS: What
are the entailments?

00:29:56.229 --> 00:29:57.270
What are the connections?

00:29:57.270 --> 00:29:57.730
JASON SILVA: Yeah.

00:29:57.730 --> 00:29:58.480
ERIK DAVIS: And
that's where you start

00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:01.000
to get involved with a more
critical sense of who's

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.530
actually making money from this?

00:30:02.530 --> 00:30:04.760
What are they
doing with my data?

00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:09.110
And so I think that
both sides of that,

00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:12.700
it is what it means to
become more and more intimate

00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:13.520
with subjectivity.

00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:15.770
JASON SILVA: So we've been
talking about subjectivity,

00:30:15.770 --> 00:30:16.410
right?

00:30:16.410 --> 00:30:19.610
The nature of lived experience.

00:30:19.610 --> 00:30:22.360
Now, I'm a fan of
ecstatic states.

00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:25.870
I'm a fan of flow states
when you feel your best,

00:30:25.870 --> 00:30:27.007
and you perform your best.

00:30:27.007 --> 00:30:28.340
ERIK DAVIS: It's wonderful, huh?

00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:29.090
JASON SILVA: Yeah.

00:30:29.090 --> 00:30:32.090
Steven Kotler and Jamie Wheal
of the Flow Genome Project

00:30:32.090 --> 00:30:36.310
talk about advances in
technology, psychopharmacology,

00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:39.940
neurobiology, and psychology,
the four pillars that

00:30:39.940 --> 00:30:43.620
are allowing us to peer beneath
the hood of what's going on

00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:45.780
in our brain during
these ethereal,

00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:50.250
mysterious, numinous
mind states.

00:30:50.250 --> 00:30:54.910
But I want to talk to you
about the subjective experience

00:30:54.910 --> 00:30:57.310
of subjective
states that we love.

00:30:57.310 --> 00:31:00.490
You once gave a talk where you
talked about dream walking.

00:31:00.490 --> 00:31:02.590
You go through certain
urban settings,

00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:04.590
and you're able to catalyze
a mood where you're

00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:08.170
able to actually be
receptive to the fact

00:31:08.170 --> 00:31:10.290
that architecture,
objects, streets,

00:31:10.290 --> 00:31:12.939
buildings, cathedrals--
architecture talks to you.

00:31:12.939 --> 00:31:13.730
ERIK DAVIS: Mm-hmm.

00:31:13.730 --> 00:31:15.380
JASON SILVA: When you design
something, it has shape.

00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:16.570
It has a form factor.

00:31:16.570 --> 00:31:21.650
There's agency, and intention,
and a language to the forms

00:31:21.650 --> 00:31:23.092
and figures that we make.

00:31:23.092 --> 00:31:23.800
ERIK DAVIS: Yeah.

00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:26.210
JASON SILVA: When you walk
around Prague, or Berlin,

00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:27.960
or Amsterdam, and
New York, if you

00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:30.660
were in the right
receptive, subject state,

00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:32.430
the world of objects
talks to you.

00:31:32.430 --> 00:31:33.390
There's an animism.

00:31:33.390 --> 00:31:33.800
ERIK DAVIS: Mm-hmm.

00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:34.780
JASON SILVA: Right?

00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:39.380
How do we turn on our
openness to that animism

00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:42.225
versus the normal operating
baseline consciousness

00:31:42.225 --> 00:31:44.850
which is task oriented, and I've
got to get from here to there?

00:31:44.850 --> 00:31:45.050
ERIK DAVIS: Yeah.

00:31:45.050 --> 00:31:47.050
JASON SILVA: And I'm not
stopping and staring up

00:31:47.050 --> 00:31:48.930
at the cathedral for
15 minutes, marveling

00:31:48.930 --> 00:31:51.100
at the forms of the concrete--

00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:51.870
ERIK DAVIS: Sure.

00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:54.360
JASON SILVA: --the mindedness
in the animated world.

00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:55.510
How do you get there?

00:31:55.510 --> 00:31:57.090
How do people get there?

00:31:57.090 --> 00:31:59.090
ERIK DAVIS: You're asking
a really key question.

00:31:59.090 --> 00:32:02.930
It's not easy, because the
world, the empire of work

00:32:02.930 --> 00:32:04.340
is also everywhere we go.

00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:04.460
JASON SILVA: Right.

00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:06.543
ERIK DAVIS: That's part
of what it means to always

00:32:06.543 --> 00:32:08.100
be online and always be--

00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:08.810
JASON SILVA: [INAUDIBLE] exhist.

00:32:08.810 --> 00:32:09.560
ERIK DAVIS: Right.

00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:14.100
And in my experience,
my answers,

00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:17.679
my practices tend to not be
particularly technologized.

00:32:17.679 --> 00:32:18.470
JASON SILVA: Right.

00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:20.954
ERIK DAVIS: Like while I
appreciate the kinds of things

00:32:20.954 --> 00:32:23.370
that cinema can deliver, that
virtual reality can deliver,

00:32:23.370 --> 00:32:26.100
that games can deliver,
there's a lot of ways

00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:30.020
in which even pharmacology,
even raves or whatever,

00:32:30.020 --> 00:32:35.492
that my answer to your questions
are more simple and embodied.

00:32:35.492 --> 00:32:37.450
And they really have a
lot to do with the body.

00:32:37.450 --> 00:32:38.340
JASON SILVA: OK.

00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:42.550
ERIK DAVIS: And not just states
of mind, but really, this body,

00:32:42.550 --> 00:32:43.990
that there's a way of walking.

00:32:43.990 --> 00:32:45.100
There's a way of holding.

00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:47.970
And those are things that in
some ways, are personal to me,

00:32:47.970 --> 00:32:51.480
that I've discovered in my
body, because of the way

00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:53.947
it's constructed over
a long period of time.

00:32:53.947 --> 00:32:54.780
JASON SILVA: Mm-hmm.

00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:56.640
ERIK DAVIS: But I
think that there's

00:32:56.640 --> 00:33:03.050
a way of learning the subtle
edges of consciousness, which

00:33:03.050 --> 00:33:07.480
are almost imperceptible, unless
you're really looking for them

00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:09.530
or have a good
structure to see what

00:33:09.530 --> 00:33:13.020
they are, that a lot
of very ordinary states

00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:17.290
conceal right inside of
them fabulous opportunities.

00:33:17.290 --> 00:33:18.730
JASON SILVA: Mm-hmm.

00:33:18.730 --> 00:33:22.070
ERIK DAVIS: The mind that
takes the daydreaming mind.

00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:23.330
The mind that takes a nap.

00:33:23.330 --> 00:33:24.080
JASON SILVA: Yeah.

00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:25.760
ERIK DAVIS: The mind
that spaces out,

00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:29.860
that stops staring at
the field in front,

00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:33.730
and opens the ears to take
in the totality of the sound.

00:33:33.730 --> 00:33:34.480
JASON SILVA: Yeah.

00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:37.200
ERIK DAVIS: If you start
to develop these simple--

00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:38.830
it's like meditation.

00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:42.947
But it's more like
meditation on perception on--

00:33:42.947 --> 00:33:44.530
JASON SILVA: Playing
with perception--

00:33:44.530 --> 00:33:46.280
ERIK DAVIS: Yeah,
playing with perception,

00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:49.960
that that can actually
provide over time.

00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:51.960
It's like meditation like
a lot of these things.

00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:52.880
It's not instant--

00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:54.095
JASON SILVA: Right.

00:33:54.095 --> 00:33:56.515
ERIK DAVIS: --a remarkably
more enchanted world.

00:33:56.515 --> 00:33:57.640
JASON SILVA: I have to ask.

00:33:57.640 --> 00:34:00.940
Most people, if
they want to unwind,

00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:03.584
they'll have a glass of wine.

00:34:03.584 --> 00:34:05.000
They'll have a
glass of champagne.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:05.990
They'll have a vodka.

00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:09.199
It does something specific to
your subjective experience.

00:34:09.199 --> 00:34:10.659
It loosens your inhibitions.

00:34:10.659 --> 00:34:12.639
It might make you more horny.

00:34:12.639 --> 00:34:14.760
There is a specific use
for that intoxicant.

00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:15.170
ERIK DAVIS: Mm-hmm.

00:34:15.170 --> 00:34:16.790
JASON SILVA: The
majority of Americans

00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:20.170
now support marijuana
legalization.

00:34:20.170 --> 00:34:22.580
Obviously, for
medicinal purposes.

00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:24.874
But also, like in the
Michael Pollan article

00:34:24.874 --> 00:34:26.540
on the psychedelic
renaissance, the idea

00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:28.489
of making well people better.

00:34:28.489 --> 00:34:29.280
ERIK DAVIS: Mm-hmm.

00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:32.024
JASON SILVA: David Lenson,
in his book on drugs,

00:34:32.024 --> 00:34:33.690
he's a comparative
literature professor,

00:34:33.690 --> 00:34:37.210
wrote a chapter on cannabis and
marijuana that blew my mind.

00:34:37.210 --> 00:34:39.250
He says that
essentially, marijuana

00:34:39.250 --> 00:34:43.250
fuses cognition and
dream and creates

00:34:43.250 --> 00:34:46.489
a reconcilable estrangement
with the world of perception

00:34:46.489 --> 00:34:47.900
without really distorting it.

00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:50.440
Now, the reconcilable
estrangement, he's a first.

00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:52.774
The world of the ordinary
becomes a little strange,

00:34:52.774 --> 00:34:54.340
and a little extraordinary.

00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:56.730
But then you get to
reengage with it because

00:34:56.730 --> 00:34:59.324
of its strangeness and
novelty and reconcile

00:34:59.324 --> 00:35:01.740
your relationship with the
world of perception and object.

00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:04.247
So somebody might get
high and listen to a song

00:35:04.247 --> 00:35:05.330
that they've always loved.

00:35:05.330 --> 00:35:06.746
But all of a sudden,
they remember

00:35:06.746 --> 00:35:08.010
why they've always loved it.

00:35:08.010 --> 00:35:10.850
It's soul-searing
intensity pierced directly

00:35:10.850 --> 00:35:14.060
into their brain, or why the
aesthete or the intellectual

00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:17.110
might smoke a joint before
going to the Guggenheim Museum,

00:35:17.110 --> 00:35:19.880
or the Amsterdam Museum
of the Moving Image.

00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:22.660
So as America's
attitudes about cannabis

00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:27.360
as medicinal and a recreational
substance comes online,

00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:29.170
how do you think we
will be able to start

00:35:29.170 --> 00:35:32.270
playing with this fusion
of cognition and dream

00:35:32.270 --> 00:35:34.290
to make ourselves
more perceptive

00:35:34.290 --> 00:35:35.559
to aesthetic experience?

00:35:35.559 --> 00:35:36.350
ERIK DAVIS: Mm-hmm.

00:35:36.350 --> 00:35:38.683
JASON SILVA: Because ultimately,
that's what it's about.

00:35:38.683 --> 00:35:40.310
You want the home
theater surround

00:35:40.310 --> 00:35:42.177
sound external technology.

00:35:42.177 --> 00:35:44.010
But maybe with the
legalization of cannabis,

00:35:44.010 --> 00:35:45.850
now, you can have the
internal technology

00:35:45.850 --> 00:35:48.862
that primes your brain to be
more open to that mediation.

00:35:48.862 --> 00:35:49.570
ERIK DAVIS: Yeah.

00:35:49.570 --> 00:35:53.800
For me, the surround sound
structure is too much.

00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:59.020
It's too invasive, and
it flattens the space

00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:03.632
of interaction and encounter
that I find on cannabis or not

00:36:03.632 --> 00:36:05.810
on cannabis, walking
in the woods,

00:36:05.810 --> 00:36:08.345
before a great work of art,
listening to a symphony,

00:36:08.345 --> 00:36:11.940
and listening to even a punk
show, or whatever, that there's

00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:15.850
a sort of space there that our
technology, as it's getting

00:36:15.850 --> 00:36:19.440
good at manipulating
our consciousness,

00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:21.850
really wants to move in
there, and really trigger

00:36:21.850 --> 00:36:25.660
fast, and really dial down, and
really get us online with it.

00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:28.860
And some people are exalting
about that opportunity.

00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:30.530
And I don't have a
judgment about that.

00:36:30.530 --> 00:36:33.240
I'm glad that
there are lab rats.

00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:37.420
I'm glad that there are post
humans who are plunging as far

00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:38.730
forward into that as they can.

00:36:38.730 --> 00:36:39.720
That's not my way.

00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:40.386
JASON SILVA: OK.

00:36:40.386 --> 00:36:41.850
ERIK DAVIS: And so
for me, when you

00:36:41.850 --> 00:36:45.260
talk about these opportunities,
it's a little bit more

00:36:45.260 --> 00:36:50.690
about how to bring the
edge of dream into reality.

00:36:50.690 --> 00:36:55.600
And so the way you're talking
about how cannabis opens up

00:36:55.600 --> 00:37:00.730
the first layers of
dream association--

00:37:00.730 --> 00:37:03.859
both weirdness and
greater intimacy.

00:37:03.859 --> 00:37:04.650
JASON SILVA: Right.

00:37:04.650 --> 00:37:06.608
ERIK DAVIS: And I think
it's really interesting

00:37:06.608 --> 00:37:09.730
to imagine that a lot of
people who maybe are turning

00:37:09.730 --> 00:37:13.080
to cannabis for medical reasons,
because they've always heard

00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:15.590
about it, now it doesn't
seem so bad-- the people who

00:37:15.590 --> 00:37:19.539
are able to have that encounter,
maybe that they've never been

00:37:19.539 --> 00:37:21.705
interested in the counter
culture, and drug culture,

00:37:21.705 --> 00:37:25.760
or anything, that because of
that aesthetic sensibility

00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:28.380
in particular, I
think that there

00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:31.690
is a really great opportunity
for people to whatever,

00:37:31.690 --> 00:37:34.980
join whatever-- get
out of the ruts.

00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:37.400
JASON SILVA: Yeah, and
Leary's ubiquitous idea

00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:40.950
of set and setting getting
fed back into the experience,

00:37:40.950 --> 00:37:43.660
you're changing the culture
in which people can enjoy

00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:45.920
these intoxicants responsibly.

00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:48.640
By changing the cultural context
in which they're enjoying it,

00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:50.370
you're changing the effect
that they're going to have,

00:37:50.370 --> 00:37:51.490
because they're not
going to feel scared.

00:37:51.490 --> 00:37:52.650
They're not going to
feel like deviants.

00:37:52.650 --> 00:37:54.560
Instead, they're going
to feel like they're

00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:57.290
having a drink, except a
slightly different effect,

00:37:57.290 --> 00:38:00.440
and then reengage with the world
through the lens of that prism.

00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:02.310
It could be interesting to see
how it affects consciousness.

00:38:02.310 --> 00:38:03.270
ERIK DAVIS: Yeah, absolutely.

00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:05.380
JASON SILVA: So something else
I'd like to bring up to you.

00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:06.840
We've talked about subjectivity.

00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:08.690
We talked about
altering our perception

00:38:08.690 --> 00:38:11.180
with external mediation
and technology,

00:38:11.180 --> 00:38:12.930
with internal technology.

00:38:12.930 --> 00:38:16.540
We've talked about our
hunger for something

00:38:16.540 --> 00:38:18.810
more, for a hidden door
to connect to something

00:38:18.810 --> 00:38:21.440
transcendent, to connect
something infinite

00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:24.620
to deal with our mortal coil.

00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:27.215
A film that resonated
with an entire generation,

00:38:27.215 --> 00:38:30.220
I think continues to
resonate is "The Matrix."

00:38:30.220 --> 00:38:34.020
So here, you have a film that
was a pop culture phenomenon.

00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:37.130
But it was a profound
philosophical meditation

00:38:37.130 --> 00:38:40.710
on the nature of reality, on
the desire for transcendence

00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:42.050
and for escape.

00:38:42.050 --> 00:38:45.460
And you probably
wrote, I confidently

00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:49.900
believe, the most magnificent
piece on "The Matrix"

00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:51.350
ever written.

00:38:51.350 --> 00:38:53.330
It's called, "Synthetic
Meditations."

00:38:53.330 --> 00:38:56.460
And I want to read
you a quote by you

00:38:56.460 --> 00:38:59.280
and have you comment on
it, because when I first

00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:04.880
saw the film, it unsettled
me and excited me,

00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:09.630
like certain sexual
situations, but for cognition.

00:39:09.630 --> 00:39:13.550
It just mentally made me
uncomfortable, but also

00:39:13.550 --> 00:39:17.110
secretly really excited
about what this means.

00:39:17.110 --> 00:39:21.130
And the scene in which Neo
takes the pill, for those who've

00:39:21.130 --> 00:39:25.100
seen the film, and then starts
melting into the mirror,

00:39:25.100 --> 00:39:27.750
you describe that scene
better than anybody.

00:39:27.750 --> 00:39:28.890
So I want to read it.

00:39:28.890 --> 00:39:31.840
So first, Morpheus
tells Neo, "No one

00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:34.600
can be told what the matrix is.

00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:37.520
You have to see
it for yourself."

00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:40.450
And then Erik Davis
sums up the scene.

00:39:40.450 --> 00:39:43.530
So like the serpent
in the Garden of Eden,

00:39:43.530 --> 00:39:46.420
Morpheus offers Neo a pill.

00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:49.690
Neo, of course, swallows
the molecular package,

00:39:49.690 --> 00:39:53.950
which is really the most
heroic act in the film,

00:39:53.950 --> 00:39:58.440
for Neo must then face
his own Cartesian passage

00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:02.130
through madness melting
into a mirror that

00:40:02.130 --> 00:40:06.160
alludes not only to Lewis
Carroll, "Alice in Wonderland,"

00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:09.270
but to the mystic,
psychotic collapse

00:40:09.270 --> 00:40:12.010
and disappearance of the
externalized ego that

00:40:12.010 --> 00:40:14.110
stabilizes our inner void.

00:40:14.110 --> 00:40:19.180
As Neo phases out of the matrix
he opens up, however briefly,

00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:21.880
the fractured bardo.

00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:26.400
That is, the secret thrill of
every fan of the false reality

00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:28.720
genre, myself included.

00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:34.510
The moment when baseline reality
dissolves, but no new world

00:40:34.510 --> 00:40:37.980
has yet emerged in
its pixilating wake.

00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:40.480
So it's when Neo starts
melting into the mirror

00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:42.780
and he's freaking
out, it's when Dorothy

00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:45.490
gets caught up in the
tornado and ends up in Oz.

00:40:45.490 --> 00:40:48.860
It's when we leave our
cognitive Kansas behind.

00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:52.140
It's the dream within a dream
sequence in "Inception."

00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:55.990
It's Willy Wonka's
chocolate factory.

00:40:55.990 --> 00:40:59.200
It's all of these stories,
the kiddie psychedelia

00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:01.270
and the modern
Gnostic pop culture.

00:41:01.270 --> 00:41:04.770
But why don't we go so
excited from being unsettled

00:41:04.770 --> 00:41:06.229
about the nature of reality?

00:41:06.229 --> 00:41:07.770
Isn't that supposed
to be just scary?

00:41:07.770 --> 00:41:08.090
ERIK DAVIS: Yeah.

00:41:08.090 --> 00:41:09.430
JASON SILVA: How can we like it?

00:41:09.430 --> 00:41:11.180
ERIK DAVIS: Yeah,
that's a great question.

00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:11.540
JASON SILVA: Thanks.

00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:13.520
ERIK DAVIS: I asked
myself that question,

00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:17.380
because I think like you, I
have to answer that more as much

00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:19.540
personally as sort
of objectively.

00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:23.030
I can talk like a historian
and say, well, the genre

00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:23.620
develops here.

00:41:23.620 --> 00:41:25.470
It's serving these
blah, blah, blah.

00:41:25.470 --> 00:41:28.050
But that doesn't answer why
I get the thrill out of it,

00:41:28.050 --> 00:41:31.330
why I have since I was a
kid, whether Philip K. Dick,

00:41:31.330 --> 00:41:32.915
or H. P. Lovecraft, or whatever.

00:41:32.915 --> 00:41:33.791
JASON SILVA: Right.

00:41:33.791 --> 00:41:34.290
Yes.

00:41:34.290 --> 00:41:36.490
ERIK DAVIS: And even
when I study religion

00:41:36.490 --> 00:41:38.280
and I'm really
interested in agnosticism

00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:39.920
and the history of
esoteracism, it's

00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:44.230
often from a similar point of
if I keep following this line,

00:41:44.230 --> 00:41:48.070
it might just start to turn
around a corner where now,

00:41:48.070 --> 00:41:52.870
I actually can't rely entirely
on my given map of reality.

00:41:52.870 --> 00:41:55.970
I think that's a
very healthy impulse

00:41:55.970 --> 00:42:00.420
to question this
framework, and I

00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:03.390
think that experiencing
it as a thrill

00:42:03.390 --> 00:42:09.290
is a truthful reflection
of the way in which we

00:42:09.290 --> 00:42:13.880
are forced to-- that it's always
something that happens to us.

00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:15.079
It's not just an idea.

00:42:15.079 --> 00:42:15.870
JASON SILVA: Right.

00:42:15.870 --> 00:42:16.840
ERIK DAVIS: It's not
just like oh, there's

00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:18.340
another world behind this world.

00:42:18.340 --> 00:42:22.670
It's an experience of
loss, which in a sense,

00:42:22.670 --> 00:42:25.332
is a little premonition
of the big loss.

00:42:25.332 --> 00:42:26.790
JASON SILVA: Leaving
the every day.

00:42:26.790 --> 00:42:27.050
ERIK DAVIS: Right.

00:42:27.050 --> 00:42:28.340
And it's a kind of death.

00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:29.050
JASON SILVA: Yes.

00:42:29.050 --> 00:42:31.560
ERIK DAVIS: That's
the point is that Neo

00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:33.750
has to die not
only to the world,

00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:36.230
but to the person he thought
he was, to the relationships

00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:38.550
that's sustain him, the
identity that sustains him,

00:42:38.550 --> 00:42:39.860
the job that he has.

00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:41.862
All of that, which
is a kind of death.

00:42:41.862 --> 00:42:42.570
JASON SILVA: Yep.

00:42:42.570 --> 00:42:44.903
ERIK DAVIS: And so the idea
that there is something more

00:42:44.903 --> 00:42:46.050
is pleasurable.

00:42:46.050 --> 00:42:48.590
But also, the sense that
there's something in us that

00:42:48.590 --> 00:42:51.327
can navigate such transitions.

00:42:51.327 --> 00:42:52.660
JASON SILVA: Something survives.

00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:54.740
There is a witness that
can move through worlds.

00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:55.490
ERIK DAVIS: Right.

00:42:55.490 --> 00:42:57.690
And dance with it,
and even move it.

00:42:57.690 --> 00:43:01.270
And I think part of this,
also, the secret encoded

00:43:01.270 --> 00:43:04.890
in the matrix is precisely
that this is also

00:43:04.890 --> 00:43:07.560
a film in which the
special effects that

00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:12.810
were most novel in that film,
which then of course, become

00:43:12.810 --> 00:43:15.760
ordinary in
subsequent iterations,

00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:20.260
has so much to do with
a ballet of movement,

00:43:20.260 --> 00:43:25.440
the manipulation of time,
moving through different speeds

00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:26.050
and slowness.

00:43:26.050 --> 00:43:26.800
JASON SILVA: Yeah.

00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:28.925
ERIK DAVIS: All of those,
to me, were an indication

00:43:28.925 --> 00:43:31.040
of the way in which
the films were encoding

00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:34.180
not just the false
reality genre, but also,

00:43:34.180 --> 00:43:38.700
a kind of almost a sort
of shamanic encouragement

00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:41.340
that you actually
have the capacity

00:43:41.340 --> 00:43:44.020
to navigate this
degree of uncertainty,

00:43:44.020 --> 00:43:47.690
this degree of not
knowing what's a fiction

00:43:47.690 --> 00:43:48.640
and what's a fact.

00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:48.910
JASON SILVA: Mm-hmm.

00:43:48.910 --> 00:43:51.243
ERIK DAVIS: And that's of
course, one of the main things

00:43:51.243 --> 00:43:53.620
that we face, that we're
already in this world

00:43:53.620 --> 00:43:56.130
and that is going to
become more intense

00:43:56.130 --> 00:44:01.030
is that division between
fiction and fact,

00:44:01.030 --> 00:44:05.590
that the hard reality
of where our bodies die,

00:44:05.590 --> 00:44:09.230
and the water tables
are collapsing,

00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:14.120
and people are manipulating
the economic system

00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:15.640
for a really untoward gains.

00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:15.920
JASON SILVA: Yeah.

00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:17.878
ERIK DAVIS: That's going
along at the same time

00:44:17.878 --> 00:44:20.110
at which there's this
profusion of fictions.

00:44:20.110 --> 00:44:22.490
In fact, it's really
hard to get at reality.

00:44:22.490 --> 00:44:26.890
If I'm like, gee, what happened
with the Boston bombing?

00:44:26.890 --> 00:44:28.870
It was weird.

00:44:28.870 --> 00:44:31.407
I want to find out what
really happened that day.

00:44:31.407 --> 00:44:33.740
JASON SILVA: Then people fall
into conspiracy theories--

00:44:33.740 --> 00:44:34.600
ERIK DAVIS: Where
am I going to go in?

00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:35.602
Which conspiracy theory?

00:44:35.602 --> 00:44:37.310
And then they're all
conspiracy theories,

00:44:37.310 --> 00:44:39.450
and then it's all
loose all of a sudden.

00:44:39.450 --> 00:44:40.200
JASON SILVA: Sure.

00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:42.110
ERIK DAVIS: And I'm in
my own private Idaho's

00:44:42.110 --> 00:44:44.500
flying blind, trying
to communicate,

00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:47.175
trying to coordinate some
consensus sense of reality.

00:44:47.175 --> 00:44:50.020
JASON SILVA: And then you get
into the Roswell stuff, UFOs,

00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:50.650
this and that.

00:44:50.650 --> 00:44:52.080
ERIK DAVIS: And I'm
saying that not to say,

00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:53.410
oh, we should be
conspiracy theorists,

00:44:53.410 --> 00:44:55.230
or oh, we shouldn't be
conspiracy theorists,

00:44:55.230 --> 00:44:57.120
because I wouldn't say
that either, by any means.

00:44:57.120 --> 00:44:57.911
JASON SILVA: Right.

00:44:57.911 --> 00:45:01.390
ERIK DAVIS: But it's more
that dance with fictions which

00:45:01.390 --> 00:45:05.040
is, in a way, the dance of the
matrix is part of our existence

00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:05.540
now.

00:45:05.540 --> 00:45:06.624
It's part of our politics.

00:45:06.624 --> 00:45:07.373
JASON SILVA: Yeah.

00:45:07.373 --> 00:45:09.190
ERIK DAVIS: It's part
of our self identity.

00:45:09.190 --> 00:45:09.910
JASON SILVA:
Everything is theater.

00:45:09.910 --> 00:45:10.900
ERIK DAVIS: It's part
of what we're doing.

00:45:10.900 --> 00:45:11.250
JASON SILVA:
Everything is theater.

00:45:11.250 --> 00:45:12.666
ERIK DAVIS:
Everything is theater.

00:45:12.666 --> 00:45:14.310
And there's some
scaries to that.

00:45:14.310 --> 00:45:16.240
There's some nihilism to that.

00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:19.190
There's a deep alienation
implied in that.

00:45:19.190 --> 00:45:23.460
And at the same time, there is
an invitation to a better play,

00:45:23.460 --> 00:45:25.580
or a better kind of performance.

00:45:25.580 --> 00:45:26.330
JASON SILVA: Yeah.

00:45:26.330 --> 00:45:29.310
Well, even just
cognitively, intellectually,

00:45:29.310 --> 00:45:32.550
and aesthetically,
for me I think,

00:45:32.550 --> 00:45:35.230
it provides a safe
place in which

00:45:35.230 --> 00:45:38.980
I can go to dangerous places
and ask dangerous questions

00:45:38.980 --> 00:45:40.000
with my mind.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.240
I think that Neo
taking the pill,

00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:44.259
and then me wondering
what's it going to do.

00:45:44.259 --> 00:45:45.800
And then he turns
right, and his arms

00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:48.760
starts to melt--
the freaky, almost

00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:52.170
schizophrenic disjointing
of everyday reality

00:45:52.170 --> 00:45:54.820
is the cognitive
equivalent of when

00:45:54.820 --> 00:45:56.970
you're going up on
the roller coaster

00:45:56.970 --> 00:46:00.030
before it's about to flip over
the top and drop insanely.

00:46:00.030 --> 00:46:03.080
You can't really even see the
bottom, because it's going up.

00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:04.830
And that feeling you
get in your stomach--

00:46:04.830 --> 00:46:07.790
the cognitive, intellectual
equivalent of that is now that.

00:46:07.790 --> 00:46:09.550
Or the dream within
the dream scenes

00:46:09.550 --> 00:46:11.620
in "Inception,"
where he explains

00:46:11.620 --> 00:46:13.780
that when he and his
wife went into the limo,

00:46:13.780 --> 00:46:15.880
the fourth layer,
then they decided

00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:17.760
to hide their little artifact.

00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:20.870
And then she forgot
that she was in a dream

00:46:20.870 --> 00:46:23.800
so that after living a whole
life there and him saying,

00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:25.800
this was all in a
limbo, let's wake up.

00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:28.330
Then she brought the
belief that that dream

00:46:28.330 --> 00:46:30.580
wasn't real into their
real waking state.

00:46:30.580 --> 00:46:33.280
And that's like a person
having a psychotic breakdown

00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:34.860
as a person that
can become convinced

00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:36.229
that this reality is not real.

00:46:36.229 --> 00:46:37.020
ERIK DAVIS: Mm-hmm.

00:46:37.020 --> 00:46:39.450
JASON SILVA: Because if you're
fully convinced, that's it.

00:46:39.450 --> 00:46:41.360
You're not tied into
the consensus trench.

00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:42.690
You're either in your
own personal heaven

00:46:42.690 --> 00:46:43.900
or your own personal hell.

00:46:43.900 --> 00:46:44.440
ERIK DAVIS: Yeah.

00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:46.023
JASON SILVA: And I
think that flirting

00:46:46.023 --> 00:46:48.880
with that in these kinds of
films gets certain people off.

00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:50.000
ERIK DAVIS: Right.

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:51.460
JASON SILVA: "Eternal Sunshine
of the Spotless Mind,"

00:46:51.460 --> 00:46:52.350
another example.

00:46:52.350 --> 00:46:53.058
ERIK DAVIS: Yeah.

00:46:53.058 --> 00:46:54.140
And that's also very old.

00:46:54.140 --> 00:46:57.100
If you go back in the history
of religion, particularly

00:46:57.100 --> 00:47:02.630
in India, there's very
ancient tales of dreams,

00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:05.780
within dreams, within dreams,
of people living entire lives,

00:47:05.780 --> 00:47:08.510
and then realizing that it was
all just a fantasy, a drama.

00:47:08.510 --> 00:47:09.360
JASON SILVA: Right.

00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:11.920
ERIK DAVIS: So that idea
is very fundamentally

00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:13.870
a part of human consciousness.

00:47:13.870 --> 00:47:17.560
And I think it has to do
with our experience of dream

00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:20.660
in a sense that this is not
a cultural construction.

00:47:20.660 --> 00:47:22.710
This is something
all human beings

00:47:22.710 --> 00:47:27.150
dream and all human beings
have been dreaming for tens,

00:47:27.150 --> 00:47:29.370
if not hundreds of
thousands of years.

00:47:29.370 --> 00:47:33.430
And one of the
conclusions from dream

00:47:33.430 --> 00:47:36.190
is that I can be very
much in a real world,

00:47:36.190 --> 00:47:38.080
and then not anymore.

00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:40.287
And that gap is
a gap of freedom.

00:47:40.287 --> 00:47:41.120
JASON SILVA: Mm-hmm.

00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:43.450
ERIK DAVIS: But in
a way, we can only

00:47:43.450 --> 00:47:47.740
get into that gap of freedom by
also risking either psychosis

00:47:47.740 --> 00:47:48.610
or death.

00:47:48.610 --> 00:47:48.990
JASON SILVA: Right.

00:47:48.990 --> 00:47:50.430
ERIK DAVIS: And that
that's part of the thrill,

00:47:50.430 --> 00:47:52.221
because we're just
getting a little flavor.

00:47:52.221 --> 00:47:53.360
A movie, it's safe.

00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:54.340
I'm in a cushy seat.

00:47:54.340 --> 00:47:55.300
I've got popcorn.

00:47:55.300 --> 00:47:56.091
JASON SILVA: Right.

00:47:56.091 --> 00:47:59.100
ERIK DAVIS: And yet, there
is a cognitive memory

00:47:59.100 --> 00:48:02.010
and anticipation of
other kinds of gaps

00:48:02.010 --> 00:48:03.501
that maybe are much more--

00:48:03.501 --> 00:48:05.000
JASON SILVA: Glitches
in the matrix.

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:05.770
ERIK DAVIS: Right.

00:48:05.770 --> 00:48:08.670
And that's partly then how
we navigate a culture that

00:48:08.670 --> 00:48:12.330
is changing so fast, that is so
full of fabricated realities,

00:48:12.330 --> 00:48:14.502
and that is so full
of glitches and noise.

00:48:14.502 --> 00:48:16.460
That's why for me, it's
always really important

00:48:16.460 --> 00:48:21.050
to pay attention to as
well as using a technology

00:48:21.050 --> 00:48:23.390
to get what you want, or
to enjoy what you're going

00:48:23.390 --> 00:48:26.290
to enjoy, and even
recognizing how

00:48:26.290 --> 00:48:31.240
it is a kind of congealed
dream of a possibility

00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:36.400
that at the same time
it's also a pain the ass.

00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:38.800
It brings along things
that I didn't intend.

00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:40.280
It doesn't work
the way I want to.

00:48:40.280 --> 00:48:42.240
And if I look into
the conditions

00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:44.430
under which it was made
and how it's being sold,

00:48:44.430 --> 00:48:46.680
and how it's entering
into people's lives.

00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:50.010
Then I see all sorts of
glitches, all sorts of cracks,

00:48:50.010 --> 00:48:51.719
all sorts of little
abysses that open up.

00:48:51.719 --> 00:48:52.551
JASON SILVA: Mm-hmm.

00:48:52.551 --> 00:48:54.550
ERIK DAVIS: And for
me, we're in a process

00:48:54.550 --> 00:48:57.160
now where both of those
minds have to be operatives.

00:48:57.160 --> 00:48:59.820
So I think that there's
something very powerful,

00:48:59.820 --> 00:49:03.990
as well as juicy about
these gaps, these glitches,

00:49:03.990 --> 00:49:08.370
these cracks, because that
is where our critique lies.

00:49:08.370 --> 00:49:13.310
That is where our willingness
to not buy the comforting dream

00:49:13.310 --> 00:49:13.810
lies.

00:49:13.810 --> 00:49:15.260
And so we learn
to play with that.

00:49:15.260 --> 00:49:16.510
JASON SILVA: And self correct.

00:49:16.510 --> 00:49:18.676
Well, it reminds me a little
bit of that Danny Boyle

00:49:18.676 --> 00:49:21.590
film, "The Beach," when
they find that island

00:49:21.590 --> 00:49:23.380
and then they go
to this paradise.

00:49:23.380 --> 00:49:25.280
And then the whole
idea is nobody

00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:27.490
wants to bust up the party.

00:49:27.490 --> 00:49:30.000
So when one of the characters
gets sick or one of them

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:31.950
gets bitten by a shark, they
just put him in the woods

00:49:31.950 --> 00:49:33.680
and throw him away so it's
out of sight, out of mind,

00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:34.760
because nobody
wants a buzz kill.

00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:34.990
ERIK DAVIS: Right.

00:49:34.990 --> 00:49:36.960
JASON SILVA: Nobody wants
the high to go away.

00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:37.260
ERIK DAVIS: Yeah.

00:49:37.260 --> 00:49:37.990
JASON SILVA: And I
think what you're saying

00:49:37.990 --> 00:49:41.090
and you're saying so well
is that even as these tools

00:49:41.090 --> 00:49:43.850
and technologies, the myth,
magic, and mysticism that's

00:49:43.850 --> 00:49:46.060
giving us so many
wonderful experiences,

00:49:46.060 --> 00:49:48.934
that we should still be mindful
of what it took to get there

00:49:48.934 --> 00:49:51.350
and what are the consequences
that it's causing so that we

00:49:51.350 --> 00:49:54.520
can remedy, self correct,
adjust, upgrade, and make sure

00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:57.760
that we are living
to our potential

00:49:57.760 --> 00:49:59.780
as people that
believe in justice

00:49:59.780 --> 00:50:01.260
and that sense of right.

00:50:01.260 --> 00:50:01.585
ERIK DAVIS: Absolutely.

00:50:01.585 --> 00:50:03.335
JASON SILVA: And that
we're not just bliss

00:50:03.335 --> 00:50:05.700
junkies at the expense
of, but rather,

00:50:05.700 --> 00:50:09.420
that we can bring
everybody into this waking

00:50:09.420 --> 00:50:11.250
dream, as we author it.

00:50:11.250 --> 00:50:12.260
ERIK DAVIS: Excellent.

00:50:12.260 --> 00:50:13.320
Well said.

00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:16.370
JASON SILVA: Dude, this has
been an absolute treat, just

00:50:16.370 --> 00:50:17.915
a cognitive thrill.

00:50:17.915 --> 00:50:20.690
You've taken me on the best
kind of roller coaster,

00:50:20.690 --> 00:50:21.690
"Alice in Wonderland."

00:50:21.690 --> 00:50:25.730
I've transcended my cognitive
Kansas and everything I liked.

00:50:25.730 --> 00:50:27.512
So thank you for
what you've produced.

00:50:27.512 --> 00:50:28.470
Thank you for existing.

00:50:28.470 --> 00:50:31.380
Thank you for "TechGnosis,"
which has been reprinted.

00:50:31.380 --> 00:50:35.276
And I think everybody should
read as part of their journey.

00:50:35.276 --> 00:50:36.650
ERIK DAVIS: People
still like it.

00:50:36.650 --> 00:50:37.920
It was written a while ago.

00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:41.020
And yet, it still resonates.

00:50:41.020 --> 00:50:44.610
It clearly inspires in some
way that I'm not entirely

00:50:44.610 --> 00:50:45.410
in control of.

00:50:45.410 --> 00:50:46.990
JASON SILVA: It comes through
you, but not from you,

00:50:46.990 --> 00:50:48.720
and though it is with you,
it belongs not to you.

00:50:48.720 --> 00:50:49.636
ERIK DAVIS: Excellent.

00:50:49.636 --> 00:50:51.660
Well put, well put.

00:50:51.660 --> 00:50:53.957
JASON SILVA: But whatever
it is you've channeled into,

00:50:53.957 --> 00:50:55.290
I just really want to thank you.

00:50:57.294 --> 00:50:59.460
This is the kind of book
that I like to take with me

00:50:59.460 --> 00:51:00.570
and I like to open to any page.

00:51:00.570 --> 00:51:02.778
And I like to read something
fascinating that usually

00:51:02.778 --> 00:51:06.030
triggers a shot of awe episode
and all kinds of cognitive

00:51:06.030 --> 00:51:06.687
thrills.

00:51:06.687 --> 00:51:08.270
So make sure you
pick up "TechGnosis."

00:51:08.270 --> 00:51:10.570

00:51:17.905 --> 00:51:19.720
Get "TechGnosis" today.

00:51:19.720 --> 00:51:21.690
And your podcast-- why
don't you tell everybody

00:51:21.690 --> 00:51:22.620
about your podcast?

00:51:22.620 --> 00:51:24.120
ERIK DAVIS: Well, it's
called "Expanding Mind,"

00:51:24.120 --> 00:51:25.960
and it's on the
progressive radio network.

00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:28.000
And it's been going
for about five years.

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:31.400
And we cover consciousness,
neuroscientist, spirituality,

00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:34.780
technology-- just zones that
are covered in this book.

00:51:34.780 --> 00:51:40.210
It's a weekly chat, very similar
to this-- informal but heady.

00:51:40.210 --> 00:51:41.190
JASON SILVA: Yes.

00:51:41.190 --> 00:51:43.200
ERIK DAVIS: And I have a
wonderful cohost, Maja D'Aoust,

00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:44.070
the white witch of LA.

00:51:44.070 --> 00:51:44.700
JASON SILVA: I love that.

00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:46.920
ERIK DAVIS: So got to
give a shout out to Maja.

00:51:46.920 --> 00:51:48.020
And we have a lot of fun.

00:51:48.020 --> 00:51:48.180
JASON SILVA: Yeah.

00:51:48.180 --> 00:51:49.610
So check out expanding minds.

00:51:49.610 --> 00:51:51.680
And thanks for watching
"Shots of Awe,"

00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:53.570
creative session
and conversation

00:51:53.570 --> 00:51:56.442
with the dazzling Erik Davis.

00:51:56.442 --> 00:51:57.525
ERIK DAVIS: I love it man.

00:51:57.525 --> 00:51:58.780
Your enthusiasm is great.

00:51:58.780 --> 00:51:59.779
JASON SILVA: Thanks man.

00:51:59.779 --> 00:52:01.030
It's all real bro.

00:52:01.030 --> 00:52:01.697
I can't help it.

00:52:01.697 --> 00:52:02.946
DOUGLAS RUSHKOFF: It could be.

00:52:02.946 --> 00:52:04.450
But for me, the
best part of a trip

00:52:04.450 --> 00:52:07.360
is always waking
up in the morning.

00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:09.520
Coming down is the good part.

00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:10.540
It should be anyway.

00:52:10.540 --> 00:52:12.956
Coming down is the part
where you're like, OK.

00:52:12.956 --> 00:52:14.330
JASON SILVA: What
have I learned?

00:52:14.330 --> 00:52:14.710
DOUGLAS RUSHKOFF: Yeah.

00:52:14.710 --> 00:52:16.420
What did I learn, and
how do I apply this?

00:52:16.420 --> 00:52:17.128
And what is this?

00:52:17.128 --> 00:52:19.040
And then you go
out in the woods,

00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:23.526
and you smell reality
again from that new place.

00:52:23.526 --> 00:52:24.650
And you realize, oh my god.

00:52:24.650 --> 00:52:28.328
I'm only 1% of what I could be.
