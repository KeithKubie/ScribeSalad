00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.488
When I say basic emotions, I mean emotions that are shared by all humans in all

00:00:03.488 --> 00:00:08.015
cultures, no matter where you are in the world. Then we have other emotions

00:00:08.015 --> 00:00:12.182
that are more unique to the human condition. These are called self-conscious

00:00:12.182 --> 00:00:16.426
emotions. Basic emotions are important for life tasks, such as protecting

00:00:16.426 --> 00:00:21.318
ourselves from danger or achieving a goal. The basic emotions are fear,

00:00:21.318 --> 00:00:27.200
discussed, anger, happiness, sadness, contempt, and surprised. Notice that all

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.350
of these, except happiness and arguably sometimes surprise, are negative

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:36.080
emotions. That is they involve unpleasant subjective feelings. There're many

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.132
distinct negative emotions. For example, anger is very different from disgust,

00:00:40.132 --> 00:00:45.233
which is very different from fear or sadness. They all involve different

00:00:45.233 --> 00:00:49.650
feelings and come from different things. On the other hand, happiness is

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:55.130
happiness and it's only just a little bit different from joy. The other set of

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.380
emotions, the self conscious emotions occur when we live up to or don't live up

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:03.917
to the expectations we set ourselves. The expectations of others or the rules

00:01:03.917 --> 00:01:07.679
set by society. These emotions require us to be able to reflect on our own

00:01:07.679 --> 00:01:12.238
behaviors. The self-conscious emotions are shame, guilt, humiliation,

00:01:12.238 --> 00:01:14.070
embarrassment and pride.
