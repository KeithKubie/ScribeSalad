00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:15.120
Look, I'm not being funny,
but investing in space travel

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:16.730
is a total waste of money.

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.699
Really? I’d say it’s been a pretty good
investment.

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:22.949
Come on, it's overly expensive,
just a drain on our resources.

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.119
We’re talking billions being given up,
and what we get for what we’ve bought is

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:29.880
never certain, we’re just splurging all
this cash into the ether.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.010
Sorry, I couldn’t hear you there over my
cordless vacuum cleaner.

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:35.610
Nice.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.130
"Whurrr"

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.070
Very mature...

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.520
Well, come on, tt seems that you’ve forgotten
All the things we get from it.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.370
Space travel gave us microchips,
memory foam, the internet.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.450
It gave us cat scans, insulation,
shoe insoles, smoke detectors,

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.300
baby food, Boba Fett,
mobile phones and phone protectors.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.739
It gave us LEDs, it gave us faster cars, better
engines...

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:02.039
Look, if you spent that much on anything
you’ll get at least a few inventions.

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.540
All I see is people out there singing David
Bowie anthems.

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.200
Don't you think we'd be better off
if we spent the cash on things that actually

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.100
happen,
you know, to people on this earth?

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.490
We do that too!

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.119
Really? It seems like nowhere near enough!
Whens the last time you heard of an catastrophe

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:19.740
occurring?
An earthquake hits, a tsunami strikes,

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.580
A hurricane emerges,
Or something worse than we’ve encountered,

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.390
whole nations ripped apart.
‘Sorry guys! There’s no supplies,

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.320
you’re going to have to starve,
we just sent our last trillion sending insects

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.170
up to mars!’

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.970
Fair enough, there’s costs,
But their relatively small,

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.409
and just because a mission sounds odd,
it doesn't mean it's not important.

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:42.590
I can't work out the use of hardly any of
their experiments.

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.280
Well let's start of with those disasters that
you mentioned:

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.049
Our advancements in meteorology have been
superb.

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:52.780
Thanks to space travel we can respond
to a disaster before it's even occurred.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.259
And when we respond we can rely
On GPS and mapping while

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:02.219
We communicate, share facts online
All of which requires….

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.409
Satellites!

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:06.600
Which we got from...

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.330
'Space travel'...

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:14.000
And you really want to stop all that research?
That just seems absurd, I mean

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.739
Think of the lives it has changed,
the lives it has saved,

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:19.160
The return could not be greater!

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.379
Yeah, maybe, if you were born north of the
equator

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:25.690
You think that just a few inventions go
and make a great investment! No!

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.280
Not when so many people around the world
Aren’t healthy, warm or fed or clothed.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.540
Space travel’s for the 1%, and those who
make the grade

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.760
as astronauts… well… they kind of look
the same.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.290
The same background, the same gender
The same skin tone, we’re investing

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.440
In a programme for the future it doesn’t
seem all that progressive

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.480
Yes, we need more diversity,
This world is far from equal

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:58.420
But I don't think that's a problem with space.
I think that’s a problem with people

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.970
Down here, we try divide ourselves
through status and possessions

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.650
Up there, we’re insignificant,
We’re sawdust, we’re just embers

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.670
we’re tiny, yet united in this blanket that
seems endless

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.700
That doesn’t care about sexuality, class,
skin tone or gender

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.450
Our differences are meaningless
to the universe. It sees through us

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.420
it unites us, it reminds us
that all of us are equal and

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.830
the more that we explore it,
the more we all are faced with it,

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.370
it permeates our culture
our music, entertainment.

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.060
Don’t you think that’s a mindset
that we should be engaging with?

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.430
Let’s say that we didn’t.
We all made the decision

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.299
to just give up on these missions.

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:36.040
Great! Great!

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.450
Then might as well face
that we’re just living in a prison

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:40.930
Really?

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.340
Yep, that’s it, we’re trapped!

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.310
We’d be fine! We’d easily get by!

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.590
Yes, but we would be a prison of our own design.
We need something there to reach for,

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.390
that’s what separates us from every other
creature.

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:59.049
But we can do that here; we just need a sensible
perspective

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:03.720
I’m sure there’s rocks and plants that
still need testing.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:13.230
Ok, fine. But you want to talk about investment?
99.999999% of stuff that we don’t know…

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.959
is up there,
in that direction.
