1
00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:01,700
Okay.

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:04,970
Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr and
it's time for the Thursday afternoon.

3
00:00:04,971 --> 00:00:09,530
Just before Friday. Monday
morning podcast. And Ah,

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,100
I'm just checking in on you.

5
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:18,530
I'm just checking and just seeing
how your week's going, you know,

6
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:21,680
you know, I would think if I
was in New York Yankee Fan,

7
00:00:21,681 --> 00:00:26,230
despite the fact we're only a couple
of games up for the one game playoff,

8
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,840
I would say that I'm having a pretty
good fucking Thursday. You know,

9
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:35,660
you see the last couple of games? Did
you see last night's game in particular?

10
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:37,940
I'm gonna tell you guys right now,

11
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:43,610
I am going to gradually wean
you off of watching ESPN,

12
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:48,110
Fox sports west,
listening to the fan.

13
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:52,420
Okay?
Nobody gets it right?

14
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:56,050
More Times in my own mind,

15
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:01,930
in my own world, without doing any
research on how any of those other people,

16
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:03,010
how many times they get it right?

17
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:08,010
Nobody gets it right more than the
manual listening to right fucking now,

18
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,950
what the fuck did I say? Well, Bill, you,

19
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,570
you've said a lot of things. All right,
fair enough. I have said a lot of things.

20
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:22,530
If I mentioned this fucking wires sucks.
Jesus Christ.

21
00:01:22,531 --> 00:01:27,150
God forbid I turn my fucking,
this is unbelievable. It's
a brand new fucking wire.

22
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:28,980
Does anything work?

23
00:01:28,981 --> 00:01:33,000
Is this how like China is going to slowly
like they know they can't fucking bomb

24
00:01:33,001 --> 00:01:37,110
us, right? So what do they do? They
just make everything just a little bit,

25
00:01:37,111 --> 00:01:40,980
not fucking right and it just, it's going
to gradually drive him fucking crazy.

26
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,250
Now what do I do?
I've got to move this thing over here.

27
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:48,150
Bring this up because God forbid
there's any weight on this wire.

28
00:01:48,151 --> 00:01:50,850
The second thing is weight.
All of a sudden it doesn't work.

29
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,340
Now it totally does it. Come
on. I need to hear myself.

30
00:01:53,341 --> 00:01:58,340
I need to hear myself talking about how
great I am. All right, there you go. Um,

31
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:03,810
I told you motherfuckers, I love how I'm
mad at you guys. Like you ever said no,

32
00:02:03,811 --> 00:02:07,770
you didn't bill, you never told
us that. Right? Fuck is my water.

33
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:12,260
Oh Jesus, this is going to be one of
these doll. There it is. There it is. Um,

34
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,040
I told you way back in fucking August
when the red sox swept the Yankees and

35
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:19,740
ESPs are fucking over.

36
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:25,880
What's over ESPN.
Oh,

37
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:28,520
I guess maybe a divisional race.
Who gives a fuck?

38
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,690
You know what I mean?
There's still the wild card

39
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:35,710
still the fucking wow.

40
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:41,840
That's like there's an ax murderer outside
you fucking house and you just lock

41
00:02:41,841 --> 00:02:44,680
the front door and you leave the
back door wide open. You're like,

42
00:02:44,681 --> 00:02:49,000
well I guess that takes care of that.
Not to mention if you have a wood door,

43
00:02:49,001 --> 00:02:52,810
you know,
but so motivated axe murderer,

44
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,200
you know,
he could just chop down the door.

45
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,740
Okay.

46
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:00,010
That actually would work in your favor.
It gives you time to try

47
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:04,480
to find something to defend, you know,
defend yourself is acts, you know,

48
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,510
tactically speaking will
be a little more dull

49
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:11,260
cause he'd gone through the front door.
But this is all beside the point.

50
00:03:11,261 --> 00:03:13,210
I told you mother fuckers back then I was,

51
00:03:13,211 --> 00:03:16,870
I can tilt David Price goes into the
fucking mellow folk and [inaudible] God

52
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:17,800
goddamn game.

53
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,400
I don't give a fuck that were out
there sweeping the Baltimore Orioles.

54
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:22,993
All right.

55
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,940
Regular season stats.
You know what that's like?

56
00:03:26,941 --> 00:03:31,650
That's like the guy who was the fucking
big man on campus in high school, right?

57
00:03:31,651 --> 00:03:34,410
He's a fucking lie.
He's a captain of this.

58
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:38,970
He's got the dimple in his fucking chair
and he's banging a fucking cheerleader,

59
00:03:38,971 --> 00:03:43,200
right? And everybody's like,
oh my God, Hey, she's going up.

60
00:03:43,201 --> 00:03:44,670
Or you're the president right

61
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,833
now.
What happens?

62
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:51,090
You go back to the reunion and
he looks like may no, he got me.

63
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:54,990
I'm just saying

64
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:02,100
like it doesn't make a difference if
you win 89 games or fucking 129 games.

65
00:04:03,251 --> 00:04:07,660
What murders is how you're doing against
the fucking teams that you're going to

66
00:04:07,661 --> 00:04:10,000
see in October.
You know?

67
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:15,150
But that's not the business that does
those so and so's over an ESPN and Fox

68
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:19,450
News and whoever else. I'm, I'm
lumping into the same fucking category.

69
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,980
That's not the game they're in.

70
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:26,090
They're in the game of what the
fuck you see is what the fuck it is.

71
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:29,720
And we will hype the shit out of
it and not even remotely look at it

72
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:34,620
analytically. So then if what
happens happens, you can be,

73
00:04:34,621 --> 00:04:35,880
like I said,
it was going to happen,

74
00:04:35,881 --> 00:04:38,630
but what you said was going to happen
doesn't happen. Then you get to do though.

75
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,750
What happened?

76
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:42,820
Yeah.

77
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:46,750
What happened was you got a namerd by a
bunch of fucking victories against the

78
00:04:46,751 --> 00:04:50,700
Orioles in the fucking tigers. A bunch
of Steve's or Jacob. I mean huge guys.

79
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:55,240
Gate gate hit black over 9,000 homerun
junior regular season, and yeah,

80
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:59,430
we're absolutely anemic in the
playoffs. Well, yeah. Well,

81
00:04:59,431 --> 00:05:02,070
how did they do against
the fucking Astros?

82
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,193
Sorry.

83
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:10,350
Anyways, you know what? You know what
that's like the, it's like watching Paul.

84
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,490
I love Paul the death.
I got to get him on the,

85
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,390
I have to get him on this fucking podcast
because I'm always making fun of them

86
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:19,020
and I want you guys to know that it
comes from a place of love. All right?

87
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:21,180
Most of the times it comes
from a place of love,

88
00:05:21,181 --> 00:05:24,720
but right now it comes
from a place of concern.

89
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,980
Okay. One of the dumbest fucking
things that you can do. Yeah.

90
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:34,820
Besides buying a fucking Goddamn
fucking speaker wire. I'm,

91
00:05:34,821 --> 00:05:39,210
I'm blaming it on China. Okay.
It's a, it's always a great guest.

92
00:05:39,211 --> 00:05:42,300
Everything's fucking made over
there. All right. It's like when,

93
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:44,240
when you get you eating a
doughnut, you're like, what?

94
00:05:44,241 --> 00:05:48,000
What's the main ingredient ingredient
in here? The one guests you have is corn

95
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:54,010
corners in everything.
If you don't believe me,

96
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:58,060
watch the one documentary I
ever watched about food and

97
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:02,600
have now are using that as my Bible.
I saw it years ago,

98
00:06:02,601 --> 00:06:05,690
so I'm probably misquoting it.
All right. Having said that, no,

99
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,950
what I just said was effect.

100
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,520
One of the dumbest things you could do
is the first game of the week bet a bunch

101
00:06:16,521 --> 00:06:18,830
of fucking games.
All right?

102
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,850
And I'm not talking about fantasy shit
and I'm not talking about all the people,

103
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:26,090
the sports gambling,
podcasts that I read a advertising.

104
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:29,270
Then I told you to go out and
do that exact fucking thing.

105
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:33,620
So this would be hypocritical now for
me to tell you this, but I, you know,

106
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:37,160
you don't know who the fuck anybody is
until about two, three fucking weeks in.

107
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:41,150
All right?
I've tried to tell Paul Versey this.

108
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:46,880
Paul Versey is the king of
betting football college or pro.

109
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:48,381
In fact,

110
00:06:48,381 --> 00:06:53,381
when I first became friends with him back
when college football wasn't brilliant

111
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:59,240
enough to realize that they needed to
have some good matchups in the first few

112
00:06:59,241 --> 00:07:03,970
weeks to get people into it, to pull
them away from the NFL. And this,

113
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:08,260
this is what's happening. You know, even
though I haven't looked at the ratings,

114
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:13,630
okay, I'm saying it's happening,
therefore it is happening. Okay.

115
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:19,710
Now these goddamn feminists and me tours
can just say things happen without any

116
00:07:20,111 --> 00:07:24,640
evidence in God. Damn it. I can say
this is happening with no evidence,

117
00:07:24,641 --> 00:07:28,840
no research, no nothing to write
fucking college football is, is,

118
00:07:28,841 --> 00:07:33,010
is getting better ratings right now
than the national football league.

119
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,230
Dare I say a presidential address.

120
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:40,490
Okay. Now, if Netflix doesn't
have to give out ratings,

121
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:45,050
then why should I have to look
at him? That's what I say. Um,

122
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:51,230
anyways, Po Po, uh, this is like
10 fucking years ago, 12 years ago.

123
00:07:51,231 --> 00:07:54,230
And at first knew Paul, this is back
when they had all the cupcake games,

124
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:54,831
you know,

125
00:07:54,831 --> 00:07:58,970
to establish the rankings for whatever
reason they would have like Ohio State

126
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:03,050
Doh play, uh, Eleanor Rigby,
fucking nursing home, right?

127
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,140
Nursing School of nursing or some shit,
right?

128
00:08:06,141 --> 00:08:09,800
And then they would be favored by like
fucking 80 points and fucking Versie

129
00:08:09,801 --> 00:08:14,090
would go out. And just the first
week of football, you know,

130
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:19,220
being a college coach is so much
harder than being a pro professionals,

131
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:22,760
uh, coach. Simply because every,
you know, three, four years,

132
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:25,220
you've got a brand new fucking team.
You're just constantly,

133
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:30,080
every year is a fucking rebuilding year.
And now all these Goddamn millennials,

134
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:34,670
which they're not millennials once again,
1980 to 1995,

135
00:08:34,671 --> 00:08:36,350
there are 23 to 38 years old.

136
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:40,190
I actually just told a 38 year old woman
yesterday that she was a millennial and

137
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:42,140
she couldn't fucking
believe. I say, yes, you are.

138
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:46,780
According to the one website that I went
to and didn't even look at a second one.

139
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,710
Even back it up. You are a
millennial. And she said,

140
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:51,230
I don't identify as millennial.
And I was like,

141
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:55,020
are you angling for your own bathroom?
Um,

142
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:58,001
I don't know yet.

143
00:08:58,001 --> 00:08:59,930
You know I'm doing this right now cause
I don't even know what the fuck's going

144
00:08:59,931 --> 00:09:01,970
on in the world right now.
I just know it's a fucking,

145
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:06,110
everybody is in a Goddamn
hissy fit about everything.

146
00:09:06,111 --> 00:09:09,470
So I just know,
and I know that you don't need evidence,

147
00:09:09,471 --> 00:09:10,730
you don't need fucking anything.

148
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:15,140
People just say things and then it's
not only the person that did the thing,

149
00:09:15,141 --> 00:09:18,020
it's the person that stood next to
the guy that did the fucking thing.

150
00:09:18,021 --> 00:09:22,460
So in the future,
God forbid God for fucking bed,

151
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,570
you're standing on the subway platform
and somebody jumps in front of a train to

152
00:09:26,571 --> 00:09:28,580
commit suicide.
Um,

153
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:32,900
they're going to blame you for assisted
suicide because you stood there and did

154
00:09:32,901 --> 00:09:33,734
nothing.

155
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:43,890
I'm sorry. That's probably a slight
exaggeration. Probably a bad, you know,

156
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:46,260
I probably should've read up
on the story a little more.

157
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:51,420
I probably don't know what I'm talking
about. I probably won't even upload this,

158
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:55,380
but I might. But if you're
listening to it, you know are dead.

159
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:58,020
So Versie would go out
and he fucking would just,

160
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:01,110
just the first week of college football,

161
00:10:01,111 --> 00:10:05,910
you have no idea who the fuck anybody
anybody is. And he would just,

162
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:10,170
he would just do it. It's a lot.
I mean, it's literally a joke.

163
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:14,430
Nebraska given 58 and he'd
fucking bet on the favor. Right?

164
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:18,380
He's doing it again this year.
All right.

165
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:23,990
Last week he fucking bets. Uh, you know,

166
00:10:23,991 --> 00:10:26,090
he's got that fucking homecoming theory,

167
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:30,620
a good road team coming off a loss
playing the next week, add home.

168
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:34,220
He doesn't give a fuck how many
fucking points they're given.

169
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,920
He can't lay off it.

170
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:43,240
So he keeps calling the lions, that
hapless lions, that hapless lines.

171
00:10:43,241 --> 00:10:47,830
It's just like, dude, they,
their first game of the year,
they had a shit one. Okay,

172
00:10:47,831 --> 00:10:49,120
everybody's going to have a shit game.

173
00:10:49,121 --> 00:10:52,540
The fucking patriots just had a
shit game against the Jaguars,

174
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:56,920
but it was week two. So nobody is
saying that that's who they are.

175
00:10:56,921 --> 00:11:00,970
But last year they had a shit game against
Kansas City and all of a sudden the

176
00:11:00,971 --> 00:11:03,940
whole for all the wheels were off.
The Tom Brady era was over.

177
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:08,620
And what ended up happening all Tommy
Brady brought us right back to the fucking

178
00:11:08,621 --> 00:11:13,360
super bowl. He threw for 500 yards
over 500 yards in the game and he lost

179
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,460
was our defense suck
that game, you know? Um,

180
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,193
okay.

181
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:23,910
Because they will, they only held,
nick falls to over 300 yards,

182
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,540
which I guess was a great day.

183
00:11:27,541 --> 00:11:31,110
If the other guy threw for 500 birthday
or the day we don't come out with

184
00:11:31,111 --> 00:11:32,610
victory than money to me.

185
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:34,683
MMM.

186
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:39,370
So last week for his, he's telling
me that the lions, the hapless lines,

187
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:43,210
you take Jimmy g coming home,
San Francisco,

188
00:11:43,211 --> 00:11:47,470
it's a lock and he's texting me, the whole
game is San Francisco is winning. Say,

189
00:11:47,471 --> 00:11:50,500
what did I say? I set it all
week. Exclamation points.

190
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:54,160
He's an absolute euphoria that he said

191
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,230
something that now look
like it was going to happen.

192
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:00,580
And he's looking at Matthew Stafford
like this fucking guy likes to lose every

193
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,620
week. Like, this guy
doesn't have any pride

194
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:06,000
like this man can't get out
there and slam that fucking rock.

195
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:07,790
Okay.

196
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:08,321
The next thing you know,

197
00:12:08,321 --> 00:12:11,950
the fucking lines come back in the end
and they end up covering the spread.

198
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:16,130
No, we've all fucking
been there. All right,

199
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:20,150
so you learn from your past.
Well, if you learn from your past,

200
00:12:20,151 --> 00:12:23,870
you wouldn't keep gambling,
but now you come back for more.

201
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:30,300
What does vars do again this week?
He's teasing the Patriots.

202
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:34,690
They play, I think that they play,
I don't know, somebody playing,

203
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:39,750
he keeps calling them the hapless lions
because they had one bad fucking week.

204
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:44,410
So now the lines are playing. The
Patriots are former fucking, um,

205
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:46,630
coach is coaching the team.

206
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:51,160
He's been when he went and what
meant fucking Patricia? They're like,

207
00:12:51,161 --> 00:12:53,140
that guy doesn't know some
of the shit that we do.

208
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:54,570
Yeah.

209
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:57,570
Okay. Now I'm not saying the Patriots
won't go in and kick the fucking shit up.

210
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:00,660
I don't, I say the pages. Okay. All right.
So I don't know what the fuck I'm safe.

211
00:13:00,661 --> 00:13:01,494
I'm just saying,

212
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:08,470
you just lost betting against his fucking
tape and you're still calling them the

213
00:13:08,471 --> 00:13:10,120
hapless fucking lions.

214
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,850
They were on the road.
They almost beat the fucking 40 niners

215
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,470
they had one bad fucking game.

216
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:20,880
Yeah.

217
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,470
All right. And this brings me back
to the fucking red sox. All right?

218
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:28,120
They sweep the Yankees in the beginning
of August. Did everybody fucking,

219
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,990
all these guys in these
fucking sports shows,

220
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,950
they put their tasseled fucking
loafers up on the desk, you know,

221
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:38,170
fold their fingers on top of their
head and that's fucking over.

222
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:42,080
It's so, it's, it ain't
over. It's not over.

223
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:48,400
It's not fucking over. So my
prediction, the Red Sox, uh, yeah.

224
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:52,170
I just don't think we,
we don't have the fucking one two punch.

225
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:57,390
We don't have a one and two as far as
I'm concerned in our starting rotation

226
00:13:57,391 --> 00:13:58,350
that you need.

227
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:00,813
You know,

228
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:02,940
we just don't have it.

229
00:14:02,941 --> 00:14:06,360
So I think we're going to win a bunch of
fucking games and then we are going to

230
00:14:06,361 --> 00:14:09,210
lose in the playoffs.
I don't want that to happen.

231
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:14,050
I didn't want to say that to you.
I don't want to ruin your fucking day,

232
00:14:14,051 --> 00:14:15,400
but you know,

233
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:16,740
okay.

234
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:21,240
Until a price starts fucking
winning and Yankee Stadium,

235
00:14:21,241 --> 00:14:22,470
I just don't fucking see it.

236
00:14:22,471 --> 00:14:25,590
Unless we're going to play for straight
fucking game or I'll, I'll, you know,

237
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:30,860
only have them start at home.
Oh my God.

238
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:31,551
I love the guy.

239
00:14:31,551 --> 00:14:34,220
He's a fucking amazing picture and
everything and I really needed him to win

240
00:14:34,221 --> 00:14:39,000
last night. I needed it. Okay. I
needed it because, you know, I,

241
00:14:39,001 --> 00:14:43,070
I, you know, I lived through
sports. That's, that's how,
that's what I do. Okay. There.

242
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,300
Okay.
Does that make you feel better?

243
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:49,360
It's not enough that I'm a 50 year
old man alone in a room right now,

244
00:14:49,361 --> 00:14:52,340
talking into a microphone,
hoping that somebody listening,

245
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:56,930
nodding in agreement almost didn't get
through that word. Listening, listening.

246
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:02,990
Um, and we'll have things
you'll want to talk about.

247
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:08,360
I will too.
This is like my own Mr. Rogers show.

248
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:10,123
You know,

249
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:15,170
it's a beautiful day in the neighborhood,
a beautiful day.

250
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:19,790
And the neighbor here comes the
current through the fucking door.

251
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:25,160
He has always wanted to be
right about something in sports,

252
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:29,480
even though it has no effect on his life.

253
00:15:29,481 --> 00:15:32,360
So let's all fucking listen to this shit.

254
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,633
Yeah.

255
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:38,700
Send them some emails and say, dude,
that was it. You figured it out.

256
00:15:38,701 --> 00:15:43,610
Your genius. Go Fuck yourself
yet. Redcurrant sorry. Um,

257
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,730
go fuck yourself. Go Fuck Yourself.
I always have to finish the song.

258
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:49,710
Please go fuck yourself.

259
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:55,380
You freckled count. Um, anyways,

260
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:58,730
uh, I have not been watching
the news and been working.

261
00:15:58,770 --> 00:15:59,820
I'm writing a script right now,

262
00:15:59,821 --> 00:16:03,360
so I haven't been watching anything and
it's fucking hilarious to not watch the

263
00:16:03,361 --> 00:16:05,040
news to not what's no,

264
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:08,460
what's going on because all your friends,

265
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:11,970
it just constantly are just
sending you texts. All caps.

266
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,780
Are you watching this or they call
you up though? Did you see this?

267
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,330
Did you see that Mark Cuban thing?

268
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:20,180
Okay.

269
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:25,170
Did you see what Trump said?
Did you hear about the fucking Albatross?

270
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:27,503
Yeah,

271
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:32,480
the Dj Dj's. Did you see what happened
in Bolivia? It's fucking hell.

272
00:16:32,481 --> 00:16:34,100
It's never anything good.

273
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:40,360
Never. Never anything fucking good. Um,

274
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:45,190
anyways, so I, I don't, I
don't know what's going on.

275
00:16:45,191 --> 00:16:48,200
I did watch the Mark Cuban thing for
like a minute, man. That was fucking,

276
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:50,223
that was brutal.

277
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:55,180
That now that, that right there, that
that's uh, that's one of them brutal once

278
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,870
they ain't no, maybe there's,
they know, maybe that's just

279
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,760
straight up. That's just
fucking Jesus Christ.

280
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,930
I don't know. You know, I got to
tell you here at this podcast,

281
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:11,730
like that's not the way we
run our business here. Now.

282
00:17:11,731 --> 00:17:16,300
The genius of my podcast is there's,
there's nobody else here.

283
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,950
Therefore I can't get in trouble.

284
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:25,120
I don't send emails to myself.

285
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:29,620
At no point will I ever be on the
ESPN of podcasting, sitting there,

286
00:17:29,621 --> 00:17:31,090
shifting,
uncomfortably,

287
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:35,050
trying to answer questions
that I have the answers to.

288
00:17:35,051 --> 00:17:39,100
I just don't want to tell them
to you because I know it's, it's,

289
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:43,600
I did the wrong thing. Um, or maybe,

290
00:17:43,601 --> 00:17:47,440
maybe in the future they'll, they'll
be something like that. You know,

291
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:52,510
I want to see what is a woman
going to be fucking squirming.

292
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:55,060
What about that woman
who fucking date rape?

293
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,890
The 17 year old guy who
fucking was talking all that
shit about Harvey Weinstein

294
00:17:59,891 --> 00:18:03,550
and then she fucking paid the kid
off and then blamed it on a dead guy.

295
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:05,520
Okay.

296
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,050
Where,
why isn't she shifted around?

297
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:11,760
Ask it answer and fucking uncomfortable
fucking questions. You know,

298
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,550
sometimes it's deer season,
sometimes it's elk season.

299
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:17,760
I guess it's still deer
season. I can't wait. When,

300
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:22,170
when is it going to flip up?
When is it going to flip around?

301
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:25,623
MMM.

302
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:30,740
That's why I don't look at this shit.
I saw this woman,

303
00:18:30,741 --> 00:18:33,380
she wrote it in like Twitter.
She's just like, oh, this one guy,

304
00:18:33,381 --> 00:18:37,130
he was able to come out back after
fucking six months. It wasn't six months.

305
00:18:37,131 --> 00:18:41,060
It was close to a year. So they
already fucking shaved off some months.

306
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:45,590
And uh, Monica Lewinsky wasn't able
to come back for 20 years. It's like,

307
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:49,670
what are you talking about? And she
goes, and she did nothing wrong. Well,

308
00:18:49,671 --> 00:18:51,640
I think Hillary would
probably debate that.

309
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,033
MMM.

310
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:58,760
It's like she hosted SNL. She wrote a
fucking book. She had a line of purses.

311
00:18:58,761 --> 00:19:01,790
She had a show. They tried to
get on the air. She not only,

312
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:05,690
she fucking became a cottage
industry off of that thing.

313
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,460
It's like,
what are you talking about?

314
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,633
MMM.

315
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:17,040
Anyways, I dunno, I that's,
it's just like this,

316
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:19,310
this fucking thing that women
are doing that with all,

317
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:22,760
they just keep peeking over the fence
and all this scene is green grass.

318
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:24,813
You know?

319
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:29,320
I, I don't, I just don't fucking,
it's like what are you looking at?

320
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:31,920
That's all you see.
You only see green grass.

321
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:37,450
Yeah.
Engage fucking show up and people just,

322
00:19:37,451 --> 00:19:42,451
Kevin Stop for Guy did something wrong
and nothing happens if a be 30 rock,

323
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:47,650
it sounded like fucking five-year-olds.

324
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,650
I'm not saying there aren't
double standards, everything,

325
00:19:50,651 --> 00:19:53,890
but like why didn't you pick one that's
actually a double standard so you don't

326
00:19:53,891 --> 00:19:57,880
have to fid shit that sends you a whole
thing is just going to fucking collapse

327
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:02,410
or maybe you do research. This woman
actually said she's on her fucking stump.

328
00:20:02,411 --> 00:20:06,910
She's saying after the Monica Lewinsky
thing that Bill Clinton was those then

329
00:20:06,911 --> 00:20:10,360
reelected. It's like he wasn't,
it happened in his second term.

330
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:15,090
Do a little research. I mean,
what? What? What do you mean

331
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,233
[inaudible]

332
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:22,430
and we'll have things
we'll want to yell about.

333
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,310
I will

334
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:29,610
to,
um,

335
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,870
when a woman brushes your teeth,

336
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:38,670
she can feel the whole
toothpastes community judging her.

337
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:43,520
When a guy brushes his
teeth, they're like, oh,

338
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:45,890
we should run the company

339
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:53,380
next time you're in traffic, stop and go
traffic ladies. Just, just look at the,

340
00:20:53,381 --> 00:20:57,100
look on the guy's faces.
Look at the cars they're driving

341
00:20:59,220 --> 00:20:59,221
to.

342
00:20:59,221 --> 00:21:03,510
Any of them look like they're even in
remote control remotely in fucking control

343
00:21:03,511 --> 00:21:08,000
of their lives.
Ladies,

344
00:21:08,001 --> 00:21:10,850
be honest with yourself,
okay.

345
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:15,080
In the average relationship,
boyfriend, girlfriend,

346
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,870
okay.
Married.

347
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:22,430
Whatever life partners the end of the day,

348
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:24,933
okay.

349
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:28,920
If she wants to get brunch
in the guy doesn't, what the,

350
00:21:28,921 --> 00:21:32,880
what do you think you're going to do?
What is the guy's options?

351
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:38,880
Does he have any at the end of the day,
who's really calling the shots?

352
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:47,010
If only one person has life insurance,
okay.

353
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:52,020
If there's only one fucking person
that's going to benefit from the other

354
00:21:52,021 --> 00:21:55,680
person's death on average,
who is that person?

355
00:21:56,830 --> 00:22:00,430
Huh?
Let me come on people.

356
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,900
Happy wife. Happy life. Where's
the cute little rhyme for the guy?

357
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:12,900
There isn't one.
It's cause we don't matter.

358
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:16,613
Yeah.

359
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:22,360
Look how they hate Valentine's Day.
It's all about the woman.

360
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,433
Why?

361
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:29,490
Because they know that every guy is
living the fucking male female dynamic,

362
00:22:30,761 --> 00:22:33,910
which is keep it happy.
Maybe it will fuck me.

363
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:37,930
Keep it happy.
Maybe I can watch the game.

364
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,120
Keep it happy.

365
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:44,160
Maybe I can enjoy 20
minutes of my weekend.

366
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:50,190
That is, that is the world.
Most men are living it.

367
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:55,600
But if you go on the Internet
and you go on social media,

368
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:00,840
most men are blocking a doorway while
jizzing on a plant and running a company

369
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,710
telling you when you're in traffic,
just look, look, it's, I'm telling you,

370
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:10,920
you just look at the side of somebody's
head and you know who the fuck they are.

371
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:15,150
You can see how much hope they have left.
All right?

372
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:16,770
Yeah,

373
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:17,603
I challenge you.

374
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:22,500
Why does that thing doing
that shit now I challenge you.

375
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:26,590
I challenge you to find a lot of hopeful
fucking guys out there. Did you see the,

376
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:28,620
yeah.
Did somebody else tell me that?

377
00:23:28,621 --> 00:23:32,340
And I actually looked it up that fucking
that was that woman out there, uh, in,

378
00:23:32,341 --> 00:23:37,341
in Hawaii telling men did just shut
up and do the right thing for once.

379
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:43,950
It's a fucking, she's hold political
office and it's just talking like that.

380
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:51,850
Just shut up and do the right thing.
All the guys asking for is,

381
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:56,500
is to him to say his side of the
story. She's basically saying, shut up.

382
00:23:56,530 --> 00:24:00,010
Don't listen to the guy side of the story.
As this woman says,

383
00:24:00,011 --> 00:24:02,560
all these things that's going
to destroy this guy's career.

384
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:06,520
I'm not saying what the woman's saying
is true or isn't true, but the guy,

385
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:08,800
he doesn't even have the
right to defend himself.

386
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:13,703
Jay Jay Dang for once.

387
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:18,090
All right. How about we do that when
you push away from the buffet table, Oh,

388
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:20,680
there's a nice low blow for
you and I am proud of doing it.

389
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,020
I'll take the 10 minute misconduct.

390
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:29,710
That's what it's becoming.
It's becoming literally shut the fuck up.

391
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:34,690
All guys shut up and listen to one side
of the fucking story and then that's the

392
00:24:34,691 --> 00:24:38,620
story.
The story is my story.

393
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:42,550
Your story doesn't count
because you have a fucking Dick.

394
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:44,890
That's the world that
we're going into right now.

395
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:49,060
And evidently it's like progressive.
It's fucking insane. It's insane.

396
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:50,630
Yeah.

397
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:53,870
And right now, if one of these
crazy women listen to this,

398
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:58,160
they would completely twist what I just
said and say that I'm actually against

399
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:01,550
women who've been abused,
getting some sort of justice,

400
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:02,690
which is not what I'm saying.

401
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:07,720
I'm just saying that there you have to
listen to both people and then weigh the

402
00:25:08,061 --> 00:25:08,894
evidence.

403
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:10,503
You know,

404
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:14,010
even that is a flawed fucking system,

405
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,290
but it's the best system we have.

406
00:25:17,291 --> 00:25:20,230
And now you're going to take that system
and you're going to throw it out and

407
00:25:20,231 --> 00:25:21,130
now you just,
you know,

408
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,120
it's like Frankenstein movie that
fucking coming up the hill with torches.

409
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:31,680
Um, just shut up. And as you could
tell them a little emotional,

410
00:25:31,681 --> 00:25:34,680
you saw like she had that whole fucking
thing planned out. Like she, you know,

411
00:25:34,681 --> 00:25:36,900
she thought she was got to
get like a bunch of hits,

412
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,630
which I obviously did if I
fucking heard about it. Um,

413
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:46,940
yeah, I dunno. It's literally, it's
like McCarthyism meets a fucking,

414
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:49,520
myspace is what's going on right now.

415
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,050
Um,
yeah.

416
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:52,701
Yeah.

417
00:25:52,701 --> 00:25:57,701
I should show up in everything works
out when we show up to hear your,

418
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,133
okay.

419
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:07,710
Meanwhile, the average guy who's
driving some sort of shitbox to work,

420
00:26:07,711 --> 00:26:08,970
working for somebody else

421
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:13,680
in a job that he never really dreamed of
happening is a kid that's most people's

422
00:26:13,681 --> 00:26:18,300
fucking reality, but not on
social media, social media.

423
00:26:18,301 --> 00:26:22,140
Every guys out there running a company
eating steak and lobster for fucking

424
00:26:22,141 --> 00:26:27,080
lunch, make it as secretary, shower
her tits. Like that's what's happening.

425
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:31,100
That's what all that and every
soul, every guy out there, shut up.

426
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,143
Hm.

427
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:37,570
How dare you try to defend yourself
and everything you worked for. Shut up,

428
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:41,470
do the right thing and shot up.
Um,

429
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:46,620
just a comedian me, I can't lay off this
shit. It's so fucking funny that like,

430
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:51,680
you're literally watching women's reaction
to abuse of power and now they have

431
00:26:52,651 --> 00:26:56,160
power and they instantly start
abusing it. I mean, it's just,

432
00:26:56,161 --> 00:27:00,150
it's just completely going off
the fucking rails here. Um,

433
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:04,530
and most people,
male and female understand that.

434
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:09,560
But all of us are too afraid to tweet or
say fucking anything because then like,

435
00:27:10,171 --> 00:27:12,360
cause then you have to
literally apologize.

436
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:17,460
I watched somebody in my business have
to go on an apology tour for literally

437
00:27:17,461 --> 00:27:22,200
having an opinion. He was an innocent man
who hadn't done anything fucking wrong.

438
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:27,230
He just had an opinion and he had to go
out and apologize for having an opinion.

439
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:30,163
Yeah.

440
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:38,670
And we'll have things you'll
want to talk about. All right.

441
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,650
Felix Gray,
everybody

442
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:47,110
the average American blast their eyes
with bright screens for 11 hours every

443
00:27:47,111 --> 00:27:51,840
day. Oh yeah. There you go.
Live in the dream, right.
Staring at a fucking computer.

444
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:52,770
Um,

445
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:57,030
now you can protect your eyes with a
pair of Felix gray glasses available with

446
00:27:57,031 --> 00:27:58,980
or without a prescription.
I have a pair of these.

447
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:03,150
I have a pair of these fucking things
and I can tell you they are, if you,

448
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:06,750
if you're looking at a computer for a
long fucking time and you don't want your

449
00:28:06,751 --> 00:28:11,490
eyes to be doing that little jumping
around thing, this is the solution.

450
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:16,710
Felix gray glasses filter out
90% of high energy, blue light.

451
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:19,950
And eliminate the glare coming
off all of those screens.

452
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:24,900
That means no more tire, dry
eyes, blurry vision or headaches.

453
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:29,190
Usually it seems like a hassle to have
to protect your eyes and that's why most

454
00:28:29,191 --> 00:28:30,030
of us don't do it.

455
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:34,800
But Felix gray glasses aren't
like those weird computer glasses.

456
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:39,030
Um, you've seen before.
There's no yellow Lens Tint.

457
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:41,490
I don't even know what
the other ones look like.

458
00:28:41,491 --> 00:28:46,440
Felix gray glasses are handcrafted
from premium Italian acetate,

459
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:51,330
Acetate Acetate,
so they won't make you look nerdy.

460
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:55,860
Acetate is the new fucking, I don't
know, raw material, whatever that is.

461
00:28:56,580 --> 00:29:00,300
Is that buried between
limestone shale? Um, in fact,

462
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:04,920
throwing on some fee,
Felix Graze is an easy way to look.

463
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:06,690
Oh, pretty put together. Oh,

464
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:09,600
this stylish is what the Saint Felix
Gray glasses are available in non

465
00:29:09,601 --> 00:29:14,100
prescription prescription and readers
with free shipping and free returns.

466
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:17,490
There's nothing to lose.
Don't go another day.

467
00:29:17,491 --> 00:29:21,690
Looking at screens without the help
of Felix Graze. Go to Felix Gray.

That's Felix Gray,
glasses.com/bar. Hi Felix.

472
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:46,270
Great glasses.com/ [inaudible]
a butcher box stowed.

473
00:29:47,710 --> 00:29:49,420
Fucking get some meat kit.

474
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:55,810
Do you see those two fucking Boston guys
who claim that they have the divisional

475
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:58,420
red socks? Whatever, uh, banner.

476
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,020
I Dunno what's, they either stole that
fucking thing or that things fake.

477
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:08,520
Those things do not just fly off a fucking
stadium. I love how they will like,

478
00:30:08,521 --> 00:30:12,610
you know, then whole thing sounded like
they act like they will, these good guys.

479
00:30:12,611 --> 00:30:16,330
But the whole thing was like a ransom.
Like they had the fucking Lindbergh baby.

480
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:18,580
Hey, if you ever want to
fucking shady thing again.

481
00:30:18,581 --> 00:30:21,040
Now they didn't even ask
for regular season tickets.

482
00:30:21,041 --> 00:30:25,720
They asked for playoff fucking
tickets. Um, all right,

483
00:30:25,721 --> 00:30:30,460
put your box. Do couple of shady
characters, but your box delivers healthy.

484
00:30:30,461 --> 00:30:34,360
100% grass fed,
grass finished beef free range,

485
00:30:34,361 --> 00:30:37,000
organic chicken and
heritage bread, pork. Oh,

486
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:39,250
the greatest fucking fucking
animal you'll ever eat

487
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:44,430
is a blue blood. I don't want to be
fucking racist here against other pigs.

488
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:48,960
I don't want to be in the pigs,
a Ku Klux Klan. And by the way,

489
00:30:48,961 --> 00:30:52,560
it is cool. It's not cool. I always
thought was Klu Klux Klan, Ku Klux Klan.

490
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,900
Um,
I don't want to be like the Grand Dragon.

491
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,920
It starts saying separate but
equal when it comes to pigs.

492
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:05,730
But there really is nothing like
a heritage bread. Pork. All right.

493
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:09,350
And it also,
it did come from Europe,

494
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:13,730
so this is sounding more
fucking pig racist as I go.

495
00:31:13,731 --> 00:31:17,200
But I mean it's unbelievable. If you
haven't been listening to the podcast,

496
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:21,920
the heritage bread, pork, they can dre
sickly trace the bloodline of a pig.

497
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:25,160
There's actually people out
there that do that. Okay.

498
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:26,710
But if a woman

499
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,750
fucking shit on her,
um,

500
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:37,200
they trace the bloodline
of uh,

501
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,620
these God damn pigs,

502
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:42,490
pure bred pigs all the way
back to the original pigs

503
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:47,410
that came across the fucking Atlantic.

504
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,690
I don't know if they came across
with Christopher Columbus.

505
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:57,150
I Dunno if it was with the Nina,
the Pinta in the Santa Maria.

506
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:02,990
It wouldn't surprise me today if some
feminist group actually claimed that a

507
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,460
woman's sailed first

508
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:09,620
and and that nature
and wind in general is,

509
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:13,490
it's much harder for a woman
to sail than for a man.

510
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:15,590
I don't know what happened,

511
00:32:15,591 --> 00:32:20,591
but these fucking pigs came over here
and evidently there was so god damn

512
00:32:21,291 --> 00:32:22,110
delicious,

513
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:26,270
they did not let these pigs breed
with the pigs that were already here.

514
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:31,280
I don't know what. So whatever fucking
reason, these things, these are like,

515
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:36,560
you know, these are pure
bred, these, they're like the,

516
00:32:36,561 --> 00:32:40,280
like the royal family of
Pigs, you know what I mean? So

517
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,060
they have this amazing bloodline, but
also there's a lot of interest breeding,

518
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:48,190
you know,
so that probably a little crazy.

519
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:51,580
But the thing is is when you get the
pork chop, it's dead so it can't get you.

520
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:56,020
So I recommend eating these
pigs do not have them as pets.

521
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,680
Okay.
Back to the copy.

522
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:03,980
The incredible quality of butcher box
meets stats with a commitment to raising

523
00:33:04,321 --> 00:33:09,321
animals humanely and free of antibiotics
and hormones before they murder them.

524
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:14,760
Each box comes with the least
eight to 11 pounds of meat,

525
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:18,030
which is enough for 24
individual size meals.

526
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,460
Unless you're a fat fuck
or a competitive eater,

527
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:25,440
you can choose from five different
box types. All beef, beef and chicken,

528
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:29,670
beef and pork mixed box.
Right?

529
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:33,830
I wonder if they let the
pure bred go in there. Well,

530
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:35,850
you should not be mixing the mate.

531
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:41,870
God made pork and he made me
and they're meant to be shepherd

532
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:50,050
Earl. You Lot the cross. All right.
Custom box lets you choose your own cuts.

533
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,490
Personal experience.

534
00:33:51,491 --> 00:33:56,491
I already told you it's the best God
damn pork chop I ever had ever except for

535
00:33:56,911 --> 00:33:59,910
one restaurant. And that was
like some chef that was on TV,

536
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:02,340
but I made a pork chop
that would actually make,

537
00:34:02,341 --> 00:34:05,430
I would say would make that chef
raised his eyebrow. Like, Hey,

538
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:07,980
that's not even close to what I made,
but I know you're proud of it.

539
00:34:07,981 --> 00:34:12,981
Oh fuck you chef taking my knives and
I'm going home for $20 off your first box

540
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:15,960
in two pounds of free ground
beef and every box for,

541
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:19,480
for the life of your
subscription. Um, okay,

542
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:23,590
that's $20 off your first box and
two pounds of free meat a month.

543
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:25,930
And for that's a lot of fucking meat.

544
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:29,500
And for people who already
are butcher box subscribers,

545
00:34:29,501 --> 00:34:33,490
you'll have a special deal on grumpy if
you can take advantage of by law logging

550
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:47,920
Okay.

551
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,680
There's nobody on the planet like you,

552
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:58,030
your age, 23 to 38. You're a millennial.

553
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:04,240
Why should you just have a
standard bed like generation y,

554
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:09,490
generation x baby boomers,
the greatest generation,

555
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:13,480
the lost generation,
the knickers generation.

556
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:20,350
Um, I said knickers, by the way, as
in pants before I get in trouble.

557
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,410
Sleep everybody.
There's nobody on the planet like you.

558
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:28,880
So why would you buy a generic
mattress built for everyone else?

559
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:34,490
Please mention the talking points
below. Of course I will. He likes sleep.

560
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:39,630
Hellings matches your body to the perfect
mattress so you get the best sleep of

561
00:35:39,631 --> 00:35:43,860
your life. It doesn't matter if you
have back fat, if you have man tits,

562
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:47,440
if you have a crooked nose. Okay. I,

563
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:51,390
I'm guessing they pour you into some
sort of a mold or the boss loved of the

564
00:35:51,391 --> 00:35:52,890
mattress molds to you.

565
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:56,220
It's like the dental impressions
I used to take back in the day,

566
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,410
except it's the mattress version.

567
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:03,450
They've developed nine
different mattresses tailored
to specific body types and

568
00:36:03,451 --> 00:36:04,410
sleep preferences.

569
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:09,480
So evidently there's nobody like you
x till you get to that 10th person,

570
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:18,950
but still pretty cool though. You
know, just go to the Helix sleep,

571
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:24,080
alex.com/bird take their two minutes
sleep quiz and they'll match you to the as

572
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:25,100
fucking hilarious,

573
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:29,510
which ways it hang and buddy and they'll
match you to a mattress that's perfect

574
00:36:29,511 --> 00:36:33,770
for you. Contouring to your body
to provide unprecedented comfort,

575
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:37,310
better sleep. Do you have cankles? Yeah.

576
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:41,230
How would you describe your ass if
it was a balloon? Is it losing air?

577
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:43,240
Does it not happen?

00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:47,650
Um, oh, okay. I read,

593
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,850
I can't read all the right ones. Okay,
there you go. And I want to just tell,

594
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:54,360
I just want to thank all the brave
women out there who are podcasting.

595
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:59,040
I know it's so much more difficult for
you to turn on the power button than it

596
00:37:59,041 --> 00:37:59,910
is for a man.

597
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:04,620
And I'm really looking at myself
right now and I'm reflecting on the,

598
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:08,520
the privilege that I've
enjoyed as a podcast or

599
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:09,410
yeah,

600
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:12,410
simply because of my genitalia.
Um,

601
00:38:12,411 --> 00:38:17,411
today I will go out into the world
knowing that and adjusting my behavior

602
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:20,900
accordingly.
Women,

603
00:38:20,901 --> 00:38:25,190
you have no work to do when it comes to
how you treat men just can just stay the

604
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,830
fucking course and uh,

605
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:32,090
keep telling everybody how difficult
you fucking lives are when there's like,

606
00:38:32,091 --> 00:38:36,070
what, like six holidays a year. That
is specifically people valley. They

607
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:41,110
hype mother's Day versus Father's Day.
You know, there's all kinds of flowers,

608
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:42,490
candy get and show Ya,

609
00:38:45,470 --> 00:38:46,303
right?

610
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:49,770
Father's Day, your dad, he's going
to die first. You know what I mean?

611
00:38:49,771 --> 00:38:53,780
So this should be more of a sense of
urgency when you're thick da no. Yeah.

612
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:56,980
Get him a fucking tie.
What's,

613
00:38:56,981 --> 00:39:01,210
he can fucking hang himself while he's
jerking off in the closet. All right.

614
00:39:01,211 --> 00:39:03,820
That's,
that's the podcast,

615
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,610
ladies and gentlemen.

616
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:08,000
Okay.

617
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,900
Got To make sure I said ladies first,
because they have, it's so much harder.

618
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:14,320
Everything, you know, just, just
them breathing is, you know,

619
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:19,270
air is more difficult on female
lungs. Um, and it's been proven.

620
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:25,030
Um, please enjoy this music and
then we're going to do a little, uh,

621
00:39:25,031 --> 00:39:28,690
what do you call it? They're a little
fucking little throwback to the, uh,

622
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:32,050
to the blow back there to the law.
It's a Thursday afternoon podcast.

623
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:36,100
That'll be an extra half an hour of
greatest hits Thursday afternoon,

624
00:39:36,101 --> 00:39:39,240
just before Monday, just for Friday.
Monday morning podcast. That's what it is.

625
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:40,840
All right.
Have a wonderful weekend.

626
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,190
You cuts and go fuck yourselves
and I'll uh, talk to you on Monday.

627
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:49,210
Wait, he's tried to, you know, I know
it's going to be a tough weekend for you.

628
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:51,990
You know, my weekend's going to
be way easier to just, you know,

629
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:54,040
try to keep the heads trying
to keep your heads up.

630
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:46,890
[inaudible]

631
00:40:46,890 --> 00:40:51,090
right off the bat. This sounds
fucking creepy to me. Video Doorbell.

632
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:52,990
Okay.

633
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:56,120
Uh, we'll insert dinging
sound. What does that mean?

634
00:40:56,121 --> 00:41:00,590
I was supposed to fucking insert ding.
Dongs all right, let's do it again. Uh,

635
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:05,840
I can do this. Here we go. Door bell

636
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:10,930
sound.

637
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:15,580
This is like Donald Trump announcing
he's running for president doorbell sound

638
00:41:15,581 --> 00:41:16,414
effect.

639
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:17,960
Yeah.

640
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,420
Did you meet doorbell? All
one word. Of course I did.

641
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:25,560
Let's see if I can do this correctly.
All right.

642
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:31,720
Hey everybody. Video
Doorbell. Let's do that again.

643
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:34,640
Oh, I'm mad. And all of
layers to the podcast

644
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:39,350
here. Hang on a second. It's got a
fucking, uh, it's gotta reload here.

645
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:44,420
Hey everybody. I'd like to take a
little bit of time to talk about

646
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:49,920
video doorbell. What is very odd.
I was the shit video doorbell.

647
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:54,000
This is the sound of a package
being delivered or friends
coming over for dinner,

648
00:41:54,210 --> 00:41:57,930
but it's also the sound of something.
Plant someone planning to rob you.

649
00:41:57,931 --> 00:42:01,890
Blind Jesus Christ. That
took a left turn, didn't it?

650
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:05,580
Over nine 95% of home break
ins happened during the day.

651
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,760
And I write,
but what is it?

652
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:12,340
What's going on here?
Oh,

653
00:42:12,790 --> 00:42:15,590
I think I'm stuck on one of those youtube
loops where they just keep playing the

654
00:42:15,591 --> 00:42:18,860
fucking the doorbell. Well, I
think it works with the copy.

655
00:42:18,861 --> 00:42:20,540
I'm going to keep it anyways.

656
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:24,620
And burglars always almost always
start by ringing the doorbell to see if

657
00:42:24,621 --> 00:42:26,870
someone's home before
pillaging your possession.

658
00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:32,820
I guess that's a fancier doorbell.
Oh,

659
00:42:32,821 --> 00:42:35,530
I like this music too
with ring video doorbell.

660
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,140
You can see and talk to anyone

661
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:45,760
from anywhere in the world
using your smart phone. Hi,

662
00:42:48,010 --> 00:42:52,600
I'm bill her. What's
happening? Is this a DJ party?

663
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,073
MMM.

664
00:42:56,970 --> 00:43:01,050
Okay. I think we're having
a fire alert here. Okay.

665
00:43:01,051 --> 00:43:02,910
Back to the back to the copy rings.

666
00:43:02,911 --> 00:43:06,210
Advanced motion detection alerts you,

667
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:11,820
even if someone doesn't ring the doorbell,
it's like a caller id for your home.

668
00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:12,811
You know,

669
00:43:12,811 --> 00:43:17,040
millions of people suffer every year
and they don't have a video doorbell.

670
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:22,020
Please share a personal story how this
could help you or someone you love. Hey,

671
00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:25,590
will you share a fucking person
story of cons? Is Isn't enough?

672
00:43:25,591 --> 00:43:30,110
I'm reading your copy. I
don't know anybody who has
a video of fucking doorbell.

673
00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:34,080
How does that work for you as your story?
You'll get another one.

674
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:36,893
I'm sorry.

675
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:43,590
Instilling ring takes minutes and it
works with either your current wiring,

676
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,440
my built in rechargeable battery.

677
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:52,640
Put your mind at ease and protect your
home and your parakeet with the video

678
00:43:53,371 --> 00:43:58,371
doorbell Time magazine named one
of the top 10 gadgets of 2014

679
00:44:00,450 --> 00:44:01,283
Sheridan Kilmore porpoises.

680
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:05,070
Cause eventually you'd have to throw out
the wires and they will end up in the

681
00:44:05,071 --> 00:44:05,401
ocean.

682
00:44:05,401 --> 00:44:10,401
But right now my listeners get the
ring video doorbell for only $174.

683
00:44:12,510 --> 00:44:17,040
That's $25 off the normal price.
Still kind of expensive though.

684
00:44:17,041 --> 00:44:21,960
You know your fucking house comes
with the doorbell or he attached.

685
00:44:22,390 --> 00:44:25,530
He's still making payments. Anyways, go to

686
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:32,510

slash burner

687
00:44:34,621 --> 00:44:37,050
for $25 off.
Once again,

688
00:44:39,630 --> 00:44:40,940
it's ring.com/book

689
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:46,730
oh and he fades up the music.
Jesus Christ. They could be a DJ,

690
00:44:47,230 --> 00:44:50,770
but a fucking mouse had on me and see what
happens. I'll tell you what'll happen,

691
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:54,350
Huh? A bunch of drugs will be taken. Um,

692
00:44:55,430 --> 00:44:57,620
how much can I freak out?
People at one of those raves.

693
00:44:58,490 --> 00:45:00,750
If you just had the DJ and he's clean,
all this mellow shit,

694
00:45:00,751 --> 00:45:04,100
then all of a sudden out of nowhere I
just started coming out on a mouse head

695
00:45:04,101 --> 00:45:08,830
screaming to over and over again. I would
love to have an overhead shot of that,

696
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:11,150
you know,
maybe using one of those drones.

697
00:45:11,230 --> 00:45:14,950
He just watched them all scattered like
fucking roaches all across the desert.

698
00:45:15,310 --> 00:45:17,110
Stepping on sidewinders.

699
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:49,260
[inaudible]. Hey, what's up?

700
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:53,930
The one on it's built, right? It is
the Monday morning podcast from Monday,

701
00:45:53,931 --> 00:45:56,480
September 20th,

702
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:00,590
2010 and I am doing this really late.
I apologize everybody.

703
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:04,730
I had a Baru till day.
I had a brutal Dan.

704
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:08,000
It had nothing to do with my patriots
getting their fucking asses handed to tool

705
00:46:08,010 --> 00:46:10,790
by the Goddamn jets.
Congratulations.

706
00:46:10,791 --> 00:46:15,230
All you green concept there in the
metal lands. Stick your chest out.

707
00:46:15,231 --> 00:46:18,950
I'm sure you happy. I'm
sure you're proud. You know,

708
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:23,840
you know what sucks about it is the
jets game the week before the one that I

709
00:46:23,841 --> 00:46:28,841
predicted that I was fucking dead on
right about that the ravens were gonna win

710
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:31,520
happened on a Monday night.

711
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:36,750
I had already recorded my podcast so I
didn't get to talk Shit and pat myself on

712
00:46:37,731 --> 00:46:38,930
the fucking back about it.

713
00:46:38,931 --> 00:46:43,931
By the time I did the jets bounce back
and kick the shit out of the Patriots and

714
00:46:44,601 --> 00:46:46,130
a,
I will say this about it.

715
00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:50,300
I actually recorded a podcast yesterday
before the jets game cause I wanted to

716
00:46:50,301 --> 00:46:54,980
talk shit about it and give my prediction.
But um,

717
00:46:56,030 --> 00:46:59,510
I actually ended up being
dead on in my own way,

718
00:46:59,511 --> 00:47:01,580
but I didn't think anybody was
really going to believe it.

719
00:47:01,581 --> 00:47:04,240
But then if some of them are
reminded me that I actually did call,

720
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:09,260
I said take the jets in the points.
I did a thing on versus network, uh,

721
00:47:09,261 --> 00:47:13,790
this past week and I trashed the
jets as I always do because uh,

722
00:47:13,791 --> 00:47:17,150
I'm from Boston and I fucking hate the
New York teams. I respect your city.

723
00:47:17,510 --> 00:47:19,370
It's lovely,
especially in the fall,

724
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:22,370
walking through central park with the
leaves crunching under your shoes.

725
00:47:22,550 --> 00:47:27,500
Who doesn't like to do that?
Wonderful, wonderful museums. You know,

726
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:30,370
a rare good slice of pizza.

727
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:35,320
I will tell you that only because New
Yorkers known for its pizza that are so

728
00:47:35,321 --> 00:47:40,321
many fucking assholes who can't make
pizza have sprung up and they all say that

729
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:44,870
they're famous. I've said this shit
before just out of you know, any,

730
00:47:44,950 --> 00:47:46,900
you New Yorkers want to tell
the tourists where to go.

731
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:50,500
Cause I got into a huge argument about
some fucking brought Eaton cunt from

732
00:47:50,501 --> 00:47:53,260
Chicago who said New York pizza sucks.

733
00:47:53,530 --> 00:47:56,100
I mean granted he enjoys their Lasagna,

734
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,600
whatever the fuck they called their pizza
out there. And if you're from Chicago,

735
00:48:01,601 --> 00:48:05,080
tell me where to get the good deep dish.
Because the shit I get out there,

736
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:09,100
it's like even if you get
the personal size one,

737
00:48:09,101 --> 00:48:13,600
it's like you feel like you ate a
birthday cake made out of spaghetti sauce,

738
00:48:13,601 --> 00:48:15,520
but by the time you're done with it,

739
00:48:15,970 --> 00:48:20,410
it's that level of full where you want
to kill yourself and it doesn't really

740
00:48:20,411 --> 00:48:21,430
taste that good.

741
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:25,570
But I know there's no way that
there's not a great spot in Chicago.

742
00:48:25,571 --> 00:48:30,520
So Chicago and New York have your pizza
war. Tell me where to go. But anyways,

743
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:35,860
um, this is what I felt about
the game was basically my heart.

744
00:48:35,861 --> 00:48:37,090
I have to go with the Patriots,

745
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:41,940
but I just had that bad failing cause I
have this theory on divisional rivalries

746
00:48:42,070 --> 00:48:44,450
is that they never go
the way they go back.

747
00:48:44,451 --> 00:48:48,460
I remember the name of the God damn
show was on, on the versus networks.

748
00:48:48,461 --> 00:48:51,760
That's really bad too because I had a
great time and they were like, yeah,

749
00:48:51,761 --> 00:48:54,730
come back any time I can't remember the
name of the fucking show cause that's

750
00:48:54,731 --> 00:48:55,660
how I operate.

751
00:48:56,320 --> 00:49:01,320
I go in there totally in just
go in and fucking kill mode.

752
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:04,810
That sold to the point
that I don't even fucking,

753
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:07,360
I remembered the channel
that's new for me.

754
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:11,650
I just did a fuck load of media and had
something add something me the line in

755
00:49:11,651 --> 00:49:15,940
it. I can't remember what
the Forza Nightline and, no,

756
00:49:15,941 --> 00:49:20,880
it wasn't that. But uh, I was actually
right two fucking weeks in a row.

757
00:49:20,910 --> 00:49:25,390
That's what's killing me now. This is
nobi breakdown the game. This is what, uh,

758
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:28,480
this is what I didn't like was the,
uh,

759
00:49:28,481 --> 00:49:32,290
the Patriots' defense took a big step
backwards and they look like the hapless

760
00:49:32,291 --> 00:49:33,820
crew from last fucking year.

761
00:49:34,090 --> 00:49:39,090
But I'm also smart enough to realize
that week two does not define a fucking

762
00:49:39,251 --> 00:49:44,080
season. But, uh, I gotta be honest.
Uh, and I was liking Hernandez.

763
00:49:44,081 --> 00:49:44,950
That guy look great.

764
00:49:45,610 --> 00:49:49,090
And I think Tom Brady was being
really generous when he said, Dad, uh,

765
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:51,370
we couldn't do anything right in
the second half. It's like, dude,

766
00:49:51,371 --> 00:49:54,670
how about after the first quarter?
I mean,

767
00:49:54,671 --> 00:49:57,370
I guess we went down and we
went up 14 fucking seven,

768
00:49:57,371 --> 00:50:00,730
but then they march right back
down the field. But anyways,

769
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:04,360
hopefully I am,

770
00:50:04,361 --> 00:50:07,810
I am converting some people to
my way of looking at sports,

771
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:12,190
which is last week doesn't mean shit.

772
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:15,970
I mean, you gotta, you gotta like
do like whatever the jets did,

773
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:20,590
either being anemic or kicking
the shit out of somebody.

774
00:50:20,591 --> 00:50:24,520
You gotta do it like three, four weeks
in a row before you can get excited,

775
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:25,983
you know?

776
00:50:26,410 --> 00:50:30,290
But I mean you just watched these analysts
on TV and it's like whatever somebody

777
00:50:30,291 --> 00:50:33,880
just did is who the fuck they are.
And uh,

778
00:50:34,130 --> 00:50:35,780
did I say it last week on the podcast,

779
00:50:35,781 --> 00:50:37,670
how the paths that led
up three to 50 yards,

780
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:42,200
150 fucking yards to osho say
I didn't like those numbers.

781
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:44,420
I did not like those numbers.
I still,

782
00:50:44,930 --> 00:50:48,740
I thought it was going to be one
of those cunty 19 to 17 games.

783
00:50:48,741 --> 00:50:52,850
And I thought in the end I was praying
that we were going to come out and get a

784
00:50:52,851 --> 00:50:56,090
victory, but I did not, I did not
think that we were going to get,

785
00:50:56,690 --> 00:51:00,140
we were going to get pounded and we got,

786
00:51:00,170 --> 00:51:03,020
we got pounded in a very light way.

787
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:06,830
I don't remember any sort of big hit
other than the big hit in the end for the

788
00:51:06,831 --> 00:51:09,140
fumble.
But it was just sort of,

789
00:51:09,141 --> 00:51:12,920
I just felt like we were in a prevent
defense from the second quarter on,

790
00:51:14,410 --> 00:51:18,830
you know, ah, just, you know, you
deal with that zone, let people go.

791
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:20,870
And I have to admit that fucking

792
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:26,870
Reavis guy really pissed me off when
he got burned for a touchdown and then

793
00:51:26,871 --> 00:51:30,020
grabs his Hami.
Can I do that from now on?

794
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:34,850
When I fuck up in life and I'm sitting
there talking all kinds of shit and I'm

795
00:51:34,970 --> 00:51:36,890
killing for 20 minutes with jokes.

796
00:51:37,070 --> 00:51:40,310
And then I tell one that
bombs and then I just,

797
00:51:40,311 --> 00:51:42,890
I started grabbing my hamstring
and I fucking, you know,

798
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:44,960
lay down and have somebody stretch it out.

799
00:51:45,590 --> 00:51:49,730
That was a really fucking bitch move.
And I don't buy it.

800
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:52,100
I don't buy the whole goddamn story.

801
00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:55,130
I don't like how before
the game even started,

802
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:59,750
reverse already had a fucking excuse. I
think he was scared from the week before.

803
00:51:59,990 --> 00:52:01,760
Not that he's bad,
the guys to ship,

804
00:52:01,761 --> 00:52:06,761
but I think he was out of shape and he
was worried that a Randy Moss was gonna

805
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:10,790
run all over his island.
That's so fucking gave Reavis island,

806
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:14,840
you know,
who would ever go there,

807
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:18,500
but you're fucking guys
standing around squatting down

808
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:24,050
and that quarterback fucking position,
you know,

809
00:52:25,670 --> 00:52:28,790
I don't know. Speaking
of that. Speaking of gay,

810
00:52:29,030 --> 00:52:33,650
here's an email I got recently from
a gay guy. Uh, believe it or not,

811
00:52:34,310 --> 00:52:37,040
I have,
I have all kinds of fans on this.

812
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:41,240
You wouldn't know this from some of
those fucking assholes up in Seattle who

813
00:52:41,241 --> 00:52:44,720
branded me a homophobe because they
listened to the first half of the,

814
00:52:44,910 --> 00:52:47,640
what are you a fig bit in?

815
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:51,830
Stomped off like the fucking
pansies that they were.

816
00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:56,330
Here's a guy right here now.
All right. Said Bill, watch,

817
00:52:56,331 --> 00:53:01,310
let it go last night. Uh, and it
was fantastic. Congratulations.

818
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:05,480
Uh, that's hilarious. Um, no, you know
what's hilarious was I was thinking,

819
00:53:05,481 --> 00:53:09,500
let it go as my last special
and I fly to held it in my head.

820
00:53:09,501 --> 00:53:13,370
I immediately pictured my, uh, why
do I do this anyway? So I'm an idiot.

821
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:17,330
Let me start over. Watch, let it go last
night. It was fantastic. Congratulations.

822
00:53:17,630 --> 00:53:20,210
It was kind of cool to hear some of
the things you had talked about on the

823
00:53:20,211 --> 00:53:22,640
podcast turned into developed bits.

824
00:53:22,850 --> 00:53:26,790
I was wondering if you brought stuff from
the stage to the podcast or is it vice

825
00:53:26,791 --> 00:53:29,070
versa?
Do you use the podcast to develop bits?

826
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:32,510
I was also wondering how much input,
uh,

827
00:53:32,550 --> 00:53:37,380
you are other comics have on editing
on the editing of your specials.

828
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:42,510
I've noticed that your recent special is
lit differently. Better in my opinion,

829
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:44,820
than many comedy central specials.

830
00:53:44,821 --> 00:53:48,990
The audience is dark in there is a nice
spotlight on you instead of the whole

831
00:53:48,991 --> 00:53:52,230
stage being lit. How did
you get that deal? Also,

832
00:53:52,231 --> 00:53:55,530
the commercial breaks seem
to come at strange places.

833
00:53:56,010 --> 00:54:00,180
Did you get to decide where they went?
Sorry for all the questions.

834
00:54:00,181 --> 00:54:02,940
Bottom line is the special.
It was amazing.

835
00:54:03,210 --> 00:54:07,530
The podcast is great and I'm a huge fan.
Well, thank you very much that he said,

836
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:10,590
ps, she looked great and
better and better as you age.

837
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:15,450
Does that seem gay for one man to say to
another? Well guess what bill? I am gay.

838
00:54:15,451 --> 00:54:20,430
Deal with it. Ah, that's
fucking awesome. All right,

839
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:24,990
great questions. They're
twinkle toes. All right.

840
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:28,800
What do we got here? The first one
he asked, he said a watch, let it go.

841
00:54:28,801 --> 00:54:30,660
Less than it was for to Dah, Dah, Dah. Oh,

842
00:54:30,890 --> 00:54:35,890
you're wondering if do I take stuff from
the podcast and take it to the stage

843
00:54:36,271 --> 00:54:38,850
and vice versa? Ah, there's
a little bit of both,

844
00:54:38,851 --> 00:54:42,210
but definitely more podcasts to the stage.

845
00:54:42,211 --> 00:54:47,211
I try not to burn bits on the podcast
where it's like if I actually did a bit

846
00:54:49,021 --> 00:54:53,160
from my act, then you come and see me.
It's already kind of a finish thing,

847
00:54:53,161 --> 00:54:54,990
then I would feel like
I was fucking you over.

848
00:54:55,170 --> 00:55:00,170
But there's definitely times when I riff
on stuff that a little light goes off

849
00:55:00,391 --> 00:55:03,030
on my head and I'm like, you
know what? That's really funny.

850
00:55:03,510 --> 00:55:06,390
And I think that I could take
that somewhere. But even then,

851
00:55:06,391 --> 00:55:09,300
even if you heard it
on the podcast, it, it,

852
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:12,840
I don't say it the way I set it
on the podcast, it like continues,

853
00:55:13,470 --> 00:55:14,303
you know what I mean?

854
00:55:15,310 --> 00:55:20,310
Kind of like when Stevie Ray Vaughn did
his cover of a say what Jimmy Hendricks,

855
00:55:20,581 --> 00:55:24,330
which was, wasn't that like
two things spliced it together.

856
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:28,860
I can't remember. Was that rainy
day? I can't remember. He did.

857
00:55:28,861 --> 00:55:32,280
He did a cover up and he just
sort of took the beginning riff.

858
00:55:33,690 --> 00:55:35,580
That's right. Yeah. He took the beginning,

859
00:55:35,581 --> 00:55:40,050
refer that and then he just sort of
fleshed out the middle and edit his whole

860
00:55:40,051 --> 00:55:42,390
type of shit to it.
So I tried to do that with like,

861
00:55:42,391 --> 00:55:45,420
did I just bring up Stevie Ray Vaughn
and Jimmy Hendricks? I'm sorry. Sorry.

862
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:48,810
My fucking Egos really pumped up with
all the great emails you guys sent me

863
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:54,090
about my special last night. But
yes, to answer your question, um,

864
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:57,270
occasionally shit like
that does go to the stage,

865
00:55:57,271 --> 00:55:59,670
but I'm really sensitive about
that because I don't like people,

866
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:02,640
I wouldn't want someone to come
to me and be like, dude, it was,

867
00:56:02,641 --> 00:56:05,490
it was everything you said
on the podcast. I, you know,

868
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:08,700
I don't mind if somebody
comes up and says, yeah,

869
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:12,510
that was something I heard in the podcast
and then you took it in this other

870
00:56:12,511 --> 00:56:15,660
area. Like, listen, I'm just
fucking meandering right now.

871
00:56:15,661 --> 00:56:17,130
You can't do that on understand upstairs.

872
00:56:17,131 --> 00:56:21,620
People will be throwing like
fucking potato skins at me. So, um,

873
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:25,780
that's the deal. And if ever do an old
bit from my act, I actually just say it.

874
00:56:25,781 --> 00:56:30,010
This is a bit I used to do and I usually
do an abridged version. So there we go.

875
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:34,960
All right, next one. Ah, I was also
wondering how much input you had, uh,

876
00:56:35,950 --> 00:56:37,960
on the editing of your specials.
Um,

877
00:56:37,990 --> 00:56:42,990
that's a huge thing that I have input on
and from why do I do this and let it go

878
00:56:43,810 --> 00:56:48,810
is there is a specific look that I want
and as specific vibe that I am looking

879
00:56:51,730 --> 00:56:52,630
for and that,

880
00:56:52,631 --> 00:56:57,631
and it's very important to me and I
think it's even more important than the

881
00:56:58,151 --> 00:57:00,040
fucking material if you can believe it.

882
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:05,040
Just because I have seen some unbelievable
comedians with shitty production and

883
00:57:08,230 --> 00:57:12,310
it knocks down the level
of your performance.

884
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:15,430
And that sucks because
it's not your fault.

885
00:57:15,431 --> 00:57:19,090
So you really have to like,

886
00:57:19,091 --> 00:57:23,140
I've learned that just through like
the few TV movie things that I've done,

887
00:57:23,170 --> 00:57:27,910
like as far as editing, lighting,
all those fucking guys, the sound,

888
00:57:28,030 --> 00:57:30,730
all of those guys,
director, all of those guys.

889
00:57:31,270 --> 00:57:35,200
It's like they can take a mediocre
performance and make it look fucking

890
00:57:35,201 --> 00:57:37,200
unbelievable and they can take an,

891
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:41,770
an amazing performance and make it look
like cannonball run part two if they

892
00:57:41,771 --> 00:57:45,730
don't know what the fuck they're
doing. So, uh, so there you go.

893
00:57:46,090 --> 00:57:51,090
There's my big shoutout to
art and industry who's done
my last two specials and

894
00:57:51,340 --> 00:57:55,510
we'll continue doing my specials
cause they do a great fucking job. Uh,

895
00:57:55,511 --> 00:58:00,511
I basically tell them exactly what I'm
looking for and I always come at him with

896
00:58:00,821 --> 00:58:04,540
shit that has nothing to do with comedy.
They'll just be like,

897
00:58:04,541 --> 00:58:05,980
what do you want it to look like?
I'm like,

898
00:58:05,981 --> 00:58:10,570
you ever see the magnificent seven when
they're fucking sitting there eating

899
00:58:10,571 --> 00:58:15,070
those Rancharrah Huevos whatever
the fuck you saying. Um,

900
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:19,930
I come at him like that.
Um, so there you go. Great.

901
00:58:19,931 --> 00:58:24,580
Kept great question right out of
the Goddamn Gate. Um, but anyways,

902
00:58:24,581 --> 00:58:28,990
let's continue on. Uh, talking
a little football here.

903
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:33,040
Um, how about those fucking bears? Huh?

904
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:37,300
I didn't know that Mike Martz is,
uh,

905
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:39,640
is their offensive coordinator.

906
00:58:39,670 --> 00:58:43,930
They all of a sudden overnight got
a little scary. And like I said,

907
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:46,390
I'm not judging them on two weeks.

908
00:58:46,391 --> 00:58:49,330
I mean they've basically lost to the
fucking lines and then we're given that

909
00:58:49,331 --> 00:58:54,010
victory. My apology to lions fans
last week cause I was going like,

910
00:58:54,011 --> 00:58:55,540
look at you guys,
you're playing competitive.

911
00:58:55,541 --> 00:58:59,410
I had not seen the highlight of how
you got fucked out of that game. Um,

912
00:59:00,730 --> 00:59:05,680
but like that is a devastating combination
cause Mike Martz is PR is like right

913
00:59:05,681 --> 00:59:09,280
in his fucking wheel wheel house.
You know what I mean?

914
00:59:10,690 --> 00:59:14,590
It's like how Deniro was doing comedy
and meet the parents and all that shit.

915
00:59:14,890 --> 00:59:19,030
But all of a sudden if, if they go back
to doing the good fellas shit, he's right.

916
00:59:19,060 --> 00:59:21,890
He's debts.
He's fucking in it.

917
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:22,933
So

918
00:59:23,780 --> 00:59:24,390
yeah,

919
00:59:24,390 --> 00:59:26,760
I dunno man. That's, that's,
that's the big thing.

920
00:59:27,460 --> 00:59:30,450
You got to have all the fucking pieces.
You could have the ownership,

921
00:59:30,451 --> 00:59:33,090
you have to have the coaches and
you have to have the players.

922
00:59:33,270 --> 00:59:36,600
It's like what that fucking Matt Cassel.
I remember Bob,

923
00:59:36,601 --> 00:59:40,260
my buddy of mine was giving me Shit when
we traded him for a first round fucking

924
00:59:40,261 --> 00:59:43,710
draft pick or whatever, the chiefs, he
was like, dude, I mean the guy look it up.

925
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:46,210
He went 11 and five and then all of this

926
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:47,070
fucking pieces,

927
00:59:47,070 --> 00:59:51,330
all those people who are trying to give
Brady Shit because Brady was hurt yet

928
00:59:51,331 --> 00:59:56,331
the patriots when 11 and five typical
fantasy football fucking morons,

929
00:59:58,110 --> 01:00:02,220
they don't realize that Mac castle
was driving a Lamborghini that year.

930
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:06,430
He was driving a team throughout the
regular season that went 16 and oh when

931
01:00:06,431 --> 01:00:08,240
every fucking game and what did he,

932
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:13,400
he managed the fucking game and
gave us five less fucking victories,

933
01:00:13,770 --> 01:00:18,470
but then people's heads, they're like
11 and five man, that's fucking nuts.

934
01:00:18,471 --> 01:00:22,400
If he goes to Kansas City
and does what it does, what

935
01:00:24,210 --> 01:00:29,210
drives that fucking 1972 eco liner that
is the Kansas City chiefs now all of a

936
01:00:31,561 --> 01:00:34,290
sudden, right? You
fucking need a fuel pump.

937
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:36,930
The time and belt snaps and right there.

938
01:00:36,931 --> 01:00:39,570
Matt Cassel looks like he should be
holding a fucking clipboard again.

939
01:00:39,810 --> 01:00:43,500
Is it his fault? I don't fucking think
so. But you got to have everybody.

940
01:00:44,010 --> 01:00:48,490
So that's my point. Dot. The
fucking Chicago bears haven't.

941
01:00:49,710 --> 01:00:49,850
Yeah.

942
01:00:49,850 --> 01:00:53,780
What's his face, Mike? March. Whenever
the hell his God damn name is.

943
01:00:53,781 --> 01:00:54,920
I can't even think at this point.

944
01:00:54,940 --> 01:00:59,150
I'm so sick of fucking talking
after a week of press last week. Um,

945
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:00,380
yeah,

946
01:01:00,380 --> 01:01:04,070
having those two guys is huge,
is fucking huge.

947
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:07,550
And all of a sudden Jay Cutler looks like
a good Goddamn quarterback, doesn't he?

948
01:01:08,090 --> 01:01:08,923
Doesn't he?

949
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:13,210
So with that, how about some
predictions? I gotta Talk Shit early.

950
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:17,860
Pets are playing again next Sunday.
Which Patriot team is going to show up,

951
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:21,760
you know,
according to in your my stats,

952
01:01:21,761 --> 01:01:24,820
the exact same fucking defense
showed up both fucking weeks.

953
01:01:26,130 --> 01:01:29,200
God dammit.
Our defense stinks.

954
01:01:30,220 --> 01:01:33,110
We're not going to win shit without,
you know, something that's actually a

955
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:35,900
great, uh, I think it,

956
01:01:36,620 --> 01:01:39,870
cause I never felt like the patriots
players ever got their fucking do when we

957
01:01:39,950 --> 01:01:43,250
are winning those champions. Yet there
were a mediocre team with no superstars.

958
01:01:43,430 --> 01:01:44,870
Now all of a sudden I don't,

959
01:01:44,871 --> 01:01:48,530
you look at Teddy Bruschi in verbal and
all those guys in a different light.

960
01:01:50,390 --> 01:01:53,660
Maybe you don't, I don't fucking know.
What do we got? Let me talk one thing.

961
01:01:53,690 --> 01:01:58,220
New Orleans at San Francisco,
there's another divisional rivalry game.

962
01:01:58,221 --> 01:02:01,130
I don't like it. Everybody say New
Orleans is going to run all over them.

963
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:02,473
I don't like it.

964
01:02:03,410 --> 01:02:06,800
I think it's going to be closer than
that just because they were in the same

965
01:02:06,801 --> 01:02:09,940
fucking division. Those games
are always conti. All right.

966
01:02:11,650 --> 01:02:16,380
Week three buffalo at New England.
Yeah.

967
01:02:18,190 --> 01:02:20,370
Joe G H I want to,
we're going to bounce back,

968
01:02:20,370 --> 01:02:23,400
but I mean I don't find them
fucking know what that difference.

969
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:29,640
You know what it is about the pets.
We have no pass rush. All right.

970
01:02:29,641 --> 01:02:33,870
Jet Fans before you get all excited about
Sanchez sitting back in a fucking lazy

971
01:02:33,871 --> 01:02:36,960
boy in the pocket. That son of a bitch
can scramble though. I will give you that.

972
01:02:36,961 --> 01:02:41,940
But who do the jet have next week?
Who Do they get? Who they get?

973
01:02:42,030 --> 01:02:46,980
Are you guys talking shit
again? Oh, jetset Miami.
Miami's going to beat Ya, man.

974
01:02:46,981 --> 01:02:51,450
He's got a fucking insane defense. You're
going to go on the road. All right.

975
01:02:52,050 --> 01:02:55,250
I think. What's his face? Rex? Ryan's
going to poke his head out of the shelf.

976
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:57,960
He's going to start talking shit.
It's going to look at,

977
01:02:57,961 --> 01:03:01,840
get a little drunk and get sunburned.
Fall Asleep on the fucking beach is

978
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:06,510
he's going to be miserable down
there. I have no idea. I have no idea.

979
01:03:06,511 --> 01:03:07,680
But I'm telling you right now,

980
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:11,900
they are fucking jet fans before your
hoist a fireman up on your shoulder like

981
01:03:11,990 --> 01:03:16,080
you're doing the village people
fucking act. Uh, don't sleep on Miami.

982
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:19,200
You don't like about Miami.

983
01:03:19,380 --> 01:03:22,620
Their coach looks like he's in the
fucking witness protection program.

984
01:03:23,790 --> 01:03:26,990
The fuck is with that guy.
I watched that game and,

985
01:03:26,991 --> 01:03:29,220
and they kept cutting to
him on the sidelines on,

986
01:03:29,221 --> 01:03:31,020
I have no fucking idea what he looks like.

987
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:36,200
He's got a baseball hat yanked down to
his huge fucking Tony Curtis sunglasses.

988
01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:41,550
He's got that big, uh, who's
that guy from the big Lebowski?

989
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:45,840
Ah, does the narration, whatever the guy
from mass, he's got one of those fucking,

990
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:49,500
I own a Harley musty.
I have no fucking idea what he looks like.

991
01:03:49,530 --> 01:03:53,490
And then Green Bay. It's Chicago. That's
a great Monday night game. All right, Jay,

992
01:03:53,491 --> 01:03:56,340
I have to get back to the podcast here
because I know a lot of people are,

993
01:03:56,660 --> 01:04:01,170
are uh, not sports fans. So
let me tell you about my week.

994
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:05,790
Everybody, um, leading
up to my specialist,

995
01:04:05,870 --> 01:04:10,050
I went to New York City and I did the
opiod Anthony Program. Wonderful Program.

996
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:15,130
If for some reason you live in a cave
and you've never heard of it, it's a,

997
01:04:15,131 --> 01:04:20,040
a sort of a political show. Um, a lot
of topics are discussed. I'm actually,

998
01:04:20,340 --> 01:04:22,690
obviously I'm fucking around over
the top and I got to tell you,

999
01:04:22,740 --> 01:04:27,740
Jim Norton had the funniest God damn joke
that I don't even think got the laugh

1000
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:30,600
it deserved.
It was so funny.

1001
01:04:30,601 --> 01:04:34,830
It actually made me a better person and
I'm going to tell you why I was fucking

1002
01:04:36,610 --> 01:04:41,610
opiate mentioned he was trying to sign
something and he said that they wouldn't

1003
01:04:41,941 --> 01:04:43,980
let him sign it with like a pen to paper.

1004
01:04:43,980 --> 01:04:47,370
He had to do this virtual signing
or whatever. That's computer thing.

1005
01:04:47,580 --> 01:04:52,580
So me being the shed head
than I am immediately jump
into a connecting the dots

1006
01:04:53,550 --> 01:04:58,350
that this is this big conspiracy that
they want to have this computer. Um,

1007
01:04:59,580 --> 01:05:02,970
I dunno. Something like, I
don't know. I can't see, I'm
so stupid. I can't even see,

1008
01:05:02,971 --> 01:05:06,270
I can't even say how the fuck am I
trying to say here. They basically,

1009
01:05:06,271 --> 01:05:06,990
then they have [inaudible],

1010
01:05:06,990 --> 01:05:09,930
they have you basically your
signature like on a stamp,

1011
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:13,440
but it's in like computer form and
they go and that's for the Illuminati.

1012
01:05:13,830 --> 01:05:17,040
And then later on five years,
if you don't like what they're doing,

1013
01:05:17,140 --> 01:05:18,250
just take out the Amaa

1014
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:22,060
Nazi document and it just puts your
computer signature right underneath it.

1015
01:05:22,510 --> 01:05:24,820
That's what they're going to do.
And then Jim just goes,

1016
01:05:25,090 --> 01:05:27,520
or the Illuminati could
just forge your signature.

1017
01:05:31,830 --> 01:05:36,460
Uh, I butchered it was fucking great.
And it really just made me feel like,

1018
01:05:36,461 --> 01:05:39,340
exactly bill. Exactly. You know,

1019
01:05:39,370 --> 01:05:42,580
why don't you just fucking relax
if they're really that powerful,

1020
01:05:42,581 --> 01:05:46,630
do they really need to create
schemes to that fucking level?

1021
01:05:47,050 --> 01:05:48,560
And a, I have to tell you, I,

1022
01:05:48,561 --> 01:05:53,561
I must've thought about that
line maybe 50 fucking times.

1023
01:05:55,390 --> 01:05:58,870
I've just been walking around thinking
my crazy thoughts and then that joke,

1024
01:05:58,930 --> 01:06:01,420
his voice keeps popping in my head going,
oh,

1025
01:06:01,421 --> 01:06:03,280
the Illuminati could
just forge a signature.

1026
01:06:03,281 --> 01:06:05,770
And it just makes me laugh at what a
fucking ridiculous human, yeah. Human

1027
01:06:05,790 --> 01:06:10,180
being. I am. Um, so there you go.
Shout out to Jimmy Norton now. Um,

1028
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:15,670
but anyways, so this is my week. So I
did the opening of the program. I did a,

1029
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:17,080
I did the versus network.

1030
01:06:17,930 --> 01:06:21,430
Had a great time on that and hopefully
we'll be doing more shit on that.

1031
01:06:21,431 --> 01:06:26,431
I also did a Nesson where I talked
to all kinds of shit about the jets.

1032
01:06:27,940 --> 01:06:32,170
I had fun on that one because that
was just in Boston. So I was able to,

1033
01:06:32,410 --> 01:06:37,410
I didn't have to bleep be diplomatic
on that one and a what others did.

1034
01:06:38,531 --> 01:06:41,560
Pete Dominick show,
I did a Jim Breuer show.

1035
01:06:41,590 --> 01:06:45,610
All those guys just want to thank say
thank you to everybody who let me run my

1036
01:06:45,611 --> 01:06:47,890
mouth and a height,

1037
01:06:47,891 --> 01:06:51,800
my special and thanks everybody
who watched it and uh,

1038
01:06:51,850 --> 01:06:54,940
sent me all the great emails and
everything. And uh, and with that,

1039
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:59,920
if you'd like to buy it, go to amazon.com
you can actually, the presale I think,

1040
01:06:59,921 --> 01:07:03,850
is it still a presale price?
I Dunno, it was like 13, 26.

1041
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:08,770
Uh, if you want to buy it for that cheap
amount and then bring it to one of my

1042
01:07:08,771 --> 01:07:12,190
shows, I'll fucking sign it
for you. I don't give a shit.
Just go ahead and buy it.

1043
01:07:12,191 --> 01:07:16,930
And I would really appreciate it if you
guys would go out and buy it because

1044
01:07:16,931 --> 01:07:17,860
believe it or not,

1045
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:22,840
it really does help me as a
performer if you do things like that.

1046
01:07:22,841 --> 01:07:23,350
And uh,

1047
01:07:23,350 --> 01:07:28,060
one of the things I've noticed
being a huge music fan is I go on,

1048
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:33,460
um, I go on youtube and I'm
always watching, uh, you know,

1049
01:07:33,461 --> 01:07:35,920
like clips of bands and shit like that.

1050
01:07:35,980 --> 01:07:40,840
And one of the things that people keep
asking is they say where resolved the

1051
01:07:40,841 --> 01:07:45,400
talent. You know what I mean? Like where
are the Beatles were the stones where,

1052
01:07:45,401 --> 01:07:49,180
where are the, uh, the Marvin Gaye's
where all these fucking people,

1053
01:07:49,210 --> 01:07:51,910
and I have this theory,

1054
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:57,120
granted Jim Norton might take the fucking
piss out of this one too with one of

1055
01:07:57,551 --> 01:07:59,200
his fucking life,
great lines,

1056
01:07:59,201 --> 01:08:04,201
but it's the same people asking these
questions of the people not paying for

1057
01:08:05,111 --> 01:08:09,490
music and a decade of trying
to have your cake and eat it.

1058
01:08:09,550 --> 01:08:12,400
Basically the music industry
doesn't exist anymore.

1059
01:08:12,820 --> 01:08:16,130
And for his dirty and filthy
as those sons of bitches were,

1060
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,370
there were just like,
there's good and bad comics.

1061
01:08:19,371 --> 01:08:24,371
There were genius guys in that industry
and they knew they could spot talent and

1062
01:08:25,641 --> 01:08:29,960
they knew how to develop it and nurture
it before they put it out there and that

1063
01:08:29,961 --> 01:08:33,590
type of stuff. And then of course
then they would steal from them. Um,

1064
01:08:34,940 --> 01:08:39,200
but like that system doesn't
fucking exist anymore. And,

1065
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:44,060
uh, my business, it's going
the same route where TV, film,

1066
01:08:44,061 --> 01:08:48,560
Dvds and all those are
not being paid for and uh,

1067
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:52,550
people are losing their
jobs and that type of shit.

1068
01:08:52,551 --> 01:08:56,450
So I don't know if you like comedy,
if you like good television,

1069
01:08:57,020 --> 01:09:00,200
I suggest trying to not saying
don't watch reality shows.

1070
01:09:00,201 --> 01:09:05,120
I would be fucking hypocrite right
now cause I love the Jersey shore.

1071
01:09:05,121 --> 01:09:05,980
I really haven't watched season

1072
01:09:06,190 --> 01:09:08,120
too,
but I watched the Jersey shore,

1073
01:09:08,121 --> 01:09:11,600
but like I still try to
watch scripted shows.

1074
01:09:12,050 --> 01:09:16,250
I pay for movies, I don't steal
movies. I pay for all my fucking music.

1075
01:09:16,790 --> 01:09:20,720
And uh, I don't know. If
you don't give a fuck,

1076
01:09:20,721 --> 01:09:23,210
then just by all means go
ahead and steal it. But if,

1077
01:09:23,250 --> 01:09:25,120
if you're one of those
people who's wondering yeah,

1078
01:09:25,390 --> 01:09:29,430
where all the great bands are,
where the great writers are, Eh,

1079
01:09:29,620 --> 01:09:30,400
that they don't have

1080
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:31,270
jobs right now,

1081
01:09:32,320 --> 01:09:37,020
they don't because you can sit on
a toilet and take a shit going,

1082
01:09:37,030 --> 01:09:39,910
sitting on a toilet,
sitting on a toilet,

1083
01:09:41,110 --> 01:09:42,040
sitting on the toilet.

1084
01:09:42,070 --> 01:09:46,210
You can do that and you'll get for some
reason a zillion fucking hits. And uh,

1085
01:09:46,300 --> 01:09:48,970
I dunno, I don't even know what my fucking
point is. Just for the love of God.

1086
01:09:48,971 --> 01:09:52,190
Can you buy the Goddamn DVD?
All right.

1087
01:09:52,360 --> 01:09:56,920
$13 26 cents so he can pick it up.
Fucking 20 bucks at one of my shows.

1088
01:09:56,921 --> 01:09:59,860
I'll sign it for you. Take a
picture, give you a Goddamn hug,

1089
01:10:00,340 --> 01:10:03,910
whatever the fuck you need. But for
Christ's second, can you support my God,

1090
01:10:03,911 --> 01:10:08,830
they have career. That's all
I'm asking you. All right, look,

1091
01:10:08,890 --> 01:10:13,330
I go on youtube too. All right.
I'm just, I'm not saying, you know,

1092
01:10:14,140 --> 01:10:17,620
I mean, I go there, I look at Shit
and I'm looking at Shit for free.

1093
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:20,770
I realize that, but the shit that
I really like, I do pay for it,

1094
01:10:20,771 --> 01:10:24,450
but I pay for all my fucking music.
All right.

1095
01:10:25,150 --> 01:10:25,983
God dammit.

1096
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:30,160
You know what's funny is most of you are
probably going to go out and buy my DVD

1097
01:10:30,161 --> 01:10:33,580
and I just basically did what the fucking
Catholic priests would do when I was

1098
01:10:33,581 --> 01:10:37,060
growing up or they would basically yell
at the people who showed up for church.

1099
01:10:37,390 --> 01:10:37,961
So with that,

1100
01:10:37,961 --> 01:10:40,960
let's give you some funny youtube clips
and you can watch all of these right in

1101
01:10:40,961 --> 01:10:44,110
a row. Conveniently on the, uh,

1102
01:10:44,130 --> 01:10:49,130
the EMN podcast.com the official fan
page of the Monday morning podcast.

1103
01:10:50,501 --> 01:10:53,800
And I want to thank all the
listeners, uh, who go on to that left,

1104
01:10:53,801 --> 01:10:57,880
all those great messages about them going
out there, trying to get the word out.

1105
01:10:57,881 --> 01:11:02,140
I'm telling you, even though
you know it, it helps out.

1106
01:11:02,140 --> 01:11:07,140
You have no fucking idea how much that
helps me out due to the fact that there's

1107
01:11:07,151 --> 01:11:11,410
500 channels now. There's the
internet, there's video games,

1108
01:11:12,250 --> 01:11:16,080
there's people with cameras
making videos for fucking youtube.

1109
01:11:16,260 --> 01:11:18,600
There's just so much shit out there.

1110
01:11:18,601 --> 01:11:22,110
There's Tivo and all that like you guys
do in. That really, really helped me.

1111
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:25,470
So I just want to say thank you. Okay.
This is really a feel good podcast.

1112
01:11:25,471 --> 01:11:28,950
You would never know that my team got
trounced by the team that I've been

1113
01:11:28,951 --> 01:11:33,050
trashing. Oh, by the way.
Oh, the Jetson apology. Um,

1114
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:37,050
I'm not the part where I say they're
not going to win the super bowl and I,

1115
01:11:37,070 --> 01:11:40,710
I won't apologize for
that. After week two, um,

1116
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:45,330
but the fact that I actually suggested
that they still play a giant stadium and

1117
01:11:45,331 --> 01:11:50,250
that they sub leaded their
stadium from, uh, from the giants.

1118
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:54,360
They don't now,
now they co own it with the giants.

1119
01:11:54,390 --> 01:11:58,380
So the jet's got a little more credibility
in the giants became a little more

1120
01:11:58,860 --> 01:11:59,431
pathetic,

1121
01:11:59,431 --> 01:12:03,210
but they can spin it and just say that
what they're doing is a very green thing

1122
01:12:03,211 --> 01:12:07,680
to do. It's great for the environment.
But, but considering, uh, the jets,

1123
01:12:07,890 --> 01:12:10,560
their colors are green,
I still think that they come out on top.

1124
01:12:10,590 --> 01:12:13,770
So a what do you guys say about that?
Um,

1125
01:12:14,070 --> 01:12:16,770
I missed the game last night where
Peyton beat the shit out of his little

1126
01:12:16,771 --> 01:12:18,900
brother.
Like all big brothers should do.

1127
01:12:20,460 --> 01:12:24,120
I have to tell you that if
you have a younger brother,

1128
01:12:24,121 --> 01:12:28,710
at no point in your life can you
ever lose to him in anything ever.

1129
01:12:30,620 --> 01:12:31,070
Yeah.

1130
01:12:31,070 --> 01:12:33,070
Now I, you know, he can
get a better fucking job,

1131
01:12:33,490 --> 01:12:35,200
marry a hotter woman
that can fucking happen.

1132
01:12:35,201 --> 01:12:39,310
But I'm talking about shit
that really counts like sports,

1133
01:12:40,270 --> 01:12:41,630
wrestling and a,

1134
01:12:41,631 --> 01:12:46,330
in a real fight you can never
fucking loose. And if they,

1135
01:12:46,331 --> 01:12:47,740
even if he beats you in a fight,

1136
01:12:47,741 --> 01:12:51,790
what you do is you just turn that into
a round and as you collect yourself,

1137
01:12:51,910 --> 01:12:56,050
you grabbed something to beat them over
the head with and then you went round to

1138
01:12:56,050 --> 01:13:00,570
, I know the ladies out there
probably don't understand that,

1139
01:13:00,571 --> 01:13:02,520
but anybody with a younger brother,
I'm telling you,

1140
01:13:02,670 --> 01:13:06,210
I never lost to any of
my younger brothers.

1141
01:13:06,270 --> 01:13:10,650
I am undefeated in fights undefeated.

1142
01:13:11,890 --> 01:13:14,880
If I said that right now,
considering we're all about the same size,

1143
01:13:14,881 --> 01:13:18,570
I would have a couple of
fights on my card, but, uh,

1144
01:13:18,660 --> 01:13:23,400
hopefully no one in my family
listens to this. All right,

1145
01:13:23,401 --> 01:13:27,660
let's get onto the youtube videos for
the week. All right. Your sons a bitches.

1146
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:32,070
Um, all of these are available
on the [inaudible] podcast.com.

1147
01:13:32,071 --> 01:13:33,630
You can watch them right in a row.
All right.

1148
01:13:33,870 --> 01:13:37,770
This is one of my favorite videos I've
seen in awhile. It's called Macho Salad,

1149
01:13:38,450 --> 01:13:40,980
m a c h o o Macho Salad.

1150
01:13:41,730 --> 01:13:44,850
And this is just a great
piece of acting from a,

1151
01:13:45,780 --> 01:13:48,300
I don't know what movie this is.
I believe at they speaking German.

1152
01:13:48,301 --> 01:13:51,540
I can't fuck I remember,
but this guy wants to get laid and his,

1153
01:13:51,930 --> 01:13:54,450
his girl tells him, you
know, she's not in the mood.

1154
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:58,050
This is what I'm guessing from the
dialogue and tells him to go make a salad.

1155
01:13:58,051 --> 01:14:02,550
And this son of a bitch makes a
fucking salad and a, it's awesome.

1156
01:14:02,790 --> 01:14:03,541
It's just like,

1157
01:14:03,541 --> 01:14:06,300
it's just one of those things where I
don't know how many takes this guy had to

1158
01:14:06,301 --> 01:14:08,640
do, but, uh, it's,

1159
01:14:08,700 --> 01:14:12,700
it's the shit and I aspire to someday be
able to do something like that. Acting.

1160
01:14:13,140 --> 01:14:17,650
All right. Um, the next
thing we got here, uh,

1161
01:14:18,790 --> 01:14:22,180
this,
this video actually made me so upset.

1162
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:27,250
You have a watch a youtube video and you
wish that you could just somehow step

1163
01:14:27,251 --> 01:14:32,251
into your screen and fucking go into the
video and just basically inflict your

1164
01:14:35,291 --> 01:14:39,910
view of what the justice should
have been now. Well, okay.

1165
01:14:40,930 --> 01:14:45,070
The watch this video, it's actually a
clip from the doctor Phil Show. You know,

1166
01:14:45,071 --> 01:14:48,640
that crooked cop looking dude
who pretends he's a psychologist,

1167
01:14:48,641 --> 01:14:51,970
but he's really just a fucking therapist
who wanted to have groupies so we can

1168
01:14:51,971 --> 01:14:55,350
get some more pussy on the
side and realized that he
wasn't going to get it in a

1169
01:14:55,350 --> 01:14:59,110
, in a fucking therapy room.
So he was like, I know,

1170
01:14:59,111 --> 01:15:04,111
I'll do a TV show and
say obvious shit slowly.

1171
01:15:07,180 --> 01:15:12,130
Uh, anyways, let's continue. Uh,

1172
01:15:12,160 --> 01:15:13,420
he has a clip on there.

1173
01:15:13,590 --> 01:15:17,950
It's the name of this video
is called fat kid slaps mum.

1174
01:15:18,090 --> 01:15:22,210
Mum.
All right and just to set this one up,

1175
01:15:23,110 --> 01:15:26,440
this is basically obviously a
mother who can't control her kid.

1176
01:15:27,130 --> 01:15:28,240
He's a fat kid.

1177
01:15:28,300 --> 01:15:33,300
He's about 11 or 12 is voice hasn't
changed yet and he's sitting there sitting

1178
01:15:37,271 --> 01:15:40,540
down across from his mother who is
also sitting down and nose to nose.

1179
01:15:40,570 --> 01:15:44,650
They are having discussion and this
kid is taking his mother to task,

1180
01:15:45,550 --> 01:15:50,290
interrupting her and then when she
gives him shit for interrupting her,

1181
01:15:50,650 --> 01:15:54,310
he goes, well how does that feel?
How does that, how do you like it?

1182
01:15:54,311 --> 01:15:58,630
Like completely out of fucking control
and this kid's got this temporary so

1183
01:15:58,631 --> 01:15:59,470
fucking out of line.

1184
01:15:59,650 --> 01:16:04,650
And then she starts giving them shit
and out of nowhere he just hauls off and

1185
01:16:04,811 --> 01:16:08,920
fucking slaps her like a God damn pimp.

1186
01:16:09,730 --> 01:16:10,630
Oh you only need one.

1187
01:16:10,631 --> 01:16:14,080
The only reason why I wasn't a pimp slap
it cause it wasn't a backhand but it

1188
01:16:14,081 --> 01:16:15,520
had the same fucking,

1189
01:16:15,521 --> 01:16:19,090
it sounded like a flare chop
right to her fucking cheek.

1190
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:22,300
And there's this pause and I'm like,
oh my God,

1191
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:26,290
she is going to be on him like a mountain
lion and I'm going to see the bomb.

1192
01:16:26,291 --> 01:16:31,291
My guy jumping in trying to pull her off
from climbing the eyes out of this kids

1193
01:16:31,961 --> 01:16:36,670
fucking head. There's that pies.
And then the kid just goes,

1194
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:39,370
how does that feel?
How do you like it?

1195
01:16:40,150 --> 01:16:44,080
And the mother does absolutely nothing.
And I swear to God,

1196
01:16:44,140 --> 01:16:45,370
I was just like,

1197
01:16:46,660 --> 01:16:51,250
I had to like stand up and like walk
around and do like little circles.

1198
01:16:51,670 --> 01:16:53,650
You don't when you want to
walk away from the video,

1199
01:16:53,651 --> 01:16:55,090
but you have to watch it again.

1200
01:16:55,480 --> 01:16:58,660
So you just do those little
fucking figure eights. I was like,

1201
01:16:58,661 --> 01:17:00,370
you gotta you gotta be fucking kidding me.

1202
01:17:01,540 --> 01:17:04,840
Why aren't you fucking chill
in that kid right now? Right.

1203
01:17:06,700 --> 01:17:09,230
And I, you know what I would've
done if I was there, if I was at a,

1204
01:17:10,670 --> 01:17:13,880
I just wanted to insert, I just really,
I was scaring my dog over there. Sorry,

1205
01:17:13,881 --> 01:17:17,120
Dude. Sorry about that. All right. We're
just acting over here. Everything's good,

1206
01:17:17,121 --> 01:17:18,700
man.
Everything's good.

1207
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:20,560
Cleo Odey Odey Odo

1208
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:22,570
sorry.
Um,

1209
01:17:25,090 --> 01:17:27,580
what does it take to make it
dogs fucking wag its tail?

1210
01:17:27,610 --> 01:17:30,700
It takes literally two
seconds. Um, anyways,

1211
01:17:32,140 --> 01:17:36,250
I just looked at that video and I was,

1212
01:17:37,350 --> 01:17:37,640
yeah,

1213
01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:40,640
I immediately just imagine
being married to that woman.

1214
01:17:40,700 --> 01:17:43,040
And then that was my son and I was,

1215
01:17:44,170 --> 01:17:44,740
yeah,

1216
01:17:44,740 --> 01:17:45,850
I got to tell you right now,

1217
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:48,010
if,
you know,

1218
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:52,130
when I married here and we
have kids and do all that shit,

1219
01:17:52,730 --> 01:17:57,560
if one of our kids ever slaps
her in the face, I will.

1220
01:17:57,620 --> 01:18:01,310
I would've, yeah, I would
have fucking throat.

1221
01:18:02,240 --> 01:18:06,560
I want to choke slam that kid through
the fucking coffee table with any luck.

1222
01:18:06,561 --> 01:18:10,640
It would be one of those old school
and tea coffee tables, you know,

1223
01:18:10,641 --> 01:18:14,240
that were made out of the really good
wood from deep in the fucking forest,

1224
01:18:14,900 --> 01:18:19,700
not that Ikea Shit that explodes
like a fucking stunt table, you know?

1225
01:18:20,270 --> 01:18:23,990
And I would just put that motherfucker
right through it and then I would pull

1226
01:18:23,991 --> 01:18:27,950
him up by his goddamn larynx and then
right through the fucking dry wall.

1227
01:18:29,020 --> 01:18:32,330
All right. My hand would be
disappearing into the wall.

1228
01:18:32,331 --> 01:18:34,460
Like I just fist it a fucking horse.

1229
01:18:39,470 --> 01:18:41,750
And you would be wondering
where that kid was.

1230
01:18:41,990 --> 01:18:46,990
And then I pull him out and he'd have
all that fucking plaster in his hair and

1231
01:18:47,541 --> 01:18:52,430
he'd start to cry and then I would just
fucking take away like three quarters of

1232
01:18:52,431 --> 01:18:55,880
his oxygen and I would whisper
in his ear really calmly,

1233
01:18:56,960 --> 01:19:01,850
like one of those bad guys in those great
eighties movies with Mel Gibson. Well,

1234
01:19:01,851 --> 01:19:06,620
once they get them tied up
or fucking Stallone or whatever,

1235
01:19:06,950 --> 01:19:11,030
all the fucking, the goons would get and
tied up. And then the, the, the real, the,

1236
01:19:11,031 --> 01:19:14,510
the head bad guy who is running shit
would just come in all relaxed with his

1237
01:19:14,511 --> 01:19:18,500
fucking dress shoes and suit and we'll
just come up and just sort of put his

1238
01:19:18,501 --> 01:19:21,680
face like parallel to the
other dude's face. You know,

1239
01:19:21,770 --> 01:19:25,160
you just come in and he just whispered
right in the guys here, nice and calmly.

1240
01:19:25,490 --> 01:19:28,340
That's what I would do to him as
this kid was struggling to breathe.

1241
01:19:29,540 --> 01:19:33,800
I just put my fucking head right next
to his ear and I would just be like,

1242
01:19:33,890 --> 01:19:37,790
if you ever slap your
mother in the face again,

1243
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:42,620
I will fucking kill you.
Do you understand me?

1244
01:19:43,910 --> 01:19:45,200
Do you want to stay on me?
Yeah.

1245
01:19:48,990 --> 01:19:52,380
The only reason why you're not dead right
now is because I haven't figured out

1246
01:19:52,381 --> 01:19:53,550
how to get away with it yet.

1247
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:58,200
I'd be saying Shit like that and then you
go upstairs and you go to your fucking

1248
01:19:58,201 --> 01:20:00,930
room. If you even look at her over
the next month, I swear to God,

1249
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:06,080
I will grab you by your fucking baby
fat and the top of your fucking head.

1250
01:20:07,230 --> 01:20:10,140
I will throw you upside down
through the fucking bay window.

1251
01:20:12,300 --> 01:20:15,060
Do you understand that?
As you sit out there in the rain,

1252
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:19,020
picking the glass in the woods,
shards out of your body?

1253
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:23,310
I'm going to take a tray or hot macaroni
and throw it right on your fucking face.

1254
01:20:23,311 --> 01:20:25,560
That's what I'm going to do. If you
ever fucking touch your mother again,

1255
01:20:25,561 --> 01:20:30,480
was that a little too violent? Was it
will I don't give a fuck. All right.

1256
01:20:30,510 --> 01:20:33,150
That's how I came up. You
know, I grew up, if I,

1257
01:20:33,151 --> 01:20:38,151
if I actually the reason why I expected
that woman to claw their kid's eyes out,

1258
01:20:38,650 --> 01:20:43,020
cause that's where my mom would have done.
My mom did not need a father figure

1259
01:20:44,610 --> 01:20:49,080
hanging around the Goddamn
House. Basically. If,

1260
01:20:49,110 --> 01:20:51,690
if that woman was my mother,

1261
01:20:52,590 --> 01:20:57,590
the only role the dad would have would
be at some point to pull the mom off that

1262
01:20:57,741 --> 01:21:02,190
kid in order to fucking say, my mother
would have just grabbed the nearest,

1263
01:21:02,191 --> 01:21:05,940
she would have fucked it off. Remember
old school moms, they, they've drew blood,

1264
01:21:06,570 --> 01:21:11,130
they will like cats and they just fucking
does is dug their nails into you and

1265
01:21:11,131 --> 01:21:13,170
they grabbed you in really weird places.

1266
01:21:13,890 --> 01:21:18,780
They would just grab like a handful of
neck somehow have your juggler in their

1267
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:23,520
head.
They do that and then the other hand,

1268
01:21:23,521 --> 01:21:26,610
like their thumb would somehow get into
this part of your arm pit you didn't

1269
01:21:26,611 --> 01:21:30,870
even know existed and they would just
take a chunk of flesh out of that somehow

1270
01:21:30,871 --> 01:21:34,610
there'd be no holes in your fucking tee
shirt and they would just stay with it

1271
01:21:34,620 --> 01:21:38,700
was unbelievable.
It's like a fucking Scifi movie.

1272
01:21:38,820 --> 01:21:40,270
When you were done and you,

1273
01:21:40,271 --> 01:21:45,090
you fucking went upstairs and your skin
was just burning from wherever the fuck

1274
01:21:45,091 --> 01:21:46,890
they had Claude you when
you took it look like, yeah,

1275
01:21:46,891 --> 01:21:48,570
like he got attacked by a bobcat

1276
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:53,800
right to delos mom's exist anymore.

1277
01:21:56,810 --> 01:22:00,030
I Dunno. I think there's been
an overcorrection and more time.

1278
01:22:00,031 --> 01:22:03,270
One of my brothers said that I kicked
him in the face, which was bullshit.

1279
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:05,130
I kicked him in the stomach,

1280
01:22:05,580 --> 01:22:09,810
which was considered legal and
working it out amongst yourselves.

1281
01:22:11,610 --> 01:22:14,810
My mother was brushing her hair.
She was late for work. She had to,

1282
01:22:14,820 --> 01:22:16,770
she had to go with frontier justice.

1283
01:22:16,950 --> 01:22:19,230
She didn't have time for
my side of the story.

1284
01:22:19,410 --> 01:22:23,070
She just turned around and she went
to smash this thing over my head,

1285
01:22:23,071 --> 01:22:27,060
like a fucking gavel. So I did. Basically,

1286
01:22:27,540 --> 01:22:30,990
I did this defensive move where I ducked,
but not like a man.

1287
01:22:31,140 --> 01:22:32,700
I didn't do like the boxing,

1288
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:36,090
like fucking come up and under and
then fucking with the right hook.

1289
01:22:36,091 --> 01:22:37,080
I didn't do that shit.

1290
01:22:37,200 --> 01:22:42,200
What I basically did was I immediately
did a fucking one 80 so now I wasn't

1291
01:22:43,921 --> 01:22:47,430
facing my mother.
I put my shoulders up to my ears,

1292
01:22:47,730 --> 01:22:52,730
I bent over slightly at a 45 degree
angle and then for some reason I made my

1293
01:22:52,951 --> 01:22:56,480
arms go a little,
my elbows go a little past my back and I,

1294
01:22:56,520 --> 01:23:01,520
I I squinted eye look like
Pau Gasol before right before
he decides to go to the

1295
01:23:02,190 --> 01:23:05,680
rack, anticipating the foul.
And Luckily I ducked enough,

1296
01:23:05,681 --> 01:23:09,340
she missed my head and just
hit me right in the back.

1297
01:23:10,030 --> 01:23:13,540
Like I took one of those folding chairs
and rustling from Pat Patterson right to

1298
01:23:13,541 --> 01:23:18,541
my fucking back and I went down and a
Goddamn heap in landed on that Kmart

1299
01:23:19,541 --> 01:23:24,541
fucking bath mat is the shards of the
plastic brush just landed all around me.

1300
01:23:26,330 --> 01:23:29,890
And you know what my mother's big
concern was was that she broke her brush,

1301
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:34,990
you know,
and it was old school back then moon.

1302
01:23:34,991 --> 01:23:39,390
You didn't have flat screen TVs and
when you're broke a brush, if they,

1303
01:23:39,391 --> 01:23:43,390
if the rubber part with the bristles
still existed, she just continue using it.

1304
01:23:43,390 --> 01:23:45,640
And she did for years.
She just,

1305
01:23:45,641 --> 01:23:48,820
she just hit rather than having
a handle and fucking combing it,

1306
01:23:48,821 --> 01:23:50,380
like brushing it like Barbie,

1307
01:23:50,381 --> 01:23:53,620
she just held it in her hand now like you
know those brushes black guys use when

1308
01:23:53,621 --> 01:23:55,030
they try to get waves in their hair.

1309
01:23:55,180 --> 01:23:59,320
That's what it looked like and she just
kept using that and every time I sought

1310
01:23:59,970 --> 01:24:03,070
arrows reminded of that and it was
like a week later that the two of us,

1311
01:24:03,071 --> 01:24:06,310
we just started laughing about it like,
mom,

1312
01:24:06,311 --> 01:24:07,930
when are you going to buy a new brush?
And she's one,

1313
01:24:08,040 --> 01:24:10,900
there's nothing wrong with this one.
There's nothing wrong with it.

1314
01:24:10,930 --> 01:24:13,870
It doesn't fucking three quarters
of it doesn't even exist anymore.

1315
01:24:14,170 --> 01:24:18,310
It isn't a fucking reminder that you
smash the rest of it over it over one of

1316
01:24:18,311 --> 01:24:21,070
your kids' backs.
No,

1317
01:24:21,071 --> 01:24:26,050
she didn't give a fuck and she should
enough. She was right. She was right.

1318
01:24:26,110 --> 01:24:29,380
That was my thing about that show it.
I don't know.

1319
01:24:29,410 --> 01:24:30,880
That's the way parenting used to be.

1320
01:24:30,910 --> 01:24:34,510
The mom used to kick the shit out of
you and the dad didn't have to kick the

1321
01:24:34,511 --> 01:24:35,260
shit out of you.

1322
01:24:35,260 --> 01:24:39,430
All he had to do is go and you
fucking peed yourself a little bit.

1323
01:24:39,431 --> 01:24:43,990
And that was it. So that's what
I got out of that clip, man.

1324
01:24:43,991 --> 01:24:48,010
That's just bad parenting. That kid
should have never got it. That was my kid.

1325
01:24:48,011 --> 01:24:52,390
That kid would have been stuffed upside
down in a fucking hamper and slid down a

1326
01:24:52,391 --> 01:24:55,960
flight of fucking stairs.
Huh? How about that?

1327
01:24:56,470 --> 01:24:59,950
How about your point now? How
does that feel? All right.

1328
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:05,020
Give him a Lo's ass kickings where you,
you only end up with one shoe on.

1329
01:25:05,710 --> 01:25:10,600
You know,
I used to do a bit about that on stage.

1330
01:25:10,601 --> 01:25:14,170
I don't know if I ever fucking, uh,
I might have to bring that one back.

1331
01:25:14,171 --> 01:25:15,640
Speaking of that first
question that I had,

1332
01:25:15,641 --> 01:25:19,540
I used to do a bit about anytime you
get beat up by five or more people,

1333
01:25:19,541 --> 01:25:24,310
you always lose a shoe. You know,
what the hell bit was that like,

1334
01:25:24,311 --> 01:25:24,581
you know,

1335
01:25:24,581 --> 01:25:28,960
you get your ass kicking your ass
kicked when there's like debris of you

1336
01:25:28,961 --> 01:25:33,070
afterwards and you have to like
collect your personal belongings.

1337
01:25:33,730 --> 01:25:36,460
Oh fuck. I remember. What the
hell did the hell did it go?

1338
01:25:37,580 --> 01:25:40,740
Some other tag was something about having
a deck of cards. I had a decade cave.

1339
01:25:40,780 --> 01:25:43,810
You see the jacket diamonds, like just
your shit was just that. I don't know.

1340
01:25:43,900 --> 01:25:47,740
I can't remember how the fuck
it went. But anyways. Um,

1341
01:25:47,890 --> 01:25:51,010
so if you want to see what old
school parenting looks like it,

1342
01:25:51,011 --> 01:25:55,000
but in a funnier way, there's another
youtube clip. Watch this, this clip.

1343
01:25:55,001 --> 01:25:59,500
It's called spoiled kid
gets yelled at and uh,

1344
01:25:59,770 --> 01:26:04,760
yeah, the guy yelling in. This
is basically dad. All right.

1345
01:26:04,761 --> 01:26:06,320
This is the funny version of it,

1346
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:10,760
of what he really had to do
and was totally in the right.

1347
01:26:12,080 --> 01:26:16,610
Um, when he did it, like I don't have
any, uh, that's my thing. You know what?

1348
01:26:16,611 --> 01:26:19,970
The old school parenting, you
know, it bothered me as a kid,

1349
01:26:19,971 --> 01:26:21,470
but when I look back on it now,

1350
01:26:21,471 --> 01:26:24,980
it's like I deserved so many ass.

1351
01:26:24,980 --> 01:26:28,430
Kickings so many fucking ass kick.
I deserved them.

1352
01:26:29,390 --> 01:26:34,280
I fucking deserve to ever, what time,
what are my brother's pissed me off.

1353
01:26:34,490 --> 01:26:39,080
And I took out a garden hose and I started
spraying it through the fucking, uh,

1354
01:26:39,350 --> 01:26:40,790
I was so mad cause I had a water,

1355
01:26:41,570 --> 01:26:45,710
the plants and he was making fun of me
and I just took this thing and I fucking,

1356
01:26:45,711 --> 01:26:48,860
I just, I, I, you know, I had a
temper, I just sprayed it right at him,

1357
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:52,820
right into the house. And uh, you know,

1358
01:26:52,821 --> 01:26:55,250
and that was the day I
learned what dark tastes like.

1359
01:27:00,690 --> 01:27:00,840
Yeah.

1360
01:27:00,840 --> 01:27:05,340
My mother had me, was on my back
just pushing me into the mud.

1361
01:27:07,350 --> 01:27:08,700
Ah Yeah. That was, those were the days.

1362
01:27:08,701 --> 01:27:12,750
And then all your other siblings would
stand around laughing cause your mother

1363
01:27:12,751 --> 01:27:14,340
couldn't hear the laughter over the rage.

1364
01:27:14,341 --> 01:27:18,720
She always focus on the one part is
we're just laughing and then you come in

1365
01:27:18,721 --> 01:27:23,580
with your mud covered face
crying and everybody just laughs.

1366
01:27:24,830 --> 01:27:28,830
Just Ah, Shit. I used to see,
I remember back in the day,

1367
01:27:28,831 --> 01:27:33,630
I remember seeing one of my, one of
my friends mouthed off to his mother,

1368
01:27:33,780 --> 01:27:37,740
I went over to his house to get some
lunch and he mouthed off to his mom

1369
01:27:39,590 --> 01:27:42,780
and he wanted to see when it dessert
or something and she was just like, no,

1370
01:27:42,781 --> 01:27:46,320
it's lunchtime. You don't get any dessert.
And he can just go. So mom, I hate you.

1371
01:27:46,380 --> 01:27:51,380
Like we were little kids and the kids'
Dad did not even look up from his

1372
01:27:52,141 --> 01:27:55,870
sandwich.
Just took a whole Glick kids,

1373
01:27:55,890 --> 01:27:58,860
whole glass of milk and
just threw it in my face.

1374
01:28:02,730 --> 01:28:04,920
So my friend just starts crying,
right?

1375
01:28:04,921 --> 01:28:09,720
The Dad goes back to eating a sandwich
and then the mother just got up right on

1376
01:28:10,020 --> 01:28:13,620
cue, went over and just
cleaned it up and that was it.

1377
01:28:13,621 --> 01:28:17,790
And I can guarantee you that kid
never said, oh mom, I hate you again.

1378
01:28:17,791 --> 01:28:20,670
This whole fucking time out shit.
I know that's a hacky bit,

1379
01:28:21,060 --> 01:28:23,880
but I really believe it. I
really believe that. You know,

1380
01:28:24,900 --> 01:28:29,170
you got to slap them around. You gotta
you gotta you know gotta hit you.

1381
01:28:29,171 --> 01:28:31,560
I had a really hard, I'm not talking
about literally abusing them, but yeah,

1382
01:28:31,680 --> 01:28:34,940
you gotta throw a glass of milk
in their face. You gotta grow,

1383
01:28:34,980 --> 01:28:38,400
you gotta basically ruined
one of their shirts.

1384
01:28:38,460 --> 01:28:42,780
And by that I mean grabbed them by the
front of it and lift them up by it to the

1385
01:28:42,781 --> 01:28:47,520
point where all their body weight is
on the neck of the shirt and it rips a

1386
01:28:47,521 --> 01:28:52,521
little bit and leaves that red mark that
goes past your fucking collarbone down

1387
01:28:53,401 --> 01:28:57,600
to your sternum. Then there's a whole
generation of kids, listen to this day,

1388
01:28:57,601 --> 01:28:59,280
have no idea what I'm talking about.

1389
01:28:59,281 --> 01:29:03,540
But anybody remotely my age is punching
the dashboard right now. Laughing,

1390
01:29:03,720 --> 01:29:07,880
remembering all of this
shit. Uh, I don't know.

1391
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:09,870
Did it make us better people?
I don't fucking know,

1392
01:29:09,871 --> 01:29:13,620
but we shut the fuck up at dinner.
All right, let's continue. Um,

1393
01:29:14,850 --> 01:29:19,410
question, uh, Bill, would you
ever consider hosting a late
night talk show? I would,

1394
01:29:19,530 --> 01:29:22,950
I think I would love to do that.
Um,

1395
01:29:23,550 --> 01:29:27,330
I would love to do that.
Provided I could do my monologue,

1396
01:29:27,360 --> 01:29:32,360
like my stand up and I could really just
sort of a do what I do in a cleaner,

1397
01:29:35,430 --> 01:29:38,750
cleaner way. I guess. I would
love to do that. And uh,

1398
01:29:38,760 --> 01:29:41,910
I think I could actually ask some
really interesting questions.

1399
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:47,930
Um, you know, and I'm not going to
give away what the fucking questions.

1400
01:29:47,970 --> 01:29:50,210
I'm talking a little shit.
Got a little Rex Ryan on you here.

1401
01:29:51,070 --> 01:29:54,450
Go Little Rex Ryan on you
here. Um, yeah, I would love,
I would love doing that, but,

1402
01:29:54,690 --> 01:29:57,990
um, I, my career has not
gone down that direction.

1403
01:29:59,010 --> 01:30:02,580
So that's like a whole thing where I
think you have to decide you want to be a

1404
01:30:02,581 --> 01:30:05,310
broadcaster.
Um,

1405
01:30:06,870 --> 01:30:08,550
like Jon Stewart,
like early on,

1406
01:30:08,551 --> 01:30:13,551
like I remember hearing like he just
was this phenomenal comedian and then he

1407
01:30:14,821 --> 01:30:19,821
just really early on started going down
that road of being a broadcaster and you

1408
01:30:21,451 --> 01:30:25,710
get seen as that. So,
uh, I dunno, who knows.

1409
01:30:26,130 --> 01:30:26,761
Never say never.

1410
01:30:26,761 --> 01:30:29,370
If they gave me the opportunity now
with fucking take it in a second.

1411
01:30:30,120 --> 01:30:33,300
I would take it in a fucking
second. Um, all right,

1412
01:30:34,440 --> 01:30:38,310
here's some advice. All right. Uh, but,
but uh, but, but uh, all right, Bill,

1413
01:30:38,330 --> 01:30:41,880
let me paint me this picture for a moment.
I used to be terrible with girls.

1414
01:30:41,910 --> 01:30:45,570
I was always a nice guy, but that
gets you nowhere. Oh, Jesus. Exactly.

1415
01:30:45,900 --> 01:30:49,740
Girls always said I was really nice,
but uh, they were never interested.

1416
01:30:50,040 --> 01:30:53,190
This was because I lacked confidence
and wasn't sure of myself.

1417
01:30:53,191 --> 01:30:56,910
There you go there. This
guy taken responsibility for
himself. It's exactly yet,

1418
01:30:57,300 --> 01:30:58,500
so as time went on,

1419
01:30:58,650 --> 01:31:03,650
I got a few practice girls
in my conference inevitably
grow and I started doing

1420
01:31:03,901 --> 01:31:08,640
well. There you go right there. All
you youngsters, young guys out there.

1421
01:31:09,090 --> 01:31:12,990
Nice guys trying to get fucking laid.
There it is. That's page one right there.

1422
01:31:12,991 --> 01:31:16,770
You're a nice guy. You're
fucking boring them. All right.

1423
01:31:16,771 --> 01:31:19,620
You gotta be a little bit
of a Dick, right? Nia is,

1424
01:31:19,621 --> 01:31:21,750
you walk in and try to have
respect for the podcast.

1425
01:31:22,500 --> 01:31:26,400
How much look at you. I can see
it on your face right now. These,

1426
01:31:26,420 --> 01:31:30,030
she's doing that classic girl thing
where she's trying not to smile and she's

1427
01:31:30,031 --> 01:31:31,620
rolling her fucking eyes and you know it.

1428
01:31:32,250 --> 01:31:36,570
You gotta be a little bit of a cocky
asshole. You've got to come up.

1429
01:31:36,660 --> 01:31:40,920
You've got insult them a little bit.
Yeah, you do. Like if I saw you right now,

1430
01:31:40,921 --> 01:31:43,390
even though I like your outfit, I would
walk up to you and be like, what do you,

1431
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:44,520
what'd you come straight from?
Work.

1432
01:31:44,910 --> 01:31:47,340
That's how you dress when you
come out and you'd be like, what?

1433
01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:51,630
I'm just fucking with you. What are
you drinking right out of the gate?

1434
01:31:51,990 --> 01:31:56,670
Come right out. Put your balls right on
the fucking table. Take a look at him,

1435
01:31:56,671 --> 01:32:00,670
sweetie.
I'm just trying to grow.

1436
01:32:00,671 --> 01:32:04,540
Shout No. Whenever you got to
charmer, do what you gotta do.

1437
01:32:05,260 --> 01:32:08,960
I don't like your fucking sandals.
I don't like them.

1438
01:32:09,380 --> 01:32:13,980
I've been meaning to tell you. Oh, that
was a good one. Right in the fucking leg.

1439
01:32:16,840 --> 01:32:21,440
Didn't see that. She just gave me the
finger as she walked out. See right there.

1440
01:32:21,560 --> 01:32:24,200
That's the little ebb and flow.
You have to have in your relationship.

1441
01:32:24,440 --> 01:32:27,260
See if you're always complimenting them.
You know what women are like,

1442
01:32:27,380 --> 01:32:29,450
they're like dogs,
right?

1443
01:32:32,210 --> 01:32:36,560
This is a record for me. I've gone 46
minutes without trashing women. Um, yeah,

1444
01:32:36,690 --> 01:32:40,270
they like dogs. They really are. As
much as they tried to say, we like dogs,

1445
01:32:40,280 --> 01:32:44,270
people are just like fucking dog. She
can't reward them all the Goddamn time.

1446
01:32:44,420 --> 01:32:47,150
Stroke in the back of that Goddamn head.
Next thing you know,

1447
01:32:47,330 --> 01:32:50,370
there's shitting on the rug.
Maybe once in a while.

1448
01:32:50,371 --> 01:32:51,480
I got to give him a little discipline.

1449
01:32:51,481 --> 01:32:56,060
Tell him you don't like what they're
wearing. Um, anyways, so he was a guy.

1450
01:32:56,061 --> 01:32:59,630
He figured it out. Why am I not
getting laid? I don't have confidence.

1451
01:32:59,810 --> 01:33:02,390
So what do I need to do? I need to
go out there and get some at bats.

1452
01:33:02,391 --> 01:33:03,224
That's what you'd do.

1453
01:33:03,720 --> 01:33:08,420
You'd go out there and you start talking
some shit and you're going to bomb and

1454
01:33:08,421 --> 01:33:09,620
you're gonna embarrass yourself,

1455
01:33:09,621 --> 01:33:12,590
but eventually you're going
to push through and all
those times you embarrassed

1456
01:33:12,591 --> 01:33:14,690
yourself. They're just, they're just
going to become, they're just gonna.

1457
01:33:15,260 --> 01:33:18,830
They're just gonna be
funny stories to tell. Um,

1458
01:33:20,790 --> 01:33:21,980
oh shit.
Do I have a funny one?

1459
01:33:22,430 --> 01:33:24,260
I remember when I used to
try and go to dance clubs,

1460
01:33:24,261 --> 01:33:25,900
which were totally weren't my saint,

1461
01:33:26,090 --> 01:33:28,520
cause not only was I not good
looking enough to be in there,

1462
01:33:28,790 --> 01:33:31,040
I didn't know how to
dance and couldn't dance.

1463
01:33:31,070 --> 01:33:35,240
And I would just walk up to girls and
my opening line was I would yell, Hey,

1464
01:33:36,020 --> 01:33:39,620
do you want to dance? And
then they would go, no.

1465
01:33:40,220 --> 01:33:43,130
And then I walk away.

1466
01:33:45,440 --> 01:33:45,590
Oh.

1467
01:33:45,590 --> 01:33:50,590
And it would take me at least another 40
minutes if I did to get the courage to

1468
01:33:50,661 --> 01:33:54,110
approach another one. And that's the thing
you brought. Still fucking appreciate.

1469
01:33:54,980 --> 01:33:56,480
You know, what are you going to do? Well,

1470
01:33:56,481 --> 01:33:59,680
you got to sit there and pluck you who
has and pick the right fucking colored

1471
01:33:59,681 --> 01:34:04,310
dog, make sure it matches your bra.
You get to do all of that and private.

1472
01:34:04,430 --> 01:34:07,490
We got to sit there and basically
it's like doing stand up.

1473
01:34:07,491 --> 01:34:10,250
The only way to learn how to do is you
have to go on stage and just eat your

1474
01:34:10,251 --> 01:34:13,940
balls. You got to bomb. Um, I dunno.

1475
01:34:13,941 --> 01:34:16,880
I guess it all gets made up because they
get pregnant and they got to deal with

1476
01:34:16,881 --> 01:34:20,180
that fucking Shit, you know? And if
forget about the pain of pregnancy,

1477
01:34:20,181 --> 01:34:24,790
can you imagine another thing
growing inside of you? Jesus.

1478
01:34:24,830 --> 01:34:27,610
I would go to the doctor and be
like, get this out of me. This,

1479
01:34:27,620 --> 01:34:32,480
this virus that can fit.
It's eating my guts.

1480
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:37,220
No, no, no, no. That's what's supposed
to happen. Get it out. Get it out.

1481
01:34:38,750 --> 01:34:41,390
Um, all right. Anyways,
let's continue here.

1482
01:34:41,391 --> 01:34:44,330
So a time went on and I realized
how ignorant all that's.

1483
01:34:44,331 --> 01:34:48,650
That was all right ladies.
Ladies, it's ladies night today.

1484
01:34:48,890 --> 01:34:52,370
It's ladies day morning on
the Monday morning podcast.

1485
01:34:52,490 --> 01:34:56,780
I should have a ladies' morning. Should
I, a ladies night on the Monday morning,

1486
01:34:58,190 --> 01:34:59,720
you know,
and I'll play clips.

1487
01:34:59,780 --> 01:35:04,130
I should do that and just be honoring
you while I fucking just trash you.

1488
01:35:05,160 --> 01:35:08,270
Am I own roundabout conti waste.
That's what I'll do. I'll just play.

1489
01:35:13,090 --> 01:35:17,490
Yeah. Okay. All right.

1490
01:35:17,491 --> 01:35:21,530
I'm back. I just ran out of
battery power. God dammit.

1491
01:35:21,540 --> 01:35:26,460
I was on a nice roll there. That always
makes the editing difficult. I apologize.

1492
01:35:26,461 --> 01:35:31,220
Everybody the fuck happened. Um, you
know what's funny too is I went and I,

1493
01:35:31,221 --> 01:35:35,730
and I bought a whole bunch
of these two Aa batteries,

1494
01:35:37,010 --> 01:35:37,420
you know,
I'm like

1495
01:35:37,420 --> 01:35:40,820
girls, I said we need more travel
aid batteries. He by Aa batteries,

1496
01:35:41,220 --> 01:35:42,170
I'm always using them.
Right.

1497
01:35:42,470 --> 01:35:47,470
So I go down to the Goddamn cvs and I buy
like this big fucking 12 pack of them.

1498
01:35:48,410 --> 01:35:50,120
12 AA batteries.

1499
01:35:51,420 --> 01:35:56,420
I go up to the package just like one
left fucking God damn fucking women.

1500
01:36:00,160 --> 01:36:04,320
Yeah. No matter what you buy,
it's not enough. It's never a fun.

1501
01:36:04,350 --> 01:36:09,090
I just go take a battery out of some
God damn thing that she owns. No,

1502
01:36:09,150 --> 01:36:12,160
not a vibrator. Yes.
Fucking filthy assholes.

1503
01:36:13,060 --> 01:36:16,650
So actually this baby monitor so we
can watch the dog in here. Which crate?

1504
01:36:16,651 --> 01:36:19,080
Training the motherfucker.
Um,

1505
01:36:20,520 --> 01:36:21,780
so we sit here and watch this.

1506
01:36:21,781 --> 01:36:24,570
Why we couldn't just use our
laptops and skyped it, you know,

1507
01:36:24,571 --> 01:36:27,810
sent the signal up to the
fucking satellite, whatever.

1508
01:36:27,811 --> 01:36:31,740
Let's get back on track here. I swear
to God, if I bought the 24 pack,

1509
01:36:31,830 --> 01:36:33,970
they would still only be one left.
Okay.

1510
01:36:34,120 --> 01:36:37,690
Well, I just replaced the batteries
and everything just in case.

1511
01:36:39,170 --> 01:36:43,110
Why is it illegal to slap
you? Okay, let's plow.

1512
01:36:44,780 --> 01:36:49,250
That's so me. I would
never do that. Okay ladies,

1513
01:36:49,460 --> 01:36:52,550
let's relax. All right, so let's,
let's plow ahead yet. Let me,

1514
01:36:52,580 --> 01:36:54,980
let me get through the advice here so
I can watch the Monday night football,

1515
01:36:55,100 --> 01:36:58,940
what you guys are probably already
doing. Um, so anyway, so this guy here,

1516
01:36:58,941 --> 01:37:01,520
so as time went on and got my confidence,
I started doing well,

1517
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:04,460
I reserve the right. Uh Oh.
Anyways, he said, you know,

1518
01:37:04,461 --> 01:37:07,910
I didn't become cocky or start acting
like I'm God's gift to women because I

1519
01:37:07,911 --> 01:37:12,830
know, um, you know, I'm not that
mentality and it's for dickheads. Uh,

1520
01:37:12,831 --> 01:37:15,380
so anyways, this guy has been through
a considerable amount of women.

1521
01:37:15,381 --> 01:37:18,290
I'm trying to paraphrase here
cause this is a really long email.

1522
01:37:18,530 --> 01:37:22,580
He ends up meeting, meeting this
girl, everything's going great.

1523
01:37:24,710 --> 01:37:28,190
Um, he's having a good time with her.
After some time, this guys from Ireland,

1524
01:37:28,191 --> 01:37:30,590
he says after some time,
uh,

1525
01:37:30,591 --> 01:37:35,591
the blow jobs in sex altogether
had started to diminish.

1526
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,130
I had a paraphrase cause he
wrote a ton of information there.

1527
01:37:38,131 --> 01:37:40,470
Basically he meets this girl,
everything's going great.

1528
01:37:40,980 --> 01:37:43,890
They basically drinking and fucking, and
everything's often, and then you know,

1529
01:37:43,891 --> 01:37:47,250
it starts tapering off. So, uh,

1530
01:37:48,220 --> 01:37:53,040
that's how it starts tapering off.
And she started to use sex as a weapon.

1531
01:37:54,870 --> 01:37:56,980
Uh,
she play mental games with me and it,

1532
01:37:56,981 --> 01:38:01,470
and I end up feeling like a bastard
when she'd shoot me down for sex,

1533
01:38:01,471 --> 01:38:04,290
I'd say that's cool. I don't
mind that. I excuse myself.

1534
01:38:04,291 --> 01:38:09,120
Go to the bathroom and crack one out.
There you go sir. That's what you do.

1535
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:14,130
You know when, when you
get to that fucking Kevin
Spacey, Beautiful Mind Level,

1536
01:38:14,430 --> 01:38:18,840
you rub one out right in front of her.
Never.

1537
01:38:18,841 --> 01:38:23,100
I've never done that, but I think that,
that's awesome. Um, anyways, Egos.

1538
01:38:23,850 --> 01:38:27,690
Um, so anyways, I still got to Yampa
the barrel, but she wasn't involved.

1539
01:38:27,691 --> 01:38:31,140
And when I tried to talk to
her calmly about what she was,

1540
01:38:31,560 --> 01:38:35,640
see what she was thinking and how she
was feeling, it would never go well.

1541
01:38:35,700 --> 01:38:38,040
She returned on the waterworks
and play the victim,

1542
01:38:38,220 --> 01:38:41,250
even though she was the one who
instigated the mind fucking,

1543
01:38:41,910 --> 01:38:46,290
I'm not sure what her reject objective
was because the concept of emotional

1544
01:38:46,291 --> 01:38:49,190
blackmail is a foreign concept to me.
Um,

1545
01:38:49,240 --> 01:38:53,040
I had always tried to approach everything
with the rational under understanding

1546
01:38:53,041 --> 01:38:57,420
basis so that she wouldn't feel
targeted or threatened. Um,

1547
01:38:57,421 --> 01:39:01,440
I should also add that it took a lot
for me to sit down calmly and talk while

1548
01:39:01,830 --> 01:39:06,830
accepting criticism from her as I'm
a very direct in often angry fella.

1549
01:39:07,170 --> 01:39:09,120
Well, that's the only red
flag there. Other than that,

1550
01:39:09,121 --> 01:39:12,720
you seem like you take your
shit and you give it as well.

1551
01:39:12,850 --> 01:39:17,040
Now you got to watch the anger. Do, trust
me, I can speak volumes of that. Uh,

1552
01:39:17,100 --> 01:39:20,940
I'm not the best guy in the world,
so you can imagine how difficult it was,

1553
01:39:20,941 --> 01:39:24,860
not the puncher in her cunt face. Okay.
This is getting a little uglier. Uh,

1554
01:39:24,861 --> 01:39:26,430
as soon as she started crying,

1555
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:30,810
as I see crying as a school yard
scapegoat for girls to get what they want

1556
01:39:30,811 --> 01:39:34,440
because they know men don't know
how to handle it. All right.

1557
01:39:35,220 --> 01:39:36,840
I'm with you with everything
right up to there.

1558
01:39:36,841 --> 01:39:39,450
Sometimes women do cry
because they're upset.

1559
01:39:39,690 --> 01:39:43,980
They do have access to that
emotion more than we do.

1560
01:39:44,040 --> 01:39:48,390
And I know, but I know that angry
feeling you have where you're like,

1561
01:39:50,190 --> 01:39:53,730
this is how you have to
gauge that is basically,

1562
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:57,060
if they cry every time,
then you can call bullshit.

1563
01:39:57,090 --> 01:40:01,290
But if they only cry once
in a fucking Blue Moon,

1564
01:40:01,291 --> 01:40:06,270
then you have to realize that
you've really upset them and yeah.

1565
01:40:06,271 --> 01:40:07,710
And then you just got to deal with that.

1566
01:40:07,740 --> 01:40:11,910
That fucking awkwardness of not knowing
what to do and then also feeling like a

1567
01:40:11,911 --> 01:40:13,560
bully.
But there's nothing worse.

1568
01:40:13,561 --> 01:40:17,760
I will agree with you that if your right
and you haven't done anything wrong and

1569
01:40:17,761 --> 01:40:21,270
then they start crying and then you know,

1570
01:40:22,020 --> 01:40:24,960
you can't be a dick in that moment,
but you don't,

1571
01:40:24,990 --> 01:40:27,630
that doesn't mean you have just cause
they're crying doesn't mean you have to

1572
01:40:27,631 --> 01:40:32,520
apologize if you're fucking right.
You don't have to apologize. Uh,

1573
01:40:32,521 --> 01:40:35,310
but there is that thing where if
you make a female cry, I mean,

1574
01:40:35,311 --> 01:40:38,880
if you're any sort of a guy, it's very
difficult to just stand there and be like,

1575
01:40:38,881 --> 01:40:43,290
what? Well, I don't give a fuck your
crying. Go ahead. Cry some more. Huh?

1576
01:40:43,560 --> 01:40:47,580
Like you're that guy in the Great Santini
you're gonna shed a few start bouncing

1577
01:40:47,581 --> 01:40:50,940
a basketball off the back of their
head. You can't be that guy. All right,

1578
01:40:50,941 --> 01:40:55,570
so let's plow ahead here. Um, and anyways,
females, if you want to chime in there,

1579
01:40:55,810 --> 01:40:59,940
uh, ladies, um, what's
the deal with the crews?

1580
01:41:01,570 --> 01:41:03,580
Like what percentage of it is bullshit?

1581
01:41:04,030 --> 01:41:08,470
Can I get an honest fucking
woman out there? I mean,

1582
01:41:08,920 --> 01:41:11,800
God knows guys, we have our
techniques to get out of Shit, man.

1583
01:41:11,920 --> 01:41:13,990
They're fucking pathetic.
And you see right through them.

1584
01:41:15,220 --> 01:41:16,330
And I know right now you're like,

1585
01:41:16,331 --> 01:41:19,120
why are you just rubbing
their fucking muffs right now?

1586
01:41:19,121 --> 01:41:21,100
Because that's a strategy
to win arguments.

1587
01:41:21,101 --> 01:41:22,780
You just keep feeding their fucking ego.

1588
01:41:22,930 --> 01:41:26,230
There's a lot of women out there who
really believe that guys are so fucking

1589
01:41:26,231 --> 01:41:29,290
dumb that they can't
get anything past him.

1590
01:41:29,320 --> 01:41:33,010
And that's a great place for them to
continue existing as far as I'm concerned.

1591
01:41:34,240 --> 01:41:37,360
Um, oh yeah. Yeah. No, we can get anything
by you. You're just fucking, yeah,

1592
01:41:37,450 --> 01:41:42,220
you're the fucking goddamn world police
with, you know, you have a vagina.

1593
01:41:42,250 --> 01:41:44,500
You fucking know everything.
Yeah. I can't get anything by you.

1594
01:41:45,820 --> 01:41:50,200
You are all powerful.
I bow down in front of the,

1595
01:41:51,460 --> 01:41:54,790
um, you know what? He
was funny about that.

1596
01:41:54,791 --> 01:41:57,430
Yet any magazine out there can just,
you know,

1597
01:41:57,431 --> 01:42:02,431
fashion magazine can just tap into their
fucking insecurities and get them to

1598
01:42:02,921 --> 01:42:04,210
buy the dumbest,

1599
01:42:04,240 --> 01:42:09,040
stupidest fucking war paid to put on
their fucking face because some amazing

1600
01:42:09,580 --> 01:42:11,980
[inaudible].
I don't know,

1601
01:42:12,490 --> 01:42:17,140
nee knocked pigeon toed fucking
drugged up Twat is wearing it,

1602
01:42:17,500 --> 01:42:21,040
but you can't get it out. You can't get
anything past them yet. That's great.

1603
01:42:21,041 --> 01:42:24,730
My voice just cracked right there.
Can't get a lake best them.

1604
01:42:26,320 --> 01:42:30,160
Um, I'm sorry. I'm actually getting over
a cold if you haven't, if you can't tell,

1605
01:42:30,280 --> 01:42:31,450
how did you get the cold bill?

1606
01:42:31,510 --> 01:42:35,260
Was it from traveling the country and
doing all that press notice and it's cause

1607
01:42:35,261 --> 01:42:38,680
I played a game of football
and the fucking rain in
street clothes before Monday

1608
01:42:38,680 --> 01:42:43,150
night football last week. I'm
sorry, I was amped up. Um, anyways,

1609
01:42:43,151 --> 01:42:46,360
let's plow ahead. So, uh,

1610
01:42:46,390 --> 01:42:50,620
basically this guy deals with her for the
next two fucking months and he finally

1611
01:42:50,621 --> 01:42:54,790
ends up just saying he woke up one day
and said, get your shape out of my flat.

1612
01:42:55,510 --> 01:42:58,030
This, this is over. I can't
deal with these mind games.

1613
01:42:58,030 --> 01:43:00,700
So where do I get to his question here?

1614
01:43:03,160 --> 01:43:07,270
Um, anyways, I don't have much of an ego.

1615
01:43:07,660 --> 01:43:09,670
I like to accept my
faults. You know, Dude,

1616
01:43:09,790 --> 01:43:13,330
you've said that one too many times where
I'm starting to think maybe you do and

1617
01:43:13,331 --> 01:43:18,220
maybe this woman is buried in a new
fucking turnip garden in your backyard.

1618
01:43:18,790 --> 01:43:20,320
I like to accept my faults in the mid.

1619
01:43:20,770 --> 01:43:25,030
What I have done is wrong and learn from
it so as not to make the same mistakes

1620
01:43:25,031 --> 01:43:26,920
over and over again. My question is, Bill,

1621
01:43:27,100 --> 01:43:32,100
how do I get them to fuck up and stop
testing my patients and how do I meet

1622
01:43:34,211 --> 01:43:38,470
someone who doesn't want to control
me with their bullshit games? Um,

1623
01:43:41,110 --> 01:43:43,270
I dunno dude. I, half of this,

1624
01:43:43,271 --> 01:43:46,450
I'm really going with you when you seem
like an introspective person and the

1625
01:43:46,451 --> 01:43:49,030
other half you're,
you've worded this kind of like a psycho.

1626
01:43:50,200 --> 01:43:54,320
How do you get them to up and stop testing
your pain? Like testing your patients?

1627
01:43:54,321 --> 01:43:55,280
That's kind of like a,

1628
01:43:55,520 --> 01:43:58,550
I pictured Dick Cheney type
guy saying something like that.

1629
01:43:59,120 --> 01:44:01,550
What the fuck do I know?
Basically,

1630
01:44:01,551 --> 01:44:04,700
I don't know what your problem is in
this email. Okay. You dated a girl,

1631
01:44:05,030 --> 01:44:08,770
she started playing mind games with you
and all it was was after two months you

1632
01:44:08,771 --> 01:44:13,100
were like, fuck this, pack up your
shit and get out of my life. Um,

1633
01:44:13,850 --> 01:44:15,650
so be one thing,

1634
01:44:15,651 --> 01:44:18,500
if he was still in the relationship than
I would say that you have problems but

1635
01:44:18,501 --> 01:44:23,270
you don't, you uh, you met a
psycho. So what I would say is, uh,

1636
01:44:25,220 --> 01:44:26,540
I dunno,
just stay singles.

1637
01:44:26,590 --> 01:44:31,250
They single right now and wait till
you find someone who doesn't, uh,

1638
01:44:32,600 --> 01:44:33,560
try to mind.
Fuck you.

1639
01:44:33,561 --> 01:44:37,610
The problem is you sound like a
younger guy and the problem is,

1640
01:44:37,640 --> 01:44:41,960
is what you're learning is
that the crazy girls, they,

1641
01:44:42,140 --> 01:44:45,670
they're really down for anything
when it comes to sex. And, uh,

1642
01:44:45,680 --> 01:44:50,180
that's really hard to
resist in your 20s. So, uh,

1643
01:44:50,900 --> 01:44:54,530
what I would say is in the future is
when you meet a girl like that is not to

1644
01:44:54,531 --> 01:44:58,640
get involved in a fucking
relationship, but, uh, you know,

1645
01:45:00,440 --> 01:45:01,700
Bang them and you know,

1646
01:45:01,701 --> 01:45:04,910
get your stories out because it will
prevent you from having a midlife crisis

1647
01:45:04,911 --> 01:45:08,300
later on in life. Am My helping
you out? I don't know. I mean,

1648
01:45:08,780 --> 01:45:11,630
I'm kind of giving you shit
here, but I'm also a, I'm trying,

1649
01:45:11,631 --> 01:45:14,900
you know what I'm really doing right here
is you're basically bearing the brunt

1650
01:45:14,901 --> 01:45:17,480
of the fact that I've trashed women
so much in the last 10 minutes.

1651
01:45:17,481 --> 01:45:21,620
I have to try to seem like I'm balanced
here and that I don't understand exactly

1652
01:45:21,621 --> 01:45:26,600
what the fuck you're saying. Um,
but I think, I think you're fine.

1653
01:45:27,500 --> 01:45:30,890
She tried to play that mind game with
you. You didn't lose your shit, you said,

1654
01:45:30,920 --> 01:45:33,020
according to you anyways, just
send them fine. You went in,

1655
01:45:33,150 --> 01:45:36,620
you rubbed one out your banker for two
fucking months and one day you're like,

1656
01:45:36,621 --> 01:45:40,670
what am I doing? And you just said, yeah,
pack up. You shouldn't get outta here. So,

1657
01:45:41,630 --> 01:45:42,650
uh,
I would not,

1658
01:45:43,460 --> 01:45:47,780
this woman is not a good example of a,

1659
01:45:47,781 --> 01:45:50,210
of a good woman. All
right? So don't try to,

1660
01:45:50,240 --> 01:45:52,220
don't act like all women are like this.

1661
01:45:52,250 --> 01:45:56,990
Like I have for a long time and like
I do every week on my podcast just for

1662
01:45:56,991 --> 01:45:59,570
comedic purposes.
I like trash in them.

1663
01:45:59,990 --> 01:46:04,640
It's fun and it's childish,
but they're not all like that.

1664
01:46:04,670 --> 01:46:09,350
If you're young, there's still great girls
out there. Go out and go find them and,

1665
01:46:09,830 --> 01:46:14,600
uh, I don't know. Make a list
of what you're looking for.

1666
01:46:14,660 --> 01:46:16,460
And then you also have to
realize, dude, that you know,

1667
01:46:16,461 --> 01:46:21,050
everybody's going to come with their
faults like you with your temper. Um,

1668
01:46:21,170 --> 01:46:24,470
you know, you've got your faults, so
there you go. Did they help you out?

1669
01:46:24,500 --> 01:46:25,420
I probably didn't.

1670
01:46:25,480 --> 01:46:28,490
It probably didn't help that I fucking
paraphrased your fucking email.

1671
01:46:28,760 --> 01:46:33,380
And then I also, uh, lost
the batteries here in my,

1672
01:46:33,830 --> 01:46:36,810
uh, am I God damn recorder. Uh,

1673
01:46:36,890 --> 01:46:38,900
am I going to end with
that with a whimper?

1674
01:46:39,920 --> 01:46:44,060
You guys one of your quick revenge
story. Sure. We all do a hey bill.

1675
01:46:44,061 --> 01:46:45,260
I'm not much for shit jokes,

1676
01:46:45,261 --> 01:46:48,380
but I thought you might be interested in
one of my revenge stories when I was in

1677
01:46:48,381 --> 01:46:52,170
high school there, this kid who was
always giving me and my friend Shit.

1678
01:46:52,440 --> 01:46:55,740
So we decided, uh, no wait, I just read
that wrong. When I was in high school,

1679
01:46:55,741 --> 01:46:59,700
there was a kid who was always
giving my friend and I shit.

1680
01:47:00,030 --> 01:47:03,510
So we decided we'd give
him some look at that.

1681
01:47:03,540 --> 01:47:08,400
What a well worded shit joke. It's got
a little foreshadowing going on there.

1682
01:47:08,550 --> 01:47:09,750
Perfect amount of words.

1683
01:47:10,320 --> 01:47:13,170
If the reader was a little bit better
than what are going to laugh. So anyways,

1684
01:47:13,171 --> 01:47:14,430
he goes,
ah,

1685
01:47:14,450 --> 01:47:18,720
he was the guy who would not people's
lunch trays out of their hands in high

1686
01:47:18,721 --> 01:47:20,790
school and high five
his buddies and laugh.

1687
01:47:20,820 --> 01:47:25,110
So he's basically like that kid who
was in the Cobra Kai in the karate kid,

1688
01:47:26,190 --> 01:47:28,800
whatever that actor's name is,
who played that dude all the time.

1689
01:47:29,220 --> 01:47:33,720
He was in back to school. He was the
Goto Dick and all those movies. Anyways,

1690
01:47:33,721 --> 01:47:35,630
he was the guy who would knock a link.

1691
01:47:36,960 --> 01:47:40,350
[inaudible] my friend and I were
known as the punk or skater kids,

1692
01:47:40,351 --> 01:47:43,980
which I always thought was funny since
we were just normal kids who happen to

1693
01:47:43,981 --> 01:47:48,420
play music and would occasionally
skateboard for transportation. Yeah.

1694
01:47:48,540 --> 01:47:53,070
Punk skater kids. You think that
that kid was just a football player?

1695
01:47:53,550 --> 01:47:58,320
I'm sure he, maybe he liked cooking also.
You didn't watch the breakfast club.

1696
01:47:58,321 --> 01:48:02,900
We stereotype at that age. Um, and he,
he's a Witcher, blah, blah, blah blah.

1697
01:48:02,970 --> 01:48:04,650
Or kids [inaudible] sorry,

1698
01:48:04,710 --> 01:48:09,710
I keep losing my place here or any ways
this asshole who will call Kent would

1699
01:48:10,831 --> 01:48:14,880
try and start fight what fights with us
in halls and would have his minions come

1700
01:48:14,881 --> 01:48:17,970
up and push us from behind and runaway.
Nice to see.

1701
01:48:17,971 --> 01:48:20,280
Nothing has changed in high school.
Um,

1702
01:48:20,310 --> 01:48:23,610
we honestly didn't give a shit about
those kids so we can more ignored them.

1703
01:48:23,611 --> 01:48:26,640
Most of the time. Um, subutex,

1704
01:48:26,670 --> 01:48:30,000
they were bigger than us and we didn't
feel like getting our asses kicked. Um,

1705
01:48:30,230 --> 01:48:34,620
but finally the day came, Ken came up,
this is where they can't take it no more.

1706
01:48:34,650 --> 01:48:37,320
I like this. Finally, the day came up,

1707
01:48:37,890 --> 01:48:39,780
can't came up to my
friend in the parking lot,

1708
01:48:40,380 --> 01:48:42,240
grabbed a skateboard out of his hand,

1709
01:48:42,540 --> 01:48:46,440
throw it on the ground and stuck his
chin out saying, hit me. Come on,

1710
01:48:46,441 --> 01:48:48,330
you fucking faggot.
Hit me.

1711
01:48:51,780 --> 01:48:56,250
Was this kid real? Was he reading from
a bed coming of age script? Mind you,

1712
01:48:56,251 --> 01:49:00,740
my friend has never said a fucking word
to this prick. So I go, yeah, go ahead.

1713
01:49:00,780 --> 01:49:04,720
Fucking Arum Kent then says to me,
uh,

1714
01:49:04,770 --> 01:49:09,750
you don't even want to fucking try.
I'll fucking kick your punk ass.

1715
01:49:10,230 --> 01:49:13,440
Jesus. This is right out
of the bully handbook. Uh,

1716
01:49:13,441 --> 01:49:16,110
but me being about my
friend being a smart ass,

1717
01:49:16,111 --> 01:49:21,111
said my punk ass or my skys
and p proceeded to scad,

1718
01:49:21,661 --> 01:49:26,370
dance around Kent. It was one of
the funniest things I've ever seen.

1719
01:49:28,170 --> 01:49:29,870
I don't know what scar dancing is.

1720
01:49:29,871 --> 01:49:33,280
Is that the move in that moment and is it,

1721
01:49:33,300 --> 01:49:36,840
are you to get to and reinvent the
personal computer? Is this one,

1722
01:49:36,870 --> 01:49:40,530
this is what I see in your future.
Anyways, let's continue on with this.

1723
01:49:40,531 --> 01:49:44,760
Here are that night we went to Taco bell
to get some food and decided to take

1724
01:49:44,761 --> 01:49:48,970
revenge. We each took our to go
bags the bathroom and looked.

1725
01:49:49,540 --> 01:49:52,960
It took one of the most
satisfying shits of our lives.

1726
01:49:53,890 --> 01:49:57,730
So you guys sitting in different stalls
snickering at the son of your own shit

1727
01:49:57,731 --> 01:50:01,900
hitting a plastic bag. There's
a lot of layers to this. Uh,

1728
01:50:02,890 --> 01:50:06,640
this movie here, it's got the classic
bully. It's got the two nerds.

1729
01:50:07,090 --> 01:50:12,010
They're bonding, sort of got a scat
theme to it with a little scar dancing.

1730
01:50:13,330 --> 01:50:15,040
You know, if you, if
you write a treatment,

1731
01:50:15,041 --> 01:50:18,100
you could probably get it made in
this weird economy out here and now in

1732
01:50:18,101 --> 01:50:20,860
Hollywood are let's plow
to get a plow ahead.

1733
01:50:20,861 --> 01:50:23,980
Here are we put the bags of
shit in the trunk of my car.

1734
01:50:23,981 --> 01:50:28,160
Please tell me you double bagged and drove
over to, and at this point, this kid,

1735
01:50:28,161 --> 01:50:31,570
so into the story,
he actually writes this kid's real name,

1736
01:50:32,260 --> 01:50:36,070
but we'll still call him
Kent. Uh, we emptied a,

1737
01:50:36,071 --> 01:50:40,270
emptied the bags of shit into his mailbox
while trying not to throw up from the

1738
01:50:40,271 --> 01:50:41,104
smell.

1739
01:50:41,110 --> 01:50:46,110
The combination of our shit almost made
a slurry and was leaking out of the

1740
01:50:46,481 --> 01:50:49,480
sides of the mailbox.
Jesus Christ.

1741
01:50:50,320 --> 01:50:53,380
We sped out of the neighborhood but didn't
get too far because we both laughing

1742
01:50:53,381 --> 01:50:55,840
so fucking hard.
I can barely keep the vehicle on the road.

1743
01:50:56,140 --> 01:51:00,160
The next week at school I heard some kids
talking about what happened to Kent's

1744
01:51:00,161 --> 01:51:03,730
mailbox. I couldn't help but smile
every time someone mentioned it.

1745
01:51:04,750 --> 01:51:08,690
And from then on,
Ken's new nickname at school was shitbox.

1746
01:51:09,910 --> 01:51:13,750
Ah, am I hope you enjoyed
my disgusting story. But uh,

1747
01:51:13,751 --> 01:51:17,560
I'm not usually one for revenge or shit.
Jokes with this asshole deserved it.

1748
01:51:17,920 --> 01:51:21,450
I love the podcasts. All right,
well there you go. That's one way.

1749
01:51:21,580 --> 01:51:23,950
And once he supposed to do,
we can't kick the shit out of him.

1750
01:51:23,950 --> 01:51:28,810
So he shits in a bag with his friend
and they dump it into his mailbox.

1751
01:51:30,060 --> 01:51:34,630
Ah, there you go. People
were going to end on that.

1752
01:51:35,590 --> 01:51:40,030
We're going to end on that.
The dungeons and dragons revenge story.

1753
01:51:42,370 --> 01:51:43,630
Um, I mean, well, what happened?

1754
01:51:43,631 --> 01:51:46,150
Did you ever find out why
that is unsatisfying to me?

1755
01:51:46,151 --> 01:51:51,151
Did can't go out there in reaching for
his bully magazine and got a handful of

1756
01:51:51,971 --> 01:51:55,990
our combined shit from the
two of you or it is poor mom.

1757
01:51:57,250 --> 01:52:00,020
You know, where to carry that
bully around in is in her,

1758
01:52:00,030 --> 01:52:04,570
in her womb for nine months.
I Dunno.

1759
01:52:04,600 --> 01:52:07,390
I Dunno what to do with it.
I got all thrown off with my fucking,

1760
01:52:08,830 --> 01:52:13,330
the whole thing out of the goddamn tape
recorded crapping out on me. Anyways,

1761
01:52:13,331 --> 01:52:17,260
