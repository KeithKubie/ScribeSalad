TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello,
I'm Timothy Jordan

for The Developer
Show, and this is

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.961
your weekly update on
the coolest developer

00:00:05.961 --> 00:00:07.560
news from Google.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.810
Flutter Live happened
last week in London.

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.540
Flutter 1.0 was announced,
along with some partner

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.060
tools for vector animations
and continuous integration

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:16.057
and delivery.

00:00:16.057 --> 00:00:17.640
Check out the links
in the description

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.580
below for our top five

and the video playlist.

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:26.070
AR Core 1.6 is now available
with further improvements

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.950
to help you build more
realistic and compelling

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:31.260
augmented reality experiences.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.900
Updates include better
plane boundary tracking

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.440
and several lighting
improvements in scene form.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.320
The Android Developer
Fundamentals and Android

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.780
Advanced courses are now
available as a series

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:43.800
of code labs.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.695
The links are on the post.

00:00:45.695 --> 00:00:47.820
I have a couple of drive
updates to share with you.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.850
First, a new version of the
Google Drive activity API

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.760
is now available within
expanded data model.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.940
The V1 will be shut down
on December 31 of 2019

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.190
and a migration
guide is on the post.

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.050
Also the team will
be focusing solely

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.870
on expanding the
functionality for the drive

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.500
REST API, which means the
Android API will be retired

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.080
on December 6 of 2019.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.270
A migration guide for
this is also available

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.670
and linked from its post.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.110
The Cloud Security
Command Center

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.480
provides organization
level visibility

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.910
into assets,
vulnerabilities, and threats,

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:23.820
and it's now available in beta.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.040
This release comes with
some new features, including

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.670
expanded coverage across GCP
services, expanded client

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.360
libraries, and more.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.110
Details and screenshots
are on the post.

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.870
We recently introduced a
new device commands feature

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.230
for our Cloud IoT
Core managed service,

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.200
which provides high
frequency, low latency,

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.400
ephemeral messaging between
the cloud and IoT devices.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.150
Details and links to get
started are on the post.

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.250
Last week, Montreal
hosted the biggest machine

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.860
learning conference of the
year, the annual conference

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.642
on neural information
processing systems.

00:01:58.642 --> 00:01:59.850
Don't worry if you missed it.

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.080
All the work we presented
there is linked from this post.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.440
TF ranking is a scalable
TensorFlow-based library

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.850
for learning to rank.

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.530
It provides a unified
framework that

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.710
includes a suite of state of the
art learning to rank algorithms

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.890
and supports pairwise or
listwise lost functions,

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.490
multi-item scoring, ranking
metric optimization,

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.100
and unbiased learning to rank.

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.230
More information and a
link to the GitHub repo

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.364
are on the post linked

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.500
Thanks for watching and
we'll see you next week.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.640
Vacations sound nice.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.680
You know what vacations
usually mean to me?

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.650
Working on another work project
I haven't gotten to in a while.
