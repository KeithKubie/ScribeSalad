peer review is not a simple thing

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310
peer review is not a simple thing
 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.460
peer review is not a simple thing
because humans do it and so whenever

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470
because humans do it and so whenever
 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:08.870
because humans do it and so whenever
there's humans that will be bias

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880
there's humans that will be bias
 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.749
there's humans that will be bias
introduced relationships get complicated

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759
introduced relationships get complicated
 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.249
introduced relationships get complicated
with regard to peer review we have a

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259
with regard to peer review we have a
 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.650
with regard to peer review we have a
fantasy the peer review will be totally

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660
fantasy the peer review will be totally
 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.210
fantasy the peer review will be totally
anonymous on both ends you won't know

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220
anonymous on both ends you won't know
 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.099
anonymous on both ends you won't know
who the person you're reviewing is and

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109
who the person you're reviewing is and
 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.230
who the person you're reviewing is and
they won't know who you are and it will

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240
they won't know who you are and it will
 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.570
they won't know who you are and it will
all be blind but in reality people

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580
all be blind but in reality people
 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.279
all be blind but in reality people
figure out in peer review who is who and

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:27.289
figure out in peer review who is who and
 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:29.839
figure out in peer review who is who and
biases do get introduced but that said

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849
biases do get introduced but that said
 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.150
biases do get introduced but that said
the ideal of peer review is a really

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160
the ideal of peer review is a really
 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.620
the ideal of peer review is a really
important one and we can sort of

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630
important one and we can sort of
 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.990
important one and we can sort of
approach it and that's the idea that we

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000
approach it and that's the idea that we
 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.880
approach it and that's the idea that we
have people who are qualified judging

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890
have people who are qualified judging
 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.920
have people who are qualified judging
each other's work it allows us to

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930
each other's work it allows us to
 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.750
each other's work it allows us to
essentially crowdsource knowledge and to

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760
essentially crowdsource knowledge and to
 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.580
essentially crowdsource knowledge and to
have an opportunity where blind spots

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590
have an opportunity where blind spots
 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.100
have an opportunity where blind spots
are picked off where errors are picked

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110
are picked off where errors are picked
 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.410
are picked off where errors are picked
up and where we can make work better so

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420
up and where we can make work better so
 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.150
up and where we can make work better so
it's a essentially a way to crowdsource

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160
it's a essentially a way to crowdsource
 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.400
it's a essentially a way to crowdsource
knowledge I want to point out by the way

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410
knowledge I want to point out by the way
 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.130
knowledge I want to point out by the way
that peer review is historically really

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140
that peer review is historically really
 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.560
that peer review is historically really
interesting it came out of the

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570
interesting it came out of the
 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.660
interesting it came out of the
Enlightenment period so this was the

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670
Enlightenment period so this was the
 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.240
Enlightenment period so this was the
period when thinkers were beginning to

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250
period when thinkers were beginning to
 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.250
period when thinkers were beginning to
really appreciate the idea that humans

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260
really appreciate the idea that humans
 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.860
really appreciate the idea that humans
together could know more and what's

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:06.870
together could know more and what's
 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.200
together could know more and what's
fascinating is that democracy and

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210
fascinating is that democracy and
 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.360
fascinating is that democracy and
science grew up together and they both

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:11.370
science grew up together and they both
 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.450
science grew up together and they both
use peer review so science uses peer

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460
use peer review so science uses peer
 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.880
use peer review so science uses peer
review because scientific ideas are put

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890
review because scientific ideas are put
 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.980
review because scientific ideas are put
forth and then scientists are qualified

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990
forth and then scientists are qualified
 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.320
forth and then scientists are qualified
to do so judge that work and in

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330
to do so judge that work and in
 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.570
to do so judge that work and in
democracy peer review is used in things

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580
democracy peer review is used in things
 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.490
democracy peer review is used in things
like voting systems so when we do voting

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500
like voting systems so when we do voting
 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.700
like voting systems so when we do voting
that's a peer review form when we do

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710
that's a peer review form when we do
 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.710
that's a peer review form when we do
judging of criminal or non criminal acts

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720
judging of criminal or non criminal acts
 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.870
judging of criminal or non criminal acts
in courts that's a form of peer review

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880
in courts that's a form of peer review
 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.149
in courts that's a form of peer review
and we have a jury and so it's not a

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159
and we have a jury and so it's not a
 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.950
and we have a jury and so it's not a
coincidence because what was happening

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960
coincidence because what was happening
 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.990
coincidence because what was happening
was the thinkers of the Enlightenment

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000
was the thinkers of the Enlightenment
 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.940
was the thinkers of the Enlightenment
were beginning to figure out that more

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950
were beginning to figure out that more
 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.380
were beginning to figure out that more
people looking at a problem could get

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390
people looking at a problem could get
 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.850
people looking at a problem could get
you better knowledge before the

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860
you better knowledge before the
 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.620
you better knowledge before the
Enlightenment the concept was knowledge

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630
Enlightenment the concept was knowledge
 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.149
Enlightenment the concept was knowledge
came from above they came from the

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159
came from above they came from the
 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.730
came from above they came from the
church from the state from God it came

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740
church from the state from God it came
 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.550
church from the state from God it came
from an external higher authority but

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560
from an external higher authority but
 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.680
from an external higher authority but
the real revelation of the Enlightenment

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690
the real revelation of the Enlightenment
 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.120
the real revelation of the Enlightenment
was the idea that people could do this

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130
was the idea that people could do this
 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.890
was the idea that people could do this
themselves they didn't have to rely on

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:57.900
themselves they didn't have to rely on
 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.800
themselves they didn't have to rely on
the church the state God an external

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810
the church the state God an external
 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:01.910
the church the state God an external
Authority they could do it themselves

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920
Authority they could do it themselves
 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.670
Authority they could do it themselves
and so they began to have the idea that

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680
and so they began to have the idea that
 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.080
and so they began to have the idea that
they would reject the king and they

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090
they would reject the king and they
 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.700
they would reject the king and they
would essentially reject the teachings

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710
would essentially reject the teachings
 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.169
would essentially reject the teachings
of the church and they would reject the

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179
of the church and they would reject the
 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.540
of the church and they would reject the
state being run by the king that they

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550
state being run by the king that they
 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.490
state being run by the king that they
would take back control of knowledge and

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500
would take back control of knowledge and
 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.230
would take back control of knowledge and
that was true in democracy and in

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240
that was true in democracy and in
 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.620
that was true in democracy and in
science

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630
science
 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.120
science
so it's no coincidence that a lot of the

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130
so it's no coincidence that a lot of the
 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.460
so it's no coincidence that a lot of the
founding fathers were science geeks they

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470
founding fathers were science geeks they
 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.230
founding fathers were science geeks they
were thinking about crowdsourcing it's

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240
were thinking about crowdsourcing it's
 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.030
were thinking about crowdsourcing it's
what we call crowdsourcing there are

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040
what we call crowdsourcing there are
 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.800
what we call crowdsourcing there are
more checks and balances on bad

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810
more checks and balances on bad
 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.750
more checks and balances on bad
knowledge going forward so there's

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760
knowledge going forward so there's
 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.520
knowledge going forward so there's
accountability at some level right when

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530
accountability at some level right when
 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.290
accountability at some level right when
you you're doing peer review the editor

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300
you you're doing peer review the editor
 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.610
you you're doing peer review the editor
at least knows who you are

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620
at least knows who you are
 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.350
at least knows who you are
when you're doing voting theoretically

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360
when you're doing voting theoretically
 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.400
when you're doing voting theoretically
you're not allowed to vote more than

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410
you're not allowed to vote more than
 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.920
you're not allowed to vote more than
once when you're on a jury you've got a

once when you're on a jury you've got a
 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.980
once when you're on a jury you've got a
judge keeping track of whether or not

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990
judge keeping track of whether or not
 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:41.090
judge keeping track of whether or not
information should be admissible in

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100
information should be admissible in
 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.680
information should be admissible in
court whether it's fair to admit it in

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690
court whether it's fair to admit it in
 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.830
court whether it's fair to admit it in
court the internet is crowdsourcing gone

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840
court the internet is crowdsourcing gone
 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.530
court the internet is crowdsourcing gone
wild it has no limits on it and so you

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540
wild it has no limits on it and so you
 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.840
wild it has no limits on it and so you
can have things like BOTS like things

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850
can have things like BOTS like things
 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.640
can have things like BOTS like things
until it actually is noticed by real

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650
until it actually is noticed by real
 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.650
until it actually is noticed by real
human beings you can have situations

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660
human beings you can have situations
 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.930
human beings you can have situations
where something looks incredibly real

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940
where something looks incredibly real
 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.330
where something looks incredibly real
but it's not real and it will take off

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340
but it's not real and it will take off
 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.520
but it's not real and it will take off
much faster than we can stop it

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530
much faster than we can stop it
 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.550
much faster than we can stop it
so the Internet really is a beautiful

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560
so the Internet really is a beautiful
 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.410
so the Internet really is a beautiful
thing in many ways it allows people to

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420
thing in many ways it allows people to
 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.180
thing in many ways it allows people to
find each other who never could have

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190
find each other who never could have
 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.890
find each other who never could have
found each other before for example

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900
found each other before for example
 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.540
found each other before for example
people with very unusual medical

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550
people with very unusual medical
 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.400
people with very unusual medical
conditions can find each other people

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410
conditions can find each other people
 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.080
conditions can find each other people
with very unusual interests can find
