00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:10.530
Every year, more and more young actors and
actresses make their mark on Hollywood, but

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.490
a rising Star can always be pushed aside by
an established Hollywood Legend.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.789
Whether Oscar winning, Oscar nominated, or
just a fan favourite, every actor needs to

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:23.180
get their start somewhere - and even the greatest
thespians only have ONE first role.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.740
Some are funny, some are fascinating, but
almost all of them are hard to believe.

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.860
Here are Screenrant's 10 Famous Actors' Movie
Debuts You've Never Seen.

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:31.890
Andrew Lincoln

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.060
Before this Walking Dead Star became famous
as officer Rick Grimes, he was busy making

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.010
movies in his native England.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.100
Fans would have a hard time recognizing the
grizzled actor as the fresh-faced twenty-two

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.079
year old in Boston Kickout (OFG/First Look)
playing the troublemaking best friend of the

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:46.079
movie's hero.

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.730
Boys will be boys, but crashing into a store's
window for fun isn't something Rick would

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.050
approve of.

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:54.239
Bryan Cranston

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.489
In the 70s, no TV stars were more well-known
than the Six Million Dollar Man and the Bionic

00:00:58.489 --> 00:00:59.489
Woman (ABC).

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.360
But when the two were reunited for a TV movie,
it was another actor who took the spotlight.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.480
Twenty years before Breaking Bad made him
a household name, Bryan Cranston appeared

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:11.130
as "Dr. Sheppard," adding a high-profile credit
to an early list of small TV roles including

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.899
Airwolf, CHiPs and Hill Street Blues.

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:14.899
George Clooney

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:19.870
He may be seen as one of the sexiest men alive,
and an award winning actor and director, but

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:21.990
George Clooney came from humble beginnings.

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.719
His role in Return of the Killer Tomatoes
is memorable enough, but Clooney's first film

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:28.890
to hit theatres was another B-Movie:
Return to Horror High (New World Pictures).

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.770
It wasn't too hard to play an actor in a recreation
of a high school killing spree, but the future

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.590
superstar only received an off-screen death.

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:36.859
Tom Hanks

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:41.180
A role on the TV show Bosom Buddies was the
first big break for Tom Hanks, but his first

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.049
acting credit came in the slasher movie He
Knows You're Alone (United Artists/MGM).

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:47.960
Delivering a self-aware speech about society's
obsession with scary movies and rollercoaster

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:48.960
(1:01:53).

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.950
Since the movie was released not long after
the original Halloween became a hit, even

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.679
this brief insight into the horror movie genre
was years ahead of its time.

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:57.679
Brad Pitt

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:01.070
1987's No Man's Land (Orion Pictures) took
a thrilling look at the underworld of luxury

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.999
car theft in California, but it's just as
well-known for featuring Brad Pitt's in one

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:08.229
of his very first appearances in front of
a movie camera - even though audiences weren't

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:09.229
supposed to notice him.

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.210
When the films star's attend a swanky party,
the unmistakable star appears as a waiter

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:18.900
in two shots - unmistakable, thanks to the
incredible mullet that steals the scene.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:19.900
Robert De Niro

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.970
Most movie fans would think that the Raging
Bull's first film role would be one to remember.

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.180
But in reality, it was never even meant to
be seen.

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.010
A single scene from the French film Three
Rooms in Manhattan takes place in a crowded

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.010
New York diner.

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.599
Viewers are meant to watch the two stars,
but it's hard to miss the now famous face

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:40.150
of De Niro in the background, playing a diner
patron in an uncredited role.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.150
Al Pacino

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.390
These days, Al Pacino is known for playing
eccentric figures, in too many award-winning

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:46.650
roles to count.

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.799
But three years before starring as Michael
Corleone in The Godfather, Pacino made a small,

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:53.519
but just as memorable appearance in Me, Natalie
(National General Pictures, now Fox).

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:56.739
Playing a sleazy club patron who forces the
movie's star into a dance.

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:04.510
Who would have guessed his youngest role would
have so much in common with his older ones...?

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:05.510
Tom Cruise

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.239
The long blockbuster career of Tom Cruise
isn't filled with too many supporting roles,

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:12.739
since he gained the spotlight the second he
arrived in Hollywood.

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:15.830
But his very first role isn't one even fans
will remember.

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.849
In the tense teen romance Endless Love (Universal),
Cruise appears as Billy, the hero's friend

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:25.450
- and former attempted arsonist - who gives
him some truly bad advice.

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:31.909
Still, his short scene was all casting agents
needed to make him a megastar.

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:33.069
Tom Hardy

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:37.560
With roles in Christopher Nolan's blockbuster
Inception, as a Batman villain and even Mad

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.379
Max himself, Tom Hardy has taken Hollywood
by storm.

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:44.470
But audiences probably saw him in action before
they realized.

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.409
Hardy started his career by jumping into the
deep end, playing the hard-of-hearing Twombly,

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:50.519
a Delta Force soldier in Black Hawk Down (Columbia
Pictures).

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:53.849
He turned in a strong performance, but mass
audiences wouldn't be able to put his face

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:58.450
to a name for a few years - and a few dozens
of pounds - later.

00:03:58.450 --> 00:03:59.450
Michael Fassbender

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:04.680
Today, there are just as many people who know
Michael Fassbender as the X-Men villain Magneto

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.129
as a serious, award winning dramatic actor.

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:10.840
But the Irish-German actor got his start working
with some of Hollywood's biggest talents in

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.940
the HBO series Band of Brothers.

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.299
These days Fassbender's face can sell movie
tickets all by itself.

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:19.880
But no war buff would have known at the time
that 'Sargent Pat Christenson' would become

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.700
even more well known than most of his castmates.

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.259
