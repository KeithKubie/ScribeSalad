00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:04.740
I think I misused my powers.

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:05.340
Where are we?

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.520
It looks like we're inside somewhere
crazy, but I don't know where, and

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.390
I forgot my phone.

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:12.970
Wait, I have an idea.

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:16.650
I can use the Google Geolocation API
to figure out where I am.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.170
The Geolocation API is useful for
devices or

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.770
machines that don't already have
Geolocation built in natively.

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.150
Devices that run on Unix,
Linux, TinyOS, RIOT or

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.015
other operating systems might have
a need to know their location.

00:00:30.015 --> 00:00:33.075
There are plenty of machines
in the Internet of Things.

00:00:33.075 --> 00:00:36.345
A giant network of internet enabled
devices that qualify for this.

00:00:37.505 --> 00:00:39.485
The Google Geolocation API,

00:00:39.485 --> 00:00:42.585
provides a web service they can
use to get location information.

00:00:43.775 --> 00:00:45.990
They can pass information
from cell towers or

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:51.165
WiFi nodes, to the Geolocation API,
to get back the location and

00:00:51.165 --> 00:00:53.205
accuracy radius on where the device is.

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.440
It's the perfect API for
detecting location indoors, or

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.440
when GPS is weak or unavailable.

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.069
For example, the giant particle
accelerator behind me,

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:08.050
if it's internet enabled,

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.290
could tell me that I'm in France at
the [FOREIGN], also known as CERN.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.305
But I probably shouldn't be here,
so let's move on.

00:01:16.305 --> 00:01:20.104
[SOUND] Oops, my bad.

00:01:20.104 --> 00:01:22.270
Still trying to get
a hang of this thing.

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.615
While I practice, let's take
a look at what we've done so far.

00:01:24.615 --> 00:01:26.444
