&gt;&gt; Judy: Hi, I'm Judy Dixon,
Consumer Relations Officer at NLS.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.560
In this edition of the
BARD Express How-To Series,

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.320
I'm going to cover setting
and changing your preferences.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.610
Using the preferences screen,
BARD Express allows you

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.310
to set the cartridge copy
mode, the display mode,

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:40.320 position:56%
the result message display time, and
your bookshelf directory location.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.670
From the BARD Express Main Menu,
select the Preferences button.

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.480
The first user preference
is cartridge copy mode.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.950
Here you decide if you want
BARD Express to limit the number

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.760
of titles you can put
on a cartridge.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:01.030 position:56%
Check the radio button associated
with the desired cartridge copy mode

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.000 position:56%
by using the up and down arrow keys.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.640

&gt;&gt; Judy: The next user
preference is display mode.

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:24.130
Here you decide if you want to
use the standard display mode,

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.650
where only one item can be selected
to copy, delete, download, etc.,

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.240
at a time, or advanced mode,
where checkboxes are used

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.350
to perform actions on
multiple titles at a time.

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.590
Note that you can use
the hot key control L,

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.640
from any list in the program
to toggle between standard

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.980
and advanced mode, as demonstrated
in some of the other tutorials.
