00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220
into three groups right the
 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.979
into three groups right the
manufacturing working class the people

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989
manufacturing working class the people
 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:14.809
manufacturing working class the people
who do services lower end services you

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819
who do services lower end services you
 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.580
who do services lower end services you
know work weight on you in restaurants

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590
know work weight on you in restaurants
 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:17.839
know work weight on you in restaurants
sell your clothes take care your house

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849
sell your clothes take care your house
 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:19.520
sell your clothes take care your house
and then the creative class the creative

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530
and then the creative class the creative
 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:20.599
and then the creative class the creative
class already accounts for more than

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:20.609
class already accounts for more than
 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:22.759
class already accounts for more than
fifty percent and the other thing just

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769
fifty percent and the other thing just
 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.129
fifty percent and the other thing just
wrote folks watching we've actually

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:25.139
wrote folks watching we've actually
 

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:27.080
wrote folks watching we've actually
tracked the unemployment situation and

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090
tracked the unemployment situation and
 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.180
tracked the unemployment situation and
it's quite devastating in some respect

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190
it's quite devastating in some respect
 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.190
it's quite devastating in some respect
while the overall US unemployment rate

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200
while the overall US unemployment rate
 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.379
while the overall US unemployment rate
is ten percent and and while

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:33.389
is ten percent and and while
 

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:34.759
is ten percent and and while
manufacturing workers have unemployment

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769
manufacturing workers have unemployment
 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:36.740
manufacturing workers have unemployment
rates fifteen percent and in some parts

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750
rates fifteen percent and in some parts
 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.030
rates fifteen percent and in some parts
like extraction and construction

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040
like extraction and construction
 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.520
like extraction and construction
twenty-five percent the creative class

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530
twenty-five percent the creative class
 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.860
twenty-five percent the creative class
is about five percent so the creative

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870
is about five percent so the creative
 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.420
is about five percent so the creative
class has never seen right great swings

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430
class has never seen right great swings
 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:45.860
class has never seen right great swings
I mean that's up from do percent before

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870
I mean that's up from do percent before
 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.809
I mean that's up from do percent before
it's never seen these great volatility

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819
it's never seen these great volatility
 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:49.370
it's never seen these great volatility
and slings that really devastate

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380
and slings that really devastate
 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.110
and slings that really devastate
manufacturing and and so I think as we

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120
manufacturing and and so I think as we
 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.640
manufacturing and and so I think as we
come out of this crisis we're going to

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650
come out of this crisis we're going to
 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.170
come out of this crisis we're going to
gency that this group is more stable

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180
gency that this group is more stable
 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.000
gency that this group is more stable
this group of jobs is more stable and

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010
this group of jobs is more stable and
 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.069
this group of jobs is more stable and
they're going to grow again so let's key

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079
they're going to grow again so let's key
 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:03:59.900
they're going to grow again so let's key
off that you have an idea that you've

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910
off that you have an idea that you've
 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.650
off that you have an idea that you've
called the creative economic revolution

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660
called the creative economic revolution
 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.449
called the creative economic revolution
and that really ties in to this notion

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459
and that really ties in to this notion
 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:06.800
and that really ties in to this notion
of the you know this class that is

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810
of the you know this class that is
 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.449
of the you know this class that is
helping to drive prosperity what is

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459
helping to drive prosperity what is
 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:10.580
helping to drive prosperity what is
actually happening to the economy as you

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590
actually happening to the economy as you
 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.949
actually happening to the economy as you
see it that is enabling the the rise of

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959
see it that is enabling the the rise of
 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:14.420
see it that is enabling the the rise of
this class of people actually think

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430
this class of people actually think
 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.849
this class of people actually think
behind the crisis is the crisis is kind

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859
behind the crisis is the crisis is kind
 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:18.110
behind the crisis is the crisis is kind
of the inflection point or the

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120
of the inflection point or the
 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.029
of the inflection point or the
transformation point you know if you

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:20.039
transformation point you know if you
 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:22.129
transformation point you know if you
look back at the two previous crises and

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:22.139
look back at the two previous crises and
 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:24.200
look back at the two previous crises and
and I'm actually writing a book on this

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210
and I'm actually writing a book on this
 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:25.670
and I'm actually writing a book on this
it's called the great reset hopefully

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680
it's called the great reset hopefully
 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:26.899
it's called the great reset hopefully
you'll invite me back to talk about how

00:04:26.899 --> 00:04:26.909
you'll invite me back to talk about how
 

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:28.040
you'll invite me back to talk about how
when it comes out it

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050
when it comes out it
 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.080
when it comes out it
I met but if you look back on previous

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090
I met but if you look back on previous
 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:31.399
I met but if you look back on previous
crises they've always been associated

00:04:31.399 --> 00:04:31.409
crises they've always been associated
 

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:33.950
crises they've always been associated
with the rise of new economic systems so

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960
with the rise of new economic systems so
 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.050
with the rise of new economic systems so
the crisis is 1873 was associated with

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060
the crisis is 1873 was associated with
 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.249
the crisis is 1873 was associated with
the rise of you know the first

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:37.259
the rise of you know the first
 

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:38.899
the rise of you know the first
Industrial Revolution and it gave rise

00:04:38.899 --> 00:04:38.909
Industrial Revolution and it gave rise
 

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:41.450
Industrial Revolution and it gave rise
to the second the crisis in the 1930s

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460
to the second the crisis in the 1930s
 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:42.680
to the second the crisis in the 1930s
was the rise of the Second Industrial

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690
was the rise of the Second Industrial
 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.659
was the rise of the Second Industrial
Revolution in these big steel companies

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:44.669
Revolution in these big steel companies
 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:46.939
Revolution in these big steel companies
and auto companies and then we figured

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:46.949
and auto companies and then we figured
 

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:48.469
and auto companies and then we figured
out how to make the society work this is

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:48.479
out how to make the society work this is
 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:49.939
out how to make the society work this is
really a crisis not just the financial

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:49.949
really a crisis not just the financial
 

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:52.760
really a crisis not just the financial
markets and wanted spending and too much

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770
markets and wanted spending and too much
 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.860
markets and wanted spending and too much
credit it's a tectonic crisis that's

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870
credit it's a tectonic crisis that's
 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.300
credit it's a tectonic crisis that's
associated with the rise of a new

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310
associated with the rise of a new
 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.520
associated with the rise of a new
economic order and what we were doing is

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530
economic order and what we were doing is
 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.260
economic order and what we were doing is
because we didn't know how to invest in

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270
because we didn't know how to invest in
 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:01.879
because we didn't know how to invest in
it we were speculating like while and

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:01.889
it we were speculating like while and
 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:03.800
it we were speculating like while and
money was flowing into real estate so

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810
money was flowing into real estate so
 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.480
money was flowing into real estate so
the creative economic revolution has

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490
the creative economic revolution has
 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.180
the creative economic revolution has
really been going on in my view since

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190
really been going on in my view since
 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.670
really been going on in my view since
the 60s and and it's funny because I

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680
the 60s and and it's funny because I
 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.290
the 60s and and it's funny because I
went back and looked at this and and

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300
went back and looked at this and and
 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.149
went back and looked at this and and
folks might not know this but what I

00:05:14.149 --> 00:05:14.159
folks might not know this but what I
 

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:15.680
folks might not know this but what I
really wanted to be in life was a guitar

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690
really wanted to be in life was a guitar
 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:19.159
really wanted to be in life was a guitar
player so all my childhood I spent

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:19.169
player so all my childhood I spent
 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:21.830
player so all my childhood I spent
playing guitar and and trying to sound

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840
playing guitar and and trying to sound
 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.990
playing guitar and and trying to sound
like Jimi Hendrix or Jeff Bacharach with

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000
like Jimi Hendrix or Jeff Bacharach with
 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.290
like Jimi Hendrix or Jeff Bacharach with
some degree of non success but in the

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.300
some degree of non success but in the
 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.749
some degree of non success but in the
60s we saw all of this creative

00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:29.759
60s we saw all of this creative
 

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:31.640
60s we saw all of this creative
revolution weather and even before that

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:31.650
revolution weather and even before that
 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:35.080
revolution weather and even before that
jazz and the 54 but the beat revolution

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:35.090
jazz and the 54 but the beat revolution
 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:37.850
jazz and the 54 but the beat revolution
and then the sixties thing happening in

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:37.860
and then the sixties thing happening in
 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.860
and then the sixties thing happening in

book on unworn the velvet underground so
 

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:44.899
book on unworn the velvet underground so
you know you can see this stuff building

00:05:44.899 --> 00:05:44.909
you know you can see this stuff building
 

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:47.809
you know you can see this stuff building
up as people are tired of and kind of

00:05:47.809 --> 00:05:47.819
up as people are tired of and kind of
 

00:05:47.819 --> 00:05:49.899
up as people are tired of and kind of
blanching at the strictures of the old

00:05:49.899 --> 00:05:49.909
blanching at the strictures of the old
 

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:52.459
blanching at the strictures of the old
organization man society and its kind of

you know it's kind of our world
fascinated by madman I think you know

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440
fascinated by madman I think you know
 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.439
fascinated by madman I think you know
you see this transformation this kind of

00:05:57.439 --> 00:05:57.449
you see this transformation this kind of
 

00:05:57.449 --> 00:05:59.240
you see this transformation this kind of
pivot point right running through as

00:05:59.240 --> 00:05:59.250
pivot point right running through as
 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:01.760
pivot point right running through as
madmen develops and this creative thing

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:01.770
madmen develops and this creative thing
 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:03.230
madmen develops and this creative thing
emerging but people don't know what to

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.240
emerging but people don't know what to
 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.969
emerging but people don't know what to
do and so the one way I kind of view the

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:04.979
do and so the one way I kind of view the
 

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:07.070
do and so the one way I kind of view the
1960s is this giant temper tantrum right

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.080
1960s is this giant temper tantrum right
 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:08.540
1960s is this giant temper tantrum right
creative people just saying I'm not

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:08.550
creative people just saying I'm not
 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:09.769
