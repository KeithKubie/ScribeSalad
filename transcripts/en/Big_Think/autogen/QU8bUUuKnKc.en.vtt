well with the dark energy most people do

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210
well with the dark energy most people do
 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.930
well with the dark energy most people do
think that the universe itself will

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940
think that the universe itself will
 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.499
think that the universe itself will
exist indefinitely but the the other

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509
exist indefinitely but the the other
 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:13.940
exist indefinitely but the the other
question is whether or not there can be

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950
question is whether or not there can be
 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.900
question is whether or not there can be
life in the long term future in the

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910
life in the long term future in the
 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.330
life in the long term future in the
standard explanation for that for the

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340
standard explanation for that for the
 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.980
standard explanation for that for the
dark energy Shinsei standard because it

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990
dark energy Shinsei standard because it
 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.660
dark energy Shinsei standard because it
really is a big puzzle but if there's a

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670
really is a big puzzle but if there's a
 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.870
really is a big puzzle but if there's a
vacuum energy that's constant in time it

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880
vacuum energy that's constant in time it
 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.599
vacuum energy that's constant in time it
becomes more and more the driving force

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609
becomes more and more the driving force
 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.240
becomes more and more the driving force
of these of this expansion and causing

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250
of these of this expansion and causing
 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.150
of these of this expansion and causing
ever more acceleration in that picture

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160
ever more acceleration in that picture
 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.760
ever more acceleration in that picture
then life dies out because you bet you

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770
then life dies out because you bet you
 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.500
then life dies out because you bet you
basically it's cotton perhaps

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510
basically it's cotton perhaps
 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.350
basically it's cotton perhaps
counterintuitive but as everything gets

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360
counterintuitive but as everything gets
 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.180
counterintuitive but as everything gets
farther and farther apart you do have

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190
farther and farther apart you do have
 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.310
farther and farther apart you do have
this floor to the temperature of the

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320
this floor to the temperature of the
 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.740
this floor to the temperature of the
universe set by the vacuum energy it's a

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750
universe set by the vacuum energy it's a
 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.980
universe set by the vacuum energy it's a
hulking temperature so as you're you're

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:51.990
hulking temperature so as you're you're
 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.650
hulking temperature so as you're you're
trying to operate and closer and closer

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660
trying to operate and closer and closer
 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.040
trying to operate and closer and closer
to this cut off from this vacuum energy

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050
to this cut off from this vacuum energy
 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.540
to this cut off from this vacuum energy
the any kind of life-form actually

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550
the any kind of life-form actually
 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.380
the any kind of life-form actually
overheats so as I said it just kind of a

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390
overheats so as I said it just kind of a
 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.369
overheats so as I said it just kind of a
counterintuitive but you're you just

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379
counterintuitive but you're you just
 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.969
counterintuitive but you're you just
can't it's something you can't avoid now

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979
can't it's something you can't avoid now
 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.529
can't it's something you can't avoid now
on the other hand what we wrote in our

00:01:09.529 --> 00:01:09.539
on the other hand what we wrote in our
 

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:11.990
on the other hand what we wrote in our
paper is we were saying well but if it's

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000
paper is we were saying well but if it's
 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.940
paper is we were saying well but if it's
not a constant vacuum energy if it is

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950
not a constant vacuum energy if it is
 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.289
not a constant vacuum energy if it is
either time changing so that it's

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299
either time changing so that it's
 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.340
either time changing so that it's
decreasing into the future or that you

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350
decreasing into the future or that you
 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.260
decreasing into the future or that you
have this kind of Cardassian expansion

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270
have this kind of Cardassian expansion
 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.539
have this kind of Cardassian expansion
that I was mentioning in either case

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549
that I was mentioning in either case
 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.639
that I was mentioning in either case
then life could actually continue

00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:28.649
then life could actually continue
 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:31.489
then life could actually continue
because you don't have this floor in the

00:01:31.489 --> 00:01:31.499
because you don't have this floor in the
 

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:34.039
because you don't have this floor in the
temperature in fact instead it's also

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049
temperature in fact instead it's also
 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.929
temperature in fact instead it's also
going down and so you can continue in

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939
going down and so you can continue in
 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.669
going down and so you can continue in
clever ways to have life continue to

00:01:37.669 --> 00:01:37.679
clever ways to have life continue to
 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:40.890
clever ways to have life continue to
exist

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900
 
 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.030
 
no and thought at all yeah something

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.040
no and thought at all yeah something
 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.300
no and thought at all yeah something
really very unpleasant from our point of

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310
really very unpleasant from our point of
 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.330
really very unpleasant from our point of
view so I I have no idea but certainly

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340
view so I I have no idea but certainly
 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.950
view so I I have no idea but certainly
not people not things will get very very

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960
not people not things will get very very
 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.230
not people not things will get very very
spread out and distant and cold and I'm

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240
spread out and distant and cold and I'm
 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.850
spread out and distant and cold and I'm
talking about life in the sense of

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860
talking about life in the sense of
 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.400
talking about life in the sense of
computation being able to continue well

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:02.410
computation being able to continue well
 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.530
computation being able to continue well
if you think about our arm our memories

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540
if you think about our arm our memories
 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.270
if you think about our arm our memories
or our thoughts as a type of computation

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280
or our thoughts as a type of computation
 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.330
or our thoughts as a type of computation
then is there some way you could have a

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340
then is there some way you could have a
 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.160
then is there some way you could have a
molecular cloud just like the kind i was

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170
molecular cloud just like the kind i was
 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.949
molecular cloud just like the kind i was
talking about for the formation of stars

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959
talking about for the formation of stars
 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:18.780
talking about for the formation of stars
or the different pieces of it

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790
or the different pieces of it
 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.500
or the different pieces of it
communicate in some way and so you have

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510
communicate in some way and so you have
 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.820
communicate in some way and so you have
intelligence of a completely different

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830
intelligence of a completely different
 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.370
intelligence of a completely different
type than than what we're then what we

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380
type than than what we're then what we
 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.020
type than than what we're then what we
enjoy so these bodies that we enjoy are

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030
enjoy so these bodies that we enjoy are
 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.690
enjoy so these bodies that we enjoy are
not going to make it
