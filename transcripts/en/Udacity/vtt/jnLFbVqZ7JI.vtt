Remember that one of the most powerful features of graphs is that they allow us

00:00:04.091 --> 00:00:07.590
to calculate x and y values for our equation that we may not have had

00:00:07.602 --> 00:00:11.663
previously. Of course, we can do that with the equation itself, but the graph

00:00:11.675 --> 00:00:15.622
let's us visualize this, not just calculate it. I'd like you to tell me, first

00:00:15.634 --> 00:00:20.659
off, what the y value of this equation is when x equals 4. And then second, when

00:00:20.671 --> 00:00:24.554
we have y equals 9 on our graph, what is x equal to?
