00:00:00.621 --> 00:00:03.121
- In areas where deer roam freely,

00:00:03.121 --> 00:00:05.756
residents must dress to protect themselves

00:00:05.756 --> 00:00:08.994
against deer ticks that
might transmit diseases.

00:00:08.994 --> 00:00:10.701
This actually looks pretty good.

00:00:10.701 --> 00:00:14.522
In areas, and we're talking
about what type of areas?

00:00:14.522 --> 00:00:18.617
Well, these are areas
where deer roam freely.

00:00:18.617 --> 00:00:21.461
We're starting with this relative pronoun.

00:00:21.461 --> 00:00:23.281
This is the type of areas.

00:00:23.281 --> 00:00:25.868
Areas where deer roam freely.

00:00:25.868 --> 00:00:26.770
This looks pretty good.

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:28.684
I like it as is, and so I'll
go with the first choice,

00:00:28.684 --> 00:00:30.741
which is always the as is.

00:00:30.741 --> 00:00:33.462
So no change to the underline.

00:00:33.462 --> 00:00:34.574
But let's just go through the other ones,

00:00:34.574 --> 00:00:36.254
to make sure that they're not as good

00:00:36.254 --> 00:00:38.061
or nowhere near as good.

00:00:38.061 --> 00:00:42.374
So in areas roamed by deer freely,

00:00:42.374 --> 00:00:45.208
residents must dress to
protect themselves, et cetera.

00:00:45.208 --> 00:00:48.984
This one isn't as good, because
this part right over here

00:00:48.984 --> 00:00:50.274
is in the passive voice.

00:00:50.274 --> 00:00:52.213
Instead of saying deer roam freely,

00:00:52.213 --> 00:00:54.813
we're saying roamed by deer freely.

00:00:54.813 --> 00:00:57.301
So it sounds a little bit convoluted.

00:00:57.301 --> 00:00:59.512
Most writers will tell
you the passive voice

00:00:59.512 --> 00:01:02.204
you should avoid it,
unless you really need to,

00:01:02.204 --> 00:01:03.522
unless it really does something special

00:01:03.522 --> 00:01:04.734
to what you're writing.

00:01:04.734 --> 00:01:06.084
And so, I would definitely avoid this

00:01:06.084 --> 00:01:08.627
because of that passive voice.

00:01:08.627 --> 00:01:09.857
So B I'd rule out.

00:01:09.857 --> 00:01:11.061
C has the same problem.

00:01:11.061 --> 00:01:13.661
Areas freely roamed by deer.

00:01:13.661 --> 00:01:14.321
It's a little bit better.

00:01:14.321 --> 00:01:17.160
The adverb freely is
in front of the roamed,

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.273
so they're closer together.

00:01:18.273 --> 00:01:19.400
So how are they roaming?

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.700
They're roaming freely.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.589
But once again, it's in the passive voice.

00:01:22.589 --> 00:01:24.752
Freely roamed by deer,

00:01:24.752 --> 00:01:27.160
instead of just saying
the deer roam freely.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.950
So I don't like that one as well.

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.950
Both of these are in the passive voice,

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.460
which in general you should avoid.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.659
Areas in which there are
deer that roam freely.

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:44.026
So the in which part is okay.

00:01:44.026 --> 00:01:49.015
You could replace a
where with an in which,

00:01:49.015 --> 00:01:52.871
where in this case the which
is the relative pronoun,

00:01:52.871 --> 00:01:54.986
and we put a preposition
here to talk about,

00:01:54.986 --> 00:01:56.343
well, how do we relate to the area?

00:01:56.343 --> 00:01:57.540
Are we doing it on it?

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.286
Are we doing it in it?

00:01:58.286 --> 00:01:58.872
Where are the deer?

00:01:58.872 --> 00:02:00.238
Well, the deer are in it.

00:02:00.238 --> 00:02:01.580
They're in which.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.880
So, areas in which deer roam freely.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.943
So you could say in areas
in which deer roam freely.

00:02:06.943 --> 00:02:10.040
The problem I have with
this one is this part.

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.573
There are deer that roam freely.

00:02:11.573 --> 00:02:14.100
There are deer that roam
freely is much longer than

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.680
deer roam freely, unnecessarily
long, unnecessarily wordy.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.080
And so, if you can get it across

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.240
in a nice clean way, you should.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.641
And so, I would rule this one out,

00:02:22.641 --> 00:02:24.300
just because it's wordier

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.807
and a little bit more
complex than it needs to

00:02:26.807 --> 00:02:30.760
relative to our original clause here.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.540
Areas which deer roam free.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.536
So the problem here is we have
the relative pronoun which,

00:02:38.536 --> 00:02:40.420
but we're not saying how do we relate.

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:44.168
How do we relate to those
areas that we're referring to?

00:02:44.168 --> 00:02:47.520
In particular, how do
the deer relate to them?

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.628
Well, the deer are in them.

00:02:48.628 --> 00:02:50.204
You need to put that in which.

00:02:50.204 --> 00:02:52.565
This needs an in right over here.

00:02:52.565 --> 00:02:56.847
Without the in, this isn't
right really, grammatically.

00:02:56.847 --> 00:02:59.647
Areas which deer roam free.

00:02:59.647 --> 00:03:01.967
No, the deer are in the area.

00:03:01.967 --> 00:03:04.644
So I'd cross that one out as well.
