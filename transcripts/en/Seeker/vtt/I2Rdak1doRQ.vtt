Hey placebos, Julian here for a DNews Short!

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:12.260
The placebo effect was first described in
1572, by a French philosopher named Michel

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:13.809
de Montaigne.

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:17.490
He wrote “there are men on whom the mere
sight of medicine is operative.”

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.380
Which makes sense, because pharmacists at
the time were essentially relying on the human

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:22.980
body’s natural healing anyway.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.880
I.E. they just relied on the placebo effect!

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.430
For some researchers it’s an “annoying
complication,” for some patients, it’s

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:34.790
magical -- but the placebo effect is important,
in that it does make people feel better!

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.629
Studies on the effect landed in the 20th century,
finding (more or less), that for the placebo

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:42.780
effect to work, people simply had to believe
in the treatment they received.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.530
There have been gigabytes of videos and articles
written about the placebo effect, but how

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.449
much does it really alter scientific experiments?

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:54.710
According to one 2014 study, in Science Translational
Medicine, 50 percent of the effects of a drug

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.260
could be just because the patient was told
they were given medicine they believed in.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.879
But that doesn’t mean medicine is giving
you sugar pills half the time, or that placebos

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.610
are screwing with medical science.

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.240
In fact, placebos produce real, measurable,
results; like reducing symptoms of, to quote

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.940
Harvard Magazine, “pain, depression, anxiety,
fatigue, and… [some symptoms of] Parkinson’s.”

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:20.010
Another study in 2016 found the mid-frontal
gyrus lit up in an fMRI scan in those who

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:21.850
responded to placebo treatments!

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.540
This means scientists should be able to design
experiments that ensure the placebo effect

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.220
isn’t an “annoying complication” anymore.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.250
And that’s the future.

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.070
A 2011 study looked at the brains of people
taking placebos and found there are many placebo

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.890
effects with different mechanisms and results.

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.510
It counter-argued, placebos are not just sugar
pills and annoyances to clinical science.

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.740
Placebos are made of [quote] “words and
rituals, symbols, and meanings!”

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.530
We can’t discount the positive social interaction
that comes with doctors, healing, and medicine!

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.399
Instead, scientists are trying to understand
how the placebo effect works, so they can

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:58.289
control for it in studies, and take advantage
of it’s power to heal.

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:59.680
What do you think of the placebo effect?

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.149
Should doctors purposefully prescribe placebos
if they know for a fact the treatment will

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.350
still work?

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.960

video.
