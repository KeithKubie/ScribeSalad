00:00:02.800 --> 00:08:14.289
&gt;&gt;Stacy: Good afternoon.

00:08:14.289 --> 00:16:08.180
Welcome.

00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:12.760
I'm delighted to host Dr. Cornel West and
Mr. Tavis Smiley today.

00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:19.579
Dr. West is a class of 1943 university professor
at Princeton University.

00:16:19.579 --> 00:16:23.550
He's best known for his classics, Race Matters
and Democracy Matters.

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:26.629
From film to TV to radio.

00:16:26.629 --> 00:16:33.589
From spoken word and of course, authorship,
Dr. West crosses all media, and, to communicate

00:16:33.589 --> 00:16:35.040
his message.

00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:38.920
TIME Magazine describes him as "one complex
dude."

00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:39.920
[laughter]

00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:41.470
A brilliant scholar.

00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:43.009
Political activist.

00:16:43.009 --> 00:16:44.009
Committed Christian.

00:16:44.009 --> 00:16:45.009
And a soul brother to the bone.

00:16:45.009 --> 00:16:46.009
Welcome Dr. West.

00:16:46.009 --> 00:16:47.009
[applause]

00:16:47.009 --> 00:16:48.009
&gt;&gt;Cornel West: Glad to be here.

00:16:48.009 --> 00:16:49.009
Thank you for having me.

00:16:49.009 --> 00:16:51.470
It's a blessing to be here.

00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:54.130
Thank you.

00:16:54.130 --> 00:16:59.690
&gt;&gt;Stacy: Mr. Smiley is President CEO of The
Smiley Group.

00:16:59.690 --> 00:17:05.810
He co-hosts the late night talk show Tavis
Smiley and also has his own radio show on

00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:08.700
Public Radio International, the Tavis Smiley
Show.

00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:11.300
He too is a multimedia communicator.

00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:16.380
Covering race, religion, politics, social
justice, and all of those topics in ways that

00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:17.380
challenge our beliefs.

00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:21.950
He is not only a voice for change but he is
an inspiration for our youth.

00:17:21.950 --> 00:17:28.260
Because of the Tavis Smiley Foundation more
than 6,000 youth have been trained in leadership.

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:32.090
These two co-host a show together on Public
Radio International.

00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:34.460
Called Smiley and West.

00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:37.590
They both collectively have written 35 books.

00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:41.350
Both have had New York Times bestsellers.

00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:47.180
And they've finally come together to raise
awareness about a topic, which they coined

00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:48.270
the "p" word.

00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:49.270
Or Poverty.

00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:50.270
Poverty in America.

00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:55.460
Please join me in welcoming Tavis Smiley and
Cornel West to talk about "The Rich and The

00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:57.140
Rest of Us."

00:17:57.140 --> 00:17:58.630
[applause]

00:17:58.630 --> 00:18:06.200
&gt;&gt;Stacy: They, we have a video that we wanna
show.

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:07.200
Do you wanna?

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:09.950
&gt;&gt;Tavis Smiley: Yeah, I think this piece is
called "I had everything."

00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:17.500
And the short answer is that last summer Dr.
West and I took a poverty tour.

00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:22.290
We got on a bus and went to 11 states and
18 cities across the country.

00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:27.960
Trying to get a sense of what poverty had
really done to America.

00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:32.900
What was the impact of the so-called "great
recession" on everyday people in this country?

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:38.200
Doc and I believe that poverty is the moral
and the spiritual issue of our time.

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:39.740
But it required us to do a little more research.

00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:42.400
We wanted to get out on the road.

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:47.220
Give up a part of our summer, to try to see
what the new face of poverty looked like.

00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:50.310
So for so long in this country, poverty has
been color coded.

00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:52.020
So you think poverty, you think black.

00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:54.610
You think poverty, you think brown.

00:18:54.610 --> 00:18:58.580
But with the Census Bureau letting us know
that one out of every two Americans is either

00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:01.440
in or near poverty, 50 percent of our nation.

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:04.310
150 million people are either in or near poverty.

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:08.870
Clearly the face of poverty had changed and
we wanted to see what the new face of poverty

00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:14.120
looked like, to have a better understanding
of how we are to advance our work, Stacy,

00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:18.500
about what poverty is, what it is not, how
to reduce it.

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:19.500
How to eradicate it.

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:20.630
So we got on this bus.

00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:22.550
Again, 11 states, 18 cities.

00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:25.280
Had a documentary crew in tow with me.

00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:30.250
And we turned that tour into a week long special
on PBS.

00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:36.130
So for five nights on national television,
on PBS, there were these short pieces.

00:19:36.130 --> 00:19:39.500
These seven to ten minute pieces.

00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:44.280
On each night about what we saw, about a particular
theme, particular subject matter, particular

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:46.130
aspect or angle of poverty.

00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:49.340
And that these short mini-docs, if you will.

00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:54.450
These mini-docs were then followed by extensive
conversation with experts about these particular

00:19:54.450 --> 00:19:55.450
issues.

00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:59.200
So this is a piece that aired on one of the
five nights of the PBS special.

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:01.300
Born of our poverty tour last summer.

00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:03.730
The precursor for the book we're gonna talk
about today.

00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:05.040
It's about seven to eight minutes.

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:08.120
It's called "I had everything" and I think
it'll give you a good sense of what we experienced

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:09.120
on the tour.

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:10.120
So.

00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:11.120
Take a look.

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:13.480
&gt;&gt;Stacy: Roll the video.

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:19.650
[blues music]
&gt;&gt;Male Narrator: The largest economic institutions

00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:25.110
were brought to their collective knees at
the government's doorstep, in search of salvation.

00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:26.580
The bailout.

00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:31.260
Wall street socialized it's failure on the
back of Main Street.

00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:37.630
The resulting housing crisis and jobs crisis
fostered a poverty unseen in generations.

00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:43.520
A poverty not just of inner city ghettos and
barrios, but of the suburbs, crossing all

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:44.820
racial lines.

00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:50.510
Nearly one third of the middle class, mostly
families with children, have fallen now into

00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:54.030
poverty.

00:20:54.030 --> 00:21:32.850
[blues music continues in background]
&gt;&gt;Male speaker: Welcome Dr. Cornel West!

00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:37.000
[applause and cheers]

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:44.390
&gt;&gt;Cornel West: Oh, what a blessing to be in
the heart of the blues land.

00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:48.780
I've always considered myself a blues man.

00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:56.680
The life of the mind, 'cause the blues ain't
nothing but a occupied graphical chronicle

00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:59.890
of a personal catastrophe expressed lyrically.

00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:00.890
[applause]

00:22:00.890 --> 00:22:02.570
The blues is universal.

00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:08.450
I don't care what color, what culture, what
city, what life.

00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:10.590
Everybody has some catastrophe.

00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:11.660
[audience whistles]

00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:17.790
But the question is, what is your response
to the catastrophic?

00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:20.750
Will it be love and justice?

00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:23.260
Or will it be hatred or revenge?

00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:44.790
And the blues says, it's all about the love

00:22:44.790 --> 00:23:00.190
&gt;&gt;Male #1: [inaudible] This is the homeless
[inaudible]

00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:23.590
&gt;&gt;Male #2: That's what we are.

00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:55.770
We're the homeless guys at Freedom House.

00:23:55.770 --> 00:24:13.580
You talked about the poverty.

00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:20.150
That's what, you know, I had a job, I had
a family.

00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:24.510
I had, you know everything a person's supposed
to have.

00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:36.700
The car, the whole bit.

00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:49.160
And I'm down to nothing right now.

00:24:49.160 --> 00:25:08.750
You know I've been, like in retail for almost
30 years.

00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:16.200
I was working for one of the major stores.

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:34.470
Who decided last year they needed to close
140 of their stores down.

00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:45.000
All of a sudden everything was thrown out
from under us.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:26:01.010
I worked with people that had been with the
company 30, 40 years.

00:26:01.010 --> 00:26:04.720
A year or two left, people are getting kinda,
whatever, pensions.

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:12.440
You know the things they worked hard to be
able to have in their retirement.

00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:17.560
People who only had like a year or so to go.

00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:19.330
Lost all of that.

00:26:19.330 --> 00:26:23.860
Because I didn't have the job I also lost
my home.

00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:30.630
And because of losing my home, I had, you
know, my wife and I, I had to make sure she

00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:34.320
was cared for, 'cause I couldn't, there wasn't
any way.

00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:35.790
And so we split up.

00:26:35.790 --> 00:26:38.640
And we've been separated for about nine months
now.

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:39.640
[blues music]

00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:40.850
&gt;&gt;Cornel West: So much love.

00:26:40.850 --> 00:26:43.380
When I hear BB King I laugh sometimes.

00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:44.430
I sing about Christ.

00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:51.420
You can feel the love when he plays Lucille
it's mixed with misery, but misery never ever

00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:53.070
has the last word.

00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:54.070
Even [unintelligible]

00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:55.070
[blues music]

00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:59.950
&gt;&gt;Tavis Smiley: Many Americans of all races,
colors and creeds are finding themselves in

00:26:59.950 --> 00:27:00.950
poverty.

00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:07.531
More children of all races colors sand creeds
from 2008 to 2009 joined the ranks of the

00:27:07.531 --> 00:27:17.260
poor in this country than at any other point
in time in recorded data in the history of

00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:18.260
this country.

00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:26.320
A country for me is not a great nation unless
it takes care of its babies.

00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:27.320
[applause and cheers]

00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:30.280
&gt;&gt;Tavis Smiley: It takes care of its babies.

00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:35.140
&gt;&gt;Male #3: The unemployment rate in Detroit
is 31 percent.

00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:36.890
[boos and shouts]

00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:40.430
That's a depression that's not a recession.

00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:55.720
&gt;&gt;Cheryll Chambliss: I just wanna speak to
the fact that I've done like I did everything

00:27:55.720 --> 00:28:01.620
that I was supposed to do over time.

00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:03.200
I educated myself.

00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:04.790
Educated my children.

00:28:04.790 --> 00:28:05.790
Home ownership.

00:28:05.790 --> 00:28:07.220
And I'm not unique.

00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:11.070
I'm a person that has been laid off of my
job.

00:28:11.070 --> 00:28:13.300
I've had my car repossessed.

00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:16.240
And my home is up for sale.

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:21.450
My boss explained to me that he could hire
two 20 something's for my salary.

00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:32.620
And that I could bring a lot to the situation
where people are looking for experience, that

00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:38.070
I have over these last 30 years but they just,
kind of put me out to pasture.

00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:40.290
[whistling, shouting, applause in background]

00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:42.070
But I'm not ready.

00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:43.070
It's devastating.

00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:49.530
&gt;&gt;Tavis Smiley: 'Cause when she says that
she is the face of poverty, she is.

00:28:49.530 --> 00:28:56.440
I've been saying, and Dr. West has been saying
consistently on this tour, that the new poor

00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:58.020
in this country are the former middle class.

00:28:58.020 --> 00:28:59.020
[shouts of agreement]

00:28:59.020 --> 00:29:02.090
&gt;&gt;Cheryll Chambliss: There is poverty on so
many different levels.

00:29:02.090 --> 00:29:04.280
Poverty like we've never seen before.

00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:07.570
And there's such a, just there's so much greed.

00:29:07.570 --> 00:29:08.570
At the top.

00:29:08.570 --> 00:29:11.850
And so much corporate greed that, something
has to be done.

00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:16.540
&gt;&gt;Rep. John Conyers: There are more poor white
people catching hell than there are black

00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:17.540
people [inaudible]

00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:18.540
[shouts from audience]

00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:20.610
We are in a class war right now.

00:29:20.610 --> 00:29:21.610
[shouts and cheers]

00:29:21.610 --> 00:29:22.610
We are [inaudible].

00:29:22.610 --> 00:29:23.610
It's already here.

00:29:23.610 --> 00:29:24.990
They just didn't declare it.

00:29:24.990 --> 00:29:25.990
[shouts and cheers]

00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:26.990
[blues music]

00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:31.420
&gt;&gt;Tavis Smiley: There was a white woman who
was standing on the sidewalk who was waiting

00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:37.520
for our bus to pull up so she could read Dr.
West and me the riot act.

00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:38.520
Riot act.

00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:40.660
&gt;&gt;Female Protestor: I went to the Tennessee
Williams Festival.

00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:41.660
Y'all are upsetting me.

00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:42.790
You have chosen Columbus Mississippi.

00:29:42.790 --> 00:29:44.360
This is not a poverty town.

00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:49.640
&gt;&gt;Tavis Smiley: She didn't like the idea that
we would bring a poverty tour, and pull up

00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:51.480
outside this big poverty tour bus.

00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:52.930
You're stigmatizing our town.

00:29:52.930 --> 00:29:55.100
&gt;&gt;Early Robinson: I'm a ex-military man.

00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:56.540
Both lost our jobs.

00:29:56.540 --> 00:29:57.540
Say, February.

00:29:57.540 --> 00:30:00.910
Got to pawn cars, got to do various things
just to keep our home.

00:30:00.910 --> 00:30:02.390
Strong, healthy, can do it all.

00:30:02.390 --> 00:30:03.630
Got all kinds of skills.

00:30:03.630 --> 00:30:04.630
Nobody just not hiring.

00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:08.260
&gt;&gt;Tavis Smiley: You're husband and wife, both
lost your job in the same month?

00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:09.340
&gt;&gt;Early Robinson: Same month.

00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:10.340
February.

00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:11.340
2011.

00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:14.040
And trying to keep the house and all, and
both of our cars is pawned.

00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:15.780
&gt;&gt;Christine Robinson: I'm not a talker.

00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:18.980
'Cause I'm going to start crying 'cause I
get emotional.

00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:20.730
&gt;&gt;Early Robinson: Don't do that.

00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:21.780
&gt;&gt;Christine Robinson: Oh.

00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:22.780
[laughter]

00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:23.780
Like Early said.

00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:24.780
He'd been cutting grass.

00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:25.990
I go clean houses.

00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:29.600
I have to work all the time to pay [inaudible]
off.

00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:31.930
&gt;&gt;Christine Robinson: I've got my CEO license.

00:30:31.930 --> 00:30:33.930
I can do just about anything.

00:30:33.930 --> 00:30:36.100
I'm willing to do it.

00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:37.680
But they cut us off the stamps.

00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:38.680
Penalized us.

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:39.740
We make two dollars too much.

00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:41.540
We're fighting foreclosure just like she said.

00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:44.170
The life insurance for Early is gone.

00:30:44.170 --> 00:30:45.870
Car insurance is gone.

00:30:45.870 --> 00:30:47.910
The [inaudible] walked last week.

00:30:47.910 --> 00:30:49.980
Gas gone out the house.

00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:52.580
No one know how you live.

00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:55.150
But like you said, have faith, pray.

00:30:55.150 --> 00:30:56.990
And we have each other.

00:30:56.990 --> 00:30:58.090
We have God.

00:30:58.090 --> 00:30:59.090
And we just keep on going.

00:30:59.090 --> 00:31:01.540
&gt;&gt;Larry Tate: See, Prairie used to just serve
the elderly and the disabled.

00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:03.660
Now we serve everybody that need to serve.

00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:06.810
This year, we had a budget of two million
dollars.

00:31:06.810 --> 00:31:10.070
2012, our budget's going to be about 800,000
dollars.

00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:12.080
So that's limited all the services.

00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:14.420
&gt;&gt;Tavis Smiley: From two million to 800,000

00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:15.420
&gt;&gt;Cornel West: [inaudible]

00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:17.090
&gt;&gt;Tavis Smiley: Not even half.

00:31:17.090 --> 00:31:18.090
So that's

00:31:18.090 --> 00:31:19.440
&gt;&gt;Cornel West: Less than half.

00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:20.770
That's what you have.

00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:21.780
&gt;&gt;Larry Tate: Yeah.

00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:27.040
That was a cut that came from the federal
So you can see now, we're gonna have very

00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:28.040
limited service.

00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:29.040
2012.

00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:33.420
Now when we're dealing with a big dish of
poverty.

00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:36.080
So that's just gonna make things worse.

00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:38.970
It just seems like to me that the government
has forgotten about the people.

00:31:38.970 --> 00:31:44.280
And we need to put that emphasis back on the
people.

00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:45.280
[blues music]

00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:47.210
&gt;&gt;Cornel West: Columbus, Mississippi.

00:31:47.210 --> 00:31:55.150
The birthplace of course of the greatest lyrical
playwright in the history of the country.

00:31:55.150 --> 00:31:59.430
His major theme is those who escaped from
reality.

00:31:59.430 --> 00:32:02.090
The engagement with reality.

00:32:02.090 --> 00:32:04.760
The engagement with history.

00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:07.760
And the engagement with memory requires an
engagement with poverty.

00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:15.350
And so the blues coming out of Mississippi
is an engagement with history.

00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:17.230
And engagement with memory.

00:32:17.230 --> 00:32:23.520
It's a engagement with poverty and a resilience
against it.

00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:24.520
Endurance.

00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:26.400
Fight back.

00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:29.620
And this is a love tour that fights back.

00:32:29.620 --> 00:32:30.620
[blues music]

00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:31.620
&gt;&gt;Stacy: Wow.

00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:32.620
[applause]

[CW and TS talk quietly to each other]

00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:35.220
&gt;&gt;Cornel West: Mm-hm-hm.

00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:36.220
Thanks son.

00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:37.220
&gt;&gt;Stacy: What a story.

00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:43.070
I grew up in Detroit, Michigan, so as I was
watching this video, some of the comments

00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:45.570
definitely hit home for me.

00:32:45.570 --> 00:32:55.270
And poverty, not a secret that there's people
in this room who this is home for.

00:32:55.270 --> 00:33:01.880
So we're delighted to have you come and talk
about what you experienced, and why this is

00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:02.880
important for you.

00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:08.470
A lot of the themes that came out in this
video and in your book talk about Dr. Martin

00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:12.300
Luther King Jr and how, collectively, we are
not living out that dream.

00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:15.040
Tell me more about what you mean by that.

00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:16.040
&gt;&gt;Tavis Smiley: Mm.

00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:17.040
Please.

00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:20.660
&gt;&gt;Cornel West: First I just wanna thank you,
and thank Google for allowing brother Tavis

00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:22.200
and I to be here.

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:27.140
Anytime I get a chance to spend time with
this high quality freedom fighter I've known

00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:29.610
for 25 years, consider him my younger brother.

00:33:29.610 --> 00:33:30.930
And I'm his older brother.

00:33:30.930 --> 00:33:31.930
&gt;&gt;Stacy: Alright.

00:33:31.930 --> 00:33:36.150
&gt;&gt;Cornel West: So anytime we get a chance
to spend time together, it's a beautiful thing.

00:33:36.150 --> 00:33:39.630
And I wanna acknowledge too, the magnificent
work that Google does.

00:33:39.630 --> 00:33:43.980
And we had met a group here at Google that
had a wonderful conversation.

00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:46.780
They were telling me magnificent things taking
place here.

00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:51.750
And my dear daughter Zeytun, who was a computer
wizard who's teaching me both about Google

00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:53.700
and about other aspects of the computer.

00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:54.700
&gt;&gt;Stacy: Good.

00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:56.170
&gt;&gt;Cornel West: I want to acknowledge.

00:33:56.170 --> 00:33:57.170
&gt;&gt;Stacy: Very good.

00:33:57.170 --> 00:33:58.170
[laughter]

00:33:58.170 --> 00:33:59.170
&gt;&gt;Cornel West: Oh yes.

00:33:59.170 --> 00:34:03.120
But lets' start with brother Martin King and
Fanny Lou Hamer, that rich tradition that

00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:05.680
Tavis Smiley and I have dedicated our lives
to.

00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:08.240
Which is all about a quest for unarmed truth.

00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:10.929
The condition of truth to allow suffering
to speak.

00:34:10.929 --> 00:34:14.210
So we're concerned about the suffering of
all people of all colors.

00:34:14.210 --> 00:34:15.210
All sexual orientations.

00:34:15.210 --> 00:34:16.210
All religions and non-religions.

00:34:16.210 --> 00:34:20.639
But human beings who really ought to be living
lives much more, of higher quality and dignity.

00:34:20.639 --> 00:34:22.020
And also the unapologetic love.

00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:25.030
We're quite explicit about talking about love.

00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:28.909
That's why this really has been a love tour.

00:34:28.909 --> 00:34:29.909
&gt;&gt;Stacy: Yeah.

00:34:29.909 --> 00:34:35.560
&gt;&gt;Cornel West: And for us, brother Martin
used to say "Justice is what love looks like

00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:36.560
in public."

00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:42.100
So when you really love people, we have a
deep love for poor people, you can't stand

00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:46.460
the fact that they're being treated unjustly
and unfairly.

00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:51.270
And when you look at the relation between
poverty on the one hand and the distribution

00:34:51.270 --> 00:34:54.270
of wealth, the wealth inequality that the
Occupy Movement rightly talks about.

00:34:54.270 --> 00:34:57.290
We say we've got to bring a limelight to it.

00:34:57.290 --> 00:34:59.500
Tavis's idea to have this poverty tour.

00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:04.230
My only condition was we begin on a Indian
reservation with our precious indigenous brothers

00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:05.230
and sisters.

00:35:05.230 --> 00:35:06.230
&gt;&gt;Stacy: Excellent.

00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:08.770
&gt;&gt;Cornel West: And we started down at the
Indian reservations.

00:35:08.770 --> 00:35:13.130
You can look at America from a very different
set of lenses.

00:35:13.130 --> 00:35:17.860
Look at it from 1492, World War I. been going
on ever since.

00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:18.950
311 reservations now.

00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:20.040
50 percent unemployment.

00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:22.670
Levels of social breakdown and so forth.

00:35:22.670 --> 00:35:26.930
Then we moved to brown barrios where our Latino
brothers and sisters deal with immigration

00:35:26.930 --> 00:35:27.930
policy.

00:35:27.930 --> 00:35:29.490
Then we went to the black ghetto.

00:35:29.490 --> 00:35:32.370
Or we used to, you know, we on the chocolate
side of town.

00:35:32.370 --> 00:35:33.370
Where we come from.

00:35:33.370 --> 00:35:34.370
&gt;&gt;Stacy: [laughs]

00:35:34.370 --> 00:35:35.370
&gt;&gt;Cornel West: But then also our white brothers
and sisters.

00:35:35.370 --> 00:35:36.370
And our Asian brothers and sisters.

00:35:36.370 --> 00:35:37.370
So to make it a holistic thing.

00:35:37.370 --> 00:35:38.370
To keep alive the legacy of Martin Luther
King Jr. [inaudible]

00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:39.370
&gt;&gt;Stacy: You spend a good amount of time in
the book taking us back.

00:35:39.370 --> 00:35:40.370
And going back and looking at history.

00:35:40.370 --> 00:35:42.070
And talking about how this is not a recent
issue.

00:35:42.070 --> 00:35:43.520
Why was it important to do that?

00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:46.390
&gt;&gt;Cornel West: Well one, because you have
to understand, America itself of course was

00:35:46.390 --> 00:35:47.390
born of revolutions.

00:35:47.390 --> 00:35:48.390
Revolution against monarchy.

00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:51.130
But of course we still had mistreatment of
indigenous peoples and slavery.

00:35:51.130 --> 00:35:52.710
So the US Constitution, pro-slavery document.

00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:53.710
And practiced for almost 80 years.

00:35:53.710 --> 00:35:54.710
Wonderful words on paper.

00:35:54.710 --> 00:35:55.710
On the ground, slavery at work.

00:35:55.710 --> 00:35:57.010
Then we broke the back of slavery.

00:35:57.010 --> 00:35:58.010
Magnificent.

00:35:58.010 --> 00:35:59.010
Democracy alive.

00:35:59.010 --> 00:36:00.010
Expanding.

00:36:00.010 --> 00:36:01.010
Deepening.

00:36:01.010 --> 00:36:02.010
But here comes Jim Crow, slavery by another
name. and that's what the Civil Rights movement

00:36:02.010 --> 00:36:03.010
was all about.

00:36:03.010 --> 00:36:04.010
But now our present wrestling is, with oligarchy.

00:36:04.010 --> 00:36:06.570
We got one percent of the population own 42
percent of the wealth.

00:36:06.570 --> 00:36:10.370
The top 400 individuals have wealth equivalent
to the bottom 150 million fellow citizens.

00:36:10.370 --> 00:36:13.380
That level of wealth inequality cannot sustain
a fragile experiment in democracy.

00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:14.500
&gt;&gt;Tavis Smiley: Mm-hm.

00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:21.050
&gt;&gt;Stacy: People in this room love data so
I think they probably like the last part of

00:36:21.050 --> 00:36:22.050
what you said.

00:36:22.050 --> 00:36:23.050
[laughter]

00:36:23.050 --> 00:36:26.620
Tavis, the subtitle of this book is called
"The Manifesto."

00:36:26.620 --> 00:36:27.620
&gt;&gt;Tavis Smiley: Mm-hm.

00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:31.430
&gt;&gt;Stacy: Are you concerned, are you worried
about critics thinking that you're pushing

00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:32.430
a liberal agenda?

00:36:32.430 --> 00:36:37.350
And is that gonna get in the way of achieving
what you wanna achieve by writing this book?

00:36:37.350 --> 00:36:38.350
&gt;&gt;Tavis Smiley: Yeah.

00:36:38.350 --> 00:36:39.470
It's a good question Stacy.

00:36:39.470 --> 00:36:42.840
I don't think this is about liberal versus
conservative.

00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:44.650
It's not even about black versus white.

00:36:44.650 --> 00:36:47.390
It's about wrong versus right.

00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:55.070
And the question is, are we committed to the
best in and for every American?

00:36:55.070 --> 00:36:59.560
I think that whether we're black or white,
Republican or Democrat, liberal or conservative,

00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:03.570
educated or illiterate, urban or suburban,
we all want the same thing as Americans.

00:37:03.570 --> 00:37:06.460
And that's simply to live in a nation that
is as good as its promise.

00:37:06.460 --> 00:37:07.460
That's all we want.

00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:08.460
Nobody's asking for more.

00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:09.460
Nobody oughta settle for less.

00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:17.480
We all ought to have the opportunity to live
in a nation that is as good as its promise.

00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:23.510
The problem with America, as currently structured,
is that the gap between the possibility of

00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:27.930
America and the promise available to every
American, that gap is too wide.

00:37:27.930 --> 00:37:32.150
So the gap between the promise and the possibility
is too wide.

00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:33.150
And it's ever expanding.

00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:36.400
As I mentioned earlier, when you have now
50 percent of your people living in or near

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:39.320
poverty as Doc suggested a moment ago, that's
a catastrophe waiting to happen.

00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:44.060
And we argue very aggressively and unapologetically
in the text that poverty threatens our democracy.

00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:50.930
So if you are a liberal, if you are a conservative,
if you're on the Left, if you're on the Right,

00:37:50.930 --> 00:37:52.270
and you love America.

00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:57.900
And you care about preserving and protecting
our democracy, then poverty is going to have

00:37:57.900 --> 00:37:59.210
to be addressed.

00:37:59.210 --> 00:38:06.610
My reading of history suggests, and I haven't
studied this as much as Dr. West has, 'cause

00:38:06.610 --> 00:38:13.880
he teaches this stuff, but my reading of history
suggest to me that there is no, there is no

00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:23.510
empire in the history of the world that at
some point did not falter or fail.

00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:28.130
Every empire at some point falters or fails.

00:38:28.130 --> 00:38:30.920
And I don't know if it's our hubris.

00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:32.040
Or our arrogance.

00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:33.040
Our narcissism.

00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:36.530
Our patriotism, which has now run amuck and
become nationalism.

00:38:36.530 --> 00:38:38.780
I don't know what it is.

00:38:38.780 --> 00:38:41.230
But for some reason we don't even wanna wrestle
with the fact that this democracy could be

00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:43.370
on the precipice of something very very dangerous.

00:38:43.370 --> 00:38:50.280
What we argue in this book again is that poverty
is the moral, the spiritual issue of our time.

00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:55.140
And if you don't wanna put it in moral terms,
in spiritual terms.

00:38:55.140 --> 00:39:02.400
If you wanna take it out of the body politic,
the fundamental point is, that democracy as

00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:07.660
we know it is unsustainable if we let this
divide continue to grow.

00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:11.510
&gt;&gt;Stacy: And highlight for us you talk about
poverty.

00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:16.060
A lot of times people think of the homeless
person on the street who's done something

00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:17.060
bad, or is ill.

00:39:17.060 --> 00:39:18.060
But you reframe it.

00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:19.500
To talk about this new poor.

00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:20.600
Or the near poor.

00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:22.340
&gt;&gt;Tavis Smiley: And that's what this video
we saw is all about.

00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:25.590
Trying to let people see what the new face
of poverty is.

00:39:25.590 --> 00:39:28.730
We were just in New York a couple of weeks
ago.

00:39:28.730 --> 00:39:32.860
I for the first time in my career, moderated
for PBS and for C-Span.

00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:34.340
A panel of all women.

00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:37.490
It was an all woman panel of experts talking
about the issue of poverty vis a vis women

00:39:37.490 --> 00:39:38.490
and children.

00:39:38.490 --> 00:39:42.610
Something is wrong with a nation that allows
its women and children to fall faster into

00:39:42.610 --> 00:39:44.400
poverty than any other segment of the population.

00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:45.400
That's where we are right now.

00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:48.540
Women and their babies are falling into poverty
faster than any other group of Americans.

00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:52.640
And so, it's important for us to see the faces
of these Americans.

00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:53.640
Of all races.

00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:54.640
Of all colors.

00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:55.640
Of all creeds.

00:39:55.640 --> 00:40:01.260
I won't repeat what Dr. West said earlier.

00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:11.040
But he gave you a good sense, in the back
of the book, we laid out the poverty tour

00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:12.040
that we took.

00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:25.330
There's a wonderful appendix in the back of
the text that lays outóand when Doc and I

00:40:25.330 --> 00:40:35.000
first thought about it, we weren't sure we
were going to put that in the book.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:42.060
But the more we wrestled with it, our wonderful
editor, Cheryl Woodruff, decided we should

00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:43.740
in fact put this in the book.

00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:45.320
Because she said "People need to know where
you went.

00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:46.420
And who you saw.

00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:47.520
And what you experienced."

00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:50.180
There are some wonderful narratives that we've
woven through the book.

00:40:50.180 --> 00:40:52.180
But we wanted people to look at a snapshot
of what the tour was all about.

00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:55.390
So in the piece you just saw a moment ago.

00:40:55.390 --> 00:41:00.260
That white brother you saw in that piece,
he's not just white.

00:41:00.260 --> 00:41:01.880
He's a military veteran.

00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:07.140
That whole room as you saw was a room full
of military veterans.

00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:12.550
Something is wrong with a nation that allows
military vets to put their lives on the line

00:41:12.550 --> 00:41:18.010
for our freedoms, and they come home and they
can't find gainful employment.

00:41:18.010 --> 00:41:20.110
There's something wrong with that.

00:41:20.110 --> 00:41:26.340
And so the fact that he and his wife had to
split.

00:41:26.340 --> 00:41:30.260
There was nothing wrong with their relationship.

00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:32.850
They just couldn't make it together.

00:41:32.850 --> 00:41:40.680
So they had to separate so that both of them
could try to survive.

00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:47.380
And very quickly, what you saw him basically
saying, what I took from what he said that

00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:54.950
night, and Doc and I saw this repeatedly throughout
the tour, is that there are so many people

00:41:54.950 --> 00:41:56.910
that are wrestling with poverty.

00:41:56.910 --> 00:42:05.440
And it's so egregious and it's so widespread
across the country that people are no longer

00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:06.950
concerned about their homes.

00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:08.450
They've lost their homes.

00:42:08.450 --> 00:42:12.910
They've been unemployed for two or three years
some of them.

00:42:12.910 --> 00:42:14.760
They've lost their 401K.

00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:17.060
They've lost all their savings.

00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:21.640
They're beyond the embarrassment in front
of family and friends that they've been unemployed

00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:22.640
for so long.

00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:25.930
But you know what they're trying to hold on
to?

00:42:25.930 --> 00:42:27.110
Their dignity, Stacy.

00:42:27.110 --> 00:42:29.880
They're fighting to hold onto their dignity.

00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:34.630
Because as everyone at Google here understands,
there is dignity in work.

00:42:34.630 --> 00:42:36.200
There is dignity in our labor.

00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:41.920
And when you don't have an opportunity to
work to use your God-given skills, then your

00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:43.200
dignity is threatened.

00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:47.460
And then you start to wrestle with your own
humanity.

00:42:47.460 --> 00:42:51.610
And when half of the country is wrestling
with that, now you see why we say that this

00:42:51.610 --> 00:42:53.290
is threatening to our very democracy.

00:42:53.290 --> 00:43:00.400
Now you see why Dr. West says all the time,
and we lay it out in the text, that this is

00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:01.780
a matter of national security.

00:43:01.780 --> 00:43:04.900
When you start having half the population
wrestling with these kinds of issues.

00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:05.900
&gt;&gt;Cornel West: Mm-hmm.

00:43:05.900 --> 00:43:06.900
Mm-hmm.

00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:09.940
&gt;&gt;Stacy: You've both been pretty outspoken
that the current administration, and even

00:43:09.940 --> 00:43:13.630
as we go through the Republican primaries
have either ignored using the "p word" saying

00:43:13.630 --> 00:43:14.630
poverty.

00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:17.110
Or used it in ways that aren't uplifting in
your mind.

00:43:17.110 --> 00:43:19.330
And that there's a responsibility that's lacking.

00:43:19.330 --> 00:43:24.150
Why do you feel so strongly about that and
what exactly is lacking in your mind?

00:43:24.150 --> 00:43:25.840
&gt;&gt;Tavis Smiley: You said something about Obama?

00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:26.880
&gt;&gt;Cornel West: A little bit.

00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:27.880
&gt;&gt;Tavis Smiley: [inaudible]

00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:28.880
[laughter]

00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:31.730
&gt;&gt;Cornel West: No, I have a great love for
my dear brother President.

00:43:31.730 --> 00:43:37.930
But brother Tavis and I believe in protect
him against vicious right wing lies and respecting

00:43:37.930 --> 00:43:40.640
him as a human being as President.

00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:43.420
And correcting him because we love poor people.

00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:44.980
We love working people.

00:43:44.980 --> 00:43:49.480
And I think any President, any color, must
be accountable in that sense.

00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:54.920
But I think part of it has to do with the
fact that brother Tavis and I come out of

00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:58.360
a tradition that says that there's a difference
between success and greatness.

00:43:58.360 --> 00:44:00.440
See, success is a beautiful thing.

00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:04.610
Material prosperity can be magnificent if
you know how to use it, don't allow it to

00:44:04.610 --> 00:44:05.610
devour your soul.

00:44:05.610 --> 00:44:08.090
Having status and title and wealth can be
fine too.

00:44:08.090 --> 00:44:13.850
But if one is well adjusted to injustice,
then you could be successful and not great.

00:44:13.850 --> 00:44:14.850
&gt;&gt;Tavis Smiley: Mm-hm.

00:44:14.850 --> 00:44:20.420
&gt;&gt;Cornel West: See greatness has to do with
what is the quality of how you treat other

00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:21.420
people?

00:44:21.420 --> 00:44:22.420
What's the quality of your service to others?

00:44:22.420 --> 00:44:23.820
I'm a Christian, so it's "the least of these"
right?

00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:27.280
Our Jewish brothers and sisters gave a great
gift to the world.

00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:28.280
Prophetic voices.

00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:31.260
Amos and so forth.

00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:36.119
What you do to the least of these is the measure
of your greatness.

00:44:36.119 --> 00:44:40.330
So don't tell me how much money you've got.

00:44:40.330 --> 00:44:44.070
Don't tell me how big your crib is.

00:44:44.070 --> 00:44:49.800
I wanna know what the quality of the love
and service you have, especially to those

00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:50.800
catching hell.

00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:51.890
The weak and vulnerable.

00:44:51.890 --> 00:44:56.030
But that's the legacy of Martin as well.

00:44:56.030 --> 00:44:58.110
We've been shaped by that.

00:44:58.110 --> 00:45:05.720
So when I look at any President, I wanna know,
well what is the quality of your service to

00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:07.081
the least of these?

00:45:07.081 --> 00:45:11.350
Now we look at the Administration and we see,
well, often people say "Well, poor people

00:45:11.350 --> 00:45:15.110
are individuals who have bad flaws and make
bad judgments."

00:45:15.110 --> 00:45:18.520
I say "That sounds like some investment bankers
I know."

00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:19.520
[laughter]

00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:20.520
Flaws, bad judgment.

00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:21.520
What do they get?

00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:22.520
Bailouts.

00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:23.520
Individuals, flaws, bad judgment.

00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:24.520
Pull yourself up by your own bootstrap.

00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:27.860
Deal with the consequences of your own failure.

00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:32.720
This is a country that rewards success.

00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:37.020
But if you're not successful and you go under,
you have to take responsibility.

00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:41.520
OK, if that's true then let's play the game
by one set of rules.

00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:43.850
You can see the hypocrisy setting in.

00:45:43.850 --> 00:45:46.160
So when I looked at the Obama Administration.

00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:49.740
I saw Tim Geithner and Larry Summers and others.

00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:55.950
I said "My God, they don't have a history
of being highly sensitive to the suffering

00:45:55.950 --> 00:45:57.210
of poor and working people.

00:45:57.210 --> 00:45:58.950
They're Wall Street extensions."

00:45:58.950 --> 00:46:01.560
You know, worked on Wall Street.

00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:04.610
A very intimate relation with Wall Street.

00:46:04.610 --> 00:46:08.090
Wall Street got that friendly treatment you
see.

00:46:08.090 --> 00:46:13.390
And we make this point in the book.

00:46:13.390 --> 00:46:16.730
Well, where's the investigations of Wall Street
insider trading, market manipulation?

00:46:16.730 --> 00:46:21.900
We know Jamal and Leticia get caught with
a crack bag on the corner, they're going to

00:46:21.900 --> 00:46:22.900
jail.

00:46:22.900 --> 00:46:24.410
Was there criminal activity on Wall Street?

00:46:24.410 --> 00:46:25.410
My hunch is--

00:46:25.410 --> 00:46:26.410
[laughter]

00:46:26.410 --> 00:46:27.410
Let's have the investigation.

00:46:27.410 --> 00:46:29.410
Let's see whether they violated the law and
so forth.

00:46:29.410 --> 00:46:34.153
So I see the Obama administration early on
too cozy with Wall Street and that was made

00:46:34.153 --> 00:46:36.990
the point in terms of Main Street.

00:46:36.990 --> 00:46:42.060
Now when he does wonderful things we applaud
him.

00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:43.460
Health care extended for children?

00:46:43.460 --> 00:46:44.460
Magnificent.

00:46:44.460 --> 00:46:46.240
What was the Lilly, uh?

00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:47.240
&gt;&gt;Tavis Smiley: Lilly Ledbetter.

00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:49.250
&gt;&gt;Cornel West: For the sisters of our color?

00:46:49.250 --> 00:46:50.770
&gt;&gt;Tavis Smiley: First law he signed.

00:46:50.770 --> 00:46:51.770
Great decision.

00:46:51.770 --> 00:46:52.770
&gt;&gt;Cornel West: Beautiful.

00:46:52.770 --> 00:46:53.770
Beautiful.

00:46:53.770 --> 00:46:56.000
But when he's turning his back to poor and
working people, we hit him lovingly.

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:57.000
[laughter]

00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:58.000
Not just him.

00:46:58.000 --> 00:46:59.000
But the whole Administration, you know.

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:00.000
&gt;&gt;Stacy: And then that's fair.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:01.000
&gt;&gt;Cornel West: Absolutely.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:04.470
Because we have a system where oligarchs really
rule both parties in place.

00:47:04.470 --> 00:47:06.160
Republicans deeply conservative with oligarchy
rule.

00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:07.570
Democrats, neo-liberal, but oligarchy rule.

00:47:07.570 --> 00:47:08.980
Both tied to big money.

00:47:08.980 --> 00:47:11.120
Who speaks for poor people on K Street?

00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:12.120
13,000 lobbyists.

00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:13.120
Wearing Red Element.

00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:14.120
That's about it.

00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:15.120
Some churches.

00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:16.120
Some mosques.

00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:17.120
Some synagogues that are prophetic.

00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:22.570
We're not talking about the Constantinian
ones, who are well adjusted to the oligarchy

00:47:22.570 --> 00:47:23.570
rules.

00:47:23.570 --> 00:47:26.160
&gt;&gt;Tavis Smiley: And I think context here is
very important.

00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:27.859
Most people miss this.

00:47:27.859 --> 00:47:32.910
Four years ago when we were in the last campaign
for the White House with Mr. Obama, Mr. McCain.

00:47:32.910 --> 00:47:33.910
Three presidential debates.

00:47:33.910 --> 00:47:37.340
The word "poor" or "poverty" does not come
up one time in three presidential debates.

00:47:37.340 --> 00:47:38.700
&gt;&gt;Cornel West: That's right.

00:47:38.700 --> 00:47:42.510
&gt;&gt;Tavis Smiley: We all recall the economy
was tanking at that point.

00:47:42.510 --> 00:47:46.180
We were headed into the so called Great Recession
at that moment.

00:47:46.180 --> 00:47:49.180
The word "poor", "poverty" doesn't come up
in three presidential debates.

00:47:49.180 --> 00:47:50.200
Obama doesn't utter it.

00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:51.220
McCain doesn't utter it.

00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:54.630
The moderators in those three debates don't
even ask about it.

00:47:54.630 --> 00:47:59.850
Fast forward four years and nobody except
Wall Street bankers, are better off now than

00:47:59.850 --> 00:48:01.590
they were four years ago.

00:48:01.590 --> 00:48:02.590
Poverty abounds.

00:48:02.590 --> 00:48:04.820
50 percent of us are wrestling with it.

00:48:04.820 --> 00:48:06.869
You have the perennially poor.

00:48:06.869 --> 00:48:09.090
You have the new poor.

00:48:09.090 --> 00:48:13.440
As I said earlier, the new poor are the former
middle class.

00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:15.630
And you have the near poor.

00:48:15.630 --> 00:48:17.920
Folk who are just a paycheck away.

00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:19.780
That's again, 150 million of us.

00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:21.640
Half of us wrestling with poverty.

00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:25.670
So we can't have another campaign for the
White House, Stacy, where the issue of poverty

00:48:25.670 --> 00:48:26.670
doesn't get addressed.

00:48:26.670 --> 00:48:27.710
We raised this issue with Mr. Romney.

00:48:27.710 --> 00:48:30.990
He wants to suggest that we're playing the
politics of envy.

00:48:30.990 --> 00:48:31.990
That's nonsense.

00:48:31.990 --> 00:48:34.840
Nobody poor is jealous or envious of wealthy
people.

00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:36.590
People just want an opportunity.

00:48:36.590 --> 00:48:38.330
Want a chance to work.

00:48:38.330 --> 00:48:39.730
They want their dignity.

00:48:39.730 --> 00:48:44.480
They wanna revel in their own humanity and
that of their loved ones and family.

00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:46.570
So it's not a politics of envy.

00:48:46.570 --> 00:48:50.640
But we can't have another campaign where this
issue doesn't get addressed.

00:48:50.640 --> 00:48:55.040
We are out here now, unapologetically, with
humility, to put this issue on the agenda.

00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:56.320
We're not the only ones.

00:48:56.320 --> 00:48:58.920
But to raise this issue higher up on the American
agenda.

00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:03.760
So this time around, we don't go through another
campaign where this issue doesn't get addressed.

00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:05.130
Thankfully Occupy is back.

00:49:05.130 --> 00:49:06.150
It's the Spring.

00:49:06.150 --> 00:49:08.550
And they're gonna be in full force.

00:49:08.550 --> 00:49:14.370
So I think this time we're gonna see a different
conversation than we saw four years ago.

00:49:14.370 --> 00:49:20.190
But we can't, our democracy again cannot survive
us putting our head in the sand and ignoring

00:49:20.190 --> 00:49:21.190
this issue.

00:49:21.190 --> 00:49:23.100
Particularly in a presidential election year.

00:49:23.100 --> 00:49:24.100
So Doc is right.

00:49:24.100 --> 00:49:25.100
It's not just the Democrats.

00:49:25.100 --> 00:49:26.100
Democrats, Republicans.

00:49:26.100 --> 00:49:27.100
Nobody wants to make this an issue.

00:49:27.100 --> 00:49:30.660
We said in the book that there seems to be
in Washington right now a bipartisan consensus

00:49:30.660 --> 00:49:31.660
that the poor just don't matter.

00:49:31.660 --> 00:49:33.460
A bipartisan consensus that poverty is just
not an important enough issue to address.

00:49:33.460 --> 00:49:35.400
And that's what sort of troubles us.

00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:37.110
&gt;&gt;Cornel West: Mm-hmm.

00:49:37.110 --> 00:49:40.660
&gt;&gt;Stacy: So you talk about some past presidents.

00:49:40.660 --> 00:49:44.600
Johnson, Truman, Roosevelt as people who came
in with their Administration and did something

00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:45.600
about poverty.

00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:46.850
What impressed you about what they did?

00:49:46.850 --> 00:49:51.040
What can the current Administration or a future
Administration learn from that?

00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:56.880
&gt;&gt;Cornel West: Mm. well, Tavis always makes
the point that each Administration has to

00:49:56.880 --> 00:49:57.880
be pushed.

00:49:57.880 --> 00:49:59.480
And he's right about that.

00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:03.350
LBJ was pushed by the social movements of
the 1960s.

00:50:03.350 --> 00:50:06.840
Both the Civil Rights movement, the Trade
Union Movement.

00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:10.520
Also religious people who were concerned about
the plight of poor people.

00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:13.930
And so the, went from 22 percent to 11 percent,
in terms of poverty rate.

00:50:13.930 --> 00:50:16.120
Within ten years with LBJ's program.

00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:18.310
Especially the impact on the elderly.

00:50:18.310 --> 00:50:19.950
Especially the impact on the elderly.

00:50:19.950 --> 00:50:20.950
Major investment.

00:50:20.950 --> 00:50:22.730
And that's what we're calling for.

00:50:22.730 --> 00:50:25.890
We need to shift from this discourse about
austerity and cuts.

00:50:25.890 --> 00:50:27.670
And need to talk about investment.

00:50:27.670 --> 00:50:29.750
Infrastructure, research and development for
technological innovation.

00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:32.130
But especially for jobs with a living wage.

00:50:32.130 --> 00:50:33.130
Job training centers.

00:50:33.130 --> 00:50:34.420
And we really know what to do.

00:50:34.420 --> 00:50:37.880
Paul Krugman makes this point in his recent
point, in this depression now.

00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:40.070
We know what to do.

00:50:40.070 --> 00:50:45.340
We just don't have the will to do it because
again, the political system is broken down.

00:50:45.340 --> 00:50:50.320
It's become an instance of legalized bribery
and normalized corruption.

00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:55.680
An it's hard to get the voices of poor working
people hear given that hemorrhage that's taking

00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:58.210
place and in the mean time, our bridges are
collapsing.

00:50:58.210 --> 00:51:00.930
Educational system is collapsing for working
and poor children.

00:51:00.930 --> 00:51:03.650
And more and more this wealth inequality is
escalating.

00:51:03.650 --> 00:51:06.970
&gt;&gt;Tavis Smiley: If I may add to that very
quickly Stacy.

00:51:06.970 --> 00:51:07.970
&gt;&gt;Stacy: Sure.

00:51:07.970 --> 00:51:13.640
&gt;&gt;Tavis Smiley: In the back of the book, the
last chapter of the book is called "The Poverty

00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:14.640
Manifesto."

00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:15.640
The book starts with a portrait of poverty.

00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:19.869
It's important for us to understand how we
arrived at this place.

00:51:19.869 --> 00:51:25.370
We start with a portrait of poverty and then
the next chapter is, talks about the poverty

00:51:25.370 --> 00:51:27.110
of opportunity in this country.

00:51:27.110 --> 00:51:33.050
And then we talk about the poverty of affirmation
and the poverty of vision.

00:51:33.050 --> 00:51:35.550
And the poverty of courage.

00:51:35.550 --> 00:51:38.770
And the poverty of imagination.

00:51:38.770 --> 00:51:44.540
And we walk through these various chapters
under these kinds of things, weaving this

00:51:44.540 --> 00:51:45.540
narrative.

00:51:45.540 --> 00:51:52.210
What we think oughta be done and how we address
this issue and what hasn't been done quite

00:51:52.210 --> 00:51:53.210
frankly.

00:51:53.210 --> 00:51:58.120
At the end of the book there is the appendix
about the tour that we took.

00:51:58.120 --> 00:52:01.350
But beyond that the final part is this poverty
manifesto.

00:52:01.350 --> 00:52:06.140
Where, to your question more expressly, we
lay out a dozen things that we think need

00:52:06.140 --> 00:52:10.420
to be done to get serious about reducing and
eradicating poverty in this country.

00:52:10.420 --> 00:52:17.250
So there are 12 specific ideas at the end
of the text that we think we ought to as a

00:52:17.250 --> 00:52:18.330
nation take seriously.

00:52:18.330 --> 00:52:27.570
One of those ideas is the calling of a White
House conference on the eradication of poverty.

00:52:27.570 --> 00:52:30.840
I mentioned earlier the power the President
has with just a pen.

00:52:30.840 --> 00:52:36.630
The first thing that President Obama did the
minute he got inaugurated on those steps.

00:52:36.630 --> 00:52:39.210
And we all watched and cried and celebrated.

00:52:39.210 --> 00:52:40.280
He walked inside.

00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:43.510
&gt;&gt;Cornel West: I'm not sure all of us did.

00:52:43.510 --> 00:52:45.760
A significant number of fellow citizens did.

00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:46.760
We did.

00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:48.380
But we had a lot ofó

00:52:48.380 --> 00:52:50.480
&gt;&gt;Tavis Smiley: Lot of people didn't.

00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:53.100
&gt;&gt;Cornel West: brothers and sisters, hard
to adjust to that.

00:52:53.100 --> 00:52:54.100
&gt;&gt;Tavis Smiley: I did.

00:52:54.100 --> 00:52:55.100
[laughter]

00:52:55.100 --> 00:52:58.060
Some folks still have a hard time with it
four years later.

00:52:58.060 --> 00:52:59.340
&gt;&gt;Cornel West: That's right.

00:52:59.340 --> 00:53:00.340
That's right.

00:53:00.340 --> 00:53:01.340
We pray for them.

00:53:01.340 --> 00:53:02.340
They just [laughs]

00:53:02.340 --> 00:53:04.410
&gt;&gt;Tavis Smiley: I take that loving correction.

00:53:04.410 --> 00:53:06.330
&gt;&gt;Cornel West: [laughs] They got challenges.

00:53:06.330 --> 00:53:11.030
&gt;&gt;Tavis Smiley: But he walked inside and signed
Lilly Ledbetter which is again what should

00:53:11.030 --> 00:53:12.550
have been done a long time ago.

00:53:12.550 --> 00:53:13.980
With respect women in the work place.

00:53:13.980 --> 00:53:15.440
What we are suggesting.

00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:16.440
Not suggesting.

00:53:16.440 --> 00:53:20.210
Calling for in this text, on this list of
12 things.

00:53:20.210 --> 00:53:24.160
Is that the next President, as his first official
act, Mr. Romney, Mr. Obama or somebody else

00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:25.930
that we don't know of at this moment.

00:53:25.930 --> 00:53:28.359
They oughta after inauguration, through Presidential
order, through executive order, establish

00:53:28.359 --> 00:53:30.500
a White House Conference on the eradication
of poverty.

00:53:30.500 --> 00:53:34.140
Bring in all the poverty experts into the
White House for two or three days and let's

00:53:34.140 --> 00:53:35.140
develop a national plan.

00:53:35.140 --> 00:53:36.350
Not a band aid.

00:53:36.350 --> 00:53:37.680
Not a quick fix.

00:53:37.680 --> 00:53:39.010
But a national plan.

00:53:39.010 --> 00:53:40.340
This ain't rocket science.

00:53:40.340 --> 00:53:44.340
As Doc said, it's not a skill problem, it's
a will problem.

00:53:44.340 --> 00:53:46.140
But bring the experts together.

00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:53.410
You know there are all kinds of plans right
now that exist for how to eradicate, how to

00:53:53.410 --> 00:53:56.500
reduce poverty in this country over ten, 15,
25 years.

00:53:56.500 --> 00:53:57.740
Catholic Charities has one.

00:53:57.740 --> 00:53:58.970
Jim Wallace at Sojourners.

00:53:58.970 --> 00:54:00.200
Jeffery Sachs at Columbia.

00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:08.210
Um, these programs these plans exist for how
to reduce poverty significantly in this country.

00:54:08.210 --> 00:54:10.480
There are other countries that have done this.

00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:14.470
We just have not had the kind of leadership
since President Johnson, that you raised,

00:54:14.470 --> 00:54:15.470
Stacy.

00:54:15.470 --> 00:54:18.270
Had that kind of Presidential leadership,
and that covers Republicans and Democrats,

00:54:18.270 --> 00:54:22.940
so we're not trying to cast aspersions or
demonize Mr. Obama.

00:54:22.940 --> 00:54:26.630
But we need that kind of leadership from the
top down.

00:54:26.630 --> 00:54:28.869
That kind of bully pulpit that the White House
offers.

00:54:28.869 --> 00:54:30.510
The President to make poverty a priority in
this country.

00:54:30.510 --> 00:54:32.790
And finally again, echoing what Dr. West said
that great Presidents aren't born, great Presidents

00:54:32.790 --> 00:54:33.790
are made.

00:54:33.790 --> 00:54:34.950
They have to be pushed into their greatness.

00:54:34.950 --> 00:54:37.530
So there is not Abraham Lincoln without Fredrick
Douglass pushing him.

00:54:37.530 --> 00:54:40.130
There is no FDR without A. Phillip Randolph
pushing him.

00:54:40.130 --> 00:54:42.250
There is no LBJ without MLK pushing him.

00:54:42.250 --> 00:54:47.109
So those of us who care about the future of
this democracy and who understand that poverty

00:54:47.109 --> 00:54:49.270
again, threatens that very democracy can not
be afraid.

00:54:49.270 --> 00:54:52.990
We gotta find the courage, the conviction,
and the commitment to push all of our leaders

00:54:52.990 --> 00:54:54.040
to make poverty a priority.

00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:56.680
&gt;&gt;Stacy: So who is the push gonna come from
for us today?

00:54:56.680 --> 00:54:58.270
&gt;&gt;Cornel West: People sitting in this room.

00:54:58.270 --> 00:54:59.640
&gt;&gt;Tavis Smiley: And watching on YouTube.

00:54:59.640 --> 00:55:01.000
&gt;&gt;Cornel West: And watching on YouTube.

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:02.000
Absolutely.

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:03.000
People of good conscience.

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:04.000
With courage.

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:05.790
Who want to make the world a better place.

00:55:05.790 --> 00:55:07.940
Who are deeply concerned about injustice.

00:55:07.940 --> 00:55:10.099
Deeply concerned about unnecessary social
misery.

00:55:10.099 --> 00:55:12.180
And we're, we are witnessing that.

00:55:12.180 --> 00:55:15.150
There is a democratic awakening that's taken
place.

00:55:15.150 --> 00:55:16.630
Not just in America.

00:55:16.630 --> 00:55:19.230
Tunisia, Egypt, Spain, Greece, and so forth.

00:55:19.230 --> 00:55:20.720
Your example of Chile.

00:55:20.720 --> 00:55:21.830
&gt;&gt;Tavis Smiley: Mm-hmm.

00:55:21.830 --> 00:55:27.030
&gt;&gt;Cornel West: To go from 40 percent poverty
to eleven point five percent poverty.

00:55:27.030 --> 00:55:28.030
That's major.

00:55:28.030 --> 00:55:29.030
That's major.

00:55:29.030 --> 00:55:31.119
The wealth inequality is still a challenge.

00:55:31.119 --> 00:55:32.230
But that's major.

00:55:32.230 --> 00:55:36.610
We can learn something and that's a situation
which we in the United States often view ourselves

00:55:36.610 --> 00:55:39.109
as out ahead of other people.

00:55:39.109 --> 00:55:42.940
That's part of our American exceptionalism
you know.

00:55:42.940 --> 00:55:47.890
God winks at us and closes God's eye to other
nations, you know.

00:55:47.890 --> 00:55:51.150
Now we know that's a lie.

00:55:51.150 --> 00:55:52.820
But we, we like to believe that.

00:55:52.820 --> 00:55:56.350
We're free and democratic 'cause we fight
to keep it free and democratic.

00:55:56.350 --> 00:55:57.440
We can lose it.

00:55:57.440 --> 00:55:59.440
The younger generation can lose it.

00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:00.930
If you don't fight.

00:56:00.930 --> 00:56:01.930
You see.

00:56:01.930 --> 00:56:04.260
But it's gonna come from everyday people.

00:56:04.260 --> 00:56:08.980
It's gonna come from ordinary citizens who
wake up and say "Look, our priorities are

00:56:08.980 --> 00:56:09.980
warped."

00:56:09.980 --> 00:56:12.940
We came up with half a million dollars, a
Marshall plan, for jails and prisons in the

00:56:12.940 --> 00:56:13.940
last 25 years.

00:56:13.940 --> 00:56:18.850
But we say when it comes to education, we
don't have the money, gotta cut.

00:56:18.850 --> 00:56:20.500
Jobs, don't have the money.

00:56:20.500 --> 00:56:22.140
Housing, don't have the money.

00:56:22.140 --> 00:56:27.080
Comes to war, Iraq, Afghanistan, trillions
of dollars we either found or went in debt.

00:56:27.080 --> 00:56:28.080
The priority.

00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:29.800
And brother Tavis is right.

00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:33.300
He says poverty is a matter of national security.

00:56:33.300 --> 00:56:34.580
State of emergency.

00:56:34.580 --> 00:56:38.000
When it becomes a priority, we follow through.

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:39.000
We execute.

00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:46.550
&gt;&gt;Stacy: So I know people in the audience
have questions, if you can queue up at the

00:56:46.550 --> 00:56:48.930
mic, as I ask one more question.

00:56:48.930 --> 00:56:49.930
Priorities.

00:56:49.930 --> 00:56:55.030
In your plan, your 12 point plan, you actually
talk about women and children as being the

00:56:55.030 --> 00:56:56.030
priority.

00:56:56.030 --> 00:56:57.030
&gt;&gt;Cornel West: Absolutely.

00:56:57.030 --> 00:56:58.420
&gt;&gt;Stacy: Tell me more about that.

00:56:58.420 --> 00:57:00.460
&gt;&gt;Cornel West: Women and children first.

00:57:00.460 --> 00:57:06.910
I think probably one of the saddest features
of the United States today is that the younger

00:57:06.910 --> 00:57:09.770
you are, the more likely you are to be poor.

00:57:09.770 --> 00:57:15.700
In the richest nation in the history of the
world, 23 percent of our precious children

00:57:15.700 --> 00:57:17.880
of all color, live in poverty.

00:57:17.880 --> 00:57:19.330
40 percent are red.

00:57:19.330 --> 00:57:21.880
Never forget our indigenous brothers and sisters.

00:57:21.880 --> 00:57:24.780
39 percent of brown children live in poverty.

00:57:24.780 --> 00:57:27.330
38 percent of black children live in poverty.

00:57:27.330 --> 00:57:30.570
Now that to me is just a moral abomination.

00:57:30.570 --> 00:57:32.010
It's an ethical obscenity.

00:57:32.010 --> 00:57:34.700
That that could be the case.

00:57:34.700 --> 00:57:37.520
You know what I mean?

00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:39.410
Finland got three percent of their children.

00:57:39.410 --> 00:57:41.570
It's no accident they're number one in education.

00:57:41.570 --> 00:57:42.570
You see?

00:57:42.570 --> 00:57:43.730
They have a commitment to education.

00:57:43.730 --> 00:57:46.160
Teachers, a whole culture of equity and shared
responsibility.

00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:50.150
And their teachers, the major graduates of
the universities, become teachers rather than

00:57:50.150 --> 00:57:51.150
investment bankers.

00:57:51.150 --> 00:57:56.080
But of course they only got five and a half
million, so they don't have to rule the world

00:57:56.080 --> 00:57:59.849
the way the United States often views itself
as.

00:57:59.849 --> 00:58:03.890
No military commitment and so forth you see.

00:58:03.890 --> 00:58:06.290
But a different kind of culture.

00:58:06.290 --> 00:58:10.290
And we can learn something from Finland without
imitating them.

00:58:10.290 --> 00:58:14.210
We're still quite distinctive in our own ways
you see.

00:58:14.210 --> 00:58:16.380
But women and children first.

00:58:16.380 --> 00:58:22.099
And I think that if we can get that out in
public and make that more visible and as Tavis

00:58:22.099 --> 00:58:25.250
says, more and more it's not just black and
brown faces on poverty.

00:58:25.250 --> 00:58:27.920
'Cause it's been color coded for a long time,
you see.

00:58:27.920 --> 00:58:32.440
&gt;&gt;Tavis Smiley: And the irony, I might add
real quick, Stacy, the irony of it is, and

00:58:32.440 --> 00:58:36.500
obviously in a campaign for the White House
the issues change daily.

00:58:36.500 --> 00:58:38.190
Sometimes they change by the hour.

00:58:38.190 --> 00:58:43.670
But every one of us in this room and on YouTube
right now knows that one of the great debates

00:58:43.670 --> 00:58:48.740
right now over the last few days has been
whether or not there is in fact a war on women.

00:58:48.740 --> 00:58:58.600
And should Ann Romney have gone to work and
what does it mean that she didn't go to work.

00:58:58.600 --> 00:59:00.660
How many nannies did she have.

00:59:00.660 --> 00:59:04.960
And what about the rest of women.

00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:06.400
And we're in this debate.

00:59:06.400 --> 00:59:08.520
Or at least a pseudo debate about women in
our society.

00:59:08.520 --> 00:59:10.260
With regard to their economic status.

00:59:10.260 --> 00:59:11.260
Their economic condition.

00:59:11.260 --> 00:59:13.330
And their economic future.

00:59:13.330 --> 00:59:16.750
But we still haven't gotten even in that debate
to the real issue.

00:59:16.750 --> 00:59:21.080
Nobody on the Democratic side, nobody on the
Republican side has said that women and children

00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:22.080
must be first.

00:59:22.080 --> 00:59:26.140
And women and children, oftentimes the weak
and the vulnerable are falling faster into

00:59:26.140 --> 00:59:27.310
poverty than anybody else.

00:59:27.310 --> 00:59:31.390
So we get all these nonsensical ridiculous
quite frankly stuck on stupid debates about

00:59:31.390 --> 00:59:35.940
nothing and that's what in part, presidential
campaigns are.

00:59:35.940 --> 00:59:40.940
It's about point scoring and trying to play
to your base and the stuff that we all know

00:59:40.940 --> 00:59:41.980
make up presidential campaigns.

00:59:41.980 --> 00:59:45.790
But again, this is why you can't go through
another process like this.

00:59:45.790 --> 00:59:48.540
Where the facts are not placed on the table.

00:59:48.540 --> 00:59:52.200
And people aren't forced to address what those
facts really are.

00:59:52.200 --> 00:59:53.860
So whether you're Mr. Obama.

00:59:53.860 --> 00:59:54.860
Mr. Romney.

00:59:54.860 --> 00:59:55.860
Or anybody else.

00:59:55.860 --> 01:00:00.130
What are we going to go about the fact while
we debate this other stuff, that women and

01:00:00.130 --> 01:00:01.609
children are catching the most hell?

01:00:01.609 --> 01:00:06.360
What are we going to do about the fact that
Doc said just a moment ago.

01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:09.440
And that just, every time I hear him say that,
and we write about this in the book.

01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:17.180
But every time I hear that statement that
the younger you are in America the more likely

01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:18.690
you are to be poor.

01:00:18.690 --> 01:00:21.710
That goes against the whole notion of the
American Dream.

01:00:21.710 --> 01:00:26.990
That goes against what every young person
I'm looking at right now here at Google is

01:00:26.990 --> 01:00:27.990
all about.

01:00:27.990 --> 01:00:29.300
You wanna make a difference.

01:00:29.300 --> 01:00:30.910
You wanna make a contribution.

01:00:30.910 --> 01:00:34.390
But let's not be naive here.

01:00:34.390 --> 01:00:37.460
You want your piece of the American Dream.

01:00:37.460 --> 01:00:38.460
You want your chance at raising a family.

01:00:38.460 --> 01:00:40.380
You want your chance at home ownership.

01:00:40.380 --> 01:00:41.860
You want your chance.

01:00:41.860 --> 01:00:42.860
And there's absolutely nothing wrong with
that.

01:00:42.860 --> 01:00:45.010
But how do we go, how did we arrive at this
place?

01:00:45.010 --> 01:00:51.340
Of being a nation where again, the younger
you are, the more likely you are to be poor.

01:00:51.340 --> 01:00:56.230
Put another way, too many of our children
are being forced to surrender their life's

01:00:56.230 --> 01:00:59.010
chances before they ever know their life's
choices.

01:00:59.010 --> 01:01:01.800
And that oughta be unacceptable in this country.

01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:02.840
&gt;&gt;Cornel West : Mm-hm.

01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:04.590
&gt;&gt;Stacy: Let's take some questions.

01:01:04.590 --> 01:01:06.330
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Thank you Stacy.

01:01:06.330 --> 01:01:08.070
My name is Michael Peggs.

01:01:08.070 --> 01:01:14.140
I wanna thank both of you for being here an
particularly Dr. West.

01:01:14.140 --> 01:01:19.880
For my brother in the house known as Alpha
Phi Alpha Fraternity Incorporated.

01:01:19.880 --> 01:01:22.140
&gt;&gt;Cornel West: Oh-six, oh-six brother.

01:01:22.140 --> 01:01:24.849
&gt;&gt;Male #1: And we appreciate you.

01:01:24.849 --> 01:01:28.010
&gt;&gt;Cornel West: Oh, don't start on me.

01:01:28.010 --> 01:01:29.010
Oh-six, oh-six

01:01:29.010 --> 01:01:30.010
[laughter]

01:01:30.010 --> 01:01:31.010
In the house.

01:01:31.010 --> 01:01:32.070
In the house.

01:01:32.070 --> 01:01:35.350
&gt;&gt;Tavis Smiley: We Kappas ain't gonna have
that today.

01:01:35.350 --> 01:01:36.600
&gt;&gt;Cornel West: In the house.

01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:38.260
On King, Dubois, Duke Ellington.

01:01:38.260 --> 01:01:40.260
&gt;&gt;Tavis Smiley: La, la, la, la

01:01:40.260 --> 01:01:41.260
&gt;&gt;Cornel West: [inaudible]

01:01:41.260 --> 01:01:43.250
&gt;&gt;Tavis Smiley: La, la, la, la

01:01:43.250 --> 01:01:44.580
&gt;&gt;Cornel West: I don't claim apology.

01:01:44.580 --> 01:01:46.230
OK, I know you got a question.

01:01:46.230 --> 01:01:52.650
&gt;&gt;Male #1: OK, I was traveling back from New
York yesterday on the flight, rereading "The

01:01:52.650 --> 01:01:54.390
Miseducation of the Negro" by Dr. Carter G.
Woods.

01:01:54.390 --> 01:01:57.500
And I was reminded that education is really
the paramount means for uplifting the people.

01:01:57.500 --> 01:02:00.080
And whether pragmatic and practical, or classical
and traditional, education really has to prepare

01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:03.080
you to make a living for yourself.

01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:06.400
And that was really his second theme in the
book.

01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:07.400
The importance of earning a living.

01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:12.730
And I'm wondering if our current state of
poverty is a result of our inability to make

01:02:12.730 --> 01:02:13.730
a living.

01:02:13.730 --> 01:02:15.570
Some would imply it's a individual responsibility.

01:02:15.570 --> 01:02:16.570
Or something larger.

01:02:16.570 --> 01:02:18.720
&gt;&gt;Cornel West: Yeah, it's a deep question.

01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:19.980
I appreciate the question.

01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:24.150
The Greeks have a wonderful word called "paideia."

01:02:24.150 --> 01:02:25.150
P-A-I-D-E-I-A.

01:02:25.150 --> 01:02:27.960
Which means "deep education."

01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:29.839
Not the same thing as cheap schooling.

01:02:29.839 --> 01:02:30.839
Deep education.

01:02:30.839 --> 01:02:31.839
Learning how to die.

01:02:31.839 --> 01:02:32.839
Criticizing yourself.

01:02:32.839 --> 01:02:33.839
Wrestling with yourself.

01:02:33.839 --> 01:02:34.839
Examining yourself.

01:02:34.839 --> 01:02:35.839
And then being a citizen.

01:02:35.839 --> 01:02:39.060
Somebody who can actually be self-determining
in that way.

01:02:39.060 --> 01:02:43.339
See, cheap education is just gaining a skill,
becoming a consumer, and being a spectator.

01:02:43.339 --> 01:02:44.480
Not the same thing.

01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:48.530
It might even plug you into the job.

01:02:48.530 --> 01:02:53.440
Of course so many jobs these days are low
wage for the most part.

01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:59.750
But it's the deep education that's at the
center of a democracy.

01:02:59.750 --> 01:03:06.470
Not cheap ed, cheap schooling might be tied
to the market and so forth and so on.

01:03:06.470 --> 01:03:12.630
But there' s got to be some balance between
the market that is open enough for people

01:03:12.630 --> 01:03:18.390
to be able to allow their talents to flower
and flourish, and then public space.

01:03:18.390 --> 01:03:19.390
Common good.

01:03:19.390 --> 01:03:22.330
So it's not just about the private gain.

01:03:22.330 --> 01:03:24.970
It's something that holds us together.

01:03:24.970 --> 01:03:29.180
Glue that holds us together.

01:03:29.180 --> 01:03:36.540
And deep education, public education at its
best, historically has been that.

01:03:36.540 --> 01:03:39.869
But our priorities are warped.

01:03:39.869 --> 01:03:41.200
Here again.

01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:42.530
You know.

01:03:42.530 --> 01:03:44.470
And that's part of our challenge.

01:03:44.470 --> 01:03:49.490
&gt;&gt;Tavis Smiley: We could have a debate very
quickly about which came first, the chicken

01:03:49.490 --> 01:03:50.500
or the egg.

01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:52.230
That, which came first education or poverty.

01:03:52.230 --> 01:03:53.670
Because their inextricably linked, the two.

01:03:53.670 --> 01:03:56.700
Without having the debate about which one
impacts which, in which direction.

01:03:56.700 --> 01:03:58.880
What we saw on this tour.

01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:02.190
We spent a lot of time with children on this
tour.

01:04:02.190 --> 01:04:07.040
And we saw children in your hometown in Detroit,
who come to school and they can't concentrate.

01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:08.290
And you know why.

01:04:08.290 --> 01:04:10.160
They haven't had anything to eat.

01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:11.730
Their living conditions are deplorable.

01:04:11.730 --> 01:04:13.980
Again, we didn't just see this in Detroit.

01:04:13.980 --> 01:04:15.230
We saw this around the nation.

01:04:15.230 --> 01:04:18.710
But the link between education and poverty
is well documented.

01:04:18.710 --> 01:04:23.920
Everybody agrees on the Left and the Right,
without access to a quality education, then

01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:26.410
you're much more likely to live a life of
poverty.

01:04:26.410 --> 01:04:30.230
And so we take this issue without belaboring
the point.

01:04:30.230 --> 01:04:33.980
We take this issue head on in the text.

01:04:33.980 --> 01:04:39.540
But again, something is wrong when kids you
know, we've been working with a program called

01:04:39.540 --> 01:04:40.540
Feeding America.

01:04:40.540 --> 01:04:44.840
And the numbers of children who go hungry
in this country every day.

01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:45.840
The increasing rates of food insecurity.

01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:56.620
It's hard for a kid to go to school and concentrate
and focus when there's so much lacking at

01:04:56.620 --> 01:04:57.620
home.

01:04:57.620 --> 01:04:59.460
Here again, women and children falling through
the cracks.

01:04:59.460 --> 01:05:01.320
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Thank you, thank you.

01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:02.320
&gt;&gt;Cornel West: Absolutely.

01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:06.910
&gt;&gt;Female #1: So the fact that you know, this
room isn't overflowing out the building to

01:05:06.910 --> 01:05:13.840
me, reflects the fact that the elite really
don't prioritize poverty.

01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:18.840
And people in this room are obviously, our
colleagues and neighbors, are part of the

01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:19.840
one percent.

01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:23.390
So how do you recommend that we, even the
most liberal of my colleagues and neighbors,

01:05:23.390 --> 01:05:24.780
their extended social circles.

01:05:24.780 --> 01:05:30.710
They consider themselves liberal but poverty,
as you well know, it's not at the top of their

01:05:30.710 --> 01:05:31.710
concerns.

01:05:31.710 --> 01:05:34.280
You know they're more concerned about internet
privacy or climate change.

01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:38.050
And plenty of other things but poverty just,
isn't in their top three, five, ten.

01:05:38.050 --> 01:05:39.050
&gt;&gt;Cornel West: Mm-hmm.

01:05:39.050 --> 01:05:40.050
&gt;&gt;Tavis Smiley: [chuckles]

01:05:40.050 --> 01:05:42.520
&gt;&gt;Female #1: So what do you recommend we do
to educate the people that we are in close

01:05:42.520 --> 01:05:45.750
contact with who are the, you know, the people
who are in power in this country?

01:05:45.750 --> 01:05:51.270
&gt;&gt;Cornel West: Now, we're trying to see to
it that within the next two to four or five

01:05:51.270 --> 01:05:56.480
months, many of your friends will not only
be talking about it but will have their conscience

01:05:56.480 --> 01:05:57.480
awakened.

01:05:57.480 --> 01:05:58.480
Because a lot of times it's a matter of exposure.

01:05:58.480 --> 01:06:00.950
A lot of times they tend to view what's going
on in the corporate media.

01:06:00.950 --> 01:06:06.980
Which tends to have a very truncated framework
in regard to what's going on in the nation.

01:06:06.980 --> 01:06:09.470
'Cause they've got a bottom line too.

01:06:09.470 --> 01:06:11.490
So there hasn't been a lot of talk about poverty.

01:06:11.490 --> 01:06:16.250
Lot of people in America didn't know that
there is such a thing as arbitrary police

01:06:16.250 --> 01:06:17.290
power in poor communities.

01:06:17.290 --> 01:06:18.330
Until Treyvon Martin came.

01:06:18.330 --> 01:06:20.930
See, I mean, "Oh my God, that's still going
on?

01:06:20.930 --> 01:06:21.930
In 2012?"

01:06:21.930 --> 01:06:22.930
You don't say.

01:06:22.930 --> 01:06:23.930
[laughter]

01:06:23.930 --> 01:06:24.930
But we all have our own bubbles.

01:06:24.930 --> 01:06:28.540
And people can't be in contact with everything
at the same time.

01:06:28.540 --> 01:06:32.980
But when there's a major stress, the way Occupy
stresses wealth inequality, corporate greed.

01:06:32.980 --> 01:06:33.980
People start talking.

01:06:33.980 --> 01:06:36.150
"Oh my god, that does make sense.

01:06:36.150 --> 01:06:37.150
That's true.

01:06:37.150 --> 01:06:38.150
Look at the stories.

01:06:38.150 --> 01:06:39.680
Newspapers are talking about it."

01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:45.910
And I think we haven't seen this in America
really since John Atwoods tried to pull it

01:06:45.910 --> 01:06:46.910
off.

01:06:46.910 --> 01:06:47.910
But then he had his problems.

01:06:47.910 --> 01:06:48.910
God bless him.

01:06:48.910 --> 01:06:49.910
[laughter]

01:06:49.910 --> 01:06:55.490
But it goes back then to Martin King and Dorothy
Day and Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel, and

01:06:55.490 --> 01:07:03.110
the others in the 60s, the Thom Haydens and
others who were trying to raise this issue.

01:07:03.110 --> 01:07:10.660
But now I think it's coming back and so I
think more of your friends.

01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:12.720
And again, not limited to liberals.

01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:15.020
But we're talking about centrists, conservatives.

01:07:15.020 --> 01:07:16.640
Anybody who cares about other people's suffering.

01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:18.240
I don't think liberals have a monopoly on
caring.

01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:19.240
At all.

01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:21.650
Even though thank God a number of them do.

01:07:21.650 --> 01:07:27.550
But I think there is going to be a real renaissance
and I hope I'm not naive about this.

01:07:27.550 --> 01:07:29.720
You don't think I'm naive about this?

01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:31.270
&gt;&gt;Female #1: Well, thank you.

01:07:31.270 --> 01:07:33.750
&gt;&gt;Tavis Smiley: I would never call you naive.

01:07:33.750 --> 01:07:35.300
&gt;&gt;Cornel West: I appreciate that.

01:07:35.300 --> 01:07:36.540
&gt;&gt;Tavis Smiley: No, no.

01:07:36.540 --> 01:07:38.100
Thank you for your question.

01:07:38.100 --> 01:07:40.270
&gt;&gt;Female #2: Hi, my name is Nava.

01:07:40.270 --> 01:07:42.130
Thank you both for being here.

01:07:42.130 --> 01:07:48.020
I, Dr. West, you referenced the prison system
earlier in your conversation and I'm just

01:07:48.020 --> 01:07:50.650
curious to find out your insights around the
connection between poverty and prison.

01:07:50.650 --> 01:07:51.650
&gt;&gt;Cornel West: Ah.

01:07:51.650 --> 01:07:57.480
&gt;&gt;Female #2: and if you think that a major
overhaul of the prison industrial complex

01:07:57.480 --> 01:07:58.480
is necessary.

01:07:58.480 --> 01:07:59.480
If so, why?

01:07:59.480 --> 01:08:00.660
&gt;&gt;Cornel West: Well, I appreciate the question.

01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:03.990
When we make reference to that magnificent
text by our dear sister Michelle Alexander,

01:08:03.990 --> 01:08:04.990
"The New Jim Crow."

01:08:04.990 --> 01:08:07.790
And I was actually blessed to write a forward
to the paperback.

01:08:07.790 --> 01:08:10.060
It provides a full fledged answer to your
question.

01:08:10.060 --> 01:08:15.810
It has something to do with the war on drugs
and why it is that the war on drugs is disproportionately

01:08:15.810 --> 01:08:16.980
targeting chocolate sides of town.

01:08:16.980 --> 01:08:22.859
13 percent of young white brothers and sisters
on the vanilla side fly high in the friendly

01:08:22.859 --> 01:08:23.859
skies.

01:08:23.859 --> 01:08:26.929
13 percent of black and brown fly high in
the friendly skies.

01:08:26.929 --> 01:08:28.579
62 percent of convictions, chocolate.

01:08:28.579 --> 01:08:29.579
Black.

01:08:29.579 --> 01:08:30.579
Brown.

01:08:30.579 --> 01:08:31.579
Poor.

01:08:31.579 --> 01:08:32.579
You see.

01:08:32.579 --> 01:08:36.229
And so you go from 300,000 about 30 years
ago to two point four million today.

01:08:36.229 --> 01:08:37.229
And again.

01:08:37.229 --> 01:08:39.460
Not just a matter of priority but socially
neglected.

01:08:39.460 --> 01:08:40.460
Economically abandoned.

01:08:40.460 --> 01:08:41.460
Under intense police surveillance.

01:08:41.460 --> 01:08:43.179
That's black and brown poor people.

01:08:43.179 --> 01:08:45.650
Not even black and brown middle class people.

01:08:45.650 --> 01:08:50.349
'Cause we know Jack and Jill black brothers
and sisters going to jail the same level as

01:08:50.349 --> 01:08:53.209
Jamal and Latisha on the ground, the poor.

01:08:53.209 --> 01:08:55.449
We have different kind of black leadership.

01:08:55.449 --> 01:09:00.039
And I love my Jack and Jill brothers, don't
get me wrong.

01:09:00.039 --> 01:09:02.809
But it's the class question.

01:09:02.809 --> 01:09:06.089
How deep is your love for poor people?

01:09:06.089 --> 01:09:07.509
No matter what color.

01:09:07.509 --> 01:09:12.319
And think about an America, in terms of our
priorities.

01:09:12.319 --> 01:09:19.170
I mean we have come up with now these drones
that can drop bombs on people all around the

01:09:19.170 --> 01:09:20.170
world.

01:09:20.170 --> 01:09:21.170
Zero in.

01:09:21.170 --> 01:09:23.959
Try to keep track of the terrorists.

01:09:23.959 --> 01:09:27.319
Sometimes you hit the daughter and son.

01:09:27.319 --> 01:09:28.319
That's wrong.

01:09:28.319 --> 01:09:29.319
Wife.

01:09:29.319 --> 01:09:30.319
That's wrong.

01:09:30.319 --> 01:09:34.060
But you know how much goes into being able
to generate that kind of unmanned aerial vehicle?

01:09:34.060 --> 01:09:39.929
And yet when it comes to dealing with poverty
or reform the prison industrial complex.

01:09:39.929 --> 01:09:40.929
Lower priority.

01:09:40.929 --> 01:09:42.790
Not on the radar screen.

01:09:42.790 --> 01:09:44.650
You're gonna lose your democracy.

01:09:44.650 --> 01:09:48.519
We have the wrong things on the radar screen.

01:09:48.519 --> 01:09:49.539
That's part of our challenge.

01:09:49.539 --> 01:09:55.610
&gt;&gt;Tavis Smiley: If I could add to that real
quick, I was thinking as Doc was talking.

01:09:55.610 --> 01:09:59.360
Again about how important context is to all
of this.

01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:04.550
Again, the first chapter of this book, Stacy,
lays out a portrait of poverty.

01:10:04.550 --> 01:10:05.550
How we arrived at this place.

01:10:05.550 --> 01:10:10.119
And in this moment, even when there's someone
in the White House, and Doc and I are very

01:10:10.119 --> 01:10:11.559
clear in this book.

01:10:11.559 --> 01:10:17.440
We think that President Obama is far better
than any alternative on the Right on these

01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:18.440
issues.

01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:19.650
We're gonna keep pushing him.

01:10:19.650 --> 01:10:28.610
But he's far better than any alternative that
we see at the moment in the race.

01:10:28.610 --> 01:10:30.760
That's our own assessment we've made.

01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:32.909
And you may see that differently.

01:10:32.909 --> 01:10:37.499
But we lay that out in this, in the book and
say that unapologetically.

01:10:37.499 --> 01:10:40.559
Having said that, it's important to understand
that whether we're talking about people we

01:10:40.559 --> 01:10:44.350
regard as our enemies, people who are pushing
an agenda that's antithetical to the best

01:10:44.350 --> 01:10:51.489
interests of poor people, or we're talking
about persons we regard as our friends, we

01:10:51.489 --> 01:10:52.760
have to remain vigilant.

01:10:52.760 --> 01:10:55.469
Holding them accountable to the best interest
of the least among us.

01:10:55.469 --> 01:10:56.469
Case in point.

01:10:56.469 --> 01:11:01.320
I was on Bill Maher this Friday night on his
real time HBO show.

01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:03.499
And Bill and I had a conversation about this.

01:11:03.499 --> 01:11:07.780
So when you talk about the prison industrial
complex that Nava asked about with Dr. West.

01:11:07.780 --> 01:11:11.869
The most damning thing that's happened to
poor people since Ronald Reagan and that nonsensical

01:11:11.869 --> 01:11:13.269
so called war on drugs.

01:11:13.269 --> 01:11:14.559
Reagan a Republican obviously.

01:11:14.559 --> 01:11:20.599
But the worst thing since then was a Democrat
named Bill Clinton.

01:11:20.599 --> 01:11:22.800
And Bill Clinton is my friend.

01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:27.079
I know he ain't going to be happy when he
hears me say this.

01:11:27.079 --> 01:11:28.940
But he's heard me say it before.

01:11:28.940 --> 01:11:35.449
The most racist law that Bill Clinton ever
signed into, bill he ever signed into law,

01:11:35.449 --> 01:11:36.449
was the crime bill.

01:11:36.449 --> 01:11:42.090
Where you, we made as a part of the law the
fact that you had to get caught with 100 times

01:11:42.090 --> 01:11:44.519
more powdered cocaine, this is what Doc was
suggesting.

01:11:44.519 --> 01:11:50.150
You gotta get caught with 100 times more powdered
cocaine than crack cocaine to get the same

01:11:50.150 --> 01:11:51.150
sentence.

01:11:51.150 --> 01:11:54.690
100 times more powdered cocaine than crack
to get the same sentence.

01:11:54.690 --> 01:11:57.829
We signed that into law during the Clinton
administration.

01:11:57.829 --> 01:11:58.889
Negros was celebrating.

01:11:58.889 --> 01:11:59.889
We all loved Bill Clinton.

01:11:59.889 --> 01:12:01.900
He'd come to our churches and sing "We shall
overcome."

01:12:01.900 --> 01:12:02.900
Know all the verses.

01:12:02.900 --> 01:12:03.900
[laughter]

01:12:03.900 --> 01:12:04.900
Verses, chorus, everything else.

01:12:04.900 --> 01:12:07.920
I've stood with Clinton many times and when
the Negro national anthem, "Lift every voice

01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:08.920
and sing" is sung.

01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:10.210
He knows all the verses.

01:12:10.210 --> 01:12:11.619
I know the first.

01:12:11.619 --> 01:12:15.550
But he knows all the verses to "Lift every
voice and sing."

01:12:15.550 --> 01:12:16.550
[laughter]

01:12:16.550 --> 01:12:22.449
So he's a friend of the black community and
I love him and I'm not trying to demonize

01:12:22.449 --> 01:12:24.080
him or cast aspersions.

01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:28.489
I'm just saying that these politicians are
not perfect.

01:12:28.489 --> 01:12:33.979
And even when they're our friends we have
to remain vigilant and diligent about holding

01:12:33.979 --> 01:12:34.979
them accountable.

01:12:34.979 --> 01:12:36.179
So that was a horrible law that Bill Clinton
signed.

01:12:36.179 --> 01:12:43.300
And so you know, we've had to deal with that
for all these years so so many of the consequences

01:12:43.300 --> 01:12:49.920
that Nava was asking about and Doc responded
to had to do with this crime bill that we

01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:54.519
let Bill Clinton and Congress get away with
signing during his term.

01:12:54.519 --> 01:12:55.999
That's on the prison industrial complex.

01:12:55.999 --> 01:12:58.619
Back to poverty, women and children falling
faster into poverty I've said now for the

01:12:58.619 --> 01:12:59.880
fifth time than any other group in our society.

01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:00.880
Why is that Tavis?

01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:01.880
Well, that is the case in part because 15
years ago Bill Clinton signed a so-called

01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:02.880
"welfare reform" bill.

01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:03.880
We refer to it as a welfare "deform" bill.

01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:04.880
But he signed a welfare reform bill.

01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:05.880
His intent was to move women from welfare
to work.

01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:06.880
That's not exactly what's happened.

01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:07.880
And now without going into all the particulars,
you see the exact opposite.

01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:08.880
Where women don't have access to work and
they don't have access to the welfare to give

01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:09.880
their children food to eat and medical care.

01:13:09.880 --> 01:13:10.880
They don't have access to that program anymore.

01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:11.880
'Cause we slashed the program so bad and changed
the rules and regulations 15 years ago.

01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:12.880
Peter Edelman, the husband of Marion Wright
Edelman that Dr. West referenced earlier has

01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:13.880
a wonderful book coming out a few weeks from
now, behind ours.

01:13:13.880 --> 01:13:14.880
Called "So Rich, So Poor."

01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:15.880
Peter Edelman famously resigned his high position
in the Clinton Administration in protest over

01:13:15.880 --> 01:13:16.880
that law.

01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:17.880
Peter Edelman and myself and Dr. West and
others were saying then, "This is going to

01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:18.880
be bad for the country."

01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:19.880
Took us 15 years to finally get to the point
now where the analysis and the data has been

01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:20.880
done.

01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:21.880
It didn't quite work out.

01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:22.880
The New York Times last Sunday.

01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:23.880
Sunday before last.

01:13:23.880 --> 01:13:24.880
Front page, above the fold.

01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:27.139
Major story, the New York Times.

01:13:27.139 --> 01:13:34.770
15 years later, look at the carnage that's
been done as a result of that welfare bill.

01:13:34.770 --> 01:13:36.179
This was a guy who we liked.

01:13:36.179 --> 01:13:37.659
A guy who we supported and voted for and loved
and held hands with and sang "Kumbayah."

01:13:37.659 --> 01:13:38.719
And he did a lot of wonderful things, don't
get me wrong.

01:13:38.719 --> 01:13:39.719
But I'm just saying, again, making the point.

01:13:39.719 --> 01:13:40.719
You gotta stay vigilant.

01:13:40.719 --> 01:13:41.719
Even when they are your friends.

01:13:41.719 --> 01:13:42.719
Even when they are of your political persuasion.

01:13:42.719 --> 01:13:43.719
Even you are supporting them, and giving them
your money and giving them your vote and campaigning

01:13:43.719 --> 01:13:44.719
for them.

01:13:44.719 --> 01:13:45.719
You still gotta stay on 'em.

01:13:45.719 --> 01:13:46.719
Because left to their own devices and the
people around them, they won't measure up.

01:13:46.719 --> 01:13:47.719
And that's why, in this era, poverty again
is the issue of our time.

01:13:47.719 --> 01:13:48.719
That we have to address, no matter who's in
the White House.

01:13:48.719 --> 01:13:50.449
No matter who's running things on Capitol
Hill.

01:13:50.449 --> 01:13:52.280
But I thought about that when you went into
that dissertation because, it's you know,

01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:55.079
so much of this is about chickens coming home
to roost.

01:13:55.079 --> 01:13:56.079
Years later.

01:13:56.079 --> 01:13:57.150
And that's why poverty's just run amuck.

01:13:57.150 --> 01:13:58.150
But anyway, I digress.

01:13:58.150 --> 01:14:02.449
&gt;&gt;Stacy: So before we take this last question
from the audience, I wanna go a little bit

01:14:02.449 --> 01:14:03.630
deeper on that.

01:14:03.630 --> 01:14:06.010
'cause you bring up this concept.

01:14:06.010 --> 01:14:07.900
And this is what you're getting at.

01:14:07.900 --> 01:14:08.900
This fundamental fairness.

01:14:08.900 --> 01:14:09.900
&gt;&gt;Cornel West: Mm.

01:14:09.900 --> 01:14:10.900
Yes.

01:14:10.900 --> 01:14:11.900
&gt;&gt;Tavis Smiley: Yes.

01:14:11.900 --> 01:14:13.960
&gt;&gt;Stacy: So there's an inequity and there
needs to be a shift.

01:14:13.960 --> 01:14:17.530
And talk about what that shift means and who
should be responsible for that shift.

01:14:17.530 --> 01:14:18.530
Talk about lobbying.

01:14:18.530 --> 01:14:19.530
And organizations.

01:14:19.530 --> 01:14:20.530
Talk about what this fairness looks like.

01:14:20.530 --> 01:14:21.530
Is it motherhood and apple pie?

01:14:21.530 --> 01:14:22.530
Or is it real?

01:14:22.530 --> 01:14:23.599
&gt;&gt;Cornel West: I think it has to do with courage.

01:14:23.599 --> 01:14:24.789
And taking a risk.

01:14:24.789 --> 01:14:26.889
We need more non-conformity in the culture.

01:14:26.889 --> 01:14:27.889
&gt;&gt;Tavis Smiley: Ah.

01:14:27.889 --> 01:14:32.130
&gt;&gt;Cornel West: 'Cause we live in a culture
where everything is up for sale.

01:14:32.130 --> 01:14:33.380
Everybody's up for sale.

01:14:33.380 --> 01:14:35.309
Things like integrity and dignity and magnanimity
ought to be beyond any kind of market price.

01:14:35.309 --> 01:14:36.510
But if the conformity is so powerful that
people are just fearful of telling the truth

01:14:36.510 --> 01:14:39.639
and bearing witness, because they're concerned
about careers rather than their callings.

01:14:39.639 --> 01:14:41.469
Or their professions rather than their vocations.

01:14:41.469 --> 01:14:46.400
Then you lose any source for the democratic
awakening that needs to take place.

01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:47.400
'cause again, this is a citizen's affair.

01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:48.400
And again, we speak as citizens.

01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:49.400
We're citizens in democratic experiment.

01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:50.400
We're concerned about its imperial side.

01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:51.400
We're concerned about its racist, sexist and
classist side.

01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:52.400
And homophobic side.

01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:53.400
Anti-Semitic side.

01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:54.400
Anti-Arab, anti-Muslim side.

01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:55.400
But we know there's some good folk and some
good things in the democratic experiment.

01:14:55.400 --> 01:14:56.400
That's what we stand for you see.

01:14:56.400 --> 01:14:57.400
And there's always jazz and the blues.

01:14:57.400 --> 01:14:58.400
Which is always comforting.

01:14:58.400 --> 01:14:59.400
And Bruce Springsteen out there.

01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:00.400
You know, the white blues brother out there
doing his magnificent thing with wrecking

01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:01.400
balls.

01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:02.400
But what we're saying is that if we don't
give this a sense of urgency, then just like

01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:03.400
1861, lose your democracy.

01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:04.400
Unless folk came through.

01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:05.400
Just like 1930s, you lose it.

01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:06.400
1960s, you can lose it.

01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:07.400
Each time we were able to come through strongly.

01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:08.400
Can we come through this time?

01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:09.400
It's very much up to the younger generation.

01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:10.400
I'm old-school.

01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:11.400
I'm old-school.

01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:12.400
He's old-school.

01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:13.400
[laughter]

01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:14.400
You all.

01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:15.400
Many of you are new-school.

01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:16.400
Its' a beautiful thing to see.

01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:17.400
I'm not discriminating against the older brothers
and sister of all color.

01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:18.400
Here with the grey.

01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:19.400
[laughter]

01:15:19.400 --> 01:15:20.400
But it's going to be a younger generation
affair.

01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:21.400
And that's when we say who, they're gonna
lead us very much like the best of Occupy.

01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:22.400
I know he's got a question.

01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:23.400
&gt;&gt;Stacy: Alright.

01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:24.400
Last question.

01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:25.400
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Alright.

01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:26.400
Great.

01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:27.400
Well thank you both for being here.

01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:28.400
My name is Daniel Sanderson.

01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:29.400
And you both made a lot of keen, poignant
points about poverty.

01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:30.400
Particularly with respect to new poverty.

01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:31.400
And how that will or can threaten our democracy
in the future.

01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:32.400
I guess what I'd like to hear a little bit
more about is, are there particular aspects

01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:33.400
of our democracy that you feel are especially
threatened?

01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:34.400
Is it the right to vote?

01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:35.400
Is it something like political stability?

01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:36.400
What are your thoughts on that?

01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:37.400
&gt;&gt;Cornel West: You wanna respond for that?

01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:38.400
&gt;&gt;Tavis Smiley: Well, I think it's all of
the above.

01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:39.400
It's more of a smorgasbord for me.

01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:40.400
&gt;&gt;Cornel West: it's a good question.

01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:41.400
&gt;&gt;Tavis Smiley: it's a very good question.

01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:42.400
&gt;&gt;Cornel West: Yeah.

01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:43.400
&gt;&gt;Tavis Smiley: At the moment, since you raised
it.

01:15:43.400 --> 01:15:44.400
The voting rights of people of color and poor
people are particularly threatened.

01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:45.400
I'm glad to see that there is some conversation
about this on the radio and on the television.

01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:46.400
And some persons have been out front about
this.

01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:47.400
And we talk about this on our radio program,
Smiley and West as well.

01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:48.400
But that does concern me.

01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:49.400
Particularly because we are in an election
year.

01:15:49.400 --> 01:15:50.400
The persons who are being targeted.

01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:51.400
The persons who are having to jump through
all kinds of hoops.

01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:52.400
Republicans, and I'm not trying to cast aspersion,
these are Republican sponsored bills.

01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:53.400
Those are the facts.

01:15:53.400 --> 01:15:54.400
Across the country where they're trying to
deny and take away and make the hurdle so

01:15:54.400 --> 01:15:55.400
high for you to get into a booth just to cast
your vote.

01:15:55.400 --> 01:15:56.400
There's a reason why there, these policies,
programs, and bills are becoming laws in certain

01:15:56.400 --> 01:15:57.400
states.

01:15:57.400 --> 01:15:58.400
Impacting certain communities.

01:15:58.400 --> 01:15:59.400
And we all know what we're talking about here.

01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:00.400
So that's one aspect that does particularly
concern me.

01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:01.400
We raised that issue in the text.

01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:02.400
But it is so fascinating and again, we're
out of time here.

01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:03.400
But there's so many issues that we raise in
the book.

01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:04.400
Where you can just see how the body politic
punishes, demonizes, criminalizes poor people.

01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:05.400
And it's again, about highlighting those things.

01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:06.400
About being aggressive in pushing back on
those things.

01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:07.400
But for me, I'll let Doc give his own answer.

01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:08.400
But for me at the moment, of the list you
just mentioned, the thing that I'm most concerned

01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:09.400
about, again given where we are right now,
is this attack on voting rights in this country.

01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:10.400
That is a particular aspect of democracy that
poor people are being particularly punished

01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:11.400
by.

01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:12.400
That legislation is not just, it's punitive
and pejorative where poor people are concerned.

01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:13.400
&gt;&gt;Cornel West: Yes and I'm concerned about
the moral and spiritual dimension of our democracy.

01:16:13.400 --> 01:16:14.400
You see, when citizens feel as if they're
hopeless and helpless, impotent, that they

01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:15.400
donít make a difference, that the public
interest is defined in such a way that nobody

01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:16.400
really cares about their suffering.

01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:17.400
Or their wounds and their bruises.

01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:18.400
That's the history of black folk for a long
time.

01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:19.400
Right?

01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:20.400
In the body politic, but civically dead.

01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:21.400
No real rights.

01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:22.400
Nobody respect.

01:16:22.400 --> 01:16:23.400
Right.

01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:24.400
That you say, "Well, how can a democracy survive
when you have large numbers and not just black

01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:25.400
folk now.

01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:26.400
We're talking about poor folk across the board,
you see.

01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:27.400
They don't make a difference?"

01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:28.400
Well, that reinforces narcissism, addiction,
self medication, escape.

01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:29.400
All of the various forms of mass culture.

01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:30.400
And all the little tricky techniques of trying
to get people pacified.

01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:31.400
Because their pain is so overwhelming and
they figure they can do very little about

01:16:31.400 --> 01:16:32.400
it.

01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:33.400
Alcoholism.

01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:34.400
Sex addiction.

01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:35.400
We go on and on and on as ways people have
to deal with their wounds.

01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:36.400
When people feel as if they can't really have
an impact on their world.

01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:37.400
They can't lift their voices as they were,
as it were.

01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:38.400
That's very dangerous.

01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:39.400
That's very very dangerous.

01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:40.400
And I think part of the prophetic tradition
that we try to enact in our own feeble way

01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:41.400
is to call, make a call for the kind of awakening.
