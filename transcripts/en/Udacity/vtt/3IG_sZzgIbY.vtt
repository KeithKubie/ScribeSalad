I'll sum up some of the major concepts we've covered. First of all WebGL and

00:00:03.672 --> 00:00:08.798
THREE.JS matrices are in column order. With column order matrices we record the

00:00:08.798 --> 00:00:13.206
transforms to the object from right to left. We apply the frame of reference

00:00:13.206 --> 00:00:17.496
from left to right. Matrices themselves are associative. You can multiply

00:00:17.496 --> 00:00:21.634
whichever two neighboring matrices you want in whatever order you want. Finally

00:00:21.634 --> 00:00:26.575
matrices are not commutative. That means matrix ordered does matter. Well I

00:00:26.575 --> 00:00:30.988
should say matrix order usually matters. Sometimes for example if you have a

00:00:30.988 --> 00:00:34.905
series of translations in a row you can do the translations in any order. Now

00:00:34.905 --> 00:00:38.590
that you know a lot about transforms I recommend poking around in documentation

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.178
and reading through all functions available for vectors and matrices. More

00:00:42.178 --> 00:00:46.422
important still go and try them out. Take a three.js program of any sort and

00:00:46.422 --> 00:00:50.329
mess with it. Change things and see what happens. Having java script, an

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:54.617
interpretive language with a built in debugger makes it easy to dig in and see

00:00:54.617 --> 00:00:56.793
what all sorts of programs are doing.
