00:00:00.511 --> 00:00:02.380
- [Voiceover] In the
video where we introduced

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:06.153
the alternating series test,
we in fact used the series,

00:00:06.153 --> 00:00:09.357
we used the infinite
series from n equals one

00:00:09.357 --> 00:00:12.039
to infinity of negative one,

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:15.231
to the n plus one over n.

00:00:15.231 --> 00:00:17.611
We used this as our example

00:00:17.611 --> 00:00:19.852
to apply the alternating series test,

00:00:19.852 --> 00:00:22.719
and we proved that this thing
right over here converges.

00:00:22.719 --> 00:00:25.215
So this series, which is one,

00:00:27.486 --> 00:00:31.206
minus 1/2, plus 1/3,

00:00:31.206 --> 00:00:33.634
minus 1/4, and it just keeps

00:00:33.634 --> 00:00:36.065
going on and on and on forever.

00:00:36.065 --> 00:00:39.070
We used the alternating
series test in that video

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.044
to prove that it converges.

00:00:41.044 --> 00:00:43.308
So this thing converges.

00:00:43.308 --> 00:00:47.324
So this converges by

00:00:47.324 --> 00:00:49.669
alternating series test.

00:00:58.067 --> 00:01:01.699
Alternating series test, and
if you wanna review that,

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:04.242
go watch the video on the
alternating series test.

00:01:04.242 --> 00:01:06.161
Now let's think a little bit
about what happens if we were

00:01:06.161 --> 00:01:08.947
to take the absolute value
of each of these terms.

00:01:08.947 --> 00:01:10.533
So if we were to take the absolute value

00:01:10.533 --> 00:01:13.133
of each of these terms, so
if you were to take the sum

00:01:13.133 --> 00:01:17.498
from n equals one to infinity
of the absolute value

00:01:17.498 --> 00:01:20.412
of negative one to the

00:01:20.412 --> 00:01:23.210
n plus one over n,

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.578
well what is this going to be equal to?

00:01:25.578 --> 00:01:28.097
Well, this numerator is either gonna be

00:01:28.097 --> 00:01:29.897
one or negative one, the
absolute value of that

00:01:29.897 --> 00:01:32.300
is always gonna be one, so
it's going to be that over.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.098
And n is always positive, we're
going from one to infinity,

00:01:35.098 --> 00:01:38.174
so it's just going to be equal to the sum,

00:01:38.174 --> 00:01:41.945
it's going to be equal to
the sum from n equals one

00:01:41.945 --> 00:01:45.265
to infinity of one over n.

00:01:45.265 --> 00:01:47.773
And this is just the
famous harmonic series.

00:01:47.773 --> 00:01:49.769
And there's this video that we have,

00:01:49.769 --> 00:01:51.430
and you should look it up on Khan Academy

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.972
if you don't believe
me, on the famous proof

00:01:53.972 --> 00:01:56.131
that the harmonic series diverges.

00:01:56.131 --> 00:01:58.766
So the harmonic series is one plus 1/2,

00:01:58.766 --> 00:02:01.843
plus 1/3, this thing right over here,

00:02:01.843 --> 00:02:06.231
this thing right over here diverges.

00:02:06.231 --> 00:02:10.224
And so when you see a
series that converges,

00:02:10.224 --> 00:02:12.593
but if you were to take the absolute value

00:02:12.593 --> 00:02:15.611
of each of its terms,
and then that diverges,

00:02:15.611 --> 00:02:19.012
we say that this series
converges conditionally.

00:02:20.622 --> 00:02:22.758
You can say it converges,
but you could also

00:02:22.758 --> 00:02:25.126
say it converges conditionally.

00:02:26.933 --> 00:02:28.616
And the condition is,
I guess you could say,

00:02:28.616 --> 00:02:30.288
that we're not taking the absolute value

00:02:30.288 --> 00:02:31.751
of each of the terms.

00:02:31.751 --> 00:02:35.431
And if something converges when

00:02:35.431 --> 00:02:37.195
you take the absolute value as well,

00:02:37.195 --> 00:02:39.726
then you say it converges absolutely.

00:02:39.726 --> 00:02:41.491
And so let's look at an example of that.

00:02:41.491 --> 00:02:43.126
If I were to take...

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.989
This series, let's do a geometric series,

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:51.567
that might be fun.

00:02:51.567 --> 00:02:53.750
Actually I'm using these colors too much,

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.375
let me use another color.

00:02:55.375 --> 00:02:59.113
Let's say, let's take the sum

00:02:59.113 --> 00:03:02.584
from n equals one to infinity of

00:03:02.584 --> 00:03:06.926
negative 1/2 to

00:03:06.926 --> 00:03:10.409
the n plus one power.

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:12.870
We know this is a geometric series

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.203
where the absolute value
of our common ratio

00:03:15.203 --> 00:03:18.268
is less than one, we
know that this converges.

00:03:21.774 --> 00:03:23.434
And if we were to take the absolute value

00:03:23.434 --> 00:03:26.197
of each of these terms, so
if you were to take the sum,

00:03:26.197 --> 00:03:27.811
Let me do that in a different color,

00:03:27.811 --> 00:03:30.597
just to mix things up a little bit.

00:03:30.597 --> 00:03:33.917
If you were to take the absolute value

00:03:33.917 --> 00:03:36.610
of each of these terms,
so the absolute value

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.234
of negative 1/2,

00:03:42.484 --> 00:03:45.596
to the n plus one power,

00:03:45.596 --> 00:03:48.962
this is going to be the
same thing as the sum,

00:03:48.962 --> 00:03:52.515
from n equals one

00:03:52.515 --> 00:03:55.823
to infinity of 1/2

00:03:55.823 --> 00:03:58.157
to the n plus one.

00:03:58.157 --> 00:04:00.861
And here once again, the common ratio,

00:04:00.861 --> 00:04:03.334
the absolute value of the
common ratio is less than one,

00:04:03.334 --> 00:04:04.762
and we've studied this when we looked

00:04:04.762 --> 00:04:06.097
at geometric series.

00:04:06.097 --> 00:04:08.256
This also converges.

00:04:09.924 --> 00:04:11.805
So when we took the
absolute value of the terms,

00:04:11.805 --> 00:04:13.349
it still converged.

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:15.926
So for this one, we can
say that this converges

00:04:15.926 --> 00:04:18.524
absolutely.

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.322
So we've talked a lot already

00:04:22.322 --> 00:04:24.807
about convergence or divergence,

00:04:24.807 --> 00:04:26.304
and that's all been good.

00:04:26.304 --> 00:04:27.546
And what we're doing in this video is

00:04:27.546 --> 00:04:30.901
we're introducing a nuance
or flavors of convergence.

00:04:30.901 --> 00:04:33.699
So you can converge, but it
might be interesting to say

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:36.160
well, would it still converge if we

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.087
took the absolute value of the terms?

00:04:38.087 --> 00:04:40.409
If it won't, if you converge,
but it doesn't converge

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:42.209
when you take the absolute
value of the terms,

00:04:42.209 --> 00:04:44.623
then you say it converges conditionally.

00:04:44.623 --> 00:04:47.584
If it converges, and
it still converges when

00:04:47.584 --> 00:04:49.604
you take the absolute value of the terms,

00:04:49.604 --> 00:04:52.517
then we say it converges absolutely.

00:04:52.517 --> 00:04:53.980
Because even if you
take the absolute value

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.197
of the terms, it converges.

00:04:56.197 --> 00:04:58.645
Hopefully you find that interesting.
