In the past we've published many videos on toxic family dynamics, and some of you have requested

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.129
that we explore toxic sibling relationships.

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:21.370
Our goal is to spread awareness of family dysfunctions and make this difficult topic more approachable.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:28.119
We know that many of our community members are young and may be experiencing domestic trouble.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.979
If you're in a situation where you cannot leave your dysfunctional household just yet,

00:00:33.109 --> 00:00:40.359
we pray for your safety and want you to know that you can receive help from professionals. In our description box below

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:46.599
we've provided some helpful resources that may come in handy such as the National Domestic Violence hotline.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:53.139
Remember: your priority is to keep yourself safe. And these resources can help you do just that.

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:57.729
Here are 5 types of unhealthy sibling relationships.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:06.250
One: the golden child and the scapegoat. These types of siblings often grow up with a parent who is either a narcissist,

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.780
sociopath or a psychopath.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.229
The golden child is the parent's favorite because they mirror their values, beliefs and habits.

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:20.798
The parent thinks in black and white and considers this child the good one. Since the parent lacks empathy

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:28.239
themselves, the golden child does too. They were never yelled at nor punished for treating others with the same cruelty,

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:30.639
so they assume it's correct behavior.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.250
Unlike the golden child the scapegoat learns to question the parent's black and white thinking,

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:43.869
refusing to follow their illusions. They may be quietly rebellious and seek perspectives other than what their parent enforces.

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.610
Consequently, the scapegoat is seen as the bad one in the parent's eyes.

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:56.559
The scapegoat learns to be empathetic because whenever they challenge the parent's thinking they are reprimanded and told to be more understanding,

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:05.199
while the golden child repeats the same toxic patterns as the parent just to get along, the scapegoat tends to break them and

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.339
searches for a more meaningful life after they leave the family.

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:18.099
Two: the royal brat and the wise owl. The royal brat is spoiled by the parents. They learn to get their way by being loud,

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:26.169
manipulative and stubborn. The parents usually give in to their tantrums and are more concerned with pleasing them and protecting them from

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:34.059
difficult emotions. Consequently, the royal brat never learns how to work through their impulses, anger nor sadness.

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:41.019
Meanwhile, the wise owl is the complete opposite of the royal brat. The wise owl is mature,

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:43.629
responsible and level-headed.

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:47.139
Since the royal brat always gets their way without having to lift a finger,

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.219
the wise owl has to achieve the same results through hard work.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.699
The royal brat tries to take the easy way out by pushing the wise owl to do things for them.

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:00.519
But the wise owl refuses to yield.

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:09.069
Consequently, the royal brat gives the wise owl a hard time. Whether the royal brat lacks emotional maturity, the wise owl is

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:11.319
disciplined and reliable.

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:18.758
Three: the bully and the victim. This relationship is similar to that of a dominant parent and a submissive child

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:24.219
but happens in siblings instead. The bully in this scenario often has a challenging

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.779
relationship with a parent and feels like they have no control over anything.

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:35.589
So they learn to be a bully and take out their anger and frustrations on their sibling instead.

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:42.189
Usually their younger one who becomes the victim. The bully wants to come across as tough and

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:49.659
intimidating so they make the victim feel small and helpless by abusing them emotionally, verbally and/or physically.

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:57.099
Four: the addict and the enabler. This codependent type of relationship is propelled by an enabler

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:02.829
who acts as a caretaker for an impaired sibling who usually struggles with addiction or mental

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:06.008
illness. The enabler protects and takes responsibility

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:12.909
for their sibling because they feel like their relationship or even their lives will fall apart if they don't.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.489
They often think they are looking out for them when they justify their actions, but in reality,

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.410
it's only hurting the addict in the long run when their problem isn't confronted.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:30.400
Often the addict and enabler already have parents who play similar roles so they learn to mirror them.

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:38.650
Five: the ghost and the hungry child. The ghost is someone who is emotionally distant from their whole family in general.

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:45.309
They don't know how to cope with the chaos that happens every day behind closed doors, so they fade into the background.

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:53.320
Meanwhile, the hungry child always longs to get a little closer to the ghost. They lack love and support from the family as a whole

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:59.679
and yearn for someone to hold on to. The hungry child often hopes to find love from their sibling,

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.699
but in the end they're usually left with an empty void once again.

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:08.410
So, the hungry child searches for love elsewhere, outside their home.

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:15.429
