00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:04.890
Advice, exotic pets. Uh, Bill,

2
00:00:04.891 --> 00:00:08.970
last week I was laid off from my office cubicle job of four years.

3
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.520
I am now a 25 year old unemployed college student truck struggling to make rent.

4
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.640
Ah, Jesus, my heart goes out to your brother, but Alicia, 25,

5
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.010
you're not fucking married. You don't have any kids. That's the bright side.

6
00:00:20.011 --> 00:00:21.300
And I know you don't need to hear that.

7
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.063
<v 1>All right.</v>

8
00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:25.551
<v 0>All right. Here we go.</v>

9
00:00:25.551 --> 00:00:30.260
Can't go back to my parents as they are halfway across the planet in Taiwan.

10
00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:32.840
Now my question is, do I continue to,

11
00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.060
do I continue trying to get back in the rat race or do I follow my dream of

12
00:00:38.061 --> 00:00:41.600
becoming an exotic pet reptile breeder?

13
00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.060
Jesus Christ. I had a fucked away. Are you just fucking with me?

14
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.220
This is your dream. Well, you know what you are from Taiwan.

15
00:00:50.221 --> 00:00:53.130
I imagine everything that's considered exotic over here is like nothing.

16
00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.343
<v 1>You know,</v>

17
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.460
<v 0>I bet over in Taiwan, instead of getting like a bicycle as a four year old,</v>

18
00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.590
they give you like a defanged Cobra or some shit. Um,

19
00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.490
I'm sorry, I just had to stop and laugh. At the ignorance of that statement. Um,

20
00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.310
anyways, I have no experience in the field. Fantastic.

21
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.470
You're going to be on spike TV's a thousand ways to die except okay.

22
00:01:21.471 --> 00:01:25.400
Except that, okay. I have no experience in the field except for that.

23
00:01:25.401 --> 00:01:29.120
I have a snake in four hamsters as pets.

24
00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.990
All right, dude. I don't want to burst your bubble,

25
00:01:32.991 --> 00:01:35.360
but there's nothing exotic about hamsters.

26
00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.160
Even if you have four or quatro. Sorry,

27
00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.440
I started the new fucking Rosetta stone. Spanish again.

28
00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.130
You'll dangle on paddle. It's Greece.

29
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.300
A Blanco Barrow is Wayno is local.

30
00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.290
A local hover the fuck you sit my dogs out of its mind. I'm

31
00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.550
lambo hair. I'm on Santa there. There,

32
00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.840
uh, I've been, let's get back to this shit.

33
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.820
They guy just said the woman and then Green Apple.

34
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.390
There's really nothing that connected either one of those. I go, fuck yourself.

35
00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.060
I'm going to do it. Some point in my life I'm gonna become bilingual.

36
00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.320
So anyways, he still wants to start raising exotic pets, breeding them.

37
00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.320
He has no experience. Now what kind of fucking snake do you have?

38
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.320
You know, if you have a garden snake gardeners now,

39
00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.660
I guess you got to start somewhere.

40
00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.890
You do have a reptile and a four little rat thinks this is cool,

41
00:02:36.441 --> 00:02:38.870
dude. You know what you're doing. You're doing like the open mics of this.

42
00:02:38.871 --> 00:02:40.730
I get it. You've got to start slow.

43
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.220
You can't start right with the Black Mamba going to get yourself killed.

44
00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:47.301
Anyways, he said,

45
00:02:47.301 --> 00:02:51.350
I've been to the reptile expo a couple of times and saw that vendor's there just

46
00:02:51.351 --> 00:02:55.250
breed and sell snakes for a living and thought to myself, Holy Shit,

47
00:02:55.251 --> 00:02:56.084
I want to do that.

48
00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.870
Encourage animals to bang and sell offspring all from my own apartment.

49
00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.510
Living the dream. What to do. Any advice? Uh,

50
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.880
what gave you the balls to start stand up? Um,

51
00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.650
understanding the opportunity cost of the income of a full time job. Uh,

52
00:03:14.651 --> 00:03:17.650
any advice would help. Thanks Mr. Bird. All right.

53
00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:21.660
All right. What do you do here? Well, dude, you're,

54
00:03:21.661 --> 00:03:26.370
you're doing the right thing. You're basically like, you go into one of those,

55
00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.300
uh, reptile expos and looking at the douchebags there when it, and being like,

56
00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:31.290
I could fucking do that.

57
00:03:31.291 --> 00:03:34.200
Was like me when I used to watch some of those standup shows and be like,

58
00:03:34.201 --> 00:03:36.660
I'm funnier than this guy. All right?

59
00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.140
And you have the luxury of not having a job right now,

60
00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.600
so you don't have to worry about, you know, well,

61
00:03:42.601 --> 00:03:46.500
what if this interferes with my job? You don't have a fucking job. Um,

62
00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.550
your biggest thing right now, dude, is you need income. Alright?

63
00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.770
So I would continue looking for a job that is flexible.

64
00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.740
All right? While you start building your stockpile of, uh, reptiles,

65
00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.370
first thing I would do is I would go on the Internet and I would read as much as

66
00:04:05.371 --> 00:04:09.180
humanly possible. I would go to how to make two snakes,

67
00:04:09.181 --> 00:04:11.370
fuck.com I would start,

68
00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:14.520
I don't know what to tell you, dude.

69
00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.260
I would just keep going to those expos like they're open mikes.

70
00:04:19.261 --> 00:04:23.430
I would keep reading up on it. I would try and find, uh, this is what you do.

71
00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.013
This is what you do.

72
00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.640
Act like you want to buy a fucking snake and go to some fucking dude and ask

73
00:04:29.641 --> 00:04:32.340
them how they got into the business. As you pretend like, you know,

74
00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.360
like you're browsing and maybe you can get a job working for one of those guys.

75
00:04:36.361 --> 00:04:39.090
You figure out what the fuck he's doing, right?

76
00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:44.180
You pull a Joe Kennedy that I've learned reading in the wonderful book the sins

77
00:04:44.551 --> 00:04:49.440
of the father. Um, yeah, that guy used to work every place.

78
00:04:49.441 --> 00:04:51.870
He'd work at a place for like seven months to two years.

79
00:04:51.871 --> 00:04:55.770
He'd rifle through all the files, get all this insider information,

80
00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.670
make a boatload of cash and leave the fucking company in the shitter.

81
00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.260
Okay. Now I'm not saying to do that, but fucking work with for these other guys.

82
00:05:04.261 --> 00:05:09.210
Figure out what they're doing, do what they're doing. Become better at it.

83
00:05:09.211 --> 00:05:12.600
That's what I would do if you really want to do this shit. I would, but, uh,

84
00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:14.250
I gotta tell you this man, um,

85
00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:21.400
I dunno how you make two pit vipers fuck each other. But, uh,

86
00:05:21.401 --> 00:05:25.930
I would definitely get a a, I dunno,

87
00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:28.800
I got a thick pair of gloves

88
00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:32.430
I had a reptiles even get turned on.

89
00:05:32.431 --> 00:05:34.830
They just have that fucking look on their face. Like,

90
00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:37.770
you don't know what they're thinking, you know?

91
00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:39.930
I'll tell you if snakes had fucking hands,

92
00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.180
like they would win world series of poker every year,

93
00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:46.020
there'd be no fucking way to tell what it had said,

94
00:05:46.021 --> 00:05:47.550
holding shit as he got a full house.

95
00:05:47.551 --> 00:05:50.400
He can't fucking just sit there sticking his tongue out at me.
