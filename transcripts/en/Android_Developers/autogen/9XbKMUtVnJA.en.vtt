hi I'm Chet Haase an engineer on the
Android team at Google I work on

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380
Android team at Google I work on
 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.080
Android team at Google I work on
graphics and animation today I wanted to

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090
graphics and animation today I wanted to
 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.110
graphics and animation today I wanted to
talk about a way of using a class called

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120
talk about a way of using a class called
 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.550
talk about a way of using a class called
view property animator which was

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560
view property animator which was
 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.750
view property animator which was
interested in introduced in the 3.2

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760
interested in introduced in the 3.2
 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.529
interested in introduced in the 3.2
release and this is a way to animate

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:23.539
release and this is a way to animate
 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:26.870
release and this is a way to animate
properties of views in a very easy way

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880
properties of views in a very easy way
 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.939
properties of views in a very easy way
it's kind of like setting the value of

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949
it's kind of like setting the value of
 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.980
it's kind of like setting the value of
one of the properties on the view but

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990
one of the properties on the view but
 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.630
one of the properties on the view but
having an animate to that value instead

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640
having an animate to that value instead
 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.330
having an animate to that value instead
of just atomically switch to it so

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340
of just atomically switch to it so
 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.860
of just atomically switch to it so
there's much more I could go into about

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870
there's much more I could go into about
 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.260
there's much more I could go into about
view property animator in general what

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270
view property animator in general what
 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.150
view property animator in general what
we're going to see today is an effect

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160
we're going to see today is an effect
 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.650
we're going to see today is an effect
where we can use view property animator

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660
where we can use view property animator
 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.380
where we can use view property animator
to crossfade between different images in

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390
to crossfade between different images in
 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.020
to crossfade between different images in
a picture viewer so let's take a look at

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030
a picture viewer so let's take a look at
 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.889
a picture viewer so let's take a look at
the demo so we saw another demo in a

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899
the demo so we saw another demo in a
 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.119
the demo so we saw another demo in a
previous episode where we used

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129
previous episode where we used
 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.830
previous episode where we used
transition drawable to do something

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840
transition drawable to do something
 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.020
transition drawable to do something
similar although that particular

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030
similar although that particular
 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.510
similar although that particular
drawable animation is about switching

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520
drawable animation is about switching
 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.760
drawable animation is about switching
just between two images this one's a

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770
just between two images this one's a
 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.139
just between two images this one's a
little bit more general-purpose where we

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149
little bit more general-purpose where we
 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.210
little bit more general-purpose where we
have a set of images in here that we've

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220
have a set of images in here that we've
 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.560
have a set of images in here that we've
loaded and we're going to crossfade as

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570
loaded and we're going to crossfade as
 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.320
loaded and we're going to crossfade as
we go between them and we'll just keep

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330
we go between them and we'll just keep
 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.240
we go between them and we'll just keep
going through the entire set of images a

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250
going through the entire set of images a
 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.640
going through the entire set of images a
little bit more general purpose so as we

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650
little bit more general purpose so as we
 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.800
little bit more general purpose so as we
click on the image we get a nice fading

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810
click on the image we get a nice fading
 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.469
click on the image we get a nice fading
effect as we go to the next image and on

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479
effect as we go to the next image and on
 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.480
effect as we go to the next image and on
and on and then we just cycle around I

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490
and on and then we just cycle around I
 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.969
and on and then we just cycle around I
only have four images loaded in here for

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979
only have four images loaded in here for
 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.109
only have four images loaded in here for
the purposes of this demo so pretty

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119
the purposes of this demo so pretty
 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.850
the purposes of this demo so pretty
pictures not terribly interesting demo

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860
pictures not terribly interesting demo
 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.310
pictures not terribly interesting demo
but let's take a look at the code so we

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320
but let's take a look at the code so we
 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.899
but let's take a look at the code so we
have this class called picture viewer

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909
have this class called picture viewer
 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.569
have this class called picture viewer
and in its I'm just hard coding these

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579
and in its I'm just hard coding these
 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.880
and in its I'm just hard coding these
I'm just loading in these small images

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890
I'm just loading in these small images
 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.649
I'm just loading in these small images
that I had not the way to go for a

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659
that I had not the way to go for a
 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.210
that I had not the way to go for a
general picture viewing application

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220
general picture viewing application
 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.060
general picture viewing application
obviously but it does for this purpose

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070
obviously but it does for this purpose
 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.010
obviously but it does for this purpose
which is to demonstrate using view

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020
which is to demonstrate using view
 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.960
which is to demonstrate using view
property animator and cross fading

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970
property animator and cross fading
 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.560
property animator and cross fading
between these things so we have two

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570
between these things so we have two
 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.330
between these things so we have two
image views that we're going to fade

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340
image views that we're going to fade
 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.310
image views that we're going to fade
between where we're going to put these

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320
between where we're going to put these
 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.240
between where we're going to put these
resources and we're going to first of

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250
resources and we're going to first of
 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.310
resources and we're going to first of
all set up the view property animator on

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320
all set up the view property animator on
 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.440
all set up the view property animator on
these views to have a duration of 1000

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450
these views to have a duration of 1000
 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.940
these views to have a duration of 1000
one thing to be aware of with view

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950
one thing to be aware of with view
 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.410
one thing to be aware of with view
property animator is the way that you

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420
property animator is the way that you
 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.900
property animator is the way that you
use it is by calling view animate and

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910
use it is by calling view animate and
 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.969
use it is by calling view animate and
that returns you a reference to the view

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979
that returns you a reference to the view
 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.290
that returns you a reference to the view
property animator

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300
property animator
 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.810
property animator
which all views have so they only have

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820
which all views have so they only have
 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.940
which all views have so they only have
that one instance inside them although

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950
that one instance inside them although
 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.100
that one instance inside them although
it's unique to that view so if you want

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110
it's unique to that view so if you want
 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.500
it's unique to that view so if you want
to change the precision properties on a

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510
to change the precision properties on a
 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:22.880
to change the precision properties on a
view property animator such as the

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890
view property animator such as the
 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.580
view property animator such as the
duration then you call dot animate and

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590
duration then you call dot animate and
 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.800
duration then you call dot animate and
then call the setter in this case we're

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810
then call the setter in this case we're
 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.330
then call the setter in this case we're
setting the duration to be a thousand I

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340
setting the duration to be a thousand I
 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.640
setting the duration to be a thousand I
should point out that is too long for a

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650
should point out that is too long for a
 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.890
should point out that is too long for a
general purpose UI animation but for the

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900
general purpose UI animation but for the
 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.480
general purpose UI animation but for the
purposes of actually demonstrating this

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490
purposes of actually demonstrating this
 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.780
purposes of actually demonstrating this
today in this video I tend to use longer

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790
today in this video I tend to use longer
 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.280
today in this video I tend to use longer
duration so you can actually see the

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290
duration so you can actually see the
 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.540
duration so you can actually see the
animation emitting on the frame rate of

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550
animation emitting on the frame rate of
 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.210
animation emitting on the frame rate of
the video then we create bitmap

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220
the video then we create bitmap
 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.120
the video then we create bitmap
drawables from these hard-coded images

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130
drawables from these hard-coded images
 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.420
drawables from these hard-coded images
these drawables that i defined above

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430
these drawables that i defined above
 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.530
these drawables that i defined above
nothing very interesting going on there

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540
nothing very interesting going on there
 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.900
nothing very interesting going on there
and then for the previous and the next

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910
and then for the previous and the next
 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.449
and then for the previous and the next
image view we populate them with the

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459
image view we populate them with the
 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.090
image view we populate them with the
first and second drawable there and then

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100
first and second drawable there and then
 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.800
first and second drawable there and then
when we click this is where all the

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810
when we click this is where all the
 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.540
when we click this is where all the
interesting stuff happens we basically

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550
interesting stuff happens we basically
 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.970
interesting stuff happens we basically
perform two animations in parallel we're

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980
perform two animations in parallel we're
 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.130
perform two animations in parallel we're
going to animate the existing image that

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140
going to animate the existing image that
 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.890
going to animate the existing image that
everybody can see out and we're going to

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900
everybody can see out and we're going to
 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.110
everybody can see out and we're going to
animate and we're going to fade the new

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120
animate and we're going to fade the new
 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.690
animate and we're going to fade the new
image the next image in and then when

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700
image the next image in and then when
 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.190
image the next image in and then when
it's done we're going to restore some

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200
it's done we're going to restore some
 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.520
it's done we're going to restore some
values and then we're going to set up

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530
values and then we're going to set up
 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.770
values and then we're going to set up
the the references to which images we're

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780
the the references to which images we're
 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.090
the the references to which images we're
currently showing so that we can keep

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100
currently showing so that we can keep
 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.500
currently showing so that we can keep
cycling through the set of images that

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510
cycling through the set of images that
 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.080
cycling through the set of images that
we have so here we're going to animate

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090
we have so here we're going to animate
 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.759
we have so here we're going to animate
the Alpha property which is the

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769
the Alpha property which is the
 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.070
the Alpha property which is the
translucency property of the previous

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080
translucency property of the previous
 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.960
translucency property of the previous
image it is currently one because that's

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970
image it is currently one because that's
 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.120
image it is currently one because that's
the image that the user is currently

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130
the image that the user is currently
 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:36.620
the image that the user is currently
seeing and we're going to add it by

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630
seeing and we're going to add it by
 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.420
seeing and we're going to add it by
animate it by saying animate which

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430
animate it by saying animate which
 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:39.560
animate it by saying animate which
returns this view property animator

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570
returns this view property animator
 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.949
returns this view property animator
object dot alpha zero so this is

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959
object dot alpha zero so this is
 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:44.750
object dot alpha zero so this is
basically saying I want you to animate

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760
basically saying I want you to animate
 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.270
basically saying I want you to animate
yeah I want to set the Alpha property to

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280
yeah I want to set the Alpha property to
 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.800
yeah I want to set the Alpha property to
zero but I want you to animate it they

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810
zero but I want you to animate it they
 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.009
zero but I want you to animate it they
are over whatever your duration is and

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019
are over whatever your duration is and
 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:53.270
are over whatever your duration is and
we're gonna call with layer and I'll

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280
we're gonna call with layer and I'll
 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.680
we're gonna call with layer and I'll
explain that in a moment this is sort of

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690
explain that in a moment this is sort of
 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.650
explain that in a moment this is sort of
an important element to understand for

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660
an important element to understand for
 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.990
an important element to understand for
performance tuning and then next image

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000
performance tuning and then next image
 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.670
performance tuning and then next image
view instead of fading that out like the

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680
view instead of fading that out like the
 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:02.990
view instead of fading that out like the
previous one we're gonna fade it in so

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000
previous one we're gonna fade it in so
 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.210
previous one we're gonna fade it in so
as the old one fades out we're gonna

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220
as the old one fades out we're gonna
 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.160
as the old one fades out we're gonna
fade the new one in so you can think of

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170
fade the new one in so you can think of
 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.630
fade the new one in so you can think of
them as sort of sitting on top of one

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640
them as sort of sitting on top of one
 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.789
them as sort of sitting on top of one
another where we're going to crossfade

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799
another where we're going to crossfade
 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:12.500
another where we're going to crossfade
them by fading one out and fading the

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510
them by fading one out and fading the
 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.240
them by fading one out and fading the
other one in it all at the same time and

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250
other one in it all at the same time and
 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.150
other one in it all at the same time and
then there's a new API that was added I

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160
then there's a new API that was added I
 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.110
then there's a new API that was added I
believe this is in jelly bean and it's

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120
believe this is in jelly bean and it's
 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.719
believe this is in jelly bean and it's
called with end action and you can mimic

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729
called with end action and you can mimic
 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:25.939
called with end action and you can mimic
this in Prior releases simply by

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:25.949
this in Prior releases simply by
 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:27.710
this in Prior releases simply by
setting a listener on a view property

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720
setting a listener on a view property
 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.120
setting a listener on a view property
animator and doing the same exact thing

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130
animator and doing the same exact thing
 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.700
animator and doing the same exact thing
this is just a little bit more terse way

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710
this is just a little bit more terse way
 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:33.409
this is just a little bit more terse way
of doing that you can say when this

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419
of doing that you can say when this
 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:36.260
of doing that you can say when this
animation is done then I want you to

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270
animation is done then I want you to
 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:37.550
animation is done then I want you to
perform the following actions we're

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560
perform the following actions we're
 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:38.900
perform the following actions we're
going to update our references so that

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910
going to update our references so that
 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.300
going to update our references so that
we know which images we're actually

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310
we know which images we're actually
 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.280
we know which images we're actually
looking at right now and then we're

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.290
looking at right now and then we're
 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:44.629
looking at right now and then we're
going to restore some alpha properties

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:44.639
going to restore some alpha properties
 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:46.640
going to restore some alpha properties
so we're going to set the Alpha property

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650
so we're going to set the Alpha property
 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.650
so we're going to set the Alpha property
of 1 to 0 and set the other alpha

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660
of 1 to 0 and set the other alpha
 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.290
of 1 to 0 and set the other alpha
property to 1 so that they're at a good

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300
property to 1 so that they're at a good
 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.090
property to 1 so that they're at a good
state to animate from for the next

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100
state to animate from for the next
 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.219
state to animate from for the next
transition that we do now I want to get

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:55.229
transition that we do now I want to get
 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:56.780
transition that we do now I want to get
back to this with layer thing this is

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:56.790
back to this with layer thing this is
 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:58.460
back to this with layer thing this is
important when you're animating a

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470
important when you're animating a
 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.010
important when you're animating a
complex view or complex view hierarchy

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020
complex view or complex view hierarchy
 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.830
complex view or complex view hierarchy
it's important to use a layer on that

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840
it's important to use a layer on that
 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.960
it's important to use a layer on that
object especially if you've noticed a

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970
object especially if you've noticed a
 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:07.820
object especially if you've noticed a
framerate problem because the system

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830
framerate problem because the system
 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.100
framerate problem because the system
can't keep up with redrawing that thing

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110
can't keep up with redrawing that thing
 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:11.570
can't keep up with redrawing that thing
from scratch every time during the

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580
from scratch every time during the
 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.820
from scratch every time during the
animation an easy way to do that is to

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830
animation an easy way to do that is to
 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.310
animation an easy way to do that is to
set a layer type on that object so you

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320
set a layer type on that object so you
 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.920
set a layer type on that object so you
simply call huge set layer type and set

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930
simply call huge set layer type and set
 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.240
simply call huge set layer type and set
it to a hardware layer for example and

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:22.250
it to a hardware layer for example and
 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:25.580
it to a hardware layer for example and
this API that we have here as of

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590
this API that we have here as of
 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.390
this API that we have here as of
jellybean the with layer API is a way

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400
jellybean the with layer API is a way
 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.610
jellybean the with layer API is a way
for us to do that for you so you could

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620
for us to do that for you so you could
 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.320
for us to do that for you so you could
do that when you run the animation you

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:33.330
do that when you run the animation you
 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:36.170
do that when you run the animation you
could say set layer type on the view and

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180
could say set layer type on the view and
 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:37.940
could say set layer type on the view and
then you could put some more code in

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:37.950
then you could put some more code in
 

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:39.800
then you could put some more code in
here with your end action or you could

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:39.810
here with your end action or you could
 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:41.450
here with your end action or you could
set a listener for the end of the

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:41.460
set a listener for the end of the
 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.089
set a listener for the end of the
animation and then reset that layer or

00:05:44.089 --> 00:05:44.099
animation and then reset that layer or
 

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:46.250
animation and then reset that layer or
remove that layer but we'll do that

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:46.260
remove that layer but we'll do that
 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:47.750
remove that layer but we'll do that
automatically for you if you call the

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:47.760
automatically for you if you call the
 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:52.040
automatically for you if you call the
with layer method so today's episode was

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.050
with layer method so today's episode was
 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:53.480
with layer method so today's episode was
about view property animator and

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:53.490
about view property animator and
 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:54.860
about view property animator and
specifically using view property

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:54.870
specifically using view property
 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:57.050
specifically using view property
animator to get a very easy crossfade

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:57.060
animator to get a very easy crossfade
 

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:58.250
animator to get a very easy crossfade
operation between different

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:58.260
operation between different
 

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:02.270
operation between different
representations of views thanks
