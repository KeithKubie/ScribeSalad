00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:12.250
HIV transmission we played this game
 

00:22:12.250 --> 00:22:14.970
HIV transmission we played this game
called the traffic light of love and um

00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:14.980
called the traffic light of love and um
 

00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:17.250
called the traffic light of love and um
so I started to mention this before but

00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:17.260
so I started to mention this before but
 

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:18.720
so I started to mention this before but
during the training there were three

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:18.730
during the training there were three
 

00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:22.050
during the training there were three
groups each of the three trainers had

00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:22.060
groups each of the three trainers had
 

00:22:22.060 --> 00:22:24.810
groups each of the three trainers had
their own group and sometimes for the

00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:24.820
their own group and sometimes for the
 

00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:26.940
their own group and sometimes for the
larger lectures they come together and

00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:26.950
larger lectures they come together and
 

00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:28.260
larger lectures they come together and
learn together and they would also

00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:28.270
learn together and they would also
 

00:22:28.270 --> 00:22:31.410
learn together and they would also
present their skits and their songs to

00:22:31.410 --> 00:22:31.420
present their skits and their songs to
 

00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:35.010
present their skits and their songs to
each other so I thought that this

00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:35.020
each other so I thought that this
 

00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:36.450
each other so I thought that this
activity was really interesting because

00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:36.460
activity was really interesting because
 

00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:39.750
activity was really interesting because
what we did is we distributed a bunch of

00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:39.760
what we did is we distributed a bunch of
 

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:40.799
what we did is we distributed a bunch of
strips with

00:22:40.799 --> 00:22:40.809
strips with
 

00:22:40.809 --> 00:22:43.049
strips with
for in sexual acts on them and the

00:22:43.049 --> 00:22:43.059
for in sexual acts on them and the
 

00:22:43.059 --> 00:22:45.810
for in sexual acts on them and the
participants the peer educators had to

00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:45.820
participants the peer educators had to
 

00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:48.299
participants the peer educators had to
decide what risk level they fell under

00:22:48.299 --> 00:22:48.309
decide what risk level they fell under
 

00:22:48.309 --> 00:22:52.080
decide what risk level they fell under
so if something was not at all risky you

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:52.090
so if something was not at all risky you
 

00:22:52.090 --> 00:22:55.169
so if something was not at all risky you
want a super cool okay sure no it did to

00:22:55.169 --> 00:22:55.179
want a super cool okay sure no it did to
 

00:22:55.179 --> 00:22:56.999
want a super cool okay sure no it did to
pay i can use this so if something

00:22:56.999 --> 00:22:57.009
pay i can use this so if something
 

00:22:57.009 --> 00:22:59.820
pay i can use this so if something
wasn't risky than it was green light go

00:22:59.820 --> 00:22:59.830
wasn't risky than it was green light go
 

00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:02.340
wasn't risky than it was green light go

you know very high risk and when I

00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:08.110
you know very high risk and when I
 

00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:11.549
you know very high risk and when I
looked at the three posters that the

00:23:11.549 --> 00:23:11.559
looked at the three posters that the
 

00:23:11.559 --> 00:23:13.950

high risk it red because you know there

00:23:21.989 --> 00:23:21.999
high risk it red because you know there
 

00:23:21.999 --> 00:23:24.269

secretions could enter that way but

00:23:30.210 --> 00:23:30.220
secretions could enter that way but
 

00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:33.570

vaginal sex with the condom was always

00:23:33.570 --> 00:23:33.580
vaginal sex with the condom was always
 

00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:36.269

green at the green light go ahead so

00:23:36.269 --> 00:23:36.279
green at the green light go ahead so
 

00:23:36.279 --> 00:23:38.129
green at the green light go ahead so
when I asked the participants if they

00:23:38.129 --> 00:23:38.139
when I asked the participants if they
 

00:23:38.139 --> 00:23:40.409
when I asked the participants if they
knew about the fact that condoms aren't

00:23:40.409 --> 00:23:40.419
knew about the fact that condoms aren't
 

00:23:40.419 --> 00:23:41.639
knew about the fact that condoms aren't
always one hundred percent effective

00:23:41.639 --> 00:23:41.649
always one hundred percent effective
 

00:23:41.649 --> 00:23:44.190
always one hundred percent effective
because sometimes they can break they

00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:44.200
because sometimes they can break they
 

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:46.529
because sometimes they can break they
said of course we know that and so I

00:23:46.529 --> 00:23:46.539
said of course we know that and so I
 

00:23:46.539 --> 00:23:48.359
said of course we know that and so I
said to them well then that's a direct

00:23:48.359 --> 00:23:48.369
said to them well then that's a direct
 

00:23:48.369 --> 00:23:52.980
said to them well then that's a direct
port of entry why would you know sex

00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:52.990
port of entry why would you know sex
 

00:23:52.990 --> 00:23:55.080
port of entry why would you know sex
without with a condom be a green light

00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:55.090
without with a condom be a green light
 

00:23:55.090 --> 00:23:57.690
without with a condom be a green light
and they said to me I don't understand

00:23:57.690 --> 00:23:57.700
and they said to me I don't understand
 

00:23:57.700 --> 00:24:00.690
and they said to me I don't understand
we are pure educators and we are telling

00:24:00.690 --> 00:24:00.700
we are pure educators and we are telling
 

00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:03.629
we are pure educators and we are telling
people how to stay safe so if we tell

00:24:03.629 --> 00:24:03.639
people how to stay safe so if we tell
 

00:24:03.639 --> 00:24:06.149
people how to stay safe so if we tell
them that using condoms has some

00:24:06.149 --> 00:24:06.159
them that using condoms has some
 

00:24:06.159 --> 00:24:08.759
them that using condoms has some
cautionary risks how are they going to

00:24:08.759 --> 00:24:08.769
cautionary risks how are they going to
 

00:24:08.769 --> 00:24:11.940
cautionary risks how are they going to
listen to us and I realized that they

00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:11.950
listen to us and I realized that they
 

00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:14.639
listen to us and I realized that they
knew best how to talk to their peers how

00:24:14.639 --> 00:24:14.649
knew best how to talk to their peers how
 

00:24:14.649 --> 00:24:17.190
knew best how to talk to their peers how
to talk to their community and this was

00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:17.200
to talk to their community and this was
 

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:18.690
to talk to their community and this was
something that I had to accept that this

00:24:18.690 --> 00:24:18.700
something that I had to accept that this
 

00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:20.399
something that I had to accept that this
was just a cultural difference and that

00:24:20.399 --> 00:24:20.409
was just a cultural difference and that
 

00:24:20.409 --> 00:24:22.259
was just a cultural difference and that
it made sense that they thought like

00:24:22.259 --> 00:24:22.269
it made sense that they thought like
 

00:24:22.269 --> 00:24:24.090
it made sense that they thought like
this and then this was a time to save

00:24:24.090 --> 00:24:24.100
this and then this was a time to save
 

00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:26.749
this and then this was a time to save
them okay well in talking about

00:24:26.749 --> 00:24:26.759
them okay well in talking about
 

00:24:26.759 --> 00:24:29.190
them okay well in talking about
prevention you know we're tell them to

00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:29.200
prevention you know we're tell them to
 

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:31.049
prevention you know we're tell them to
use condoms but also you know we should

00:24:31.049 --> 00:24:31.059
use condoms but also you know we should
 

00:24:31.059 --> 00:24:33.360
use condoms but also you know we should
talk about you know the risks

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:33.370
talk about you know the risks
 

00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:35.340
talk about you know the risks
Congress breaking and things like that

00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:35.350
Congress breaking and things like that
 

00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:36.480
Congress breaking and things like that
but I thought that was really

00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:36.490
but I thought that was really
 

00:24:36.490 --> 00:24:37.650
but I thought that was really
interesting because there were many

00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:37.660
interesting because there were many
 

00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:41.910
interesting because there were many
times where I had to really set back and

00:24:41.910 --> 00:24:41.920
times where I had to really set back and
 

00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:44.850
times where I had to really set back and
realized that I come from you know a

00:24:44.850 --> 00:24:44.860
realized that I come from you know a
 

00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:47.280
realized that I come from you know a
different set of cultural beliefs and

00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:47.290
different set of cultural beliefs and
 

00:24:47.290 --> 00:24:49.470
different set of cultural beliefs and
I'm not always going to be writing

00:24:49.470 --> 00:24:49.480
I'm not always going to be writing
 

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:51.390
I'm not always going to be writing
things aren't can always what I say

00:24:51.390 --> 00:24:51.400
things aren't can always what I say
 

00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:53.070
things aren't can always what I say
isn't can always make sense to them and

00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:53.080
isn't can always make sense to them and
 

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:55.860
isn't can always make sense to them and
in no way should I expect that they will

00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:55.870
in no way should I expect that they will
 

00:24:55.870 --> 00:24:57.990
in no way should I expect that they will
accept all the information and knowledge

00:24:57.990 --> 00:24:58.000
accept all the information and knowledge
 

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.570
accept all the information and knowledge
and I'm passing it to them but also you

00:25:00.570 --> 00:25:00.580
and I'm passing it to them but also you
 

00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:02.040
and I'm passing it to them but also you
know there's so much that I can learn

00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:02.050
know there's so much that I can learn
 

00:25:02.050 --> 00:25:04.200
know there's so much that I can learn
from them and then these issues really

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:04.210
from them and then these issues really
 

00:25:04.210 --> 00:25:07.380
from them and then these issues really
are complex in every community in every

00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:07.390
are complex in every community in every

I decide whose life was the most

00:25:30.330 --> 00:25:30.340
I decide whose life was the most
 

00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:31.890
I decide whose life was the most
important life to stay there was a

00:25:31.890 --> 00:25:31.900
important life to stay there was a
 

00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:34.410
important life to stay there was a
sinking lifeboat and one person could

00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:34.420
sinking lifeboat and one person could
 

00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:37.320
sinking lifeboat and one person could
live and this was interesting for me to

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:37.330
live and this was interesting for me to
 

00:25:37.330 --> 00:25:39.120
live and this was interesting for me to
in a challenge and exploring new

in a challenge and exploring new
paradigms of learning because the

centered and here I'm telling them to

00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:47.950
centered and here I'm telling them to
 

00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:49.830
centered and here I'm telling them to
question people that might be the

00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:49.840
question people that might be the
 

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:52.020
question people that might be the

President or someone that might be a
 

00:25:52.030 --> 00:25:54.000
President or someone that might be a
multi-billionaire and it was just really

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:54.010
multi-billionaire and it was just really
 

00:25:54.010 --> 00:25:58.669
multi-billionaire and it was just really
interesting to explore these new roles

00:25:58.669 --> 00:25:58.679
 

00:25:58.679 --> 00:26:00.870
also as we'll talk about a little bit

as much of a house experience with
 

00:26:26.539 --> 00:26:30.009
as much of a house experience with
prisoners in India and so we kind of

00:26:30.009 --> 00:26:30.019
prisoners in India and so we kind of
 

00:26:30.019 --> 00:26:32.739
prisoners in India and so we kind of
readapted this and now this board is

used by many of the pure education peer

00:26:34.570 --> 00:26:34.580
used by many of the pure education peer
 

00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:36.820
used by many of the pure education peer
educators and some of the projects that

00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:36.830
educators and some of the projects that
 

00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:39.369

community events and during week four we
 

00:26:46.759 --> 00:26:49.930
community events and during week four we
taught the stages of safety and this is

00:26:49.930 --> 00:26:49.940
taught the stages of safety and this is
 

00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:51.940
taught the stages of safety and this is
a part of the manual and it's really

00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:51.950
a part of the manual and it's really
 

00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:54.759
a part of the manual and it's really
about avoiding lapses and relapses to

00:26:54.759 --> 00:26:54.769
about avoiding lapses and relapses to
 

00:26:54.769 --> 00:26:57.849
about avoiding lapses and relapses to
unsafe behaviors while emphasizing how

00:26:57.849 --> 00:26:57.859
unsafe behaviors while emphasizing how
 

00:26:57.859 --> 00:27:00.519
unsafe behaviors while emphasizing how
to cope in these high-risk situations so

00:27:00.519 --> 00:27:00.529
to cope in these high-risk situations so
 

00:27:00.529 --> 00:27:02.200

created and symbols to discuss the six
 

00:27:06.409 --> 00:27:08.680

steps to the stages of safety because it

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:08.690
steps to the stages of safety because it
 

00:27:08.690 --> 00:27:10.389
steps to the stages of safety because it
was easier to remember it that way so in

00:27:10.389 --> 00:27:10.399
was easier to remember it that way so in
 

00:27:10.399 --> 00:27:12.549
was easier to remember it that way so in
the counseling that they would later on

00:27:12.549 --> 00:27:12.559
the counseling that they would later on
 

00:27:12.559 --> 00:27:14.739
the counseling that they would later on
do and their roles as peer educators it

00:27:14.739 --> 00:27:14.749

really educational tools because they're
 

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:32.440
really educational tools because they're
things that can be presented at

00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:32.450
things that can be presented at
 

00:27:32.450 --> 00:27:35.019
things that can be presented at
community forums at schools and it was

00:27:35.019 --> 00:27:35.029
community forums at schools and it was
 

00:27:35.029 --> 00:27:36.700
community forums at schools and it was
just really a great way to relay

00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:36.710
just really a great way to relay
 

00:27:36.710 --> 00:28:24.420
just really a great way to relay
information

00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:24.430
 

00:28:24.430 --> 00:28:28.450
okay so we had a lot of fun during the

00:28:28.450 --> 00:28:28.460
okay so we had a lot of fun during the
 

00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:30.370
okay so we had a lot of fun during the
training and it was wonderful but they

00:28:30.370 --> 00:28:30.380
training and it was wonderful but they
 

00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:32.320
training and it was wonderful but they
also learned a lot they really really

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:32.330
also learned a lot they really really
 

00:28:32.330 --> 00:28:35.500
also learned a lot they really really
did and this you could see not only in

00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:35.510
did and this you could see not only in
 

00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:38.890
did and this you could see not only in
the skits in the role plays and the

00:28:38.890 --> 00:28:38.900
the skits in the role plays and the
 

00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:42.100
the skits in the role plays and the
diversity of the questions they came

00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:42.110
diversity of the questions they came
 

00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:45.100
diversity of the questions they came
with the experiences they shared the

00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:45.110
with the experiences they shared the
 

00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:47.730
with the experiences they shared the
knowledge that they had but also we

00:28:47.730 --> 00:28:47.740
knowledge that they had but also we
 

00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:52.540
knowledge that they had but also we
administered a 30 item questionnaire

00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:52.550
administered a 30 item questionnaire
 

00:28:52.550 --> 00:28:54.340
administered a 30 item questionnaire
that's part of the manual that was

00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:54.350
that's part of the manual that was
 

00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:57.160
that's part of the manual that was
administered at pre-tests and post-tests

00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:57.170
administered at pre-tests and post-tests
 

00:28:57.170 --> 00:29:00.670
administered at pre-tests and post-tests
and their scores from baseline to post

00:29:00.670 --> 00:29:00.680
and their scores from baseline to post
 

00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:06.240
and their scores from baseline to post
test showed that showed that they were

00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:06.250
test showed that showed that they were
 

00:29:06.250 --> 00:29:08.650
test showed that showed that they were
significant about the level of point

00:29:08.650 --> 00:29:08.660
significant about the level of point
 

00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:10.600
significant about the level of point
zero zero zero so on average they had

00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:10.610
zero zero zero so on average they had
 

00:29:10.610 --> 00:29:13.750
zero zero zero so on average they had
learned you know five new concepts it

00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:13.760
learned you know five new concepts it
 

00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:15.370
learned you know five new concepts it
really improved on and there was no

00:29:15.370 --> 00:29:15.380
really improved on and there was no
 

00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:16.750
really improved on and there was no
difference in knowledge between the

00:29:16.750 --> 00:29:16.760
difference in knowledge between the
 

00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:18.580

female and the male participants and
 

00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:20.740
female and the male participants and
iPhone is really interesting the only

00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:20.750
iPhone is really interesting the only
 

00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:22.240
iPhone is really interesting the only
group that was significantly different

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:22.250
group that was significantly different
 

00:29:22.250 --> 00:29:24.310
group that was significantly different
in terms of their knowledge from all the

00:29:24.310 --> 00:29:24.320
in terms of their knowledge from all the
 

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:26.200
in terms of their knowledge from all the
other groups was the group that was

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:26.210
other groups was the group that was
 

00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:28.030
other groups was the group that was
still in high school so the group that

00:29:28.030 --> 00:29:28.040
still in high school so the group that
 

00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:30.370
still in high school so the group that
was still in high school performed far

00:29:30.370 --> 00:29:30.380
was still in high school performed far
 

00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:32.560
was still in high school performed far
better than the group that had completed

00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:32.570
better than the group that had completed
 

00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:34.810
better than the group that had completed
high school and this might point to the

00:29:34.810 --> 00:29:34.820
high school and this might point to the
 

00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:37.240
high school and this might point to the
fact that there's more HIV AIDS

00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:37.250
fact that there's more HIV AIDS
 

00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:39.970
