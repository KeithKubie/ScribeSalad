00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:07.290
I've been going through the Cinema Sins fanmail
a little bit.

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.440
I don't know if you ever read any of those.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:10.440
No.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.350
I mean, I see a select group of fanmail.

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:22.580
I filter by keyword so that I don't have to
look at all of it.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.649
And what are the keywords?

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:42.579
Attractive, handsome, awesome, hot, sex, hot
sex, awesome hot sex, free beer.

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:48.260
Okay, so you definitely don't know that there's
a lot of people that want you to do sins on

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:49.660
other content.

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:50.660
No.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.329
Like 25% of your audience is asking you to
do sins of stuff besides just movies.

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:57.350
Like, what do they want me to do?

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.039
Like, sins of video games is a popular suggestion.

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:02.749
But I don't really play video games.

00:01:02.749 --> 00:01:03.870
Yeah, but, you used to.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.030
Well, yeah, but that was years ago.

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.409
Like, is Pitfall still popular?

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:09.500
No.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.500
But that's sort of my point.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.530
Like, you're not a complete newby when it
comes to video games, but you haven't played

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:21.330
in a while, so you bring in no bias, no preconceived
notions, no playing favorites, you know?

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.740
I think it might be a good idea.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.790
Well, how would I even do sins of video games?

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.590
Like, the experience is different for each
player.

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:31.830
What do you mean?

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.070
Like, with Grand Theft Auto, don't some people
play the story mode instead of just killing

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.860
hookers and sniping people?

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.290
Yeah, I imagine.

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.160
Yeah, so wouldn't they rather see sins of,
like, the story mode rather than the ones

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.720
I would write, which would be like, "this
hooker didn't have enough money on her after

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.550
I killed her" ding, or "this hooker didn't
blow me" ding?

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.160
I think they'd probably expect you to play
story mode, yeah.

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.110
But I guess I get your point.

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:04.520
You couldn't really call it "Everything Wrong
With" because everybody's experience is a

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.540
little different.

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.239
It's more your experience of what's wrong
with it.

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:14.689
Maybe you call it "Some Of The Things Wrong
With?"

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:16.120
What else you got?

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.220
Alright.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.930
Sins of TV shows.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.299
Hmm.

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:21.670
Pass.

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.040
Why?

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.129
Do you realize how many episodes successful
TV shows have?

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:32.890
It's like 50 to 100... hours of content to
comb through and find sins.

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.810
I am way to f*cking lazy for that.

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.650
Well maybe the sins don't have to be so specific
for TV.

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:44.519
Maybe it's, instead of continuity errors and
little tiny discrepancies from one shot to

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:48.469
another you pull out and you do more of a
broad view.

00:02:48.469 --> 00:02:53.300
Like if it was Lost you could do all the sins
for the mysteries that they never explained,

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:59.090
or you could do a Bonus Round of Jack speeches
or something.

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.549
What else you got?

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:03.549
Alright.

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:04.940
Sins of movie trailers.

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.010
I don't know, 99% of them give away the movie.

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.319
Is there anything else to add?

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:13.469
Sins of board games?

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:17.370
This game has too many chutes and not enough
ladders.

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:18.489
Ding!

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.989
Sins of books?

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:23.269
Reading.

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:25.549
Ding!

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:26.549
Music videos.

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:27.549
How about music video sins?

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:29.139
I don't know, that they exist?

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:34.760
There's not enough nudity in them?

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.599
Sins of comic books is one that I see a lot.

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:38.680
Well, now how is that supposed to work, genius?

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.859
Am I supposed to rip out all the pages and
scan them so I can get them on the computer?

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:44.329
I don't know, I'm just the messenger here,
alright?

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:45.470
This is what the fans are saying.

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.859
Well the fans are sometimes stupid.

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:50.919
Well I'm sure they'll be happy to hear that.

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:53.669
How about sins of YouTube channels?

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:56.819
Isn't that what the comments section is for?

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:59.879
Well you gotta pick one of these.

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:02.090
I don't gotta to do anything.

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:03.200
Okay, I'll rephrase.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.599
You should pick one of them.

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:10.560
This is what the fans are telling you they
want to see, so it'd be really wise to do

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.560
one of these.

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.700
Alright I guess I'll do video games.

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:14.700
Okay.

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.329
Cause then I at least can play video games
again.

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.979
Which I haven't been able to do since you
got married and your wife put the kibosh on

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:22.960
my Xbox.

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.440
She thought it was mine, man, I'm sorry.

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.789
Alright, now let me make it up to you.

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:33.979
I doubt that's possible.

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:42.080
Oh look
I got you a gift.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.080
Great.

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.080
A box.

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.450
Not just any box, it's a Playstation 3 box.

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:51.060
Why did you get me a Playstation 3 box?

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.039
Because there's a Playstation 3 in it.

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:55.039
Right.

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:56.039
Cause that's what we do.

00:04:56.039 --> 00:05:00.190
We spend hundreds of dollars on each other
on lavish unnecessary gifts.

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.379
There's no con, man, I promise.

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:07.310
I thought you might want to do sins of video
games or something similar.

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:09.060
Cinema Sins Let's Play video or something.

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:10.400
I got you a Playstation 3.

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:11.400
Yeah.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.400
I'm sure you did.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.400
If you don't want it, you don't have to keep
it.

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.140
I'm not going to keep an empty box.

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:17.349
Dude.

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:19.520
There's a real Playstation in there, alright?

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:20.520
No there's not.

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.380
If there was a real Playstation in here would
I do this?

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:27.210
Apparently yeah.

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:28.659
That was real, wasn't it?

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:29.659
Yeah.

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:35.060
I only told you, like, five times before you
threw it across the room.

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:36.981
You got a spare, though, right?
