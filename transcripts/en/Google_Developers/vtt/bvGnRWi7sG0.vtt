[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:14.382 --> 00:00:15.840
RICHARD DEVAUL:
The actual Moonshot

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.170
is wonderful, inspirational,
poetic, beautiful, involved,

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.581
great technical challenges,
genuine heroism--

00:00:21.581 --> 00:00:22.830
it brought the world together.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.390
But think about the
Polynesian islander,

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.460
on a dugout canoe,
deciding one day

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.020
they were going to go that way.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:31.870
No one had ever been
that way before.

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:34.570
No one even knew if there was
anything that way, before.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:35.740
It was amazing.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:37.840
And it changed the world.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.700
ASTRO TELLER: People
can set their minds

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.940
to magical, seemingly
impossible ideas.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.730
And then, through
science and technology,

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.610
bring them to reality.

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.160
And that, then sets
other people on fire.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.500
Then other things
that look impossible

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.240
might be accomplishable.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.073
JOHN F. KENNEDY
(VOICEOVER): Many years ago,

00:00:59.073 --> 00:01:01.050
the great British
explorer, George Mallory,

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.849
who was to die on
Mount Everest, was

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:07.230
asked, why did he
want to climb it?

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:08.439
He said, because it is there.

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:10.188
RICHARD DEVAUL: Everyone
else in the world

00:01:10.188 --> 00:01:11.860
is working on that next 10%.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.310
If you could be the one
that delivers that 10 times

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.300
improvement, you have a chance
to really change things.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.841
ASTRO TELLER
(VOICEOVER): If you want

00:01:18.841 --> 00:01:21.565
cars to run at 50
miles per gallon, fine,

00:01:21.565 --> 00:01:24.000
you can retool your
car a little bit.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.010
But if I tell you it has
to run on a gallon of gas

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.944
for 500 miles, you
have to start over.

00:01:29.944 --> 00:01:32.110
MEGAN SMITH: You need a lot
of courage in this work,

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:33.526
and you need a lot
of persistence.

00:01:33.526 --> 00:01:35.550
Even if you don't
really, 100% believe

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.660
it's possible-- like
you might think,

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.870
this might be possible--
have the courage to try.

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.800
That's how the greatest
things have happened.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.050
ASTRO TELLER: You don't spend
your time being bothered

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.710
that you can't teleport from
here to Japan, because there's

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.170
a part of you that
thinks it's impossible.

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.897
Moonshot thinking is choosing
to be bothered by that.

00:01:51.897 --> 00:01:53.480
JOHN F. KENNEDY
(VOICEOVER): We choose

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.470
to go to the moon
in this decade,

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.040
and do the other things.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.692
Not because they are easy,
but because they are hard.

00:02:00.692 --> 00:02:02.150
RICHARD DEVAUL:
Humanity's progress

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.456
has been a series of
amazing audacious things,

00:02:04.456 --> 00:02:05.830
from the very
small and personal,

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.630
up to the great, big and grand.

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.300
And we are a species
of Moonshots.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.410
And to me, that's like
the really amazing, poetic

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.031
inspirational thing.

00:02:13.031 --> 00:02:15.530
MEGAN SMITH: When you find your
passion, you're unstoppable.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.467
You can make amazing
things happen.

00:02:17.467 --> 00:02:19.050
It's been true through
all of history.

00:02:21.678 --> 00:02:25.030
When Kennedy said that we
would put a man on the moon,

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.880
it's about the
fact that he said,

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.530
we don't know how
to do this yet,

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.320
and we're going to do it anyway.

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.460
And that sends chills
up everybody's spine.

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.915
Because if that happens,
what couldn't we do?

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.850
MEGAN SMITH: Welcome to
Solve for X. I'm Megan Smith,

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:47.730
and this is--

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.180
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.760
I have a fan down there.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.310
And Puneet Ahira.

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.460
And when we started Solve for
X, the idea of it-- actually,

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.410
the original crazy idea was
that when we had begun Google X,

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.140
we were looking for projects.

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.531
And we were going to have
a conference to brainstorm.

00:03:05.531 --> 00:03:07.530
And so we started thinking
about the conference.

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.542
And then we had way too
many ideas for Google X,

00:03:09.542 --> 00:03:11.250
and there was no way
we could do anymore.

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.100
But we decided to still
have the conference.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.770
And the reason for that is,
there is extraordinary people

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:17.700
all around the world.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:18.990
And there always have been.

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.090
Who just are inspired, and
taking these moonshots,

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.120
and really trying to make the
world better, in radical ways.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.790
And many of them
are techies like us.

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.450
And so we wanted to have a place
where we can celebrate people

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.726
who are in the middle of trying.

00:03:34.726 --> 00:03:37.100
Not when they're in history
books later, because they get

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.600
celebrated.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:38.900
But in the middle of trying.

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.830
You know that moment for like,
Elon Musk-- I don't know,

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.660
about five years ago, when
people were like the rockets

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:45.289
are blowing up.

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:46.830
Tesla, how is it
going to make money?

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.450
You know, that just
no one believed.

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:49.910
And he needed help then.

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.165
And I feel like those are
the people that Solve for X

00:03:52.165 --> 00:03:53.320
are really about.

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.830
We call them these
Moonshot Pioneers.

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:00.110
And the structure of a
Moonshot, in our mind, of a tech

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.250
Moonshot, is really
characterized

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.130
by these three circles.

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:07.110
There's some kind of problem in
the world, or opportunity that

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.160
really would affect
a lot of people,

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.140
that someone's identified.

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.330
There's some kind of
breakthrough technology.

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.339
It might sound like science
fiction, but it's available.

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:18.050
Or some new way
of doing something

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:20.560
that we already know
well, in the tech area.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.180
And they've got a radical
solution, a product or service,

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.370
or way, that actually
could scale in the world.

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.690
So even if you took something
like a self driving car.

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.190
The problem is, of course,
you know, billions of people

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.450
wasting time in traffic.

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:36.470
Safety.

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:37.510
Texting and driving.

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.030
All those kinds of issues--
fuel efficiencies--

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.810
a really serious
problem worth solving.

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.000
The breakthrough
technology today,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.410
are things like real time
sensors, the level of mapping

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:52.070
we have, kind of robotics, et
cetera-- that would allow us

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:55.750
to, in a radical way,
have a car drive itself,

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:56.770
in the current system.

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:58.200
Not some kind of special route.

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.650
So that's the Moonshot
of the self driving car.

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.625
So today, we're going to hear
from four extraordinary teams.

00:05:04.625 --> 00:05:06.250
The first one is
actually a team of 10,

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.370
so it's five amazing
people who have moonshots.

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.100
And the format is the following,
you want to tell the format?

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.640
Yeah, sure.

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.098
So we're going to
have each of them

00:05:16.098 --> 00:05:19.080
come up on stage, present their
10 minute proposal to you,

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.850
which goes through this format,
of what they're working on,

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:26.180
what their breakthrough idea is,
and how they're going to do it.

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.290
And then after we
hear from all of them,

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:31.160
what we're going to do is, in
these tables that you guys are

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.840
sitting in, to do an interactive
brainstorming session--

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.630
we borrowed this
concept from improv,

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:39.080
spend two-thirds of
your time thinking,

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.160
'yes, and what else could we
do?' What resources can we

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:42.660
provide?

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:46.420
What people could we connect
these Moonshot Pioneers to,

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:49.040
that are really going to
accelerate how quickly they

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.704
can get this out in the world?

00:05:50.704 --> 00:05:52.120
And then, spend
some of the time--

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.100
A third of the time doing 'Yes,
but.' Does the math add up?

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:57.230
Is the physics right?

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:58.150
Does this make sense?

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:00.790
What are maybe some of the
blind spots or questions that

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:02.890
might not have
been asked before?

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:04.820
So we'll do that for
about 25 minutes,

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:07.610
and then have each of the groups
come back, and report out.

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:10.430
And it's actually the
most fun, interesting part

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.740
of this session-- where
we get an explosion

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.339
of different directions and
ideas, that come out of this.

00:06:15.339 --> 00:06:17.880
MEGAN SMITH: And the thing about
it is, that you may be like,

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.530
oh my god, I don't know
anything about these topics.

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:21.406
But the best ideas--
sometimes on your table,

00:06:21.406 --> 00:06:22.863
there is going to
be somebody who's

00:06:22.863 --> 00:06:25.700
a super expert of the topic, and
somebody who's knows nothing.

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:28.015
And that mix is where
we get the best ideas.

00:06:28.015 --> 00:06:29.640
And so, we'll have
enough so that we'll

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:31.220
have two tables per idea.

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:32.630
And they're bringing
more chairs.

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:34.840
They said they'd be here
in about 5 or 10 minutes.

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.870
So we'll make another
table back there.

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:38.460
So that's the plan.

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:40.990
And thanks for being here.

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:42.820
And then, we'll
come do report outs.

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:44.860
So, we want to get started.

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:47.622
It's a bit-- the style is kind
of like a short Ted-like talk,

00:06:47.622 --> 00:06:49.080
these guys are
going to do, to make

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:50.709
this proposal in the format.

00:06:50.709 --> 00:06:53.000
PUNEET AHIRA: We have Sara,
who's joining us right now,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.110
who's going to talk to us about
her vision of how to make food

00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:59.120
globally cheap and abundant.

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.620
And we've been
working with-- do you

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:02.060
want to come up and get set up?

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:04.320
We've been working with Sara
for the last few months,

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.990
and have been so excited
about all of the progress

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:08.640
that she's made.

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:10.290
And so we're so
excited that she's

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:13.170
been able to fly over
here from Nairobi, to be

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:15.490
able to share this
story with you.

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:17.710
And hopefully, they'll
be areas for you guys

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:20.070
to collaborate with, with
this project, as well.

00:07:26.312 --> 00:07:27.894
MEGAN SMITH: While
she's setting up--

00:07:27.894 --> 00:07:30.060
one of the things that's
interesting in Solve for X,

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:34.910
we've done-- we do a summit with
18 proposals every February,

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:37.240
and then we've 10 of
these mini events.

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:39.120
One at Congress actually,
which was great,

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:42.790
to try to get them moving on
proposals, and stop arguing.

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:46.050
So, one of the areas that
we're always looking for,

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:49.420
because it's 10%
of GDP of countries

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:51.450
is agricultural breakthroughs.

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:55.830
And so, it was
great to find Sara.

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:58.660
SARA MENKER: And actually,
I have a gift for every one.

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:00.890
So I want you guys
to pass this around

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:02.376
and, just take
one tortilla chip.

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:08.530
You've not allowed to
have more than one.

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:10.790
And don't eat it.

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:11.290
Sorry.

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:18.890
It'll defeat the purpose of
what I'm trying to achieve.

00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:22.010
I guess, as it's
being passed around,

00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:24.980
I want you guys to have
that tortilla chip as a way

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:27.470
to contextualize
the conversation,

00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:29.650
I want us all to have.

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:32.770
But you know, show of
hands, just for the sake

00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:37.260
of show of hands, who has
a smartphone of any kind?

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:39.120
100% of the room.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:44.470
So a decade ago, smartphones
that we have today,

00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:46.770
with the functionality
that we have,

00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:51.530
would have been over two
times expensive, if not more.

00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:58.510
So we've managed to half the
price of the devices we use.

00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:01.510
The tortilla chip,
in your hand however,

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:05.170
has gone up by two
and a half times.

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:09.340
So the one thing we need to
live with, and survive with,

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:12.560
is the one thing that we've
managed to not solve for.

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:16.520
And how expensive food has
gotten and will continue

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:20.550
to get, is a very
scary proposition.

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:24.820
So by way of background,
I'm Ethiopian.

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:26.620
I was raised in
Ethiopia in the 80s,

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:28.780
at the peak of the food crisis.

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:31.400
So my natural transition was
to become a commodities trader

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:32.970
on Wall Street.

00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:37.420
Now, in 2008,
there was something

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:39.480
that happened in the
commodities markets.

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:43.650
Oil hit $150, and global
food prices and grain prices

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:46.270
hit what was an all time high.

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:49.630
At that point in
time, I freaked out.

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:52.910
And my freaking out was
really driven by a fear

00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:54.610
that 20 years down
the line, there's

00:09:54.610 --> 00:09:57.500
no way we're going to be able
to afford food, personally.

00:09:57.500 --> 00:10:00.820
So I just kind of developed an
obsession around agriculture.

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:02.500
I was trading
energy at the time,

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:04.350
so there wasn't a
reason why I should

00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:07.220
be obsessed with this problem,
other than I knew the markets.

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:12.840
And that obsession eventually
led me to quit my job in 2012,

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:15.470
to go down this path
of trying to help

00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:18.810
make food cheap and abundant.

00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:22.270
Now when I left, it was
the beginning of 2012,

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:26.770
and what I didn't know
was later that year,

00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:31.000
we'd hit new highs
in grain prices.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
And little did I know that
the country I had chosen

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.400
to move to, which was
Kenya-- so I left New York,

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:40.740
and moved to Kenya-- would be
hit particularly hard by it.

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:45.410
See, what happened in
2012 is, in 2011, Kenya

00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:51.380
had experienced a drought, that
it was barely recovering from.

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:54.000
And as it was
starting to recover,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.660
a disease had been
discovered-- a crop

00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:57.220
disease had been discovered.

00:10:57.220 --> 00:10:59.730
And just as that disease
started to spread,

00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:02.014
droughts in the US and
Russia hit simultaneously.

00:11:02.014 --> 00:11:04.180
Now the US and Russia are
two of the world's largest

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:06.070
grain exporting countries.

00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:10.120
What that meant, was that
Kenyan corn prices went

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:12.830
from being below
the global average,

00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:15.950
to being well above the average.

00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:18.260
And it kept getting
worse, because what

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.010
happened was
policymakers then adopted

00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:25.870
a policy of reinstating
a 50% import tax on corn.

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:27.990
Now corn, in the US
might mean something

00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:31.330
like tortilla chips, high
fructose corn syrup, ethanol.

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:34.540
Corn in Kenya, is what
Kenyans eat every single day.

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:37.660
It provides almost half of
the calorie requirements

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:38.790
for the country.

00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:42.180
And the poorest quarter in the
country, spend about a third

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:45.020
of their income
on that one grain.

00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:46.740
Now when I graduated
from college,

00:11:46.740 --> 00:11:48.620
I remember being
told to spend about--

00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:52.380
to expect to spend about a
third of my salary on rent.

00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:56.420
So now imagine spending a third
of your total income, not all

00:11:56.420 --> 00:12:00.360
your food requirements,
but on a single good.

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:02.660
See, there's no
more room for error,

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:05.090
in the way we think
about food, and the way

00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:07.290
we think about food prices.

00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:10.620
And we're already at a stage
when we have no room for error.

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:14.180
And areas like the one I
gave as an example in Kenya,

00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:16.990
unfortunately happen
all over Africa.

00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:19.980
And it happens not
because policymakers

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:22.410
are malicious or malintention.

00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:24.970
It happens because there's
a lack of information

00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:27.530
and clarity, in the type
of information needed,

00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:31.060
to make the policy
decisions being made.

00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:35.110
Now fast forward in where
we're going to, as a world.

00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:39.630
We are expected to be 9.1
billion people by 2050.

00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:44.740
As a wealthier population, we're
expected to need 70% more food.

00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:47.500
Because we consume a lot
more, than we actually

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:49.350
growing as a population.

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:51.960
So in this space where
there's no room for error,

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:54.500
you have this happening
with population.

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:57.050
And to top it off, you
have climate change.

00:12:57.050 --> 00:12:58.920
The frequency of
droughts, floods,

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:02.150
wind-related crop damage
has grown exponentially--

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:05.330
such that, actually figuring
out agricultural production,

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:09.150
and productivity, has
become impossible.

00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:10.790
So what happens next?

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:12.664
We've got it--
it's clear we have

00:13:12.664 --> 00:13:13.830
to increase food production.

00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:14.880
How does that happen?

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:16.780
It's got to happen
in one of two ways.

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:18.320
We're either going
to have to start

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:20.630
growing more food
on the plots of land

00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:22.630
that we're growing food
in, so increasing yield.

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:25.540
Or we're going to have
to plant new land.

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:28.840
Now I'll argue, as much as I
said about Africa, that Africa

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:31.290
is actually the place
for that to happen.

00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:35.540
Not only does it have the
largest swath of arable land

00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:39.760
remaining in the world-- four
times the amount in the US,

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:42.210
planted across the US today.

00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:50.420
It also has such low yields,
that if in 2012, African corn

00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:54.200
yields were just equivalent
to the world average,

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:56.250
we could have actually
increased corn production

00:13:56.250 --> 00:13:58.090
by 12% that year.

00:13:58.090 --> 00:14:01.400
It was a 2% reduction in
corn production globally,

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:04.160
that actually led to
that sort of price spike.

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:08.140
So imagine what a 12% increase
in production can happen.

00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:11.320
So the next question you
ask is, so how are we

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:12.630
going to solve this mess?

00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:14.780
And how do we go
about doing that?

00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:18.600
That's where we like
to think of the work

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:23.770
that we're doing as being
that Moonshot around how

00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:26.700
to address
productivity in Africa.

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:31.550
We've created a real time,
basically tracking application,

00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:35.770
that allows all sorts of users,
from policymakers to traders,

00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:39.790
to basically visualize and
analyze all sorts of data

00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:41.960
around agriculture.

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:45.630
So the application
currently, basically-- it's

00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:47.540
not that the data isn't
available by the way,

00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:50.490
in terms of what
policymakers are using.

00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:52.510
It's that it's
highly disaggregated.

00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:54.770
It's comes in multiple formats.

00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:56.230
And nobody knows where it sits.

00:14:56.230 --> 00:15:01.020
So what ends up
happening, is that a user

00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:03.280
doesn't know which
source to tap,

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:05.090
for what piece of information.

00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:08.300
So what we've done is we've
created a blank slate.

00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:12.980
It's a blank slate that
actually sucks in and aggregates

00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:18.040
all sorts of data-- over 40,000
indicators, that basically look

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:21.755
at all sorts of analytics around
Africa, African agriculture,

00:15:21.755 --> 00:15:24.350
but also global agriculture.

00:15:24.350 --> 00:15:27.360
So metrics from
emissions, to rainfall,

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:29.950
to vegetation, to production.

00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:34.780
So what ends up happening is, a
continent where 30% of its GDP

00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:37.470
comes from agriculture--
less than 1%

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:40.570
of outstanding bank loans today
are to the agricultural sector,

00:15:40.570 --> 00:15:42.770
the reason is capital
is not available.

00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:45.070
So what we're trying
to do, is basically

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:48.900
make the data available that
lets capital be unleashed.

00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:53.956
So in this context, now you
take your tortilla chips--

00:15:53.956 --> 00:15:57.070
and I want everybody to
imagine being a credit

00:15:57.070 --> 00:16:00.880
officer for farmers in Nigeria.

00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:03.740
And you have and
Nigerian cassava farmer

00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:05.840
that comes to your office.

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:08.860
In the past, the way decisions
are made is a yes or no,

00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:10.480
and oftentimes,
it ends with a no.

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:12.810
What we are envisioning,
is a future,

00:16:12.810 --> 00:16:15.190
where if you are
a credit officer,

00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:18.420
you have a tool that
lets you go in and look

00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:21.760
at all sorts of parameters,
around say, supply

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:25.880
and the supply of
certain different crops

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:27.310
that are important in Nigeria.

00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:30.760
So to give an example,
tomatoes-- Nigerians

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:34.080
are actually one of the largest
importers of tomato paste,

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:37.180
and wheat.

00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:44.890
And so, it allows you to go
in, and create this real time

00:16:44.890 --> 00:16:47.420
tracking system, that
allows you to look

00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:51.570
at a series of these
indicators, in such a way

00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:53.920
that you can generate
a series of charts.

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:55.970
Now, I've kind of fast
tracked this process,

00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:59.060
so that we can get to
what we actually track.

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:03.680
So we track everything
from-- so imagine

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:06.730
you have a cassava farmer
coming in for a loan.

00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:08.250
Now, cassava to
Nigerians is what's

00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:11.000
equivalent to the corn story
that I told you about in Kenya,

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.839
they eat it every single day.

00:17:12.839 --> 00:17:15.670
Now, as you can see,
cassava production--

00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:17.710
if you're a credit
officer, you have

00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:20.470
to understand the volatility
in production cycles.

00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:23.380
That you'll see in 2009,
there was a cassava crisis.

00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:25.300
You'll want to understand
why that happened,

00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:26.960
and how you can think
of that differently.

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:28.459
That actually
happened because there

00:17:28.459 --> 00:17:32.910
was flooding in the core cassava
producing regions of Nigeria

00:17:32.910 --> 00:17:33.940
at the time.

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:38.090
Now what ends up happening when
you have that sort of rainfall,

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:40.160
and that sort of drop
in cassava production,

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:43.126
is you have a drastic
import of wheat.

00:17:43.126 --> 00:17:44.750
Wheat is the alternative to it.

00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:48.820
And the US provides 80%
of the wheat into Nigeria.

00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:51.060
And so you can track vegetation.

00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:53.395
So you can actually
watch how vegetation

00:17:53.395 --> 00:17:55.630
in a particular region evolves.

00:17:55.630 --> 00:17:57.880
By being able to look
at, and dynamically

00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:02.990
visualize all this data
that is incredibly complex--

00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:05.590
this is not coming
from a single source.

00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:08.210
Each one looks at
various sources

00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:10.610
to extrapolate what the
true number should be.

00:18:10.610 --> 00:18:13.920
Because no one source
actually tells us what it is.

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:17.070
And so what we're
hoping, is that this tool

00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:20.810
becomes the tool that allows
us to basically unleash capital

00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:24.060
into African agricultural
markets, to increase the yields

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:26.580
so that farmers can
basically produce more

00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:30.440
on the existing plots of land,
which then feeds into more

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:32.820
investment going into all
that other arable land

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:36.990
that I discussed, which
then leads to abundant food,

00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:39.736
and hopefully cheap food.

00:18:39.736 --> 00:18:41.624
Thanks.

00:18:41.624 --> 00:18:46.350
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:50.870
MEGAN SMITH: OK, so a quick
question for Sara before you

00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:52.870
go down, and then we'll
take the next one up.

00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:54.680
So we're going to
go to brainstorming,

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:56.263
and there's going
to be two tables who

00:18:56.263 --> 00:18:58.420
are going to work on this idea.

00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:00.880
So in addition to all
the ideas that they think

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:02.630
of, whatever they think
of, two thirds yes

00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:05.420
and-- what kind of distro,
technology, partners,

00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:07.370
money, other ideas that
you guys can think of,

00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:08.770
that would help this idea.

00:19:08.770 --> 00:19:10.867
And then, one third
yes but, meaning

00:19:10.867 --> 00:19:12.700
like, what are your
critiques and challenges

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:14.740
you think are there,
and some ideas there.

00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:18.240
Is there any set of things, one
or two things that you really

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:20.749
need help on right now, that
you know, as you are building?

00:19:20.749 --> 00:19:22.290
SARA MENKER: As
we're building, well,

00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:24.150
there's two things
I can think of.

00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:27.550
One is, we just actually
finished our first fund raise,

00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:31.590
and we're out there hiring all
sorts of talent from front end,

00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:34.280
to back end, to machine learning
engineers-- we need people.

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:36.680
And the second,
is the tool that I

00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:39.760
showed you, which is the
visualization around satellite

00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:42.760
imagery, and weather data,
everything we've done

00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:44.640
is basically, allow
it to be animatable.

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:46.860
So a user gets to
curate their experience

00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:49.550
and get to zoom in to
a particular region.

00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:51.730
And then say, I want to
understand the 10 day

00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:53.360
average in this
particular region,

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:55.030
versus the 10 day average there.

00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:57.650
And so when you're running
a series of computations

00:19:57.650 --> 00:19:59.837
on images that are
varying anyway,

00:19:59.837 --> 00:20:02.170
that are coming in daily, or
varying anywhere from being

00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:06.590
50 meter squared to you
know, 100 meter square,

00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:09.560
you run into all
sorts of challenges,

00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:11.740
in terms of giving
it to the user.

00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:14.670
So we're thinking about ways
of optimizing that further--

00:20:14.670 --> 00:20:15.490
MEGAN SMITH: To
simplify, and enhance--

00:20:15.490 --> 00:20:16.690
SARA MENKER: Yes,
simplifying that process.

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:17.695
MEGAN SMITH: --and figure
out how to interact.

00:20:17.695 --> 00:20:17.940
OK.

00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:19.510
SARA MENKER: Yeah, so
we're on geospatial.

00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:20.468
MEGAN SMITH: OK, super.

00:20:20.468 --> 00:20:21.990
All right, thank you.

00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:25.090
Next up is a really
interesting idea

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:28.390
around environmental
data and impact.

00:20:28.390 --> 00:20:34.050
And Randy, I just love
when, a lot of times

00:20:34.050 --> 00:20:38.060
we think about China, and
we hear terrible stories,

00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:39.800
scary stories about environment.

00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:44.110
And you guys are such a hopeful,
and inventive, and ingenious

00:20:44.110 --> 00:20:46.260
story from China,
of what you've done.

00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:48.230
And so I look forward
to everybody hearing

00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:49.577
what you guys are proposing.

00:20:49.577 --> 00:20:50.660
LIU CHUNLEI: OK thank you.

00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:51.860
Hi, everybody.

00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:53.210
Good afternoon.

00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:56.200
I'm Lui Chunlei,
from Shanghai, China.

00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:59.940
My topic is How to support
the Environmental Protection

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:02.810
information technology in China?

00:21:02.810 --> 00:21:06.310
This is our website.

00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:11.230
OK I think many guys
know China is facing

00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:14.200
one the most serious
environment issues.

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:19.340
Billions of people are impacted
by this, such as water.

00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:22.735
This is the from
new, the [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:22.735 --> 00:21:25.340
The water quality
of most of the river

00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:28.390
are the worst level in China.

00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:32.535
And also, the ground water
is a polluted heavily.

00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:43.110
For air, more than
1,200,000 people

00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:49.010
died earlier due to the
air pollution in China.

00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:52.890
You can see Shanghai is in haze.

00:21:56.392 --> 00:21:57.100
And the farmland.

00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:03.430
More than 50 million
acres of farmland

00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:05.030
are heavily polluted in China.

00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:14.110
We know the environment
issue is very, very serious.

00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:24.050
This is also an example,
the haze of days in 2013.

00:22:24.050 --> 00:22:27.990
We know, almost everyday
we can find the [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:30.300
from the news paper, or the TV.

00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:35.130
But we are not sure,
first for citizens,

00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:42.190
they're not sure what exactly
is the environment around him.

00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:46.740
And how to resolve the
pollution issue in a rapid way,

00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:49.310
because you know there
is some relationship

00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:51.660
between the government
and the factory.

00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:55.080
It's not so easy to
resolve this issue.

00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:59.815
So this is why I left
Alcatel-Lucent-- I worked there

00:22:59.815 --> 00:23:04.770
for more than eight
years-- to start this job.

00:23:04.770 --> 00:23:09.580
I want to help people
in a foreign way.

00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:17.880
Out of our million users, you
can find [INAUDIBLE], how to,

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:23.100
through maps, how to help
him, and to resolve something.

00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:26.850
He wants an apartment.

00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:30.450
So he search one
real estate website,

00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:33.950
and found this apartment is OK.

00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:37.270
But he want to know
whether it is safe or not.

00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:41.430
Then he could go to the
danger map, and to search.

00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:45.140
Input the address, and search.

00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:48.680
And then he found that
there are many-- not

00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:57.150
many-- for some site, there are
some pollutions issues wrong.

00:23:57.150 --> 00:24:01.740
So he need to
reconsider this choice,

00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:03.240
and he need to try again.

00:24:06.010 --> 00:24:11.940
After sometimes searching,
he found [INAUDIBLE] is OK.

00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:16.350
But of some amounts,
he found that the water

00:24:16.350 --> 00:24:18.920
released some bad materials.

00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:24.370
So he bought a water
testing kits [INAUDIBLE],

00:24:24.370 --> 00:24:28.040
and he started to
sample the water.

00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:31.000
The results was varying.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:38.980
So he upload this result
with the smartphone

00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:42.500
onto the [INAUDIBLE] map.

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:46.095
And shared this map
to his neighbors,

00:24:46.095 --> 00:24:46.970
and also [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:53.520
Then the neighbors gather
together, and have a meeting.

00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:56.250
They decided to walk
along the river,

00:24:56.250 --> 00:25:00.300
to find the cause,
why this is polluted?

00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:01.430
Why is this [INAUDIBLE]?

00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:07.430
And finally, they
found one factory,

00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:12.520
releasing the pollution water
directly without any deals.

00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:19.730
They put the exact
position on the danger map.

00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:26.990
And they searched
the number the EPB,

00:25:26.990 --> 00:25:31.690
and tried to push them
to stop this factory,

00:25:31.690 --> 00:25:34.260
to stop this pollution.

00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:36.550
But it's not so easy.

00:25:36.550 --> 00:25:39.590
Just [INAUDIBLE], there's
a complex relationship

00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:43.370
between the government and
the factory for some tax,

00:25:43.370 --> 00:25:46.920
or for other reasons,
corruption and so on.

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:50.990
So they need to continue,
they need to go on, to push,

00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:56.670
and go on to such,
many more pollutions.

00:25:56.670 --> 00:26:00.770
Now this is the current
danger map, they can help,

00:26:00.770 --> 00:26:01.480
it can help.

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:06.953
It can help to found some
of the pollution around it.

00:26:06.953 --> 00:26:15.000
And to gather the
neighbors, to [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:20.210
And now, they are more big
companies, also in the world ,

00:26:20.210 --> 00:26:21.620
such as Alibaba.

00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:25.120
The prompt there, [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:28.880
And water test kits
to their employees.

00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:36.540
So last year, they had
tested the 420 locations

00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:40.420
across 28 provinces.

00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:43.150
And also, more medias
and foundations

00:26:43.150 --> 00:26:49.920
involved, such as Southern
Weekly, [INAUDIBLE] DFDaily,

00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:52.100
and the SEE foundation.

00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:56.520
And also, there are many
NGOs are using this tool

00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:59.800
to identify these
pollutions and recourse.

00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:08.270
But citizens think it
is not good enough.

00:27:08.270 --> 00:27:12.640
So the need better services.

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:15.980
So we are planning the
following features.

00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:19.380
Not only now, whether
there are pollution,

00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:23.850
there are factories,
but know exactly

00:27:23.850 --> 00:27:27.140
is there any record
for the pollution,

00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:30.660
and what the realtime
water or gas is released

00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:33.530
and whether it
exceeded the threshold.

00:27:33.530 --> 00:27:41.360
With this information published,
so the real estate developers,

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:44.860
many of them are
millionaires or billionaires,

00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:49.100
can help control the pollution,
because this ill impact

00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:51.196
the price to their apartment.

00:27:56.190 --> 00:28:00.740
Also, currently there are many
data controlled by government,

00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:06.320
but they didn't publish
or not a convenient way.

00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:10.040
So we needed to
summit the application

00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:15.880
to open it, and show them,
and analyze and show them

00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:17.990
to the citizens, in
a convenient way.

00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:25.210
Also, they need-- maybe you
have the air quality and water

00:28:25.210 --> 00:28:28.800
quality, with real
time history and trend.

00:28:33.130 --> 00:28:35.930
And also, we need
to know if there

00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:38.800
any good things around
us, not only bad things.

00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:43.280
So we can give people some hope.

00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:45.190
And also comments
about the environment

00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:46.350
from the local citizens.

00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:53.760
When he found some
pollution issue,

00:28:53.760 --> 00:29:02.370
he can share this information
to also NGOs and medias.

00:29:02.370 --> 00:29:05.610
Because this, they
will help them

00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:08.270
to fix this, to
resolve this issue.

00:29:08.270 --> 00:29:12.220
And we will present the
phone number, email, Weibo,

00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:14.535
and Weixin, in the EPB.

00:29:14.535 --> 00:29:21.585
So they can contact the
partners in a really rapid way,

00:29:21.585 --> 00:29:26.030
to set up the [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:26.030 --> 00:29:30.910
And if the citizen contribute
to a local environment

00:29:30.910 --> 00:29:35.750
reach some criteria,
you will get some gifts

00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:37.440
from some big company.

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:40.590
This company-- this big
companies, [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:40.590 --> 00:29:46.040
their brand, and want to make
of their brand environment

00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:47.000
friendly.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:51.550
So in this way,
also the employees

00:29:51.550 --> 00:29:54.450
of these big companies
can be involved.

00:29:54.450 --> 00:29:58.340
It's millions, I think.

00:29:58.340 --> 00:30:02.850
And in China, there
are also many NGOs

00:30:02.850 --> 00:30:04.570
for environment protection.

00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:08.610
We will design a
mechanism, so they

00:30:08.610 --> 00:30:11.620
can be involved in
a more deeper way.

00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:17.780
So we can support each other,
and also impact their fans.

00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:25.490
The draft plan-- a new,
open interactive danger

00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:32.490
maps with solid data, will be
built in the following way.

00:30:32.490 --> 00:30:36.290
Because China, there
are many provinces.

00:30:36.290 --> 00:30:39.646
So we want to run it this way.

00:30:43.310 --> 00:30:49.840
And then we want to implement,
with this architecture.

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:53.930
So, with the air quality,
water quality, land quality,

00:30:53.930 --> 00:30:55.880
and the pollution sources.

00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:59.520
All data will be collected
into the open DB.

00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:03.510
Open means open to the
third party and you.

00:31:03.510 --> 00:31:07.040
And other stakeholders.

00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:09.850
And then, with the
EPB and the web,

00:31:09.850 --> 00:31:15.070
the information can easily
be shared, or feed back

00:31:15.070 --> 00:31:20.440
to the government,
factory, and the reporters.

00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:27.920
So, citizens can know the
overall environment around us,

00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:33.280
and also, action, to
change them in a rapid way.

00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:40.250
Technically, we will implement
this with such technologies,

00:31:40.250 --> 00:31:45.590
internal DB, node.js, mirrors,
and Hybrid App, binaries,

00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:48.250
and so on.

00:31:48.250 --> 00:31:52.110
That's the technical
architecture.

00:31:52.110 --> 00:31:54.920
Yeah, that's all.

00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:56.568
Thank you.

00:31:56.568 --> 00:32:00.910
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:00.910 --> 00:32:01.910
PUNEET AHIRA: Fantastic.

00:32:01.910 --> 00:32:03.510
Thank you so much, Liu.

00:32:03.510 --> 00:32:06.530
I think what's amazing about
this story, is how much

00:32:06.530 --> 00:32:08.840
attention it's
gotten within China.

00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:12.040
Jack Ma, who is the CEO
and founder of Alibaba,

00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:13.800
has personally been
supporting this,

00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:15.490
trying to get all
of his employees

00:32:15.490 --> 00:32:17.760
to be much more
environmentally active.

00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:20.050
And this just provides an
outlet for all of that,

00:32:20.050 --> 00:32:23.330
to become so much more
exposed and transparent.

00:32:23.330 --> 00:32:26.747
Liu, if you have-- I wanted
to get your perspective, what

00:32:26.747 --> 00:32:28.330
are the biggest
challenges that you're

00:32:28.330 --> 00:32:30.780
facing that this group
can brainstorm about,

00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:32.070
during our breakout session?

00:32:34.650 --> 00:32:38.550
LIU CHUNLEI: The
first one is the data.

00:32:38.550 --> 00:32:41.350
The environmental data
is [INAUDIBLE] for China,

00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:43.600
such as farmland.

00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:47.180
Pollution data is
a secret of nation.

00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:48.710
So we can not get it.

00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:51.720
And there are also
many data [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:55.700
that is not so easy
to dig, to analysis.

00:32:55.700 --> 00:33:01.070
So we need some way to
many, many application,

00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:03.550
for to government,
to open the data.

00:33:03.550 --> 00:33:05.310
This is the first one.

00:33:05.310 --> 00:33:09.230
I think the second
one is we need

00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:13.790
more support from
financial partners.

00:33:13.790 --> 00:33:16.040
There are many
jobs needed to do.

00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:18.770
But we need more
support, I think, yeah.

00:33:18.770 --> 00:33:19.770
PUNEET AHIRA: Excellent.

00:33:19.770 --> 00:33:20.942
Thank you so much again.

00:33:20.942 --> 00:33:22.150
LIU CHUNLEI: Yeah, thank you.

00:33:22.150 --> 00:33:24.566
PUNEET AHIRA: Our next-- sorry,
another round of applause,

00:33:24.566 --> 00:33:25.640
if you--

00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:29.230
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:29.230 --> 00:33:32.180
Our next speaker is
Professor Sarah Bergbreiter,

00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:33.840
from the University of Maryland.

00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:36.480
And she's got a
fascinating proposal

00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:38.380
that she's going to
present, on the use

00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:40.620
of micro robotic
platforms, and all

00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:42.130
of the incredible
applications it

00:33:42.130 --> 00:33:44.702
has for many of the
challenges that we face.

00:33:44.702 --> 00:33:45.910
SARAH BERGBREITER: All right.

00:33:45.910 --> 00:33:48.210
Thank you very much.

00:33:48.210 --> 00:33:54.290
So this is the Minnesota I-35
bridge, about seven years ago

00:33:54.290 --> 00:33:55.950
in 2007.

00:33:55.950 --> 00:34:00.030
This bridge supported over
140,000 cars each day.

00:34:00.030 --> 00:34:02.720
When the bridge collapsed,
there were over 150 casualties,

00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:04.850
including about 13 deaths.

00:34:04.850 --> 00:34:07.380
To avoid scenes like
this, which are far, far

00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:10.460
more common in the
developing world,

00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:12.610
the current solution is
to do something like this.

00:34:12.610 --> 00:34:15.460
Basically hang a couple
guys under a bridge,

00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:19.820
with some lights, looking at
the bridge structure, and joints

00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:22.609
and sure making sure everything
is structurally sound.

00:34:22.609 --> 00:34:24.400
And honestly, you're
probably lucky if this

00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:26.139
happens every couple years.

00:34:26.139 --> 00:34:28.600
In the developing world, you're
lucky if it happens at all,

00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:29.690
I think.

00:34:29.690 --> 00:34:33.880
So we'd like to come up with
a better solution for that.

00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:36.389
Another thing that you
see on TV way too often,

00:34:36.389 --> 00:34:37.500
is scenes like this.

00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:42.570
So this is the aftermath of the
New Zealand earthquake in 2011.

00:34:42.570 --> 00:34:44.870
You see a bunch of guys
searching through some rubble,

00:34:44.870 --> 00:34:47.699
trying to find survivors,
after this rather catastrophic

00:34:47.699 --> 00:34:48.601
earthquake.

00:34:48.601 --> 00:34:50.600
And you have even more
catastrophic earthquakes,

00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:52.400
like in Haiti and the like.

00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:53.969
But these enormous
piles of rubble,

00:34:53.969 --> 00:34:55.302
and how do you get through them?

00:34:55.302 --> 00:34:56.550
How do you find survivors?

00:34:56.550 --> 00:35:00.070
We'd like to be able to create
more scenes like this one,

00:35:00.070 --> 00:35:03.510
where rescuers found a four
month old baby, shortly

00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:05.930
after the Japanese tsunami.

00:35:05.930 --> 00:35:08.680
So what kind of infrastructure--
what kind of platform

00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:11.100
can we use to help us solve
both of these problems?

00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:13.790
Things like civil infrastructure
monitoring, and searching

00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:17.270
for survivors after
something like an earthquake.

00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:18.890
I'm going to propose this guy.

00:35:18.890 --> 00:35:20.010
This is an ant.

00:35:20.010 --> 00:35:22.630
Or more appropriately,
this guy, right here.

00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:24.640
This is a robotic
version of an ant,

00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:27.410
that we're working on in my lab
at the University of Maryland.

00:35:27.410 --> 00:35:29.850
So I'll talk a little bit
more about this guy later.

00:35:29.850 --> 00:35:32.220
And I have it with
me, in my bag,

00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:35.670
if anybody would like to see
it a little bit later, as well.

00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:38.480
But these things can do some
fascinating things, right?

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:41.530
We have some amazing
existence proofs

00:35:41.530 --> 00:35:44.620
in biology of what
these insects can do.

00:35:44.620 --> 00:35:47.910
Ants can build bridges out of
themselves, for other ants.

00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:48.980
Really incredible stuff.

00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:52.510
You've all seen ants carry
Cheerios or Potato chips off

00:35:52.510 --> 00:35:54.510
of your picnic table, I'm sure.

00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:56.590
Much to your chagrin, right?

00:35:56.590 --> 00:35:59.600
Termites, which are very
much on the same scale,

00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:02.180
build these incredible
structures, up to eight meters

00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:04.960
high-- effectively well
ventilated, air conditioned,

00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:06.930
apartment buildings
for other termites.

00:36:06.930 --> 00:36:07.430
Right?

00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:08.680
So impressive structures.

00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:10.190
I don't think
anybody would argue

00:36:10.190 --> 00:36:11.770
that something
the size of an ant

00:36:11.770 --> 00:36:13.450
can get through
some of that rubble,

00:36:13.450 --> 00:36:17.060
and has the appropriate sensors,
and communications on board,

00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:20.144
notify first responders
after an earthquake.

00:36:20.144 --> 00:36:21.560
And the ants and
insects this size

00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:23.860
can also make themselves
comfortably at home,

00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:27.160
on fairly complex
structures like a bridge.

00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:29.720
So what do we need to do in
order to engineer this ant?

00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:33.140
What do we need to do to
create an engineered robot ant?

00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:37.070
Or probably more appropriately,
bunches of these robot ants.

00:36:37.070 --> 00:36:39.322
So we can need
buckets full of them.

00:36:39.322 --> 00:36:41.530
So I'll briefly go through
some of the big challenges

00:36:41.530 --> 00:36:42.650
that I see.

00:36:42.650 --> 00:36:43.632
So, one is mobility.

00:36:43.632 --> 00:36:44.340
I'm really small.

00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:45.940
Everything else
around me is big.

00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:47.670
How do I get through that?

00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:49.900
I also need
mechanisms, and motors,

00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:51.430
in order to support
that mobility.

00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:53.320
And I need them to be
robust, and efficient,

00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:55.170
in order to get
through these things.

00:36:55.170 --> 00:36:58.030
I need the power, the control,
the integration, in order

00:36:58.030 --> 00:37:01.310
to add sensors, communication
potentially, in order

00:37:01.310 --> 00:37:04.310
to be able to localmote, and
get through these environments.

00:37:04.310 --> 00:37:07.460
And perhaps even more
importantly, in the end,

00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:09.050
I need group behavior.

00:37:09.050 --> 00:37:11.440
So I can do impressive
things like this,

00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:13.470
which you've all seen probably.

00:37:13.470 --> 00:37:15.630
In this case, a bunch of
ants found a tasty treat,

00:37:15.630 --> 00:37:17.310
a dead grasshopper.

00:37:17.310 --> 00:37:21.357
They're managing to extricate
it from these dead leaves,

00:37:21.357 --> 00:37:22.940
and slowly move it
towards their nest.

00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:24.890
And you can see this
incredible locomotion

00:37:24.890 --> 00:37:26.950
through this rather
rough terrain.

00:37:26.950 --> 00:37:28.559
Imagine your Roomba
at home, trying

00:37:28.559 --> 00:37:30.100
to do this kind of
same thing, right?

00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:30.700
Horrible.

00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:33.080
Like it sees a step,
and it's like, ah!

00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:36.580
So we want to be able to
do something like this.

00:37:36.580 --> 00:37:38.080
So for the sake
of time, I'm going

00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:40.075
to focus on a couple
of these challenges.

00:37:40.075 --> 00:37:41.700
We're working on all
of them in my lab.

00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:43.040
And I'm happy to talk
a little bit more

00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:44.740
about some of the
other ones as well.

00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:48.230
But I'll focus a little bit on
mobility mechanisms and motors.

00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:50.120
So first, mobility.

00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:51.500
So this is another insect.

00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:53.040
You already saw the ants
moving through these things.

00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:56.219
This is from across the bay at
Bob Full's lab at UC Berkeley,

00:37:56.219 --> 00:37:58.760
watching cockroaches get through
this incredible environment,

00:37:58.760 --> 00:37:58.960
right?

00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:00.630
If you and I tried to get
through an environment

00:38:00.630 --> 00:38:01.338
like this, right?

00:38:01.338 --> 00:38:03.470
We're looking down, making
sure our foot is stable,

00:38:03.470 --> 00:38:05.000
before we take our next step.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.180
Cockroaches don't
do any of this.

00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:09.710
The mechanisms in their
leg provide the control

00:38:09.710 --> 00:38:11.510
and the stability,
so that they can

00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:14.084
run through these
environments at high speeds.

00:38:14.084 --> 00:38:15.750
And part of what
allows them to do that,

00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:17.550
is a combination of
rigid materials, which

00:38:17.550 --> 00:38:20.242
is what we traditionally used
to make robots, but also soft,

00:38:20.242 --> 00:38:22.700
[INAUDIBLE], elastic materials,
that give them the damping,

00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:24.780
to enable them to do this.

00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:26.560
Another interesting
method of locomotion,

00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:28.860
if you're really
small, is jumping.

00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:31.540
And there's all sorts of
interesting jumping insects

00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:32.427
out there.

00:38:32.427 --> 00:38:34.385
In this case, they store
energy in effectively,

00:38:34.385 --> 00:38:36.343
a spring, and release
that very quickly, to get

00:38:36.343 --> 00:38:38.524
the high power
they need to jump.

00:38:38.524 --> 00:38:40.940
And then once again, it's a
combination of rigid materials

00:38:40.940 --> 00:38:43.520
and soft materials, that
enable them to do things

00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:47.180
like jump out of water,
which is quite impressive.

00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:52.110
So our big contribution has
been to add soft materials

00:38:52.110 --> 00:38:54.640
to traditional micro
fabrication processes.

00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:57.500
So micro fabrication allows
us to get structures down

00:38:57.500 --> 00:38:59.130
to microns in size-- right?

00:38:59.130 --> 00:39:02.050
Your hair is typically 50
to 100 microns in diameter,

00:39:02.050 --> 00:39:03.470
for reference.

00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:05.390
And in this case,
we can also take

00:39:05.390 --> 00:39:07.610
advantage of a lot of the
sensors and actuators,

00:39:07.610 --> 00:39:10.590
that people are you
doing in Silicon,

00:39:10.590 --> 00:39:13.830
with our future micro robots.

00:39:13.830 --> 00:39:16.350
So what do we do to do
this, to incorporate

00:39:16.350 --> 00:39:18.060
these soft materials,
is we effectively

00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:19.310
have a micro molding process.

00:39:19.310 --> 00:39:21.850
We etch trenches into
our silicon wafer.

00:39:21.850 --> 00:39:25.210
We refill that with a
rubber, silicone elastomer,

00:39:25.210 --> 00:39:26.840
which is the blue here.

00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:30.240
We etch more trenches, to
create our silicon features.

00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:32.480
And we can do this, across
a whole silicon wafer,

00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:34.400
so we can make thousands
of these at once--

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:36.129
which is the cool thing.

00:39:36.129 --> 00:39:37.920
So we can make some
interesting structures.

00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:39.660
But you ask, OK,
so this is cool,

00:39:39.660 --> 00:39:41.740
but how do I get my robot?

00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:43.970
So this is an interesting
little jumping mechanism

00:39:43.970 --> 00:39:45.490
that we put together.

00:39:45.490 --> 00:39:47.890
This video, this whole thing
is about four millimeters

00:39:47.890 --> 00:39:49.040
on a side.

00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:51.362
This video is very freaky,
to any [INAUDIBLE] person,

00:39:51.362 --> 00:39:53.320
or micro fabrication
person, because you're not

00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:56.940
used to seeing strains like this
in traditional micro machining

00:39:56.940 --> 00:39:58.160
materials.

00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:00.050
So the basic idea
behind this is,

00:40:00.050 --> 00:40:03.670
I'm going to take the structure
of four millimeters in size,

00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:07.280
compress it, and release that
energy, in order to get a jump.

00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:10.000
So there's no motors
on this, no power yet.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.000
This is actuated in a very
fancy method, we have in our lab

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:16.390
called graduate
student with tweezers.

00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:19.230
So what we're going to
see in the next video,

00:40:19.230 --> 00:40:21.350
is a black, fuzzy dot
flying through the air.

00:40:21.350 --> 00:40:24.020
So this is a very
small, black, fuzzy dot.

00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:26.600
This is Erin, the graduate
student in question.

00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:29.160
And what you see here, is this
little four millimeter device

00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:32.500
jumping almost 100
times it's own length.

00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:35.140
But once again, no motors, no
power or anything like that.

00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:39.160
But incredibly robust-- it
actually bounces on the table.

00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:41.700
It's survives over and over,
and over, until we eventually

00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:43.430
lose it, when it
flies off the screen.

00:40:46.302 --> 00:40:48.010
How are we going to
actuate these things?

00:40:48.010 --> 00:40:51.370
Well, this is some of the motors
that we're doing in our lab.

00:40:51.370 --> 00:40:53.900
They have high power densities--
higher than insect flight

00:40:53.900 --> 00:40:54.900
muscle, in fact.

00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:58.300
But they're still very hard to
integrate with the mechanisms

00:40:58.300 --> 00:41:01.190
that I just showed you, in
order to really study locomotion

00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:02.500
at this scale.

00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:03.530
So we're going to cheat.

00:41:03.530 --> 00:41:05.989
We're going to put
magnets in here right now.

00:41:05.989 --> 00:41:08.280
And this is controlled with
an external magnetic field.

00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:11.150
But you can see, I have this
compliant elastomer joint.

00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:12.960
I've got a magnet
embedded in there.

00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:15.470
And this is effectively,
a little robot leg.

00:41:15.470 --> 00:41:18.480
So this would be part of
what I showed you earlier,

00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:20.722
in this little
micro robot mock up.

00:41:20.722 --> 00:41:23.263
One of the interesting things
about locomotion at this scale,

00:41:23.263 --> 00:41:25.770
is that we don't really
know how to do it yet.

00:41:25.770 --> 00:41:27.660
So we have good
models for everything

00:41:27.660 --> 00:41:28.820
from a cockroach on up.

00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:30.565
If you want to know
how we run, you

00:41:30.565 --> 00:41:33.390
can basically think
of a mass on a spring.

00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:34.850
And we compress
this spring as we

00:41:34.850 --> 00:41:37.250
land, and release that
energy as we take off.

00:41:37.250 --> 00:41:38.930
Everything does this.

00:41:38.930 --> 00:41:41.880
As you get smaller, the forces
in interacting with the ground

00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:44.485
are going to start to
affect your locomotion, more

00:41:44.485 --> 00:41:46.610
potentially than your mass
and your inertia-- which

00:41:46.610 --> 00:41:49.190
is very tiny, when
you're this small.

00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:52.420
So this particular one
is not working quite yet.

00:41:52.420 --> 00:41:54.110
But we have ones at
centimeter cubed,

00:41:54.110 --> 00:41:56.151
to show you what these
things actually look like,

00:41:56.151 --> 00:41:57.380
when they're moving around.

00:41:57.380 --> 00:42:01.130
So these guys, we've moved at up
to 10 body lengths per second.

00:42:01.130 --> 00:42:03.630
So they can move quite quick,
and that's really only limited

00:42:03.630 --> 00:42:04.960
by our test set up.

00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:07.210
So this gives you an idea
of how the magnetic field is

00:42:07.210 --> 00:42:08.660
controlling these guys.

00:42:08.660 --> 00:42:10.870
So we can actually start
studying how we ultimately

00:42:10.870 --> 00:42:13.850
want to locamote, to solve
some of these challenges.

00:42:13.850 --> 00:42:16.224
But ultimately, we want to
add our sensors and control,

00:42:16.224 --> 00:42:17.390
and everything on board too.

00:42:17.390 --> 00:42:19.280
So this guy is about
four millimeters,

00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:22.105
by four millimeters, by
seven millimeters in size.

00:42:22.105 --> 00:42:24.030
It has capacitors for power.

00:42:24.030 --> 00:42:25.862
It has a transistor for control.

00:42:25.862 --> 00:42:27.320
And it has a light
sensor on board.

00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:30.160
So it's going to react to
light in its environment.

00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:32.060
And the actuator
in this case-- this

00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:33.960
is done by my student,
Wayne Churaman,

00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:36.060
who's also at the
Army Research Lab.

00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:38.970
The actuator, we don't need to
necessarily be bio inspired.

00:42:38.970 --> 00:42:40.970
The actuator is an energetic.

00:42:40.970 --> 00:42:42.590
It goes boom.

00:42:42.590 --> 00:42:46.770
So in this case, we can micro
fabricate small, little pixels

00:42:46.770 --> 00:42:48.707
of this energetic material.

00:42:48.707 --> 00:42:50.290
And we can set them
off independently,

00:42:50.290 --> 00:42:52.920
from multiple jumps or jumps
in different directions.

00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:56.600
And the cool thing about
this, is that we can actually

00:42:56.600 --> 00:43:00.140
combine this then, with
our robot that I showed you

00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:02.220
earlier, put it on
the belly of this.

00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:04.620
And we can effectively have
our little micro rocket robot

00:43:04.620 --> 00:43:05.980
for jumping.

00:43:05.980 --> 00:43:08.170
So the next video, one
of my favorite videos,

00:43:08.170 --> 00:43:11.462
you see this thing jump up--
the big flash at the beginning,

00:43:11.462 --> 00:43:12.920
this is at 1,000
frames per second,

00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:14.480
and it flies through the air.

00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:17.270
So, pretty, pretty
cool, I think, at least.

00:43:17.270 --> 00:43:20.110
So I think you have some idea
of how we can kind of jump

00:43:20.110 --> 00:43:22.130
around, crawl around
these big structures,

00:43:22.130 --> 00:43:23.910
or where we're going
with that, at least.

00:43:23.910 --> 00:43:26.420
But they're certainly not
limited-- these robotic insects

00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:28.950
are certainly not
limited to those ideas.

00:43:28.950 --> 00:43:30.930
Imagine like,
something even a larger

00:43:30.930 --> 00:43:35.376
than the fantastic, voyage
vehicle, for robotic surgery.

00:43:35.376 --> 00:43:37.250
Either in the US, or in
the developing world,

00:43:37.250 --> 00:43:39.650
you could do some really
fascinating things with that.

00:43:39.650 --> 00:43:42.670
Or imagine, if you can
combine sensors and actuators,

00:43:42.670 --> 00:43:44.490
and mechanisms in
very small packages,

00:43:44.490 --> 00:43:46.960
maybe you can create Luke's
hand from "Star Wars"

00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:49.140
versus the most advanced,
prosthetic hands

00:43:49.140 --> 00:43:50.640
that we have today.

00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:54.444
Or one of the big problems with
these earthquake disasters,

00:43:54.444 --> 00:43:56.110
is not necessarily
the disaster, itself,

00:43:56.110 --> 00:43:58.725
but the humanitarian disaster
that happens afterwards.

00:43:58.725 --> 00:44:00.660
So imagine building
temporary housing

00:44:00.660 --> 00:44:04.220
with lots of little robots,
like our termite mounds.

00:44:04.220 --> 00:44:07.010
Or even radically changing
the construction industry

00:44:07.010 --> 00:44:07.892
with this.

00:44:07.892 --> 00:44:09.350
So this gives you
some idea of some

00:44:09.350 --> 00:44:10.891
of the possibilities
of things that I

00:44:10.891 --> 00:44:13.410
think we could do
with small robots.

00:44:13.410 --> 00:44:16.050
And I think we're kind of on
the verge of really pushing

00:44:16.050 --> 00:44:17.060
this area out there.

00:44:17.060 --> 00:44:19.750
And so I think it's a
pretty fantastic Moonshot.

00:44:19.750 --> 00:44:22.110
And I thank you for your time.
