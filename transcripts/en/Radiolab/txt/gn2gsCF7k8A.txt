Speaker 1:          00:00          You are listening to radiolab radiolab from W. N. Y. S. T. E. N. N. P. R.

Speaker 2:          00:12          You don't take it down at one base of bed? No, this is fine. What are we doing about the podcast, by the way? Oh, do you? Should we do that now? Yup. Hey, I'm Jabil. Rod. This is radio lab. Yes, we, yes it is. No, we're doing the introduction. Ready? Here we go. Let's do it for real. Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich Radiolab podcast and today on the podcast we want to tell you about a guy who hears music in a way that is just extraordinary and painful. Just thinking about this story makes my head hurt. That's Jessica Banco. She's a reporter and she's the one who initially told me the story

Speaker 1:          00:49          a little while ago. I went up to visit this guy, Bob. Nice to see excuse my feet here. And he lives in a tiny town in Michigan with his wife Linda. And who is he? He's an amazing piano player. The Library of Congress actually called him a national treasure. Really? He's had this special relationship with music ever since. He was a boy. Did you grow up with any other instruments inside the house other than the piano or was that what you started out? Well,

Speaker 3:          01:25          I am, my mother made me take piano lessons and I hated it. I didn't like the sound of minor keys and the piano teachers had me playing a recital in which there's a Schubert minor. He piece in it. So on the recital I played it in major

Speaker 4:          01:51          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          01:52          and everyone thought that was a travesty.

Speaker 1:          01:57          These days though, his mean music isn't so much Schubert. It's actually ragtime,

Speaker 3:          02:02          one three, four, one, two, three, five the rhythms.

Speaker 1:          02:07          So the thing about ragtime is that oftentimes the player is actually playing two different rhythms at the same time. One with the left hand, one with the right hand, right.

Speaker 3:          02:16          Then you put the rhythms of three in there, right?

Speaker 1:          02:20          No. The thing about Bob is he can do this like times a thousand. What does that even mean? Well, let me back up. I first heard about Bob from a neurologist named Kirsten Betterman, Kristen Betterman, who's now at Penn State University. First time I heard about, but Milan was who friends first and heard about Bob from a colleague who'd seen him play for an audience, so I might just take a tune like he was actually playing multiple rhythms with his two different hands and switching back and forth between different pieces of music and carrying on a conversation so you should at the same time, well let's say it's not true. You can look up videos of Bob on youtube and you can see him performing and throwing out jokes, but at times you'll see him carry on a full conversation while playing from the perspective of a neurologist. This is actually really hard because the part of your brain that should be engaged in playing a piece of music that complicated should also be engaged in having a conversation.

Speaker 1:          03:21          The talking part and the playing part of the same part, the same part in most of us for most people, that sort of thing. Playing a complex piece of music and having a conversation would would interfere with one another. Yes. That's what you usually would think. Unless you're highly skilled and you play maybe one piece of music at a time that you've done multiple times, but even then it would be very difficult to this degree. So Kirsten got in touch with Bob and she started asking him some questions about the way you would perceive music and how in the course of chatting with him and talking about how he perceives music and all of this, he happened to say to her,

Speaker 3:          03:56          but I could hear, uh, an entire symphony in my hand and I didn't think that was too big a deal cause I always listened to two of them at once.

Speaker 1:          04:06          He told her I only have to focus on the one mentally that I want to hear at a given time. And then that's a piece I play. But I hear them all ongoing. Did he just say he can hear two different symphonies in his head at the same time? We thought this was very unusual. Yeah. But I mean are we talking the full symphonies or just the melodies? Every instrument. Every instrument. And he can focus in and

Speaker 3:          04:28          turn one of them up, one of them down and they both run the same old tediously. Huh. So then, um, she pushed to the envelope and asked me if I can, I hear three, three pieces of music as well. I don't know. Never tried. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          04:42          But he was like, yeah, I think I could do three. When we challenged them a little bit, actually you said, I can't do four if you asked me, but I wouldn't go any further than that. Nope. That's total just for symphonies at the same time.

Speaker 4:          04:58          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          04:59          that's just nothing but, but noise. Absolute cacophony. You know, the, the four pieces of music that just, wow. I said nobody can do this. [inaudible] was really critical. Yeah. Cause it's not true. We had to think about how to test this. Let me tell you about how the experiment worked and then tell me if you think it's true. All right. We came up with the behavioral test and so the first thing Kirsten had to do was find to control someone to compare Bob to, right. So she found a conductor, Peter Perri, who was the former conductor of the Winston Salem symphony, who is himself an accomplished musician. Before the test, she sent him in Bob, four pieces of music. We had a Schubert's and funny, yeah, we have rounds. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          05:47          Two

Speaker 4:          05:50          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          05:53          and finally one from Mendelson [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          06:00          So you have to keep in mind these four symphonies are in different keys and different tempos, very different. And the themes and instrumentations. And the challenge for them was to learn these before pieces of music. Completely memorize them for different tunes. And they only gave me a couple of days to listen to them and then play them in their mind. And we would then ask them where in a restorative piece they would be after an arbitrary time. I'm not really following. Okay, so here's what they did. They put these guys in the scanner and they said to them, I want you to play the music in your mind. Play the music in your mind, close your eyes and imagine the music. So no music is playing out loud, no music playing just inside their head. Are they imagining it? However they want or know exactly what they had heard on the CD. So same as is coming in and out. Yep. Same Tempo. So if it was a Vivace on the CD Vivace in their head. Exactly. And why were they doing this again? Well, they wanted to see if these guys could track via memory, these really complicated pieces of music. So they put the guys in the scanner, they're laying there and on a screen in front of them, the word start flashes and at that moment they start playing the first piece of music back in their head.

Speaker 4:          07:15          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          07:17          in the control room. They're tracking the music themselves to follow the timing. The researchers, yeah. Oh, so while Bob and the student are imagining it, they're actually keeping track of where the real CD is. Exactly.

Speaker 4:          07:32          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          07:33          they let it go for awhile.

Speaker 4:          07:37          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          07:37          and at an arbitrary moment they say stop and then they say, sing to me exactly where you are in the music. Like the note, the exact phrase,

Speaker 1:          07:49          they go back, they compare the timing to the CD, right. To find out if these guys can really recreate inside their heads. Exactly what they'd heard. And um, so I will conduct our control or is able to listen to one piece of music at a time and wants to really ride on target with the right answer on. Timing was in a second. Boom. So this conductors imagined symphony was only a second off from the real one. Yup. Same with Bob. So Bob's within a Notre too bad now. Round two, the multisite on task, as we called it, they told them both to start that first piece of music again.

Speaker 4:          08:26          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          08:26          and then a little bit later they said start the second piece of music

Speaker 4:          08:31          in your head

Speaker 1:          08:33          simultaneous

Speaker 4:          08:44          [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          08:44          all right. I've already like, come on. It's crazy. Like this is wishlist slipped in the fantasy and that's what happened for the conductor. He couldn't do it. He couldn't do two simultaneously. Yeah, of course. Couldn't do it. It's impossible.

Speaker 5:          08:56          Almost little chance. He said this is an overwhelming impossible task. His brain just shut down.

Speaker 2:          09:00          Well, like he died or something. He stopped even being able to track the first piece of music. Ah, he just got confused now where Yoda, Bob,

Speaker 3:          09:10          they put me into the MRI and the, they asked me stare tune one in your head. So I did.

Speaker 4:          09:21          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          09:22          then roughly 10, 15 seconds later, I got a message on the screen. It said continue listening to one start two and then 15 seconds later continued listening to tunes one and two starts three

Speaker 4:          09:46          [inaudible] the same thing is true for [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          10:08          then on the screen it's in Stanhope and then Kirsten came in a little, um, I could hear her talking to me from somewhere and she says, Bam, tell us where are you? Where are you in tune one fatal right now? What do you hear? So I told her and um, I didn't, I described, um, what the piece was playing at that point.

Speaker 2:          10:35          Does that Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah.

Speaker 3:          10:36          And the same thing with tuna,

Speaker 4:          10:40          three and four.

Speaker 3:          10:45          She announced that I was exactly right into the note in each one of the symphonies,

Speaker 5:          10:50          Jess

Speaker 2:          10:51          telling me something that's just not really, you know, I've got a lot of intentions. Just my common sense right now is yelling,

Speaker 5:          10:58          three-year-old. It really, it really is mind boggling to think about. Mixed. My brain hurt. But you know, we proved to you. Yeah, you can do it. When Kirsten gave you the different pieces of music to listen to,

Speaker 4:          11:09          Huh?

Speaker 3:          11:10          Did any of them clash? [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          11:13          no.

Speaker 3:          11:16          No. They don't clash it. They're all just playing different pieces. There's nothing chaotic about it.

Speaker 2:          11:20          All right. So assuming this is true, how does he do this? How does he explain to himself how he does this? So I think there's two things going on here. The first has to do with emotion, emotion,

Speaker 5:          11:34          FAPAs using different brain areas. I think in his case, probably more more emotional brain center.

Speaker 2:          11:40          Yeah. Motion deepens the way that we experience things, make stronger memories. And Bob has a really strong emotional relationship with music. With the wheel. Yeah. But it's a little bit beyond the whole minor keys make me feel sad.

Speaker 1:          11:54          He has really specific emotions associated with individual keys on the scale.

Speaker 3:          12:00          Huh? I'm gonna when I hear c major, it's a very bland, he is like, um, I don't know how to describe, it's like heating water, super, something like that. But d major, the break he, that makes me want to dance even though I can dance and every he ever, every one of the keys of the piano had a different emotional attachment to me.

Speaker 1:          12:24          So for Bob, if just the keys are triggering different emotions. Yeah. Imagine what it must be like when you get to actual music.

Speaker 4:          12:36          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          12:36          so you think that's something about how he experiences the emotions of the music makes it etch more deeply in his brain or something? Yeah, I think he's, when he's got these four pieces of music going, he's not thinking hard about tracking each one of them. He's already in them. He feels them inside his body and you can feel more with them one feeling at a time. So that's one idea. The second idea has to do actually more with image and space really listened to the two different pieces. So Bob often closes his eyes when he's talking. You don't hear. It just helps him focus. So I asked him if he could try playing back two pieces of music right now. And I asked him, when you hear these two symphonies in your head, what are you seeing?

Speaker 3:          13:24          I can picture, um, two symphony orchestra sitting side by side.

Speaker 1:          13:30          He actually sees the literal orchestras in his head.

Speaker 3:          13:33          Yeah. And I see them as silhouettes. There's no conductor in front of either one. There's a brownish hue out in front of them. Like it's just a floor that's more the color of the deep brown of a Valium and in back of them. And there's a semi-circle. It's bluish in color. Then when I listen to them, I'm going to listen to Brahms second symphony over in the left side,

Speaker 4:          14:03          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          14:03          and uh, over in the, uh, right side. Don't turn in. The emperor can share the third movement of NATO. And so I'm listening to that. No, these are in two different keys. Emperors and e flat. Brahms is d. So now if I want to pay particular attention, oh, let's say I'm going to listen to the emperor here. I'm going to go into the major. I just sped it up. Yeah, I can. I can. They can speed the thing out and they'd go to some of their part in it. I can jump backwards. Let's see, just a minute. I can hear it. An F, I can put it into any here. One, two but I'm going to rar forward in this third movement of the emperor here and I'm listening to the a e major variation on the piano, which is just like a, or it's just racking and this a beautiful, he made your part pivoting around to the Flint and going up and down from there and the piano.

Speaker 1:          14:59          Wow. Wow. So his crazy towns may have something to do with this movie making thing that he does in his head. Yeah, but it's not just a movie. It's like a three d movie. He can use it to find out where a specific instrument is. How do you mean? In his mind's eye, he can fly out over these orchestras and actually look down on the individual instrument he wants to see.

Speaker 3:          15:19          When I'm looking down and I see the piano out in front of them,

Speaker 1:          15:23          he can zoom in and see them playing their instrument.

Speaker 3:          15:26          Okay, now I'm up there in the air listening to this thing over and over on my left side. They can still hear this brown is going along at Brahms. I can only see the silhouettes from the front, whereas the gathering of the emperor for here, I can see full color and every person's face in it and plus here the lines that they're playing

Speaker 1:          15:44          and as he's flying out over these orchestras, the instruments actually get louder and softer depending on where he is. Like if he goes behind orchestra number one,

Speaker 3:          15:54          I can hear the bass, which can much louder than let's see and yeah. Then if I go over to the left side, I'm hearing the violins

Speaker 1:          16:01          and he says he can float right above the players and actually see [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          16:04          what they're doing. They can see every raincoat in the, in the pleaded shirts of their tech CEOs

Speaker 4:          16:11          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          16:12          and they can see the deep brownish orange color of the violas. And I can hear the deep sound, beautiful sound of that low viola

Speaker 4:          16:23          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          16:23          and I can hear every little Rhett Rosin scratch a cross their bows

Speaker 4:          16:33          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          16:33          God listening to music for this guy must be like, like an acid trip. The way that he's describing it, I think it is. And when he listens to recorded music, it's so much diminished from what he feels when he's imagining it. Huh. So he doesn't listen to cds. He cannot stand listening to cds Dow. Wow. Yeah. He's a real example of the extremes of the human mind. So what does he do with these crazy towns? I mean, is he a, is he like a, a, a billionaire? Nope. First of all, ragtime is not exactly the most popular form of music in the United States at this point. Um, but it's what he likes to play and he plays, you know, 250 shows a year. But a lot of them are at stark societies or churches.

Speaker 3:          17:18          Oh, Linda and I, we've had a small motor home. It's an airport bus, one of those little 15 passenger buses. It's got a hot shower and a bathroom and I'm bad too of course.

Speaker 1:          17:31          So you know, he travels around and his little motor home with his wife when he can and without her when he can't and sleeps in Walmart parking lots is working on an opera, which is mostly done. And he writes it in his head while he's driving and then he sits down in a McDonald's and writes it out on paper. And uh, you know, that's pretty much what he does with this

Speaker 4:          18:14          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          18:15          thanks to reporter Jess Banco for that great story. And also to producer Mark Phillips for making it sound so good. But why should we share the information that we just did? Why not do the outro in a way that Bob Millman fully and completely appreciate you mean? So we should say it all together in a big simultaneously he'll be able to think the Jed side and then the Roberts. Okay. Ready? Yep. You play the piano or listeners that are piano players from our label composure, Walmart, worst parts of those pianos. They get a Walmart right into discounting things today. The left hand hitting the piano. Did I see that.
