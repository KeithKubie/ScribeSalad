00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.560
In this lesson, we've discussed some of the basic skills

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:03.890
necessary to make an effective

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:06.660
information visualization. We've talked about some

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.280
of the best ways to visually encode data, and also

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.720
some of the most effective methods for charting different types of

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.100
data. We've also gone over the basics of making visualizations

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.460
in Python. If you find the individualization really interesting, I'd strongly

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.770
encourage you to look at some blogs or websites that

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.380
aggregate some of the most interesting data visualizations. It's not hard

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.180
to find them. Just go to Google, type in data visualization, and you'll come

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.170
across some really interesting stuff. You'll use

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.150
this new found data visualization know how to

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.480
make some really interesting graphics that communicate

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.620
our findings so far about subway ridership in

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.230
New York City. I'll be really interested to see what you guys come up with.
