filling for her and stuff and they just
 

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:35.580
filling for her and stuff and they just
CG the face but I think because all the

00:25:35.580 --> 00:25:35.590
CG the face but I think because all the
 

00:25:35.590 --> 00:25:37.230
CG the face but I think because all the
stuff that was really there was really

00:25:37.230 --> 00:25:37.240

there they had such expression in such a
motion and stuff like that when you see

00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:40.690
motion and stuff like that when you see
 

00:25:40.690 --> 00:25:43.590
motion and stuff like that when you see
the CG moving the wrinkles and you know

00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:43.600
the CG moving the wrinkles and you know
 

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:46.050
the CG moving the wrinkles and you know
sir smudging and moving and that's how

00:25:46.050 --> 00:25:46.060
sir smudging and moving and that's how
 

00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:48.480

you know what why did that necessarily
 

00:26:52.910 --> 00:26:55.000
you know what why did that necessarily
need to be CG unless they thought they

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:55.010
need to be CG unless they thought they
 

00:26:55.010 --> 00:26:57.640

right and I think that's where it was a
 

00:30:18.450 --> 00:30:20.659
right and I think that's where it was a
little bit of a must just the last 20

00:30:20.659 --> 00:30:20.669
little bit of a must just the last 20
 

00:30:20.669 --> 00:30:21.979
little bit of a must just the last 20

did them and here's like it's literally
 

00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:28.609
did them and here's like it's literally
like a handful of X wings just flying

00:30:28.609 --> 00:30:28.619
like a handful of X wings just flying
 

00:30:28.619 --> 00:30:30.080
