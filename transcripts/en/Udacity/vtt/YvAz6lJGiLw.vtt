00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The answer is that it is correct when it returns.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
All the values it builds up are correct, but unfortunately it doesn't always return.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Let's try to figure out why.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
In think about this, we want to think about recursive patterns.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Let's look at the pattern x+.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.000
We've definec x+ as being the sequence of x followed by x&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And now for most instances of x that's not a problem.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
If we had plus(lit('a')), it not going to be a problem.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
That's going to generate a, aa, aaa, and so on.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:46.000
But consider this--let's define a equals lit('a'), pat equals plus(opt('a')).

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Now, this should be the same. This should also generate a, aa, aaa.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
The way we can see that is we have a plus so that generates any number of these.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
If we pick a once, we get this. It we pick a twice we get this. If we pick a three times we get this.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
But the problem is there's all these other choices in between.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Opt(a) means we we can either be picking a or the empty string.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
As we go through the loop for plus, we could pick empty string, empty string, empty string.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
We could pick empty string an infinite number of times.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Even though our N is finite--

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
at some point we're going to ask for pattern of some N--

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:38.000
let's say the set {1, 2, 3}--we won't have a problem with having an infinite number of a's,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
but we will have a problem of choosing from the opt(a) the empty part.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
If an infinite number of times we choose the empty string rather than choosing a,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
then we're never going to get past three as the highest value.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
We're going to keep going forever.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
That's the problem. We've got to somehow say I don't want to keep choosing the empty string.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
I want to make progress and choose something each time through.

00:02:02.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So how can we make sure that happens?
