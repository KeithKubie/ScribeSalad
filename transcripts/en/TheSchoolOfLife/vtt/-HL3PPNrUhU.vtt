00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:05.710
We hear a lot about genius. We are taught
to admire the minds of those infinite, baffling

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:12.030
but astonishing geniuses like Einstein, Tolstoy
or Picasso. Quite what genius might actually

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:18.650
be is left a little vague. It’s a codeword
for ‘brilliant but perhaps too other-worldly

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:24.040
ever really to fathom.’ We are invited to
stand in awe at the achievements of geniuses

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:29.200
but also to feel that their thought processes
might be quasi-magical and that it is ultimately

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.851
simply mysterious how they were ever able
to come up with the ideas they have had. But

00:00:33.851 --> 00:00:39.330
there is a radically different view, suggested
by a hugely prescient quote from the 19th

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:48.770
century American genius Ralph Waldo Emerson:
In the minds of geniuses, we find – once

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:55.600
more – our own neglected thoughts. What
this tells us is that the genius doesn’t

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.340
have different kinds of thoughts from the
rest of us. They simply take them more seriously.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:07.080
We ourselves will often have had our own sketchy,
hesitant version of their ideas – which

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.060
is why their works can have such a distinctive
impression on us. What they present feels

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.100
surprising and impressive, of course; yet
also obvious and right – once it has been

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:24.159
pointed out. They are giving clear and powerful
articulation to notions that are already familiar

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:28.840
because we’ve been circling them ourselves,
possibly for years, without quite ever being

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.490
able to close in on them properly. Genius
can in this sense be defined as paying closer

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.909
attention to our real thoughts and feelings
and being brave and tenacious enough to hold

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:45.650
onto them even when they find no immediate
echo in the world beyond. The reason why we

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:52.280
disavow so much of what passes through our
minds is in essence anxiety. We kill off our

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.830
most promising thoughts for fear of seeming
strange to ourselves and others (which explains

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.200
why small children are, in their own way,
so much more interesting than the average

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:09.349
adult: they have not yet become experts in
what not to say or think). But when we censor

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:14.040
and close down, when we take fright and try
not to think, is exactly the moment when the

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:21.120
so-called genius starts to take note of what
is happening within their mind. We operate with

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.599
a false picture of genius when we identify
it too strongly with what is exotic and utterly

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:32.950
beyond us. It is something far more provocative
than this. Genius is what we all can be when

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.209
we pay careful attention to what is truly
passing through consciousness. We all have

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:44.959
very similar and very able minds; where geniuses
differ is in their more robust inclinations

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.880
to study them properly.
