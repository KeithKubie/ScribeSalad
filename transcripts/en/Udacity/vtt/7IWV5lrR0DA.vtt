00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.687
Today we'll learn how to
build a great Android TV app.

00:00:02.687 --> 00:00:06.647
Android TV is just Android
on a new form factor.

00:00:06.647 --> 00:00:09.441
So, if you're all ready proficient
with Android development,

00:00:09.441 --> 00:00:11.182
your existing skills will still apply.

00:00:11.182 --> 00:00:14.056
First, we'll work through
a starter project and

00:00:14.056 --> 00:00:16.800
explain how the key pieces work,
step by step.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.023
Next, we'll apply these concepts
that we've learned by enhancing

00:00:21.023 --> 00:00:24.153
the mobile version of
the universal media player to

00:00:24.153 --> 00:00:27.224
also run on the TV form
factor in the very same APK.

00:00:27.224 --> 00:00:30.228
Here's how the universal media
player looks when we start and

00:00:30.228 --> 00:00:32.142
here's how it looks when we're done.

00:00:32.142 --> 00:00:33.756
How cool is this?

00:00:33.756 --> 00:00:36.659
It's complete with high
quality animations and

00:00:36.659 --> 00:00:38.363
a responsive cinematic UI.

00:00:38.363 --> 00:00:41.150

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.320
To build our app, we're going to
leverage the Leanback Support Library.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.749
The Leanback Library is so
easy to use and so

00:00:46.749 --> 00:00:50.942
versatile that it's becoming synonymous
with writing Android TV apps.

00:00:50.942 --> 00:00:54.450
In fact,
this entire UI was built using Leanback,

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:56.991
with very little coding on our part.

00:00:56.991 --> 00:01:00.114
That said though,
Leanback is just a library.

00:01:00.114 --> 00:01:01.973
You don't have to use it at all.

00:01:01.973 --> 00:01:04.897
And you have complete freedom over
how your app looks and feels.

00:01:04.897 --> 00:01:08.000
Now, if you have an existing app you'd
like to run on the big screen, it's

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.006
important not to reuse the same activity
layout that you already have for

00:01:11.006 --> 00:01:11.908
phones and tablet's.

00:01:11.908 --> 00:01:15.434
Although, technically this will
work on Android TV, it'll make for

00:01:15.434 --> 00:01:16.698
a poor user experience.

00:01:16.698 --> 00:01:19.395
And if you do that,
Timothy Jordan will get angry and

00:01:19.395 --> 00:01:21.122
you don't want to see him angry.

00:01:21.122 --> 00:01:25.000
In reality, Timothy's a super
nice guy but just to be sure,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.132
your UI should be simple,
cinematic, and fun.

00:01:28.132 --> 00:01:30.779
For this lesson,
all you'll need is Android studio.

00:01:30.779 --> 00:01:34.945
We'll use a TV emulator to run our
code so everyone can participate.

00:01:34.945 --> 00:01:38.881
If you happen to have a real TV device
though, you can use that as well.

00:01:38.881 --> 00:01:42.551
In fact, I'd strongly recommend using
a real device instead of an emulator for

00:01:42.551 --> 00:01:43.987
developing production apps.

00:01:43.987 --> 00:01:45.252
Sound good?

00:01:45.252 --> 00:01:47.440
Let's get our app running
on the big screen.
