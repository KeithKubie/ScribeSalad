00:00:07.057 --> 00:00:10.659
The villainous Dr. Schrödinger 
has developed a growth ray

00:00:10.659 --> 00:00:13.953
and intends to create 
an army of giant cats

00:00:13.953 --> 00:00:16.083
to terrorize the city.

00:00:16.083 --> 00:00:17.542
Your team of secret agents

00:00:17.542 --> 00:00:20.233
has tracked him 
to his underground lab.

00:00:20.233 --> 00:00:23.646
You burst in to find… that it’s a trap!

00:00:23.646 --> 00:00:27.534
Dr. Schrödinger has slipped 
into the next room to activate his device

00:00:27.534 --> 00:00:30.760
and disabled the control
panel on the way out.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.611
Fortunately, your teammates are 
masters of spy-craft.

00:00:34.611 --> 00:00:37.591
Agent Delta has hacked 
into the control panel

00:00:37.591 --> 00:00:41.156
and managed to reactivate 
some of its functionality.

00:00:41.156 --> 00:00:44.693
Meanwhile, Agent Epsilon has
searched through surveillance

00:00:44.693 --> 00:00:46.802
to find the code for the door:

00:00:46.802 --> 00:00:47.533
2,

00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:48.300
10,

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.846
14.

00:00:49.846 --> 00:00:53.650
All you have to do is enter those numbers 
and you’ll be free.

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:54.962
But there’s a problem.

00:00:54.962 --> 00:00:57.575
The control panel has only three buttons:

00:00:57.575 --> 00:01:00.155
one which adds 5 to the display number,

00:01:00.155 --> 00:01:01.681
one which adds 7,

00:01:01.681 --> 00:01:04.243
and one which takes the square root.

00:01:04.243 --> 00:01:07.113
You need to make the display output
the numbers

00:01:07.113 --> 00:01:10.497
2, 10, and 14, 
in that order.

00:01:10.497 --> 00:01:13.509
It’s okay if it outputs different 
numbers in between,

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:16.294
but there’s no way to reset the display,

00:01:16.294 --> 00:01:17.897
so once you get to 2,

00:01:17.897 --> 00:01:22.416
you’ll have to continue 
on to 10 and 14 from there.

00:01:22.416 --> 00:01:24.970
Not only that, Agent Delta explains

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.773
that there are other traps 
built into the panel.

00:01:27.773 --> 00:01:30.858
If it ever shows the same number 
more than once,

00:01:30.858 --> 00:01:32.677
a number greater than 60,

00:01:32.677 --> 00:01:34.801
or a non-whole number,

00:01:34.801 --> 00:01:37.163
the room will explode.

00:01:37.163 --> 00:01:42.149
Right now, the display reads zero, 
and time is running out.

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:45.617
There’s only one way to solve the puzzle,
with a few small variations.

00:01:45.617 --> 00:01:49.973
How will you input the code to escape 
from Dr. Schrödinger’s lair

00:01:49.973 --> 00:01:51.782
and save the day?

00:01:51.782 --> 00:01:58.249
Pause the video now if you want
to figure it out for yourself!

00:01:58.249 --> 00:02:00.187
Answer in: 3

00:02:00.187 --> 00:02:00.973
2

00:02:00.973 --> 00:02:02.077
1.

00:02:02.077 --> 00:02:03.813
You look over your options.

00:02:03.813 --> 00:02:07.124
Adding 5 or 7 increases the number,

00:02:07.124 --> 00:02:09.673
and the square root button 
will make it smaller.

00:02:09.673 --> 00:02:13.032
But there are only a few options 
where you can use that button:

00:02:13.032 --> 00:02:13.748
4

00:02:13.748 --> 00:02:14.530
9

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:15.246
16

00:02:15.246 --> 00:02:16.059
25,

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.942
36,

00:02:16.942 --> 00:02:18.547
and 49.

00:02:18.547 --> 00:02:20.521
You’d love to make 4 or 16.

00:02:20.521 --> 00:02:24.383
Then you could hit the square root button 
once or twice to get 2.

00:02:24.383 --> 00:02:27.972
But you can’t make either with 
just the 5 and 7 buttons.

00:02:27.972 --> 00:02:29.456
What will you do?

00:02:29.456 --> 00:02:33.940
You look at the other possible options for
numbers you could take the square root of.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.566
Nine you can’t reach.

00:02:35.566 --> 00:02:39.003
Twenty-five and 49 would take you back to 
5 or 7,

00:02:39.003 --> 00:02:41.333
and you can already get to each
of those.

00:02:41.333 --> 00:02:44.646
Thirty-six is your only option.

00:02:44.646 --> 00:02:45.733
You add 5,

00:02:45.733 --> 00:02:46.450
7,

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:47.161
5,

00:02:47.161 --> 00:02:47.916
7,

00:02:47.916 --> 00:02:48.634
5,

00:02:48.634 --> 00:02:49.672
7,

00:02:49.672 --> 00:02:51.624
and then hit the square root button.

00:02:51.624 --> 00:02:53.714
Why that series of 5s and 7s?

00:02:53.714 --> 00:02:55.302
It’s somewhat arbitrary,

00:02:55.302 --> 00:02:59.976
but you know that you want 
to avoid 10, 14, and perfect squares,

00:02:59.976 --> 00:03:01.798
since you’ll need them later.

00:03:01.798 --> 00:03:03.319
This gets you to 6.

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:04.580
Does that help?

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.957
Looking at your options,
you see that 16 is now in your sights.

00:03:08.957 --> 00:03:11.475
You add 5 twice more to reach it.

00:03:11.475 --> 00:03:14.212
Then hit square root twice.

00:03:14.212 --> 00:03:15.571
That gets you to 2.

00:03:15.571 --> 00:03:17.055
You’re on your way!

00:03:17.055 --> 00:03:18.436
Now to 10.

00:03:18.436 --> 00:03:21.059
You can’t get straight 
there through addition alone,

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:23.867
so you’re going to have 
to reach another square.

00:03:23.867 --> 00:03:28.393
Taking the square root of 9 or 25 would 
get you to a good place,

00:03:28.393 --> 00:03:32.750
but it turns out that 25 
is unreachable from 2.

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.074
So you add 7 to get to 9,

00:03:35.074 --> 00:03:36.974
then take the square root again.

00:03:36.974 --> 00:03:38.620
That gets you to 3.

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.293
Adding 7 again makes 10.

00:03:41.293 --> 00:03:43.995
Finally, you need to reach 14.

00:03:43.995 --> 00:03:48.337
Thinking backwards, you imagine where 
you could be before 14:

00:03:48.337 --> 00:03:50.249
7 or 9.

00:03:50.249 --> 00:03:53.684
But 9 won’t work because 
you’ve already used 9.

00:03:53.684 --> 00:03:58.213
However, you could get to 7 
by reaching 49 first.

00:03:58.213 --> 00:04:00.032
You add your way towards it,

00:04:00.032 --> 00:04:03.431
being careful not to hit any 
of the numbers you’ve hit so far.

00:04:03.431 --> 00:04:05.105
You thread your way carefully,

00:04:05.105 --> 00:04:08.063
adding five 5s and two 7s.

00:04:08.063 --> 00:04:12.259
Then, square root to 7, and add 7 more.

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:15.277
The door opens, 
and you’re out of the trap.

00:04:15.277 --> 00:04:17.458
Thanks to your problem-solving skills,

00:04:17.458 --> 00:04:21.673
your team gets Schrödinger’s cats out 
of the box in the nick of time.

00:04:21.673 --> 00:04:24.795
As for Schrödinger, 
you can be certain of one thing:

00:04:24.795 --> 00:04:28.333
he’ll be spending quite some
time in a box of his own.
