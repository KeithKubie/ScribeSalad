so when we last left off we had

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950
so when we last left off we had
 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.490
so when we last left off we had
successfully learned how to unlock

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500
successfully learned how to unlock
 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.470
successfully learned how to unlock
achievements and increment achievements

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480
achievements and increment achievements
 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.259
achievements and increment achievements
by a certain amount and this is great

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269
by a certain amount and this is great
 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.420
by a certain amount and this is great
this is progress but you may have

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430
this is progress but you may have
 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.670
this is progress but you may have
noticed that I did this by embedding

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680
noticed that I did this by embedding
 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.519
noticed that I did this by embedding
these achievements ID strings directly

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529
these achievements ID strings directly
 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.920
these achievements ID strings directly
into the code and for a lot of you this

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930
into the code and for a lot of you this
 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.330
into the code and for a lot of you this
probably made you wince and you're like

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340
probably made you wince and you're like
 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.310
probably made you wince and you're like
what are you doing you're like embedding

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320
what are you doing you're like embedding
 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.290
what are you doing you're like embedding
strings directly into the code this is

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300
strings directly into the code this is
 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.759
strings directly into the code this is
terrible style and you should be ashamed

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769
terrible style and you should be ashamed
 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.069
terrible style and you should be ashamed
of yourself and I am so I'm just going

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079
of yourself and I am so I'm just going
 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.569
of yourself and I am so I'm just going
to take a few moments to fix this before

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579
to take a few moments to fix this before
 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.200
to take a few moments to fix this before
we go ahead and implement the remaining

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210
we go ahead and implement the remaining
 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.660
we go ahead and implement the remaining
two achievements now probably as a game

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670
two achievements now probably as a game
 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.680
two achievements now probably as a game
developer you're going to do something

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690
developer you're going to do something
 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.420
developer you're going to do something
even more sophisticated than what i'm

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430
even more sophisticated than what i'm
 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.069
even more sophisticated than what i'm
doing you're probably going to you know

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079
doing you're probably going to you know
 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.900
doing you're probably going to you know
save all these IDs and a properties file

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910
save all these IDs and a properties file
 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.420
save all these IDs and a properties file
somewhere you can easily read in in my

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430
somewhere you can easily read in in my
 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.790
somewhere you can easily read in in my
case I'm just going to do this by

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800
case I'm just going to do this by
 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.170
case I'm just going to do this by
creating an enum so let me go over to my

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180
creating an enum so let me go over to my
 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.310
creating an enum so let me go over to my
GM and achievement manager here and

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320
GM and achievement manager here and
 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.340
GM and achievement manager here and
let's create a little enum so I'm going

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350
let's create a little enum so I'm going
 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.960
let's create a little enum so I'm going
to use our typedef NS enum macro that

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970
to use our typedef NS enum macro that
 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.210
to use our typedef NS enum macro that
Apple has provided for us it'll be an NS

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220
Apple has provided for us it'll be an NS
 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.880
Apple has provided for us it'll be an NS
integer and its name will call it a GM n

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890
integer and its name will call it a GM n
 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.109
integer and its name will call it a GM n
achievement ID and this will be defined

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119
achievement ID and this will be defined
 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.700
achievement ID and this will be defined
as i guess i will enter these

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710
as i guess i will enter these
 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.920
as i guess i will enter these
achievements in the same way that they

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930
achievements in the same way that they
 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.499
achievements in the same way that they
are entered in the play console so we're

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509
are entered in the play console so we're
 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.280
are entered in the play console so we're
going to say achievement ID lucky guests

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290
going to say achievement ID lucky guests
 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.270
going to say achievement ID lucky guests
and we'll make sure this is zero then we

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280
and we'll make sure this is zero then we
 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.240
and we'll make sure this is zero then we
can add achievement ID sent to guesser

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250
 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.649
achievement ID first time and

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659
achievement ID first time and
 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:56.359
achievement ID first time and
achievement ID at nay otay there we go

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369
achievement ID at nay otay there we go
 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.190
achievement ID at nay otay there we go
and now we can go ahead and change these

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200
and now we can go ahead and change these
 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.200
and now we can go ahead and change these
method signatures so that instead of

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210
method signatures so that instead of
 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.060
method signatures so that instead of
passing in an end a string we're

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070
passing in an end a string we're
 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.859
passing in an end a string we're
actually going to pass in our gmn

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869
actually going to pass in our gmn
 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.320
actually going to pass in our gmn
achievement ID enum so i'm going to

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330
achievement ID enum so i'm going to
 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.260
achievement ID enum so i'm going to
change this here from in a string to GM

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270
change this here from in a string to GM
 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.080
change this here from in a string to GM
achievement ID and I'm gonna do the same

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090
achievement ID and I'm gonna do the same
 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:22.790
achievement ID and I'm gonna do the same
thing here and then in our dot m file we

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800
thing here and then in our dot m file we
 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:23.690
thing here and then in our dot m file we
can go through the work to actually

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700
can go through the work to actually
 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.170
can go through the work to actually
translate these into real strings so

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180
translate these into real strings so
 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.330
translate these into real strings so
again you might be doing this by looking

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340
again you might be doing this by looking
 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.370
again you might be doing this by looking
at some kind of file in the device but

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380
at some kind of file in the device but
 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:32.780
at some kind of file in the device but
for me I'm just going to go ahead and

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790
for me I'm just going to go ahead and
 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.940
for me I'm just going to go ahead and
create a simple array here so we're

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950
create a simple array here so we're
 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.990
create a simple array here so we're
going to declare static and a string

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000
going to declare static and a string
 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:48.380
going to declare static and a string
Const achievement IDs and I guess I can

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390
Const achievement IDs and I guess I can
 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.420
Const achievement IDs and I guess I can
go ahead and copy and paste these and

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430
go ahead and copy and paste these and
 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:03:00.700
go ahead and copy and paste these and
directly from our developer console

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:00.710
 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:03.350
let's look it up here here we go guess

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360
let's look it up here here we go guess
 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:10.220
let's look it up here here we go guess
my number and achievements all right

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230
my number and achievements all right
 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.290
my number and achievements all right
cool we just copy over this first one

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300
cool we just copy over this first one
 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:19.220
cool we just copy over this first one
and yes this is kind of a pain but we

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230
and yes this is kind of a pain but we
 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:34.440
and yes this is kind of a pain but we
only have to do this once

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450
 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.229
and there we go we now have an array of

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239
and there we go we now have an array of
 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:40.080
and there we go we now have an array of
achievement ID strings where each one of

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090
achievement ID strings where each one of
 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.509
achievement ID strings where each one of
these strings is placed in this array in

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519
these strings is placed in this array in
 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:44.880
these strings is placed in this array in
a way that corresponds to their enum

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890
a way that corresponds to their enum
 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.550
a way that corresponds to their enum
value so looking up an actual

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560
value so looking up an actual
 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.199
value so looking up an actual
achievement ID string from the enum

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209
achievement ID string from the enum
 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:51.960
achievement ID string from the enum
should be pretty easy so now we can

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970
should be pretty easy so now we can
 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:53.759
should be pretty easy so now we can
finally update our methods so I'm going

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769
finally update our methods so I'm going
 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:57.150
finally update our methods so I'm going
to change this from NS string to gmn

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160
to change this from NS string to gmn
 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:02.009
to change this from NS string to gmn
achievement ID and then we will say our

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019
achievement ID and then we will say our
 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:06.300
achievement ID and then we will say our
NS string achievement achievement there

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310
NS string achievement achievement there
 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.890
NS string achievement achievement there
we go ID as string equals achievement

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900
we go ID as string equals achievement
 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:19.289
we go ID as string equals achievement
IDs achievement ID ok that's a that's a

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299
IDs achievement ID ok that's a that's a
 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:20.969
IDs achievement ID ok that's a that's a
lot of achievement IDs sorry for not

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:20.979
lot of achievement IDs sorry for not
 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:22.950
lot of achievement IDs sorry for not
naming these better but now that we have

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960
naming these better but now that we have
 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.830
naming these better but now that we have
this thing I can now just copy and paste

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840
this thing I can now just copy and paste
 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.360
this thing I can now just copy and paste
it in here and we're done and you know

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370
it in here and we're done and you know
 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.940
it in here and we're done and you know
what let me just do the same thing down

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950
what let me just do the same thing down
 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:39.029
what let me just do the same thing down
here in our in our increment method pop

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:39.039
here in our in our increment method pop
 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:43.760
here in our in our increment method pop
that in this is now a gmn achievement ID

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770
that in this is now a gmn achievement ID
 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:49.890
that in this is now a gmn achievement ID
and you put that in here whoops actually

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900
and you put that in here whoops actually
 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.110
and you put that in here whoops actually
before I go on I realize I need to go

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120
before I go on I realize I need to go
 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.560
before I go on I realize I need to go
into my game model and yep yeah we got

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:55.570
into my game model and yep yeah we got
 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:58.320
into my game model and yep yeah we got
some errors now let's go ahead and

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330
some errors now let's go ahead and
 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.310
some errors now let's go ahead and
replace this call with our achievement

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320
replace this call with our achievement
 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:09.450
replace this call with our achievement
ID first time and then we can similarly

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:09.460
ID first time and then we can similarly
 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.260
ID first time and then we can similarly
replace this one with achievement ID

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.270
replace this one with achievement ID
 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:17.129
replace this one with achievement ID
sent to guesser and by the way gosh

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:17.139
sent to guesser and by the way gosh
 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:19.680
sent to guesser and by the way gosh
isn't it nice now that we that we have

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:19.690
isn't it nice now that we that we have
 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:21.659
isn't it nice now that we that we have
this auto completion for us that lets us

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:21.669
this auto completion for us that lets us
 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:24.510
this auto completion for us that lets us

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:47.870
let's run this thing
 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:49.360
let's run this thing
see that we're still getting errors and

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:49.370
see that we're still getting errors and
 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:51.430
see that we're still getting errors and
yeah this is actually because in between

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:51.440
yeah this is actually because in between

let's go back here go into our
 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:15.060
let's go back here go into our
frameworks and let's add address book

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:15.070
 

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:20.040
build this all right everything's good

everything seems to be working let's go
ahead and implement these last two so

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:35.240
ahead and implement these last two so
 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.660
ahead and implement these last two so
I'm going to stop this where I go back

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:37.670
I'm going to stop this where I go back
 

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:41.650
I'm going to stop this where I go back
to my game model and I think these last

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:41.660
to my game model and I think these last
 

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:42.910
to my game model and I think these last
two is actually pretty straightforward

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:42.920
two is actually pretty straightforward
 

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:46.990
two is actually pretty straightforward

what i can do is i can look at the
 

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.340
what i can do is i can look at the
guests and say you know if the guess is

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:53.350
guests and say you know if the guess is
 

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:57.670
guests and say you know if the guess is
either less than the player min what we

00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:57.680
either less than the player min what we
 

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.590
either less than the player min what we
know is the minimum logical value for

00:06:59.590 --> 00:06:59.600
know is the minimum logical value for
 

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:03.310
know is the minimum logical value for
the player or our guess is greater than

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:03.320
the player or our guess is greater than
 

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:07.120
the player or our guess is greater than
our player max then that was not really

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:07.130
our player max then that was not really
 

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:09.700
our player max then that was not really
very good guess and we can do self that

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:09.710
very good guess and we can do self that

here and I'm going to say I'm guess 50

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:11.520
here and I'm going to say I'm guess 50
 

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:14.640
here and I'm going to say I'm guess 50
and it's saying it's lower than 50 hmm

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:14.650
and it's saying it's lower than 50 hmm
 

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:18.180
and it's saying it's lower than 50 hmm
well what if I were to guess 60 well

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:18.190
well what if I were to guess 60 well
 

00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:21.270
well what if I were to guess 60 well
that's not a very good guess there but i

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:21.280
that's not a very good guess there but i
 

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:22.830
that's not a very good guess there but i
have seen now that the achievement

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:22.840
have seen now that the achievement
 

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:26.340
have seen now that the achievement
unlocked banner appears and if i were to

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:26.350
unlocked banner appears and if i were to
 

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:29.100
unlocked banner appears and if i were to
go back and look at my achievements it

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:29.110
go back and look at my achievements it
 

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:31.530
go back and look at my achievements it
now shows up there in my list of

00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:31.540
now shows up there in my list of
 

00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:34.260
now shows up there in my list of
achievements that I've earned so that's

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:34.270
achievements that I've earned so that's
 

00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:36.390
achievements that I've earned so that's
pretty good one issue you might be

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:36.400
pretty good one issue you might be
 

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:38.279
pretty good one issue you might be
noticing though is that it's hard to

00:08:38.279 --> 00:08:38.289
noticing though is that it's hard to
 

00:08:38.289 --> 00:08:41.250
noticing though is that it's hard to
test these more than once right like at

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:41.260
test these more than once right like at
 

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.620
test these more than once right like at
some point you're probably going to have

00:08:43.620 --> 00:08:43.630
some point you're probably going to have
 

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:46.860
some point you're probably going to have
a test plan and one of those things that

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:46.870
a test plan and one of those things that
 

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:48.600
a test plan and one of those things that
your testers should be doing if they're

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:48.610
your testers should be doing if they're
 

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:50.700
your testers should be doing if they're
not they should be doing this is make

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:50.710
not they should be doing this is make
 

00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:51.780
not they should be doing this is make
sure that you can earn all these

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:51.790
sure that you can earn all these
 

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:53.880
sure that you can earn all these
achievements and you know you don't want

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:53.890
achievements and you know you don't want
 

00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:55.860
achievements and you know you don't want
to be creating new test accounts every

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:55.870
to be creating new test accounts every
 

00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:57.210
to be creating new test accounts every
time you want to test a new set of

00:08:57.210 --> 00:08:57.220
time you want to test a new set of
 

00:08:57.220 --> 00:08:59.820
time you want to test a new set of
achievements so I think it's important

00:08:59.820 --> 00:08:59.830
achievements so I think it's important
 

00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:01.620
achievements so I think it's important
to at least for testing purposes to

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:01.630
to at least for testing purposes to
 

00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:02.760
to at least for testing purposes to
figure out how to reset your

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:02.770
figure out how to reset your
 

00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:04.680
figure out how to reset your
achievements and we can look at doing

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:04.690
achievements and we can look at doing
 

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:10.960
achievements and we can look at doing
that in the next lesson

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:10.970
 

00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:14.840
haha

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:14.850
 

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:17.060
ha
