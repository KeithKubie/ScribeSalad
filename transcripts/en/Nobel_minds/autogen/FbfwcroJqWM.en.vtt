if you now have your exciting blue light

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:12.310
if you now have your exciting blue light
 

00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:18.310
if you now have your exciting blue light
you can surround it with red light so

00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:18.320
you can surround it with red light so
 

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:21.550
you can surround it with red light so
and in this way quench the yellow

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:21.560
and in this way quench the yellow
 

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:25.510
and in this way quench the yellow
fluorescence from the focus so here you

00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:25.520
fluorescence from the focus so here you
 

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:28.329
fluorescence from the focus so here you
see fluorescence and here you see the

00:10:28.329 --> 00:10:28.339
see fluorescence and here you see the
 

00:10:28.339 --> 00:10:32.439
see fluorescence and here you see the
quenching red light and if you now

00:10:32.439 --> 00:10:32.449
quenching red light and if you now
 

00:10:32.449 --> 00:10:35.699
quenching red light and if you now
increase the intensity of the red light

00:10:35.699 --> 00:10:35.709
increase the intensity of the red light
 

00:10:35.709 --> 00:10:38.079

00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:01.860
and then when you have this short focus
 

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:07.460
and then when you have this short focus
what you do you let your laser beam scan

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:07.470
what you do you let your laser beam scan
 

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:10.040
what you do you let your laser beam scan

instance and you can scan it in x and y

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:13.170
instance and you can scan it in x and y
 

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:16.430
instance and you can scan it in x and y
and z directions in the side layer and

00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:16.440
and z directions in the side layer and
 

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:19.010
and z directions in the side layer and
also in the depth and then you can make

00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:19.020
also in the depth and then you can make
 

00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:22.580
also in the depth and then you can make
a very very short picture of an

00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:22.590
a very very short picture of an
 

00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:26.770
a very very short picture of an
organelle which is now a mitochondrion

00:11:26.770 --> 00:11:26.780
organelle which is now a mitochondrion

that you could look at single molecules

00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:00.380
that you could look at single molecules
 

00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:04.360
that you could look at single molecules
Eric Betsy he got an idea

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:04.370
Eric Betsy he got an idea
 

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:07.250
Eric Betsy he got an idea
suppose that you have a sample here an

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:07.260
suppose that you have a sample here an
 

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:11.630
suppose that you have a sample here an
organelle and now you shine light on it

00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:11.640
organelle and now you shine light on it
 

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:14.270
organelle and now you shine light on it
and you get fluorescence from it then

00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:14.280
and you get fluorescence from it then
 

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:17.840
and you get fluorescence from it then
the different fluorescing molecules here

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:17.850
the different fluorescing molecules here
 

00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:21.550
the different fluorescing molecules here
they will appear like big blobs

00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:21.560
they will appear like big blobs
 

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:24.230
they will appear like big blobs
according to this abbis diffraction

00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:24.240
according to this abbis diffraction
 

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:28.790
according to this abbis diffraction
limit but if you know that the molecules

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:28.800
limit but if you know that the molecules
 

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:32.060
limit but if you know that the molecules
are so separate from each other that on

00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:32.070
are so separate from each other that on
 

00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:35.300
are so separate from each other that on
your detector you only see light from

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:35.310
your detector you only see light from
 

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:38.410
your detector you only see light from
single separated molecules you can

00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:38.420
single separated molecules you can
 

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:41.930
single separated molecules you can
determine their position with very high

00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:41.940
determine their position with very high
 

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:45.950
determine their position with very high
precision but then the problem is if you

00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:45.960
precision but then the problem is if you
 

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:48.140
precision but then the problem is if you
want to label an organelle and get a

00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:48.150
want to label an organelle and get a
 

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:50.750
want to label an organelle and get a
high-resolution structure you need to

00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:50.760
high-resolution structure you need to
 

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:53.600
high-resolution structure you need to
have very very dense labeling otherwise

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:53.610
have very very dense labeling otherwise
 

00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:56.090
have very very dense labeling otherwise
there are big holes which you didn't

00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:56.100
there are big holes which you didn't
 

00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:58.670
there are big holes which you didn't
label and you didn't see yeah because

00:12:58.670 --> 00:12:58.680
label and you didn't see yeah because
 

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:00.410
label and you didn't see yeah because
you see through the power of

00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:00.420
you see through the power of
 

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:02.870
you see through the power of
fluorescence so it's idea of

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:02.880
fluorescence so it's idea of
 

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:06.910
fluorescence so it's idea of
let's label them with green labels

00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:06.920
let's label them with green labels
 

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:10.910
let's label them with green labels
yellow labels and red labels and then

00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:10.920
yellow labels and red labels and then
 

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:13.100
yellow labels and red labels and then
that the microscope only see the green

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:13.110
that the microscope only see the green
 

00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:15.499
that the microscope only see the green
labels they are separate from each other

00:13:15.499 --> 00:13:15.509
labels they are separate from each other
 

00:13:15.509 --> 00:13:19.670
labels they are separate from each other
so then you can determine their

00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:19.680
so then you can determine their
 

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:22.100
so then you can determine their
positions with high precision the yellow

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:22.110
positions with high precision the yellow
 

00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:24.110
positions with high precision the yellow
ones are also separate from each other

00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:24.120
ones are also separate from each other
 

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:26.900
ones are also separate from each other
you can determine their position and the

00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:26.910
you can determine their position and the
 

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:29.210
you can determine their position and the
red ones the same and if you put all

00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:29.220
red ones the same and if you put all
 

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:32.329
red ones the same and if you put all
these pictures together you can get a

00:13:32.329 --> 00:13:32.339
these pictures together you can get a
 

00:13:32.339 --> 00:13:38.620
these pictures together you can get a
reasonable reasonably well labeled

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:38.630
 
 

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:42.199
 
organelle however what you really want

00:13:42.199 --> 00:13:42.209
organelle however what you really want
 

00:13:42.209 --> 00:13:46.009
organelle however what you really want
to have is this and for this you may

00:13:46.009 --> 00:13:46.019
to have is this and for this you may
 

00:13:46.019 --> 00:13:48.949
to have is this and for this you may
need like thousands of colors that can

00:13:48.949 --> 00:13:48.959
need like thousands of colors that can
 

00:13:48.959 --> 00:13:52.610
need like thousands of colors that can
be separated by the microscope and so

00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:52.620
be separated by the microscope and so
 

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:54.980
be separated by the microscope and so
this didn't work practically although it

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:54.990
this didn't work practically although it
 

00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:59.650
this didn't work practically although it
was a brilliant idea so then one day

00:13:59.650 --> 00:13:59.660
was a brilliant idea so then one day
 

00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:04.210
was a brilliant idea so then one day
William Berner discovered a

00:14:04.210 --> 00:14:04.220
William Berner discovered a
 

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:07.550
William Berner discovered a
photoactivatable protein a green

00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:07.560
photoactivatable protein a green
 

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:11.329
photoactivatable protein a green
fluorescent protein and we see it here

00:14:11.329 --> 00:14:11.339
fluorescent protein and we see it here
 

00:14:11.339 --> 00:14:16.400
fluorescent protein and we see it here
it looks like a can of beer and if you

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:16.410
it looks like a can of beer and if you
 

00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:20.210
it looks like a can of beer and if you
shine light 488 nanometers on it it

00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:20.220
shine light 488 nanometers on it it
 

00:14:20.220 --> 00:14:23.650
shine light 488 nanometers on it it
blinks 10 times as you noted maybe and

00:14:23.650 --> 00:14:23.660
blinks 10 times as you noted maybe and
 

00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:29.569
blinks 10 times as you noted maybe and
then it it's turned off so nothing

00:14:29.569 --> 00:14:29.579
then it it's turned off so nothing
 

00:14:29.579 --> 00:14:34.009
then it it's turned off so nothing
happens however much light you should

00:14:34.009 --> 00:14:34.019
happens however much light you should
 

00:14:34.019 --> 00:14:36.800
happens however much light you should
shine on it nothing happens but then if

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:36.810
shine on it nothing happens but then if
 

00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:39.769
shine on it nothing happens but then if
you shine another type of light with 405

00:14:39.769 --> 00:14:39.779
you shine another type of light with 405
 

00:14:39.779 --> 00:14:45.379
you shine another type of light with 405
nanometer wavelength and then we start

00:14:45.379 --> 00:14:45.389
nanometer wavelength and then we start
 

00:14:45.389 --> 00:14:48.559
nanometer wavelength and then we start
to sign the 488 nanometers it blinks

00:14:48.559 --> 00:14:48.569
to sign the 488 nanometers it blinks
 

00:14:48.569 --> 00:14:53.139
to sign the 488 nanometers it blinks
again so it has been activated it was

00:14:53.139 --> 00:14:53.149
again so it has been activated it was
 

00:14:53.149 --> 00:14:57.280
again so it has been activated it was
turned off and it could be activated and

00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:57.290
turned off and it could be activated and
 

00:14:57.290 --> 00:15:01.490
turned off and it could be activated and
from this this type of proteins they

00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:01.500
from this this type of proteins they
 

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:05.199
from this this type of proteins they
started to be become developed and then

00:15:05.199 --> 00:15:05.209
started to be become developed and then
 

00:15:05.209 --> 00:15:08.329
started to be become developed and then
Eric bet sig got a solution to his

00:15:08.329 --> 00:15:08.339
Eric bet sig got a solution to his
 

00:15:08.339 --> 00:15:13.670
Eric bet sig got a solution to his
problem and so if you now have a green

00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:13.680
problem and so if you now have a green
 

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:15.740
problem and so if you now have a green
fluorescent protein here all

00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:15.750
fluorescent protein here all
 

00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:19.220
fluorescent protein here all
them or quenched turned off and then you

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:19.230
them or quenched turned off and then you
 

00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:23.420
them or quenched turned off and then you
send in a pulse and you activate say one

00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:23.430
send in a pulse and you activate say one
 

00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:27.800
send in a pulse and you activate say one
per mill of them and then all these are

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:27.810
per mill of them and then all these are
 

00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:30.320
per mill of them and then all these are
now separate from each other so that you

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:30.330
now separate from each other so that you
 

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:33.230
now separate from each other so that you
can determine their positions very very

00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:33.240
can determine their positions very very
 

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:37.670
can determine their positions very very
well and then you run them until they

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:37.680
well and then you run them until they
 

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:40.160
well and then you run them until they
are bleached out and disappear

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:40.170
are bleached out and disappear
 

00:15:40.170 --> 00:15:42.410
are bleached out and disappear
irreversibly and then you activate

00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:42.420
irreversibly and then you activate
 

00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:45.080
irreversibly and then you activate
another fraction and you determine its

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:45.090
another fraction and you determine its
 

00:15:45.090 --> 00:15:48.770
another fraction and you determine its
positions and then another fraction and

00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:48.780
positions and then another fraction and
 

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:51.350
positions and then another fraction and
another fraction and another fraction

00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:51.360
another fraction and another fraction
 

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:53.660
another fraction and another fraction
all these small fractions and you run

00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:53.670
all these small fractions and you run
 

00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:57.380
all these small fractions and you run
them out and then in the end you have a

00:15:57.380 --> 00:15:57.390
them out and then in the end you have a
 

00:15:57.390 --> 00:16:02.630
them out and then in the end you have a
whole stack of pictures and you put them

00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:02.640
whole stack of pictures and you put them
 

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:05.200
whole stack of pictures and you put them
together and you get a beautiful

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:05.210
together and you get a beautiful
 

00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:08.180
together and you get a beautiful
mitochondrion with fantastic resolution

00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:08.190
mitochondrion with fantastic resolution
 

00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:13.340
mitochondrion with fantastic resolution
and that was the the intimate work

00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:13.350
and that was the the intimate work
 

00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:17.450
and that was the the intimate work
between Eric Beth sig and William burner

00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:17.460
between Eric Beth sig and William burner
 

00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:19.700
between Eric Beth sig and William burner
they didn't work together but they could

00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:19.710
they didn't work together but they could
 

00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:26.140
they didn't work together but they could
do these things in a way together and so

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:26.150
do these things in a way together and so
 

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:30.190
do these things in a way together and so
here is a result from bed six first

00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:30.200
here is a result from bed six first
 

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:33.530
here is a result from bed six first
application of his method called pal so

00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:33.540
application of his method called pal so
 

00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:36.200
application of his method called pal so
here is say what's in an organelle

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:36.210
here is say what's in an organelle
 

00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:37.130
here is say what's in an organelle
called lysosome

00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:37.140
called lysosome
 

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:40.600
called lysosome
and here is what you see when you have

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:40.610
and here is what you see when you have
 

00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:44.450
and here is what you see when you have
diffraction limited resolution and this

00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:44.460
diffraction limited resolution and this
 

00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:47.630
diffraction limited resolution and this
is what bed six method gave you see and

00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:47.640
is what bed six method gave you see and
 

00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:50.840
is what bed six method gave you see and
then this one is expanded and here is

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:50.850
then this one is expanded and here is
 

00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:53.329
then this one is expanded and here is
the Arbus diffraction limit and you will

00:16:53.329 --> 00:16:53.339
the Arbus diffraction limit and you will
 

00:16:53.339 --> 00:16:55.520
the Arbus diffraction limit and you will
see you can see the single proteins here

00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:55.530
see you can see the single proteins here
 

00:16:55.530 --> 00:17:00.680
see you can see the single proteins here
is a fantastic improvement and so from

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:00.690
is a fantastic improvement and so from
 

00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:08.030
is a fantastic improvement and so from

sciences because the use of focused

00:18:21.550 --> 00:18:21.560
sciences because the use of focused
 

00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:23.500

light is the only way that allows you to

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:23.510
light is the only way that allows you to
 

00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:26.830
light is the only way that allows you to
see living things however the resolution

00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:26.840
see living things however the resolution
 

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:29.380
see living things however the resolution
of light microscopy was fundamentally

00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:29.390
of light microscopy was fundamentally
 

00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:32.680
of light microscopy was fundamentally

see a protein distributions at much

00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:37.130
see a protein distributions at much
 

00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:39.670
see a protein distributions at much
higher resolution at much smaller scale

00:18:39.670 --> 00:18:39.680
higher resolution at much smaller scale
 

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:41.290
higher resolution at much smaller scale
it's simply impossible and definitely

00:18:41.290 --> 00:18:41.300
it's simply impossible and definitely
 

00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:42.580
it's simply impossible and definitely
not in in lifestyle

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:42.590
not in in lifestyle
 

00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:46.360
not in in lifestyle
now what we have found is that you can

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:46.370
now what we have found is that you can
 

00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:48.610
now what we have found is that you can
overcome this limit you can see details

00:18:48.610 --> 00:18:48.620
overcome this limit you can see details
 

00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:50.200
overcome this limit you can see details
at much much higher spatial resolution

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:50.210
at much much higher spatial resolution
 

00:18:50.210 --> 00:18:52.900
at much much higher spatial resolution
and this of course discloses how the

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:52.910
and this of course discloses how the
 

00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:55.480
and this of course discloses how the
cell works at the nanometer scale so

00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:55.490
cell works at the nanometer scale so
 

00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:57.520
cell works at the nanometer scale so
that's at a molecular scale at a macro

00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:57.530
that's at a molecular scale at a macro
 

00:18:57.530 --> 00:18:59.650
that's at a molecular scale at a macro
molecular scale and it's of course very

00:18:59.650 --> 00:18:59.660
molecular scale and it's of course very
 

00:18:59.660 --> 00:19:01.750
molecular scale and it's of course very
very important to a understanding how

00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:01.760
very important to a understanding how
 

00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:04.690
very important to a understanding how
the cell works and be understanding what

00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:04.700
the cell works and be understanding what
 

00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:07.390
the cell works and be understanding what
goes wrong if the cell is somehow

00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:07.400
goes wrong if the cell is somehow
 

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:09.820
goes wrong if the cell is somehow
diseased do something disease that's you

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:09.830
diseased do something disease that's you
 

00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:11.140
diseased do something disease that's you
know something so it's very important

00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:11.150
know something so it's very important
 

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:14.230
know something so it's very important
for understanding the physiology at a

00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:14.240
for understanding the physiology at a
 

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:16.270
for understanding the physiology at a
level and of course understanding

00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:16.280
level and of course understanding
 

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:21.160
level and of course understanding
disease a terrible level if I may

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:21.170
disease a terrible level if I may
 

00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:23.890
disease a terrible level if I may
continue could you say something about

00:19:23.890 --> 00:19:23.900
continue could you say something about
 

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:33.280
continue could you say something about
how you got the idea why I came across

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:33.290
how you got the idea why I came across
 

00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:35.680
how you got the idea why I came across
this this diffraction problem is what

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:35.690
this this diffraction problem is what
 

00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:36.659
this this diffraction problem is what
did I

00:19:36.659 --> 00:19:36.669
did I
 

00:19:36.669 --> 00:19:41.129
did I
during my pieces on like a schematic or

00:19:41.129 --> 00:19:41.139
during my pieces on like a schematic or
 

00:19:41.139 --> 00:19:44.789
during my pieces on like a schematic or
confocal microscopy method but not for

00:19:44.789 --> 00:19:44.799
confocal microscopy method but not for
 

00:19:44.799 --> 00:19:45.960
confocal microscopy method but not for
the life science is not sort of

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:45.970
the life science is not sort of
 

00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:48.210
the life science is not sort of
fluorescence he was basically for

00:19:48.210 --> 00:19:48.220
fluorescence he was basically for
 

00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:50.009
fluorescence he was basically for
microstructure inspection I got bored

00:19:50.009 --> 00:19:50.019
microstructure inspection I got bored
 

00:19:50.019 --> 00:19:51.869
microstructure inspection I got bored
with the topic so I felt this is kind of

00:19:51.869 --> 00:19:51.879
with the topic so I felt this is kind of
 

00:19:51.879 --> 00:19:55.080
with the topic so I felt this is kind of
19th century physics and I was wondering

00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:55.090
19th century physics and I was wondering
 

00:19:55.090 --> 00:19:57.210
19th century physics and I was wondering
whether there's still something profound

00:19:57.210 --> 00:19:57.220
whether there's still something profound
 

00:19:57.220 --> 00:19:59.580
whether there's still something profound
that could be made with light microscopy

00:19:59.580 --> 00:19:59.590
that could be made with light microscopy
 

00:19:59.590 --> 00:20:02.759
that could be made with light microscopy
and so I saw that's diffraction barrier

00:20:02.759 --> 00:20:02.769
and so I saw that's diffraction barrier
 

00:20:02.769 --> 00:20:04.859
and so I saw that's diffraction barrier
that's the only important problem that

00:20:04.859 --> 00:20:04.869
that's the only important problem that
 

00:20:04.869 --> 00:20:07.919
that's the only important problem that
has been left over that people have saw

00:20:07.919 --> 00:20:07.929
has been left over that people have saw
 

00:20:07.929 --> 00:20:10.529
has been left over that people have saw
that it would not be beatable you cannot

00:20:10.529 --> 00:20:10.539
that it would not be beatable you cannot
 

00:20:10.539 --> 00:20:12.029
that it would not be beatable you cannot
do anything about that you have to

00:20:12.029 --> 00:20:12.039
do anything about that you have to
 

00:20:12.039 --> 00:20:13.499
do anything about that you have to
resort it's alright classically if you

00:20:13.499 --> 00:20:13.509
resort it's alright classically if you
 

00:20:13.509 --> 00:20:15.539
resort it's alright classically if you
want to see the nanoscale and so I got

00:20:15.539 --> 00:20:15.549
want to see the nanoscale and so I got
 

00:20:15.549 --> 00:20:17.669
want to see the nanoscale and so I got
attracted to this problem and I started

00:20:17.669 --> 00:20:17.679
attracted to this problem and I started
 

00:20:17.679 --> 00:20:18.930
attracted to this problem and I started
thinking about whether there's really

00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:18.940
thinking about whether there's really
 

00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:20.669
thinking about whether there's really
you know say physics or physical

00:20:20.669 --> 00:20:20.679
you know say physics or physical
 

00:20:20.679 --> 00:20:22.859
you know say physics or physical
chemistry or chemistry to sort out the

00:20:22.859 --> 00:20:22.869
chemistry or chemistry to sort out the
 

00:20:22.869 --> 00:20:25.889
chemistry or chemistry to sort out the
problem and eventually I realized that

00:20:25.889 --> 00:20:25.899
problem and eventually I realized that
 

00:20:25.899 --> 00:20:27.450
problem and eventually I realized that
it must be a way by playing with the

00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:27.460
it must be a way by playing with the
 

00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:29.940
it must be a way by playing with the
molecules trying to turn the molecules

00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:29.950
molecules trying to turn the molecules
 

00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:32.220
molecules trying to turn the molecules
on and off allows you to see adjacent

00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:32.230
on and off allows you to see adjacent
 

00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:35.450
on and off allows you to see adjacent
things that you couldn't see before

00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:35.460
things that you couldn't see before
 

00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:38.310
things that you couldn't see before

right how big was the challenge to put
the molecules on the knot it is of

00:21:01.619 --> 00:21:01.629
the molecules on the knot it is of
 

00:21:01.629 --> 00:21:03.299
the molecules on the knot it is of
course something that you have to

00:21:03.299 --> 00:21:03.309
course something that you have to
 

00:21:03.309 --> 00:21:04.979
course something that you have to
realize first you have to realize that

00:21:04.979 --> 00:21:04.989
realize first you have to realize that
 

00:21:04.989 --> 00:21:06.989
realize first you have to realize that
there are methods of turning molecules

00:21:06.989 --> 00:21:06.999
there are methods of turning molecules
 

00:21:06.999 --> 00:21:10.019
there are methods of turning molecules
on and off now I realized and this was

00:21:10.019 --> 00:21:10.029
on and off now I realized and this was
 

00:21:10.029 --> 00:21:12.090
on and off now I realized and this was
explained by Professor months and back

00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:12.100
explained by Professor months and back
 

00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:13.919
explained by Professor months and back
that you can turn molecules off by a

00:21:13.919 --> 00:21:13.929
that you can turn molecules off by a
 

00:21:13.929 --> 00:21:15.690
that you can turn molecules off by a
phenomenon called stimulated emission

00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:15.700
phenomenon called stimulated emission
 

00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:19.739
phenomenon called stimulated emission
that's a very very basic phenomenon you

00:21:19.739 --> 00:21:19.749
that's a very very basic phenomenon you
 

00:21:19.749 --> 00:21:22.470
that's a very very basic phenomenon you
wouldn't learn about that in the first

00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:22.480
wouldn't learn about that in the first
 

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:25.349
wouldn't learn about that in the first
year and after I realized that you can

00:21:25.349 --> 00:21:25.359
year and after I realized that you can
 

00:21:25.359 --> 00:21:27.629
year and after I realized that you can
turn it on and off with stimulated

00:21:27.629 --> 00:21:27.639
turn it on and off with stimulated
 

00:21:27.639 --> 00:21:29.669
turn it on and off with stimulated
emission I I knew that there are also

00:21:29.669 --> 00:21:29.679
emission I I knew that there are also
 

00:21:29.679 --> 00:21:32.340
emission I I knew that there are also
other mechanisms for too many molecules

00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:32.350
other mechanisms for too many molecules
 

00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:36.749
other mechanisms for too many molecules
on and off that are we've all described

00:21:36.749 --> 00:21:36.759
on and off that are we've all described
 

00:21:36.759 --> 00:21:39.549
on and off that are we've all described
in the literature for example

00:21:39.549 --> 00:21:39.559
in the literature for example
 

00:21:39.559 --> 00:21:41.780
in the literature for example
pumping things so long live dark state

00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:41.790
pumping things so long live dark state
 

00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:43.670
pumping things so long live dark state
sources trans isomerisation and so on

00:21:43.670 --> 00:21:43.680
sources trans isomerisation and so on
 

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:46.100
sources trans isomerisation and so on
and so there are many many ways of

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:46.110
and so there are many many ways of
 

00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:49.190
and so there are many many ways of
playing the same game and this turned

00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:49.200
playing the same game and this turned
 

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:51.620
playing the same game and this turned
out to be of course very very successful

00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:51.630
out to be of course very very successful
 

00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:56.299
out to be of course very very successful

you can play it in this concept in many
 

00:21:58.410 --> 00:22:05.610
you can play it in this concept in many
many ways

yes the question was is there any limit

00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:38.720
yes the question was is there any limit
 

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:41.200
yes the question was is there any limit
that is still valid for the resolution

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:41.210
that is still valid for the resolution
 

00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:44.549
that is still valid for the resolution
you can get and the answer is

00:24:44.549 --> 00:24:44.559
you can get and the answer is
 

00:24:44.559 --> 00:24:47.590
you can get and the answer is
essentially there is no strict physical

00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:47.600
essentially there is no strict physical
 

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:53.560
essentially there is no strict physical
limit limit left however if you want to

00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:53.570
limit limit left however if you want to
 

00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:56.799
limit limit left however if you want to
have a very high resolution image of an

organelle by fluorescence labels
 

00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:03.639
organelle by fluorescence labels
you must have labeled it properly as you

00:25:03.639 --> 00:25:03.649
you must have labeled it properly as you
 

00:25:03.649 --> 00:25:06.549
you must have labeled it properly as you
have labels everywhere essentially and

00:25:06.549 --> 00:25:06.559
have labels everywhere essentially and
 

00:25:06.559 --> 00:25:09.250
have labels everywhere essentially and
so there may be practical limit but it's

00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:09.260
so there may be practical limit but it's
 

00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:12.639
so there may be practical limit but it's
much much lower than the limit that was

00:25:12.639 --> 00:25:12.649
much much lower than the limit that was
 

00:25:12.649 --> 00:25:18.240
much much lower than the limit that was
set by Abdur or understood by AB 1873

00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:18.250

00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:28.029
since 6 1876 it was described yeah and
it was so well believed this limit this
