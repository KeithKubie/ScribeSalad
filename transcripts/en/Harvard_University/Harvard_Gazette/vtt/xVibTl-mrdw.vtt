00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.990
The Event Horizon Telescope is a project
that we've been working on for many many

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.680
years to take the first picture of a
black hole and we've done it.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.900
It seems impossible: how do you take a picture of
something that's shrouded by nature's

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.190
ultimate cloaking device? What happens is
the black hole's gravity is so intense

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.129
that all the gas and dust that's
attracted to it has to get into

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.930
increasingly smaller and smaller volumes
and just as your hands heat up when you

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.559
rub them together through friction, all
that gas heats up to hundreds of

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.909
billions of degrees. Everything around
the black hole is ultra luminous; in fact

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:07.050
central black holes in the centers of
galaxies can outshine all the starlight

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.250
from all the stars in the entire galaxy
and that provides this three-dimensional

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:17.490
flashlight around the geometry that's
warped by the black hole itself, so as

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.320
all that light is lensed around the black
hole onto what we call the last photon

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.690
orbit, it forms a ring; and that ring, the
shape and size of it, fall right out from

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.369
Einstein's field equations. It required
creating an array of telescopes that

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.659
spread over the entire globe, acting
together to synthesize an earth-sized

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.110
telescope and to be able to peer down to
the black hole itself required doing

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.500
this at higher frequencies than ever
been achieved before. It's required

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.890
recording petabytes of data. Those
recordings have to be brought back

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.240
together to a central location where
they're compared. We do all the timing

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.369
afterwards in a supercomputer and all
that technology really has come about in

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.659
the past ten to five years or so. So to
have something here where we're able to

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.869
see in a picture something that's
been predicted now for about a

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.360
hundred years, and immediately connect it
to a theory and immediately

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.020
make constraints that no one's ever been
able to make before and that is just,

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.720
it's incredible.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.980
ultimately when you ask yourself what an
iconic image is it's something that

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.750
reveals to you something that you didn't
know before and it scares you a little

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:41.330
bit an image of a black hole captures
visually a one way exit from our

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.290
universe. We think about monsters they're
under our bed or you know they're in

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.650
caves and when you see something like
this you realize that they're really

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.330
monsters out there. The fact that we've
captured this I think is not just for

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.220
our team but for all of humanity.
