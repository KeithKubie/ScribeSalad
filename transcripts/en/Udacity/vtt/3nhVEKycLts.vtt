00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.780
So the big idea in this lesson was to do
a BFS by recasting it in matrix terms.

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:06.450
You did so

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.890
in order to reuse your basic ideas
from distributing matrix operations.

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:13.870
This is a really neat connection,
and you can take it even further.

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:16.900
Now it might not always work,
or work as well.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.150
So, here's a fun exercise
to do at this point.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.030
Go read about or review other
kinds of graph computations.

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:28.650
Then ask whether you can do the same
sort of mapping from graphs to matrices.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.140
For instance,
is there a matrix based way to do

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.050
a Depth first search as opposed
to a breadth first search?

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.610
What about all pairs shortest paths?

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.050
Triangle counting?

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.400
Computing betweeness centrality?

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.210
Maybe others.
