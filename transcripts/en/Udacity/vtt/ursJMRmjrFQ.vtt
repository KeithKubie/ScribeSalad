00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.562
T-Square is the learning management
system that we use at Georgia Tech,

00:00:06.562 --> 00:00:08.945
not just in the OMSCS program,
but on campus as well.

00:00:08.945 --> 00:00:11.840
You'll access T-Square at
t-square.gatech.edu or

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.440
you can always get to
it through BuzzPort.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.825
Now, different classes use T-Square
differently, but generally speaking,

00:00:17.825 --> 00:00:19.948
T-Square is the hub of the course.

00:00:19.948 --> 00:00:21.730
It's where you'll access syllabi,
assignments,

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.290
assignment submission, grades,
Piazza, Udacity and more.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.852
Now some classes might put some of
these materials on to other sites, but

00:00:27.852 --> 00:00:29.910
generally you'll get to
it through T-Square.

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.119
So we're going to talk about
how to access T-Square and

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.930
some of the tools you'll use through
T-Square in many of your courses.
