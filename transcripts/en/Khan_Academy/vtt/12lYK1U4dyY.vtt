00:00:00.363 --> 00:00:03.794
- [Voiceover] Ethene, C2H4, molar mass

00:00:03.794 --> 00:00:08.440
of 28.1 grams per mole, may be prepared

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.670
by the dehydration of ethanol,

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.554
C2H5OH, molar mass 46.1 grams

00:00:15.554 --> 00:00:18.688
per mole, using a solid catalyst.

00:00:18.688 --> 00:00:20.947
A setup for the lab synthesis is shown

00:00:20.947 --> 00:00:22.595
in the diagram above.

00:00:22.595 --> 00:00:25.289
The equation for the dehydration reaction

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.408
is given below.

00:00:27.408 --> 00:00:30.154
So, we have the ethanol,
and then in the presence

00:00:30.154 --> 00:00:33.609
of a catalyst, we're going
to yield, after our reaction,

00:00:33.609 --> 00:00:37.156
some ethene and some
water, and then we have

00:00:37.156 --> 00:00:39.971
some metrics on the actual reaction.

00:00:39.971 --> 00:00:44.649
A student added a 0.200 gram

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:49.433
sample of ethanol, this is ethanol,

00:00:49.433 --> 00:00:54.433
C2H5OH, to a test tube,
using the setup shown above.

00:00:54.537 --> 00:00:57.809
So this is the glass wool with ethanol,

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.971
so the ethanol is right over here.

00:00:59.971 --> 00:01:02.961
There's a solid catalyst right over there.

00:01:02.961 --> 00:01:05.277
The student heated the test tube gently

00:01:05.277 --> 00:01:09.208
with a Bunsen burner until
all of the ethanol evaporated,

00:01:09.208 --> 00:01:11.655
and gas generation stopped.

00:01:11.655 --> 00:01:14.397
So, here you see the heating,
all of the ethanol here

00:01:14.397 --> 00:01:17.216
evaporates, the gas generation stops.

00:01:17.216 --> 00:01:20.334
When the reaction stopped,
the volume of gas collected

00:01:20.334 --> 00:01:24.241
was 0.0854 liters

00:01:24.241 --> 00:01:27.711
at 0.822 atmospheres

00:01:27.711 --> 00:01:30.031
and 305 Kelvin.

00:01:30.031 --> 00:01:31.747
The vapor pressure of water

00:01:31.747 --> 00:01:36.018
at 305 Kelvin is 35.7 torr.

00:01:36.018 --> 00:01:39.437
So, what you have is, in the
presence of the catalyst,

00:01:39.437 --> 00:01:42.032
you have the ethanol, it's going to react,

00:01:42.032 --> 00:01:45.103
it's a dehydration, it's
a dehydration reaction

00:01:45.103 --> 00:01:46.770
right over here, so
you're going to produce

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.062
ethene and water, and
so, you cool it down,

00:01:50.062 --> 00:01:51.920
and so the ethene gets
captured at the top,

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.680
it's going to be in a gaseous state.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.449
The water, it's going to be water vapor,

00:01:56.449 --> 00:01:59.126
but then, of course, once
you've cooled it down,

00:01:59.126 --> 00:02:01.449
you're going to have
liquid, you're going to have

00:02:01.449 --> 00:02:05.111
liquid water here as well.

00:02:05.111 --> 00:02:08.639
So, let's try to answer their questions.

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:12.868
Calculate the number of moles of ethene,

00:02:12.868 --> 00:02:15.104
one, that are actually
produced in the experiment

00:02:15.104 --> 00:02:18.001
and measured in the gas collection tube,

00:02:18.001 --> 00:02:19.366
and two, that would be produced

00:02:19.366 --> 00:02:22.042
if the dehydration reaction
went to completion.

00:02:22.042 --> 00:02:24.158
Part b, calculate the percent yield

00:02:24.158 --> 00:02:26.754
of ethene in the experiment.

00:02:26.754 --> 00:02:29.123
All right, so let's tackle part one.

00:02:29.123 --> 00:02:31.823
Let's tackle part one first, and so,

00:02:31.823 --> 00:02:33.667
somehow we have to figure out the,

00:02:33.667 --> 00:02:35.687
we have to figure out the actual moles

00:02:35.687 --> 00:02:38.052
produced in the experiment and measured

00:02:38.052 --> 00:02:39.844
in the gas collection tube.

00:02:39.844 --> 00:02:41.231
So, what do they tell us here?

00:02:41.231 --> 00:02:42.967
They said until all of
the ethanol evaporated

00:02:42.967 --> 00:02:44.412
and gas generation stopped.

00:02:44.412 --> 00:02:47.461
When the reaction stopped,
the volume of gas,

00:02:47.461 --> 00:02:52.425
so this volume of gas, so
this is our volume of gas

00:02:52.425 --> 00:02:54.880
right over here, that's
where our ethene is,

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.113
our volume of gas was

00:02:58.113 --> 00:03:01.853
0.0854 liters,

00:03:01.853 --> 00:03:04.245
so we underline that,

00:03:05.165 --> 00:03:08.865
at 0.822 atmospheres,

00:03:08.865 --> 00:03:10.925
so that's the total pressure there.

00:03:10.925 --> 00:03:13.549
The temperature is 305 Kelvin,

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:15.105
and then they give us the vapor pressure

00:03:15.105 --> 00:03:19.482
of water is 35.7, at 305 Kelvin,

00:03:19.482 --> 00:03:21.629
is 35.7 torr.

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:22.687
The vapor pressure of water,

00:03:22.687 --> 00:03:24.319
you could view that as a partial pressure

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:27.640
of water, and the reason
why that's useful is

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.998
the partial pressure of water plus

00:03:29.998 --> 00:03:31.989
the partial pressure of the ethene

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:35.606
is going to add up to
the total pressure here.

00:03:35.606 --> 00:03:37.378
And so, we can use that information

00:03:37.378 --> 00:03:40.368
to figure out the partial
pressure of the ethene.

00:03:40.368 --> 00:03:43.497
So, the partial pressure of the ethene.

00:03:43.497 --> 00:03:47.091
And if we know the partial
pressure of the ethene,

00:03:47.091 --> 00:03:48.826
well, then we can use the Ideal Gas Law

00:03:48.826 --> 00:03:51.003
to figure out how many moles of ethene,

00:03:51.003 --> 00:03:55.041
how many moles of ethene are
actually right over here.

00:03:55.041 --> 00:03:56.172
How can we do that?

00:03:56.172 --> 00:03:59.136
Well, just a little reminder
of the Ideal Gas Law.

00:03:59.136 --> 00:04:01.753
We have pressure, and
if we're talking about

00:04:01.753 --> 00:04:03.521
one particular thing, here we'd be talking

00:04:03.521 --> 00:04:05.592
about the partial pressure of ethene,

00:04:05.592 --> 00:04:08.869
times volume, they give us
the volume right over here,

00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:13.680
is equal to the number of
moles times the gas constant

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.686
times the temperature.

00:04:16.686 --> 00:04:18.822
Well, we have the pressure,
we have-- or, we'll be able

00:04:18.822 --> 00:04:21.358
to figure it out, we have the volume,

00:04:21.358 --> 00:04:23.265
we have the gas constant.

00:04:23.265 --> 00:04:24.952
You don't have to memorize these things.

00:04:24.952 --> 00:04:26.488
Right over here, I copied and pasted

00:04:26.488 --> 00:04:29.398
what they give you at the
front of the actual AP exam,

00:04:29.398 --> 00:04:31.144
so that you don't have to
memorize these constants

00:04:31.144 --> 00:04:32.139
and things like that.

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:34.544
So, we have the gas
constant, and then we have it

00:04:34.544 --> 00:04:35.956
in different units, depending on which one

00:04:35.956 --> 00:04:37.588
we want to use, and then, of course,

00:04:37.588 --> 00:04:38.965
the temperature, they give it to us.

00:04:38.965 --> 00:04:41.271
It is 305 Kelvin.

00:04:41.271 --> 00:04:44.267
So, if we want to figure
out the number of moles,

00:04:44.267 --> 00:04:46.187
right over here, you can divide both sides

00:04:46.187 --> 00:04:50.826
by RT, and so you could say n is equal to,

00:04:50.826 --> 00:04:54.646
is equal to R, sorry, n is equal to,

00:04:54.646 --> 00:04:58.121
we divide both sides,
if we divide both sides

00:04:58.121 --> 00:05:01.971
by RT, we're going to get PV, and I'll say

00:05:01.971 --> 00:05:04.784
the partial pressure of ethene,

00:05:04.784 --> 00:05:06.848
the partial pressure of ethene,

00:05:06.848 --> 00:05:10.069
times the volume, times the volume,

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:15.069
over, over R times T

00:05:15.395 --> 00:05:17.845
over R times T.

00:05:17.845 --> 00:05:20.164
And so, let's figure out
everything over here.

00:05:20.164 --> 00:05:22.871
So, what is going to be the
partial pressure of the ethene?

00:05:22.871 --> 00:05:25.118
Well, the pressure of,
the partial pressure

00:05:25.118 --> 00:05:27.875
of the ethene is going to be equal

00:05:27.875 --> 00:05:31.179
to the total pressure, the total pressure

00:05:31.179 --> 00:05:33.426
minus the partial pressure,

00:05:33.426 --> 00:05:35.324
or you could say the vapor
pressure, of the water,

00:05:35.324 --> 00:05:39.637
the partial pressure of, the
partial pressure of the water.

00:05:39.637 --> 00:05:41.466
So, this is going to be equal to,

00:05:41.466 --> 00:05:46.466
our total pressure is 0.822 atmospheres,

00:05:46.767 --> 00:05:51.767
0.822 atmospheres.

00:05:51.951 --> 00:05:53.731
Now, what's the pressure of,

00:05:53.731 --> 00:05:55.118
what's the partial pressure of the water?

00:05:55.118 --> 00:05:56.226
They tell us the vapor pressure

00:05:56.226 --> 00:06:00.288
of water at 305 Kelvin is 35.7 torr.

00:06:00.288 --> 00:06:02.903
Well, they gave us the total
pressure in atmospheres,

00:06:02.903 --> 00:06:05.218
so we have to convert
from, we have to convert

00:06:05.218 --> 00:06:07.695
from torrs to atmospheres
if we want to stay

00:06:07.695 --> 00:06:08.872
in atmospheres.

00:06:08.872 --> 00:06:09.978
So I'll do it over here.

00:06:09.978 --> 00:06:13.808
So, the pressure, the pressure
of, the partial pressure

00:06:13.808 --> 00:06:18.808
of the water is equal to 35.7 torr,

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.026
which is a unit of pressure.

00:06:21.026 --> 00:06:22.836
But if we want to convert
it to atmospheres,

00:06:22.836 --> 00:06:24.599
once again, you don't have
to memorize these things.

00:06:24.599 --> 00:06:26.119
They give it to you on the test.

00:06:26.119 --> 00:06:29.941
They tell us, one atmosphere is 760 torr.

00:06:29.941 --> 00:06:32.353
So, we wanna get rid of the torr.

00:06:32.353 --> 00:06:34.313
We wanna get rid of the
torr, and we want it

00:06:34.313 --> 00:06:38.851
in terms of atmospheres,
so one atmosphere is

00:06:38.851 --> 00:06:42.392
760 torr, so this is going to be equal

00:06:42.392 --> 00:06:46.425
to 35.7 divided by 760.

00:06:46.425 --> 00:06:48.521
So it's this is the total pressure,

00:06:48.521 --> 00:06:50.791
minus the partial pressure of the water.

00:06:50.791 --> 00:06:52.626
Let's see, the partial
pressure of the water,

00:06:52.626 --> 00:06:54.483
let me figure this out.

00:06:54.483 --> 00:06:58.480
It is going to be 35.7 torr

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.500
times one atmosphere

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:04.996
for every 760 torr, so
I'll just divide by 760,

00:07:04.996 --> 00:07:07.806
divided by 760, is equal to,

00:07:07.806 --> 00:07:10.232
and I have three significant digits here.

00:07:10.232 --> 00:07:15.232
So, 0.0470.

00:07:16.007 --> 00:07:19.737
0.0470.

00:07:19.737 --> 00:07:21.294
So this is going to be

00:07:22.644 --> 00:07:27.624
0.0470 atmospheres.

00:07:28.854 --> 00:07:30.005
So, let me write that down.

00:07:30.005 --> 00:07:32.739
So, the total pressure
minus the partial pressure

00:07:32.739 --> 00:07:33.677
of the water,

00:07:33.677 --> 00:07:38.677
0.0470 atmospheres,

00:07:39.287 --> 00:07:43.556
is going to be equal to,
is going to be equal to--

00:07:43.556 --> 00:07:45.716
So, let me just take my--

00:07:45.716 --> 00:07:48.042
Well, I could just make that a negative,

00:07:48.042 --> 00:07:49.871
and then add it to the total pressure,

00:07:49.871 --> 00:07:54.642
so, plus, plus .822

00:07:54.642 --> 00:07:58.376
or 0.822 is going to be equal to...

00:07:58.376 --> 00:08:01.153
So, the partial pressure of our ethene,

00:08:01.153 --> 00:08:02.889
three significant digits here,

00:08:02.889 --> 00:08:07.249
is going to be 775, 0.775.

00:08:07.249 --> 00:08:12.249
So, 0.775.

00:08:12.306 --> 00:08:14.132
And so now, we can substitute that in.

00:08:14.132 --> 00:08:16.355
We know everything to figure
out the number of moles.

00:08:16.355 --> 00:08:21.273
N is going to be equal to 0.775.

00:08:21.273 --> 00:08:23.148
The units here are atmospheres;

00:08:23.148 --> 00:08:24.340
we can always check to make sure

00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:27.458
that we get that right, atmospheres.

00:08:27.458 --> 00:08:29.016
Times our volume.

00:08:29.016 --> 00:08:30.299
Well, they tell us our volume.

00:08:30.299 --> 00:08:33.248
It's 0.0854 liters,

00:08:33.248 --> 00:08:38.248
0.0854 liters,

00:08:38.628 --> 00:08:41.835
and then we divide that by RT.

00:08:41.835 --> 00:08:44.304
Now, which version of R do we use?

00:08:44.304 --> 00:08:47.552
Well, we're dealing with atmospheres,

00:08:47.552 --> 00:08:50.308
moles, and Kelvin, so we could use,

00:08:50.308 --> 00:08:52.818
we could use this right over here.

00:08:52.818 --> 00:08:54.495
If we had converted everything to torr,

00:08:54.495 --> 00:08:57.351
we would use this constant.

00:08:57.351 --> 00:08:59.684
So, our R is going to be

00:08:59.684 --> 00:09:04.474
0.08206.

00:09:04.474 --> 00:09:06.369
They're giving us more significant digits.

00:09:06.369 --> 00:09:07.834
Doesn't hurt to use
them, but later we have

00:09:07.834 --> 00:09:10.051
to just realize that we're gonna convert

00:09:10.051 --> 00:09:11.410
to only three significant digits,

00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:13.709
because that's the minimum,
that's what we have.

00:09:13.709 --> 00:09:16.165
These are three, three, this
is more than three signifi--

00:09:16.165 --> 00:09:17.814
This is four significant digits.

00:09:17.814 --> 00:09:19.690
But let's just make
sure the units work out.

00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:21.342
So, this is going to be--

00:09:21.342 --> 00:09:26.342
So this is the units here
are liters times atmosphere,

00:09:26.699 --> 00:09:30.915
and so those will cancel
with these, divided by,

00:09:30.915 --> 00:09:33.463
we have to remember this is
in, this is in the denominator

00:09:33.463 --> 00:09:38.463
right over here, divided
by moles times Kelvin,

00:09:38.625 --> 00:09:40.939
and we multiply that
times the temperature,

00:09:40.939 --> 00:09:45.206
which is 305 Kelvin, 305 Kelvin.

00:09:45.206 --> 00:09:48.719
And we'll see, we could see that, well,

00:09:48.719 --> 00:09:50.002
this atmospheres is going to cancel

00:09:50.002 --> 00:09:51.709
with that atmospheres,
that liters is going

00:09:51.709 --> 00:09:53.810
to cancel with that liters,
this Kelvin is going

00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:56.974
to cancel with that Kelvin,
and so, in the denominator,

00:09:56.974 --> 00:09:58.294
you're dividing by moles, so that's gonna

00:09:58.294 --> 00:10:00.837
be the same thing as just
having moles as your units.

00:10:00.837 --> 00:10:02.943
And so, this is all going to be equal to,

00:10:02.943 --> 00:10:04.619
we deserve a little bit of a,

00:10:04.619 --> 00:10:06.776
we deserve a little
bit of a drumroll here.

00:10:06.776 --> 00:10:08.787
This is equal to--

00:10:08.787 --> 00:10:13.778
So, 0.775 atmospheres

00:10:15.508 --> 00:10:20.489
times .0854 liters

00:10:23.539 --> 00:10:28.539
divided by .08206,

00:10:30.981 --> 00:10:32.282
so that gets us that,

00:10:32.282 --> 00:10:34.525
and then we're going to divide by 305.

00:10:34.525 --> 00:10:36.166
We still have that in the denominator,

00:10:36.166 --> 00:10:38.586
divided by 305,

00:10:38.586 --> 00:10:42.203
is equal to, and if we do
three significant digits,

00:10:42.203 --> 00:10:47.134
it's 0.00264.

00:10:47.134 --> 00:10:49.681
So this is approximately, I could say,

00:10:49.681 --> 00:10:54.563
0.00264

00:10:54.563 --> 00:10:56.578
264 moles.

00:10:56.578 --> 00:10:58.593
Did I write that right?
I have a bad memory.

00:10:58.593 --> 00:11:01.176
0.00264, yeah,

00:11:01.176 --> 00:11:03.886
I rounded down to 264 moles.

00:11:03.886 --> 00:11:06.064
And there you have it, that's part one.

00:11:06.064 --> 00:11:09.034
The number of moles of ethene
that are actually produced

00:11:09.034 --> 00:11:12.489
in the experiment and measured
in the gas collection tube.
