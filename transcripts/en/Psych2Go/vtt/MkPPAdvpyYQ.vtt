00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:01.860
[Intro]

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.160
What do we call people with no conscience,

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.779
who seem to have absolute disregard to other people, society and societal rules?

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.620
The usual: psychopaths and sociopaths.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.600
You must be thinking,

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.940
Buffalo Bill, Patrick Bateman, Hannibal Lecter,

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.600
John Doe, the Joker and the list goes on.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.640
If Hollywood is in your cup of tea, then images of Ted Bundy,

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.380
Jeffrey Dahmer, and Charles Manson definitely pop into your head.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.620
You're right to think so, but these are not the most accurate and rather realistic examples.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.300
Actually, there might be examples that you might know of on a personal level.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:58.360
Psychopathy and sociopathy are perhaps two of the most confused terms in the field of psychology and criminology.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.720
While these terms sound very similar,

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.420
they do in fact differ in characteristics.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:08.140
Both disorders are categorized as antisocial personality disorders,

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.300
as they share major characteristics

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.040
Although many experts disagree on the significance of these differences,

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.600
Dr. Scott A. Bond offers a compelling hypothesis that psychopathy is a result of genetics,

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.800
while sociopathy is a learnt behavior,

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.720
because sociopaths do have the ability to feel empathy,

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.020
as well as form emotional attachments to certain people.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.720
He suggests childhood trauma and physical or emotional abuse are possible causes of sociopathy.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.960
So, is it possible that you might personally know a sociopath?

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.240
Unfortunately, it is.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.080
Here are five signs of sociopaths that will tell you if you might have met a sociopath, but just don't know.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.820
1. They have a grandiose sense of self.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.740
Sociopaths tend to entitle themselves to certain things

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.920
and claim them as their own, as they think it is their right to do so.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.840
When confronted, they do not find anything wrong with their actions or themselves.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.200
They can even turn tables to manipulatively make it seem like others are the selfish ones.

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:14.200
This sense of self-righteousness is supported by their artificial charm,

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.580
which in turn stems from the manipulation,

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.720
resulting in a loop of characteristics.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.680
Although they do appear quite attractive personality-wise,

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.280
they are in fact domineering and consider others as mere instruments to be used for self-indulgence.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.300
On the business level they are highly authoritarian,

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.440
sometimes even tyrannical when given the opportunity.

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.780
2. They are mischievous,

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.400
cunning, or have behavioral problems.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.780
Usually, sociopaths have a history of behavioral and/or academic trouble.

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.800
But only in rare cases are they in trouble with the law.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.840
A sociopath lies so often it becomes part of their personality.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.520
They are extremely cunning and know how to easily convince people.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.380
However, they have difficulties in making and keeping friends.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:06.620
The compassion a sociopath demonstrates is usually stimulated rather than felt, and serves a certain motive.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.500
Despite that they do actually have a sense of morality unlike psychopaths,

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.080
but appear to be satisfied by their own antisocial behavior.

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.580
3. They are irresponsible or unreliable.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.740
A sociopath is not interested in others' needs, lives, or even safety,

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.400
and is oblivious to the damage they cause.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.560
Sometimes, they aren't even concerned about their own safety.

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.180
On the personal level, when in trouble,

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.940
they tend to quickly accuse someone else of being guilty,

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.280
even when the action is of their own doing.

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.820
On both the personal and business levels,

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.240
they fail to plan ahead,

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.500
lack realistic visions for the future,

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.060
and exploit others for their own advantage without a second thought.

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.660
4. They have poor behavioural controls or an impulsive nature.

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.520
When dealing with the sociopath,

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.440
you find yourself in a cycle of short periods of peaceful expressions,

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.240
followed by periods of rage that can sometimes develop into abuse,

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:07.260
and once again followed by short periods of emotional and mental peace.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.020
This cycle makes the abuse feel helpless.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.660
Sociopaths' poor rage control issues reach repeated violent assaults on other people,

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.880
as well as, if not especially on, animals.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.800
Sometimes a matter that would make a normal person angry would mean nothing to a sociopath,

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.440
and yet matters which might be of no worth to a normal person can outrage a sociopath.

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.040
5. They are unable to feel guilt, shame, or remorse.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.840
"The ends justify the means"

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.460
is perhaps the most descriptive idiom of how sociopaths feel about their actions.

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.160
When a sociopath has a certain goal in mind,

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.760
they have no problem causing devastation to others, as long as they can reach that outcome.

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.540
They won't let anything stand in their way and have no remorse.

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.080
This is because they have shallow emotions and lack empathy

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.760
in addition to having a grandiose sense of self.

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.080
Their lack of remorse and guilt

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.480
stems from their ability to rationalize the pain they inflict on others,

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.720
an inability to empathize with the pain of their victims.

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.440
So, does anyone come to mind after listening to these traits?
