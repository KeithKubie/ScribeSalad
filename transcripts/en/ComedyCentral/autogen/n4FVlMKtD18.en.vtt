that up because when President Trump

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060
that up because when President Trump
 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.979
that up because when President Trump
said that there were three to five

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380
that's actually in my mind the biggest
 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.229
that's actually in my mind the biggest
lie that a sitting president has ever

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239
lie that a sitting president has ever
 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:51.180
lie that a sitting president has ever
told and I think when he told that a lot

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190
told and I think when he told that a lot
 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:52.770
told and I think when he told that a lot
of people went okay well here's just a

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780

guy who lost the popular vote by about
that amount and he's making this up and

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260
that amount and he's making this up and
 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.140
that amount and he's making this up and
and that's a reasonable take away from

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:59.970
and that's a reasonable take away from
it but the rest of the story is is that

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980
it but the rest of the story is is that

voted for that one person is there a
 

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:51.900
voted for that one person is there a
common ground to be had there yeah and

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:51.910
common ground to be had there yeah and
 

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:53.880
common ground to be had there yeah and
the key is to tell your own story like I

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:53.890
the key is to tell your own story like I
 

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:55.170
the key is to tell your own story like I
refer to this as showing your math

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:55.180
refer to this as showing your math
 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:56.580
refer to this as showing your math
because like when I was in school I

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:56.590
because like when I was in school I
 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:58.290
because like when I was in school I
wasn't very good at math and I realized

00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:58.300
wasn't very good at math and I realized
 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.480
wasn't very good at math and I realized
that if I like showed my journey on the

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:00.490
that if I like showed my journey on the
 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:01.950
that if I like showed my journey on the
way to my answer that sometimes the

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:01.960
way to my answer that sometimes the
 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:03.360
way to my answer that sometimes the
teacher would give me like a partial

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:03.370
teacher would give me like a partial
 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:05.280
teacher would give me like a partial
credit for it so it's the same thing

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:05.290
credit for it so it's the same thing
 

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:07.110
credit for it so it's the same thing
it's if somebody if you're saying

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.120
it's if somebody if you're saying
 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.490
it's if somebody if you're saying
something to somebody and they don't

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:08.500
something to somebody and they don't
 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:09.690
something to somebody and they don't
really agree with your position you got

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:09.700
really agree with your position you got
 

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:11.010
really agree with your position you got
to tell them how you got there you got

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:11.020
to tell them how you got there you got
 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:12.210
to tell them how you got there you got

that brought you to that point it's
 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.420
that brought you to that point it's
showing your math and it causes people

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:15.430
showing your math and it causes people
 

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:16.950
showing your math and it causes people
to kind of let their barriers down and

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:16.960
to kind of let their barriers down and
 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.300
to kind of let their barriers down and
it's sort of what we show on the podcast

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:18.310
it's sort of what we show on the podcast
 

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:20.730
it's sort of what we show on the podcast

and in order to connect with them they

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:24.370
and in order to connect with them they
 

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:26.190
and in order to connect with them they
have to show their math yeah yeah it's

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:26.200
have to show their math yeah yeah it's
 

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:27.360
have to show their math yeah yeah it's
like you're gonna get a tunnel you're

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:27.370
like you're gonna get a tunnel you're
 

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:28.920
like you're gonna get a tunnel you're
gonna get a tunnel listeners let me tell

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:28.930
gonna get a tunnel listeners let me tell
 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.170
gonna get a tunnel listeners let me tell
you there's no math involved oh man or

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:31.180
you there's no math involved oh man or
 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:32.550
you there's no math involved oh man or
anything you don't have to do any math

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:32.560
anything you don't have to do any math
 

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.150
anything you don't have to do any math
no huh tell me something I already know

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:35.160
no huh tell me something I already know

means that even if he won the election
he didn't win the argument about who

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:44.890
he didn't win the argument about who

country right now that 54% is growing
 

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.260
country right now that 54% is growing
even more and the most effective

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:52.270
even more and the most effective
 

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:53.790
even more and the most effective

a big difference in November electoral
 

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:08.460
a big difference in November electoral
