[inaudible]

2
00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.690
<v 1>Bridgette,
we've talked for about 35 minutes.
We have not said the two words.</v>

3
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.900
Donald Trump.
First off,

4
00:00:12.901 --> 00:00:15.960
I think we just had a record 35 minutes of conversation without saying Trump

5
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.040
once.
Okay.
You are a Trump supporter.
I'm a trumpet player.

6
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.390
Trumpets here.
Okay.
You're a Trumper tier.
I think you've met with the president,

7
00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:27.730
right?
Yes.
Um,
how does,
well,

8
00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.680
what can you tell me something about him maybe that the average person doesn't

9
00:00:31.681 --> 00:00:35.220
know or that you might not get through the filter of CNN or that you maybe don't

10
00:00:35.221 --> 00:00:37.290
even get through the filter of Twitter.

11
00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:39.820
<v 2>He is somebody.</v>

12
00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.850
He is a billionaire who left the life of luxury to serve the American people.

13
00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.580
He is somebody who is not doing it for power.
He already had power.

14
00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.200
He's not doing it for fame.
He already had fame.
He's not doing it for the money.

15
00:00:56.201 --> 00:00:59.140
He already had money.
He doesn't care.

16
00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:04.170
He wakes up every morning to all the insults and the hate and images of

17
00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:09.840
beheading by Cathy Griffith that his son can watch and be mortified that

18
00:01:10.091 --> 00:01:14.830
somebody actually really called my dad and then he remembers I'm not doing this

19
00:01:14.831 --> 00:01:18.700
to please the media.
I'm doing it because I'm fighting for the American people.

20
00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.290
They hate him,
not because,
um,

21
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.130
they hate him because he is serving the American people.

22
00:01:27.131 --> 00:01:30.160
He is putting America first and they do not know how to handle him.

23
00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:35.370
And that's why Donald Trump is resonating with a lot of people in this country,

24
00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.360
from CEO's of companies.

25
00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.190
The janitors working for $10 an hour because from the janitor to the CEO,

26
00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.170
they know,
and everybody in between.

27
00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.190
President Donald Trump is working for me.

28
00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.760
And it's a breath of fresh air because for decades now,

29
00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.130
we have had many presidents on the right than the left.

30
00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.780
Not many people could say,
Barack Obama's working for me,

31
00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.950
or George Bush is working for me.
Our Clinton is working for me.

32
00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:05.080
But with Donald Trump,

33
00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.750
the janitor knows president Donald Trump is working for me.

34
00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.410
And that's why he's resonating with the people.
So when you see that

35
00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.150
<v 1>the,
the tweets and some of the over the top stuff,
you know,</v>

36
00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.370
every now and again I'll watch some old clips from him in the 80s talking to

37
00:02:21.371 --> 00:02:26.030
Oprah or Phil Donahue and he's,
he's soft and,
and seemingly,
you know,

38
00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.220
very pleasant and open and you can see the way in Q and A's with audience

39
00:02:30.221 --> 00:02:33.550
members.
I think on Donahue.
He's,
he's extremely human.

40
00:02:33.551 --> 00:02:38.260
All of these things and it's not exactly the caricature that we get these days.

41
00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.980
Do you think that he sort of became this thing because it was the only,

42
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.530
he basically was the,

43
00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.250
it was the only way he would have been hard enough to break through.

44
00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:49.660
Does that make sense?

45
00:02:49.661 --> 00:02:54.661
Like I think he was probably extremely similar to the person from back then,

46
00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:59.920
but he became hardened because it was the only way were going to ever break

47
00:02:59.921 --> 00:03:00.070
through.

48
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.100
<v 2>There's like no one else was ever going to break through this thing and she</v>

49
00:03:03.101 --> 00:03:06.270
listened.
I asked that in a very convoluted,
but I think you got the point there.

50
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:12.120
Donald Trump today is the exact same person he was 25 years ago when he was on

51
00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:19.420
Phil Donahue when he wasn't Oprah.
He still says the exact same words.

52
00:03:19.421 --> 00:03:22.900
Have you noticed?
Well,
the theme is the same,
but he's,
he's hard in now.

53
00:03:22.901 --> 00:03:25.570
There's like a,
and I don't,
I'm not even blaming him for that.

54
00:03:25.571 --> 00:03:26.950
I think to go through this,

55
00:03:26.951 --> 00:03:29.680
to go through the media machine and the establishment and all that,

56
00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.800
you've got to get hardened.
Otherwise it will choke everybody out,

57
00:03:32.801 --> 00:03:35.380
which is what he does fight to win.

58
00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.120
Before they didn't argue with what he said,
so you didn't see that side of him.

59
00:03:40.121 --> 00:03:41.800
He would've been just as hard back then.

60
00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.880
Today they do not want to listen to any words.

61
00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.910
He says if he became Jesus,
they would find a reason to fight against them.

62
00:03:48.911 --> 00:03:52.390
They would call him,
you know,
evil,
Heiter,
monster,
whatever,
whatever,
whatever.

63
00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.730
So the reason why they call him all the names that they call him now is because

64
00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.480
he has not toeing the line to them.
Look,
he has 90 million followers on Twitter.

65
00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.420
He goes straight around the media.
He doesn't need the media.

66
00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.050
He is communicating directly with the American people.
And the media hates this.

67
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.630
And he is somebody who fights the bread.
I love his tweets,
by the way.
You know,

68
00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.830
and math makes a lot of people uncomfortable.
Oh my God,

69
00:04:14.831 --> 00:04:16.810
I cannot believe he tweeted that.
You know what?

70
00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:21.160
We finally have a man who stands up to the bullyism punches back.

71
00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:24.280
We are so used to men who are whizzes in this country.

72
00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.900
We have forgotten what it's like to see a real man who stands up and says,

73
00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:34.290
I respect myself too much to let you walk all over me or call me that or treat

74
00:04:34.961 --> 00:04:37.960
me that way.
But if you're treating me that way,
I'm going to punch you back.

75
00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:39.940
Now stand up like a man in Fyc me,

76
00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.900
we forgot how a man like that looks like.

77
00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:49.260
And so Donald Trump is shocking the system at a time where men have been

78
00:04:50.171 --> 00:04:54.460
stripped out of their manhood that you,
you know,
uh,

79
00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:58.090
the society is changing,
you know,
roles are changing.

80
00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.100
So in our society today,

81
00:05:00.101 --> 00:05:03.280
they want the man that they can walk all over and you know,
they say,
oh,

82
00:05:03.281 --> 00:05:08.170
we need somebody who is nice and you know,
like Romney or McCain,
you know,

83
00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:10.660
everybody loved Mccain until he ran for president.

84
00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:11.920
Then they did the same thing to him.

85
00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.470
Everybody loved Romney until he ran for president.

86
00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.750
They did the same thing to him.
I mean,

87
00:05:16.751 --> 00:05:19.750
if you would hear CNN talking about Romney or McCain when they were running for

88
00:05:19.751 --> 00:05:24.010
president,
they were saying the same thing.
He hated women.
All of those things.

89
00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.980
I'm completely with you on that part.
Yeah,
that's what I mean by the,

90
00:05:26.981 --> 00:05:28.150
the hardening of Trump,

91
00:05:28.151 --> 00:05:33.151
that he almost had to be this thing because nobody else could have,

92
00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:37.510
they tried it the other way.
They tried it with Knight,
you know,
nicer people,

93
00:05:37.511 --> 00:05:41.380
so to speak,
and it just doesn't work.
So it's like,
well,
this is,

94
00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:42.580
this is the guy you're going to get.

95
00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:47.020
I had his getting things done and the American people are behind him and he is

96
00:05:47.021 --> 00:05:50.440
resonating with the American people.
And if his message wasn't resonating,

97
00:05:50.441 --> 00:05:53.290
he wouldn't have the tens of millions of followers that are following him on

98
00:05:53.291 --> 00:05:58.050
social media and still rooting for him and the Donald Trump supporters there.

99
00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:01.580
He'll even deeper with all the attacks from the media,

100
00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:05.000
even the attacks from his own party,
they've,
I mean,
look,

101
00:06:05.001 --> 00:06:07.940
you and I know there are people who hate his guts in Washington DC.

102
00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:09.440
You talk about cleaning the swamp.

103
00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:14.390
He is shaking everybody the left and the right,
despite all that,

104
00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:19.310
his support,
his approval rating is at an all time high.
You know,

105
00:06:19.311 --> 00:06:22.130
so it doesn't matter what people are saying to him.

106
00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:25.520
He is doing what is right by the American people by America.

107
00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:29.420
So what are some of the policies that he's doing that,
that Jive with this book?

108
00:06:29.421 --> 00:06:31.560
Like in terms of borders and stuff like that,
you're,

109
00:06:31.561 --> 00:06:35.630
you're for building the wall.
Absolutely.
Yeah,
absolutely.
And here's why.

110
00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:39.680
I am a legal immigrant to the United States.

111
00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:42.260
I understand what it's like for people to want to come here.

112
00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:46.190
I want it to come here so badly.
I remember getting an American flag,

113
00:06:46.191 --> 00:06:50.690
putting it under my pillow and my bomb shelter and I couldn't wait to come to

114
00:06:50.691 --> 00:06:52.370
America.
I learned English.

115
00:06:52.371 --> 00:06:55.400
I don't know if I shared with you this was your last time writing subtitles on

116
00:06:55.401 --> 00:06:58.070
my arm.
Did I tell you that's how I learned English.

117
00:06:58.071 --> 00:06:59.480
I never studied English at school.

118
00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:04.400
I was so determined to come to the United States that we would watch black and

119
00:07:04.401 --> 00:07:08.600
white television operated on a car battery and our bomb shelter and my father

120
00:07:08.601 --> 00:07:11.720
would watch the news and if there was any charge of the battery left,

121
00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:16.100
I would watch the love boat on Wednesday night and Dallas on Friday night.

122
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:20.360
And you know,
we,
we would have every sub title.
I know,

123
00:07:20.361 --> 00:07:25.330
I know that the button downs that,
that,
that's what impacted my life.
And,

124
00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:27.740
and if two people looked into each other's eyes and you know,

125
00:07:27.741 --> 00:07:31.180
he said something to her and she said maybe and they would write to us.

126
00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:35.300
Maybe we met on the bottom.
I knew that maybe meant whatever that word in Arabic.

127
00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:39.020
And I would literally write it in ink on my arm.

128
00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:42.110
And because we barely had water to drink,
let along shower.

129
00:07:42.111 --> 00:07:45.500
We showered once a week.
I felt a huge vocabulary on my arm.

130
00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:50.210
That's how I learned English because I was so determined that if I ever meet an

131
00:07:50.211 --> 00:07:50.960
American,

132
00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:54.830
I want to be able to be able to communicate with them in their language so I can

133
00:07:54.831 --> 00:07:59.120
get to the United States.
And when I came to the United States,
uh,

134
00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:00.590
I came to America by marriage.

135
00:08:00.591 --> 00:08:04.850
I had married an American war correspondent in Jerusalem.
We came to America.

136
00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:07.940
We put in my papers to become an American.
I flew here,

137
00:08:07.941 --> 00:08:11.510
I paid for my airline ticket,
paid for my attorneys to do all my paperwork,

138
00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:16.370
paid for my doctor's visit to do all the needle poking to make sure I'm tested

139
00:08:16.371 --> 00:08:19.190
for this disease and that disease to make sure I'm not bringing anything to the

140
00:08:19.191 --> 00:08:20.024
country.

141
00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:24.470
And then I had to study at two inch thick book written by the daughters of the

142
00:08:24.471 --> 00:08:29.471
American revolution about America's history and heritage and pass a written exam

143
00:08:30.831 --> 00:08:35.450
as well as a verbal exam in English before I became an American about America's

144
00:08:35.451 --> 00:08:38.150
history.
By the time I became an American,

145
00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:42.740
I knew more about America's history than my own American born husband did.

146
00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:45.230
I am a legal immigrant.

147
00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:49.490
Those are the type of immigrants we need coming to America because we had a fire

148
00:08:49.491 --> 00:08:53.570
in our belly to be all we can be as Americans right now.

149
00:08:53.571 --> 00:08:55.890
The people who are breaking the law to get here,

150
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:59.700
not because they want to come here for a better life or they are escaping

151
00:08:59.701 --> 00:09:03.030
persecution.
Look at the caravan that's coming to the United States.

152
00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:07.710
Mexico offered them asylum.
Mexico offered them jobs.

153
00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:08.820
They didn't want it.

154
00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:13.660
They're not there to save jobs or asylum that you n they best literally by you

155
00:09:13.661 --> 00:09:18.480
and center set up specifically for those who want asylum and claiming refugee

156
00:09:18.481 --> 00:09:22.920
status.
They didn't even stop continued coming to the United States,

157
00:09:22.921 --> 00:09:25.980
to the border and not even to the port of entry.

158
00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:30.990
Just to break the law to get here,
we have to have law and order in the country.

159
00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:32.880
So yes,
I support Donald Trump.

160
00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:37.140
Build a wall and make sure anybody who wants to come to the United States can go

161
00:09:37.141 --> 00:09:42.141
through the proper channel and earn the privilege to be an American because it

162
00:09:42.511 --> 00:09:46.860
is a privilege because people like me who did it by the book are insulted and

163
00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:51.890
offended when we see criminals are allowed to come in here and have the same

164
00:09:52.231 --> 00:09:54.630
rights that we paid with our sweat,

165
00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:59.130
heart and blood to get and work very hard for years to become Americans.
Yep.

166
00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:02.370
<v 1>That's so fascinating to me because they've also done plenty of studies on this</v>

167
00:10:02.371 --> 00:10:07.280
where recent immigrants are actually against the caravan and against a lot of

168
00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:09.990
playful,
not because they have anything against the people,

169
00:10:09.991 --> 00:10:14.490
but if you did it the right way,
right?
If you did it the way the law lays out,

170
00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:17.600
well then you don't want people to just just storming over and that's,

171
00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:19.490
that is what a nation of laws is

172
00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:20.740
<v 2>so.
Right?
And you don't,</v>

173
00:10:20.741 --> 00:10:24.040
when you look at what the legal immigration is costing the United States,

174
00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:29.280
do you know that $45 billion a year leaves America from those illegal aliens

175
00:10:31.931 --> 00:10:33.580
that come here to work in the United States,

176
00:10:33.581 --> 00:10:37.000
that illegal criminal aliens and they sent it to their countries of origin.

177
00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:38.920
That money is not staying here.

178
00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:41.680
They're not here to become a part of the American fabric,

179
00:10:41.681 --> 00:10:46.150
to contribute to American society,
to grow,
to become all they can be.

180
00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:50.140
They are here to use our system and siphon money and send it out there.

181
00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:55.350
Do you know that it cost the American public $200 billion a year and welfare

182
00:10:56.321 --> 00:11:00.970
expenses by criminal illegal aliens to the United States?
Uh,

183
00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.000
3 million illegal aliens are incarcerated daily in American prisons.

184
00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:11.430
30% of federal inmates in federal prisons are illegal criminal aliens.

185
00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:14.470
So when you look at the cost,
when you add all the costs,

186
00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:17.650
and I can rattle in a bunch of points,
but when you add it all up,

187
00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:22.710
$338 billion a year is the cost of illegal immigration to the United States.

188
00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:29.850
The cost to build the wall is nothing compared to what we're paying annually and

189
00:11:30.371 --> 00:11:32.050
a left illegal criminal aliens.

190
00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:35.860
Not to mention the crimes killing our children.

191
00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:39.040
Ms 13 gangs coming here and what they're doing to our society.

192
00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:40.300
We don't want any of that.

193
00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:43.390
<v 1>What do you make of the same people who will tell you that America is an evil</v>

194
00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:45.010
patriarchal capitalist,

195
00:11:45.011 --> 00:11:49.630
that monster that also want open borders to apparently share in that Har with

196
00:11:49.631 --> 00:11:50.464
everybody else?

197
00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:54.940
<v 2>America Pretty,
pretty flawed.
There wouldn't be.
Absolutely.</v>

198
00:11:54.941 --> 00:11:58.450
America is the most incredible nation on the face of the planet.
Look,

199
00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:00.910
you traveled the world.
You're traveling on a speaking tour.

200
00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:05.170
I was born and raised on the other side of the world.
I understand.

201
00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:09.190
I've seen you and I have traveled the world.
I mean from Australia to Europe.

202
00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:13.990
I mean we've been on a lot of places.
You and I,
and we have seen how the other,

203
00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:16.990
the rest of the world lives compared to the rights that we have here.
Look,

204
00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:20.290
our poorest of the poor who are living on welfare,

205
00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:23.410
have dishwashers in their government,
paid housing,

206
00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:27.610
have heating and air conditioning,
have cell phones.
You know,

207
00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:32.320
these are luxury items and many other places in the rest of the world.

208
00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:36.040
Um,
even in developed countries that are considered luxury items,

209
00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:39.430
this is what we give to people who are living on welfare in the United States.

210
00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:42.550
So those who complain about America need to open their eyes.

211
00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:45.010
They need to go to India,
you know,
to the slums of India.

212
00:12:45.250 --> 00:12:47.830
They need to visit the Philippines,
they need to go to Vietnam,

213
00:12:47.831 --> 00:12:49.750
they need to go to Egypt.

214
00:12:49.751 --> 00:12:53.170
They need to see how the rest of the world lives and then come back to America

215
00:12:53.171 --> 00:12:54.004
and complain.

216
00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:58.520
<v 1>A lazy way of thinking really.
Cause it's just easier to destroy than create.</v>

217
00:12:58.521 --> 00:13:02.930
So it's just easier to sit here after all of the hard one freedoms and tell you

218
00:13:02.931 --> 00:13:06.920
how horrible everything is rather than actually fix anything but burning things

219
00:13:06.921 --> 00:13:08.080
down.
It's a lot easier.
Right,

220
00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:12.860
<v 2>exactly.
Exactly.
And they,
uh,
and,
but no one's holding them accountable.</v>

221
00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:18.040
You see people like us and the old grade generation who really fought World War

222
00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:21.800
II,
who are the veterans are still lying among us today who fought,
you know,

223
00:13:21.801 --> 00:13:24.890
and the wards,
whether in Korea or in Vietnam or World War Two.

224
00:13:24.891 --> 00:13:28.040
I mean now they're getting older and fewer and dying,
but their descendants.

225
00:13:28.041 --> 00:13:32.270
So understand what America did to the world and the freedoms that we helped

226
00:13:32.271 --> 00:13:35.960
spread around the world.
Look,
we didn't want anything from the Japan.

227
00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:39.650
We conquered nation and then we gave them their freedom and then rebuild them.

228
00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:42.980
Who does that?
We didn't go to Iraq because we wanted the oil.

229
00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:45.080
We didn't go to Afghanistan because we wanted the oil.

230
00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:48.470
We went there and started building schools on bridges for them to improve their

231
00:13:48.471 --> 00:13:51.230
lives and left and didn't take any of the oils with us.

232
00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:56.620
We want to improve the world and we need the fight right now.

233
00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:01.220
Those Lazy American brats who are speaking ELLs of America,

234
00:14:01.221 --> 00:14:04.730
who do not understand the America we need to come together,

235
00:14:04.731 --> 00:14:08.840
organize and rise,
rise together in defense of America.

236
00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:13.730
And that's why we need to come together and understand what we are facing,

237
00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:17.760
how we are losing our country.
And this is what I get to a in the book.
You know,

238
00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:21.680
I say,
how did we go from the stories of George Washington and the Cherry Tree?

239
00:14:21.681 --> 00:14:26.330
I shall never tell a lie.
How did we go from that generation?
Do the ANTIFA thug.

240
00:14:26.331 --> 00:14:29.300
So we're born and raised in America,
went to American schools,

241
00:14:29.301 --> 00:14:33.440
paid for by our tax dollars.
Who believe you can cheat,
you can lie,
you can still,

242
00:14:33.441 --> 00:14:37.280
you can show up with machetes,
uh,
you,
uh,
and,
and brass knuckles.

243
00:14:37.281 --> 00:14:39.560
You can hit people,
you can block bridges,

244
00:14:39.561 --> 00:14:42.590
you can destroy property and you feel justified doing it.

245
00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:47.030
How did we go in one generation and one lifetime from this to that?

246
00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:50.750
And that's why we need to stand up.
Those of us who are in the middle,

247
00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:55.370
who America greatness need to come together and stand up to fight the protect

248
00:14:55.371 --> 00:14:57.830
America while we still have a chance.

249
00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:01.260
<v 1>So what are the other Judeo Christian values that we need to be thinking about?</v>

250
00:15:01.261 --> 00:15:02.310
We talked about free speech.

251
00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:06.300
What are the other bedrock principles that we need to fight back some of this

252
00:15:06.301 --> 00:15:07.134
stuff?

253
00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:10.280
<v 2>Oh my goodness.
We need to fight to protect our language.
Yeah.</v>

254
00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:14.400
I explained something very easy to you.
You,
we cannot lose our language.

255
00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:17.640
Language Unites People in one nation,
the English language.

256
00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:21.690
Right now we are importing people from different parts of the world and we are

257
00:15:21.691 --> 00:15:24.420
not making them learn English.

258
00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:28.260
We are now have public schools that have 16 different languages that are spoken

259
00:15:28.261 --> 00:15:31.170
in a public school and teachers will have to be trained to,

260
00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:34.220
to speak a certain language to children instead of saying,
okay,

261
00:15:34.221 --> 00:15:36.900
now you came to America,
I need to assimilate.
You need to learn English.

262
00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:39.300
I know Spanish people who have been in this country,

263
00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:41.550
Mexican people for over 20 years,

264
00:15:41.551 --> 00:15:44.730
they still cannot speak English properly or they speak very little English.

265
00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:47.550
That's not acceptable.
That's not what made America great.

266
00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:51.750
We have got to enforce that English is the official language of the United

267
00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:55.350
States and show domain,
so we welcome people from all backgrounds.

268
00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:57.750
The immigrants that came to this country back.

269
00:15:57.751 --> 00:16:01.980
The Jews that came from all over the world,
the Iris,
the Catholic,
they,
everybody,

270
00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:03.720
they came to the United States.

271
00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:08.430
They made sure their children spoke English because they wanted their kids to

272
00:16:08.431 --> 00:16:10.500
become as American,
as Apple Pie,

273
00:16:10.501 --> 00:16:13.740
as fast as possible to assimilate into the society.

274
00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:17.070
We're not seeing that right now.
We are seeing,
uh,

275
00:16:17.130 --> 00:16:20.160
in Detroit to call government office.
You getting called in Arabic,
you know,

276
00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:22.290
and then you push like four for English.

277
00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:25.230
First you got Arabic and then you've got Spanish and then you get this and this

278
00:16:25.231 --> 00:16:29.610
and that.
That's unacceptable.
And people need to understand their power.

279
00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:31.080
And my book at the,

280
00:16:31.081 --> 00:16:35.070
at the end of every chapter I have a section titled Dries Up and act.

281
00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:38.400
No matter what I'm talking about,
I give people ideas and tips.

282
00:16:38.401 --> 00:16:41.310
Three things you can do under 10 minutes that will make a difference for the

283
00:16:41.311 --> 00:16:44.250
country and you can do them sipping your cup of coffee,

284
00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:48.320
any or pajamas at 7:00 AM in the morning to give you an idea.
Yeah,

285
00:16:48.390 --> 00:16:51.090
calling your elected official.
Many people say,
Bridgette,

286
00:16:51.091 --> 00:16:52.230
what is my voice going to count?

287
00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:56.430
My elected official needs to hear from 40,000 people before they do something

288
00:16:56.790 --> 00:17:00.510
wrong.
I talked to elected officials all the time and I ask them,

289
00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:04.440
how many people do you need to hear from about a single issue to make it your

290
00:17:04.441 --> 00:17:08.520
top priority?
You'll be shocked.
How many do you think?

291
00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:12.740
<v 1>I mean it's gotta be so ridiculously low because nobody calls them and says,</v>

292
00:17:12.741 --> 00:17:16.080
you all think it's 40,000 but it's probably like 50 people or something.

293
00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:20.730
<v 2>That's it.
40 to 50 people and here is the science behind the numbers.</v>

294
00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.150
They believe if one person makes a phone call or writes a letter,

295
00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:29.390
he or she are representing 1000 couch potatoes who feel the same way but are too

296
00:17:29.821 --> 00:17:33.450
lazy to make a phone call or write a letter.
Yet they vote on election day.

297
00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:38.720
That translates to 40 to 50,000 voters on election day that can make or break an

298
00:17:40.591 --> 00:17:45.030
election.
So I thought people,
you can be active sitting in traffic.
I look,

299
00:17:45.090 --> 00:17:49.110
we are in la.
How many hours do you spend sitting in traffic?

300
00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:53.310
I spent two and a half hours yesterday sitting in traffic trying to go 50 miles.

301
00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:56.220
Yeah.
Program,
the White House phone number program,

302
00:17:56.221 --> 00:18:00.030
your elected officials phone number in your,
in your,
uh,
cell phone.

303
00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:04.140
When you get a text alert from us about a bill coming down for about punch a

304
00:18:04.141 --> 00:18:04.710
button,

305
00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:09.420
click and call your elected officials or send an email of when people go to act

306
00:18:09.421 --> 00:18:11.760
for america.org,
which I mentioned all throughout the book.

307
00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:14.550
My Organization Act for America,
that Org,

308
00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:16.830
they can click on contact congress,

309
00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:18.960
they can sign up to get our emails and action alerts.

310
00:18:18.961 --> 00:18:22.440
We send emails about bill's coming down for a vote.
The bill number,

311
00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:24.150
who sponsors it,
what it says.

312
00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:28.350
We even have pre written letters for them that they can email their elected

313
00:18:28.351 --> 00:18:32.700
officials with the click of a button.
It'll go to your elected official,
um,

314
00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:37.020
letters to the editors and script.
I give samples in this book.
The last chapter,

315
00:18:37.021 --> 00:18:40.680
the whole chapter is samples about activism.

316
00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:42.570
Samples about letters to the editor.

317
00:18:42.571 --> 00:18:44.820
All you have to do is add your name and send it to your newspaper.

318
00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:48.200
<v 1>It's part of the problem that we put so much emphasis on the presidency,</v>

319
00:18:48.201 --> 00:18:48.831
so it's great.

320
00:18:48.831 --> 00:18:52.880
You're doing local activism were saying call your Congress made if you've got a

321
00:18:52.881 --> 00:18:55.280
problem with your exit.
My exit right here where I live,

322
00:18:55.281 --> 00:18:57.770
I don't want to say exactly where it's filled with garbage.

323
00:18:57.771 --> 00:18:58.970
For the two years that I've been living here,

324
00:18:58.971 --> 00:19:01.760
David's been calling this guy nonstop to get the,

325
00:19:01.761 --> 00:19:04.370
he wants to go out there and start picking up stuff,
but it's too dangerous.

326
00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:05.181
But it's just,

327
00:19:05.181 --> 00:19:10.181
but like nobody focuses on local anymore because we put such emphasis on the

328
00:19:10.851 --> 00:19:14.210
executive branch,
on the cult of personality around the presidency.

329
00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:18.320
So it's like by going to your local congressman or congresswoman,

330
00:19:18.321 --> 00:19:22.130
you might actually get something done.
It's a lot harder to do it the other way.

331
00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:26.300
<v 2>Absolutely.
And I,
and on the local elected officials,
you know your local,</v>

332
00:19:26.301 --> 00:19:28.500
state and delegates,
I may have you called the guy at that,

333
00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:33.730
the 12 people that sit and so this is why we started chapters nationwide.

334
00:19:33.831 --> 00:19:37.730
This is why we have activists nationwide.
I thought people go to act for America,

335
00:19:37.970 --> 00:19:42.000
that org sign up as an activist and join the chapter or start a chapter.

336
00:19:42.001 --> 00:19:43.220
If there is no chapter near you,

337
00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:47.210
everything happens on a local level because those local elected officials that

338
00:19:47.211 --> 00:19:51.920
you develop a connection with an a contact,
go to become state elected officials.

339
00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:55.520
I then federal elected officials,
attorney generals,
and then state senators,

340
00:19:55.521 --> 00:19:58.160
congressmen.
This is how we change society.

341
00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:01.610
And so I encourage people to get involved and become engaged in.

342
00:20:01.611 --> 00:20:02.600
That's exactly what this,

343
00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:07.250
this book is a roadmap for people on how thrice rise.

344
00:20:07.251 --> 00:20:11.830
This is why we titled The tries,
you know,
are you selling the book?

345
00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:17.240
We will need to get this book and they need to donate it to every library in

346
00:20:17.241 --> 00:20:20.060
their communities.
So when people are looking to find out information,

347
00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:22.310
they can find it.
Read it for yourself,

348
00:20:22.311 --> 00:20:25.310
donated to a public library in your community,
get multiple copies.

349
00:20:25.670 --> 00:20:28.310
We want people to learn how they can be mobilized.

350
00:20:28.550 --> 00:20:33.050
The left understands how to mobilize.
We on the right,
understand the issues,

351
00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:36.110
but do not know how to mobilize.
And that's what this book teaches them.

352
00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:38.820
<v 1>So what,
what else?
What else can we do?</v>

353
00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.800
I feel like he got a couple of other tricks up your sleeve.

354
00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:42.240
<v 2>Oh,
absolutely</v>

355
00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:46.070
<v 1>sexy.
It can't just be calling your congressman.</v>

356
00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:48.270
<v 2>Make new friends.
If</v>

357
00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:50.470
<v 1>I find out,
start a chapter.</v>

358
00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:52.630
You'll get to meet great new friends in your community.

359
00:20:52.631 --> 00:20:55.030
If people sign up to be a chapter leader with us,

360
00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:59.860
we will connect them with the same group in their local community who sign up to

361
00:20:59.861 --> 00:21:01.720
get our emails and they say,
I want to join a chapter.

362
00:21:01.721 --> 00:21:05.020
I want to meet people in my community like this.
We connect them together.

363
00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:08.440
They can do local activities together.
They can go out to dinners together.

364
00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:11.560
They can work on issues relating to their community.

365
00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:15.250
I have found I have made the best friends doing my activism.

366
00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:17.380
That's what launched my career in activism.

367
00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:22.000
So this is the type of ideas that people can do.
Come together and work together.

368
00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:25.070
Have on a Saturday,
one Saturday,
uh,
have a meeting,

369
00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:26.710
a chapter meeting once a month.

370
00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:30.160
Write letters to your congressman about the garbage on the side of the street.

371
00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:34.720
You know,
we need to clean this garbage out.
This is unacceptable.
Uh,

372
00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:38.230
protests,
uh,
bills that are coming down.
I'll give you an idea.

373
00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:40.990
We're accepting all these refugees coming in here.
Uh,

374
00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:45.660
so right now we are bringing our standards down to accommodate the standards of

375
00:21:45.661 --> 00:21:48.100
people from Third World country.
To give you an example,

376
00:21:48.101 --> 00:21:53.101
the city of Denver in 2017 passed an ordinance that allowed people to defecate

377
00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:56.530
on the sidewalk.
Why?

378
00:21:56.740 --> 00:22:01.740
Because they have a lot of illegal immigrants who feel no problem to just drop

379
00:22:02.141 --> 00:22:03.790
their pants and do it on the side of the road.

380
00:22:04.090 --> 00:22:06.430
But because it is it reportable crime,

381
00:22:06.431 --> 00:22:09.580
because that crime is punishable up to one year in jail.

382
00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:11.770
And if you could put such a crime,
you are deported.

383
00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:16.090
The city of Denver has a bigger problem with illegal immigration than San

384
00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:19.120
Francisco and Philadelphia.
Hmm.
So that's why they passed the ordinance.

385
00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:20.260
They did not want people deported.

386
00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:25.180
Can you imagine if you have a chapter with 30 people or 30 people organizing

387
00:22:25.181 --> 00:22:29.260
together on the same issue,
calling your,
their local state government saying,

388
00:22:29.290 --> 00:22:32.140
this is unacceptable.
And if you don't change that,

389
00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:35.980
we're going to vote you out and replace you.
That's how the left does it.

390
00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:37.090
That's how we need to do it.

391
00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:40.680
That's a pretty clear one where you could probably escape some of the cries of

392
00:22:40.681 --> 00:22:44.580
racism,
right?
Cause nobody wants their streets filled up with pooper.
You know,

393
00:22:44.581 --> 00:22:48.180
San Francisco has this app that'll tell you where human poop is

394
00:22:49.090 --> 00:22:52.690
<v 2>unbelievable.
And now the diseases that are spreading because of that,</v>

395
00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:54.550
and this is something I mentioned in the book,

396
00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:57.790
all the rise in diseases in our country,
you know,

397
00:22:57.791 --> 00:23:00.370
you've heard the right now about the Lyme disease or that disease that's not

398
00:23:00.371 --> 00:23:05.371
being trend transferred to people because I in San Francisco you've got flies

399
00:23:05.770 --> 00:23:09.880
basically eating that human waste and then you're walking down the street and

400
00:23:09.881 --> 00:23:10.714
they're biting you.

401
00:23:10.810 --> 00:23:15.100
Some mosquitoes now are transferring these diseases that were once eliminated in

402
00:23:15.101 --> 00:23:15.970
the United States,

403
00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:20.140
but it's simply eating human waste and I'm biting you with putting it in your

404
00:23:20.141 --> 00:23:23.470
body.
This is exactly why.
About a month ago we started seeing,

405
00:23:23.650 --> 00:23:27.010
you know this disease papa people cannot explain it.
Some people died.

406
00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:30.790
Tuberculosis,
for example,
is exploding in the United States,

407
00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:35.800
the top four states with tuberculosis or California,
over 500 cases,

408
00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:39.400
Florida,
Texas,
and New York,
uh,

409
00:23:39.790 --> 00:23:43.570
16 states are now grappling with tuberculosis.

410
00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:47.270
It is the fastest growing disease in America right now.
They have,

411
00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:52.510
the state of Wisconsin alone has 116 cases of tuberculosis and the majority of

412
00:23:53.241 --> 00:23:54.470
them are drug resistant,

413
00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:58.880
which means it takes six months to treat a patient and it takes six to eight

414
00:23:58.881 --> 00:24:03.881
months to treat them at the cost of $150,000 per patient out of our tax dollars.

415
00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:08.000
These are issues we need to talk about.

416
00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:11.000
These are issues affecting our communities.
And that's what I,

417
00:24:11.030 --> 00:24:15.050
what I discuss in the book.
So it's not only about national security per se,

418
00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:18.470
it's why we need to rise up in defense of our culture and our freedoms and what

419
00:24:18.471 --> 00:24:19.490
made America great.

420
00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:24.310
<v 1>Do you find that the people that are part of act are diverse politically?</v>

421
00:24:24.311 --> 00:24:25.990
Because it's so,
it's interesting.
I mean,

422
00:24:25.991 --> 00:24:29.860
I've spent hours with you now and it's like,
I guess you're a conservative,

423
00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:33.040
but you're not.
You're,
you're sort of my kind of conservative,

424
00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:37.070
<v 2>well,
yeah.
Your husband or your friend,
right?</v>

425
00:24:37.690 --> 00:24:40.780
<v 1>Really,
you're like my kind of liberal,
which you,
which you know,</v>

426
00:24:40.930 --> 00:24:44.170
is half conservative at this point because everything is so upside down.

427
00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:47.250
But do you find that you get a real mix of,
uh,

428
00:24:47.470 --> 00:24:50.050
political views in the people that are coming to you?

429
00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:54.340
<v 2>Oh my gosh,
absolutely.
Look with our organizations.
I mean,
we have everybody,</v>

430
00:24:54.670 --> 00:24:59.670
people that put their differences aside and came together for the safety and

431
00:24:59.921 --> 00:25:04.921
security of America and preserving who we are as Americans and defending our

432
00:25:05.621 --> 00:25:10.390
American values.
Our members are Jews,
Christians,
Buddhists,
Hindus,

433
00:25:10.391 --> 00:25:14.710
atheists,
gays,
lesbians.
I mean,
I've got gay chapter leaders,

434
00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:18.310
priests,
chapter leaders.
We've got everybody,

435
00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:22.630
people like you and I and everybody else that bought.
Yeah.
You know,

436
00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:24.880
people may not agree on every single social issues,

437
00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:29.620
but people agree on a lot of things that make us Americans because we love each

438
00:25:29.621 --> 00:25:30.730
other as Americans.

439
00:25:30.910 --> 00:25:35.140
We respect each other as Americans and we want to defend our country and the

440
00:25:35.141 --> 00:25:38.950
principles that made it great.
And so that's why we work together.

441
00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:42.050
And it's like I said,
it's such a shame that no people,
you know,

442
00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:44.320
I never thought I would,
I,
you know,

443
00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:47.950
I will be called the conservative or you would be called the conservative.

444
00:25:48.250 --> 00:25:51.250
But you know what,
as far as the leftist concerned right now,

445
00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:53.190
you and I are conservatives.
Yeah.

446
00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:58.180
That doesn't matter that you are a married gay man.
Yeah.
You're conservative.

447
00:25:58.630 --> 00:26:01.570
Welcome to the new conservatism and you know,

448
00:26:01.571 --> 00:26:04.210
this is why would Donald Trump talks about nationalism.

449
00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:08.320
We are in national this country.
We are,

450
00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:12.450
we are standing up as a nation to fight w two,

451
00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:16.300
what makes America Great Patriotic America.
You know,

452
00:26:16.390 --> 00:26:18.250
the patriotism that we have in America,

453
00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:21.340
they don't have another countries of the world.
You go to Australia,

454
00:26:21.341 --> 00:26:24.730
you don't see the Australian flag flying everywhere.
You go to England.

455
00:26:24.731 --> 00:26:26.820
You don't see that in British flag right away.

456
00:26:26.850 --> 00:26:30.960
We noticed that when I was in your know that you're traveling worldwide.
Yeah.

457
00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:36.120
What makes America so unique is this nationalism that brings us all together.

458
00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:40.400
Our love for country people got the baseball,
um,

459
00:26:40.490 --> 00:26:42.820
two games and we play the national anthem.
You know,

460
00:26:42.821 --> 00:26:44.760
they don't do that in other parts of the world.

461
00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.810
They don't play the national anthem before games.
We take it for granted.

462
00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:51.660
I know everybody's upset with the president because he's talking about American

463
00:26:51.661 --> 00:26:56.250
nationalism.
What brings us together.
They need to travel to Australia,

464
00:26:56.550 --> 00:26:59.130
go to Canada,
go to Germany,

465
00:26:59.131 --> 00:27:04.050
attend a football thing.
They don't play the national anthem.

466
00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:07.440
It's not like the United States.
That's what he was referring to,

467
00:27:07.441 --> 00:27:10.980
were talking about our nationalism.
What brings us together as Americans,

468
00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:14.860
our Americanism.
He could have used a different word,
Americanism,

469
00:27:14.861 --> 00:27:17.340
so the word so the left will not feel offended,

470
00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:18.900
but that's what he was talking about.

471
00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:20.790
Pretty sure they would've offended either way.

472
00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:22.200
They would have been offended either way.

473
00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:26.220
I feel I should give you the chance to close this with this speech as epic as

474
00:27:26.221 --> 00:27:29.820
your last Po.
You've got about five of them here in the last hour.

475
00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:33.390
Where do you want to give me a closing statement that will be memorable.

476
00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:38.490
Footprints in history are not made sitting down.

477
00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:42.720
Countries cannot be saved by hashtags and tweets.

478
00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:48.450
We need to stand up and put some sweat equity into saving our country.

479
00:27:48.990 --> 00:27:53.310
But thankfully we don't have to freeze and valley forwards like our founding

480
00:27:53.311 --> 00:27:56.880
fathers in the snow waiting to see if we still have to have a country.

481
00:27:56.881 --> 00:28:01.881
The next day we can do right now with our activism is come together and get

482
00:28:02.341 --> 00:28:06.230
together at a coffee shop,
uh,
sipping our cappuccinos,

483
00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:07.620
meeting like minded,

484
00:28:07.621 --> 00:28:11.760
great American soul of America who believe in America's exceptionalism,

485
00:28:11.910 --> 00:28:13.970
who believe in safe,
secure border hope,

486
00:28:13.971 --> 00:28:18.390
believe in having law and order in our country who believe in respecting our

487
00:28:18.391 --> 00:28:18.960
police,

488
00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:23.550
who believe in honoring our military whole believe in cherishing the memories

489
00:28:23.750 --> 00:28:24.690
and,
and,
and,

490
00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:29.790
and acknowledging the freedom that we have at the sacrifices that our military

491
00:28:29.791 --> 00:28:32.880
have paid to give us the freedoms that we have today.
You know,

492
00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:37.170
when we visit other countries and you have visited France and you go to Normandy

493
00:28:37.171 --> 00:28:40.020
and you see the graves of Americans and Normandy,

494
00:28:40.410 --> 00:28:45.410
you sit back and you'll know that this American brave soldiers left their home

495
00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:51.500
and went overseas letting the life on the line to fight for freedom and for

496
00:28:51.511 --> 00:28:54.990
justice.
And for the American values,

497
00:28:54.991 --> 00:28:59.670
if you don't want to call them Judeo Christian values and American values so the

498
00:28:59.671 --> 00:29:03.120
rest of the world can experience the freedom that we have.

499
00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:08.940
The previous generation was willing to cross oceans and go die over there to

500
00:29:08.941 --> 00:29:12.540
protect the same freedoms that we have here at home and give them to other

501
00:29:12.541 --> 00:29:13.374
people.

502
00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:18.440
The least we can do is activate here and our home in the United States of

503
00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:25.340
America and come together and stand together and face those naysayers and those

504
00:29:26.701 --> 00:29:31.410
who slap labels on us,
at least they're not shooting bullets at us.
All they all,

505
00:29:31.411 --> 00:29:36.270
they're saying he's a racist or she's a racist or she's a white supremacist,

506
00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:41.230
but we can come together to save our country together.
And that's the beauty.

507
00:29:41.231 --> 00:29:44.320
It's people like you and I coming together and looking into each other's eyes

508
00:29:44.321 --> 00:29:47.530
and really being so excited to see each other again.

509
00:29:47.531 --> 00:29:51.040
And we together again as Americans,
as different as we are.

510
00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:55.210
But we come together and we love each other and respect for each other does to

511
00:29:55.211 --> 00:29:57.790
save this country.
And that's what America is all about.

512
00:29:57.820 --> 00:30:00.130
I encourage people to rise,

513
00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:04.750
rise in defense of Judeo Christian values and freedom.
Get the book,
read it,

514
00:30:04.930 --> 00:30:08.470
share it with their friends,
get multiple copies,
put them in public libraries.

515
00:30:08.471 --> 00:30:13.270
We need to educate and go to act for America.
That Org,
by the way,

516
00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:17.950
we named the organization,
act for America,
not think about America now,

517
00:30:17.970 --> 00:30:21.610
which for America now pray for America.
You can do all that,

518
00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:24.310
but without acting,
nothing happens.

519
00:30:24.650 --> 00:30:28.660
<v 1>You are the real deal.
Bridgette.
Uh,
thank you,
my friend.</v>

520
00:30:28.661 --> 00:30:31.280
I love you are the racist bigot of the day.

521
00:30:31.281 --> 00:30:35.090
Then I will gladly be thrown in that bucket with you.
Uh,

522
00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:37.580
you in case people don't know,
guys,

523
00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.530
the link to rise is right down below and buy it and put it in libraries and all

524
00:30:42.531 --> 00:30:43.350
that

525
00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:48.030
<v 2>to help us more on Bridgette.
And you can follow her on Twitter.
It's act.</v>

526
00:30:48.270 --> 00:30:49.103
Bridgette

527
00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:53.010
<v 0>[inaudible].</v>
