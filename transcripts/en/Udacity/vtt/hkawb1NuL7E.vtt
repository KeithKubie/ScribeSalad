Now that you have a chatter feed, let's talk

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:05.540
about publisher actions. Publisher actions allow you to do

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.260
things directly in the feed. There are four general

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.810
types of actions. Create Actions let users create records.

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:16.700
Log a Call actions let users record the details

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.141
of phone calls or other customer interactions. Update actions

00:00:20.141 --> 00:00:22.540
let users make changes to a record from the

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.490
records feed. Custom actions allow you to create your

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.240
own actions programatically, but we won't cover these here. Be

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.570
careful about creating too many actions. You really want to just

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.420
have the ones that you do most frequently. For example,

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.910
which of the following tasks would be good publisher actions?
