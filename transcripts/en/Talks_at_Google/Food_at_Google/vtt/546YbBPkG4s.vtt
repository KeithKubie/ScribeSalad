[CLAPPING]

00:00:07.996 --> 00:00:09.120
SCOTT: And take it away.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.120
ERIN GLEESON: Thank you.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.880
Thank you, Scott, and thank you
everybody for taking time out

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:13.870
of your day to come.

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:15.830
I really appreciate it.

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.600
So if you can see a screen
from where you're sitting,

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.370
my talk goes along
with a slideshow.

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:27.195
So I'm going to take it back
a second to the beginning.

00:00:27.195 --> 00:00:28.570
I grew up in
northern California.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.612
I grew up in Sonoma County
just a couple of hours

00:00:30.612 --> 00:00:31.760
north of here.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.060
And I grew up out
in an apple orchard.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.730
And it was a pretty
bucolic setting.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.470
My parents had a big
vegetable garden.

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.780
We cooked with vegetables
and fruits a lot.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.050
We were actually vegan
for most of my growing up.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:44.920
I'm not anymore.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.790
But that was the basis of
my learning how to cook

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:51.670
and what I was exposed
to, which has definitely

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.050
informed what I'm doing today.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.700
So as a kid, I was really
into photography and painting.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.630
I took a watercolor
painting classes

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.000
from the time I
was five years old.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.470
And then I always had one
of those disposable cameras

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:09.680
that I took around with me.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.950
And I was taking photos
and setting up my cousins

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.280
for photo shoots in the
backyard and in the orchard.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.140
And those two elements
have really come together

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.550
in my recent work.

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.477
So for college, I
studied art and I

00:01:25.477 --> 00:01:27.560
come from a family that's
very supportive of that.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.595
So my parents were like,
great, be an art major.

00:01:29.595 --> 00:01:31.720
Not sure what you're going
to do next, but awesome,

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.100
we support you.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.653
And then after that, I
graduated from college,

00:01:35.653 --> 00:01:37.570
I decided that I was
going to move to New York

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.540
to become a photographer.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.770
And I didn't really
know what that meant.

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.270
But I knew I loved
photography and I

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.890
knew all the
magazines were there,

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.860
and so I just thought I'd go
and try it, maybe for a year.

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.860
But it ended up being
about nine years.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.117
So during that time,
I worked at a magazine

00:01:55.117 --> 00:01:57.700
and a photo department and for
several different photographers

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.230
in their studios.

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:01.150
And I also babysat and
worked at a restaurant

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:02.817
and walked dogs and
did a million things

00:02:02.817 --> 00:02:06.303
to try and kind of be
an artist in New York.

00:02:06.303 --> 00:02:07.720
And then finally,
I decided that I

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.400
was going to go back
to school because I

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.112
wanted to teach photography.

00:02:11.112 --> 00:02:12.820
And so, that takes me
to this first slide

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:17.440
which is two different photos
that I took in grad school.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.940
I went to school visual arts
and I did an MFA in photography.

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.597
And they sort of said
in the beginning,

00:02:24.597 --> 00:02:26.680
go out and take photos of
whatever you're drawn to

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.097
and then bring
them back and we'll

00:02:28.097 --> 00:02:30.760
see what your focus might be.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.310
And I just kept seeing
myself taking photos of food.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.580
It was just all these
colors and textures.

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.840
And I was just so drawn
to food in general.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.750
But because I was
vegetarian, I ended up

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.810
shooting a lot of desserts,
because they're colorful,

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.720
they're vegetarian, they're
delightful to shoot,

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.720
they have all the texture.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.940
But I wasn't really
satisfied with just

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.570
taking a photo of them like on
a table or on a white backdrop.

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:01.820
So I started playing around
with these other elements.

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.737
So this photo right
here-- or these two photos

00:03:03.737 --> 00:03:06.760
are pages that I took
out of magazines.

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.660
And I propped them in the
back of Data Studio setup.

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.970
And I was trying to create
this little fantastical world

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:13.875
for a desert.

00:03:13.875 --> 00:03:15.250
And I wanted them
to be funny and

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.700
silly and colorful and playful.

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.550
So this is just the early
days of my photography.

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.640
And I think it's actually very
similar to what I'm doing now.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.070
There's a lot in
the middle though.

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:29.980
So here's a few more
of those desert shots.

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.570
You can see there's different
pages from magazines

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.370
in the backdrop,
sort of pretending

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.730
as if these deserts are
placed in an old palace

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.820
or in a grand ballroom.

00:03:42.283 --> 00:03:44.450
So these are examples of
two different photographers

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.300
that I was really
influenced by at this time.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.340
The one on the right,
the watermelon--

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:54.530
sorry, on your left,
is by Irving Penn

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.090
who is a famous photographer.

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.240
He shot a lot for "Vogue,"
he did a lot of fashion,

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.470
but also a lot of still life.

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:07.930
And his images are very much
setup, very purposefully styled

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.220
and put together.

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.620
So that watermelon is
perfectly placed there

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.462
with that bread
in the foreground

00:04:14.462 --> 00:04:15.920
and those grapes
in the background.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.860
And that was his setup
shot versus the other shot

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:21.445
is by Martin Parr.

00:04:21.445 --> 00:04:23.570
And he's a photographer
who is still working today.

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:24.695
And he's a photojournalist.

00:04:24.695 --> 00:04:27.380
So very different way of
thinking about photography.

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.950
Roaming around maybe
at the farmer's market

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:35.390
or at a restaurant or wherever
you happen to see food

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:37.460
and just trying to
snap a quick photo

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.400
and hope you catch
that magical moment.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.040
So I was somewhere in between
these two worlds of thought.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.650
Like I loved being out
at the farmer's market

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.460
and getting some
great shot of a girl

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.830
in a red dress behind
the red apples and think,

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.030
oh, I caught that moment.

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.820
You know, that was satisfying.

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.040
But also, I really
enjoyed the styling

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.690
and the setup of the photo.

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:01.670
So through grad
school, I was sort

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:06.150
of playing with those two
sides of my interests.

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.240
This was my thesis project
when I was in grad school.

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.920
And I had read an
article about this chef,

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.712
his name was Will Goldfarb.

00:05:15.712 --> 00:05:16.920
Has anyone ever heard of him?

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.530
He has a couple of cookbooks
out, he's still working.

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:22.880
So I read this article
about him and he

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.140
made these amazing desserts
that I was totally inspired by.

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:29.630
And I thought I have to go
to this guy's restaurant.

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:32.510
So I went down to Soho
and I just got a seat

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:33.960
at the bar one night by myself.

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.202
And he was behind the bar.

00:05:35.202 --> 00:05:36.410
And I started talking to him.

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:39.572
And I'm very shy, this was
like not in my comfort zone.

00:05:39.572 --> 00:05:41.030
But I was like
really drawn to what

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:44.120
he was doing with food,
and colors, and ideas,

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.760
and translating that all
in the kitchen space.

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.495
And so I asked him
pretty bluntly,

00:05:49.495 --> 00:05:50.870
I said I'm a
photography student,

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:53.520
I'm looking to photograph some
really interesting desserts,

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.740
would you be open to
letting me photograph

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:58.700
what you've made here.

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:02.570
And he was really receptive and
so nice and invited me to come.

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:06.110
And I spent months going
into the restaurant

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:08.780
and photographing his creations.

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:13.440
So my final project was
in the form of a book.

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.180
And it was two images
next to each other.

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:18.470
So the one on the
right is his creation.

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:21.860
And then I use all the
ingredients from that dish

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:25.795
and did my own sort of collage
interpretation of that dish.

00:06:25.795 --> 00:06:27.170
So those are the
ingredients that

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:31.980
go into that dish in a sort
of abstract presentation.

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:33.230
Here's a couple more of those.

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:40.980
So again, this one, the
citrus and the vanilla,

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:43.810
and the berries, they
all go into that dessert

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:46.150
that he created
that's on the right.

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:47.890
But this is sort
of the early signs

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:51.010
of my interest in diptychs,
two images that really work

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:57.130
together to tell a story about
food and breaking down a recipe

00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:59.590
and thinking about it--
not only in terms of ideas,

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:01.780
but in terms of color,
and form, and shape,

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:04.990
and thinking of it in a very
graphic way that's tangible,

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:05.687
right?

00:07:05.687 --> 00:07:07.270
You order that dessert
in a restaurant

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:08.890
and unless you read
the menu description,

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:10.848
you have no idea what's
really in there, right?

00:07:10.848 --> 00:07:13.450
So I love the idea of
breaking it down in image form

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:15.160
to see what went into it.

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:19.580
So also around that
time I was doing

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:23.000
a lot of photo journalistic
work in restaurants

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.280
and shooting chefs.

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.500
And, again, it's
that idea of catching

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:31.130
and getting lucky in the
moment and catching the photo.

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.480
This was a more setup shot
that I did in a restaurant,

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.250
just with a piece
of black Velvet

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:46.240
in a window in a dining room
using some very small flashes

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.770
that I had brought with me.

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:50.140
And I was really
drawn to the colors

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:53.020
and the graphic notion of
these shapes and forms working

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:55.510
together to show
what I was hoping

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:58.535
would be a more interesting
display of a charcuterie plate.

00:07:58.535 --> 00:08:00.160
But, of course, it's
the chef's plating

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:04.690
and his idea that went into
the way that dish looks.

00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:09.798
But I was trying to really
capture the essence of it.

00:08:09.798 --> 00:08:11.340
During that time,
I was also shooting

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:13.470
a lot of photojournalist
type work

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:16.320
as a volunteer photographer
at the James Beard Foundation.

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:18.700
And I would go, maybe,
one night a month

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:21.060
and they would have a
volunteer photographer

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:23.760
in the kitchen with all these
amazing and famous chefs

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:25.202
that would come through.

00:08:25.202 --> 00:08:26.910
And I would get to be
right next to them.

00:08:26.910 --> 00:08:30.510
It was so small, like much
smaller than this kitchen.

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:33.880
It was actually the
apartment of James Beard,

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:36.750
he was a contemporary
of Julia Child.

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:39.900
And his home was turned
into a foundation and also

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:43.650
a very interesting dining space
if you're ever in New York.

00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:47.760
But anyway, that was a good way
for me to build my portfolio

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.710
and get exposure to a
lot of different chefs

00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:53.460
and types of food and connect
with chefs that I could then

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:54.960
go to their
restaurants in New York

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:58.520
and do some more photography.

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:03.800
This was my first magazine
cover of "Edible Manhattan,"

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:04.800
some soup in a window.

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:07.008
And, again, it's that kind
of photo journalistic type

00:09:07.008 --> 00:09:14.060
shot that is somewhat setup
but also photo journalistic.

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:16.730
And this was my first shot
in the "New York Times,"

00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:18.500
which was a big goal of mine.

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:22.280
This was in 2007 and I was
so excited to photograph

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:23.250
this restaurant.

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:26.810
And it ran in the
dining section.

00:09:26.810 --> 00:09:30.250
So when I finished grad
school, I started teaching.

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:32.730
So I had a degree in
photography and Photoshop

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:35.480
was my favorite
part of all of that.

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:37.840
And so I started teaching
digital photography

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:39.700
and Photoshop at
FIT, the Fashion

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:41.500
Institute of Technology.

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:44.620
And I was teaching photography
and also freelancing

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:47.110
as a food photographer,
mostly food photographer.

00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:48.693
I have some other
kinds of photography

00:09:48.693 --> 00:09:51.520
too during that time.

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:56.020
This was a restaurant shot
that I did as a freelancer.

00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:58.610
And if you'll take a look
at the style and lighting

00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:05.690
of these shots, black
backgrounds, white backgrounds,

00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:09.640
bright lighting, harsh shadows.

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:12.380
So I'll just fast
forward to what came

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:15.167
next is driving up Highway 84.

00:10:15.167 --> 00:10:17.000
I don't know if you
guys have ever driven up

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.958
to Skyline and Woodside,
it's only about a half

00:10:18.958 --> 00:10:19.760
an hour from here.

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:24.080
But my husband got a job
here about seven years ago

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:25.970
and we came out.

00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:27.800
We were living in
New York and came out

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:28.760
on a whirlwind weekend.

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:30.600
We didn't know where
we were going to live.

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:32.240
And we're just like looking
at all these different ads.

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:34.115
We thought we probably
live in Mountain View.

00:10:34.115 --> 00:10:35.970
And just by chance,
we found an ad

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:39.230
for this really cool
cabin up in Woodside.

00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:40.720
And as we're
driving this road, I

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:42.350
was like, there's no way
we're going to live up here.

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:43.490
This road is crazy.

00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:46.820
Can you imagine
driving this every day?

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:51.050
But once we got there, we
got a look at the view,

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:54.590
and we're like, OK, how
far is this to the office?

00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:56.840
Maybe the road isn't that bad.

00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:03.920
And it's like a total 180 from
living in Brooklyn, right?

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:08.180
To go to the woods, even if it
is technically Silicon Valley.

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:13.840
And as we were leaving,
they said, you know, there

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:16.130
is actually like a small
studio on the property

00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:18.463
that you could
use for your work.

00:11:18.463 --> 00:11:20.880
Because we were thinking, oh,
the cabin is a little small.

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:22.380
I don't know if it
will work for us.

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:24.380
And then the studio
part was like, oh, OK.

00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:25.640
This could really work.

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:31.290
I could see my work taking
a different turn here.

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:35.250
So there's something
about the light here

00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:37.030
that was very special.

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:39.475
So because we're so
close to the coast,

00:11:39.475 --> 00:11:41.100
there's a lot of fog
that's rolling in.

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:44.550
So I don't know if you can
see that fog rolling by,

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:47.610
but that's just sort of like the
view right out of the kitchen.

00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:52.000
And the deck is right there
in front of the kitchen.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.940
And if you study photography
and never used a soft box,

00:11:56.940 --> 00:12:00.940
having that soft light
is really hard to achieve

00:12:00.940 --> 00:12:04.770
and a really desirable type
of light for shooting food.

00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:07.950
So I thought, we have like
a lightbox in the sky here,

00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:09.220
this is amazing.

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:11.080
I don't even need
studio lights anymore.

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:12.370
I can just shoot outside.

00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:13.650
It's like all right here.

00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:14.830
The light is amazing.

00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:17.205
And then also just being so
close to the coast and being,

00:12:17.205 --> 00:12:19.560
maybe, California
everything was so golden.

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:22.530
The light was really golden,
which I love for photographing.

00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:24.170
SCOTT: While she
is advancing, I had

00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:25.510
a question about the lighting.

00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:27.600
So how much of a
lighting do you have

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:31.440
to do nowadays with
technology, the old school

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:34.965
way of setting up versus how
much can you do after the fact?

00:12:34.965 --> 00:12:36.340
ERIN GLEESON: Yeah
good question.

00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:38.548
SCOTT: And again, Google
Photos does a lot of great--

00:12:38.548 --> 00:12:41.130
and we used to work with
lighting apps in the back

00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:44.936
and it's much easier, but
is it a better result?

00:12:44.936 --> 00:12:45.730
ERIN GLEESON: Yeah.

00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:48.570
I mean, there's so much that
you can do now after the fact.

00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:51.602
You can really kind of
save yourself, which

00:12:51.602 --> 00:12:52.810
is good when you're learning.

00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:55.500
But I try to get as much
as I can into the shot.

00:12:55.500 --> 00:13:01.950
There's always a lot more color,
quality, and detail in the shot

00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:04.710
if you could just get it
right there in the camera.

00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:08.670
You can fix a lot
after the fact.

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:11.230
Even though I love
Photoshop, I don't use it

00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:16.520
so much to fix the photos
or retouch them that much.

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:18.270
It's usually just kind
of an overall color

00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:23.640
cast shift or adding a little
bit of contrast or cropping,

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:24.522
things like that.

00:13:24.522 --> 00:13:26.730
I'll show you how I use
Photoshop in a different more

00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:28.590
illustrative way also.

00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:32.160
But for shooting, I love
to get it in the shot

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:33.000
as much as I can.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:33.500
Yeah.

00:13:36.483 --> 00:13:37.650
So here's just another shot.

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:41.460
I started playing around
with cooking outside.

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:46.050
And we had just gotten this
membership to a CSA box,

00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:49.510
a community supported
agriculture farm box.

00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:51.787
Has anybody subscribed
to one of these?

00:13:51.787 --> 00:13:52.620
They're great, yeah.

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:54.270
So some of them
you can choose what

00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:56.640
you get each week, and some of
them you just kind of get a box

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:58.750
and you're not really sure
what's going to show up.

00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:01.125
And so we're getting this box,
and every week I thought--

00:14:01.125 --> 00:14:05.260
we actually got to choose eight
items each week of a limited

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:05.760
offering.

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:07.440
And I was always choosing
the most colorful things

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:09.600
that I thought would be
really fun to photograph.

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:14.820
And that was really the impetus
for the whole Forest Feast

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:15.660
Project.

00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:19.330
So I started out
thinking, OK, I'm going

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:20.880
to just start taking photos.

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:22.755
I've never worked with
chefs in the Bay Area.

00:14:22.755 --> 00:14:25.130
I'm going to just start cooking
some really simple things

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:27.990
myself to take photos of so
that I can make a new portfolio.

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:29.010
Because in the past,
I've always worked

00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:30.310
with chefs who had
made the dishes,

00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:31.477
and I would photograph them.

00:14:31.477 --> 00:14:33.658
But I thought I love
cooking, I grew up cooking,

00:14:33.658 --> 00:14:35.200
I can make some
really simple things,

00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:39.802
I'll keep it under five
ingredients, simple steps.

00:14:39.802 --> 00:14:42.010
And I didn't really know
where I was going with this,

00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:44.310
but I thought I'd start
a website or a blog.

00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:46.410
And I called it the
Forest Feast since we just

00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:49.170
moved to the forest and
I love alliteration.

00:14:49.170 --> 00:14:52.230
And I just started
posting photos.

00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:53.730
And the first couple
of photos, it's

00:14:53.730 --> 00:14:57.410
pretty clear that I didn't
know what I was doing yet.

00:14:57.410 --> 00:15:01.200
I was just really experimenting
with these local ingredients

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:02.640
and trying to figure it out.

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:05.610
And then one day, I was
getting sort of tired

00:15:05.610 --> 00:15:09.210
of photographing things
on the tablecloth or just

00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:11.700
on my wooden table.

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:14.910
And I had met with a couple
editors in San Francisco who

00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:19.050
said those black and white,
harsh, light, slick looking

00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:21.900
photos weren't really
the vibe they were going

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:24.720
for here for west
coast magazines

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:27.293
and maybe cookbooks
that were here

00:15:27.293 --> 00:15:29.460
that I was hoping to shoot
other people's cookbooks.

00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:31.440
And they said, we just
need a little bit more

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:32.360
of a natural vibe.

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:34.670
And I was so tired
of my wooden table.

00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:36.452
I thought, I'm just
going to walk outside.

00:15:36.452 --> 00:15:38.160
So one day, I had a
plate of acorn squash

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:40.740
that I had cooked that
had come in that CSA box.

00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:43.800
And I was just walking
around and I just

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:46.080
started putting the
plate down in the forest

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:47.910
like in our backyard.

00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:51.817
Looking for old stumps and
mossy logs and a pile of leaves.

00:15:51.817 --> 00:15:54.150
I was trying to bring in kind
of like a natural element,

00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:57.780
but also different colors
and textures and shapes that

00:15:57.780 --> 00:16:03.600
might give it a different look.

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:07.740
This is an early version
of my Forest Feast website.

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:09.200
And I just treated it as a blog.

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:11.310
I was sharing recipes,
but I got bored

00:16:11.310 --> 00:16:12.960
by just typing out the recipe.

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:14.910
And I thought, I could
show this visually.

00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:17.790
Maybe I should make a diagram
and show the ingredients,

00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:20.563
sort of like I had been
doing with my cookbook

00:16:20.563 --> 00:16:22.980
that I did in grad school,
sort of showing the pieces that

00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:24.600
go into the final dish.

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:27.713
I thought we're so saturated
with recipes online,

00:16:27.713 --> 00:16:29.880
especially if you want to
make something for dinner.

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:31.713
You just want to scroll
through and be like,

00:16:31.713 --> 00:16:33.420
I have that in my fridge.

00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:34.420
I think I can make that.

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:36.878
And if you see a photo of it
rather than reading through it

00:16:36.878 --> 00:16:39.210
all, it might be more
immediate and also

00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:40.470
more interesting to look at.

00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:44.970
And I was also just
inspired by my space,

00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:48.750
being in this cabin, a
different environment.

00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:51.900
I was worried that
my biggest career

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:54.660
accomplishments might have
been behind me in New York.

00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:58.050
It was hard to leave so many
years of building a photography

00:16:58.050 --> 00:17:00.630
business in New York, and
then just leave and think

00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:01.610
what's next?

00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:05.770
But I was pretty inspired
by this new space.

00:17:05.770 --> 00:17:08.670
So this was the first
photo that was my "aha"

00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:11.250
moment on my Forest Feast blog.

00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:12.618
And it's that acorn squash.

00:17:12.618 --> 00:17:14.160
And I was wandering
around putting it

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:16.390
on all these different surfaces.

00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:18.073
And there had been
this tree that died.

00:17:18.073 --> 00:17:18.990
And they took it down.

00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:23.609
And I just set the cutting
board down on that tree

00:17:23.609 --> 00:17:29.100
and I thought, all the colors
and the shapes of that log

00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:31.770
really are mimicking the
shapes and colors and textures

00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:33.090
of that acorn squash.

00:17:33.090 --> 00:17:35.610
And this is so much more
interesting than my dining room

00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:36.510
table.

00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:40.290
And so, I think that was maybe
my third post on my blog.

00:17:40.290 --> 00:17:42.762
And the first couple were
just like, "A bowl of fruit."

00:17:42.762 --> 00:17:44.720
But this is the first
one where I was like, OK,

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:47.520
maybe this is a good
direction to try and explore.

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:49.673
So I started doing a
bunch more like this.

00:17:49.673 --> 00:17:51.090
And instead of
just typing it out,

00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:53.550
I made a photo of
the ingredients

00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:54.990
that went into the dish.

00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:57.720
And I popped that into Photoshop
and I added my handwriting

00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:01.590
on top because I couldn't
find a font that I loved.

00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:03.630
And I added just a little
bit of typewriter font

00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:06.390
to fill in some details.

00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:09.720
And then I put the two
together to make that diptych.

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:12.990
Like I said, I had always kind
of thought in diptych form.

00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:15.300
I loved these two images
that work together.

00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:17.760
And they seemed to
lend themselves well

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:20.950
to a website or a blog.

00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:23.970
So these are a few more
examples of some of the photos.

00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:27.150
So, again, this is a
garlicy kale Caesar salad

00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:29.400
with polenta croutons.

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:36.670
And I thought that mossy
log worked well with it.

00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:39.433
So here's the recipe
page for that salad.

00:18:39.433 --> 00:18:41.100
So I used an old book
because I'm always

00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:44.880
looking for some sort of either
very dark or very light surface

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:47.190
to add the text on
top of in my shot.

00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:50.320
So I put a little piece of
watercolor paper at the top.

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:53.480
And remember, I had always loved
watercolor painting, right?

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:55.860
But I always saw it as a hobby,
painting little postcards

00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:56.985
and mailing them to people.

00:18:56.985 --> 00:19:00.210
And I always thought as
a professional artist,

00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:01.950
you should probably
choose one medium.

00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:04.410
I chose photography so I'm
going to stick with that.

00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:07.080
But I never really
thought about calling

00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:09.870
myself an Illustrator
or a painter,

00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:11.040
but I thought you know what?

00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:11.960
We just moved to the woods.

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:13.080
I don't know what I'm
doing with my life

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:14.460
and I'm going to start
putting my paintings right

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:16.300
on top of my photos
and see what happens.

00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:17.130
It was fun.

00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:18.750
But I started to
post them online

00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:20.460
and people really
kind of responded

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:24.160
to that illustrative
component of it.

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:27.870
So you can see in Photoshop
I layered in the kale Caesar

00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:28.563
painted font.

00:19:28.563 --> 00:19:30.480
So I just painted that
on paper and scanned it

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:32.670
and then put it in
using Photoshop,

00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:34.920
along with all my handwriting.

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:37.230
And then again that
diptych, so the two images

00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:39.033
working together.

00:19:39.033 --> 00:19:41.450
So here's just an example of
a few of my little watercolor

00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:46.297
paintings, which you'll
see I'm wearing today.

00:19:46.297 --> 00:19:47.630
I made it into some clothes too.

00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:50.165
I'm wearing the book
to the book talk.

00:19:50.165 --> 00:19:52.720
Here's a couple more
examples of recipes

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:53.720
that I was working with.

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:55.940
So something that I
was really drawn to

00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:59.330
and, I think, in part by
my art school training,

00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:03.060
I was also studying sculpture
when I was in school.

00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:05.550
So I was trying to
think of these plates

00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:06.470
as little sculptures.

00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:08.345
And I feel like that's
the way Will Goldfarb,

00:20:08.345 --> 00:20:13.040
the chef that I had
photographed the dishes of,

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:14.750
I imagine that he
thought of his plates

00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:18.710
as a little sculpture
or little pieces of art.

00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:21.185
So thinking about the
dish more structurally,

00:20:21.185 --> 00:20:23.060
I thought maybe there's
more interesting ways

00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:24.650
that I can cut things
and layer things

00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:30.687
and think about different shapes
and textures and colors going

00:20:30.687 --> 00:20:33.020
together for a dish, not only
for the way it might taste

00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:34.850
but for the way I might look
when you're presenting it,

00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:34.880
right?

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:36.213
It doesn't have to be that hard.

00:20:36.213 --> 00:20:39.740
You don't have to be a
traditionally trained chef

00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:42.190
to be able to make a
beautiful dish, I think.

00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:44.750
And I have not gone to
culinary school, by the way.

00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:46.010
Remember.

00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:52.260
I make very simple recipes
and I'm inspired by color.

00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:55.130
So this dish, I
chopped the watermelon

00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:56.360
into big round slices.

00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:58.460
And then I just
removed the rind.

00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:01.610
And then used the whole
watermelon slab as the basis

00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:02.510
for this dish.

00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:04.040
So you could use
a large watermelon

00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:06.860
and cut it into pie
pieces and share it,

00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:08.540
or you can use those
many watermelons

00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:11.170
and just make a single
one for each person.

00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:13.760
But it's a fun and maybe
slightly different presentation

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:17.620
than you may have seen
before inspired by a very

00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:22.130
traditional summer salad,
which is watermelon

00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:24.440
with some sort of cheese
and herb, usually feta.

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:29.240
But I tossed in some mozzarella,
fresh mozzarella slices

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:32.010
because I like the
round shape that mimiced

00:21:32.010 --> 00:21:35.660
the round shape of the melon.

00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:39.790
And then I was also playing
around with different styling,

00:21:39.790 --> 00:21:42.060
just trying to take
things off the plate.

00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:44.840
So in my photography, I
was shooting this right

00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:45.680
before Thanksgiving.

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:47.790
And there's all these beautiful
fall leaves on the ground.

00:21:47.790 --> 00:21:49.455
And I thought, I
can't find a plate

00:21:49.455 --> 00:21:51.080
that I like really
that much for these.

00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:53.450
They're white, they don't
look good on a white plate.

00:21:53.450 --> 00:21:55.617
I'm just going to try one
of those leaves out there.

00:21:55.617 --> 00:21:58.250
So technically, you could
serve it like that if you

00:21:58.250 --> 00:21:59.570
found some sort of edible leaf.

00:21:59.570 --> 00:22:01.580
But it worked well
for the photo.

00:22:04.127 --> 00:22:05.210
Here's some apricot bites.

00:22:05.210 --> 00:22:06.560
Again, just thinking
about different colors

00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:07.710
that go really well together.

00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:09.350
So the orange and
the red and the green

00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:12.290
all playing off of each
other, but also super simple.

00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:20.660
So about six months into having
this blog online is on Tumblr,

00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:22.750
it started to really
gain some traction

00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:25.360
and I started getting
people reposting

00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:28.063
my recipes on their blogs and
giving comments on my blog.

00:22:28.063 --> 00:22:30.230
And I was like, oh my
goodness, this is so exciting.

00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:33.400
I didn't expect anybody to
see this except for the editor

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:34.660
that I might send a link to.

00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:36.910
And I really didn't know
anything about food blogging.

00:22:36.910 --> 00:22:41.690
I didn't even really follow
food blogs that closely.

00:22:41.690 --> 00:22:44.830
But about six months
into it, a literary agent

00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:46.630
reached out, somebody
from New York.

00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:49.280
And she said, I saw
your blog online.

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:51.315
And I think you should
turn it into a book.

00:22:51.315 --> 00:22:52.902
And I said, are you sure?

00:22:52.902 --> 00:22:54.360
I don't know if
I'm ready for that.

00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:55.930
And she said, no, you're ready.

00:22:55.930 --> 00:22:58.660
Look at your images
right next to each other.

00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:00.857
Those diptychs, those
two vertical images

00:23:00.857 --> 00:23:03.190
right next to each other,
they lend themselves perfectly

00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:04.280
to the pages of a book.

00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:05.680
Like it's already a book.

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:06.947
Let's turn it into one.

00:23:06.947 --> 00:23:08.530
And I really loved
some of the clients

00:23:08.530 --> 00:23:10.540
that she had worked with
before who are bloggers

00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:12.800
turned cookbook authors.

00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:15.290
So I said, OK, let's do it.

00:23:15.290 --> 00:23:16.840
So she's been amazing.

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:21.640
And so about within
a year of that--

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:25.060
I guess about maybe six months
after that, I got a book deal.

00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:27.640
And then it took about a year
to create my first book, which

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:30.495
is called "The Forest Feast."

00:23:30.495 --> 00:23:31.120
And here it is.

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:34.180
So just all vegetarian
recipes and completely

00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:39.060
inspired by living in the woods.

00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:42.630
Here's a behind the scenes
shot of my cover shoot.

00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:48.840
It's basically just a piece of
plywood and a kitchen chair.

00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:51.480
And I'm standing on that chair
totally hand-held, no tripod

00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:54.210
or anything, all natural light.

00:23:54.210 --> 00:23:59.668
And my editor was on the
cell phone in New York.

00:23:59.668 --> 00:24:01.460
I'm always shooting in
that late in the day

00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:09.390
time, about 4:30 or so, when
that golden hour kind of light

00:24:09.390 --> 00:24:10.990
comes in.

00:24:10.990 --> 00:24:13.040
So for her it was
7:30 at night, so she

00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:14.220
was at home with her kids.

00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:16.410
And I'm taking pictures
and texting them to her

00:24:16.410 --> 00:24:19.170
and she's like move the
tomato over a little bit

00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:21.710
and pull that plate
down over there.

00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:23.460
So a little bit of
trial and error, and we

00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:26.350
got the cover shot.

00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:29.250
That was during the cover shot.

00:24:29.250 --> 00:24:32.403
But this is a one woman show.

00:24:32.403 --> 00:24:33.445
It is me in the backyard.

00:24:36.277 --> 00:24:37.360
And there's the end pages.

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:39.068
We decided to use all
those illustrations

00:24:39.068 --> 00:24:40.440
as the end pages for the book.

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:44.100
Again, the dress.

00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:46.650
So here's a few photos
that are from that book.

00:24:46.650 --> 00:24:51.510
And I just thought I'd explain
the Photoshop use in the recipe

00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:52.560
side.

00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:56.430
That was just a big empty
white piece of handmade paper

00:24:56.430 --> 00:24:58.200
that I bought at
the paper store.

00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:01.732
I tacked it up on the
fence with the thought

00:25:01.732 --> 00:25:02.940
that that would be the title.

00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:04.732
So I was always trying
to in the real world

00:25:04.732 --> 00:25:07.320
trying to think about, OK,
I'm looking at this shot.

00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:09.090
Where is the title going to go?

00:25:09.090 --> 00:25:10.590
Where is my handwriting
going to go?

00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:14.070
I'm always trying to leave
room for arrows and text

00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:17.300
while I'm shooting.

00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:19.440
Here's the bay potatoes.

00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:21.377
I picked some bay out back.

00:25:21.377 --> 00:25:23.210
And, again, trying to
think of those colors,

00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:27.710
I think layering potatoes
like that in a pan

00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:29.210
has certainly been done so much.

00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:31.400
And I was just trying
to mix up the colors

00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:35.085
a little bit by adding some
sweet potato and red onion.

00:25:35.085 --> 00:25:36.710
There are some stuffed
tomatoes, trying

00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:39.380
to think about different
ways to cut the tomatoes

00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:41.750
and create vessels out of
different types of vegetables

00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:45.200
to create an interesting
presentation.

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:47.270
It's also vegetarian
and colorful and easy.

00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:55.160
And then I also for the book
did some more illustrated kind

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:59.090
of sauce and
dressing type recipes

00:25:59.090 --> 00:26:00.560
that were all illustrated.

00:26:03.770 --> 00:26:05.660
I'm a visual learner,
but I find it easier

00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:07.985
to look at the picture
of all the ingredients

00:26:07.985 --> 00:26:09.860
and have a sense of how
to make a dish rather

00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:14.400
than reading a lot of
steps or a lot of text.

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:18.070
Here's a couple of cutting
techniques that I drew out.

00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:23.250
And, again, this page is
totally made in Photoshop.

00:26:23.250 --> 00:26:30.050
So that brought me to
our first baby, Ezra.

00:26:30.050 --> 00:26:33.980
So I was pregnant with
him on the book tour

00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:34.790
for the first book.

00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:36.530
And soon after, he was born.

00:26:36.530 --> 00:26:39.420
And soon after that, my
editors reached out and said,

00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:41.915
we think you should
adapt your book for kids.

00:26:41.915 --> 00:26:44.067
It's so visual, it already
makes sense for kids

00:26:44.067 --> 00:26:46.400
to be able to look at these
pictures and make something.

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:48.908
So we took 20 recipes
out of the first book

00:26:48.908 --> 00:26:51.200
and I created 20 new ones
and we made the "Forest Feast

00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:55.190
For Kids," and that
came out in 2016.

00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:57.620
I had some kids over,
friends that we knew,

00:26:57.620 --> 00:26:59.630
and they helped me
cook on the deck.

00:26:59.630 --> 00:27:00.410
We did a workshop.

00:27:00.410 --> 00:27:03.200
And they gave me some really
useful feedback, actually.

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:05.930
This one little boy said
that he needed more examples

00:27:05.930 --> 00:27:08.190
of how to cut things.

00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:09.690
He was interested
in cutting things.

00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:11.360
So there was a whole--

00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:13.970
I think I included it in here.

00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:17.070
Yes, this was the cutting
techniques, inspired by Jacob.

00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:23.300
He said just knowing which way
to start and if you peel first

00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:24.400
or after.

00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:26.870
And so I thought, how could
I show that really visually

00:27:26.870 --> 00:27:30.020
and make it easy, not
only for me, but for kids?

00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:33.180
So it's aimed at kids who
are 8 to 12 years old.

00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:35.630
Here's a couple more
photos from that book.

00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:38.790
So it could be a carrot salad
or it could be a rainbow carrot

00:27:38.790 --> 00:27:39.290
salad.

00:27:39.290 --> 00:27:42.830
We're lucky in California to
have such colorful produce

00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:44.463
that's pretty accessible.

00:27:44.463 --> 00:27:46.880
I know right now we're getting
rainbow carrots in our farm

00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:50.450
box, like this week.

00:27:50.450 --> 00:27:53.030
So here's an example of
how I set up that shot.

00:27:53.030 --> 00:27:55.760
Again, thinking about a
high or low contrast item

00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:57.530
to have the text
to go over, which

00:27:57.530 --> 00:28:01.220
is that white piece of canvas,
layering the ingredients

00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:03.740
on top, and then
individually painting

00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:09.560
different elements that
would add to the diagram

00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:11.130
effect of the recipe.

00:28:11.130 --> 00:28:13.880
A little bit of handwriting
and a little bit

00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:16.510
of typewriter text.

00:28:16.510 --> 00:28:19.080
Here's a peanut
butter avocado shake,

00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:21.472
trying to get those
greens in the kids.

00:28:21.472 --> 00:28:22.180
We have two kids.

00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:25.920
So now I know how hard it is
to get them to eat vegetables.

00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:28.650
So then soon after that--

00:28:28.650 --> 00:28:31.380
we love having people
over and I feel

00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:35.340
like everything that went
into creating my first book

00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:38.190
was very much
entertaining inspired.

00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:39.965
So it felt like a
natural next step

00:28:39.965 --> 00:28:41.340
to do an entertaining
book, which

00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:43.507
is the "Forest Feast
Gatherings," which you guys all

00:28:43.507 --> 00:28:44.938
have in front of you.

00:28:44.938 --> 00:28:46.980
And that really started
with these dinner parties

00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:49.530
on our deck where I was
experimenting, making dishes,

00:28:49.530 --> 00:28:51.600
or having shoot days where
I made tons of dishes

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:55.890
and needed friends to come over
and help us eat everything.

00:28:55.890 --> 00:29:00.050
But eating outside I feel like
always makes everything better.

00:29:00.050 --> 00:29:04.800
So ideas for outdoor
entertaining and hosting.

00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:07.420
Everything in this book
is laid out in menus.

00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:09.460
So if you're hosting
a summer dinner party,

00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:11.658
here's like five or six
things that you could make.

00:29:11.658 --> 00:29:13.200
And if you don't
have that much time,

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:15.910
just make these three of
them and buy these things.

00:29:15.910 --> 00:29:17.460
And so sort of
hosting tips to make

00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:21.060
it easier because I think it
can be hard to entertain, right?

00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:23.602
It's intimidating to
think, oh my gosh,

00:29:23.602 --> 00:29:25.060
people are coming
over to my house.

00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:26.840
I have to clean it, I have
to get everything ready,

00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:29.257
there's so much prep, I have
to start buying the groceries

00:29:29.257 --> 00:29:31.740
days in advance, I have to
take the afternoon off work

00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:33.400
to make it all happen.

00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:36.210
And I don't think you have to.

00:29:36.210 --> 00:29:40.020
So I was trying to give lots
of really practical ideas

00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:43.020
for how you could have people
over and connect with people

00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:47.640
over good plant based food
and not stress yourself out

00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:49.302
too much.

00:29:49.302 --> 00:29:50.385
So here's the brunch menu.

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:54.998
It's a holiday
cocktail party menu

00:29:54.998 --> 00:29:56.540
and I have some
little DIYs in there,

00:29:56.540 --> 00:29:58.590
like how to make that
little floral garland

00:29:58.590 --> 00:29:59.340
that you can hang.

00:30:01.612 --> 00:30:03.320
This is an example of
one of the spreads.

00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:07.430
I feel like this book is,
to me, artistically kind

00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:11.120
of an evolution
of my first book.

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:14.300
There's a lot more art
and painting and kind

00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:17.718
of like a floral
styling that's in the--

00:30:17.718 --> 00:30:18.510
yeah, there you go.

00:30:18.510 --> 00:30:21.680
You have the page
open right there.

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:25.140
There's a lot more of an
artistic element to it,

00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:25.810
I think.

00:30:25.810 --> 00:30:29.630
It evolved even more
from the first book.

00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:33.330
And I even included a little
painting, a cabin painting.

00:30:33.330 --> 00:30:34.830
And for the contents
page, you can

00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:39.030
see I just pulled like mossy
sticks and leaves and things

00:30:39.030 --> 00:30:41.910
on the side and layered
those on the edges,

00:30:41.910 --> 00:30:46.360
just to make the page just a
little bit more interesting.

00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:49.790
Here's me cooking in
our little kitchen.

00:30:49.790 --> 00:30:52.670
And there's an aerial view at
the bottom of the left hand

00:30:52.670 --> 00:30:55.880
page of where we live.

00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:59.420
Even though it's only
about 35 minutes from here,

00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:01.080
it's pretty densely wooded.

00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:05.780
Here's one of the
recipes from the book,

00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:08.060
zaatar roasted carrots.

00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:13.040
I'm always trying to find
interesting elements of a dish

00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:14.790
that maybe you don't
have in your kitchen,

00:31:14.790 --> 00:31:16.710
but are pretty
readily available.

00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:19.700
So zaatar is a
great spice blend.

00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:21.440
Has anyone cooked
with zaatar before?

00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:22.970
Yeah, it's good, right?

00:31:22.970 --> 00:31:25.080
It's a blend of a few
different herbs and spices.

00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:29.240
And anyway, I can find it at
my local grocery store often.

00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:34.520
If I'm at Safeway or Whole
Foods or one of my local grocery

00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:37.532
stores, if I can't find a
certain ingredient I think,

00:31:37.532 --> 00:31:38.990
OK, other people
aren't going to be

00:31:38.990 --> 00:31:41.323
able to find that either so
I'm not going to include it.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:44.410
Here's a roasted
a eggplant salad

00:31:44.410 --> 00:31:48.820
using some edible nastirtium
flowers, which we actually have

00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:50.980
from the Google garden today.

00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:51.970
They're so beautiful.

00:31:54.798 --> 00:31:55.840
Here's a rice noodle bar.

00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:57.833
So a lot of my
thinking also, which

00:31:57.833 --> 00:32:00.000
is what you'll see that
we're going to sample later,

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.810
is so often we have
friends over for dinner

00:32:03.810 --> 00:32:06.690
and people have different
dietary restrictions

00:32:06.690 --> 00:32:07.650
or preferences.

00:32:07.650 --> 00:32:10.350
And I wanted to give
some options for things

00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:13.930
that you could serve that could
work for any number of things.

00:32:13.930 --> 00:32:17.640
So the rice noodle bar
is gluten free and vegan,

00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:18.690
which is a good one.

00:32:18.690 --> 00:32:20.850
We're going to have
the polenta bar here

00:32:20.850 --> 00:32:23.580
today and also the endive bar.

00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:26.565
Those are all vegan
and gluten free.

00:32:26.565 --> 00:32:31.980
I also has some fun DIY things,
like floral arranging in here

00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:32.530
in the book.

00:32:32.530 --> 00:32:34.110
So this is a small
floral arrangement

00:32:34.110 --> 00:32:37.680
that you can make just using
scotch tape and a bowl.

00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:41.850
Here's one more shot of the
deck and just sitting outside.

00:32:41.850 --> 00:32:45.780
This is a shot, if you don't
mind playing the video,

00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:46.730
of that aerial shot.

00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:48.870
So a friend with
a drone came over

00:32:48.870 --> 00:32:53.490
and took this view off
the deck just to give

00:32:53.490 --> 00:32:55.470
a sense of where we are.

00:32:55.470 --> 00:32:59.250
Deep in the woods, but as we're
looking out, we're looking west

00:32:59.250 --> 00:33:02.910
and that's like Pescadero,
Half Moon Bay area out there.

00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:08.610
And yeah, it's just
such a beautiful area.

00:33:08.610 --> 00:33:11.717
And it's been so inspiring
to me in so many ways

00:33:11.717 --> 00:33:12.550
being in California.

00:33:12.550 --> 00:33:14.700
And being surrounded
by trees I think

00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:16.620
changes your energy somehow.

00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:19.650
For me, it was very
quieting to leave the city

00:33:19.650 --> 00:33:23.626
and be suddenly in a very
different kind of quiet space.

00:33:23.626 --> 00:33:25.890
Can we go to the
next slide please?

00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:31.260
It took me in a very
different place creatively.

00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:34.290
I feel like if I didn't
have that shift of space,

00:33:34.290 --> 00:33:36.630
both mentally and
physically, I might not

00:33:36.630 --> 00:33:40.535
have had the creative shift
to be able to even come up

00:33:40.535 --> 00:33:41.160
with this idea.

00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:45.260
It's like so different than what
I was doing before in New York.

00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:48.030
And I think my vision
of what I hoped

00:33:48.030 --> 00:33:51.270
I might become that year when I
was 22 and I moved to New York

00:33:51.270 --> 00:33:55.020
to be a photographer, what
I thought my goal was then

00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:58.830
is very different than
what I ended up doing now.

00:33:58.830 --> 00:34:00.300
But I think I like this better.

00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:02.850
So you never know.

00:34:02.850 --> 00:34:07.800
So "Forest Feast Gatherings"
came out in 2016.

00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:10.630
And I feel like after--

00:34:10.630 --> 00:34:13.110
let's see, five or six
years in the woods,

00:34:13.110 --> 00:34:17.400
two babies later, we were kind
of ready for some even more

00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:18.230
new inspiration.

00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:19.980
So we decided to shift
it up a little bit.

00:34:19.980 --> 00:34:24.360
My husband had a three
month sabbatical, last fall.

00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:26.070
A year ago fall.

00:34:26.070 --> 00:34:30.300
And we decided to go to
Europe and spend three months

00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:31.590
traveling with our two kids.

00:34:31.590 --> 00:34:33.780
So we had a baby and
a toddler at the time.

00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:38.998
And we decided that we would go
to Barcelona first to get back

00:34:38.998 --> 00:34:40.290
a little bit of that city vibe.

00:34:40.290 --> 00:34:42.810
So we spent a whole
month in Barcelona.

00:34:42.810 --> 00:34:45.179
Then we traveled along
the French Riviera.

00:34:45.179 --> 00:34:48.000
And then we did a big
road trip around Sicily.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:52.380
And also hit up northern
Italy, the Liguria area.

00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:55.989
And then we ended the trip
with about a month in Portugal.

00:34:55.989 --> 00:34:59.940
And so that whole
experience, I went into it

00:34:59.940 --> 00:35:03.240
with the hope of making
a Mediterranean cookbook.

00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:06.690
So through that whole trip,
I Was taking lots of photos

00:35:06.690 --> 00:35:11.040
and tasting lots of things,
of course, tasting vegetarian

00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:14.580
things, but keeping an eye on
the traditional meaty things

00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:20.970
to think about how I could
shift things to be vegetarian.

00:35:20.970 --> 00:35:23.700
Take traditional local dishes,
but put a twist on them

00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:26.320
to be vegetarian.

00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:29.280
There's just me having a
glass of wine in Cinque Terre

00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:30.300
having a grand old time.

00:35:33.070 --> 00:35:34.290
Having some coffee.

00:35:34.290 --> 00:35:37.590
And this is what I actually
looked like most of the time,

00:35:37.590 --> 00:35:42.230
baby sleeping strapped to my
belly with a camera in hand.

00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:43.230
But it was an adventure.

00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:45.690
And I learned so much
about food and travel

00:35:45.690 --> 00:35:47.500
and exploring local flavors.

00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:51.660
This was the farmer's market
in Antibes in southern France,

00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:53.260
like right near Nice and Cannes.

00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:54.730
Has anyone been there before?

00:35:54.730 --> 00:35:55.230
Antibes?

00:35:55.230 --> 00:35:55.730
Yeah.

00:35:55.730 --> 00:35:56.590
So beautiful.

00:35:56.590 --> 00:35:57.528
It's amazing.

00:35:57.528 --> 00:35:58.570
Everyone should go there.

00:35:58.570 --> 00:36:00.990
But we stayed right next to
the farmer's market there.

00:36:00.990 --> 00:36:02.370
And we would go every day.

00:36:02.370 --> 00:36:04.800
And we kept buying the radishes.

00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:08.820
They had these
beautiful radishes

00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:10.410
that we would buy
with the butter

00:36:10.410 --> 00:36:13.650
from the farmers market, that
probably was made not too far

00:36:13.650 --> 00:36:14.190
away.

00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:16.830
And the flavors were so
intense, but everything was just

00:36:16.830 --> 00:36:22.000
so local and so plant inspired,
even though, of course,

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.780
there's lots of
meat in French food,

00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:27.420
but the use of vegetables,
even in winter,

00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:30.890
was very impressive to me.

00:36:30.890 --> 00:36:34.050
So I took note of
different foods grown there

00:36:34.050 --> 00:36:35.850
and then took it
back to our cabin

00:36:35.850 --> 00:36:38.760
in the woods to
develop recipes based

00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:44.160
on inspired by, not only the
dishes, but the produce grown

00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:45.720
in the places that we visited.

00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:48.910
So this was a dish inspired
by that Antibes market.

00:36:48.910 --> 00:36:50.910
They had the most incredible
cherry tomatoes all

00:36:50.910 --> 00:36:55.373
on the vine, just like all lined
up perfectly at the market.

00:36:55.373 --> 00:36:56.790
And so I roasted
them and put them

00:36:56.790 --> 00:36:58.590
with some torn
mozzarella and capers

00:36:58.590 --> 00:37:01.400
and a little bit of lemon zest
and some really good olive oil

00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:04.442
sprinkled on top and
flaky salt. And you just

00:37:04.442 --> 00:37:06.150
put it on a little
piece of French bread,

00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:08.245
and it's delicious
and so simple.

00:37:08.245 --> 00:37:09.370
And here's another example.

00:37:09.370 --> 00:37:12.030
So these are recipes
in my upcoming book

00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:14.430
that will be out in
September, and it's called

00:37:14.430 --> 00:37:16.110
the "Forest Feast Travels."

00:37:16.110 --> 00:37:20.230
And it's totally based on
this whole trip that we took.

00:37:20.230 --> 00:37:23.080
So this was part of
our Sicily road trip.

00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:28.050
And this is at the top of
Mount Etna, the active volcano.

00:37:28.050 --> 00:37:31.683
And this was a region known
for its honey and pistachio

00:37:31.683 --> 00:37:33.600
production, even at the
top, like in the lodge

00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:35.460
at the top of the volcano.

00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:37.130
They had a whole honey tasting.

00:37:37.130 --> 00:37:38.315
It was all local honey.

00:37:38.315 --> 00:37:38.940
It was so cool.

00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:40.830
So I thought, what can I do
with honey and pistachios?

00:37:40.830 --> 00:37:43.330
And in my other books, I always
have a shortbread recipe,

00:37:43.330 --> 00:37:44.705
so I thought I'm
going to combine

00:37:44.705 --> 00:37:47.520
the honey and the pistachios
into my shortbread recipe

00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:49.500
and have that be
inspired by Mount Etna.

00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:55.340
And there's that shortbread.

00:37:55.340 --> 00:37:57.290
And I'm always like
scavenging for dishes

00:37:57.290 --> 00:37:59.630
and looking for
different backdrops

00:37:59.630 --> 00:38:01.610
for a lot of the
backdrops in the next book

00:38:01.610 --> 00:38:04.250
because I didn't want them to
be on moss because we weren't

00:38:04.250 --> 00:38:07.110
talking about the
woods as much anymore.

00:38:07.110 --> 00:38:10.310
I printed out large posters
of a lot of the photos

00:38:10.310 --> 00:38:12.040
that I took while on this trip.

00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:13.790
So I intentionally
while we were traveling

00:38:13.790 --> 00:38:16.040
took photos of
cool looking walls,

00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:23.000
and tile, and rock, and just
all kinds of textural backdrops.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.400
And then printed
those out really big

00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:27.052
and I used those
as my backdrops.

00:38:27.052 --> 00:38:29.510
Because it just wasn't feasible
to shoot all the food while

00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:30.330
we were traveling.

00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:38.440
This is Pasta alla Norma
inspired by Tower Mina.

00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:41.140
Here's a beet pasta where
you just grate raw beats

00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:42.310
and mix them in.

00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:48.830
This is the pasta making class
in Italy that was so much fun.

00:38:48.830 --> 00:38:51.960
I had tried many times to
make pasta from scratch.

00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:54.160
Has anyone made
pasta from scratch?

00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:56.770
Yeah, good results?

00:38:56.770 --> 00:38:57.970
I found it so challenging.

00:38:57.970 --> 00:38:58.678
I don't know why.

00:38:58.678 --> 00:39:00.550
I just couldn't get the
texture quite right.

00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:03.730
Like all by hand, I didn't
want to use a pasta maker

00:39:03.730 --> 00:39:05.050
attachment or anything.

00:39:05.050 --> 00:39:07.630
But anyways, I took
this class and it's just

00:39:07.630 --> 00:39:12.910
eggs, flour, and a very
small splash of water.

00:39:12.910 --> 00:39:14.860
And that's all you need.

00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:15.700
It's delicious.

00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:22.210
So Chef Luca in Motorola, Italy
helped me with the fresh egg

00:39:22.210 --> 00:39:23.090
pasta recipe.

00:39:25.710 --> 00:39:27.820
A couple more shots
from the book.

00:39:27.820 --> 00:39:31.230
So I did some paintings kind
of inspired by the title,

00:39:31.230 --> 00:39:35.070
especially Lisbon had
amazing tile everywhere.

00:39:35.070 --> 00:39:37.820
So this is a shot from a wall
in Lisbon, that tile backdrop.

00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:39.980
And then I used
that as inspiration

00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:44.480
and also painted some tile like
backdrops that were watercolor.

00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:50.170
And, again, sort of mimicking
the watercolor pattern

00:39:50.170 --> 00:39:54.880
at the top based on the tile
that I used in the shot.

00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:57.070
Here's an action shot
shooting in Italy.

00:40:00.450 --> 00:40:04.190
This is a little video if
you don't mind playing.

00:40:04.190 --> 00:40:07.860
Everybody was drinking spritzes
in Italy, aperol spritzes,

00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:10.980
which is like this bright orange
liqueur with a little champagne

00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:14.670
or prosecco and
a little seltzer.

00:40:14.670 --> 00:40:17.340
So I had to include that.

00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:19.980
I did a slight
variation on it, but it

00:40:19.980 --> 00:40:21.540
was inspired by
these aperol spritzes

00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:23.970
that we tried in Italy.

00:40:23.970 --> 00:40:27.540
We did a really fun wine
tasting tour in Italy,

00:40:27.540 --> 00:40:31.650
hiking in the vineyards
above the ocean.

00:40:31.650 --> 00:40:34.350
A very, very small
family wine producer

00:40:34.350 --> 00:40:37.500
that we tried their wines.

00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:40.810
And there's the cover of the
book, "Forest Feast Travels"

00:40:40.810 --> 00:40:42.222
that comes out in September.

00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:50.100
So then just as a continuation
of my Forest Feast work,

00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:52.290
I also have some
stationery which

00:40:52.290 --> 00:40:54.900
has been really fun to
develop and a different kind

00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:56.670
of creative outlet for me.

00:40:56.670 --> 00:40:59.280
I'm thinking about how my
illustration and watercolors

00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:02.220
can be used to create different
products that aren't cookbooks,

00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:06.240
but still maybe help inspire
people to cook or take

00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:08.112
notes about food.

00:41:08.112 --> 00:41:09.570
I'm just always
trying to encourage

00:41:09.570 --> 00:41:14.980
people to think about being
creative in your daily life.

00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:17.500
It's not always so
easy to do that,

00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:19.410
but I think there are
certain things that

00:41:19.410 --> 00:41:22.810
can help like cook books.

00:41:22.810 --> 00:41:24.940
They inspire me.

00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:28.835
These were some placements that
were made with my watercolors.

00:41:28.835 --> 00:41:31.210
And some more kind of product
sketches that I'm currently

00:41:31.210 --> 00:41:35.830
working on for dishes and
tablecloths and things

00:41:35.830 --> 00:41:39.152
that I'm dreaming about
but haven't made yet.

00:41:39.152 --> 00:41:41.660
Except for I did
make some clothes.

00:41:41.660 --> 00:41:44.380
This is a photo that I took
of a really big orange tree

00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:46.420
in Sacramento.

00:41:46.420 --> 00:41:48.160
It was a really
dense orange tree.

00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:51.160
And I took a one huge
shot, one photo of it.

00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:55.150
And it was big enough to be
able to blow up and cover

00:41:55.150 --> 00:41:58.480
a small couch with, which
I did for our house.

00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:01.150
And then I made us some
clothes to wear to a wedding

00:42:01.150 --> 00:42:01.980
last summer to.

00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:04.930
It's a little
ridiculous, but fun.

00:42:04.930 --> 00:42:08.567
So the cool part about this
whole "Forest Feast" adventure

00:42:08.567 --> 00:42:10.150
that I've been on
in sharing the books

00:42:10.150 --> 00:42:12.820
is that now it's
in 10 languages.

00:42:12.820 --> 00:42:16.150
And while we were traveling,
we saw the book in, I think,

00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:17.925
every country in that language.

00:42:17.925 --> 00:42:19.300
So it's so fun to
be able to see.

00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:20.830
And especially
online, nothing makes

00:42:20.830 --> 00:42:24.580
me happier than seeing people
making recipes from the book

00:42:24.580 --> 00:42:26.360
and tagging them so
that I can see them.

00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:29.050
And I feel like it's just
spreading the vegetable

00:42:29.050 --> 00:42:30.115
love across the world.

00:42:32.860 --> 00:42:35.590
So I guess when I think
about what my goal is

00:42:35.590 --> 00:42:39.010
with the "Forest
Feast" and what I

00:42:39.010 --> 00:42:40.900
hope to do by
creating these books

00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:44.140
and sharing my artwork is
really to inspire people

00:42:44.140 --> 00:42:48.250
to get together and eat good
food, good healthy food that

00:42:48.250 --> 00:42:55.340
is plant based, fruit based,
grown locally, if possible.

00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:59.200
It's not only good for our
bodies but good for our planet.

00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:02.440
And my goal is to do that in
an artful and approachable way

00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:05.650
to make it easy for people
to not only eat that way,

00:43:05.650 --> 00:43:07.250
but to do it together.

00:43:07.250 --> 00:43:08.310
Thank you very much.

00:43:08.310 --> 00:43:09.555
SCOTT: Thank you.

00:43:09.555 --> 00:43:11.880
[CLAPPING]

00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:13.417
So I have one quick
question for you

00:43:13.417 --> 00:43:15.250
and then I have a
question for the audience.

00:43:15.250 --> 00:43:17.070
So if you have
three tips that you

00:43:17.070 --> 00:43:20.250
could pass along to probably
many of our Instagramers

00:43:20.250 --> 00:43:21.070
out there.

00:43:21.070 --> 00:43:23.070
When they're at restaurants
or they're in a cafe

00:43:23.070 --> 00:43:24.870
and they want to take
a picture of with food,

00:43:24.870 --> 00:43:26.870
what are some of the
things that you think about

00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:27.813
to tell the story--

00:43:27.813 --> 00:43:29.730
because we don't have
time for lighting booths

00:43:29.730 --> 00:43:31.438
and all that, to tell
the story as you've

00:43:31.438 --> 00:43:33.990
done so eloquently, to
capture that moment,

00:43:33.990 --> 00:43:36.110
and to get the best contrast?

00:43:36.110 --> 00:43:37.940
Are there any tips
you can pass on?

00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:38.770
ERIN GLEESON: Sure.

00:43:38.770 --> 00:43:39.270
Yeah.

00:43:39.270 --> 00:43:41.760
So go at lunchtime.

00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:43.230
Sit by the window.

00:43:43.230 --> 00:43:45.180
And do an overhead shot.

00:43:45.180 --> 00:43:48.420
So I think dishes
always look good

00:43:48.420 --> 00:43:51.300
when they're lit from either
behind or from the side.

00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:53.000
So if you can place your--

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.830
so if this is my dish, and
this is the window right here,

00:43:55.830 --> 00:43:57.780
I might place my dish
right here and shoot

00:43:57.780 --> 00:43:59.967
from right here or
from right here so

00:43:59.967 --> 00:44:02.550
that I get a little bit of side
light or a little bit of light

00:44:02.550 --> 00:44:04.500
from behind.

00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:07.410
If it seems a little
too dark on one side,

00:44:07.410 --> 00:44:11.580
sometimes I hold up a white
plate or a white napkin

00:44:11.580 --> 00:44:14.370
to bounce a little bit
of light back on there.

00:44:14.370 --> 00:44:17.730
But the portrait mode is
obviously great for food shots

00:44:17.730 --> 00:44:19.110
to get a really close up.

00:44:19.110 --> 00:44:22.470
But I think I often go
for the overhead look.

00:44:22.470 --> 00:44:25.590
And I usually
don't shoot square.

00:44:25.590 --> 00:44:28.170
But if you do, you
could center the dish.

00:44:28.170 --> 00:44:32.800
But if you're shooting with the
rectangle shape for Instagram,

00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:35.260
then I like to balance
it out somehow.

00:44:35.260 --> 00:44:38.220
So sort of have it be
slightly off center.

00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:41.880
You can crop the plate
maybe by three quarters.

00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:44.647
And maybe pull a couple of
other elements into the corners

00:44:44.647 --> 00:44:45.730
to kind of balance it out.

00:44:45.730 --> 00:44:48.970
So I'm often looking
for an offset balance.

00:44:48.970 --> 00:44:51.300
So if my plate is
towards the middle,

00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:56.490
have maybe a napkin down here
and some flowers up here.

00:44:56.490 --> 00:44:58.190
And then shoot it
right from overhead.

00:44:58.190 --> 00:45:01.627
Or move that plate over and have
something down in the corner

00:45:01.627 --> 00:45:02.710
to sort of balance it out.

00:45:02.710 --> 00:45:05.160
So you're looking for
balance in the photo,

00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:07.258
but not super symmetrical.

00:45:07.258 --> 00:45:08.925
I like things to be
slightly off center.

00:45:08.925 --> 00:45:11.030
SCOTT: Huge round of
applause for Erin Gleeson.

00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:12.200

ERIN GLEESON: Thank you.

00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:13.800
