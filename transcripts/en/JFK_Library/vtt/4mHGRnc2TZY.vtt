00:00:00.218 --> 00:00:02.217
- So I became really
good at just, you know,

00:00:02.217 --> 00:00:06.350
either not saying anything,
and even my ballet teacher

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:07.766
that I was training with,

00:00:07.766 --> 00:00:10.638
she had no idea that
we were on food stamps,

00:00:10.638 --> 00:00:13.333
and didn't really, you know,
I wasn't eating enough.

00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:14.633
And we were living in a motel,

00:00:14.633 --> 00:00:17.526
and I was taking a two-hour
bus drive back and forth

00:00:17.526 --> 00:00:20.950
from school or to get to ballet class.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:24.880
I just felt it was best
if she just worried about,

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.175
you know, training me.

00:00:26.175 --> 00:00:28.186
And then I dealt with
all of the other stuff.

00:00:28.186 --> 00:00:31.274
And I feel like I grew up
quick, almost, in a way,

00:00:31.274 --> 00:00:33.991
because I was exposed to so much,

00:00:33.991 --> 00:00:36.948
and dealing, you know,
responsible for so much

00:00:36.948 --> 00:00:39.194
at such a young age.

00:00:39.194 --> 00:00:41.477
But there was a breaking point

00:00:41.477 --> 00:00:44.675
when I told her that I
could no longer dance,

00:00:44.675 --> 00:00:47.973
because it was just too
much responsibility.

00:00:47.973 --> 00:00:49.547
My mother had five other children

00:00:49.547 --> 00:00:53.590
that she was trying to
raise and keep in school.

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.374
This was just an
extra-curricular activity to her.

00:00:57.374 --> 00:00:59.980
So once I told her I
could no longer dance,

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.862
she said, well can I at
least drive you home?

00:01:01.862 --> 00:01:04.961
And it was like, no no no, you
can't drive me home. (laughs)

00:01:04.961 --> 00:01:06.884
And she was like, I'm driving you home.

00:01:06.884 --> 00:01:10.622
And that's when she found
out I was living in a motel.

00:01:10.622 --> 00:01:14.136
- [Interviewer] The way
she tells this story,

00:01:14.136 --> 00:01:18.069
she dropped you off, and
then she was driving away,

00:01:18.069 --> 00:01:21.567
and she said she was about
halfway back to either the studio

00:01:21.567 --> 00:01:25.161
or her home, and she just
decided to turn around and

00:01:25.161 --> 00:01:28.672
go right back to the
motel, knocks on the door,

00:01:28.672 --> 00:01:31.073
and what did she ask your mother?

00:01:31.073 --> 00:01:34.039
- I don't know where I would
be if that never happened.

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:37.501
She turned around and she came back,

00:01:37.501 --> 00:01:41.063
and she asked my mother
if I can live with her.

00:01:41.063 --> 00:01:44.647
And I mean, I was like, what? (laughs)

00:01:44.647 --> 00:01:48.456
That was not something
that I ever considered.

00:01:48.456 --> 00:01:52.157
I knew it was normal, you
know, for a dancer to go off

00:01:52.157 --> 00:01:54.473
to a boarding school or go off and train.

00:01:54.473 --> 00:01:56.863
And she really broke it down
and explained it to my mom

00:01:56.863 --> 00:01:58.072
in that way.

00:01:58.072 --> 00:02:02.476
You know, that she had
done that at 15 years old.

00:02:02.476 --> 00:02:06.906
And I think that it was just
a lot for her to really,

00:02:06.906 --> 00:02:10.123
not just see the motel,
but see me sitting inside.

00:02:10.123 --> 00:02:12.954
And there was no bedroom, and
I was sitting on the floor,

00:02:12.954 --> 00:02:15.778
and just feeling like
this is it, you know?

00:02:15.778 --> 00:02:18.639
Like it's either this is
what her life is going to be,

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:22.326
or I can change it and she
can change the ballet world.

00:02:22.326 --> 00:02:25.983
And luckily, my mom said okay. (laughs)

00:02:25.983 --> 00:02:29.400
And that was the beginning of everything.
