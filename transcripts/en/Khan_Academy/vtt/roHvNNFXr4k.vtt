00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.810
Marcia has just opened
her new computer store.

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.480
She makes $27 on every
computer she sells

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.910
and her monthly
expenses are $10,000.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.850
What is the minimum
number of computer

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:15.410
she needs to sell in a
month to make a profit?

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:17.975
So I'll let you think
about that for a second.

00:00:17.975 --> 00:00:20.100
Well, let's think about
what we have to figure out.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.766
We have to figure out
the minimum number

00:00:21.766 --> 00:00:23.240
of computers she needs to sell.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.770
So let's set that to a
variable or set a variable

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:26.660
to represent that.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.770
So let's let x equal the
number of computers she sells.

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:36.220
Number of computers sold.

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.250
Now, let's think about
how much net profit

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.770
she will make in a month.

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.311
And that's what
we're thinking about.

00:00:41.311 --> 00:00:43.660
How many computers,
the minimum number she

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.570
needs to sell in order
to make a net profit?

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.770
So I'll write her
profit is going

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.830
to be how much money she brings
in from selling the computers.

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.370
And she makes $27 on
every computer she sells.

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.870
So her profit is going to be
$27 times the number of computer

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:01.410
she sells.

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.550
She gets $27 per computer
times the number she sells.

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:07.310
But we're not done yet.

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.250
She still has expenses
of $10,000 per month.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.860
So we're going to have to
subtract out the $10,000.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.800
What we care about
is making a profit.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:25.530
We want this number right over
here to be greater than 0.

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.000
So let's just think about
what number of computers

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.460
would get us to 0.

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.300
And then, maybe she needs
to sell a little bit more

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:33.880
than that.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.180
So let's see what gets
her to break even.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.150
So break even-- that's 0 profit.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.411
Neither positive or negative--
is equal to 27 times--

00:01:41.411 --> 00:01:42.910
and I'll do it all
in one color now.

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.300
27x minus 10,000.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.530
Well, we've seen equations
like this before.

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.710
We can add 10,000 to both sides.

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.890
Add 10,000 to both
sides, so it's no longer

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.610
on the right-hand side.

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.630
And we are left with 10,000.

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.579
10,000 is equal to 27x.

00:02:08.579 --> 00:02:10.120
And then to solve
for x, we just have

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:13.290
to divide both sides by 27.

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.910
Let's do that.

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.440
Divide both sides by 27.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.580
On our right-hand
side, we have x.

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.070
So let me just write this down.

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.110
So we have x on our right-hand
side is going to be equal

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.190
to 10,000/27.

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.890
I switched the right and
the left-hand sides here.

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.140
Now, what is this going to be?

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.800
Well, we can do a little bit of
long division to handle that.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.950
So 27 goes into 10,000.

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.490
So 27 doesn't go into 1.

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:42.340
Doesn't go into 10.

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.080
It goes into 100 three times.

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.754
3 times 27 is what?

00:02:48.754 --> 00:02:51.556
81.

00:02:51.556 --> 00:02:55.410
100 minus 81 is 19.

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.230
Then we can bring down a 0.

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.332
27 goes into 190?

00:03:00.332 --> 00:03:02.877
It looks like it will go
into it about six times.

00:03:02.877 --> 00:03:03.960
Let's see if that's right.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.330
6 times 7 is 42.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.220
6 times 2 is 12.

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.558
Plus 4.

00:03:10.558 --> 00:03:11.420
16.

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.620
Let's see, 90 minus
62 is actually 28.

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.110
Let me turn this back.

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:19.870
So it goes 7 times.

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.470
7 times 7 is 49.

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.020
7 times 2 is 14.

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.260
Plus 4 is 18.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.030
There you go.

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.950
Look at that.

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.090
So 190 minus 189.

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.820
We get 1.

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.820
Let's bring down another 0.

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.705
We bring down another 0.

00:03:36.705 --> 00:03:38.900
We have a 0 right there.

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.182
27 goes into 10 how many times?

00:03:42.182 --> 00:03:43.640
Well, it doesn't
go into 10 at all.

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.250
So we'll put a 0 right there.

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:48.450
0 times 27 is 0.

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.020
Then we subtract.

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.210
And then, we get 10 again.

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:54.220
And now we're in
the decimal range.

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.400
Or we're going to start
getting decimal values.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.695
We can bring down another 0.

00:03:57.695 --> 00:04:01.560
We could get 27 goes
into 100 three times.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:07.288
So our x-value is going
to be approximately 370.3.

00:04:07.288 --> 00:04:10.340
And then we're going to keep
going on and on and on and on.

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.760
But this is enough information
for us to answer our question.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.630
What is the minimum
number of computers

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:19.019
she needs to sell in a
month to make a profit?

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.570
Well, she can't sell
a decimal number

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.750
of computers, a
third of a computer.

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.470
She could either
sell 370 computers.

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.580
If she sells 370
computers, then she's

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.520
not going to get to
break even because that's

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.530
less than the quantity
she needs for break even.

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.500
So she needs to sell 371.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:44.477
She needs to sell 371 computers
in a month to make a profit.
