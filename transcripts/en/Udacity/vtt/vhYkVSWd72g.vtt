00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.760
&gt;&gt; The thing that I find most useful in

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:04.290
trying to understand the folk theorem and, and what

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.200
it says and how it works is a thing that I call a two-player plot. I don't know

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.400
if other people have other names for it, but

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.730
this, this concept is out and, and often discussed.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.970
I just don't know what it's called [LAUGH]. But

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:18.630
here's the idea of it, it's a really simple idea.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:19.870
&gt;&gt; It's like a folk plot.

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.150
&gt;&gt; It is a, it is a folk, a folk plot, right,

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.168
I don't know who invented this plot. So here's what we're going to do,

00:00:25.168 --> 00:00:26.856
remember this prisoner's dilemma game. We've

00:00:26.856 --> 00:00:29.634
got two players, there's Smoove and Curly.

00:00:29.634 --> 00:00:30.566
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:30.566 --> 00:00:32.490
&gt;&gt; And, what we're going to do, is

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.598
we're, there's a bunch of joint, actions that

00:00:35.598 --> 00:00:39.840
they can take. So Smoove cooperates and

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.770
Curly defects, or they both defect, or they

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.790
both cooperate, or one defects defect cooperate

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:46.353
in the other direction. So what we're going to

00:00:46.353 --> 00:00:48.102
do is for each of those joint outcomes,

00:00:48.102 --> 00:00:50.534
each of those joint action choices. I'm going to

00:00:50.534 --> 00:00:54.388
plot a dot, put a dot on a two-dimensional plot, where

00:00:54.388 --> 00:00:58.491
this is the Smoove axis, and this is the Curly axis, okay.

00:00:58.491 --> 00:00:59.720
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.982
&gt;&gt; So cooperate-cooperate, remember from the

00:01:01.982 --> 00:01:04.360
prisoner, prisoner dilemma payoffs, is minus

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.007
one, minus one. So I put a dot at minus one, minus one.

00:01:08.007 --> 00:01:12.860
Defect, defect. Is it minus six, minus six? Cooperate defect is it minus

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.780
nine zero? And defect cooperate, is it zero minus nine? . So do

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.310
those four points make sense to you? Do you understand like the idea?

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:19.500
&gt;&gt; They do.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.236
&gt;&gt; It may not be so obvious why we do, do it this

00:01:22.236 --> 00:01:25.890
way, because as you have told us, the matrix is all you need.

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:26.971
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:26.971 --> 00:01:31.170
&gt;&gt; But this is really just representing the matrix in another form.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.062
But it actually is sort of losing some information. Because these dots

00:01:35.062 --> 00:01:37.798
don't tell us what the relationship is in terms of if, if

00:01:37.798 --> 00:01:40.819
one player keeps the same action and the other player changes to

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:43.120
a different action. The matrix captures that but

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.030
this plot doesn't anymore, it's kind of washed out.

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.720
&gt;&gt; I see.
