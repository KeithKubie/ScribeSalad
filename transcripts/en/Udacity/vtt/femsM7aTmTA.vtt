00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.600
One of my college professors really liked to say that DNA,

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.150
and life in general, is really just organic chemistry that crawls.

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:09.840
&gt;&gt; I like that analogy, but once we start talking about

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.700
chemistry is DNA, it's just a little out of my league Matt.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.120
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's true. The, the details in chemistry can

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.810
be a little complex, especially if you don't have the chemistry

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.500
background. and really those details are out of the scope of

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.120
our course, so what we're going to do is replace the chemistry

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.910
with symbols, or our letters, to make things easier.

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.210
&gt;&gt; I mean, I like it. It does seem a little easier. And just looking at the

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.610
letters, I think I can see a pattern. Oh,

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.230
what kind of pattern do you think you see?

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.340
&gt;&gt; Well, if I look at one side I think I

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.640
can judge the letters that are going to be in the other, right?

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.920
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's actually really good and important. Sometimes

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.310
when we discover a new genome, and we don't

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:48.180
know much about it yet, we want to know

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.130
what it's made of. Being able to count the number

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.940
of Adenines, Thymines, Guanines, Cytosines, the As,

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.870
Ts, Gs and Cs, the letters of

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.990
DNA, can actually give us information. About

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:01.110
how many genes might be in that genome.

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.730
&gt;&gt; So take a look at this strand here. Now, if I don't

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.730
give you the other side can you tell me what percentage of the

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:12.140
whole DNA structure is guanines or Gs? Now this can get a little

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.640
tricky so if you get stuck take a look at the base pairing rules.
