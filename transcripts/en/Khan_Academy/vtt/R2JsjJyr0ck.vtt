00:00:00.455 --> 00:00:01.539
Voiceover:Let's say that

00:00:01.539 --> 00:00:03.405
we've got the function F of X

00:00:03.405 --> 00:00:06.330
and it is equal to the natural log

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.552
of X plus five over X minus one.

00:00:11.552 --> 00:00:13.213
And what we want to figure out

00:00:13.213 --> 00:00:17.519
is what is F prime of X.

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:19.711
And I encourage you to pause this video

00:00:19.711 --> 00:00:21.534
and try to figure it out on your own.

00:00:21.534 --> 00:00:24.915
So there's two ways that
you can approach this.

00:00:24.915 --> 00:00:27.357
I would call one way the easy way.

00:00:27.357 --> 00:00:29.985
And the other way, the hard way.

00:00:29.985 --> 00:00:32.267
And we'll work through both of them.

00:00:32.267 --> 00:00:34.630
The easy way is to recognize

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:36.164
your logarithm properties,

00:00:36.164 --> 00:00:38.595
to remember that the natural log

00:00:38.595 --> 00:00:40.260
of A over B.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.553
Remember natural log is
just log base the number E.

00:00:43.553 --> 00:00:45.539
So this is just going to be equal to

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:46.930
the natural log of A

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.253
minus the natural log of B.

00:00:49.253 --> 00:00:51.149
So if we just apply this property

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.031
right over here,

00:00:52.031 --> 00:00:53.237
and just simplify this expression,

00:00:53.237 --> 00:00:54.836
or at least simplify
it from a point of view

00:00:54.836 --> 00:00:56.543
in terms of having to
take this derivative.

00:00:56.543 --> 00:00:58.613
We can rewrite F of X.

00:00:58.613 --> 00:01:02.206
We can write F of X as being equal to

00:01:02.206 --> 00:01:04.819
the natural log of X plus five

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:10.442
minus the natural log of X minus one.

00:01:10.442 --> 00:01:12.943
And when we take the derivative now

00:01:12.943 --> 00:01:14.162
with respect to X,

00:01:14.162 --> 00:01:15.307
F prime of X,

00:01:15.307 --> 00:01:16.956
well this is going to be the derivative

00:01:16.956 --> 00:01:18.545
of the natural log of X plus five

00:01:18.545 --> 00:01:20.064
with respect to X plus five,

00:01:20.064 --> 00:01:22.458
so that's going to be one over X plus five

00:01:22.458 --> 00:01:24.892
times the derivative of X plus five

00:01:24.892 --> 00:01:26.042
with respect to X.

00:01:26.042 --> 00:01:27.380
I'm just applying the chain rule here,

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:28.975
and that's just going to be one.

00:01:28.975 --> 00:01:33.823
So this, the derivative of that is that.

00:01:33.823 --> 00:01:35.843
And the derivative of this,

00:01:35.843 --> 00:01:36.946
well, let's see,

00:01:36.946 --> 00:01:38.847
we're going to have a minus sign there

00:01:38.847 --> 00:01:40.403
and the derivative of the natural log

00:01:40.403 --> 00:01:44.736
of X minus one with respect to X minus one

00:01:44.736 --> 00:01:49.394
is going to be one over X minus one

00:01:49.394 --> 00:01:50.993
and the derivative of X minus one

00:01:50.993 --> 00:01:52.671
with the respect to X is just one

00:01:52.671 --> 00:01:53.912
you just multiply this by one,

00:01:53.912 --> 00:01:55.011
it doesn't really change the value.

00:01:55.011 --> 00:01:56.241
And we're done!

00:01:56.241 --> 00:01:58.759
We were able to figure
out the derivative of F.

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:00.801
Now what's the hard way

00:02:00.801 --> 00:02:01.971
you might be thinking?

00:02:01.971 --> 00:02:03.043
Or maybe you did do it

00:02:03.043 --> 00:02:04.596
when you tried to approach it on your own.

00:02:04.596 --> 00:02:06.795
Well, that's not to
simplify this expression

00:02:06.795 --> 00:02:07.780
using this property

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.571
and just to try and power through this

00:02:09.571 --> 00:02:11.095
using the chain rule.

00:02:11.095 --> 00:02:12.524
So let's try and do that.

00:02:12.524 --> 00:02:14.688
In that case, F prime of X

00:02:14.688 --> 00:02:16.353
is going to be the derivative

00:02:16.353 --> 00:02:18.163
of this whole thing

00:02:18.163 --> 00:02:19.695
with respect to X plus five

00:02:19.695 --> 00:02:20.948
over X minus one

00:02:20.948 --> 00:02:24.724
which is going to be one over X plus five

00:02:24.724 --> 00:02:27.453
over X minus one

00:02:27.453 --> 00:02:31.997
times the derivative, times the derivative

00:02:31.997 --> 00:02:36.202
with respect to X of X plus five

00:02:36.202 --> 00:02:38.991
over X minus one.

00:02:38.991 --> 00:02:40.118
This is just the chain rule.

00:02:40.118 --> 00:02:41.233
The derivative of this whole thing

00:02:41.233 --> 00:02:42.458
with respect to this expression,

00:02:42.458 --> 00:02:44.772
times the derivative of this expression

00:02:44.772 --> 00:02:47.333
with respect to X.

00:02:47.333 --> 00:02:48.373
Just the chain rule.

00:02:48.373 --> 00:02:49.284
So let's see,

00:02:49.284 --> 00:02:50.600
this is going to be equal to,

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.426
let's use some colors here,

00:02:52.426 --> 00:02:54.829
this, what I'm boxing off in blue,

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:57.077
that's the same thing as X minus one

00:02:57.077 --> 00:02:59.285
over X plus five.

00:02:59.304 --> 00:03:01.714
I'm just taking the reciprocal of this.

00:03:01.714 --> 00:03:02.755
And then it's going to be times,

00:03:02.755 --> 00:03:04.913
and I'll do this in magenta.

00:03:04.913 --> 00:03:06.769
No that's not magenta.

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:08.847
So that's going to be times

00:03:08.847 --> 00:03:10.008
and I'm going to rewrite it

00:03:10.008 --> 00:03:11.703
as the derivative with respect to X

00:03:11.703 --> 00:03:16.389
of X plus five times X minus one

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:17.406
to the negative one power.

00:03:17.406 --> 00:03:18.460
And I like to write it that way

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:21.086
because I always forget the whole

00:03:21.086 --> 00:03:22.493
quotient rule thing.

00:03:22.493 --> 00:03:24.046
But I remember the product rule.

00:03:24.046 --> 00:03:25.093
So this thing

00:03:25.093 --> 00:03:26.189
so let me rewrite it,

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:27.757
I think you already appreciate

00:03:27.757 --> 00:03:28.839
why this is the hard way.

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:30.276
So let me write this

00:03:30.276 --> 00:03:34.178
this is X minus one over X plus five times

00:03:34.178 --> 00:03:37.555
so let's apply the product rule,

00:03:37.555 --> 00:03:38.573
The derivative of X plus five,

00:03:38.573 --> 00:03:41.122
well that's just one times the second term

00:03:41.122 --> 00:03:44.109
times X minus one to the negative one,

00:03:44.186 --> 00:03:46.196
so that's one over X minus one.

00:03:46.196 --> 00:03:47.887
And then plus,

00:03:47.887 --> 00:03:49.806
what's the derivative of X minus one

00:03:49.806 --> 00:03:50.811
over negative one.

00:03:50.811 --> 00:03:51.969
Well, let's see,

00:03:51.969 --> 00:03:54.538
that's going to be, that's going to be

00:03:54.538 --> 00:03:58.848
negative X minus one to
the negative two power.

00:03:58.848 --> 00:04:02.546
So I can say negative one, X minus one

00:04:02.546 --> 00:04:04.171
to the negative two.

00:04:04.171 --> 00:04:06.007
I can just write it like this.

00:04:06.007 --> 00:04:08.653
And then times the
derivative of X minus one

00:04:08.653 --> 00:04:09.756
with respect to X.

00:04:09.756 --> 00:04:11.341
Well that's going to be one.

00:04:11.372 --> 00:04:14.024
And then times this.

00:04:14.024 --> 00:04:15.476
X plus five.

00:04:15.476 --> 00:04:16.211
So actually,

00:04:16.211 --> 00:04:21.171
so times, times, X plus five.

00:04:21.171 --> 00:04:23.618
So all I did here, product rule.

00:04:23.618 --> 00:04:27.130
Derivative, derivative of this

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.943
is one times that.

00:04:29.943 --> 00:04:31.690
And that gave us that over there.

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.854
And then I took the derivative of this

00:04:34.854 --> 00:04:37.288
which is this right over here.

00:04:37.288 --> 00:04:39.695
Negative one over X minus one

00:04:39.695 --> 00:04:42.196
and the, over X minus one squared.

00:04:42.196 --> 00:04:43.670
Or you can say negative X minus one

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:44.887
to the negative two power

00:04:44.887 --> 00:04:47.631
times this first expression over there.

00:04:47.631 --> 00:04:48.857
So there's that derivative.

00:04:48.857 --> 00:04:53.153
Now let's see if we can simplify things.

00:04:53.153 --> 00:04:56.262
So if we, let's see,

00:04:56.262 --> 00:04:58.285
if we were to, if we were to

00:04:58.285 --> 00:04:59.847
let me just rewrite everything.

00:04:59.847 --> 00:05:05.448
So this is equal to X
minus one over X plus five

00:05:05.801 --> 00:05:09.311
times one over X minus one,

00:05:09.311 --> 00:05:12.297
minus X plus five,

00:05:12.297 --> 00:05:17.939
over X minus one squared.

00:05:17.939 --> 00:05:19.029
Now let's think about what happens

00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:20.332
when we distribute this.

00:05:20.332 --> 00:05:23.097
So when you distribute this times that,

00:05:23.097 --> 00:05:26.051
this numerator cancels
with that denominator

00:05:26.051 --> 00:05:29.305
and so we're going to get, going to get,

00:05:29.305 --> 00:05:30.104
let's see,

00:05:30.104 --> 00:05:32.886
one over X plus five.

00:05:32.886 --> 00:05:37.010
And then when you distribute it over here

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:38.321
the X plus five is going to cancel

00:05:38.321 --> 00:05:39.815
the X plus five.

00:05:39.815 --> 00:05:41.576
And one of the X minus ones

00:05:41.576 --> 00:05:42.317
is going to cancel

00:05:42.317 --> 00:05:43.548
one of these X minus ones.

00:05:43.548 --> 00:05:44.391
And you're going to be left

00:05:44.391 --> 00:05:47.026
with just one of those X minus ones

00:05:47.026 --> 00:05:48.292
as the denominator.

00:05:48.292 --> 00:05:50.224
And so you get F prime of X

00:05:50.224 --> 00:05:51.340
is equal to this.

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:52.277
And lucky for us,

00:05:52.277 --> 00:05:54.349
we got the same answer either way.

00:05:54.349 --> 00:05:55.627
But as we see, the easy way

00:05:55.627 --> 00:05:59.052
is much easier than the hard way.
