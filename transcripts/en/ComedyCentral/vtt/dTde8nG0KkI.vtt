00:00:03.504 --> 00:00:04.738
Welcome to the U.

00:00:04.838 --> 00:00:06.340
I would love so much
to help you today.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:07.674
I'm checking in.

00:00:07.774 --> 00:00:09.543
That would be
my great pleasure.

00:00:09.643 --> 00:00:12.379
May I offer you a kumquat
and elderflower julep?

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:13.714
Yeah.
Thank you.

00:00:13.814 --> 00:00:15.883
No, thank <i>you,</i>
really.

00:00:15.983 --> 00:00:18.585
This is a lot nicer than
the hotels I usually stay at.

00:00:18.685 --> 00:00:20.654
I'm just in town for work
for the night.

00:00:20.754 --> 00:00:22.990
Oh, I'm so happy you felt
comfortable enough

00:00:23.123 --> 00:00:24.791
to share that with me.

00:00:24.892 --> 00:00:26.660
What name would
the reservation be under?

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:27.861
Amy Schumer.

00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:29.696
Of course.
Perfect.

00:00:29.796 --> 00:00:31.398
My parents
almost named me Amy,

00:00:31.498 --> 00:00:32.933
but I didn't deserve it.

00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:35.302
(gasps) You picked
a great weekend to be here.

00:00:35.435 --> 00:00:38.906
Willow Nolte is guest dee-jaying
in the lobby tonight.

00:00:39.006 --> 00:00:40.908
Nick Nolte's stepdaughter.

00:00:41.008 --> 00:00:42.743
Wow.

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.444
Here's your room key.

00:00:44.545 --> 00:00:45.812
Check-out is at 11:00,

00:00:45.946 --> 00:00:48.048
and now I'll show you
to your room.

00:00:48.182 --> 00:00:49.716
You're an angel
and it's my great honor

00:00:49.816 --> 00:00:51.818
to breathe the same air
as you.

00:00:51.919 --> 00:00:55.556
Now, this is Soak,
our pool experience.

00:00:55.656 --> 00:00:58.559
Over here, we have Splay,
our lounge area.

00:00:58.659 --> 00:00:59.726
Oh, no.

00:00:59.826 --> 00:01:01.528
Oh, I would have
had more of that.

00:01:01.628 --> 00:01:03.063
And right here is Soar,

00:01:03.163 --> 00:01:05.365
which will take us
to your room.

00:01:05.465 --> 00:01:07.467
Oh, I love your shoes.

00:01:07.568 --> 00:01:10.070
Everything about you
is just so on point.

00:01:10.204 --> 00:01:11.471
Thank you.

00:01:11.572 --> 00:01:14.541
I love rolling
this bag around.

00:01:14.641 --> 00:01:16.577
'Cause it's yours.

00:01:16.677 --> 00:01:18.579
Welcome home.

00:01:18.712 --> 00:01:20.113
This is huge.

00:01:20.214 --> 00:01:21.582
You could fit
three people in here.

00:01:21.682 --> 00:01:23.317
This is too fancy
for me.

00:01:23.417 --> 00:01:24.918
No, don't say that.
No.

00:01:25.085 --> 00:01:25.986
This is all about you.

00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:27.788
You deserve this.

00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:31.091
You make Kate Middleton look
like a mental patient

00:01:31.091 --> 00:01:33.794
(bleep) herself
in a rusty wheelchair.

00:01:33.894 --> 00:01:35.429
Right this way.

00:01:36.897 --> 00:01:39.333
All of our water is pumped in
from virginal koi ponds

00:01:39.433 --> 00:01:41.368
where two beautiful
swans are making love

00:01:41.468 --> 00:01:42.703
for the first time.

00:01:42.803 --> 00:01:44.805
Our ceramic sustainable
infinity toilet

00:01:44.938 --> 00:01:49.576
has an orgasm
every time you flush.

00:01:49.676 --> 00:01:51.879
(toilet)
<i>Oh, yes!</i>

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:55.449
<i>I never have to fake it
with you, Amy.</i>

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:56.850
You look radiant.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.019
Take a look at yourself
in the mirror.

00:01:59.152 --> 00:02:00.721
See what I see.

00:02:06.093 --> 00:02:07.461
Wait, why is it--

00:02:07.561 --> 00:02:08.695
Why aren't <i>you</i>
in the mirror?

00:02:08.795 --> 00:02:10.464
Oh, it doesn't reflect
the staff.

00:02:10.564 --> 00:02:12.366
We're nothing.
I'm (bleep).

00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:15.068
Look at me running my mouth off
like a stupid dumb bitch.

00:02:15.102 --> 00:02:17.437
Anyway,
you must be exhausted.

00:02:17.538 --> 00:02:18.639
I'll leave you alone.

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:20.107
Okay.

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:26.513
â™ª

00:02:31.084 --> 00:02:32.352
(sighs)

00:02:32.452 --> 00:02:33.620
Hello, angel.
Oh, my God.

00:02:33.754 --> 00:02:34.788
Can I tuck you in?

00:02:34.888 --> 00:02:36.390
Uh, you don't have to--

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:37.691
Oh, I want to.

00:02:37.791 --> 00:02:39.493
Oh.

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.361
Now, would you like
to be awakened

00:02:41.495 --> 00:02:44.998
by a soft kiss on the cheek or
a stranger going down on you?

00:02:45.098 --> 00:02:46.700
Oh,
I don't kn-- know.

00:02:46.834 --> 00:02:48.402
I guess the latter?

00:02:48.502 --> 00:02:50.404
Okay, we can just feel it
out in the moment then.

00:02:50.504 --> 00:02:52.005
Is there anything else
I can do for you?

00:02:52.105 --> 00:02:53.373
Anything?

00:02:53.473 --> 00:02:54.875
Um, well, I hate to ask,

00:02:54.975 --> 00:02:57.010
but I usually sleep with
a white noise machine--

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.146
Shh...

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.515
I really prefer--

00:03:01.648 --> 00:03:03.050
Whale noises?

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.885
That's my specialty.

00:03:05.052 --> 00:03:08.055
(imitates whale)

00:03:22.503 --> 00:03:24.705
We have standards, guys.
What do we serve stuff in?

00:03:24.805 --> 00:03:26.807
<i>Glassware, correct?</i>

00:03:26.907 --> 00:03:29.843
<i>Wouldn't it be better
to serve--
No red cups, come on!</i>

00:03:29.943 --> 00:03:30.944
(knock on door)

00:03:31.078 --> 00:03:32.646
(woman)
Housekeeping.

00:03:32.746 --> 00:03:34.348
I'll be out
in a minute!

00:03:34.448 --> 00:03:36.450
Chop, chop!

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:37.784
(man on TV)
<i>So what's going on
in the bar right now?</i>

00:03:37.885 --> 00:03:38.886
<i>Are they out of glassware?</i>

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.289
(sighs)
Good morning.

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:44.324
Late check-out?

00:03:44.424 --> 00:03:45.626
Is it?

00:03:45.726 --> 00:03:46.994
It's after 11:00.

00:03:47.094 --> 00:03:49.429
I'm going to have to
charge you for another day.

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.298
It's like five after.

00:03:51.465 --> 00:03:53.800
Should I just leave that
all on the Visa?

00:03:53.901 --> 00:03:55.469
It's me.

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:56.870
All on the Visa,
ma'am?

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.439
Yeah, I guess--

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.309
This woman is no longer
a guest at the hotel.

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:03.644
She's done.
She's done talking to you.

00:04:03.777 --> 00:04:05.445
This way, ma'am.
She's done.

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:07.714
Oh, no, no, I think she
just didn't recognize me.

00:04:07.814 --> 00:04:09.449
Wait, let me just...

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:10.717
Hi, I'm checking in.

00:04:10.817 --> 00:04:11.952
Ooh, I love
that scarf.

00:04:12.052 --> 00:04:14.054
Is that Egyptian silk?

00:04:14.087 --> 00:04:16.323
Everything about you
is just so on point.

00:04:16.456 --> 00:04:19.493
Wait, it's me!
It's me!
