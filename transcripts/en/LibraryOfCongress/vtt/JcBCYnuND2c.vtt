00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.450
&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: Hi, good
afternoon, how is everybody doing?

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:24.750
&gt;&gt; Good.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.050
&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: Great.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:27.440
I am Pam Jackson, I'm director
for the Center for the Book here

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.240 position:56%
at the Library of Congress and we
are proud to be part of the National

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.430
and International Outreach
Unit of the Library of Congress

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:35.730
and we welcome you

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.780
to this afternoon's book
talk for Books and Beyond.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.400
We have here at the Library
of Congress the mission for us

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.080
to promote, first of all, we

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.560
like to always remind people we
are the nation's first cultural

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.400
institution, and it is our mission
to provide people with a very rich,

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.270
enduring source of knowledge
that is designed to inspire

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.980 position:56%
and excite intellectual and creative
endeavors, and we certainly believe

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.810
that has been the case with today's
author, who spent time researching

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.800
in our collections the book that
he is here to discuss today,

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.170
and it's an award-winning book,

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.720
that we will mention in
just a moment or two.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.920
I'd like to mention that the
Center for the Book is focused

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.240
on making connections between
and among our networks,

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.560
and for the purpose of
reading and literacy promotion,

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.480
and using the library's
collections, programming,

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.050
resources, and contents to do so.

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.200
We believe very strongly in
promoting books and libraries

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.090
and literacy and reading for
the purpose of having informed

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.630
and engaged societies, and we like
to promote that we are focused

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.310
on making sure that he humane is in
the humanities as we do our work,

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.110 position:56%
and that is our focus for this year.

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.910
So as I mentioned that the
author researched his book here

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:49.340
at the library, and it is a
chief criteria for the books

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.270
that we promote and the
Books and Beyond Series,

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.930
that they have a connection
to the Library of Congress,

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.850
and that is either because they are
written unpublished by the Library

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.270
of Congress or about the Library
of Congress, or as a result

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.160
of using the collections
of the Library of Congress

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.310 position:56%
and we encourage our friends and
associates and members of the public

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.630
to do all of that, and are glad

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.320
to have today's author,
who has done just that.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.340
So before I introduce him, I'd like
to take this moment to remind you

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.850
if you could check your mobile
devices, make sure they're

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.290
on silent, so that they are
not a distraction and it is

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.410
because we are recording
today's talk.

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.170
And you should know in advance, the
author will share about his work,

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.080
and there will be a short Q and
A answer session at the end.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.380
So if you are participating
in that, you will be recorded

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.710
and a part of our webcast.

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:43.670 position:56%
Also I can mention that at
Read.gov, you can find more than 250

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.680
of our videos of author talks
and activities and events

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:48.980
that we've had here at the library.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.520
It's a very rich collection
unto itself,

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.270
and we encourage you to
explore that as well.

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.670
Also the book is for sale, outside,

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.900
and after our session there
will be a short book signing.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.250
And we'd like to remind you
that is available, both the sale

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.440
and the purchase here, and then
the book signing over here.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.930
So today's author is Larrie
Ferreiro, and he teaches History

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.740
and Engineering at George
Mason University in Fairfax.

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:18.800
And at the Stevens Institute
of Technology in New Jersey.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.640 position:56%
And he served for more than 35
years in the U.S. Navy, Coast Guard,

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:24.970
and Department of Defense,

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.030
and was an exchange
engineer in the French Navy.

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.380
He has a PhD in the History of
Science, from Imperial College

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.460
of London, and his other books
include Measure of the Earth,

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.590
The Enlightenment Expedition
That Shaped Our World.

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.990
Now his new book is what he
is here to talk to us about,

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:44.230
Brothers at Arms: American
Independence and the Men

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.900
of France and Spain Who Saved It.

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.290
And did I say that right?

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.290
Yeah, and the men of France
and Spain Who Saved It.

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.520
And it's a remarkable, untold story

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.900
of the American Revolution's
success, and how it depended

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.590 position:56%
on a substantial military assistance
provided by France and Spain

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:04.950
that some of us may not know about

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.650
or be present to some
of the details.

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.980
So we are excited to
have him here today.

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.060
We have learned that the book
is a winner of the Journal

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.300 position:56%
of the American Revolution 2016 Book
of the Year Award, and as recently

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:21.240
as yesterday we also learned that
this book, it's a fabulous piece,

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:25.020
has received the Pulitzer Prize
Finalist Award in History.

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.820
So congratulations
[applause begins] and welcome!

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.040
[ Applause ]

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.340
&gt;&gt; Larrie Ferreiro:
Pulitzer Prize finalist...

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:32.640
&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: Pulitzer
Prize Finalist.

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:33.940
&gt;&gt; Larrie Ferreiro:
Didn't get the award.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.240
&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: Didn't
get the award.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.540
&gt;&gt; Larrie Ferreiro: Yeah.

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:37.840
&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: Thank you so much
for joining us, please welcome.

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.140 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Larrie Ferreiro: It's a pleasure.

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:40.440
[ Applause ]

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.740
&gt;&gt; Larrie Ferreiro: And the
Library of Congress has a,

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.710 position:56%
among many other things, a fantastic
collection of correspondence,

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:52.010
copies of correspondence, between
many of the major actors in France

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:55.890
and Spain, and then their
American interlocutors,

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:01.870
which was a significant source
for much of my research.

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:10.980
So in 1776, America was fighting
Britain in a war for independence,

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.520
but without a Navy,
without artillery,

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.760
and even without gunpowder.

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:19.880
And only France and Spain, who were
the historical enemies of Britain,

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:23.880
had both the motive and the
Naval and military strength

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.600
to be able to defeat the British.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.290
So we needed their alliance.

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:32.950
But they would only do so
if America was seen not

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:37.520
as fighting a civil war,
but rather as fighting a war

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.480
as an independent nation.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:43.280
John Adams, who was no fan
of foreign interventions,

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:47.890
said foreign powers could not
be expected to acknowledge us,

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:51.870
until we had acknowledged
ourselves as an independent nation.

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:57.700
And Thomas Jefferson had said
during the debates over the writing

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.140
of the Declaration, the Declaration

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:05.830
of Independence alone could allow
European powers to treat with us.

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:09.980
So the Declaration was not
written for King George the Third.

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:11.620
He had already gotten
the memo [laughter].

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:17.570
He actually said in October the
previous year that the fighting

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:23.220
in Lexington, Concord, and
elsewhere, was specifically aimed

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:25.830
at making America an
independent nation.

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:29.580
So he already understood
that, and the Americans knew.

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:33.390
The Declaration wasn't written
for the American people.

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:38.630
They had sent their delegates to
Philadelphia quite specifically

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:47.000
to declare for independence, and to
write a written declaration of such

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.810
which had never been
done before in the world.

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:55.710 position:56%
If you wanted to become independent,
you fought a war, you won,

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:57.700
and you were independent.

00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:59.880
No declaration needed.

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:02.930
So the Declaration of
Independence was, in fact,

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:07.000
an engraved invitation
asking France and Spain

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.730
to come fight alongside us.

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:13.030
Which is why I say in the book that
it was not just the Declaration

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:15.430
of Independence, it was
also the declaration

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:17.360
that we depend on France.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.930
And Spain too.

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:22.230
Now, the Americans knew that France

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:26.010
and Spain wanted a
rematch with Great Britain.

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:30.750
They come out very badly in the
Seven Years War, which had ended

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:35.920
against Britain in 1763, with
France losing Canada to Britain,

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:38.410
and Spain losing Florida.

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:41.820
Now, France and Spain were
already closely allied

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:43.880
by family and military ties.

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:49.390
It was called the Bourbon Family
Compact, the two kings were,

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:53.120
in fact, directly descended
from Louis the Fourteenth.

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:57.300 position:56%
Both nations wanted revenge, [French
word spoken], against Britain.

00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:01.220
And that was actually what
they called the policy.

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:03.410
But they had different goals.

00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:08.050
France wanted to regain the
balance of power in Europe.

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:11.450
Spain wanted to regain Gibraltar,

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:15.460
and drive the British
from the Gulf of Mexico.

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:20.370 position:56%
And both nations had predicted the
American Revolution long before many

00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:23.710
Americans even knew
that it would happen.

00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:26.430
You can see the quote
from the Duc de Choiseul,

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:30.710
who was the French
Foreign Minister in 1767.

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:34.220
Only the future American
Revolution will consign England

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:36.300
to a state of weakness.

00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:39.020
That isn't an "if"
statement, that's a "when."

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:43.500
Because they knew that
this future revolt

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:46.580
in the American colonies
would weaken Britain.

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:50.280
Because of that, they sent
spies and observers to America,

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:53.430
people like the Baron de Kalb
[phonetic spelling] to see

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:55.780
when that would happen
because they wanted to make use

00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:58.460
of that revolution when it happened

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:01.990
to further their own aims
of weakening Britain.

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:05.650
That revolution would not
happen for another eight years.

00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:10.170
When the fighting began in 1775,
the British Army was supplied

00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:12.980
by gun factories which
would turn out hundreds

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:15.290
of thousands of guns per year.

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:16.660
The few American gunsmiths

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:22.130
that there were could produce
perhaps one gun per month.

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:26.980
We needed weapons from France and
Spain, and France and Spain did,

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:31.060
indeed, provide arms to the
insurgents, but they used merchants

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:35.740
like the Diego de Gardoqui, and
Pierre Carron de Beaumarchais,

00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:40.050
as front men to disguise the
source of the arms which were

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:45.030
from the British, sorry from the
French and the Spanish governments.

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:48.980
But the British were not fooled.

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:55.190
In the end, over 90% of all the
guns used in the conflict came

00:09:55.190 --> 00:10:01.760 position:56%
from overseas, France and Spain, who
also provided 30 billion, with a B,

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:04.920
dollars, equivalent
in aid during the war.

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:11.320
And that doesn't count the other
parts that they helped us with,

00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:14.640
which I will get to in a minute.

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:17.020
Beaumarchais worked with
Cyalstine [phonetic spelling],

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:21.990 position:56%
who was the American envoy in Paris,
to negotiate a contract for arms,

00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:25.550
and he was doing so even
before news of the Declaration

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:28.660
of Independence had reached
the shores of France.

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:35.670
In 1776 and 1777, five
Beaumarchais ships carried arms

00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:42.820
across the Atlantic to supply
15,000 American troops who arrayed

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:46.680
to meet Burgoyne at Saratoga.

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:49.660
And it was these French arms
that turned the tide of battle.

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:51.910
And you can see this
quote from somebody

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:55.480
who knew what he was talking about,
because he was at the battle.

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:57.270
Caleb Stark.

00:10:57.270 --> 00:11:01.400
Unless these Beaumarchais arms
had been thus timely furnished

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:06.880
to the Americans, Burgoyne would
have made an easy march to Albany,

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:10.820
and that victory at Saratoga
turned the tide of the war,

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:12.950
because it was the
first major victory

00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:15.250
that the Americans
had in the entire war.

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:20.820
Meanwhile, most of the French
and European volunteers who came

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:23.950
to the United States
came to do so in order

00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:27.650
to fight their longtime
enemies, the British.

00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:31.410
But along the way, they made
the American cause their own,

00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:35.010
and George Washington came to
depend upon these immigrants

00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:38.470
who got the job done,
as the Hamilton musical

00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:42.320
so aptly describes [laughter].

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:46.110
Luis Lebegue Duportail [phonetic
spelling] became Washington's Chief

00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:48.470
Engineer, and Chief Strategist,

00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:52.570
and planned the fortifications
and sieges.

00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:57.780
Baron von Steuben put together the
training plan for George Washington

00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:02.760
that made the Continental Army,
previously a collection of militia,

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:06.850
into a consolidated
professional fighting force.

00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:10.220
And, of course, the Marquis
de Lafayette commanded troops

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:11.800
in the southern theater.

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:14.710
He kept Cornwallis
from coming north,

00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:18.100
and he eventually followed
Cornwallis all the way to Yorktown.

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:23.380
Now, the Battle of Brandywine
in 1777 was Washington's attempt

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:27.070 position:56%
to prevent the British from
occupying the capitol, Philadelphia.

00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:30.160
But it also was the trial
by fire for these French

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:33.360
and European volunteers,
who up until that point,

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:35.720
had been mistrusted
by the Americans.

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:40.880
Remember, they had just finished
fighting the French just a decade

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:47.010
earlier, so that would explain
comments like Nathanael Green,

00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:48.930
so many spies in our camp.

00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:56.350
The Battle of Brandywine changed
all that, and it certainly proved

00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:58.130
that they were not spies.

00:12:58.130 --> 00:13:03.050
In fact, they were very brave
and courageous fighters.

00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:06.780
The Polish officer,
Pulaski, led a cavalry charge

00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:10.370
that saved the Continental
troops in retreat.

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:12.560
Fleury [phonetic spelling],
who was an engineer,

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:16.840 position:56%
was commended for particular
bravery, and in fact, the Army Corps

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:20.140
of Engineers today now
has the Fleury Medal

00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:23.940
for courage and boldness.

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:28.630
And Lafayette himself was wounded
while leading an infantry charge,

00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:32.610
and George Washington commanded
his own doctor to treat him

00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:34.480
as if "he were my own son."

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:41.410
So after the Battle of Brandywine,
that initial distrust changed

00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:46.430
and turned first into
acceptance, and then into reliance.

00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:52.130
For Greene, so many spies in our
camp relied heavily on both Steuben

00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:56.490
and Lafayette during
his southern campaign.

00:13:56.490 --> 00:14:02.410
Back at Versailles, and the first
season on Ovation has now ended,

00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:05.640
but I think you can still
see it probably on Netflix,

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:10.690
season two should be starting
soon, back at Versailles,

00:14:10.690 --> 00:14:13.740
the French Foreign Minister,
the Comte de Vergennes,

00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:18.770
was the single most important
character in this entire story,

00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:23.810
because he and he alone made
almost all of the key decisions

00:14:23.810 --> 00:14:26.960
that affected the alliance between
the Americans and the French,

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:28.790
and almost all the key decisions

00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:31.170
that affected the outcome
of the war.

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:35.510
Now, his primary goal, as I'd
mentioned, was the have the war

00:14:35.510 --> 00:14:39.130
of American independence
sufficiently weaken Britain,

00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:43.870 position:56%
so that the European balance of
power tilted back in France's favor,

00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:47.360
and he had already decided
to ally with the Americans,

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:50.500
even before the Battle of Saratoga.

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:54.920
Because having provided
arms to the Americans,

00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:59.860
and seeing that they had far
more defeats than victories.

00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:02.330
He was afraid, in fact,
he was certain

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:05.080
that the Americans
would lose the war.

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:10.370
And the thought of a reunited
British empire in North America,

00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:12.370
which could threaten the
French sugar colonies,

00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:16.910
and that is where the money was,
the plantations in the Caribbean,

00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:20.000
that thought was unsupportable.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.660 position:56%
So, the American victory at
Saratoga did not convince the French

00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:25.990
to ally with the Americans.

00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:30.500
It simply gave Vergennes the
pretext he needed to carry

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:33.370
out the decision he
had already made.

00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:37.490
Now, that treaty which was signed
in 1778 effectively brought France

00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:42.490
into the war against Britain,
and it brought the French Navy

00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:45.720
to American shores,
and that was key.

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:48.820
Because any battle with Britain
at that time was always going

00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:52.990
to be a Naval, sorry, any war
with Britain, at that time,

00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:56.040
was always going to be a
Naval war, because that is

00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:58.460
where Britain's strength was.

00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:00.980
Having the French Navy on
the American shores meant,

00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:06.120 position:56%
for the first time, that the British
could not at their will move troops

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:12.810
from place to place, resupply
them, redeploy arms and munitions.

00:16:12.810 --> 00:16:18.250
It is the reason why the British
had to evacuate Philadelphia,

00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:19.800
after only being there nine months,

00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:24.290
because they could not risk being
bottled up by the French Navy,

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:26.910
and have to consolidate their
troops in New York City.

00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:33.260
Now, at this time, as I mentioned,
Spain was allied with France,

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:36.220
but they could not take
the risk of going to war

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:39.790
against Britain in early 1778.

00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:44.010
Now, the reason is that they had
a treasure fleet still at sea.

00:16:44.010 --> 00:16:48.010
It was carrying 50
billion, with a B, dollars,

00:16:48.010 --> 00:16:51.220
equivalent in silver from Peru.

00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:54.300
And until that silver
was safely home,

00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:57.680
they could not risk
having the British predate

00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:01.320
on the convoy and capture it.

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:04.340
It was not until the end of 1778

00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:08.330
when the treasure fleet was
safely home that Spain was free

00:17:08.330 --> 00:17:10.880
to go to war with Britain.

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:13.810
Vergennes counterpart, the
Spanish Foreign Minister

00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:17.500
of the Conde de Floridablanca,
had established the Spanish goals

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:20.650 position:56%
of the war, as recovering Gibraltar,

00:17:20.650 --> 00:17:24.380
and driving the British
from the Gulf of Mexico.

00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:28.520
And right after the Treaty
of 1778, between the French

00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:34.030
and the Americans, which brought
France into war against Britain,

00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:40.060
Spain offered to mediate between
France and Britain, provided,

00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:43.400
provided they got Gibraltar.

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:44.700
But Britain refused.

00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:48.760
Now, Floridablanca, in
one of his usual tirades,

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:53.020
considered Gibraltar just this pile
of rocks, which causes problems.

00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:56.750
But for the British, Gibraltar
was a strategic outpost

00:17:56.750 --> 00:18:01.210
that guarded the entrance to the
Mediterranean or to the Atlantic,

00:18:01.210 --> 00:18:07.690
depending upon your point of view,
and for that strategic importance,

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:11.970
Britain, that pile of
rocks called Gibraltar,

00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:15.770
Britain effectively
sacrificed all of America

00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:19.470
for that strategic
outpost of Gibraltar.

00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:26.790
Now, with Britain unwilling to
negotiate, Spain agreed to go

00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:28.800
into the war alongside France.

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:34.330 position:56%
They would not ally directly with
the Americans for their own reasons,

00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:37.950
but they agreed that
the war could not end

00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:44.370 position:56%
until Britain had recognized the
United States as a sovereign nation.

00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:52.100
The entry of Spain into
the war, alongside France,

00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:55.430
fundamentally changed
the nature of the war.

00:18:55.430 --> 00:19:01.150
From a regional conflict in
North America, to a global war.

00:19:01.150 --> 00:19:06.210
And the reason was, is that the
British Navy and the British Army

00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:12.150 position:56%
to some extent, now had to be
spread far thinner around the globe,

00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:16.410
and it was because the
combined Navy of France

00:19:16.410 --> 00:19:18.790
and Spain were overwhelming.

00:19:18.790 --> 00:19:21.990
By itself, the French Navy could
not hope to defeat Britain.

00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:24.300
By itself, the Spanish
Navy could not.

00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:29.520
But together, the Bourbon Fleet
was 124 ships of the line,

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:32.380
those were the major
warships that fought battles,

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:38.930
against Britain's 95 ships, and
Britain was simply overwhelmed.

00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:42.980
So, instead of just attacking
the Americans in North America,

00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:46.140
the British now had
to shield England

00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:49.680
from an invasion by
France and Spain.

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:53.040
They had to defend against
the siege of Gibraltar.

00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:56.630
They had to defend their colonies
in the Caribbean, their colonies

00:19:56.630 --> 00:20:03.900
in South Africa, their
colonies in India, from attack.

00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:07.640
All of this was happening
in 1779 and 1780,

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:11.450
as the war in the Americas was
coming to its lowest point,

00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:15.920
and you can see from Alexander
Hamilton's despondent comment,

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:19.570
"If we are saved, France
and Spain must save us."

00:20:19.570 --> 00:20:21.950
That the Americans now understood

00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:28.150
that winning the war rested
with France and Spain.

00:20:28.150 --> 00:20:31.920
Now, the invasion of
Britain was going

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:34.730
to be always the centerpiece
of the Bourbon strategy.

00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:41.700 position:56%
After Spain had declared war in
1779, the two nations formed a fleet

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:46.850
of 150 ships, and 30,000
troops to invade Britain.

00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:52.340
That was larger even than the
famous Spanish Armada of 1588.

00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:56.400 position:56%
Now, the planned invasion of Britain
was going to capture Portsmouth

00:20:56.400 --> 00:21:01.270
and Southampton, it was going to
wreak havoc on the British economy,

00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:04.520
and then potentially bring
Britain to the peace table.

00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:11.600
But that expedition was sidelined
by a massive dysentery outbreak,

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:19.550
which laid low 8,000 men, and which
the French Admiral's son died.

00:21:19.550 --> 00:21:22.780
The Spanish Admiral, because the
French Admiral was, after that,

00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:26.650
incapable of carrying out
orders, the Spanish Admiral,

00:21:26.650 --> 00:21:32.760 position:56%
Luis de Cordova, also tried but with
this many people sick and dying,

00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:39.310 position:56%
he was unable to carry out the
invasion, and it simply fizzled out.

00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:45.030
Now, as a side note to this massive
invasion, as part of the planning,

00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:49.700 position:56%
the French Navy asked this
relatively unknown American captain,

00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:52.760
John Paul Jones, to create
a diversion for the British

00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:56.310
by sailing a small squadron
around the British Isles,

00:21:56.310 --> 00:22:01.040
and capture some merchant
ships, hoping that some

00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:04.840
of the British Admirals might
follow him and be diverted.

00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:12.040
Now, no British admiral was foolish
enough to follow John Paul Jones,

00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:15.280
and his diversion was
largely ignored.

00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:18.640
Certainly, it played no part
in the outcome of the battle.

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:22.560
It certainly did not cause anything
like a panic within Britain,

00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:28.630
but there was a battle that
occurred off of Flamborough Head,

00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:33.210
in which John Paul Jones' small
frigate, the Bonhomme Richard,

00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:38.080
was able to defeat a much
larger British frigate,

00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:41.300
which was guarding a
convoy, the Serapis.

00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:44.880
The commander of Serapis
was knighted,

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:47.950
because he did his job,
he protected the convoy.

00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:53.120
The convoy escaped, and a good
British commander was going

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:57.200
to fight his ship until
death to protect the convoy.

00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:01.840
But, for the Americans,
this was a striking moment

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:04.860
of David vs. Goliath, which stood

00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:09.770
in for the much larger
British and American conflict.

00:23:09.770 --> 00:23:14.250
At that time, it was a sorely
needed shot in the arm.

00:23:14.250 --> 00:23:20.750
Now, back in New Orleans,
Bernardo de Galvez was the Governor

00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:22.990
of Spanish Louisiana.

00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:26.780
Now, for those of you who
work here in the Congress

00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:30.120
or are frequent visitors to the
Congress, you might recognize

00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:32.190
that portrait on the left.

00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:38.320
Because a copy of that portrait was
hung in the year 2014 at the event

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:44.510 position:56%
of his becoming an honorary
American citizen in the Senate Wing,

00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:50.280 position:56%
first floor, in front of the Foreign
Relations Committee Room, Room S116,

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:52.870
which is all the way on the north
side in case you want to find it.

00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:55.840
So if you want to write that
down [laughter], Room S116,

00:23:55.840 --> 00:24:03.460
Foreign Relations Committee,
North side, Senate Wing.

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:07.330
Galvez had supplied American
troops in the Western theater,

00:24:07.330 --> 00:24:09.810
which was up along the Mississippi,

00:24:09.810 --> 00:24:13.140
all the way to Fort Pitt,
which is not Pittsburgh.

00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:14.440
He supplied them with money.

00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:17.600
He supplied them with arms,
with munitions, with gunpowder.

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:25.100 position:56%
But when Spain declared war in 1779,
he immediately launched a series

00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:28.880
of lightening attacks that
captured the British post

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:32.610
at Mobile, Nachez, and Baton Rouge.

00:24:32.610 --> 00:24:37.830
And then, after several hurricanes
had set him back, in 1781,

00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:43.070
he commanded a joint Spanish-French
force, that captured Pensacola,

00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:46.910
which was the British
capitol of West Florida.

00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:53.500 position:56%
So with Britain out of West Florida,
Spain now ruled the Gulf of Mexico

00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:56.170
and Britain was no longer a threat.

00:24:56.170 --> 00:25:01.040
And because they were no longer a
threat, when a French Naval force,

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:04.990
under the command of the Comte
de Grasse arrived shortly

00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:10.220
after that battle of Pensacola,
he asked the Spanish Navy

00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:14.680
to protect the French colonies,
which was his primary job,

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:16.760
while he took his entire fleet

00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:21.460
for a short trip northward,
to the Chesapeake Bay.

00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:26.490
So it was because of the Battle of
Pensacola that de Grasse was able

00:25:26.490 --> 00:25:33.510
to take his entire fleet north
for the actions that would occur.

00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:35.720
Washington and Rochambeau
had learned

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:38.940
that the Comte de Grasse
was going to the Chesapeake,

00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:42.740
so they raced south from
New York to meet him,

00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:46.090
in order to surround
Cornwallis at Yorktown.

00:25:46.090 --> 00:25:48.700
The Comte de Grasse was a
fighting admiral who was beloved

00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:51.580
by his sailors, and
they said of him,

00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:53.910
the Comte de Grasse
stands six foot four,

00:25:53.910 --> 00:25:57.130 position:56%
and six foot five on days of battle.

00:25:57.130 --> 00:26:03.370 position:56%
And yes, since you asked [laughter],
he was one of the ancestors

00:26:03.370 --> 00:26:06.680
of that Rockstar astrophysicist...

00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:07.980
&gt;&gt; Neil-

00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:10.580
&gt;&gt; Larrie Ferreiro: Neil de Grasse
Tyson, that's correct [laughter].

00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:15.010
Now, when the Comte de
Grasse met George Washington

00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:16.410
on his Quarterdeck, and by the way,

00:26:16.410 --> 00:26:21.620
George Washington stood two
inches shorter than de Grasse,

00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:25.720
de Grasse embraced Washington and
exclaimed, "Mon petit General!"

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:29.380
[laughter].

00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:32.440
De Grasse's fleet was
landing troops around Yorktown

00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:36.020
when the British fleet, under
Thomas Graves, appeared.

00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:40.260 position:56%
De Grasse quickly sortied his entire
fleet from the Chesapeake Bay,

00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:43.860
and fought off Graves, which
prevented him from resupplying

00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:47.840
or evacuating Cornwallis, and
again, to underline the point,

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:49.700
it is not clear he would have won

00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:54.870
that battle had he not had
his entire fleet with him.

00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:59.260
The fact that Thomas Graves could
not enter the Chesapeake sealed the

00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:02.320
fate of the British
Army at Yorktown.

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:06.880
Now, the story of Yorktown
is very well-known.

00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:11.120
After Rochambeau and Washington had
led their troops on a quick march

00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:15.180
from New York to Yorktown,
they surrounded Cornwallis.

00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:19.390
The siege began October 9, 1781.

00:27:19.390 --> 00:27:24.620
The guns blasted away for five days
while the siege lines advanced.

00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:27.220
French officers directed the siege.

00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:30.610
French officers directed the
placement of the trenches.

00:27:30.610 --> 00:27:33.820
French officers directed
the gunfire.

00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:39.210
The French also suffered twice
the casualties of the Americans.

00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:43.790
Once the French and American troops
had captured British readouts 9

00:27:43.790 --> 00:27:48.310
and 10, the situation for
Cornwallis was untenable.

00:27:48.310 --> 00:27:52.440
So when Brigadier General Charles
O'Hara, who was Cornwallis' second

00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:57.490
in command, came out to offer
the surrender, he saw the victory

00:27:57.490 --> 00:28:01.820
as a French one, and he offered
the surrender to Rochambeau.

00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:05.580
Now, Rochambeau knew it
was a French victory,

00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:12.050 position:56%
but he also knew the moment belonged
to Washington, so, without a word,

00:28:12.050 --> 00:28:14.880
Rochambeau directed
O'Hara to Washington.

00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:18.270
Washington was not going to
take a surrender, or rather,

00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:22.980
accept a surrender, from someone
else's second in command, so he,

00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:28.120 position:56%
in turn, gestured O'Hara to his own
second in command, Benjamin Lincoln,

00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:32.740 position:56%
who then accepted the surrender,
and the battle of Yorktown was over.

00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:38.240
Now, the battle of Yorktown
was over, but that didn't mean

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:40.820
that the war had come to an end.

00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:44.260
Vergennes fully understood that,
it is not in the English character

00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:47.410
to give up so easily,
he told Lafayette.

00:28:47.410 --> 00:28:51.720
But even though there were no
more major battles in America,

00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:55.260
after Yorktown, and there
were a number of skirmishes,

00:28:56.270 --> 00:28:59.470
the fighting continued around
the world between Britain

00:28:59.470 --> 00:29:01.700
and the Bourbon Alliance.

00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:09.040
By this time, 1781, Britain was
fighting five separate nations,

00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:11.030
without an ally to its name.

00:29:11.030 --> 00:29:12.880
They were overwhelmed.

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:16.720 position:56%
You can see the different conflicts.

00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:18.140
The assault on Gibraltar.

00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:24.570
The siege of Gibraltar absorbed
60,000 Spanish troops alone

00:29:24.570 --> 00:29:28.430
in a four-year siege that
ultimately failed, and yes,

00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:30.930
that is a mushroom
cloud over Gibraltar,

00:29:30.930 --> 00:29:34.460
that is how violent the battle was.

00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:39.920
The Dutch Republic was also drawn
into the war for allowing supplies

00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:45.850
to go to France, and the
Anglo-Dutch War was very violent.

00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:49.670
France had allied with the
Kingdom of Mysor in India,

00:29:49.670 --> 00:29:54.050 position:56%
in order to drive the British East
India company from the subcontinent.

00:29:54.050 --> 00:29:58.470
That also failed, and the
battles were also violent.

00:29:58.470 --> 00:30:01.910
And in fact, the last
major battle of the war

00:30:01.910 --> 00:30:05.500
of American independence
was the battle of Cuddalore,

00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:08.660
fought in India, and
that happened six months

00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:10.270
after the preliminary peace
treaties had been signed.

00:30:10.270 --> 00:30:20.770
The peace of 1783 ended eight
years of war, and during that time,

00:30:20.770 --> 00:30:27.380
200,000 French and Spanish soldiers
and sailors fought in the war,

00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:33.240
compared with an estimated
250,000 to 380,000 Americans.

00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:36.920
France and Spain were as in
vested in this war as we were.

00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:41.730
America could never have
won the war without France.

00:30:41.730 --> 00:30:45.070
France could never have
fought the war without Spain.

00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:49.210
So, what I want all of you to take
away from this is the following.

00:30:49.210 --> 00:30:53.890
The United States did not
achieve independence by itself.

00:30:53.890 --> 00:30:56.480
It was, in fact, born
as the centerpiece

00:30:56.480 --> 00:31:00.290
of an international
coalition, which worked together

00:31:00.290 --> 00:31:05.810 position:56%
to defeat a common adversary, and it
is America's role as the centerpiece

00:31:05.810 --> 00:31:08.590
of international efforts
for a common good

00:31:08.590 --> 00:31:13.440
that continues even today
to define the United States

00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:14.780
as the indispensable nation.

00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:16.580
Thank you.

00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:23.170
[ Applause ]

00:31:23.170 --> 00:31:25.230
&gt;&gt; I'll take questions,
but I wasn't certain

00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:28.410
if the people asking the questions
needed to have a microphone?

00:31:28.410 --> 00:31:29.910
&gt;&gt; No, but if you could
repeat the questions?

00:31:29.910 --> 00:31:32.200
&gt;&gt; Larrie Ferreiro: I will,
and if I forget, remind me.

00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:35.930
So I-go ahead.

00:31:35.930 --> 00:31:38.140
&gt;&gt; Larrie, it's marvelous,
I look forward to the book.

00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:42.110
You mentioned in passing that
the Spanish did not ally directly

00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:45.460
with the United States, what was
the Spanish thinking on that?

00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:47.950
&gt;&gt; Larrie Ferreiro: Both
France and Spain had colonies

00:31:47.950 --> 00:31:53.930
and possessions just as Britain
did, and they were also monarchies.

00:31:53.930 --> 00:31:59.680 position:56%
They did not want the example of the
United States successfully rebelling

00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:05.600 position:56%
against its colonial masters to
somehow seep into the consciousness.

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:07.710
France was always a
little bit reluctant,

00:32:07.710 --> 00:32:09.910
but Spain had far more to lose.

00:32:09.910 --> 00:32:15.580
They owned almost all
of the Americas south

00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:19.460
of really what we would
call today, you know,

00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:22.780
West of the Mississippi,
and all the way south.

00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:29.860
I'm not trying to give Brazil short
drift, I assure you [laughter],

00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:35.990
and they were constantly on guard,
because during over 200 years

00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:39.250
of occupation from the 1530s is

00:32:39.250 --> 00:32:44.320
when they really began
[coughs] the conquest that led

00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:48.770
to the different Spanish
empires, and vice royalties.

00:32:48.770 --> 00:32:52.630
They had major uprisings,
about every 10 years or so.

00:32:52.630 --> 00:32:56.930
There were usually uprisings
by the indigenous nations,

00:32:56.930 --> 00:33:03.830
against quite severe abuses, and
they were put down very violently.

00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:07.180
In fact, during the time
of the battle of Pensacola,

00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:11.550
there was an uprising in
central, what is today Peru,

00:33:11.550 --> 00:33:18.460
by Tupec Hamaru [phonetic
spelling], and it was brutal.

00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:23.750
And I really would prefer not to
describe how and why it was brutal,

00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:27.030
but that particular uprising
was one of the worst.

00:33:27.030 --> 00:33:31.970
And again, you know, quite,
the Spanish were quite firm

00:33:31.970 --> 00:33:35.920 position:56%
that they did not want to see
anything that looked like, you know,

00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:38.480
an overthrow of their own monarchy.

00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:42.740
It didn't help, because 30 years
later, what I can tell you is,

00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:48.990
from 1776, when basically
three nations occupied most

00:33:48.990 --> 00:34:01.870 position:56%
of the Americas, France, Portugal,
France, Britain, Spain and Portugal,

00:34:01.870 --> 00:34:07.710
35 or 40 years later, it was the
home to over 25 independent nations

00:34:07.710 --> 00:34:10.360
which had broken the
shackles, and were now free.

00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:13.450
So that was what happened
starting in 1776.

00:34:13.450 --> 00:34:14.750
Does that help?

00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:17.050
&gt;&gt; Great.

00:34:19.210 --> 00:34:20.510
&gt;&gt; Larrie Ferreiro: Ma'am?

00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:22.550
&gt;&gt; With your research,
I'm wondering,

00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:27.490 position:56%
did you come across any
information that would be surprising

00:34:27.490 --> 00:34:32.010
to most mainstream U.S. citizens,

00:34:32.010 --> 00:34:35.350
who grew up on generic
American history?

00:34:35.350 --> 00:34:37.900
&gt;&gt; Larrie Ferreiro: So the question
was, what would come as a surprise

00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:44.290
to somebody who had read the
textbooks of their youth,

00:34:44.290 --> 00:34:46.590
and the answer is everything
[laughter].

00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:52.340
You know, let me tell you just
a tiny bit about the genesis.

00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:55.800
My doctorate is History of Science,
and I was studying the science

00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:59.580 position:56%
of ship building in the age of sail,
and learned that France and Spain,

00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:03.820
during this time, had combined
forces, traded engineers,

00:35:03.820 --> 00:35:08.930
and shipbuilders to create a single
navy in order to defeat Britain,

00:35:08.930 --> 00:35:11.860
and it was that navy that was
then employed during the war

00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:15.960
of American independence to,
you know, to become victorious.

00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:17.260
So I knew this.

00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:19.850 position:56%
And when my children were in school,

00:35:19.850 --> 00:35:24.620
the French nation was
barely mentioned.

00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:27.780
Spain certainly got no mention
at all, and I began to wonder,

00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:31.220
why is there such a gap
between what I know to be true,

00:35:31.220 --> 00:35:34.500
and what is usually taught.

00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:38.290
Now, I actually go into some
detail toward the end of the book,

00:35:38.290 --> 00:35:41.490
which I encourage you to
buy, by the way [laughter],

00:35:41.490 --> 00:35:44.690
to that explains why I
think that was the case,

00:35:44.690 --> 00:35:50.630
and the short answer is,
there was a long history

00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:56.880
of American exceptionalism that
began in the Manifest Destiny idea

00:35:56.880 --> 00:36:03.250
of pushing westward,
kind of 1830s, 1840s,

00:36:03.250 --> 00:36:06.230
and then just kept
moving, and I explain why.

00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:10.610
So, when I decided I was going
to, that there was a book there,

00:36:10.610 --> 00:36:15.640
and after I had finished schlepping
my kids up and down battlefields

00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:20.330 position:56%
and encampments [laughter],
Ticonderoga, Valley Forge, Saratoga,

00:36:20.330 --> 00:36:23.500
explaining about the
Seven Years War to them,

00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:25.900
which was by the way
a very effective way

00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:27.420
of putting small children to sleep,

00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:30.810
and I [laughter] this
is absolutely true.

00:36:30.810 --> 00:36:36.470
I decided I would nail my colors
to the mast, and the title,

00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:39.870
the subtitle, rather, says it all:
American Independence and the Men

00:36:39.870 --> 00:36:43.200
of France and Spain Who Saved
It, no ifs, ands or buts.

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:47.120
So, again, your question was
what would be a surprise,

00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:49.430
and my answer is: just
about everything.

00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:52.150
Ma'am?

00:36:52.150 --> 00:36:57.820
&gt;&gt; My name is [inaudible], and
I would like to get your advice

00:36:57.820 --> 00:37:01.720
on what can we do as citizens

00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:07.750
to give Spain the recognition
that it deserves?

00:37:07.750 --> 00:37:10.470
&gt;&gt; Larrie Ferreiro: Oh, that
was a lob pitch [laughter],

00:37:10.470 --> 00:37:13.290
the question was what can we do

00:37:13.290 --> 00:37:16.730
to give Spain the recognition
that it deserves?

00:37:16.730 --> 00:37:19.900
Do you want to introduce yourself?

00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:21.510
Theresa? No?

00:37:21.510 --> 00:37:26.400
Okay, I will-the portrait
you saw there is largely due

00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:33.110
to the actions of people
like Teresa.

00:37:33.110 --> 00:37:40.260
The lob is buy this book [laughter]
because it explains probably

00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:44.310
in more detail than almost
any that I've seen to date,

00:37:44.310 --> 00:37:50.820
just how vital the Spanish,
not just contribution,

00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:57.990
but the way Spain was
integrally involved in our fight

00:37:57.990 --> 00:38:03.660
for independence, long before we
even knew it was going to begin.

00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:06.700
There are things happening
now, as I mentioned,

00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:10.280
Bernardo de Galvez
has been recognized

00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:15.590
as an honorary American citizen,
I am not completely certain he,

00:38:15.590 --> 00:38:18.000
himself, would have agreed.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.170
Because he was always
fighting for Spain.

00:38:20.170 --> 00:38:23.300 position:56%
He was very happy that the Americans
were going to become independent,

00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:26.010
but let me be very clear.

00:38:26.010 --> 00:38:31.010
Galvez, Rochambeau, to
some extent, Lafayette,

00:38:31.010 --> 00:38:34.360
and all of the other people I
was speaking to, speaking about,

00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:39.740
always fought for their country's
interest, and there is no,

00:38:39.740 --> 00:38:42.770
there is nothing negative
to say about that.

00:38:42.770 --> 00:38:47.870
Because if you commit to
helping another nation in war,

00:38:47.870 --> 00:38:50.850
and you're committing your own
troops and your own resources,

00:38:50.850 --> 00:38:52.840
it had better be in your
own national interest.

00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:58.850
No leader worthy of her or his
name commits his nation to go

00:38:58.850 --> 00:39:00.370
to war alongside another one,

00:39:00.370 --> 00:39:02.970
unless it is in that
country's direct interest.

00:39:02.970 --> 00:39:05.280
So they always had their
own direct interest in mind.

00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:09.240
Now, that is something
else that perhaps is lost.

00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:11.940
When you read about
French participation,

00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:17.560
or more Spanish participation, but
we don't go and help our allies.

00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:24.890 position:56%
We certainly are on the eve of World
War I Centennial, and we did not go

00:39:24.890 --> 00:39:30.600
over to help France and the allied
nations against the central powers

00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:32.900
because we felt bad for them.

00:39:32.900 --> 00:39:34.200
It was in our interest.

00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:35.700
And our interests aligned.

00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:38.030
That is really how diplomacy works.

00:39:38.030 --> 00:39:43.540 position:56%
So part of the recognition for
Spain is certainly understanding why

00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:45.650
we align.

00:39:45.650 --> 00:39:49.540
We see and we have to be
able to understand clearly

00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:52.330
that alliances are
always in our interest.

00:39:52.330 --> 00:39:58.460 position:56%
America first has always meant being
able to operate with our allies

00:39:58.460 --> 00:40:01.020
in pursuit of a common good.

00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:02.320
That puts America first.

00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:08.250
The second thing is to
buy the book [laughter].

00:40:08.250 --> 00:40:13.820
But also, I think there is
a swell, in part because we

00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:15.120
as a nation are changing.

00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:16.420
We always did.

00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:18.970
We've always been a nation
not just of immigrants,

00:40:18.970 --> 00:40:22.360
but we have been a nation
that has adapted itself

00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:25.080
to the immigrant population.

00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:30.780
It is a far more complex
process than people coming

00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:33.110
to the shores, and
becoming American.

00:40:33.110 --> 00:40:36.090
We become the people who come over.

00:40:36.090 --> 00:40:39.950
So with a larger number of
people who trace their roots

00:40:39.950 --> 00:40:42.850
to the Spanish empire, I think
there is a growing realization

00:40:42.850 --> 00:40:49.090
that frankly Spain was far
before Bernardo de Galvez,

00:40:49.090 --> 00:40:53.410
far before Gardochi [phonetic
spelling], was a major force

00:40:53.410 --> 00:40:56.680
in shaping this continent,
and our people.

00:40:56.680 --> 00:40:59.810
And there are some wonderful books
I can recommend and I'd be happy

00:40:59.810 --> 00:41:02.500
to talk about it with anybody
offline, which you should buy

00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:04.820
after you buy my book [laughter].

00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:06.670
And finally, I just want
to throw out one thing.

00:41:06.670 --> 00:41:12.820
There is going to be a-- it's
under construction right now,

00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:17.090 position:56%
some of you may remember about three
years ago the French frigate replica

00:41:17.090 --> 00:41:20.940
Hermione came to the
shores of the United States,

00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:23.680
and it was promoting
the French involvement.

00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:29.100
The Spanish are building a replica
of Bernardo de Galvez's ship,

00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:33.030
which he humbly and shyly
named Galveztown [laughter]

00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:37.810
and he was always known as a
very self-effacing character,

00:41:37.810 --> 00:41:43.920
and that will be coming, I think,
to St. Augustine in the next years,

00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:49.540
as an old shipbuilder myself,
it always takes longer,

00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:51.600
and costs more than you expect.

00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:55.970
So, I hope that at least
helped a little bit.

00:41:55.970 --> 00:41:57.830
&gt;&gt; I learned New Orleneanian
[phonetic spelling],

00:41:57.830 --> 00:42:01.030
and Louisiana history in 8th grade.

00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:02.860
&gt;&gt; Larrie Ferreiro: Galvez is a...

00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:05.110
&gt;&gt; Galvez's story is
very prominently told,

00:42:05.110 --> 00:42:08.580
the story of merchants that
were smuggling supplies

00:42:08.580 --> 00:42:12.890
up the Mississippi River
to the American colonies.

00:42:12.890 --> 00:42:18.250
There is a statue, an equestrian
statue, of Galvez dedicated in 1976

00:42:18.250 --> 00:42:19.550
in front of the State Department.

00:42:19.550 --> 00:42:20.850
&gt;&gt; Larrie Ferreiro: That's correct.

00:42:20.850 --> 00:42:22.920
&gt;&gt; It was a gift of
the government of Spain

00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:25.230
when Carlos came over and...

00:42:25.230 --> 00:42:26.530
&gt;&gt; Larrie Ferreiro: Yep, yep.

00:42:26.530 --> 00:42:27.830
&gt;&gt; Dedicated the statue.

00:42:27.830 --> 00:42:29.130
&gt;&gt; Larrie Ferreiro: Yep,
it's tucked away in a corner.

00:42:29.130 --> 00:42:30.620
I'd like to see it in a
more accessible place.

00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:32.420
Has anybody been around
Lafayette Square,

00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:34.570
right in front of the White House?

00:42:34.570 --> 00:42:38.290
Okay, one of the four statues
around Lafayette Square--

00:42:38.290 --> 00:42:39.590
&gt;&gt; Rochambeau.

00:42:39.590 --> 00:42:40.890
&gt;&gt; Larrie Ferreiro: Rochambeau.

00:42:40.890 --> 00:42:42.190
&gt;&gt; Steuben.

00:42:42.190 --> 00:42:43.490
&gt;&gt; Larrie Ferreiro: Steuben.

00:42:43.490 --> 00:42:44.790
Kosciuszko.

00:42:44.790 --> 00:42:46.090
And Lafayette.

00:42:46.090 --> 00:42:47.390
And-

00:42:47.390 --> 00:42:50.260
&gt;&gt; Remember what Galvez statue was
placed in front of the White House,

00:42:50.260 --> 00:42:55.140
and the park service, and the
state department opposed it...

00:42:55.140 --> 00:42:56.740
&gt;&gt; Larrie Ferreiro: Well,
nobody asked me [laughter],

00:42:56.740 --> 00:43:00.580
but I would vote for
that, absolutely.

00:43:00.580 --> 00:43:04.370
I mean, to me, anybody occupying
the White House should be looking

00:43:04.370 --> 00:43:06.660
out on those statues
every single day

00:43:06.660 --> 00:43:10.300
and recognizing just how
involved right from the beginning,

00:43:10.300 --> 00:43:15.460
in our DNA, and RNA, and
probably several other proteins,

00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:20.000
our alliances have been, how
important our alliances have been.

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.970
So, I don't know if
that was a question,

00:43:22.970 --> 00:43:24.270
and I don't think I repeated it.

00:43:24.270 --> 00:43:25.570
&gt;&gt; Was information.

00:43:25.570 --> 00:43:26.870
&gt;&gt; Larrie Ferreiro: Okay
[laughter], so again,

00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:28.170
I think I failed the repeating
a couple of questions.

00:43:28.170 --> 00:43:29.470
My apologies.

00:43:29.470 --> 00:43:30.770
Sir?

00:43:30.770 --> 00:43:32.070
&gt;&gt; A general logistics question.

00:43:32.070 --> 00:43:36.430
How much communication did
France and Spain have directly?

00:43:36.430 --> 00:43:38.210
&gt;&gt; Larrie Ferreiro: So the question
was how much communication did

00:43:38.210 --> 00:43:40.640
France and Spain have directly?

00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:45.190
A lot. There were couriers
running between the various palaces

00:43:45.190 --> 00:43:48.200
on a regular basis, and
I tried to plot some

00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:50.660
of the time tables,
just to get an idea.

00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:55.160
The distance between
Madrid and France,

00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:57.860
on the roads, is about 800 miles.

00:43:57.860 --> 00:44:03.850
And it was not uncommon for a
courier to make that in a week.

00:44:03.850 --> 00:44:09.100
And then, a message from, and it
is a little bit more complicated,

00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:15.560
but from Versailles to,
let's say the palace

00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:16.860
at Escoriale [phonetic spelling],

00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:19.170
which was one of the
palaces they went to.

00:44:19.170 --> 00:44:21.370
They rotated palaces quite a bit.

00:44:21.370 --> 00:44:26.400
Could get back and forth
in as little as two weeks.

00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:28.670
Now, that may not seem like a
lot of time, but they're trying

00:44:28.670 --> 00:44:31.240
to make decisions on the fly.

00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:35.750
So for me, the interesting
aspect of diplomacy

00:44:35.750 --> 00:44:40.830
at that time was how often
people had to make decisions

00:44:40.830 --> 00:44:44.650
with very little or almost no
knowledge, and take guesses

00:44:44.650 --> 00:44:49.710
as to what the other side was
going to do, and for, I would say,

00:44:49.710 --> 00:44:58.620
a majority of the time, and I
don't want to say a super majority,

00:44:58.620 --> 00:45:01.920
they generally guessed at
what was going to happen.

00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:05.760
So they were quite closely
allied, and they also had,

00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:07.530
even though they had
different goals,

00:45:07.530 --> 00:45:08.970
they knew what each
other was thinking.

00:45:08.970 --> 00:45:12.700
I found that quite interesting
in the correspondence,

00:45:12.700 --> 00:45:16.080 position:56%
to say I think this is what is going
to happen, then the courier comes,

00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:18.010
and sure enough, it does.

00:45:18.010 --> 00:45:19.310
So did that answer that question?

00:45:19.310 --> 00:45:21.370
&gt;&gt; Yeah it did, and as a follow
up to that, when you're talking

00:45:21.370 --> 00:45:26.110 position:56%
about how in the Gulf of Mexico, you
know, the French were able to come

00:45:26.110 --> 00:45:29.450
up to Yorktown for that,
was that decided just there?

00:45:29.450 --> 00:45:35.100
Or did that communication have
to go all the way back to...

00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:39.760
&gt;&gt; Larrie Ferreiro: Okay, when
the main fleet left France,

00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:48.490 position:56%
in early 1781, the goal of de
Grasse was to protect the Caribbean,

00:45:48.490 --> 00:45:53.450 position:56%
and also Spain and France had
already decided that they were going

00:45:53.450 --> 00:45:55.810
to launch a major invasion
of Jamaica.

00:45:55.810 --> 00:45:59.290
Jamaica was the primary
British base.

00:45:59.290 --> 00:46:05.860
But they, and anybody
who knows the old Navy,

00:46:05.860 --> 00:46:09.340
know that very often fleets have
to operate beyond not just line

00:46:09.340 --> 00:46:11.500 position:56%
of sight, but line of communication.

00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:14.960
So it was quite common for
Navies to operate independently,

00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:18.270
and they knew the broad
strokes of what was asked for.

00:46:18.270 --> 00:46:24.350
In the case of de Grasse, he knew
that he was given a short window

00:46:24.350 --> 00:46:28.420
of time, two months, in which
he could support operations,

00:46:28.420 --> 00:46:32.700
could support Rochambeau,
who was already there.

00:46:32.700 --> 00:46:35.170
Rochambeau had arrived
the year before,

00:46:35.170 --> 00:46:36.610
in Newport, as a matter of fact.

00:46:36.610 --> 00:46:37.910
And had sat idle.

00:46:37.910 --> 00:46:40.710
They didn't know what they were
going to do because Washington

00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:43.380
and Rochambeau really
couldn't agree on a strategy.

00:46:43.380 --> 00:46:46.530
There were no good targets.

00:46:46.530 --> 00:46:50.990
They want Washington wanted to
take New York, but the logistics

00:46:50.990 --> 00:46:55.810
of trying to surround this
major city, its encampments

00:46:55.810 --> 00:46:59.020
without naval superiority,
was daunting; du Porte,

00:46:59.020 --> 00:47:02.550
who I mentioned was
one of the people who,

00:47:02.550 --> 00:47:04.900
as a trained siege engineer,

00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:07.390
could tell Washington
this is what it takes,

00:47:07.390 --> 00:47:10.420
this is what you have,
we can't do it.

00:47:10.420 --> 00:47:14.420
So everybody understood
the uncertainties,

00:47:14.420 --> 00:47:20.710
and when de Grasse knew that
he had a short window of time,

00:47:20.710 --> 00:47:23.950
he had already gotten letters
from Rochambeau, that were waiting

00:47:23.950 --> 00:47:26.610
for him in Cape François [phonetic
spelling], which is today Haiti

00:47:26.610 --> 00:47:32.010
at the time was San Doming, saying
"please come to the Chesapeake."

00:47:32.010 --> 00:47:33.890
Now, you'll have to read my book

00:47:33.890 --> 00:47:36.570
to see just how nuance this
statement was [laughter],

00:47:36.570 --> 00:47:40.770
because it was a lot more
nuance than what I just said,

00:47:40.770 --> 00:47:45.810
but he had to send a message
back and the message went on,

00:47:45.810 --> 00:47:49.570 position:56%
and as a naval architect, somebody
who designed ships, I was very happy

00:47:49.570 --> 00:47:54.040
to say that the most advanced naval
architecture went into the design

00:47:54.040 --> 00:47:56.290
of this particular frigate
[laughter], Concorde,

00:47:56.290 --> 00:48:02.920
which was a sister to Hermione,
and that ship made time back faster

00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:07.040
than it literally twice as
fast as any other sailing ship

00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:10.530
that I was able to
calculate in that era.

00:48:10.530 --> 00:48:14.690
It just got the information back
that once the information got back

00:48:14.690 --> 00:48:18.470
to Rochambeau, saying "meet
me at the Chesapeake,"

00:48:18.470 --> 00:48:22.560
it was a force march, it was fast.

00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:30.320
The Washington Rochambeau route,
which goes, I'm trying to think

00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:34.580
where it passes through D.C., it
does pass somewhere around here.

00:48:34.580 --> 00:48:36.190
&gt;&gt; There's a trail though.

00:48:36.190 --> 00:48:37.570
&gt;&gt; Larrie Ferreiro: There's
a [inaudible], which was laid

00:48:37.570 --> 00:48:40.350
out by a colleague of mine,
Bob Sellig [phonetic spelling],

00:48:40.350 --> 00:48:43.020
and he has wonderful
sites on the web

00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:46.460
where you can plot
exactly where they went.

00:48:46.460 --> 00:48:48.760
They knew exactly how to get there.

00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:53.580
They plotted out the course,
there were four sets of troops

00:48:53.580 --> 00:48:56.630
that were going to occupy
each site on consecutive days

00:48:56.630 --> 00:48:58.580
so they didn't overwhelm
the foraging.

00:48:58.580 --> 00:49:03.390
They built stoves, they
build accommodations,

00:49:03.390 --> 00:49:08.030
and the maps that the
Chief Engineer,

00:49:08.030 --> 00:49:12.350 position:56%
Berto Yea [phonetic spelling], I
think was his name, I write the book

00:49:12.350 --> 00:49:16.540
so I don't have to remember
[laughter], can today be laid

00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:22.260
over a modern map, a Google map,
and with no distortion whatsoever,

00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:26.780
you can trace exactly
where the sites were.

00:49:26.780 --> 00:49:30.410
In fact, I was down at one site
where, because of the detail

00:49:30.410 --> 00:49:32.480
of that map, they located
the foundations

00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:37.220
of several buildings [laughter],
so they had fantastic engineers.

00:49:37.220 --> 00:49:40.140
But again, let me be very clear,

00:49:40.140 --> 00:49:45.940
this is what the French army had
been doing for over 100 years.

00:49:45.940 --> 00:49:49.500
Moving troops, supplying, laying
siege, it was their business.

00:49:49.500 --> 00:49:50.960
They knew how to fight.

00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:52.680
And they fought very well.

00:49:52.680 --> 00:49:53.980
So, did that answer your question?

00:49:53.980 --> 00:49:55.280
&gt;&gt; Yes, it did.

00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:56.580
&gt;&gt; Larrie Ferreiro: Okay.

00:49:56.580 --> 00:49:57.880
Do I see a hand over?

00:49:57.880 --> 00:49:59.180
Ma'am, and then sir.

00:49:59.180 --> 00:50:02.540
&gt;&gt; I have one more
question but also a comment.

00:50:02.540 --> 00:50:09.410 position:56%
I think you've done such a great job
with this lecture, I kind of want

00:50:09.410 --> 00:50:13.860
to help you sell more books, so in
the future, perhaps you might want

00:50:13.860 --> 00:50:18.510 position:56%
to consider losing the questions
slide, and putting back up the slide

00:50:18.510 --> 00:50:21.940
with the title of your
book [laughter].

00:50:21.940 --> 00:50:24.270
&gt;&gt; Larrie Ferreiro: Okay, so
I should, I should go back

00:50:24.270 --> 00:50:27.420
to [laughter] the title of the
book [overlapping speakers].

00:50:27.420 --> 00:50:31.250
&gt;&gt; Just because I kind
of want you to,

00:50:31.250 --> 00:50:34.520
just because it should be
successful, will be more...

00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:36.160
&gt;&gt; Larrie Ferreiro: I certainly
appreciate the comment,

00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:38.150
putting this up, but I
have an ulterior motive

00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:42.070
for leaving the questions slide
there, so with your permission,

00:50:42.070 --> 00:50:43.380
I'm going to go back to this.

00:50:43.380 --> 00:50:46.730
Now, the book is, and
I'll hold it up, in fact,

00:50:46.730 --> 00:50:50.070
I'll just leave this here
as the visual [laughter],

00:50:50.070 --> 00:50:53.690
here is the visual,
and I hope that stays.

00:50:53.690 --> 00:50:57.090
Okay, so that was the
comment, leave the book up.

00:50:57.090 --> 00:50:58.660
I appreciate that.

00:50:58.660 --> 00:50:59.960
You had a question?

00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:01.690
&gt;&gt; That's even better
than my suggestion.

00:51:01.690 --> 00:51:03.160
&gt;&gt; Larrie Ferreiro:
Okay, and your question?

00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:06.920
&gt;&gt; My question was about,
I liked what you had

00:51:06.920 --> 00:51:09.170
to say about the Hermione?

00:51:09.170 --> 00:51:10.470
&gt;&gt; Larrie Ferreiro: Hermione,

00:51:10.470 --> 00:51:11.970
it is spelled her-my-oh-nee
[phonetic spelling],

00:51:11.970 --> 00:51:15.630
but too many people associate
that with Harry Potter [laughter],

00:51:15.630 --> 00:51:18.130
and the correct pronunciation is
her-me-own [phonetic spelling],

00:51:18.130 --> 00:51:21.360
so that was Lafayette's
ship, by the way.

00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:24.270
&gt;&gt; And for those of us who want
to know more about that kind

00:51:24.270 --> 00:51:26.140
of information, papers on it,

00:51:26.140 --> 00:51:29.390
or do you have any
resources that would be good?

00:51:29.390 --> 00:51:30.690
&gt;&gt; Larrie Ferreiro: Absolutely.

00:51:30.690 --> 00:51:34.340
After you buy my book you buy
Patrick Villiers' biography

00:51:34.340 --> 00:51:44.320 position:56%
of Hermione, Patrick Villiers, who
wrote it first in French, of course,

00:51:44.320 --> 00:51:48.620
and then the book was translated,
and the title escapes me,

00:51:48.620 --> 00:51:52.910
but I have it referenced
in my Bibliography,

00:51:52.910 --> 00:51:58.520
and it is a fantastic explanation
of, well, not just of Hermione,

00:51:58.520 --> 00:52:01.750
but of Lafayette's voyage,
and the significance.

00:52:01.750 --> 00:52:07.210
And of all the books I've read,
it is undoubtedly the best one.

00:52:07.210 --> 00:52:10.510
Now, if you are really
interested in the ships themselves,

00:52:10.510 --> 00:52:13.650
please come see me afterward,
because most of the books

00:52:13.650 --> 00:52:17.210 position:56%
that have been written, they are in
French, they were written by a cadre

00:52:17.210 --> 00:52:23.550
of individuals under a recently
deceased architect named Jean

00:52:23.550 --> 00:52:30.760 position:56%
Boudreau, who wrote many, many tomes
on French ships of the age of sail.

00:52:30.760 --> 00:52:34.480
And they are just a joy to behold.

00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:38.390
They are also very expensive, but
the Library of Congress has a lot

00:52:38.390 --> 00:52:42.860
of them, so you know, maybe
with a little bit of, you know,

00:52:42.860 --> 00:52:45.100
forbearance, they'd let you see it.

00:52:45.100 --> 00:52:47.150
Sir, I think I saw, did
that answer your question?

00:52:47.150 --> 00:52:50.810
I think I saw a hand
here, and then you next.

00:52:50.810 --> 00:52:55.890
&gt;&gt; Communication being very
vital in the time of war,

00:52:55.890 --> 00:52:59.280
have any of your cast of
characters [inaudible]?

00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:00.580
&gt;&gt; Larrie Ferreiro:
All of them were.

00:53:00.580 --> 00:53:01.880
&gt;&gt; So they could-

00:53:01.880 --> 00:53:03.180
&gt;&gt; Larrie Ferreiro: Oh, so
the question was were any

00:53:03.180 --> 00:53:04.480
of these people bilingual.

00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:10.820
And the answer was at the
time everybody spoke French.

00:53:10.820 --> 00:53:13.080
That was it, I mean,
that's kind of the answer.

00:53:13.080 --> 00:53:15.110
Many of the Americans spoke French.

00:53:15.110 --> 00:53:17.160
Alexander Hamilton spoke French.

00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:20.150
John Laurens, his friend,
spoke French.

00:53:20.150 --> 00:53:21.940
Washington did not.

00:53:21.940 --> 00:53:25.130
All the Spanish officers
spoke French.

00:53:25.130 --> 00:53:31.760
So there were few problems
communicating.

00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:34.420
Does that answer your question?

00:53:34.420 --> 00:53:36.020
I saw a hand over here, sir.

00:53:36.020 --> 00:53:40.510
&gt;&gt; This may be a little
attenuated, but Lafayette came back

00:53:40.510 --> 00:53:44.680
and toured this country, and I
read that he gave a crocodile

00:53:44.680 --> 00:53:46.940
to our President, so I
wondered what had happened

00:53:46.940 --> 00:53:48.240
to the crocodile [laughter].

00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:53.570
And I consulted a White House
architectural historian in Texas,

00:53:53.570 --> 00:53:56.530
and he said they threw it in the
West Wing, I said, "The West Wing?"

00:53:56.530 --> 00:53:57.830
He said yeah.

00:53:57.830 --> 00:54:00.580
The West Wing was just like a big
barn full of stuff [laughter].

00:54:00.580 --> 00:54:01.880
Have you ever heard of that?

00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:03.180
&gt;&gt; Larrie Ferreiro: No, sir,

00:54:03.180 --> 00:54:06.910 position:56%
the question was did Lafayette bring
a crocodile during his 1824 tour,

00:54:06.910 --> 00:54:10.060
which I will reference
in a little bit,

00:54:10.060 --> 00:54:13.840
if I don't get the right question,
and I've not heard of that.

00:54:13.840 --> 00:54:17.300
Now, I do have another
animal story [laughter].

00:54:18.620 --> 00:54:22.480
So I am unable to answer
your question,

00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:24.450
and I have not seen
it written anywhere,

00:54:24.450 --> 00:54:25.750
but I can go back and look.

00:54:25.750 --> 00:54:33.310
However, the other animal story is
the, as probably most of you know,

00:54:33.310 --> 00:54:36.220
George Washington was quite an
entrepreneur, and one of the things

00:54:36.220 --> 00:54:41.480
that he wanted to do after
the war was raise mules,

00:54:41.480 --> 00:54:43.760
and he specifically wanted a type

00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:49.590 position:56%
of Spanish mule called an Andalusian
Jack, which was very well regarded,

00:54:49.590 --> 00:54:52.880
and as a result of one of the
battles that had been fought

00:54:52.880 --> 00:54:55.180
with American and Spanish troops,

00:54:55.180 --> 00:54:58.900
the Spanish king allowed
these prized animals.

00:54:58.900 --> 00:55:03.510
Normally he did not let
these animals leave Spain.

00:55:03.510 --> 00:55:08.080
He allowed two Andalusian
Jacks, one of which survived,

00:55:08.080 --> 00:55:11.310
was named Royal Gift,
George Washington got it,

00:55:11.310 --> 00:55:15.130
and they have a lot of
information at Mt. Vernon

00:55:15.130 --> 00:55:21.430
to tell you how he took the Jack,
baited it first with Jennys,

00:55:21.430 --> 00:55:28.780
created a whole host of
sires, which are donkeys,

00:55:28.780 --> 00:55:32.040
and then created a line of mules.

00:55:32.040 --> 00:55:35.940
So these mules all became known
as American Mammoth Mules,

00:55:35.940 --> 00:55:38.780
the American Mammoth
Mule was the animal

00:55:38.780 --> 00:55:42.250
that populated the American
west, and was the animal

00:55:42.250 --> 00:55:45.750
that was brought over, since
we're on the eve of World War I,

00:55:45.750 --> 00:55:53.540
in the millions, to pull
canon, artillery, wagons.

00:55:53.540 --> 00:55:58.040
That one jack from Spain
[laughter] was the progenitor

00:55:58.040 --> 00:56:00.170
of a major line of animals.

00:56:00.170 --> 00:56:02.610
So there is an animal
story for you [laughter].

00:56:02.610 --> 00:56:04.400
I think I saw a hand here, ma'am.

00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:06.800
&gt;&gt; My question also is
regarding communication,

00:56:06.800 --> 00:56:11.590
with so much collaboration
between the Spanish and the French,

00:56:11.590 --> 00:56:14.820
with engineering of the ships, how
did they keep those communications

00:56:14.820 --> 00:56:20.050
from getting thwarted, or
like spies, like the British-

00:56:20.050 --> 00:56:21.350
&gt;&gt; Larrie Ferreiro: Oh,
there were spies everywhere.

00:56:21.350 --> 00:56:25.410
I actually have a wonderful
paper on the spy missions.

00:56:25.410 --> 00:56:28.920
One of my favorite stories, the
short answer is that they didn't.

00:56:28.920 --> 00:56:33.360
One of my favorite stories, not
quite related to what you asked,

00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:34.660
did I repeat the question?

00:56:34.660 --> 00:56:39.570
The question was about how did
all these exchanges between France

00:56:39.570 --> 00:56:43.530
and Spain do so absent the
detection of the British,

00:56:43.530 --> 00:56:45.190
and the answer was, they didn't.

00:56:45.190 --> 00:56:48.350
And there was constant spying
between all the nations.

00:56:48.350 --> 00:56:52.340
One of my favorite stories happened
about 30 years earlier, or sorry,

00:56:52.340 --> 00:56:58.590
20 years earlier, 1748,
1749, the Spanish,

00:56:58.590 --> 00:57:01.830
including one of the
Admirals who later fought,

00:57:01.830 --> 00:57:06.250
sent over a spy mission to London,
and several of the shipyards

00:57:06.250 --> 00:57:09.320
in England, to understand
how they built ships,

00:57:09.320 --> 00:57:13.130
and also when they came back,
the two men were Jorge Juan

00:57:13.130 --> 00:57:16.990
and Santacia [phonetic spelling],
and Jose-so [Spanish name spoken],

00:57:16.990 --> 00:57:24.340
but I don't remember if it was
Jose [foreign names spoken],

00:57:24.340 --> 00:57:28.950
had gone over as spies,
went under an assumed name,

00:57:28.950 --> 00:57:32.380
and came back with 80
British shipbuilders.

00:57:32.380 --> 00:57:35.650
Now most of these shipbuilders
were, in fact, of Irish descent,

00:57:35.650 --> 00:57:39.790
and they were escaping
persecution, because being Catholic

00:57:39.790 --> 00:57:41.750
in a Protestant country, you know,

00:57:41.750 --> 00:57:48.030
they were quite often not given the
promotions they felt they deserved.

00:57:48.030 --> 00:57:52.970
And that is why the flagship of
the Spanish Navy during this war,

00:57:52.970 --> 00:57:56.840
[Spanish name spoken] was built
by Matthew Mullen [laughter].

00:57:56.840 --> 00:58:02.680
So I have a whole paper which
is called Spies Versus Prize,

00:58:02.680 --> 00:58:06.870
about the industrial espionage
that went on between them,

00:58:06.870 --> 00:58:10.560 position:56%
and I'd be happy to talk about it
with you offline, because it is just

00:58:10.560 --> 00:58:14.390
so interesting, on so
many different levels.

00:58:14.390 --> 00:58:15.690
Sir?

00:58:15.690 --> 00:58:18.300
&gt;&gt; Just another logistics one,
that is kind of fun is, you know,

00:58:18.300 --> 00:58:20.300
when you read a book
I always think of it,

00:58:20.300 --> 00:58:22.880
like you started day
one on page one.

00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:24.720
Where did you really
start the book at?

00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:27.140
&gt;&gt; Larrie Ferreiro: Oh, I did
not start day one, page one.

00:58:27.140 --> 00:58:30.350
The book starts, you've
got to read it,

00:58:30.350 --> 00:58:37.170
with Thomas Jefferson writing
a message to Carlos the Third,

00:58:37.170 --> 00:58:41.990
and Louis the Sixteenth,
and the book starts

00:58:41.990 --> 00:58:45.720
by saying this is what the
American Congress needed,

00:58:45.720 --> 00:58:49.680 position:56%
because we were going to go fight a
war, we couldn't do it by ourselves,

00:58:49.680 --> 00:58:55.180
so we needed them to come alongside
us, then of course, by that point,

00:58:55.180 --> 00:59:00.370
you know, the curtain comes up, and
this message to Carlos the Third

00:59:00.370 --> 00:59:04.330
and Louis the Sixteenth is
revealed to be the Declaration

00:59:04.330 --> 00:59:08.830
of Independence, and this is
one of the things you asked,

00:59:08.830 --> 00:59:14.760
I believe ma'am, you asked
me what was surprising.

00:59:14.760 --> 00:59:18.970
And I decided, again, apart from
nailing my colors to the mast,

00:59:18.970 --> 00:59:23.740
I'd start off by completely
exploding everybody's conception

00:59:23.740 --> 00:59:26.640
of what the declaration
of independence was.

00:59:26.640 --> 00:59:29.490
For the simple reason
that historians who write

00:59:29.490 --> 00:59:32.500
about the declaration admit fully

00:59:32.500 --> 00:59:35.350
that it was written
as a cry for help.

00:59:35.350 --> 00:59:40.380
The bad news is, they tend
to put that on page 342,

00:59:40.380 --> 00:59:46.360
footnote 27 [laughter], and
it was vital that it be put

00:59:46.360 --> 00:59:49.290
in context, front and center.

00:59:49.290 --> 00:59:52.380
What I can tell you is, all the
correspondence that you read

00:59:52.380 --> 00:59:55.840
from that time, makes it
quite clear what the intent

00:59:55.840 --> 00:59:58.140
of the Declaration
of Independence was.

00:59:59.290 --> 01:00:06.430
Now, to solidify, to...even
though I think I've beat that one

01:00:06.430 --> 01:00:09.480
over the head many times, let
me tell you the first thing

01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:12.850
that Congress did after the
Declaration was approved.

01:00:12.850 --> 01:00:14.190
Not fully signed.

01:00:14.190 --> 01:00:17.740
All of us know that the Declaration
was not signed on July 4,

01:00:17.740 --> 01:00:20.040
it wasn't until August,
but the first thing

01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:24.290
after the broadsheet was printed,
Congress put it on a ship.

01:00:24.290 --> 01:00:26.330
The name of the ship was Dispatch.

01:00:26.330 --> 01:00:30.010
It was a continental
break in Philadelphia.

01:00:30.010 --> 01:00:34.820
The July 4 was a Thursday, the
broadsheet was printed on a Friday,

01:00:34.820 --> 01:00:39.520
you had Saturday, Sunday,
Monday, was put on the ship.

01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:41.230
Dispatch sailed out of
Philadelphia on the 10th

01:00:41.230 --> 01:00:44.760
and unfortunately it was
captured, and the reason it was put

01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:48.750
on Dispatch was because they
wanted, and Congress said so,

01:00:48.750 --> 01:00:53.300
get this into the courts of France

01:00:53.300 --> 01:00:55.650
and Spain immediately,
so they can read it.

01:00:55.650 --> 01:01:00.090
Because once they read it, they
would know we're now independent,

01:01:00.090 --> 01:01:01.540
because we said we
were going to do it,

01:01:01.540 --> 01:01:04.950
now you can come and
fight alongside us.

01:01:04.950 --> 01:01:06.600
Now, dispatch, the brig,

01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:10.890
was captured by the
British off Delaware Capes

01:01:10.890 --> 01:01:17.320
about three weeks later, so the
word actually didn't get to Europe

01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:24.250
until August but even by then,
I mention that Dean was already

01:01:24.250 --> 01:01:27.890
in negotiations about supplying
arms, actually was being taken,

01:01:27.890 --> 01:01:29.190
they knew this was going to happen.

01:01:29.190 --> 01:01:31.910
And they knew it because
I'd mentioned all the spies

01:01:31.910 --> 01:01:33.440
and observers.

01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:36.200
France had already sent
spies and observers to figure

01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:38.810 position:56%
out what the Americans were going
to do, and they knew they were going

01:01:38.810 --> 01:01:40.400
to declare for independence.

01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:48.180 position:56%
So, this is all, they were, they
were following events quite closely,

01:01:48.180 --> 01:01:50.360
even if they had to
do so at a distance.

01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:54.050
So did that answer the question?

01:01:54.050 --> 01:01:56.510
Okay, I don't know what
our time limit looks like?

01:01:56.510 --> 01:01:58.320
&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: Yeah, we'd like
to allow time for you to meet

01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:00.070
with the book seller,
or they have to leave.

01:02:00.070 --> 01:02:02.520
&gt;&gt; Larrie Ferreiro: Okay, I have
one question that nobody asked,

01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:05.850
which is why I have this
slide up there [laughter].

01:02:05.850 --> 01:02:07.640
Nobody asked the obvious question,

01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:10.790
and by the way, nobody
has yet done so.

01:02:10.790 --> 01:02:12.830
If Lafayette wasn't the
most important figure

01:02:12.830 --> 01:02:16.110
in this whole story, how come he
is the one who gets all the press,

01:02:16.110 --> 01:02:17.900
and the answer is he
made a grand tour

01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:21.590
of America, 1824, and then he died.

01:02:21.590 --> 01:02:25.190
And sort of like Elvis, you know,
great career move [laughter].

01:02:25.190 --> 01:02:30.520
And I say this because there
is a wonderful portrait

01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:34.020
of Lafayette just before
he passed away.

01:02:34.020 --> 01:02:43.590
He visits all 24 or 22 states,
takes steamboats to a lot of these.

01:02:43.590 --> 01:02:44.890
This I found interesting.

01:02:44.890 --> 01:02:46.990
Eats massive dinners every night,

01:02:46.990 --> 01:02:49.310
I don't know how he
didn't gain weight.

01:02:49.310 --> 01:02:53.820 position:56%
This was when he was called The
Hero of Two Worlds, not before then.

01:02:53.820 --> 01:03:00.050
And even in World War I, Pershing,
1917, his aide to camp said

01:03:00.050 --> 01:03:01.890
"Lafayette, we are here."

01:03:01.890 --> 01:03:05.420
Okay, so that was the event
that cemented Lafayette

01:03:05.420 --> 01:03:09.730
as the centerpiece, and kind of,
you know, put France at least

01:03:09.730 --> 01:03:14.470 position:56%
in the picture, and the reason I say
it was this event, and his death,

01:03:14.470 --> 01:03:18.590
that made him the most famous
figure is because I went to Google,

01:03:18.590 --> 01:03:21.930
and they have an end gram
function which plots the mentions.

01:03:21.930 --> 01:03:25.470
And so I looked at Lafayette,
and the mentions were,

01:03:25.470 --> 01:03:28.690
back when he was over
here, very few.

01:03:28.690 --> 01:03:33.760
But you see that they peak right
after his grand tour, 1824 to 1825,

01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:37.670
then they spike at his death,
and then it sort of drops away.

01:03:37.670 --> 01:03:40.560
So, if I'm using mentions
in books as a proxy

01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:42.710
for popularity, that is it.

01:03:42.710 --> 01:03:44.720
And this is only in
English language books.

01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:49.820
It is also true in French
language books [laughter] as well.

01:03:50.990 --> 01:03:54.540
So nobody asked the question,
but that is the answer.

01:03:54.540 --> 01:03:57.440 position:56%
With that, I think we can close out.

01:03:57.440 --> 01:04:00.660
So I can say to the
video crew [laughter],

01:04:00.660 --> 01:04:03.470
and I'll be in front,
and ready to sign books.

01:04:03.470 --> 01:04:05.510
&gt;&gt; Pam Jackson: Yes, thank you.

01:04:05.510 --> 01:04:11.730
[ Applause ]

01:04:11.730 --> 01:04:15.380
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
