00:07:57.494 --> 00:07:59.494
   &gt;&gt;  Good evening, ladies and 
gentlemen.  Welcome to the 

00:08:01.985 --> 00:08:05.014
Library of Congress' celebration
of Women's History Month.  It's 

00:08:05.015 --> 00:08:09.768
such a pleasure.  Welcome to our
live stream audience out there, 

00:08:14.094 --> 00:08:16.094
welcome to the Library of 
Congress, the 

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:21.980
historic Collid ge

00:08:23.637 --> 00:08:25.637
auditorium.

00:08:29.356 --> 00:08:31.356
My name is Ari Ar an

00:08:35.331 --> 00:08:37.331
anna, and a literally advisor 
to the Library of Congress.

00:08:37.614 --> 00:08:39.614
Dr.

00:08:42.091 --> 00:08:44.174
Carla Hayden, our Librarian of 
Congress, the first woman 

00:08:45.815 --> 00:08:47.815
Librarian of Congress in the 
history of 

00:08:48.891 --> 00:08:49.915
the United States of 
America --

00:08:49.916 --> 00:08:52.540
[Applause]
   -- is home with a stress 

00:08:52.541 --> 00:08:54.541
throat.  So you're going to have
to 

00:08:54.982 --> 00:08:57.672
deal with me.  But she sends all
her best.

00:09:01.335 --> 00:09:02.967
And a big greeting 
to you on Women's History Month.

00:09:06.458 --> 00:09:08.458
So here is the big question that
we're posing today.

00:09:09.133 --> 00:09:11.185
Now, you heard the names.  
Right?  Of John Glen.

00:09:14.817 --> 00:09:16.817
And Allen Alan 

00:09:19.666 --> 00:09:21.666
shepherd and Neil Armstrong.

00:09:27.162 --> 00:09:29.162
What about Katherine Johnson and

00:09:31.944 --> 00:09:33.979
Dorothy Vaughn and Mary Jackson 
and Barbara Holly?  We're here 

00:09:38.302 --> 00:09:39.099
to throw a very bright light on 
a wonderful book and a wonderful

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:42.848
movie.  "Hidden Figures" is the 
remarkable story of three 

00:09:45.944 --> 00:09:48.203
pioneering African American 
women at NACA, and as it 

00:09:48.204 --> 00:09:50.863
happens, 
that story sits smack dab in the

00:09:50.864 --> 00:09:52.864
middle of some of the most 

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:59.617
defining moments of the 20th 
century.  The Cold War.  The 

00:09:59.618 --> 00:10:01.881
space race, the civil rights 
movement, 

00:10:05.211 --> 00:10:07.211
and the ongoing quest for 
gender equality.

00:10:08.205 --> 00:10:10.205
Though they did the same work as
whites, hired at the time, 

00:10:16.651 --> 00:10:18.651
these women were kept apart, not
only in gender, segregated 

00:10:22.969 --> 00:10:25.608
offices, but in racially 
segregated offices, at NACA's 

00:10:25.609 --> 00:10:27.609
Langley 

00:10:28.625 --> 00:10:30.625
campus

00:10:32.474 --> 00:10:34.474
.  Despite the hardships of 
working

00:10:36.121 --> 00:10:38.121
under strict Jim Crowe 

00:10:39.248 --> 00:10:41.248
laws, they went on to help with 

00:10:45.101 --> 00:10:46.534
in the space race.
   By now, "Hidden Figures" has 

00:10:46.535 --> 00:10:51.643
been published as an adult book 
and a children's book so a 

00:10:51.644 --> 00:10:53.644
universe of young girls can be 

00:10:58.045 --> 00:11:00.045
inspired by this story of grit, 
grace, perseverance.

00:11:02.397 --> 00:11:02.594
Now, I'm told there's a doll 
even of Katherine Johnson, which

00:11:02.595 --> 00:11:04.595
is amazing.

00:11:06.503 --> 00:11:07.945
I'll get that for my 
grandchildren.  And to let you 

00:11:07.946 --> 00:11:12.011
know "Hidden Figures" will be on
sale after this program and 

00:11:13.681 --> 00:11:15.681
Margo will be signing her books.

00:11:18.416 --> 00:11:19.990
Just last week, Margot Lee 
Shetterly published a wonderful 

00:11:24.092 --> 00:11:28.158
essay for Women's History Month 
from the Library of Congress 

00:11:24.092 --> 00:11:28.015
magazine.  If you don't know 
this magazine, you should.  On 

00:11:28.016 --> 00:11:30.016
the 

00:11:32.178 --> 00:11:34.447
back page is this wonderful 
essay in which Margo says: When 

00:11:34.448 --> 00:11:37.331
I 
was growing up in Hampton, 

00:11:37.332 --> 00:11:39.332
Virginia, the face of science 
was 

00:11:40.189 --> 00:11:45.924
brown, like mine.  My dad was a 
NASA lifer.  A career Langley 

00:11:45.925 --> 00:11:47.925
research -- career -- sorry.

00:11:50.479 --> 00:11:53.135
A career Langley research 
scientist, who became an 

00:11:53.136 --> 00:11:55.136
internationally respected 
climate 

00:11:55.171 --> 00:11:57.171
expert.

00:11:59.006 --> 00:12:02.583
Five of my father's seven 
siblings were engineers or 

00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:04.990
technologists.

00:12:09.325 --> 00:12:11.325
My father's best friend was an

00:12:13.476 --> 00:12:15.476
aeronautical 
engineer.

00:12:16.152 --> 00:12:18.152
There were mathematicians in our

00:12:19.646 --> 00:12:21.646
church and sonic boom 

00:12:26.359 --> 00:12:28.501
experts in my mother's sorority.
   Why don't we know more about 

00:12:28.502 --> 00:12:31.566
these people, she writes in big 
capital letters?

00:12:35.454 --> 00:12:37.690
Well, lest you don't know enough
about the person asking that 

00:12:37.691 --> 00:12:40.125
question, let me tell you a 
little about her.  Margot Lee 

00:12:43.582 --> 00:12:45.582
Shetterly was born in Hampton, 
Virginia.  Her father was a 

00:12:46.467 --> 00:12:48.467
research scientist as I said at 
NASA.

00:12:49.533 --> 00:12:51.533
Her mother was an English 

00:12:54.453 --> 00:12:55.895
professor at the historically 
black Hampton University.  She 

00:12:55.896 --> 00:12:59.593
graduated from University of 
Virginia.  After college she 

00:12:59.594 --> 00:13:01.594
worked 

00:13:02.672 --> 00:13:04.302
in New York and worked several 
years in investment banking, 

00:13:04.303 --> 00:13:06.303
J.P.

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:12.109
J.Morgon and then Merrill Lynch.

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:17.895
In 2014 she sold the book and 
film rights to "Hidden 

00:13:17.896 --> 00:13:19.896
Figures".

00:13:20.986 --> 00:13:23.461
And even as a proposal, not even
a manuscript, it was 

00:13:25.357 --> 00:13:27.013
optioned 
optioned by the other guest 

00:13:27.014 --> 00:13:29.014
we're going to hear from 
tonight, 

00:13:32.734 --> 00:13:34.734
Donna Gigliotti of Levantine 
films.

00:13:35.603 --> 00:13:37.603
Margo is also the founder of the
Human Computer Project, an 

00:13:39.474 --> 00:13:40.300
effort to recover the names and 
accomplishments of all the women

00:13:43.758 --> 00:13:44.798
who worked as computers, 
mathematicians, scientists, and 

00:13:48.741 --> 00:13:51.004
engineers at NASA and its 
predecessor NACA from the 1930s 

00:13:51.005 --> 00:13:53.005
to the 
1980s.

00:13:56.358 --> 00:13:58.358
And who is Donna Gigliotti?

00:13:59.846 --> 00:14:01.688
The woman who brought us the 
movie "Hidden Figures" on the 

00:14:01.689 --> 00:14:03.689
big screen?

00:14:04.738 --> 00:14:06.738
She's an American 

00:14:09.072 --> 00:14:10.918
film producer best known for 
producing the Academy Award 

00:14:10.919 --> 00:14:12.919
winning 
film Shakespeare in Love.

00:14:18.732 --> 00:14:20.732
And she also produced the 
Reader.  

00:14:26.490 --> 00:14:31.211
She Worked with Martin SCORSESE 
on Riding Bull.  She also worked

00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:37.670
on Devil in a Blue Dress.

00:14:41.332 --> 00:14:43.769
She produced "Hidden Figures", 
which stars Taraji Henson, 

00:14:46.772 --> 00:14:48.772
Octavia

00:14:51.944 --> 00:14:54.414
sponsor, Janelle Monae, and 
Kevin Costner.  It won 

00:14:57.292 --> 00:14:59.292
dozens of award, best picture, 
best screen play, and best 

00:15:01.404 --> 00:15:03.404
supporting actress.

00:15:05.886 --> 00:15:06.496
So remind you of the film, my 
colleague has produced a short 

00:15:06.497 --> 00:15:09.958
video and we'd like to share it 
with you now.  It's not meant to

00:15:09.959 --> 00:15:13.006
be bio-graphical or documentary 
in any way.

00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:18.720
It's a tribute to 

00:15:20.206 --> 00:15:22.206
the African American women who 
despite great odds played a 

00:15:26.503 --> 00:15:29.060
ground breaking role in American
scientific progress.

00:16:06.681 --> 00:16:09.322
&gt;&gt;  We need a mathematician that
can look beyond the numbers.

00:16:11.572 --> 00:16:13.407
&gt;&gt;  I never knew there were 
women working behind the scenes 

00:16:13.408 --> 00:16:15.408
in NACA in the space race.

00:16:18.731 --> 00:16:20.731
&gt;&gt;  They had really next-level 
jobs.

00:16:24.129 --> 00:16:26.129
&gt;&gt;  We're putting a human on top
of a missile shooting into 

00:16:29.063 --> 00:16:30.911
space and it's never been done 
before.

00:16:30.912 --> 00:16:32.912
&gt;&gt;  These women changed the 
game.

00:16:33.378 --> 00:16:35.378
&gt;&gt;  It's wonderful to play a 
strong woman, but they have 

00:16:36.882 --> 00:16:41.789
vulnerable 
vulnerabilityies.

00:16:43.049 --> 00:16:45.909
&gt;&gt;  It felt like it to me, too.
   &gt;&gt;  These ordinary women does

00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:48.370
ex extraordinary things.
   &gt;&gt;  It's crunch time.

00:16:51.654 --> 00:16:52.264
In 14 days, astronauts will be 
here 

00:16:52.265 --> 00:16:54.265
for training.

00:16:56.159 --> 00:16:58.159
Everything we do can matter to 
their wives and 

00:17:00.865 --> 00:17:02.526
children and the whole damn 
country.

00:17:02.527 --> 00:17:04.762
&gt;&gt;  "Hidden Figures" is about 
how black and white, men and 

00:17:04.763 --> 00:17:08.660
women, put a man in space.  
That's empowerment.

00:17:11.922 --> 00:17:13.922
&gt;&gt;  It's getting a little hot in
here.

00:17:24.404 --> 00:17:26.404
[Applause]

00:17:27.551 --> 00:17:31.261
   &gt;&gt;  Wonderful.  Now, ladies 
and gentlemen, I'd like you to 

00:17:31.262 --> 00:17:33.727
welcome the award winning, 
wonderful 

00:17:36.732 --> 00:17:38.732
writer, Margo Lee 

00:17:42.227 --> 00:17:43.865
Shetterly, and the award winning
marvelous film producer Donna 

00:17:43.866 --> 00:17:47.372
Gigliotti.

00:17:50.378 --> 00:17:52.378
[Applause]

00:18:07.188 --> 00:18:09.188
&gt;&gt;  So glad to have you here at 
the Library of Congress.  

00:18:10.654 --> 00:18:11.262
Thank you for making the trip 
Donna and Margo.  Wonderful to 

00:18:11.263 --> 00:18:14.692
have you here.  I want to start 
we were talking back stage about

00:18:14.693 --> 00:18:16.981
exactly how this movie came to 
be made.

00:18:20.045 --> 00:18:22.283
And I, in fact, had in 
my notes that it had come after 

00:18:22.284 --> 00:18:28.230
you had read the manuscript, 
but, no, that's not the story.  

00:18:28.231 --> 00:18:30.231
Tell us the story, Margo and 
Donna.

00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:32.767
&gt;&gt;  Well, I started working on 
"Hidden Figures", what would 

00:18:32.768 --> 00:18:36.459
become "Hidden Figures", in 
2010.  And started doing 

00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:40.764
research.  
I grew up in Hampton, Virginia. 

00:18:40.765 --> 00:18:43.619
I knew Katherine Johnson from 
the time I was a child.  My dad 

00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:47.126
worked at NASA.  And anyway, 
started working on the book.

00:18:50.827 --> 00:18:52.827
2013 started, had written a book

00:18:55.918 --> 00:18:58.768
proposal, found an agent, who 
then sold it to HarperCollins to

00:18:58.769 --> 00:19:00.769
be published in 2014.

00:19:03.694 --> 00:19:05.115
Really kind of unbeknownst to 
me.  I 

00:19:05.116 --> 00:19:07.144
wasn't very clear.  Maybe we can
talk about how it actually 

00:19:10.016 --> 00:19:12.016
happened, because it's still 
kind of a mystery.

00:19:13.271 --> 00:19:15.271
My book proposal ended up in the
ends 

00:19:18.204 --> 00:19:20.890
of someone named Donna 
Gigliotti.  I remember being in 

00:19:20.891 --> 00:19:24.983
Hampton, Virginia and getting a 
phone call and pulled into the 

00:19:24.984 --> 00:19:26.984
parking 

00:19:28.602 --> 00:19:32.330
lot of the Food Lion if 
anybody is from Virginia, that's

00:19:32.331 --> 00:19:36.841
my favorite part of the story.
   &gt;&gt;  That specificity tells 

00:19:36.842 --> 00:19:38.842
she's an author.
   [Laughter]

00:19:43.415 --> 00:19:44.215
&gt;&gt;  I pulled into the Virginia 
Food Lion and Donna introduced 

00:19:44.216 --> 00:19:47.341
herself and she said on that 
first phone call, we're going to

00:19:50.588 --> 00:19:52.648
make a movie of this book.  I 
said, well, you know, it's not a

00:19:52.649 --> 00:19:55.108
book yet.
   [Laughter]

00:19:57.780 --> 00:19:59.227
Which didn't exist at the time. 
It was a book proposal.  And 

00:20:04.545 --> 00:20:06.783
yet, this very intrepid, 
multiply awarded, gifted, film 

00:20:06.784 --> 00:20:08.784
maker 

00:20:10.485 --> 00:20:13.352
had a vision for this 55-page 
book proposal.  And that was in 

00:20:13.353 --> 00:20:15.915
-- 
that was four years ago.  It was

00:20:15.916 --> 00:20:18.579
this time four years ago.
   &gt;&gt;  And the part she's 

00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:20.662
leaving out about this story 
that I 

00:20:24.387 --> 00:20:25.818
said to her while she was in the
Food Lion, "And we're going to 

00:20:29.037 --> 00:20:32.374
go to the Oscars together."
   [Applause]

00:20:36.083 --> 00:20:38.083
&gt;&gt;  On the first phone call in 
the 

00:20:39.331 --> 00:20:41.977
parking lot of the Food 
Lion.  That's what happened.

00:20:42.806 --> 00:20:45.915
&gt;&gt;  Incredible.
   &gt;&gt;  It's nice but it sounds 

00:20:45.916 --> 00:20:51.020
fairy land and all of that, but 
the truth was that Margo, she 

00:20:51.021 --> 00:20:53.021
was onto something with that 
book 

00:20:53.662 --> 00:20:55.662
proposal that I could feel.  I 
knew it.

00:20:59.384 --> 00:21:01.210
It was in the 
zeitgeist.  It was about women 

00:21:01.211 --> 00:21:03.252
not getting their due, African 
American women not getting their

00:21:03.253 --> 00:21:07.788
due.  It was about math.  It 
was about space.

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:13.240
It was a confluence of things 
that really -- I 

00:21:14.141 --> 00:21:15.360
never doubted that it would be 
successful.  Because you could 

00:21:15.361 --> 00:21:20.070
feel it in the zeitgeist.  She 
tapped into it.

00:21:23.516 --> 00:21:27.206
&gt;&gt;  This was even before the 
whole mania of code girls.  That

00:21:27.207 --> 00:21:29.890
didn't actually happen until the
following year.

00:21:30.712 --> 00:21:32.712
&gt;&gt;  No, it didn't.

00:21:33.991 --> 00:21:35.991
What I clearly remember is 
shortly 

00:21:37.895 --> 00:21:39.105
optioning the book proposal, 
Google came out and they finally

00:21:39.106 --> 00:21:43.647
came clean on what the 
composition was of their 

00:21:43.648 --> 00:21:45.648
workforce.
   &gt;&gt;  Right.

00:21:46.728 --> 00:21:49.179
&gt;&gt;  And it was astonishing 
because it was largely male and 

00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:51.180
largely white.

00:21:53.674 --> 00:21:55.515
And I thought, okay, now, I know
that this is -- 

00:21:55.516 --> 00:21:57.516
it's in the zeitgeist.

00:21:59.056 --> 00:22:01.056
It was that, coupled with maybe 
eight or 

00:22:06.413 --> 00:22:08.413
nine months later, after coming 
out, and the confluence was 

00:22:09.289 --> 00:22:11.127
undeniable, actually.
   &gt;&gt;  Wonderful.  Wonderful 

00:22:11.128 --> 00:22:13.128
story.  I'm going to back away 
and 

00:22:16.666 --> 00:22:17.874
ask you about, for the young 
people in the audience who are 

00:22:22.511 --> 00:22:25.412
watching out there on live and 
out there on live stream, what 

00:22:25.413 --> 00:22:28.107
was it about your 
views that brought you to this 

00:22:28.108 --> 00:22:32.016
place or that made you what you 
are today?

00:22:38.662 --> 00:22:40.662
Margo, what was it about you 
that actually -- was it 

00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:43.530
the drive there?

00:22:44.817 --> 00:22:46.225
How did this happen that you are
who you are 

00:22:46.226 --> 00:22:51.818
today?  Given the child that you
were then?

00:22:52.831 --> 00:22:54.831
&gt;&gt; MARGOT:  A lot of it really 
does have to do with my 

00:22:56.325 --> 00:22:57.349
parents and the community that I
grew up in and the people that 

00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:59.350
I grew up around.

00:23:01.672 --> 00:23:03.672
As I mentioned, my father worked
at NASA.  My 

00:23:05.559 --> 00:23:08.867
mother was an English professor 
at Hampton University.  And 

00:23:09.489 --> 00:23:11.988
there was this expectation.  I 
mean I think I finally redeemed 

00:23:11.989 --> 00:23:15.743
myself with my dad.  He wanted 
me to become an engineer.  I 

00:23:15.744 --> 00:23:17.744
didn't.
   [Laughter]

00:23:18.419 --> 00:23:20.054
So I think I've kind of finally 
done enough to redeem myself 

00:23:20.055 --> 00:23:25.362
with that.  But from the time I 
was little, we would go and see 

00:23:28.871 --> 00:23:30.871
my mom at work over at Hampton 
University.

00:23:34.822 --> 00:23:36.822
We'd see James 

00:23:39.088 --> 00:23:41.530
Baldwin and Maya Angelou and all
these moving writers and so 

00:23:44.983 --> 00:23:46.983
forth that would come to Hampton
University.

00:23:48.459 --> 00:23:50.297
We would go get this computer 
paper.  This is dating me in a 

00:23:50.298 --> 00:23:55.665
big way.  You would not believe 
the huge paper that would get 

00:23:55.666 --> 00:23:59.838
produced for these calculations 
they were doing back in the 70s.

00:24:00.448 --> 00:24:04.945
The thing that was so wonderful 
about that was being exposed at 

00:24:07.977 --> 00:24:08.827
this very young age to this 
entire very wide spectrum of 

00:24:08.828 --> 00:24:12.308
different kinds of people, 
different backgrounds, women, 

00:24:12.309 --> 00:24:14.309
who 

00:24:20.041 --> 00:24:22.978
were working at NASA, like my 
mother, and who were professors 

00:24:22.979 --> 00:24:25.900
like my mother, 
and there was never this idea 

00:24:25.901 --> 00:24:27.901
that there was anything off 
limits.

00:24:30.593 --> 00:24:32.593
And from a particularly young 
age, and to see these 

00:24:35.322 --> 00:24:36.336
women doing these jobs of 
scientists, and you kind of take

00:24:36.337 --> 00:24:38.594
it 
for granted.  When that is the 

00:24:38.595 --> 00:24:42.278
floor, it makes it easy to say, 
well, I don't want to do that.  

00:24:42.279 --> 00:24:44.279
I want to do something else.  

00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:50.777
Which I wanted to walk on wall 
Wall Street.  That seemed like 

00:24:50.778 --> 00:24:52.778
the new 
frontier to me.

00:24:56.898 --> 00:24:58.898
But having both that very 
nurturing 

00:25:01.385 --> 00:25:03.250
in terms of my apparent parents,
but also the community around 

00:25:03.251 --> 00:25:06.098
us, this is really a love letter
to my childhood.

00:25:07.324 --> 00:25:09.481
&gt;&gt;  Absolutely.  How about you, 
Donna, how did you get to 

00:25:10.476 --> 00:25:13.545
where you are?
   &gt;&gt; DONNA:  It's a very 

00:25:13.546 --> 00:25:15.546
similar story.  I grew up in 
Upstate 

00:25:19.889 --> 00:25:21.889
New York in a little tiny town. 
Essentially, it was a 

00:25:22.533 --> 00:25:23.545
tremendous amount of support 
from my family and the 

00:25:23.546 --> 00:25:25.546
community.  

00:25:27.490 --> 00:25:30.182
It really was my mother.  I'm 
old.  I was born in 1954.  And 

00:25:30.183 --> 00:25:32.183
it 

00:25:34.242 --> 00:25:35.060
was my mother always saying you 
can do whatever it is that you 

00:25:35.061 --> 00:25:37.061
want to do.

00:25:41.574 --> 00:25:43.574
And, you know, she was of a 
generation and maybe 

00:25:45.390 --> 00:25:47.227
she was a little frustrated and 
put that all onto me.  I always 

00:25:47.228 --> 00:25:50.760
tell the story, this is true, I 
was 18 years old before I 

00:25:55.238 --> 00:25:57.238
realized I was not the prettiest
or the smartest girl in the 

00:25:59.136 --> 00:26:00.366
world because she told me that 
the entire time.

00:26:00.367 --> 00:26:02.367
[Laughter]

00:26:03.839 --> 00:26:05.839
It was astonishing to me that 
that was not the case.

00:26:06.082 --> 00:26:08.118
[Laughter]
   So mom.

00:26:09.567 --> 00:26:11.567
&gt;&gt;  Oh, moms are great.
   &gt;&gt;  Moms.

00:26:14.068 --> 00:26:16.112
Women's History Month.  Let's 
hear it for the 

00:26:16.113 --> 00:26:19.177
moms.
   [Applause]

00:26:20.193 --> 00:26:22.193
&gt;&gt;  Thanks be to them.

00:26:23.705 --> 00:26:25.128
How was it, Margo, that you 
actually came upon this subject?

00:26:25.129 --> 00:26:28.288
You said and you have written in
this magazine and said many 

00:26:31.363 --> 00:26:33.426
times that it was that culture 
that you grew up in, but, 

00:26:37.118 --> 00:26:38.544
actually, stumbling on this 
actual story, how did that 

00:26:38.545 --> 00:26:40.776
happen?
   &gt;&gt; MARGOT:  Well, the thing 

00:26:40.777 --> 00:26:44.489
that's really great about it is 
this story has very much to do 

00:26:44.490 --> 00:26:46.490
with the most important men in 
my 

00:26:46.548 --> 00:26:48.548
life.

00:26:50.625 --> 00:26:52.625
My husband and I had gone home 
Christmas 2010 to visit my 

00:26:56.167 --> 00:26:57.798
parents and we ran into a woman 
who was somebody we had known 

00:26:57.799 --> 00:27:01.469
from church growing up.  She's 
my Sunday school teacher.  And 

00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:05.980
my 
dad started talking about her.  

00:27:05.981 --> 00:27:07.981
She was 96, I think, and had 

00:27:10.264 --> 00:27:11.298
worked her whole career as a 
computer in the West area 

00:27:11.299 --> 00:27:13.299
computing 
group.

00:27:13.352 --> 00:27:15.181
I didn't quite know it.  There's
so many things you hear as a 

00:27:20.301 --> 00:27:21.317
kid, you kind of just tune out, 
whatever it's not not important 

00:27:21.318 --> 00:27:24.405
to me, whatever, but anyway, it 
turned into this entire 

00:27:26.043 --> 00:27:27.257
conversation with me kind of 
listening, between my dad and my

00:27:27.258 --> 00:27:32.149
husband.  And my husband looked 
at me like, oh, my God, I can't 

00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:35.222
believe this.  What?  I've never
heard this story before.

00:27:39.088 --> 00:27:41.088
And I had heard this story.

00:27:42.549 --> 00:27:44.193
I had known these women, but 
never really took the time to 

00:27:44.194 --> 00:27:46.194
think, 

00:27:49.978 --> 00:27:51.978
well, jeez, why were there 

00:27:53.029 --> 00:27:55.029
black women mathematicians there
in the 1950s?

00:27:58.370 --> 00:27:59.589
Why is my now 
96-year-old Sunday school 

00:27:59.590 --> 00:28:01.220
teacher -- like, how did this 
all 

00:28:01.221 --> 00:28:03.733
happen?  It was really a moment 
for me of seeing something with 

00:28:03.734 --> 00:28:07.237
fresh eyes, something that we 
had really taken for granted 

00:28:10.579 --> 00:28:12.412
growing up in the Hampton.  
Because they were just normal.  

00:28:12.413 --> 00:28:16.332
They 
got up and went to work.  They 

00:28:16.333 --> 00:28:18.796
went to PTA meeting.  We saw 
them 

00:28:22.065 --> 00:28:24.065
in the Food Lions
   [Laughter]

00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:27.158
It was normal but yet an 
extraordinary thing they'd done 

00:28:27.159 --> 00:28:29.791
and 
an extraordinary history there. 

00:28:29.792 --> 00:28:31.792
That was really the beginning 
of it.

00:28:33.119 --> 00:28:35.119
My husband is a writer, and he's

00:28:36.404 --> 00:28:38.947
like, "This is a great book.  
"

00:28:39.451 --> 00:28:41.451
That was really the beginning of
it.

00:28:41.607 --> 00:28:43.607
&gt;&gt;  Let's hear it for good 
husbands.

00:28:44.285 --> 00:28:46.969
[Applause]
   &gt;&gt;  But you knew Katherine 

00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:48.970
Johnson.
   &gt;&gt;  Mm-hmm.

00:28:51.463 --> 00:28:53.489
&gt;&gt;  And what was she like?  The 
version we had was the 

00:28:55.736 --> 00:28:57.364
version that's in your book, 
which is very vivid, and then 

00:28:57.365 --> 00:28:59.365
this 

00:29:00.841 --> 00:29:01.452
vision of a young Katherine 
Johnson, you must have known 

00:29:01.453 --> 00:29:03.453
her, of 

00:29:04.494 --> 00:29:07.476
course, when she was older?
   &gt;&gt; MARGOT:  I remember her 

00:29:07.477 --> 00:29:09.947
when I was a kid.  It was right 
around the time she had retired 

00:29:09.948 --> 00:29:12.796
from NASA.  She was one of these
extremely active in the 

00:29:12.797 --> 00:29:15.029
community.  She was the 
president of the 

00:29:17.086 --> 00:29:19.778
local chapter of the sorority.  
She was just an impeccable 

00:29:21.250 --> 00:29:23.712
person, tall with a pant suit.  
Not the kind of person that you 

00:29:27.045 --> 00:29:29.957
wanted to kind of -- you wanted 
to be on the right side.  I mean

00:29:29.958 --> 00:29:32.198
she's funny and gracious, but 
very serious.  As a kid, you 

00:29:32.199 --> 00:29:34.251
know 
the people who are very serious.

00:29:34.458 --> 00:29:38.154
   [Laughter]
   You do not jump around and 

00:29:38.155 --> 00:29:41.658
play around or whatever.
   And she was part of the 

00:29:41.659 --> 00:29:43.659
community.  You know?

00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:47.560
And during the course of the 
research for the book, I 

00:29:48.827 --> 00:29:50.906
realized just how much had been 
written about her.  The first 

00:29:50.907 --> 00:29:54.779
article I found on Katherine 
Johnson was published in I think

00:29:59.443 --> 00:30:01.443
late 1959, early 1960.

00:30:03.773 --> 00:30:05.773
So two years before John Glenn's
flight.  

00:30:07.172 --> 00:30:08.995
She had this sort of mythology 
grow up around her in Hampton, 

00:30:08.996 --> 00:30:12.079
Virginia, but she was an active 
part of the community.  She was 

00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:16.783
part of a group of people.  Even
as people knew about the 

00:30:19.213 --> 00:30:21.077
achievements, she was still part
of a group.  You know?  She did 

00:30:24.154 --> 00:30:26.154
not stand apart from the rest of
the people there in the 

00:30:26.404 --> 00:30:28.404
community.

00:30:30.274 --> 00:30:31.297
&gt;&gt;  Do you think that she 
realized what part in history 

00:30:31.298 --> 00:30:33.298
she 
had played?

00:30:37.277 --> 00:30:39.277
I mean she was aware of the 
importance of being a 

00:30:41.353 --> 00:30:43.997
woman, being an African American
woman, being a scientist, and 

00:30:43.998 --> 00:30:47.882
being at that place in time, in 
NASA, when this was going down, 

00:30:47.883 --> 00:30:49.883
it was a very big deal?

00:30:52.837 --> 00:30:54.837
You know the space race was 
huge.  And 

00:30:58.959 --> 00:31:00.167
Ury Gagarin had gotten up into 
space and we needed to get up 

00:31:00.168 --> 00:31:02.438
there.
   Did she seem like the sort of

00:31:02.439 --> 00:31:04.439
person who was aware of her 
importance?

00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:13.699
Or was she sort of dismissive 
and not necessarily 

00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:16.352
--
   &gt;&gt;  Well, I think she and the

00:31:16.353 --> 00:31:20.280
other women were very aware of 
their roles in the mission.  And

00:31:20.281 --> 00:31:23.979
what they had done.  And what 
they had contributed to the 

00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:25.980
mission and to the work.

00:31:28.714 --> 00:31:29.726
I think the awareness of history
is something that takes 

00:31:29.727 --> 00:31:32.986
time.  And I think that's 
something that, now, not just 

00:31:32.987 --> 00:31:35.841
she, but 
all of these other women, and 

00:31:35.842 --> 00:31:39.781
the women of code girls, for 
example.  I mean there's so many

00:31:39.782 --> 00:31:41.782
stories about women having done 
these things.

00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:44.880
So history is recognizing it.

00:31:46.142 --> 00:31:47.975
But if you talk to these 
women, I mean Katherine Johnson,

00:31:47.976 --> 00:31:53.542
I was just doing my job.
   &gt;&gt;  Exactly.  Very modest in 

00:31:53.543 --> 00:31:55.588
a lot of ways about her role in 
the entire process.

00:31:59.302 --> 00:32:01.302
&gt;&gt;  How was she at the Academy 
Awards?  Because she's 100 

00:32:03.630 --> 00:32:06.287
years old now, or about to be?
   &gt;&gt;  This year she'll be 100.

00:32:06.902 --> 00:32:08.902
   &gt;&gt;  Yeah.

00:32:11.019 --> 00:32:13.334
&gt;&gt;  She was -- well, we think 
she was excited, because her 

00:32:13.335 --> 00:32:15.566
daughter told us she was 
excited.  But she wasn't having 

00:32:15.567 --> 00:32:18.838
any of 
it.  You know?  It was like, 

00:32:18.839 --> 00:32:21.270
yep, I'm going to go Academy 
Awards.  Yep.

00:32:25.138 --> 00:32:26.965
Yes, we had a dress made for her
and she went through 

00:32:26.966 --> 00:32:28.966
fittings.

00:32:32.066 --> 00:32:34.066
I think she was a little

00:32:37.494 --> 00:32:40.159
befuddled by all the hoopla 
around the meeting.

00:32:42.613 --> 00:32:44.613
I remember when Taraji went down
to meet her.  I don't know 

00:32:50.966 --> 00:32:53.664
if you watch Empire but Taraji 
Plays Cookie.

00:32:58.769 --> 00:33:00.618
She Was in Full 
Cookie mode.

00:33:00.619 --> 00:33:01.663
[Laughter]
   I don't think Katherine 

00:33:01.664 --> 00:33:03.664
Johnson knew what to do with 
Taraji 

00:33:03.885 --> 00:33:05.752
in that room.
   But ultimately, they found 

00:33:05.753 --> 00:33:09.617
the place.  Taraji, if she were 
here, would tell you how 

00:33:09.618 --> 00:33:11.618
important that meeting was, 
because she 

00:33:12.903 --> 00:33:14.903
got to actually understand.

00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:18.594
She listened a lot to tapes of 
Katherine so she could get the 

00:33:18.595 --> 00:33:22.049
syntax right.  There's a lot of 
research that went into that 

00:33:22.050 --> 00:33:24.922
performance.  But Katherine was 
a 

00:33:29.078 --> 00:33:31.078
little like, "Whoa, what's 
happening here?" 

00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:32.518
[Laughter]
   &gt;&gt;  I have this picture.  

00:33:32.519 --> 00:33:34.755
Picture this.  You have a writer

00:33:41.641 --> 00:33:43.641
who has sold in sup

00:33:47.883 --> 00:33:49.883
proposal, so you haven't written
a book, but 

00:33:51.757 --> 00:33:52.384
you've put this proposal up for 
publication.  It's been bought. 

00:33:52.385 --> 00:33:56.894
It's also been bought for a 
film.  And the film is turning 

00:33:56.895 --> 00:33:58.725
while 
you're actually writing the 

00:33:58.726 --> 00:34:02.410
book.  Imagine that.  And I'm 
imagining you making the film on

00:34:02.411 --> 00:34:06.753
the basis of -- I mean it was a 
50 page proposal.  This is not 

00:34:06.754 --> 00:34:12.290
five pages.  Right?  It was a 
substantial proposal.  So you 

00:34:12.291 --> 00:34:14.350
had a lot to work with.
   But the picture I have of you

00:34:14.351 --> 00:34:17.928
is these two women scrambling 
to produce.

00:34:20.156 --> 00:34:22.156
&gt;&gt;  You have no idea.

00:34:23.221 --> 00:34:24.846
Essentially it went like this: 
Margo, 

00:34:24.847 --> 00:34:26.923
have you finished the book yet 
in have you finished the book?  

00:34:26.924 --> 00:34:30.014
The movie is going to be out.  
Have you finished the book?

00:34:32.286 --> 00:34:34.128
[Laughter]
   &gt;&gt;  And I'm like, oh, my God,

00:34:34.129 --> 00:34:36.129
I have to finish the book.  And 

00:34:40.258 --> 00:34:41.273
then I'm like, there's a script!
Wait a minute, wait a minute.  

00:34:41.274 --> 00:34:44.389
I'm looking at the book.  
Everything has to be -- I'm like

00:34:44.390 --> 00:34:46.390
I'm 

00:34:48.678 --> 00:34:50.098
writing this book and it take 
place from 1943 to 1949 with an 

00:34:50.099 --> 00:34:52.754
epilogue that goes into the 70s.

00:34:56.028 --> 00:34:59.925
How come this movie is only 
going to be up to 1962?  Which 

00:34:59.926 --> 00:35:02.383
was ultimately a very good 
decision.  But it was so 

00:35:02.384 --> 00:35:04.384
interesting for me to do 
something that 

00:35:04.468 --> 00:35:06.468
I had never done before.

00:35:09.187 --> 00:35:11.030
And to go through this 
simultaneously 

00:35:11.031 --> 00:35:11.830
another experience, based on 
this thing that I'd never done 

00:35:14.902 --> 00:35:16.902
before, and do that, too.

00:35:20.353 --> 00:35:23.880
It was -- I learned so much.
   &gt;&gt; DONNA:  The great thing is

00:35:23.881 --> 00:35:25.926
we also came out of it as 

00:35:28.985 --> 00:35:30.985
friends, even though I was 
torturing her everyday.

00:35:31.233 --> 00:35:33.233
&gt;&gt; MARGOT:  I got tortured.
   [Laughter]

00:35:34.706 --> 00:35:37.191
&gt;&gt; DONNA:  We really did some 
out of it as very good friends, 

00:35:37.192 --> 00:35:39.192
which was a gift.

00:35:42.090 --> 00:35:44.090
And she looked terrific coming 
down that red 

00:35:44.970 --> 00:35:47.195
carpet at the Oscars.
   &gt;&gt; MARGOT:  It was a great 

00:35:47.196 --> 00:35:51.311
experience.  And the thing I 
really appreciated about the 

00:35:51.312 --> 00:35:53.312
movie, is Donna came in with 
this 

00:35:54.655 --> 00:35:55.877
vision of this story and these 
women, and the importance of 

00:35:55.878 --> 00:36:00.425
these women, and then you really
made it your mission to get the 

00:36:00.426 --> 00:36:03.931
best people.  And the people who
understood what it meant and 

00:36:08.657 --> 00:36:10.720
what it could mean, to girls, to
women, to African Americans, to 

00:36:10.721 --> 00:36:12.721
scientists.

00:36:17.354 --> 00:36:20.243
You know, it was to amazing to 
go in, in the Food 

00:36:23.933 --> 00:36:25.933
Lion parking lot and to come out
at the Oscars.

00:36:27.404 --> 00:36:30.267
[Laughter]
   [Applause]

00:36:32.575 --> 00:36:34.464
&gt;&gt; MARGOT:  But to come away 
with the experience of having 

00:36:38.769 --> 00:36:38.972
worked with such talented, 
committed, interesting people 

00:36:38.973 --> 00:36:43.064
along 
the way.  It was fantastic.

00:36:44.698 --> 00:36:46.698
&gt;&gt; DONNA:  When I say there was 
a 

00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:50.196
kind of kizmit going on, 
what she's talking about, one of

00:36:50.197 --> 00:36:52.197
the people that was absolutely 

00:36:54.976 --> 00:36:56.615
integral to the whole process 
was Pharell Williams.  It and 

00:36:56.616 --> 00:36:58.616
happened almost by accident.

00:37:01.707 --> 00:37:03.135
His partner is a woman who came 
in 

00:37:03.136 --> 00:37:05.156
to 
to see me just in general and 

00:37:05.157 --> 00:37:07.157
she said what kind of things are
you working on?

00:37:10.156 --> 00:37:11.186
And I said, oh, I'm developing 
this script.  

00:37:11.187 --> 00:37:13.224
It's called "Hidden Figures".  I
told her what it was about.  

00:37:13.225 --> 00:37:16.545
She was silent through the whole
entire thing.  At the end of my 

00:37:21.655 --> 00:37:22.684
pitch, she said, Pharell will do
anything to be a part of that.

00:37:22.685 --> 00:37:27.005
   And I said, why is that?  She
said, well, you know, he grew 

00:37:27.006 --> 00:37:29.876
up in Hampton, Virginia.  Who 
knew?

00:37:32.935 --> 00:37:35.792
Very involved in the STEM 
initiative.  Great.  And he's 

00:37:35.793 --> 00:37:37.850
obsessed with space.
   [Laughter]

00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:41.900
Okay.  Check, check, check.

00:37:45.241 --> 00:37:47.241
But in Hollywood, people say 
stuff 

00:37:48.291 --> 00:37:49.722
like that, "Oh, he'll do 
anything to be a part of it."

00:37:49.723 --> 00:37:51.723
   Well, great.

00:37:54.051 --> 00:37:56.106
The next day my assistant coming
running into my office and 

00:38:01.426 --> 00:38:02.136
he's shaking and he's like, 
"Phearell Williams is on the 

00:38:02.137 --> 00:38:05.005
phone."
   It's true.  He was on the 

00:38:05.006 --> 00:38:07.050
phone the next day.  Because 
he's 

00:38:07.647 --> 00:38:10.737
southern he called me Ms. Donna.
He said, Ms. Donna, I will do 

00:38:10.738 --> 00:38:13.394
anything to be a part of this 
project.  And I was like, okay, 

00:38:13.395 --> 00:38:15.395
good, good, good.

00:38:17.845 --> 00:38:19.925
He said I'm coming to New York 
in another week.  Can we meet?  

00:38:19.926 --> 00:38:24.432
I say, sure, no problem.
   A week passes and I go to 

00:38:24.433 --> 00:38:26.433
meet him.  I said there are so 
many 

00:38:27.931 --> 00:38:29.156
elements of this movie that are 
so important to me.  What can I 

00:38:29.157 --> 00:38:31.157
do on it?

00:38:35.928 --> 00:38:37.566
I said, well, you're Pharell 
Williams.  We think you 

00:38:37.567 --> 00:38:39.567
can do the music.
   [Laughter]

00:38:40.008 --> 00:38:42.008
So I said, I think you can do 
the music.  He said, "Good, 

00:38:44.118 --> 00:38:46.118
good, good, because I've been 
working on some stuff."

00:38:48.012 --> 00:38:50.012
[Laughter]

00:38:53.837 --> 00:38:55.100
Margo has not finished the book,
and Pharell has written the 

00:38:55.101 --> 00:38:57.101
music.
   [Laughter]

00:38:59.409 --> 00:39:01.461
He said, here, I'll play it for 
you.  He put it onto the 

00:39:02.912 --> 00:39:05.580
speakers and I said, great.  
This is the best story.  That's 

00:39:05.581 --> 00:39:09.271
why 
I'm telling it.  He got to 

00:39:09.272 --> 00:39:10.713
another song and he said I only 
have 

00:39:10.714 --> 00:39:12.714
the instrumentals.

00:39:13.756 --> 00:39:14.161
I was like, all right, dude, 
it's fine.  You 

00:39:14.162 --> 00:39:16.162
know?

00:39:17.626 --> 00:39:19.626
He said, no, no, no, it's really
good.  He said I'll just 

00:39:20.486 --> 00:39:22.486
have to sing it for you.
   [Laughter]

00:39:22.951 --> 00:39:24.951
I kid you not.

00:39:26.668 --> 00:39:28.668
If he was sitting next to me he 
would recount 

00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:31.391
this exactly as I did.  He sat 
on the couch and he sang the 

00:39:31.588 --> 00:39:34.028
song 
to me.  I said, "You got the 

00:39:34.029 --> 00:39:36.488
job." 
   [Laughter]

00:39:41.572 --> 00:39:43.678
But having people like that, 
Octavia Spencer, she walks on 

00:39:43.679 --> 00:39:45.679
water.

00:39:48.757 --> 00:39:50.757
Not only is she a magnificent 
actor, but the first time 

00:39:54.497 --> 00:39:55.963
she came to see me, she said, I 
don't know what part to play; do

00:40:00.263 --> 00:40:03.117
I want to play Dorothy or Mary?
   So it was a very special 

00:40:03.118 --> 00:40:05.118
group of people we had around 
us.

00:40:05.988 --> 00:40:08.240
&gt;&gt;  Absolutely magical.  Of 
course, it ended up being 

00:40:11.285 --> 00:40:12.726
nominated for best screen play. 
So something was going on with 

00:40:15.984 --> 00:40:17.399
the writing process, as well.
   Tell us about the research 

00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:19.400
for the book.  We're talking 
about 

00:40:22.736 --> 00:40:25.217
interviews and neighbors and all
of that.

00:40:26.276 --> 00:40:28.276
&gt;&gt; MARGOT:  You know, it was so 

00:40:30.388 --> 00:40:33.431
interesting, this sort of 
chain of knowledge.  You know, 

00:40:33.432 --> 00:40:36.102
what fact would lead to the 
other.  The first interview, of 

00:40:36.103 --> 00:40:40.194
course, was with Katherine 
Johnson.  And Katherine Johnson 

00:40:40.195 --> 00:40:42.227
mentioned a number of people in 
that first interview.

00:40:47.538 --> 00:40:48.759
One of them was Dorothy Vaughn 
whose name 

00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:51.603
I'd never heard of.  Dorothy 
Vaughn actually left, retired, 

00:40:51.604 --> 00:40:57.729
shortly after my father started 
working there.  And she 

00:40:59.593 --> 00:41:01.611
mentioned Mary Jackson, who 
actually I did know, because she

00:41:01.612 --> 00:41:03.612
had 

00:41:04.698 --> 00:41:06.758
worked with my father in the 
early part of his career.  She 

00:41:11.476 --> 00:41:13.310
mentioned Christine Dardin who 
is in the book but not in the 

00:41:13.311 --> 00:41:17.433
movie because she went to school
with and is part of the next 

00:41:17.434 --> 00:41:20.499
generation of engineers.
   Every time I got a clue, I 

00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:22.500
would have to go off and 
condition 

00:41:25.650 --> 00:41:26.250
of like an archeologist sort of 
excavate the information.  The 

00:41:26.251 --> 00:41:29.135
information was there.  It was 
really there.  But it had never 

00:41:32.422 --> 00:41:35.345
been colated into one place.  A 
lot of work in the National 

00:41:40.706 --> 00:41:42.706
Archives, the NASA History 
Office, and 

00:41:45.245 --> 00:41:47.685
the NASA Langley History 
Office were particularly useful.

00:41:52.061 --> 00:41:54.094
Interviews with the women's 
children and colleagues, there 

00:41:54.095 --> 00:41:56.960
was so much information.  And 
then, really, this wonderful 

00:41:56.961 --> 00:41:58.961
opportunity to go into the math 
and 

00:42:00.052 --> 00:42:01.269
the science and the engineering 
itself.  And spending so much 

00:42:01.270 --> 00:42:07.039
time with the actual reports 
that these women worked on.

00:42:10.763 --> 00:42:12.183
And it was such an incredible, 
like being in a time machine.

00:42:12.184 --> 00:42:15.504
   Every morning I'd get up and 
have my research task.

00:42:17.130 --> 00:42:19.130
It was like I'd jump in the time
machine.

00:42:19.782 --> 00:42:21.782
And I went back to 1943.

00:42:25.022 --> 00:42:27.022
And sometimes it was about Aaron
airplane, because they were 

00:42:31.590 --> 00:42:33.590
working on airplanes before 
spaceships.

00:42:35.130 --> 00:42:37.130
Sometimes it was about the civil
rights legislation that 

00:42:37.987 --> 00:42:39.614
opened up public schools and 
public accommodations and all 

00:42:39.615 --> 00:42:41.615
these 
other things.

00:42:42.713 --> 00:42:44.762
Sometimes it was about women and
how women made breakthroughs 

00:42:44.763 --> 00:42:47.034
in World War II and such.

00:42:50.740 --> 00:42:52.394
So I got this incredible 
research.

00:42:52.395 --> 00:42:54.628
And it was like the people came 
back to life.  I wish I had 

00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:57.657
known Dorothy Vaughn.  That's 
one of my great regrets through 

00:42:57.658 --> 00:42:59.658
this.

00:43:01.342 --> 00:43:03.342
But I feel as if I have gotten 
to know her.

00:43:04.210 --> 00:43:06.210
From having spent so much time 
with the documents and the 

00:43:06.432 --> 00:43:09.117
people who knew her.
   So it was overwhelming.

00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:17.262
The hardest part was wrestling 
this information into a 

00:43:17.263 --> 00:43:19.331
narrative.
   And doing it in a way that 

00:43:19.332 --> 00:43:21.332
the people lead the story.

00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:28.020
That it wasn't just 1963 John 
Glenn did this.

00:43:30.589 --> 00:43:32.589
It was always about these women,
a story they knew.

00:43:34.137 --> 00:43:36.137
A story where they got to be the
protagonisted.

00:43:38.060 --> 00:43:40.060
And that it was always a human 
story, that it always 

00:43:40.715 --> 00:43:42.715
connected back to them as 
people, and 

00:43:44.995 --> 00:43:46.995
not just the historical 
facts.

00:43:48.709 --> 00:43:51.483
&gt;&gt;  My impression is a lot of 
women went into science, 

00:43:52.119 --> 00:43:53.555
correct me if I'm wrong, went 
into science during the war, 

00:43:53.556 --> 00:43:55.556
when 

00:43:56.713 --> 00:43:58.713
the colleges and universities, 
the men had all gone to war.

00:44:00.092 --> 00:44:02.141
So more women went in.
   More people of different 

00:44:02.142 --> 00:44:04.155
races went in to those 
educational 

00:44:06.037 --> 00:44:08.438
spots that were suddenly open.
   &gt;&gt;  Absolutely.

00:44:09.535 --> 00:44:11.535
&gt;&gt;  Is this what happens in the 
process of these women's 

00:44:12.672 --> 00:44:15.602
lives, that they were given 
opportunities by virtue of the 

00:44:15.603 --> 00:44:20.100
circumstance of the war?
   &gt;&gt; MARGOT:  It was.  World 

00:44:20.101 --> 00:44:21.954
War II transformed our country 
in 

00:44:21.955 --> 00:44:23.955
so many different ways.

00:44:27.052 --> 00:44:29.052
Legally, there was an executive 
order that forbade 

00:44:31.351 --> 00:44:32.363
discrimination in the civil 
service, and that was the thing 

00:44:32.364 --> 00:44:34.450
that 
opened the door for these women.

00:44:34.451 --> 00:44:38.354
   But then just supply and 
demand.  The men were off in the

00:44:38.355 --> 00:44:40.421
war.
   And these women were really 

00:44:40.422 --> 00:44:43.083
good at math.
   I mean they were math 

00:44:43.084 --> 00:44:45.084
teachers, most of them, before 
they 

00:44:45.114 --> 00:44:47.114
came there.

00:44:48.739 --> 00:44:50.739
But

00:44:52.314 --> 00:44:54.314
they were exceptionally talented
mathematicians.  Once 

00:44:55.994 --> 00:44:57.009
that door opened, those women 
took a seat, and that changed 

00:44:57.010 --> 00:44:59.010
our 
country.

00:45:00.111 --> 00:45:02.111
&gt;&gt;  There is a wonderful scene 
in the 

00:45:05.389 --> 00:45:07.389
movie where

00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:13.263
that 
outrage is clear.  It actually, 

00:45:13.264 --> 00:45:17.593
as I understand it from the 
book, Katherine Johnson was not 

00:45:17.594 --> 00:45:19.594
doing 

00:45:20.861 --> 00:45:22.685
the 800-meter hike.  She 
was actually using the bathroom 

00:45:22.686 --> 00:45:26.973
right there, and nobody there 
said anything, because she was 

00:45:26.974 --> 00:45:32.674
such a proud, elegant -- 
obviously, nobody is going to 

00:45:32.675 --> 00:45:35.194
say anything to her.
   So there are differences in 

00:45:35.195 --> 00:45:37.195
the movie and the reality and 
the 

00:45:37.669 --> 00:45:39.669
movie.

00:45:42.991 --> 00:45:44.991
Tell us about your decision to 
sort 

00:45:46.074 --> 00:45:48.510
of conflate some people 
into one, for instance, and 

00:45:48.511 --> 00:45:50.511
change the time a little bit, 
and 

00:45:52.230 --> 00:45:54.230
those decisions which had to be 
made, obviously.

00:45:58.200 --> 00:45:59.624
&gt;&gt; DONNA:  They too do, do, 
because movies fall into 

00:45:59.625 --> 00:46:04.384
structure and 
you need a dramatic arc.  It is 

00:46:04.385 --> 00:46:06.385
true that the bathrooms had been

00:46:09.762 --> 00:46:11.762
desegregated at NASA before the 
time period.

00:46:14.599 --> 00:46:16.599
&gt;&gt;  Everybody knew that 
happened,?

00:46:19.155 --> 00:46:21.155
&gt;&gt; DONNA:  Margot's father was 
very adamant about it.  He 

00:46:21.207 --> 00:46:24.313
said, "It's not true." But I 
said," It's the movies."

00:46:25.116 --> 00:46:27.375
[Laughter]
   I take full responsibility 

00:46:27.376 --> 00:46:29.376
for 

00:46:31.667 --> 00:46:33.322
putting Katherine Johnson in 
Mission Control at the end of 

00:46:33.323 --> 00:46:35.323
the movie.  That's not true.  

00:46:38.566 --> 00:46:40.872
There was no woman in Mission 
Control.  It had to be another 

00:46:40.873 --> 00:46:43.117
ten 
years before there was a woman 

00:46:43.118 --> 00:46:45.118
in that room.  What would you 
have done?

00:46:48.242 --> 00:46:49.264
You have to have a moment of 
triumph for the 

00:46:49.265 --> 00:46:51.488
character on some level.  You 
kind of have to take those 

00:46:51.489 --> 00:46:53.489
leaps.  

00:46:56.586 --> 00:46:58.009
Which is which it says "inspired
by a true story" on the front 

00:46:58.010 --> 00:47:01.317
of the movie.  It doesn't say 
"true story.

00:47:05.020 --> 00:47:07.020
" We did have to take 
those leaps.

00:47:08.066 --> 00:47:09.124
&gt;&gt;  Ultimately true, you will 
say.

00:47:09.125 --> 00:47:12.418
&gt;&gt; DONNA:  Right.
   &gt;&gt;  Let's talk about this 

00:47:12.419 --> 00:47:14.419
culture -- the culture in NASA 
has 

00:47:14.472 --> 00:47:18.587
obviously changed.  We've now 
had African American astronauts,

00:47:21.849 --> 00:47:23.671
and African American 
administrators, deputy 

00:47:23.672 --> 00:47:26.329
administrator, chief 
deputy administrator, chief 

00:47:26.330 --> 00:47:30.625
scientist.  Right.  How is that 
progress?  How did it happen?  

00:47:30.626 --> 00:47:37.396
Was it tough going?  Did the 
doors fling open at some point? 

00:47:37.397 --> 00:47:39.931
How did that progress?
   &gt;&gt; MARGOT:  The interesting 

00:47:39.932 --> 00:47:41.932
thing about NASA, as a 
government 

00:47:42.797 --> 00:47:45.064
entity, it was always more 
progressive than the aircraft 

00:47:45.065 --> 00:47:48.171
industries and the contractors 
and things like that.

00:47:49.661 --> 00:47:50.679
I think that's sort of the 
reasons why I was able to grow 

00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:53.538
up 
and see this critical mass of 

00:47:53.539 --> 00:47:56.201
women, of all backgrounds, who 
were working there.

00:47:59.279 --> 00:48:01.552
My father working there, it was 
a more open work environment.

00:48:05.635 --> 00:48:06.449
You know, the doors were, you 
know, more open to different 

00:48:06.450 --> 00:48:08.722
kinds of people.

00:48:13.858 --> 00:48:15.858
And so I think in that sense, 
NASA, 

00:48:17.087 --> 00:48:19.560
you know, the DNA was 
sort of set, way back then.

00:48:23.029 --> 00:48:23.843
I do think that there is a 
direct relationship between what

00:48:27.107 --> 00:48:29.107
those women were able to do and 
their accomplishments.

00:48:30.881 --> 00:48:32.881
And the fact that this agency 

00:48:34.408 --> 00:48:36.458
eventually had, you know, an 
African American administrator.

00:48:40.936 --> 00:48:42.175
Several female center chiefs, 
African American center 

00:48:42.176 --> 00:48:44.829
directors.
   So, you know, I think when we

00:48:44.830 --> 00:48:48.319
talk about sort of the 
implications, the larger 

00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:50.320
implications for this story and 
for 

00:48:52.851 --> 00:48:54.882
organizations today, I do think 
that when you put that into the 

00:48:54.883 --> 00:48:59.984
organizational DNA and you make 
it possible for talented people,

00:49:04.683 --> 00:49:05.700
regardless of who they are, to 
go as far as their account will 

00:49:05.701 --> 00:49:08.337
take them and contribute to the 
organization, then you get the 

00:49:08.338 --> 00:49:11.214
people at the top who, you know,
are also able to do that.

00:49:19.218 --> 00:49:20.022
And if you want to have 
CEO-suite level people who are 

00:49:20.023 --> 00:49:23.503
diverse and female and look like
America, well, you've got to 

00:49:26.559 --> 00:49:27.396
start with that base level DNA 
at the organization.  I think 

00:49:27.397 --> 00:49:31.692
that's one of the stories, 
important take-aways from this 

00:49:31.693 --> 00:49:35.982
story.
   &gt;&gt;  Absolutely.  Absolutely. 

00:49:35.983 --> 00:49:37.983
And I am sure that you heard 

00:49:39.526 --> 00:49:41.454
from people out there how your 
book and this story and the film

00:49:47.999 --> 00:49:50.133
and the whole sort of composite 
has inspired people, young 

00:49:53.402 --> 00:49:55.650
women, girls, to go into STEM 
courses, which is so important 

00:49:55.651 --> 00:49:57.651
in 
this country today.

00:49:59.537 --> 00:50:01.537
What sort of reaction have you 
been getting in that realm 

00:50:02.587 --> 00:50:06.113
from educators?
   &gt;&gt; DONNA:  We joke about 

00:50:06.114 --> 00:50:08.602
this, that "Hidden Figures" 
exposes 

00:50:10.191 --> 00:50:13.107
a magical word.  I had something
to do with "Hidden Figures".  

00:50:13.108 --> 00:50:16.779
It's almost more than the book 
and the film.  It feels like a 

00:50:16.780 --> 00:50:18.780
movement on some level.

00:50:21.485 --> 00:50:23.485
And the thing that's exciting 
for the 

00:50:24.547 --> 00:50:26.547
both of us, I think, is 

00:50:28.415 --> 00:50:29.453
that the -- I think this is 
true, that one of the most 

00:50:29.454 --> 00:50:31.454
important 

00:50:36.069 --> 00:50:37.938
ways that you can shift the 
culture is to portray women or 

00:50:37.939 --> 00:50:40.929
people of color in a way that is
surprising and new.

00:50:43.582 --> 00:50:45.582
And what is engendered from that
is a new way of thinking.

00:50:49.634 --> 00:50:51.657
And that's what we've seen in 
terms of Black Girls Code and 

00:50:56.417 --> 00:50:58.417
it goes on and on and on.

00:50:59.672 --> 00:51:01.697
Remind me what you said over 
dinner about India.

00:51:02.516 --> 00:51:04.516
&gt;&gt; MARGOT:  "Hidden Figures" has
become a term.  I have this 

00:51:07.185 --> 00:51:09.295
Google alert that sets up for 
"Hidden Figures" and I just pick

00:51:09.296 --> 00:51:12.387
up all the articles that mention
"Hidden Figures".  It's 

00:51:15.888 --> 00:51:16.929
everything from the local 
association wherever in Virginia

00:51:16.930 --> 00:51:19.172
is 
going to be screening the movie 

00:51:19.173 --> 00:51:21.229
to, like, this event will turn 
up or whatever.

00:51:25.855 --> 00:51:26.571
The "Hidden Figures" of India's 
agriculture 

00:51:26.572 --> 00:51:28.572
industry, or something.  You 
know?

00:51:29.436 --> 00:51:31.436
This is something that people --
I mean talking about the 

00:51:34.528 --> 00:51:35.952
movement, people are like, "I 
knew there was more than I was 

00:51:35.953 --> 00:51:39.481
being told.  I knew there were 
people out there doing these 

00:51:39.482 --> 00:51:42.173
different things.  I didn't know
how to find them.  I didn't 

00:51:43.823 --> 00:51:48.118
know where to find them."
   I think that's the energy.  

00:51:48.119 --> 00:51:50.119
Like, oh, my God, I see the 
success.

00:51:53.206 --> 00:51:54.637
And now I have a completer idea 
of the world and what 

00:51:54.638 --> 00:51:56.638
I might do in the world.

00:51:59.709 --> 00:52:02.256
And the girls, I don't know if I
told you this, I got this 

00:52:03.899 --> 00:52:05.558
tweet last year, and this mom 
was like, "I have this daughter 

00:52:05.559 --> 00:52:09.662
who is 9 years old and in the 
fourth grade and she's very math

00:52:15.196 --> 00:52:17.196
phobic and she tried so," and 
she tried 

00:52:19.486 --> 00:52:21.486
so hard to get her to -- it 
wasn't that 

00:52:22.797 --> 00:52:24.642
she was bad at math but she had 
a phobia, a block.  She saw the 

00:52:24.643 --> 00:52:28.204
movie.
   She said her daughter said to

00:52:28.205 --> 00:52:30.205
her on the eve of a math test, 

00:52:34.274 --> 00:52:34.505
the numbers are going into my 
head just like Dorothy Vaughn.

00:52:34.506 --> 00:52:37.147
   [Laughter]
   And you say to yourself, wow.

00:52:39.176 --> 00:52:41.176
That is humbling to hear a 
story like that.

00:52:41.444 --> 00:52:43.444
&gt;&gt;  That's wonderful.  That is 
really wonderful.

00:52:43.902 --> 00:52:46.575
We want to open it up to 
questions from the audience.  We

00:52:50.952 --> 00:52:51.378
have two mics that are going to 
roam.  Anybody who would like 

00:52:54.659 --> 00:52:56.505
that, we welcome our your 
questions.  I would just ask 

00:52:56.506 --> 00:52:58.590
that you 
please stand when you ask a 

00:52:58.591 --> 00:53:00.591
question and that you hold the 
mic, 

00:53:02.729 --> 00:53:04.781
speak into the mic, so that we 
can actually hear you and record

00:53:04.782 --> 00:53:13.769
you.  Any questions out there?
   Over here.  Okay.

00:53:16.649 --> 00:53:18.510
Wait for the mic, please.  Thank
you.

00:53:18.511 --> 00:53:19.943
&gt;&gt;  Thank you for wonderful 
presentation.  Very inspiring 

00:53:19.944 --> 00:53:21.944
for 

00:53:24.079 --> 00:53:26.079
all of us, women and for young 
people.

00:53:29.803 --> 00:53:30.986
I just want to say about your 
idea about "Hidden Figures" and 

00:53:35.359 --> 00:53:37.851
you wrote about in mathematics 
and NASA and so on.  Why not to 

00:53:37.852 --> 00:53:39.852
go further?

00:53:45.255 --> 00:53:47.255
A lot of hidden figures in other
industries and 

00:53:48.563 --> 00:53:50.563
other places.

00:53:51.659 --> 00:53:53.708
Sometimes women really don't 
have a voice.  Maybe 

00:53:54.316 --> 00:53:56.794
to go further.  It's just an 
invitation.  It's just an idea 

00:53:56.795 --> 00:53:58.795
to 

00:54:00.301 --> 00:54:02.301
discuss more about women's roles
in different, other places, 

00:54:03.609 --> 00:54:05.683
other industries, and so on.  
Thank you.

00:54:11.449 --> 00:54:12.451
.
   &gt;&gt; DONNA:  That's a good 

00:54:12.452 --> 00:54:16.790
idea.  Maybe you should consider
volume two and three.  Thank you

00:54:16.791 --> 00:54:18.791
very much for that.
   [Laughter]

00:54:19.463 --> 00:54:22.725
&gt;&gt;  Other questions?  Thank you.
Right here?  Oh, over 

00:54:22.726 --> 00:54:25.587
there.  Sorry.
   &gt;&gt;  I'm just wondering in the

00:54:25.588 --> 00:54:27.588
course of writing the book and 

00:54:30.348 --> 00:54:32.385
gathering all the research, what
personal transformation did you 

00:54:32.386 --> 00:54:37.142
undergo during the process?
   &gt;&gt; MARGOT:  Personal 

00:54:37.143 --> 00:54:38.356
transformation over the course 
of 

00:54:38.357 --> 00:54:41.623
writing the book?  Honestly, the
biggest transformation is that 

00:54:46.369 --> 00:54:48.369
I am now a professional writer.

00:54:51.052 --> 00:54:53.762
[Laughter] [applause] I'm a 
full-time writer.  I've done a 

00:54:53.763 --> 00:54:55.763
lot of the different things.  I 

00:54:58.680 --> 00:54:59.335
was an investment banker and 
worked in the internet industry.

00:54:59.336 --> 00:55:04.040
This is the best job I've ever 
had.  I'm working on a new book.

00:55:04.438 --> 00:55:08.149
It's very exciting.  I've gotten
to know people like Donna.  And 

00:55:08.150 --> 00:55:12.861
I've come to look at history in 
a different way.  I've gotten to

00:55:12.862 --> 00:55:17.357
know so much about our country's
history.  I've gotten to know 

00:55:17.358 --> 00:55:20.624
people who have influenced the 
course of history that have sort

00:55:20.625 --> 00:55:24.147
of disappeared from view.  That,
to me, this thing of being a 

00:55:24.148 --> 00:55:28.636
writer and the privilege of 
getting to do that, as a 

00:55:28.637 --> 00:55:33.569
full-time 
job, is phenomenal.  I'm very 

00:55:33.570 --> 00:55:35.570
grateful for that.

00:55:39.144 --> 00:55:41.144
&gt;&gt;  So Margot, can you tell us 
about your book?

00:55:43.406 --> 00:55:46.135
&gt;&gt; MARGOT:  or will that 
hex it if you do?

00:55:47.154 --> 00:55:48.568
&gt;&gt; MARGOT:  It's not a hex.  
During the research, which was 

00:55:48.569 --> 00:55:50.569
the wonderful time machine I got
to 

00:55:53.512 --> 00:55:55.512
visit people in 1943 and 

00:55:57.234 --> 00:55:58.434
1957 and this sort of thing, I 
really felt like that's what it 

00:55:58.435 --> 00:56:01.574
was like.  I just kept coming 
across these 

00:56:05.845 --> 00:56:06.868
amazing amazing stories of 
people like Katherine Johnson 

00:56:06.869 --> 00:56:08.869
who were just doing their jobs 
and 

00:56:11.989 --> 00:56:13.915
making differences and we didn't
know who they were.  I decided 

00:56:16.933 --> 00:56:17.912
if I had a chance to write a 
different book, I had a little 

00:56:17.913 --> 00:56:19.955
file 
of stories I wanted to work on.

00:56:23.438 --> 00:56:26.237
And sort of the hidden figures 
series, nonfiction, as I come to

00:56:26.238 --> 00:56:29.934
think of it, that these 
stories, African American 

00:56:29.935 --> 00:56:33.413
protagonists, same time period, 
because I'm really obsessed with

00:56:33.414 --> 00:56:35.890
that time period, really, like 

00:56:40.420 --> 00:56:42.837
mid 30s to the '70s, totally 
obsessed with that time period, 

00:56:42.838 --> 00:56:45.134
who 
were real protagonists and did 

00:56:45.322 --> 00:56:47.322
interesting things.

00:56:49.356 --> 00:56:51.356
The next book takes place in 
Baltimore and it 

00:56:55.129 --> 00:56:57.129
has to do with 
businesspeople.  [Applause]

00:56:57.927 --> 00:57:03.913
&gt;&gt;  Very good.  Over here?
   &gt;&gt;  Hi.  This is a question 

00:57:03.914 --> 00:57:07.823
for Donna.  Do you -- did you 
ever consider doing this as a 

00:57:09.859 --> 00:57:13.127
documentary, given that it was a
nonfiction book?  And why or why

00:57:13.128 --> 00:57:17.202
not?
   &gt;&gt; DONNA:  No.  I didn't 

00:57:17.203 --> 00:57:19.203
consider it doing as a doc.  I 

00:57:22.201 --> 00:57:24.650
thought it would have a wider 
audience if it was a fictional 

00:57:28.147 --> 00:57:31.610
film or a feature film.  But a 
doc would be interesting.  Just 

00:57:31.611 --> 00:57:35.287
because there are things that 
we, you know, the specifics in 

00:57:35.288 --> 00:57:37.288
the 

00:57:38.584 --> 00:57:41.270
film that we couldn't really 
dive into.  Are you a 

00:57:41.271 --> 00:57:43.271
documentary 

00:57:44.550 --> 00:57:46.550
film maker?

00:57:49.890 --> 00:57:51.114
[Laughter] You missed an 
opportunity in making that 

00:57:51.115 --> 00:57:53.115
doc.

00:57:55.214 --> 00:57:58.878
[Laughter]
   &gt;&gt;  Anybody else?  We had a 

00:57:58.879 --> 00:58:01.141
question down here, I believe.  
Okay.

00:58:02.783 --> 00:58:05.417
&gt;&gt;  Sorry if I missed it.  Can 
you tell me again how you two 

00:58:05.418 --> 00:58:07.418
met?

00:58:08.551 --> 00:58:10.404
Can you remind us how you two 
met?

00:58:10.405 --> 00:58:12.405
&gt;&gt; DONNA:  How the two of us 
met?

00:58:14.055 --> 00:58:16.055
I called her up in the --
   &gt;&gt;  In the parking lot.

00:58:19.218 --> 00:58:24.016
&gt;&gt; DONNA:  In the parking lot of
the Food Lion.  That was it.  

00:58:27.292 --> 00:58:28.297
I read her proposal and I said 
to her agent, "I must speak to 

00:58:32.018 --> 00:58:34.018
this woman," and I got the phone
number and dialed it.

00:58:34.752 --> 00:58:38.278
&gt;&gt;  So it was through the agent.
   &gt;&gt; DONNA:  It really was.  

00:58:38.279 --> 00:58:40.336
But it's been a happy story 
between us.

00:58:41.159 --> 00:58:43.159
&gt;&gt;  Very happy story.

00:58:46.546 --> 00:58:48.546
&gt;&gt;  Over here.
   &gt;&gt;  Hi.

00:58:51.509 --> 00:58:54.397
This question is for Margot.
   &gt;&gt;  You're next, okay?

00:58:56.470 --> 00:58:58.470
&gt;&gt;  One thing that really struck
me was you talking about 

00:58:59.367 --> 00:59:02.010
your book being a love letter to
Hampton, Virginia.  I went to 

00:59:02.011 --> 00:59:04.079
Tuskegee University.

00:59:07.979 --> 00:59:09.819
Our islands of excellence where 
we do see 

00:59:09.820 --> 00:59:11.874
people that look like us.  Where
you do see examples of black 

00:59:11.875 --> 00:59:15.167
success.  That makes such a huge
difference when you go forth in 

00:59:15.168 --> 00:59:17.168
the world.

00:59:21.419 --> 00:59:23.419
I guess my question is, HBCU 
seems to be on the 

00:59:23.889 --> 00:59:25.889
decline in some ways now.

00:59:27.371 --> 00:59:29.904
The towns around them aren't 
doing as 

00:59:27.371 --> 00:59:31.085
well.  Not as many students want
to go.  I wonder what that 

00:59:33.361 --> 00:59:35.787
means for the future?  Where do 
the next Katherine Johnsons come

00:59:35.788 --> 00:59:39.694
from and where is the community 
that's going to nurture them and

00:59:43.600 --> 00:59:46.251
tell them they're they can do 
anything?  Especially, to use 

00:59:46.252 --> 00:59:49.343
your word, 
the zeitgeist of the time?

00:59:52.817 --> 00:59:54.472
&gt;&gt; MARGOT:  I think that's a 
good question.  There were so 

00:59:54.473 --> 00:59:59.373
many products of Black colleges.
I was driving around Baltimore 

01:00:04.121 --> 01:00:05.772
today doing research for the 
book, and Morgan State is there.

01:00:05.773 --> 01:00:09.889
There are new buildings and 
obviously there's a lot of 

01:00:09.890 --> 01:00:12.565
energy.  
Another university that's there 

01:00:12.566 --> 01:00:16.244
has less energy.  There are 
issues that are facing many, 

01:00:16.245 --> 01:00:19.768
many institutions of higher 
education, not just Black 

01:00:19.769 --> 01:00:23.668
colleges, but a lot of the Black
colleges are really feeling 

01:00:23.669 --> 01:00:25.509
these issues.
   I went to the University of 

01:00:25.510 --> 01:00:27.510
Virginia.

01:00:28.749 --> 01:00:34.562
So my parents went to 
Black colleges.  I didn't.  So 

01:00:34.563 --> 01:00:36.563
doing this research, it was just

01:00:41.044 --> 01:00:43.946
an amazing, full panoramic view 
of the support and excellence 

01:00:43.947 --> 01:00:47.406
and concentration of talent, 
particularly during that time 

01:00:47.407 --> 01:00:49.407
period.

01:00:51.103 --> 01:00:52.755
But I think, for example, 
Spelman is a tremendous success 

01:00:52.756 --> 01:00:54.756
story.

01:00:59.092 --> 01:00:59.298
When we talk about the 
intersection of Black colleges 

01:00:59.299 --> 01:01:01.749
and STEM, they're doing 
extremely well.

01:01:04.824 --> 01:01:07.310
I think Spelman College 
sends more Black women to STEM 

01:01:07.311 --> 01:01:11.810
Ph.D. programs than any other 
school in the country.  I think 

01:01:11.811 --> 01:01:15.306
that may be true.  You know, and
I think this is also an issue at

01:01:15.307 --> 01:01:18.191
women's colleges, which was 

01:01:22.104 --> 01:01:23.390
another huge feeder for these 
jobs at NASA and many other 

01:01:23.391 --> 01:01:26.086
jobs.
   So I think that is a really, 

01:01:26.087 --> 01:01:28.923
really great question.

01:01:34.684 --> 01:01:36.684
And, you know, the HBCU's I feel
were another character in 

01:01:37.370 --> 01:01:39.370
this book, along with the Black 
newspapers, another hugely 

01:01:41.105 --> 01:01:43.105
important part of this legacy.

01:01:44.197 --> 01:01:46.197
And, you know, I consider myself
very much the beneficiary 

01:01:47.509 --> 01:01:49.509
and recipient of that legacy.
   &gt;&gt;  No doubt.

01:01:49.942 --> 01:01:53.852
&gt;&gt;  Yeah.  We have a question 
here, I believe.

01:01:58.152 --> 01:02:00.460
&gt;&gt;  What did you feel like were 
when you wrote a book or a 

01:02:01.271 --> 01:02:03.105
film?
   &gt;&gt; MARGOT:  What did I feel 

01:02:03.106 --> 01:02:06.796
like when I wrote the book?
   &gt;&gt;  What did you feel like 

01:02:06.797 --> 01:02:08.797
when you 

01:02:10.082 --> 01:02:12.082
wrote the book or the 
film?

01:02:13.367 --> 01:02:19.386
   &gt;&gt; MARGOT:  What did I feel 
like?  Wow.  No, this is a 

01:02:19.387 --> 01:02:21.417
really 
good question.

01:02:22.641 --> 01:02:24.641
&gt;&gt;  We all felt something when 
we read the book.

01:02:25.507 --> 01:02:28.235
&gt;&gt; MARGOT:  Well, you know, I 
have to say, the thing is it 

01:02:31.909 --> 01:02:34.171
was really hard.  [Laughter]

01:02:39.095 --> 01:02:41.644
It was both really, really 
enjoyable and I loved the 

01:02:44.300 --> 01:02:45.126
research, and I loved the 
writing, but it was really hard.

01:02:45.127 --> 01:02:47.127
It 
was hard.  It was hard.

01:02:50.659 --> 01:02:52.659
And a lot of it was hard because
I 

01:02:52.687 --> 01:02:55.223
wished I could get up in the 
morning and write with at 

01:03:00.310 --> 01:03:01.831
8:00 o'clock with a cup of 
coffee.  Graham Green supposedly

01:03:01.832 --> 01:03:05.921
did 
that.  But you know what?  I 

01:03:05.922 --> 01:03:08.589
waste an entire day and I don't 
really start writing until it's 

01:03:08.590 --> 01:03:12.472
like 11:30 at night.  And that's
really painful.  I wish it were 

01:03:12.473 --> 01:03:17.548
different, but it's not.
   &gt;&gt;  11:30.  In the morning?

01:03:17.971 --> 01:03:21.667
   &gt;&gt; MARGOT:  No, at night.
   &gt;&gt; DONNA:  Oh.

01:03:22.487 --> 01:03:23.910
[Laughter]
   &gt;&gt; MARGOT:  The most 

01:03:23.911 --> 01:03:26.377
productive time is 11:30 at 
night until 

01:03:30.473 --> 01:03:32.092
4 in the morning.
   &gt;&gt;  People don't realize a 

01:03:32.093 --> 01:03:34.093
lot of writing when you're 
writing 

01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:37.160
a book is up here, you're 
thinking it.

01:03:38.237 --> 01:03:39.665
And you could be doing 
the laundry and you're still 

01:03:39.666 --> 01:03:41.666
working it through somehow.  
When 

01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:43.778
you actually sit down, you've 
already done a lot of things.  

01:03:43.779 --> 01:03:46.488
So 
it's okay.

01:03:46.689 --> 01:03:48.689
&gt;&gt; MARGOT:  Okay.

01:03:50.622 --> 01:03:52.622
But the other thing I thought 
was I really 

01:03:53.422 --> 01:03:54.432
felt an obligation to really get
the stories of these women 

01:03:54.433 --> 01:03:58.407
right.  I wasn't writing about 
myself.  I was writing about 

01:03:58.408 --> 01:04:00.634
them.  So I felt a tremendous 
amount of pressure to represent 

01:04:00.635 --> 01:04:03.284
their stories in a way that was 
fair.

01:04:04.767 --> 01:04:07.023
&gt;&gt;  How about their families?
   Thank you for asking that 

01:04:07.024 --> 01:04:08.481
question, because it prompted 
this 

01:04:08.482 --> 01:04:12.013
question.  How about their 
families?  How did they feel 

01:04:12.014 --> 01:04:13.838
when 
they saw the book or when they 

01:04:13.839 --> 01:04:18.132
saw the movie?  The families of 
these women?

01:04:22.413 --> 01:04:24.413
Because it wasn't just the 
women.

01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:29.389
   &gt;&gt; DONNA:  We went down to 
Hampton to show Katherine 

01:04:29.390 --> 01:04:31.390
Johnson 
the film.

01:04:34.762 --> 01:04:35.570
Which is really a nerve wracking
experience.

01:04:35.571 --> 01:04:37.657
&gt;&gt;  Right.
   &gt;&gt; DONNA:  You know, you have

01:04:37.658 --> 01:04:40.949
her life in your hands, which 
you're portraying.

01:04:44.424 --> 01:04:46.424
Her two daughters were with her.
She gets 

01:04:48.131 --> 01:04:49.751
around principally in a 
wheelchair.  So we rented out a 

01:04:49.752 --> 01:04:51.419
movie 
theater in Hampton, and her 

01:04:51.420 --> 01:04:53.420
daughters and she came and 
watched 

01:04:54.129 --> 01:04:56.984
the film.  I mean I was in the 
back thinking, "I don't know.  I

01:04:56.985 --> 01:04:58.985
don't know."

01:05:00.661 --> 01:05:02.893
And then I heard snuffling at 
the end.  And there were a lot 

01:05:06.361 --> 01:05:07.167
of hankies that were being 
spread among these three women. 

01:05:07.168 --> 01:05:09.168
And 
that's when I knew we were okay.

01:05:11.057 --> 01:05:13.138
And both of her daughters were 
very moved by it.

01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:19.840
And Katherine, again, I think 
she's -- she's 

01:05:22.716 --> 01:05:23.936
not an overly effusive 
personalty, but she approved of 

01:05:23.937 --> 01:05:29.457
it.  And 
it was a big deal.

01:05:31.692 --> 01:05:32.697
&gt;&gt;  Recording your life like 
that.

01:05:32.698 --> 01:05:34.698
&gt;&gt; DONNA:  Exactly.

01:05:38.284 --> 01:05:40.334
&gt;&gt;  I want to congratulate you, 
Margot, and you, Donna, you 

01:05:42.371 --> 01:05:45.006
have done wonderful work 
bringing these stories to us as 

01:05:45.007 --> 01:05:48.332
an 
audience, as the public.  We 

01:05:48.333 --> 01:05:51.909
just want more of these stories.
And keep it up.  And 

01:05:51.910 --> 01:06:01.289
congratulations.
   [Applause.]

01:06:04.388 --> 01:06:06.388
&gt;&gt;  You can find Margot out 
there signing books.

01:06:08.422 --> 01:06:08.712
And I hope 
you will take the opportunity to

01:06:08.713 --> 01:06:13.241
meet her and say hello.  Thank 
you for something.  Thank you 

01:06:13.242 --> 01:06:15.242
very much.

01:06:17.873 --> 01:06:22.244
[Applause].
   &gt;&gt;  That was fun.
