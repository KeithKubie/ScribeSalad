going to do campus-wide lighting survey
 

00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:18.850
going to do campus-wide lighting survey
we're gonna look at tying that because

we're gonna look at tying that because
 

00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:20.919
we're gonna look at tying that because
this you know we got to show payback so

00:22:20.919 --> 00:22:20.929
this you know we got to show payback so
 

00:22:20.929 --> 00:22:23.049
this you know we got to show payback so
that lighting survey will include some

00:22:23.049 --> 00:22:23.059

doing studies you know we wanted it to

00:22:35.710 --> 00:22:35.720
doing studies you know we wanted it to

then one of the big things that we're

00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:42.200
then one of the big things that we're
 

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:46.299
then one of the big things that we're
doing is trying to figure out what are

00:22:46.299 --> 00:22:46.309
doing is trying to figure out what are
 

00:22:46.309 --> 00:22:50.830
doing is trying to figure out what are
our target EU is across the campus as I

our target EU is across the campus as I
 

00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:52.000
our target EU is across the campus as I
mentioned we got some buildings that are

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:52.010
mentioned we got some buildings that are
 

00:22:52.010 --> 00:22:54.490
mentioned we got some buildings that are
about a hundred years old some buildings

00:22:54.490 --> 00:22:54.500
about a hundred years old some buildings
 

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:57.340
about a hundred years old some buildings
that are much newer so are as you can

00:22:57.340 --> 00:22:57.350
that are much newer so are as you can
 

00:22:57.350 --> 00:23:00.190
that are much newer so are as you can
imagine our energy use intensity is it's

00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:00.200
imagine our energy use intensity is it's
 

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:02.860
imagine our energy use intensity is it's
all over the map and we're trying to

00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:02.870
all over the map and we're trying to
 

00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:05.620
all over the map and we're trying to
find those targets that are reasonable

00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:05.630
find those targets that are reasonable
 

00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:09.400
find those targets that are reasonable
and worth the investment in those older

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:09.410
and worth the investment in those older
 

00:23:09.410 --> 00:23:11.950
and worth the investment in those older
buildings and then seeing what we can

00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:11.960
buildings and then seeing what we can
 

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:14.380
buildings and then seeing what we can
also do even in the newer buildings to

00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:14.390
also do even in the newer buildings to
 

00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:16.419
also do even in the newer buildings to
tighten that up and so we are in the

00:23:16.419 --> 00:23:16.429
tighten that up and so we are in the
 

00:23:16.429 --> 00:23:19.230
tighten that up and so we are in the
process right now of trying to define

00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:19.240
process right now of trying to define
 

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:23.409
process right now of trying to define
with our design partners what a status

00:23:23.409 --> 00:23:23.419
with our design partners what a status
 

00:23:23.419 --> 00:23:28.780
with our design partners what a status
quo a better and a best might cost and

00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:28.790
quo a better and a best might cost and
 

00:23:28.790 --> 00:23:30.730
quo a better and a best might cost and
what those target EU eyes would look

00:23:30.730 --> 00:23:30.740
what those target EU eyes would look
 

00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:34.450
what those target EU eyes would look
like and so then you would as we go

00:23:34.450 --> 00:23:34.460
like and so then you would as we go
 

00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:36.400
like and so then you would as we go
through the design process we would say

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:36.410
through the design process we would say
 

00:23:36.410 --> 00:23:39.070
through the design process we would say
hey you know we want you to in the

00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:39.080
hey you know we want you to in the

easy is it to implement it what's the
 

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:42.350
easy is it to implement it what's the
payback associated with it because we

00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:42.360
payback associated with it because we
 

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:43.730
payback associated with it because we
really want to implement the projects

00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:43.740
really want to implement the projects
 

00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:44.750
really want to implement the projects
that are going to touch the most

00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:44.760
that are going to touch the most
 

00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:47.450
that are going to touch the most
locations most dramatically first to

locations most dramatically first to
 

00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:49.160
locations most dramatically first to
generate the most savings and then we

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:49.170
generate the most savings and then we
 

00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:51.140
generate the most savings and then we
can take that savings and use it to

00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:51.150
can take that savings and use it to
 

00:26:51.150 --> 00:26:54.380
can take that savings and use it to
justify additional projects as well so

00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:54.390
justify additional projects as well so
 

00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:56.200
justify additional projects as well so
really that cross-functional team is

00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:56.210
really that cross-functional team is
 

00:26:56.210 --> 00:26:59.780
really that cross-functional team is
really key in implementing projects one

really rigorously testing it I love
doing pilots because it's a way of

00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:15.750
doing pilots because it's a way of
 

00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:17.210
doing pilots because it's a way of
engaging people that aren't really

00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:17.220
engaging people that aren't really
 

00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:19.160
engaging people that aren't really
familiar with energy and sustainability

00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:19.170
familiar with energy and sustainability
 

00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:22.400
familiar with energy and sustainability
to show the value of a project one of my

00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:22.410
to show the value of a project one of my
 

00:27:22.410 --> 00:27:23.870
to show the value of a project one of my
favorite days that I've ever spent

00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:23.880
favorite days that I've ever spent
 

00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:26.270
favorite days that I've ever spent
working at Giant Eagle was the day that

00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:26.280
working at Giant Eagle was the day that
 

00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:28.340
working at Giant Eagle was the day that
we were doing an LED pilot on our sales

00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:28.350
we were doing an LED pilot on our sales
 

00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:30.410
we were doing an LED pilot on our sales
floor and what we did is we went into

00:27:30.410 --> 00:27:30.420
floor and what we did is we went into
 

00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:32.930
floor and what we did is we went into
one store and we retrofitted half of the

00:27:32.930 --> 00:27:32.940
one store and we retrofitted half of the
 

00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:35.660
one store and we retrofitted half of the
sales floor with LEDs and the other half

00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:35.670
sales floor with LEDs and the other half
 

00:27:35.670 --> 00:27:38.690
sales floor with LEDs and the other half
we left as fluorescents we then invited

00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:38.700
we left as fluorescents we then invited
 

00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:40.850
we left as fluorescents we then invited
all the executives to literally walk the

00:27:40.850 --> 00:27:40.860
all the executives to literally walk the
 

00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:43.130
all the executives to literally walk the
store so they could literally see priam

00:27:43.130 --> 00:27:43.140
store so they could literally see priam
 

00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:45.320
store so they could literally see priam
prost post project what we were trying

00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:45.330
prost post project what we were trying
 

00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:47.780
prost post project what we were trying
to do and at the same time I showed them

00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:47.790
to do and at the same time I showed them
 

00:27:47.790 --> 00:27:50.360
to do and at the same time I showed them
we have real time energy monitoring on

00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:50.370
we have real time energy monitoring on
 

00:27:50.370 --> 00:27:52.130
we have real time energy monitoring on
all of our stores so I used that as a

00:27:52.130 --> 00:27:52.140
all of our stores so I used that as a
 

00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:54.050
all of our stores so I used that as a
really valuable tool for telling the

00:27:54.050 --> 00:27:54.060
really valuable tool for telling the
 

00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:56.169
really valuable tool for telling the
energy story and I was literally able

00:27:56.169 --> 00:27:56.179
energy story and I was literally able
 

00:27:56.179 --> 00:27:58.450
energy story and I was literally able
show them exactly how much energy we

00:27:58.450 --> 00:27:58.460
show them exactly how much energy we
 

00:27:58.460 --> 00:28:00.129
show them exactly how much energy we
reduced they could see aesthetically

00:28:00.129 --> 00:28:00.139
reduced they could see aesthetically
 

00:28:00.139 --> 00:28:02.289
reduced they could see aesthetically
this won't help hurt the stores it's

00:28:02.289 --> 00:28:02.299
this won't help hurt the stores it's
 

00:28:02.299 --> 00:28:04.210
this won't help hurt the stores it's
gonna really improve our guest

00:28:04.210 --> 00:28:04.220
gonna really improve our guest
 

00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:06.159
gonna really improve our guest
experience and oh by the way this is

00:28:06.159 --> 00:28:06.169
experience and oh by the way this is
 

00:28:06.169 --> 00:28:07.960
experience and oh by the way this is
we're actually saving that much energy

00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:07.970
we're actually saving that much energy
 

00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:11.619
we're actually saving that much energy
they could physically see it so I think

00:28:11.619 --> 00:28:11.629
they could physically see it so I think
 

00:28:11.629 --> 00:28:13.480
they could physically see it so I think
that's really important when you pilot

00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:13.490
that's really important when you pilot
 

00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:14.799
that's really important when you pilot
projects it also gives you the

00:28:14.799 --> 00:28:14.809
projects it also gives you the
 

00:28:14.809 --> 00:28:16.450
projects it also gives you the
opportunity for feedback which is very

executives were going up to guests and

00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:20.480
executives were going up to guests and
 

00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:21.580
executives were going up to guests and
asking what do you think about these

00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:21.590
asking what do you think about these
 

00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:24.009

nice because we were able to get that
 

00:28:27.169 --> 00:28:28.899
nice because we were able to get that
feedback and go to team members that are

00:28:28.899 --> 00:28:28.909
feedback and go to team members that are
 

00:28:28.909 --> 00:28:30.310
feedback and go to team members that are
gonna be in the stores every single day

00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:30.320
gonna be in the stores every single day
 

00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:32.739
gonna be in the stores every single day
and ask how they feel about it so a lot

00:28:32.739 --> 00:28:32.749
and ask how they feel about it so a lot
 

00:28:32.749 --> 00:28:34.149
and ask how they feel about it so a lot
of times that's really helpful because I

00:28:34.149 --> 00:28:34.159
of times that's really helpful because I
 

00:28:34.159 --> 00:28:35.139
of times that's really helpful because I
mean you're when you're in that

00:28:35.139 --> 00:28:35.149
mean you're when you're in that
 

00:28:35.149 --> 00:28:36.850
mean you're when you're in that
highlighting stage you can refine the

00:28:36.850 --> 00:28:36.860
highlighting stage you can refine the
 

00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:39.129
highlighting stage you can refine the
rollout before you you know roll out

00:28:39.129 --> 00:28:39.139
rollout before you you know roll out
 

00:28:39.139 --> 00:28:40.450
rollout before you you know roll out
something to all the stores then realize

00:28:40.450 --> 00:28:40.460
something to all the stores then realize
 

00:28:40.460 --> 00:28:43.299
something to all the stores then realize
oh shoot I wish I had made these three

00:28:43.299 --> 00:28:43.309
oh shoot I wish I had made these three
 

00:28:43.309 --> 00:28:46.269
oh shoot I wish I had made these three
changes before doing so one thing that's

00:28:46.269 --> 00:28:46.279
changes before doing so one thing that's
 

00:28:46.279 --> 00:28:47.320
changes before doing so one thing that's
really important when you're talking

00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:47.330
really important when you're talking
 

00:28:47.330 --> 00:28:48.879
really important when you're talking
about implementing projects is to talk

00:28:48.879 --> 00:28:48.889
about implementing projects is to talk
 

00:28:48.889 --> 00:28:50.409
about implementing projects is to talk
about all of the benefits associated

00:28:50.409 --> 00:28:50.419
about all of the benefits associated
 

00:28:50.419 --> 00:28:52.600
about all of the benefits associated
with the project so it's not just energy

00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:52.610
with the project so it's not just energy
 

00:28:52.610 --> 00:28:54.519
with the project so it's not just energy
you have that aesthetic value you might

00:28:54.519 --> 00:28:54.529
you have that aesthetic value you might
 

00:28:54.529 --> 00:28:56.109
you have that aesthetic value you might
have maintenance savings so it's really

00:28:56.109 --> 00:28:56.119
have maintenance savings so it's really
 

00:28:56.119 --> 00:28:57.129
have maintenance savings so it's really
important that when you have that

00:28:57.129 --> 00:28:57.139
important that when you have that
 

00:28:57.139 --> 00:28:59.230
important that when you have that
cross-functional team it enables you to

00:28:59.230 --> 00:28:59.240
cross-functional team it enables you to
 

00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:01.389
cross-functional team it enables you to
look at a project very holistically and

00:29:01.389 --> 00:29:01.399
look at a project very holistically and
 

00:29:01.399 --> 00:29:02.919
look at a project very holistically and
talk about all the benefits associated

00:29:02.919 --> 00:29:02.929
talk about all the benefits associated
 

00:29:02.929 --> 00:29:06.940
talk about all the benefits associated
with it one thing that's also really key

00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:06.950
with it one thing that's also really key
 

00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:09.159
with it one thing that's also really key
into implementing rollouts is to kind of

00:29:09.159 --> 00:29:09.169
into implementing rollouts is to kind of
 

00:29:09.169 --> 00:29:10.989
into implementing rollouts is to kind of
minimize how many rollouts you have to

00:29:10.989 --> 00:29:10.999
minimize how many rollouts you have to
 

00:29:10.999 --> 00:29:12.940
minimize how many rollouts you have to
do so when you're doing something like a

00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:12.950
do so when you're doing something like a
 

00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:14.560
do so when you're doing something like a
lighting project you want to see are

00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:14.570
lighting project you want to see are
 

00:29:14.570 --> 00:29:16.600
lighting project you want to see are
there any kind of peripheral projects

00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:16.610
there any kind of peripheral projects
 

00:29:16.610 --> 00:29:18.970
there any kind of peripheral projects
that I want to pull into this rollout so

00:29:18.970 --> 00:29:18.980
that I want to pull into this rollout so
 

00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:21.580
that I want to pull into this rollout so
a really great example is where towards

00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:21.590
a really great example is where towards
 

00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:24.549
a really great example is where towards
the end of implementing LED across all

00:29:24.549 --> 00:29:24.559
the end of implementing LED across all
 

00:29:24.559 --> 00:29:26.919
the end of implementing LED across all
of our sales floor when we were at the

00:29:26.919 --> 00:29:26.929
of our sales floor when we were at the
 

00:29:26.929 --> 00:29:28.539
of our sales floor when we were at the
beginning of that projects we looked at

00:29:28.539 --> 00:29:28.549
beginning of that projects we looked at
 

00:29:28.549 --> 00:29:30.609
beginning of that projects we looked at
the lighting controls and we actually

00:29:30.609 --> 00:29:30.619
the lighting controls and we actually
 

00:29:30.619 --> 00:29:32.200
the lighting controls and we actually
realized we want to pair a dimming

00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:32.210
realized we want to pair a dimming
 

00:29:32.210 --> 00:29:35.019
realized we want to pair a dimming
system with this LED retrofit because we

00:29:35.019 --> 00:29:35.029
system with this LED retrofit because we
 

00:29:35.029 --> 00:29:37.509
system with this LED retrofit because we
can maximize the savings of the project

00:29:37.509 --> 00:29:37.519
can maximize the savings of the project
 

00:29:37.519 --> 00:29:39.070
can maximize the savings of the project
we're reducing upfront costs because now

00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:39.080
we're reducing upfront costs because now
 

00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:40.989
we're reducing upfront costs because now
we have one rollout instead of two

00:29:40.989 --> 00:29:40.999
we have one rollout instead of two
 

00:29:40.999 --> 00:29:43.779
we have one rollout instead of two
rollouts so that's something that's

00:29:43.779 --> 00:29:43.789
rollouts so that's something that's
 

00:29:43.789 --> 00:29:44.950
rollouts so that's something that's
really important you're implementing a

00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:44.960
really important you're implementing a
 

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:46.539
really important you're implementing a
project you want to make sure what other

00:29:46.539 --> 00:29:46.549
project you want to make sure what other
 

00:29:46.549 --> 00:29:48.730
project you want to make sure what other
projects do I want to wrap in to this

00:29:48.730 --> 00:29:48.740
projects do I want to wrap in to this
 

00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:51.639
projects do I want to wrap in to this
roll up one thing that I don't think

00:29:51.639 --> 00:29:51.649
roll up one thing that I don't think
 

00:29:51.649 --> 00:29:53.710
roll up one thing that I don't think
people talk about enough but I worry

00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:53.720
people talk about enough but I worry
 

00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:54.909
people talk about enough but I worry
about it all the time having 400

00:29:54.909 --> 00:29:54.919
about it all the time having 400
 

00:29:54.919 --> 00:29:58.359
about it all the time having 400
locations is how can we simplify energy

00:29:58.359 --> 00:29:58.369
locations is how can we simplify energy
 

00:29:58.369 --> 00:29:59.450
locations is how can we simplify energy
projects and

00:29:59.450 --> 00:29:59.460
projects and
 

00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:02.990
projects and
terms of implementation so I don't know

00:30:02.990 --> 00:30:03.000
terms of implementation so I don't know
 

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.820
terms of implementation so I don't know
hopefully people are familiar with giant

00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:04.830
hopefully people are familiar with giant
 

00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:06.799
hopefully people are familiar with giant
Eagle but here in the city if you think

00:30:06.799 --> 00:30:06.809
Eagle but here in the city if you think
 

00:30:06.809 --> 00:30:08.240

about all of our stores they're vastly

00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:08.250
about all of our stores they're vastly
 

00:30:08.250 --> 00:30:10.610
about all of our stores they're vastly
different from one another if you want

00:30:10.610 --> 00:30:10.620
different from one another if you want

different from one another if you want
an example go to the Giant Eagle in

00:30:12.289 --> 00:30:12.299
an example go to the Giant Eagle in
 

00:30:12.299 --> 00:30:13.669
an example go to the Giant Eagle in
Squirrel Hill and then go to our

00:30:13.669 --> 00:30:13.679
Squirrel Hill and then go to our
 

00:30:13.679 --> 00:30:15.289

incredibly different stores so when we

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:18.090
incredibly different stores so when we
 

00:30:18.090 --> 00:30:20.120
incredibly different stores so when we
do something like an led rollout I don't

00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:20.130
do something like an led rollout I don't
 

00:30:20.130 --> 00:30:22.220
do something like an led rollout I don't
have the time and internal resources to

00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:22.230
have the time and internal resources to
 

00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:24.139
have the time and internal resources to
necessarily do a custom solution at

00:30:24.139 --> 00:30:24.149
necessarily do a custom solution at
 

00:30:24.149 --> 00:30:26.450
necessarily do a custom solution at
every single store so how can I actually

00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:26.460
every single store so how can I actually
 

00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:28.549
every single store so how can I actually
roll this out in a time effective manner

00:30:28.549 --> 00:30:28.559
roll this out in a time effective manner
 

00:30:28.559 --> 00:30:30.380
roll this out in a time effective manner
I can't be upgrading our stores for the

00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:30.390
I can't be upgrading our stores for the
 

00:30:30.390 --> 00:30:31.820
I can't be upgrading our stores for the
next five years I need to get it done

00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:31.830
next five years I need to get it done
 

00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:35.960
next five years I need to get it done
within a year so this ties into the

00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:35.970
within a year so this ties into the
 

00:30:35.970 --> 00:30:37.940
within a year so this ties into the
dimming systems that we paired with our

00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:37.950
dimming systems that we paired with our
 

00:30:37.950 --> 00:30:41.389
dimming systems that we paired with our
LED retrofit rather than pick let's say

00:30:41.389 --> 00:30:41.399
LED retrofit rather than pick let's say
 

00:30:41.399 --> 00:30:42.740
LED retrofit rather than pick let's say
hundreds of different fixtures that we

00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:42.750
hundreds of different fixtures that we
 

00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:44.210
hundreds of different fixtures that we
would need to actually implement this

00:30:44.210 --> 00:30:44.220
would need to actually implement this
 

00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:45.830
would need to actually implement this
rollout we were able to narrow it down

00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:45.840
rollout we were able to narrow it down
 

00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:48.260
rollout we were able to narrow it down
to ten but but then because we have the

00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:48.270
to ten but but then because we have the
 

00:30:48.270 --> 00:30:50.480
to ten but but then because we have the
dimming control system we can then

00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:50.490
dimming control system we can then
 

00:30:50.490 --> 00:30:52.610
dimming control system we can then
custom the light levels at every single

00:30:52.610 --> 00:30:52.620
custom the light levels at every single
 

00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:55.490
custom the light levels at every single
store so it makes it very easy to do the

00:30:55.490 --> 00:30:55.500
store so it makes it very easy to do the
 

00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:57.320
store so it makes it very easy to do the
rollout and meet the needs of every

00:30:57.320 --> 00:30:57.330
rollout and meet the needs of every
 

00:30:57.330 --> 00:30:59.060
rollout and meet the needs of every
single store without having to go to

00:30:59.060 --> 00:30:59.070
single store without having to go to
 

00:30:59.070 --> 00:31:00.950
single store without having to go to
every single store do a lighting layout

00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:00.960
every single store do a lighting layout
 

00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:04.250
every single store do a lighting layout
to a light analysis and things like that

00:31:04.250 --> 00:31:04.260
to a light analysis and things like that
 

00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:05.779
to a light analysis and things like that
so it helps really ease the

00:31:05.779 --> 00:31:05.789
so it helps really ease the
 

00:31:05.789 --> 00:31:09.320
so it helps really ease the
implementation one thing you also have

00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:09.330
implementation one thing you also have
 

00:31:09.330 --> 00:31:11.510
implementation one thing you also have
to work with is all of your partners

when you're getting ready to do an
 

00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:14.659
when you're getting ready to do an
implementation project you have to

00:31:14.659 --> 00:31:14.669
implementation project you have to
 

00:31:14.669 --> 00:31:16.730
implementation project you have to
really be able to trust your vendors you

00:31:16.730 --> 00:31:16.740
really be able to trust your vendors you
 

00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:18.860
really be able to trust your vendors you
want to partner with your utilities if

00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:18.870

you can and also set expectations set

00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:25.770
you can and also set expectations set

want the outcome to be so everyone is on
 

00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:33.769
want the outcome to be so everyone is on
the same page and then when you actually

the same page and then when you actually
 

00:31:33.779 --> 00:31:35.389
the same page and then when you actually
start to implement the project make sure

00:31:35.389 --> 00:31:35.399
start to implement the project make sure
 

00:31:35.399 --> 00:31:37.430

implementing project that I think a lot
 

00:32:05.909 --> 00:32:07.759
implementing project that I think a lot
of times people forget about is when

you know one thing that I always kind of

00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:12.090
you know one thing that I always kind of
 

00:32:12.090 --> 00:32:13.249
you know one thing that I always kind of
laugh about it is when it comes to

00:32:13.249 --> 00:32:13.259
laugh about it is when it comes to
 

00:32:13.259 --> 00:32:14.690
laugh about it is when it comes to
energy fit and see a lot of people are

00:32:14.690 --> 00:32:14.700
energy fit and see a lot of people are
 

00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:18.110
energy fit and see a lot of people are
focused on the P&amp;L statements and I

00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:18.120
focused on the P&amp;L statements and I
 

00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:20.419
focused on the P&amp;L statements and I
always track energy cost energy

00:32:20.419 --> 00:32:20.429
always track energy cost energy
 

00:32:20.429 --> 00:32:23.450
always track energy cost energy
consumption and energy price so as we're

00:32:23.450 --> 00:32:23.460
consumption and energy price so as we're
 

00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:25.310
consumption and energy price so as we're
doing this LED retrofit I'm all over the

00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:25.320
doing this LED retrofit I'm all over the

stores watching their films watching

00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:26.850
stores watching their films watching
 

00:32:26.850 --> 00:32:28.249
stores watching their films watching
their energy line and there was a

00:32:28.249 --> 00:32:28.259
their energy line and there was a
 

00:32:28.259 --> 00:32:30.379
their energy line and there was a
handful of stores that I noticed their

00:32:30.379 --> 00:32:30.389
handful of stores that I noticed their
 

00:32:30.389 --> 00:32:32.720
handful of stores that I noticed their
energy costs went up after this LED

00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:32.730
energy costs went up after this LED
 

00:32:32.730 --> 00:32:35.240
energy costs went up after this LED
project so I start stressing out I go

00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:35.250
project so I start stressing out I go
 

00:32:35.250 --> 00:32:36.560
project so I start stressing out I go
into all the bills and I realize okay

00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:36.570
into all the bills and I realize okay
 

00:32:36.570 --> 00:32:39.230
into all the bills and I realize okay
they actually reduce consumption to line

00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:39.240
they actually reduce consumption to line
 

00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:41.149
they actually reduce consumption to line
items increased to the point it

00:32:41.149 --> 00:32:41.159
items increased to the point it
 

00:32:41.159 --> 00:32:42.830
items increased to the point it
completely negated from a cost

00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:42.840
completely negated from a cost
 

00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:45.470
completely negated from a cost
perspective or LED rollouts and then I

00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:45.480
perspective or LED rollouts and then I
 

00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:47.119
perspective or LED rollouts and then I
actually had to create the story

00:32:47.119 --> 00:32:47.129
actually had to create the story
 

00:32:47.129 --> 00:32:49.700
actually had to create the story
internally and say listen this turned

00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:49.710
internally and say listen this turned
 

00:32:49.710 --> 00:32:53.330
internally and say listen this turned
from a cost savings to a cost avoidance

00:32:53.330 --> 00:32:53.340
from a cost savings to a cost avoidance
 

00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:55.759
from a cost savings to a cost avoidance
and actually show people we absolutely

00:32:55.759 --> 00:32:55.769
and actually show people we absolutely
 

00:32:55.769 --> 00:32:57.919
and actually show people we absolutely
reduced and the project was successful

00:32:57.919 --> 00:32:57.929
reduced and the project was successful
 

00:32:57.929 --> 00:33:00.139
reduced and the project was successful
and this is what would have happened if

00:33:00.139 --> 00:33:00.149
and this is what would have happened if
 

00:33:00.149 --> 00:33:01.310
and this is what would have happened if
we hadn't done it so it's really

00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:01.320
we hadn't done it so it's really
 

00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:02.810
we hadn't done it so it's really
important that you're communicating with

00:33:02.810 --> 00:33:02.820
important that you're communicating with
 

00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:04.970
important that you're communicating with
your vendors communicating internally on

00:33:04.970 --> 00:33:04.980
your vendors communicating internally on
 

00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:06.919
your vendors communicating internally on
the success of a project you also want

00:33:06.919 --> 00:33:06.929
the success of a project you also want
 

00:33:06.929 --> 00:33:08.539
the success of a project you also want
to monitor it to make sure you actually

00:33:08.539 --> 00:33:08.549
to monitor it to make sure you actually
 

00:33:08.549 --> 00:33:10.730
to monitor it to make sure you actually
did receive that savings for a lot of

00:33:10.730 --> 00:33:10.740
did receive that savings for a lot of
 

00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:13.159
did receive that savings for a lot of
projects you can install controls

00:33:13.159 --> 00:33:13.169
projects you can install controls
 

00:33:13.169 --> 00:33:14.629
projects you can install controls
incorrectly and then they're actually

00:33:14.629 --> 00:33:14.639
incorrectly and then they're actually
 

00:33:14.639 --> 00:33:16.279
incorrectly and then they're actually
not functional so you always want to do

00:33:16.279 --> 00:33:16.289
not functional so you always want to do
 

00:33:16.289 --> 00:33:17.930
not functional so you always want to do
that due diligence after you implement a

00:33:17.930 --> 00:33:17.940
that due diligence after you implement a
 

00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:20.419
that due diligence after you implement a
project communicate that success and

00:33:20.419 --> 00:33:20.429
project communicate that success and
 

00:33:20.429 --> 00:33:23.509
project communicate that success and
sure it's working as it should be and

00:33:23.509 --> 00:33:23.519
sure it's working as it should be and
 

00:33:23.519 --> 00:33:25.970
sure it's working as it should be and
that eases kind of when you have your

00:33:25.970 --> 00:33:25.980
that eases kind of when you have your
 

00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:27.440
that eases kind of when you have your
next project because you already have

00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:27.450
next project because you already have
 

00:33:27.450 --> 00:33:28.999
next project because you already have
that internal buy-in which is so

00:33:28.999 --> 00:33:29.009
that internal buy-in which is so
 

00:33:29.009 --> 00:33:32.210
that internal buy-in which is so
critical in to getting more projects

00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:32.220
critical in to getting more projects
 

00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:35.180
critical in to getting more projects

and then obviously lead to the next

have time for one question that's come
 

00:37:12.670 --> 00:37:14.550
have time for one question that's come
in from the audience and I'm just going

00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:14.560
in from the audience and I'm just going
 

00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:15.840
in from the audience and I'm just going
to toss that to the panel at large

00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:15.850
to toss that to the panel at large
 

00:37:15.850 --> 00:37:18.600
to toss that to the panel at large
please any of you jump in on this the

00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:18.610
please any of you jump in on this the
 

00:37:18.610 --> 00:37:21.180
please any of you jump in on this the
question is does making building energy

00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:21.190
question is does making building energy
 

00:37:21.190 --> 00:37:23.640
question is does making building energy
buildings energy efficient lead to a

00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:23.650
buildings energy efficient lead to a
 

00:37:23.650 --> 00:37:25.890
buildings energy efficient lead to a
rise in either the construction or other

00:37:25.890 --> 00:37:25.900
rise in either the construction or other
 

00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:29.310
rise in either the construction or other
operating costs and if they do how do

00:37:29.310 --> 00:37:29.320
operating costs and if they do how do
 

00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:31.950
operating costs and if they do how do
you motivate your administration or

00:37:31.950 --> 00:37:31.960
you motivate your administration or
 

00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:34.110
you motivate your administration or
prospective owners into taking on those

00:37:34.110 --> 00:37:34.120
prospective owners into taking on those
 

00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:38.760
prospective owners into taking on those
higher costs anybody Steven I'll jump on

00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:38.770
higher costs anybody Steven I'll jump on
 

00:37:38.770 --> 00:37:41.520
higher costs anybody Steven I'll jump on
that first I yes

00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:41.530
that first I yes
 

00:37:41.530 --> 00:37:44.760
that first I yes
and particularly on the operational side

00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:44.770
and particularly on the operational side
 

00:37:44.770 --> 00:37:50.490
and particularly on the operational side
I learned that as I mentioned we have a

00:37:50.490 --> 00:37:50.500
I learned that as I mentioned we have a
 

00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:53.010
I learned that as I mentioned we have a
wide range of portfolios that's the

00:37:53.010 --> 00:37:53.020
wide range of portfolios that's the
 

00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:56.430
wide range of portfolios that's the
older buildings as Aurora said you know

00:37:56.430 --> 00:37:56.440
older buildings as Aurora said you know
 

00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:59.040
older buildings as Aurora said you know
they didn't have to take in the same air

00:37:59.040 --> 00:37:59.050
they didn't have to take in the same air
 

00:37:59.050 --> 00:38:02.250
they didn't have to take in the same air
changes that we have to take in now and

00:38:02.250 --> 00:38:02.260
changes that we have to take in now and
 

00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:04.260
changes that we have to take in now and
so when we remodel those we put

00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:04.270
so when we remodel those we put
 

00:38:04.270 --> 00:38:06.780
so when we remodel those we put
high-efficiency systems in but guess

00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:06.790
high-efficiency systems in but guess
 

00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:08.400
high-efficiency systems in but guess
what I'm taking out window air

00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:08.410
what I'm taking out window air
 

00:38:08.410 --> 00:38:12.150
what I'm taking out window air
conditioners and it's or radiator units

00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:12.160
conditioners and it's or radiator units
 

00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:14.760

I'm replacing window air conditioners

00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:14.770
I'm replacing window air conditioners
 

00:38:14.770 --> 00:38:17.100
I'm replacing window air conditioners
I'm adding air conditioner window air

00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:17.110
I'm adding air conditioner window air
 

00:38:17.110 --> 00:38:19.350
I'm adding air conditioner window air
conditioning when there wasn't and so my

00:38:19.350 --> 00:38:19.360
conditioning when there wasn't and so my
 

00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:22.740
conditioning when there wasn't and so my
operating cost go up and I learned I

00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:22.750
operating cost go up and I learned I
 

00:38:22.750 --> 00:38:24.780
operating cost go up and I learned I
learned you got to be very careful on

00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:24.790
learned you got to be very careful on
 

00:38:24.790 --> 00:38:27.570
learned you got to be very careful on
how to questions on how you present that

00:38:27.570 --> 00:38:27.580
how to questions on how you present that
 

00:38:27.580 --> 00:38:30.000
how to questions on how you present that
data and I got wrapped around the axle

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:30.010
data and I got wrapped around the axle
 

00:38:30.010 --> 00:38:31.620
data and I got wrapped around the axle
the first time I tried to explain it

00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:31.630
the first time I tried to explain it
 

00:38:31.630 --> 00:38:35.100
the first time I tried to explain it
just the 5x to the board and so I've

00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:35.110
just the 5x to the board and so I've
 

00:38:35.110 --> 00:38:39.240
just the 5x to the board and so I've
learned my lesson and it's you have to

00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:39.250
learned my lesson and it's you have to
 

00:38:39.250 --> 00:38:41.960
learned my lesson and it's you have to
be careful you have to tell the story on

00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:41.970
be careful you have to tell the story on
 

00:38:41.970 --> 00:38:48.140
be careful you have to tell the story on
how how that energy cost is his better

00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:48.150
how how that energy cost is his better
 

00:38:48.150 --> 00:38:51.720
how how that energy cost is his better
it might be more for that space than it

00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:51.730
it might be more for that space than it
 

00:38:51.730 --> 00:38:54.240
it might be more for that space than it
was but we've bought a benefit so it

00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:54.250
was but we've bought a benefit so it
 

00:38:54.250 --> 00:38:57.480
was but we've bought a benefit so it
becomes a cost avoidance rather than a

00:38:57.480 --> 00:38:57.490
becomes a cost avoidance rather than a
 

00:38:57.490 --> 00:39:02.850
becomes a cost avoidance rather than a
cost savings I think it's yes and no and

00:39:02.850 --> 00:39:02.860
cost savings I think it's yes and no and
 

00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:05.040
cost savings I think it's yes and no and
so you know the example of the LED

00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:05.050
so you know the example of the LED
 

00:39:05.050 --> 00:39:07.170
so you know the example of the LED
lights is a great example right so make

00:39:07.170 --> 00:39:07.180
lights is a great example right so make
 

00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:09.090
lights is a great example right so make
cost more upfront look at the lifecycle

00:39:09.090 --> 00:39:09.100
cost more upfront look at the lifecycle
 

00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:11.370
cost more upfront look at the lifecycle
cost may be significantly more

00:39:11.370 --> 00:39:11.380
cost may be significantly more
 

00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:14.250
cost may be significantly more
especially have to pay you know 80 to 80

00:39:14.250 --> 00:39:14.260
especially have to pay you know 80 to 80
 

00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:16.050
especially have to pay you know 80 to 80
dollars an hour for electrician to come

00:39:16.050 --> 00:39:16.060
dollars an hour for electrician to come
 

00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:18.540
dollars an hour for electrician to come
out and real amp you know every two or

00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:18.550
out and real amp you know every two or
 

00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:21.080
out and real amp you know every two or
three years versus every 15 years right

00:39:21.080 --> 00:39:21.090
three years versus every 15 years right
 

00:39:21.090 --> 00:39:23.760
three years versus every 15 years right
so I think you know what Scott talked

00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:23.770
so I think you know what Scott talked
 

00:39:23.770 --> 00:39:26.010
so I think you know what Scott talked
about what we're working on as well

00:39:26.010 --> 00:39:26.020
about what we're working on as well
 

00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:28.950
about what we're working on as well
changing the design criteria so that we

00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:28.960
changing the design criteria so that we
 

00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:30.990
changing the design criteria so that we
actually are more thoughtful and what we

00:39:30.990 --> 00:39:31.000
actually are more thoughtful and what we
 

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:31.650
actually are more thoughtful and what we
put in there

00:39:31.650 --> 00:39:31.660
put in there
 

00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:33.570
put in there
and then I think more importantly going

00:39:33.570 --> 00:39:33.580
and then I think more importantly going
 

00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:36.480
and then I think more importantly going
from what you talked about the first

00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:36.490
from what you talked about the first
 

00:39:36.490 --> 00:39:39.300
from what you talked about the first
cost of construction to lifecycle costs

00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:39.310
cost of construction to lifecycle costs
 

00:39:39.310 --> 00:39:41.940
cost of construction to lifecycle costs
and so looking at the entire system from

00:39:41.940 --> 00:39:41.950
and so looking at the entire system from
 

00:39:41.950 --> 00:39:44.280
and so looking at the entire system from
you know when you build it when you plan

00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:44.290
you know when you build it when you plan
 

00:39:44.290 --> 00:39:47.230
you know when you build it when you plan
it and build it to disposal

00:39:47.230 --> 00:39:47.240
it and build it to disposal
 

00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:49.690
it and build it to disposal
looking at the life cycle of the people

00:39:49.690 --> 00:39:49.700
looking at the life cycle of the people
 

00:39:49.700 --> 00:39:51.370
looking at the life cycle of the people
and seeing what's the right investment

00:39:51.370 --> 00:39:51.380
and seeing what's the right investment
 

00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:53.770
and seeing what's the right investment
to them to make and doing that in the

00:39:53.770 --> 00:39:53.780
to them to make and doing that in the
 

00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:57.910
to them to make and doing that in the
early stages of planning I think is the

00:39:57.910 --> 00:39:57.920
early stages of planning I think is the
 

00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:00.190
early stages of planning I think is the
direction that we need to head in and so

00:40:00.190 --> 00:40:00.200
direction that we need to head in and so
 

00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:03.430
direction that we need to head in and so
the focus has always been on the first

00:40:03.430 --> 00:40:03.440
the focus has always been on the first
 

00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:05.890
the focus has always been on the first
cost how can I save money on this you

00:40:05.890 --> 00:40:05.900
cost how can I save money on this you
 

00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:07.780
cost how can I save money on this you
know multi-million dollar project well

00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:07.790
know multi-million dollar project well
 

00:40:07.790 --> 00:40:10.840
know multi-million dollar project well
you may be saving $500,000 but you're

00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:10.850
you may be saving $500,000 but you're
 

00:40:10.850 --> 00:40:12.910
you may be saving $500,000 but you're
gonna be paid eight million dollars over

00:40:12.910 --> 00:40:12.920
gonna be paid eight million dollars over
 

00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:14.470
gonna be paid eight million dollars over
sixty years of the life of the building

00:40:14.470 --> 00:40:14.480
sixty years of the life of the building
 

00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:16.720
sixty years of the life of the building
which is probably not the smartest

00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:16.730
which is probably not the smartest
 

00:40:16.730 --> 00:40:19.060
which is probably not the smartest
investment so I think that approach is

00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:19.070
investment so I think that approach is
 

00:40:19.070 --> 00:40:22.570
investment so I think that approach is
different so we answer this question

00:40:22.570 --> 00:40:22.580
different so we answer this question
 

00:40:22.580 --> 00:40:24.100
different so we answer this question
every day

00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:24.110
every day
 

00:40:24.110 --> 00:40:27.430
every day
up-down in sideways and we make the case

00:40:27.430 --> 00:40:27.440
up-down in sideways and we make the case
 

00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:28.840
up-down in sideways and we make the case
for it with all sorts of different

00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:28.850
for it with all sorts of different
 

00:40:28.850 --> 00:40:31.510
for it with all sorts of different
owners and sizes and types and the

00:40:31.510 --> 00:40:31.520
owners and sizes and types and the
 

00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:33.340
owners and sizes and types and the
answer is it doesn't have to but

00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:33.350
answer is it doesn't have to but
 

00:40:33.350 --> 00:40:35.440
answer is it doesn't have to but
sometimes it does and sometimes people

00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:35.450
sometimes it does and sometimes people
 

00:40:35.450 --> 00:40:37.390
sometimes it does and sometimes people
get super excited about everything that

00:40:37.390 --> 00:40:37.400
get super excited about everything that
 

00:40:37.400 --> 00:40:38.980
get super excited about everything that
they're doing and they want to change

00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:38.990
they're doing and they want to change
 

00:40:38.990 --> 00:40:40.840
they're doing and they want to change
the paradigm and that's a really

00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:40.850
the paradigm and that's a really
 

00:40:40.850 --> 00:40:42.160
the paradigm and that's a really
important thing that I think David just

00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:42.170
important thing that I think David just
 

00:40:42.170 --> 00:40:44.410
important thing that I think David just
hit on is you know this question about

00:40:44.410 --> 00:40:44.420
hit on is you know this question about
 

00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:46.090
hit on is you know this question about
buildings consume 40 percent of all the

00:40:46.090 --> 00:40:46.100
buildings consume 40 percent of all the
 

00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:47.530
buildings consume 40 percent of all the
energy that we use in the United States

00:40:47.530 --> 00:40:47.540
energy that we use in the United States
 

00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:49.960
energy that we use in the United States
we've been using that statistic in the

00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:49.970
we've been using that statistic in the
 

00:40:49.970 --> 00:40:53.260
we've been using that statistic in the
green building industry for 25 years and

00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:53.270
green building industry for 25 years and
 

00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:56.080
green building industry for 25 years and
the number hasn't changed that's the

00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:56.090
the number hasn't changed that's the
 

00:40:56.090 --> 00:40:58.780
the number hasn't changed that's the
problem right because we're not shifting

00:40:58.780 --> 00:40:58.790
problem right because we're not shifting
 

00:40:58.790 --> 00:41:00.310
problem right because we're not shifting
we're just like doing these incremental

00:41:00.310 --> 00:41:00.320
we're just like doing these incremental
 

00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:02.740
we're just like doing these incremental
reductions and this is why things like

00:41:02.740 --> 00:41:02.750
reductions and this is why things like
 

00:41:02.750 --> 00:41:05.050
reductions and this is why things like
the Passivhaus movement has really

00:41:05.050 --> 00:41:05.060
the Passivhaus movement has really
 

00:41:05.060 --> 00:41:07.090
the Passivhaus movement has really
resonated with some people because it

00:41:07.090 --> 00:41:07.100
resonated with some people because it
 

00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:08.530
resonated with some people because it
takes an entirely different approach

00:41:08.530 --> 00:41:08.540
takes an entirely different approach
 

00:41:08.540 --> 00:41:10.870
takes an entirely different approach
it's like great take energy use cut it

00:41:10.870 --> 00:41:10.880
it's like great take energy use cut it
 

00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:14.320
it's like great take energy use cut it
down by half at the beginning a minimum

00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:14.330
down by half at the beginning a minimum
 

00:41:14.330 --> 00:41:15.640
down by half at the beginning a minimum
could have got my half maybe all the way

00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:15.650
could have got my half maybe all the way
 

00:41:15.650 --> 00:41:17.890
could have got my half maybe all the way
down to 10% and then have your most

00:41:17.890 --> 00:41:17.900
down to 10% and then have your most
 

00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:19.390
down to 10% and then have your most
efficient building layer on renewables

00:41:19.390 --> 00:41:19.400
efficient building layer on renewables
 

00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:20.830
efficient building layer on renewables
and don't worry about it because you're

00:41:20.830 --> 00:41:20.840
and don't worry about it because you're
 

00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:22.750
and don't worry about it because you're
building an asset and I think that's one

00:41:22.750 --> 00:41:22.760
building an asset and I think that's one
 

00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:24.040
building an asset and I think that's one
of the things that we sometimes forget

00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:24.050
of the things that we sometimes forget
 

00:41:24.050 --> 00:41:25.900
of the things that we sometimes forget
about in the building industry it's not

00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:25.910
about in the building industry it's not
 

00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:27.940
about in the building industry it's not
just about economics we're building

00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:27.950
just about economics we're building
 

00:41:27.950 --> 00:41:30.400
just about economics we're building
somewhere that's gonna be a place it's

00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:30.410
somewhere that's gonna be a place it's
 

00:41:30.410 --> 00:41:31.630
somewhere that's gonna be a place it's
going to contribute to that community

00:41:31.630 --> 00:41:31.640
going to contribute to that community
 

00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:35.770
going to contribute to that community
and our environment for 50 100 200 years

00:41:35.770 --> 00:41:35.780
and our environment for 50 100 200 years
 

00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:37.120
and our environment for 50 100 200 years
and we really need to be treating our

00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:37.130
and we really need to be treating our
 

00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:43.019
and we really need to be treating our
buildings like assets

00:41:43.019 --> 00:41:43.029
 
 

00:41:43.029 --> 00:41:45.430
 
lifecycle assessment also talking about

00:41:45.430 --> 00:41:45.440
lifecycle assessment also talking about
 

00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:48.430
lifecycle assessment also talking about
risk as well so talking about what

00:41:48.430 --> 00:41:48.440
risk as well so talking about what
 

00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:50.799
risk as well so talking about what
happens if energy prices double in ten

00:41:50.799 --> 00:41:50.809
happens if energy prices double in ten
 

00:41:50.809 --> 00:41:52.299
happens if energy prices double in ten
years we're planning on this building

00:41:52.299 --> 00:41:52.309
years we're planning on this building
 

00:41:52.309 --> 00:41:54.519
years we're planning on this building
being here for another twenty years so

00:41:54.519 --> 00:41:54.529
being here for another twenty years so
 

00:41:54.529 --> 00:41:56.739
being here for another twenty years so
you know both in terms of energy costs

00:41:56.739 --> 00:41:56.749
you know both in terms of energy costs
 

00:41:56.749 --> 00:41:58.839
you know both in terms of energy costs
in terms of sustainability in terms of

00:41:58.839 --> 00:41:58.849
in terms of sustainability in terms of
 

00:41:58.849 --> 00:42:01.120
in terms of sustainability in terms of
resilience we also have to be talking

00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:01.130
resilience we also have to be talking
 

00:42:01.130 --> 00:42:03.460
resilience we also have to be talking
about risk especially when it comes to

00:42:03.460 --> 00:42:03.470
about risk especially when it comes to
 

00:42:03.470 --> 00:42:05.440
about risk especially when it comes to
new construction and we're gonna be

00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:05.450
new construction and we're gonna be
 

00:42:05.450 --> 00:42:07.150
new construction and we're gonna be
stuck with that asset for decades to

00:42:07.150 --> 00:42:07.160
stuck with that asset for decades to
 

00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:07.660
stuck with that asset for decades to
come

00:42:07.660 --> 00:42:07.670
come
 

00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:09.849
come
this is really the best opportunity to

00:42:09.849 --> 00:42:09.859
this is really the best opportunity to
 

00:42:09.859 --> 00:42:11.109
this is really the best opportunity to
avoid some of that risk so we're not

00:42:11.109 --> 00:42:11.119
avoid some of that risk so we're not
 

00:42:11.119 --> 00:42:12.729
avoid some of that risk so we're not
implementing projects halfway through

00:42:12.729 --> 00:42:12.739
implementing projects halfway through
 

00:42:12.739 --> 00:42:15.039
implementing projects halfway through
and then this benefit from doing it from

00:42:15.039 --> 00:42:15.049
and then this benefit from doing it from
 

00:42:15.049 --> 00:42:20.319
and then this benefit from doing it from
the beginning well I agree with ya I

00:42:20.319 --> 00:42:20.329
the beginning well I agree with ya I
 

00:42:20.329 --> 00:42:21.370
the beginning well I agree with ya I
agree with everything that's been said I

00:42:21.370 --> 00:42:21.380
agree with everything that's been said I
 

00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:23.370
agree with everything that's been said I
think that the challenge again is also

00:42:23.370 --> 00:42:23.380
think that the challenge again is also
 

00:42:23.380 --> 00:42:25.809
think that the challenge again is also
there certainly as that first cost and

00:42:25.809 --> 00:42:25.819
there certainly as that first cost and
 

00:42:25.819 --> 00:42:27.970
there certainly as that first cost and
it is a challenge but the and the

00:42:27.970 --> 00:42:27.980
it is a challenge but the and the
 

00:42:27.980 --> 00:42:29.650
it is a challenge but the and the
lifecycle cost is something that needs

00:42:29.650 --> 00:42:29.660
lifecycle cost is something that needs
 

00:42:29.660 --> 00:42:31.720
lifecycle cost is something that needs
to be evaluated and that's something

00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:31.730
to be evaluated and that's something
 

00:42:31.730 --> 00:42:33.430
to be evaluated and that's something
that at least in a lot of the markets

00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:33.440
that at least in a lot of the markets
 

00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:35.380
that at least in a lot of the markets
that we deal with changing that paradigm

00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:35.390
that we deal with changing that paradigm
 

00:42:35.390 --> 00:42:37.809
that we deal with changing that paradigm
because so much of our lifecycle costs

00:42:37.809 --> 00:42:37.819
because so much of our lifecycle costs
 

00:42:37.819 --> 00:42:41.710
because so much of our lifecycle costs
are reliant on tenant behaviors and you

00:42:41.710 --> 00:42:41.720
are reliant on tenant behaviors and you
 

00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:43.390
are reliant on tenant behaviors and you
know where this where the savings are

00:42:43.390 --> 00:42:43.400
know where this where the savings are
 

00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:44.920
know where this where the savings are
actually realized and how that affects

00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:44.930
actually realized and how that affects
 

00:42:44.930 --> 00:42:47.019
actually realized and how that affects
kind of the success of the project on

00:42:47.019 --> 00:42:47.029
kind of the success of the project on
 

00:42:47.029 --> 00:42:48.309
kind of the success of the project on
the economic model and it's something

00:42:48.309 --> 00:42:48.319
the economic model and it's something
 

00:42:48.319 --> 00:42:50.079
the economic model and it's something
that we're working to try to get better

00:42:50.079 --> 00:42:50.089
that we're working to try to get better
 

00:42:50.089 --> 00:42:51.370
that we're working to try to get better
at it's a little different than an

00:42:51.370 --> 00:42:51.380
at it's a little different than an
 

00:42:51.380 --> 00:42:53.620
at it's a little different than an
institutional scenario where you know

00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:53.630
institutional scenario where you know
 

00:42:53.630 --> 00:42:55.420
institutional scenario where you know
the same people that own it live there

00:42:55.420 --> 00:42:55.430
the same people that own it live there
 

00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:58.329
the same people that own it live there
and you know can be controlled maybe a

00:42:58.329 --> 00:42:58.339
and you know can be controlled maybe a
 

00:42:58.339 --> 00:42:59.470
and you know can be controlled maybe a
little bit better one of the biggest

00:42:59.470 --> 00:42:59.480
little bit better one of the biggest
 

00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:03.069
little bit better one of the biggest
differentiators for us is the would be

00:43:03.069 --> 00:43:03.079
differentiators for us is the would be
 

00:43:03.079 --> 00:43:04.989
differentiators for us is the would be
in some of the amenities and the the

00:43:04.989 --> 00:43:04.999
in some of the amenities and the the
 

00:43:04.999 --> 00:43:07.059
in some of the amenities and the the
attractiveness of the property so some

00:43:07.059 --> 00:43:07.069
attractiveness of the property so some
 

00:43:07.069 --> 00:43:08.559
attractiveness of the property so some
of the low-hanging fruit whether it's

00:43:08.559 --> 00:43:08.569
of the low-hanging fruit whether it's
 

00:43:08.569 --> 00:43:09.910
of the low-hanging fruit whether it's
you know

00:43:09.910 --> 00:43:09.920
you know
 

00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:12.350
you know
enhanced energy performance that the

00:43:12.350 --> 00:43:12.360
enhanced energy performance that the
 

00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:14.120
enhanced energy performance that the
tenants realize on you know where we can

00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:14.130
tenants realize on you know where we can
 

00:43:14.130 --> 00:43:16.310
tenants realize on you know where we can
do it incrementally evey stations that

00:43:16.310 --> 00:43:16.320
do it incrementally evey stations that
 

00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:17.690
do it incrementally evey stations that
are put in our properties things like

00:43:17.690 --> 00:43:17.700
are put in our properties things like
 

00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:19.550
are put in our properties things like
that that they see and we start to see

00:43:19.550 --> 00:43:19.560
that that they see and we start to see
 

00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:21.530
that that they see and we start to see
the tenants that want it pay maybe a

00:43:21.530 --> 00:43:21.540
the tenants that want it pay maybe a
 

00:43:21.540 --> 00:43:23.120
the tenants that want it pay maybe a
slight premium for it that's where it

00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:23.130
slight premium for it that's where it
 

00:43:23.130 --> 00:43:25.220
slight premium for it that's where it
helps to feed the model back and it's

00:43:25.220 --> 00:43:25.230
helps to feed the model back and it's
 

00:43:25.230 --> 00:43:26.600
helps to feed the model back and it's
easier to take those things on at the

00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:26.610
easier to take those things on at the
 

00:43:26.610 --> 00:43:29.660
easier to take those things on at the
beginning thank you I think we're at the

00:43:29.660 --> 00:43:29.670
beginning thank you I think we're at the
 

00:43:29.670 --> 00:43:31.190
beginning thank you I think we're at the
conclusion of time so I want to thank

00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:31.200
conclusion of time so I want to thank
 

00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:33.140
conclusion of time so I want to thank
