so this is an in a standard inventory

00:00:04.079 --> 00:00:04.089
so this is an in a standard inventory
 

00:00:04.089 --> 00:00:07.129
so this is an in a standard inventory
control problem it's highly simplified

00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:07.139
control problem it's highly simplified
 

00:00:07.139 --> 00:00:10.169
control problem it's highly simplified
but it should give you a flavor of the

00:00:10.169 --> 00:00:10.179
but it should give you a flavor of the
 

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:15.930
but it should give you a flavor of the
kinds of operations research problems

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:15.940
kinds of operations research problems
 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:22.259
kinds of operations research problems
that business that is heavily dependent

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:22.269
that business that is heavily dependent
 

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:26.460
that business that is heavily dependent
on logistics or supply chain management

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:26.470
on logistics or supply chain management
 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.399
on logistics or supply chain management
might be interested in but this is a

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:29.409
might be interested in but this is a
 

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:32.540
might be interested in but this is a
highly simplified version of that okay

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550
highly simplified version of that okay
 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.639
highly simplified version of that okay
so suppose you have a supermarket that

00:00:35.639 --> 00:00:35.649
so suppose you have a supermarket that
 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:39.150
so suppose you have a supermarket that
wants to establish an optimal inventory

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:39.160
wants to establish an optimal inventory
 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.319
wants to establish an optimal inventory
plan for frozen orange juice that

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:43.329
plan for frozen orange juice that
 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:45.509
plan for frozen orange juice that
balances refrigeration and delivery

00:00:45.509 --> 00:00:45.519
balances refrigeration and delivery
 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:48.979
balances refrigeration and delivery
costs so the idea is that if the

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989
costs so the idea is that if the
 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.419
costs so the idea is that if the
supermarket gets deliveries every day

00:00:54.419 --> 00:00:54.429
supermarket gets deliveries every day
 

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:59.549
supermarket gets deliveries every day
based on its expected daily demand then

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559
based on its expected daily demand then
 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:03.329
based on its expected daily demand then
it won't have to store very many cases

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:03.339
it won't have to store very many cases
 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:06.389
it won't have to store very many cases
of orange juice in the refrigerator so

00:01:06.389 --> 00:01:06.399
of orange juice in the refrigerator so
 

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:08.899
of orange juice in the refrigerator so
it's refrigeration costs will be lower

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909
it's refrigeration costs will be lower
 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.700
it's refrigeration costs will be lower
but it'll have to take a delivery every

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710
but it'll have to take a delivery every
 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.270
but it'll have to take a delivery every
day and there are labor costs and

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280
day and there are labor costs and
 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.420
day and there are labor costs and
packaging costs associated with having

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:18.430
packaging costs associated with having
 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.139
packaging costs associated with having
lots of deliveries right so you will

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:22.149
lots of deliveries right so you will
 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:24.950
lots of deliveries right so you will
need to balance refrigeration costs

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960
need to balance refrigeration costs
 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.940
need to balance refrigeration costs
against the costs of deliveries and

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950
against the costs of deliveries and
 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.679
against the costs of deliveries and
packaging so very often you might have

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:34.689
packaging so very often you might have
 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:37.560
packaging so very often you might have
to trade off those too and how might you

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570
to trade off those too and how might you
 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.170
to trade off those too and how might you
pick the optimal replenishment rate

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180
pick the optimal replenishment rate
 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.139
pick the optimal replenishment rate
every day once a week twice a month that

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:46.149
every day once a week twice a month that
 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:49.649
every day once a week twice a month that
sort of thing ok so it's estimated that

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659
sort of thing ok so it's estimated that
 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:51.539
sort of thing ok so it's estimated that
a total of twelve hundred cases will be

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:51.549
a total of twelve hundred cases will be
 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:54.420
a total of twelve hundred cases will be
sold at a steady rate during the next

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430
sold at a steady rate during the next
 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.109
sold at a steady rate during the next
year okay so obviously it is a

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119
year okay so obviously it is a
 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.520
year okay so obviously it is a
simplification to say that it will be a

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530
simplification to say that it will be a
 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.709
simplification to say that it will be a
steady rate there's probably a seasonal

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:01.719
steady rate there's probably a seasonal
 

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:07.859
steady rate there's probably a seasonal
profile to it and you know but you can

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869
profile to it and you know but you can
 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:10.850
profile to it and you know but you can
actually add that complexity onto this

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860
actually add that complexity onto this
 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.809
actually add that complexity onto this
and still preserve this the structure

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819
and still preserve this the structure
 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.190
and still preserve this the structure
this problem okay the manager plans to

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200
this problem okay the manager plans to
 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.170
this problem okay the manager plans to
play several orders of the same size

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180
play several orders of the same size
 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.220
play several orders of the same size
equally spaced throughout the year again

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230
equally spaced throughout the year again
 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.280
equally spaced throughout the year again
a simplification use the following Gator

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290
a simplification use the following Gator
 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.250
a simplification use the following Gator
determine the economic order quantity

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260
determine the economic order quantity
 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.250
determine the economic order quantity
that is the order size that minimizes

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260
that is the order size that minimizes
 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.670
that is the order size that minimizes
the total ordering and carrying costs so

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680
the total ordering and carrying costs so
 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.360
the total ordering and carrying costs so
you're trying to minimize ordering and

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370
you're trying to minimize ordering and
 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.459
you're trying to minimize ordering and
carrying costs the more you order the

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:42.469
carrying costs the more you order the
 

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:44.409
carrying costs the more you order the
greater your ordering cost but the less

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:44.419
greater your ordering cost but the less
 

00:02:44.419 --> 00:02:47.229
greater your ordering cost but the less
you're carrying costs and the less you

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239
you're carrying costs and the less you
 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:50.429
you're carrying costs and the less you
order the more you're carrying costs and

00:02:50.429 --> 00:02:50.439
order the more you're carrying costs and
 

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:55.270
order the more you're carrying costs and
the less you're ordering cost so or it

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280
the less you're ordering cost so or it
 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.759
the less you're ordering cost so or it
cost per delivery is $75 so let's say

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:57.769
cost per delivery is $75 so let's say
 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:01.300
cost per delivery is $75 so let's say
that's the cost of the labor to deal

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310
that's the cost of the labor to deal
 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.809
that's the cost of the labor to deal
with the truck maybe it has built into

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:04.819
with the truck maybe it has built into
 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:07.030
with the truck maybe it has built into
it some levelized cost remember we met

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040
it some levelized cost remember we met
 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.099
it some levelized cost remember we met
the term levelized in the last session

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:09.109
the term levelized in the last session
 

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:17.319
the term levelized in the last session
some levelized cost of packaging and it

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:17.329
some levelized cost of packaging and it
 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:18.969
some levelized cost of packaging and it
lets say it costs eight dollars in

00:03:18.969 --> 00:03:18.979
lets say it costs eight dollars in
 

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:22.030
lets say it costs eight dollars in
electricity to refrigerate one case of

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040
electricity to refrigerate one case of
 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:28.170
electricity to refrigerate one case of
orange juice for one year okay now so

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180
orange juice for one year okay now so
 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.080
orange juice for one year okay now so
one so let's say so what we're trying to

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090
one so let's say so what we're trying to
 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.999
one so let's say so what we're trying to
do is to find the optimal order quantity

00:03:35.999 --> 00:03:36.009
do is to find the optimal order quantity
 

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:39.339
do is to find the optimal order quantity
that is we know that over the course of

00:03:39.339 --> 00:03:39.349
that is we know that over the course of
 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:41.110
that is we know that over the course of
the year we're going to order 1,200

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120
the year we're going to order 1,200
 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.890
the year we're going to order 1,200
cases that's the total demand over the

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900
cases that's the total demand over the
 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.379
cases that's the total demand over the
course of the year we want to know are

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:47.389
course of the year we want to know are
 

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:50.530
course of the year we want to know are
we going to order 1,200 cases one day in

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540
we going to order 1,200 cases one day in
 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:55.990
we going to order 1,200 cases one day in
one year or are we going to order make

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000
one year or are we going to order make
 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.369
one year or are we going to order make
three orders actually probably more like

00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:00.379
three orders actually probably more like
 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:05.289
three orders actually probably more like
five orders per business day and so on

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:05.299
five orders per business day and so on
 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:14.459
five orders per business day and so on
right so let that order quantity be

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:14.469
right so let that order quantity be
 

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:17.529
right so let that order quantity be
called X so that's the total number of

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:17.539
called X so that's the total number of
 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:22.899
called X so that's the total number of
cases that you order per order n is the

00:04:22.899 --> 00:04:22.909
cases that you order per order n is the
 

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:25.779
cases that you order per order n is the
number of orders per year okay so it's

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:25.789
number of orders per year okay so it's
 

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:27.129
number of orders per year okay so it's
got to be the case

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:27.139
got to be the case
 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:32.559
got to be the case
that x times n is equal to 1 1200 right

00:04:32.559 --> 00:04:32.569
that x times n is equal to 1 1200 right
 

00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:39.969
that x times n is equal to 1 1200 right
you want the annual order to be 1200 so

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:39.979
you want the annual order to be 1200 so
 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:42.820
you want the annual order to be 1200 so
one constraint on our solution is going

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830
one constraint on our solution is going
 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.589
one constraint on our solution is going
to be xn is equal to 1200 then I know

00:04:47.589 --> 00:04:47.599
to be xn is equal to 1200 then I know
 

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:50.649
to be xn is equal to 1200 then I know
that the inventory cost is the total of

00:04:50.649 --> 00:04:50.659
that the inventory cost is the total of
 

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:52.619
that the inventory cost is the total of
delivery costs and refrigeration costs

00:04:52.619 --> 00:04:52.629
delivery costs and refrigeration costs
 

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:59.200
delivery costs and refrigeration costs
well that's 75 dollars per order so

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210
well that's 75 dollars per order so
 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:02.709
well that's 75 dollars per order so
there are n orders so that's 75 times n

00:05:02.709 --> 00:05:02.719
there are n orders so that's 75 times n
 

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:18.579
there are n orders so that's 75 times n
plus eight dollars per case of our

00:05:18.579 --> 00:05:18.589
plus eight dollars per case of our
 

00:05:18.589 --> 00:05:23.290
plus eight dollars per case of our
induce in average inventory okay wine

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:23.300
induce in average inventory okay wine
 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.929
induce in average inventory okay wine
average inventory because once again

00:05:25.929 --> 00:05:25.939
average inventory because once again
 

00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:30.909
average inventory because once again
it's the levelized cost concept actually

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:30.919
it's the levelized cost concept actually
 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:32.920
it's the levelized cost concept actually
in this case we've sort of levelized it

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:32.930
in this case we've sort of levelized it
 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:35.920
in this case we've sort of levelized it
by design because I tell you to simplify

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:35.930
by design because I tell you to simplify
 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.110
by design because I tell you to simplify
we're going to order the same amount

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:38.120
we're going to order the same amount
 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:44.679
we're going to order the same amount
each time okay but what's going to

00:05:44.679 --> 00:05:44.689
each time okay but what's going to
 

00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:46.629
each time okay but what's going to
happen let's say suppose that I'm

00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:46.639
happen let's say suppose that I'm
 

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:50.290
happen let's say suppose that I'm
watering 1200 suppose I order a hundred

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:50.300
watering 1200 suppose I order a hundred
 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.679
watering 1200 suppose I order a hundred
units each order and I put our order in

00:05:53.679 --> 00:05:53.689
units each order and I put our order in
 

00:05:53.689 --> 00:05:57.279
units each order and I put our order in
once a month okay so at the beginning of

00:05:57.279 --> 00:05:57.289
once a month okay so at the beginning of
 

00:05:57.289 --> 00:05:59.290
once a month okay so at the beginning of
the month I'll end up with a hundred

00:05:59.290 --> 00:05:59.300
the month I'll end up with a hundred
 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:04.540
the month I'll end up with a hundred
units in stock demand comes through at a

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:04.550
units in stock demand comes through at a
 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:09.969
units in stock demand comes through at a
constant rate so my by the middle of the

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:09.979
constant rate so my by the middle of the
 

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:13.510
constant rate so my by the middle of the
month my hundred units will go down to

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520
month my hundred units will go down to
 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.749
month my hundred units will go down to
50 and by the end of the month my 50

00:06:16.749 --> 00:06:16.759
50 and by the end of the month my 50
 

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:21.149
50 and by the end of the month my 50
units will go down to zero okay and then

00:06:21.149 --> 00:06:21.159
units will go down to zero okay and then
 

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:23.589
units will go down to zero okay and then
the first day of the next month I get a

00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:23.599
the first day of the next month I get a
 

00:06:23.599 --> 00:06:26.730
the first day of the next month I get a
hundred again so let's think about how

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:26.740
hundred again so let's think about how
 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:29.139
hundred again so let's think about how
refrigeration costs would work and that

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:29.149
refrigeration costs would work and that
 

00:06:29.149 --> 00:06:31.050
refrigeration costs would work and that
and this is it's worth actually drawing

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:31.060
and this is it's worth actually drawing
 

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:43.180
and this is it's worth actually drawing
that out over time

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:43.190
 
 

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:46.910
 
okay so let's say this is 12 months this

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:46.920
okay so let's say this is 12 months this
 

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:55.910
okay so let's say this is 12 months this
is time in months and you're going to

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:55.920
is time in months and you're going to
 

00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:00.200
is time in months and you're going to
order this is the order size what do we

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:00.210
order this is the order size what do we
 

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:09.620
order this is the order size what do we
call it eggs right and also so order

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:09.630
call it eggs right and also so order
 

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:12.310
call it eggs right and also so order
side actually so that's not X that's

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:12.320
side actually so that's not X that's
 

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:15.740
side actually so that's not X that's
order size x is here so that's how much

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:15.750
order size x is here so that's how much
 

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:19.210
order size x is here so that's how much
you'd order at the beginning this is

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:19.220
you'd order at the beginning this is
 

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:30.080
you'd order at the beginning this is
inventory level you're going to run run

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:30.090
inventory level you're going to run run
 

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:33.260
inventory level you're going to run run
that down and the next day you're going

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:33.270
that down and the next day you're going
 

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:41.510
that down and the next day you're going
to order another and so on okay and I

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:41.520
to order another and so on okay and I
 

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:45.460
to order another and so on okay and I
should probably put one of those fancy

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:45.470
should probably put one of those fancy
 

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:51.080
should probably put one of those fancy
things they do here right to say we

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:51.090
things they do here right to say we
 

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:56.410
things they do here right to say we
don't know how far away 12 is ok well

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:56.420
don't know how far away 12 is ok well
 

00:07:56.420 --> 00:08:01.390
don't know how far away 12 is ok well
this graph it gives you the profile of

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:01.400
this graph it gives you the profile of
 

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:06.920
this graph it gives you the profile of
inventory over time for any order size x

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:06.930
inventory over time for any order size x
 

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:13.420
inventory over time for any order size x
that you choose right and because I've

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:13.430
that you choose right and because I've
 

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:18.170
that you choose right and because I've
constrained my total orders to my total

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:18.180
constrained my total orders to my total
 

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:21.980
constrained my total orders to my total
order quantity annually to be 1200 if I

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:21.990
order quantity annually to be 1200 if I
 

00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:28.600
order quantity annually to be 1200 if I
choose an ex I also determine an N ok

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:28.610
choose an ex I also determine an N ok
 

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:36.100
choose an ex I also determine an N ok
now so what is the refrigeration cost

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:36.110
now so what is the refrigeration cost
 

00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:43.120
now so what is the refrigeration cost
associated with my choice of X ok well i

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:43.130
associated with my choice of X ok well i
 

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:48.590
associated with my choice of X ok well i
can simply take the midpoint of each of

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:48.600
can simply take the midpoint of each of
 

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:50.030
can simply take the midpoint of each of
these cycles

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:50.040
these cycles
 

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:57.319
these cycles
in other words the average of this value

00:08:57.319 --> 00:08:57.329
in other words the average of this value
 

00:08:57.329 --> 00:09:06.699
in other words the average of this value
and this value and x eight dollars and

00:09:06.699 --> 00:09:06.709
and this value and x eight dollars and
 

00:09:06.709 --> 00:09:10.160
and this value and x eight dollars and
i'll know what my total refrigeration

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:10.170
i'll know what my total refrigeration
 

00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:16.030
i'll know what my total refrigeration
cost will be does everyone see that

00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:16.040
cost will be does everyone see that
 

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:19.850
cost will be does everyone see that
because this unit the o these X units

00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:19.860
because this unit the o these X units
 

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:24.230
because this unit the o these X units
are going to I'm going to pay you know

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:24.240
are going to I'm going to pay you know
 

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:26.569
are going to I'm going to pay you know
I'm going to pay a refrigeration cost on

00:09:26.569 --> 00:09:26.579
I'm going to pay a refrigeration cost on
 

00:09:26.579 --> 00:09:33.530
I'm going to pay a refrigeration cost on
them for in you know for a long time but

00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:33.540
them for in you know for a long time but
 

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:36.499
them for in you know for a long time but
so let's say that every day I lose one

00:09:36.499 --> 00:09:36.509
so let's say that every day I lose one
 

00:09:36.509 --> 00:09:41.240
so let's say that every day I lose one
and let's say X was thirty 30 days in a

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:41.250
and let's say X was thirty 30 days in a
 

00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:44.480
and let's say X was thirty 30 days in a
month then the first unit I'll lose it

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:44.490
month then the first unit I'll lose it
 

00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:46.790
month then the first unit I'll lose it
in one day so I'll only pay

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:46.800
in one day so I'll only pay
 

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:49.069
in one day so I'll only pay
refrigeration costs for one day the

00:09:49.069 --> 00:09:49.079
refrigeration costs for one day the
 

00:09:49.079 --> 00:09:51.079
refrigeration costs for one day the
second unit i'll pay for two days the

00:09:51.079 --> 00:09:51.089
second unit i'll pay for two days the
 

00:09:51.089 --> 00:09:52.910
second unit i'll pay for two days the
third unit i'll pay for three days and

00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:52.920
third unit i'll pay for three days and
 

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:57.410
third unit i'll pay for three days and
so on and it turns out if you if you're

00:09:57.410 --> 00:09:57.420
so on and it turns out if you if you're
 

00:09:57.420 --> 00:09:59.389
so on and it turns out if you if you're
interested in it of course it turns out

00:09:59.389 --> 00:09:59.399
interested in it of course it turns out
 

00:09:59.399 --> 00:10:04.699
interested in it of course it turns out
that the total cost will be the area

00:10:04.699 --> 00:10:04.709
that the total cost will be the area
 

00:10:04.709 --> 00:10:07.970
that the total cost will be the area
under this curve which is going to be

00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:07.980
under this curve which is going to be
 

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:13.340
under this curve which is going to be
half times this base or half times this

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:13.350
half times this base or half times this
 

00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:21.759
half times this base or half times this
height or if you like the average of

00:10:21.759 --> 00:10:21.769
height or if you like the average of
 

00:10:21.769 --> 00:10:24.829
height or if you like the average of
this number and this which is zero so

00:10:24.829 --> 00:10:24.839
this number and this which is zero so
 

00:10:24.839 --> 00:10:30.819
this number and this which is zero so
that's half of x times eight dollars

00:10:30.819 --> 00:10:30.829
that's half of x times eight dollars
 

00:10:30.829 --> 00:10:37.550
that's half of x times eight dollars
okay you

00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:37.560
okay you
 

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:42.769
okay you
X represents the know it represents your

00:10:42.769 --> 00:10:42.779
X represents the know it represents your
 

00:10:42.779 --> 00:10:45.519
X represents the know it represents your
order quantity how much you replenish

00:10:45.519 --> 00:10:45.529
order quantity how much you replenish
 

00:10:45.529 --> 00:10:53.210
order quantity how much you replenish
your store with when you order so right

00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:53.220
your store with when you order so right
 

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:56.420
your store with when you order so right
so let's say you order 101 but you were

00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:56.430
so let's say you order 101 but you were
 

00:10:56.430 --> 00:11:01.400
so let's say you order 101 but you were
okay so if you do that then you say you

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:01.410
okay so if you do that then you say you
 

00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:03.470
okay so if you do that then you say you
wouldn't you'd end up ordering a little

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:03.480
wouldn't you'd end up ordering a little
 

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:06.560
wouldn't you'd end up ordering a little
bit less than 12 times a year right

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:06.570
bit less than 12 times a year right
 

00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:10.160
bit less than 12 times a year right
because your total order has to be 1200

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:10.170
because your total order has to be 1200
 

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:12.829
because your total order has to be 1200
so let's say you order a hundred okay

00:11:12.829 --> 00:11:12.839
so let's say you order a hundred okay
 

00:11:12.839 --> 00:11:17.570
so let's say you order a hundred okay
and you ordered 12 times a year then big

00:11:17.570 --> 00:11:17.580
and you ordered 12 times a year then big
 

00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:19.400
and you ordered 12 times a year then big
you're going to do it once a month lets

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:19.410
you're going to do it once a month lets
 

00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:21.590
you're going to do it once a month lets
it beginning of the month you order a

00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:21.600
it beginning of the month you order a
 

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:25.400
it beginning of the month you order a
hundred your refrigerator has a hundred

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:25.410
hundred your refrigerator has a hundred
 

00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:28.400
hundred your refrigerator has a hundred
units of juice and every day people come

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:28.410
units of juice and every day people come
 

00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:31.190
units of juice and every day people come
through your store and buy juice add a

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:31.200
through your store and buy juice add a
 

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:34.550
through your store and buy juice add a
constant rate so they're they're buying

00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:34.560
constant rate so they're they're buying
 

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:38.120
constant rate so they're they're buying
at the rate of a hundred a month right

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:38.130
at the rate of a hundred a month right
 

00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:40.130
at the rate of a hundred a month right
so they're buying at the rate of a

00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:40.140
so they're buying at the rate of a
 

00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:41.930
so they're buying at the rate of a
hundred a month you bought a hundred at

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:41.940
hundred a month you bought a hundred at
 

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:44.060
hundred a month you bought a hundred at
the beginning of the month by the end of

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:44.070
the beginning of the month by the end of
 

00:11:44.070 --> 00:11:46.850
the beginning of the month by the end of
the month you'll be at zero right so

00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:46.860
the month you'll be at zero right so
 

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:50.329
the month you'll be at zero right so
yeah so your inventory level this is

00:11:50.329 --> 00:11:50.339
yeah so your inventory level this is
 

00:11:50.339 --> 00:11:52.340
yeah so your inventory level this is
your inventory level it starts out at a

00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:52.350
your inventory level it starts out at a
 

00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:54.170
your inventory level it starts out at a
hundred and the course of the month

00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:54.180
hundred and the course of the month
 

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:56.210
hundred and the course of the month
it'll get to zero and the next day

00:11:56.210 --> 00:11:56.220
it'll get to zero and the next day
 

00:11:56.220 --> 00:12:00.470
it'll get to zero and the next day
you'll stock it back up and so on but

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:00.480
you'll stock it back up and so on but
 

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:03.530
you'll stock it back up and so on but
you want to know ok what's the

00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:03.540
you want to know ok what's the
 

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:06.800
you want to know ok what's the
refrigeration cost hmm so it's going to

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:06.810
refrigeration cost hmm so it's going to
 

00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:11.420
refrigeration cost hmm so it's going to
be for those hundred units there's going

00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:11.430
be for those hundred units there's going
 

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:14.570
be for those hundred units there's going
to be some units that were there's you

00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:14.580
to be some units that were there's you
 

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:15.800
to be some units that were there's you
know there's going to be some units that

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:15.810
know there's going to be some units that
 

00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:19.880
know there's going to be some units that
stick around for 30 days some units that

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:19.890
stick around for 30 days some units that
 

00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:22.220
stick around for 30 days some units that
stick around for 29 days some units that

00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:22.230
stick around for 29 days some units that
 

00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:26.600
stick around for 29 days some units that
stick around for 28 and so on if it

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:26.610
stick around for 28 and so on if it
 

00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:30.230
stick around for 28 and so on if it
sticks around for 29 days then how much

00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:30.240
sticks around for 29 days then how much
 

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:33.890
sticks around for 29 days then how much
will be the cost it's going to be eight

00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:33.900
will be the cost it's going to be eight
 

00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:37.910
will be the cost it's going to be eight
dollars divided by 12 because eight

00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:37.920
dollars divided by 12 because eight
 

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:43.699
dollars divided by 12 because eight
dollars eight dollars is the cost to

00:12:43.699 --> 00:12:43.709
dollars eight dollars is the cost to
 

00:12:43.709 --> 00:12:52.480
dollars eight dollars is the cost to
refrigerate one case for one year so

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:52.490
 
 

00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:58.040
 
so you'll have your average inventory is

00:12:58.040 --> 00:12:58.050
so you'll have your average inventory is
 

00:12:58.050 --> 00:13:05.689
so you'll have your average inventory is
50 exactly okay so on average this will

00:13:05.689 --> 00:13:05.699
50 exactly okay so on average this will
 

00:13:05.699 --> 00:13:08.389
50 exactly okay so on average this will
be your inventory and you can just

00:13:08.389 --> 00:13:08.399
be your inventory and you can just
 

00:13:08.399 --> 00:13:12.889
be your inventory and you can just
assume without having to look at this or

00:13:12.889 --> 00:13:12.899
assume without having to look at this or
 

00:13:12.899 --> 00:13:16.489
assume without having to look at this or
or you know abstracting from this you

00:13:16.489 --> 00:13:16.499
or you know abstracting from this you
 

00:13:16.499 --> 00:13:19.189
or you know abstracting from this you
can just assume that your refrigeration

00:13:19.189 --> 00:13:19.199
can just assume that your refrigeration
 

00:13:19.199 --> 00:13:23.049
can just assume that your refrigeration
cost is going to be in that case 50

00:13:23.049 --> 00:13:23.059
cost is going to be in that case 50
 

00:13:23.059 --> 00:13:28.160
cost is going to be in that case 50
times eight but 50s if we chose X equal

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:28.170
times eight but 50s if we chose X equal
 

00:13:28.170 --> 00:13:30.859
times eight but 50s if we chose X equal
to so it's really going to be X divided

00:13:30.859 --> 00:13:30.869
to so it's really going to be X divided
 

00:13:30.869 --> 00:13:38.239
to so it's really going to be X divided
by 2 times 8 every that's for the whole

00:13:38.239 --> 00:13:38.249
by 2 times 8 every that's for the whole
 

00:13:38.249 --> 00:13:42.079
by 2 times 8 every that's for the whole
year yes so this is this is annual

00:13:42.079 --> 00:13:42.089
year yes so this is this is annual
 

00:13:42.089 --> 00:13:48.439
year yes so this is this is annual
inventory cost okay and what is that its

00:13:48.439 --> 00:13:48.449
inventory cost okay and what is that its
 

00:13:48.449 --> 00:13:50.929
inventory cost okay and what is that its
annual delivery cost plus annual

00:13:50.929 --> 00:13:50.939
annual delivery cost plus annual
 

00:13:50.939 --> 00:13:54.199
annual delivery cost plus annual
refrigeration cost well how many orders

00:13:54.199 --> 00:13:54.209
refrigeration cost well how many orders
 

00:13:54.209 --> 00:13:57.590
refrigeration cost well how many orders
do you have in a year n how much does

00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:57.600
do you have in a year n how much does
 

00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:02.030
do you have in a year n how much does
each order cost 75 so that's your annual

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:02.040
each order cost 75 so that's your annual
 

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:06.999
each order cost 75 so that's your annual
delivery costs and that is your annual

00:14:06.999 --> 00:14:07.009
delivery costs and that is your annual
 

00:14:07.009 --> 00:14:11.929
delivery costs and that is your annual
refrigeration cost okay so setting this

00:14:11.929 --> 00:14:11.939
refrigeration cost okay so setting this
 

00:14:11.939 --> 00:14:15.350
refrigeration cost okay so setting this
problem up is actually requires a bit of

00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:15.360
problem up is actually requires a bit of
 

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:17.989

thinking you see that's why I want you

00:14:17.989 --> 00:14:17.999
thinking you see that's why I want you
 

00:14:17.999 --> 00:14:19.910
thinking you see that's why I want you
to understand the intuition behind this

00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:19.920

through to construct those problems will

00:15:28.139 --> 00:15:28.149
through to construct those problems will
 

00:15:28.149 --> 00:15:35.869
through to construct those problems will
help you ok so here is the here's the

00:15:35.869 --> 00:15:35.879
 
 

00:15:35.879 --> 00:15:41.340
 
the expression for annual cost and here

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:41.350
the expression for annual cost and here
 

00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:43.650
the expression for annual cost and here
is a constraint that we know we know the

00:15:43.650 --> 00:15:43.660
is a constraint that we know we know the
 

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:46.199
is a constraint that we know we know the
total demand is equal to 1200 so we know

00:15:46.199 --> 00:15:46.209
total demand is equal to 1200 so we know
 

00:15:46.209 --> 00:15:51.210
total demand is equal to 1200 so we know
that n times x has to equal that okay

00:15:51.210 --> 00:15:51.220
that n times x has to equal that okay
 

00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:57.389
that n times x has to equal that okay
well you can actually you can solve for

00:15:57.389 --> 00:15:57.399
well you can actually you can solve for
 

00:15:57.399 --> 00:16:03.540
well you can actually you can solve for
n or X and substitute in here this is

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:03.550
n or X and substitute in here this is
 

00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:05.990
n or X and substitute in here this is
what we learn to do in the last session

00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:06.000
what we learn to do in the last session
 

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.699
what we learn to do in the last session
ok so here I've solved for n and

00:16:10.699 --> 00:16:10.709
ok so here I've solved for n and
 

00:16:10.709 --> 00:16:15.179
ok so here I've solved for n and
substituted for n in this equation so

00:16:15.179 --> 00:16:15.189
substituted for n in this equation so
 

00:16:15.189 --> 00:16:22.829
substituted for n in this equation so
instead of 75 n I have 75 x 1200 / x so

00:16:22.829 --> 00:16:22.839
instead of 75 n I have 75 x 1200 / x so
 

00:16:22.839 --> 00:16:30.410
instead of 75 n I have 75 x 1200 / x so
that's 90,000 over X plus 4x that's

00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:30.420
that's 90,000 over X plus 4x that's
 

00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:35.429
that's 90,000 over X plus 4x that's
total annual cost as a function of X X

00:16:35.429 --> 00:16:35.439
total annual cost as a function of X X
 

00:16:35.439 --> 00:16:38.879
total annual cost as a function of X X
is a number that I get to choose and i'm

00:16:38.879 --> 00:16:38.889
is a number that I get to choose and i'm
 

00:16:38.889 --> 00:16:41.999
is a number that I get to choose and i'm
going to choose it now in the most

00:16:41.999 --> 00:16:42.009
going to choose it now in the most
 

00:16:42.009 --> 00:16:47.220
going to choose it now in the most
optimal way possible okay in i'm going

00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:47.230
optimal way possible okay in i'm going
 

00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:50.939
optimal way possible okay in i'm going
to choose the X that minimizes total

00:16:50.939 --> 00:16:50.949
to choose the X that minimizes total
 

00:16:50.949 --> 00:16:54.869
to choose the X that minimizes total
cost and I built into this expression

00:16:54.869 --> 00:16:54.879
cost and I built into this expression
 

00:16:54.879 --> 00:16:57.059
cost and I built into this expression
both the cost that comes from

00:16:57.059 --> 00:16:57.069
both the cost that comes from
 

00:16:57.069 --> 00:17:03.269
both the cost that comes from
refrigeration and delivery okay well now

00:17:03.269 --> 00:17:03.279
refrigeration and delivery okay well now
 

00:17:03.279 --> 00:17:05.909
refrigeration and delivery okay well now
you know that ok I have to minimize this

00:17:05.909 --> 00:17:05.919
you know that ok I have to minimize this
 

00:17:05.919 --> 00:17:07.770
you know that ok I have to minimize this
function now you know what to do you can

00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:07.780
function now you know what to do you can
 

00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:14.500
function now you know what to do you can
apply the cookbook recipe which is what

Alan do you want to tell us okay take

00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:24.680
Alan do you want to tell us okay take
 

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:27.550
Alan do you want to tell us okay take
the derivative of this set it equal to

00:17:27.550 --> 00:17:27.560
the derivative of this set it equal to
 

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:30.280
the derivative of this set it equal to
zero and find the values of x for which

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:30.290
zero and find the values of x for which
 

00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:33.160
zero and find the values of x for which
that's true right so we take the

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:33.170
that's true right so we take the
 

00:17:33.170 --> 00:17:36.670
that's true right so we take the
derivative here just apply the power

00:17:36.670 --> 00:17:36.680
derivative here just apply the power
 

00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:38.500

rule this is really ninety thousand

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:38.510
rule this is really ninety thousand
 

00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:42.190
rule this is really ninety thousand
times X to the minus two sorry times X

00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:42.200
times X to the minus two sorry times X
 

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:48.550
times X to the minus two sorry times X
to the minus one so when I take the

00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:48.560
to the minus one so when I take the
 

00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:50.770
to the minus one so when I take the
derivative it becomes minus ninety

00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:50.780
derivative it becomes minus ninety
 

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:53.670
derivative it becomes minus ninety
thousand X to the minus two plus four

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:53.680
thousand X to the minus two plus four
 

00:17:53.680 --> 00:18:00.490
thousand X to the minus two plus four
set that equal to zero and solve for x

00:24:12.159 --> 00:24:14.820
have embedded in them building blocks
that have trade-offs that look just like

00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:14.830
that have trade-offs that look just like
 

00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:16.440
that have trade-offs that look just like
this there may be lots of different

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:16.450
this there may be lots of different
 

00:24:16.450 --> 00:24:19.019
this there may be lots of different
trade-offs but nevertheless the

00:24:19.019 --> 00:24:19.029
trade-offs but nevertheless the
 

00:24:19.029 --> 00:24:21.960
trade-offs but nevertheless the
trade-offs broken down will be simple

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:21.970
trade-offs broken down will be simple
 

00:24:21.970 --> 00:24:33.419
trade-offs broken down will be simple
enough yeah but you would you yes but

00:24:33.419 --> 00:24:33.429
enough yeah but you would you yes but
 

00:24:33.429 --> 00:24:35.340
enough yeah but you would you yes but
but there are other complications for

00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:35.350
but there are other complications for
 

00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:40.830
but there are other complications for
example there you have some variables

00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:40.840
example there you have some variables
 

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:43.169
example there you have some variables
are not worth incorporating into your

00:24:43.169 --> 00:24:43.179
are not worth incorporating into your
 

00:24:43.179 --> 00:24:45.119
are not worth incorporating into your
analysis because even if you

00:24:45.119 --> 00:24:45.129
analysis because even if you
 

00:24:45.129 --> 00:24:47.509
analysis because even if you
incorporated them the impact on your

00:24:47.509 --> 00:24:47.519
incorporated them the impact on your
 

00:24:47.519 --> 00:24:50.690
incorporated them the impact on your
optimal choice might be small for

00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:50.700
optimal choice might be small for
 

00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:58.279
optimal choice might be small for
example it's generally the case that

00:24:58.279 --> 00:24:58.289
 
 

00:24:58.289 --> 00:25:03.389
 
energy costs have have been negligible

energy costs have have been negligible
 

00:25:03.399 --> 00:25:07.190
energy costs have have been negligible
in many American planning decisions

00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:07.200
in many American planning decisions
 

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:10.860
in many American planning decisions
because of the structure of energy costs

00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:10.870
because of the structure of energy costs
 

00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:12.570
because of the structure of energy costs
in the US relative to everything else

00:25:12.570 --> 00:25:12.580
in the US relative to everything else
 

00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:16.860
in the US relative to everything else
but the nature of relative prices in

00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:16.870
but the nature of relative prices in
 

00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:18.480
but the nature of relative prices in
other countries where there are heavy

other countries where there are heavy
 

00:25:18.490 --> 00:25:21.509
other countries where there are heavy
energy taxes means that their entire

00:25:21.509 --> 00:25:21.519
energy taxes means that their entire
 

00:25:21.519 --> 00:25:24.570
energy taxes means that their entire
landscape looks different simply because

00:25:24.570 --> 00:25:24.580
landscape looks different simply because
 

00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:27.360
landscape looks different simply because
of energy costs you know suburbs for

00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:27.370
of energy costs you know suburbs for
 

00:25:27.370 --> 00:25:31.980
of energy costs you know suburbs for
example don't make any sense when if you

00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:31.990
example don't make any sense when if you
 

00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:36.099
example don't make any sense when if you
have gasoline at

00:25:36.099 --> 00:25:36.109
have gasoline at
 

00:25:36.109 --> 00:25:38.839

you know six or seven dollars a gallon

00:25:38.839 --> 00:25:38.849
you know six or seven dollars a gallon
 

00:25:38.849 --> 00:25:42.399
you know six or seven dollars a gallon
which is sort of us close to a price in

00:25:42.399 --> 00:25:42.409
which is sort of us close to a price in
 

00:25:42.409 --> 00:25:50.690

encourage you to try at least some of

00:26:04.129 --> 00:26:04.139
encourage you to try at least some of
 

00:26:04.139 --> 00:26:06.859
encourage you to try at least some of
them out if you have problems come and

time we will talk about multivariate

00:26:16.339 --> 00:26:16.349
time we will talk about multivariate
 

00:26:16.349 --> 00:26:19.070
time we will talk about multivariate
functions and will lop off a little from

00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:19.080
functions and will lop off a little from
 

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:26.290
functions and will lop off a little from
integration yet
