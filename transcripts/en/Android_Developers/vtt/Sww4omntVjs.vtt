ROMAN NURIK: Hello, and
welcome to another episode

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.390
of Android Design in Action.

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:13.180
I'm your host, Roman Nurik.

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:14.810
NICK BUTCHER: And
hi, I'm Nick Butcher.

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:16.310
ROMAN NURIK: And
in today's episode,

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:20.930
we're going to talk about 10
more navigation anti-patterns.

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.410
And when we say 10 more, we
say that because we actually

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.270
recorded a previous
episode of the show, where

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.200
we went into 10 of the
most common UX issues--

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.189
user experience
issues-- that we saw.

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.080
And some of those
issues were specifically

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.560
related to navigation.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.300
So in this episode,
we'll talk about 10

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.770
more navigation anti-patterns
that we've since thought about,

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.709
I guess, since that episode.

00:00:46.709 --> 00:00:48.500
Nick, do you want to
talk a little bit more

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.822
about the background here?

00:00:49.822 --> 00:00:51.572
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah,
sorry yeah, of course.

00:00:51.572 --> 00:00:54.490
And if you didn't catch
the previous episode,

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:56.354
we went into the
background that part of job

00:00:56.354 --> 00:00:57.770
is to work with a
bunch of clients

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.900
and look at all kinds of
applications out there.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.920
And we come across all kinds
of issues and variations

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.632
on a pattern, some of which
work, some of which don't.

00:01:09.632 --> 00:01:11.007
One of the things
we often see is

00:01:11.007 --> 00:01:13.643
when people that are new to
Android design, they quickly

00:01:13.643 --> 00:01:15.772
pick up things like the
visual language of Android,

00:01:15.772 --> 00:01:17.230
but they sometimes
don't completely

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:18.800
internalize the
navigation patterns

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.245
and completely grasp
the nuances and some

00:01:23.245 --> 00:01:27.480
of the consequences of
deviating from these patterns.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.090
So we wanted to give you the
benefit of all this experience

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.146
and highlight some of the
pitfalls we've come across,

00:01:34.146 --> 00:01:35.520
and what you should
watch out for

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.440
and what you can do instead.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.315
ROMAN NURIK: Exactly.

00:01:38.315 --> 00:01:38.814
All right.

00:01:38.814 --> 00:01:41.920
Without further ado,
let's get started.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.654
OK, so 10 more
navigation anti-patterns.

00:01:45.654 --> 00:01:47.320
The first that we're
going to talk about

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.750
is navigation in the
action bar overflow.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.890
So this is getting to
be less and less common,

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.160
which is great.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.896
But the idea here
is some of the apps

00:01:56.896 --> 00:02:00.080
that we've seen have put
their primary navigation-- so

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.480
for example, Home,
Store, My Items,

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.470
the different categories,
Browse, things

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.090
like that-- basically
the core way to navigate

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.350
your app-- they've put this
onto the Action Bar overflow.

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.630
And this is really the wrong
place to put your navigation.

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.270
There are a number
of reasons for this.

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.900
The major reason is that
now most apps don't do this.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.220
Most apps follow the guidelines
and use more standard UI

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.030
patterns for exposing
their top level navigation.

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.600
We'll obviously
talk about those,

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.540
things like the Navigation
Drawer, things like tabs.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.250
But really, this is the
wrong place to put it.

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.890
Another reason is actually
on older devices that

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.360
don't have the
Action Bar overflow,

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.440
it would be hidden
under the Menu button.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.450
And there are lots of
issues with the Menu

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:49.980
button-- the
hardware menu button.

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.479
We won't get into
all of them today.

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:56.120
But this is definitely one of
the navigation anti-patterns

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.310
that we thought it
was pretty common.

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.400
But luckily it's getting
less and less common.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.870
NICK BUTCHER:
Yeah, generally, it

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.520
goes against the organization
of having navigation

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.830
on the left and
actions on the right

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.520
that all the other
apps on the platform

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.811
are training users to look for.

00:03:10.811 --> 00:03:15.121
So users not finding certain
sections in your apps,

00:03:15.121 --> 00:03:16.537
if you find this
pattern, it could

00:03:16.537 --> 00:03:20.937
be that they're just
looking for it elsewhere.

00:03:20.937 --> 00:03:23.020
ROMAN NURIK: So the second
navigation anti-pattern

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.610
that we want to
talk about today is

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.080
using UI patterns
in the wrong order,

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.020
or having the wrong
navigational hierarchy.

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.880
So we have a couple
of major UI patterns

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:40.130
for exposing navigation, things
like the Navigation Drawer

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:44.700
the Action Bar Spinner and
tabs-- action bar tabs,

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.650
or just regular tabs.

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.350
So there's actually a pretty
strict ordering with how you

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.640
should use these-- in which
order you should use them .

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.030
And we basically, when you
look at your app in terms

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.230
of its informational
hierarchy, you'll

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.310
generally create something
like a tree, right?

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.540
So at the top, you'll have
Home, at the second level,

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.720
you'll have your major sections,
and within each section,

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.350
you may have subsections
and subsections and so on.

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.620
So one of the things that we've
actually seen a handful of apps

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.780
do is use these different
UI patterns to represent

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.779
different levels of that
information hierarchy.

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:20.519
Now, the wrong
thing to do would be

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:25.520
to use, say, tabs to represent
the top level, and then

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.170
the Action Bar
Spinner to represent,

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:29.700
say, the next level,
and then, for example,

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.240
the Navigation
Drawer to represent

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.350
the third, or deepest, level.

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.170
So this is actually just
the wrong way to do it.

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:39.490
On Android, these three
UI patterns actually

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:44.300
follow pretty rigid level--
or a pretty rigid hierarchy.

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.191
So instead of doing
something like this,

00:04:47.191 --> 00:04:48.690
the correct hierarchy
would actually

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.600
be to always have the
Navigation Drawer represent

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.790
the top-most level of your
application hierarchy,

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:58.820
and then, if you have an
Action Bar Spinner, that

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.589
should be the second level,
and finally, if you have tabs,

00:05:01.589 --> 00:05:02.880
they should be the third level.

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.755
Now, if you don't have
a Spinner, if you just

00:05:04.755 --> 00:05:09.150
have a Navigation Drawer and
tabs, such as with Google Play

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.520
Music-- then it would
just be the Navigation D

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.207
Drawer and then tabs.

00:05:13.207 --> 00:05:14.790
But really, your
tabs and your Spinner

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:16.480
should never precede the Drawer.

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:20.270
The Drawer always should
represent the top-most level

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:22.016
of the application hierarchy.

00:05:22.016 --> 00:05:24.600
NICK BUTCHER: So this is a
somewhat contrived example,

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.350
that we have three different
levels of hierarchy--

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:29.190
of navigation hierarchy
in this application.

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:31.370
You probably would generally
want to avoid that.

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:32.990
And perhaps you
might do something

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:34.630
like having two
levels of hierarchy

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:36.925
in your Drawer via a
classical section, which

00:05:36.925 --> 00:05:39.245
we'll cover in a section.

00:05:39.245 --> 00:05:41.370
But, if you do have that
kind of complex hierarchy,

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:42.420
then do respect this.

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:45.950
You generally want to go
for a top-downward scan.

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:48.760
So the highest level
is a natural mapping

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.120
to the root of your navigation.

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.190
And one wrinkle,
is, you'll see here,

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:58.365
that the Drawer is obviously
underneath the Action Bar

00:05:58.365 --> 00:06:00.580
The difference being that
when you open the Drawer,

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:02.330
Action Bar's expected
to transform.

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:06.900
So in this instance, you would
get only app-wide options.

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.860
So in this case,
Spinner would disappear.

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:11.040
You'd probably just have
the application name itself

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:14.495
and any actions not relevant
to the entire application

00:06:14.495 --> 00:06:16.760
should disappear from that.

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.510
So generally follow
that top-down approach

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:19.219
and you'll be OK.

00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:21.135
ROMAN NURIK: And another
thing with the Drawer

00:06:21.135 --> 00:06:23.230
is that we did have another
episode specifically

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:25.940
about using the
Navigation Drawer.

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:28.520
And we had, I believe,
Rich Fulcher and Jens Nagel

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.100
from the Android
Design team, that

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:33.050
talked a little bit about how
to use the Drawer and in which

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:35.420
cases it's most useful.

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:37.590
So definitely take a
look at that episode

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:40.950
if you have more questions
about using the Drawer.

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:43.552
OK, with that, let's move on.

00:06:43.552 --> 00:06:44.593
NICK BUTCHER: Absolutely.

00:06:44.593 --> 00:06:46.965
So the next pattern
that we wanted to cover

00:06:46.965 --> 00:06:49.110
is talking about tabs.

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:53.850
So tabs in Android have
a very strong mental link

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:55.290
to horizontal swipe.

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:58.210
So whenever you see
tabs, you absolutely

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:00.460
expect to be able
to horizontally

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:02.736
swipe between content.

00:07:02.736 --> 00:07:04.930
So for that reason,
if you do have

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:07.475
some kind of
paginated content, you

00:07:07.475 --> 00:07:10.180
do want to be careful
about putting that

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:12.400
within tabs, of
because you're going

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.659
to have some swipe ambiguity.

00:07:14.659 --> 00:07:16.700
When you see tabs, you
expect to be able to swipe

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:19.759
to change between them, not
to move the content within it.

00:07:19.759 --> 00:07:21.300
ROMAN NURIK: So one
thing to add here

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:24.050
is that if it's a part
of the tab-- it's maybe

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:25.610
a small section
that's swipe-able--

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:28.340
let's say you have a
horizontally scrolling

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:30.040
photo gallery or
something like that.

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:33.410
If it's a part of the tab,
then it's generally OK.

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:38.660
There are cases where
it's possible to do this.

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:42.390
The issue here is that
the entire tab contents

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:44.940
are another left and
right swipe region.

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:47.440
And so it creates this
ambiguity between,

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:51.530
am I swiping between tabs or
am I swiping between pages?

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:54.510
In cases like if you have a map,
where it's not really swiping

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:59.680
between pages you're, panning
a surface, it's also OK.

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:02.120
But it's, again, something
that you may want to rethink,

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:04.150
because there will
be that ambiguity.

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:09.750
But in this case, this is just
one of those textbook cases

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:16.280
of ambiguity really messing with
the standard Android pattern--

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:20.160
or standard Android interaction
of tabs being directly linked

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.780
with their contents.

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:24.780
So instead of doing
this, another way

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:27.840
to solve this issue
is to, instead of

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:32.240
doing horizontal paging, you
can do a vertical scrolling type

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:34.280
thing for the tab contents.

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:38.010
So basically, anytime you have
nested horizontal swiping,

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:40.980
really try to think, is there
a better way to present this?

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:44.440
Maybe it's breaking out the
content into a separate screen.

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:47.410
Maybe it's using a different
interaction-- vertical

00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:49.240
scrolling versus
horizontal paging.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:51.747
But really think about
that, because that

00:08:51.747 --> 00:08:53.580
is something that can
create that ambiguity.

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:58.620
So the next anti-pattern
we're going to talk about

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:01.760
is deep or persistent tabs.

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:04.300
These often go hand in hand.

00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:06.460
So first, let me
talk about deep tabs.

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:11.380
When we say deep tabs, we
compare deep versus shallow

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:12.940
tabs .

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:15.045
On Android, tabs
should be shallow.

00:09:15.045 --> 00:09:16.670
What that means is
that there shouldn't

00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:19.340
be too much navigation
within tabs.

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:22.920
Maybe you have a view switch,
like you change the sort order

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:26.110
something, or
something like that.

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:28.327
Or maybe you have
scrolling, and whatever.

00:09:28.327 --> 00:09:29.910
But you really
shouldn't have any sort

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:33.540
of hierarchy or
history within the tab.

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:35.157
What that means is,
in this example,

00:09:35.157 --> 00:09:37.240
let's say you're looking
at the contents of a tab,

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:41.080
and you select one
of these grid items.

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:43.610
You should take the
user to a new screen.

00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:45.430
You shouldn't actually
take the user--

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:48.880
or update the contents of
the tab with the whatever

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:49.934
you just clicked on.

00:09:49.934 --> 00:09:52.100
And then when you press
back, it would go back here.

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:53.100
This is not something
you want to do.

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:54.558
This is actually
something we would

00:09:54.558 --> 00:09:57.770
call a deep tab, a tab that
has hierarchy or history.

00:09:57.770 --> 00:10:00.790
And so the reason for this
is that, first of all,

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:02.649
this is just a platform norm.

00:10:02.649 --> 00:10:04.940
This is not something that's
generally done on Android.

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:06.400
But the second
thing is that, what

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:08.550
happens when you
swipe to other tabs

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:11.150
or switch between
different tabs?

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:15.850
You actually leave your tabs
in all sorts of weird states.

00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:19.240
And the behavior of what
happens when you get back to tab

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:20.920
isn't really well defined.

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:23.720
Should you reset the tab
back to its top level?

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:25.840
Should you stay where it is?

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:29.754
You really don't want to
have too much state going on.

00:10:29.754 --> 00:10:31.670
And really this is
actually a recurring theme.

00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:34.990
When your app has too much
state that the user has

00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:38.180
to keep in mind,
or too much state

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:39.910
that it's maybe
unexpected to the user,

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:42.020
that's going to
result in confusion.

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:43.680
So these are things
you want to avoid.

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:45.400
And so for that
reason we, generally

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:48.670
consider tabs as
shallow on Android.

00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:51.810
Another similar point
here is persistent tabs.

00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:54.760
So persistent tabs
are basically tabs

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:57.750
that behave like global
navigation that are always

00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:00.040
there throughout your app.

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:02.450
And so the problem
with this-- and they

00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:04.272
can either be in the
top or the bottom.

00:11:04.272 --> 00:11:06.480
When they're on the bottom
that's even worse because,

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:08.600
again, tabs on Android
should be at the top.

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.855
But persistent tabs,
regardless of where they are,

00:11:10.855 --> 00:11:14.090
are problematic, because
that's not really

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:16.840
how global navigation
should work on Android.

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:19.460
Especially with things
like the Back button.

00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:21.610
What happens when you
switch between tabs

00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:25.200
and then do stuff within tabs?

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:28.900
The Back button behavior is
no longer really well defined.

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:32.190
And so it's not really a
platform norm, as well as

00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:35.580
there's a lot of confusion
that will result from it

00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:40.170
to have tabs that are
persistent across the app.

00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:42.130
And for that reason,
one of the reasons

00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:44.190
that we created the
Navigation Drawer was

00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:49.240
to allow apps to create these
kind of global context switch

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:53.030
type UI patterns, or
UI's, where to switch

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:55.900
between some deep
part of one section

00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:57.734
to a whole other
section of the app,

00:11:57.734 --> 00:11:59.150
you can use the
Navigation Drawer,

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:00.980
which is available
through an edge swipe.

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:04.790
So really, to summarize this
very long-winded argument,

00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:07.400
avoid persistent tabs
that are there throughout,

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:12.190
and avoid deep tabs, basically
tabs that have hierarchy.

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:14.230
Anything to add, Nick,
before we move on?

00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:16.530
NICK BUTCHER: You
covered that pretty well.

00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:18.060
ROMAN NURIK: OK,
well let's do it.

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:21.370
I'm going to talk about--
actually, real quick--

00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:23.120
NICK BUTCHER: This is
what you need to do.

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:24.020
ROMAN NURIK: Yes, yes,
yes, that's right.

00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:26.600
We had some examples of
ways to mitigate this.

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:29.700
So in this previous
example, you had your tabs

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:31.930
show the contents of the
thing you just clicked on.

00:12:31.930 --> 00:12:34.540
In this next example,
instead of showing the tabs,

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:36.680
you basically take the
user to a whole new screen

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:40.410
with a whole new Action Bar
and an Up caret or an Up button

00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:43.160
And then to get back to
where the user just was,

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:45.292
they would just
press the Up button.

00:12:45.292 --> 00:12:47.500
And then, of course, if you
have a Navigation Drawer,

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:50.690
you can always expose it
here through an edge swipe.

00:12:50.690 --> 00:12:53.370
So that's a deep
and persistent tabs.

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:56.910
Nick, do you want to talk about
back traversing across tabs?

00:12:56.910 --> 00:12:58.500
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, absolutely.

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:01.530
So as Roman was saying about
having these shallow tabs,

00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:04.590
we have consider
moving between tabs

00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:06.770
to be a very lightweight action.

00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:09.750
It's not something that's
going to actually drop history,

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:14.010
as it were, drop something
into your navigation history.

00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:18.130
So therefore the Back button
should not unwind your moving

00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:19.710
between tabs like this.

00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:22.800
So in this example here,
if you're on the third tab

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:27.310
and you were to tap
or swipe between them,

00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:29.885
tapping shouldn't unwind you.

00:13:29.885 --> 00:13:32.850
In fact, if you embrace the fact
of having to swipe between it,

00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:35.920
it would feel pretty unnatural
for a tap of a Back button

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:37.940
to unwind a swipe button.

00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:40.270
So that's one of the reasons
why we say not to do that.

00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:41.370
ROMAN NURIK: Exactly.

00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:46.210
And a similar area where the
Back button shouldn't do, maybe

00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:50.620
what you think it
should do, is when

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:53.600
you're changing between
different Drawer sections.

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:56.580
So for the Drawer, you may think
if I switch from section one

00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:58.520
to section three
to section four,

00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:00.420
pressing Back should
switch between those.

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:02.420
But actually the
platform standard here,

00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:05.780
again, for the Back
button, is basically,

00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:08.060
when you switch between
sections in the Drawer,

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:10.290
you should actually
reset your task stack.

00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:12.895
It's almost like you've
entered in a different app.

00:14:12.895 --> 00:14:15.270
And that's really what the
navigation Drawer is good for.

00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:18.560
If you look at an example,
like Google+, for example,

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:21.410
the Google+ app, when you switch
between different sections,

00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:23.802
you're almost entering
different apps.

00:14:23.802 --> 00:14:25.260
And the navigation
Drawer is really

00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:28.130
good at these
types of scenarios.

00:14:28.130 --> 00:14:31.160
But the guidance here is when
you switch between sections

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:35.970
in the Drawer, pressing
back should probably either

00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:38.720
kick you out of the
app, or, if your users

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:40.910
are getting confused by why
is this leaving the app,

00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:43.010
it should maybe take you
to the top-most section.

00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:44.130
So for example, Home.

00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:47.770
So if I go between
Home and Browse

00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:52.310
and Search and Store
and Categories,

00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:55.460
pressing back from Categories
should really only take me

00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:58.720
back Home and then to
the Home screen, or just

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:01.117
the Home screen.

00:15:01.117 --> 00:15:02.825
Anything to add, Nick,
before we move on?

00:15:02.825 --> 00:15:03.504
NICK BUTCHER: No,
I was just going

00:15:03.504 --> 00:15:05.087
to say that's a
really powerful point,

00:15:05.087 --> 00:15:07.774
I think, is that if you do
have one natural Home one place

00:15:07.774 --> 00:15:10.065
where you should always expect
users to want to come in

00:15:10.065 --> 00:15:13.490
on and probably get
back to very easily,

00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:16.925
it's OK to have one
level of Back inserted.

00:15:16.925 --> 00:15:20.673
It's that fresh task stack to
take them back through that.

00:15:20.673 --> 00:15:22.839
So they have that stability
of really easily getting

00:15:22.839 --> 00:15:27.200
back to that natural Home
position from a sub section.

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:29.970
But otherwise treat
changing sections similar

00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:31.266
this to changing tabs.

00:15:31.266 --> 00:15:33.562
It's not going to
have a history in it.

00:15:33.562 --> 00:15:34.520
ROMAN NURIK: All right.

00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:36.350
Let's move on.

00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:37.350
Deep Navigation Drawers.

00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:38.850
Do you want to cover
this one, Nick?

00:15:38.850 --> 00:15:42.415
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, the next
one is one of my pet hates.

00:15:42.415 --> 00:15:45.850
It's probably a smell, really.

00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:47.835
If you're having to
do this pattern here,

00:15:47.835 --> 00:15:50.510
of having deep navigation
structures in your Droid,

00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:52.520
it probably means
your navigation

00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:54.890
needs to be simplified
somewhat and maybe perhaps

00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:58.490
broken up into
different sections

00:15:58.490 --> 00:16:00.450
or different applications
perhaps, or something

00:16:00.450 --> 00:16:01.350
like this.

00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:02.980
But the idea of a
Navigation Drawer

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:05.502
is it's a stable list of
navigation targets, which

00:16:05.502 --> 00:16:09.020
you can always get to
and jump to and stuff.

00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:11.980
And you don't want to put any
cognitive load on the user

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:14.380
to actually remember
where they were

00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:16.070
or where they've come through.

00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:18.066
And it wants to be a
stable thing that when

00:16:18.066 --> 00:16:20.390
I open the Drawer, and I
can have my Home option

00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:22.670
or have whatever
option to navigate to.

00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:26.030
So you want to avoid
having different steps,

00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:29.070
or even seeing secondary
Drawers popping out

00:16:29.070 --> 00:16:32.110
from the first Drawer,
which is also pretty crazy.

00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:36.820
So do try and avoid this.

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:39.320
An alternative way
of actually having

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:41.515
some kind of subsection
behavior-- and I think

00:16:41.515 --> 00:16:43.565
we hinted at this
earlier on-- it

00:16:43.565 --> 00:16:46.580
is OK to have these
expandable items.

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:48.120
And the reason
this is kind of OK

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:49.710
is because it's not this
huge content switch.

00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:52.168
You're not completely replacing
the contents of the Drawer,

00:16:52.168 --> 00:16:54.240
but it's sort of new
and enforcing the users

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:57.265
to keep up with where they
are in their [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:57.265 --> 00:16:59.316
But it's just an
in-place expand which

00:16:59.316 --> 00:17:01.490
shows the user
slightly more options.

00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:03.234
So that is cool.

00:17:03.234 --> 00:17:05.359
ROMAN NURIK: And we have
a little bit more guidance

00:17:05.359 --> 00:17:08.440
on what the exact
touch target should be,

00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:11.260
exactly how they should
behave in the design guide.

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:17.349
So if you go to
 developer.android.com/design/pattern/navigation-drawers.hmtl

00:17:17.349 --> 00:17:20.550
I think it is, or just search
for Navigation Drawers Android

00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:23.660
Design, you'll see some more
details about exactly how they

00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:24.640
should behave.

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:27.310
Based each line item should
actually have two touch targets

00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:30.740
if section one has its
own landing screen.

00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:33.480
But anyway, there's
another alternative.

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:35.449
Nick, do you want to
talk about that one?

00:17:35.449 --> 00:17:36.240
NICK BUTCHER: Sure.

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:37.985
So an alternative
might be instead

00:17:37.985 --> 00:17:40.620
of putting all the
navigation in a Drawer,

00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:44.990
you might break out to another
[INAUDIBLE] subnavigation.

00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:46.880
In this example on
screen here, we're

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:49.450
in the screen you get to
when you switch sections.

00:17:49.450 --> 00:17:53.530
You have some more navigation
type activity there as well as

00:17:53.530 --> 00:17:55.180
content.

00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:56.870
Or, as we talked
about earlier on,

00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:59.375
you could combine another
navigation pattern.

00:17:59.375 --> 00:18:01.430
So for example, you
might use the Drawer

00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:03.340
for your major
navigation sections

00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:07.770
and then use a Spinner, perhaps,
for subsections of that.

00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:10.120
So don't feel like
just because you're

00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:13.770
using a Drawer that you have to
have all your navigation forced

00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:16.250
right into that
in the same place.

00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:19.304
Think about other ways to
allow subsection navigation.

00:18:19.304 --> 00:18:20.970
ROMAN NURIK: And a
good example of that,

00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:22.370
again, is Google Play Music.

00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:24.935
When you go into--
it's a Drawer-- you

00:18:24.935 --> 00:18:29.130
see things like listen now and
then My Library Under My Li

00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:32.322
Library you see things like
Artists, G Genres, and so on.

00:18:32.322 --> 00:18:33.780
That could have
been in the Drawer,

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:35.405
but that was actually
placed into tabs.

00:18:35.405 --> 00:18:37.779
The nice thing about tabs is
that you can actually really

00:18:37.779 --> 00:18:40.210
quickly swipe between those
different sub sections.

00:18:40.210 --> 00:18:43.100
So definitely think about
different ways to this.

00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:46.160
One thing I should mention
here is we specifically

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:49.250
called out content one, content
two in these little wire

00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:51.220
frames because you
don't want to just

00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:55.750
have purely navigational
elements on here.

00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:58.110
You should add a little bit
of content to the screen.

00:18:58.110 --> 00:19:00.900
You don't want to turn into
a dashboard type thing, where

00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:05.790
you see a bunch of big icons
or a bunch of big text blocks.

00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:07.390
And one of the ways
you could do that,

00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:08.780
obviously, is to show content.

00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:10.670
Another is to just show images.

00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:15.040
Show dynamic images
representing that section.

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:17.669
I think an example of that
is Google Play Newsstand.

00:19:17.669 --> 00:19:19.210
I don't remember
off the top my head.

00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:22.921
But definitely don't just
throw text on the screen.

00:19:22.921 --> 00:19:25.170
NICK BUTCHER: And you're
talking about the explore tab

00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:27.310
[INAUDIBLE].

00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:28.781
ROMAN NURIK: Exactly.

00:19:28.781 --> 00:19:29.280
All right.

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:35.000
Our eighth item here is
bad Drawer transitions.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.190
So there are a couple
things like this involves.

00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:40.300
When we say transition, we
both mean the animation,

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:45.530
the actual visual change, as
well as the transition from one

00:19:45.530 --> 00:19:48.960
screen that has a Drawer to
another screen that doesn't.

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:52.240
And actually I think the next
two items are related to this.

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:56.130
Basically, let's say
you open up the Drawer,

00:19:56.130 --> 00:19:59.170
and you touch section one,
you shouldn't actually

00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:02.980
be taken to a new
screen with an Up caret.

00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:06.860
Basically, there's a
strong guidance that says,

00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:09.802
any screens that are represented
in the Drawer-- so for example

00:20:09.802 --> 00:20:12.010
here, section one, section
two, section three, and so

00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:14.310
on-- when you actually
get to the screens

00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:17.327
they should also show a
show the Drawer indicator.

00:20:17.327 --> 00:20:19.410
So the first issue here
is that you don't actually

00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:22.920
see the Drawer indicator, you
see this up caret instead.

00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:24.840
So that would be incorrect.

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:28.300
But another slightly more
subtle aspect of this

00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:29.560
is the transition.

00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:33.120
When you go between section
one and section two ,

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:37.280
you shouldn't see this standard
default zoom up transition that

00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:43.120
takes that you see when diving
into content or showing a new

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:45.410
activity, showing a new screen.

00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:47.942
You should, first of all, try
to suppress that transition.

00:20:47.942 --> 00:20:49.150
So it should be really fluid.

00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:51.290
It's almost like,
you touch something,

00:20:51.290 --> 00:20:54.040
the Drawer closes,
and then the content

00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:57.400
of the section you just selected
just fades in or appears.

00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:59.340
It shouldn't be is
jarring kind of zoom up

00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:01.320
animation that
changes the Action Bar

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:03.494
and does all this stuff.

00:21:03.494 --> 00:21:04.910
Another thing to
think about, more

00:21:04.910 --> 00:21:07.530
for developers is-- and
this is a question we

00:21:07.530 --> 00:21:10.780
get all the time-- is, should
I have a multiple activity

00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:13.590
or multiple fragment app
when I'm using the Drawer?

00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:15.470
And there's no easy answer.

00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:17.510
There's no right answer.

00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:20.220
It really depends
on the situation.

00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:24.060
So if you guys have suggestions
for the developers out there,

00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:25.330
feel free to comment.

00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:28.440
My suggestion would be just
examine the difficulties

00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:31.930
and whether or not it
makes sense for your app.

00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:35.570
I would think by default
start with multiple activities

00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:39.230
with replacing the transition,
but having a single activity

00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:42.870
with multiple fragments,
that is possible as well.

00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:45.360
OK, should we move on?

00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:48.080
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, I think we
just got a good example here.

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:51.250
Just reinforcing the point
that every section which

00:21:51.250 --> 00:21:54.070
appears in a Drawer, you'd
expect to have the Drawer as

00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:57.676
coordinates showing on the
screen, and for other sections,

00:21:57.676 --> 00:21:59.380
it should show you the Up caret.

00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:04.120
ROMAN NURIK: So related to that
is never showing the Up caret.

00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:05.650
And this is really
view the converse

00:22:05.650 --> 00:22:09.230
of that-- or the inverse
of that-- whatever it is.

00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:12.690
So like we said, anything that
is represented in the Drawer

00:22:12.690 --> 00:22:14.679
should show the
Drawer indicator.

00:22:14.679 --> 00:22:16.720
But things that aren't
represented in the Drawer,

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:20.030
for example, here we're looking
at a specific piece of content.

00:22:20.030 --> 00:22:24.680
We've now dived into-- or dove
into-- a specific news story,

00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:25.650
for example.

00:22:25.650 --> 00:22:28.440
At this point the, Drawer
indicator shouldn't be there.

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:30.430
You should instead
show the Up caret,

00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:33.560
because you're now in a
deeper section or a deeper

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:37.440
part of the app within one of
the sections in the Drawer.

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:40.850
And so instead of doing
something like this,

00:22:40.850 --> 00:22:43.650
you should obviously
show the Up caret.

00:22:43.650 --> 00:22:46.520
But what you can do to
still expose the Drawer

00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:48.000
is allow an edge swipe.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.330
And again, this is something
that's in our documentation,

00:22:51.330 --> 00:22:53.950
in our design guidelines.

00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:59.480
You don't necessarily have
to show the three little line

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:03.340
indicator, the Navigation Drawer
indicator, to have a drawer.

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:05.160
In this case, having
the Drawer there

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:07.170
is more like a
power user feature.

00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:09.470
For folks that discover
that gesture, great.

00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:12.240
For those that don't,
that's not so great.

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:14.410
But they always
have that ability

00:23:14.410 --> 00:23:17.320
to navigate to those other
sections by pressing Up.

00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:20.550
So you're not really
keeping functionality

00:23:20.550 --> 00:23:22.320
from a certain class of users.

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:25.600
You're really just adding
additional functionality

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:26.380
for power users.

00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:28.380
NICK BUTCHER: I guess
it's kind of two competing

00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:31.060
things, like competing
for the same space.

00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:33.530
You want the user to have
that hierarchical navigation,

00:23:33.530 --> 00:23:36.850
to have strong sense that it's
going to keep you in the app

00:23:36.850 --> 00:23:39.430
and go to a parent type screen.

00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:41.200
So you want the Up caret.

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:44.027
And one of the greatest
abilities of the Drawer

00:23:44.027 --> 00:23:46.110
is that you can have it
available to you elsewhere

00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:48.640
to do these cross-cutting
navigation gestures.

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:51.880
So I advise to resolve
those two competing

00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:56.865
things is to show the Up caret,
but allow the edge gesture.

00:23:56.865 --> 00:23:59.850
And an interesting
implementation detail

00:23:59.850 --> 00:24:02.030
is what do you do
when you [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:02.030 --> 00:24:04.720
edge swipe the Drawer open?

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:06.230
I think a really
nice way to do this

00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:08.750
is if you take a look at the
way Google Newsstand does

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:10.170
this is they'll
show the Up caret.

00:24:10.170 --> 00:24:13.040
And as you that edge swipe
out to open the Drawer,

00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:17.340
they'll cross-fade the
caret into the open Drawer

00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:18.610
affordance.

00:24:18.610 --> 00:24:20.852
So it makes sense that when
you look at the screen,

00:24:20.852 --> 00:24:22.020
oh yeah, that's
the Drawer open I

00:24:22.020 --> 00:24:23.510
know that touching
that's going to close it.

00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:25.950
But when you look at the content
screen, you have that Up.

00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:27.800
And it's giving
you that stability,

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:29.440
that expectation of navigation.

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:30.324
ROMAN NURIK: Mhmm.

00:24:30.324 --> 00:24:32.260
Exactly.

00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:34.739
Should we move on to
our last anti-pattern?

00:24:34.739 --> 00:24:35.530
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah.

00:24:35.530 --> 00:24:36.990
Unit 10.

00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:39.240
ROMAN NURIK: Do you want to
talk about this one, Nick?

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:40.874
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, for sure.

00:24:40.874 --> 00:24:42.499
So the last one we're
going to pick out

00:24:42.499 --> 00:24:43.999
is using right side navigation.

00:24:43.999 --> 00:24:46.290
And we touched on this slightly
at the top of the show.

00:24:46.290 --> 00:24:50.420
There's a strong, strong
organizational theme in Android

00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:53.380
to have navigation
activities on the left

00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:55.760
and actions on the right.

00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:57.176
With most left-to-right
languages,

00:24:57.176 --> 00:25:00.090
you scan the page in one
way, and it reinforces

00:25:00.090 --> 00:25:02.410
the hierarchy, that
this is your navigation,

00:25:02.410 --> 00:25:04.340
you're hierarchy,
your top level things.

00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:07.810
And the content is going to
be on the right hand side.

00:25:07.810 --> 00:25:10.340
So I think on this
example here, we're

00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:15.330
showing a tablet, which has a
larger screen available to it,

00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:18.047
so [INAUDIBLE] persistently.

00:25:18.047 --> 00:25:20.380
So you wouldn't want to put
that on the right hand side.

00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:21.880
You'd want to keep
that left-aligned

00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:23.922
to go with that general
organization of nav

00:25:23.922 --> 00:25:25.400
on the left.

00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:27.880
ROMAN NURIK: So basically,
here's the bad screenshot.

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:29.144
Here's the good screenshot.

00:25:29.144 --> 00:25:30.810
This really works
with both navigation--

00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:32.976
you shouldn't have Navigation
Drawers on the right--

00:25:32.976 --> 00:25:34.550
as well as Master
detail scenarios.

00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:36.390
You shouldn't have the
Master on the right.

00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:37.800
You should really have
the Master on the left.

00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:39.690
It should really
read left to right.

00:25:39.690 --> 00:25:43.870
And obviously RTL locales,
like if your language

00:25:43.870 --> 00:25:47.351
is in Hebrew or Arabic,
this would be flipped.

00:25:47.351 --> 00:25:49.476
NICK BUTCHER: Yeah, So
you've got the gravity start

00:25:49.476 --> 00:25:50.850
on Android on the
left and right.

00:25:50.850 --> 00:25:53.200
ROMAN NURIK: Exactly.

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:56.435
So those are the 10 more
anti-patterns for navigation

00:25:56.435 --> 00:25:58.530
that we wanted to
talk about today.

00:25:58.530 --> 00:26:03.740
I guess it's both navigation
and app structure, if you will.

00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:07.209
If you have any more
anti-patterns-- well

00:26:07.209 --> 00:26:09.500
this obviously wasn't a
comprehensive, exhaustive list.

00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:11.083
But if you have any
more anti-patterns

00:26:11.083 --> 00:26:13.720
that you want to
share, feel free to let

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:15.150
us know in the comments.

00:26:15.150 --> 00:26:18.090
Or just post something to
Google+ with the hashtag

00:26:18.090 --> 00:26:22.220
#AndroidDev, and we'll take
a look and possibly comment.

00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:23.990
So with that, thanks
again for joining

00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:25.310
Android Design in Action.

00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:27.462
As always, I'm your
host, Roman Nurik.

00:26:27.462 --> 00:26:29.420
NICK BUTCHER: And thanks
from me, Nick Butcher.

00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:31.470
ROMAN NURIK: See
you guys next time.
