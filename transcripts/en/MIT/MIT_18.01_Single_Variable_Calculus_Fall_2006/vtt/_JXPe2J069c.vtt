00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.730
PROFESSOR: One correction
from last time.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.710
Sorry to say, I forgot a very
important factor when I was

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.900
telling you what an
average value is.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.160
If you don't put in that factor,
it's only half off on

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.840
the exam problem that will
be given on this.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.650
So I would have gotten half off
for missing out on this

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.240
factor, too.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.190
So remember you have to divide
by n here, certainly when

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.040
you're integrating over 0 to
n, the Riemann sum is the

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.460
numerator here.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.840
And if I divide by n on that
side, I've got to divide by n

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.250
on the other side.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.250
This was meant to illustrate
this idea that we're dividing

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.540
by the total here.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:02.350
And we are going to be
talking about average

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.300
value in more detail.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.690
Not today, though.

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:16.190
So this has to do with
average value.

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.940
And we'll discuss it in
considerable detail in a

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:27.340
couple of days, I guess.

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:33.900
Now, today I want to continue.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.690
I didn't have time to finish
my discussion of the

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.900
Fundamental Theorem
of Calculus 2.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.110
And anyway it's very important
to write it down on the board

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.410
twice, because you want to
see it at least twice.

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.370
And many more times as well.

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.810
So let's just remind you, the
second version of the

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.430
Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
says the following.

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:01.470
It says that the derivative of
an integral gives you the

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.630
function back again.

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.310
So here's the theorem.

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.160
And the way I'd like to use
it today, I started this

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.500
discussion last time.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.660
But we didn't get into it.

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.120
And this is something that's on
your problem set along with

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.190
several other examples.

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:30.770
Is that we can use this to solve
differential equations.

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:37.090
And in particular, for example,
we can solve the

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:43.540
equation y' = 1 / x
with this formula.

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.730
Namely, using an integral.

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:54.770
L ( x ) is the integral
from 1 to x of dt / t.

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:00.410
The function f ( t
) is just 1 / t.

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:09.210
Now, that formula can be taken
to be the starting place for

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:11.115
the derivation of all
the properties of

00:03:11.115 --> 00:03:12.510
the logarithm function.

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.650
So what we're going to do right
now is we're going to

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:28.190
take this to be the definition
of the logarithm.

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.950
And if we do that, then I claim
that we can read off the

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.510
properties of the logarithm
just about as easily as we

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.150
could before.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.730
And so I'll illustrate
that now.

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.340
And there are a few other
examples of this where

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.450
somewhat more unfamiliar
functions come up.

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:50.580
This one is one that in theory
we know something about.

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.590
The first property of this
function is the one that's

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:53.950
already given.

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:59.580
Namely, its derivative
is 1 / x.

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.830
And we get a lot of information
just out of the

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.250
fact that its derivative
is 1 / x.

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.440
The other thing that we need
in order to nail down the

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.815
function, besides its
derivative, is one value of

00:04:09.815 --> 00:04:10.280
the function.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.670
Because it's really not
specified by this equation,

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.490
only specified up to a constant
by this equation.

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:20.330
But we nail down that constant
when we evaluate it at this

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:22.680
one place, L ( 1).

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.360
And there we're getting the
integral from 1 to 1 of dt /

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.430
t, which is 0.

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.860
And that's the case with all
these definite integrals.

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.000
If you evaluate them at their
starting places, the

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.460
value will be 0.

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.430
And together these two
properties specify this

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:42.800
function L (x), uniquely.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.800
Now, the next step is to try
to think about what its

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:47.860
properties are.

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.590
And the first approach to that,
and this is the approach

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.706
that we always take, is to maybe
graph the function, to

00:04:54.706 --> 00:04:55.870
get a feeling for it.

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.970
And so I'm going to take
the second derivative.

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.860
Now, notice that when you have
a function which is given as

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.790
an integral, its first
derivative is

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:04.930
really easy to compute.

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:06.670
And then its second derivative,
well, you have to

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:08.290
differentiate whatever
you get.

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:09.720
So it may or may not be easy.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.880
But anyway, it's a lot harder in
the case when I start with

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.150
a function to get to the
second derivative.

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:19.070
Here it's relatively easy.

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.650
And these are the properties
that I'm going to use.

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:26.410
I won't really use very much
more about it than that.

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:29.660
And qualitatively, the
conclusions that we can draw

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:33.040
from this are, first of all,
from this, for example we see

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:38.970
that this thing is concave
down every place.

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:41.640
And then to get started with the
graph, since I see I have

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:46.710
a value here, which is L( 1) =
0, I'm going to throw in the

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:48.560
value of the slope.

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.950
So L' ( 1), which I know is 1 of
1, that's reading off from

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:55.180
this equation here,
so that's 1.

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:59.200
And now I'm ready to sketch at
least a part of the curve.

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:07.680
So here's a sketch
of the graph.

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:13.000
Here's the point (1, 0);
that is, x = 1, y = 0.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.420
And the tangent line,
I know, has slope 1.

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:20.540
And the curve is concave down.

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:27.530
So it's going to look
something like this.

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:31.230
Incidentally, it's
also increasing.

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:34.960
And that's an important
property, it's strictly

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:35.400
increasing.

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:39.570
That's because L' (
x) is positive.

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:43.560
And so, we can get from this
the following important

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:44.220
definition.

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:46.130
Which, again, is working
backwards from this

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:46.610
definition.

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:49.620
We can get to where we started
with a log in our previous

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:50.620
discussion.

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:58.100
Namely, if I take the level
here, which is y = 1, then

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:59.730
that crosses the
axis someplace.

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:04.180
And his point is what we're
going to define as e.

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:13.140
So the definition of e is
that it's the value such

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:20.220
that L ( e) = 1.

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:22.800
And again, the fact that there's
exactly one such place

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.810
just comes from the fact that
this L' is positive, so that L

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:29.340
is increasing.

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:33.530
No, there's just one other
feature of this graph that I'm

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:35.930
going to emphasize to you.

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:38.430
There's one other thing which
I'm not going to check, which

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:40.060
you would ordinarily
do with graphs.

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:41.950
Once it's increasing there are
no critical points, so the

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:44.230
only other interesting
thing is the n's.

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:46.540
And it turns out that the limit
as you go down to 0 is

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:46.990
minus infinity.

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:49.840
As you go over to the right
here it's plus infinity.

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:53.340
It does get arbitrarily high;
it doesn't level off.

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:55.820
But I'm not going to
discuss that here.

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:58.400
Instead, I'm going to just
remark on one qualitative

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:02.910
feature of the graph, which is
this remark that the part

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:06.850
which is to the left
of 1 is below 0.

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:17.350
So I just want to remark, why
is L (x) negative for x &lt; 1.

00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:19.190
Maybe I don't have room
for that, so I'll just

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:23.550
put in here x &lt; 1.

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:25.320
I want to give you
two reasons.

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:27.980
Again, we're only working from
very first principles here.

00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:33.500
Just that the property that
L' = 1 / x, and L (1) = 0.

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:39.390
So our first reason is that,
well, I just said it.

00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:41.430
L ( 1) = 0.

00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:46.910
And L is increasing.

00:08:46.910 --> 00:08:49.730
And if you read that backwards,
if it gets up to 0

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:54.160
here, it must have been
negative before 0.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.960
So this is one way of seeing
that L ( x) is negative.

00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:00.150
There's a second way
of seeing it,

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:02.410
which is equally important.

00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:07.470
And it has to do with just
manipulation of integrals.

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:10.800
Here I'm going to start out
with L (x), and its

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:11.430
definition.

00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:15.730
Which is the integral
from 1 to x dt / t.

00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:19.250
And now I'm going to reverse
the order of integration.

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:21.500
This is the same, by our
definition of our properties

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:24.200
of integrals, as the integral
from x to 1 with a

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:30.010
minus sign dt / t.

00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:34.140
Now, I can tell that this
quantity is negative.

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:39.690
And the reason that I can tell
is that this chunk of it here,

00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:44.010
this piece of it, is
a positive number.

00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:46.290
This part is positive.

00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:51.290
And this part is positive
because x &lt; 1.

00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:53.740
So the lower limit is less than
the upper limit, and so

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:54.740
this is interpreted.

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:58.070
The thing in the green box is
interpreted as an area.

00:09:58.070 --> 00:09:58.970
It's an area.

00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:03.120
And so negative a positive
quantity is negative, minus a

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:08.280
positive quantity's negative.

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:12.660
So both of these work
perfectly well as

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:13.870
interpretations.

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:16.010
And it's just to illustrate
what we can do.

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:18.810
Now, there's one more
manipulation of integrals that

00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:23.380
gives us the fanciest
property of the ln.

00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:26.410
And that's the last one
that I'm going to do.

00:10:26.410 --> 00:10:29.450
And you have a similar thing
on your homework.

00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:32.920
So I'm going to prove that
this is, as I say, the

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:34.970
fanciest property of the log.

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:39.680
On your homework, by the way,
you're going to check that L(

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:46.680
1 / x) = - L ( x).

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:52.070
But we'll do this one.

00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:54.780
The idea is just to plug
in the formula

00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:56.430
and see what it gives.

00:10:56.430 --> 00:11:02.830
On the left-hand side, I
have 1 to ab, dt / t.

00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:06.040
That's L ( ab).

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:08.900
And then that's certainly equal
to the left-hand side.

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:12.650
And then I'm going to now split
this into two pieces.

00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:14.600
Again, this is a property
of integrals.

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:19.070
That if you have an integral
from one place to another, you

00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:20.620
can break it up into pieces.

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:26.540
So I'm going to start at
1 but then go to a.

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:33.950
And then I'm going to continue
from a to ab.

00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:36.580
So this is the question
that we have. We

00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:38.010
haven't proved this.

00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:41.050
Well, this one is
actually true.

00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:42.880
If we want this to be
true, we know by

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:44.900
definition L ( ab) is this.

00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:48.460
We know, we can see it,
that L(a) is this.

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:53.030
So the question that this boils
down to is, we want to

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:54.960
know that these two
things are equal.

00:11:54.960 --> 00:12:01.320
We want to know that L ( b) is
that other integral there.

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:04.960
So let's check it.

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:06.190
I'm going to rewrite
the integral.

00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:09.370
It's the integral from - sorry,
from lower limit a to

00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:13.940
upper limit ab of dt / t.

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:17.370
And now, again, to illustrate
properties of integrals, the

00:12:17.370 --> 00:12:21.230
key property here that we're
going to have to use is change

00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:23.740
of variables.

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:26.790
This is a kind of a scaled
integral where everything is

00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:29.990
multiplied by a factor of a from
what we want to get to

00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:32.010
this L ( b) quantity.

00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:38.240
And so this suggests that
we write down t = a u.

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:40.460
That's going to be our trick.

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:42.910
And if I use that new variable
u, then the change

00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:50.440
in t, dt, is adu.

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:53.950
And as a result, I can write
this as equal to an integral

00:12:53.950 --> 00:12:58.010
from, let's see, dt = adu.

00:12:58.010 --> 00:13:00.080
And t = au.

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:05.740
So I've now substituted
in for the integrand.

00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:09.210
But on top of this, with
definite integrals, we also

00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:13.080
have to check the limits.

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:17.140
And the limits work
out as follows.

00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:20.180
When t = a, that's
the lower limit.

00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:22.460
Let's just take a
look. t = a u.

00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:26.600
So that means that u
is equal to, what?

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:28.710
It's 1.

00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:31.880
Because a * 1 = a.

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:34.040
So if t = a, this is
if and only if.

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:37.095
So this lower limit, which
really in disguise was where t

00:13:37.095 --> 00:13:45.400
= a, becomes where u = 1.

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:53.920
And similarly, when
t = ab, u = b.

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:56.690
So the upper limit here is b.

00:13:56.690 --> 00:14:02.140
And now, if you notice, we're
just going to cancel these two

00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:02.920
factors here.

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:07.280
And now we recognize that this
is just the same as the

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:09.940
definition of L ( b).

00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:13.490
Because L ( x) is over
here in the box.

00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:16.270
And the fact that I use the
letter t there is irrelevant;

00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:18.020
it works equally well
with the letter u.

00:14:18.020 --> 00:14:22.430
So this is just L (b).

00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:33.160
Which is what we
wanted to show.

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:35.680
So that's an example, and you
have one in your homework,

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:45.380
which is a little similar.

00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:48.790
Now, the last example, that I'm
going to discuss of this

00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:51.390
type, I already mentioned
last time.

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:54.430
Which is the function F ( x),
which is the integral from 0

00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:58.150
to x of e ^ -t^2 dt.

00:14:58.150 --> 00:15:04.130
This one is even more exotic
because unlike the logarithm

00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:06.030
it's a new function.

00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:10.230
It really is not any function
that you can express in terms

00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:13.870
of the functions that
we know already.

00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:18.750
And the approach, always, to
these new functions is to

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:22.000
think of what their
properties are.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.570
And the way we think of
functions in order to

00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:26.570
understand them is to
maybe sketch them.

00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:27.960
And so I'm going to do
exactly the same

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:29.830
thing I did over here.

00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:31.630
So, what is it that I
can get out of this?

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:35.105
Well, immediately I can figure
out what the derivative is.

00:15:35.105 --> 00:15:38.000
I read it off from the
fundamental theorem.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.610
It's this.

00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:45.470
I also can figure out the value
at the starting place.

00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:48.440
In this case, the starting
place is 0.

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:53.990
And the value is 0.

00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:57.600
And I should check the second
derivative, which is also not

00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:59.145
so difficult to compute.

00:15:59.145 --> 00:16:06.070
The second derivative
is - 2x e ^ x^2.

00:16:06.070 --> 00:16:10.650
And so now I can see that this
function is increasing,

00:16:10.650 --> 00:16:13.300
because this derivative is
positive, it's always

00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:14.670
increasing.

00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:17.940
And it's going to be concave
down when x is positive and

00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:20.540
concave up when x is negative.

00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:24.900
Because there's a minus sign
here, so the sign is negative.

00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:30.250
This is less than 0 when x is
positive and greater than 0

00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:36.800
when x is negative.

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:40.160
And maybe to get started I'll
remind you F( 0), 0.

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:45.220
It's also true that F' ( 0),
that just comes right out of

00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:52.450
this, F' ( 0) = e ^
- 0^2 which is 1.

00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:55.420
That means the tangent line
again has slope 1.

00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:57.090
We do this a lot
with functions.

00:16:57.090 --> 00:17:00.390
We normalize them so that their
slopes of their tangent

00:17:00.390 --> 00:17:03.600
lines are 1 at convenient
spots.

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:06.390
So here's the tangent
line of slope 1.

00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:11.540
We know this thing is concave
down to the right and concave

00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:14.890
up to the left.

00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:17.570
And so it's going to look
something like this.

00:17:17.570 --> 00:17:20.860
With an inflection point.

00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:26.290
Right?

00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:32.530
Now, I want to say one more,
make one more remark about

00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:34.590
this function, or maybe two
more remarks about this

00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:36.050
function, before we go on.

00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:39.230
Really, you want to know this
graph as well as possible.

00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:42.220
And so there are just a
couple more features.

00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:45.825
And one is enormously helpful
because it cuts in half all of

00:17:45.825 --> 00:17:49.180
the work that you have. and
that is the property that

00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:51.800
turns out that this
function is i.

00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:56.860
Namely, F( - x) = - F(x).

00:17:56.860 --> 00:18:01.050
That's what's known as
an odd function.

00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:06.150
Now, the reason why it's
odd is that it's the

00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:08.500
antiderivative of something
that's even.

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:10.430
This function in here is even.

00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:14.860
And we nailed it down so
that it was 0 at 0.

00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:17.540
Another way of interpreting
that, and let me show it to

00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:20.560
you underneath, is
the following.

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:24.160
When we look at its derivative,
its derivative,

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:28.190
course, is the function e ^ x.

00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:30.040
Sorry, e ^ - x ^2.

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:37.430
So that's this shape here.

00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:41.670
And you can see the slope is 0,
but fairly close to 0, but

00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:42.610
positive along here.

00:18:42.610 --> 00:18:44.560
It's getting, this is
its steepest point.

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:46.090
This is the highest
point here.

00:18:46.090 --> 00:18:48.210
And then it's leveling off
again; the slope is going

00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:50.670
down, always positive.

00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:56.860
This is the graph of
F' = e ^ -x^2.

00:18:56.860 --> 00:19:02.440
Now, the interpretation of the
function that's up above is

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:08.510
that the value here is
the area from 0 to x.

00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:12.690
So this is area F(x).

00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:16.570
Maybe I'll color it in, decorate
it a little bit.

00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:25.120
So this area here is F ( x).

00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:28.840
Now, I want to show you
this odd property,

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:30.900
by using this symmetry.

00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:35.350
The graph here is even, so in
other words, what's back here

00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:39.290
is exactly the same
as what's forward.

00:19:39.290 --> 00:19:42.580
But now there's a reversal.

00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:45.070
Because we're keeping track
of the area starting

00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:46.330
from 0 going forward.

00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:47.090
That's positive.

00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:49.940
If we go backwards, it's
counted negatively.

00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:52.790
So if we went backwards to - x,
we'd get exactly the same

00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:54.970
as that green patch
over there.

00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:56.810
We'd get a red patch
over here.

00:19:56.810 --> 00:20:01.280
But it would be counted
negatively.

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:04.210
And that's the property
that it's odd.

00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:06.010
You can also check this
by properties

00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:08.920
of integrals directly.

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:16.190
That would be just like
this process here.

00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:19.910
So it's completely analogous
to checking this

00:20:19.910 --> 00:20:25.410
formula over there.

00:20:25.410 --> 00:20:29.670
So that's one of the comments
I wanted to make about this.

00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:32.110
And why does this save us
a lot of time, if we

00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:33.100
know this is odd?

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:36.270
Well, we know that the shape of
this branch is exactly the

00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:38.950
reverse, or the reflection,
if you like, of the

00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:39.940
shape of this one.

00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:42.180
What we want to do is flip it
under the axis and then

00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:44.960
reflect it over that way.

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:53.590
And that's the symmetry property
of the graph of F(x).

00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:57.920
Now, the last property that I
want to mention is what's

00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:00.750
happening with the ends.

00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:03.570
And at the end there's
an asymptote,

00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:05.820
there's a limit here.

00:21:05.820 --> 00:21:10.700
So this is an asymptote.

00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:12.840
And the same thing down here,
which will be exactly because

00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:15.790
of the odd feature, this'll
be exactly negative.

00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:19.570
The opposite value over here.

00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:23.570
And you might ask yourself, what
level is this, exactly.

00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:26.850
Now, that level turns out to be
a very important quantity.

00:21:26.850 --> 00:21:29.760
It's interpreted down here as
the area under this whole

00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:31.620
infinite stretch.

00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:36.670
It's all the way out
to infinity.

00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:38.960
So, let's see.

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:48.740
What do you think it is?

00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:49.750
You're all clueless.

00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:52.460
Well, maybe not all of you,
you're just afraid to say.

00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:54.140
So it's obvious.

00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:57.040
It's the square root of pi/2.

00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:00.170
That was right on the tip of
your tongue, wasn't it?

00:22:00.170 --> 00:22:01.610
STUDENT: Ah, yes.

00:22:01.610 --> 00:22:04.250
PROFESSOR: Right, so this is
actually very un-obvious, but

00:22:04.250 --> 00:22:06.290
it's a very important
quantity.

00:22:06.290 --> 00:22:08.750
And it's an amazing fact
that this thing

00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:10.720
approaches this number.

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:18.060
And it's something that people
worried about for many years

00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:22.860
before actually nailing down.

00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:26.705
And so what I just claimed here
is that the limit as x

00:22:26.705 --> 00:22:33.300
approaches infinity of F ( x)
= the square root of pi / 2.

00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:35.700
And similarly, if you do it to
minus infinity, you'll get

00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:38.370
minus square root of pi/2.

00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:42.090
And for this reason, people
introduce a new function

00:22:42.090 --> 00:22:44.010
because they like
the number 1.

00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:49.740
This function is erf, short
for error function.

00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:54.140
And it's 2 / the square root of
pi times the integral from

00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:57.630
0 to x, e ^ - t ^2 dt.

00:22:57.630 --> 00:23:00.210
In other words, it's just our
original, our previous

00:23:00.210 --> 00:23:08.240
function multiplied by 2 /
the square root of pi.

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:10.880
And that's the function which
gets tabulated quite a lot.

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:14.520
You'll see it on the internet
everywhere, and it's a very

00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:15.900
important function.

00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:18.540
There are other normalizations
that are used, and the

00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:21.260
discussions of the other
normalizations are in your

00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:25.280
problems. This is one
of them, and another

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:27.540
one is in your exercises.

00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:31.130
The standard normal
distribution.

00:23:31.130 --> 00:23:33.660
There are tons of functions
like this, which are new

00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:35.920
functions that we can
get at once we

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:37.650
have the tool of integrals.

00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:40.580
And I'll write down just one
or two more, just so that

00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:42.760
you'll see the variety.

00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:49.080
Here's one which is called
a Fresnel integral.

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:52.380
On your problem set next week,
we'll do the other Fresnel

00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:57.090
integral, we'll look
at this one.

00:23:57.090 --> 00:24:01.990
These functions cannot be
expressed in elementary terms.

00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:11.890
The one on your homework for
this week was this one.

00:24:11.890 --> 00:24:14.980
This one comes up in
Fourier analysis.

00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:19.910
And I'm going to just tell you
maybe one more such function.

00:24:19.910 --> 00:24:23.310
There's a function which is
called Li ( x), logarithmic

00:24:23.310 --> 00:24:30.220
integral of x, which
is this guy.

00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:33.640
The reciprocal of the logarithm,
the natural log.

00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:38.800
And the significance of this
one is that Li ( x) is

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:49.680
approximately equal to the
number of primes &lt; x.

00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:54.430
And, in fact, if you can make
this as precise as possible,

00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:58.980
you'll be famous for millennia,
because this is

00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:01.830
known as the Riemann
hypothesis.

00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:05.370
Exactly how closely this
approximation occurs.

00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:09.720
But it's a hard problem, and
already a century ago the

00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:12.260
prime number theorem, which
established this connection

00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:18.450
was extremely important
to progress in math.

00:25:18.450 --> 00:25:19.340
Yeah, question.

00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:21.350
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:23.700
PROFESSOR: Is this stuff you're
supposed to understand.

00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:24.840
That's a good question.

00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:26.300
I love that question.

00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:31.000
The answer is, this is,
so we launched off

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.080
into something here.

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:34.310
And let me just explain
it to you.

00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:37.140
I'm going to be talking a fair
amount more about this

00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:42.140
particular function, because
it's associated to the normal

00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:43.240
distribution.

00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:45.240
And I'm going to let you
get familiar with it.

00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:47.810
What I'm doing here is
purely cultural.

00:25:47.810 --> 00:25:51.500
Well, after this panel, what I'm
doing is purely cultural.

00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:54.060
Just saying there's a lot
of other beasts out

00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:55.810
there in the world.

00:25:55.810 --> 00:25:57.930
And one of them is called
C of [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:57.930 --> 00:26:01.460
So we'll have a just a very
passing familiarity with one

00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:02.920
or two of these functions.

00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:05.750
But there are literally dozens
and dozens of them.

00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:08.980
The only thing that you'll need
to do with such functions

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:13.230
is things like understanding
the derivative, the second

00:26:13.230 --> 00:26:16.140
derivative, and tracking
what the function does.

00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:18.950
Sketching the same way you
did with any other tool.

00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:22.870
So we're going to do this type
of thing with these functions.

00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:25.760
And I'll have to lead
you through.

00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:27.690
If I wanted to ask you a
question about one of these

00:26:27.690 --> 00:26:32.470
functions, I have to tell you
exactly what I'm aiming for.

00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:35.960
Yeah, another question.

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:36.580
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:36.762
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I did.

00:26:36.762 --> 00:26:43.520
I called these guys
Fresnel integrals.

00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:47.460
The guy's name is Fresnel.

00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:49.180
It's just named after
a person.

00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:52.450
But, and this one, Li's
logarithmic integral, it's not

00:26:52.450 --> 00:26:53.250
named after a person.

00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:56.820
Logarithm is not somebody's
name.

00:26:56.820 --> 00:27:01.960
So look, in fact this will be
mentioned also on a problem

00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:04.450
set, but I don't expect you
to remember these names.

00:27:04.450 --> 00:27:06.970
In particular, that you
definitely don't want to try

00:27:06.970 --> 00:27:07.600
to remember.

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:08.730
Yes, another question.

00:27:08.730 --> 00:27:10.020
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:15.240
PROFESSOR: The question is,
will we prove this limit.

00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:17.470
And the answer is yes,
if we have time.

00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:21.490
It'll be in about
a week or so.

00:27:21.490 --> 00:27:22.690
We're not going to do it now.

00:27:22.690 --> 00:27:29.010
It takes us quite a bit
of work to do it.

00:27:29.010 --> 00:27:32.630
OK.

00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:36.260
I'm going to change years now,
I'm going to shift gears.

00:27:36.260 --> 00:27:41.750
And we're going to go back to
a more standard thing which

00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:44.650
has to do with just setting
up integrals.

00:27:44.650 --> 00:27:47.820
And this has to do with
understanding where integrals

00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:50.910
play a role, and they play a
role in cumulative sums, in

00:27:50.910 --> 00:27:52.160
evaluating things.

00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:55.480
This is much more closely
associated with the first

00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:57.020
Fundamental Theorem.

00:27:57.020 --> 00:27:59.920
That is, we'll take, today
we were talking about how

00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:02.260
integrals are formulas
for functions.

00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:04.730
Or solutions to differential
equations.

00:28:04.730 --> 00:28:08.910
We're going to go back and talk
about integrals as being

00:28:08.910 --> 00:28:13.960
the answer to a question
as opposed to.

00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:14.400
what we've done now.

00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:19.000
So in other words, and the first
example, or most of the

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.880
examples for now, are going
to be taken from geometry.

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:27.440
Later on we'll get
to probability.

00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:44.550
And the first topic is just
areas between curves.

00:28:44.550 --> 00:28:46.890
Here's the idea.

00:28:46.890 --> 00:28:50.310
If you have a couple of curves
that look like this and maybe

00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:54.330
like this, and you want to start
at a place a and you

00:28:54.330 --> 00:29:03.480
want to end at a place b, then
you can chop it up the same

00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:07.770
way we did with Riemann
sums. And take a chunk

00:29:07.770 --> 00:29:10.780
that looks like this.

00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:12.810
And I'm going to write the
thickness of that chunk.

00:29:12.810 --> 00:29:14.710
Well, let's give these
things names.

00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:17.490
Let's say the top curve is
f(x), and the bottom

00:29:17.490 --> 00:29:20.510
curve is g ( x).

00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:26.980
And then this thickness
is going to be dx.

00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:30.020
That's the thickness.

00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:32.300
And what is the height?

00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:34.880
Well, the height is the
difference between the top

00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:38.970
value and the bottom value.

00:29:38.970 --> 00:29:44.120
So here we have (f (
x) - g ( x)) dx.

00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:50.120
This is, if you like, base times
- whoops, backwards.

00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:54.850
This is height, and this is
the base of the rectangle.

00:29:54.850 --> 00:29:56.850
And these are approximately
correct.

00:29:56.850 --> 00:29:59.690
But of course, only in limit
when this is an infinitesimal,

00:29:59.690 --> 00:30:03.890
is it exactly right.

00:30:03.890 --> 00:30:06.220
In order to get the
whole area, I have

00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:10.380
add these guys up.

00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:11.920
So I'm going to integrate
from a to b.

00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:14.350
That's summing them, that's
adding them up.

00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:16.470
And that's going
to be my area.

00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:27.280
So that's the story here.

00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:30.020
Now, let me just say two
things about this.

00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:33.360
First of all, on a very abstract
level before we get

00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:36.510
started with details of more
complicated problems. The

00:30:36.510 --> 00:30:40.340
first one is that every problem
that I'm going to be

00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:44.110
talking about from now on for,
several days, involves the

00:30:44.110 --> 00:30:48.700
following collection of,
the following goals.

00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:52.090
I want to identify something
to integrate.

00:30:52.090 --> 00:30:58.010
That's called an integrand.

00:30:58.010 --> 00:31:06.420
And I want to identify what
are known as the limits.

00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:12.100
The whole game is simply to
figure out what a, b, and this

00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:13.240
quantity is here.

00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:15.480
Whatever it is.

00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:18.090
And the minute we have that, we
can calculate the integral

00:31:18.090 --> 00:31:19.810
if we like.

00:31:19.810 --> 00:31:22.430
We have numerical procedures
or maybe we have analytic

00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:25.150
procedures, but anyway we
can get at the integral.

00:31:25.150 --> 00:31:27.580
The goal here is
to set them up.

00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:29.580
And in order to set
them up, you must

00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:31.720
know these three things.

00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:34.020
The lower limit, the upper
limit, and what we're

00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:37.920
integrating.

00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:42.280
If you leave one of these out,
it's like the following thing.

00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:45.450
I ask you what the area
of this region is.

00:31:45.450 --> 00:31:48.740
If I left out this end, how
could I possibly know?

00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:51.170
I don't even know where it
starts, so how can I figure

00:31:51.170 --> 00:31:53.240
out what this area is if I
haven't identified what the

00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:55.230
left side is.

00:31:55.230 --> 00:31:58.210
I can't leave out the bottom.

00:31:58.210 --> 00:32:00.560
It's sitting here,
in this formula.

00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:03.450
Because I need to know
where it is.

00:32:03.450 --> 00:32:05.340
And I need to know the top and
I need to know this side.

00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:07.600
Those are the four sides
of the figure.

00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:10.360
If I don't incorporate them
into the information, I'll

00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:11.640
never get anything out.

00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:13.620
So I need to know everything.

00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:16.040
And I need to know exactly those
things, in order to have

00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:20.740
a formula for the area.

00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:24.410
Now, when this gets carried out
in practice, as we will do

00:32:24.410 --> 00:32:28.430
now in our first example,
it's more

00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:29.650
complicated than it looks.

00:32:29.650 --> 00:32:48.680
So here's our first example:
Find the area between x = y ^2

00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:57.650
and y = x - 2.

00:32:57.650 --> 00:33:00.110
This is our first example.

00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:04.950
Let me make sure that I chose
the example that I wanted to.

00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:08.420
Yeah.

00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:20.300
Now, there's a first step in
figuring these things out.

00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:27.660
And this is that you must
draw a picture.

00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:30.290
If you don't draw a picture
you'll never figure out what

00:33:30.290 --> 00:33:33.680
this area is, because you'll
never figure out what's what

00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:36.290
between these curves.

00:33:36.290 --> 00:33:40.540
The first curve, y = x
^2, is a parabola.

00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:42.990
But x is a function of y.

00:33:42.990 --> 00:33:45.090
It's pointing this way.

00:33:45.090 --> 00:33:47.450
So it's this parabola here.

00:33:47.450 --> 00:33:50.690
That's y = x^2.

00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:57.910
Whoops, x = y ^2.

00:33:57.910 --> 00:34:06.700
The second curve is a line, a
straight line of slope 1,

00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:09.670
starting at (x = 2, y = 0).

00:34:09.670 --> 00:34:14.160
It goes through this place here,
which is 2 over and has

00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:20.060
slope 1, so it does this.

00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:23.510
And this shape in here is what
we mean by the area between

00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:24.100
the curves.

00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:27.140
Now that we see what it is,
we have a better idea of

00:34:27.140 --> 00:34:28.130
what our goal is.

00:34:28.130 --> 00:34:39.310
If you haven't drawn it,
you have no hope.

00:34:39.310 --> 00:34:43.120
Now, I'm going to describe
two ways of getting

00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:50.660
at this area here.

00:34:50.660 --> 00:35:00.660
And the first one is motivated
by the shape that I just

00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:02.970
described right here.

00:35:02.970 --> 00:35:07.210
Namely, I'm going to use it
in a straightforward way.

00:35:07.210 --> 00:35:12.560
I'm going to chop things up
into these vertical pieces

00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:17.160
just as I did right there.

00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:19.415
Now, here's the difficulty
with that.

00:35:19.415 --> 00:35:26.300
The difficulty is that the
upper curve here has one

00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:29.440
formula but the lower curve
shifts from being a part of

00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:33.120
the parabola to being a part
of the straight line.

00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:35.460
That means that there are two
different formulas for the

00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:36.930
lower function.

00:35:36.930 --> 00:35:39.940
And the only way to accommodate
that is to

00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:42.780
separate this up into
two halves.

00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:44.980
Separate it out into
two halves.

00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:50.320
I'm going to have to divide
it right here.

00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:54.320
So we must break it into two
pieces and find the integral

00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:57.350
of one half and the other half.

00:35:57.350 --> 00:35:57.780
Question?

00:35:57.780 --> 00:36:07.460
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:07.460 --> 00:36:08.060
PROFESSOR: So, you're one
step ahead of me.

00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:10.120
We'll also have to be sure to
distinguish between the top

00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:12.530
branch and the bottom branch of
the parabola, which we're

00:36:12.530 --> 00:36:14.430
about to do.

00:36:14.430 --> 00:36:18.330
Now, in order to distinguish
what's going on I actually

00:36:18.330 --> 00:36:22.000
have to use multi colors here.

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.680
And so we will do that.

00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:29.720
First there's the top part,
which is orange.

00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:32.200
That's the top part.

00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:33.990
I'll call it top.

00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:41.600
And then there's the bottom
part, which has two halves.

00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:53.280
They are pink, and I
guess this is blue.

00:36:53.280 --> 00:37:01.240
Alright, so now let's see
what's happening.

00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:07.240
The most important two points
that I have to figure out in

00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:08.580
order to get started here.

00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:09.960
Well, really I'm going
to have to figure out

00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:11.010
three points, I claim.

00:37:11.010 --> 00:37:13.460
I'm going to have to figure
out where this point is.

00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:17.650
Where this point is, and
where that point is.

00:37:17.650 --> 00:37:20.750
If I know where these three
points are, then I have a

00:37:20.750 --> 00:37:23.320
chance of knowing where
to start, where

00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:25.390
to end, and so forth.

00:37:25.390 --> 00:37:26.170
Another question.

00:37:26.170 --> 00:37:27.490
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:27.490 --> 00:37:31.110
PROFESSOR: Could you speak up?

00:37:31.110 --> 00:37:37.770
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:37.770 --> 00:37:39.350
PROFESSOR: The question
is, why do we need to

00:37:39.350 --> 00:37:41.450
split up the area.

00:37:41.450 --> 00:37:44.330
And I think in order to answer
that question further, I'm

00:37:44.330 --> 00:37:47.050
going to have to go into the
details of the method, and

00:37:47.050 --> 00:37:51.480
then you'll see where
it's necessary.

00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:54.870
So the first step is that I'm
going to figure out what these

00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:57.160
three points are.

00:37:57.160 --> 00:38:02.460
This one is kind of easy;
it's the point (0, 0).

00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:05.070
This point down here and
this point up here are

00:38:05.070 --> 00:38:08.010
intersections of
the two curves.

00:38:08.010 --> 00:38:11.150
I can identify them by the
following equation.

00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:21.330
I need to see where these
curves intersect.

00:38:21.330 --> 00:38:26.690
At what, well, if I plug in x
= y^2, I get y = y^2 - 2.

00:38:26.690 --> 00:38:29.010
And then I can solve this
quadratic equation. y

00:38:29.010 --> 00:38:33.840
^2 - y - 2 = 0.

00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:39.360
So (y - 2)( y + 1) = 0.

00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:52.630
And this is telling me that
y = 2 or y = - 1.

00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:54.250
So I've found y = - 1.

00:38:54.250 --> 00:39:00.430
That means this point down here
has second entry - 1.

00:39:00.430 --> 00:39:04.770
Its first entry, its x value,
I can get from this formula

00:39:04.770 --> 00:39:06.890
here or the other formula.

00:39:06.890 --> 00:39:10.800
I have to square,
this - 1 ^2 = 1.

00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:15.020
So that's the formula
for this point.

00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:20.180
And the other point has
second entry 2.

00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:23.690
And, again, with his formula y
= x ^2, I have to square y to

00:39:23.690 --> 00:39:31.790
get x, so this is 4.

00:39:31.790 --> 00:39:37.340
Now, I claim I have enough
data to get started.

00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:41.160
But maybe I'll identify
one more thing.

00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:48.890
I need the top, the bottom left,
and the bottom right.

00:39:48.890 --> 00:39:54.930
The top is the formula for this
branch of x = y ^2, which

00:39:54.930 --> 00:39:57.880
is in the positive y region.

00:39:57.880 --> 00:40:05.130
And that is y = the
square root of x.

00:40:05.130 --> 00:40:09.930
The bottom curve, part of the
parabola, so this is the

00:40:09.930 --> 00:40:21.980
bottom left, is y = minus
square root x.

00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:24.210
That's the other branch
of the square root.

00:40:24.210 --> 00:40:26.960
And this is exactly what
you were asking before.

00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:28.810
And this is, we have to
distinguish between these two.

00:40:28.810 --> 00:40:31.510
And the point is, these formulas
really are different.

00:40:31.510 --> 00:40:34.400
They're not the same.

00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:38.030
Now, the last bit is the bottom
right chunk here, which

00:40:38.030 --> 00:40:39.910
is this pink part.

00:40:39.910 --> 00:40:44.330
Bottom right.

00:40:44.330 --> 00:40:49.060
And that one is the formula
for the line.

00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:55.990
And that's y = x - 2.

00:40:55.990 --> 00:41:03.450
Now I'm ready to
find the area.

00:41:03.450 --> 00:41:06.070
It's going to be
in two chunks.

00:41:06.070 --> 00:41:15.060
This is the left part,
plus the right part.

00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:18.300
And the left part, and I want to
set it up as an integral, I

00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:21.350
want there to be a dx and here
I want to set up an integral

00:41:21.350 --> 00:41:23.740
and I want it to be dx.

00:41:23.740 --> 00:41:26.400
I need to figure out what
the range of x is.

00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:28.280
So, first I'm going to - well,
let's leave ourselves a little

00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:37.640
more room than that.

00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:39.310
Just to be safe.

00:41:39.310 --> 00:41:45.740
OK, here's the right.

00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:48.490
So here we have our dx.

00:41:48.490 --> 00:41:53.160
Now, I need to figure out
the starting place

00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:54.960
and the ending place.

00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:57.425
So the starting place is
the leftmost place.

00:41:57.425 --> 00:42:00.000
The leftmost place
is over here.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.890
And x = 0 there.

00:42:02.890 --> 00:42:06.160
So we're going to travel from
this vertical line to the

00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:08.420
green line.

00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:09.070
Over here.

00:42:09.070 --> 00:42:13.100
And that's from 0 to 1.

00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:17.280
And the difference between the
orange curve and the blue

00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:22.330
curve is what I call top and
bottom left, over there.

00:42:22.330 --> 00:42:32.280
So that is square root of x
minus minus square root of x.

00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:41.170
Again, this is what I call
top, and this was bottom.

00:42:41.170 --> 00:42:48.850
But only the left.

00:42:48.850 --> 00:42:52.570
I claim that's giving me the
left half of this, the left

00:42:52.570 --> 00:42:55.650
section of this diagram.

00:42:55.650 --> 00:42:59.780
Now I'm going to do the right
section of the diagram.

00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:02.040
I start at 1.

00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:04.160
The lower limit is 1.

00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:08.490
And I go all the way
to this point here.

00:43:08.490 --> 00:43:11.160
Which is the last bit.

00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:13.070
And that's going to be x = 4.

00:43:13.070 --> 00:43:19.130
The upper limit here is 4.

00:43:19.130 --> 00:43:21.480
And now I have to take the
difference between the top and

00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:22.570
the bottom again.

00:43:22.570 --> 00:43:24.800
The top is square root
of x all over again.

00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:26.570
But the bottom has changed.

00:43:26.570 --> 00:43:31.430
The bottom is now the
quantity (x - 2).

00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:32.990
Please don't forget
your parenthesis.

00:43:32.990 --> 00:43:44.000
There's going to be minus
signs and cancellations.

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.420
Now, this is almost the
end of the problem.

00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:48.270
The rest of it is routine.

00:43:48.270 --> 00:43:52.440
We would just have to evaluate
these integrals.

00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:57.500
And, fortunately, I'm going
to spare you that.

00:43:57.500 --> 00:43:59.330
We're not going to
bother to do it.

00:43:59.330 --> 00:44:01.050
That's the easy part.

00:44:01.050 --> 00:44:03.570
We're not going to do it.

00:44:03.570 --> 00:44:05.840
But I'm going to show you that
there's a much quicker way

00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:07.320
with this integral.

00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:09.980
And with this area calculation.

00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:10.910
Right now.

00:44:10.910 --> 00:44:15.880
The quicker way is what
you see when you see

00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:18.030
how long this is.

00:44:18.030 --> 00:44:20.680
And you see that there's another
device that you can

00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:24.350
use that looks similar in
principle to this, but

00:44:24.350 --> 00:44:28.250
reverses the roles of x and y.

00:44:28.250 --> 00:44:33.550
And the other device, which
I'll draw over here,

00:44:33.550 --> 00:44:35.530
schematically.

00:44:35.530 --> 00:44:47.130
No, maybe I'll draw it on
this blackboard here.

00:44:47.130 --> 00:44:55.820
So, Method 2, if you like,
this was Method 1, and we

00:44:55.820 --> 00:45:04.180
should call it the hard way.

00:45:04.180 --> 00:45:12.860
Method 2, which is better
in this case, is to use

00:45:12.860 --> 00:45:24.710
horizontal slices.

00:45:24.710 --> 00:45:33.100
Let me draw the picture,
at least schematically.

00:45:33.100 --> 00:45:35.230
Here's our picture that
we had before.

00:45:35.230 --> 00:45:39.140
And now instead of slicing it
vertically, I'm going to slice

00:45:39.140 --> 00:45:40.530
it horizontally.

00:45:40.530 --> 00:45:44.910
Like this.

00:45:44.910 --> 00:45:49.740
Now, the dimensions have
different names.

00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:51.990
But the principle is similar.

00:45:51.990 --> 00:45:55.170
The width, we now call dy.

00:45:55.170 --> 00:45:58.600
Because it's the change in y.

00:45:58.600 --> 00:46:05.700
And this distance here, from the
left end to the right end,

00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:09.950
we have to figure out what the
formulas for those things are.

00:46:09.950 --> 00:46:16.500
So on the left, maybe I'll draw
them color coded again.

00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:19.630
So here's a left.

00:46:19.630 --> 00:46:23.400
And, whoops, orange
is right, I guess.

00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:24.580
So here we go.

00:46:24.580 --> 00:46:30.470
So we have the left, which
is this green.

00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:35.430
Is x = y ^2.

00:46:35.430 --> 00:46:46.090
And the right, which is
orange, is y = x - 2.

00:46:46.090 --> 00:46:50.860
And now in order to use this,
it's going to turn out that we

00:46:50.860 --> 00:46:53.170
want to write x as, we want
to reverse roles.

00:46:53.170 --> 00:46:57.820
So we want to write this as
x is a function of y.

00:46:57.820 --> 00:47:04.560
So we'll use it in this form.

00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:11.950
And now I want to set up
the integral for you.

00:47:11.950 --> 00:47:14.700
This time, the area
is equal to an

00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:21.200
integral in the dy variable.

00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:26.350
And its starting place
is down here.

00:47:26.350 --> 00:47:28.960
And it's ending place
is up there.

00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:30.850
This is the lowest value
of y, and this is the

00:47:30.850 --> 00:47:31.900
top value of y.

00:47:31.900 --> 00:47:34.940
And we've already computed
those things.

00:47:34.940 --> 00:47:39.830
The lowest level of y is - 1.

00:47:39.830 --> 00:47:42.200
So this is y = - 1.

00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:45.660
And this top value is y = 2.

00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:51.490
So this goes from - 1 to 2.

00:47:51.490 --> 00:47:57.200
And now the difference is this
distance here, the distance

00:47:57.200 --> 00:47:59.880
between the rightmost point
and the leftmost point.

00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:02.020
Those are the two dimensions.

00:48:02.020 --> 00:48:04.910
So again, it's a rectangle but
its horizontal is long and its

00:48:04.910 --> 00:48:07.630
vertical is very short.

00:48:07.630 --> 00:48:08.320
And what are they?

00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:11.530
It's the difference between
the right and the left.

00:48:11.530 --> 00:48:21.760
The right-hand is (y + 2), and
the right-hand is y ^2.

00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:26.990
So this is the formula.

00:48:26.990 --> 00:48:35.750
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:35.750 --> 00:48:39.090
PROFESSOR: What was
the question?

00:48:39.090 --> 00:48:41.630
Why is it right minus left?

00:48:41.630 --> 00:48:42.770
That's very important.

00:48:42.770 --> 00:48:44.540
Why is it right minus left?

00:48:44.540 --> 00:48:47.230
And that's actually the point
that I was about to make.

00:48:47.230 --> 00:48:48.400
Which is this.

00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:53.860
That y + 2, which is the right,
is bigger than y ^2,

00:48:53.860 --> 00:48:55.480
which is the left.

00:48:55.480 --> 00:49:00.320
So that means that y +
2 - y ^2 is positive.

00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:02.830
If you do it backwards, you'll
always get a negative number

00:49:02.830 --> 00:49:07.300
and you'll always get
the wrong answer.

00:49:07.300 --> 00:49:11.010
So this is the right-hand end
minus the left-hand end gives

00:49:11.010 --> 00:49:14.300
you a positive number.

00:49:14.300 --> 00:49:16.760
And it's not obvious, actually,
where you are.

00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:19.030
There's another double-check,
by the way.

00:49:19.030 --> 00:49:21.030
When you look at this quantity,
you see that the

00:49:21.030 --> 00:49:22.630
ends pinch.

00:49:22.630 --> 00:49:25.320
And that's exactly the
crossover points.

00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:30.950
That is, when y = - 1,
y + 2 - y ^2 = 0.

00:49:30.950 --> 00:49:36.940
And when y = 2, y
+ 2 - y ^2 = 0.

00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:40.240
And that's not an accident,
that's exactly the geometry of

00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:44.600
the shape that we picked
out there.

00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:46.560
So this is the technique.

00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:51.200
Now, this is a much more
routine integral.

00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:54.080
I'm not going to carry it out,
I'll just do one last step.

00:49:54.080 --> 00:50:01.400
Which is that this is (y ^2
/ 2) + 2y - (y ^3 / 3),

00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:03.600
evaluated at - 1 and 2.

00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:08.310
Which, if you work
it out, is 9/2.

00:50:08.310 --> 00:50:10.230
So we're done for today.

00:50:10.230 --> 00:50:13.640
And tomorrow we'll do more
volumes, more things including

00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:15.070
three dimensions.
