00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:08.960
So this book is important for, of course, a number of reasons. It's the first edition

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:16.040
of the publication of David Walker's Appeal, but it's also a copy owned by W.E.B. Du Bois,

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.880
who was the preeminent scholar
of the 20th century as it relates to

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.060
African American history and life. I would say the chances are great that he

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:30.180
had this both as a student when he was
at Harvard. But also in his own personal

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.770
library, of course, when he was teaching
at Atlanta University, and and throughout

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:42.040
his his life and career. And I would
argue that in his 1903 volumes The Souls

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.480
of Black Folk he's actually speaking to
David Walker. And there's a passage that

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:53.470
he is actually remembering Walker and
some of the other brave souls that

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:59.160
pushed back against slavery and
then into segregation, into Jim Crow.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.700
Du Bois writes, and this is in The Souls of
Black Folk "Of Our Spiritual Strivings," he

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.420
says, The history of the American Negro
is a history of this strife, -- this longing

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.980
to attain self-conscious manhood, to
merge his double life into a better and

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:18.170
truer self. In this merging he wishes
neither of the older selves to be lost.

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.450
He would not Africanize America for
America has too much to teach the world

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.970
and Africa. He would not bleach his Negro soul in a flood of white Americanism for

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.620
he knows that Negro blood has a message for the world. He simply wishes to make

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:38.450
it possible for a man to be both a Negro
and an American without being cursed and

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.800
spit upon by his fellows, without having
the doors of opportunity closed roughly

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:50.210
in his face. And so while David Walker is
appealing to the enslaved to rise up

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.680
against their masters and those that
would keep them in bondage, Du Bois is

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.420
asking for acknowledgment of this--you
know, the the selves being both the Negro

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.660
and the American, what he's calling and
identifies as double consciousness.

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.680
But he also acknowledges the fact that there
are those who have attempted to bridge

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:17.120
this gap for generations that have failed,
because there's no dialogue.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.660
There's no way to enter into the
conscience of these people,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.420
that would keep people as chattels, that would oppress people.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.840
The magnitude of this institution and what it's done to

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.400
these individuals in their spirit--it
wasn't just ignorance to the world, it was

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.510
just ignorance to the self. You know, you
believed that you were a beast.

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.380
You believed that you were not worthy of any
kind of compassion, human compassion if anything.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:58.680
So, it is a series of essays that, really, I think, inspire revolution and the hearts of men.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.670
But also it becomes--it's like a

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.900
foretelling of what was to come, in
terms of Nat Turner's rebellion and

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:12.880
eventually what the Civil War wrought. So, I mean, the books they work really well together,

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.360
because you get kind of an understanding of this pre-Civil War,

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.760
pre-abolitionist movement kind of time period, and abolitionism in terms of the

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:26.750
you know leading to the Civil War.
But you're getting these men who are

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:32.120
using their intellect to make an
argument against this institution that

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.820
made beasts of people, of human beings.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.840
Some say, "made monsters of men."

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:47.040
You have to imagine, and it's hard to imagine, how
human beings can not only categorize

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.640
other human beings as less than human,
but really act out these really barbaric

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.460
kind of procedures or, you know, gestures towards.

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.550
I mean, it's interesting when you look
through some of the materials we have

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:06.060
in the archives, that you would have actual
slave documents, bills of sale, right.

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:11.500
So, human chattels. But then there are
also books. There are also accounts of how

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:19.180
these people were brutalized by the
slaveholders, by their overseers, by the

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:28.420
system in and of itself. And to create a
category in a society of civilization of,

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:34.900
you know, people so low that they
themselves don't know it and function at

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:40.260
a level so low that it is
horrendous to understand how you come

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.880
out of that. How does one survive that? Not
only physically, but mentally?

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.600
How do you imagine yourself in the future because
the only future you can imagine is

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.700
day to day, and not projected into the
next century, or the next decade, you know?

00:04:54.700 --> 00:05:01.960
So to have the, really,
the audacity to write something such as this

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:09.130
in 1829, is to really feel, I guess,
a sense of being free. I'm free to say

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:14.400
what needs to be said because if death
is my destiny I will embrace it.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.600
And I think he is challenging his brethren to understand that: this is no life.

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:27.360
The challenge is to rise up and to claim
your life and the lives of those yet born.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.100
We also have to understand
that this book published in 1829--

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:38.380
Nat Turner's rebellion was in 1831, and there
are you know connections made to this

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:43.510
document inspiring this kind of--these
revolts. But the revolts were already

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:47.180
happening they were happening on
small-scale farms are happening in large

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:52.480
farms. But to have this published in 1829
and then to have Nat Turner's rebellion

00:05:52.500 --> 00:06:00.100
it's really, you know, telling of
the tinderbox that was America,

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:05.340
and that this institution was bound to fail.
And then later on, of course, with the

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:09.840
Civil War, you know, you have
people like Frederick Douglas, who was

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:16.180
agitating for justice and trying to bring
the nation to understand its faults.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.640
But of course you have half the
country's population in the South, that

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:26.320
believes that this War of Northern
Aggression is intended to change their

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:31.680
way of life. Disregarding the fact that
the argument eventually becomes about

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:36.540
the institution of slavery, and keeping
men and women in bondage.

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:43.100
It's an amazing history and amazing for a number of
reasons, in both, you know, infamous ways,

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:50.980
but also very important stories of, you
know, triumph and success and

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:56.800
perseverance. And I think in these
materials that we have, you know, all of

00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:01.620
them together tell a story. Separately,
they're different kind of narratives, but

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:07.590
together they tell the story of a people
coming from, you know, a situation or

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:13.710
position in a community, or in a country
that disregarded them, but they saw their

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:19.050
own value. And in seeing their own value,
they allow themselves to be transformed

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:25.440
and continue to strive towards this
place that we're in today, I guess we can say.
