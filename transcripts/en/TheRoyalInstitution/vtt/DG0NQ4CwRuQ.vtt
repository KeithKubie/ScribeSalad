00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:08.760
Faces come in all shapes and sizes and our
brains are incredibly good at recognising them.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.320
In this activity you and your kids will
explore your ability to find faces in everyday

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:15.460
objects.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:34.120
OK, year four, today we're going to do some
investigating into facial recognition

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.520
and finding faces.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.520
This activity is about searching
for faces in the objects around you.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.280
To help your kids get started, it can be useful
to show them a few examples, like these.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.820
Put your hand up
if you can see the face in the bag.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.200
OK, we can all see a face in that bag.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.149
So this is an inanimate object that
we've said looks a bit like a face.

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:02.579
Why do you guys think this looks like a face?
What features can you see? Sara?

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.510
When looking through these images you might
want to ask your kids about the common features

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.800
that make them look like faces. For example
the appearance of eyes, nose or a mouth.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:17.000
We're going to go outside and hunt down
some faces that we see around the school.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.800
You're all going to have cameras and
we're going to take lots and lots of photos,

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.160
then bring them back here to discuss them.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.860
Our brains are so well primed to recognise
faces

00:01:29.861 --> 00:01:33.540
that we tend to see them even when they aren't
really there.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.610
This should mean that your kids will have
loads of fun finding examples of faces

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.220
around your home or perhaps down the local
park.

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.690
You can use a phone or digital camera
to help document any faces you find.

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.640
The more you can capture the better.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.280
I'm going to get an idea from you guys
about what you think are the important features

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.670
of a face that we were looking for.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.160
Before you review your photos,
it's a good idea to ask your kids

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.310
about which key features helped them to identify
faces.

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.680
Using these suggestions you can then create a
table

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.320
and use this to review each of your images,

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:18.370
ticking each feature off as you find them.

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.150
Eyes?
- Yeah.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.930
Mouth?
- No.

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.680
Nose?
- Yeah. Sort of.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.280
Shape?
- No.

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.879
How is this character feeling do you think?

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.560
Normal.
- Guilty!

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.760
Right, Safwan, here is where you have to
backup your point with evidence.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.900
Why is this person guilty?

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.800
It's also worth digging a little deeper
into this activity and asking your kids what

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:46.040
emotions they think the faces are conveying
and ask them why they think that.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.160
Once you have reviewed your photos, you
should look through your table of results

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.590
to see which are the most popular features found in the images.

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.200
What feature do you think is, that is the
most important?

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.100
What do you think it is?

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:03.440
Eyes. Put your hands up if you agree that
it's the eyes.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:09.420
On our tally we can see we've got
15 instances of eyes, 13 of mouth, 10 of nose.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.639
They were the frontrunners.
So we think that eyes are the most important.

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:18.269
And so we're really able to
recognise things that look like faces.

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.799
What I'd like you to do very quickly guys,
with your partner is

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:25.049
discuss why do you think that as humans

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:27.900
we are so good at recognising things like
faces

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.529
and why would that be important.

00:03:29.529 --> 00:03:31.430
Just discuss it with each other.

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.730
Using what you have learned from the investigation,
it can be nice to wrap up with discussions

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.489
around why we are so good at finding faces.

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:43.609
For example the importance of
being able to recognise friends and family.

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:47.319
As a fun addition to the main activity
you can build on what you've learned

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:50.690
by printing off or drawing some cartoon eyes
and

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.200
sticking them on objects around your home.

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.640
This should help reiterate how
important eyes are for recognising faces.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.799
The kids have had an absolutely brilliant
time today.

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:05.950
If you've enjoyed this video and would like
to try the activities for yourself at home

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.939

website
