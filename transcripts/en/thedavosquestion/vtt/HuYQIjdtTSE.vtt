00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:07.160
&gt;&gt;The world is going through a financial crisis.
It is challenging.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.770
It is difficult.
There is a lot of competition for finances.

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:14.900
And democracies where people have to agree
on allocating of funds, it

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:20.739
is a challenge to be able to dedicate money
to alleviate poverty in our

00:00:20.739 --> 00:00:23.779
world.
I understand that challenge very well.

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:26.849
I also understand that the World Bank and
other institutions around the

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.329
world have done great work over the years
with the support of many

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:33.670
countries.
Making sure that we help the poor, make sure

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.980
that people have access to
clean water, have access to food, have access

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.339
to basic necessities that
we take for granted around the world.

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:43.710
And think this is an opportune time for all
of us to remember through

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.300
these challenging times that there are millions
of people out there

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.370
that need our help, need our support, and
we should all make sure that

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.649
we dedicate enough resources so that we don't
forget the poor.

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:58.489
We don't lose out on the investment that was
made in the years past.

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.210
It is very important, very critical for
all of us to make sure this

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.610
message goes out to everyone.
We all want to make sure that whatever little

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.549
we have to give to ensure
people's access to water, to people's access

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.790
to education, in order to
create even new consumers around the world

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.750
through economic development
is a challenge that we all feel is part of

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.310
our duty.
