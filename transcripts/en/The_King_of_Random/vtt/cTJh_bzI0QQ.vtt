00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.120
Hey guys, I'm Nate welcome back to the king of random today

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.729
We're going to be trying out something a little bit different in that this whole video is going to be  one

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:15.089
Take. We're going to show you an experiment from start to finish, without cutting the camera to several different angles

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:21.689
We wanted to try this because, it gives you a better sense of what it's like to really do an experiment in real time

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:26.279
Unfortunately, that does mean that when I garbled my words our trip over something

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:30.299
We're gonna leave that video footage in hopefully there won't be too much of that

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:37.679
Not too long ago, we had a video where we showed you taking lithium batteries and lighting them on fire

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.840
They kind of exploded and then  burned with a really bright magenta flame

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:50.430
And it looked really cool a few people commented pointing out that we should try taking that same lithium and dropping it into some water

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.509
That's what we're gonna try today because lithium should react with water and

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:57.569
Hopefully we'll get that same bright pink flame

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:02.669
Now as a first test. I have a strip of lithium that I've already taken out of a battery

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.129
And I'm just gonna try lighting it on fire with a blowtorch

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:13.199
Check out our setup, we've got here, we're gonna take one battery will show you taking the lithium out of that one

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.939
We've got these three batteries. Which are already partially open, but not completely and

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.519
We'll be removing the lithium from those

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:32.468
Have here some lithium that I've already taken out of one of the batteries and now we're gonna try lighting that on fire with a

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:35.229
Blowtorch and see if we can get that pink flame. We're looking for

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.560
Let's come over to a slightly drier spot

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:44.409
I don't want to put it down on the water because as this experiment may indicate it should react with water

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.200
Here's a dry spot

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.020
Get the blowtorch working

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:52.719
Glasses on

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.650
Wow!

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.628
There we have it a fairly exciting and almost violent reaction.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.789
That may have even put a little divot in the concrete pad. That's pretty exciting

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.690
So now let's look at how we get that lithium.

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:28.220
I have here a an ultimate lithium battery, and you have to have the ultimate lithium kind

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.269
Or it's something else entirely different inside, so let's take a look at opening one of these up

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.880
It's just a piece of plastic sheeting around the outside

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:51.349
I'm using our wire cutters to undo the crimped metal holding the top of this battery on

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.420
There we go this little top piece pops right off

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.459
Now we kind of need to peel this

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.480
Kind of like we're opening a weird-shaped tiny little metal pan

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.740
Now we can see what's inside of our lithium battery here, it's a roll of

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.339
Some plastic a couple kinds of metal and some chemicals

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.109
But different parts of metal or attach to the positive and negative ends of the battery

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:50.110
Let's see if we can pull this whole roll out

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.610
Not really sure what the best way to do this is

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.170
Open up the casing a little more still

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.729
This is the part we usually just edit right out of the videos

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.500
Because it's not very exciting to watch

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.649
But as I said the point is to really see what it's like to do an experiment in real time

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.689
Sometimes it's not super smooth there we go

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:36.229
So now we have a

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.690
Tab that's part of what connects the metal strips inside to the housing

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.189
We can set down my tools here

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:53.149
Now we can start to unroll this and just trying to make sure my hands are dry so I don't start

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:55.789
Setting anything off as I unroll it

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.190
We've got two strips in here

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.710
This one back here is our lithium and

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:10.430
I'm not 100% sure what this one is honestly, but it smells kind of like rotten eggs

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:12.430
So it might have sulfur on it or something

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:21.170
All right now the whole video is going to be one take until after I've said my finished closing bit

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:23.170
And then we're going to show you some other

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:28.249
Slow-mo behind-the-scenes footage kind of so our cameraman is going to get those cameras started now

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.700
And then I'm going to drop this lithium strip into our bowl of water

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.680
Alright here goes

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:49.460
Lithium in a bowl of water

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:58.789
Boom pink flame and orange flame and lots of smoke

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:10.460
Beautiful that reacted so quickly - ooh, and then it popped

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:19.879
Wow I think that actually started melting the glass on my bowl holy cow

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:27.679
Check this out like there is a rough patch here, and I it it could just be something built up on the surface

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.640
But I'm pretty sure

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:32.029
That started etching down into the glass

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:38.779
That's crazy. Well. I've got some other batteries already torn open. Oh that broke the glass

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:42.639
Well that's exciting

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:49.870
That's not even the part where oh there. We go it started over here. Where it had heated it up and

00:06:50.599 --> 00:06:54.908
Then it just cracked all the way along here and opened that up down there

00:06:55.759 --> 00:07:00.128
Well, that's the kind of thing that would usually be thrown into random happens at the end of the video

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.360
Well the bowls already broken

00:07:04.969 --> 00:07:06.969
But I've still got a couple of batteries

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.360
Probably don't want to let those get wet

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:13.150
Actually, let's uh try tossing one of those in

00:07:13.969 --> 00:07:16.989
See what happens this could be stupid to me

00:07:18.499 --> 00:07:19.509
Well it's in the bowl

00:07:19.509 --> 00:07:25.748
it's gonna try and unwrap one more and throw it into what's left of my bowl most of my bowl is gone, but

00:07:26.599 --> 00:07:28.599
It's still holding some water

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:48.340
There it is

00:07:56.860 --> 00:08:02.939
There's the edge gloves are all wet so I'm a little nervous about touching this

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:17.699
All right, there's our lithium bundling it up. You don't wanna start those cameras again, or should I just throw it in

00:08:19.809 --> 00:08:21.838
All right, I'm just gonna throw it in here we go

00:08:24.399 --> 00:08:26.399
And it ignites again whoo

00:08:34.990 --> 00:08:38.159
There's a bright little burning ball of metal in the water

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:48.079
Very cool well our battery that I just threw in there seems to be corroding a little bit

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:53.959
But it doesn't look like it's actually going to go very far. It is wrapped up in other pieces of metal and

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:57.469
in some paper and whatever the other chemicals are in there, but

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:06.619
There's a chunk of our reactive lithium, you know are still very much broken and ruined bolt these things happen

00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:13.159
Bowls aren't too expensive for you, but there you go lithium torn out of a lithium battery

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:19.760
Stripped of its other wrappings and whatever else is around it crumpled up a little bit and then drop into water

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:26.689
It ignites beautifully it has that super bright pink and orange glow to it. It's really cool

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:28.690
it's a very fun color and

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:35.119
Overall this is a pretty fun and easy experiment and you can see exactly how long it took you know

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.560
It's not that easy to open the batteries

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:41.570
That was the biggest delay is watching you slowly peel back the metal shell of the battery not exciting

00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:44.869
I know
But hopefully we made up for it by showing you how it's saying

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:51.800
how exciting it is to drop our lithium right into water that really burst into flames very entertaining Lee and

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:56.150
Obviously gets really hot hot enough that it melted the side of the bowl

00:09:56.970 --> 00:10:00.079
which thing cracked and is now worthless next it's run away, but

00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:06.739
it's a cool experiment, and I'm glad that some people commented in the other video that we should try this out and

00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:10.069
It way it was fun. It's really fun to do

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:12.770
I'm not saying that you should do this at home

00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:20.749
But if you do do at home you know try to be very careful very well ventilated area a little too much ventilation today

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:26.629
Honestly wearing gloves is wearing long sleeves as wearing glasses. Just be extremely careful. If you do anything like this

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:28.800
Thank you for joining us for this video today

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:33.079
Remember to come gear yourself up with products and merch at the king of random column. See you there

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:36.480
Less crumpled-up, let's see if it still lights on fire

00:10:41.079 --> 00:10:46.679
Hmm not so much this random happens, it's a different cut I know
