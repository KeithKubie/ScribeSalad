SPEAKER: Hello, everyone.

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:06.470
Welcome to another episode of
our Google investing talks.

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:08.720
Today we have a very special
guest with us here today.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.340
His name is Arnold Van Den Berg.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.130
Arnold is a Chairman and CEO
of Century Capital Management,

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:18.120
which he founded in 1974.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.830
Born in 1939,
Arnold Van Den Berg

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:23.920
survived the Holocaust
as one of Holland's

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.210
hidden Jewish children.

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.340
His parents both
survived Auschwitz,

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.500
and the family immigrated
to America when he was 10.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.960
These struggles led him
to an extensive journey

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.800
and study of things like
investing, as well as things

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.870
like consciousness and
the subconscious mind,

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.150
which he believes is the key
to unlocking an individual's

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.120
potential.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.850
There is a quote that is
often attributed to Einstein.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.010
It goes something like this.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.440
"Don't let your schooling
interfere with your education."

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.430
And Arnold, it seems,
he took it to heart.

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.180
He has no formal
college education.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.610
It is through years of hard
self-study, dedication,

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.750
and more than 45 years
of industry experience

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.510
that he has gained
his market knowledge.

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.450
Prior to starting
Century Management,

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.490
he worked as a financial
advisor for Capital Securities

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.520
and John Hancock Insurance.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.700
We are so delighted to
have him here in person

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.890
to share his
experiential wisdom,

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.180
not just about investing,
but also about life.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.190
So without further ado,
ladies and gentlemen,

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.030
please join me in welcoming
Arnold Van Den Berg.

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.030
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:48.450
ARNOLD VAN DEN BERG: I will
start with where I was born.

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.490
I was born in Amsterdam, Holland
during the Nazi occupation

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:52.670
of Holland.

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.640
And if you look at
the Google Map there,

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.800
you can see where we lived.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.100
We lived right down the
street from Anne Frank,

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.080
and some of you might
have heard her story.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.400
Our family story was
very much like her.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.169
My folks were hidden for
about two and a half years

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:13.730
in an attic, and they
developed one major problem.

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.790
The problem was that
when you're hiding

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.580
with two small children-- I
was two and a half years old,

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.750
my brother was five and a
half-- it was difficult to go

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.510
into hiding with them.

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.700
But there was a bigger
problem, and my parents

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.960
had to make a very
difficult choice.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.610
If they kept the children with
them and they were caught,

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.070
they would be sent to Auschwitz,
which they eventually were.

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:42.530
But in Auschwitz, they didn't
keep women and children.

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.690
The minute a woman and children
would come, the first day,

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:46.850
they would gas them.

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.000
So it was a big risk.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.900
If the children were
caught with the parents,

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.810
it usually meant the
end of the parents.

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.380
And the other
alternative on the choice

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:04.850
was to send us to the German
lines in an orphanage.

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.010
And the orphanage, in order
to get that orphanage,

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.070
you had to take a train.

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.970
And the problem with the train
is they check your passport.

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.940
We, being Jewish,
didn't have passports,

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.540
and so they had to
make a fake passport.

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.620
But the fake passport
wasn't very good,

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:19.810
so it was a big risk.

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.040
It was just like the
worst-case situation.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.140
So anyway, my folks got
together with the underground,

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.450
the Dutch underground,
and they worked out

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.540
a plan where a 19-year-old girl
would take me on the train,

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.970
and then in front of her
would be an individual who

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.390
would try to keep the Nazi
officer who came on the train

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.870
to do the passports, keep him on
the train there, keep him busy

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.990
until the whistle blew
and then the officer had

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:48.560
to get off the train.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.720
So we got on the train.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.570
The officer came on.

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:54.660
The gentleman stood
up, kept him busy.

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.660
All of a sudden,
the whistle blew.

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.600
And as I spoke to this
woman after the war,

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.560
she says it was just the
most dramatic moment.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.890
When the whistle blew, she
knew she was going to be OK.

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.160
So anyway, she got
me to the orphanage

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.580
where I was there from
about two and a half to six.

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.740
And then eventually,
my parents were

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:19.100
turned in by people in Holland
who did favors for the Germans,

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.980
and they got extra
food rations for that.

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:25.960
But the thing that
really got me is

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:31.400
the fact that this girl
risked her life to save me,

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.390
and somebody she
didn't even know.

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:35.710
By the way, that is
my family up there.

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.100
I'm in the middle.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.000
And we are the
only survivors out

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.330
the 39 people that were
living before the war.

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:49.140
Anyway, the thing that as I
grew up I really struggled with

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:53.360
is, how could this young
girl risk her life for me?

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.780
She didn't even know me.

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.320
And how could her
whole family risk

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.720
their lives-- they were
hiding Jews and moving them

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.020
back and forth.

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.240
And the father would send his
19-year-old girl on a mission

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.340
that she could end up
in a concentration camp.

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.050
So I thought about
that for many years.

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.630
I tried to figure out, what
would motivate somebody

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.170
to do that?

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:15.980
And the more I thought about it,
I just didn't have an answer.

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:20.180
Well, as I got older, I
developed some problems.

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.180
I have a big anger problem.

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.700
I went through
years of depression.

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.050
And I finally went to
see a psychiatrist who

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.780
helped me a great deal.

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:31.599
And then as I was
thinking about it,

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:33.140
I thought, well,
I'm going to ask him

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:34.140
what he thinks about it.

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:37.230
And I thought a long
dissertation on this.

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:39.730
And he says, oh,
that's very simple.

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:40.630
I said, really?

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:41.820
He says, sure.

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.340
He said, it's all
about principles.

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:47.530
He says, these were people
who were deep Christians,

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:50.580
they had a big belief
in their religion,

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.370
and their principles were more
important than their life.

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:55.550
And he says, so
the way it works is

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:58.730
if you have principles that are
more important than your life,

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:00.570
you sacrifice your life.

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:03.080
If your life is more important
than your principles,

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.200
you sacrifice your principles.

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:08.610
And that is true
not only in life

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:11.110
where you have to sacrifice
your life, but also in business

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:12.610
where you have to
make choices that

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:15.480
sometimes cause sacrifices.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:19.100
But anyway, I just want
to make this one point

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:23.100
about the principles that
really influenced my life.

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.750
Here on one side, you
had people who were

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:27.690
willing to risk their life.

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:29.990
And the other side, you had
people who would turn you

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:31.940
in for an extra food ration.

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:32.870
So just think.

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:37.070
Same people, same situation,
same circumstances.

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:40.390
One of them did this noble
thing that risked their life.

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:42.420
The other ones were
willing to turn

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:45.580
in for a matter of
an extra food ration.

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:49.890
So that really got me to
thinking how crucial in life

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:52.020
it was to have the
right principle,

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:56.330
to have something that really
was a compass that guided you.

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:59.330
And so I started
thinking about it.

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.490
And I was raised in
Judaism, so I started

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:03.600
studying the Jewish religion.

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:07.930
Studied all the different
ideas, and so forth.

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:10.900
But I wanted to also study the
other religion, and especially

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:11.630
Christianity.

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:14.920
Because these people
took such risks

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:16.860
that I wanted to see
what motivated them.

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:19.260
So I started studying
the religion.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:20.940
The more I studied
the religions,

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:22.170
the more I got confused.

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:24.760
In one side, here the
Jews and the Christians

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:27.320
have been arguing
for 2,000 years.

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:29.610
And so all of a sudden,
I got into the debate.

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:33.020
I would go see a rabbi, talk
to ministers, Bible scholars,

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:34.410
Hebrew scholars.

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:36.060
Went through the whole thing.

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:40.480
And it really started to create
a problem with [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:44.030
And the conflict was,
here I was, raised Jewish.

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:46.770
My parents paid a
great price to be Jews.

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:49.170
And here, there were
things about Christianity,

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:52.060
there were principles
that I really liked.

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:58.130
And so one day, I was sitting
by myself, studying away.

00:07:58.130 --> 00:07:59.955
And I thought, jeez.

00:07:59.955 --> 00:08:02.350
How am I going to
reconcile this?

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:05.210
And all of a sudden, a voice
flashed through my mind.

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:06.770
It just-- not a voice.

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:08.790
A thought flashed
through my mind

00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:12.030
and said, if you want
to seek the truth,

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:14.930
you have to go
wherever it leads you.

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:16.610
And I thought about
that for a moment,

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:19.540
and I thought, you
know, that's right.

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:22.956
And the minute I thought about
that, I just felt so relieved.

00:08:22.956 --> 00:08:24.860
I completely felt free.

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:28.610
I just knew now that one
of my core principles

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:32.240
would be that irrespective
of what I was studying, what

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:35.270
I was looking for, I was
going to seek the truth,

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:37.630
and that was going to be
the guiding principle.

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:39.429
Completely relieved me.

00:08:39.429 --> 00:08:42.520
This way, I went in and studied
all the different religions.

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:44.970
I learned a great
deal from all of them.

00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:46.740
And all of these
different things

00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:50.000
have led me to the
principles that I believe in.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.110
Well, it didn't take long
to test those principles.

00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:57.510
After I graduated out of high
school, I worked a few jobs,

00:08:57.510 --> 00:08:59.680
and I got into the
insurance business.

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:02.770
And so I was very excited
about the insurance business.

00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:04.490
I thought it was a
way to help people

00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:07.170
and to create my own business.

00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:08.830
Everything was going fine.

00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:10.730
And then the more I
studied the business,

00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:13.285
the more I saw that
certain products

00:09:13.285 --> 00:09:17.240
that the company pushed
cost a lot of money,

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:21.250
had high commissions, but wasn't
necessarily the right product

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:22.850
for most people.

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:25.920
And the products that
I liked were very low

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:29.500
cost, gave the most
for the insurance,

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:32.420
also paid the least commission.

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:34.120
And so I figured, OK.

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:35.470
I believe in this thing.

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:38.100
I'm going to sell the
products that I believe in.

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:40.090
Well, after a few
years of selling that,

00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:43.910
it's pretty hard to make money
at these low-cost products,

00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:46.440
even though they were the best.

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:50.080
But I continue to do it because
I had developed the principles

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:52.280
that no matter
what it was, I was

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:54.100
going to do the right thing.

00:09:54.100 --> 00:09:57.670
So one day after driving
all the way across town,

00:09:57.670 --> 00:10:01.360
I come back to the office
about 9 o'clock at night.

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:04.710
Barely made enough money to
pay for my gas, let alone

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:08.621
the hours it took to drive
back and forth, and so forth.

00:10:08.621 --> 00:10:10.120
And I come into the
office, and they

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:14.670
had sort of a honorary
thing where they honored

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:17.250
the top person of the month.

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:20.400
And the guy who got
the top of the month

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:24.020
was the guy who had the least
ethics in the whole company.

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:28.310
And so I thought to myself, how
could this great company honor

00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:32.050
this guy when everybody
pretty kind of knows

00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:33.970
the kind of situation he was in?

00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:35.959
And I was just shocked by it.

00:10:35.959 --> 00:10:37.750
I won't tell you what
I did to the picture.

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:42.260
But anyway, the
next day I walked

00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:45.240
into the supervisor's
office and I said,

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:46.680
let me ask you a question.

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:49.950
You know the ethics
of this guy, right?

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:53.120
How could you make
him the top man?

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:56.496
He says well, Arnie, you've
never owned a business.

00:10:56.496 --> 00:11:00.640
But I'm running a business,
and I've got overhead.

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:03.390
And so I need to
make my overhead.

00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:06.640
Because otherwise, we
don't have a business,

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:09.061
and you don't have a job.

00:11:09.061 --> 00:11:12.120
I just looked at him,
and I thought, well,

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:14.030
this is not the
right place for me.

00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:16.730
I've got to leave this.

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:18.670
Well, that was
kind of a conflict

00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:21.590
it created, because I'd
worked for three years,

00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:25.080
and I'd built up these renewals,
which was part of our income.

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:27.910
And now I was going to
forfeit my renewals,

00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:30.430
and I was also going
to forfeit my income.

00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:33.220
And so basically, I was
going to be out a job.

00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:35.840
But fortunately,
and in some ways

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:38.780
unfortunately, the
company had started

00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:40.840
to go into mutual funds.

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:42.810
And I had started
studying mutual funds.

00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:44.857
I was very excited about it.

00:11:44.857 --> 00:11:46.440
And so I thought,
well, you know what?

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:48.390
I'm just going to
leave the company

00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:51.730
and just make the mutual fund
the primary business, because I

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:54.400
was very excited about
what was going on.

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:57.290
So anyway, I thought about
that, struggled with that,

00:11:57.290 --> 00:12:01.000
and the principles said, it's
obvious what you have to do.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.210
So I started in the
mutual fund, and that

00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:09.450
is the point where I said
fortunately and unfortunately.

00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:12.750
Because at the time I left
the insurance business

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:16.950
and went into the mutual funds,
the market was six months away

00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:19.690
from making an all-time high.

00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:22.840
The market had been in a
bull market for 20 years.

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:25.050
It had just gone way up.

00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:28.670
The enthusiasm was
just unbelievable.

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:31.080
And just to show you
what was going on,

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:33.720
this is an article out
of "Barron's" magazine

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:35.290
at the top of the market.

00:12:35.290 --> 00:12:37.770
And they said, here's
all the top money

00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:41.060
managers, the people I
used to go watch and sell

00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:45.700
their mutual funds, and there
was not a bear among them.

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:49.530
In other words, the
enthusiasm was so high

00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:54.350
that no money manager in
the country was bearish.

00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:57.890
The inflation rate was down,
the interest rates were down.

00:12:57.890 --> 00:13:01.840
But an important fundamental
that they seemed to overlook--

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:04.560
and I didn't have a clue
of what was going on--

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:06.660
and it turns out,
they didn't either,

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:10.390
because the market
eventually went down 45%,

00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:14.580
the average stock went down
75%, and my mutual fund

00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:17.040
started falling apart.

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:21.440
So this was the beginning of
my career in the stock market.

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:25.140
And so as the market
started going down and down,

00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:27.600
and the funds kept
going down and down,

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:29.750
it was just very discouraging.

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:31.820
And I didn't have
the understanding

00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:34.410
of how the market worked
or the evaluation of what

00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:36.520
a company was worth, and so on.

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:39.910
And so it was just kind of like
the market kept going down,

00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:42.530
because there was no
way I could evaluate it.

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:45.500
Anyway, I decided I
was going to study it

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:47.520
and to figure out
what was going on.

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:51.490
In the meantime, the market went
down for a total of six years.

00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:56.410
Now there was one year that it
had bottomed in June of '70,

00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:59.050
and it rallied for
about a year and a half.

00:13:59.050 --> 00:14:02.740
And then it came crashing
down from '72 to '74.

00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:06.100
So as the market was going
down and I was studying it,

00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:08.980
I started to notice a pattern.

00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:12.280
And the pattern was
that certain funds

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:14.850
did much better than others.

00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:17.320
It's not that they went
up on a down market,

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:19.930
but they were going down,
but they weren't going down

00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:22.970
as much, and they reacted
better when the market rallied.

00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:25.410
And I could see a
noticeable difference.

00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:29.170
So I started studying those
funds, and I thought to myself,

00:14:29.170 --> 00:14:31.130
I'm going to find out
why it's different.

00:14:31.130 --> 00:14:34.070
And so I called the
managers and I talked

00:14:34.070 --> 00:14:35.890
to the other people involved.

00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:38.330
And I finally concluded
that the people

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:40.750
who were following
the value investors

00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:44.600
seemed to be doing better
in this extreme downturn.

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:45.810
So that got me interested.

00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:48.830
I thought, well, maybe
that's the better philosophy.

00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:53.270
So I talked to different
managers, I read the material.

00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:55.340
And so all of a
sudden as you start

00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:57.450
reading about value
investing, you

00:14:57.450 --> 00:15:01.360
can't help but learn
about Benjamin Graham, who

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:03.260
was the father of
security analysis,

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:07.250
who basically developed
that value situation,

00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:11.030
and whose prize student
was Warren Buffett.

00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:13.320
So as I started
studying it, one day

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:17.290
I met a value investor who
had been very successful, very

00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:19.250
knowledgeable about it.

00:15:19.250 --> 00:15:21.440
And he said to me, you
know, Arnie-- we were having

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:24.680
dinner one night-- he says,
when you really break it down,

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:28.460
the secret of understanding
an individual stock

00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:30.707
is to first of all figure
out what it's worth.

00:15:30.707 --> 00:15:32.290
It's just like a
piece of real estate.

00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:36.350
You call into brokers,
they do similar studies,

00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:39.410
and you figure out your
square footage, the land,

00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:40.095
and so forth.

00:15:40.095 --> 00:15:41.470
And so you take
the fundamentals,

00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:44.010
and you learn about the company.

00:15:44.010 --> 00:15:45.950
And then the most
important thing,

00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:48.110
and the only time
you get to do that,

00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:50.730
is when the market is down.

00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:54.060
Benjamin Graham described the
market as a manic depressive.

00:15:54.060 --> 00:15:57.110
So when it's down, I bought
it in the manic state.

00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:59.550
But when it gets depressed,
you get an opportunity

00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:02.150
to buy it at a discount.

00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:05.620
He said, basically,
you buy wholesale.

00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:09.030
Well, that rang a bell with
me because all my life,

00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:11.920
my mom was a tremendous
businesswoman.

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:16.560
She ran my dad's business
before the war, after the war,

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:19.410
and she was just amazing.

00:16:19.410 --> 00:16:23.160
She always used to say, whenever
I buy something, Arnold,

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:25.660
you have to buy wholesale.

00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:27.180
So I always remember.

00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:28.070
It stuck in my mind.

00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:30.140
So when this value
investor told me

00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:32.900
that the secret to buying a
stock is to buy it wholesale

00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:37.320
or at a discount, I thought, now
I have found the right thing.

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:39.450
This is for me.

00:16:39.450 --> 00:16:45.040
So I thought to myself, one
day, I bought a sweater.

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:46.420
And I walk in to
my mom and said,

00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:47.880
Mom, how do you like my sweater?

00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:49.600
She says, oy, it's beautiful.

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:51.440
Did you buy it wholesale?

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:55.540
I said, Mom, you can't go into
a Bullock's and buy one sweater

00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:56.840
and expect to get it wholesale.

00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:58.340
She goes, nah.

00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:00.070
She was not pleased
with the answer.

00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:01.810
But I got the idea.

00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:05.250
That was studying
the value investor

00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:07.089
was the way I was going to go.

00:17:07.089 --> 00:17:09.010
So now I had the
principles set up,

00:17:09.010 --> 00:17:10.920
but now I needed the philosophy.

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:11.740
So I said, OK.

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:16.810
I'm going to do everything
I can to do this philosophy.

00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:19.700
And I used to be an athlete.

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:22.160
And one of the things you
learn about athletics,

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:23.760
you've got to be
dedicated, focused.

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:25.420
You never skip practice.

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:28.560
So I set up a program to
learn value investing.

00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:31.400
And I sat up-- I'm not
going out during the nights.

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:32.320
I'm not going to date.

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:33.770
I was single at the time.

00:17:33.770 --> 00:17:35.650
I'm just going to
focus on learning

00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:37.790
the value school of investing.

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:40.520
And I had all the books
lined up and all the pages

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:41.350
I had to read.

00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:42.940
And every night, I
would chalk it off,

00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:45.620
and I was making real progress.

00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:50.210
Well, then I met this girl,
and we got along real well.

00:17:50.210 --> 00:17:53.690
And she said to me, why don't
you come over Wednesday night?

00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:55.900
I'll cook you a dinner
and we'll hang out.

00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:58.290
And I said, oh, no.

00:17:58.290 --> 00:18:00.460
I said, I've got to study.

00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:02.506
And she said, really?

00:18:02.506 --> 00:18:04.130
I didn't know you
were going to school.

00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:04.540
And I said, no.

00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:05.539
I'm not going to school.

00:18:05.539 --> 00:18:06.307
I'm just studying.

00:18:06.307 --> 00:18:07.890
She said, are you
studying for a test?

00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:11.627
I said, no, I'm just studying
on my self-study program.

00:18:11.627 --> 00:18:13.210
She looked at me
kind of funny and she

00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:17.130
says, what are you doing,
studying to be a monk?

00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:20.510
So the point I'm making is
that I was very focused on it.

00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:24.560
Now what this young girl
didn't understand at the time

00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:28.930
is that the most important thing
in achieving anything in life

00:18:28.930 --> 00:18:30.560
is to be totally focused.

00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:32.810
I learned that as
an athlete, but I

00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:34.750
want to give you an
analogy which even

00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:37.130
drives that point [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:40.370
My dad was explaining to me
what was going on in Auschwitz

00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:42.900
in the concentration camp.

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:46.540
He said to me, you know the
most difficult thing that I ever

00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:48.550
experienced in my
life, and especially

00:18:48.550 --> 00:18:51.060
in the concentration
camp, is that when

00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:52.780
I went on the death march.

00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:54.790
And the death march
was a situation

00:18:54.790 --> 00:18:57.860
where you had to go from
Auschwitz to another camp.

00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:01.420
The camp was 60 kilometers,
which is about 20 miles.

00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:03.560
He was about 85 pounds.

00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:06.270
I'm 5'8", 160 pounds.

00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:09.690
He was 5'7", and
he was 85 pounds.

00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:11.170
So he was all skin and bones.

00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:12.510
Everybody was.

00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:14.260
So they started off
in the death march.

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:16.020
You get two slices
of bread, and you

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:19.430
march for 24 hours
in subzero weather.

00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:22.090
The snow was halfway
up to your knees.

00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:25.170
And your knees
started to buckle.

00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:27.510
You would get so
tired you'd fall down.

00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:29.380
They put a rifle
butt on your back,

00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:32.110
or they whipped you till
you got up and got going.

00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:34.740
Or if you didn't go,
they'd just shoot you.

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:38.630
So he said the key was
that he had to really focus

00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:41.420
his mind to be able to
get through that kind

00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:43.470
of a situation.

00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:46.970
And he said, what I learned
by going through this death

00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:51.380
march was just incredible,
how powerful the mind is.

00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:54.770
And he said, you would never
know how powerful it was

00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:56.320
until you were tested to do it.

00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:59.150
I could never do this
without having to do it

00:19:59.150 --> 00:20:01.080
when your life's on the line.

00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:04.920
So he said, what I learned to
do is, he says, you take a step,

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:07.359
but you lock your knee
so you don't fall down,

00:20:07.359 --> 00:20:08.400
because you're too tired.

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:09.780
You're going to fall down.

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:13.362
And he says, you had to
completely clear your mind.

00:20:13.362 --> 00:20:15.570
He said, you couldn't think
about how tired you were.

00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:18.600
You couldn't think about
how hungry you were.

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:20.420
You couldn't think
about how cold you were.

00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:23.370
You couldn't think about
pain from the cold.

00:20:23.370 --> 00:20:25.590
You could think
about nothing else.

00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:30.150
Nothing should enter your
mind but to move that leg.

00:20:30.150 --> 00:20:32.860
And he said, every
time I moved the leg,

00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:35.430
I really didn't think
I could do another one.

00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:39.210
But by focusing on it, I
just moved the leg again.

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:43.530
And throughout the 24
hours, I kept that focus.

00:20:43.530 --> 00:20:47.230
And all of a sudden he says,
you realize you get a strength

00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:51.634
that you don't even understand,
and you're able to keep going.

00:20:51.634 --> 00:20:53.550
And I said, well, what
do you attribute it to?

00:20:53.550 --> 00:20:56.290
He says, it has to be part
of the subconscious mind.

00:20:56.290 --> 00:20:58.560
He says, I don't have
the answer to it.

00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:00.600
But I can tell you this.

00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:03.170
There is no way you
could ever do it

00:21:03.170 --> 00:21:05.680
without that extreme focus.

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:07.000
So that's the key.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.700
And so I wanted to point that
out to you, because that became

00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:13.730
a focal part of my program.

00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:17.610
And so as I started studying
the [INAUDIBLE] philosophy

00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:22.150
and the value investing, as I
started learning these things,

00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:24.120
I made that the complete focus.

00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:27.140
That whatever you go
in, you focus that.

00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:29.450
And of course, I
studied hypnosis,

00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:31.590
which is a good way to
influence the subconscious

00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:33.970
mind and any other
different program.

00:21:33.970 --> 00:21:36.610
But I wanted to leave that
with you, because we all

00:21:36.610 --> 00:21:40.130
have an energy and
a power within us

00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:41.980
that we don't even realize.

00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:45.020
And it's just truly,
truly extraordinary.

00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:47.470
Anyway, I started my business.

00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:51.860
And I'm going to show you the
difference in contrary opinion.

00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:55.770
At the top of the
market when I got in,

00:21:55.770 --> 00:21:59.390
everybody was wildly
bullish, and the market

00:21:59.390 --> 00:22:01.550
was at 20 times earnings.

00:22:01.550 --> 00:22:05.380
And now we are with the
market coming down six years,

00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:08.280
and it was a real struggle
just to hang in there.

00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:10.486
But I remembered the
lesson that I learned,

00:22:10.486 --> 00:22:13.325
and I just knew that if I
had the right philosophy

00:22:13.325 --> 00:22:16.180
and I kept going,
things will work out.

00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:20.260
Well, I got so excited
about the value investing

00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:23.640
that I realized when I studied
the multiples-- the multiples

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:26.300
at that time, you won't
believe it, were at about an

00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:28.545
18, 19 multiple in the market.

00:22:28.545 --> 00:22:32.440
The average stock was selling
at three to five times earnings,

00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:35.690
and the big cap stocks were
about eight times earnings.

00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:38.590
And they were bargain
6%, 7% dividends.

00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:41.470
It was just incredible bargains.

00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:44.090
And the more I studied
the value philosophy,

00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:46.810
the more I realized
that we were truly

00:22:46.810 --> 00:22:50.130
at an extraordinary
time in history

00:22:50.130 --> 00:22:53.320
where the market had never been
that cheap, except going back

00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:55.120
to the '29 depression.

00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:57.740
So here we were,
30, 40 years later,

00:22:57.740 --> 00:22:59.350
and this was the
cheapest market.

00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:01.720
The only problem is I
didn't have many clients.

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:05.170
I wasn't making any
money, and each month, I'd

00:23:05.170 --> 00:23:06.320
get deeper in debt.

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:11.440
But I had the faith that if this
was truly the historical time,

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:13.950
that eventually
things would change.

00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:15.990
So then one day, I
come into the office.

00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:20.440
And then I see this new article,
the cover of "BusinessWeek."

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:23.110
They had all the
sophisticated reasons

00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:27.660
why the market was going to stay
down for the next few years.

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:29.720
Didn't have many
opportunities, and they called

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:30.920
it the "Death of Equities."

00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:33.980
So here at the peak of
the market at 20 times,

00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:36.850
everybody was bullish,
including the money managers.

00:23:36.850 --> 00:23:39.360
Now we're at the
bottom of the market,

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:41.010
and they come out
with this article,

00:23:41.010 --> 00:23:42.490
the "Death of Equities."

00:23:42.490 --> 00:23:43.740
Everybody was bearish.

00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:48.020
You couldn't talk to anybody
about stocks to save your life.

00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:50.260
There was one person
who was bullish,

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:52.040
and that was Warren Buffett.

00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:54.520
And he wrote an article or he
was interviewed in "Forbes"

00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:55.860
in December of '74.

00:23:55.860 --> 00:23:57.014
I'll never forget it.

00:23:57.014 --> 00:23:59.180
And the only thing I remember
about the article that

00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:02.044
stuck in my mind,
they were asking him,

00:24:02.044 --> 00:24:03.460
what do you think
what's going on?

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:05.090
The inflation and all of this?

00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:06.580
He says, look.

00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:11.560
He said, if you're worried
about recession or depression

00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:14.540
at these prices, I'm
not worried about it.

00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:18.006
He says, this is the time
to invest and get rich.

00:24:18.006 --> 00:24:19.620
And boy, that's what we did.

00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:23.090
And six months later,
the market took off

00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:26.350
into one of the biggest bull
markets that ever happened.

00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:31.410
The Dow went from about 800
to 18,000, where it is today.

00:24:31.410 --> 00:24:35.930
So that taught me a lot, going
through that market cycle.

00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:39.190
If you ever want to really
learn value investing,

00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:41.505
you learn it going
in a down market,

00:24:41.505 --> 00:24:44.490
and you understand
what value is,

00:24:44.490 --> 00:24:47.480
and how value eventually
might go down,

00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:48.990
but it'll eventually come down.

00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:52.800
And some of the things that
are not valued never come back.

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:55.760
So that's an important
part of the philosophy.

00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:58.990
So as I was reflecting
over the time

00:24:58.990 --> 00:25:03.400
that I'd been in business--
and it's been 48 years now--

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:05.070
I wanted to share
with you something

00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:07.890
that would help you avoid
some of the mistakes

00:25:07.890 --> 00:25:10.420
that we might have made
and some of the stocks

00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:12.710
that didn't work out
as well, and so forth.

00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:14.930
Well, as I looked over
the different ways,

00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:18.110
there's many different
things that can happen.

00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:22.310
But if I looked at one theme
that could help you a lot,

00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:24.980
it's that debt is
one of the biggest

00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:28.200
things against a business,
against an individual,

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:30.330
against countries and worldwide.

00:25:30.330 --> 00:25:33.220
Matter of fact, it's the
biggest problem today.

00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:35.160
So the problem was
that we would get

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:38.130
into stocks that were pretty
good companies at pretty

00:25:38.130 --> 00:25:39.240
decent balance sheets.

00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:42.280
They weren't over-leveraged
when we went in.

00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:44.740
But as they were going
along, they either

00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:47.840
made an acquisition
out of desperation

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:51.080
that didn't work out, or they
overpaid at the wrong time

00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:53.410
when everybody was enthusiastic.

00:25:53.410 --> 00:25:57.220
They developed products that
they didn't have any history

00:25:57.220 --> 00:25:59.225
on, and they spent a
lot of money developing,

00:25:59.225 --> 00:26:01.350
and then the products
didn't go on.

00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:04.750
But most importantly, they
were people who didn't really

00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:07.030
spend most of
their time thinking

00:26:07.030 --> 00:26:10.110
about how to make the business
better, how to cut costs,

00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:11.630
and how to keep going.

00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:14.240
And then when things
started going down,

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:17.530
the mistakes that I
made was that we stayed

00:26:17.530 --> 00:26:19.230
with those companies too long.

00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:20.700
We got to know the management.

00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:22.250
We got to believing in it.

00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:24.030
I'm a big believer in people.

00:26:24.030 --> 00:26:26.920
People is the thing
that change companies,

00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:28.490
can change the world.

00:26:28.490 --> 00:26:30.740
So when you get to
believing in companies

00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:32.560
and then you see
them going along,

00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:35.550
but you see them not doing
what they need to do,

00:26:35.550 --> 00:26:38.770
then you need to cut
your losses and get out.

00:26:38.770 --> 00:26:41.500
So it's important to
understand that debt

00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:44.300
is something that really
takes the options away

00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:45.604
from a company.

00:26:45.604 --> 00:26:47.770
And if there's anything you
could [INAUDIBLE] there,

00:26:47.770 --> 00:26:49.790
when you see them
going the wrong way.

00:26:49.790 --> 00:26:52.470
Usually when companies
make acquisitions,

00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:55.640
unless it's the kind of
company that consistently makes

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:59.190
acquisitions, and they
do it consistently well,

00:26:59.190 --> 00:27:01.850
and they have a history
and an expertise to do it,

00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:03.890
those companies
will do very well.

00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:06.090
But if you see a company
that very rarely makes

00:27:06.090 --> 00:27:08.480
an acquisition, all of a
sudden the business declines,

00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:10.835
and then they hope-- they
throw a life saver out

00:27:10.835 --> 00:27:12.960
to buy another company and
hope things will change,

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:16.460
and then they both start
going down, you get the idea.

00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:19.050
So that is a very
serious problem,

00:27:19.050 --> 00:27:23.600
not only in your personal
life, but also in companies.

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:26.880
And more importantly, let's take
a look at the United States,

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:29.740
because there's a
problem there also.

00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:31.410
And I would say this.

00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:34.140
Whenever people get
into financial trouble,

00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:38.210
it's usually due to the
improper use of debt.

00:27:38.210 --> 00:27:41.370
And when I started Century
Management, the only thing

00:27:41.370 --> 00:27:44.330
I used, an American Express
credit card whenever

00:27:44.330 --> 00:27:46.120
I needed to borrow some money.

00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:48.500
First of all, I didn't
borrow any money.

00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:50.860
Mostly at first, nobody
would have lent me

00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:52.770
any money in their right mind.

00:27:52.770 --> 00:27:55.510
But even as I had the
opportunity to borrow money,

00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:56.820
I never did.

00:27:56.820 --> 00:28:02.440
I either worked it down to where
the cost of revenues met cost,

00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:04.280
or I'd just forego the debt.

00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:08.660
I've never used debt as a
way to finance a company.

00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:12.170
Anyway, if you look
at the United States,

00:28:12.170 --> 00:28:14.550
as great as this
country is-- and I

00:28:14.550 --> 00:28:17.390
wish I could talk more about
how wonderful this country is

00:28:17.390 --> 00:28:20.090
and what a great future
it has, irrespective

00:28:20.090 --> 00:28:21.890
of the temporary problems.

00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:24.080
But one of the things
that concerns me

00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:27.750
is that this country also
uses improper use of debt.

00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:29.730
Now take a look at this chart.

00:28:29.730 --> 00:28:35.835
It took over 200 years to
accumulate $7.9 trillion

00:28:35.835 --> 00:28:36.580
of debt.

00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:37.910
This is debt to GDP.

00:28:37.910 --> 00:28:40.400
It's kind of like debt to sales.

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:44.820
In the last 10 years, we
went from $8 trillion to $19

00:28:44.820 --> 00:28:48.750
trillion, an increase of 140%.

00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:51.490
So obviously, we're
not using debt

00:28:51.490 --> 00:28:54.570
in the proper way
because of the fact

00:28:54.570 --> 00:28:56.630
that we've raised
this much debt,

00:28:56.630 --> 00:28:59.730
and certainly haven't done
anything to cut costs.

00:28:59.730 --> 00:29:02.950
Now the biggest problem
facing people with debt

00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:05.720
is not only debt,
but the debt service.

00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:07.720
So if you look at
this chart, you

00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:11.280
can see that on the current
$19 trillion of debt,

00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:17.040
we're paying $223
billion of debt service.

00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:21.840
We have a budget deficit
of about $438 billion.

00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:26.330
But the deficit on the
government's revenue,

00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:31.740
if you take the deficit to
the revenue, it's about 13.5%.

00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:34.050
Now look what happens
at the 3% line.

00:29:34.050 --> 00:29:38.090
If interest rates were
to go up from 1% to 3%,

00:29:38.090 --> 00:29:41.540
you would be at $616 billion.

00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:44.880
That would give us
a deficit of $831.

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:48.100
And that would mean that
the amount of deficit

00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:51.680
relative to the government's
income would be 30%.

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:54.620
Now there's two rules you
want to apply to a country.

00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:58.670
First of all, it should not
have more than 80% debt to GDP,

00:29:58.670 --> 00:30:02.810
and the deficit should not be
more than 30% of its income.

00:30:02.810 --> 00:30:06.470
Because if it is, what the
central bankers of the world

00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:09.570
and all people who
analyze countries realize,

00:30:09.570 --> 00:30:14.290
that if you've got over
100% or over 80% debt to GDP

00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:18.315
and you've got 30%
deficit on your income,

00:30:18.315 --> 00:30:20.835
if you're spending 30%
more than you're making,

00:30:20.835 --> 00:30:22.210
there's very little
chance you're

00:30:22.210 --> 00:30:24.600
going to be able to
pay that debt back.

00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:29.160
But countries have an option
that we don't, and that is they

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:30.610
can print money.

00:30:30.610 --> 00:30:35.130
Well, what it means is that
if you meet those two ratios,

00:30:35.130 --> 00:30:37.490
eventually, your cost of
your debt's going to go out.

00:30:37.490 --> 00:30:41.140
Because people say, there's
no way out but to print money.

00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:44.700
And in fact, that's what the
government has been doing.

00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:48.070
Now just to show you what the
position of a government is in,

00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:51.200
they basically have an
adjustable rate mortgage.

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:54.400
Because if they were really
doing the right thing right

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:57.350
now, they would sell 30-year
bonds so that they could

00:30:57.350 --> 00:31:00.180
get the 2.5% interest tossed.

00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:02.370
But instead, they're
rolling over short term,

00:31:02.370 --> 00:31:05.070
because the short-term
costs are lower.

00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:09.080
Well, it's just like have
a mortgage, adjustable rate

00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:09.680
mortgage.

00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:14.780
Let's say the mortgage
payment on $500,000 is 2.3%.

00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:17.105
You've got $1,900
a month payment.

00:31:17.105 --> 00:31:22.960
If you go to 5.3%, increase in
3%, the payment goes up 44%.

00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:26.020
So what's going to happen
if interest rates go up,

00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:28.900
you're going to develop
higher interest costs,

00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:30.710
and that's going to
increase the deficit.

00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:34.790
So that is one thing temporarily
that has to be resolved.

00:31:34.790 --> 00:31:37.910
Fortunately, countries can
grow their way out of it

00:31:37.910 --> 00:31:40.960
if we have the right
leadership and management,

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:43.650
but that's the
situation we are today,

00:31:43.650 --> 00:31:46.300
and that is a very
trouble [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:50.130
If you look worldwide, you can
see the same thing going on.

00:31:50.130 --> 00:31:52.240
Everybody's saying, well,
after the recession,

00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:54.190
the world is deleveraging.

00:31:54.190 --> 00:31:55.970
The world is not deleveraging.

00:31:55.970 --> 00:31:57.950
Take a look at these statistics.

00:31:57.950 --> 00:32:00.440
They have gone up every year.

00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:04.080
And so what we've done is
we continue to pile up debt

00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:07.700
on an individual basis,
on a company basis,

00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:10.610
and countrywide and worldwide.

00:32:10.610 --> 00:32:13.780
And that needs to be addressed.

00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:16.772
Now let's take a look at where
we are today in the market.

00:32:16.772 --> 00:32:23.020
I am showing you a chart
that shows the inflation

00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:24.800
rate and the P/E multiple.

00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:28.250
And this is a very important
thing to understand

00:32:28.250 --> 00:32:30.040
and for you to watch for.

00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:32.860
Right now, what is
the contrary opinion?

00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:36.000
Everybody believes that
deflation is the biggest

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.350
problem in the world.

00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:38.890
And it is.

00:32:38.890 --> 00:32:43.510
But at the end of deflation
comes potential inflation.

00:32:43.510 --> 00:32:44.820
And nobody's talking about it.

00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:46.580
Nobody's thinking about it.

00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:49.060
But you need to watch
it, because whatever you

00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:51.660
don't expect usually happens.

00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:54.940
On a contrary opinion basis,
the most contrary opinion

00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:57.050
you can have is that you
can expect inflation.

00:32:57.050 --> 00:32:59.962
Because the Fed has
been trying desperately

00:32:59.962 --> 00:33:00.795
to create inflation.

00:33:00.795 --> 00:33:03.060
They have not been
able to do it.

00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:06.630
So if it does happen,
this is what's

00:33:06.630 --> 00:33:08.080
going to happen to the market.

00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:09.720
So what I am showing
you now-- and I'll

00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:11.900
explain the value line index.

00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:15.680
But I'm using a value
line index for this chart.

00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:19.860
And you can see that we are
in the 1% to 2% inflation.

00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:22.700
That is where we are today.

00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:27.520
And the P/E is around
1770 to 18 times earnings.

00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:30.050
Now here's the sweet spot.

00:33:30.050 --> 00:33:34.050
The sweet spot in
inflation is 2% to 3%.

00:33:34.050 --> 00:33:37.190
So you can see that you get
the highest multiple when

00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:39.090
you've got 2% to 3% inflation.

00:33:39.090 --> 00:33:40.770
Actually, 2.5%.

00:33:40.770 --> 00:33:43.870
And the reason is, that
means the economy is strong,

00:33:43.870 --> 00:33:45.760
everything is going well.

00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:51.180
Interest rates are extremely low
and stock markets are way up.

00:33:51.180 --> 00:33:54.930
So the ideal thing is if
the world comes together

00:33:54.930 --> 00:33:56.790
and we get a little
more inflation, which

00:33:56.790 --> 00:33:59.650
is a good thing, but
too much is disastrous,

00:33:59.650 --> 00:34:03.480
then we could conceivably
go from the 18 to the 20,

00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:05.890
and that would be the ultimate.

00:34:05.890 --> 00:34:09.670
Now look what happens if
inflation comes and it goes

00:34:09.670 --> 00:34:11.920
from the 3% to 4%, 5% and over.

00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:15.880
If you go to the 4% to 5%, the
multiple drops from 20 to 14.

00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:19.010
That's a 30% drop instantly.

00:34:19.010 --> 00:34:21.670
And if you go to
5% or 6%, you're

00:34:21.670 --> 00:34:23.760
going to go down to
a multiple of 10.

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:26.310
So this market
has the potential.

00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:28.889
If inflation starts
to perk up and the Fed

00:34:28.889 --> 00:34:31.969
doesn't act properly,
you could have a market

00:34:31.969 --> 00:34:33.719
that goes down dramatically.

00:34:33.719 --> 00:34:35.380
I am not predicting inflation.

00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:37.690
I'm only suggesting
that you watch for it.

00:34:37.690 --> 00:34:38.820
It could be years away.

00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:39.850
I don't know.

00:34:39.850 --> 00:34:42.030
But it's something to
be concerned about.

00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:44.110
Now let me show you
something a little on history

00:34:44.110 --> 00:34:46.170
that I thought you
would appreciate

00:34:46.170 --> 00:34:49.949
knowing, because most people
don't realize how subtle it

00:34:49.949 --> 00:34:52.457
is when inflation starts.

00:34:52.457 --> 00:34:55.040
Now remember that chart I showed
you, "not a bear among them,"

00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:56.590
everybody was bullish?

00:34:56.590 --> 00:34:58.560
You know why they were bullish?

00:34:58.560 --> 00:34:59.940
It was at the sweet spot.

00:34:59.940 --> 00:35:05.610
We have 2.76% inflation, we
have reasonable interest rates,

00:35:05.610 --> 00:35:07.570
we had a strong economy.

00:35:07.570 --> 00:35:09.700
How could you not be bullish?

00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:12.290
The only reason you
shouldn't have been bullish

00:35:12.290 --> 00:35:14.920
is because the multiples
were way too high.

00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:16.350
It's like Benjamin Graham said.

00:35:16.350 --> 00:35:18.390
Price determines your return.

00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:20.840
No matter how good a
company is, no matter

00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:24.770
how good the situation is,
if the valuation is too high,

00:35:24.770 --> 00:35:27.170
eventually something's
going to take it back.

00:35:27.170 --> 00:35:29.510
And sure enough, this
is what took it down.

00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:35.440
In January of '73,
you have a 2.76%.

00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:38.660
One year later, just one
year later, the inflation

00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:41.130
went from 2.76% to 4.93%.

00:35:41.130 --> 00:35:43.860
It almost doubled in a year.

00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:48.020
One more year later-- that's two
years-- and the interest rates

00:35:48.020 --> 00:35:51.800
went from 2.76% to 11%.

00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:55.770
And so you had a market that
went from 20 times earnings

00:35:55.770 --> 00:35:58.630
down to seven,
eight, nine, and 10.

00:35:58.630 --> 00:36:02.230
And that created this
disastrous bear market,

00:36:02.230 --> 00:36:04.530
and that's what I went
through at the time.

00:36:04.530 --> 00:36:07.620
So keep in mind
that inflation is

00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:11.090
one of the biggest
enemies to stock prices,

00:36:11.090 --> 00:36:14.190
because stock prices are
affected our interest rates.

00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:17.220
And obviously, interest rates
are affected by inflation.

00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:21.460
So let's look at the next chart
and this is my favorite one

00:36:21.460 --> 00:36:22.530
indicator.

00:36:22.530 --> 00:36:24.810
If you needed one
indicator to give you

00:36:24.810 --> 00:36:27.030
the pulse of the market
to tell you where it is,

00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:31.240
I would have understood
this indicator in 1968.

00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:33.980
I would not have been
caught up in this market.

00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:35.550
So here is the value line.

00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:38.520
The reason I use the
value line in the S&amp;P

00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:41.550
is because the value line has
several features that I think

00:36:41.550 --> 00:36:43.570
are really much better.

00:36:43.570 --> 00:36:48.250
First of all, it's 1700
stocks instead of 500.

00:36:48.250 --> 00:36:50.290
It gives you a
cross-section of the market,

00:36:50.290 --> 00:36:53.410
which is much better than
just the S&amp;P, which are mostly

00:36:53.410 --> 00:36:54.560
big caps.

00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:58.940
The second thing is that it's
a median P/E, not an average.

00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:01.420
And so by a median
P/E, it sorts out

00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:04.720
all the distortion that happens
when you have an average.

00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:06.770
And the beauty
about this thing is

00:37:06.770 --> 00:37:08.460
that if you look
over the 40 years

00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:11.600
that I've been in the
business, or 48 years,

00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:14.280
you can see that the
bottoms of the market,

00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:17.090
irrespective of
how bad things get,

00:37:17.090 --> 00:37:20.670
is about 10 times earnings
on the value line.

00:37:20.670 --> 00:37:22.160
And it's only
happened four times.

00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:23.910
You can see it in the chart.

00:37:23.910 --> 00:37:26.430
The beauty about being
able to [INAUDIBLE] top,

00:37:26.430 --> 00:37:29.890
the tops had never been
more than 20 times earnings,

00:37:29.890 --> 00:37:33.280
and the tops have always
also been four times.

00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:35.780
So you have a good
history of knowing

00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:37.560
that when the market,
the value line

00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:41.710
gets down to 12 times
earnings, it's about 25%

00:37:41.710 --> 00:37:45.180
above the worst case, that's a
good time to be buying stocks.

00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:48.240
And you know when it gets
to the 17 to 18 times,

00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:51.050
it still has a little bit to go,
but you need a perfect world.

00:37:51.050 --> 00:37:52.820
And if you don't
get a perfect world,

00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:54.890
well, it could be going down.

00:37:54.890 --> 00:37:57.720
Now one thing on the chart
that's really interesting,

00:37:57.720 --> 00:37:59.790
you look at the left
side of the chart

00:37:59.790 --> 00:38:01.330
and you can see the low point.

00:38:01.330 --> 00:38:05.750
That was the time when the
interest rates went from 2.76%

00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:07.640
to over 13%.

00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:10.440
And so you can see that
those stocks in that-- that's

00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:13.420
the only exception on
the inflation situation

00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:18.040
is the fact that the stocks
went down to an average of 7.6%,

00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:20.160
and they went as
low as 3% and 4%.

00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:23.290
Now I remember in '74,
sitting there agonizing.

00:38:23.290 --> 00:38:25.890
I had 25 to 30 stocks lined up.

00:38:25.890 --> 00:38:28.990
They're all selling between
three and seven times earnings.

00:38:28.990 --> 00:38:31.034
And I just couldn't
decide which one to buy.

00:38:31.034 --> 00:38:33.450
This one's a little better,
but I don't-- this is a little

00:38:33.450 --> 00:38:33.949
better.

00:38:33.949 --> 00:38:36.170
This is a little--
back and forth.

00:38:36.170 --> 00:38:40.000
All you had to do was throw a
dart and they all worked well.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.730
So it's kind of like they say.

00:38:44.730 --> 00:38:47.067
In a bull market--
in a bear market,

00:38:47.067 --> 00:38:48.150
you don't want an analyst.

00:38:48.150 --> 00:38:50.330
In a bill market,
you don't need one.

00:38:50.330 --> 00:38:51.760
So when stocks are cheap--

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:53.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:53.150 --> 00:38:56.060
--you really can buy
them at the right price.

00:38:56.060 --> 00:38:57.335
OK.

00:38:57.335 --> 00:39:00.560
And what I'd like to do
now is talk a little bit

00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:02.830
about the two areas
that I think are

00:39:02.830 --> 00:39:05.070
worth your while to look into.

00:39:05.070 --> 00:39:06.920
I don't see too
many opportunities

00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:08.770
in the stock market,
although there

00:39:08.770 --> 00:39:12.740
are individual sectors
and individual stocks that

00:39:12.740 --> 00:39:13.540
are reasonable.

00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:15.790
They're not dirt cheap,
but they're reasonable.

00:39:15.790 --> 00:39:18.160
But the areas that
are exciting me today

00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:20.580
are the energy markets
and the gold markets.

00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:23.730
And let's take energy first.

00:39:23.730 --> 00:39:28.790
As you know, in energy
we had $140 oil price.

00:39:28.790 --> 00:39:30.710
Everybody that
had a drilling rig

00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:32.430
when out and drilled for oil.

00:39:32.430 --> 00:39:35.230
We created this massive
surplus, and then the market

00:39:35.230 --> 00:39:36.190
turned down.

00:39:36.190 --> 00:39:38.530
And so we built
this huge surplus.

00:39:38.530 --> 00:39:43.250
And so the price went down
from $140 down to $26 to $28.

00:39:43.250 --> 00:39:45.614
Now if you read the
newspapers there,

00:39:45.614 --> 00:39:47.780
all you would have had to
do is read the newspapers,

00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:50.160
and you would have known that
you were in the value zone,

00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:52.560
because that's the
contrary opinion.

00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:54.610
All the experts were
saying that the oil

00:39:54.610 --> 00:39:57.430
was going to go down to $20,
maybe even in the teens.

00:39:57.430 --> 00:39:57.980
Who knows?

00:39:57.980 --> 00:39:59.036
Whatever.

00:39:59.036 --> 00:40:00.660
But the point about
it is if you looked

00:40:00.660 --> 00:40:03.275
at the fundamentals
today, the oil,

00:40:03.275 --> 00:40:05.590
the surplus is
kind of imbalanced.

00:40:05.590 --> 00:40:07.410
The way they
measured a surplus is

00:40:07.410 --> 00:40:09.900
by the number of
days of inventory.

00:40:09.900 --> 00:40:12.130
At the high point when
you have a lot of surplus,

00:40:12.130 --> 00:40:14.740
you can get 38
days of inventory.

00:40:14.740 --> 00:40:17.690
And at the low
point, it's 25 to 26.

00:40:17.690 --> 00:40:19.430
The average is about 32.

00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:22.710
So 32 days of average
inventory is when

00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:24.410
the market is in equilibrium.

00:40:24.410 --> 00:40:26.420
Then the rest is
supply and demand.

00:40:26.420 --> 00:40:28.110
OK.

00:40:28.110 --> 00:40:29.250
The average is 32.

00:40:29.250 --> 00:40:30.820
We are at 30.2.

00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:34.570
So we are getting into
equilibrium where it's even.

00:40:34.570 --> 00:40:37.510
It's even slightly
less than the average.

00:40:37.510 --> 00:40:39.030
So that's the positive.

00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:40.930
The other part is
that the production

00:40:40.930 --> 00:40:43.090
is going down dramatically.

00:40:43.090 --> 00:40:45.800
Throughout the world,
they have cut $1 trillion

00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:48.015
of capital expenditures.

00:40:48.015 --> 00:40:49.960
So you know, just
common sense says

00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:53.140
that the decline is coming in.

00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:55.470
So far, the demand,
surprisingly,

00:40:55.470 --> 00:40:58.610
which is surprising everybody,
demand keeps going up.

00:40:58.610 --> 00:41:01.930
And so the demand is going up,
the production is going down,

00:41:01.930 --> 00:41:03.780
the drilling rigs,
the percentage

00:41:03.780 --> 00:41:08.300
in drilling rigs in
operation are down 79%.

00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:11.050
So you know that
production is going down.

00:41:11.050 --> 00:41:15.100
And the projections are today
that the average inventory

00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:19.180
could go down to 26 days
by the end of the year,

00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:21.450
or let's call it nine months.

00:41:21.450 --> 00:41:23.790
And that would mean that
that would be the lowest

00:41:23.790 --> 00:41:26.272
inventory in 25 years.

00:41:26.272 --> 00:41:27.730
The other thing
you want to look at

00:41:27.730 --> 00:41:31.465
is that while you hear
about the productivity,

00:41:31.465 --> 00:41:33.450
that they've been
able to cut the costs,

00:41:33.450 --> 00:41:37.780
some people can produce oil
at $25 to $35 and so forth.

00:41:37.780 --> 00:41:43.060
However, if you want to produce
95 million barrels a day,

00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:44.960
which is what we
need, you're not

00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:47.150
going to do it on
$50 or $60 oil.

00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:51.550
The minimum that we
require is $60 to $65.

00:41:51.550 --> 00:41:53.320
That's the marginal cost of oil.

00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:55.180
In other words, most
companies are not

00:41:55.180 --> 00:41:58.810
going to go out and drill
unless they can make $65.

00:41:58.810 --> 00:42:01.260
Because some people
can do it, but there's

00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:04.550
not enough of that cheap oil
to be able to meet the demand.

00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:09.430
So we have to have a higher
price than $65 to $70.

00:42:09.430 --> 00:42:12.130
And with the way it's going
under production costs,

00:42:12.130 --> 00:42:15.330
I believe, it's my personal
opinion, by looking at this,

00:42:15.330 --> 00:42:18.110
talking to the companies,
talking to all these people

00:42:18.110 --> 00:42:21.470
who are very knowledgeable,
there is the possibility

00:42:21.470 --> 00:42:23.770
that if they don't start
the production soon,

00:42:23.770 --> 00:42:27.710
that one day we might even
have a temporary spike in oil.

00:42:27.710 --> 00:42:31.200
So the opportunities
in oil are there.

00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:33.260
The valuations are still good.

00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:36.370
And there's opportunities
in the stocks and the bonds,

00:42:36.370 --> 00:42:39.460
and that would be something I
would direct your attention in.

00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:43.310
The next thing I would like to
do is cover the gold market.

00:42:43.310 --> 00:42:46.500
Now let me say this.

00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:48.170
I am not a gold buyer.

00:42:48.170 --> 00:42:54.080
I have only owned gold
three times in 48 years.

00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:56.400
I am a value investor.

00:42:56.400 --> 00:43:01.440
And when a market goes down
for five straight years,

00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:05.780
and it goes down 85%, which is
what happened to this market,

00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:10.660
you are in market evaluations
that only happened 2% or 3%

00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:11.920
of the time.

00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:18.690
So buying into the gold
market at the turn of the year

00:43:18.690 --> 00:43:22.440
was like buying
into stocks in 1974.

00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:28.180
The market had gone down
five years, 85% down.

00:43:28.180 --> 00:43:31.027
Any time a market
goes down 65%, you

00:43:31.027 --> 00:43:32.610
want to dust it off
and start looking.

00:43:32.610 --> 00:43:36.800
But when you've got 85% decline,
that's pretty extraordinary.

00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:40.120
But here is a very
important statistic,

00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:44.270
and that is there
are $294 trillion

00:43:44.270 --> 00:43:47.362
worth of assets, cash stocks
and bonds, in the world.

00:43:47.362 --> 00:43:48.820
That's all the
assets in the world,

00:43:48.820 --> 00:43:52.006
not counting real estate.

00:43:52.006 --> 00:43:56.810
All the gold in the world
is only $7 trillion,

00:43:56.810 --> 00:44:00.270
and half of that is in
jewelry and technology.

00:44:00.270 --> 00:44:04.300
So you only have
about $3.5 trillion

00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:08.350
that is tradeable in gold,
and it's probably even less.

00:44:08.350 --> 00:44:13.830
Now if 1% of the people
into the $294 trillion

00:44:13.830 --> 00:44:17.070
decide to move 1% of
their assets into gold,

00:44:17.070 --> 00:44:19.800
that would be $2.9 trillion.

00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:23.950
That 1% would be enough to
absorb all the gold that's

00:44:23.950 --> 00:44:28.180
ever been mined in the world,
and that is extraordinary.

00:44:28.180 --> 00:44:31.190
And that is an
unusual opportunity.

00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:32.800
The market has come
up quite a bit,

00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:35.010
so I've cautioned diving in.

00:44:35.010 --> 00:44:36.340
It's worth looking into.

00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:39.980
Now let me just take a couple
of moments [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:39.980 --> 00:44:42.160
Well, what's going to
make people buy gold?

00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:44.300
It's been around
for 5,000 years.

00:44:44.300 --> 00:44:46.230
Why would they buy any more?

00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:48.240
Well, first of all,
there's $10 trillion

00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:51.440
in negative interest
rates today.

00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:53.820
We've never had that in
the history of the world,

00:44:53.820 --> 00:44:55.310
negative interest rates.

00:44:55.310 --> 00:44:57.420
So there's $10 trillion.

00:44:57.420 --> 00:44:59.000
There's $12 trillion
dollars that

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:02.340
has been printed
throughout the world.

00:45:02.340 --> 00:45:04.620
That's another potential.

00:45:04.620 --> 00:45:07.660
We've got the enormous
worldwide debt.

00:45:07.660 --> 00:45:11.300
And more importantly, we've
got worldwide uncertainty.

00:45:11.300 --> 00:45:14.320
So I really believe that
over the next few years,

00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:17.380
there's going to be a tremendous
flow into these gold markets.

00:45:17.380 --> 00:45:19.770
And let me just say one
thing, which most people don't

00:45:19.770 --> 00:45:23.690
realize, and I hear everybody
who's critical of gold saying.

00:45:23.690 --> 00:45:28.740
Whenever we cut the ties
to gold in August of 1971--

00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:30.020
I'll never forget that day.

00:45:30.020 --> 00:45:32.830
I didn't think I could ever
believe that the United

00:45:32.830 --> 00:45:35.025
States would cut its link
with gold and the dollar,

00:45:35.025 --> 00:45:37.240
the dollar was always supreme.

00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:39.730
So we became a fiat currency.

00:45:39.730 --> 00:45:43.350
If you would have bought gold,
which we did at that time,

00:45:43.350 --> 00:45:48.140
the average return is
7.96% over 44 years.

00:45:48.140 --> 00:45:52.520
If you bought it 20 years ago,
the average return is 6.48%.

00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:54.040
And if you bought
it 10 years ago,

00:45:54.040 --> 00:45:56.560
the average return is about 8%.

00:45:56.560 --> 00:46:00.840
If you bought it at the top of
the market in 2011 till now,

00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:02.760
you would have lost 2.5%.

00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:06.580
The point I'm making, over
any 10 or 20-year period,

00:46:06.580 --> 00:46:09.750
you're going to make
6% to 9% on your money,

00:46:09.750 --> 00:46:12.170
irrespective of whether
it pays dividends.

00:46:12.170 --> 00:46:15.980
And I know you could do better,
but you could also do worse.

00:46:15.980 --> 00:46:19.610
In this type of environment, I
see it's a great opportunity.

00:46:19.610 --> 00:46:21.440
It's something you
should look into.

00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:24.510
Don't dive into it right away,
because it had a big run.

00:46:24.510 --> 00:46:26.440
But energy and
gold are something

00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:29.350
that are worthwhile
as a value investor

00:46:29.350 --> 00:46:31.930
that you want to look into.

00:46:31.930 --> 00:46:35.670
I want to summarize this
program with these things,

00:46:35.670 --> 00:46:38.770
to summarize the things that I
learned through my experience.

00:46:38.770 --> 00:46:41.440
First of all, always
seek the truth.

00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:44.340
Number two, develop your
own set of principles.

00:46:44.340 --> 00:46:45.980
Not the ones you
were taught, not

00:46:45.980 --> 00:46:48.210
the one part of your
religion, but the ones

00:46:48.210 --> 00:46:51.110
that you make and own
yourself, and the ones you're

00:46:51.110 --> 00:46:53.540
willing to make a sacrifice for.

00:46:53.540 --> 00:46:57.890
Be totally focused on everything
you do so you can not only

00:46:57.890 --> 00:47:01.170
harness your intelligence,
but the greater intelligence

00:47:01.170 --> 00:47:02.780
of your subconscious mind.

00:47:02.780 --> 00:47:06.710
It only comes through focusing.

00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:11.270
And by practicing the principle
and following the philosophy

00:47:11.270 --> 00:47:14.960
and sticking with it, you
develop tremendous faith

00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:16.340
and courage.

00:47:16.340 --> 00:47:18.700
And that's the kind
of thing you need

00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:21.350
to go through any difficult
time that you might

00:47:21.350 --> 00:47:24.080
have to go through your life.

00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:28.290
And finally, and the most
important one, never give up.

00:47:28.290 --> 00:47:29.276
Thank you very much.

00:47:29.276 --> 00:47:33.318
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:36.832 --> 00:47:38.290
SPEAKER: Thank you
so much, Arnold.

00:47:38.290 --> 00:47:42.190
This was very inspirational, and
I expected nothing different.

00:47:42.190 --> 00:47:44.160
So folks, we are open
for questions now.

00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:46.500
And just a small announcement.

00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:49.990
After the talk, if somebody
wants the books autographed

00:47:49.990 --> 00:47:51.111
by you, would that be OK?

00:47:51.111 --> 00:47:52.360
ARNOLD VAN DEN BERG: Oh, sure.

00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:54.170
SPEAKER: So there will
be some books there,

00:47:54.170 --> 00:47:55.780
and Arnold will be
here to autograph them.

00:47:55.780 --> 00:47:58.029
ARNOLD VAN DEN BERG: And if
I could just take a second

00:47:58.029 --> 00:47:59.190
to explain the book.

00:47:59.190 --> 00:48:01.890
One of my hobbies is
collecting quotations.

00:48:01.890 --> 00:48:04.030
You know, Socrates
said, "employ your time"

00:48:04.030 --> 00:48:06.410
in reading great
people's lives so you

00:48:06.410 --> 00:48:08.720
can learn in a very simple
way what it took them

00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:11.430
all their life to do.

00:48:11.430 --> 00:48:13.800
And the best way I've found
to do that is to quote.

00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:17.150
Sometimes in a quote, you
can capture what a person

00:48:17.150 --> 00:48:19.030
took their whole life to learn.

00:48:19.030 --> 00:48:20.960
Incredible wisdom through that.

00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:24.610
And so I have about 5,000
quotes on my computer,

00:48:24.610 --> 00:48:26.222
and I log them by subjects.

00:48:26.222 --> 00:48:27.680
So whenever I'm
studying a subject,

00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:31.480
I have the chance to read what
all the great people thought

00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:32.070
about it.

00:48:32.070 --> 00:48:35.390
So I made a little
quote book on that,

00:48:35.390 --> 00:48:37.450
and I'd like to
share that with you.

00:48:37.450 --> 00:48:40.280
The second book is
"Poverty to Power."

00:48:40.280 --> 00:48:42.830
It's one of the most
extraordinary books

00:48:42.830 --> 00:48:45.100
that I have read over my career.

00:48:45.100 --> 00:48:47.960
I've been reading it
for over 30 years.

00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:49.620
And when I went
to the publisher,

00:48:49.620 --> 00:48:51.062
say, I wanted to
buy a big volume

00:48:51.062 --> 00:48:53.270
because I wanted to give
them out to friends, family,

00:48:53.270 --> 00:48:54.400
and clients.

00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:58.140
He said, oh, we only
publish about 25 books.

00:48:58.140 --> 00:48:59.840
So I thought, 25 books.

00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:01.310
A book this great?

00:49:01.310 --> 00:49:04.100
Anyway, the reason I
recommend this book

00:49:04.100 --> 00:49:07.540
is because this
gentleman, James Allen,

00:49:07.540 --> 00:49:11.005
is one person that has spent
his whole life seeking truth.

00:49:11.005 --> 00:49:13.620
And he's searched through
all the different cultures,

00:49:13.620 --> 00:49:14.860
religions.

00:49:14.860 --> 00:49:16.240
You can't imagine.

00:49:16.240 --> 00:49:18.660
And I have never had a
problem where I couldn't

00:49:18.660 --> 00:49:20.480
find the answer in that book.

00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:24.710
So I hope you'll use that
as a source in your life.

00:49:24.710 --> 00:49:25.910
SPEAKER: Thank you, Arnold.

00:49:25.910 --> 00:49:27.144
Questions?

00:49:27.144 --> 00:49:28.310
AUDIENCE: Thanks for coming.

00:49:28.310 --> 00:49:31.430
It was really great
hearing you talk.

00:49:31.430 --> 00:49:33.580
So as a value
investor, what do you

00:49:33.580 --> 00:49:36.750
do when you don't see an
opportunity in the market?

00:49:36.750 --> 00:49:38.720
What's your stance on cash?

00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:40.428
ARNOLD VAN DEN BERG:
As a value investor,

00:49:40.428 --> 00:49:42.580
what do you do when you
don't have any options?

00:49:42.580 --> 00:49:46.390
Over the 40 years or so
that Century Management's

00:49:46.390 --> 00:49:50.520
been in business, our average
cash position was 20%.

00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:53.340
I always felt that
holding back cash,

00:49:53.340 --> 00:49:55.360
even when there's
great opportunities,

00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:57.550
there's always
opportunities to go along.

00:49:57.550 --> 00:50:01.270
So we always had a higher cash
position than most people.

00:50:01.270 --> 00:50:04.040
But in a time when
there are great values,

00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:05.710
we have a little less cash.

00:50:05.710 --> 00:50:09.590
Today, I feel one of the
best cash items is gold.

00:50:09.590 --> 00:50:11.790
And so we don't
have as much cash,

00:50:11.790 --> 00:50:14.580
but we do have a lot
more in the gold market.

00:50:14.580 --> 00:50:16.530
So the answer is cash.

00:50:16.530 --> 00:50:18.670
Even if cash doesn't
make any money,

00:50:18.670 --> 00:50:20.680
it's better than losing money.

00:50:20.680 --> 00:50:22.490
So you have to be patient.

00:50:22.490 --> 00:50:27.530
And that's one of the principles
you learn is patient pays off.

00:50:27.530 --> 00:50:32.420
One thing I can tell you of
being 48 years in the business,

00:50:32.420 --> 00:50:35.252
you will always find
values if you're patient.

00:50:35.252 --> 00:50:36.960
You might have to wait
a year and a half.

00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:38.690
You might have to
wait two years.

00:50:38.690 --> 00:50:41.480
But my God, what I went
through writing this thing down

00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:45.720
for six years, I wouldn't wish
that on the worst human being.

00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:49.090
That's a terrible thing to do
to come to the office every day

00:50:49.090 --> 00:50:50.150
and just get beat up.

00:50:50.150 --> 00:50:51.780
It's just like a torture.

00:50:51.780 --> 00:50:55.810
So if you're not sure, if you
don't have a great opportunity,

00:50:55.810 --> 00:50:58.990
it's better to take no
interest than it looks.

00:50:58.990 --> 00:51:02.430
AUDIENCE: I'm just
curious about Apple.

00:51:02.430 --> 00:51:04.420
It's, like, the world's
biggest company.

00:51:04.420 --> 00:51:06.450
The P/E is probably
at, like, 10.

00:51:06.450 --> 00:51:11.980
[INAUDIBLE] 7 P/E. And
meanwhile, all the other tech

00:51:11.980 --> 00:51:14.960
companies are way
higher, like Microsoft.

00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:17.795
SPEAKER: So the
question is about Apple.

00:51:17.795 --> 00:51:19.600
It's a low P/E, about 10.

00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:22.210
And they have a lot of cash
on their balance sheet.

00:51:22.210 --> 00:51:25.985
So if you take the cash out,
it's even lower P/E in effect.

00:51:25.985 --> 00:51:28.110
How do you think about
that, because all other tech

00:51:28.110 --> 00:51:31.890
companies are selling at
more expensive prices?

00:51:31.890 --> 00:51:34.410
ARNOLD VAN DEN BERG: Well,
I think by all criteria,

00:51:34.410 --> 00:51:37.410
you would have a great value.

00:51:37.410 --> 00:51:39.300
The question that
I have-- and I'm

00:51:39.300 --> 00:51:42.390
sorry that I can't give you a
definitive answer, because we

00:51:42.390 --> 00:51:43.450
don't follow it.

00:51:43.450 --> 00:51:44.800
We're not in it.

00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:47.530
But the thing is,
from all standpoints,

00:51:47.530 --> 00:51:50.850
just from a cursory standpoint,
you're right about the cash.

00:51:50.850 --> 00:51:52.590
If you took it on,
it'd be cheaper.

00:51:52.590 --> 00:51:54.680
They've got all
this opportunity,

00:51:54.680 --> 00:51:58.010
they've got a lot of
money in the bank.

00:51:58.010 --> 00:52:00.490
But my question
is, what are they

00:52:00.490 --> 00:52:02.250
going to do for the future?

00:52:02.250 --> 00:52:04.340
That's the most important thing.

00:52:04.340 --> 00:52:07.420
And I'm not qualified to
answer that, because I'm not

00:52:07.420 --> 00:52:09.710
a technical person.

00:52:09.710 --> 00:52:12.090
But if I was looking
at the company,

00:52:12.090 --> 00:52:14.160
and we've looked at
it back and forth,

00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:16.450
the thing that I have
a big question mark

00:52:16.450 --> 00:52:19.920
is, what are they going
to do into the future?

00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:23.170
Because you can have a
low P/E. As long as you

00:52:23.170 --> 00:52:25.400
have less than 10
times cash flow,

00:52:25.400 --> 00:52:27.830
you get a 10% cash flow return.

00:52:27.830 --> 00:52:31.110
And so you could keep this
even if it didn't go up.

00:52:31.110 --> 00:52:34.210
If the price didn't go up,
the value keeps going up,

00:52:34.210 --> 00:52:35.630
and it pushes the price up.

00:52:35.630 --> 00:52:38.360
So I wouldn't fault
anybody for saying this

00:52:38.360 --> 00:52:40.180
is an extraordinary bargain.

00:52:40.180 --> 00:52:41.780
But the question I
have, and you would

00:52:41.780 --> 00:52:45.290
be able to answer it better than
I do, is what is the future?

00:52:45.290 --> 00:52:47.140
And I remember one of
my analysts came to me

00:52:47.140 --> 00:52:49.370
and he says, Arnold, we
ought to look at Apple.

00:52:49.370 --> 00:52:51.905
And it was the highest
capitalization in the market.

00:52:51.905 --> 00:52:54.590
And I said, you
know, Dale, I said,

00:52:54.590 --> 00:52:56.870
it's been my experience
when a company gets

00:52:56.870 --> 00:53:01.190
to be the biggest capitalization
in the history of the market,

00:53:01.190 --> 00:53:03.560
if you look at the
next five to 10 years,

00:53:03.560 --> 00:53:05.770
the performance
isn't all that great.

00:53:05.770 --> 00:53:09.180
Now that's not a
judgment on the company.

00:53:09.180 --> 00:53:14.720
But when it's so big, bigger
than anything around, what

00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:17.890
did they have to do to create
that growth to keep it going?

00:53:17.890 --> 00:53:19.440
So it's a very good question.

00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:21.480
I wish I could give
you the answer.

00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:24.960
If I could, I'd probably buy it.

00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:27.100
SPEAKER: So unfortunately,
we are out of time.

00:53:27.100 --> 00:53:29.330
But I hope there will
be time to continue

00:53:29.330 --> 00:53:31.480
this conversation outside.

00:53:31.480 --> 00:53:33.300
ARNOLD VAN DEN BERG: Oh, sure.

00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:35.860
SPEAKER: So thank you, everyone.
