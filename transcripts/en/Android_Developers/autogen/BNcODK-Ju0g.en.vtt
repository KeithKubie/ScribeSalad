hi welcome to the animation talk on
Friday afternoon we are opposite a

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170
Friday afternoon we are opposite a
 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.959
Friday afternoon we are opposite a
Kotlin talk so I think that means that

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969
Kotlin talk so I think that means that
 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.640
Kotlin talk so I think that means that
everybody in this room didn't want to

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650
everybody in this room didn't want to
 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.709
everybody in this room didn't want to
hear about Kotlin which is perfect

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719
hear about Kotlin which is perfect
 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.570
hear about Kotlin which is perfect
because we don't have any Kotlin on our

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580
because we don't have any Kotlin on our
 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.390
because we don't have any Kotlin on our

about animation we're going to talk

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820
about animation we're going to talk
 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.940
about animation we're going to talk
about small changes that were made to

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950
about small changes that were made to
 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.979
about small changes that were made to
the existing animator stuff small but

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989
the existing animator stuff small but
 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.260
the existing animator stuff small but
very important and deceptively tricky to

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270
very important and deceptively tricky to
 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.510
very important and deceptively tricky to
implement features but more importantly

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520
implement features but more importantly
 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.130

Doris is going to tell you all about a
 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.560
Doris is going to tell you all about a
new physics based animation system

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570
new physics based animation system
 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:54.729
new physics based animation system
starting right about now clicker alright

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739
starting right about now clicker alright
 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:57.500
starting right about now clicker alright
so today I'm going to talk about physics

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510
so today I'm going to talk about physics
 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.319
so today I'm going to talk about physics
facing images you might be asking why

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329
facing images you might be asking why
 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.819
facing images you might be asking why
would we need a physics based animation

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829
would we need a physics based animation
 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.090
would we need a physics based animation

the android framework team I was up an

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500
the android framework team I was up an
 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.030
the android framework team I was up an
app developer just like some of you I

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040
app developer just like some of you I
 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.770
app developer just like some of you I
wanted to create a swipe animation for

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780
wanted to create a swipe animation for
 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.499
wanted to create a swipe animation for
the Google camera app and had the camera

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509
the Google camera app and had the camera
 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.390
the Google camera app and had the camera
menu moving in a beautiful waveform

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400
menu moving in a beautiful waveform
 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.749
menu moving in a beautiful waveform
along with a gesture I'd also track the

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759
along with a gesture I'd also track the
 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.969
along with a gesture I'd also track the
velocity of the gesture up until this

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979
velocity of the gesture up until this
 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.670
velocity of the gesture up until this
moment of finger release then I thought

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680
moment of finger release then I thought
 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.429
moment of finger release then I thought
to myself alright now the only thing

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439
to myself alright now the only thing
 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.560
to myself alright now the only thing
that's missing in this is getting the

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570
that's missing in this is getting the
 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.319
that's missing in this is getting the
camera menu to continue the momentum of

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329
camera menu to continue the momentum of
 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.980
camera menu to continue the momentum of
the gesture once the finger is released

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990
the gesture once the finger is released
 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.499
the gesture once the finger is released
so I looked in view of the end Android

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509
so I looked in view of the end Android
 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.289
so I looked in view of the end Android
animation framework for an API that can

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299
animation framework for an API that can
 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.420
animation framework for an API that can
take velocity as one of the starting

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430
take velocity as one of the starting
 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.350
take velocity as one of the starting
conditions and close the gap for me I

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360
conditions and close the gap for me I
 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.289
conditions and close the gap for me I
looked and looked and there was no such

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299
looked and looked and there was no such
 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.590
looked and looked and there was no such
API if you've had similar experience

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600
API if you've had similar experience
 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.719
API if you've had similar experience
building animations in your apps you're

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729
building animations in your apps you're
 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.850
building animations in your apps you're
in luck because today we're going to

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860
in luck because today we're going to
 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.230
in luck because today we're going to
talk about the new physics based

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240
talk about the new physics based
 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.149
talk about the new physics based
animation library that we have just

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159
animation library that we have just
 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.980
animation library that we have just
released you might be asking how is this

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990
released you might be asking how is this
 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.930
released you might be asking how is this
you physics-based animation library any

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940
you physics-based animation library any
 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.729
you physics-based animation library any
difference than the existing animation

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:11.739
difference than the existing animation
 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:14.100
difference than the existing animation
API well if you're familiar with the

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110
API well if you're familiar with the
 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.920
API well if you're familiar with the
existing animation API you know in order

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930
existing animation API you know in order
 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.199
existing animation API you know in order
to create its animation you will need to

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209
to create its animation you will need to
 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.729
to create its animation you will need to
provide a start value end value duration

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739
provide a start value end value duration
 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:27.360
provide a start value end value duration
and an interpolator velocities that's

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370
and an interpolator velocities that's
 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.970
and an interpolator velocities that's
just an afterthought once such an

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980
just an afterthought once such an
 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.030
just an afterthought once such an
animation is created velocity has to be

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040
animation is created velocity has to be
 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.040
animation is created velocity has to be
derived from other properties of the

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050
derived from other properties of the
 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.610
derived from other properties of the
animations given that it's extremely

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620
animations given that it's extremely
 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.680
animations given that it's extremely
difficult to create an animation that

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690
difficult to create an animation that
 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.890
difficult to create an animation that
can continue the momentum of the gesture

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900
can continue the momentum of the gesture
 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.059
can continue the momentum of the gesture
once once you know that's leading up to

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069
once once you know that's leading up to
 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:50.880
once once you know that's leading up to
the animation but with physics based

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890
the animation but with physics based
 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.890
the animation but with physics based
animations or it can handle the

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900
animations or it can handle the
 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.820
animations or it can handle the
different gestures with the different

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830
different gestures with the different
 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.180
different gestures with the different
velocities much easier from different

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190
velocities much easier from different
 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.550
velocities much easier from different
gestures from small swipe to a really

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560
gestures from small swipe to a really
 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.550
gestures from small swipe to a really
fast play also because the movements of

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560
fast play also because the movements of
 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.740
fast play also because the movements of
the animation in the new system are

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750
the animation in the new system are
 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.890
the animation in the new system are
governed by real-world physics they look

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900
governed by real-world physics they look
 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.750
governed by real-world physics they look
more natural and lifelike and the new

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760
more natural and lifelike and the new
 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.849
more natural and lifelike and the new
system can also respond to updated user

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:17.859
system can also respond to updated user
 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:21.210
system can also respond to updated user
input and dynamically change the target

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220
input and dynamically change the target
 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.800
input and dynamically change the target
value of the animation during the

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810
value of the animation during the
 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.099
value of the animation during the
animation now let's take a look at how

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:26.109
animation now let's take a look at how
 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:27.780
animation now let's take a look at how
different an animation system handle

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790
different an animation system handle
 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.370
different an animation system handle
this park evaluate change during the

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380
this park evaluate change during the
 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.330
this park evaluate change during the
animation here we're using a an object

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340
animation here we're using a an object
 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.970
animation here we're using a an object
animator I think some of you might be

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980
animator I think some of you might be
 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.630
animator I think some of you might be
familiar with us and the target value is

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640
familiar with us and the target value is
 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.180
familiar with us and the target value is
indicated by the position of the green

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190
indicated by the position of the green
 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.000
indicated by the position of the green
ring on the bottom as you can see the

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010
ring on the bottom as you can see the
 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.069
ring on the bottom as you can see the
ring had moved before the animation is

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:47.079
ring had moved before the animation is
 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:49.199
ring had moved before the animation is
finished and usually the way we handle

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209
finished and usually the way we handle
 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:52.110
finished and usually the way we handle
this is we would stop we would be

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120
this is we would stop we would be
 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.770
this is we would stop we would be
canceled the ongoing animation and then

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780
canceled the ongoing animation and then
 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.170
canceled the ongoing animation and then
we configure the animation using the new

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180
we configure the animation using the new
 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.990
we configure the animation using the new
end value and then starting it again for

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000
end value and then starting it again for
 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.150
end value and then starting it again for
the problem with that is as you can see

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160
the problem with that is as you can see
 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.599
the problem with that is as you can see
it leads to already sudden and abrupt

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:06.609
it leads to already sudden and abrupt
 

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:10.860
it leads to already sudden and abrupt
change in the movement and if we look at

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870
change in the movement and if we look at
 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.090
change in the movement and if we look at
the velocity chart for this animation

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100
the velocity chart for this animation
 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.439

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720
represent the velocity action white
 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.070
represent the velocity action white
at the moment of target value change the

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080
at the moment of target value change the
 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.020
at the moment of target value change the
velocities are dropped immediately back

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030
velocities are dropped immediately back
 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.710
velocities are dropped immediately back
down to zero and that's because we're we

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720
down to zero and that's because we're we
 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.200
down to zero and that's because we're we
have canceled the ongoing animation and

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210
have canceled the ongoing animation and
 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.420
have canceled the ongoing animation and
then the velocities will start changing

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430
then the velocities will start changing
 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.120
then the velocities will start changing
again once the new animation starts but

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130
again once the new animation starts but
 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.120
again once the new animation starts but
this discontinuity in velocity can

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130
this discontinuity in velocity can
 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:40.950
this discontinuity in velocity can
create a really jarring experience for

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960
create a really jarring experience for
 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.280
create a really jarring experience for
the user

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.290
 
 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.740
 
in contrast here's physics based

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:46.750
in contrast here's physics based
 

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.920
in contrast here's physics based
animation and when the target value has

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930
animation and when the target value has
 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:52.110
animation and when the target value has
changed in physics based animation we

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120
changed in physics based animation we
 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.360
changed in physics based animation we
interpret that as a change in the

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370
interpret that as a change in the
 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.670
interpret that as a change in the
physics force and then the new force

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680
physics force and then the new force
 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:59.370
physics force and then the new force
will continue to act upon the existing

00:04:59.370 --> 00:04:59.380
will continue to act upon the existing
 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:02.100
will continue to act upon the existing
velocity of the object which is why we

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110
velocity of the object which is why we
 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.600
velocity of the object which is why we
won't see a velocity discontinuity and

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610
won't see a velocity discontinuity and
 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.330
won't see a velocity discontinuity and
in this example we can see so the

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.340
in this example we can see so the
 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.520
in this example we can see so the
transition to the new new target

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:11.530
transition to the new new target
 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:15.990
transition to the new new target
position is really smooth and similarly

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000
position is really smooth and similarly
 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.700
position is really smooth and similarly
let's together the velocity chart I

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710
let's together the velocity chart I
 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.040
let's together the velocity chart I
would no longer seeing any discontinuity

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.050
would no longer seeing any discontinuity
 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:23.190
would no longer seeing any discontinuity
in the velocity and that is the key to a

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:23.200
in the velocity and that is the key to a
 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:27.330
in the velocity and that is the key to a
smooth animation at this point you might

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:27.340
smooth animation at this point you might
 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.090
smooth animation at this point you might
be asking so what exactly is the physics

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:30.100
be asking so what exactly is the physics
 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:33.500
be asking so what exactly is the physics
pace innovation the way we define it is

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:33.510
pace innovation the way we define it is
 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:36.000
pace innovation the way we define it is
it's an animation that's driven by force

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.010
it's an animation that's driven by force
 

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:38.370
it's an animation that's driven by force
and based on the force we can calculate

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:38.380
and based on the force we can calculate
 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.100
and based on the force we can calculate
the acceleration or deceleration which

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:41.110
the acceleration or deceleration which
 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.380
the acceleration or deceleration which
we can then use to calculate an update

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:43.390
we can then use to calculate an update
 

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:46.350
we can then use to calculate an update
the velocities and values for the

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360
the velocities and values for the
 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.230
the velocities and values for the
animation until finally when the force

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:49.240
animation until finally when the force
 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.480

which is equilibrium that's our signal

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:51.490
which is equilibrium that's our signal
 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:57.450
which is equilibrium that's our signal
to stop the animation first let's take a

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:57.460
to stop the animation first let's take a
 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:00.090
to stop the animation first let's take a
look at sling animations so animation

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:00.100
look at sling animations so animation
 

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:02.580
look at sling animations so animation
starts with the initial velocity and

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:02.590
starts with the initial velocity and
 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:04.860
starts with the initial velocity and
usually that's the velocity of your

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:04.870
usually that's the velocity of your
 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:07.080
usually that's the velocity of your
gesture and then it will continue that

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:07.090
gesture and then it will continue that
 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:09.270
gesture and then it will continue that
momentum and then gradually comes to

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:09.280
momentum and then gradually comes to
 

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:13.170
momentum and then gradually comes to
stop the force behind the animation is a

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:13.180
stop the force behind the animation is a
 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:15.840
stop the force behind the animation is a
friction force which is proportional to

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:15.850
friction force which is proportional to
 

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:19.560
friction force which is proportional to
the velocity what that means is velocity

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:19.570
the velocity what that means is velocity
 

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:22.320
the velocity what that means is velocity
will undergo an exponential decays in

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:22.330
will undergo an exponential decays in
 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:24.690
will undergo an exponential decays in
the duration of the animation and that

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:24.700
the duration of the animation and that
 

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:27.900
the duration of the animation and that
will produce a very graceful end to the

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:27.910
will produce a very graceful end to the
 

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:30.900
will produce a very graceful end to the
animation and by the way the swing

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:30.910
animation and by the way the swing
 

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:33.180
animation and by the way the swing
animation is exactly the AVI

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:33.190
animation is exactly the AVI
 

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:35.010
animation is exactly the AVI
was looking for years ago when I was

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:35.020
was looking for years ago when I was
 

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:38.780
was looking for years ago when I was
building animation for the camera wrap

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:38.790
 
 

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:41.790
 
now let's be an example for the full

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:41.800
now let's be an example for the full
 

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:47.400
now let's be an example for the full

this list from left to right then the

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:49.990
this list from left to right then the
 

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:52.290
this list from left to right then the
orange dot is indicating the position of

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:52.300
orange dot is indicating the position of
 

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:55.890
orange dot is indicating the position of
my finger and the list just took off at

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:55.900
my finger and the list just took off at
 

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.400
my finger and the list just took off at
the same velocity of my gesture and then

00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:58.410
the same velocity of my gesture and then
 

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:03.690
the same velocity of my gesture and then
gradually come to a rest now let's see

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:03.700
gradually come to a rest now let's see
 

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:06.180
gradually come to a rest now let's see
how this is achieved in order to get

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:06.190
how this is achieved in order to get
 

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:09.870
how this is achieved in order to get
notified when a fling gesture occurs we

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:09.880
notified when a fling gesture occurs we
 

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:12.860
notified when a fling gesture occurs we
need to create a gesture listener and

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:12.870
need to create a gesture listener and
 

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:15.180
need to create a gesture listener and
once the fling Jack's gesture is

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:15.190
once the fling Jack's gesture is
 

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:17.700
once the fling Jack's gesture is
detected we received a song fling

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:17.710

that we'll be using for the velocities
in the new animation system and now

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:36.670
in the new animation system and now
 

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:39.260
in the new animation system and now
we're ready to create a swing animation

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:39.270
we're ready to create a swing animation

to the constructor of the play animation
we need to provide the object we want to

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:44.530
we need to provide the object we want to
 

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:46.800
we need to provide the object we want to
animate in this case it's the list of

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:46.810
animate in this case it's the list of
 

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:49.860
animate in this case it's the list of
bearded injuries and they probably they

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:49.870
bearded injuries and they probably they
 

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:51.630
bearded injuries and they probably they
won't animate in this case that is the

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:51.640
won't animate in this case that is the
 

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:53.820
won't animate in this case that is the
correct since we want to fling this list

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:53.830
correct since we want to fling this list
 

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:58.320
correct since we want to fling this list
horizontally and then we're going to set

00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:58.330
horizontally and then we're going to set
 

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:01.080
horizontally and then we're going to set
the start velocity here you can see I

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:01.090
the start velocity here you can see I
 

00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:03.900
the start velocity here you can see I
have universe the velocity of the

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:03.910
have universe the velocity of the
 

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:06.420
have universe the velocity of the
gesture and that's because here we're

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:06.430
gesture and that's because here we're
 

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:09.450

animating the squared property the

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:09.460
animating the squared property the
 

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:11.700
animating the squared property the
squirrel property is sort of special in

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:11.710
squirrel property is sort of special in

squirrel property is sort of special in
that a positive change in the scroll

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:14.140
that a positive change in the scroll
 

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:16.740
that a positive change in the scroll
value would actually move the list in

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:16.750
value would actually move the list in
 

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:19.590
value would actually move the list in
the opposite direction as a positive

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:19.600

either it's me ladder or max value and I
would encourage you to set a good value

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:37.030
would encourage you to set a good value
 

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:39.120
would encourage you to set a good value

is why we would request for redraws and

00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:51.780
is why we would request for redraws and
 

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:56.190
is why we would request for redraws and
consume a lot of battery and finally

00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:56.200
consume a lot of battery and finally

we're setting friction to control the

00:08:58.290 --> 00:08:58.300
we're setting friction to control the
 

00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:01.800
we're setting friction to control the
rate of deceleration now we're ready to

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:01.810
rate of deceleration now we're ready to
 

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:03.780
rate of deceleration now we're ready to
start so this is all it takes to create

00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:03.790
start so this is all it takes to create
 

00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:08.460
start so this is all it takes to create
a fling animation now let's take a

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:08.470
a fling animation now let's take a
 

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:10.920
a fling animation now let's take a
closer look at a sling friction here I'm

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:10.930
closer look at a sling friction here I'm
 

00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:13.590
closer look at a sling friction here I'm
going to create a animation for the view

00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:13.600
going to create a animation for the view
 

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:16.080
going to create a animation for the view
scroll wide property with a starting

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:16.090
scroll wide property with a starting
 

00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:18.270
scroll wide property with a starting
velocity of 5,000 pixels per second and

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:18.280
velocity of 5,000 pixels per second and
 

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:21.240
velocity of 5,000 pixels per second and
the friction of 1.1 and then I'm going

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:21.250
the friction of 1.1 and then I'm going
 

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:22.770
the friction of 1.1 and then I'm going
to create another animation with the

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:22.780
to create another animation with the
 

00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:24.810
to create another animation with the
exact same setup except we're going to

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:24.820
exact same setup except we're going to
 

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:28.560
exact same setup except we're going to
double the friction and if we run these

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:28.570
double the friction and if we run these
 

00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:30.480
double the friction and if we run these
two animations side-by-side we can see

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:30.490
two animations side-by-side we can see
 

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:33.300
two animations side-by-side we can see
how the friction affects the look of the

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:33.310
how the friction affects the look of the
 

00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:39.240
how the friction affects the look of the
animation as you can see here with a

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:39.250
animation as you can see here with a
 

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:42.630
animation as you can see here with a
smaller value of friction the animation

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:42.640
smaller value of friction the animation
 

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:44.550
smaller value of friction the animation
would go on for much longer

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:44.560
would go on for much longer
 

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:46.200
would go on for much longer
whereas when the friction is higher

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:46.210
whereas when the friction is higher
 

00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:49.080
whereas when the friction is higher
naturally it accelerates the movement a

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:49.090
naturally it accelerates the movement a
 

00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:51.570
naturally it accelerates the movement a
lot faster causing the animation to stop

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:51.580
lot faster causing the animation to stop
 

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:54.240
lot faster causing the animation to stop
a lot sooner and you can configure the

00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:54.250
a lot sooner and you can configure the
 

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:57.390
a lot sooner and you can configure the
friction to - whatever that whatever

00:09:57.390 --> 00:09:57.400
friction to - whatever that whatever
 

00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:59.370
friction to - whatever that whatever
healthy value that looks good for your

animation was also introduced spring

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:08.230
animation was also introduced spring
 

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:12.680
animation was also introduced spring
animations in our new animation system

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:12.690
 
 

00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:15.270
 
now first let's create the spraying

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:15.280
now first let's create the spraying
 

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:17.490

cases of view but it doesn't have the V
 

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:28.020
cases of view but it doesn't have the V
of you it can be any object and then the

00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:28.030
of you it can be any object and then the
 

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:29.640
of you it can be any object and then the
property of all on animate in this case

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:29.650
property of all on animate in this case
 

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:31.770
property of all on animate in this case
is with a translation Y of the view and

00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:31.780
is with a translation Y of the view and
 

00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:34.410
is with a translation Y of the view and
then finally the resting position of the

00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:34.420
then finally the resting position of the
 

00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:37.170
then finally the resting position of the
spring now we're ready to start

00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:37.180
spring now we're ready to start
 

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:42.300
spring now we're ready to start
so this animation would animate the view

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:42.310
so this animation would animate the view
 

00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:45.390
so this animation would animate the view
from whatever translations that he had

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:45.400
from whatever translations that he had
 

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:48.270
from whatever translations that he had
at the start of the animation - back to

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:48.280
at the start of the animation - back to
 

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:50.640
at the start of the animation - back to
zero and here's what it looks like as

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:50.650
zero and here's what it looks like as
 

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:52.140

when the spray animation would start and

00:11:02.819 --> 00:11:02.829
when the spray animation would start and
 

00:11:02.829 --> 00:11:05.069
when the spray animation would start and
then the translation Y would start from

00:11:05.069 --> 00:11:05.079
then the translation Y would start from
 

00:11:05.079 --> 00:11:08.819
then the translation Y would start from
where I released it back to zero I mean

00:11:08.819 --> 00:11:08.829
where I released it back to zero I mean
 

00:11:08.829 --> 00:11:10.889
where I released it back to zero I mean
you can see it bounces back up and also

00:11:10.889 --> 00:11:10.899
you can see it bounces back up and also
 

00:11:10.899 --> 00:11:13.280
you can see it bounces back up and also
a little bit before a rest

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:13.290
a little bit before a rest
 

00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:17.999
a little bit before a rest
translation Y of zero and if you feel

00:11:17.999 --> 00:11:18.009
translation Y of zero and if you feel
 

00:11:18.009 --> 00:11:19.769
translation Y of zero and if you feel
adventurous you can also change the

00:11:19.769 --> 00:11:19.779
adventurous you can also change the
 

00:11:19.779 --> 00:11:22.019
adventurous you can also change the
bounciness of the spring by simply

00:11:22.019 --> 00:11:22.029
bounciness of the spring by simply
 

00:11:22.029 --> 00:11:23.999
bounciness of the spring by simply
setting the damping ratio here we're

00:11:23.999 --> 00:11:24.009
setting the damping ratio here we're
 

00:11:24.009 --> 00:11:25.530
setting the damping ratio here we're
going to set the temperature to not

00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:25.540
going to set the temperature to not
 

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:28.679
going to set the temperature to not
bouncy at all and that's what we see in

00:11:28.679 --> 00:11:28.689
bouncy at all and that's what we see in
 

00:11:28.689 --> 00:11:30.960
bouncy at all and that's what we see in
the animation if you look at this

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:30.970
the animation if you look at this
 

00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:32.699
the animation if you look at this
animation then you feel like this

00:11:32.699 --> 00:11:32.709
animation then you feel like this
 

00:11:32.709 --> 00:11:34.619
animation then you feel like this
doesn't really match your taste for

00:11:34.619 --> 00:11:34.629
doesn't really match your taste for
 

00:11:34.629 --> 00:11:37.590
doesn't really match your taste for
spring animations we have an easy fix

00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:37.600
spring animations we have an easy fix
 

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:39.569
spring animations we have an easy fix
you can simply change the damping ratio

00:11:39.569 --> 00:11:39.579
you can simply change the damping ratio
 

00:11:39.579 --> 00:11:42.150
you can simply change the damping ratio
to high bouncy and then you will have a

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:42.160
to high bouncy and then you will have a
 

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.069
to high bouncy and then you will have a
very bouncy animation with a lot of

00:11:44.069 --> 00:11:44.079
very bouncy animation with a lot of
 

00:11:44.079 --> 00:11:46.910
very bouncy animation with a lot of
oscillations before it finally settles

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:46.920
oscillations before it finally settles
 

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:49.559

in addition to bouncing to dance

00:11:49.559 --> 00:11:49.569
in addition to bouncing to dance
 

00:11:49.569 --> 00:11:51.449
in addition to bouncing to dance
stamping ratio you can also change the

00:11:51.449 --> 00:11:51.459
stamping ratio you can also change the
 

00:11:51.459 --> 00:11:53.280
stamping ratio you can also change the
stiffness for the spring which will

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:53.290
stiffness for the spring which will
 

00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:55.439
stiffness for the spring which will
control how quickly the object would

00:11:55.439 --> 00:11:55.449
control how quickly the object would
 

00:11:55.449 --> 00:11:58.769
control how quickly the object would
return to its resting position and we'll

00:11:58.769 --> 00:11:58.779
return to its resting position and we'll
 

00:11:58.779 --> 00:12:01.350
return to its resting position and we'll
take a look at that in a moment now

00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:01.360
take a look at that in a moment now
 

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:04.109
take a look at that in a moment now
before you start the animation we can

00:12:04.109 --> 00:12:04.119
before you start the animation we can
 

00:12:04.119 --> 00:12:05.819
before you start the animation we can
also set some starting conditions for

00:12:05.819 --> 00:12:05.829
also set some starting conditions for
 

00:12:05.829 --> 00:12:08.819
also set some starting conditions for
the animations for example if we set the

00:12:08.819 --> 00:12:08.829
the animations for example if we set the
 

00:12:08.829 --> 00:12:12.059
the animations for example if we set the
star value to 200 this animation will go

00:12:12.059 --> 00:12:12.069
star value to 200 this animation will go
 

00:12:12.069 --> 00:12:15.090
star value to 200 this animation will go
from the translation Y of 200 back to

00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:15.100
from the translation Y of 200 back to
 

00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:18.840
from the translation Y of 200 back to
zero and also we can set the start

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:18.850
zero and also we can set the start
 

00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:21.449
zero and also we can set the start
velocity to match the existing movement

00:12:21.449 --> 00:12:21.459
velocity to match the existing movement
 

00:12:21.459 --> 00:12:24.329
velocity to match the existing movement
of the object creating a continuous

00:12:24.329 --> 00:12:24.339
of the object creating a continuous
 

00:12:24.339 --> 00:12:27.749
of the object creating a continuous
motion we can also set the min value and

00:12:27.749 --> 00:12:27.759
motion we can also set the min value and
 

00:12:27.759 --> 00:12:30.179
motion we can also set the min value and
Max value like we did the first fling

00:12:30.179 --> 00:12:30.189
Max value like we did the first fling
 

00:12:30.189 --> 00:12:32.669
Max value like we did the first fling
animation and and define the range for

00:12:32.669 --> 00:12:32.679
animation and and define the range for
 

00:12:32.679 --> 00:12:37.249
animation and and define the range for
the animation now we're ready to start

00:12:37.249 --> 00:12:37.259
the animation now we're ready to start
 

00:12:37.259 --> 00:12:40.289
the animation now we're ready to start
so let's take a look at the stiffness

00:12:40.289 --> 00:12:40.299
so let's take a look at the stiffness
 

00:12:40.299 --> 00:12:43.799
so let's take a look at the stiffness
from low to high here we have if you

00:12:43.799 --> 00:12:43.809
from low to high here we have if you
 

00:12:43.809 --> 00:12:46.530
from low to high here we have if you
look on the very left when the SIF is

00:12:46.530 --> 00:12:46.540
look on the very left when the SIF is
 

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:49.650
look on the very left when the SIF is
very low that the spring compresses

00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:49.660
very low that the spring compresses
 

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:52.229
very low that the spring compresses
rather slowly after is stretched out of

00:12:52.229 --> 00:12:52.239

na would instead expect a custom spring
 

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:47.900

careful experimentation and you may ask

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:02.640
careful experimentation and you may ask
 

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:05.000
careful experimentation and you may ask
why do we want to use a custom spring

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:05.010
why do we want to use a custom spring
 

00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:07.130
why do we want to use a custom spring
force instead of the built in spring

00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:07.140
force instead of the built in spring
 

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:10.610
force instead of the built in spring
force and the answer is by creating a

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:10.620
force and the answer is by creating a
 

00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:12.440
force and the answer is by creating a
custom spring force we can then share

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:12.450
custom spring force we can then share
 

00:15:12.450 --> 00:15:15.200
custom spring force we can then share
this spring force across all the spring

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:15.210
this spring force across all the spring
 

00:15:15.210 --> 00:15:18.140
this spring force across all the spring
animations for the children no this is

00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:18.150

only viable when all the spring

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:21.030
only viable when all the spring
 

00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:24.050
only viable when all the spring
animations here expects the same spring

00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:24.060
animations here expects the same spring
 

00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:25.240

resting position and finally we can say

00:15:30.490 --> 00:15:30.500
resting position and finally we can say
 

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:33.069

said the star value of the rotation

00:15:33.069 --> 00:15:33.079
said the star value of the rotation
 

00:15:33.079 --> 00:15:35.650
said the star value of the rotation
animation to minus 25 so the each head

00:15:35.650 --> 00:15:35.660
animation to minus 25 so the each head
 

00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:37.809
animation to minus 25 so the each head
was rotated from a minus 25 degree angle

00:15:37.809 --> 00:15:37.819
was rotated from a minus 25 degree angle
 

00:15:37.819 --> 00:15:40.300
was rotated from a minus 25 degree angle
and then oscillate around the zero

00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:40.310
and then oscillate around the zero
 

00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:46.949
and then oscillate around the zero
degree and eventually come to a stop

00:15:46.949 --> 00:15:46.959
 
 

00:15:46.959 --> 00:15:49.480
 
now that we've rotated each individual

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:49.490
now that we've rotated each individual
 

00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:51.160
now that we've rotated each individual

00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:54.340
head we still need to slide this whole
lesson now we can do that by creating a

00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:54.350
lesson now we can do that by creating a
 

00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:57.280
lesson now we can do that by creating a

configure the spring constants here
 

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:06.790
configure the spring constants here
we're going to use the same spring

00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:06.800
we're going to use the same spring
 

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:09.429
we're going to use the same spring
constants as we did before and finally

00:16:09.429 --> 00:16:09.439
constants as we did before and finally
 

00:16:09.439 --> 00:16:11.230
constants as we did before and finally
we're going to set the star value so

00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:11.240
we're going to set the star value so
 

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:13.619
we're going to set the star value so
that the translation Y would start from

00:16:13.619 --> 00:16:13.629
that the translation Y would start from
 

00:16:13.629 --> 00:16:20.920
that the translation Y would start from
400 and then slide back into place so

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:20.930
400 and then slide back into place so
 

00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:24.009
400 and then slide back into place so

00:17:28.570 --> 00:17:28.580
the view group would probably get down
 

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:31.270
the view group would probably get down
that change to all those children in

00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:31.280
that change to all those children in
 

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:33.789
that change to all those children in
both the skill X property and scale Y

00:17:33.789 --> 00:17:33.799
both the skill X property and scale Y
 

00:17:33.799 --> 00:17:36.880
both the skill X property and scale Y
property and I guess we can just animate

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:36.890
property and I guess we can just animate
 

00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:38.590
property and I guess we can just animate
this one child scale for the

00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:38.600
this one child scale for the
 

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:41.919
this one child scale for the
viewgroup and then we're done even

00:17:41.919 --> 00:17:41.929
viewgroup and then we're done even
 

00:17:41.929 --> 00:17:43.450
viewgroup and then we're done even
though new group doesn't really have

00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:43.460
though new group doesn't really have
 

00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:45.310
though new group doesn't really have
this property we can create one for is

00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:45.320
this property we can create one for is
 

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:47.020
this property we can create one for is
here we're going to create a custom

00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:47.030
here we're going to create a custom
 

00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:50.010
here we're going to create a custom
property using full property comp ads

00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:50.020
property using full property comp ads
 

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:53.169
property using full property comp ads
and we're going to have to override the

00:17:53.169 --> 00:17:53.179
and we're going to have to override the
 

00:17:53.179 --> 00:17:58.630
and we're going to have to override the
set value and get value whenever the

00:17:58.630 --> 00:17:58.640
set value and get value whenever the
 

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:00.520
set value and get value whenever the
child skill changes we will receive this

00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:00.530
child skill changes we will receive this
 

00:18:00.530 --> 00:18:03.460
child skill changes we will receive this
serve a legal call back and in that like

00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:03.470
serve a legal call back and in that like
 

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:05.320
serve a legal call back and in that like
we mentioned we're going to pass down

00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:05.330
we mentioned we're going to pass down
 

00:18:05.330 --> 00:18:07.210
we mentioned we're going to pass down
the change to all the children and then

00:18:07.210 --> 00:18:07.220
the change to all the children and then
 

00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:08.950
the change to all the children and then
change their skill X and skill Y

00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:08.960
change their skill X and skill Y
 

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:13.750
change their skill X and skill Y
property uniformly and you know get

00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:13.760
property uniformly and you know get
 

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:17.950
property uniformly and you know get
value well since we're assuming all the

00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:17.960
value well since we're assuming all the
 

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:19.720
value well since we're assuming all the
children have the same skill we can just

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:19.730
children have the same skill we can just
 

00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:22.120
children have the same skill we can just
return the skill of any any child in

00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:22.130
return the skill of any any child in
 

00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:23.590
return the skill of any any child in
this case we'll just return the first

00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:23.600
this case we'll just return the first
 

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:28.149
this case we'll just return the first
child now that we've created this custom

00:18:28.149 --> 00:18:28.159
child now that we've created this custom
 

00:18:28.159 --> 00:18:29.919
child now that we've created this custom
property we can put it in an animation

00:18:29.919 --> 00:18:29.929
property we can put it in an animation
 

00:18:29.929 --> 00:18:33.190
property we can put it in an animation
so we're going to create an animation on

00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:33.200
so we're going to create an animation on
 

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:35.200
so we're going to create an animation on
the child scale property for the lives

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:35.210
the child scale property for the lives
 

00:18:35.210 --> 00:18:39.010
the child scale property for the lives
of beers and again we're going to set

00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:39.020
of beers and again we're going to set
 

00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:42.070
of beers and again we're going to set
the stiffness if you remember stiffeners

00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:42.080
the stiffness if you remember stiffeners
 

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:44.560
the stiffness if you remember stiffeners
changes how how quickly the object

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:44.570
changes how how quickly the object
 

00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:46.570
changes how how quickly the object
returned to its resting position here

00:18:46.570 --> 00:18:46.580
returned to its resting position here
 

00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:48.909
returned to its resting position here
because we want the scale change to be

00:18:48.909 --> 00:18:48.919
because we want the scale change to be
 

00:18:48.919 --> 00:18:51.159
because we want the scale change to be
more graceful we want to use a low

00:18:51.159 --> 00:18:51.169
more graceful we want to use a low
 

00:18:51.169 --> 00:18:53.799
more graceful we want to use a low
stiffness and finally we're going to set

00:18:53.799 --> 00:18:53.809
stiffness and finally we're going to set
 

00:18:53.809 --> 00:18:56.950
stiffness and finally we're going to set
a minimum visible change and this is the

00:18:56.950 --> 00:18:56.960
a minimum visible change and this is the
 

00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:59.320
a minimum visible change and this is the
method that we haven't seen before what

00:18:59.320 --> 00:18:59.330
method that we haven't seen before what
 

00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:01.510
method that we haven't seen before what
it does is it provides the animation

00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:01.520
it does is it provides the animation
 

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:04.060
it does is it provides the animation
system and hints as to when it would be

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:04.070
system and hints as to when it would be
 

00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:06.159
system and hints as to when it would be
a good time to stop so that the

00:19:06.159 --> 00:19:06.169
a good time to stop so that the
 

00:19:06.169 --> 00:19:07.690
a good time to stop so that the
animation doesn't go on for too long

00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:07.700
animation doesn't go on for too long
 

00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:09.640
animation doesn't go on for too long
without making any visible change on

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:09.650
without making any visible change on
 

00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:13.480
without making any visible change on
screen and the reason 100 we haven't

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:13.490
screen and the reason 100 we haven't
 

00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:15.430
screen and the reason 100 we haven't
seen those methods before in all these

00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:15.440
seen those methods before in all these
 

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:17.680
seen those methods before in all these
previous examples is because up until

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:17.690
previous examples is because up until
 

00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:20.500
previous examples is because up until
this example we had animated only the

00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:20.510
this example we had animated only the
 

00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:23.140
this example we had animated only the
filthy and view properties and when we

00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:23.150
filthy and view properties and when we
 

00:19:23.150 --> 00:19:25.210
filthy and view properties and when we
use it when we animate filty and view

00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:25.220
use it when we animate filty and view
 

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:27.399
use it when we animate filty and view
properties the animation system can

00:19:27.399 --> 00:19:27.409
properties the animation system can
 

00:19:27.409 --> 00:19:30.549
properties the animation system can
derive such a value from based on which

00:19:30.549 --> 00:19:30.559
derive such a value from based on which
 

00:19:30.559 --> 00:19:32.440
derive such a value from based on which
animated which property is being

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:32.450
animated which property is being
 

00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:35.140
animated which property is being
animated

00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:35.150
 
 

00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:38.590
 
he receives of if you create a custom

00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:38.600
he receives of if you create a custom
 

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:41.500
he receives of if you create a custom
property you will need to provide the

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:41.510
property you will need to provide the
 

00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:43.450
property you will need to provide the
smallest change in your custom property

00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:43.460
smallest change in your custom property
 

00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:45.010
smallest change in your custom property
that can make a visible difference

00:19:45.010 --> 00:19:45.020
that can make a visible difference
 

00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:49.149
that can make a visible difference
on-screen in our case we're animating

00:19:49.149 --> 00:19:49.159
on-screen in our case we're animating
 

00:19:49.159 --> 00:19:51.610
on-screen in our case we're animating
cow scale which is essentially of

00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:51.620
cow scale which is essentially of
 

00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:53.560
cow scale which is essentially of
a skill property so we're going to use

00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:53.570
a skill property so we're going to use
 

00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:58.090
a skill property so we're going to use
the already defined constant musical

00:19:58.090 --> 00:19:58.100
the already defined constant musical
 

00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:01.480
the already defined constant musical
change scale and then we get set the

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:01.490
change scale and then we get set the
 

00:20:01.490 --> 00:20:05.200
change scale and then we get set the
star value to 0.5 so the scale animation

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:05.210
star value to 0.5 so the scale animation
 

00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:07.600
star value to 0.5 so the scale animation
starts from a half scale and then and

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:07.610
starts from a half scale and then and
 

00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:10.390
starts from a half scale and then and
then blow up and then eventually you

00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:10.400
then blow up and then eventually you
 

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:12.790
then blow up and then eventually you
know it will settle a scale of 1 it's

00:20:12.790 --> 00:20:12.800
know it will settle a scale of 1 it's
 

00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:17.230
know it will settle a scale of 1 it's
normal size so we've talked about swing

00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:17.240
normal size so we've talked about swing
 

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:19.660
normal size so we've talked about swing
animations we've also seen some cool

00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:19.670
animations we've also seen some cool
 

00:20:19.670 --> 00:20:23.230
animations we've also seen some cool
effects from the spring animations let's

00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:23.240
effects from the spring animations let's
 

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:25.090
effects from the spring animations let's
see what we can create by combining

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:25.100
see what we can create by combining
 

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:30.340
see what we can create by combining
these two here we're going to use the

00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:30.350
these two here we're going to use the
 

00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:34.030
these two here we're going to use the
same example as we did our sim list as

00:20:34.030 --> 00:20:34.040
same example as we did our sim list as
 

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:36.640
same example as we did our sim list as
we did for the swing animation as you

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:36.650
we did for the swing animation as you
 

00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:38.260
we did for the swing animation as you
can see I'm playing the flips back and

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:38.270
can see I'm playing the flips back and
 

00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:41.230
can see I'm playing the flips back and
forth but as the sling animation gets to

00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:41.240
forth but as the sling animation gets to
 

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:43.060
forth but as the sling animation gets to
the end of the list there's still some

00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:43.070
the end of the list there's still some
 

00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:44.470
the end of the list there's still some
velocity loves there's still some

00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:44.480
velocity loves there's still some
 

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:48.160
velocity loves there's still some
remaining energy and Delta when the list

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:48.170
remaining energy and Delta when the list
 

00:20:48.170 --> 00:20:51.549
remaining energy and Delta when the list
starts to stretch out and snap back like

00:20:51.549 --> 00:20:51.559
starts to stretch out and snap back like
 

00:20:51.559 --> 00:20:55.960
starts to stretch out and snap back like
a rubber band this is a very playful way

00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:55.970
a rubber band this is a very playful way
 

00:20:55.970 --> 00:20:58.450
a rubber band this is a very playful way
for to dissipate the remaining energy

00:20:58.450 --> 00:20:58.460
for to dissipate the remaining energy
 

00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:01.360
for to dissipate the remaining energy
when arriving at the end of the list and

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:01.370
when arriving at the end of the list and
 

00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:03.100
when arriving at the end of the list and
I think you'll agree with me this is a

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:03.110
I think you'll agree with me this is a
 

00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:05.140
I think you'll agree with me this is a
much better experience than harshly

00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:05.150
much better experience than harshly
 

00:21:05.150 --> 00:21:07.330
much better experience than harshly
stopping the motion and losing all the

00:21:07.330 --> 00:21:07.340
stopping the motion and losing all the
 

00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:11.020
stopping the motion and losing all the
momentum in order to achieve this we

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:11.030
momentum in order to achieve this we
 

00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:13.240
momentum in order to achieve this we
first need a fling animation and we're

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:13.250
first need a fling animation and we're
 

00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:14.470
first need a fling animation and we're
going to just use the same swing

00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:14.480
going to just use the same swing
 

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:18.460
going to just use the same swing
animation as we did before except this

00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:18.470
animation as we did before except this
 

00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:20.890
animation as we did before except this
time I'm going to call out to send Mia

00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:20.900
time I'm going to call out to send Mia
 

00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:23.290
time I'm going to call out to send Mia
value and set max value please define

00:21:23.290 --> 00:21:23.300
value and set max value please define
 

00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:25.930
value and set max value please define
the range of the animation like we

00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:25.940
the range of the animation like we
 

00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:28.180
the range of the animation like we
mentioned before but this range ensures

00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:28.190
mentioned before but this range ensures
 

00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:30.280
mentioned before but this range ensures
that the swing animation would end

00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:30.290
that the swing animation would end
 

00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:33.100
that the swing animation would end

now before we start we still need to
 

00:23:02.570 --> 00:23:04.570
now before we start we still need to
configure one last name which is the

want the stretching to go the same way
 

00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:21.460
want the stretching to go the same way
as the scrolling direction so when the

well that requires us to pin the list on

00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:31.430
well that requires us to pin the list on
 

00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:34.810
well that requires us to pin the list on
its left side and we can do so by said

00:23:34.810 --> 00:23:34.820
its left side and we can do so by said
 

00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:38.650
its left side and we can do so by said

the pivot X to 0 similarly when the list
 

00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:40.990
the pivot X to 0 similarly when the list
is growing to the left so want to pin

00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:41.000
is growing to the left so want to pin
 

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.090
is growing to the left so want to pin
the list on his right side and we can do

00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:43.100
the list on his right side and we can do
 

00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:46.150
the list on his right side and we can do
so by set the pivot point to the right

00:23:46.150 --> 00:23:46.160
so by set the pivot point to the right
 

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:49.150
so by set the pivot point to the right
side of the list which is the width of

00:23:49.150 --> 00:23:49.160
side of the list which is the width of
 

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:57.250

something that's more advanced and more
 

00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:07.900
something that's more advanced and more
complex if we'll build on top of that

00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:07.910
complex if we'll build on top of that
 

00:24:07.910 --> 00:24:14.920
complex if we'll build on top of that
such as chin springs here we have three

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:14.930
such as chin springs here we have three
 

00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:17.020
such as chin springs here we have three

and the other two views would follow as

00:24:28.270 --> 00:24:28.280
and the other two views would follow as
 

00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:31.030
and the other two views would follow as
the top view is moving around as if the

00:24:31.030 --> 00:24:31.040
the top view is moving around as if the
 

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:32.530
the top view is moving around as if the
three of them were attached to each

00:24:32.530 --> 00:24:32.540
three of them were attached to each
 

00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:35.980
three of them were attached to each
other by a bungee cord now let's take a

let's first take a look at how we can

00:24:58.690 --> 00:24:58.700
let's first take a look at how we can
 

00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:01.960
let's first take a look at how we can
have a follow the lead so first we're

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:01.970
have a follow the lead so first we're
 

00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:05.910
have a follow the lead so first we're
going to create animations for a on its

going to create animations for a on its
 

00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:07.840
going to create animations for a on its
translation X and translation Y

moobs leave you around we're going to

00:25:17.890 --> 00:25:17.900
moobs leave you around we're going to
 

00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:20.970
moobs leave you around we're going to
first for you move event we're going to

00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:20.980
first for you move event we're going to
 

00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:23.380
first for you move event we're going to
compare this event against the last

00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:23.390
compare this event against the last
 

00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:25.600
compare this event against the last
event in terms of positions and though

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:25.610
event in terms of positions and though
 

00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:27.730

if we calculate the Delta and just felt

00:25:27.730 --> 00:25:27.740
if we calculate the Delta and just felt
 

00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:29.380
if we calculate the Delta and just felt
how it would be the amount of movement

00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:29.390
how it would be the amount of movement
 

00:25:29.390 --> 00:25:32.020
how it would be the amount of movement
of the finger and then we're going to

00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:32.030
of the finger and then we're going to
 

00:25:32.030 --> 00:25:34.060
of the finger and then we're going to
apply the Delta to the B's wheels

00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:34.070
apply the Delta to the B's wheels
 

00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:36.010
apply the Delta to the B's wheels

what's the easiest position is updated

00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:41.990
what's the easiest position is updated
 

00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:44.860
what's the easiest position is updated
one updates the position of or the

following the lead and here we're going
 

00:25:50.150 --> 00:25:52.780
following the lead and here we're going
to use a method called enemy to final

00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:52.790
to use a method called enemy to final
 

00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:54.280
to use a method called enemy to final
position and we haven't seen this method

00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:54.290
position and we haven't seen this method
 

00:25:54.290 --> 00:25:59.140
position and we haven't seen this method
before they asked one of two ways if the

00:25:59.140 --> 00:25:59.150
before they asked one of two ways if the
 

00:25:59.150 --> 00:26:02.260
before they asked one of two ways if the
animation is not yet started this method

00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:02.270
animation is not yet started this method
 

00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:04.330
animation is not yet started this method
would set the final position for the

00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:04.340
would set the final position for the
 

00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:07.240
would set the final position for the
animation and start the animation if the

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:07.250
animation and start the animation if the
 

00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:09.190
animation and start the animation if the
animation is already started it's

00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:09.200
animation is already started it's
 

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:12.100
animation is already started it's
already running then this method is just

00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:12.110
already running then this method is just
 

00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:14.370
already running then this method is just
update the final position for the

00:26:14.370 --> 00:26:14.380
update the final position for the
 

00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:18.640
update the final position for the
animation and what this means is every

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:18.650
animation and what this means is every
 

00:26:18.650 --> 00:26:21.670
animation and what this means is every
time we receive a move events we're

00:26:21.670 --> 00:26:21.680
time we receive a move events we're
 

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:24.490
time we receive a move events we're
going to move the lead view and then if

00:26:24.490 --> 00:26:24.500
going to move the lead view and then if
 

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:27.580
going to move the lead view and then if
a is that resting position we're going

00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:27.590
a is that resting position we're going
 

00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:29.710
a is that resting position we're going
to start an animation to move a towards

00:26:29.710 --> 00:26:29.720
to start an animation to move a towards
 

00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:32.470
to start an animation to move a towards
the V view if the a is already animating

00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:32.480
the V view if the a is already animating
 

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:34.600
the V view if the a is already animating
then we're going to update a final

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:34.610
then we're going to update a final
 

00:26:34.610 --> 00:26:37.300
then we're going to update a final
position so that if you remember in one

00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:37.310
position so that if you remember in one
 

00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:40.650
position so that if you remember in one
of the earlier earlier flies the way

00:26:40.650 --> 00:26:40.660
of the earlier earlier flies the way

value change they would eventually after

00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:46.430
value change they would eventually after
 

00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:48.280
value change they would eventually after
some course corrections it would

00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:48.290
some course corrections it would
 

00:26:48.290 --> 00:26:50.140
some course corrections it would
eventually head towards the leave you

00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:50.150
eventually head towards the leave you
 

00:26:50.150 --> 00:26:53.560
eventually head towards the leave you
and this is how we achieve having a

00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:53.570
and this is how we achieve having a
 

00:26:53.570 --> 00:26:56.770
and this is how we achieve having a
follow the lead and finally we're going

00:26:56.770 --> 00:26:56.780
follow the lead and finally we're going
 

00:26:56.780 --> 00:26:58.690
follow the lead and finally we're going
to update the last position for the

00:26:58.690 --> 00:26:58.700
to update the last position for the
 

00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:00.430
to update the last position for the
motion event for the stealth hawk

00:27:00.430 --> 00:27:00.440
motion event for the stealth hawk
 

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:04.870
motion event for the stealth hawk
calculation now let's take a look at how

00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:04.880
calculation now let's take a look at how
 

00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:09.640
calculation now let's take a look at how
we can have the follow a similarly we're

00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:09.650
we can have the follow a similarly we're
 

00:27:09.650 --> 00:27:15.250
we can have the follow a similarly we're
going to create animations for B and in

00:27:15.250 --> 00:27:15.260
going to create animations for B and in
 

00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:16.810
going to create animations for B and in
order to get notified whatever a

00:27:16.810 --> 00:27:16.820
order to get notified whatever a
 

00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:19.450
order to get notified whatever a
position is changed we need this home

00:27:19.450 --> 00:27:19.460
position is changed we need this home
 

00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:21.040
position is changed we need this home
animation update listener and we're

00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:21.050
animation update listener and we're
 

00:27:21.050 --> 00:27:23.590
animation update listener and we're
gonna add the listener to the A to C

00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:23.600
gonna add the listener to the A to C
 

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:26.750
gonna add the listener to the A to C
then it's wave animation

00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:26.760
then it's wave animation
 

00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:29.280
then it's wave animation
in the Elm animation update callback

00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:29.290
in the Elm animation update callback
 

00:27:29.290 --> 00:27:31.710
in the Elm animation update callback
we're going to receive AZ animation and

00:27:31.710 --> 00:27:31.720
we're going to receive AZ animation and
 

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:35.010
we're going to receive AZ animation and
then face position and is velocity we're

00:27:35.010 --> 00:27:35.020
then face position and is velocity we're
 

00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:36.240
then face position and is velocity we're
going to do the same trick here we're

00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:36.250
going to do the same trick here we're
 

00:27:36.250 --> 00:27:39.630
going to do the same trick here we're
going to call anim to final position so

00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:39.640
going to call anim to final position so
 

00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:45.420
going to call anim to final position so
if B is not moving at the moment in then

00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:45.430
if B is not moving at the moment in then
 

00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:47.010
if B is not moving at the moment in then
we would set the final position friend

00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:47.020
we would set the final position friend
 

00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:49.140
we would set the final position friend
and start the animation to move it

00:27:49.140 --> 00:27:49.150
and start the animation to move it
 

00:27:49.150 --> 00:27:51.900
and start the animation to move it
towards a or if B is already moving

00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:51.910
towards a or if B is already moving
 

00:27:51.910 --> 00:27:53.370
towards a or if B is already moving
we're going to update its final position

00:27:53.370 --> 00:27:53.380
we're going to update its final position
 

00:27:53.380 --> 00:28:01.770
we're going to update its final position
so eventually heads were they um so the

00:28:01.770 --> 00:28:01.780
so eventually heads were they um so the
 

00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:03.810
so eventually heads were they um so the
physics place in emissions is available

00:28:03.810 --> 00:28:03.820
physics place in emissions is available
 

00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:08.720
physics place in emissions is available
now you support like 26 feet of one and

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:08.730
now you support like 26 feet of one and
 

00:28:08.730 --> 00:28:11.400
now you support like 26 feet of one and
you can use it by adding this dependency

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:11.410
you can use it by adding this dependency
 

00:28:11.410 --> 00:28:14.040
you can use it by adding this dependency
to your Gradle file and it's backward

00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:14.050
to your Gradle file and it's backward
 

00:28:14.050 --> 00:28:23.820
to your Gradle file and it's backward
compatible to API 16

00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:26.710
 
and I'm very excited to see what you

00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:26.720
and I'm very excited to see what you
 

00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:39.810
and I'm very excited to see what you
guys can come up with using this library

00:28:39.810 --> 00:28:39.820
 
 

00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:41.920
 
awesome so that was the cool new stuff

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:41.930
awesome so that was the cool new stuff
 

00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:44.440
awesome so that was the cool new stuff
but what if you're still using the cool

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:44.450
but what if you're still using the cool
 

00:28:44.450 --> 00:28:48.640
but what if you're still using the cool
old stuff so that's what I'm here for

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:48.650
old stuff so that's what I'm here for
 

00:28:48.650 --> 00:28:51.550
old stuff so that's what I'm here for
so animator set there was long requested

00:28:51.550 --> 00:28:51.560
so animator set there was long requested
 

00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:53.350
so animator set there was long requested
functionality in terms of being able to

00:28:53.350 --> 00:28:53.360
functionality in terms of being able to
 

00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:55.540
functionality in terms of being able to
seek within an animation as well as

00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:55.550
seek within an animation as well as
 

00:28:55.550 --> 00:28:57.040
seek within an animation as well as
reverse we have this in the value

00:28:57.040 --> 00:28:57.050
reverse we have this in the value
 

00:28:57.050 --> 00:28:59.710
reverse we have this in the value
animator API but not in animator sets

00:28:59.710 --> 00:28:59.720
animator API but not in animator sets
 

00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:03.310
animator API but not in animator sets
because it was difficult to do so now we

00:29:03.310 --> 00:29:03.320
because it was difficult to do so now we
 

00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:05.200
because it was difficult to do so now we
have these capabilities and I'll show a

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:05.210
have these capabilities and I'll show a
 

00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:07.690
have these capabilities and I'll show a
simple demo and some codes that's not

00:29:07.690 --> 00:29:07.700
simple demo and some codes that's not
 

00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:10.990
simple demo and some codes that's not
written in Collin and you can see how to

00:29:10.990 --> 00:29:11.000
written in Collin and you can see how to
 

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.760
written in Collin and you can see how to
do that so there's a famous quote that I

00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:12.770
do that so there's a famous quote that I
 

00:29:12.770 --> 00:29:14.260
do that so there's a famous quote that I
think everybody probably knows seek and

00:29:14.260 --> 00:29:14.270
think everybody probably knows seek and
 

00:29:14.270 --> 00:29:15.940
think everybody probably knows seek and
you shall find it turns out that this

00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:15.950
you shall find it turns out that this
 

00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:18.730
you shall find it turns out that this
was taken out of context the full quote

00:29:18.730 --> 00:29:18.740
was taken out of context the full quote
 

00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:20.650
was taken out of context the full quote
goes something like this thinking you

00:29:20.650 --> 00:29:20.660
goes something like this thinking you
 

00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:23.080
goes something like this thinking you
shall find that there is no seek API on

00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:23.090
shall find that there is no seek API on
 

00:29:23.090 --> 00:29:26.380
shall find that there is no seek API on
animator set right it's nobody knew that

00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:26.390
animator set right it's nobody knew that
 

00:29:26.390 --> 00:29:29.800
animator set right it's nobody knew that
but I'm here to tell you that also it

00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:29.810
but I'm here to tell you that also it
 

00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:32.050
but I'm here to tell you that also it
turns out that there's no way to reverse

00:29:32.050 --> 00:29:32.060
turns out that there's no way to reverse
 

00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:35.380
turns out that there's no way to reverse
it but we did some things about that and

00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:35.390
it but we did some things about that and
 

00:29:35.390 --> 00:29:37.330
it but we did some things about that and
I'm going to show you how you can use

00:29:37.330 --> 00:29:37.340
I'm going to show you how you can use
 

00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:39.100
I'm going to show you how you can use
that functionality so here we have a

00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:39.110
that functionality so here we have a
 

00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:41.890
that functionality so here we have a
really simple rather lame demo what I

00:29:41.890 --> 00:29:41.900
really simple rather lame demo what I
 

00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:44.590
really simple rather lame demo what I
want to do given this amazingly complex

00:29:44.590 --> 00:29:44.600
want to do given this amazingly complex
 

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:46.750
want to do given this amazingly complex
UI is move those three buttons around on

00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:46.760
UI is move those three buttons around on
 

00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:48.670
UI is move those three buttons around on
the screen when the user clicks on the

00:29:48.670 --> 00:29:48.680
the screen when the user clicks on the
 

00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:50.560
the screen when the user clicks on the
various controls there so in particular

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:50.570
various controls there so in particular
 

00:29:50.570 --> 00:29:52.330
various controls there so in particular
when you play the animation I want the

00:29:52.330 --> 00:29:52.340
when you play the animation I want the
 

00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:53.770
when you play the animation I want the
button on top to move to the right the

00:29:53.770 --> 00:29:53.780
button on top to move to the right the
 

00:29:53.780 --> 00:29:56.380
button on top to move to the right the
button in the middle should move down to

00:29:56.380 --> 00:29:56.390
button in the middle should move down to
 

00:29:56.390 --> 00:29:57.430
button in the middle should move down to
the right and the button on the bottom

00:29:57.430 --> 00:29:57.440
the right and the button on the bottom
 

00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:59.530
the right and the button on the bottom
should move straight down so the button

00:29:59.530 --> 00:29:59.540
should move straight down so the button
 

00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:01.120
should move straight down so the button
when it moves to the right you create an

00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:01.130
when it moves to the right you create an
 

00:30:01.130 --> 00:30:02.800
when it moves to the right you create an
object animator fairly straightforward

00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:02.810
object animator fairly straightforward
 

00:30:02.810 --> 00:30:05.140
object animator fairly straightforward
we're going to animate translation X and

00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:05.150
we're going to animate translation X and
 

00:30:05.150 --> 00:30:06.310
we're going to animate translation X and
we're going to move it all the way over

00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:06.320
we're going to move it all the way over
 

00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:08.710
we're going to move it all the way over
until its positions all the way over on

00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:08.720
until its positions all the way over on
 

00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:10.300
until its positions all the way over on
the right the bottom of the button in

00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:10.310
the right the bottom of the button in
 

00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:11.620
the right the bottom of the button in
the middle we're going to move it to the

00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:11.630
the middle we're going to move it to the
 

00:30:11.630 --> 00:30:13.630
the middle we're going to move it to the
lower right similarly we create an

00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:13.640
lower right similarly we create an
 

00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:15.280
lower right similarly we create an
object animator we can use property

00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:15.290
object animator we can use property
 

00:30:15.290 --> 00:30:16.930
object animator we can use property
values holder so that we can animate X

00:30:16.930 --> 00:30:16.940
values holder so that we can animate X
 

00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:19.150
values holder so that we can animate X
and y at the same time inside the same

00:30:19.150 --> 00:30:19.160
and y at the same time inside the same
 

00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:21.340
and y at the same time inside the same
single object animator so we're doing

00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:21.350
single object animator so we're doing
 

00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:23.170
single object animator so we're doing
translation X and translation Y in

00:30:23.170 --> 00:30:23.180
translation X and translation Y in
 

00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:25.570
translation X and translation Y in
parallel and finally the button on the

00:30:25.570 --> 00:30:25.580
parallel and finally the button on the
 

00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:26.710
parallel and finally the button on the
bottom is going to move all the way to

00:30:26.710 --> 00:30:26.720
bottom is going to move all the way to
 

00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:29.590
bottom is going to move all the way to
the bottom of the screen similarly to

00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:29.600
the bottom of the screen similarly to
 

00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:31.300
the bottom of the screen similarly to
the one at the top it's going to animate

00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:31.310
the one at the top it's going to animate
 

00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:33.280
the one at the top it's going to animate
translation Y all the way down to the

00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:33.290
translation Y all the way down to the
 

00:30:33.290 --> 00:30:35.840
translation Y all the way down to the
bottom so we create these things

00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:35.850
bottom so we create these things
 

00:30:35.850 --> 00:30:37.490
bottom so we create these things
and then we create the animator set that

00:30:37.490 --> 00:30:37.500
and then we create the animator set that
 

00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:39.529
and then we create the animator set that
contains these child animations we're

00:30:39.529 --> 00:30:39.539
contains these child animations we're
 

00:30:39.539 --> 00:30:40.850
contains these child animations we're
going to run them in sequence so it's

00:30:40.850 --> 00:30:40.860
going to run them in sequence so it's
 

00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:42.620
going to run them in sequence so it's
going to go top middle bottom so we'll

00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:42.630
going to go top middle bottom so we'll
 

00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:44.390
going to go top middle bottom so we'll
play those sequentially and then we

00:30:44.390 --> 00:30:44.400
play those sequentially and then we
 

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:46.310
play those sequentially and then we
start the animation which looks

00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:46.320
start the animation which looks
 

00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:49.789
start the animation which looks
something like this I bet you couldn't

00:30:49.789 --> 00:30:49.799
something like this I bet you couldn't
 

00:30:49.799 --> 00:30:51.350
something like this I bet you couldn't
guess what was going to happen there so

00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:51.360
guess what was going to happen there so
 

00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:53.090
guess what was going to happen there so
you press the play button animation

00:30:53.090 --> 00:30:53.100
you press the play button animation
 

00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:54.980
you press the play button animation
plays fairly straightforward that's what

00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:54.990
plays fairly straightforward that's what
 

00:30:54.990 --> 00:30:58.700
plays fairly straightforward that's what
you could do already but what happens if

00:30:58.700 --> 00:30:58.710
you could do already but what happens if
 

00:30:58.710 --> 00:31:00.020
you could do already but what happens if
we actually want to seek within the

00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:00.030
we actually want to seek within the
 

00:31:00.030 --> 00:31:02.090
we actually want to seek within the
animation well now we call this new

00:31:02.090 --> 00:31:02.100
animation well now we call this new
 

00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:04.960
animation well now we call this new
method called set current playtime so

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:04.970
method called set current playtime so
 

00:31:04.970 --> 00:31:08.000
method called set current playtime so
we've hooked this up to the seek bar at

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:08.010
we've hooked this up to the seek bar at
 

00:31:08.010 --> 00:31:10.010
we've hooked this up to the seek bar at
the top so when we get a call back into

00:31:10.010 --> 00:31:10.020
the top so when we get a call back into
 

00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:12.169
the top so when we get a call back into
the on progress change method we can see

00:31:12.169 --> 00:31:12.179
the on progress change method we can see
 

00:31:12.179 --> 00:31:16.390
the on progress change method we can see
where the seek bar is in that in that

00:31:16.390 --> 00:31:16.400
where the seek bar is in that in that
 

00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:19.549
where the seek bar is in that in that
track that it's in and interpret that as

00:31:19.549 --> 00:31:19.559
track that it's in and interpret that as
 

00:31:19.559 --> 00:31:21.620
track that it's in and interpret that as
a percentage of movement and then apply

00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:21.630
a percentage of movement and then apply
 

00:31:21.630 --> 00:31:24.440
a percentage of movement and then apply
that to the animator set animation so

00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:24.450
that to the animator set animation so
 

00:31:24.450 --> 00:31:26.480
that to the animator set animation so
set current play time using that

00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:26.490
set current play time using that
 

00:31:26.490 --> 00:31:28.610
set current play time using that
percentage multiplied times the total

00:31:28.610 --> 00:31:28.620
percentage multiplied times the total
 

00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:31.880
percentage multiplied times the total
duration that the animation has so we

00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:31.890
duration that the animation has so we
 

00:31:31.890 --> 00:31:33.770
duration that the animation has so we
have this get total duration method on

00:31:33.770 --> 00:31:33.780
have this get total duration method on
 

00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:35.690
have this get total duration method on
animator set we get that multiplied

00:31:35.690 --> 00:31:35.700
animator set we get that multiplied
 

00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:38.240
animator set we get that multiplied
times a percentage and away we go

00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:38.250
times a percentage and away we go
 

00:31:38.250 --> 00:31:39.700
times a percentage and away we go
so we drag it around on the screen

00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:39.710
so we drag it around on the screen
 

00:31:39.710 --> 00:31:42.289
so we drag it around on the screen
buttons move all the child animations

00:31:42.289 --> 00:31:42.299
buttons move all the child animations
 

00:31:42.299 --> 00:31:43.880
buttons move all the child animations
are moving independently depending on

00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:43.890
are moving independently depending on
 

00:31:43.890 --> 00:31:46.520
are moving independently depending on
where we seek in the animator set

00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:46.530
where we seek in the animator set
 

00:31:46.530 --> 00:31:49.070
where we seek in the animator set
animation itself all right and then

00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:49.080
animation itself all right and then
 

00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:52.039
animation itself all right and then
finally but you couldn't guess how this

00:31:52.039 --> 00:31:52.049
finally but you couldn't guess how this
 

00:31:52.049 --> 00:31:53.810
finally but you couldn't guess how this
is going to work what if we want to

00:31:53.810 --> 00:31:53.820
is going to work what if we want to
 

00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:55.520
is going to work what if we want to
reverse the animation so the user clicks

00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:55.530
reverse the animation so the user clicks
 

00:31:55.530 --> 00:31:58.130
reverse the animation so the user clicks
on the reverse button and everything

00:31:58.130 --> 00:31:58.140
on the reverse button and everything
 

00:31:58.140 --> 00:32:01.220
on the reverse button and everything
moves in Reverse very straight forwards

00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:01.230
moves in Reverse very straight forwards
 

00:32:01.230 --> 00:32:03.770
moves in Reverse very straight forwards

and get the capabilities that you want a
couple of notes on that one is that it

00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:20.890
couple of notes on that one is that it
 

00:32:20.890 --> 00:32:22.470
couple of notes on that one is that it
will specifically seek within child

00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:22.480
will specifically seek within child
 

00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:24.990
will specifically seek within child
animations that are a value animator

00:32:24.990 --> 00:32:25.000
animations that are a value animator
 

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.970
animations that are a value animator
because if it's not a value animator or

00:32:26.970 --> 00:32:26.980
because if it's not a value animator or
 

00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:30.450
because if it's not a value animator or
an animator set we're not sure how to

00:32:30.450 --> 00:32:30.460
an animator set we're not sure how to
 

00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:33.630
an animator set we're not sure how to
how to reverse or seek that thing right

00:32:33.630 --> 00:32:33.640
how to reverse or seek that thing right
 

00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:35.250
how to reverse or seek that thing right
so if your child animation is just an

00:32:35.250 --> 00:32:35.260
so if your child animation is just an
 

00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:36.930
so if your child animation is just an
animator it's this opaque thing that

00:32:36.930 --> 00:32:36.940
animator it's this opaque thing that
 

00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:38.490
animator it's this opaque thing that
you've implemented we're not sure what

00:32:38.490 --> 00:32:38.500
you've implemented we're not sure what
 

00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:39.720
you've implemented we're not sure what
to do about it that will get dropped on

00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:39.730
to do about it that will get dropped on
 

00:32:39.730 --> 00:32:41.280
to do about it that will get dropped on
the floor or you can implement that

00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:41.290
the floor or you can implement that
 

00:32:41.290 --> 00:32:43.770
the floor or you can implement that
functionality but it's really

00:32:43.770 --> 00:32:43.780
functionality but it's really
 

00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:45.390
functionality but it's really
specifically for the common case of

subclass of that another thing to note

00:32:50.010 --> 00:32:50.020
subclass of that another thing to note
 

00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:53.220
subclass of that another thing to note
is there is new on animations start and

00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:53.230
is there is new on animations start and
 

00:32:53.230 --> 00:32:55.320
is there is new on animations start and
on animation and callbacks in the

on animation and callbacks in the
 

00:32:55.330 --> 00:32:56.790
on animation and callbacks in the
interface default methods that we

interface default methods that we
 

00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:59.460
interface default methods that we
implemented that will then provide you

00:32:59.460 --> 00:32:59.470
implemented that will then provide you
 

00:32:59.470 --> 00:33:01.730

when your starting and ending it's
 

00:33:04.210 --> 00:33:05.940
when your starting and ending it's
useful if you know what direction you're

useful if you know what direction you're
 

00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:07.410
useful if you know what direction you're
running in given the new capabilities

00:33:07.410 --> 00:33:07.420
running in given the new capabilities
 

00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:10.410
running in given the new capabilities
that animator set has so you can access
