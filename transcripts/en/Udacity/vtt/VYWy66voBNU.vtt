00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.290
The first metric of interest
is Net Promoter Score or NPS.

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:10.590
NPS is a customer loyalty metric that is
determined by asking users one question.

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.070
On a scale of zero to ten, how likely
are you to recommend this product or

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:16.890
service to a friend.

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.763
Customers who respond with
a number between zero and

00:00:19.763 --> 00:00:22.060
six are called your detractors.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.379
Customers who score seven or
eight are your passives, and

00:00:25.379 --> 00:00:28.840
anyone ranking with a nine or
ten is a promoter.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.080
And to actually calculate your NPS you
take their percent of promoters and

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.170
then subtract out
the percent of detractors.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.950
This actually means that NPS can fall
between negative 100 and positive 100.

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.960
You could, for example, have everyone
vote you between zero and six.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.930
A good Net Promoter Score
will vary by industry.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.360
As you can tell from this chart,
many industries have a wide range for

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.130
net promoter scores.

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.100
And you can see their averages in
these squares along the graph.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.260
If you'd like to take
a closer look at this chart,

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.890
you can refer to it in
the instructor notes.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.030
Click Through Rate is another metric
that you'll find associated with website

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.550
buttons, links, and e-mail campaigns.

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.560
With CTR, you're measuring whether or
not a user took action.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.630
CTRs are helpful for

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.290
determining how customers advance
through steps of a purchase.

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.450
For example, one checkout flow
could be on Udacity's website.

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.350
We could collect data on how
many users check out a homepage,

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:27.320
go to a description page for a product,
how many clicked to start a free trial,

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.280
and how many actually completed the
payment information form to register for

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.910
that free trial.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.600
Daily active users, or DAU,
is another common metric, and

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.680
it can take on multiple meanings.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.040
The trickiest part is defining what
active means for your product.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.380
It could be as simple as logging in,
performing specific tasks, or

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.040
making a purchase,
depending on your business.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.380
You can track the number of users
over time, and you'll likely see some

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.740
variation from day to day, maybe even
a plateau, and then hopefully you'll see

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.600
an uptick where you get a lot
of adoptions from new users.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.290
By relating product launches,
new features, press releases, and

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.860
even market research to this data,
you can get a sense for

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.430
what might be driving your traffic.

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.670
These next three metrics
are similar to daily active users.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.640
Except you're tracking active users,

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.750
in whichever way you define active
over some defined period of time.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.590
So instead of having daily active users,
you might have weekly active users,

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.030
or monthly active users.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.230
Here's a bar chart showing monthly
active users for WhatsApp.

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.490
WhatsApp is a popular mobile
messaging application.

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.230
Now, you might be wondering why
some of these bars are missing, and

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.090
it's just because the source of
the data didn't have this information.

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.930
It'd probably be better to show this
as a line chart over time, but I

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.070
didn't want to give the impression that
these points were actually in the data.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.550
To calculate any x day active users,
you simply total the number of

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.330
unique users who initiated
sessions on your website or

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.760
mobile application from a starting date
all the way until the ending date.

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.260
You might also look at
patterns over weekday or

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.540
weekend activity to spot trends.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.060
For example, Twitter determined that if
a user opened Twitter seven times in one

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.970
month then the user
was likely to return.

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.550
By attracting active users and
possibly what features they use,

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:20.420
you might determine what is
driving users back to the product.

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.760
And finally,
another useful metric is retention.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.870
It's the opposite of churn or attrition.

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.900
Retention describes the number or

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.980
the percent of users you keep
over a certain period of time.

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.050
While not counting any new users you
acquired during that same time interval.

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:40.420
Now, this example wouldn't really be
that great, because I'm only keeping,

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.520
let's say,
about 1% of my users after 12 weeks.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.390
Even better,
you can monitor cohorts of users

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.580
based on when they start
using the product or service.

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.580
For example, you can create retention
curves for two groups of users.

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.300
Let's say one group of users
starts on January 1st,

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.020
while the other starts on January 8th.

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.920
To learn more about cohort analysis,
check out this article

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.550
on Nir Ariel's blog,
which is linked in the instructor notes.

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.470
The article discusses how to measure
retention and use cohort analysis,

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.770
while looking at user retention for
Pinterest and Twitter.

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:16.510
Now, these are some of
the common baseline metrics.

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.709
And whatever metric you choose,
the metric needs to signal

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.540
that users are using
the product in an expected way,

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:27.060
and that the same users are likely to
come back and use the product more.

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.920
This certainly isn't every
metric that you might want, but

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.140
these are some common ones that
you'll use in most products.

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.090
In the next video,
we'll look at a framework for

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:36.770
how you can come up with other metrics.
