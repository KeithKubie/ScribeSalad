1
00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:02,510
The word hit us

2
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:08,400
like you're hit with the, with them.

3
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:12,150
[inaudible]

4
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:16,420
and we're like, that cannot be
art. That cannot be our son.

5
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:20,400
I'm Janet and Ron. I'm Robert Krulwich.

6
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:25,700
Radiolab in our story today begins with
a boy and that boy a is going to vanish.

7
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:30,300
Not In the thin air, but to a place
that we know very, very little about.

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,860
And if you're the parent of that boy,

9
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,910
what do you do if your child is
falling away from everything you know,

10
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,100
how do you find him?
How do you get him back?

11
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:41,400
So part of this tale we got from
Ron SAS kinds, new, wonderful book,

12
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:45,210
life animated. And some of you may have
heard it, some not. Let's start. Where,

13
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:46,550
uh, were Ron started, uh,

14
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:50,850
for him it began around 1993 and uh,

15
00:00:50,851 --> 00:00:52,080
and it was an exciting time.

16
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:55,740
Well, we're going into Owens around for,

17
00:00:55,741 --> 00:00:59,840
what is his last night
in the crib? Nike's.

18
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:05,010
I still can't, you still can't watch it.

19
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,570
Can you tell us about your crib
own? Do you like your crib?

20
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,470
Yeah. Do you know where
you're sleeping tomorrow?

21
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,020
What kind of better you and
Walter going to sleep. Then

22
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:21,240
in 1993, this last guy and family decided
to make a big move run and his wife,

23
00:01:21,241 --> 00:01:24,960
Cornelia, Cornelia Suskind and
their two sons, Walt and Owen.

24
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:29,430
Walter is about five and
Owen is about two and a half.

25
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:33,250
They decide to relocate from
Boston to Washington DC. You know,

26
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:35,670
I had the senior National
Affairs job at the Journal.

27
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:40,880
Can I say Navy night? Kind
of a dream job. I love you.

28
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,810
Lots of excitement. Have a
nice last night near Cribby.

29
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:50,160
So they make the move and as soon
as they arrive in Washington,

30
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:55,230
we start sort of noticing something's
amiss. Their youngest son, Owen,

31
00:01:55,231 --> 00:01:57,840
who to that point had been
a totally normal chatty,

32
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,570
almost three year olds hitting
all of his markers. Suddenly

33
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:01,780
it goes sideways.

34
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,590
Maybe the very first thing that
happened was he stopped sleeping.

35
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:11,200
He stopped sleeping, he stopped
eating. He was very fussy initially.

36
00:02:11,201 --> 00:02:13,390
They figured, well, it's
gotta be the move. Um,

37
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:18,340
and then we start losing eye contact.
Then he starts losing motor skills.

38
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:22,510
He can hold his cup
slipping out of his hand.

39
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,960
His gait became very odd. Um,

40
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:30,970
and he was sort of looked like a drunken
sailor walking around the house and

41
00:02:30,971 --> 00:02:34,930
then he stopped speaking
bit by bit by bit.

42
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:39,300
This is all compressed into a few
months. A few months. Really. Yeah.

43
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:40,770
What could have occurred,

44
00:02:40,771 --> 00:02:44,280
could he have banged his head than
just did something toxic? You know,

45
00:02:44,281 --> 00:02:46,740
first you hit the regular
pediatrician and he's gone. No,

46
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:51,280
they sent us to a center. There was a
woman there who sits them down and uh,

47
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,990
she says the word autism. What did
the word mean to you at that moment?

48
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:59,770
It meant rain, man,
Dustin. I'm a good driver.

49
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,890
Until we saw and were
like, that cannot be our,

50
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:05,770
that cannot be our son.

51
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:12,060
You know, it was just terrifying.
Now in reporting this story,

52
00:03:12,061 --> 00:03:14,700
we ended up going off in a
variety of different directions,

53
00:03:14,701 --> 00:03:18,960
but we did visit one place where we
got a glimpse, just the here and again,

54
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:23,790
what parents like Ron and
Cornelia must have felt back then.

55
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,310
We visited a school here in
Manhattan called the Rebecca School.

56
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:32,460
It's a really unique school
for children with autism,

57
00:03:32,461 --> 00:03:34,080
other developmental delays.

58
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:38,940
There's little kids in their h four all
the way up to I think even 21 every kid

59
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:42,030
that you meet in the school is
different. Autism is a many,

60
00:03:42,031 --> 00:03:43,020
many flavored things,

61
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:48,000
but the overwhelming sense you get walking
the halls there is that each of these

62
00:03:48,001 --> 00:03:49,710
kids is kind of

63
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:56,650
locked away a little bit. Just
they don't know how to be with.

64
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:58,883
Okay.

65
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,860
Like Kelsey paget and I, we got there
during lunch and one of the rooms,

66
00:04:01,861 --> 00:04:04,620
I don't know, maybe you should
describe this. Yeah, there was this,

67
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,700
we went to this one classroom
where there was this,

68
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:10,720
this one boy who really stood out. He
was about six years old and he had this,

69
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,300
this big mob of uh,

70
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:17,110
black hair and he was just
standing there at the table holding

71
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:22,990
an apple apple, you want
to eat that and just

72
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,740
sobbing when you eat your apple,

73
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:32,160
you don't want to eat the apple woo woo.

74
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:36,850
And the director of the
school, Tina McCort,

75
00:04:36,851 --> 00:04:40,780
she was there and she just stayed with
the boy and really like tried to be there

76
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:42,870
with him, but there was
nothing she could do.

77
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:52,450
[inaudible] goes apple. We
don't want to say with heron,

78
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,060
it was hard to walk.

79
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,103
Okay.

80
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:03,070
Because you don't know how to help.

81
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:04,623
Oh,

82
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:08,980
so that's the challenge, right?

83
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:14,290
There's a kid who actually can't tell
you what's upsetting to them, right?

84
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:18,730
That's guilt hippy. The school's clinical
director could be that he physically,

85
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:22,940
he actually doesn't know where he is in
space. Maybe if that's, if we were being

86
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:26,630
drone out of an airplane,
right? You're just tumbling.

87
00:05:26,631 --> 00:05:29,270
You don't know where your body
is a, it's a thunderstorm.

88
00:05:29,271 --> 00:05:31,520
So you only see things in flashes. Right?

89
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:36,170
So now the world is totally
frightening. It's totally overwhelming.

90
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:43,720
I mean, I do remember the drive home from
that, from that terrible day. I don't,

91
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:48,050
I blocked that out. Well, just,
I mean I just remember, you know,

92
00:05:48,051 --> 00:05:53,051
you and I driving home in silence with
Owen in the back and I just felt like,

93
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:57,020
you know, there was no, there's no,

94
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:03,740
like they had no idea if the Owen they
knew was in there or if he was just kind

95
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,030
of lost to them, like gone.

96
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:10,170
Now keep in mind this was 1994, uh,

97
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,450
we knew even less about
autism than we know now.

98
00:06:12,451 --> 00:06:14,190
We still have no idea what causes autism.

99
00:06:14,191 --> 00:06:17,970
But then the prevailing wisdom
seemed to be that kids with autism,

100
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:22,230
they couldn't feel emotion. They had no
capacity to empathize with other people.

101
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,570
This was way before the
neurodiversity movement,

102
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:28,500
like actually right around the moment
when autism was becoming a spectrum for

103
00:06:28,501 --> 00:06:29,070
the first time.

104
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:33,090
That's just happening in 1994 just
starting, barely starting. Yeah.

105
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:37,470
At that point Owen was Belfour, was
he active or was he always very,

106
00:06:37,471 --> 00:06:41,520
he was hyperactive. A lot of self
stimulatory behavior, you know,

107
00:06:41,521 --> 00:06:44,030
hand flapping, running around and uh,

108
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,050
Cornelia and Ron say that
when they would call him,

109
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:49,620
it was as if he didn't even hear them.
We're hoping he's hearing, you know,

110
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:53,630
but he's not really responding when
you needed him to come to the table,

111
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:56,970
we basically have to go and
lead him by the hand and,

112
00:06:57,090 --> 00:07:01,830
or pick them up and bring them over.
Huh. And he was down to one word,

113
00:07:01,831 --> 00:07:02,940
which was juice.

114
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,380
So the only thing he was doing was
drinking juice for about a year. And also,

115
00:07:07,381 --> 00:07:09,090
you know, there was the Disney movies,

116
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:16,900
so he would sit for, he would sit
for, and for television entertainment.

117
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:19,560
He wouldn't sit for the whole
movie for sure, but he would,

118
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:24,800
that would be the one thing that he would
sit for quietly for periods I'd been

119
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,720
through because he didn't sleep.

120
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:31,440
So at night I was usually
up with him all night,

121
00:07:31,441 --> 00:07:35,700
thrashing around and it's Owen Watch
one Disney movie after another after

122
00:07:35,701 --> 00:07:38,550
another, not sleeping
at all. That word juice.

123
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:41,970
It seemed to expand just a little bit.
He began to repeat the word juice.

124
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,180
Servos, juice Servos, juicer vose wait,

125
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:47,990
so is he saying juicer foes to service
two through five but you don't know what

126
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,840
first what that is? No, no, we think
it's juice. Cornelia's like I said,

127
00:07:51,841 --> 00:07:55,290
does he seem to want more juice? And
she's like, no, I gave him more juicy,

128
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,130
didn't seem to want it.

129
00:07:56,130 --> 00:08:00,510
And Ron says he would say that word over
and over for weeks and they had no idea

130
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:05,511
what it meant until he was about a year
or in a month after the symptoms have

131
00:08:05,961 --> 00:08:07,250
started. One night,

132
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,400
all four of them are together in the
living room and we're watching the little

133
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:14,460
mermaid, I'm dot. Not My bed does say.

134
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:17,300
And at a certain point,
oh, who's got the remote?

135
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,390
He starts rewinding the
movie back a little bit.

136
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:23,570
The lady was with to rewatch
the scene. That's typical.

137
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:24,800
So I will knows that her work,

138
00:08:24,801 --> 00:08:29,570
the remote while kind of showed him how
to do it and he took to that and he's

139
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:33,860
rewinding the part where Ariel,
hi, become human or protagonist,

140
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,050
I'll never be with my
father's sisters again.

141
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,880
Wants to become human to get
her man Eric. That's right.

142
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:42,800
And the see which Ursula
[inaudible] says it will,

143
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:47,610
it will cost you tough choices
and the prices are voice,

144
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:52,250
your voice, my voice.
You've got it. Sweet cakes.

145
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:55,620
And then all of a sudden
Ariel and first solar

146
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,930
and this park, the three land again,

147
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:06,660
again, no day.

148
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:12,400
It's like, oh and stop.
Rewinding. Just play the movie.

149
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:17,460
I won't leave after the third rewind.

150
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:20,510
Critical. He says, oh,

151
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,530
[inaudible],

152
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:28,460
well it's not juice does
not choose. It's just, ah.

153
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,880
I said, what? Just your voice?
At which point I'm like,

154
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:36,630
I grabbed the shoulders and I'm like,
just your voice. Just your voice.

155
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:39,540
And he can stay. It's called
juicer, vose juicer, juicer.

156
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:44,550
Rose and Walters are jumping in the
bed crying and laughing and [inaudible]

157
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:47,980
jumping to the feeling you chose that
phrase for a reason. Oh, that's what we,

158
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:50,140
that's of course
immediately what we thought.

159
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:52,320
He's trying to tell us
something that like,

160
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:56,860
he has things to say but he
just can't say it's his voice.

161
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:01,570
In other words, he's in there, he's in
there because he's trying to talk to us.

162
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:06,160
So we run to the doctor, very trusted
guy and he's like, ah, you know,

163
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:09,780
sit down, let's talk. And he
says something called Echolalia.

164
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:13,260
It's echoing sounds that
their auditory processing,

165
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:17,640
their ability to process sound
speech by inquiry goes haywire.

166
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,560
And so they just repeat the sound and
we've seen so he doesn't know what it

167
00:10:22,561 --> 00:10:27,540
means. And he's like, probably not
echolalia. It's what it sounds like.

168
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:32,070
Echo what it sounds like. Echo. I said
like a parrot. They're like, yeah, yeah,

169
00:10:32,071 --> 00:10:32,904
a parrot.

170
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:37,210
So we go from Helen Keller
to the pet store parrot.

171
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:37,980
Okay.

172
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:41,640
Life goes on and years go by

173
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:43,870
where he's murmuring a lot of jibberish.

174
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:46,990
We might be able to
decipher from some movie,

175
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:52,390
maybe by six he's got, you
know, three words, sentences.

176
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:54,550
I want juice, just, you know,

177
00:10:54,551 --> 00:10:57,460
one and a half year old
speech corns there full time.

178
00:10:57,461 --> 00:11:01,250
24 seven Ron's working around
the clock in a kind of frenzy.

179
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:03,970
It pay for all of the therapists
and we're fighting it out.

180
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,920
Basically they see tiny,
tiny bits of progress,

181
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:10,630
but no more breakthroughs

182
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:16,770
until the ones about six and a half and
Walt is nine and Walter gets a little

183
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:20,260
emotional in his ninth birthday.

184
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:24,680
I'm not sure, maybe the anxiety of
the moment of the attention of it.

185
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,390
This is Walt Suskind. And
how old are you now? Well,

186
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:30,500
I'm 25 your voice is so much
deeper than I imagined it would be.

187
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:31,543
People usually have,

188
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,433
they're like 10 minutes.

189
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:35,830
If it's their first time meeting
me asks if I'm faking my voice,

190
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:39,190
I'd have to assure them
this is not in effect.

191
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,000
This is how I sound. Any case,

192
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,820
Walt has his ninth birthday
and his friends come over

193
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:50,890
and then after the party he's out in
the hammock in the yard and he's kind of

194
00:11:50,891 --> 00:11:52,960
crying a little bit and as

195
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:57,130
it was, right, they were just
kind of strange days for me,

196
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:02,580
like sensory overload in a way and walks
in after Walter is emotional and we're

197
00:12:03,911 --> 00:12:08,200
in the kitchen and he seems to kind of
look back and forth between the two of us

198
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:12,340
in like there's something he
wants to say to this point,

199
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:16,690
Owen had only said three word sentences,
but in this moment, according to Ron,

200
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,100
he looks at us and says,

201
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:19,520
[inaudible]

202
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:24,520
Walter doesn't want to grow up like
Mowgli or a Peter Pan said full sentences,

203
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:30,330
full thing, whole thing. Wow.

204
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,730
I mean literally it
was like a thunderbolt,

205
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:37,350
a lightning bolt went through the
kitchen and Owen goes, runs off in some,

206
00:12:37,351 --> 00:12:39,270
you know, reverie, whatever.

207
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:44,280
And we look at each other and like
the luck that was that, you know,

208
00:12:44,281 --> 00:12:48,390
this is his first complex sense
or thought that's been expressed.

209
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:50,340
And it's a subtle one actually.

210
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:52,740
Cause he's taking three different
characters to from a movie,

211
00:12:52,741 --> 00:12:56,500
one from real life. And he's putting
them together. Saran is like, ah,

212
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:57,420
I got to follow this.

213
00:12:57,421 --> 00:13:02,421
So he goes up to Owen's room and I see
Owen on the bed looking at a Disney book

214
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:07,600
and I see on the carpet are
some of his puppets and he,

215
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:11,890
and one of them is Jago
from a, from Aladdin,

216
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:16,210
the plush toy, you know, which is the
$98 one that goes up to your elbow.

217
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:18,820
And I grabbed it and I put it on,

218
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:24,120
on my arm right up to the elbow and I
crawl along in the rug and I throw the

219
00:13:24,131 --> 00:13:28,900
bedspread kind of over my head and
just edge up to the edge of the bed.

220
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,750
And I pushed the puppet up through
the crease in the bedspread.

221
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,450
And so now they're face to face,

222
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:40,120
Owen and Jago and I'm looking up
through the crease, sort of up my arm.

223
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:43,660
And I talked to him as Jago.

224
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:47,770
Now this is an easy voice. It's
Gilbert Gottfried's voice. I mean,

225
00:13:47,771 --> 00:13:51,940
anyone can do this. I say salt, I'll
wait, I'll wait. I'll wait. How,

226
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:54,280
how does it feel to be you?

227
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:57,100
And he turns to the puppet,

228
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:00,190
like he's a bumping into an old friend

229
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:05,650
and he says, oh, not good. Uh, I'm lonely.

230
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:10,900
And it was his voice. Wow. And so I say,

231
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:15,460
so when did, when did you and
I become such good friends?

232
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:20,320
And he says, when I watched the
Latin and you made me laugh,

233
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:25,720
and we go back and forth like this
for four or five more exchanges.

234
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:29,650
And then I hear Owen clear his
throat, like, are like that.

235
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:32,350
And then all of a sudden
I hear him say back,

236
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:37,390
I love the way all foul little
mind works. He said, what?

237
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:42,350
I love the way all FAO little mind
works. That's Jafar the villain.

238
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:46,850
Ya'll goes the villainous sidekick
to Jafar, the villain of the Latin.

239
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:51,140
That's Jeff. That's the next line from
Jafar youth lead into a square movie.

240
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:54,980
You're asking for me to respond as Jago.

241
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:58,970
Did you know the next time I didn't
know the next line at that point I just

242
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:02,300
jumped out from under the
bedspreads. What's going on?

243
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,850
Whoa.

244
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:08,830
I was glad to know. They felt like,
okay, he, he is, he is in there.

245
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:12,280
I mean despite everything that
they had been told about autism,

246
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:16,630
Owen was in there and somehow these
Disney characters are in there

247
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,800
with him. It doesn't take
us long that, you know,

248
00:15:19,801 --> 00:15:23,160
we start what we called the
basement sessions where we say to,

249
00:15:23,161 --> 00:15:24,630
let's see how far this can go.

250
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:28,470
Couple of times a week we go down in
the basement and start playing at scenes

251
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:31,170
and we do it the first time
we do it with the jungle book,

252
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,440
which is a movie he
was into at that point.

253
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:39,530
And then I did 101
Dalmatians down on the piece,

254
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:44,550
Peter Pan Towards the stone. So
will you, we kind of ran the gamut.

255
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,880
I mean pretty much we'd
watch any and every

256
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:50,980
Disney movie there was what?
Describe to these guys.

257
00:15:50,981 --> 00:15:55,981
What was the like when mom and I started
doing voices and Walter felt amazed.

258
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,680
Felt amazed. Who? Who was amazed?

259
00:15:59,681 --> 00:16:04,300
You were amazed or they was
amazed. This is Owen SAS Guide.

260
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:08,860
He's 23 now. Why were you
amazed? I was so surprised

261
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,590
by my family.

262
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:16,280
I could hear them respond better.

263
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:19,790
You're saying that when, when everybody
was acting out the Disney movies,

264
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:24,050
suddenly you could hear
them better, right?

265
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:30,030
So when people wouldn't talk to you,
not in the Disney movies, do you,

266
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:32,580
what do you remember
about how they sounded

267
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:39,750
a little weird? Yeah.
Jibberish and rubbish.

268
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:42,960
Huh? Do you remember how you felt?

269
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:48,690
A little worried. You told
mom once that you were scared.

270
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,980
I was scared.

271
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,020
Okay.

272
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:54,810
Why did it feel good to watch
them over and over again?

273
00:16:54,811 --> 00:16:58,920
That you kept wanting to watch
them over and over again?

274
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:03,540
How did that feel to you? It felt
comforting. Comforting, felt comforting.

275
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:08,160
Why? Because it would help me with

276
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:11,970
reducing my autism.

277
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:19,040
How does a movie help a
boy in Owen's condition?

278
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:23,430
Stay tuned and we'll, we'll
attempt some explanations.

279
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,790
This is Candace currently
calling from her bicycle.

hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich,

296
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,100
Radiolab and today a story about a kid
named Owen and a condition that no one

297
00:18:31,101 --> 00:18:34,730
can quite pin down. Now
we just heard that Owen,

298
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,550
when he watches Disney movies,

299
00:18:37,551 --> 00:18:41,750
he feels comforted in that somehow the
movie seems to dial down his autism.

300
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:45,050
We're like, why would that be crazy next?

301
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:50,810
How could a Disney movie or any movie
really make that much difference?

302
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,560
Um, can you hear me okay?
I can really pretty well.

303
00:18:53,561 --> 00:18:57,130
I'm just gonna we ended up taking the
question to this guy, Simon Baron. Karin,

304
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:00,520
he's a leading researcher in
autism and yes, he is the cousin of

305
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:02,760
this guy is my wife

306
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:08,220
and I'm the director of the autism
research center at Cambridge Uni.

307
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:12,070
Bursty and Simon told us a couple
of different things. First of all,

308
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,200
he says that in the last few decades,

309
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:18,040
our whole notion of what is happening
in the mind of a child with autism has

310
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:22,180
totally changed. We've sort of
tossed out the rain man idea.

311
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,710
The idea that um,

312
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:27,430
people with autism lack some in our life.

313
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:29,560
I think that's completely false.

314
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:33,030
It's not necessarily that they
can't feel emotion or empathy.

315
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:35,730
It says not at all. It's
often a decoding problem.

316
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:39,210
Like they have trouble decoding all
of the information that's coming in.

317
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:42,840
I mean some studies have found that a lot
of kids with autism literally have too

318
00:19:42,841 --> 00:19:44,980
many synapses in their brain.

319
00:19:44,981 --> 00:19:47,700
So it might be the world
is just coming in too loud.

320
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:53,090
I think often people with autism
feel very lost and confused

321
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:59,690
as to a little predictability
in the social world. You know,

322
00:19:59,691 --> 00:20:03,770
people come and go, they that
no two days are the same.

323
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:07,460
People say things unexpectedly,
they do things unexpectedly.

324
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:13,310
Then people with autism who seem
to need a lot of predictability.

325
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,610
We spoke to temple granted, uh,

326
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:19,430
the well known author and autism
advocate and here's how she put it.

327
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:22,330
That was a little kid. I wanted to
feel the nice feeling of being held,

328
00:20:22,331 --> 00:20:27,100
but there was just too much overwhelming
stimulation. Your loud sounds hurt.

329
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:27,934
My years,

330
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:32,710
like the volume control on
touch and hearing was way, way,

331
00:20:32,711 --> 00:20:34,660
way turned on.

332
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:37,990
And one of the reasons why I withdrew
into things like dribbling sand to my

333
00:20:37,991 --> 00:20:42,250
hands is I could shut and
shut out the hurtful sound

334
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,300
as a temple grant and explained it to us.

335
00:20:44,301 --> 00:20:49,301
A kid with autism gravitating to
something like bus or knowing every single

336
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:51,430
effect about every
dinosaur that ever lived.

337
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:56,460
That is just a way to slow things down
and make the world predictable so that it

338
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:00,220
happens the same way every time.
And as Simon Baron Cohen puts it,

339
00:21:00,221 --> 00:21:03,280
in Owen's case, he had these Disney
movies that you could play Oh,

340
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:08,010
over and over and over and over.
And then the fact that it's,

341
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,290
you know, it's sad, it's
not just repetition,

342
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:13,170
but it's repetition about
human action. Jasmine,

343
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:16,280
where are you out in the
Menagerie? Hurry. Yeah.

344
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:21,290
That creates a kind of structure to
be able to look at human behavior.

345
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:25,740
You know, in the real world, there's
no opportunity to rewind the movie.

346
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,830
Whereas in the world of movies,

347
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:33,860
you can watch the same Disney cartoon
a hundred times or a thousand times and

348
00:21:34,231 --> 00:21:36,390
you can almost go frame by frame

349
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,740
like a literary critic or a film critic.

350
00:21:40,741 --> 00:21:45,060
You could really analyze the action to
understand, okay, that's what happened.

351
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,940
And that's, that's what
caused him to do what he did.

352
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,150
And to that, the element of Music

353
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:57,390
[inaudible] we spoke with a
professor, Geraldine Dawson,

354
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:00,210
a neuroscience professor at Duke who
guessed that maybe it's not just the

355
00:22:00,211 --> 00:22:04,320
repetition that made the difference,
but the repetition with music.

356
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:09,530
One of the things that we've learned
from neuroscience is that music activates

357
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:13,470
emotional centers in
our brain. And in fact,

358
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:18,030
it's pretty reliable that certain
kinds of music make us feel,

359
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:23,710
no frightened, make us feel happy,

360
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:28,510
make us feel worried and
so forth. Now she says,

361
00:22:28,511 --> 00:22:32,610
when scientists have done brain
scans of kids with autism, they found

362
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:35,670
that during kind of normal interactions,

363
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:39,720
people with autism don't necessarily
activate those emotional centers of the

364
00:22:39,721 --> 00:22:44,640
brain areas like the Amygdala.
But during the experience of music

365
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:46,733
[inaudible]

366
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,521
um, the,

367
00:22:47,521 --> 00:22:52,521
those areas of the brain did
become activated in a way
that was very much like a

368
00:22:53,701 --> 00:22:54,630
typical person.

369
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:59,130
So it might be that while Owen was sort
of forensically examining these moments

370
00:22:59,131 --> 00:22:59,964
of Disney movies,

371
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:04,890
it was the Disney music that was
binding those moments to feelings.

372
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,380
So we could know like, oh,
when a person looks like that,

373
00:23:07,381 --> 00:23:09,690
that's when they're happening
and the person looks like that.

374
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,860
That's when they're sad. However it works.

375
00:23:13,861 --> 00:23:16,230
Simon Baron Cohen thinks
it's at least plausible.

376
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:16,920
Okay.

377
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:21,920
Is He using the movie as a scaffold to
make sense of the much greater complexity

378
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:24,660
of natural life

379
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:27,530
and that's what got to run sky.

380
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:29,960
Wow.

381
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:34,130
This is a whole new planet here and maybe
this Disney ish therapy that they use

382
00:23:34,131 --> 00:23:38,240
with Owen might be a whole new approach
to treating kids with autism instead of

383
00:23:38,241 --> 00:23:42,080
the one size fits all model of the sit
in the class and here are the things

384
00:23:42,081 --> 00:23:44,840
you're supposed to know
to be a working member of.

385
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:50,680
Instead it's like go with their
passion, follow them in there. It's,

386
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:51,770
it's a pathway,

387
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:56,060
the brain finding a way to
get to what people need,

388
00:23:56,061 --> 00:23:59,000
which is interaction
and emotional wholeness.

389
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:05,280
You're, I want you to sing the
song for them. [inaudible] dessert.

390
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:08,750
Visco Grina it's about the this lake.

391
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:13,530
You're [inaudible] up there,
but that is a big mistake.

392
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:14,853
Just do a car too.

393
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:15,611
Over the years,

394
00:24:15,611 --> 00:24:18,940
sometimes down in the basement with the
family or sometimes even in doctor's

395
00:24:18,941 --> 00:24:21,520
offices, Owen started to improvise.

396
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:24,940
He'd go off script and use the characters.

397
00:24:24,941 --> 00:24:27,760
He knew so well to explain
how he was feeling.

398
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:31,080
I'll do the C. Dot.

399
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,510
But the Dow quid is with
the take for me. Yeah,

400
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:38,870
and as you were thinking about all this
and asking ourselves, you know newt,

401
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,590
well, right, if this
works with Disney movies,

402
00:24:40,591 --> 00:24:43,290
which are very emotional
and clear, what do you,

403
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:46,530
how do you do this with
paper clips or bus schedules?

404
00:24:46,531 --> 00:24:48,330
And as the questions kept coming,

405
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:53,910
we ran into inevitably a counter
reaction to run story and this,

406
00:24:53,911 --> 00:24:58,590
we didn't expect the story. It's
great. It's a wonderful story.

407
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:03,210
But the fact is most, I mean onto
the danger with a, with a book,

408
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:06,690
with any book including life animated,

409
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:11,840
is that it's going to give the impression
to a lot of people that this is the

410
00:25:11,971 --> 00:25:13,070
answer. You know?

411
00:25:13,071 --> 00:25:16,440
It's kind of what that psychologist and
journalist David Royko and he warned us

412
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:20,490
that like with autism we still don't
really know much and we don't have yet.

413
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:24,510
And a body of established science
and all the anecdotes you're hearing,

414
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:29,250
they're just anecdotes. If you've
known one person with autism,

415
00:25:29,251 --> 00:25:33,240
you've known one person with autism that
he says it's really all you can say and

416
00:25:33,241 --> 00:25:37,460
to take one person's experience and
generalize on it, it's a mistake. Okay.

417
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:41,790
A case in point, his son Ben Ben
is turning 21 years old today.

418
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:46,050
Oh my God. Happy Birthday
to him. Thanks. And uh, Yo,

419
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,870
Ben is never going to be
able to live independently.

420
00:25:48,871 --> 00:25:53,070
He's never going to have
what anyone considered would
consider a full and normal

421
00:25:53,071 --> 00:25:53,770
life.

422
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:57,640
Well, Ben has severe autism and is now
living in an assisted living facility.

423
00:25:57,670 --> 00:26:00,840
He was diagnosed around the same
age as Owen, same basic symptoms,

424
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,730
lack of eye contact, sudden loss of speech

425
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:09,300
with spinning wheels, with ceiling
fans, the whole, the whole package.

426
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:13,060
Dave says he and his wife tried every
therapy they could afford and a whole lot

427
00:26:13,061 --> 00:26:17,680
they couldn't, but Ben never had any
of those big breakthroughs. Instead,

428
00:26:17,681 --> 00:26:18,520
even as a teenager,

429
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:21,950
he would hit and he would scratch and
he would bite and he would punch and he

430
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:22,970
would kick. Honestly,

431
00:26:22,971 --> 00:26:26,540
I was always afraid when Karen and I
would end up having to go to the emergency

432
00:26:26,541 --> 00:26:28,130
room for some reason that, you know,

433
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:32,000
if they saw her arms that they would
arrest me because I would think I was some

434
00:26:32,001 --> 00:26:35,090
horribly abusive person because
their arms were nothing,

435
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:40,670
but they were covered with scabs
and scars and scars on scars.

436
00:26:40,671 --> 00:26:45,360
And on top of that, uh, you know,
there'd be the crap, like, like,

437
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:50,960
like know his pants. Yeah. I mean,
he, he's, he was not, well, you know,

438
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,140
I hate to say it,

439
00:26:52,141 --> 00:26:56,820
but here we are in his 21st birthday
and he's still not 100% reliable when it

440
00:26:56,821 --> 00:26:57,654
comes to the toileting.

441
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,251
And honestly,

442
00:26:58,251 --> 00:27:01,820
the reason we ended up calling Dave is
because he wrote a review of Ron's book

443
00:27:01,821 --> 00:27:03,410
where he said, basically,
it's a great book,

444
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:07,250
but it's just one more story
of a triumphant happy ending.

445
00:27:07,251 --> 00:27:08,390
And that is not the norm

446
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:12,180
for many, many people
who experience autism.

447
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:14,160
You don't have happy
endings. I mean, that's,

448
00:27:14,161 --> 00:27:18,720
that's a sad fact for many
of these families and we're
not expecting in our life

449
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,760
a a happy ending for Ben.

450
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:23,110
Oh,

451
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:26,080
people seem to believe that,

452
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:31,590
that it's dangerous for parents to
have too much hope because what if they

453
00:27:32,411 --> 00:27:36,040
really think it's possible for their
child to progress a huge amount or recover

454
00:27:36,041 --> 00:27:39,610
and then their child doesn't.
We have the other concern.

455
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,490
That's Ron Kaufman of the autism
treatment center of America.

456
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:46,180
We find that we're not afraid
of so-called false hope.

457
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:49,000
We're more concerned
about false pessimism.

458
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:55,230
And here's why. He says
that in 1981 Ron's dad,

459
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:58,290
Barry and don over with,
he sits down, yeah,

460
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:02,380
on a local TV show was a very young
Oprah Winfrey and he describes his

461
00:28:02,381 --> 00:28:03,520
experience. Okay.

462
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:08,410
We had a child who was diagnosed
as incurably ill or hopelessly ill,

463
00:28:08,411 --> 00:28:11,200
something called autism. He
tells how at a really young

464
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:16,330
age or year and a half old, his son
began to regress and began to flap hands,

465
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,350
lose eye contact, rock back and forth.
And then one day he, his wife decided,

466
00:28:20,351 --> 00:28:20,681
you know what,

467
00:28:20,681 --> 00:28:24,190
we're going to just sit down on the
bathroom floor right next to him and we're

468
00:28:24,191 --> 00:28:25,870
going to rock back and
forth just like him.

469
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:29,890
And he explains that they did
this over and over and over,

470
00:28:29,891 --> 00:28:34,891
hour after hour until one day his son
turned his head and he actually looked at

471
00:28:36,161 --> 00:28:39,250
us. It took 900 hours before

472
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:43,490
he ever gave us eye contact on his own.

473
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:46,790
When he looked at us, we cheered

474
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:53,590
whose cried this? That
was really big for us,

475
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:58,120
so somebody else might look
at us and say, you're crazy,

476
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,120
but we're not. We just
got this little boy,

477
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:03,910
took us 900 friggin hours,

478
00:29:03,911 --> 00:29:07,540
but he just looked at us
for three seconds. My God,

479
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:12,370
and he went from that to a little boy
now who functions on a near genius level

480
00:29:12,371 --> 00:29:16,320
who talks is communicative, is
loving, and is embracing awesome

481
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,860
and that little boy is run for me.

482
00:29:18,861 --> 00:29:23,861
It just felt like my mother was loving
me and enjoying me and playing with me.

483
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,190
Nowadays in interviews,

484
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:29,280
run seems to say that maybe his
parents cured him a lot too,

485
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:33,170
so I actually have never used the word
cure. I don't use that in my lectures.

486
00:29:33,171 --> 00:29:35,300
Youtube videos, no one's ever
actually heard me say that.

487
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:38,750
What I do say is full recovery,

488
00:29:38,751 --> 00:29:42,120
which is essentially the same thing,
the reason, whatever you call it. Armed

489
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,260
with his heroic story, Ron and his dad,

490
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:49,570
Barry now run an autism treatment program
that they call sunrise, s o n, right?

491
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:51,820
People come here from
all around the world.

492
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:56,620
Let's say my child is severely autistic
and I will sim smile and I'll put out my

493
00:29:56,621 --> 00:29:58,600
hand and I'll shake
their hand and I'll say,

494
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,250
I am so excited for you. Wow,

495
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:06,610
you are so blessed and you
know what they'll start to do?

496
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,440
They'll cry and I'll say, why are you
crying? No one ever said that to me.

497
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:15,480
You really say that to parents with a
severely like severely autistic kids.

498
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:17,190
Severely. I say it

499
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:18,660
all over the world.

500
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:21,950
You know, last year

501
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:28,860
there was a woman named Kelly Stapleton
who was a fairly prominent autism

502
00:30:29,361 --> 00:30:31,970
blogger and I got to know Kelly a bit.

503
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:35,380
She has a daughter with autism and
one day when her daughter was 14

504
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:39,990
she locked herself in a van with a
couple of charcoal burners and tried to

505
00:30:39,991 --> 00:30:41,970
commit suicide with her autistic daughter.

506
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:46,440
You see that in the world
of autism more than I,

507
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:48,540
I can't think of any
other place you see it.

508
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:52,360
Dave believes that one of the reasons
you see so many suicides in this

509
00:30:52,361 --> 00:30:55,780
community, and by the way there a
huge debate about this on the web,

510
00:30:56,050 --> 00:31:00,340
but he believes that one of the reasons
you see it so much is that all of these

511
00:31:00,341 --> 00:31:04,420
success stories seem to say to parents
like him did as hard as it can be in it

512
00:31:04,421 --> 00:31:08,200
can be really, really hard.
You're not trying hard enough.

513
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:12,230
It's depressing. You know, a,
a new bumper sticker, you know,

514
00:31:12,410 --> 00:31:14,050
that's shown up that uh,

515
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:19,220
autism is awesome and awesome spell like
a u s l m e like kind of like similar

516
00:31:19,801 --> 00:31:22,500
to autism. Um, no, you autism,

517
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:26,940
it destroys lives is what it
does in our definition of it.

518
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:29,470
And that's one of the
things that makes it very,

519
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:33,550
very confusing for people outside the
community to describe what's going on.

520
00:31:33,551 --> 00:31:38,551
Because you now have this situation where
obviously all autism is a spectrum and

521
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:43,300
so you have all of these different
kids described by the same word

522
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:48,760
making things even more confusing. Do
you take a child one there, two or three,

523
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:52,030
that's temple grand and again you're
going to have two kids that look real

524
00:31:52,031 --> 00:31:56,230
severe and I looked real severe
while I was when I was three real,

525
00:31:56,231 --> 00:31:59,140
real severe. And then
you work on these kids,

526
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,820
lots of one-on-one therapy and one kid
you kind of pull them out of it and the

527
00:32:03,821 --> 00:32:07,180
other one you're not able to pull them
out of it and they've all looked the same

528
00:32:07,181 --> 00:32:08,110
at h street.

529
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:12,660
So if a lot of these kids start out with
the same set of symptoms but they end

530
00:32:12,661 --> 00:32:15,360
up in vastly different
places, no one knows why.

531
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:21,110
Then as a parent you really have no idea
what is going to happen or how much you

532
00:32:24,031 --> 00:32:29,031
can dare to hope notions of what could
be up the road or what should be.

533
00:32:31,471 --> 00:32:35,460
Now if they pop into my head,
which is rare, I dismiss them.

534
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:40,160
I have absolutely no idea
because have been down

535
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:43,880
so many roads that were disappointing.

536
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:48,390
[inaudible]

537
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:50,700
and uh, that's next.

538
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:53,563
[inaudible]

539
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:58,040

And to continue with the story after
Owen's Disney basement sessions had really

547
00:33:29,061 --> 00:33:31,100
taken off in the Disney
therapy as it were,

548
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:35,630
seemed to be working and Owen was getting
better and better and better things

549
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:40,130
took a turn and, and not for the good.
Remind me how old he is at this point.

550
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:45,000
Uh, 14 1414. Yeah. Ninth. Ninth. Great.

551
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:51,040
Um, but it was 10th grade. Oh, right.
10th grade. I was it. Yeah, that's right.

552
00:33:51,041 --> 00:33:55,600
That's right. And what happened?
We didn't know what was happening.

553
00:33:55,630 --> 00:34:00,400
You know, we just saw over the months
at Owen was really out of sorts.

554
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:02,380
You got quiet, kind of withdrawn,

555
00:34:02,381 --> 00:34:05,800
basically stopped doing Disney over this
period. He's losing a lot of weight.

556
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:07,210
He's not sleeping.

557
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:10,780
The three of us were scratching our
heads saying what is going on with Owen?

558
00:34:10,781 --> 00:34:13,510
He is really moving into a bad place.

559
00:34:13,511 --> 00:34:17,500
I mean I was actually worried that
he was becoming schizophrenia.

560
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:18,380
Boy. Yeah,

561
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:21,590
I still think about that whole scenario
all the time cause we knew something was

562
00:34:21,591 --> 00:34:23,540
wrong with Owen and we
couldn't get it out of him.

563
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,640
This is Owen's older brother Walt again.

564
00:34:25,641 --> 00:34:29,240
And he says when he picked up Owen from
school, he was just a shell of himself.

565
00:34:29,241 --> 00:34:30,040
You'd talk to him.

566
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:33,590
So I'd pick him up and you've talked
himself in the car and it'd be no note or

567
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:36,170
you know, it's not true or
something under his breath.

568
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:41,270
And then at one point I overhear him
in a kind of conversation with Phil,

569
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:47,550
the sidekick of Hercules
in that movie, Hercules.

570
00:34:47,551 --> 00:34:52,140
Danny Devito does the voice. And
Phil is, you know, like saying kid,

571
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,780
you can take them, you know, you're
kind of stand up for yourself.

572
00:34:54,781 --> 00:34:57,660
That kind of thing that Owen
was saying and I didn't,

573
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,970
I didn't know where to
fit it in. Ron says,

574
00:34:59,971 --> 00:35:03,450
it seemed like Owen was trying to
psych himself up for something.

575
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:07,350
So he sat down with him on the couch
and he grilled them for an hour until

576
00:35:07,351 --> 00:35:10,600
eventually Owen told him about
his music class at school.

577
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:15,150
There are two kids in this class who
are Ed kids, emotionally disturbed kids.

578
00:35:15,151 --> 00:35:19,290
So they're not, they're not on the
autistic spectrum. And socially,

579
00:35:19,291 --> 00:35:23,040
they're very, um, on target and they,

580
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:24,570
um,

581
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:29,570
basically torment and terrorize him
for six months of that school year,

582
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:35,580
unbeknownst to us and
unbeknownst to the school. Um,

583
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:38,190
what did they do? They sat on either

584
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:42,120
side of him and basically said,
you know, we're going to kill you.

585
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:43,500
We're going to kill your parents.

586
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:48,560
And those two bullies
lied and bullied me badly.

587
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:50,581
I mean,

588
00:35:50,581 --> 00:35:54,540
right then you were in a very bad spot
and you couldn't tell me your mom or

589
00:35:54,541 --> 00:35:57,600
anyone, right? Because what
happened? The bully said, what?

590
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:02,820
Burn your house down if
what if you tell. Right.

591
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:06,960
And Owen was so literal, as
are so many autistic kids,

592
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:10,350
he believed that they literally
meant they were going to come in,

593
00:36:10,351 --> 00:36:11,800
burn his house down.

594
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:16,020
Then there's an extraordinary moment in
the middle of this where Walter picks

595
00:36:16,021 --> 00:36:20,430
him up and Owens starts to
think of, go through a calculus.

596
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:23,970
The bully said, if you tell
your parents about what we said,

597
00:36:23,971 --> 00:36:26,850
we'll burn your house down. But they
said nothing about your brother.

598
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,000
Ah,

599
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,040
and so he's, he sees like an opening.

600
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:36,790
Yeah. And so did you tell him no
I didn't. No, I didn't. I why?

601
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,480
Why not? Cause I'm afraid
he would beat them up.

602
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,520
I didn't want that,

603
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:46,780
Walter, at this point, you know,
as a football player and you know,

604
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:49,040
he looks like Hercules to Owen.

605
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:54,070
And Owen later describes to us this
thinking that if he tells Walter,

606
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:58,450
um, that Walter will, uh,

607
00:36:58,490 --> 00:37:02,000
hurt the kid and maybe killed a kid.

608
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:04,940
And in Disney,

609
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:08,690
none of the heroes actually
kill any of the villains.

610
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:13,420
No. Walter was the hero. You were
afraid he was going to do what?

611
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:17,980
Kill. Yeah, it's wrong. Did
you ever talk to Walt about it?

612
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:22,200
A little bit later after it happened,
I just remember finding out. Yeah.

613
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:27,220
And it was like a combination of
like rage and helplessness that

614
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:38,110
I literally just thought of what I
would've done to that kid if I'd,

615
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:46,550
if Owen had told me I really
wanted to kill that kid. I mean,

616
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:52,190
um, you know, um, I'm his protector

617
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:55,610
in a way. Your,

618
00:37:55,730 --> 00:38:00,570
you were kind of pre Walter was worried
about protecting you in that time. Yeah,

619
00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:05,060
in a way it was me that was doing what?

620
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:09,620
Protecting myself and who
else and my brother. Right.

621
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:13,520
And Wild on the wall.
You're protecting Walter.

622
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:18,950
So here you had this moment where it
looked like Owen was sliding backwards.

623
00:38:18,951 --> 00:38:22,790
But according to Ron, it might've
actually been his greatest leap forward.

624
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:27,730
His most profound moment
of empathy these days. Oh,

625
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:32,270
in his 23 just turned 23 a few months
ago. And Are you in love right now? Yes,

626
00:38:32,271 --> 00:38:35,010
I am. What the girl made dreams and Molly,

627
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:40,860
she and I graduated
from review last month.

628
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:46,380
This has been a three year program called
getting ready for the outside world

629
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:50,920
grow. Yeah. And so he'll be graduating
from the, from the entire program. Yup.

630
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:55,870
Yup. And often on sound. And now
me, her and our other two friends,

631
00:38:55,871 --> 00:39:00,871
John and Julie also go to school are all
gonna move and live up life and Hyannis

632
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:06,580
I think what his wife living in a
penalty forever. And what is it,

633
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,910
what kind of day to spend adult
independent living program

634
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:13,621
as we were talking,

635
00:39:13,621 --> 00:39:18,270
it was hard not to wonder how independent
will Owen be because that's the

636
00:39:18,271 --> 00:39:21,480
question that's in front of the
SAS guys now. Especially Walt.

637
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:25,250
I think what scares me sometimes is

638
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:26,903
okay,

639
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:31,950
kind of just having to go it alone in
a lot of ways and at the same time just

640
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:37,780
being there for,

641
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:43,710
sorry. Um,

642
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:51,840
there's some daunting things
ahead and um, you know,

643
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:56,220
I'll just have to be ready to
take these things on. Kind of

644
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:01,750
no wonder you don't like
birthdays. Makes Sense.

645
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:06,820
That makes clear, well,
it's a tough one. I mean,

646
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:09,520
well if there's like an, I said
to me at one point, he's like,

647
00:40:09,521 --> 00:40:12,790
is it always going to be
Disney? I mean, forever.

648
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:18,790
And I'm like, God, I know. Well, but
we talked, we talked to him about,

649
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:22,000
you know, about everything,
about, you know,

650
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:25,300
our will and who will be s you know,

651
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:27,370
how he figures into everything.

652
00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:31,410
All the efforts of what we're trying to
do and have been doing for all this time

653
00:40:31,411 --> 00:40:32,244
is to,

654
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:37,790
one of our favorite movies is the jungle
book cause Mowgli's it's this quest

655
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:41,950
but there's animal sidekicks
to get him to the man village.

656
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:45,940
What we have been doing all this time and
what we're still doing and we do every

657
00:40:45,941 --> 00:40:46,774
day,

658
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:52,140
is to bring Owen closer and closer to
that man village that we all inhabit.

659
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:57,160
There's so much hope in that and as he
progressed, as you feel so good about it,

660
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:58,780
but at the same time,

661
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:02,650
that's not to say he'll
ever totally get there.

662
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:10,840
[inaudible]

663
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:14,280
as hard as we might
try, we, we may not get,

664
00:41:15,830 --> 00:41:19,290
but that doesn't mean you,
you leave him on the path,

665
00:41:19,291 --> 00:41:21,480
you stay with him on the path,

666
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:24,450
even if it's a never ending path.

667
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:34,743
