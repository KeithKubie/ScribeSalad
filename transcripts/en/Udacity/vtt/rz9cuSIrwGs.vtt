00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.920
So here are three, fundamental theorems that come out of

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.534
all of this work on Nash equilibrium. They're all in

00:00:06.534 --> 00:00:08.150
the screen in front of you. I'll read them for

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:10.630
you in case you can't read my handwriting or if

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:12.880
there's some typo you discover that forces me to erase

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.730
some words and then write some new ones. Okay, are

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.500
we ready? Alright, the first one is, in the n-player pure strategy game,

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.190
if elimination of all strictly nominated strategies,

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:29.200
eliminates all but one combination of strategies, then that combination

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.750
is in fact the unique Nash equilibrium. So that's, that's what

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.340
happened in prisoner's dilemma, we got rid of all but one

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.360
option and that option had to be the unique Nash equilibrium.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.640
&gt;&gt; You say, eliminate all of them, do we, is it possible that things

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.170
that we couldn't eliminate in one round, we could eliminate in the next round?

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.175
&gt;&gt; Yeah it's possible, so in fact, this is done in an

00:00:47.175 --> 00:00:50.300
iterated fashion. You get rid of whatever you can eliminate and pretend

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.320
they were never there. Because the truth is, no

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.980
one would ever choose them. And then with what you

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.460
have left, you just do it again. So it

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.990
is possible. Although not in any examples that we did.

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.440
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.840
&gt;&gt; The second one is and this, both of these I think are kind

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.450
of Obvious. They sort of make sense anyway. At least to me. That any nash

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.380
equilibrium will survive the iterated elimination of

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.420
strictly dominated strategies. In other words if

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.240
you get rid of things that are

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.390
strictly dominated you will not accidentally get rid

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.670
of nash equilibria in the process. And that

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.500
makes sense because, if they're strictly dominated then

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.280
if you ever end up there, you would

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.900
want to leave. And therefore can't be a Nash.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.470
&gt;&gt; And therefore can't be a Nash equilibrium, that's

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.490
right. So, those two things sort of make sense I

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.150
think. The last one is true but isn't at least

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.330
painfully obvious, at least not to me, and that is.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.530
&gt;&gt; If n is finite, that is you have a finite number of players, and for each

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.650
of the set of strategies, that set of strategies is

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.450
also finite, in other words you're still in a finite game,

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.820
then there exists at least one Nash equilibrium which might

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.470
involve mixed strategies. So you're saying there's always an Nash equilibrium?

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.170
&gt;&gt; Yes, possibly mixed, for any finite gain. So, when you said I

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.380
relaxed everything, I didn't actually relax the

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:03.570
requirement that it be a finite gain.

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.810
&gt;&gt; Fair enough. But you stopped writing

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.160
finite, so it's sort of the same thing.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.538
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I agree. Because why would you play an infinite game?

00:02:09.538 --> 00:02:11.200
&gt;&gt; I don't know. Maybe you got a lot of time on you hands.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.169
&gt;&gt; Mm. That would be like an infinite jest. [LAUGH]

00:02:14.169 --> 00:02:18.070
&gt;&gt; Okay. So those are the, the main, results here. So, what did we learn?

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.620
What we've learned is that with interesting

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.370
games. We end up in these weird situations

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.210
where we have to figure out how to solve the game and one really nice

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.110
concept, is this notion of an equilibrium and

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.495
in particular the notion of a Nash equilibrium.

00:02:31.495 --> 00:02:31.899
&gt;&gt; Cool.

00:02:31.899 --> 00:02:32.470
&gt;&gt; And there you go.
