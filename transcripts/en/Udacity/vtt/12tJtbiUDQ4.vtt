00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.310
Letâ€™s consider a visual metaphor in our discussion about metrics.

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:08.260
We will do this by comparing metrics that exist in a toy shop,

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.490
to metrics that exist in operating systems.

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.620
For instance, from the perspective of the toy shop manager,

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.040
a number of properties of how the workers operate,

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.980
how the toy shop is being run, may be relevant.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:22.710
One example is throughput.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.110
The toy shop manager would want to make sure that this is as high as possible.

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.880
Other things that may be important for the toy shop manager include

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.520
how long does it take to react to a new order on average?

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.120
Or what is the percentage of the workbenches that are used over

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.540
a period of time?

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.690
There can clearly be many more properties of the toy shop and

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.070
how it's run that are relevant to the toy shop manager.

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.630
Metrics such as throughput, response time, utilization and

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.970
others are also relevant from the operating systems perspective.

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.070
For instance, it's important to understand how many processes can be

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.080
completed over a period of time on a particular platform.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.500
It's important to know how responsive the system is.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.240
So when we click the mouse, does something happen immediately or

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.940
we have to wait some noticeable amount of time?

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:19.140
Does the operating system design lead to a solution that utilizes the CPU,

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.300
devices, memory well, or does it leave a lot of unused resources?

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.280
So metrics exist in any type of system, and

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.210
it's important to have them well-defined when you're trying to

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.080
analyze how a system behaves and how it compares to other solutions.
