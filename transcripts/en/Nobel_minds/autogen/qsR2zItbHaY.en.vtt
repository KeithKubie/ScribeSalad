inspiration to you as a scientist doctor

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:16.360
inspiration to you as a scientist doctor

like it I think that's rather difficult

scientific discovery luck plays an

scientific discovery luck plays an
 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.919
scientific discovery luck plays an
enormous role but I think one thing one

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:31.929
enormous role but I think one thing one
 

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:33.390

can be fairly sure about is that if

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:33.400
can be fairly sure about is that if

can be fairly sure about is that if
you've not been thinking about the

you've not been thinking about the
 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.479
you've not been thinking about the
problem continuously and perhaps even in

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:39.489

for some time to have some weeks or even

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070
for some time to have some weeks or even
 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.619
for some time to have some weeks or even
some months and it's unlikely that

00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:46.629
some months and it's unlikely that
 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:48.299
some months and it's unlikely that
you'll get the sudden flash of discovery

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:48.309
you'll get the sudden flash of discovery
 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:52.139
you'll get the sudden flash of discovery
isn't that makes it work and what would

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:52.149

me the inspiration was always experiment

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760

some experimental facts which were

00:01:00.919 --> 00:01:00.929
some experimental facts which were

my source of inspiration and I think

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210
my source of inspiration and I think
 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.890
my source of inspiration and I think
that only that yes I am very closely

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900
that only that yes I am very closely

connected to experiment not mathematics

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990

not models not input but experimental

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.080

scientist yes however my ideas I just

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700
scientist yes however my ideas I just
 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.070
