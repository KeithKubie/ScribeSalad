00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:05.140
Most of what we call ‘politics’ really revolves around the question

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.500
of what you need to do to make a country richer.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.860
Rather than ask this of any specific country,

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.150
let's imagine designing a country from scratch.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.140
How could you make it as rich as possible?

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:23.660
Suppose the brief was to design ‘Richland’: an ideal wealth-creating society.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.580
What would be the chief characteristics you need to build into this society?

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.800
What would a nation look like that was ideally suited to success in modern capitalism?

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.420
Traditional economics guides to eight core requirements for Richland:

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.320
Military security and law in order,

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.660
lack of corruption and institutions,

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.360
low amounts of red-tape around employment legislation and taxation,

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:53.140
a technically, well-educated, mobile, flexible labour-force,

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.920
a high-grade infrastructure and good telecommunications,

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.860
fair, transparent, and competitive markets,

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.260
reliably enforceable contracts,

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.360
and low corporation tax (probably between ten and fifteen percent).

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:12.540
But aside from these eight factors, there is one thing that invariably makes a critical difference

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.560
to the wealth of society's: what we might call 'cultural factors'.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.340
To make Richland properly rich, you'd need to ensure that a number of cultural factors

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.700
were firmly embedded in the national mentality.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.420
Here are some of these wealth-inducing attitudes:

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.320
 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.320
In Richland, at parties, the first thing people want to know is: what do you do?

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.800
According to how you answer, people are either delighted to see you,

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.220
or swiftly abandon you by the peanuts.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.680
In Richland, what's on your business card is simply who you are.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.740
All the other stuff (what you were like as a child, what you think of late at night,

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.360
who your parents are) don't really matter.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.940
In Richland, friendships are usually linked to work and involve covert status rivalries.

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.880
If you fall behind, your friends might drop you.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.120
You have to invest an enormous amount of effort in your career,

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:12.680
not merely to make money, but so that you can have a functioning social identity;

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.380
so that people will be nice to you.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.160
 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.860
In Richland, parents place a tremendous emphasis on educational achievements.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.940
Children come away feeling not just that it's nice to do well in exams,

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.640
but they are more lovable human beings,

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.500
more worthy of existence,

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.320
if they triumph at school, especially in maths and science.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.680
You therefore learn early on that love comes from successful performance:

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.000
the more you achieve, the kinder people will be to you.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.500
 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.480
In Richland, everyone is encouraged from a young age to imagine that they might one day

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.160
(perhaps by around 33) be the richest person in the country;

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.340
if they work hard.

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.440
Posters of rich and famous people adorn the walls of primary schools.

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.340
The national anthem is called 'I can do it!'...

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.880
An ecstatic rendition of human possibility.

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.740
This keeps the workforce highly motivated.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.540
Dreams of successful entrepreneurship abound.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.840
But by middle-aged, most people in Richland have by definition

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.120
fail to measure up to the exalted hopes once placed in them.

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:25.460
They keep their regrets hidden, however, and quietly prescribed tranquilizers and antidepressants.

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:26.620
 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.920
People don't sleep very well in Richland.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.680
They're often up at 4 am.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.160
That worries all relate to their careers.

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.600
That's because market capitalism in
Richland is very 'efficient'.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.820
Efficiency means constant innovation and rivalry:

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:45.740
the weaker players in any field are always driven out of business swiftly and without mercy.

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:51.780
The stock market is ruthless about punishing underperformance (normally on a quarterly basis).

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.160
 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.840
In Richland, everything is geared towards the needs of the consumer:

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.300
there must be low prices, that has to be excellent customer service,

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.260
shops have to be open at all hours.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.320
There can be no sacrosanct high holidays or weekends.

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.700
Even though most people are both consumers and producers, in Richland,

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.100
they are taught to think of themselves primarily as consumers.

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.620
In their minds, their multiple woes as producers

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:22.040
are carefully disassociated from the scale of their expectations as consumers.

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.040
 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:29.320
There is 'news' everywhere in Richland: on websites, phones, and 24-hour channels...

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.040
and it's always catastrophic.

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:38.840
Citizens thereby learn that the world is incredibly unsafe, and that terror, accident and cruelty await at every turn.

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.180
There is utter silence about anything
positive.

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:46.720
Every encounter with the media leaves one suspecting that the only way to protect oneself

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.740
is through the accumulation of ever larger sums of money.

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:51.880
 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.520
In Richland, people don't take many holidays.

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:59.760
Generally they're very self-denying and scared about what might happen if they don't remain in the office long enough.

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.720
They get up early, are suspicious of any kind of indulgence,

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.020
and have sandwiches at their desks for lunch.

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.380
On the other hand they're very interested in paying a lot for what they call 'fun'.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:13.980
They pay a significant premium to have a car that can go at twice the legal speed limit

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:17.120
and flying far away on holiday many times a year.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.760
Activities that don't cost much (like going for long walks around the local neighborhood,

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:26.060
or writing poetry) are seen as an impressive slightly eccentric things.

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.420
Though many of Richland's psychologist speak of the benefit

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:31.760
of parents spending time with their small
children,

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.560
most children are brought up by staff from low-wage countries while their parents go to work.

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:41.280
This lack of secure attachment does wonders for the children in turn:

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:46.220
they grow up anxious, eager to please and desperate to attain security through work.

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:47.400
 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.400
In Richland, there are powerful currents of fashion around most things:

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.500
what thickness your TV screen has, what kind of ethnicity of food you eat,

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.340
what models of phone you talk on.

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:03.200
People can get rapidly dissatisfied with their current possessions and quickly excited by new products.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:05.660
It feels very important to be up to date.

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:10.380
It's a serious blow to one's self-esteem to feel that one is missing a trend.

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:13.700
You can get into trouble if your phone is more than three years old.

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:19.440
People speak highly of thinking for yourself, but sheep-like behavior is better for the shops.

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:22.120
 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:24.540
Every society has famous people in it,

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:27.419
but Richland is very selective about it heroes:

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:31.740
it doesn't revere contemplative monks,
wise sages or philosophers.

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:34.280
Glamour is monopolised by wealth creators,

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.180
especially ones in films.

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.520
Their doings are constantly reported on

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:43.680
so that the lives of most ordinary people seem really squalid and awful by comparison.

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:46.320
News of the famous means that people try much,

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:50.380
much harder to work and improve their apparently miserable lot.

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:52.220
 

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:54.720
Richland is seen as a very 'fair' place.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:57.200
If you work hard and a clever, you'll get there.

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.700
There's no nepotism or inside a trading.

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:01.600
The playing field is level.

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:06.200
That's a lovely philosophy for the winners, but more punitive for those who get left behind.

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:11.200
They are termed 'losers', and a judge
personally responsible for their own shortcomings.

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:14.540
It's a culture that's very hostile to the idea of luck.

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.780
You're the author of your own fate.

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:19.360
If things go wrong, don't blame anyone else.

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:22.040
Has a very high suicide rate in Richland.

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:25.160
 

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:29.860
In Richland, there's no religion that energetically promote spiritual goods

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:33.300
and sees kindness or wisdom a superior to wealth or power.

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:37.040
In general, people are secular and mock the religious.

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:42.540
But in so far as some people do believe, the God they believe in is remarkably materialistic:

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:47.360
it's a chap in the sky who believes in rewarding those who are good with dollops of money.

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:49.700
 

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:52.120
Richland has very bad weather.

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:54.680
It combines the worst of England and the Netherlands:

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:57.000
brief, mild, unreliable summers

00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:02.120
with only around seven countless days in it and with a temperature rarely getting into the 20s.

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:07.900
Then come long endless dark winters with gusty, icy winds and low heavy cloud.

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:11.960
As a result, the natural world delivers a constant reminder

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:15.960
that delight is never freely and bountifully provided by nature;

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:21.680
good things don't grow on trees, only unremitting human industry can provide salvation.

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:27.520
The citizens of Richland can certainly be envied for their wealth:

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:32.100
their shopping malls are extraordinary and their restaurants truly superlative.

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:36.820
But they do also have to be a little pitied for some of their 4 am anxieties;

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:39.320
for their relentless doubts about their careers

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:45.340
and for the worry that no one can really like them outside of what they've managed to achieve this quarter.
