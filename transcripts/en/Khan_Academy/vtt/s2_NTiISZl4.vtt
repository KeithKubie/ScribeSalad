00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.280
In the last couple of videos
we've been slowly moving

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:07.580
towards our goal of figuring
out the surface area

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:09.210
of this torus.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.880
And we did it by evaluating a
surface integral, and in order

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.300
to evaluate a surface integral
we had to take the

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.530
parameterization-- take its
partial with respect to s and

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:18.830
with respect to t.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:20.590
We did that in the first video.

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.410
Then we had to take
its cross product.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.080
We did that in the
second video.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.050
Now, we're ready to take the
magnitude of the cross product.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.650
And then we can evaluate it
inside of a double integral and

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.120
we will have solved or we would
have computed an actual surface

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.610
integral-- something you see
very few times in your

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:38.370
education career.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.570
So this is kind of exciting.

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.420
So this was the cross
product right here.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.200
Now, let's take the
magnitude of this thing.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.710
And you might remember, the
magnitude of any vector is kind

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:50.980
of a Pythagorean theorem.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.380
And in this case it's going
to be kind of the distance

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.400
formula to the Pythagorean
theorem n 3 dimensions.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.760
So the magnitude-- this is
equal to, just as a reminder,

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.180
is equal to this right here.

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.320
It's equal to the partial of
r with respect to s cross

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.250
with the partial of
r with respect to t.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.550
Let me copy it and paste it.

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.980
That is equal to
that right there.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.890
Put an equal sign.

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.690
These two quantities are equal.

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.260
Now we want to figure
out the magnitude.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:29.860
So if we want to take the
magnitude of this thing, that's

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.450
going to be equal to-- well,
this is just a scalar that's

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:33.570
multiply everything.

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.040
So let's just write
the scalar out there.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:42.540
So b plus a cosine of s
times the magnitude of

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.310
this thing right here.

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.950
And the magnitude of this thing
right here is going to be the

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.280
sum, of-- you can imagine,
it's the square root of this

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.510
thing dotted with itself.

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.500
Or you could say it's the sum
of the squares of each of

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.030
these terms to the 1/2 power.

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.800
So let me write it like that.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.330
Let me write the sum
of the squares.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:14.160
So if you square this you get
a squared cosine squared

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.540
of s, sine squared of t.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.170
That's that term.

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.700
Plus-- let me color code it.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.530
That's that term.

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:24.930
I'll do the magenta.

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.200
Plus that term squared.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:36.230
Plus a squared cosine squared
of s, cosine squared of t.

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.500
That's that term.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.580
And then finally-- I'll
do another color--

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:41.450
this term squared.

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:47.900
So plus a squared
sine squared of s.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.480
And it's going to be all of
this business to the 1/2 power.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.210
This right here is the same
thing as the magnitude

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:58.310
of this right here.

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.170
This is just a scalar
that's multiplying by

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:02.140
both of these terms.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.590
So let's see if we can do
anything interesting here.

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.080
If this can be
simplified in any way.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.590
We have a squared
cosine squared of s.

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.830
We have an a squared cosine
squared of s here, so let's

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.360
factor that out from both
of these terms and

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.280
see what happens.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.220
I'm just going to rewrite
this second part.

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.950
So this is going to be a
squared cosine squared of s

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:34.100
times sine squared of t-- put
a parentheses-- plus cosine--

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.790
oh, I want to do it in that
magenta color, not orange.

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.970
Plus cosine squared of t.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:50.330
And then you're going to
have this plus a squared

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.590
sine squared of s.

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:59.810
And of course, all of that
is to the 1/2 power.

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:00.790
Now what is this?

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.840
Well, we have sine squared of
t plus cosine squared of t.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:04.180
That's nice.

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.320
That's equal to 1, the most
basic of trig identities.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:14.170
So this expression right here
simplifies to a squared cosine

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:21.340
squared of s plus this
over here: a squared

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.780
sine squared of s.

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.450
And all of that to
the 1/2 power.

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.250
You might immediately
recognize you can factor

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:29.570
out an a squared.

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:34.160
This is equal to a squared
times cosine squared of s

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:40.880
plus sine squared of s.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.660
And all of that to
the 1/2 power.

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.340
I'm just focusing on
this term right here.

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:46.810
I'll write this in a second.

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.520
But once again, cosine squared
plus sine squared of anything

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.940
is going to be equal 1 as long
as it's the same anything

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:52.930
it's equal to 1.

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.080
So this term is a squared
to the 1/2 power.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.850
Or the square root of a
squared, which is just

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:00.380
going to be equal to a.

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:04.220
So all of this-- all that crazy
business right here just

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:08.340
simplifies, all of that
just simplifies to a.

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.580
So this cross product here
simplifies to this times

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.260
a, which is a pretty neat
and clean simplification.

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:17.395
So let me rewrite this.

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:30.040
That simplifies, it
simplifies to a times that.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:33.100
And what's that? a
times b, so it's ab.

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.520
ab plus a squared cosine of s.

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:43.020
So already, we've gotten pretty
far and it's nice when you do

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.230
something so beastly and
eventually it gets to

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:48.590
something reasonably simple.

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:51.850
And just to review what we had
to do, what our mission was

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:55.710
several videos ago, is we want
to evaluate what this thing is

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:00.110
over the region from s-- over
the region over with the

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:01.090
surface is defined.

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:06.460
So s going from 0 to 2 pi
and t going from 0 to 2 pi.

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:07.890
Over this region.

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:10.860
So we want to integrate
this over that region.

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:16.720
So that region we're going
to vary s from 0 to 2 pi.

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.130
So ds.

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:23.870
And then we're going to vary
t from 0 to 2 pi-- dt.

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:25.460
And this is what
we're evaluating.

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.370
We're evaluating the magnitude
of the cross product of these

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:32.060
two partial derivatives of our
original parameterization.

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:33.920
So this is what we
can put in there.

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:36.010
Things are getting simple all
of a sudden, or simpler.

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:41.180
ab plus a squared cosine of s.

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.080
And what is this equal to?

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:47.430
So this is going to be equal
to-- well, we just take

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:51.610
antiderivative of the
inside with respect to s.

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:53.800
So the antiderivative--
so let me do the outside

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:54.830
of our integral.

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:56.690
So we're still going to have
to deal with the 0 to 2

00:06:56.690 --> 00:07:00.590
pi and our dt right here.

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:03.900
But the antiderivative with
respect to s right here is

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:06.630
going to be-- ab is just a
constant, so it's going to

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:11.920
be abs plus-- what's the
antiderivative of cosine of s?

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:12.840
It's sine of s.

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:17.540
So plus a squared sine of s.

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:21.860
And we're going to evaluate
it from 0 to 2 pi.

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:24.270
And what is this going
to be equal to?

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:27.900
Let's put our boundaries out
again or the t integral that

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:33.800
we're going to have to do in
a second-- 0 the 2 pi d t.

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:37.480
When you put 2 pi here you're
going to get ab times

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.240
2 pi or 2 pi ab.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:45.840
So you're going to have 2 pi ab
plus a squared sine of 2 pi.

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:48.670
Sine of 2 pi is 0, so there's
not going to be any term there.

00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:54.750
And then minus 0 times
ab, which is 0.

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:57.220
And then you're going to
have minus a squared sine

00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:58.620
of 0, which is also 0.

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:00.300
So all of the other
terms are all 0's.

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:03.140
So that's what we're left with
it, it simplified nicely.

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:05.140
So now we just have to take
the antiderivative of

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:08.710
this with respect to t.

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:11.620
And this is a constant in t, so
this is going to be equal to--

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:17.750
take the antiderivative with
respect to t-- 2 pi abt and we

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:21.950
need to evaluate that from 0 to
2 pi, which is equal to--

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:23.570
so we put 2 pi in there.

00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:27.340
You have a 2 pi for t, it'll
be a 2 pi times 2 pi ab.

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:33.250
Or we should say, 2 pi
squared times ab minus

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:34.400
0 times this thing.

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:35.880
Well, that's just going to
be 0, so we don't even

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:37.230
have to write it down.

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:37.860
So we're done.

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:40.640
This is the surface
area of the torus.

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:41.410
This is exciting.

00:08:41.410 --> 00:08:43.100
It just kind of snuck up on us.

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:49.680
This is equal to 4 pi squared
ab, which is kind of a neat

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:51.750
formula because it's
very neat and clean.

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:53.730
You know, it has a 2 pi,
which is kind of the

00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:55.720
diameter of a circle.

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:57.860
We're squaring it, which kind
of makes sense because we're

00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:03.630
taking the product of-- you can
kind of imagine the product

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:04.700
of these 2 circles.

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:07.150
I'm speaking in very abstract,
general terms, but that

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:08.380
kind of feels good.

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:09.910
And then we're taking just
the product of those

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:11.340
two radiuses, remember.

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:14.310
Let me just copy this
thing down here.

00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:17.160
Actually, let me copy this
thing because this is our new--

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:19.570
this is our exciting result.

00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:20.710
Let me copy this.

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:23.110
So copy.

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:27.350
So all of this work that we
did simplified to this,

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:30.460
which is exciting.

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:33.990
We now know that if you have a
torus where the radius of the

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:40.440
cross section is a, and the
radius from the center of

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:44.130
the torus to the middle of
the cross sections is b.

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:47.820
That the surface area of that
torus is going to be 4 pi

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:50.380
squared times a times b.

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:53.690
Which I think is a
pretty neat outcome.
