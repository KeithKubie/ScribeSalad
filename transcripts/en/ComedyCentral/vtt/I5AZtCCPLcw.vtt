00:00:01.367 --> 00:00:02.835
All right, moving on
to our top story,

00:00:02.868 --> 00:00:05.438
Societal malignant tumor
George Zimmerman.

00:00:05.471 --> 00:00:07.540
George Zimmerman
is selling the gun he used

00:00:07.573 --> 00:00:09.409
to kill unarmed teenager
Trayvon Martin,

00:00:09.442 --> 00:00:12.812
placing it up for auction
online today.

00:00:12.845 --> 00:00:14.013
Yep.

00:00:14.046 --> 00:00:15.648
This is America, everybody.

00:00:15.681 --> 00:00:17.417
Um... I'm just
gonna give everyone

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.252
a home minute
to pick up any items

00:00:19.285 --> 00:00:21.087
you may have just thrown
at your television set.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.756
-(laughter)
-Mmm... Pick it up.

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.527
Okay, who woke up this rotting
piece of human excrement?

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.363
And... and better yet,
why is he doing this?

00:00:30.396 --> 00:00:32.131 line:0%
NEWSMAN:<i> Zimmerman says
 he doesn't feel comfortable</i>

00:00:32.164 --> 00:00:33.566 line:0%
<i> simply locking it away.</i>

00:00:33.599 --> 00:00:36.769
I would feel very comfortable
simply locking<i> you</i> away.

00:00:36.802 --> 00:00:38.204
(laughter, whooping, applause)

00:00:38.237 --> 00:00:40.640
It would make me
very comfortable.

00:00:40.673 --> 00:00:42.675
You don't have
to lock it away--

00:00:42.708 --> 00:00:44.677
you can just throw it
in the trash.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.612
You know, trash?
That thing that you<i> are</i>

00:00:46.645 --> 00:00:48.214
and always will be?

00:00:48.247 --> 00:00:49.649
-(whooping, applause)
-Right?

00:00:49.682 --> 00:00:50.950
God!

00:00:50.983 --> 00:00:53.586
All right. What else did
this bloated tank gristle

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:55.221
have to say for himself?

00:00:55.254 --> 00:00:56.489 line:0%
NEWSWOMAN: 
<i> Speaking on the phone,</i>

00:00:56.522 --> 00:00:58.525 line:0%
<i> he was unapologetic
 about the sale.</i>

00:01:06.699 --> 00:01:10.369
Yeah, so why don't you take your
possessions and shoot yourself?

00:01:10.402 --> 00:01:13.005
-(applause)
-Just do it.

00:01:13.038 --> 00:01:15.274
Okay, guys, and in case
you weren't disgusted enough,

00:01:15.307 --> 00:01:17.310
let's take a look
at the original ad

00:01:17.343 --> 00:01:18.644
he posted for the gun.

00:01:18.677 --> 00:01:21.247
Check out
the "Item Condition-- Used."

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.782
-(audience groans)
-Okay?

00:01:22.815 --> 00:01:24.283
Now, America...

00:01:24.316 --> 00:01:25.751
America...

00:01:25.784 --> 00:01:28.187
I need to ask you
a serious question.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.090
What the entire (bleep)?

00:01:31.123 --> 00:01:32.425
(laughter)

00:01:32.458 --> 00:01:35.161
I mean, and by "used,"
he means the firearm

00:01:35.194 --> 00:01:36.762
"was used to defend my life

00:01:36.795 --> 00:01:39.365
"and end the brutal attack
from Trayvon Martin.

00:01:39.398 --> 00:01:41.434
"It has recently
been returned to me

00:01:41.467 --> 00:01:42.969
by the Department of Justice."

00:01:43.002 --> 00:01:44.938
And then he says...

00:01:53.345 --> 00:01:56.249
Okay, first of all,
"B. Hussein Obama."

00:01:56.282 --> 00:01:58.985
I love how racists
can work in a Muslim slam

00:01:59.018 --> 00:02:01.320
into any unrelated
conversation, right?

00:02:01.353 --> 00:02:03.723
He really killed two birds
with that racist stone.

00:02:03.756 --> 00:02:06.159
Of course, then he also claimed
the birds were attacking<i> him.</i>

00:02:06.192 --> 00:02:07.827
-(laughter)
-Right?

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.029
But reason has no place
in this ad.

00:02:10.062 --> 00:02:12.532
Zimmerman even claims
the gun is a hot item

00:02:12.565 --> 00:02:14.233
on the museum circuit.

00:02:14.266 --> 00:02:15.869
He says...

00:02:20.472 --> 00:02:22.441
Okay, first of all,

00:02:22.474 --> 00:02:24.443
<i> please</i> do not cast
Michael B. Jordan

00:02:24.476 --> 00:02:26.245
for this
<i> Night at the Museum</i> movie.

00:02:26.278 --> 00:02:27.947
<i> Please</i> do not do that.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.715
Way too dangerous.

00:02:29.748 --> 00:02:31.150
And incidentally, George,

00:02:31.183 --> 00:02:34.120
the Smithsonian denies any
interest, you stupid (bleep).

00:02:34.153 --> 00:02:37.089
-(laughter, applause, whooping)
-All right?

00:02:37.122 --> 00:02:39.559
They're not interested in that.

00:02:39.592 --> 00:02:42.428
Okay, now,
it looks like the auction site

00:02:42.461 --> 00:02:45.498
has been taken down,
so, yay, America...

00:02:45.531 --> 00:02:47.099
(laughter)

00:02:47.132 --> 00:02:49.435
But here's why
this gets me so angry.

00:02:49.468 --> 00:02:52.071
Every time George Zimmerman
is a trending topic on Twitter,

00:02:52.104 --> 00:02:54.607
every time his name
pops up on the news,

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.710
every time he takes up any
real estate in my brain at all,

00:02:57.743 --> 00:02:59.845
it's a reminder
that he's a free man

00:02:59.878 --> 00:03:02.248
who can do
whatever dumb (bleep) he wants

00:03:02.281 --> 00:03:04.951
while Trayvon Martin
doesn't get to grow up.

00:03:04.984 --> 00:03:07.453
-So tonight...
-(applause)

00:03:09.288 --> 00:03:11.691
So tonight I'm thinking
about you, Trayvon,

00:03:11.724 --> 00:03:14.393
and not that asshole
that killed you, all right?

00:03:14.426 --> 00:03:17.159
And, George Zimmerman,
you can go to Hell.
