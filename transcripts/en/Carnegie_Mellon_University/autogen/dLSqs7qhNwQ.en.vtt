alluded to and then there was this new

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370
alluded to and then there was this new
 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.979
alluded to and then there was this new
development called functional magnetic

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989
development called functional magnetic
 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.589
development called functional magnetic
resonance imaging and it allows you to

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599
resonance imaging and it allows you to
 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:35.360
resonance imaging and it allows you to
peer inside the human brain in action

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370
peer inside the human brain in action
 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.370

perceiving and so on and the fMRI as a

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019
perceiving and so on and the fMRI as a
 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:44.870
perceiving and so on and the fMRI as a
tool was remarkable so it's really

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880
tool was remarkable so it's really
 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.280
tool was remarkable so it's really
changed the way we think about research

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290
changed the way we think about research
 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.509
changed the way we think about research
and think the way I thought about my

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519
and think the way I thought about my
 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.699
and think the way I thought about my
research so actually the cue the next

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709
research so actually the cue the next
 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.660
research so actually the cue the next
slide another slide one of the things I

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670
slide another slide one of the things I
 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.009
slide another slide one of the things I
was interested in studying is how people

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019
was interested in studying is how people
 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:56.930
was interested in studying is how people
learn about and perceive and understand

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940
learn about and perceive and understand
 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.729

identify human faces one of the most

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739
identify human faces one of the most
 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.130
identify human faces one of the most
important things we do now it turns out

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140
important things we do now it turns out
 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.509
important things we do now it turns out
that there's a part of your brain that

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519
that there's a part of your brain that
 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.240
that there's a part of your brain that
we were able to see which is sort of

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250
we were able to see which is sort of
 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.280
we were able to see which is sort of
right here in your brain it's about key

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290
right here in your brain it's about key
 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.930
right here in your brain it's about key
side they're very small chunk of your

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940
side they're very small chunk of your
 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.780
side they're very small chunk of your
brain by the size of P that is highly

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790
brain by the size of P that is highly
 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.880
brain by the size of P that is highly
responsive to human faces above and

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890
responsive to human faces above and
 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.500
responsive to human faces above and
beyond almost anything else you can go

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510
beyond almost anything else you can go
 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.509
beyond almost anything else you can go
to it so that's a pretty remarkable fact

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519
to it so that's a pretty remarkable fact
 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:18.770
to it so that's a pretty remarkable fact
in itself it seemed to be such

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780
in itself it seemed to be such
 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.110
in itself it seemed to be such
specialization in the brain and yet that

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120
specialization in the brain and yet that
 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.759
specialization in the brain and yet that
didn't seem satisfying well it's a spot

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769
didn't seem satisfying well it's a spot
 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:24.410
didn't seem satisfying well it's a spot
in the brain for recognizing faces what

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420
in the brain for recognizing faces what
 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.360
in the brain for recognizing faces what
does that mean and at Carnegie Mellon we

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370
does that mean and at Carnegie Mellon we
 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:27.770
does that mean and at Carnegie Mellon we
know we don't like s places like that

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780
know we don't like s places like that
 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.090
know we don't like s places like that
they're too pat we want to explain the

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100
they're too pat we want to explain the
 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.430
they're too pat we want to explain the
computational basis and so on I was

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440
computational basis and so on I was
 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.259
computational basis and so on I was
curious about this we ended up showing a

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269
curious about this we ended up showing a
 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:34.460
curious about this we ended up showing a
lot of different things that people are

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470
lot of different things that people are
 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:35.870
lot of different things that people are
trying to understand how the system work

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880
trying to understand how the system work
 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.729
trying to understand how the system work
so I've given you some examples here in

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739
so I've given you some examples here in
 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.039
so I've given you some examples here in
this picture what doesn't even show to

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049
this picture what doesn't even show to
 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:41.210
this picture what doesn't even show to
people is if you take people that are

should be there so neuroscience has told
 

00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:51.040
should be there so neuroscience has told
us what kind of bottleneck there is and

it tells us that with some practice you

00:19:57.890 --> 00:19:57.900
it tells us that with some practice you
 

00:19:57.900 --> 00:19:59.900
it tells us that with some practice you
can get a little better but you're never

00:19:59.900 --> 00:19:59.910
can get a little better but you're never
 

00:19:59.910 --> 00:20:01.760
can get a little better but you're never
going to completely make that bottom and

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:01.770
going to completely make that bottom and
 

00:20:01.770 --> 00:20:04.520
going to completely make that bottom and
go away so all of us are faced by these

00:26:03.530 --> 00:26:03.540
others well i'm going to ask like maybe
 

00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:05.090

one more question but then i hope to

00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:05.100
one more question but then i hope to
 

00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:06.890
one more question but then i hope to
turn it over to the audience so be

00:29:53.730 --> 00:29:56.419
this tells me how they conceive of the
task of social interaction and how they

00:29:56.419 --> 00:29:56.429
task of social interaction and how they
 

00:29:56.429 --> 00:29:59.029
task of social interaction and how they
conceive of that object that is the

00:29:59.029 --> 00:29:59.039
conceive of that object that is the
 

00:29:59.039 --> 00:30:00.950
conceive of that object that is the
virtual human and in fact we're looking

00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:00.960
virtual human and in fact we're looking
 

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:03.350

now at a comparison between typical

00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:03.360
now at a comparison between typical

now at a comparison between typical
individuals and people with autism our

00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:05.630
individuals and people with autism our
 

00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:08.360
individuals and people with autism our
research so far has found that everybody

00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:08.370
research so far has found that everybody
 

00:30:08.370 --> 00:30:11.870
research so far has found that everybody
is able to assess the social skills of a

00:30:11.870 --> 00:30:11.880
is able to assess the social skills of a
 

00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:14.389
is able to assess the social skills of a
virtual human but for a typical adult

cognitively effortful they can do it but

00:30:22.399 --> 00:30:22.409
cognitively effortful they can do it but
 

00:30:22.409 --> 00:30:24.980
cognitively effortful they can do it but
they find it hard our hypothesis is that

00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:24.990
they find it hard our hypothesis is that
 

00:30:24.990 --> 00:30:27.169
they find it hard our hypothesis is that
for individuals with autism they're

00:30:27.169 --> 00:30:27.179
for individuals with autism they're
 

00:30:27.179 --> 00:30:29.029
for individuals with autism they're
going to be able to assess the social

00:30:29.029 --> 00:30:29.039
going to be able to assess the social
 

00:30:29.039 --> 00:30:31.549
going to be able to assess the social
skills with more difficulty but they're

00:30:31.549 --> 00:30:31.559
skills with more difficulty but they're
 

00:30:31.559 --> 00:30:32.899
skills with more difficulty but they're
going to find the interaction with the

00:30:32.899 --> 00:30:32.909
going to find the interaction with the
 

00:30:32.909 --> 00:30:36.919
going to find the interaction with the
virtual human easier and so these kinds

00:30:36.919 --> 00:30:36.929
virtual human easier and so these kinds
