Speaker 1:          00:01          You're listening to radio lab radio from WNYCC and NPR one when you die, we can all agree on this. Something changes. You get the feeling that something that was there isn't there or leaves. But what leave one, two, three. Can you hear me? We talked to a biologist, a at Princeton University, Lee silver, who told us a story about a guy back in 1907 who did a very interesting experiment. His name was Duncan MacDougall. I don't know. I don't remember exactly who he was. Was he was he was a doctor. A doctor. A physician, yes. And what's his story? He wanted to prove that I'm the sole exited the body after.

Speaker 2:          00:46          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:50          He thought the sole had a certain amount of weight, that it was a substance. And so what he did was he had these people who were dying from tuberculosis and he, he, they were lying on beds on this gigantic scale. He literally put people almost dying onto a under a scale. Yes. So imagine how a patient on one side of the scale and on the other side are weights and they're, they're in perfect balance. And then at the moment of death, right at the last breath, he tried to determine whether or not the scale changed.

Speaker 1:          01:27          So did they lose weight when they died? That was the question. Right. And he claimed that on average they lost 21 grams. The instant they died. Oh, did, did it as he described the moment that suddenly the scales shift one way or the other? Yeah, the moment, I mean, death was easy in those days because you stopped breathing. You were dead. I mean, there were, there weren't you, they weren't hooked into brain scans. Right. So it's the, the last breath. Oh, that's man. Yes. Um, and the New York Times headline was, so has weight physician thinks, right. Great headline. Right? And this is the beginning of the 20th century. We're not talking about medieval times to remember that. What did he conclude from this soul has weight. Okay. I seen a soul. It was there when he was alive and it flew off and it weighs 21 grams. Yes. Now there was one person whose weight didn't change immediately. It changed a minute later. And so his hypothesis was that this was a very kind of dumb guy and the soul was, didn't realize it was free. And so it took a minute after the death, before the soul realized it was freeing. It flew out out of the body. So at true idiot would be hanging out like your for five now. This was very serious. Of course. Yeah. How would you explain what he saw or thought he saw the 21 grams? I'm still stuck on that. I mean 21 grams. It's, it's statistically insignificant.

Speaker 1:          03:02          You mean three quarters of an ounce compared to the weight of a body is a minuscule amount. Particularly he says Lee, when you consider how crude the scales were at the time, almost anything could have swayed them. I'll breeze the pressure. Anything really, uh, today, hey, we'd be laughed out of the academy. You ever seen someone die or ever seen a dead person? I've seen dead people. I mean, I've seen dead bodies. [inaudible] I do. Do you, I mean, I, I just want my mom just before she died and just after she died. Yes. And I thought to myself, um, there's a real difference here. It's, it's beyond power or it's a, it's a very noticeable deep absence of something. And it does make you think that something, I'll use the word carefully. Vital has gone away. Suddenly we have to be very careful about the words. I mean, something has gone away. The brain has ceased to function and therefore I would say there is no person.

Speaker 3:          04:18          It's still the unanswered question is what really happens in that moment when a person is suddenly

Speaker 2:          04:27          gone

Speaker 3:          04:28          to the other side, the other side, those of us with the benefit of being alive cannot help but ask this question. It's like a curse. We want to know, but obviously it's not something you can know because this will just always be one of those domains. What are the tools of science just can't be used. Alas. But then there are those folks like neuroscientist, David Eagleman who say, screw it. We're going to ask. We're going to wonder cause that's just what we do. When you walk to the end of the pier of science, you look out and you've got everything beyond that. You've got the whole ocean of what we don't know past the end of the pier. What a scientist does is sort of leap out onto different islands and just try things out. I'm Jab, I'm Rod and I'm Robert Belviq. Today on radio lab, we're going to do what David Eagleman suggests. We're just going to hop around. This is unusual for us, but what the heck? We're going to look at different aspects of, yeah,

Speaker 4:          05:20          and the other side in no particular order, but here's what we can tell you. We're going to make 11 stops, 11 meditations, shall we call them on various questions relating to death and dying and what happens after

Speaker 1:          05:34          won't be depressing. No, you just heard the first one, so has wait. Physician thinks. Here's our second [inaudible] comes to us from a, the guy you just heard David Eagleman who is a neuroscientist but wrote a book called some. Yeah. Which is very not neurosciencey at all. Truth is, I haven't talked about this book with any of my science colleagues. Why not? I have reasons why, but I'm not sure I want

Speaker 5:          05:58          to say them on the radio. In any case, the book consists of 40 different versions of the afterlife and here's one, it's called metamorphosis written by David Eagleman and read by Jeffrey Tambor, the Ecuador, right? There are three depths. Now, the first is when the body ceases to function of course, and the second is when the body is consigned or you know, put in the grave. The third is that moment sometime in the future when your name is spoken, who the last time

Speaker 2:          06:35          [inaudible] [inaudible].

Speaker 6:          06:39          So you wait in this lobby until the third death and there are long tables with coffee and tea cookies. You can help yourself in there. There are people here from all around the world and with a little effort, you can strike up some convivial smalltalk. Just be aware that your conversation could be interrupted at any moment by a while. We call them the Kohler

Speaker 7:          07:08          Thompson parents, and what they do is they broadcast your new friend's name

Speaker 6:          07:15          to indicate that they will never again be another remembrance of him by anyone on the earth.

Speaker 2:          07:24          [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          07:25          your friend's slumps saddened. Even though the callers, they tell him, kindly, look, you're, you're, you're off to a better place.

Speaker 2:          07:33          [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          07:34          the thing is, no one knows where that better place is or what it offers because no one exiting through that door is returned to tell us

Speaker 7:          07:42          [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          07:42          and tragically, many people leave just as their loved ones arrived since the loved ones, we're the only ones doing the remembering and we all wag our heads at that typical timing. Now, not everyone is sad when their callers shout out their next list of names. On the contrary, some people bank and they, they plead to, these are generally the guys who've been here a long time. Yeah, too long. We take that farmer over there who drowned in a small river 200 years ago. I get this, his farm is the side of a small college now and the tour guides each week tell his story. So he, he's, he's stuck. He's, he's miserable. The more his story is told, the more the details drift. He's utterly alienated from his name and it's no longer identical with him, but it continues to bind and that cheerless woman across the way is praised as a saint even though the roads in her heart believed me were complicated. And I guess that is the curse of this room

Speaker 2:          08:58          because since we live in the heads of those who remember us, we lose control of our lives and become who they want us. [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          09:31          what gave you the idea for that story? This actually, I should say, came out of my work as a neuroscientist because what happens in the brain is you make models of other people when you think, well, what would my friends such and such say, or what would my wife say? You're actually running a little simulation of that person in your head. Well, what happens when somebody dies is that they exist only in the scattered heads around the globe of people who knew them. They exist in some way as these algorithms that continue to run, but through time you, your model of somebody might drift.

Speaker 2:          10:18          [inaudible] are we ready?

Speaker 6:          10:19          [inaudible] a number three. I'm going to change up the question a bit. When am I dead?

Speaker 6:          10:27          How do you decide if somebody is alive or dead? If you take it as your starting point? King Lear Shakespeare, when Cordelia, his daughter died [inaudible] takes out a mirror looking glass, puts it right under her nose to see if there is some breadth there. Is that that breath well missed or staying the CT set of fitness feather. Just the same thing. And that is how he decides if she's on or off. Yes, and it's really one of the most beautiful scenes in Shakespeare. That's Gary Greenberg. He wrote a book called the noble lie. When it's done right, it's impossible not to weep. She has gone farther at that scene and the intimacy of that moment. But if you fast forward a few hundred years, things change.

Speaker 8:          11:24          All right? It's 18, 16. There's a fat lady in a hospital where in France and in walks a guy by the, what was his name? Do you have few Cleon sheath? Yeah. Mac lantack. Yeah, he's a doctor. He's a dusk fellow. Okay. Yes. And he is called in to consult with, uh, a patient who is obese, obese, and ill. He says to this lady, please, may I see your wrist. So said, I can feel your pulse. But this woman had so much flesh on

Speaker 5:          11:54          her that the only way he could imagine to do it was to put his ear on her chest, which would have been in decent.

Speaker 9:          12:01          Mm. So came up with an idea. He fabricated quite quickly. A device rolled up paper really and fashioned it into a tube, put one into the tube on the woman's chest and his year on the other end. Oh, how very decent of him. So he doesn't have to touch her flesh. He doesn't have to even really look at her chest. His head is actually turned away from the patient.

Speaker 5:          12:28          And so what we've got here in 1816 is the world's first stethoscope. And a very unintimidating increasingly precise and technological approach to defining death, which now is all about the heart. Up until then, a death was heart death. People are dead when their heart stops speeding. But if you fast forward again, things take another term like just imagine thought experiment. If King Lear had been written not in 1604 but 1968

Speaker 2:          13:01          [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          13:01          LBJ administration. Okay. Cordelia with [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          13:06          [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          13:06          there would be distraught but instead of doing the mirror thing again, he would call a doctor who would rush her to the hospital, shock her heart, resuscitate her, hook her up to a ventilator and a feeding tube. And there she would be alive again. Sort of. I mean technically, yes, she'd be alive cause her heart would be, but the core Delia that he knew his daughter would be gone.

Speaker 2:          13:38          [inaudible] [inaudible] Mama [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          13:46          and this was the problem in 1968 with all this new technology, ICU units were filling up with these purgatorial Cordelia's who floated somewhere in a comatose state between life and death. You could minister to these people, you could feed them, you could clear their infections. But you could not restore their consciousness. What are you going to do with these people? In walks a physician, a very prominent American physician named Henry Beecher, and he decided that the time he'd come to acknowledge the obvious, which to him was these people weren't just dying, they were dead. He convened a committee at Harvard and he simply moved the line that divides life from death back a little bit toward what most people would consider life. And so you get in that moment, the concept of brain death person is really dead. We really did not, when they stopped breathing, not when their heart stops beating, but when their brain winks out, that now is when a person really dies. Exactly. Totally invented concept, but it stuck. One way to argue it that the brain was considered to be sort of the Maestro, the coordinating Oregon that made all of the rest of the body work and without it, the center no longer holds and things fall apart.

Speaker 6:          15:04          And nowadays most people go with this brain dead definition of death, but where it gets weird is it? There are some [inaudible]

Speaker 10:         15:12          just a few. For instance, some sex of Orthodox Judaism will say that if the heart is beating, the lungs are still filling with Aaron. If the lungs are still feeling like they're still a soul, the spirit of God is in you and you certainly can't be said to be dead. Well, I'll give you another example. That's John Troyer, associate of death and dying practices at the University of bath. For example, Italy, they use the brain death criteria. The Vatican, however its own city, state within the country of Italy does not. The Vatican goes only by heart death. So technically according to John, it's possible that if I were brain-dead in Italy and doctor wanted to pull my plug but my family didn't, they could just wheel me down the street into the Vatican and I'd be alive again.

Speaker 5:          15:54          Yeah, I mean you'd need a really long extension cord probably. Cause of course these are all, I mean you'd be on machines and devices that require power. So I mean it would be a laborious process to say the least. Nonetheless, the real question here, the deeper one,

Speaker 11:         16:08          is it, when do you die? Is it brain versus heart? It's when are you gone? Like when is a father a son, a daughter

Speaker 6:          16:19          really gone to us and who gets to decide that? And that's there in lies. The rub dead to family can be very different than dead to an institution that might be caring for that body. You know that that scene of leader with the mirror is in the feathers. It's not a medical diagnosis. It's a diagnosis about love and lungs. Ooh, stay a little.

Speaker 11:         17:00          And number four, tennis. Anyone. Let me tell you about a woman.

Speaker 12:         17:04          She was the victim of a road traffic accident,

Speaker 11:         17:07          but that's Dr Adrian Owen. He's a neuroscientist at the University of Cambridge. And he told me about this patient. He had

Speaker 12:         17:14          a patient who's in her thirties and she came to us after five months in a vegetative state following a blow to her head.

Speaker 11:         17:23          So for five months she'd been lying in the hospital,

Speaker 12:         17:27          couldn't talk or couldn't move. He could breathe, but no evidence of any awareness would

Speaker 11:         17:32          shine light in her eyes. She wouldn't have the normal response in the fact that woman was gone. That's right. But in spite of the fact that she was giving the world nothing back, Dr. Owen wondered, would it just be possible that there was somebody in there

Speaker 2:          17:52          [inaudible]

Speaker 12:         17:53          so we tried a new kind of approach with her. Yeah.

Speaker 11:         17:58          Because they had a new and sophisticated tool that previous scientists, I never had any rain scanner. Yeah. This is a stethoscope for the brain. Dr. Owens stood by her bedside and said, tell you what, in a few minutes we're going to take you to a machine. You chat with her. You say, hey,

Speaker 12:         18:14          that's exactly how it's done. Yes, it sounds, um, a little bit bizarre because of course you don't get any responses back from these patients. You don't even know whether they can hear you, but we, you know, we might instructions very clear. Yeah.

Speaker 11:         18:25          And he says, now when we put you in the machine, there's going to be a click and I'm going to say into your ear, please begin

Speaker 12:         18:32          to imagine playing a vigorous game of tennis.

Speaker 11:         18:37          What

Speaker 12:         18:37          we said, imagine that you're standing there at the baseline Wimbledon carrying out the movements.

Speaker 11:         18:43          Dennis. See because here's the thing, we now know enough about brains to know that if you are imagining tennis, yeah.

Speaker 12:         18:49          Well, produce activity in your motor cortex. Very similar to the activity that you would see if you could scan somebody when they were actually playing a game of tennis.

Speaker 11:         18:56          And this is true of all healthy people. That's right. Oh, it's the same pattern. Yeah.

Speaker 12:         19:00          It lights up very reliably.

Speaker 11:         19:02          Okay, so he taped puts this patient into a brain scan and he rolls her into the machine.

Speaker 12:         19:07          When we say right, play tennis, now relax, play tennis. Now relax.

Speaker 11:         19:15          And you said this woman's been vacant for five months. Yeah, I get to see this seems quite literally a shot or a forehand in the dark. This was his first patient. Really? He does this. He says, play, stop, play, stop. She hadn't spoken or showing any sense of awareness or any interior life at all for months and months and months and months and tennis on the screen. Here's a tennis game.

Speaker 2:          19:46          [inaudible]

Speaker 12:         19:50          what we saw is exactly what we see in healthy volunteers. No premotor cortex is turning on and turning off. When we asked her to relax, turning on when we asked her to do the task and it would stop when we asked her to relax.

Speaker 11:         20:14          So she's in there, she's in there. Oh, were you amazed or were you, uh, expected? What will you, what happened to you?

Speaker 12:         20:23          Um, well, yeah, I mean, it, it was, it was pretty exciting. I'm going to have to say the fact that it was the first person who tried it in with was perhaps the biggest surprise. And we've scanned about 20 patients since then doing the same thing. And we've, we've seen three so far who, uh, showed clear signs of, uh, of being aware.

Speaker 11:         20:44          See, that's the thing that sort of frightens me about you've done, it seems to me you've discovered that there may have been and there may be lots of people in this world who are somehow aware but who are invisible to the rest of us, whom we could in effect murder it by mistake.

Speaker 12:         21:10          Yeah. Well, that's obviously very, um, loaded question. Uh, I mean I think we, you know, we have to face the side that historically we haven't always had the tools that we have today that can help us to make a complex decisions. But we're very early stages of this and they're awesome. Some also very technical reasons why one needs to be extremely cautious about drawing conclusions from this. For example, you know, we could tell with this patient that she was aware and what we can't do is to conclude that the rest of them were definitely unaware.

Speaker 2:          21:55          [inaudible]

Speaker 12:         21:55          imagine if you were stone deaf and you appear to be in a vegetative state. Now in that situation, we wouldn't necessarily know that you were stone deaf because you've, you've had a major brain injury and we can't talk to you and find out. So we don't know that you're stone deaf. We put you in the scan and we asked you to imagine playing tennis, but you can't even hear the instructions. Actually, that patient wouldn't imagine playing tennis. They wouldn't activate their premotor cortex. But it wouldn't be because they weren't aware it would be because they were deaf.

Speaker 11:         22:27          Oh dear.

Speaker 12:         22:28          So even though we can tell when a patient is aware, we can't tell when a patient is unaware. And that's very, very important distinction.

Speaker 11:         22:39          But if you can't really know that someone is unaware, and then you can't actually ever really know if they're gone.
