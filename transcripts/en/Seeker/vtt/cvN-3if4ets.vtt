00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
We’ve all heard the story that autism is
on the rise. It seems everyone has an opinion

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:14.969
on why. Some blame vaccines, some blame parents,
so what’s really behind the rise in Autism?

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.840
Hey guys Julia here for DNews

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.160
Autism is a widely misunderstood condition.
It’s a neurodevelopmental condition which

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.140
frequently causes a spectrum of behaviors
like problems with social communication and

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.820
repetitive and restricted patterns of behavior,
like lining up toys in a row. But it’s a

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.320
spectrum, individuals with the disorder have
a wide range of abilities and levels of functioning.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.309
But as individual as the condition is, there
does some to be a common theme. It’s much

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.270
more common now than it was in years past.

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.110
For the past few decades, the rate of those
diagnosed with autism has been steadily on

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:54.640
the rise. In the 1970s and 1980s, about one
out of every 2,000 children had autism, now

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.879
a new U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention survey published in November 2015

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.720
of parents found that one out of 45 kids have
the condition. So what’s behind the rise?

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.060
Part of the rise can be explained by simple
greater awareness. After a 2014 CDC study,

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.700
director of the National Center on Birth Defects
and Developmental Disabilities, Coleen Boyle

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.400
noted that the rise could be explained by
a “greater awareness in the community around

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.320
autism” and a better training of education
and medical professionals.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.990
With this most recent survey, the CDC suggests
that the rise in rates is mostly due to a

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.479
change in the questions parents were asked.
The CDC surveyed more than 11,000 families

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.820
and asked them “ if a health professional
ever told them that their child had autism,

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.700
Asperger's disorder, pervasive developmental
disorder or autism spectrum disorder.” This

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.119
wording was a noticeable change from previous
surveys because it specifically asked about

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.119
Asperger’s.

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:54.140
You see, Asperger’s is no longer in diagnostic
manuals, it hasn’t been since 2013. It’s

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.250
now folded under the umbrella of “Autism
Spectrum Disorder”. And this changing of

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.570
diagnoses and categorizing of learning disabilities
is what other research indicates is responsible

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.479
for most of the rise in cases of Autism.

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.819
Another study published in the American Journal
of Medical Genetics Part B: Neuropsychiatric

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:14.849
Genetics found that the rise is “partly
the result of students being moved from one

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:19.560
category to another. And not just from Asperger’s
to Autism, but a shift from a diagnoses of

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.959
“intellectual disability” to a diagnoses
of autism. The study found that in just a

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:32.500
ten year period from 2000 and 2010, diagnoses
of autism rose from 93,000 in 2000 to 419,000.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:40.599
But at the same time diagnoses of intellectual
disability fell from 637,000 to 457,000. So

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:44.180
basically the findings of studies like this
show that the number of kids diagnosed with

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.160
“brain development” problems hasn’t
changed all that much. It’s really a shift

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.390
in diagnoses.

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.769
And shifting a diagnoses, is pretty smart
from a parent’s perspective. For starters,

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:58.069
“autism” is becoming more socially acceptable
than intellectual disability or as it used

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:00.360
to be called, mental retardation. But more
importantly, communities and schools have

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:06.120
so many more resources now that we know more
about autism and how powerful early intervention

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.120
is.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.680
Several studies like one published in the
Journal of the American Academy of Child and

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:16.300
Adolescent Psychiatry found that autism-specific,
one-on-one intervention in toddlers with the

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.370
condition improves their intellectual ability
and reduces their symptoms.

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.550
And that kind of treatment can come with a
hefty price tag but thankfully most medical

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:29.250
insurance companies are now required to cover
mental and developmental conditions the same

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:34.659
way as any other medical conditions. So we’re
living in age where resources are widely available

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:38.440
and covered by insurance. So it’s in the
parent’s and the child’s best interest

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.260
to get the correct diagnoses as early as possible.
Which thanks to organizations like the Autism

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.280
Society raising awareness, more kids are getting
the help they need.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.310
So no, vaccines aren’t the reason you’ve
heard so much about autism lately. It’s

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.120
because of greater awareness which is a good
thing!

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.810

autism vaccine link got started, check out
