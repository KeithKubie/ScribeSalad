00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:01.950
Do you suck at drawing faces?

00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:03.340
Of course you do!

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:10.180
Because science!

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:14.290
Hey there aspiring artists, thanks for tuning
into DNews, I'm Trace.

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:17.020
Faces are notoriously hard to draw well.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:22.360
There are lots of tiny details that even professional
artists have trouble with ... I keep thinking

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.340
of those scenes in The Matrix Reloaded...
the animation was so cartoony.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:32.129
Well, a study in the journal Perception -- yep,
real journal -- looked at why we always draw

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:35.149
faces funny, and it has to do with psychology.

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:39.500
When you look at a face, you're looking primarily
at the eyes, because we are social animals.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.920
BUT just because you're LOOKING at the eyes,
doesn't mean you know where they are.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:45.920
Ready for the mind-blower?

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.830
After this is over, go to your camera and
look at your HEAD -- top of the HAIR to bottom

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.809
of the chin, the eyes, they're in the middle!

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:57.110
When humans draw faces, we tend to put the
eyes near the TOP of the head, but that's

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.749
not where they are at all!

00:00:59.749 --> 00:01:03.690
In the study, the researchers asked people
to draw faces from memory, after looking at

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.299
a picture for 30 seconds, and then OUTRIGHT
COPYING -- each time, we would put the eyes

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.040
waay up on the forehead, like a neandertal
or something.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.040
What's up with that?

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.710
They've got more research to do, but they
have three hypotheses -- Face-from-below:

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.729
or the idea that our perception is constructed
on a childhood or newborn map of the face.

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:28.109
Hair-as-hat -- i like this one a lot -- people
think of the hair as sitting on top of the

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:31.340
head, but not PART of the head.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:37.409
And Head-as-a-box -- the researchers like
this one -- people suck at drawing round things.

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.770
These researchers think we've got a bias to
putting them high on the face because round

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.899
shapes are exceedingly difficult to draw.

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:50.659
Italian proto-Renaissance painter Giotto di
Bondone was said to have drawn a perfect circle,

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:54.340
freehand, to prove he was the greatest artist
in Italy.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:00.280
Understanding roundness and faces is taught
in art classes to this day.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:06.679
These scientists believe we put too much emphasis
on the FEATURES of the face because of the

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:07.679
social connection.

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:12.890
That, combined with our cognitive bias against
roundness, means we draw faces improperly.

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.080
The researchers are going to test more by
asking volunteers to draw using animals and

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:23.670
other faces, but a 2012 paper from University
College London believes practice makes perfect.

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.720
It's not just that we're not seeing things
properly, like the study in Perception found,

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.130
but ALSO we use mental shortcuts to take in
only relevant information.

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.690
Any regular DNews watcher knows the brain
is a lazy lump of cells -- and when we look

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.110
at a scene we choose what we WANT to see.

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.190
Their study found people's drawing ability
improved greatly when they were asked to practice

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.400
and study something with great detail, drawing
it over, and over again.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.880
Maybe next time they should draw faces 10
times rather than just one!

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.050
How are you at drawing faces?

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.730
Tell us below and speaking of drawing: are
you a fan of anime?

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:01.730
k-pop?

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.530
how about just television in general!

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.770
