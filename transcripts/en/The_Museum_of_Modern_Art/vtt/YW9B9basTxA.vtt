00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:07.410
My involvement in the project goes back to
the actual transfer of the archive from Arizona

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:08.500
to New York.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:15.050
I was in charge of packing and then unpacking
the 500,000 pieces of paper that constitute

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:16.400
the archive.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.841
Once we were familiar with looking at more
of the drawings and having a couple

00:00:20.841 --> 00:00:26.720
that we knew were by Wright's hands you could
begin to understand how he did draw and the

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.630
quality of his hand.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.840
You know, he's such a larger-than-life figure
to everyone and you kind of expect these vast,

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.680
sort of you know drawings of great vigor or
enthusiasm but in fact he's quite delicate

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:45.510
and sort of more, sort of working his way
through all of the details and he does a lot

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.510
of writing.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.129
His handwriting is actually rather small.

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:56.190
It's not bold or vigorous so it's easier to
tell him within that.

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.390
And even looking at the other drawings you
can often see his comments throughout the

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:06.850
working drawings as he's approving and making
suggestions of how to improve certain projects.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.880
The studio itself developed a capacity to
do their own renderings and the major person

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:19.140
behind that early part is Marion Mahony, who
was a woman who was from Evanston originally.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.130
She went to MIT and became one of the first
graduates of, female graduates of an architecture

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.909
school in the United States and she was a
licensed architect as well.

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:32.900
She was considered the great graphic hand
within his studio.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:38.299
And she is the early sort of proponent that
sets their drawings in this very aesthetic

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:39.299
way.

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.020
This seems to have been very important to
Wright that he had an aesthetic image for

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.960
the drawings not just a kind of pedestrian
working drawings with you know, renderings

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:57.090
that were pretty pictures he had such an aesthetic
interest in all the arts, in Japanese prints,

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.890
in graphic arts in general.

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:05.710
And it's in her image of this with Wright's
annotations and adaptations and corrections

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:12.640
that the work goes towards, and the sort of
summation of this material is in the Wasmuth

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:18.010
Portfolio, the great summary of Wright's early
career that he went to Europe and published

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.610
in 1910.

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:25.180
And for me this is a representative set, these
three drawings here because it encapsulates

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:31.239
the process of the studio with the major people
involved in the projects.

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:36.580
You have the drawing here of the Rogers Lacy
Hotel, its conceptual drawing by Frank Lloyd

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:42.380
Wright all the details, all the floors, all
the heights, the module of the building.

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:48.720
He's even added a couple of perspectives of
how he views the tower will look and then

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.250
he's actually reworked it so often that there
are, is a cut-out in the middle.

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.610
He had to extend the paper several times because
the building just kept getting bigger and

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.959
so it's really a work in progress.

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:06.970
And then when you look at-- and look at the
oral histories of the people involved the

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.870
perspective was done by Jack Howe who was
the head of the drafting room in the Taliesin

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:18.530
Studios from about 1933 until 1959 when Wright
died.

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.890
And this perspective according to Howe's oral
history was completely done by him, that Wright

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:30.260
never put a pencil to it, so you get the pure
version of what the head drafting person would

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.580
have done with a perspective drawing.

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.519
What you see on the table is just a fraction,

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:39.819
a tiny fraction of the range of what's actually
in the archive itself.

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:44.581
There is close to half a million pieces of
paper that document the creative genius of

00:03:44.581 --> 00:03:45.081
Frank Lloyd Wright.
