00:00:01.007 --> 00:00:02.604
- [Instructor] We are told that a baker

00:00:02.604 --> 00:00:06.392
uses eight cups of flour to
make one batch of muffins

00:00:06.392 --> 00:00:08.301
for his bakery.

00:00:08.301 --> 00:00:11.787
Complete the table for the given ratio.

00:00:11.787 --> 00:00:14.376
So they're saying that for every batch,

00:00:14.376 --> 00:00:16.098
he needs eight cups of flour

00:00:16.098 --> 00:00:19.102
or he needs eight cups
of flour for every batch.

00:00:19.102 --> 00:00:20.982
So if you have two batches

00:00:20.982 --> 00:00:22.608
how many cups of flour would that be?

00:00:22.608 --> 00:00:24.781
Pause the video and try to figure it out.

00:00:24.781 --> 00:00:26.964
Well if he has twice as many
batches, he's gonna have

00:00:26.964 --> 00:00:29.516
twice the number of cups of flour.

00:00:29.516 --> 00:00:32.685
So instead of eight, it
would be 16 cups of flour.

00:00:32.685 --> 00:00:35.285
And if he had three times
the number of batches,

00:00:35.285 --> 00:00:37.934
it would be three times the
number of cups of flour.

00:00:37.934 --> 00:00:42.263
So instead of eight, it would
be eight times three, or 24.

00:00:42.263 --> 00:00:46.034
Now down here, they say
plot the ordered pairs

00:00:46.034 --> 00:00:49.731
x comma y from the table
on the following graph.

00:00:49.731 --> 00:00:53.337
So we wanna graph one batch, eight cups,

00:00:53.337 --> 00:00:57.461
two batches, 16 cups,
three batches, 24 cups.

00:00:57.461 --> 00:00:59.017
So let's do that.

00:00:59.017 --> 00:01:00.365
Let's see if we can, okay.

00:01:00.365 --> 00:01:04.308
So right here, I'm assuming
on the horizontal axis

00:01:04.308 --> 00:01:06.959
that is our batches, and
then our vertical axis

00:01:06.959 --> 00:01:08.269
is cups of flour.

00:01:08.269 --> 00:01:11.886
So for every batch, we
need eight cups of flour.

00:01:11.886 --> 00:01:14.365
So one batch, this is
eight right over here,

00:01:14.365 --> 00:01:16.620
five, six, seven, eight,

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.298
and then for two batches,
we're going to need

00:01:20.298 --> 00:01:22.817
16 cups of flour so that puts us

00:01:22.817 --> 00:01:25.084
right over there, that's 16.

00:01:25.084 --> 00:01:28.648
And then for three batches,
we are going to need

00:01:28.648 --> 00:01:31.876
24 cups of flour, and that
actually goes slightly off

00:01:31.876 --> 00:01:34.855
of our screen here, let
me scroll up a little bit.

00:01:34.855 --> 00:01:38.412
So for three batches, we're
going to have to bring that

00:01:38.412 --> 00:01:42.403
to 24 which is right here and I can see

00:01:42.403 --> 00:01:44.383
the 25 right above that.

00:01:44.383 --> 00:01:47.787
And what you'll see,
because the ratio between

00:01:47.787 --> 00:01:50.761
our batches and our cups
of flour are constant,

00:01:50.761 --> 00:01:53.618
that all of these points,
you could connect them all

00:01:53.618 --> 00:01:57.722
with one straight line
because we have a fixed ratio.

00:01:57.722 --> 00:02:00.831
Every time we move one to the right,

00:02:00.831 --> 00:02:02.529
we're gonna move eight up.

00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:04.509
Every time we add another
batch, we're gonna have

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:07.751
eight more cups of flour,
every time we add a batch,

00:02:07.751 --> 00:02:10.060
eight more cups of flour.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.616
Lets do another example.

00:02:11.616 --> 00:02:14.786
Here we're told Drew
earns money washing cars

00:02:14.786 --> 00:02:16.992
for his neighbors on the weekends.

00:02:16.992 --> 00:02:20.435
Drew charges a set rate
for each car he washes.

00:02:20.435 --> 00:02:22.936
The points on the
following coordinate plane

00:02:22.936 --> 00:02:27.000
show how much Drew charges
for two, five, and eight cars.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.706
So let's see what's going on over here.

00:02:28.706 --> 00:02:33.082
So when he washes two cars,
he looks like he charges $15.

00:02:33.082 --> 00:02:37.097
When he washes five cars,
it looks like he's charging,

00:02:37.097 --> 00:02:40.519
well it looks like some
place between 35 and $40,

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:42.470
and he charges eight cars,

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.639
it looks like he's charging $60.

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:48.597
So one way to think about it is the ratio

00:02:48.597 --> 00:02:50.671
between the number of cars he's washing

00:02:50.671 --> 00:02:53.921
and the dollars, it stays at two to 15,

00:02:54.877 --> 00:02:57.457
notice two cars, for every $15.

00:02:57.457 --> 00:03:00.829
I guess I could say
$15 for every two cars.

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:02.882
And so, when you go to eight cars,

00:03:02.882 --> 00:03:05.695
you're multiplying by
four the number of cars

00:03:05.695 --> 00:03:09.035
and you're also multiplying
by four the number of dollars.

00:03:09.035 --> 00:03:11.810
And so once again, since
we have a fixed ratio here,

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.411
all three of these points
sit on the same line.

00:03:14.411 --> 00:03:16.971
But then they ask us down here,

00:03:16.971 --> 00:03:21.502
they say how much does
Drew charge for four cars?

00:03:21.502 --> 00:03:25.382
Well if it's $15 for two cars, well then

00:03:25.382 --> 00:03:27.759
four cars would be twice as much.

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:30.848
So it would be $30 for four cars.

00:03:30.848 --> 00:03:33.094
We have the same ratio.

00:03:33.094 --> 00:03:35.600
Let's do one more example.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.609
Here we're told McKenna
earns money each time

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:41.401
she shovels snow for her
neighbors, as she should.

00:03:41.401 --> 00:03:44.074
McKenna plots points on
the coordinate plane below

00:03:44.074 --> 00:03:46.057
to show how much she earns
for different numbers

00:03:46.057 --> 00:03:48.704
of times she shovels snow.

00:03:48.704 --> 00:03:50.161
Alright.

00:03:50.161 --> 00:03:53.351
So let's see, when she
shovels snow three times,

00:03:53.351 --> 00:03:56.488
looks like she gets,
halfway between 16 and 20,

00:03:56.488 --> 00:03:58.680
looks like she gets $18,

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.421
four times, looks like it's $24,

00:04:00.421 --> 00:04:04.588
so looks like the ratio is
staying constant at three to 18.

00:04:06.286 --> 00:04:10.119
The ratio of three to
18 is the same thing as,

00:04:11.025 --> 00:04:13.998
one way to think about it
is $18 for every three times

00:04:13.998 --> 00:04:17.025
she shovels snow, that would
be equivalent of six dollars

00:04:17.025 --> 00:04:19.341
for every time she shovels snow.

00:04:19.341 --> 00:04:22.908
So let's go down here to
see what they're asking us.

00:04:22.908 --> 00:04:25.021
They say which of the
following ordered pairs

00:04:25.021 --> 00:04:27.683
could McKenna add to the graph?

00:04:27.683 --> 00:04:31.145
So this would be one
times she shoveling snow,

00:04:31.145 --> 00:04:33.920
would she get $10 for it.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.704
So does she get $10 for
every time she shovels snow?

00:04:36.704 --> 00:04:39.354
No, that wouldn't be
consistent with the data here.

00:04:39.354 --> 00:04:43.194
She got $18 for shoveling
snow three times.

00:04:43.194 --> 00:04:45.350
So that looks like she's
getting six dollars

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:48.103
for every time she shovels snow.

00:04:48.103 --> 00:04:51.953
So I would rule out choice A, choice B,

00:04:51.953 --> 00:04:54.799
shoveling snow twice, she gets $12.

00:04:54.799 --> 00:04:56.496
Well that makes sense,
if she gets six dollars

00:04:56.496 --> 00:04:58.182
every time she shovels snow.

00:04:58.182 --> 00:05:01.323
If the ratio of shoveling of the times

00:05:01.323 --> 00:05:04.990
to the dollars is three
to 18 or one to six,

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:09.420
that would be equivalent to two to 12

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.399
and we would pick that choice.
