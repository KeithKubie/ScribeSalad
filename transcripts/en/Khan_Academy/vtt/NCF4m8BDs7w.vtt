00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.410
what I want to do in this video is think
about the idea of an average value of a

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.300
function over some closed interval so
what do I mean by that and how could we

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.500
think about what average value of a
function even means so let's say that's

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.480
my y-axis
and let's say that this is my this right

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.960
over here is my x-axis and let me draw a
function here so let's say the function

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.599
looks something like that that's the
graph of y is equal to Y is equal to f

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.140
of X and now let's think about a closed
interval so we're going to think about

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.070
the closed interval between a and B
including a and B that's what makes it

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.239
closed or including our endpoints we're
going to think about this interval right

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.340
over here so between x is equal to a and
X is equal to B what is the average

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.660
value of this function one way to think
about it is what is the average height

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.030
of this function so how could we what
would that mean well one way to think

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.890
about it it would be some height so that
if we multiply it times the width of

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.409
this interval we'll get the area under
the curve so another way to think about

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.850
it is the area under the curve right
over here the area let me do this in a

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.229
different color so the area under this
curve right over here I'll shaded in

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.799
yellow we already know that we can
express this as the definite integral

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:30.000
from A to B of f of X DX the average
value of our function over this closed

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.229
interval a B let me write that over over
the closed interval between a and B

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.390
including a and B we could think about
it as some height some height let me do

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.220
this in a new color some value of our
function some height let me think about

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.100
maybe some height right over here so
that if we multiply this height times

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.590
this width we're going to get the area
of a rectangle the rectangle is would be

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.670
the area of this rectangle right over
here and that rectangle is going to have

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.950
the same area as the area under the
curve which is a reasonable way if you

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.700
kind of remember how when you even think
about finding the area or one way to

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.129
find think about the area of
Zoid you can multiply if you have a

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:21.280
trapezoid if you have a trapezoid like
this you have a trapezoid like this this

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.730
is you can kind of you kind of turn 90
degrees but your multiply the height

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:31.299
times the average width of the trapezoid
and then that will give you its area so

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:34.810
this would be the average width which in
a which in a trapezoid like this would

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.739
just be halfway between this function is
not linear so it's not necessarily going

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:44.799
to be halfway in between but it's that
same idea so how could we use this idea

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:49.299
where this is right over here this
height this height right over here we

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:54.730
could call this we could call this the
functions average the functions average

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.239
how could we use all of this to come
back to with a formula for the the the

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:03.280
average of a function over this closed
interval well let's just Express in math

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.159
what we've already said we already said
that this function average should be

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:10.959
some height so let's say the function
average so if I that's a height and if I

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:16.239
multiply it times the width of this
interval so this width right over here

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:19.690
this width right over here is just going
to be the larger value minus the smaller

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.609
value so that's going to be B minus a so
the average value of the function times

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:32.290
the width of the interval should give us
an area that is equivalent to the area

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:38.919
under the curve so it should be equal to
the definite integral from A to B of f

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:45.549
of X DX and so if we just if we knew all
of this other stuff we could solve for

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:49.900
the functions average the functions
average we divide both sides by B minus

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:55.810
a the functions average is going to be
equal to just dividing both sides by B

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:02.620
minus a you're going to get 1 over B
minus a times the definite integral the

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:08.799
definite integral from A to B of f of X
DX or another way to think about it

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:11.620
you're going to figure out what the area
under the curve is over that interval

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.760
you're going to divide that by the width
and then you're going to have the

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.909
functions average you want me to think
about you're going to have the average

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:23.590
height and once again I'd like to remind
you that because this is you shouldn't

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.590
just sit there and try to memorize this
thing and just just get a

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.770
conceptual understanding of what this is
really just trying to say area under the

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.080
curve divided by the width well that's
just going to give you the average

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.860
height that's going to give you the
average of the function in the next

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.620
video we'll actually apply this formula
to see that it's actually

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.889
straightforward to calculate if you if
you can figure out the definite integral
