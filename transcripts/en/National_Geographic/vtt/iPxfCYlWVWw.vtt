( intro music )

00:00:36.402 --> 00:00:37.804
Greg Long:<i> I do feel fear,</i>

00:00:38.704 --> 00:00:40.106
<i> but that fear is actually</i>

00:00:40.106 --> 00:00:43.610
<i> one of the underlying
 motivators of why...</i>

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.211
<i> I ride big waves.</i>

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.882
<i> How are we ever meant to
 truly grow in our lives,</i>

00:00:49.882 --> 00:00:52.652
<i> if we don't occasionally
 step out of that comfort zone?</i>

00:00:56.422 --> 00:00:59.191
<i> The feelings of fear...</i>

00:00:59.191 --> 00:01:01.561
<i> I open my arms
 and I welcome them.</i>

00:01:04.797 --> 00:01:09.602
( applause )

00:01:11.503 --> 00:01:13.706
Greg Long:
Thank you guys, very much.

00:01:13.706 --> 00:01:15.542 line:0%
I'm Greg Long.

00:01:15.542 --> 00:01:17.410 line:0%
I'm a professional
big wave surfer.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.546 line:0%
I have dedicated my life

00:01:20.546 --> 00:01:25.051
to following the greatest
ocean storms around the globe,

00:01:25.051 --> 00:01:28.088
in pursuit of riding
the biggest waves in the world.

00:01:29.255 --> 00:01:32.725
<i> As you continue to ride
 larger and larger waves,</i>

00:01:32.725 --> 00:01:35.227
<i> the stakes at play
 in order to do so,</i>

00:01:35.227 --> 00:01:36.962
<i> continue to escalate.</i>

00:01:36.962 --> 00:01:39.131
<i> Eventually,
 you get to a point,</i>

00:01:39.131 --> 00:01:41.367
<i> where you've begun walking
 a fine line.</i>

00:01:41.367 --> 00:01:45.805
It's a line between
riding that next greatest,

00:01:45.805 --> 00:01:48.441
biggest wave of your life,

00:01:48.441 --> 00:01:50.275
or possibly
dropping down the face

00:01:50.275 --> 00:01:52.078
of the one that could end it.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.284
For over a decade...
I walked that line.

00:01:58.284 --> 00:02:00.286
Until one day,

00:02:00.286 --> 00:02:02.088
I stumbled
over the other side.

00:02:03.556 --> 00:02:05.190
Thankfully,
I'm still here today

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.327
to share with you guys,
my big wave journey.

00:02:08.327 --> 00:02:13.266
One that has literally
taken me to the edge and back.

00:02:13.266 --> 00:02:15.601
( music )

00:02:15.601 --> 00:02:17.837
<i> With a playing field
 that is constantly in motion</i>

00:02:17.837 --> 00:02:19.439
<i> and always changing...</i>

00:02:22.508 --> 00:02:24.877
<i> It is very easy
 to make mistakes.</i>

00:02:24.877 --> 00:02:28.882
( music continues )

00:02:34.721 --> 00:02:36.489
<i> And the consequences...</i>

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:42.195
<i> they are very real.</i>

00:02:57.176 --> 00:03:00.012
<i> But when you reach deep
 within yourself,</i>

00:03:00.012 --> 00:03:02.882
<i> bringing your mind and body
 into momentary sync,</i>

00:03:02.882 --> 00:03:05.318
<i> with the rhythm and
 power of the swells,</i>

00:03:05.318 --> 00:03:08.788
<i> and for brief moment,
 seemingly defying nature,</i>

00:03:08.788 --> 00:03:13.058
<i> and successfully riding
 one of those waves.</i>

00:03:13.058 --> 00:03:14.694
<i> For me,...</i>

00:03:14.694 --> 00:03:16.996
<i> there's no other feeling
 in the world like it.</i>

00:03:16.996 --> 00:03:20.166
( music )

00:04:26.799 --> 00:04:28.567
( applause )

00:04:28.567 --> 00:04:29.969
Greg Long: Thank you.

00:04:31.804 --> 00:04:34.073
So, I grew up

00:04:34.073 --> 00:04:36.142
in the small beach town of
San Clemente,

00:04:36.142 --> 00:04:37.810
in Southern California.

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.979
<i> It is a popular
 surfing destination</i>

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:43.116
<i> known around the world,
 but not for its big waves.</i>

00:04:44.016 --> 00:04:46.018
<i> It's known for its
 small perfect</i>

00:04:46.018 --> 00:04:47.687
<i> cobblestone point breaks</i>

00:04:47.687 --> 00:04:49.622
<i> that allow your average surfer
 to go out there</i>

00:04:49.622 --> 00:04:52.091
<i> and just really have a fun
 and joyous time.</i>

00:04:52.892 --> 00:04:54.360
<i> When I was 14 years old,</i>

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.664
<i> I started seeing these
 photographs in the magazines.</i>

00:04:57.664 --> 00:04:59.965
<i>Photographs of the newly exposed
 big wave break,</i>

00:04:59.965 --> 00:05:02.468
<i> by the name of Todos Santos.</i>

00:05:02.468 --> 00:05:04.937
<i> And Todos Santos
 is on an island</i>

00:05:04.937 --> 00:05:07.406
<i> off the coast of
 Northern Baja.</i>

00:05:07.406 --> 00:05:10.343
<i> And, it was renowned
 immediately as</i>

00:05:10.343 --> 00:05:12.745
<i> one of the best
 big wave breaks in the world.</i>

00:05:12.745 --> 00:05:15.281
<i> And at 15 years old,
 I got to go down</i>

00:05:15.281 --> 00:05:18.117
<i> and surf this wave
 Todos Santos.</i>

00:05:18.117 --> 00:05:20.553
At the same time
I was competing competitively

00:05:20.553 --> 00:05:23.722
in the amateur series,
in the Progressive Surfing,

00:05:23.722 --> 00:05:25.591
doing the turns
in the small waves.

00:05:25.591 --> 00:05:27.193
That's what I grew up
surfing.

00:05:27.193 --> 00:05:30.396
And I had a very decent
amateur career, and actually

00:05:30.396 --> 00:05:33.732
won... was the National
Amateur Championship title.

00:05:33.732 --> 00:05:35.200
And immediately I had

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.135
all the surf industry taking
notice saying,

00:05:37.135 --> 00:05:40.640
'Okay, he's the next kid
we need to sponsor'.

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:45.043
Well, I was 18 years old,
and I used that opportunity

00:05:45.043 --> 00:05:47.380
to sign my first
professional contract,

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.282
but in doing so,

00:05:49.282 --> 00:05:51.350
I knew that's not
where my heart was.

00:05:52.217 --> 00:05:54.020
I could've cared less
about these contests.

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.556
I wanted to ride
these big waves.

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:59.258
So, in signing up
professional contract,

00:05:59.258 --> 00:06:02.194
I was allowed a travel budget
that I could use

00:06:02.194 --> 00:06:04.564
to go to the contest,
or as I figured,

00:06:04.564 --> 00:06:06.065
at my own disposal.

00:06:06.065 --> 00:06:08.667
( laughter )

00:06:08.667 --> 00:06:11.637
So I turned my back
on competitive surfing

00:06:11.637 --> 00:06:14.107
and I set off on
this life of adventure.

00:06:17.276 --> 00:06:20.212
It became
an obsession of mine...

00:06:20.212 --> 00:06:22.047
beyond the passion, obsession.

00:06:22.047 --> 00:06:23.816
I'd pack up my bags,
and I would go,

00:06:23.816 --> 00:06:27.019
and I would live down
in Cape Town, South Africa,

00:06:27.019 --> 00:06:28.954
the bottom of Africa.

00:06:28.954 --> 00:06:30.956
And during
the most torrential storms

00:06:30.956 --> 00:06:35.094
of the Roaring Forties,
all in hopes of waiting

00:06:35.094 --> 00:06:39.765
for a wave by the name of
Dungeons to awaken.

00:06:39.765 --> 00:06:41.367
<i> It's called
 the Cape of Storms</i>

00:06:41.367 --> 00:06:43.068
<i> for a good reason.</i>

00:06:43.068 --> 00:06:45.103
<i> And it seemed like
 every single week,</i>

00:06:45.103 --> 00:06:48.741
<i> we were constantly battered
 with another storm.</i>

00:06:48.741 --> 00:06:51.410
<i> And an opportunity
 to surf these big waves.</i>

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:52.678
You have all of these

00:06:52.678 --> 00:06:55.914
incredible harsh elements
against you and then

00:06:55.914 --> 00:06:58.150
sometimes the most daunting
of them all...

00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:59.785
<i> was the real locals.</i>

00:06:59.785 --> 00:07:02.955
( laughter )

00:07:02.955 --> 00:07:04.623
I wouldn't surf
with these locals.

00:07:04.623 --> 00:07:07.460
( laughter )

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:09.561
<i> But all those elements,</i>

00:07:09.561 --> 00:07:12.998
<i> they hardened my Southern
 California ass up real quick!</i>

00:07:12.998 --> 00:07:14.400
( laughter )

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:15.601
<i> And it gave me
 this confidence,</i>

00:07:15.601 --> 00:07:17.536
<i> that I could then take to
 any other break</i>

00:07:17.536 --> 00:07:19.104
<i> around the world...</i>

00:07:19.104 --> 00:07:21.973
<i> which is what I did.
 Sometimes, it was Mexico,</i>

00:07:21.973 --> 00:07:23.642
<i> it was one of my favorite
 destinations,</i>

00:07:23.642 --> 00:07:25.778
<i> wave called
 Puerto Escondido.</i>

00:07:25.778 --> 00:07:27.646
<i> West Australia</i>

00:07:27.646 --> 00:07:30.382
<i> all of South America,
 Chile and Peru</i>

00:07:30.382 --> 00:07:33.852
<i> South Pacific, Tahiti, Fiji.</i>

00:07:33.852 --> 00:07:36.622
Now people often ask me,

00:07:36.622 --> 00:07:39.992
'Greg,
do you ever get scared?'

00:07:39.992 --> 00:07:43.162
I do feel fear,

00:07:43.162 --> 00:07:44.529
but that fear is actually

00:07:44.529 --> 00:07:46.031
one of the underlying
motivators of

00:07:46.031 --> 00:07:49.067
why I ride big waves,

00:07:49.067 --> 00:07:52.037
why I choose to put myself
out there.

00:07:52.037 --> 00:07:55.040
How are we ever meant
to truly grow in our lives,

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:58.176
if we don't occasionally
step out of that comfort zone?

00:07:58.176 --> 00:08:00.379
<i> And that's what big
 wave surfing has taught me,</i>

00:08:00.379 --> 00:08:03.382
<i> and one of the greatest
 allures of it,</i>

00:08:03.382 --> 00:08:05.651
<i> is embracing that fear
 in a positive light.</i>

00:08:05.651 --> 00:08:08.220
<i> Simply acknowledging it
 as a space</i>

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:10.356
<i> where I can grow in my life.</i>

00:08:10.356 --> 00:08:12.391
Now, over the course

00:08:12.391 --> 00:08:14.393
of my surfing career
in my later years,

00:08:14.393 --> 00:08:16.362
there was one wave
that captivated me

00:08:16.362 --> 00:08:18.330
beyond comprehension.

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:20.599
<i> And it is called
 the Cortes Bank,</i>

00:08:20.599 --> 00:08:22.167
<i> an underwater seamount
 that sits</i>

00:08:22.167 --> 00:08:25.103
<i> 100 miles off the coast of
 Southern California.</i>

00:08:25.804 --> 00:08:29.808
<i> It's mainly recognized
 as a maritime hazard.</i>

00:08:29.808 --> 00:08:32.411
<i> But to big wave surfers...</i>

00:08:32.411 --> 00:08:34.646
<i> it's our Mount Everest.</i>

00:08:34.646 --> 00:08:37.382
<i> Cortes Bank has
 the ability to produce</i>

00:08:37.382 --> 00:08:40.853
<i> the largest rideable waves of
 anywhere in the world.</i>

00:08:40.853 --> 00:08:43.288
<i> But it also has
 challenges and dangers</i>

00:08:43.288 --> 00:08:45.590
<i> that no other
 big wave break has.</i>

00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:47.593
Your horizon line,

00:08:47.593 --> 00:08:51.330
it extends 360 degrees
around you.

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:54.066
There's no landmass in sight.
No reference point,

00:08:54.066 --> 00:08:56.701
as to where you're going to
actually can sit and lineup.

00:08:56.701 --> 00:08:58.771
There's no continental shelf.

00:08:58.771 --> 00:09:00.873
So these open ocean swells
are travelling

00:09:00.873 --> 00:09:03.775
at speed upwards of
50 miles an hour.

00:09:03.775 --> 00:09:06.879
That's twice as fast
as your typical big wave.

00:09:08.848 --> 00:09:11.917
The currents out there
are moving at the pace

00:09:11.917 --> 00:09:13.485
of an easy flowing river,

00:09:13.485 --> 00:09:14.987
so it is impossible to stay

00:09:14.987 --> 00:09:16.621
whatever it is
that you want to

00:09:16.621 --> 00:09:18.658
without paddling incessantly.

00:09:19.859 --> 00:09:23.696
<i> And then the lineup,
 it spans over the course</i>

00:09:23.696 --> 00:09:25.564
<i> of about
 three football fields.</i>

00:09:25.564 --> 00:09:27.232
<i> There's no rhyme or reason</i>

00:09:27.232 --> 00:09:29.401
<i> as to how and where these
 waves actually break out,</i>

00:09:29.401 --> 00:09:31.736
<i> there on the seamount.</i>

00:09:31.736 --> 00:09:34.073
<i> Then, in late December 2010,</i>

00:09:34.073 --> 00:09:36.876
<i> another massive
 low-pressure system forms off</i>

00:09:36.876 --> 00:09:38.010
<i> the coast of California.</i>

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:39.477
I see that
there's an opportunity

00:09:39.477 --> 00:09:41.547
to go out to the Cortes Bank.

00:09:43.049 --> 00:09:44.984
And I had one goal.

00:09:44.984 --> 00:09:46.585
All I wanted to do
was paddle into

00:09:46.585 --> 00:09:48.820
the biggest wave of my life.

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:51.657
I'm out here in the lineup.

00:09:51.657 --> 00:09:53.192
And here it is before me.

00:09:53.192 --> 00:09:54.760
I turn around,
I put my head down

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:57.062
and I paddle my heart out.

00:09:57.062 --> 00:09:58.730
<i> I go,</i>

00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:00.432
<i> I go,</i>

00:10:00.432 --> 00:10:06.539
<i> I go... right over
 the front of my board</i>

00:10:06.539 --> 00:10:09.174
<i> and on to my face.</i>

00:10:09.174 --> 00:10:10.576
<i> I bet that story didn't end</i>

00:10:10.576 --> 00:10:11.877
<i> the way you guys thought
 it was going to.</i>

00:10:11.877 --> 00:10:13.612
( laughter )

00:10:13.612 --> 00:10:16.314
They usually never do.

00:10:16.314 --> 00:10:18.984
<i> Well,
 I was the happiest man alive.</i>

00:10:18.984 --> 00:10:20.752
( laughter )

00:10:20.752 --> 00:10:22.855
<i> Why you may ask.</i>

00:10:22.855 --> 00:10:25.624
Well, one, I was okay.

00:10:25.624 --> 00:10:27.827
Two...

00:10:27.827 --> 00:10:30.462
that was the opportunity
that I'd been waiting for.

00:10:30.462 --> 00:10:32.464
I would've rather have gone
on that wave,

00:10:32.464 --> 00:10:37.003
and eaten ****,
wiped out, than not.

00:10:37.003 --> 00:10:39.371
And sat there and wondered
for the rest of my life,

00:10:39.371 --> 00:10:40.839
'Could I have made it?'

00:10:40.839 --> 00:10:43.809
I paddled back out
and I wanted to do it again,

00:10:43.809 --> 00:10:45.444
not wipe out.

00:10:45.444 --> 00:10:46.945
( laughter )

00:10:46.945 --> 00:10:50.415
I wanted to make
one of these waves.

00:10:50.415 --> 00:10:52.985
So, after about an hour,
back in the lineup,

00:10:52.985 --> 00:10:55.520
and I see a great set
approaching.

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:58.323
Lineup the wave that I like,

00:10:58.323 --> 00:11:00.158
just like I had done
so many times before,

00:11:00.158 --> 00:11:02.428
I put my head down and I go.

00:11:03.562 --> 00:11:05.264
<i> Further on the shoulder
 I was joined</i>

00:11:05.264 --> 00:11:07.499
<i> by fellow suffer,
 Garrett McNamara</i>

00:11:07.499 --> 00:11:09.101
<i> and together we take</i>

00:11:09.101 --> 00:11:11.003
<i> the plunge down the face
 of this wave.</i>

00:11:13.105 --> 00:11:16.675
<i> We get to the bottom and
 we both immediately realize</i>

00:11:16.675 --> 00:11:18.944
<i> that we've misjudged
 the speed,</i>

00:11:18.944 --> 00:11:21.280
<i> and our distance
 to the shoulder.</i>

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:23.181
<i> And we are immediately
 overtaken</i>

00:11:23.181 --> 00:11:25.083
<i> by this mountain of
 white water.</i>

00:11:25.083 --> 00:11:27.986
Now, I've ridden
bigger waves in my life.

00:11:27.986 --> 00:11:30.322
I'd wiped out in much more
dramatic fashion

00:11:30.322 --> 00:11:32.391
in my life before.

00:11:32.391 --> 00:11:34.860
But there was
something about this wave.

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:37.062
The way that it hit me...

00:11:37.062 --> 00:11:39.197
with the power and the force.

00:11:39.197 --> 00:11:41.133
It's like nothing
I'd ever experienced.

00:11:41.133 --> 00:11:44.069
It was like
a five-story building

00:11:44.069 --> 00:11:47.139
of white water
being dumped on my back.

00:11:47.139 --> 00:11:51.843
<i> I was immediately pushed...
 into the abyss.</i>

00:11:51.843 --> 00:11:54.446
<i> And I'd been down so long
 running the risk</i>

00:11:54.446 --> 00:11:56.082
<i> of what's called
 'the two-wave hold-down',</i>

00:11:56.082 --> 00:11:57.583
<i> where you don't actually
 make it to the surface</i>

00:11:57.583 --> 00:11:59.785
<i> before the second wave
 passes over you.</i>

00:11:59.785 --> 00:12:01.754
But I still have the time

00:12:01.754 --> 00:12:03.255
to probably swim
to the surface

00:12:03.255 --> 00:12:05.557
and get that breath
before it hits.

00:12:05.557 --> 00:12:08.860
And as I am about ready
to penetrate

00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:12.331
this aerated water
and get that breath...

00:12:12.331 --> 00:12:15.000
that second wave,
towering wave,

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.768
four-stories tall,

00:12:16.768 --> 00:12:19.038
lip comes pitching down

00:12:19.038 --> 00:12:23.141
and it lands
right on top of me.

00:12:23.141 --> 00:12:26.545
My body instantly felt like
it was torn in two pieces and

00:12:26.545 --> 00:12:29.715
shaken in this violent state
of semi-paralysis.

00:12:31.116 --> 00:12:33.385
But even worse...

00:12:33.385 --> 00:12:37.055
all of the wind
that was in my lungs...

00:12:37.055 --> 00:12:40.793
was immediately expelled out,
knocked straight out of me.

00:12:40.793 --> 00:12:42.928
But as that wave,
that lip hit me,

00:12:42.928 --> 00:12:45.998
it pushed me right back down

00:12:45.998 --> 00:12:50.068
to this place...
30 feet below the surface.

00:12:50.068 --> 00:12:53.172
My body was begging me
to breathe,

00:12:53.172 --> 00:12:58.843
to re-inflate my lungs.
But I knew that I couldn't.

00:12:58.843 --> 00:13:00.679
And if I didn't,
I would most certainly

00:13:00.679 --> 00:13:03.649
drown in that very instant.

00:13:03.649 --> 00:13:08.120
So, my thoughts go
a little something like this,

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:11.723
'Well, you've really
done it now, Greg.

00:13:11.723 --> 00:13:17.395
But don't worry, just relax.

00:13:17.395 --> 00:13:20.733
You are going to make it
to the surface.

00:13:20.733 --> 00:13:22.134
You are going to be okay.'

00:13:22.134 --> 00:13:24.102
At the same time,
the turbulence

00:13:24.102 --> 00:13:28.841
from that second wave that had
hit me began to subside.

00:13:28.841 --> 00:13:32.811
As I started to think about
swimming for the surface,

00:13:32.811 --> 00:13:35.080
I heard and I felt
the third wave

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:36.915
pass over the top of me.

00:13:36.915 --> 00:13:40.018
And I immediately go back into
those cartwheels and spins,

00:13:40.018 --> 00:13:42.054
caught in the turbulence
of it,

00:13:42.054 --> 00:13:46.258
and realize that, you know,
these full body convulsions

00:13:46.258 --> 00:13:48.861
began to slowly settle down.

00:13:52.464 --> 00:13:54.766
Hands began to tingle.

00:13:54.766 --> 00:13:59.171
Just feel the overall life in me
start to slip away.

00:14:00.572 --> 00:14:04.877
Flashes of light
in the corner of my mind,

00:14:04.877 --> 00:14:06.778
but I'm still going.

00:14:06.778 --> 00:14:09.114
I let go of the tail section
of that board,

00:14:09.114 --> 00:14:11.316
the last energy
that I have in me.

00:14:11.316 --> 00:14:15.553
I let go and I take one more
double-arm breaststroke.

00:14:15.553 --> 00:14:21.660
Reaching for the top
I know it's coming...

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:24.796
and then blackness.

00:14:24.796 --> 00:14:26.632
Blackness and silence.

00:14:26.632 --> 00:14:31.336
I come to the surface...
face down.

00:14:31.336 --> 00:14:33.505
<i> They pulled my lifeless body</i>

00:14:33.505 --> 00:14:35.707
on to the back of
the rescue sled,

00:14:35.707 --> 00:14:39.011
<i> and I was completely
 unresponsive.</i>

00:14:39.011 --> 00:14:41.813
<i> As fast as they could
 they rushed me back</i>

00:14:41.813 --> 00:14:43.281
<i> to our support boat,
 which you see</i>

00:14:43.281 --> 00:14:45.084
<i> in the distance here.</i>

00:14:45.084 --> 00:14:47.652
<i> And they began readying
 themselves to give me CPR,</i>

00:14:47.652 --> 00:14:49.588
<i> but first they are
 checking my vitals</i>

00:14:49.588 --> 00:14:51.055
<i> to see if there's
 any signs of life.</i>

00:14:51.055 --> 00:14:53.092
And, as they're getting ready
to start CPR

00:14:53.092 --> 00:14:54.693
and hopefully
to bring me back,

00:14:54.693 --> 00:14:58.296
I let out the most feeble gasp
for air.

00:14:58.296 --> 00:15:00.733
All the while,
there is just water and foam

00:15:00.733 --> 00:15:02.601
and blood coming out of
my mouth,

00:15:02.601 --> 00:15:05.937
but I'm still trying
to breath,

00:15:05.937 --> 00:15:07.673
completely unconscious.

00:15:09.508 --> 00:15:12.711
<i> It was about three minutes
 they sat there waiting,</i>

00:15:12.711 --> 00:15:15.514
<i> those gasps got larger
 and larger and then finally,</i>

00:15:15.514 --> 00:15:17.716
<i> the lights came back on.</i>

00:15:17.716 --> 00:15:19.317
<i> The coastguard was called,</i>

00:15:19.317 --> 00:15:20.919
<i> but we are a 100 miles
 into the ocean.</i>

00:15:20.919 --> 00:15:22.487
<i> It's going to take them
 some time</i>

00:15:22.487 --> 00:15:24.055
<i> before they can get there.</i>

00:15:24.055 --> 00:15:27.226
<i> Four hours later,
 the coastguard arrived.</i>

00:15:27.226 --> 00:15:28.961
<i> I was packaged up,</i>

00:15:28.961 --> 00:15:32.030
<i> friends walked me out
 to the bow of the boat</i>

00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:34.666
<i> and in the cover of darkness
 and massive seas,</i>

00:15:34.666 --> 00:15:40.305
<i> I was lifted in a basket
 up to the coastguard chopper.</i>

00:15:40.305 --> 00:15:42.541
I was life-flighted
to San Diego,

00:15:42.541 --> 00:15:44.276
immediately
admitted to the hospital,

00:15:44.276 --> 00:15:46.312
where I underwent
a whole series of tests,

00:15:46.312 --> 00:15:49.615
CAT scans, x-rays,
checking for the brain trauma,

00:15:49.615 --> 00:15:52.450
internal damage,
internal bleeding.

00:15:52.450 --> 00:15:54.319
And then monitored
for secondary drowning,

00:15:54.319 --> 00:15:56.287
making sure that my lungs
didn't backfill with fluid

00:15:56.287 --> 00:15:59.324
as I slept through the night.

00:15:59.324 --> 00:16:03.461
The next morning
the doctor comes in,

00:16:03.461 --> 00:16:04.996
signs-off on the paperwork
and says,

00:16:04.996 --> 00:16:06.731
'You are good to home, Greg.'

00:16:06.731 --> 00:16:09.501
( laughter )

00:16:09.501 --> 00:16:12.638
I had promised myself I was
done with big wave surfing.

00:16:12.638 --> 00:16:14.039
That I had pushed it
to the edge,

00:16:14.039 --> 00:16:15.473
I was given a second chance

00:16:15.473 --> 00:16:17.675
that I've got no reason
to go back there.

00:16:17.675 --> 00:16:19.444
I've explored
my greatest potential,

00:16:19.444 --> 00:16:21.280
what I'm capable of.
I know it now.

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:22.748
I don't care about it
any more.

00:16:23.615 --> 00:16:25.717
Three weeks later...

00:16:25.717 --> 00:16:28.320
another big swell forms
in the North Pacific.

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:30.221
( laughter )

00:16:30.221 --> 00:16:32.457
Yeah, you guys can see
where this is going.

00:16:32.457 --> 00:16:33.825
( laughter )

00:16:33.825 --> 00:16:35.994
And I get a call
that they are going to have

00:16:35.994 --> 00:16:37.796
the Mavericks
Big Wave Contest.

00:16:37.796 --> 00:16:40.465
Mavericks is one of the
premier big waves in the world

00:16:40.465 --> 00:16:42.166
and this contest is one of the
most important

00:16:42.166 --> 00:16:43.969
in the big wave surfing world.

00:16:43.969 --> 00:16:46.371
It's big wave surfing
community.

00:16:46.371 --> 00:16:48.039
So I pack up my car

00:16:48.039 --> 00:16:51.343
and make the eight-hour
drive north to Half Moon Bay.

00:16:52.411 --> 00:16:55.046
<i> And I paddle out and
 I surf the contest.</i>

00:16:55.046 --> 00:16:56.915
<i> But things were different.</i>

00:16:56.915 --> 00:17:00.318
I would immediately
disappear back

00:17:00.318 --> 00:17:02.921
into that deep, dark,
lonely place

00:17:02.921 --> 00:17:06.191
beneath the ocean
at Cortes Bank.

00:17:06.191 --> 00:17:09.094
While my mind would flashback
to the physical agony

00:17:09.094 --> 00:17:10.261
that I was experiencing

00:17:10.261 --> 00:17:12.064
when I was lying
on the deck of the boat,

00:17:12.064 --> 00:17:14.299
desperate to breath.

00:17:14.299 --> 00:17:19.338
But for the next six months,
I continued to push myself

00:17:19.338 --> 00:17:21.172
and surf every single
big wave,

00:17:21.172 --> 00:17:22.941
travelling to
all these destinations

00:17:22.941 --> 00:17:25.877
just as I had done
so many times before.

00:17:25.877 --> 00:17:30.982
And eventually,
I became so exhausted

00:17:30.982 --> 00:17:34.786
physically, mentally,
emotionally.

00:17:34.786 --> 00:17:38.223
I just had to stop.

00:17:38.223 --> 00:17:40.526
I realized in that moment...

00:17:43.161 --> 00:17:45.763
I was living my life in fear.

00:17:45.763 --> 00:17:48.199
All I had ever known
was a life in a world

00:17:48.199 --> 00:17:49.634
of surfing big waves.

00:17:49.634 --> 00:17:52.237
It frightened me to
think of things any different.

00:17:55.039 --> 00:17:57.308
But it was also in that moment

00:17:57.308 --> 00:18:01.480
that I realized I had
all the answers to this riddle

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:03.749
that I was trying to solve
in my mind.

00:18:05.451 --> 00:18:07.852
That the ocean is this amazing
metaphor for life,

00:18:07.852 --> 00:18:09.121
when you think about it.

00:18:09.121 --> 00:18:10.989
You are on this constantly
moving playing field.

00:18:10.989 --> 00:18:13.825
You know, the winds, tides,
currents are always changing.

00:18:13.825 --> 00:18:15.026
Tides go in, goes out,

00:18:15.026 --> 00:18:17.596
there's an ebb
and a flow to everything.

00:18:17.596 --> 00:18:19.198
And I was always so good

00:18:19.198 --> 00:18:22.334
at adapting
to those changes...

00:18:22.334 --> 00:18:23.969
<i> in the ocean.</i>

00:18:25.437 --> 00:18:27.172
<i> Those new feelings of fear</i>

00:18:27.172 --> 00:18:30.041
<i> that I had never experienced
 before.</i>

00:18:30.041 --> 00:18:32.644
<i> I opened my arms
 and I welcomed them</i>

00:18:32.644 --> 00:18:34.112
<i> just as I had always done.</i>

00:18:34.112 --> 00:18:36.848
<i> And simply acknowledged them
 as places in my life</i>

00:18:36.848 --> 00:18:39.751
<i> that I was meant to
 learn and grow from.</i>

00:18:39.751 --> 00:18:41.586
I started to regain
that confidence

00:18:41.586 --> 00:18:43.722
and I started moving forward
in my life.

00:18:43.722 --> 00:18:47.092
I was having more fun
than ever.

00:18:47.092 --> 00:18:50.162
And then the world gave me
the opportunity,

00:18:50.162 --> 00:18:52.897
for once and for all
go back out

00:18:52.897 --> 00:18:56.734
and face those deepest,
darkest fears...

00:18:56.734 --> 00:18:58.637
once and for all.

00:18:59.004 --> 00:19:04.143
( music )

00:19:14.419 --> 00:19:17.055
You know, I didn't get
much sleep last night.

00:19:17.055 --> 00:19:21.225
I was just tossing and turning
and living everything that

00:19:21.225 --> 00:19:23.494
I went through the last time
I was out here.

00:19:23.494 --> 00:19:25.430
The last time,
last thing I remember

00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:27.733
I was literally on the bow
on the boat, like this,

00:19:27.733 --> 00:19:31.403
you know, looking up at
the coastguard helicopter,

00:19:31.403 --> 00:19:34.739
you know,
being lifted out of here

00:19:34.739 --> 00:19:36.174
in a freaking basket.

00:19:36.174 --> 00:19:39.745
( music )

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:44.515
Yes. Alright! Thank you, guys.

00:19:44.515 --> 00:19:46.451
Love you all for being here.
I appreciate it.

00:19:46.451 --> 00:19:47.853
Let's go surf.

00:19:47.853 --> 00:19:51.290
( music )

00:21:13.104 --> 00:21:16.874
Thank you guys for being here.
Love, respect and gratitude.
