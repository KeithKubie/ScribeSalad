00:00:03.327 --> 00:00:04.220
Hi, Dave.

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.310
&gt;&gt; Hi, Professor.

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:09.330
&gt;&gt; Now, you took this course recently,
didn't you?

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:09.950
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.590
&gt;&gt; Do you think you have to be a stock
market whiz to pass this course?

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:15.490
&gt;&gt; No, not really.

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.500
I got interested in the finance
only after I took your course.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.870
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] The main prerequisite for

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:26.480
this course, is that you
should be a strong programmer.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.060
We have a lot of assignments and
projects, and we move at a quick pace.

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.316
We also use Python which may be new to
some of you, so you should prepare for

00:00:35.316 --> 00:00:36.354
that challenge.

00:00:36.354 --> 00:00:37.399

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:40.510
&gt;&gt; Oh, Professor,
can I ask you what you are doing?

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.300
&gt;&gt; This is my Monty Python impression.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.420
You know, the Ministry of Silly Walks.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.920
&gt;&gt; No.
