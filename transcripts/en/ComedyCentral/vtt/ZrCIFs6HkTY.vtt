00:00:18.484 --> 00:00:21.020
THEY ARE MUY CALIENTE--
BURNING YOUR SKIN OFF.

00:00:21.053 --> 00:00:22.855

DON'T OPEN IT.
IT SAYS IT RIGHT THERE.

00:00:34.667 --> 00:00:36.035

00:00:36.068 --> 00:00:37.470

BUT I WAS LIKE,

00:00:37.503 --> 00:00:38.771
"IT'S LIKE A SUGGESTION."

00:00:38.804 --> 00:00:40.506
BUT I REALLY WANT TO KNOW,

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:43.009
"WHAT'S IN THE BOX?

00:00:43.042 --> 00:00:46.846
WHAT'S IN THE BOX?"

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:50.049
LIKE FROM THAT SCARY MOVIE,

00:00:50.082 --> 00:00:52.018

00:00:52.051 --> 00:00:53.319
BUT I KNOW WHO BRAD PITT IS.

00:00:53.352 --> 00:00:54.887

00:01:00.426 --> 00:01:02.228
- WE DON'T WANT TO KNOW
WHAT'S IN THE BOX, OKAY?

00:01:02.261 --> 00:01:04.430
DON'T TELL US, 'CAUSE WE'RE NOT
SOME SHADY FEDEX KINKOS

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:14.807

00:01:18.077 --> 00:01:20.346
- I LOVE THAT YOU'RE GIVING US
MONEY, BUT IT'S Ts.

00:01:20.379 --> 00:01:22.148
IT'S NOT Gs.

00:01:22.181 --> 00:01:23.716

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:26.119
NOT GROUSANDS.

00:01:26.152 --> 00:01:27.520
HMM?

00:01:27.553 --> 00:01:28.855
- OH, WOW.

00:01:28.888 --> 00:01:31.390
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN Gs IN MY BOOK.

00:01:31.423 --> 00:01:33.226
