&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Good
evening, I'm Anne McLean

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.490
from the Library's Music Division.

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.430 position:56%
I'd like to welcome you to tonight's
lecture by the culture critic

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.790
and journalist, Greil Marcus,
titled Sam McGee's Railroad Blues

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.240
and Other Versions of the Republic.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.440
This event is cosponsored
by the Music Division

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.770 position:56%
and the American Folklife Center
and we'd like to thank Peggy Bulger,

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.420
Nancy Gross and Todd
Harvey particularly.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.760
We're delighted to be partnering
tonight in presenting Mr. Marcus,

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.130
a distinguished scholar
of American popular music.

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.550
He's admired for creative
examinations

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.710
and poetic associations
linking rock 'n roll

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.320
to political and social theory.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.250
Today the city paper described him

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.020
as a unique cultural
academic rock critic

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:07.550
and Dylan scholar who's
taught at Princeton, Berkeley

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.060 position:56%
and currently New York's new school.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.360
Many of you are probably
familiar with his books,

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.950
including When That Rough God
Goes Riding on Van Morrison,

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.160
The Old Weird America, The Shape
of Things to Come, Mystery Train,

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.820
Dead Elvis, and Lipstick Traces

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.920
and a remarkable Dylan book you
might know Like a Rolling Stone.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.470
I'm very glad to say that
tonight he'll be signing copies

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.070
of his newest book on Bob Dylan,
which officially won't be released

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.820
until Monday, so that's kind of
nice, following tonight's lecture.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.510
Please welcome Greil Marcus.

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:48.060
[ Applause ]

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.900
&gt;&gt; Greil Marcus: Thank you Anne
and I thank Anne and Todd Harvey,

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.360
Nancy Gross for inviting me here,
it's a great honor to be here

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.710
and thank you all for coming.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.260
In 1964, a man named Sam
McGee made a new version

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:13.200
of a tune he'd first recorded
in 1934, Railroad Blues.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.460
And in the way that McGee's
guitar seemed to have 20 strings

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:23.060
and McGee himself four hands,
he was a whole orchestra.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.830 position:56%
And the way that he shouted wahoo
as his notes rushed past and the way

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:33.520
that he aimed his voice at the sky
he was standing by himself on top

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.650
of a mountain, alone in
the world, not another sign

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.390
of human presence as
far as he could see.

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.120
But whatever image came to mind

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.880
as McGee's Railroad Blues played
you couldn't imagine the man

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.150
who was singing standing still.

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.900
As the tune played the singer
went from one place to another

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.990
and he was no longer
merely Sam McGee.

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.470
From the first move into the tune

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.480
and almost unbearably
delicious downward swoop

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.350
on a fact-based note making it feel

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.440
as if you were being
lifted off your feet

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.950
from that first gesture
whoever was singing

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.090
and playing the song was somebody
bigger, something more various

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.720
than could ever be
contained in an ordinary name.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.620
He was Daniel Boone
with faster feet.

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.660
He was Johnny Appleseed
with songs instead of pips.

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.220
He was Cooper's leather
stocking with a sense of humor.

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:39.380
He was Huck Finn as an old man
having long since understood

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.600
as Edmund Wilson wrote in 1922,

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.470
for what drama his
setting was the setting.

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.760
The drama was to make a
sound that would prove

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:56.620
to all the world the world
remained to be found even made.

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:02.010
Went to the depot, looked up on the
board McGee sang for a first verse.

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.710
Taking a commonplace line and
throwing it away out of the way

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:10.030
of the story that he was
telling on his guitar.

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.440
Went to the depot looked up on the
board, went to the depot looked

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:20.760
up on the board it said good times
here, but better up the road.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.510
Let's listen to Sam
McGee's Railroad Blues.

00:04:24.510 --> 00:07:09.060
[ Music ]

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:12.430 position:56%
Now whoever's playing in an instant
you can see them standing on a table

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:15.190
in a bar full of drunks
and then you can see him

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:19.210
in a concert hall dashing back and
forth from one side of the stage

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:20.960
to the other as an audience

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:25.820
of respectful folk revivalists
sit thrilled and confused.

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:30.080
You can glimpse a man walking into
a barbershop looking for change,

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:34.040
filling his hat and then tossing
the coins back at the rounders

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:37.090
in the place like Levon
Helm and the Band's

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:42.490 position:56%
Up on Cripple Creek telling the tale
of what his Bessy did with her half

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:45.680
of their racetrack winnings,
tore it up and threw it

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:47.940
in my face just for a laugh.

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:49.590
Who is this man?

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:55.080
Not Sam McGee, but the figure
comes to life as Sam McGee plays.

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:59.580
He's one of many figures who
appear in American vernacular music

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:03.730
as it was recorded in
the 1920's and 30's.

00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:09.430
People who appear with such force
and such charm, such a broad smile

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:14.920
or an implacable scowl is to claim
the whole of the country's story is

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:17.880
if it was his or hers alone.

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:21.990
It's incontestable for
example that there's no room

00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:24.920
for the creature running
through railroad blues

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:29.730
in the nation established by Bela
Lam and his Greene County singers

00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:31.580
as they recorded in Richmond,

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:35.680
Virginia when Okeh Records held
a joint recording session there

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:37.630
in 1929.

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:41.840 position:56%
A recording session that featured
as well the Monarch Jubilee Quartet,

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:45.730
the Roanoke jug band, the
tub size Hawaiian orchestra,

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:50.710
the Bubbling over Five
and eight other acts.

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:56.340
Bela Lam ZandderVon
Beliah Lamb was born

00:08:56.340 --> 00:09:00.700
around 1870 and he died in 1944.

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:04.810
He was a big man with a
huge handlebar mustache.

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:08.220
And the Greene County singers
were Lamb, his wife Rose,

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:11.370 position:56%
their son Alva, Rose's brother Paul.

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:17.250
In 1927 in New York they recorded a
profoundly peaceful version of See

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:19.470
that my Grave is Kept Green,

00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:24.440
an old song about the countless
unmarked graves from the Civil War

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:27.520
that later found its way into
Blind Lemon Jefferson's See

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:29.820
that my Grave is Kept Clean.

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:34.820
In 1929 in Richmond though
the Sylvan Glade was nowhere

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:36.480
in evidence.

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:41.450
Bizarrely atonal banjo and
guitar clang unpleasantly

00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:43.750
into even uglier singing.

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:47.840
Into nothing that can be called
a rhythm or even a melody,

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:51.450
but rather a translation
into music of a conviction

00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:55.540
so murderously complete,
so uninterested

00:09:55.540 --> 00:10:00.040
in what you think you believe
that suddenly you feel very small.

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:04.690
On the outside of a story that's
yours whether you want it or not,

00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:09.420
the story of Jesus Christ,
your Savior, come to take you

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:12.770
and the person of the
Greene County Singers.

00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:17.510
And let's hear the
Greene County Singers.

00:10:17.510 --> 00:11:17.120
[ Music ]

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:20.310
If tonight you'd end the world
is a sound of peopled rooted

00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:21.880
to their ground, certain

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:25.590
that no merely human force
could move them an inch.

00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:30.000
It's a procession of singers, of
singers stumbling down the street,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.620
stumbling because they can't keep
time because their harmonies are

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:37.240 position:56%
as arthritic as their hands must be.

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:41.940
Their cracked and quivering
voices are any clue to their age.

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:45.500
That the music builds on itself
until you too are waiting

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:46.800
for the end of the world.

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:50.040
If tonight should end
the world then what.

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:53.100
They know you don't.

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:54.850
It isn't that the faithful

00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:59.050
and if tonight should end the
world would turn away from the man

00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:02.890
in railroad blues as a sinner
or that they would turn him away

00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:07.580
from their church, they don't
recognize him, he doesn't exist.

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:09.870
They're people who move
into the settlement

00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:13.920
that the railroad bluesman
has just left working hard,

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:18.310
looking straight ahead, raising
their church, building the town

00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:21.140
so that when the man blows
back into the place in a year

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:24.230
or so he won't even recognize it.

00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:27.220

of the Lord the man speaking in
railroad blues is no more a prisoner

of his own animal -- is
no more than a prisoner

00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:40.480
of his own animal appetites
and against people

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:44.490
like him their town
doesn't even need a jail.

00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:50.750 position:56%
Bela Lam's banjo picks out crown him
Lord above and you can feel that he

00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:53.280
and the rest of the Greene
County Singers are already

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:57.840
in another world, even as they
claim all rights to this one.

00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:03.260
And in the same way it's hard
to imagine the free American

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:08.370
in railroad blues countenancing
the destroyed individual

00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:13.750
in Emry Arthurs Man of
Constant Sorrow from 1928.

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:15.920
It's not today an obscure song.

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:21.200
Bob Dylan recorded a version of
it for his first album in 1962.

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:26.010
And as the maid of Constant
Sorrow Judy Collins sang it

00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:30.930 position:56%
with pseudo Elizabethan preciousness
at the height of the folk revival.

00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:34.060
The Stanley Brothers
recorded it, many more.

00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:40.500
In 2001, the Cohen
Brothers' film O Brother

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:46.150
Where Art Thou George Clooney,
John Turturro, Tim Blake Nelson

00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:50.320
and Chris Thomas King for a
moment the Soggy Bottom Boys

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:53.750
with Dan Tyminski of
Alison Krauss's band,

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:58.310
the voice be behind George
Clooney's dashing mic work.

00:13:58.310 --> 00:14:02.500
They swept the movie south with
this song and you didn't doubt

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:06.600
for a minute that everyone
there wanted to hear it more

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:09.300
than they wanted to
hear anything else.

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:12.510
Let's listen to this
Soggy Bottom Boys.

00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:55.040
[ Music ]

00:14:55.040 --> 00:15:00.480
That Emry Arthur who in 1929
accompanied the Virginia banjoist

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:04.240
Dock Boggs on guitar
who Boggs recalled him

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:05.970
and shot through the hands.

00:15:05.970 --> 00:15:10.280
He couldn't reach the cords,
bullets went through his hands.

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:14.980
He was the first person to
record Man of Constant Sorrow.

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:18.230
Now you just say the
first lines of the song.

00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:23.120
I am a man of constant sorrow,
I've seen trouble all my days.

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:27.120
Those lines are instantly
overwhelmingly sentimental

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:30.490
and unless you completely
ignore the lines as you sing

00:15:30.490 --> 00:15:34.040
as the Soggy Bottom Boys
do and be going for speed

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:38.760
and flash those lines are
impossible not to dramatize.

00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:41.590 position:56%
As Bob Dylan and Judy Collins found,

00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:46.060
the more quietly you sing those
words the louder they become.

00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:51.720
And the more of a poseur, the more
of a fake they reveal you to be.

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:54.250
But Emry Arthur bangs on his guitar

00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:56.330
as if he's been shot
through the hands.

00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:58.890
You can almost see
the bone sticking out.

00:15:58.890 --> 00:16:02.830
Plink, plink he says and he
says it no more musically

00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:04.780
than Bela Lam's band.

00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:07.770
I am a man of constant
sorrow he says plainly,

00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:11.270
as if he were saying
I'm hungry or I'm cold.

00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:14.830
As if he's learned to say
such things with dignity.

00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:17.920
I have seen trouble all my days.

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:21.740
It's that have, I have
seen trouble instead

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:24.880
of the usual contraction
of I've seen trouble.

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:29.460
This says what the singer is saying
isn't obvious, it isn't common,

00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:33.000
it's not something you
really want to hear about.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.510
So this is Emry Arthur,
Man of Constant Sorrow.

00:16:37.510 --> 00:19:31.050
[ Music ]

00:19:31.050 --> 00:19:33.200
Now you can imagine the
Greene County Singers trying

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:36.190 position:56%
to pull Emry Arthur into their fold.

00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:38.160
They'd recognize him if only

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:43.700
because they speak the same blank
language the Greene County Singers

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:47.980 position:56%
singing as if they don't care if you
hear them even though their records

00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:51.730
and Emry Arthur's records
these weren't field recordings,

00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:55.000
these weren't taken down by
folklorists these were recorded

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:01.090 position:56%
for commercial record companies with
the idea that people would buy them.

00:20:01.090 --> 00:20:04.120
But the Greene County Singers
sound as if they don't care

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:07.860
if you hear them and Emry Arthur
sings as if he can't believe

00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:10.720
that anyone would ever
listen to him.

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:15.270
But why would the man in
Railroad Blues even pause?

00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:20.430
In his thin voice which
imperceptibly moves from bitterness

00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:23.060
to acceptance from anger to peace.

00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:27.410
The fire in the Man of Constant
Sorrow offers a kind of challenge,

00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:31.370
a rebuke to God's gifts and
it's this that will keep him

00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:33.890
out of Bela Lam's church.

00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:39.630 position:56%
After a verse or two the tunlessness
of Emry Arthur's performance settles

00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:44.340
into a hurdy-gurdy beat and you're
no longer afraid of the singer.

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:48.380
He's put you at ease so he
can put you on the spot,

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:53.310
so he can show you how
absolutely you will never know him.

00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:56.300
Oh, you can bury me
in some deep valley

00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:59.070
for many years there I will lay

00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:03.430
and when you're dreaming while
you're sleeping while I am sleeping

00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:04.860
in the clay.

00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:08.100
It's the irreducible
individualism of the details,

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:16.000
details that rarely have ever moved
into other versions of the song,

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.720
the already traditional song.

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:21.280
Perhaps because they
communicate as so specific

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:27.360 position:56%
to a particular individual that to
appropriate would be a kind of theft

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:31.530
that the folk process
couldn't even excuse.

00:21:31.530 --> 00:21:36.380
It's those details that sealed
the bottomless well of this song.

00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:43.330
The unusual reference to dreaming,
the use of clay not just ground

00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:47.290
and the singer goes on after
this verse not in death,

00:21:47.290 --> 00:21:52.170
but relating more of his
travail, but he doesn't need to.

00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:53.950
Like the Greene County Singers

00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:58.530
with If Tonight Should End the
World he's told a finished story

00:21:58.530 --> 00:22:05.380
and having done so he's delivered
a finished verdict in his words

00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:10.510
in my own true country the
land that I have loved so well.

00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:14.190
If that nation as it's been
composed into a republic

00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:18.230
of which the singer is a
citizen has cast him out,

00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:21.900
then the country is a
fiction and there's no home

00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:26.390
for anyone or ought not to be.

00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:31.470
Born in 1900 in Wayne County,

00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:37.270
Kentucky Emry Arthur died
in 1966 in Indianapolis.

00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:40.180
And he likely wouldn't
have recognized

00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:44.000
or maybe wouldn't have deigned
to recognize the Bob Dylan

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.540
who recorded Man of
Constant sorrow in 1962,

00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:53.830
but he would've recognized a
very old song, the very old song

00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:59.570
When First Unto this Country
as Bob Dylan sang it in 1997.

00:22:59.570 --> 00:23:02.900
Whether he would have
recognized or accepted the majesty

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:09.700
that Dylan brought to a song as
bereft as his own I have no idea.

00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:14.780
Starting in the mid-1980's
Dylan playing by himself

00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:17.800
with acoustic guitar and
harmonica and then later

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:20.210
with a band began working more

00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:23.460
and more traditional
material into his concerts.

00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:29.380
Old songs about knights and damsels
and sailors and buffalo scanners

00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:35.470
and all sung without a trace of
irony or doubt just an awareness

00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:41.490
of one's own smallness in the face
of the enormity of these figures.

00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:43.550
And many of these songs
were collected

00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:48.340
on the insanely rigorous
nine CD bootleg,

00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:55.140
the Genuine never ending tour, the
Covers Collection 1988 to 2000,

00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:58.360
which presented Dylan's
concert performances of songs

00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:03.100
by others organized into different
discs for country and soul

00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:09.110
and rhythm and blues and folk songs
and traditional blues and pop right

00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:11.850
down to alternates and retakes.

00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:17.030
More versions of songs already
appearing on all the other discs.

00:24:17.030 --> 00:24:21.340
One last obviously redundant
piece of plastic meant

00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:25.870
to squeeze another $30 or so
out of anyone crazy enough

00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:29.100
to even think about
buying this thing.

00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:32.390
But on this last disc,
alternates and retakes,

00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:34.550
that's where the action was.

00:24:34.550 --> 00:24:40.670 position:56%
The first eight CDs make an enormous
colorless lump and in the last one

00:24:40.670 --> 00:24:44.620
with every genre mixed
up everything is alive.

00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:46.420
And here you find the version

00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:51.190
of when First Unto This
Country that sticks.

00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:56.870
When first unto this
country a stranger I came.

00:24:56.870 --> 00:25:01.510
You can't say more, you can't
overdramatize those lines,

00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:03.890
that's the whole story
of the country.

00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:08.790
As surely as a TV Guide
summary of the film

00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:13.230
of Moby Dick I once saw was
the whole story the country,

00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:19.670
a mad captain enlists others in
his quest to kill a white whale.

00:25:19.670 --> 00:25:23.410
Dylan takes all the
drama the song has.

00:25:23.410 --> 00:25:27.840
An electric guitar finds the
hesitation in the melody,

00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:32.700
in the bass notes and it plays
an actual overture and a wash

00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:37.250
of symbol noises like a wave
lapping up the side of a ship

00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:42.290
and a muffled thump from the bass
drum lets you feel the singer

00:25:42.290 --> 00:25:43.900
step ashore.

00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:46.340
And then everything slows down as

00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:49.600
if before the story
was even begun you have

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:52.380
to hear the ending and you do.

00:25:52.380 --> 00:25:56.270
The theme has been stated and
it's elegant and it's fine

00:25:56.270 --> 00:25:59.510
and it's beautiful in the way
that you can imagine the ruins

00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:02.250 position:56%
of a Greek temple are more beautiful

00:26:02.250 --> 00:26:06.120
than the actual complete
building could ever have been.

00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:10.850
A second electric guitar
turns the melody into a count

00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:15.820
and as the singer walks into
America his steps are measured

00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:19.510
and let's listen to
that for a moment.

00:26:19.510 --> 00:27:12.040
[ Music ]

00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:16.190
The singer courts Nancy,
her love I didn't obtain.

00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:19.290
For reasons that he
never gives out of rage,

00:27:19.290 --> 00:27:21.750
out of a will to self-destruction,
out of a sense

00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:25.760
of irredeemable estrangement
from the land and the people

00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:27.730
who already claim to belong.

00:27:27.730 --> 00:27:33.370 position:56%
He steals a horse and he's captured
and his head is shaved, he's beaten,

00:27:33.370 --> 00:27:36.550
he's thrown into prison
and forgotten.

00:27:36.550 --> 00:27:40.030
I wish I'd never been a thief
he says tearing the words

00:27:40.030 --> 00:27:41.340
out of his throat.

00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:45.170
It's so painful, you might
imagine the man finally free

00:27:45.170 --> 00:27:48.000
after five years, maybe 10 years,

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.020
but the pain in the man's
voice is its own prison.

00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:57.060 position:56%
And so you can imagine him moving
from town to town, bar to bar trying

00:27:57.060 --> 00:28:00.750
to find somebody to listen to
him, to listen to his story,

00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:04.340
to listen to his song and
he repeats the first lines

00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:06.580
of the song over and over again.

00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:09.510
And now with the finished
story weighing

00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:14.310
down on every word the first
lines not just of the song,

00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:17.420
but the first lines of the country.

00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:22.260
Now all these people, the happy
man in Railroad Blues and the saved

00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:25.950
in If Tonight Should Save the
World, the dead man in Man

00:28:25.950 --> 00:28:28.940
of Constant Sorrow and
the walking dead man

00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:32.520
in When First Unto this
Country they're all separates

00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:33.820
from each other.

00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:37.750
They're isolatos [phonetic] in
Melville's words from Moby Dick.

00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:41.020
There's miles and miles
between the church

00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:43.970
and this congregation of Ishmaels.

00:28:43.970 --> 00:28:46.490
Good times here, but
better down the road the man

00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:49.080
in Railroad Blues says
with every note.

00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:54.850
Neither the Emry Arthur in Man of
Constant Sorrow or the Bob Dylan

00:28:54.850 --> 00:28:58.970
in One First Unto this Country
would hear that man anymore

00:28:58.970 --> 00:29:02.800
that Bela Lam would
suffer to listen to him.

00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:06.920
What these songs, what these
performances say is playing.

00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:11.040
If this is a republic
it's fated to scatter.

00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:14.670 position:56%
It was made to guarantee its
citizens the freedom that was theirs

00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:17.110
by right not to limit it.

00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:20.500
Everybody understands
this and that's the rub.

00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:21.800
Within the boundaries

00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:25.900
of that freedom anything can
happen and everything will.

00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:29.710
If this is one republic
nobody can see it whole

00:29:29.710 --> 00:29:34.310
and only the bravest
and even think about it.

00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:39.130
Now when Sam McGee first
recorded Railroad Blues in 1934,

00:29:39.130 --> 00:29:44.780 position:56%
he was just then stepping out of a
hole that had opened up in the story

00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:48.270
of American vernacular
music or folk music.

00:29:48.270 --> 00:29:53.650
Hundreds of people had come forth
to tell that story in the 1920's,

00:29:53.650 --> 00:29:58.110
when early in the decade it became
clear to northern record companies

00:29:58.110 --> 00:30:01.530
that they were paying
audiences for the kind of music

00:30:01.530 --> 00:30:03.690
that these people already knew.

00:30:03.690 --> 00:30:07.600
Stuff they could hear on
a neighbor's front porch,

00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:12.400
in the barrel house for blues, for
ballads, for folk lyric hybrids

00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:15.750
of the two, for sounds
that carried novelty,

00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:19.770
for sounds that were already
called old-time music.

00:30:19.770 --> 00:30:25.250
So from all over the south from
Texas, New Orleans, the Carolinas,

00:30:25.250 --> 00:30:30.790
Tennessee, Arkansas, Alabama,
Mississippi and America

00:30:30.790 --> 00:30:34.920
that had hidden in folktales
and the unwritten journals

00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:38.990
of the wanderings the first
generation of African-Americans

00:30:38.990 --> 00:30:41.450
to be born out of slavery.

00:30:41.450 --> 00:30:44.020
This America emerged
from the shadows

00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:48.050
of family memory and
solitary meditation.

00:30:48.050 --> 00:30:53.470
That America took the form of many
bodies, profit, trickster, laborer,

00:30:53.470 --> 00:30:58.970
gambler, whore, preacher, thief,
penitent, killer, dead woman,

00:30:58.970 --> 00:31:03.300
dead man, but the queer
thing about this country was

00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:07.120
that this country was seen
and heard almost exclusively

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:09.470
by people who already lived in it.

00:31:09.470 --> 00:31:13.320
In other words, the records that
were made were sent right back

00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:16.770
down to where they came
from and nowhere else.

00:31:16.770 --> 00:31:20.390
Nowhere else with some
exceptions that I'll get to.

00:31:20.390 --> 00:31:23.770
People bought records that
reminded them of themselves.

00:31:23.770 --> 00:31:26.650
That gave them proof
of their existence.

00:31:26.650 --> 00:31:31.680
That raised their existence
from the level of subsistence

00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:34.520
into a heaven of representation.

00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:38.790
And then came the depression
and the music market collapsed.

00:31:38.790 --> 00:31:41.220
Communities that harbored
the stories,

00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:46.020
the nation at large still had no
time for collapsed in its wake.

00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:49.700
Subsistence was no longer
a matter of the boredom

00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:55.730 position:56%
of one day following another, one
indistinguishable following another.

00:31:55.730 --> 00:31:59.890
But it was a real drama and
in this squalid tragedy,

00:31:59.890 --> 00:32:02.760
a father spending a
family's last dollar

00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:06.270
on a phonograph record
would've been a horror story.

00:32:06.270 --> 00:32:10.540
So record companies recalled their
scouts, they cleared their catalogs

00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:13.640
and they closed their
recording facilities.

00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:19.570
By 1934, when Sam McGee first
recorded Railroad Blues businesses

00:32:19.570 --> 00:32:23.890
had begun to reorganize and not
because the economy had come back

00:32:23.890 --> 00:32:28.710
to life, but because people looked
out at the ruins of their society

00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:32.360
and they discovered with a
shock that they weren't dead.

00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:35.340
When the recording of white
and black folk music much

00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:40.220
of a traditional authorless and
commonplace, much of it composed,

00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:44.310
little of it copyrighted, most
of it entering the public domain

00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:46.430
as if it had been there forever.

00:32:46.430 --> 00:32:50.260
When the recording of
this music began again,

00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:55.620 position:56%
it was on a much more rational basis
than had happened in the 1920's.

00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:59.830
Instead of the open auditions where
oddballs and families appeared

00:32:59.830 --> 00:33:03.070
in their strange clothes with
Sears catalog instruments

00:33:03.070 --> 00:33:06.510
and their neighbors' or their
grandparents' songs professionals

00:33:06.510 --> 00:33:07.910
were now favored.

00:33:07.910 --> 00:33:09.950
And instead of music
that everybody knew

00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:14.200
and anybody could play record
companies looked for virtuosity,

00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:17.780
for music that only a
few people could make.

00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:21.130
And this is where the first
Railroad Blues comes from.

00:33:21.130 --> 00:33:26.140
Born in 1894, Sam McGee
lived until 1975

00:33:26.140 --> 00:33:28.920
when he was killed in
a tractor accident.

00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:30.860 position:56%
And he played and recorded for years

00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:35.180
with the great banjoist Uncle
Dave Macon of the Grand Ole Opry.

00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:39.860
Sam McGee could play anything and
when he recorded Railroad Blues

00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:46.090
in 1934 he sounded as if he were
in a cutting contest with himself.

00:33:46.090 --> 00:33:48.880
As if he were not one
but two guitarists.

00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:54.010
As if the two of them facing off
against each other like duelists.

00:33:54.010 --> 00:33:58.710 position:56%
And it's brilliant the way an
instrumental phrase goes up and down

00:33:58.710 --> 00:34:01.210
like a yo-yo and then
slips right back up.

00:34:01.210 --> 00:34:03.490
Now you see it, now you don't.

00:34:03.490 --> 00:34:07.150
But there's something missing,
something only the version

00:34:07.150 --> 00:34:12.090
that McGee recorded precisely
30 years later reveals.

00:34:12.090 --> 00:34:17.620 position:56%
The 1934 version of Railroad Blues
puts the spotlight on the performer,

00:34:17.620 --> 00:34:20.430
the fastest gunslinger in town.

00:34:20.430 --> 00:34:24.720
But by 1964, something
closer to what happened

00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:29.770
when vernacular music was recorded
in the 20's was taking place.

00:34:29.770 --> 00:34:33.490
Many of the people who made
that music were different

00:34:33.490 --> 00:34:35.140
from the people around them.

00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:39.830
They had more nerve, they were less
afraid of the shame of failure,

00:34:39.830 --> 00:34:44.720 position:56%
they had a deeper belief in
themselves, they took greater risks.

00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:48.730
The risk of appearing before a
businessman in a suit who more

00:34:48.730 --> 00:34:50.540
than likely would send you away

00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:53.240
as if you were no better
than anybody else.

00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:57.620
The critic, Robert Christgau
writes tellingly about Dock Boggs.

00:34:57.620 --> 00:35:03.330 position:56%
Boggs passing an audition in his
hometown of Norton, Virginia in 1927

00:35:03.330 --> 00:35:08.240
and then traveling to New York to
record his scary and damn songs

00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:12.900
about death, but so full of beans
at the chance that he's gotten

00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:17.400
that he can barely contain not
his rage, not his resentment,

00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:21.140
not a sense of exclusion, his
fear of embarrassing himself

00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:23.320
in front of New York sharpies.

00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:28.940
What he can't contain is his joy
that he's getting this chance.

00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:32.590
And you can hear the like of
this all through the generic,

00:35:32.590 --> 00:35:37.910
but also unique discs that
Harry Smith compiled in 1952

00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:41.990
for the anthology that at first
he just called flatly American

00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:43.490
Folk Music.

00:35:43.490 --> 00:35:51.910
The thrill at the chance to speak
even only as a faraway premise

00:35:51.910 --> 00:35:57.070
to speak one's peace to the whole
country, even the world at large

00:35:57.070 --> 00:36:02.210
because the Sears catalog not only
sold instruments it sold records

00:36:02.210 --> 00:36:06.990
by Dock Boggs, it sold records
by Sam McGee in Singapore,

00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:15.090
in Tierra del Fuego, in
Barcelona, in Japan, in Turkey.

00:36:15.090 --> 00:36:17.320
The thrill to speak to the country.

00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:22.800 position:56%
The thrill to imagine that you could
speak to the whole world had to be

00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:29.160
at the root of the peculiar spell
that those records cast in 1952

00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:33.340
for Harry Smith and all those
who heard them and the same spell

00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:35.510
that those records cast now.

00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:42.420
When in the 60's folk
revivalists sat before

00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:45.530
such 1920's and 1930's heroes.

00:36:45.530 --> 00:36:50.280
As Mississippi John hurt, Clarence
Ashley, Dock Boggs, [inaudible],

00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:55.130
Skip James, [inaudible] House
they might've celebrated them

00:36:55.130 --> 00:36:58.720
as representatives of
the people, of the folk,

00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:00.760
as the folk musicians of the folk.

00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:04.430
But as they listened
and as they watched,

00:37:04.430 --> 00:37:07.600
as they were thrilled they
may have been responding less

00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:10.170
to what made these
musicians part of the folk

00:37:10.170 --> 00:37:12.990
than what set them
apart from the folk.

00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:16.990
Their ambition, their inner
drive, their inability

00:37:16.990 --> 00:37:20.330
to tolerate their fellow
human beings.

00:37:20.330 --> 00:37:25.740
But the music is nothing if not a
mystery and the mystery that occurs

00:37:25.740 --> 00:37:31.230
when a version of the nation's
story that has been excluded

00:37:31.230 --> 00:37:35.040
from the story as it's
officially told is suddenly offered

00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:36.490
to the public.

00:37:36.490 --> 00:37:38.560
That's what happened in the 1920's

00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:42.330
when southern musicians
produced their version of America

00:37:42.330 --> 00:37:47.040
and taken together they argued
for a more contingent life,

00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:52.030
a less absolute death, an America
where nothing was impossible

00:37:52.030 --> 00:37:54.700
and no settlement was ever final.

00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:58.800
And in this mystery the radical
individualism that you can hear

00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:01.690
in 20's folk music
is always questioned

00:38:01.690 --> 00:38:05.430
and it's questioned
by the same voice.

00:38:05.430 --> 00:38:07.880
One of the most shadowy
features of the music,

00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:12.010
one of the most queer is
the element of anonymity.

00:38:12.010 --> 00:38:17.200
The way the performer seems to step
back from himself or herself back

00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:21.230
into the community of which
the performer is a part

00:38:21.230 --> 00:38:25.760
or if the performer is not part
of a community or sounded as if he

00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:30.890
or she couldn't be the anonymity
of the way the performer seemed

00:38:30.890 --> 00:38:35.730
to slip back into the oblivion
where he or she lived alone.

00:38:35.730 --> 00:38:40.860
Like Paul Muni stepping back from a
camera and into darkness at the end

00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:44.040
of I Was a Fugitive
from a Chain Gang.

00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:48.960
How do you live he's
asked, I steal he says.

00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:52.490
When the tension between the
self-presentation of the artist

00:38:52.490 --> 00:38:58.400
and the anonymous, even seemingly
bodiless being behind the artist

00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:02.300
comes into a verge the result
is something no less exciting

00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:05.250
and no less unsettling
than the appearance

00:39:05.250 --> 00:39:07.240
of the radical individual.

00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:09.730
And this is what I
think is happening

00:39:09.730 --> 00:39:15.090
in Sam McGee's Railroad Blues
as he recorded it in 1964.

00:39:15.090 --> 00:39:19.050
This is no longer the
experienced side man stepping

00:39:19.050 --> 00:39:23.040
out to claim his own career,
to record under his own name,

00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:25.570
to show off all the
tricks in his bag.

00:39:25.570 --> 00:39:29.890
Something bigger is happening and
in a country with more room in it

00:39:29.890 --> 00:39:33.560
than the country present
in the 1934 version,

00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:36.390
a country with more room
in it comes into view.

00:39:36.390 --> 00:39:42.060
And you're hearing someone who's
seen all over the country its past,

00:39:42.060 --> 00:39:46.300
its future and he's made
a remarkable discovery.

00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:51.110
America has never changed
and it never will.

00:39:51.110 --> 00:39:54.320
In a version of the republic
that's enacted in Railroad Blues

00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:58.690
in 1964 nothing matters
but movement.

00:39:58.690 --> 00:40:03.380
How you move, how you carry
yourself, the promises you make

00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:07.330
in your very demeanor, the way
you walk, the way you talk,

00:40:07.330 --> 00:40:11.090
the way your clothes fit, the way
your expression fits your face,

00:40:11.090 --> 00:40:15.370
the way your face somehow
changes everything you see.

00:40:15.370 --> 00:40:19.700
The specter in the music
emerges immediately, the pioneer,

00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:23.490
the wanderer and in his
freedom he threatens those

00:40:23.490 --> 00:40:27.550
who stay home working,
saving, hoping, frightened.

00:40:27.550 --> 00:40:30.220
But he also leaves a blessing

00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:34.980
without living his life you're
allowed to know how it feels.

00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:38.680
So it's no longer Sam McGee,
but a kind of abstraction

00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:46.450
who offers Railroad Blues in
1964 or in 2002, 27 years later

00:40:46.450 --> 00:40:51.190 position:56%
on a Smithsonian folkways collection
called Classic Mountain Songs,

00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:54.710
which is where I first
heard Railroad Blues.

00:40:54.710 --> 00:41:00.800
When McGee recorded in 1934
that signpost that appears

00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:05.020
in the beginning of the song was
crucial, the kickoff to the record.

00:41:05.020 --> 00:41:09.840
Went to the depot looked up on
the board, it said good times here

00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:11.710
but better down the road.

00:41:11.710 --> 00:41:16.320
In 1934 that was a direct
and political statement.

00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:19.650
It had to be said in
1934 in the ditch

00:41:19.650 --> 00:41:24.770 position:56%
of the depression it was the last
thing anybody could take for granted

00:41:24.770 --> 00:41:26.560
if they could believe it all,

00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:29.700
better times down the
road, good times here.

00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:34.690
And the same words are said
in 1964, they're tossed off.

00:41:34.690 --> 00:41:38.190
But as an event in the music
they've already happened,

00:41:38.190 --> 00:41:40.980
you've already heard it,
you've already felt it.

00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:45.590
That swoop, that astonishing
lift, that fat note breaking

00:41:45.590 --> 00:41:47.930 position:56%
into a thousand glittering fragments

00:41:47.930 --> 00:41:52.490 position:56%
as the strings shake have already
called the train before the man gets

00:41:52.490 --> 00:41:54.770
a word out of his mouth.

00:41:54.770 --> 00:41:58.390
Those high notes are no longer
a performer's calling card,

00:41:58.390 --> 00:42:00.160
they have a life of their own.

00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:03.390
Those notes are thinner
with every measure.

00:42:03.390 --> 00:42:07.980
The way the note stretches out
all the way out you can't believe

00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:10.040
that it's still hanging in the air.

00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:15.090
And the way a following note seems
to just barely draw the breath

00:42:15.090 --> 00:42:18.850
of that first note and
then continue the story.

00:42:18.850 --> 00:42:21.980
The bass note that says not
so fast, the notes shoot

00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:25.110
out of the air they don't
pay any attention to it.

00:42:25.110 --> 00:42:29.290
You're sure they're gone
and then they pick up again.

00:42:29.290 --> 00:42:31.790
That's what's uncanny, the sense

00:42:31.790 --> 00:42:34.860
that in the truest tales
the country can tell

00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:38.980
about itself those tales
must be incomplete just

00:42:38.980 --> 00:42:42.540
like that note stretching
out, stretching out

00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:44.990
and never coming to an end.

00:42:44.990 --> 00:42:49.340
Those notes, the country
story has to hang in the air

00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:54.990 position:56%
so that anybody can find it, so that
anybody can take it out of the air.

00:42:54.990 --> 00:42:59.170
And that finally is what took place
at the beginning of this story,

00:42:59.170 --> 00:43:02.470
a story about a certain
historical emergence

00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:05.580
of certain versions
of the American story.

00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:12.170
Now there's one piece of music
that I know that sees every gothic,

00:43:12.170 --> 00:43:17.930
pious, drunken, murdering,
thieving loving figure moving

00:43:17.930 --> 00:43:21.880
through the old American
music for who he or she is

00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:26.750
and embraces them all and song
is Richard Rabbit Brown's James

00:43:26.750 --> 00:43:28.050
Alley Blues.

00:43:28.050 --> 00:43:31.470
It was recorded one day in 1927,

00:43:31.470 --> 00:43:35.490
the only day that Richard
Brown ever recorded.

00:43:35.490 --> 00:43:40.610
And for me that he recorded only
once is like Melville not bothering

00:43:40.610 --> 00:43:43.550
to keep Hawthorne's
letter about Moby Dick,

00:43:43.550 --> 00:43:47.020
the letter of which Melville
could say I spent a sense

00:43:47.020 --> 00:43:52.020
of unspeakable security is
in me because Hawthorne had

00:43:52.020 --> 00:43:56.910
in Melville's unbearably direct
words understood the book.

00:43:56.910 --> 00:44:00.100
We'll never know what
Hawthorne said.

00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:05.170
The smallest, most modest notes
creep out of Brown's guitar

00:44:05.170 --> 00:44:10.120
like tadpoles swimming in search
of their melody, their rhythm

00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:13.540
and a bass note gongs
shaking the air.

00:44:13.540 --> 00:44:18.700
Nothing is pressed, an
old ragged voice sour,

00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:24.220
laughing at its own sourness begins
to tell a story about a marriage.

And he snaps at his strings to drive
a point home, but every time he does

00:44:28.370 --> 00:44:33.260
that a weird gonging is there
pulling the real story away

00:44:33.260 --> 00:44:35.880
from the story that being told.

00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:39.060
Pulling the story away
putting it in the air.

[ Music ]

00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:48.290
When Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller
produce the Drifters' There Goes My

00:47:48.290 --> 00:47:54.240
Baby in 1959, the first time
anybody ever layered the equivalent

00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:57.970
of a complete symphony orchestra
over a piece of rock 'n roll.

00:47:57.970 --> 00:48:01.320
The effect they said was
like a radio dial caught

00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:03.440
between two different stations.

00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:08.020
You can imagine that Rabbit Brown's
James Alley Blues could've had a

00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:12.110
similar effect on those few who
heard it except it would've been

00:48:12.110 --> 00:48:17.370
as if the performer existed between
different eras, different lives,

00:48:17.370 --> 00:48:19.820
different ways of understanding
the world

00:48:19.820 --> 00:48:25.070
and like There Goes My Baby made
you understand that the divisions

00:48:25.070 --> 00:48:27.700
between those things
are meaningless.

00:48:27.700 --> 00:48:29.000
That was the meaning

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:32.690
of that mystical gonging
behind the prosaic facts

00:48:32.690 --> 00:48:34.870
that the singer was relating.

00:48:34.870 --> 00:48:39.140
That was the meaning of the small
searching notes that shot out ahead

00:48:39.140 --> 00:48:42.710
of everything blindly
seeking a destination

00:48:42.710 --> 00:48:44.400
that could never be named.

00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:49.350
It was those same tiny seeking
notes that Sam McGee would seek

00:48:49.350 --> 00:48:55.550
out himself in 1964 -- 1934,
but not truly recapture

00:48:55.550 --> 00:48:58.040
until three decades after that.

00:48:58.040 --> 00:49:01.710
He would from the start
cast off the fatalism

00:49:01.710 --> 00:49:05.360
that Rabbit Brown's notes
carried, the thick fat notes

00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:09.120
that McGee would use to
symbolize escape and liberation.

00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:11.180
That swoop, that up and down,

00:49:11.180 --> 00:49:13.900
that if you don't believe I'm
leaving you can count the days

00:49:13.900 --> 00:49:15.200
I'm gone.

00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:17.430
Notes that in James
Alley Blues are filled

00:49:17.430 --> 00:49:21.530
up by Brown's echoing
flapping gongings not warnings

00:49:21.530 --> 00:49:25.500
of what might happen, but
portends of what will happen.

00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:30.700
In McGee's hands those notes
will no longer speak of death.

00:49:30.700 --> 00:49:35.600
And If Tonight Should End the
World, Man of Constant Sorrow

00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:39.720

00:49:39.720 --> 00:49:42.050
so much as death.

00:49:42.050 --> 00:49:45.730
And James Alley Blues
has room for them too.

00:49:45.730 --> 00:49:50.440
The small notes in James Alley
Blues move like mice scurrying

00:49:50.440 --> 00:49:53.680
from one room to another
and never stopping

00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:57.190
and the house only gets
bigger as they move.

00:49:57.190 --> 00:50:01.480
The man singing James Alley Blues
and you have to imagine him small

00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:08.040 position:56%
and wiry and weary moving carefully,
smiling, looking over his shoulder.

00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:11.500
The man singing James Alley
Blues welcomes them all

00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:15.730
and they enter his house because
they sense that he knows more

00:50:15.730 --> 00:50:17.780
about death than they do.

00:50:17.780 --> 00:50:21.120
But that's not all
Rabbit Brown knows.

00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:25.440
Railroad Blues is frank about the
fact that it's made for pleasure.

00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:30.560
It's an argument that freedom
is more pleasurable than death.

00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:34.210
If Tonight Should End the
World, Man of Constant Sorrow

00:50:34.210 --> 00:50:37.050
and When First Unto this
Country are arguments

00:50:37.050 --> 00:50:40.360
that death is more
meaningful than pleasure.

00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:45.420 position:56%
Arguments that hide their power and
passion or their perfection of form,

00:50:45.420 --> 00:50:48.410
elements of performance
that give pleasure

00:50:48.410 --> 00:50:54.280
because their beauty makes it seem
as if their arguments are true.

00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:57.590
But Rabbit Brown knows
something about pleasure

00:50:57.590 --> 00:51:00.610
that it seems nobody else does.

00:51:00.610 --> 00:51:02.400
He knows how to give pleasure

00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:05.630
as if it were the gift
of a guardian angel.

00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:09.840
And what he leaves behind
the sense of a place so big

00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:12.000
that there's room for anyone.

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:17.640
A place that's too big for anyone
to escape is exactly a story

middle with whoever telling it

middle of Railroad Blues,

middle of James Alley Blue,

00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:31.010

the story unsure

or if he should go back.

&gt;&gt; Hi, I was interested
in interested

00:52:22.350 --> 00:52:26.440
in hearing the Dylan version
of When First Unto this Country

00:52:26.440 --> 00:52:30.360
which I've never heard
partly because what I hear

00:52:30.360 --> 00:52:35.270
in that jangling electric guitar at
the beginning of it is an imitation

00:52:35.270 --> 00:52:40.200 position:56%
of the autoharp of the New Lost City
Ramblers who recorded that song.

00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:44.470
And we have a field
recording here at the library,

00:52:44.470 --> 00:52:47.910
which I believe was the source of
the New Lost City Ramblers version

00:52:47.910 --> 00:52:51.220
and I'm just wondering if those
sort of specific histories

00:52:51.220 --> 00:52:55.960
of individual songs and
performances touch on the sort

00:52:55.960 --> 00:53:00.590
of more general historical
context of these songs

00:53:00.590 --> 00:53:01.890
that you're talking about.

00:53:01.890 --> 00:53:07.430
&gt;&gt; Greil Marcus: Yeah, I
mean threads of scholarship,

00:53:07.430 --> 00:53:10.880
the kind of knowledge that
you're talking about move all

00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:14.270
through this story, but secretly.

00:53:14.270 --> 00:53:17.810
Bob Dylan's knowledge of the
kind of music that I was talking

00:53:17.810 --> 00:53:20.370
about tonight is enormous.

00:53:20.370 --> 00:53:25.640 position:56%
And I mean knowledge of who recorded
when and in what city and who was

00:53:25.640 --> 00:53:27.090
that person recording with

00:53:27.090 --> 00:53:30.280
and who was the engineer
that kind of knowledge.

00:53:30.280 --> 00:53:33.510
And so what you've just
said there's no way

00:53:33.510 --> 00:53:37.290
that he didn't know the New
Lost City Ramblers' version

00:53:37.290 --> 00:53:39.040
and it's very, very likely

00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:42.570
that he knows the other
version you're talking about too

00:53:42.570 --> 00:53:45.380
and that all that goes in there.

00:53:45.380 --> 00:53:51.060
And it's a way of keeping the
story going and passing the baton

00:53:51.060 --> 00:53:54.710
from one person to another,
but also changing it.

00:53:54.710 --> 00:53:58.510
Because there is a different --
because yes the autoharp melody

00:53:58.510 --> 00:54:03.560
and even the orchestration is
there in that guitar opening and

00:54:03.560 --> 00:54:07.110
yet there's a different kind of
drama, there's more glamour to it,

00:54:07.110 --> 00:54:11.570
there's more cinematic suspense,
you know, it's in color.

00:54:11.570 --> 00:54:14.520
At least that's how I hear it.

00:54:14.520 --> 00:54:20.010
But you're completely right that
that's all present and, you know,

00:54:20.010 --> 00:54:21.480
it's present all through.

00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:26.120
None of these people who I was
talking about tonight were ignorant

00:54:26.120 --> 00:54:28.610
of what anybody else was
doing, they were all listening,

00:54:28.610 --> 00:54:36.840
they're all in competition, they're
all stealing from each other.

00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:41.820
&gt;&gt; You kind of the at the end you
finished with the Rabbit Brown

00:54:41.820 --> 00:54:47.300
or all the fellows the story
that had to start in the middle

00:54:47.300 --> 00:54:51.210 position:56%
and the speaker didn't know, the
singer didn't know if they should be

00:54:51.210 --> 00:54:54.430
or head back or heading forward.

00:54:54.430 --> 00:55:03.690
So I wonder if you think Rabbit
Brown knew just how powerful he was

00:55:03.690 --> 00:55:08.730
when he was recording that song
and the meaning that he was getting

00:55:08.730 --> 00:55:11.250
out of it or is that something

00:55:11.250 --> 00:55:15.400
that comes later once the
audience gets to hear it.

00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:18.880
&gt;&gt; Greil Marcus: Well look here's
a guy he's a New Orleans street

00:55:18.880 --> 00:55:25.570
singer, he really supported
himself by standing

00:55:25.570 --> 00:55:30.650
around Lake Pontchartrain and
offering to serenade couples

00:55:30.650 --> 00:55:34.160
when they would take a boat
out on Lake Pontchartrain.

00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:39.370
And can you imagine, you
know, you're about to propose

00:55:39.370 --> 00:55:41.600
to someone you think it would
be really romantic to go

00:55:41.600 --> 00:55:44.600
out on the lake and wow,
we'll get this guy to sing

00:55:44.600 --> 00:55:48.280
and he'll sing something really
lovely and create the mood

00:55:48.280 --> 00:55:50.650
and he sings James Alley Blues.

00:55:50.650 --> 00:55:58.040
So here's this person and he
gets once chance to record

00:55:58.040 --> 00:56:03.690
and nobody knows exactly when he
was born, he died I think in 1935.

00:56:03.690 --> 00:56:07.970
And he gets one chance to record

00:56:07.970 --> 00:56:11.500
and he can probably figure he's
never going to get another chance,

00:56:11.500 --> 00:56:15.070
you know, maybe somebody told
the record scout you ought

00:56:15.070 --> 00:56:18.760
to hear this guy or maybe somebody
was hanging around the lake

00:56:18.760 --> 00:56:23.130
and heard him gives him a
chance to record for Victor,

00:56:23.130 --> 00:56:25.550
you know, for a major company.

00:56:25.550 --> 00:56:28.470
And this is his chance,
this is his one chance.

00:56:28.470 --> 00:56:30.770
He records five songs that day.

00:56:30.770 --> 00:56:33.870
And this is his song, this is
the one he's really worked on,

00:56:33.870 --> 00:56:38.220
this is the one he's crafted
out of pieces of other old songs

00:56:38.220 --> 00:56:40.570
that he's put together
in his own way.

00:56:40.570 --> 00:56:45.980
That he's worked out an arrangement
for and he knows this is a chance

00:56:45.980 --> 00:56:48.690
to get it right, he's never
going to get another chance.

00:56:48.690 --> 00:56:52.270
I think it's the greatest
record ever made and I don't say

00:56:52.270 --> 00:56:54.650
that as any kind of joke.

00:56:54.650 --> 00:56:59.510
From the time I first heard
it I thought this must be.

00:56:59.510 --> 00:57:03.130
That was let's see
that was 40 years ago

better yet, so maybe so.

Yeah, yeah.

00:57:12.290 --> 00:57:20.190
And so one of other recording he
made of the five was a version

00:57:20.190 --> 00:57:22.990
of the Titanic and it's a version

00:57:22.990 --> 00:57:25.510

any I've ever heard.

00:57:25.510 --> 00:57:27.530

conventional,

00:57:27.530 --> 00:57:30.710
the way he dramatizes them is not.

00:57:30.710 --> 00:57:33.310
You know, he says you know
and this was happening

00:57:33.310 --> 00:57:38.190
and oh my God can you believe
this and have you heard.

00:57:38.190 --> 00:57:43.750 position:56%
But this is a version of the Titanic
takes into itself the knowledge

00:57:43.750 --> 00:57:47.210
that everybody in the
African-American community knew.

00:57:47.210 --> 00:57:51.950
That the Titanic advertised
itself not only is unsinkable,

00:57:51.950 --> 00:57:57.500
which is what's come down
to us, but as all white.

00:57:57.500 --> 00:58:00.950
Not only were there no black
people allowed as passengers,

00:58:00.950 --> 00:58:05.790
not only were there no black people
employed as stewards or waiters

even going to have black people

in the boiler room
beneath the hold, nowhere.

But there was one black person who
stowed away on that ship according

00:58:24.010 --> 00:58:30.410 position:56%
to many versions of the song and I
won't go into what happens with him.

00:58:30.410 --> 00:58:35.890
The way Rabbit Brown sings the
song the Titanic when he gets

00:58:35.890 --> 00:58:40.680
into nearer my God, then the
way he stretches out the line.

00:58:40.680 --> 00:58:45.640

much glee, with so much delight

at all these people going
down, it's really something.

not like this perfect record

00:58:54.290 --> 00:58:57.650

up at all the women on
the ship who began pulling

up their dresses saying take me,
take me I'll give you anything

00:59:28.050 --> 00:59:32.920

back and went away.

00:59:38.070 --> 00:59:41.520
&gt;&gt; I'm interested in this
question or this statement you made

00:59:41.520 --> 00:59:43.980
that the lobby singers were
invested with this kind

00:59:43.980 --> 00:59:45.940
of radical individualism.

00:59:45.940 --> 00:59:48.000
And if I heard you right, you said

00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:49.980
if this is this a republic
that's made to scatter.

00:59:49.980 --> 00:59:54.680
And that is so different than
the folk music revival that was

00:59:54.680 --> 00:59:58.900
so invested in this sort of
social collective and this idea

00:59:58.900 --> 01:00:01.290
of a republic, a different
kind of republic

01:00:01.290 --> 01:00:03.570
that was based on those
kind of ideals.

01:00:03.570 --> 01:00:06.550
So I wonder if you could speak
a little bit about the tensions

01:00:06.550 --> 01:00:10.920
that were there between these
people that were coming to perform

01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:13.320
at these folk festivals in Newport

01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:17.590 position:56%
and whatnot they were considered the
folk by the folk movement revival,

01:00:17.590 --> 01:00:22.650 position:56%
but perhaps were coming with as you
say different ambitions and whatnot.

01:00:22.650 --> 01:00:25.120
&gt;&gt; Greil Marcus: Well, I mean
it's a question of ideology

01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:27.660
and it's a question of
ideas that people bring

01:00:27.660 --> 01:00:30.650
to an event before they've
experienced the event.

01:00:30.650 --> 01:00:32.710
An idea of somebody's identity

01:00:32.710 --> 01:00:36.170
that you already form before
you've ever met that person.

01:00:36.170 --> 01:00:43.130
And, you know, Mike Bloomfield
described this maybe better

01:00:43.130 --> 01:00:44.650
than anybody.

01:00:44.650 --> 01:00:53.270
He said, man's lips had played
electric guitar for years in Texas,

01:00:53.270 --> 01:00:57.010
but when the people from the
Newport folk festival brought him

01:00:57.010 --> 01:01:00.760
up they made him leave his
electric guitar behind.

01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:04.480
He said they treated him
as if he was the tar baby,

01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:09.420
meaning just a figure from
black folklore not a real person

01:01:09.420 --> 01:01:12.320
who could make his own decisions
about how we wanted to play

01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:14.530
and how he wanted to sound.

01:01:14.530 --> 01:01:19.010
He had to be brought forth as
a representative of the folk

01:01:19.010 --> 01:01:21.950
and the folk didn't
play no electric guitar.

01:01:21.950 --> 01:01:26.440
That's the best way I
can answer it briefly.

01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:32.640
&gt;&gt; So were there any
tensions there [inaudible]?

01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:35.440
&gt;&gt; Greil Marcus: Yeah, I mean
there was tremendous tension.

01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:37.940
I mean you take somebody
like Clarence Ashley,

01:01:37.940 --> 01:01:44.990
somebody like Skip James who were
ordinary disagreeable proud people

01:01:44.990 --> 01:01:51.140
and they were, you know, put in
yo9u know kind of musical forums

01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:55.880
where the whole point would
be to illustrate a genre.

01:01:55.880 --> 01:02:00.440 position:56%
And these people would say I'm not a
genre, you know, this is what I have

01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:03.600 position:56%
to say, this is my way of saying it.

01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:06.620
And, you know, there would
be a lot of anger there

01:02:06.620 --> 01:02:09.370
and sometimes it would come
out and sometimes it wouldn't.

01:02:09.370 --> 01:02:11.960
And often it would come out
though in the performances

01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:17.090
that you saw that one could see.

01:02:17.090 --> 01:02:21.150
Someone's going to have to
tell me when I have to leave.

01:02:21.150 --> 01:02:23.290
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] one more question.

01:02:23.290 --> 01:02:24.590
&gt;&gt; Greil Marcus: Okay.

01:02:24.590 --> 01:02:27.900
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] invite
everybody to the book signing.

01:02:27.900 --> 01:02:29.370
&gt;&gt; Greil Marcus: If
there is one more?

01:02:29.370 --> 01:02:34.770
I didn't mean to be intimidating.

01:02:34.770 --> 01:02:36.130
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Well thank
you very much all for coming.

01:02:36.130 --> 01:02:37.430
Thank you.

01:02:37.430 --> 01:02:38.730
&gt;&gt; Greil Marcus: Thank you.

01:02:38.730 --> 01:02:40.030
&gt;&gt; Anne McLean: Greil
Marcus very, very much.

01:02:40.030 --> 01:02:41.700
&gt;&gt; Greil Marcus: Thank
you for coming.

01:02:41.700 --> 01:02:44.070
