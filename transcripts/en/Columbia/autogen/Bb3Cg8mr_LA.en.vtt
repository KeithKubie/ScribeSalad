and that is one question and if I may
 

00:43:09.599 --> 00:43:12.740
and that is one question and if I may
pose another question and that is a

00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:12.750
pose another question and that is a
 

00:43:12.750 --> 00:43:17.859
pose another question and that is a
number of colleagues make references to
