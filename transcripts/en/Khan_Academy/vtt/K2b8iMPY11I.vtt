00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.113
- What I hope to do in this video

00:00:01.113 --> 00:00:03.691
is emphasize the relation, the connection,

00:00:03.691 --> 00:00:05.435
between fractions and division

00:00:05.435 --> 00:00:07.199
and then using that knowledge

00:00:07.199 --> 00:00:10.926
to help us simplify some
hairy looking fractions.

00:00:10.926 --> 00:00:12.958
So, let's say, let's just
do a little bit of a review.

00:00:12.958 --> 00:00:17.958
So, if I say two divided
by, two divided by three,

00:00:18.762 --> 00:00:21.893
two divided by three,
I could write this as,

00:00:21.893 --> 00:00:25.678
I could write this as two over three.

00:00:25.678 --> 00:00:29.975
Two divided by, two divided by three.

00:00:29.975 --> 00:00:31.856
So, this expression here,
sometimes we might say,

00:00:31.856 --> 00:00:34.234
"Hey, this is 2/3. Think
of it as a fraction."

00:00:34.234 --> 00:00:38.821
But you can also view this
as two divided by three.

00:00:38.821 --> 00:00:40.537
So, if we went the other way around.

00:00:40.537 --> 00:00:43.885
If someone were to write four over,

00:00:43.885 --> 00:00:45.740
actually, let me just do
it in a different color,

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:50.353
if someone were to say four, 4/9,

00:00:50.353 --> 00:00:55.332
four, four over nine,
we could interpret this,

00:00:55.332 --> 00:00:59.500
this could be interpreted
as four divided by nine.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.616
Four divided by nine.

00:01:01.616 --> 00:01:04.400
In fact, if we wanted
to, if wanted to convert

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.594
this into a decimal that's
exactly what we would do.

00:01:06.594 --> 00:01:08.779
We would calculate what
four divided by nine is.

00:01:08.779 --> 00:01:10.857
We would divide nine into four.

00:01:10.857 --> 00:01:14.036
Four divided by nine.

00:01:14.036 --> 00:01:15.115
So, this is all review.

00:01:15.115 --> 00:01:16.671
So, let's just use this knowledge

00:01:16.671 --> 00:01:20.655
and I'll think more complex fractions.

00:01:20.655 --> 00:01:22.673
So, if someone were to say,

00:01:22.673 --> 00:01:25.910
actually, let me just take
this example right over here,

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.932
if someone were to say two over,

00:01:28.932 --> 00:01:30.941
instead of saying two over three.

00:01:30.941 --> 00:01:33.516
If they said two over, I don't know,

00:01:33.516 --> 00:01:37.338
let me say two over 2/3.

00:01:37.338 --> 00:01:41.018
Two over 2/3. Well, what
would this simplify to?

00:01:41.018 --> 00:01:42.422
Well, we could go the other way around.

00:01:42.422 --> 00:01:45.799
This is the same thing
as two divided by 2/3.

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:47.285
So, let's write it like that.

00:01:47.285 --> 00:01:50.781
This is the same thing as two

00:01:50.781 --> 00:01:55.781
divided by, two divided by
2/3, two divided by 2/3,

00:01:58.105 --> 00:02:00.538
which is the same thing as,

00:02:00.538 --> 00:02:02.281
dividing by a fraction's the same thing

00:02:02.281 --> 00:02:04.914
as multiplying by its reciprocal.

00:02:04.914 --> 00:02:06.391
So, this is going to be the same thing

00:02:06.391 --> 00:02:11.195
as two times, two times
the reciprocal of 2/3,

00:02:12.195 --> 00:02:14.808
which is, we swap the
denominator and the numerator,

00:02:14.808 --> 00:02:17.722
two times three over two.

00:02:17.722 --> 00:02:19.821
So, two times three halves,

00:02:19.821 --> 00:02:21.518
if I have three halves twice, well,

00:02:21.518 --> 00:02:22.870
that's just going to be equal to,

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.232
that's going to be equal to six halves,

00:02:25.232 --> 00:02:27.029
and six halves, you can view that as,

00:02:27.029 --> 00:02:28.891
well, two halves is a whole,

00:02:28.891 --> 00:02:30.458
so this is gonna be three wholes.

00:02:30.458 --> 00:02:31.816
Or you can say six divided by two.

00:02:31.816 --> 00:02:33.834
Well, that's just gonna be equal to three.

00:02:33.834 --> 00:02:34.949
You can view it either way.

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:36.911
And then that is equal to three.

00:02:36.911 --> 00:02:38.259
Let's do a few more of these.

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:41.229
And let's keep making them a
little bit more complicated.

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:42.694
Just let me get some good practice.

00:02:42.694 --> 00:02:44.027
And like always, pause the video.

00:02:44.027 --> 00:02:46.395
You should get excited when
you see one of these things.

00:02:46.395 --> 00:02:50.068
And pause the video and see
if you can do it on your own.

00:02:50.068 --> 00:02:52.292
All right, let's do
something really interesting.

00:02:52.292 --> 00:02:57.179
Let's say negative 16 over nine

00:02:58.262 --> 00:03:03.241
over, over, I'll do this in a tan color,

00:03:03.695 --> 00:03:08.695
over, let's say, three over seven.

00:03:09.012 --> 00:03:12.272
What is this? Can you simplify
this complex fraction?

00:03:12.272 --> 00:03:14.933
Can you simplify this
expression over here?

00:03:14.933 --> 00:03:16.860
Well, once again, we can view

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.854
this as negative 16/9 divided by 3/7.

00:03:20.854 --> 00:03:23.733
So, this could be rewritten as,

00:03:23.733 --> 00:03:27.109
and I can write it either
as negative 16 over 9

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:31.474
or I could rewrite it as negative 16/9.

00:03:31.474 --> 00:03:33.099
So, I can put the negative
in front of the whole,

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:35.352
in front of the whole fraction like that,

00:03:35.352 --> 00:03:38.357
or I could say that it's
negative 16 over nine,

00:03:38.357 --> 00:03:40.822
or I can even write this as
negative 16 over negative nine.

00:03:40.822 --> 00:03:41.901
Those would all be equivalent.

00:03:41.901 --> 00:03:44.653
But right now I'm writing at negative 16/9

00:03:44.653 --> 00:03:47.300
and I am going to now divide,

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.991
we can interpret this complex fraction

00:03:49.991 --> 00:03:52.176
as dividing it by 3/7.

00:03:52.176 --> 00:03:55.192
Dividing by 3/7.

00:03:55.192 --> 00:03:57.574
And so, this is going to be equal to,

00:03:57.574 --> 00:04:01.113
this is going to be
equal to negative 16/9,

00:04:01.113 --> 00:04:03.598
negative 16 over nine.

00:04:03.598 --> 00:04:06.837
Actually, let me just rewrite
it as negative 16 over nine.

00:04:06.837 --> 00:04:09.973
Negative 16 over nine just
to show that we can do it.

00:04:09.973 --> 00:04:12.051
Times the reciprocal of this.

00:04:12.051 --> 00:04:15.859
So, times 7/3.

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:18.109
I just swap the numerator
and the denominator.

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:20.816
Times, do that same brown color,

00:04:20.816 --> 00:04:25.443
times, times 7/3, and now
what am I going to get?

00:04:25.443 --> 00:04:29.112
In the numerator, I have
negative 16 times seven.

00:04:29.112 --> 00:04:30.182
Let me think about it.

00:04:30.182 --> 00:04:31.935
10 times seven is 70.

00:04:31.935 --> 00:04:34.254
Six times seven is 42.

00:04:34.254 --> 00:04:37.101
70 plus 42 is 112.

00:04:37.101 --> 00:04:39.980
So, this, so this part right over here,

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:43.078
this part right over here
would be negative 112.

00:04:43.078 --> 00:04:48.078
Negative 112 over nine times three.

00:04:49.128 --> 00:04:54.128
Nine times three is 20,
nine times three is 27.

00:04:55.627 --> 00:04:56.301
And there you have it.

00:04:56.301 --> 00:04:58.601
You can view this as negative 112 over 27

00:04:58.601 --> 00:05:00.169
or you can put the negative up front

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:01.446
and you can say, "Hey, this is hinting

00:05:01.446 --> 00:05:05.589
"as negative 112, 112/27."

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:10.339
112/27 and just to make
everything come full circle

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:14.251
you can view this as
negative 112 divided by 27

00:05:14.251 --> 00:05:18.342
or negative 112/27. Either way.
