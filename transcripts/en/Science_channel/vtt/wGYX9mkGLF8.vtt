♪♪

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:04.868
I'VE ACTUALLY HAD
SOME CLOSE CALLS

00:00:04.868 --> 00:00:07.067
WITH LITHIUM BATTERIES,
SUCH AS THIS ONE.

00:00:07.067 --> 00:00:08.534
MY FRIEND ACTUALLY
HAD AN RC CAR,

00:00:08.534 --> 00:00:10.467
AND HE WENT TO GO CHARGE
HIS BATTERY,

00:00:10.467 --> 00:00:13.834
AND THEY SUSPECTED THAT
THE BATTERY CAUSED HIS GARAGE

00:00:13.834 --> 00:00:15.501
TO LITERALLY BURN DOWN.

00:00:15.501 --> 00:00:17.267
Narrator:
LITHIUM POLYMER BATTERIES

00:00:17.267 --> 00:00:19.100
USE A DIFFERENT KIND
OF ELECTROLYTE,

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.834
AND THEIR RELATIVELY
LIGHT WEIGHT

00:00:20.834 --> 00:00:22.501
MAKES THEM IDEAL FOR GADGETS

00:00:22.501 --> 00:00:25.534
LIKE JESSE'S PAL'S
ILL-FATED RC CAR.

00:00:27.934 --> 00:00:30.067
NOW THAT WE'RE MOVING ON
TO OUR BIGGER BATTERIES

00:00:30.067 --> 00:00:33.734
THAT CAN RELEASE TOXIC FUMES,
WE HAVE TO WEAR RESPIRATORS.

00:00:33.734 --> 00:00:36.067
SAFETY FIRST, RIGHT, GUYS?

00:00:36.067 --> 00:00:37.767
RIGHT.

00:00:37.767 --> 00:00:39.934
Jesse: THIS IS LITHIUM
POLYMER RC BATTERY

00:00:39.934 --> 00:00:42.901
IN THREE, TWO, ONE...

00:00:46.834 --> 00:00:48.968
Valerie: CONTACT.

00:00:48.968 --> 00:00:50.901
-OOH!
-OOH!

00:00:50.901 --> 00:00:52.634
OH, IT'S SMOKING!

00:00:52.634 --> 00:00:55.000
AH!
-OH!

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.534
OH, GOD.

00:00:56.534 --> 00:00:57.567
OH, MY GOD.

00:00:57.567 --> 00:00:59.734
STOP!

00:00:59.734 --> 00:01:01.367
Narrator:
IT'S THE PROOF THEY NEED

00:01:01.367 --> 00:01:03.734
THAT A LITHIUM-BASED BATTERY
CAN IGNITE UNDER PRESSURE,

00:01:03.734 --> 00:01:07.534
AND WHEN YOU'RE ON A ROLL...

00:01:07.534 --> 00:01:08.834
HEY,
LET'S TRY THIS ONE.

00:01:08.834 --> 00:01:10.100
OH, WHAT IS THAT?

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.467
SAME AS BEFORE, LITHIUM
POLYMER, JUST BIGGER.

00:01:12.467 --> 00:01:14.334
MM.
ALL RIGHT.

00:01:14.334 --> 00:01:16.367
THAT LOOKS SCARY.

00:01:16.367 --> 00:01:18.467
IT'S AROUND TWICE THE VOLTAGE
OF THE BATTERY

00:01:18.467 --> 00:01:20.567
THAT JUST WENT UP IN SMOKE.

00:01:20.567 --> 00:01:21.801
VALERIE,
ARE YOU READY FOR THIS?

00:01:21.801 --> 00:01:23.534
-YES!
-ALL RIGHT.

00:01:23.534 --> 00:01:25.667
THIS IS BIGGER
LITHIUM POLYMER

00:01:25.667 --> 00:01:30.234
IN THREE, TWO, ONE...

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.033
HERE WE GO!

00:01:35.033 --> 00:01:37.000
CONTACT!

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.501
IT LOOKS LIKE THE MUNCHER
HAS ONLY SUCCEEDED

00:01:39.501 --> 00:01:43.267
IN MAKING ANOTHER LITHIUM
FLAPJACK, UNTIL...

00:01:43.267 --> 00:01:45.033
OOH!

00:01:45.033 --> 00:01:46.334
OH, MY GOODNESS.

00:01:46.334 --> 00:01:47.300
WOW!

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.033
THAT IS A LOT OF SMOKE.

00:01:49.033 --> 00:01:51.067
WOW!

00:01:51.067 --> 00:01:53.167
OH, MY GOD.

00:01:53.167 --> 00:01:55.901
AND YOU KNOW THE OLD SAYING --

00:01:55.901 --> 00:01:58.934
"WHERE THERE'S SMOKE,
THERE'S GENERALLY"...

00:01:58.934 --> 00:02:02.133
-OH, IT'S ON FIRE!
-IT'S ON FIRE!

00:02:02.133 --> 00:02:05.133
WE HAVE A FIRE!
-IT'S ON FIRE NOW!

00:02:05.133 --> 00:02:06.801
Narrator:
THE FLIR CAMERA CONFIRMS

00:02:06.801 --> 00:02:08.567
THAT THEY'VE GOT
WHAT THEY WANTED --

00:02:08.567 --> 00:02:11.133
HIGH-PRESSURE COMBUSTION.

00:02:11.133 --> 00:02:13.868
WE GOT SPARKS,
SMOKE AND EVEN FIRE.

00:02:13.868 --> 00:02:16.567
AWESOME FOR US, BUT NOT SO GREAT
FOR OUR GARBAGE MAN.

00:02:16.567 --> 00:02:18.467
WE ALSO FOUND OUT
THAT THE HIGHER THE VOLTAGE

00:02:18.467 --> 00:02:21.467
THE BATTERY WAS AT,
WE GOT MORE EXPLOSIVE RESULTS.

00:02:21.467 --> 00:02:22.834
Narrator: THE HIGHER VOLTAGE

00:02:22.834 --> 00:02:24.801
CREATES A HIGHER CURRENT
WHEN SHORTED,

00:02:24.801 --> 00:02:27.300
WHICH GENERATES
A HIGHER TEMPERATURE.
