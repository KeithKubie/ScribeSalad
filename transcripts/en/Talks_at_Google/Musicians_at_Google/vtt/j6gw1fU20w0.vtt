I'm Bradley Horowitz head

And we've done lots
of things in Charlie's.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.967
We've had lots of
interesting events here.

00:00:23.967 --> 00:00:25.600
But today is the first time,

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.500
to my knowledge,

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.333
we're going to host a Broadway
production here in Charlie's.

00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:31.500
Are you guys ready for that?

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.400

Bradley Horowitz: So as you know,

00:00:36.067 --> 00:00:38.600
we're excited to host
the cast and the creators

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.367
of the amazing productions
of "American Idiot".

00:00:42.367 --> 00:00:44.467
And Green Day band members

00:00:44.467 --> 00:00:46.067
Billy Joe Armstrong, Mike Dirnt,

00:00:46.067 --> 00:00:48.900
and Tre Cool brought
"American Idiot" to stage,

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.633
beginning with the Berkeley Rep Theatre.

00:00:50.633 --> 00:00:52.100
Go Berkeley!

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.500
Here in the bay area.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.867
So this is something of
a homecoming for the show.

00:00:56.867 --> 00:00:58.533
We wanna thank SHN,

00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:03.033

productions to San Francisco.

00:01:03.033 --> 00:01:05.967

bringing them here today.

To get going,
we're gonna start off with a brief video

00:01:22.367 --> 00:01:25.267
that explains the creation
of "American Idiot"

00:01:25.267 --> 00:01:26.733
So let's  through the video.

Male Narrator: In 2004,

00:01:31.633 --> 00:01:34.000
Green Day released "American Idiot"

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.267

rock music.

the album launched the band
into super-stardom.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.533
Selling over 12 million copies.

00:01:51.533 --> 00:01:55.000

for Rock Album of the Year.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.167
While on Broadway,

00:01:56.167 --> 00:01:58.833
Tony award winning director,
Michael Mayer,

00:01:58.833 --> 00:02:02.400
was assembling one of the most
innovative teams in the theater

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.133
to joining with Green Day 

00:02:04.133 --> 00:02:07.033
and bring "American Idiot"
to the stage.

00:02:07.033 --> 00:02:10.233
Michael Mayer: The idea of
theatricalizing this album

00:02:10.233 --> 00:02:13.967
came to me just from listening to it
over and over again.

00:02:13.967 --> 00:02:17.833
And hearing a very strong
emotional narrative

00:02:17.833 --> 00:02:21.067
that was this story
of American youth.

00:02:21.067 --> 00:02:24.200
Looking to improve their lives.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.967
And I felt like that's just
such a great coming of age story.

00:02:27.967 --> 00:02:32.967
Tom Kitt: I was able to hear a really
intense beautiful story right away.

that feels like

00:02:34.567 --> 00:02:37.533
it's new and fresh and pushing
the boundaries.

That I think that
when all's said and done,

00:02:40.133 --> 00:02:43.300
"American Idiot" is going to
have a very important place

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.500

Male Narrator: The stage version
of "American Idiot"

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.333
had its world premier at Berkeley Rep
in September 2009.

00:02:56.333 --> 00:02:57.767
After two extensions,

00:02:57.767 --> 00:03:00.100

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.800

I kind of lead my friends
into this catharsis of,

00:03:10.133 --> 00:03:11.967
there's gotta be something
else out there.

I don't know what it is.

00:03:13.567 --> 00:03:15.700

Rebecca Naomi Jones: I think
immediately in the first time

00:03:17.067 --> 00:03:20.267
that you see our characters meet,

00:03:20.267 --> 00:03:22.467
there's this very quick kind of like,

00:03:22.467 --> 00:03:25.367

And he shows her almost
like a sweet gesture to her

00:03:28.567 --> 00:03:31.667

and makes her feel warm

00:03:31.667 --> 00:03:34.467

the first national tour launched

00:04:30.767 --> 00:04:32.733

00:04:32.733 --> 00:04:35.900
They're here in San Francisco
for about the next four weeks.

So I've got some questions.

00:05:33.067 --> 00:05:34.567
We'll see where the conversation goes.

00:05:34.567 --> 00:05:36.267
I'm sure these folks
have some questions.

00:05:36.267 --> 00:05:39.100
And most of all we're here
to see you perform.

00:05:39.633 --> 00:05:42.900
But, I wanna start out with
the opening of the show.

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.967
'Cause it opens with big crashing guitars.

00:05:45.967 --> 00:05:47.533
Explosive choreography.

00:05:47.533 --> 00:05:48.667
In your face vocals.

00:05:48.667 --> 00:05:51.333
And I heard it's also very loud.

00:05:51.333 --> 00:05:54.333
So what is it like to sort
of pummel the audience

00:05:54.333 --> 00:05:56.900
that way with your first blow?

00:05:57.967 --> 00:05:59.800
Van Hughes: Well, we call it
a punk rock assault,

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.167
 theater style.

00:06:01.167 --> 00:06:02.600
[chuckles]

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.733
Yeah, it starts with,

00:06:04.733 --> 00:06:07.033
like you said,
like an explosion.

00:06:07.033 --> 00:06:07.667
And for us too,

00:06:07.667 --> 00:06:09.400
it's like getting launched out
of a cannon.

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.900
'Cause we do this show
eight times a week,

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:16.733
and it's pretty tiring.

00:06:16.733 --> 00:06:17.333
I guess.

00:06:17.333 --> 00:06:18.900
So we're all pretty fatigued.

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:22.233
But as soon as you hear that
"dah nah nah nah, dah nah nah"

00:06:22.233 --> 00:06:23.833
That kind of like gets you going.

00:06:23.833 --> 00:06:26.067
And the girls launch out
onto the stage

00:06:26.067 --> 00:06:29.400
with fury of all hell breaking loose.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.567
And you see it on the faces
of the audience.

00:06:32.567 --> 00:06:35.867
I mean the audiences are like
"What is this?"

00:06:35.867 --> 00:06:36.567
You know.

00:06:36.567 --> 00:06:38.933
And then the show takes
a completely different turn

00:06:38.933 --> 00:06:41.800
and kind of packs an emotional
punch by the end.

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.400
But we definitely start out
with quite the assault.

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.133
Bradley Horowitz: Yeah.

00:06:46.133 --> 00:06:50.767
I think this is different than
any musical theater or concert

00:06:50.767 --> 00:06:51.633
or production.

00:06:51.633 --> 00:06:53.833
It's sort of like a new art form.

00:06:53.833 --> 00:06:54.833
In a lot of ways.

00:06:54.833 --> 00:06:57.333
It's different than anything
that's come before.

00:06:57.333 --> 00:06:58.767
And one of the differences is that

00:06:58.767 --> 00:07:01.133
almost all the narrative
is done through song.

00:07:01.133 --> 00:07:03.433
There's not a lot of interstitial breaks

00:07:03.433 --> 00:07:05.933
where you sort of get into deep dialogue.

00:07:05.933 --> 00:07:07.400
The song is the story.

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.867
And I wondered if some of you
could comment on what that's like.

00:07:10.867 --> 00:07:13.567
Is it harder to be constrained
by the songs?

00:07:13.567 --> 00:07:17.567
Do you sort of wish there could
be more Greek chorus explanation

00:07:17.567 --> 00:07:18.400
of what's going on?

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.967
Or does it work for you guys.

00:07:20.967 --> 00:07:23.367
Okieriete Onaodowan: Well,
I know for me,

00:07:23.367 --> 00:07:25.767
a lot of my friends and people
who see this show,

00:07:25.767 --> 00:07:26.600
they really enjoy it

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:29.800
because it does have a way of

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:30.933
engaging the audience 

00:07:30.933 --> 00:07:33.433
and connecting with you emotionally.

00:07:33.433 --> 00:07:35.800
Without the need of much prose.

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:36.933
Without all of that dialog.

00:07:36.933 --> 00:07:38.233
Which is what's really beautiful.

00:07:38.233 --> 00:07:42.133
And it also allows the show to
move at that breakneck pace.

00:07:42.133 --> 00:07:44.300
Because there's not the time
to talk about things

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:46.367
and shift stuff and set all the things.

00:07:46.367 --> 00:07:48.333
It's just go, go, go, go, go.

00:07:48.333 --> 00:07:50.433
And everything is so well written
and the music is so rich

00:07:50.433 --> 00:07:52.200
that you don't really need words.

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.033
Ideally that's why you sing
your musical theater.

00:07:54.033 --> 00:07:55.567
Because words aren't enough.
So.

00:07:55.567 --> 00:07:56.733
Jake Epstein: Well, it's interesting

00:07:56.733 --> 00:07:59.167
because it becomes very personal
as an actor.

00:07:59.167 --> 00:08:00.767
All of a sudden you
don't have words.

00:08:00.767 --> 00:08:03.233
You kinda have to fill
in the blanks yourself.

00:08:03.233 --> 00:08:06.300
So all the songs
that you're singing,

00:08:07.567 --> 00:08:08.800
they come from you.

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.233
Because you don't
have any other choice.

00:08:11.233 --> 00:08:13.000
There's nothing else to
kind of hang yourself on.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.500
You have to kind of sketch out
your character for yourself.

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:18.067
A lot of it.

00:08:18.067 --> 00:08:20.267
So I know that

00:08:20.267 --> 00:08:22.633
when I first saw the show
as an audience member,

00:08:22.633 --> 00:08:24.167
before I was in the cast.

00:08:24.167 --> 00:08:25.700
Seeing all these people
sing these songs

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:26.600
and not knowing a lot
about them,

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:29.900
I saw these people singing these
songs as opposed to characters.

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:32.400
And I really connected with that.

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:34.733
Matt DeAngelis: There's such
a rich history and tradition

00:08:34.733 --> 00:08:36.800
with rock operas in musical
theater anyway.

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:38.700
This is certainly an evolution 
and it's a different thing

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:39.667
and it's crazy.

00:08:39.667 --> 00:08:42.000
But like "Jesus Christ superstar"
and like "Tommy" 

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.500
and shows that are completely
sung through

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:45.767
have always kinda had a place
in the industry.

00:08:45.767 --> 00:08:46.767
And we,

00:08:46.767 --> 00:08:48.767
well, not we specifically 
but the creative team

00:08:48.767 --> 00:08:50.967
and everybody took it
to a new level with this.

00:08:50.967 --> 00:08:52.667
Which is kinda cool.

00:08:52.667 --> 00:08:54.167
Bradley Horowitz: So are
you guys punks?

00:08:54.167 --> 00:08:56.400
Or are you theater geeks?
[laughs]

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:58.467
Cast members: Both.
Yeah. [chuckling]

00:08:58.467 --> 00:08:59.000
Bradley Horowitz: Of course.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.533
Van Hughes: Well punk rock
is just kinda just saying

00:09:00.533 --> 00:09:01.500
"This is what I am,

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:02.300
 and deal with it."

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:02.767
You know?

00:09:02.767 --> 00:09:05.300
So I think a lot of us
have that in our core.

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:06.767
Bradley Horowitz: Yeah.

00:09:06.767 --> 00:09:07.667
I can tell from looking at you.

00:09:07.667 --> 00:09:09.100
[laughter]

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:10.400
OK.

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:12.000
The bond of Johnny, Tunny, and Will

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.367
is evident from the beginning.

00:09:13.367 --> 00:09:14.767
Van, Scott and Jake,

00:09:14.767 --> 00:09:17.033
can you briefly tell us
who your characters are

00:09:17.033 --> 00:09:18.500
and about the bond that they share?

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:20.700
And specifically do you
think this is like,

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:23.867
emblematic of a moment
when the album was released,

00:09:23.867 --> 00:09:27.600
or is this sort of a characteristic
of bonding

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.200
that happens throughout time?

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:30.833
For youth.

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:33.367
Van Hughes: Well, I play Johnny,

00:09:33.367 --> 00:09:34.900
the "Jesus of Suburbia."

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:36.133
And,

00:09:36.133 --> 00:09:38.533
we start the play with me
having this idea

00:09:38.533 --> 00:09:42.933
that we're going to leave
our suburban waste town

00:09:42.933 --> 00:09:45.200
and see what else is out there.

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.467
Move to the big city.

00:09:46.467 --> 00:09:50.267
So I'm kind of like rallying
my best friends in the world

00:09:50.267 --> 00:09:51.300
to go for it with me.

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:53.367
And I'm like "Here are the bus tickets,
we're outta here."

00:09:53.367 --> 00:09:54.700
You know?

00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:00.333
And I think that's like one of
the most universal feelings

00:10:00.333 --> 00:10:02.033
that anyone has ever felt,

00:10:02.033 --> 00:10:03.367
especially in America.

00:10:03.367 --> 00:10:06.767
Where you wanna go out 

00:10:06.767 --> 00:10:08.700
and discover what else there is,
you know.

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:12.300
I think it goes all the way back
to what Plato said.

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:14.567
About finding the real truth.

00:10:14.567 --> 00:10:17.133
Like sometimes you have to ignore
what your family is telling you.

00:10:17.133 --> 00:10:18.967
Because they're seeing you
a certain way.

00:10:18.967 --> 00:10:22.600
And you just have to completely
embrace a new idea.

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:26.533
Scott Campbell: I like it
'cause these characters are drawn

00:10:26.533 --> 00:10:31.133
in such a way where they really
lean on each other at the top.

00:10:31.133 --> 00:10:33.400
I mean it's a really kind of,

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.233
typical kinda setup.

00:10:35.233 --> 00:10:36.967
Where all you have is each other.

00:10:36.967 --> 00:10:40.000
And you know you're stuck in
this monotonous day to day.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.467
This complacency.

00:10:41.467 --> 00:10:43.267
This need to search for something else.

00:10:43.267 --> 00:10:43.900
And I mean,

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:46.667
we've all had our best buds
from high school.

00:10:46.667 --> 00:10:49.867
And you know our family
situations as the characters,

00:10:49.867 --> 00:10:51.533
vary greatly.

00:10:51.533 --> 00:10:54.033
But one thing we have is each other

00:10:54.033 --> 00:10:55.767
and when we,

00:10:55.767 --> 00:10:58.267
when Johnny gets those bus tickets,

00:10:58.267 --> 00:11:00.067
it's really like a uniting force.

00:11:00.067 --> 00:11:03.200
And then of course we each
have our own pitfalls

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:07.367
and traps that we fall into
as our characters.

00:11:07.367 --> 00:11:14.633
But the bond that we share as actors
on stage is really quite special.

00:11:14.633 --> 00:11:16.833
Jake Epstein: yeah, the very
first lines of the song

00:11:16.833 --> 00:11:19.833
Jesus of Suburbia is 
"I'm the son of rage and love."

00:11:19.833 --> 00:11:22.300
And I feel like that's the thing that
really bonds these three guys together.

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:23.600
They're angry dudes,

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:25.000
but they like love each other.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.800
There's kind of a "bromance"
going on in the show.

00:11:29.033 --> 00:11:30.000
And Michael Mayer. 

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.133
Bradley Horowitz: So is
that with the characters,

00:11:31.133 --> 00:11:32.833
or is it with you guys?

00:11:32.833 --> 00:11:33.900
Jake Epstein: Both I guess.

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:36.233
Van Hughes: Both,
I think it translates to both.

00:11:36.233 --> 00:11:38.800
I mean, we gotta swallow
each other's sweat

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:40.000
and everything every night. 

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.200
Jake Epstein: We're spitting
on each other a lot.

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:42.567
Bradley Horowitz: Too much
information.

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:45.000
Jake Epstein: No, I mean it is, 

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.500
at the end of the day,

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:49.733
"American Idiot" tells the story
of all these lost souls

00:11:49.733 --> 00:11:51.400
trying to find their place in the world.

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:54.833
But at the end of the day
it is a love story.

00:11:54.833 --> 00:11:56.467
Of a bunch of friends.

00:11:56.467 --> 00:11:58.933
Who are there trying
to help each other out.

00:11:58.933 --> 00:12:00.833
And they kinda get lost
along the way.

00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:05.967
And then you see what happens
to them and where they end up.

00:12:05.967 --> 00:12:08.300
Bradley Horowitz: OK,  
so early in the production

00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:09.733
"Boulevard of Broken Dreams."

00:12:09.733 --> 00:12:12.800
It's sorta the first chance
the audience gets to breathe

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:14.167
after being,

00:12:14.167 --> 00:12:16.300
assaulted,
I think was the word you used.

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:17.667
Van,  can you set up the song

00:12:18.967 --> 00:12:21.700
and tell us about how you
approach it everynight?

00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:24.200
Van Hughes: Well the song starts
with this monologue 

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:27.833
which is one of the more direct
speeches to the audience

00:12:27.833 --> 00:12:29.400
that my character gives.

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:33.300
And one of the lines
that really stands out is,

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:35.300
 "The end of the world is over."

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:36.600
'Cause we explain that 

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:39.067
the end of the world is sort
of our 7-11 parking lot

00:12:39.067 --> 00:12:40.633
in our suburban town.

00:12:40.633 --> 00:12:44.300
And this is the first moment
I've gotten to,

00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:45.200
let's say,
New York City.

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:47.133
Or whatever big city we move to.

00:12:47.133 --> 00:12:48.767
And I realize that

00:12:48.767 --> 00:12:52.133
wow, this is like a whole
world of possibilities.

00:12:52.133 --> 00:12:54.233
And the joy of saying

00:12:54.233 --> 00:12:55.900
"I walk alone

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:58.933
and I can do whatever
I want with my life".

00:12:58.933 --> 00:13:00.600
And I think that's
what the song's about.

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:01.367
Bradley Horowitz: Alright,
enough talking.

00:13:01.367 --> 00:13:02.300
Let's hear it.

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:03.467

00:17:10.233 --> 00:17:12.467
Van, if you're gonna use any
more of that salty language

00:17:12.467 --> 00:17:14.267
you have to give us notice
so we can bleep that.

00:17:14.267 --> 00:17:15.300
[laughter] 

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:15.867
Van Hughes: They said I could!

00:17:15.867 --> 00:17:17.433
Bradley Horowitz: OK.
I'm just kidding.

00:17:18.233 --> 00:17:19.733
We can handle it.

00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:22.067
OK, cool.
So --

00:17:22.067 --> 00:17:25.667
several of you were in the original
Broadway production.

00:17:25.667 --> 00:17:28.667
And others have joined the cast
for the touring company.

00:17:28.667 --> 00:17:31.867
For those of you that actually
weren't part of the original one

00:17:31.867 --> 00:17:33.000
but were spectators,

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.567
that actually got to see that
in the audience.

00:17:35.567 --> 00:17:37.733
Can you tell us what it's like to,

00:17:37.733 --> 00:17:40.400
I guess first tell us your own
first experience of the show.

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:43.400
And whether you ever imagined
you'd be in the show.

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:46.367
And what it's like to sort
of be on the other side.

00:17:46.367 --> 00:17:49.200
Matt DeAngelis: I think I might win the award
for the biggest "American Idiot" geek.

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:52.000
I saw it five times on Broadway.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:52.967
Always in the front row.

00:17:52.967 --> 00:17:54.133
To the point that
some of the actors,

00:17:54.133 --> 00:17:55.300
some of whom I knew beforehand,

00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:56.233
and some I didn't,

00:17:56.233 --> 00:17:57.000
were like "Oh, Matt's back.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.300
He's right there in the front."

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:02.533
I thought that it really
was genre changing.

00:18:02.533 --> 00:18:04.100
Bradley Horowitz: Do you guys
have a name for those people?

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:04.700
Is it idiots?

00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:05.167
female member: Idiots.

00:18:05.167 --> 00:18:06.200
Matt DeAngelis: Idiots.

00:18:07.433 --> 00:18:08.500
It was genre changing.

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:09.633
And I, like Jake said,

00:18:09.633 --> 00:18:10.500
to piggy back on that.

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:12.400
I thought that the story
was incredible.

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:13.100
The music was incredible.

00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:15.733
But the passion of the actors
was what blew my mind.

00:18:15.733 --> 00:18:19.100
Just to see 20,

00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:20.367
 how many people were
up there on Broadway?

00:18:20.367 --> 00:18:21.267
A couple more than we have now.

00:18:21.267 --> 00:18:23.933
But 20 something people
just sweating and singing

00:18:23.933 --> 00:18:26.533
and giving it every ounce
of energy that they had.

00:18:26.533 --> 00:18:29.167
And on Broadway especially
if you're in the front two rows,

00:18:29.167 --> 00:18:30.967
I mean, I was three feet away
from them

00:18:30.967 --> 00:18:32.533
and it was the coolest thing.

00:18:32.533 --> 00:18:34.100
Bradley Horowitz: How'd
you get those seats?

00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:36.967
Matt DeAngelis: You get lotteries in
New York for those kinds of seats.

00:18:36.967 --> 00:18:37.967
Bradley Horowitz: [laughs] OK.

00:18:37.967 --> 00:18:39.133
Cool.

00:18:39.133 --> 00:18:39.700
Anyone else.

00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:40.733
Kelvin Moon Loh: Oh yeah.

00:18:40.733 --> 00:18:44.067
I actually was an usher
at the Broadway house

00:18:44.067 --> 00:18:44.967
that it was playing at.

00:18:44.967 --> 00:18:46.967
And I remember it was my night job.

00:18:46.967 --> 00:18:48.533
And some auditioning in the city.

00:18:48.533 --> 00:18:50.700
And I came and saw it for free.

00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:52.567
Sorry I didn't pay for that first ticket.

00:18:52.567 --> 00:18:53.867
But I saw it,

00:18:53.867 --> 00:18:54.967
I beat you Matt,

00:18:54.967 --> 00:18:59.733
 I think I saw the show as
an usher maybe 50 times.

00:18:59.733 --> 00:19:01.333
[laughter]

00:19:01.333 --> 00:19:03.500
And you know,  usually at that job

00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:05.833
you're able to go out into the lobby

00:19:05.833 --> 00:19:07.533
and you can just sit and read a book,

00:19:07.533 --> 00:19:10.000
but I found myself drawn
to this show

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.867
and I called my agent up the next day
and said " You know what?

00:19:12.867 --> 00:19:15.200
This is the thing that
I'm supposed to be doing.

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:16.900
I can do it all.

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:17.667
I swear to you,

00:19:17.667 --> 00:19:19.133
I'll do the girls' parts, too,

00:19:19.133 --> 00:19:20.100
if I have to."

00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:22.733
So yeah,  it was quite an experience 

00:19:22.733 --> 00:19:26.833
and I am a huge musical
theater geek first.

00:19:26.833 --> 00:19:29.533
And I've never seen
anything like this before.

00:19:29.533 --> 00:19:32.367
And it's a remarkable piece.

00:19:32.367 --> 00:19:36.867
Bradley Horowitz: So you guys do
the show every night or many times.

00:19:36.867 --> 00:19:40.100
And does your relationship
to the content change?

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:41.600
Does anyone have a story about,

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:43.300
what it was like the first time.

00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:47.333
Or what it's like the hundredth
time to get up there and do it.

00:19:47.333 --> 00:19:48.767
Christina Alabado: I think
the coolest thing about the show

00:19:48.767 --> 00:19:52.133
is that every night 
we do it eight times a week,

00:19:52.133 --> 00:19:54.200
so you bring something fresh
to it every time.

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:56.967
And the content is so emotional,

00:19:56.967 --> 00:19:58.567
and it's so heavy,

00:19:58.567 --> 00:19:59.167
a lot of it.

00:19:59.167 --> 00:20:00.100
That it,

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:02.600
for me, I never have one show
that's the same.

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:05.367
I feel like I bring in
what I'm feeling that day.

00:20:05.367 --> 00:20:08.100
Or what I just experienced
and it changes

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:09.967
and it makes it fresh every single time.

00:20:09.967 --> 00:20:11.933
And that's the beauty
of the choreography.

00:20:11.933 --> 00:20:13.233
The beauty of what we're singing.

00:20:13.233 --> 00:20:15.367
Because the choreography is
so specific, Steven Hoggett's,

00:20:15.367 --> 00:20:16.867
 that you really,

00:20:16.867 --> 00:20:18.667
you put yourself into it every time.

00:20:18.667 --> 00:20:19.733
So it is set,

00:20:19.733 --> 00:20:21.267
and we each do the same thing.

00:20:21.267 --> 00:20:24.333
But it's with your own flair to it.

00:20:24.333 --> 00:20:24.833
And stuff.

00:20:24.833 --> 00:20:28.133
And that's why I think it's such
a cool piece to do as an actor

00:20:28.133 --> 00:20:29.200
and as a human being.

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:31.567
Because it never gets old.

00:20:31.567 --> 00:20:32.067
Ever.

00:20:32.067 --> 00:20:34.467
'Cause it's just always something new.

00:20:34.467 --> 00:20:36.067
Bradley Horowitz: That's great.

00:20:36.067 --> 00:20:37.100
You wanna say something else.

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:38.567
You wanna add to that?

00:20:38.567 --> 00:20:39.133
She nailed it?

00:20:39.133 --> 00:20:40.033
Okay. 
Cool.

00:20:40.033 --> 00:20:40.667
Jarran Muse: Spot on.

00:20:41.533 --> 00:20:44.467
Bradley Horowitz: So you talked
a little bit about the choreography.

00:20:44.467 --> 00:20:46.933
I wanna talk about the creative
team behind the show.

00:20:46.933 --> 00:20:50.067
Michael Mayer who won a Tony
for "Spring Awakening."

00:20:50.067 --> 00:20:53.833
Music supervisor Tom Kitt who won
a Pulitzer for "Next to Normal."

00:20:53.833 --> 00:20:55.433
Choreographer Steven Hoggett.

00:20:55.433 --> 00:20:58.267
Associate director Johanna McKeon.

00:20:58.267 --> 00:21:01.733
Associate choreographer
Lorin Latarro.

00:21:01.733 --> 00:21:03.800
This is quite a group of creatives 

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:05.667
that have helped put
this show together.

00:21:05.667 --> 00:21:07.533
Do you guys work with them still?

00:21:07.533 --> 00:21:09.033
Is that an ongoing relationship?

00:21:09.033 --> 00:21:09.867
And what's that like?

00:21:09.867 --> 00:21:11.167
Leslie McDonal: They just left today.

00:21:11.167 --> 00:21:12.000
[laughter]

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.933
Yeah, they came to Seattle last week

00:21:14.933 --> 00:21:16.467
to prep us for this city.

00:21:16.467 --> 00:21:18.333
Just to check in on us,
you know.

00:21:18.333 --> 00:21:19.767
And keep the show in good shape.

00:21:19.767 --> 00:21:20.467
Fresh.

00:21:20.467 --> 00:21:22.533
Bradley Horowitz: Are they
still meddling?

00:21:22.533 --> 00:21:23.567
Leslie McDonal: Yeah.
All the time.

00:21:23.567 --> 00:21:25.467
Jake Epstein: Well, from the last
question that you asked,

00:21:25.467 --> 00:21:26.867
you're saying is it new every night?

00:21:26.867 --> 00:21:27.833
It is new every night,

00:21:27.833 --> 00:21:29.233
 and so over time,

00:21:29.233 --> 00:21:32.533
 what was sort of set as
the show can become you know,

00:21:32.533 --> 00:21:33.567
 something different.

00:21:33.567 --> 00:21:34.633
Stuff can get big.

00:21:34.633 --> 00:21:35.667
Or too big.

00:21:35.667 --> 00:21:37.700
And so every now and then
the creatives will come

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:39.167
and drop in on us 

00:21:39.167 --> 00:21:41.100
and kinda reign it back in.

00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:41.900
They'll sometimes say,

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:42.900
just to like.

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:45.000
Bradley Horowitz: Or to concede
you're actually doing it better

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.100
than they ever imagined.

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:48.467
Jake Epstein: That doesn't
happen too often.

00:21:48.467 --> 00:21:50.533
[laughter] But yeah. Maybe.

00:21:50.533 --> 00:21:53.900
Leslie McDonal: I know
in the Broadway production,

00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:56.933
11 months in our choreographer
came and said,

00:21:56.933 --> 00:21:59.967
"Actually let's change the choreography
in 'Whatsername.'

00:21:59.967 --> 00:22:00.767
Now do this,

00:22:00.767 --> 00:22:02.233
 and throw youíre
the way this way."

00:22:02.233 --> 00:22:03.767
Just to like,

00:22:03.767 --> 00:22:05.367
freshen it up a bit.

00:22:05.367 --> 00:22:05.967
Bradley Horowitz: Mess it up.

00:22:05.967 --> 00:22:07.667
Leslie McDonal: Not 'cause we
weren't doing it right, but.

00:22:07.667 --> 00:22:08.833
Bradley Horowitz: Cool.

00:22:08.833 --> 00:22:12.467
So another major member
of the creative team obviously

00:22:12.467 --> 00:22:13.667
is Billy Joe Armstrong.

00:22:13.667 --> 00:22:17.533
And he's so fond of the project he
actually appeared as Saint Jimmy

00:22:17.533 --> 00:22:19.133
for a number of weeks.

00:22:19.133 --> 00:22:21.467
Have some of you had
the chance to meet him?

00:22:21.467 --> 00:22:23.633
And what was that like?

00:22:23.633 --> 00:22:26.000
Gabrielle McClinton: He did
surprise us in Costa Mesa.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.800
Which was amazing.

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:29.567
And only a couple of us knew.

00:22:29.567 --> 00:22:31.067
Thank God I didn't know
'cause I woulda freaked out

00:22:31.067 --> 00:22:32.233
if I woulda known he was there.

00:22:32.233 --> 00:22:33.567
But that was the first time I met him

00:22:33.567 --> 00:22:35.533
and I think a lot of us had met him.

00:22:35.533 --> 00:22:37.667
And he was so warm,

00:22:37.667 --> 00:22:39.167
and he loved the show.

00:22:39.167 --> 00:22:40.867
Bradley Horowitz: So you met
him before the performance?

00:22:40.867 --> 00:22:41.500
Gabrielle McClinton: That was my first,

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:42.933
no, after the performance.

00:22:42.933 --> 00:22:44.567
Thank God.

00:22:44.567 --> 00:22:45.867
But I know some of us,

00:22:45.867 --> 00:22:47.833
some of the people in the cast
got to work with him.

00:22:47.833 --> 00:22:49.200
I know Van did.

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:51.300
Van Hughes: Yeah, the last two
months of the Broadway run

00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:53.133
I had played this role.

00:22:53.133 --> 00:22:54.333
The Johnny role.

00:22:54.333 --> 00:22:57.067
And the last three
weeks of the run,

00:22:57.067 --> 00:22:59.300
Billy Joe Armstrong played
Saint Jimmy with me.

00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:01.033
And it was so amazing 

00:23:01.033 --> 00:23:03.933
because he would switch it up
every single night.

00:23:03.933 --> 00:23:06.100
I mean, to where he was like
grabbing me by the face

00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:08.467
and making out with me
some nights.

00:23:08.467 --> 00:23:09.667
And then like,

00:23:09.667 --> 00:23:13.467
he proposed to me on stage
at the encore one night.

00:23:13.467 --> 00:23:15.467
And like he,
talk about keeping it fresh.

00:23:15.467 --> 00:23:18.600
We were playing off
each other so much.

00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:20.733
It made this whole new life.

00:23:20.733 --> 00:23:22.467
You know, and I had been
doing the show

00:23:22.467 --> 00:23:24.200
for almost a year at that point.

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:26.967
So I mean, just to see
all the new possibilities

00:23:26.967 --> 00:23:27.967
that could come out
of the show,

00:23:27.967 --> 00:23:29.867
it was pretty amazing.

00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:31.700
Bradley Horowitz: So,

00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:34.067
speaking of Saint Jimmy.

00:23:34.067 --> 00:23:37.333
There's a lot of speculation on
sort of what the character means,

00:23:37.333 --> 00:23:39.067
 on the internet.

00:23:39.067 --> 00:23:40.233
Is he a drug dealer?

00:23:40.233 --> 00:23:42.600
Is he a manifestation
of Johnny's addiction?

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:45.300
Or some sort of
combination of both?

00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:46.167
So Joshua,

00:23:46.167 --> 00:23:48.567
how did you approach the multiple
layers of the character

00:23:48.567 --> 00:23:52.167
and what do you try to bring
to the performance?

00:23:52.167 --> 00:23:57.333
Joshua Kobak: I try to
just enlighten Johnny

00:23:57.333 --> 00:24:01.433
with all the wrong ways to do it.

00:24:01.433 --> 00:24:03.733
Inside I'm trying to help this guy

00:24:03.733 --> 00:24:07.133
and show him and awesome life.

00:24:07.133 --> 00:24:09.000
Albeit through heroin.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.833
Or crystal meth.

00:24:10.833 --> 00:24:11.633
Or E.

00:24:11.633 --> 00:24:12.833
Or glitter.

00:24:12.833 --> 00:24:16.533
[laughter]

00:24:16.533 --> 00:24:19.033
But, yeah, I mean,

00:24:19.033 --> 00:24:20.400
he's Bacchus.

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:22.433
He's Dionysus.

00:24:22.433 --> 00:24:24.567
He's the god of addiction.

00:24:24.567 --> 00:24:25.667
That's,

00:24:25.667 --> 00:24:26.700
 you know,

00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:27.967
he's not of this world.

00:24:27.967 --> 00:24:31.267
The only person that really makes
that we really make eye contact

00:24:31.267 --> 00:24:33.100
is me and Johnny.

00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:34.300
Me and Whatsername.

00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:35.100
She never looks at me.

00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:36.600
I'll look directly at her 
but she can't look at me

00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:38.767
'cause I don't exist in her world.

00:24:38.767 --> 00:24:39.800
It's kinda cool.

00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:41.533
Bradley Horowitz: I have to say,
you're very well cast.

00:24:41.533 --> 00:24:46.767
[laughter] 

00:24:46.767 --> 00:24:47.867
Joshua Kobak: I'll see you after.

00:24:47.867 --> 00:24:49.533
[laughing] 

00:24:49.533 --> 00:24:50.800
Bradley Horowitz: OK.

00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:52.733
There's another moment
later in the production.

00:24:52.733 --> 00:24:53.867
The song "21 Guns"

00:24:53.867 --> 00:24:56.233
that proves to be another
turning point for Johnny.

00:24:56.233 --> 00:24:58.867
He's pushed to some pretty
violent behavior

00:24:58.867 --> 00:25:00.167
at the end of "Know Your Enemy"

00:25:00.167 --> 00:25:02.667
and is torn between his angels
and his demons.

00:25:02.667 --> 00:25:03.733
Gabby, can you tell us

00:25:03.733 --> 00:25:05.667
how you approach this song each night

00:25:05.667 --> 00:25:08.800
from the point of view of
the character "Whatsername?"

00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:11.967
Gabrielle McClinton: Well, every
night it's definitely very different.

00:25:11.967 --> 00:25:15.633
I'm always feeling
an array of emotions.

00:25:15.633 --> 00:25:17.367
It's definitely the most vulnerable thing

00:25:17.367 --> 00:25:21.567
I've ever had to sing or perform
in my lifetime.

00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:24.500
And right before it happens,

00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:27.233
Johnny tries to kill me with a knife.

00:25:27.233 --> 00:25:30.833
'Cause he's on a drug
induced moment.

00:25:30.833 --> 00:25:32.367
Bradley Horowitz: Thanks to him.

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:34.433
Joshua Kobak: Missed it
by that much.

00:25:34.433 --> 00:25:35.600
[laughter] 

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:36.900
Gabrielle McClinton: So right
before I sing "21 Guns",

00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:37.833
that happens.

00:25:37.833 --> 00:25:41.100
My emotions are definitely
at the top

00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:42.833
and just, everywhere.

00:25:42.833 --> 00:25:44.867
I don't even know where to begin.

00:25:44.867 --> 00:25:47.200
And as soon as the song starts

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:48.867
it's all about nurturing Johnny

00:25:48.867 --> 00:25:51.167
and putting him before myself.

00:25:51.167 --> 00:25:54.467
And caring about someone so much

00:25:54.467 --> 00:25:56.467
that you would do anything
for them.

00:25:56.467 --> 00:25:57.900
And,

00:25:57.900 --> 00:25:59.300
yeah.

00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:00.833
That's what she does.

00:26:00.833 --> 00:26:02.233
Bradley Horowitz: So all
this drugs and debauchery,

00:26:02.233 --> 00:26:03.333
we've heard lots of stories.

00:26:03.333 --> 00:26:04.600
There's been a lot of talk
on the internet

00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:07.100
about how that spills over
into the actual cast.

00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:07.933
Any stories?

00:26:07.933 --> 00:26:08.667
No, I'm just kidding.

00:26:08.667 --> 00:26:10.433
[laughter]

00:26:10.433 --> 00:26:11.167
Um,

00:26:11.167 --> 00:26:12.233
[laughing] 

00:26:12.233 --> 00:26:13.233
Leslie McDonal: Go on.

00:26:13.233 --> 00:26:15.433
Bradley Horowitz: OK. 
So "21 Guns"

00:26:15.433 --> 00:26:16.867
We're gonna actually have a chance

00:26:16.867 --> 00:26:18.567
to hear them perform "21 Guns."

00:26:18.567 --> 00:26:19.367
And after that

00:26:19.367 --> 00:26:22.267
we're gonna be able to
take questions here live.

00:26:22.267 --> 00:26:24.233
As you guys know
there's mics set up here.

00:26:24.233 --> 00:26:27.500
But first let's hear the cast
perform "21 Guns."

00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:34.967

[applause and cheering]

00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:25.567
Bradley Horowitz: Alright,
thank you.

00:31:25.567 --> 00:31:28.167
So those with questions,

00:31:28.167 --> 00:31:31.200
please line up at either
of the mics there.

00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:33.667
And in the meantime
I'm gonna fire off a few

00:31:33.667 --> 00:31:35.600
while you guys think of some.

00:31:36.833 --> 00:31:40.667
So there's been a trend
in the past probably ten years

00:31:40.667 --> 00:31:41.967
to create musicals 

00:31:41.967 --> 00:31:44.233
based on a body of work
of a recording artist.

00:31:44.233 --> 00:31:46.733
Things like Abba with "Mama Mia",

00:31:46.733 --> 00:31:48.200
 Billy Joel with "Moving Out."

00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:50.367
Queen with "We Will Rock You."

00:31:50.367 --> 00:31:53.600
"American Idiot" is unusual in
that it's not only from one group,

00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:55.967
 but from a single album.

00:31:55.967 --> 00:31:58.567
The narrative of the play was
already present to an extent

00:31:58.567 --> 00:32:00.500
when the album was created.

00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:01.900
How much of the story,

00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:03.067
we see in the play,

00:32:03.067 --> 00:32:04.367
was fleshed out later on?

00:32:04.367 --> 00:32:07.267
And how much do you guys
believe was sort of intent

00:32:07.267 --> 00:32:09.867
upon the original launch of the album?

00:32:13.467 --> 00:32:15.233
Leslie McDonal: The mention
of certain characters names,

00:32:15.233 --> 00:32:18.633
I mean, how many songs do
they mention Saint Jimmy in?

00:32:18.633 --> 00:32:20.033
Or like when he says [singing]

00:32:20.033 --> 00:32:22.133
♪ Johnny says
it's better than here. ♪

00:32:22.133 --> 00:32:23.700
And that's in "Novocain."

00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:26.333
Almost every song mentions
one of the character's names.

00:32:26.333 --> 00:32:28.700
Jake Epstein: It's actually Jimmy
in the original album.

00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:30.000
Leslie McDonal: OK.
Right.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:30.933
The name and we changed it.

00:32:30.933 --> 00:32:32.933
So they mention the
names of Jesus of Suburbia.

00:32:32.933 --> 00:32:35.433
We say that quite a few times
in all the different songs.

00:32:35.433 --> 00:32:40.200
So it's clear that they were intending
there to be a through-line.

00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:45.267
My character for sure
is a creation.

00:32:45.267 --> 00:32:47.633
How do we explain, you know,
the song "Dearly Beloved."

00:32:47.633 --> 00:32:50.267
There'll be a pregnant girl.

00:32:50.267 --> 00:32:51.200
So there are certain things.

00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:54.600
But Billy Joe did it with
our director Michael Mayer.

00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:56.500
They came up with
everything together.

00:32:56.500 --> 00:33:00.133
So it still had Green Day's ideas
as the influence

00:33:00.133 --> 00:33:02.300
for how the story was fleshed out.

00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:03.033
Bradley Horowitz: Cool.

00:33:03.033 --> 00:33:04.400
OK, I see we have big lines.

00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:06.967
Why don't we take on
this side first.

00:33:08.433 --> 00:33:11.000
male #1: Hi. I'm really excited
to see you at the Orpheum.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.767
So I have a quick question.

00:33:13.767 --> 00:33:14.900
I know as an audience member 

00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:16.767
I'll take away tons of things
from the performance.

00:33:16.767 --> 00:33:18.800
But I wanna ask you,
as a cast,

00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:20.200
what's something that you
wish audience members

00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:21.000
that would take away.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.667
That may be a nuanced
gesture on stage,

00:33:23.667 --> 00:33:25.200
or a thematic thing

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:27.633
that may get lost at the Orpheum.

00:33:27.633 --> 00:33:30.067
What's something I can
keep my eye out for?

00:33:32.367 --> 00:33:34.133
Jake Epstein: Well, I mean,
this is a personal thing.

00:33:34.133 --> 00:33:35.200
But my character Will,

00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:37.367
I never leave the stage.

00:33:37.367 --> 00:33:38.867
I'm literally,

00:33:38.867 --> 00:33:39.733
my character,

00:33:39.733 --> 00:33:41.500
the three guys are gonna
go to the city

00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:43.867
and I find out that Heather,
my girlfriend,

00:33:43.867 --> 00:33:44.433
is pregnant.

00:33:44.433 --> 00:33:46.733
So I stay behind.

00:33:46.733 --> 00:33:48.867
And a lot of people don't know
that I never leave the stage.

00:33:48.867 --> 00:33:50.367
So through everything going on,

00:33:50.367 --> 00:33:52.967
check me out in the corner.
[laughter]

00:33:52.967 --> 00:33:53.867
See what's goin' on.

00:33:53.867 --> 00:33:58.200
[laughter] 

00:33:59.067 --> 00:34:01.100
Bradley Horowitz: This is like
an actor's dream role, right?

00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:01.800
[laughter] 

00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:02.600
Jake Epstein: It is and it isn't.

00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:04.733
Bradley Horowitz: Was it written
this way or did you just?

00:34:04.733 --> 00:34:06.967
Jake Epstein: No, that's
how it was created.

00:34:06.967 --> 00:34:12.333
[laughter] 

00:34:12.333 --> 00:34:12.933
Bradley Horowitz: Great question.

00:34:12.933 --> 00:34:14.867
OK, let's alternate to this side.

00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:18.033
female #1: I was wondering
what the audition process was like

00:34:18.033 --> 00:34:19.200
for the show?

00:34:22.233 --> 00:34:24.400
Nicci Claspell: Yeah,
it was different for everybody.

00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:25.367
Me, personally,

00:34:25.367 --> 00:34:27.367
I wasn't in the Broadway cast at all,

00:34:27.367 --> 00:34:31.000
but I did audition for the tour
in Los Angeles where I'm from.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:36.033
For me, it was a weekend
with a series of auditions.

00:34:36.033 --> 00:34:37.033
You see certain people,

00:34:37.033 --> 00:34:37.967
and you see more people.

00:34:37.967 --> 00:34:38.767
And then you have to dance,

00:34:38.767 --> 00:34:41.000
you have to sing some more songs.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.367
There's other people for this tour
who were in the Broadway cast

00:34:44.367 --> 00:34:45.700
who were asked to come back.

00:34:46.667 --> 00:34:50.433
Actually Jillian there was supposed
to be in the Broadway cast

00:34:50.433 --> 00:34:51.200
and then they had to close.

00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:55.633
So right before she was
gonna start rehearsals,

00:34:55.633 --> 00:34:58.233
she wasn't able to.

00:34:58.233 --> 00:35:00.100
Unfortunately.

00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:02.467
female #1: What about
for the Broadway production?

00:35:05.367 --> 00:35:09.067
Jennifer Bowles: I auditioned
for the show a lot of times.

00:35:09.067 --> 00:35:10.267
Many, many times.

00:35:10.267 --> 00:35:12.033
And I actually didn't get it twice.

00:35:12.033 --> 00:35:15.867
Because I wasn't quite right for
both tracks that I went in for.

00:35:16.633 --> 00:35:22.867
And so I probably, total, auditioned
for it about eight times.

00:35:22.867 --> 00:35:24.633
And then right before Christmas,

00:35:24.633 --> 00:35:26.733
I just got a random phone call.

00:35:26.733 --> 00:35:29.167
Just asking if I wanted
to be in the show.

00:35:29.167 --> 00:35:31.400
And I kinda thought I was
being punked a little bit.

00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:32.100
[laughter] 

00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:33.233
But it was true.

00:35:33.233 --> 00:35:34.833
So then I started rehearsal
like that Monday.

00:35:34.833 --> 00:35:37.167
It was a Friday and
I started it Monday.

00:35:37.167 --> 00:35:37.767
female #1: Cool.

00:35:37.767 --> 00:35:38.733
Jennifer Bowles: So, it was neat.

00:35:38.733 --> 00:35:40.433
Bradley Horowitz: So, is there
a question behind the question?

00:35:40.433 --> 00:35:42.133
I mean, you are at a mic?

00:35:43.067 --> 00:35:43.700
female #1: No.

00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:48.733
[laughter] 

00:35:49.767 --> 00:35:51.033
male #2: Yes.

00:35:51.033 --> 00:35:54.667
I would guess that for this show
a lot of the audience

00:35:54.667 --> 00:35:58.500
has heard the music
and the lyrics before.

00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:02.933
How does that change things for you
as performers 

00:36:02.933 --> 00:36:05.167
when you're going
to an audience that

00:36:05.167 --> 00:36:07.167
at least thinks they know the show?

00:36:07.167 --> 00:36:09.967
Versus something that's completely
new to an audience?

00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:14.133
Gabriel Antonacci: I think it's' actually
one of the things that helps us.

00:36:14.133 --> 00:36:18.400
Because the audience
knows the music.

00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:21.233
So when a song starts
that they know,

00:36:21.233 --> 00:36:22.400
 it actually,

00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:24.867
you can feel a ripple
of energy sometimes.

00:36:24.867 --> 00:36:25.967
You know,
for the big songs.

00:36:25.967 --> 00:36:26.667
Like "Holiday."

00:36:26.667 --> 00:36:28.633
Like "21 Guns."

00:36:28.633 --> 00:36:30.333
Even "Boulevard of Broken Dreams."

00:36:30.333 --> 00:36:33.167
Sometimes we'll get applause off
the top of those songs

00:36:33.167 --> 00:36:35.533
because of the recognition.

00:36:35.533 --> 00:36:36.900
Which you won't get in other shows,

00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:37.800
 which is great.

00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:40.400
And also it's very cool because if,

00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:42.800
for people who really
know the album,

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:43.967
once the song starts,

00:36:43.967 --> 00:36:45.533
what Tom Kitt has done,

00:36:45.533 --> 00:36:47.567
and the arrangements
that he has added.

00:36:47.567 --> 00:36:49.933
Especially with things
like the strings

00:36:49.933 --> 00:36:52.367
and we have Alon is our cello player.

00:36:52.367 --> 00:36:53.700
You'll see him underneath
the stairs

00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:55.700
if you come and see the show.

00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:56.500
He,

00:36:56.500 --> 00:36:58.233
it's so exciting

00:36:58.233 --> 00:37:01.833
because the songs are so,

00:37:01.833 --> 00:37:04.900
are taken so amazingly
from the album.

00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:06.733
And put into our world.

00:37:06.733 --> 00:37:10.400
So some audience members
are sort of sitting there going

00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:11.600
"Oh, wow,  that's so cool 

00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:13.400
that they did that with this song"

00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:15.800
And we sort of just heard that
with "21 guns"

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:17.700
being very different
from the album version.

00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:20.967
But still such a gorgeous,
beautiful song.

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:26.467
male #2: So, are there disadvantages
of having an audience

00:37:26.467 --> 00:37:28.067
that is expecting certain things?

00:37:28.067 --> 00:37:29.733
Or that knows the show?

00:37:32.133 --> 00:37:34.233
Leslie McDonal: Whatever someone's
expecting that comes to our show,

00:37:34.233 --> 00:37:36.967
they will walk out saying
"I wasn't expecting that."

00:37:36.967 --> 00:37:41.133
I think it shocks even people
that know the album inside and out.

00:37:41.133 --> 00:37:44.200
We do things with the music
that they weren't expecting.

00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:46.267
Jarran Muse: Yeah, and I think
a lot of the audience members

00:37:46.267 --> 00:37:47.633
that I've encountered

00:37:47.633 --> 00:37:49.067
don't know what to expect.

00:37:49.067 --> 00:37:51.900
So they come in with little expectations

00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:54.233
and are completely blown away.

00:37:54.233 --> 00:37:55.033
By what they see.

00:37:55.033 --> 00:37:58.100
There are a lot of fans
of Green Day that

00:37:58.100 --> 00:37:59.333
couldn't wait for the show
to come out

00:37:59.333 --> 00:38:01.000
because they bought the album 

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.100
and they listened to it over and over.

00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:06.200
So when they finally get
to come and see the show,

00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:09.200
they're, I guess,
mesmerized with what they see.

00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:10.867
Because it's pretty awesome.

00:38:10.867 --> 00:38:13.067
[laughter]

00:38:13.900 --> 00:38:15.400
Bradley Horowitz: Cool.
Yes.

00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:16.467
male #3: Yeah, I have to say,

00:38:16.467 --> 00:38:17.600
seeing it the first time,

00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:19.967
I was surprised at the lack
of dialogue.

00:38:19.967 --> 00:38:23.433
And the whole TVs and everything.

00:38:23.433 --> 00:38:24.300
It just,

00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:25.300
 it was a real surprise.

00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:27.633
But I loved it.

00:38:27.633 --> 00:38:28.567
My question is,

00:38:28.567 --> 00:38:31.667
 I know doing a show
eight times a week,

00:38:31.667 --> 00:38:33.600
it requires that much energy,

00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:38.900
is pretty rough even when
you're located at home.

00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:44.267
What's it like to tour and
what makes touring worthwhile?

00:38:44.267 --> 00:38:46.067
male cast member: Well
[laughing]

00:38:46.067 --> 00:38:48.933
Talia Aaron: Yeah, it's amazingly
challenging to try

00:38:48.933 --> 00:38:52.467
and be as good to your body
and your voice and your heart

00:38:52.467 --> 00:38:55.033
and all those things as you need
to be to sustain the show

00:38:55.033 --> 00:38:56.100
like this when you're on the road.

00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:57.900
I think the winter was particularly rough

00:38:57.900 --> 00:39:00.400
'cause we were doing cities
in the East Coast

00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:02.267
and we were doing mostly
one week engagements.

00:39:02.267 --> 00:39:03.067
So we were traveling.

00:39:03.067 --> 00:39:04.533
We were doing eight shows a week
and then traveling

00:39:04.533 --> 00:39:06.567
on our day off on the one day.

00:39:07.567 --> 00:39:11.767
And it's tough to make your mental
and physical and spiritual

00:39:11.767 --> 00:39:12.933
and all those healths a priority.

00:39:12.933 --> 00:39:14.200
But having each other,

00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:15.933
having great people to travel with,

00:39:15.933 --> 00:39:17.733
and...

00:39:17.733 --> 00:39:20.700
I guess, the show also
is kind of its own therapy.

00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:21.400
I find.

00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:23.233
And I think a lot of us find that.

00:39:23.233 --> 00:39:27.667
And so the kind of feelings
and frustrations and challenges

00:39:27.667 --> 00:39:29.100
that you face traveling with it.

00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:32.700
You kinda get a chance to work
them out every night on stage

00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:34.533
in a creative way.

00:39:34.533 --> 00:39:35.967
So.

00:39:35.967 --> 00:39:37.233
Do you guys have a tour bus?

00:39:37.233 --> 00:39:38.833
Or do you fly to the locations?

00:39:38.833 --> 00:39:39.367
Cast: Fly.

00:39:39.367 --> 00:39:39.900
Bradley Horowitz: Fly.

00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:41.367
male cast member: Sometimes
we take a bus.

00:39:41.367 --> 00:39:44.467
Bradley Horowitz: 'Cause you usually set
up in a town for a good while, right?

00:39:44.467 --> 00:39:45.500
Cast: It depends.

00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:47.733
Okieriete Onaodowan: No, actually,

00:39:47.733 --> 00:39:50.400
 on average we're in
each city about a week.

00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:51.600
Two cities we're two weeks.

00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:52.467
Here we're for four weeks.

00:39:52.467 --> 00:39:54.100
And then LA we're at six weeks.

00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:55.533
And honestly it's Sunday,

00:39:55.533 --> 00:39:56.600
we close.

00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:58.000
Monday, we fly.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.067
And then Tuesday we open.

00:40:00.067 --> 00:40:00.833
And that's it.

00:40:00.833 --> 00:40:02.300
We have tech beforehand.

00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:03.433
A quick sound check.

00:40:03.433 --> 00:40:04.033
And then we open,

00:40:04.033 --> 00:40:06.000
so just [snapping] you don't stop.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:07.033
You don't stop.

00:40:07.033 --> 00:40:09.100
Bradley Horowitz: So whoever put
you on the East Coast in the winter

00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:11.767
and out here in the summer
needs a talking to.

00:40:11.767 --> 00:40:12.633
[laughter]

00:40:12.633 --> 00:40:14.600
Jarran Muse: Well, I think that that's
been one of the most challenging things.

00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:16.133
You go from city to city.

00:40:16.133 --> 00:40:17.700
It's climate to climate.

00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:19.133
And you know this is a rock opera.

00:40:19.133 --> 00:40:20.967
We're singing most of the show.

00:40:20.967 --> 00:40:22.367
A lot of allergies.

00:40:22.367 --> 00:40:23.433
A lot of vocal issues.

00:40:23.433 --> 00:40:25.233
Some climates are dryer
than others.

00:40:25.233 --> 00:40:28.900
And it's really hard 
when you have to maintain your voice

00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:30.233
and also maintain your body

00:40:30.233 --> 00:40:31.867
because you have to
continue to go to the gym,

00:40:31.867 --> 00:40:33.967
you have to continue to take care. 
Denver, Colorado.

00:40:33.967 --> 00:40:35.067
Bradley Horowitz: Well,
wait a minute.

00:40:35.067 --> 00:40:37.467
Are you punks or are you divas?

00:40:37.467 --> 00:40:39.333
Jarran Muse: Sorry?

00:40:39.333 --> 00:40:41.900
[laughter] 

00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:43.033
Jake Epstein: Well it's even
you know,

00:40:43.033 --> 00:40:45.500
audience to audience
is completely different.

00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:47.667
Different reactions based on where,

00:40:47.667 --> 00:40:49.200
politically, we are.
[laughter]

00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:50.467
Sort of Red State, Blue State.

00:40:50.467 --> 00:40:54.333
Especially because the show has really
strong political undercurrents.

00:40:54.333 --> 00:40:55.967
So that kinda changes
what the thing is.

00:40:55.967 --> 00:40:56.967
Bradley Horowitz: You feel safe here.

00:40:56.967 --> 00:40:57.867
That's why four weeks.

00:40:57.867 --> 00:40:59.733
Jake Epstein: We love it here.
Yeah.

00:40:59.733 --> 00:41:00.600
Bradley Horowitz: OK.
Alright.

00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:01.333
Cool.

00:41:01.333 --> 00:41:02.567
More questions.

00:41:02.567 --> 00:41:04.833
male #4: Hey. Going back to talking
about the arrangements

00:41:04.833 --> 00:41:06.067
from the question before that.

00:41:06.067 --> 00:41:07.867
The arrangements are awesome
with the strings

00:41:07.867 --> 00:41:08.967
and the harmonies and stuff.

00:41:08.967 --> 00:41:10.967
And I was just wondering 

00:41:10.967 --> 00:41:14.100
if you guys played around with
arrangements for other songs

00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:17.300
that didn't make it into the musical
or even other Green Day albums.

00:41:17.300 --> 00:41:19.967
'Cause I would buy one
or two more albums

00:41:19.967 --> 00:41:23.600
of more arranged Green Day songs.

00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:24.233
Leslie McDonal: Tom Kitt,

00:41:24.233 --> 00:41:27.233
who he was saying won the Pulitzer
for "Next to Normal, "

00:41:27.233 --> 00:41:28.433
he did all the arrangements 

00:41:28.433 --> 00:41:30.933
and Green Day fell in love with
his arrangements so much

00:41:30.933 --> 00:41:32.633
that they asked him to arrange

00:41:32.633 --> 00:41:34.367
the string parts on their next album.

00:41:34.367 --> 00:41:35.333
"21st Century Breakdown" 

00:41:35.333 --> 00:41:38.533
Which is what "Know Your Enemy"
and "21 Guns" in the show is from.

00:41:38.533 --> 00:41:41.967
So they were that obsessed
with his arrangements.

00:41:41.967 --> 00:41:44.800
I know they did write some
stuff that didn't make it in.

00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:47.133
Like people used to riff
in "Homecoming".

00:41:47.133 --> 00:41:48.867
♪ Home, ho-o-o-o-me. ♪

00:41:48.867 --> 00:41:50.100
And they were like "Never mind,

00:41:50.100 --> 00:41:51.267
no thanks"
[laughter]

00:41:51.267 --> 00:41:52.700
But a few things
that didn't make it,

00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:55.300
but you know.

00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:56.267
Most of it did.

00:41:57.367 --> 00:41:58.633
Does that answer your question?

00:41:58.633 --> 00:41:59.733
male #4: Yeah. No.

00:41:59.733 --> 00:42:03.367
So there's no like, release tracks
that you're gonna sneak out or anything.

00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:05.933
Bradley Horowitz: OK.
Cool.

00:42:05.933 --> 00:42:07.100
male #5: Yeah.
Hi.

00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:08.067
Thanks for coming.

00:42:08.067 --> 00:42:10.733
I'm here on behalf of
the at Google team.

00:42:10.733 --> 00:42:12.567
And I have some questions
from the moderator,

00:42:12.567 --> 00:42:15.700
which is folks all over the world
which is asking questions of you.

00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:19.200
The first one is from some idiot.

00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:22.200
That's a term of affection
for you guys, right?

00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:24.300
Greendayfreak88,

00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:25.367
 it doesn't say where they're from.

00:42:25.367 --> 00:42:28.033
It says they've seen the show 11 times

00:42:28.033 --> 00:42:29.667
and it's the best show ever.

00:42:29.667 --> 00:42:33.867
And they wanna know what inspired
some of you to try out for it.

00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:39.467
Joshua Kobak: Yeah, it varies.

00:42:39.467 --> 00:42:42.100
Yeah.
For me it was,

00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:45.500
 when I saw it I was already
actually cast in a different show

00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:47.567
and it was taking them a minute
to get me the contract.

00:42:47.567 --> 00:42:50.867
And I happened to call out
of the show I was in

00:42:50.867 --> 00:42:52.200
and go see it in Berkeley.

00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:56.900
And it was at a time in my life
when I was full of rage and love.

00:42:56.900 --> 00:42:59.967
Like chock full of rage and love.

00:42:59.967 --> 00:43:01.667
And when I saw it I was like

00:43:01.667 --> 00:43:03.667
"Oh, I need to freaking do that.

00:43:03.667 --> 00:43:05.533
Because it's going to help me,

00:43:05.533 --> 00:43:06.767
ultimately."

00:43:06.767 --> 00:43:08.767
And so then I did,

00:43:08.767 --> 00:43:10.667
I auditioned and then did that.

00:43:10.667 --> 00:43:14.633
Matt DeAngelis: Yeah, I mean we don't
always have the luxury of being picky.

00:43:14.633 --> 00:43:17.067
Like, we, our agents tell us
to go to an audition.

00:43:17.067 --> 00:43:21.500
And we go and it just so happens
that some of the time,

00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:22.533
if you're the right,

00:43:22.533 --> 00:43:23.433
if you're right for the job,

00:43:23.433 --> 00:43:25.100
you get a show that
will change your life.

00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:28.833
And it will be artistically and
financially fulfilling for you.

00:43:28.833 --> 00:43:31.067
And I think we've all
found that with this show.

00:43:31.067 --> 00:43:33.467
And there are other shows
out there that are wonderful,

00:43:33.467 --> 00:43:36.133
that are life-changing for the actor
and the audience alike.

00:43:36.133 --> 00:43:37.933
And they're not all like that.

00:43:37.933 --> 00:43:39.833
All theater is wonderful 
and it's great to do it

00:43:39.833 --> 00:43:40.933
and we're all blessed to do it.

00:43:40.933 --> 00:43:43.000
But when you get a show like this

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.167
and you happen to get
the gig it's unbelievable.

00:43:45.167 --> 00:43:47.867
We just kinda show up
where we're told.

00:43:47.867 --> 00:43:50.533
Dan Gleason: And I think
for a lot of us too,

00:43:50.533 --> 00:43:52.400
a lot of us grew up playing guitar,

00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:53.467
and writing music and stuff.

00:43:53.467 --> 00:43:55.833
So this is kind of a unique opportunity

00:43:55.833 --> 00:43:59.633
to let our rock star and theater dream
kinda come to fruition at once.

00:43:59.633 --> 00:44:00.533
You know?

00:44:01.933 --> 00:44:04.233
male #5: Cool, can I get one more in?

00:44:04.233 --> 00:44:04.967
Bradley Horowitz: Let's alternate.

00:44:04.967 --> 00:44:06.767
We'll come back to you.

00:44:06.767 --> 00:44:07.467
Yes.

00:44:07.467 --> 00:44:10.000
female #2: At the risk of sounding
like a total creeper.

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:13.700
I saw you guys last night
and you were awesome.

00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:18.067
But I have a musical theater
geeky question in that,

00:44:18.067 --> 00:44:19.133
I've seen a lot of shows,

00:44:19.133 --> 00:44:20.500
I actually do theater, too.

00:44:20.500 --> 00:44:24.700
And like watching you guys
on the stage just rocking out,

00:44:24.700 --> 00:44:27.833
and belting your faces off 
while you're like head banging

00:44:27.833 --> 00:44:30.300
and doing the crazy
awesome choreography.

00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:32.933
How do you keep your tone--
this is like super nerdy--

00:44:32.933 --> 00:44:35.467
how do you keep
your tone so straight?

00:44:35.467 --> 00:44:37.833
I'm curious if you just like go for it,

00:44:37.833 --> 00:44:40.333
or if you have techniques.

00:44:40.333 --> 00:44:41.100
Jarran Muse: Technique,

00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:41.967
 breath support.

00:44:41.967 --> 00:44:44.233
Our awesome musical conductor,

00:44:44.233 --> 00:44:45.433
Jared Stein,

00:44:45.433 --> 00:44:49.867
keeps us in check with vocal
warm-ups every day.

00:44:49.867 --> 00:44:52.300
Van Hughes: It's also just
practice makes perfect.

00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:52.867
Honestly.

00:44:52.867 --> 00:44:55.167
I don't think anybody that
started this show was like

00:44:55.167 --> 00:44:57.867
"Yeah, I got this" right off the bat.

00:44:57.867 --> 00:45:00.167
I mean, it's just,

00:45:00.167 --> 00:45:02.900
something that no one's
ever had to do before.

00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:04.800
It's just a completely
unique experience.

00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:06.467
So practice makes perfect.

00:45:06.467 --> 00:45:08.067
Matt DeAngelis: Yeah,
your vocal cords are just muscles.

00:45:08.067 --> 00:45:09.433
You know,
we've done this show.

00:45:09.433 --> 00:45:11.433
Last night was show 179,

00:45:11.433 --> 00:45:13.067
I think somebody said,
of this show.

00:45:13.067 --> 00:45:15.533
And so after a while,

00:45:15.533 --> 00:45:17.633
even on your days
when you do feel tired

00:45:17.633 --> 00:45:20.233
and you are head banging and you go
"Oh my gosh, this is so hard today."

00:45:20.233 --> 00:45:22.900
Your muscles still know
how to do it.

00:45:22.900 --> 00:45:23.433
And it's--

00:45:23.433 --> 00:45:25.067
Bradley Horowitz: Actually, your vocal
cords are just muscles,

00:45:25.067 --> 00:45:27.333
but, yeah.
[laughter]

00:45:27.333 --> 00:45:30.533
Gabrielle McClinton: Also breathing
is the most important thing.

00:45:30.533 --> 00:45:31.300
Especially in this show,

00:45:31.300 --> 00:45:34.500
your energy gets up here so much
'cause you're so intense

00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:36.033
that you forget to breathe sometimes.

00:45:36.033 --> 00:45:38.600
So as long as you
keep that breath going,

00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:41.333
I think that is the key
to doing this show.

00:45:41.333 --> 00:45:42.667
Dan Gleason: And confidence.

00:45:42.667 --> 00:45:45.200
Like when we first started rehearsals.

00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:46.633
There's a little voice in your head,
it's like

00:45:46.633 --> 00:45:48.967
"Oh my God am I gonna crack on this
note while I'm pounding my head?"

00:45:48.967 --> 00:45:49.933
And eventually that goes away.

00:45:49.933 --> 00:45:54.167
So, yeah, you just kinda
go for it and it happens.

00:45:54.167 --> 00:45:56.900
Bradley Horowitz: And how much of the
singing that we hear in the audience

00:45:56.900 --> 00:45:58.833
is actually lip syncing?

00:45:58.833 --> 00:45:59.867
I'm just kidding,

00:45:59.867 --> 00:46:02.467
I'm just kidding.

00:46:02.467 --> 00:46:04.233
[laughter] 
[cast murmurs and chatters]

00:46:04.233 --> 00:46:06.167
Matt DeAngelis: We've been
lip syncing all day.

00:46:06.167 --> 00:46:06.867
For a year.

00:46:06.867 --> 00:46:09.667
Male #5: I'll follow that up
with an actual fun question.

00:46:09.667 --> 00:46:11.567
So this is from Arella in Seattle.

00:46:11.567 --> 00:46:12.400
Who wants to know,

00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:15.067
do you have any backstage
rituals before the show.

00:46:15.067 --> 00:46:17.800
Cast: Yeah.
Yes.

00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:18.200
Matt DeAngelis: Wanna do it?

00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:18.800
Gabrielle McClinton: Oh yeah.

00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:21.567
Matt DeAngelis: Should we do that?

00:46:21.567 --> 00:46:22.333
Can we expletive?

00:46:22.333 --> 00:46:22.967
Bradley Horowitz: Bring it.
Go ahead.

00:46:22.967 --> 00:46:25.867
Jarran Muse: So, every day
before the show,

00:46:25.867 --> 00:46:27.800
like right before the curtain goes up,

00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:30.733
we all get in a huddle
around Johnny's bed.

00:46:30.733 --> 00:46:32.567
And somebody shouts out

00:46:32.567 --> 00:46:33.767
"One, two, three four

00:46:33.767 --> 00:46:36.133
Cast: "Shit, motherfucker,
motherfucker, God damn!"

00:46:36.133 --> 00:46:42.933
[laughter] [applause]

00:46:42.933 --> 00:46:44.533
Matt DeAngelis: And also,

00:46:46.933 --> 00:46:48.133
I'm a handshake geek.

00:46:48.133 --> 00:46:49.667
In every show that I do I try to get,

00:46:49.667 --> 00:46:50.500
we have a,

00:46:50.500 --> 00:46:51.467
I think there's like 11

00:46:51.467 --> 00:46:54.833
that have occurred naturally during
Jesus of Suburbia backstage.

00:46:54.833 --> 00:46:57.200
We all have a big handshake ritual.

00:46:57.200 --> 00:46:59.833
Krystina Alabado: Sometimes before
us girls run on in "American Idiot"

00:46:59.833 --> 00:47:01.300
we mosh pit backstage.

00:47:01.300 --> 00:47:03.100
And we run and ram into each other

00:47:03.100 --> 00:47:04.133
until we have to run on stage.

00:47:04.133 --> 00:47:06.433
Matt DeAngelis: And the ladies recently
have taken to when the curtain is down

00:47:06.433 --> 00:47:08.333
they've been running
some track laps recently.

00:47:08.333 --> 00:47:10.633
That's a new thing
that's been happening.

00:47:12.967 --> 00:47:13.933
Bradley Horowitz: That's really cool,

00:47:13.933 --> 00:47:16.300
we start our Google+ meetings
with the same chant.

00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:21.833
[laughter] [applause]

00:47:21.833 --> 00:47:23.100
Van Hughes: It works. 
You should.

00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:23.600
Bradley Horowitz: OK.

00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:25.433
female #3: I thought it was
supposed to be confidential.

00:47:25.433 --> 00:47:28.567
[laughter]

00:47:28.567 --> 00:47:30.467
I have a TV related question. 

00:47:30.467 --> 00:47:35.300
So how do you guys feel about all
of the movies and the TV shows

00:47:35.300 --> 00:47:37.100
that are being made about theater.

00:47:37.100 --> 00:47:38.933
And life in theater.

00:47:38.933 --> 00:47:40.533
Things that happen
behind the scenes.

00:47:40.533 --> 00:47:42.633
Maybe, specifically Smash, or --

00:47:42.633 --> 00:47:44.300
male cast member: Are
you talking about Glee?

00:47:44.300 --> 00:47:45.500
female #3: No.

00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:47.633
Actually I recently started
watching Smash.

00:47:47.633 --> 00:47:48.767
So that's where the --
[laughs]

00:47:48.767 --> 00:47:51.300
Kelvin Moon Loh: Well, Michael Mayer,
the director of our show,

00:47:51.300 --> 00:47:53.133
also directed a couple
episodes of Smash.

00:47:53.133 --> 00:47:54.700
Right at the get-go.

00:47:54.700 --> 00:47:58.567
I think it's incredible
that as the years go on,

00:47:58.567 --> 00:47:59.700
starting with Chicago

00:47:59.700 --> 00:48:02.967
and all these new movie musicals
and these television shows.

00:48:02.967 --> 00:48:07.100
It brings such a new audience
back to the New York theater

00:48:07.100 --> 00:48:08.467
as far as I'm concerned.

00:48:08.467 --> 00:48:11.333
There's a really vibrant young audience

00:48:11.333 --> 00:48:15.500
that is now interested into
the Broadway musical again.

00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:16.600
I feel like,

00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:18.233
I believe these last two years,

00:48:18.233 --> 00:48:23.267
it's been record breaking box office
years for Broadway seasons.

00:48:23.267 --> 00:48:28.033
Which has not always been
the case with the economy.

00:48:28.033 --> 00:48:31.033
So just to have this new
energy and this new interest,

00:48:31.033 --> 00:48:33.600
resurgence of energy back
towards the Broadway stage

00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:34.167
is very important.

00:48:34.167 --> 00:48:35.833
And I think that's all being generated

00:48:35.833 --> 00:48:40.400
by these movie musicals and
these television shows for sure.

00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:41.067
cast together: Here, here!

00:48:41.067 --> 00:48:44.567
female #3: Would you say these shows
are true to what actually happens?

00:48:44.567 --> 00:48:46.467
And the process you go through.

00:48:46.467 --> 00:48:48.367
Kelvin Moon Lee: No.
Comment. [laughter]

00:48:48.367 --> 00:48:49.700
Gabriel Antonacci: I think we have,

00:48:49.700 --> 00:48:52.300
I think a lot of us have a love-hate
relationship sometimes

00:48:52.300 --> 00:48:53.433
with things like that.

00:48:53.433 --> 00:48:59.767
But especially now the Les Mis movie
is doing live singing for their,

00:48:59.767 --> 00:49:02.700
which is amazing
and that's so great.

00:49:02.700 --> 00:49:04.367
And it sounds real.

00:49:04.367 --> 00:49:07.500
Or at least hopefully it
will when it does come out.

00:49:07.500 --> 00:49:10.600
But of course,
you watch Smash,

00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:12.500
and everybody has beautiful apartments

00:49:12.500 --> 00:49:14.867
and it's like, massive.

00:49:14.867 --> 00:49:17.200
And they live by
themselves in New York.

00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:18.600
In Midtown.

00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:22.367
Where everybody here is like
"well, maybe not so much."

00:49:24.233 --> 00:49:25.133
It is what it is.

00:49:25.133 --> 00:49:30.233
But I think that anything that gets
more eyes on our business for us

00:49:30.233 --> 00:49:31.767
is amazing.

00:49:31.767 --> 00:49:33.933
female #3: What about
the competitions?

00:49:33.933 --> 00:49:36.200
Gabriel Antonacci: Oh, like competitions
like American Idol

00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:37.800
and stuff like that?

00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:39.600
You know, I think that,

00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:40.633
well, Tony Vincent,

00:49:40.633 --> 00:49:46.100
our original Saint Jimmy on Broadway
was recently on The Voice.

00:49:46.100 --> 00:49:49.033
I think it's different
for each person I guess.

00:49:49.033 --> 00:49:51.300
They probably have again,

00:49:51.300 --> 00:49:54.367
anything that makes singing,

00:49:54.367 --> 00:49:59.200
makes people realize just how tough
a lot of this stuff is, I guess.

00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:00.467
But I don't know,

00:50:00.467 --> 00:50:03.233
is there anybody else who wants to
add something about the competition.

00:50:03.233 --> 00:50:04.333
Okieriete Onaodowan: I mean,
it definitely does influence.

00:50:04.333 --> 00:50:05.167
I don't know about me,

00:50:05.167 --> 00:50:08.700
but just seeing especially with
American Idol and Sing Off

00:50:08.700 --> 00:50:09.867
and all those shows,

00:50:09.867 --> 00:50:13.400
they do greatly influence even
the style that music is written now

00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:14.467
in musical theater.

00:50:14.467 --> 00:50:17.067
With a lot of those shows now how,

00:50:17.067 --> 00:50:18.933
 the lead's vocal
parts and what they sing,

00:50:18.933 --> 00:50:20.667
there's a lot more riffing
and all of that.

00:50:20.667 --> 00:50:22.400
It's changed musical theater.

00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:23.300
And that's good and bad.

00:50:23.300 --> 00:50:23.967
People who, let's say,

00:50:23.967 --> 00:50:27.167
do not have a standard legit
classic musical theater voice.

00:50:27.167 --> 00:50:28.567
Have a notch.

00:50:28.567 --> 00:50:29.600
Have a place.

00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:31.467
And maybe people who do,

00:50:31.467 --> 00:50:34.167
 there's not as many parts
that are written for them.

00:50:34.167 --> 00:50:36.633
It's as with anything,

00:50:36.633 --> 00:50:37.400
it's a double edge.

00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:39.067
There's lots of good
and like Kelvin said,

00:50:39.067 --> 00:50:41.700
it's brought a lot of great attention
back towards Broadway

00:50:41.700 --> 00:50:43.800
and they're back with everything.

00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:46.833
Van Hughes: But I think as
far as competition goes for like.

00:50:46.833 --> 00:50:49.367
I think, what you meant
is like on Smash, like,

00:50:49.367 --> 00:50:52.533
Ivy and whatever
her other name is.

00:50:52.533 --> 00:50:55.267
Yeah, I don't think anybody's
like stalking each other

00:50:55.267 --> 00:50:58.667
to see who's gonna get the part.

00:50:58.667 --> 00:51:01.633
I mean, I always think that
I'm gonna go out there,

00:51:01.633 --> 00:51:02.900
do my audition.

00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:04.067
If they want me,
they want me.

00:51:04.067 --> 00:51:04.967
If they don't,
they don't.

00:51:04.967 --> 00:51:06.767
I'm gonna get another job
down the line,

00:51:06.767 --> 00:51:07.600
you know what I mean.

00:51:07.600 --> 00:51:10.067
I think a lot of people
who are professionals,

00:51:10.067 --> 00:51:11.367
that's just the way it works.

00:51:11.367 --> 00:51:13.800
So you never know what
somebody can see in you

00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:16.800
that you're not even sure that
you're putting out or not.

00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:18.733
So as opposed to like,

00:51:18.733 --> 00:51:20.500
going head to head in
the bathroom about

00:51:20.500 --> 00:51:23.333
"Are you gonna get this part?"

00:51:23.333 --> 00:51:24.367
I don't think it's really like that.

00:51:24.367 --> 00:51:26.367
I've never known it to
be like that personally.

00:51:26.367 --> 00:51:29.833
But it makes good drama on TV.

00:51:29.833 --> 00:51:30.900
Bradley Horowitz: Alright.

00:51:30.900 --> 00:51:32.100
Thank you guys for your questions.

00:51:32.100 --> 00:51:34.700
We're gonna invite the cast
up for one more song.

00:51:34.700 --> 00:51:36.000
"Good Riddance."

00:51:37.133 --> 00:51:44.933
[applause] 

00:51:49.100 --> 00:51:50.867
Van Hughes: Thank you Google.
