00:00:13.489 --> 00:00:17.729
Aja Monet: Our story begins
like all great, young love stories.

00:00:17.753 --> 00:00:19.603
Phillip Agnew: She slid in my DMs ...

00:00:19.627 --> 00:00:21.514
AM: He liked about 50 of my photos,

00:00:21.538 --> 00:00:23.663
back-to-back,
in the middle of the night --

00:00:23.687 --> 00:00:28.172
PA: What I saw was an artist
committed to truth and justice --

00:00:28.196 --> 00:00:30.784
and she's beautiful, but I digress.

00:00:30.808 --> 00:00:33.584
AM: Our story actually begins
across many worlds,

00:00:33.608 --> 00:00:36.982
over maqluba and red wine in Palestine.

00:00:37.006 --> 00:00:39.253
But how did we get there?

00:00:39.887 --> 00:00:41.642
PA: Well, I was born in Chicago,

00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:43.719
the son of a preacher and a teacher.

00:00:43.743 --> 00:00:47.874
My ears first rung with church songs
sung by my mother on Saturday mornings.

00:00:48.253 --> 00:00:50.708
My father's South Side
sermons summoned me.

00:00:50.732 --> 00:00:54.020
My first words
were more notes than quotes.

00:00:54.044 --> 00:00:56.064
It was music that molded me.

00:00:56.088 --> 00:01:00.240
Later on, it was Florida A&amp;M University
that first introduced me to organizing.

00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:04.113
In 2012, a young black male
named Trayvon Martin was murdered,

00:01:04.137 --> 00:01:06.618
and it changed my life
and millions of others'.

00:01:06.642 --> 00:01:10.140
We were a ragtag group
of college kids and not-quite adults

00:01:10.164 --> 00:01:12.452
who had decided enough was enough.

00:01:12.476 --> 00:01:16.276
Art and organizing became our answer
to anger and anxiety.

00:01:16.623 --> 00:01:19.156
We built a movement
and it traveled around the world

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.307
and to Palestine, in 2015.

00:01:21.331 --> 00:01:23.837
AM: I was born to a single mother

00:01:23.861 --> 00:01:26.675
in the Pink House projects
of Brooklyn, New York.

00:01:26.699 --> 00:01:28.163
Maddened by survival,

00:01:28.187 --> 00:01:32.969
I gravitated inwards towards books, poems
and my brother's hand-me-down Walkman.

00:01:32.993 --> 00:01:35.455
I saw train-station theater,

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:38.397
subwoofing streets and hood murals.

00:01:38.421 --> 00:01:41.907
In high school, I found a community
of metaphor magicians

00:01:41.931 --> 00:01:43.727
and truth-telling poets

00:01:43.751 --> 00:01:46.653
in an organization called Urban Word NYC.

00:01:46.677 --> 00:01:48.981
Adopted by the Black Arts movement,

00:01:49.005 --> 00:01:52.726
I won the legendary
Nuyorican Poets Cafe Grand Slam title.

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.203
(Applause and cheers)

00:01:54.227 --> 00:01:56.593
At Sarah Lawrence College,
I worked with artists

00:01:56.617 --> 00:02:00.204
to respond to Hurricane Katrina
and the earthquake;

00:02:00.228 --> 00:02:02.927
I discovered the impact of poetry

00:02:02.951 --> 00:02:05.848
and the ability to not just
articulate our feelings,

00:02:05.872 --> 00:02:09.413
but to get us to work
towards changing things

00:02:09.437 --> 00:02:11.516
and doing something about it,

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.606
when a friend, Maytha Alhassen,
invited me to Palestine ...

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.058
PA: We were a delegation
of artists and organizers,

00:02:17.082 --> 00:02:19.511
and we immersed ourselves
in Palestinian culture,

00:02:19.535 --> 00:02:21.495
music, their stories.

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:22.672
Late into the night,

00:02:22.696 --> 00:02:26.095
we would have discussions
about the role of art in politics

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:28.093
and the role of politics in art.

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.055
Aja and I disagree.

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:31.801
AM: Oh, we disagree.

00:02:31.825 --> 00:02:35.364
PA: But we quite quickly
and unsurprisingly fell in love.

00:02:35.388 --> 00:02:36.539
Exhibit A:

00:02:36.563 --> 00:02:38.053
me working my magic.

00:02:38.077 --> 00:02:40.537
(Laughter)

00:02:40.561 --> 00:02:42.231
AM: Obvious, isn't it?

00:02:42.608 --> 00:02:45.786
Four months later, this artist --

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.786
PA: and this organizer --

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:53.834
AM: moved into a little home
with a big backyard, in Miami.

00:02:54.636 --> 00:02:55.981
PA: (Sighs)

00:02:56.005 --> 00:02:58.650
Listen, five months
before this ever happened,

00:02:58.674 --> 00:02:59.909
I predicted it all.

00:02:59.933 --> 00:03:01.084
I'm going to tell you --

00:03:01.108 --> 00:03:02.581
a friend sat me down and said,

00:03:02.605 --> 00:03:04.332
"You've done so much for organizing,

00:03:04.356 --> 00:03:06.071
when are you going to settle down?"

00:03:06.095 --> 00:03:07.705
I looked him straight in the face

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:10.187
and I said, "The only way
that it would ever happen

00:03:10.211 --> 00:03:11.385
is if it is a collision.

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:14.666
This woman would have to knock me
completely off course."

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.515
I didn't know how right I was.

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:17.540
(Laughter)

00:03:17.564 --> 00:03:20.529
Our first few months
were like any between young lovers:

00:03:20.553 --> 00:03:24.624
filled with hot, passionate, all-night ...

00:03:24.648 --> 00:03:26.616
AM: nonstop ...

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:27.791
PA: discussions.

00:03:27.815 --> 00:03:28.816
(Laughter)

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.217
PA: Aja challenged everything
I knew and understood about the world.

00:03:32.241 --> 00:03:33.635
She forced me --

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:34.901
AM: lovingly --

00:03:34.925 --> 00:03:37.054
PA: to see our organizing
work with new eyes.

00:03:37.078 --> 00:03:38.801
She helped me see the unseen things

00:03:38.825 --> 00:03:41.079
and how artists illuminate
our interior worlds.

00:03:41.103 --> 00:03:44.334
AM: There were many days
I did not want to get up out of bed

00:03:44.358 --> 00:03:46.414
and face the exterior world.

00:03:46.784 --> 00:03:48.167
I was discouraged.

00:03:48.191 --> 00:03:51.101
There was so much loss and death

00:03:51.125 --> 00:03:55.202
and artists were being used
to numb, lull and exploit.

00:03:55.555 --> 00:04:01.085
While winning awards, accolades
and grants soothed so many egos,

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:03.342
people were still dying

00:04:03.366 --> 00:04:05.241
and I was seeking community.

00:04:05.568 --> 00:04:11.864
Meeting Phillip brought so much joy,
love, truth into my life,

00:04:11.888 --> 00:04:14.569
and it pulled me out of isolation.

00:04:14.593 --> 00:04:17.435
He showed me that community
and relationships

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.185
wasn't just about building
great movements.

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.919
It was integral in creating
powerful, meaningful art,

00:04:23.943 --> 00:04:26.210
and neither could be done in solitude.

00:04:26.748 --> 00:04:30.891
PA: Yeah, we realized many of our artist
and organizer friends were also lost

00:04:30.915 --> 00:04:32.967
in these cycles of sadness,

00:04:32.991 --> 00:04:36.835
and we were in movements
that often found themselves at funerals.

00:04:36.859 --> 00:04:38.009
We asked ourselves

00:04:38.033 --> 00:04:40.425
what becomes of a generation
all too familiar

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:44.329
with the untimely ends of lives
streamed daily on our Timelines?

00:04:44.353 --> 00:04:46.865
It was during one
of our late-night discussions

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:49.668
that we saw beyond art and organizing

00:04:49.692 --> 00:04:52.437
and began to see that art was organizing.

00:04:52.461 --> 00:04:53.968
AM: The idea was set:

00:04:53.992 --> 00:04:58.139
art was an anchor,
not an accessory to movement.

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.126
Our home was a home
of radical imagination;

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.381
an instrument of our nurturing hearts;

00:05:03.405 --> 00:05:08.704
a place of risk where were dared
to laugh, love, cry, debate.

00:05:08.728 --> 00:05:14.232
Art, books, records and all this stuff
decorated our walls,

00:05:14.256 --> 00:05:16.656
and there was lizards --

00:05:17.371 --> 00:05:22.178
walls of palm trees that guided
our guests into our backyard,

00:05:22.202 --> 00:05:25.822
where our neighbors would come
and feel right at home.

00:05:25.846 --> 00:05:26.997
The wind --

00:05:27.021 --> 00:05:31.199
the wind was an affirmation
for the people who walked into the space.

00:05:31.223 --> 00:05:33.369
And we learned that in a world --

00:05:33.393 --> 00:05:36.125
a bewildering world
of so much distraction --

00:05:36.149 --> 00:05:40.894
we were able to cultivate a space
where people could come and be present,

00:05:40.918 --> 00:05:44.484
and artists and organizers
could find refuge.

00:05:44.508 --> 00:05:46.870
PA: This became Smoke Signals Studio.

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:52.246
AM: As we struggle to clothe, house,
feed and educate our communities;

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:56.430
our spirits hunger for connection,
joy and purpose;

00:05:56.454 --> 00:05:59.186
and as our bodies
are out on the front lines,

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:02.019
our souls still need to be fed,

00:06:02.043 --> 00:06:05.372
or else we succumb
to despair and depression.

00:06:05.396 --> 00:06:09.813
Our art possesses rhythmic communication,

00:06:09.837 --> 00:06:11.357
coded emotional cues,

00:06:11.381 --> 00:06:14.662
improvised feelings of critical thought.

00:06:14.686 --> 00:06:18.084
Our social movements should be like jazz:

00:06:18.108 --> 00:06:20.914
encouraging active participation,

00:06:20.938 --> 00:06:22.181
listening,

00:06:22.205 --> 00:06:23.701
spontaneity and freedom.

00:06:23.725 --> 00:06:26.106
What people see as a party ...

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:28.625
PA: is actually a movement meeting.

00:06:28.649 --> 00:06:30.968
See, we aren't all protest and pain.

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:32.997
Here's a place to be loved,

00:06:33.021 --> 00:06:34.935
to be felt, to be heard,

00:06:34.959 --> 00:06:38.320
and where we prepare
for the most pressing political issues

00:06:38.344 --> 00:06:39.768
in our neighborhoods.

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:42.931
See, laws never change culture,

00:06:42.955 --> 00:06:46.107
but culture always changes laws.

00:06:47.041 --> 00:06:48.208
Art --

00:06:48.232 --> 00:06:50.447
(Applause)

00:06:50.471 --> 00:06:53.288
Art as organizing is even changing
and opening doors

00:06:53.312 --> 00:06:55.554
in places seen as the opposite of freedom.

00:06:55.578 --> 00:06:57.209
Our weekly poetry series

00:06:57.233 --> 00:07:00.567
is transforming the lives of men
incarcerated at Dade Correctional,

00:07:00.591 --> 00:07:04.211
and we're so excited to bring you all
the published work of one of those men,

00:07:04.235 --> 00:07:05.416
Echo Martinez.

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.377
In the intro, he says ...

00:07:07.401 --> 00:07:10.503
AM: "Poetry for the people
is a sick pen's penicillin.

00:07:10.812 --> 00:07:13.583
It's a cuff key to a prisoner's dreams.

00:07:13.607 --> 00:07:15.428
The Molotov in the ink.

00:07:15.452 --> 00:07:17.335
It is knowledge, it is overstanding,

00:07:17.359 --> 00:07:20.270
it is tasting ingredients
in everything you've been force-fed,

00:07:20.294 --> 00:07:23.158
but most of all, it's a reminder
that we all have voices,

00:07:23.182 --> 00:07:26.442
we all can be heard
even if we have to scream."

00:07:26.466 --> 00:07:31.993
In 2018, we created our first annual
Maroon Poetry Festival

00:07:32.017 --> 00:07:34.778
at the TACOLCY Center in Liberty City.

00:07:34.802 --> 00:07:39.228
There, the Last Poets,
Sonia Sanchez, Emory Douglas

00:07:39.252 --> 00:07:41.616
and the late, great Ntozake Shange,

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:46.345
performed and met
with local artists and organizers.

00:07:46.369 --> 00:07:48.197
We were able to honor them

00:07:48.221 --> 00:07:51.189
for their commitment
to radical truth-telling.

00:07:51.213 --> 00:07:52.839
And in addition to that,

00:07:52.863 --> 00:07:55.266
we transformed a public park

00:07:55.290 --> 00:08:00.358
into the physical manifestation
of the world we are organizing for.

00:08:00.382 --> 00:08:02.223
Everything that we put into poetry,

00:08:02.247 --> 00:08:05.104
we put into the art, into the creativity,

00:08:05.128 --> 00:08:07.284
into the curated kids' games

00:08:07.308 --> 00:08:09.040
and into the stunning stage design.

00:08:09.739 --> 00:08:12.393
PA: Our work is in a long line
of cultural organizers

00:08:12.417 --> 00:08:16.511
that understood to use art
to animate a radical future.

00:08:16.535 --> 00:08:18.325
Artists like June Jordan,

00:08:18.349 --> 00:08:19.993
Emory Douglas

00:08:20.017 --> 00:08:21.292
and Nina Simone.

00:08:21.316 --> 00:08:24.553
They understood what many of us
are just now realizing --

00:08:24.577 --> 00:08:26.393
that to get people to build the ship,

00:08:26.417 --> 00:08:28.459
you've got to get
them to long for the sea;

00:08:28.483 --> 00:08:32.721
that data rarely moves people,
but great art always does.

00:08:32.745 --> 00:08:33.965
This understanding --

00:08:33.989 --> 00:08:36.445
(Applause)

00:08:36.469 --> 00:08:38.386
This understanding informed the thinking

00:08:38.410 --> 00:08:40.576
behind the Dream Defenders'
"Freedom Papers,"

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:43.789
a radical political vision
for the future of Florida

00:08:43.813 --> 00:08:46.169
that talked about people over profits.

00:08:46.193 --> 00:08:48.628
Now, we could have done a policy paper.

00:08:48.652 --> 00:08:52.351
Instead, artists and organizers
came together in their poetry

00:08:52.375 --> 00:08:54.271
to create incredible murals

00:08:54.295 --> 00:08:56.739
and did the video that we see behind us.

00:08:56.763 --> 00:09:00.475
We joined the political precision
of the Black Panther Party

00:09:00.499 --> 00:09:04.052
and the beautiful poetry
of Puerto Rican poet Martín Espada

00:09:04.076 --> 00:09:06.779
to bring our political vision to life.

00:09:07.457 --> 00:09:13.480
AM: Now thousands of Floridians
across age, race, gender and class

00:09:13.504 --> 00:09:17.768
see the "Freedom Papers"
as a vision for the future of their lives.

00:09:17.792 --> 00:09:23.349
For decades, our artists and our art
has been used to exploit,

00:09:23.373 --> 00:09:24.850
lull, numb,

00:09:24.874 --> 00:09:26.510
sell things to us

00:09:26.534 --> 00:09:28.851
and to displace our communities,

00:09:28.875 --> 00:09:33.496
but we believe
that the personal is political

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:37.180
and the heart is measured by what is done,

00:09:37.204 --> 00:09:38.965
not what one feels.

00:09:38.989 --> 00:09:43.836
And so art as organizing is not
just concerned with artists' intentions,

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:45.866
but their actual impact.

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:48.122
Great art is not a monologue.

00:09:48.146 --> 00:09:51.935
Great art is a dialogue
between the artist and the people.

00:09:53.454 --> 00:09:56.229
PA: Four years ago, this artist ...

00:09:56.253 --> 00:09:58.486
AM: and this organizer ...

00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:00.995
PA: found that we were not just a match.

00:10:01.019 --> 00:10:02.414
AM: We were a mirror.

00:10:02.438 --> 00:10:05.351
PA: Our worlds truly did collide,

00:10:05.375 --> 00:10:06.604
and in many ways ...

00:10:06.628 --> 00:10:07.919
AM: they combined.

00:10:08.367 --> 00:10:10.232
PA: We learned so much about movement,

00:10:10.256 --> 00:10:13.773
about love and about art
at its most impactful:

00:10:13.797 --> 00:10:18.083
when it articulates the impossible
and when it erodes individualism,

00:10:18.107 --> 00:10:22.737
when it plays into the gray places
of our black and white worlds,

00:10:22.761 --> 00:10:25.379
when it does what our democracy does not,

00:10:25.403 --> 00:10:27.997
when it reminds us
that we are not islands,

00:10:28.021 --> 00:10:31.799
when it adorns every street
but Wall Street and Madison Avenue,

00:10:31.823 --> 00:10:34.309
when it reminds us that we are not islands

00:10:34.333 --> 00:10:36.840
and refuses to succumb to the numbness,

00:10:36.864 --> 00:10:38.657
when it indicts empire

00:10:38.681 --> 00:10:41.514
and inspires each
and every one of us to love,

00:10:41.538 --> 00:10:42.689
tell the truth

00:10:42.713 --> 00:10:45.358
and make revolution irresistible.

00:10:46.157 --> 00:10:47.308
AM: For the wizards --

00:10:47.332 --> 00:10:51.053
(Applause)

00:10:51.639 --> 00:10:55.210
AM: For the wizards
and ways of our defiance,

00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:01.013
love-riot visions of our rising,
risen, raised selves.

00:11:01.329 --> 00:11:03.107
The overcoming grace --

00:11:03.131 --> 00:11:04.955
fires, bitter tongues,

00:11:04.979 --> 00:11:07.718
wise as rickety rocking chairs,

00:11:07.742 --> 00:11:10.463
suffering salt and sand skies.

00:11:10.487 --> 00:11:14.107
Memories unshackled and shining stitches

00:11:14.131 --> 00:11:16.104
on a stretch-marked heart.

00:11:16.405 --> 00:11:19.918
For the flowers that bloom
in midnight scars.

00:11:20.273 --> 00:11:23.559
How we suffered and sought a North Star.

00:11:23.583 --> 00:11:26.268
When there was no light, we glowed.

00:11:26.292 --> 00:11:28.913
We sparked this rejoice,

00:11:28.937 --> 00:11:30.877
this righteous delight.

00:11:30.901 --> 00:11:33.642
We have a cause to take joy in.

00:11:33.666 --> 00:11:35.917
How we weathered and persisted,

00:11:35.941 --> 00:11:37.091
tenacious,

00:11:37.115 --> 00:11:39.139
no stone unturned.

00:11:39.163 --> 00:11:42.794
How we witnessed the horror of mankind

00:11:42.818 --> 00:11:46.544
and did not become
that which horrified us.

00:11:47.437 --> 00:11:48.588
PA: Thank you.

00:11:48.612 --> 00:11:49.763
AM: Thank you.

00:11:49.787 --> 00:11:53.187
(Applause)
