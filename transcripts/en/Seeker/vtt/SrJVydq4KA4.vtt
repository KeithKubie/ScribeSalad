00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:03.990
I have fond memories of feeding ducks with
my parents at Michigan State… watching their

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.300
adorable beaks gobble up that stale, non-nutritious,
moldy white bread.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.230
Sigh. Memories.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.520
Hey pigeon people, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.260
Feeding wild animals has been seen as a “humanitarian
movement” for decades.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.880
In the late 19th century, Britain’s Dicky
Bird Society (which is real) required members

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:31.000
to pledge to be kind to all living things,
which even influenced kids to save crumbs

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.399
from meals so they could feed birds.

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:38.290
In WWI, it was recognized as our patriotic
duty to feed birds so they could survive to

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.170
eat insects that threaten America's crops
-- and therefore the war effort.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.829
But is feeding wildlife beneficial to them?

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:48.080
Or you know, are we being oblivious and selfish
humans once again?

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.550
TBH it depends on what you’re feeding them.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.020
Feeding white bread to ducks is probably not
a good idea.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.690
It’s kind of like watching a 1-year-old
smash their birthday cake and gobble it up

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.790
-- it might be fun to watch, but it really
isn’t good for them.

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.710
White bread lacks nutritional value it’s
just full of calories (yes, Scott.

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:04.769
Bread makes you fat).

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.979
What you end up with are bloated ducks who
are too full to eat the natural and nutritious

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:10.510
food they’re supposed to be eating.

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.500
But fat ducks are far from the worst of it.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.990
An unhealthy diet can lead birds to contract
“angel wing” -- a deformity where their

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:21.240
wings are unnaturally twisted out instead
of held against their body3.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.940
Birds with angel wing can’t fly, and if
they can’t fly, they can’t escape predators

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.070
or avoid hazards, like cars.

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.530
White bread also affects their habitat when
uneaten.

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.549
These soggy carbs attract algae growth which
can spread diseases and attract pests like

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:35.549
rats.

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.970
And this foul play isn’t just found with
foul.

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.750
We need to stop feeding monkeys too.

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.729
A recent study in the Applied and Environmental
Microbiology looked at our relationship with

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.820
green monkeys (that’s a species, it’s
not actually green, though how cool would

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:48.900
that be?).

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.920
Humans not only gave monkeys peanuts, but
in doing so, they also passed diseases.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.920
Specifically, a bacterial infection called
Staphylococcus aureus, that's science speak

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.340
for staph infection.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.310
Remember how we learned we can contract diseases
from animals?

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:04.790
Turns out it’s a two way street.

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.559
Samples of the bacteria were taken then tested
from the noses of monkeys and humans.

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:13.879
Through a technique called “high-throughput
sequencing,” results showed S. aureus was

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:16.969
indeed transmitted through human-to-monkey
contact.

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:21.019
Though staph infection is relatively minor
-- generally causing skin infections and boils

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:25.760
-- it can become serious for monkeys if it
enters their bloodstream where it can cause

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.499
toxic shock syndrome.

00:02:27.499 --> 00:02:31.469
It should be known that not all wildlife feeding
is necessarily bad.

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:35.750
One recent study published in the Oxford Journals
observed 6 sites in Chicago throughout the

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.269
course of about 3 years -- both with and without
bird feeders.

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:43.680
They compared the bird’s stress levels,
body condition, reproductive physiology, immunity,

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.079
and feather quality.

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:50.209
It turns out bird feeding “significantly
influenced the health of the birds.”

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:52.269
But not all "influences" are positive.

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:55.949
Disease was more prevalent with bird feeders,
but a majority of the birds seemed better

00:02:55.949 --> 00:03:00.930
equipped to handle it based on their low stress
levels and greater antioxidant capacity.

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.760
Of course, this is only one study in one specific
part of the world.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.529
When it comes to feeding wildlife because
you think they might be hungry.

00:03:07.529 --> 00:03:08.889
Just don't.

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:12.879
Wildlife has survived without humans since,
well, the millions of years before humans.

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:16.129
We typically aren’t doing them any favors
by giving them food.

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:19.480
But if you want to continue your duck feeding
tradition, consider their diet.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.950
Try feeding ducks defrosted peas, cut grapes,
or even uncooked rice instead.

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.260
Now that you can keep your bird feeder do
you want to show the whole world-wide-web

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.169
all the cool birds you’ve been seeing in
your backyard?

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:31.459
Well, now you can with your own website!

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:36.010

story like a DOT COM or DOT NET domain name.

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.449
And because you watch DNews, you can get 15%

by using the code DNews when you check out.

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:45.549
What about feeding your own pets people food?

00:03:45.549 --> 00:04:01.369
I talk about it about it in this video here.

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:09.590
Are there any other animal questions you’re
curious about?
