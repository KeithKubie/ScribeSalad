00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.960
The best part about
today I would say

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.190
is how smoothly everything
went with the sixth graders.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.540
I was stressed about it.

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:19.660
They actually had pretty
constructive feedback,

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.230
so I'm happy about
how that went.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.150
The worst part about today,
I feel like people feel lost.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.270
They kind of had a deer in the
headlights look on their faces

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:33.600
sometimes, because
we're really talking

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.490
at a more abstract
conceptual level,

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.470
and they haven't had a chance
to put stuff into practice yet.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.060
And I know that'll
change tonight,

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.440
and I know that the workshops
and stuff will help tomorrow

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.060
and the rest of this
week, but at some point,

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.170
I just felt like
I was saying words

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.110
that weren't super useful to
them, and I couldn't stop.

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.170
I should've just shut
up, but I didn't.

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.735
Reconfiguring our furniture
arrangement in this U shape

00:01:01.735 --> 00:01:03.610
definitely made the
class feel more intimate,

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.810
and I think that
maybe that contributed

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.100
to them talking a lot more
compared to yesterday.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.100
I mean, there are a lot
of compounding variables

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.450
with that, but they did
seem to talk a lot more.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.770
If I could do anything
different today-- well,

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.540
maybe leaving more
time for scripting.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.010
I really was going
to rely on tomorrow

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.990
to be the big scripting
day, and I realize now

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.839
that that probably wasn't the
greatest idea because people

00:01:29.839 --> 00:01:30.880
don't know how to script.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.810
And of course they
don't, because who

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.610
does if you haven't
ever done it before.

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.770
I'm excited about tomorrow
because it's a more calm day.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.240
It's more relaxed.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.420
It's more informal.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.570
It's more normal.
