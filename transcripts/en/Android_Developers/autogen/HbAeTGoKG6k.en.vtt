hi I'm Chet Haase an engineer on the

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440
hi I'm Chet Haase an engineer on the
 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.770
hi I'm Chet Haase an engineer on the
Android team at Google today I'm going

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780
Android team at Google today I'm going
 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.560
Android team at Google today I'm going
to do another show in a series I like to

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570
to do another show in a series I like to
 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.870
to do another show in a series I like to
call you're doing it wrong now the demo

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880
call you're doing it wrong now the demo
 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.369
call you're doing it wrong now the demo
you're gonna see is not code that I

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379
you're gonna see is not code that I
 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.380
you're gonna see is not code that I
would like you to copy and paste in fact

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390
would like you to copy and paste in fact
 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.820
would like you to copy and paste in fact
it is code that I would like you to not

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830
it is code that I would like you to not
 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.429
it is code that I would like you to not
copy and paste don't do what I'm doing

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439
copy and paste don't do what I'm doing
 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.980
copy and paste don't do what I'm doing
today instead it's a hacked up demo to

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990
today instead it's a hacked up demo to
 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.500
today instead it's a hacked up demo to
show an egregious example of something

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510
show an egregious example of something
 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.500
show an egregious example of something
that I have seen commonly in other

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510
that I have seen commonly in other
 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.319
that I have seen commonly in other
applications and usually the effect is

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329
applications and usually the effect is
 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.470
applications and usually the effect is
more subtle and being subtle it takes a

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480
more subtle and being subtle it takes a
 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.030
more subtle and being subtle it takes a
long time for me to track down the

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040
long time for me to track down the
 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.310
long time for me to track down the
problem but it all boils down to one

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320
problem but it all boils down to one
 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.049
problem but it all boils down to one
single problem that a lot of

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059
single problem that a lot of
 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.290
single problem that a lot of
applications share which is don't call

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300
applications share which is don't call
 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.979
applications share which is don't call
request layout during layout and let's

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989
request layout during layout and let's
 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.060
request layout during layout and let's
take a look at the demo and then we'll

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070
take a look at the demo and then we'll
 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.709
take a look at the demo and then we'll
talk a little bit about why this is a

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719
talk a little bit about why this is a
 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.630
talk a little bit about why this is a
really bad thing for your application to

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640
really bad thing for your application to
 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.670
really bad thing for your application to
do and a good thing for your application

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680
do and a good thing for your application
 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.520
do and a good thing for your application
to avoid so first of all we have this

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530
to avoid so first of all we have this
 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.500
to avoid so first of all we have this
demo I have three simple buttons there

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510
demo I have three simple buttons there
 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.660
demo I have three simple buttons there
there's an ad and a remove button and

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670
there's an ad and a remove button and
 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.939
there's an ad and a remove button and
then a layout button when I click ad

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949
then a layout button when I click ad
 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.010
then a layout button when I click ad
it's going to add a button to the

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020
it's going to add a button to the
 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.539
it's going to add a button to the
container so that button should appear

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549
container so that button should appear
 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.820
container so that button should appear
below when I remove it's going to remove

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830
below when I remove it's going to remove
 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.670
below when I remove it's going to remove
the first button in that container if

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680
the first button in that container if
 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.910
the first button in that container if
said button exists and the layout calls

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920
said button exists and the layout calls
 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.920
said button exists and the layout calls
request layout on the container itself

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930
request layout on the container itself
 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.600
request layout on the container itself
so it basically forces a layout

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610
so it basically forces a layout
 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.510
so it basically forces a layout
so first I'll click Add and nothing

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520
so first I'll click Add and nothing
 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.109
so first I'll click Add and nothing
happened

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119
happened
 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.910
happened
but you'll see actually something did

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920
but you'll see actually something did
 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.200
but you'll see actually something did
happen it's just that there was no

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210
happen it's just that there was no
 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.539
happen it's just that there was no
visual change to the activity so if I

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549
visual change to the activity so if I
 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.640
visual change to the activity so if I
call request layout forcibly on the

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650
call request layout forcibly on the
 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.590
call request layout forcibly on the
container you can now see oh well that

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600
container you can now see oh well that
 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.359
container you can now see oh well that
button actually was there we just

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369
button actually was there we just
 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.280
button actually was there we just
weren't seeing it again I can call add

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290
weren't seeing it again I can call add
 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.410
weren't seeing it again I can call add
again add another button and in fact I

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420
again add another button and in fact I
 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.390
again add another button and in fact I
have to call request layout to actually

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400
have to call request layout to actually
 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.069
have to call request layout to actually
see the button I can keep doing this

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079
see the button I can keep doing this
 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.950
see the button I can keep doing this
over and over again and each time we

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960
over and over again and each time we
 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.120
over and over again and each time we
actually add a button but nothing

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130
actually add a button but nothing
 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.060
actually add a button but nothing
happens similarly I can click on the

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070
happens similarly I can click on the
 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.630
happens similarly I can click on the
remove and a button disappears but the

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640
remove and a button disappears but the
 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.980
remove and a button disappears but the
container actually should have shrunk

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990
container actually should have shrunk
 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.300
container actually should have shrunk
around it and that simply didn't happen

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310
around it and that simply didn't happen
 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.190
around it and that simply didn't happen
so if I call request layout the right

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200
so if I call request layout the right
 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.929
so if I call request layout the right
thing happens again click remove the

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939
thing happens again click remove the
 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.999
thing happens again click remove the
button goes away but the right visual

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009
button goes away but the right visual
 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.420
button goes away but the right visual
thing didn't happen so let's take a look

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430
thing didn't happen so let's take a look
 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.160
thing didn't happen so let's take a look
at the code and then let's chat about

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170
at the code and then let's chat about
 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.410
at the code and then let's chat about
what's actually going on so here's my

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420
what's actually going on so here's my
 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.350
what's actually going on so here's my
hacked up demo and again this is not

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360
hacked up demo and again this is not
 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.830
hacked up demo and again this is not
necessarily the inst

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840
necessarily the inst
 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.230
necessarily the inst
of what I have seen in applications but

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240
of what I have seen in applications but
 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.110
of what I have seen in applications but
they all boil down to essentially this

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120
they all boil down to essentially this
 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.420
they all boil down to essentially this
logic which is requests layouts are

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430
logic which is requests layouts are
 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.250
logic which is requests layouts are
getting called somewhere either directly

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260
getting called somewhere either directly
 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.470
getting called somewhere either directly
or indirectly during the middle of the

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480
or indirectly during the middle of the
 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.270
or indirectly during the middle of the
layout process and that is the root of

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280
layout process and that is the root of
 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.840
layout process and that is the root of
the problem

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850
the problem
 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.300
the problem
so in this particular hacky demo we have

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310
so in this particular hacky demo we have
 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.220
so in this particular hacky demo we have
click listeners on the buttons for the

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230
click listeners on the buttons for the
 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.890
click listeners on the buttons for the
ad view button we set a flag that says

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900
ad view button we set a flag that says
 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.630
ad view button we set a flag that says
hey I'd like it out of you and then we

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640
hey I'd like it out of you and then we
 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.790
hey I'd like it out of you and then we
call request layout on that layout where

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800
call request layout on that layout where
 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.140
call request layout on that layout where
we're going to add the view remove

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150
we're going to add the view remove
 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.030
we're going to add the view remove
buttons similarly we set a flag and says

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040
buttons similarly we set a flag and says
 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.470
buttons similarly we set a flag and says
hey I'd like you to remove one of your

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480
hey I'd like you to remove one of your
 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.830
hey I'd like you to remove one of your
views and that we call request layout

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840
views and that we call request layout
 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.340
views and that we call request layout
and then finally the layout button does

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350
and then finally the layout button does
 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.020
and then finally the layout button does
forces a layout by calling a request

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030
forces a layout by calling a request
 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.520
forces a layout by calling a request
layout on that container and that sort

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530
layout on that container and that sort
 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.380
layout on that container and that sort
of restores the state that we thought

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390
of restores the state that we thought
 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:56.729
of restores the state that we thought
the container should have been in when

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739
the container should have been in when
 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:58.610
the container should have been in when
we did the add and remove operations

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620
we did the add and remove operations
 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.050
we did the add and remove operations
here's the custom container it has those

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060
here's the custom container it has those
 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.180
here's the custom container it has those
couple of flags in it and then it has

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190
couple of flags in it and then it has
 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.790
couple of flags in it and then it has
this on layout override so on layout is

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800
this on layout override so on layout is
 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.620
this on layout override so on layout is
a standard override from the view class

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630
a standard override from the view class
 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.360
a standard override from the view class
so if you would like to do something

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370
so if you would like to do something
 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.790
so if you would like to do something
special in your layout for instance

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800
special in your layout for instance
 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.430
special in your layout for instance
linear layout overrides on layout and

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440
linear layout overrides on layout and
 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.690
linear layout overrides on layout and
that's where it actually lays out as

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700
that's where it actually lays out as
 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.520
that's where it actually lays out as
children horizontally or vertically to

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530
children horizontally or vertically to
 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.800
children horizontally or vertically to
position them appropriately on the

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810
position them appropriately on the
 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.080
position them appropriately on the
screen before returning from on layout

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090

so in here we say ok if there's a remove

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090
so in here we say ok if there's a remove
 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.550
so in here we say ok if there's a remove
request pending then we're gonna call

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560
request pending then we're gonna call
 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.710
request pending then we're gonna call
this method that says remove button and

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720
this method that says remove button and
 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.300
this method that says remove button and
then all we're going to do is remove the

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310
then all we're going to do is remove the
 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.780
then all we're going to do is remove the
first child if that child exists and if

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790
first child if that child exists and if
 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.370
first child if that child exists and if
there's an ADD request pending then

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380
there's an ADD request pending then
 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.009
there's an ADD request pending then
we're going to add a button and then

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019
we're going to add a button and then
 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:40.319
we're going to add a button and then
we're gonna reset the flag and adding a

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:40.329
we're gonna reset the flag and adding a
 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:41.759
we're gonna reset the flag and adding a
button simply creates this button

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769
button simply creates this button
 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:43.140
button simply creates this button
allowing the way sets the layout

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150
allowing the way sets the layout
 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.110
allowing the way sets the layout
parameters accordingly set some text on

parameters accordingly set some text on
there so we know which button it is and

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620
there so we know which button it is and
 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.890
there so we know which button it is and
then we add the view so the the actual

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900
then we add the view so the the actual
 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.680
then we add the view so the the actual
code to remove and add these views and

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690
code to remove and add these views and
 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.630
code to remove and add these views and
set the properties and the layout params

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640
set the properties and the layout params
 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.420
set the properties and the layout params
on all the views although that's correct

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430
on all the views although that's correct
 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.120
on all the views although that's correct
the problem is that we're doing it in on

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130
the problem is that we're doing it in on
 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.190
the problem is that we're doing it in on
layout we're basically in the middle of

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200
layout we're basically in the middle of
 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.110
layout we're basically in the middle of
laying out the entire view hierarchy or

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120
laying out the entire view hierarchy or
 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.360
laying out the entire view hierarchy or
some subset of it that needed to be laid

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370
some subset of it that needed to be laid
 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.759
some subset of it that needed to be laid
out and that's the time when we actually

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:08.769
out and that's the time when we actually
 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:12.690
out and that's the time when we actually
call functions to add and remove views

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700
call functions to add and remove views
 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.060
call functions to add and remove views
which are going to affect the layout

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.070
which are going to affect the layout
 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:16.740
which are going to affect the layout
itself so it's kind of a recursive

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750
itself so it's kind of a recursive
 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.990
itself so it's kind of a recursive
problem where we're in the middle of

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000
problem where we're in the middle of
 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.420
problem where we're in the middle of
doing something and we change properties

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430
doing something and we change properties
 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.700
doing something and we change properties
that will side effect the thing that we

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710
that will side effect the thing that we
 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.159
that will side effect the thing that we
are trying to do in particular and

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:26.169
are trying to do in particular and
 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:26.550
are trying to do in particular and
here's

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560
here's
 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.320
here's
crux of the problem we're in the middle

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330
crux of the problem we're in the middle
 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.470
crux of the problem we're in the middle
of laying out the container and so for

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:31.480
of laying out the container and so for
 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.300
of laying out the container and so for
instance we call super dot on layout

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310
instance we call super dot on layout
 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:34.770
instance we call super dot on layout
that's going to call up into the code in

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780
that's going to call up into the code in
 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.780
that's going to call up into the code in
linear layout that figures out where all

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:36.790
linear layout that figures out where all
 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:38.460
linear layout that figures out where all
the children should be and then we're

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470
the children should be and then we're
 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.590
the children should be and then we're
going to go ahead and add or remove

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600
going to go ahead and add or remove
 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.320
going to go ahead and add or remove
children after that call and when layout

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330
children after that call and when layout
 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.510

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:50.940
flag saying I'm done with layout so
what's going to happen is we're going to

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:50.950
what's going to happen is we're going to
 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.790
what's going to happen is we're going to
either add or remove views in this code

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800
either add or remove views in this code
 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.490
either add or remove views in this code
and then we're going to return back to

and then we're going to return back to
 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.370
and then we're going to return back to

the superclass the actual layout call on
 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:00.480
the superclass the actual layout call on
the view and the view is going to say

the view and the view is going to say
okay I'm done with layout and then it

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:44.200
during layout one of the things you
 

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:45.540
during layout one of the things you
should keep in mind is that there are

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:45.550
should keep in mind is that there are
 

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:48.150
should keep in mind is that there are

layout and remove you and layout these
are the methods to call if you're

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:51.640
are the methods to call if you're
 

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.130
are the methods to call if you're
actually doing these things during the

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:53.140
actually doing these things during the
 

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:54.960
actually doing these things during the
middle of layout but the most important

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:54.970
middle of layout but the most important
 

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:56.370
middle of layout but the most important
thing to remember is when you finish

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:56.380
thing to remember is when you finish
 

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:58.590
thing to remember is when you finish
layout all with the measurement and

00:06:58.590 --> 00:06:58.600
layout all with the measurement and
 

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.570
layout all with the measurement and
layout information for that container

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:00.580
layout information for that container
 

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:03.090
layout information for that container
should be done it should be complete

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:03.100
should be done it should be complete
 

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:04.560
should be done it should be complete
which means if you're adding children

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:04.570
which means if you're adding children
 

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:06.570
which means if you're adding children
during the middle of layout you do need

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:06.580
during the middle of layout you do need
 

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:08.010
during the middle of layout you do need
to make sure that your measurement

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:08.020
to make sure that your measurement
 

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:10.530
to make sure that your measurement
information and that of your children is

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:10.540
information and that of your children is
 

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:12.090
information and that of your children is
all correct by the time you return from

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:12.100
all correct by the time you return from
 

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:14.010
all correct by the time you return from
layout because that's what the rest of

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:14.020
layout because that's what the rest of
 

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:16.980
layout because that's what the rest of
the view hierarchy expects so don't do

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:16.990
the view hierarchy expects so don't do
 

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:18.720
the view hierarchy expects so don't do
it like I did it actually do it

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:18.730
it like I did it actually do it
 

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:20.400
it like I did it actually do it
correctly instead and don't do this

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:20.410
correctly instead and don't do this
 

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:22.860
correctly instead and don't do this
stuff during layout or if you do do it

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:22.870
stuff during layout or if you do do it
 

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:24.450
stuff during layout or if you do do it
the correct way and make sure that when

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:24.460
the correct way and make sure that when
 

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:26.370
the correct way and make sure that when
your layout for your container finishes

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:26.380
your layout for your container finishes
 

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:28.980
your layout for your container finishes
everything below it is handled correctly

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:28.990
everything below it is handled correctly
 

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:30.720
everything below it is handled correctly
so that the view hierarchy is in a

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:30.730
so that the view hierarchy is in a
 

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:32.610
so that the view hierarchy is in a
consistent state with your container

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:32.620
consistent state with your container
 

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:35.310
consistent state with your container
thanks
