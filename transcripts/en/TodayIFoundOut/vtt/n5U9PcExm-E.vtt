00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:09.769
Why does Chemotherapy Causes Hair to Fall
Out?

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:16.650
It has to do with how different types of Chemotherapy
target cancer cells.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.390
There are many different Chemotherapy drugs
that work in different ways, so I will only

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.220
speak in general terms regarding their side
effects.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.540
Most cells in the human body divide using
a process called mitosis.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:34.870
This process has 5 phases (prophase, prometaphase,
metaphase, anaphase, and telephase).

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:40.039
It is preceded by interphase, and results
in the cell dividing, called cytokinesis.

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:44.570
When a cell reaches the end of its lifespan,
it gets destroyed in a pre-programed process

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.329
called apoptosis.

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:48.750
There are many types of cancer (over 200).

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.210
All types are a result of the same problem,
unregulated cell growth.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.100
The result is excessive tissue, known as tumors.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.789
These tumors can be localized, or they can
spread to surrounding areas through your lymphatic

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:02.929
system or your blood stream.

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:06.260
Many Chemotherapy drugs work by interrupting
mitosis.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.860
Most Chemotherapy cannot differentiate between
abnormal cancer cells and normal healthy cells.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.970
Because of this, cells that have high mitotic
rates (multiply rapidly) can also be affected

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.050
by Chemotherapy- cells like those found in
your hair follicles, the lining of your mouth,

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.970
stomach, and those found in your bone marrow.

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.990
The result can be hair loss, decrease in production
of white blood cells (thus why cancer patients

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.410
are immune-suppressed), and inflammation of
your digestive tract.

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:38.920
In the end, chemotherapy will hopefully kill
the cancer cells, and in the process, unfortunately,

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.430
potentially cause hair loss.

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.270
However, the healthy cells of your hair follicles
will repair themselves, making your hair loss

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:59.850
temporary, as is hopefully 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.200
your cancer!
