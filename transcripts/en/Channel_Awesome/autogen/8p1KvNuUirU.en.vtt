some ways a repeat season why this one
it's<00:06:05.070><c> like</c><00:06:05.130><c> yeah</c><00:06:05.430><c> they</c><00:06:05.639><c> even</c><00:06:05.940><c> though</c><00:06:06.000><c> they</c><00:06:06.120><c> had</c>

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
it's like yeah they even though they had
 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.420 align:start position:0%
it's like yeah they even though they had
different<00:06:06.419><c> villains</c><00:06:06.990><c> they</c><00:06:07.770><c> both</c><00:06:07.919><c> kind</c><00:06:08.310><c> of</c>

different villains they both kind of
 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:11.120 align:start position:0%

came<00:06:08.490><c> to</c><00:06:08.880><c> a</c><00:06:08.910><c> close</c><00:06:09.560><c> there</c><00:06:10.560><c> is</c><00:06:10.590><c> the</c><00:06:10.830><c> sense</c><00:06:11.039><c> that</c>

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.130 align:start position:0%
came to a close there is the sense that
 

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:12.310 align:start position:0%
came to a close there is the sense that
they<00:06:11.310><c> do</c><00:06:11.370><c> connect</c>

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:12.320 align:start position:0%

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:14.150 align:start position:0%
more and it could because they're
