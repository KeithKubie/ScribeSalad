00:00:00.733 --> 00:00:03.336
 (upbeat music)

00:00:04.904 --> 00:00:06.539
 - Nice grip, Shania!

00:00:06.572 --> 00:00:07.774
 You're gettin' strong.

00:00:07.807 --> 00:00:08.841
Your forearms are good.

00:00:08.874 --> 00:00:10.710
 - (gasp) Shania Twain.

00:00:10.743 --> 00:00:13.880 size:88% position:44%
 - Since Season One, Abbi,
 who's a trainer at the gym,

00:00:13.913 --> 00:00:16.616 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
she's been lying that
she trains Shania Twain.

00:00:16.649 --> 00:00:20.286 line:0%
 Which came about just because
 train and Twain sound similar.

00:00:20.319 --> 00:00:22.388 size:88% position:44% line:0%
 So it was kinda just, like,
 a stream of consciousness,

00:00:22.421 --> 00:00:24.390 line:0%
 "I'm training Shania Twain."

00:00:24.423 --> 00:00:26.426 size:88% position:44%
 And, as fate would have it,

00:00:26.459 --> 00:00:28.861
 today we have Shania
 Twain as a guest.

00:00:28.894 --> 00:00:31.697
 - Man, I feel like a smoothie.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.199 size:88% position:44%
 - She was so funny.

00:00:33.232 --> 00:00:36.202 line:0%
She was so down to play
with herself as an icon.

00:00:36.235 --> 00:00:37.703 size:88% position:44%
 She, like, riffs this song-

00:00:37.736 --> 00:00:40.506 align:start position:0%
  - ♪ When there's a spark,
  you've got to ride it

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:41.974 size:88% position:44%
  - (vocalizes guitar sound)

00:00:42.007 --> 00:00:46.345 align:start position:0%
  - ♪ When there's a spark,
  you've gotta ride it

00:00:46.378 --> 00:00:49.549 size:88% position:44%
 Oh, when you're in
 love, don't hide it

00:00:51.317 --> 00:00:52.152
 Ooh!

00:00:53.652 --> 00:00:55.588 size:84% position:42%
  (bleep) I'm good!

00:00:55.621 --> 00:00:56.589
- We were singing that-

00:00:56.622 --> 00:00:58.491
Like, the crew was singing that.

00:00:58.524 --> 00:01:01.327 size:88% position:44%
 - Such an honor, she was so
 fun, and sweet, and funny.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.063
- Honestly, I wanna go
home and watch Friends.

00:01:04.096 --> 00:01:05.432
- I love Friends

00:01:06.432 --> 00:01:08.534
 - I'm such a Chandler.

00:01:08.567 --> 00:01:10.136 size:88% position:44%
  - I'm such a Ross.
  / - Total Rachel.

00:01:10.169 --> 00:01:11.737 size:84% position:42%
  - A little Gunther, also.

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.307
 - Oh, I'm a little bit Phoebe.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.942 size:88% position:44%
 - In terms of Abbi
 and Trey's dynamic,

00:01:15.975 --> 00:01:17.777
we never saw it coming.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.412
 It's something that
 kinda just happened.

00:01:19.445 --> 00:01:20.613
- Say it, Trey.

00:01:20.646 --> 00:01:22.048 size:84% position:42%
  Just say it once.

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:24.918 size:88% position:44%
  - Bazinga.

00:01:26.352 --> 00:01:29.555
 He's a fitness guy, and she's,
 like, a quirky artist girl,

00:01:29.588 --> 00:01:30.790
 and he doesn't really get her.

00:01:30.823 --> 00:01:31.991 size:84% position:42%
  But Trey really
  cares about Abby,

00:01:32.024 --> 00:01:33.493
and has always really liked her.

00:01:33.526 --> 00:01:35.328 size:88% position:44%
 At some point, we realized,
 in just shooting a scene,

00:01:35.361 --> 00:01:36.863
 Trey and Abbi have chemistry.

00:01:36.896 --> 00:01:38.397
 Something's goin' on.

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.100 size:84% position:42%
  And then Ilana was, like,
  "Yes, this is happening."

00:01:41.133 --> 00:01:43.169 align:start size:88% position:13%
 And, so, it kinda
 snowballed from there.

00:01:43.202 --> 00:01:46.839 size:88% position:44%
  People who watch the show
  seem to be really into it,

00:01:46.872 --> 00:01:48.808 size:84% position:42%
  and, like, shift
  to Abbi and Trey,

00:01:48.841 --> 00:01:51.911 align:start position:0%
 and so, it was really almost
 a surprise to all of us.

00:01:51.944 --> 00:01:53.546 size:84% position:42%
  - We really like the idea
  that the Broad City world

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.848
keeps living, even when
we're not watching it.

00:01:55.881 --> 00:01:59.085
Stuff happened between Abbi and
Trey, and, like, fell apart.

00:01:59.118 --> 00:02:02.054 align:start position:0%
  - Abbi just didn't handle
  it right at the end,

00:02:02.087 --> 00:02:05.291 align:start position:0%
 and Trey and the gym didn't
 didn't have any closure.

00:02:05.324 --> 00:02:09.262
- We wanted to give Trey
a goodbye, a farewell.

00:02:10.696 --> 00:02:13.533 align:start size:88% position:13%
  - Let me train her
  with you, okay?

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.068
 I could be your Goose.

00:02:16.101 --> 00:02:18.304 size:88% position:44%
  - Do not bring up
  Top Gun right now.

00:02:18.337 --> 00:02:20.072 align:start position:0%
  - It felt like a different
  way of storytelling;

00:02:20.105 --> 00:02:21.707 align:start position:0%
  it was, like, backtracking
  of dealing with

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.576
 the end of a hookup.

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:25.378
Just felt like a really fun way

00:02:25.411 --> 00:02:28.314
 of finishing off their story.

00:02:28.347 --> 00:02:30.383
Okay ... Shania?

00:02:30.416 --> 00:02:32.718 size:88% position:44%
 Can you call 9-1-1?

00:02:32.751 --> 00:02:33.653
- Yeah.

00:02:33.686 --> 00:02:35.621
 His dick is definitely broken.

00:02:35.654 --> 00:02:38.224
 (upbeat music)
