AND JUDGE GINSBERG.  I WILL VERY
 PREVIOUSLY JUST TELL YOU 

00:16:02.519 --> 00:16:08.196
SOMETHING IN CONTEXT ABOUT THIS 
PLAY.  AND THE IMPORTANCE TO 

00:16:11.028 --> 00:16:13.028
JEWISH HISTORY.  AMERICAN 
SEPHARDIC FEDERATION IS HISTORIC

00:16:13.325 --> 00:16:17.887
 AND WE STUDY THE HISTORY AND WE
 PRESERVE AND PROMOTE THE 

00:16:17.888 --> 00:16:20.765
HISTORY OF WHAT I CALL THE 
UNKNOWN JEWS.

00:16:20.766 --> 00:16:24.373
THERE IS A VERY LARGE CONTINGENT
 OF JEWS THAT COME FROM THE 

00:16:24.374 --> 00:16:27.211
MIDDLE EAST, THE FAR EAST, NORTH
 AFRICA AND ORIGINALLY SOME

00:16:31.447 --> 00:16:35.450
 OF THEM FROM SPAIN, AND 
PORTUGAL.  

00:16:35.451 --> 00:16:37.451
THEY ARE LARGELY FOR GOTTEN IN

00:16:38.950 --> 00:16:44.118
 HISTORY TODAY AND YOU WILL WANT
 TO SEE WHY THEY ARE ASSOCIATED 

00:16:44.611 --> 00:16:50.019
IN THIS EVENT.  FROM THE 
PENINSULA, THE MIDDLE EAST, THE 

00:16:50.414 --> 00:16:57.600
FAR EAST, AND IMPORTANTLY, THE 
JEWS CAME HERE VERY EARLY, BY 

00:16:57.601 --> 00:17:00.157
MAINLY THE CARIBBEAN AND IT'S 
THEREFORE A PLEASURE TODAY BY 

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:02.500
THE AMERICAN SEPHARDIC 
FEDERATION TO CONVEY THAT

00:17:03.643 --> 00:17:07.994
 WE HAVE SINCE LONG ADOPTED THE 
MERCHANT OF VENICE AS A 

00:17:07.995 --> 00:17:14.706
SEPHARDIC JEW.  JEW ORIGINATING 
TO THE MASS EXIDUS OF JEWS FROM 

00:17:14.707 --> 00:17:21.752
THE SYBERIAN PENINSULA.  AND WE 
AT THE SEPHARDIC FEDERATION 

00:17:23.584 --> 00:17:27.677
GUARD IT AMONG SEVERAL OTHER.  
THERE ARE HINTS IN SHAKESPEARE 

00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:31.233
PLAY THAT THIS IS PROBABLY A 
SEPHARDIC JEW FROM SPAIN.  

00:17:31.234 --> 00:17:37.441
BEFORE I EXPLAIN, ALLOW ME FIRST
 TO OUTLINE WHY IN SOME WAY THE 

00:17:38.078 --> 00:17:39.992
MERCHANT OF VENICE IS VIEWED AS 
A GIFT TO THE PEOPLE OF 

00:17:39.993 --> 00:17:44.447
SHAKESPEARE.  THIS IS THE 
PERSPECTIVE.  BECAUSE OF THE 

00:17:45.515 --> 00:17:48.180
UNDERSTANDABLE AND ENORMOUS 
TENSION TO THE HORRORS OF THE 

00:17:48.355 --> 00:17:52.544
HOLOCAUST, THERE IS LITTLE FOCUS
 IN INTEREST TO REMIND US TODAY 

00:17:53.881 --> 00:18:00.386
TO THE TERRIBLE FLIGHT IN EUROPE
 FROM THE PEOPLE IN THE EARLY 

00:18:00.387 --> 00:18:04.921
PERIOD FROM THE HOLOCAUST AND 
THE MASSIVE ATTACK AND THE DRIVE

00:18:04.922 --> 00:18:09.151
 OF JEWS IN 1948.  BECAUSE OF 
THE BRILLIANCE AND FAME OF 

00:18:09.775 --> 00:18:11.775
SHAKESPEARE AND THE BRILLIANCE 
OF HIS PLAY, THE MERCHANT OF 

00:18:14.299 --> 00:18:16.299
VENICE IS A REMINDER OF THE 
JEWISH 

00:18:18.306 --> 00:18:22.971
PEOPLE.  HELP TO REBUILD JEWISH 
HISTORY, INCLUDING FOR EXAMPLE 

00:18:22.972 --> 00:18:24.972
THE SLAUGHTER OF THE LARGE 
JEWISH COMMUNITIES ALONG

00:18:28.033 --> 00:18:37.026
 THE RIVER IN EUROPE IN SOUTHERN
 FRANCE AND MASS EXPULSION IN 

00:18:37.305 --> 00:18:44.323
SPAIN, PORTUGAL, SISILY, AND 
VENICE AND MANY OTHER PARTS OF 

00:18:44.324 --> 00:18:48.355
THE MEDITERRANEAN.  IN TIMES OF 
SHAKESPEARE WRITING THE PLAY, 

00:18:48.356 --> 00:18:57.684
THERE WAS VERSES INCLUDING IN 
VENICE AND IN ENGLAND AT THE 

00:18:57.685 --> 00:19:05.148
TIME, ENGLAND WAS IN THE 
ELIZABETHIAN ERA WHICH WAS VERY 

00:19:05.674 --> 00:19:13.495
ANTI-JEWISH.  JEWS WERE ONLY 
ALLOWED BACK IN 1656, 60 YEARS 

00:19:13.656 --> 00:19:17.032
AFTER THE MERCHANT OF VENICE.  
IN SUMMARY, IT'S NOTE WORTHY 

00:19:17.293 --> 00:19:20.770
THAT THE PLAY AT THE TIME ONLY 
DEALS WITH BASICALLY FINANCIAL 

00:19:21.424 --> 00:19:24.523
MATTERS AND NOT SOMETHING MUCH 
WORSE.  WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN 

00:19:25.257 --> 00:19:28.655
TYPICAL OF THE DAY.  IN OTHER 
WORDS, FOR THIS REASON, AND THE 

00:19:29.996 --> 00:19:34.410
FAMOUS MONOLOGUE IN THE PLAY, 
OPTIMISTICALLY VIEWED, THIS IS 

00:19:34.712 --> 00:19:36.712
ONE OF THE EARLIER EUROPEAN 
ATTEMPTS TO HUMANIZE 

00:19:37.469 --> 00:19:42.340
JEWS.  THE NEXT ATTEMPT IN 
ENGLAND REALLY ONLY CAME WITH 

00:19:42.341 --> 00:19:47.392
THE POPULAR NOVEL IN 1820 WITH 
REBECCA AND HER FATHER BEING 

00:19:47.393 --> 00:19:55.376
AMONG THE LEAD CHARACTERS.  
PERHAPS EVEN PAVING THE WAY FOR 

00:19:55.377 --> 00:20:00.423
ISRAELI MINISTERS, 200 YEARS 
AFTER THE MERCHANTS OF VENICE.  

00:20:00.424 --> 00:20:05.207
WHERE JEWS HAD TO LIVE WAS 
CONSTITUTED IN 1516 AS YOU 

00:20:05.208 --> 00:20:07.208
HEARD. 

00:20:09.204 --> 00:20:13.056
 AND SEVERAL VERY  VERY 
WELL-KNOWN SEPHARDIC JEWS CAME 

00:20:13.057 --> 00:20:15.057
TO VENICE AND ALLOWED

00:20:18.823 --> 00:20:20.823
 TO LIVE 

00:20:24.605 --> 00:20:26.605
MORE

00:20:31.683 --> 00:20:43.325
 FREELY.  AND BY THE GHETTO THE 
STRICT

00:20:22.574 --> 00:20:24.574
 BOUNDARIES WERE SWEEPING

00:20:26.002 --> 00:20:30.610
 THE ROUNDS THE ROUNDS OF THE 
CATHOLIC CHURCH.  AREAS, THE 

00:20:25.327 --> 00:20:27.327
GHETTO AND THE ADJACENT

00:20:37.475 --> 00:20:39.475
 GHETTO. 
THESE NAMES OF THE GHETTOS ARE

00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:47.156
 GHETTO. 
THESE NAMES OF THE GHETTOS ARE 

00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:46.490
MISLEADING.  FROM DIFFERENT 

00:20:54.568 --> 00:20:57.234
 GHETTO. 
THESE NAMES OF THE GHETTOS ARE 

00:20:54.568 --> 00:20:58.568
MISLEADING.  FROM DIFFERENT 
BACKGROUNDS CAME TO LIVE IN THE 

00:20:54.568 --> 00:20:56.568
GHETTO.  AND

00:21:08.896 --> 00:21:11.562
 GHETTO. 
THESE NAMES OF THE GHETTOS ARE 

00:21:08.896 --> 00:21:12.896
MISLEADING.  FROM DIFFERENT 
BACKGROUNDS CAME TO LIVE IN THE 

00:21:08.896 --> 00:21:10.896
GHETTO.  AND OVERTIME THEY HAD 
DEVELOPED A DISTINCT VENITIAN

00:21:23.552 --> 00:22:00.988
 IDENTITY AND KNEW STRONGLY TO 
IDENTIFY WITH THEIR TO IDENTIFY 

00:20:50.316 --> 00:20:52.987
WITH THEIR ORIGINS AND THEREFORE
 FOUR OF THE FIVE SYNAGOGUES, 

00:20:52.988 --> 00:20:54.988
ACCORDING TO

00:20:56.348 --> 00:20:58.348
 ETHNIC IDENTITY IN THE GHETTO. 

00:21:00.887 --> 00:21:02.887
 THE GERMAN SYNAGOGUE, THE 
ITALIAN SYNAGOGUE,

00:21:05.851 --> 00:21:14.131
 THE ITALIAN AND PORTOGESE AND 
THE 5TH SYNAGOGUE THAT WAS BUILT

00:21:14.132 --> 00:21:16.132
 SPECIFICALLY FOR USE.  THE 
LANGUAGES SPOKEN AT 

00:21:18.818 --> 00:21:20.818
THE TIME IN THE GHETTO, INCLUDED
 VENETIAN,

00:21:22.814 --> 00:21:24.814
 ITALIAN, SPANISH, ARABIC, 
SPANISH, FRENCH

00:21:28.529 --> 00:21:32.892
 AND GERMAN AND WHILE HEBREW WAS
 TRADITIONALLY USED FOR OFFICIAL

00:21:37.366 --> 00:21:39.366
 PURPOSES, AND OF COURSE IN 

00:21:40.958 --> 00:21:42.958
RELIGIOUS SERVICES.  ALLOW ME 
FINALLY

00:21:43.028 --> 00:21:46.300
 A QUICK BACKGROUND ON THE WORD 
GHETTO.  LIKE WITH SO MUCH ABOUT

00:21:46.465 --> 00:21:50.743
 THE PLAY, THERE ARE DIFFERENT 
EXPLANATIONS AND THEORIES.  

00:21:50.744 --> 00:21:54.773
ABOUT THE ORIGINS OF THE WORD.  
SOME SAY THE WORD ORIGINATES 

00:21:54.774 --> 00:21:59.652
FROM THE FOUNDERS IN VENICE 
WHERE THE ITALIAN WROTE GHETTO. 

00:21:59.653 --> 00:22:04.583
 IT'S VERY SIMILAR TO GHETTO.  
BUT IT'S MOST LIKELY THAT THE 

00:22:04.584 --> 00:22:10.725
WORD GHETTO DERIVES FROM THE 
CATHOLIC WORD GATTO WHICH MEANS 

00:22:10.726 --> 00:22:12.427
STREET AND THE REASON FOR THAT

00:22:12.428 --> 00:22:16.721
 IS THAT THE JEWS, THROUGHOUT 
THE MIDDLE AGES, USUALLY 

00:22:16.722 --> 00:22:21.286
CONGREGATED ALONG ONE STREET 
WHERE THEY WOULD HAVE ALL THE 

00:22:21.287 --> 00:22:25.138
SHOPS AND PLACES OF COMMERCE.  
SO IT WAS

00:22:28.733 --> 00:22:29.152
 VERY EASY TO DECIDE TO ENCLOSE 
A STREET LIKE THAT AND PUT 

00:22:29.153 --> 00:22:31.153
BOUNDARIES. 

00:22:38.211 --> 00:22:45.341
JEWS GHETTO AND THE 28-YEAR-OLD 
NAPOLEON IN 1797, FOLLOWING THE 

00:22:45.641 --> 00:22:49.689
CONQUEST OF THE NATION.  THAT'S 
WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW.  THANK 

00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:39.700
YOU.  [APPLAUSE]. 

00:23:58.638 --> 00:24:45.203
YOU.  [APPLAUSE]. 
SPEAKER:  EVENING.  I HAVE BEEN 

00:23:15.406 --> 00:23:17.406
GIVEN THE TASK OF EXPLAINING TO 
YOU A PLAY THAT I 

00:23:18.555 --> 00:23:23.094
THINK YOU HAVE ALL SEEN AND 
READ.  BUT I WILL MAYBE REFRESH 

00:23:24.178 --> 00:23:28.427
YOUR MIND ABOUT THE STORY.  JUST
 LET ME TELL YOU THAT IT WAS 

00:23:28.428 --> 00:23:30.428
FIRST PUBLISHED IN 1600. 

00:23:35.225 --> 00:23:39.491
 YOU THAT IT WAS FIRST PUBLISHED
 IN 1600.  AND THAT MUCH OF THE 

00:23:35.225 --> 00:23:37.225
TIME, TOOK THE 

00:23:42.022 --> 00:23:44.022
STORIES

00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:54.100
STORIES THAT HE HAD READ, THAT 
WERE WRITTEN EARLIER.  ONE WAS

00:24:05.287 --> 00:24:09.420
STORIES THAT HE HAD READ, THAT 
WERE WRITTEN EARLIER.  ONE WAS 

00:24:05.287 --> 00:24:07.287
THE STORY OF THE BOND OF PLEDGE 
AND THE OTHER WAS

00:24:21.037 --> 00:25:09.593
 THE STORY OF THE CASKETS.  NOW 
THE MERCHANT OF VENICE, WE VERY 

00:23:36.747 --> 00:23:39.185
OFTEN CONFUSE THE FACT, WE THINK
 THAT THE 

00:23:50.634 --> 00:23:52.634
DIALECT IS SUCH A CHARACTER.  WE
 THINK THAT

00:23:56.243 --> 00:23:58.243
 A CHARACTER.  WE THINK THAT THE
 MERCHANT OF VENICE IS

00:24:03.774 --> 00:24:08.040
 A CHARACTER.  WE THINK THAT THE
 MERCHANT OF VENICE IS SHYLOCK. 

00:24:03.774 --> 00:24:05.774
 BUT HE IS THE REAL MERCHANT OF

00:24:14.508 --> 00:24:18.774
 A CHARACTER.  WE THINK THAT THE
 MERCHANT OF VENICE IS SHYLOCK. 

00:24:14.508 --> 00:24:18.774
 BUT HE IS THE REAL MERCHANT OF 
VENICE.  IN THE BEGINNING OF THE

00:24:14.508 --> 00:24:16.508
 PLAY, ANTONIO, WITH

00:24:29.867 --> 00:24:34.133
 A CHARACTER.  WE THINK THAT THE
 MERCHANT OF VENICE IS SHYLOCK. 

00:24:29.867 --> 00:24:34.133
 BUT HE IS THE REAL MERCHANT OF 
VENICE.  IN THE BEGINNING OF THE

00:24:29.867 --> 00:24:34.133
 PLAY, ANTONIO, WITH SEVERAL OF 
HIS FRIENDS, YOUNG MEN WITH WHOM

00:24:29.867 --> 00:24:31.867
 ARE DESANIO

00:24:45.383 --> 00:24:47.383
 AND

00:25:02.477 --> 00:26:15.223
 LOREZNO.  LOREZNO.   LOREZNO.  
DESANIO CAME TO ANTONIO, 

00:23:53.531 --> 00:23:55.531
ADMITTING

00:24:10.015 --> 00:24:12.015
 THAT HE HAD HE HAD SPENT A LOT 
OF

00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:16.387
 ANTONIO'S MONEY TRYING TO 
BETTERMONEY TRYING TO BETTER 

00:24:16.388 --> 00:24:16.907
HIMSELF AND ALSO BUYING A LOT OF
 VERY GOOD ITEMS AND CLOTHES AND

00:24:16.908 --> 00:24:18.908
 MADE A GREAT MAN ABOUT TIME.  
AND HE TELLS ANTONIO

00:24:25.575 --> 00:24:25.730
 THAT HE HAS THE POSSIBILITY OF 
REPAYING ALL OF THAT MONEY 

00:24:25.731 --> 00:24:27.731
AGAIN,

00:24:29.168 --> 00:24:31.168
 BECAUSE HE

00:24:32.762 --> 00:24:34.762
 HAS FOUND A BEAUTIFUL

00:24:39.361 --> 00:24:47.155
 HEIR LIVING OUTSIDE AN ISLAND 
NAMED PORSHA AND WISHES TO HAVE 

00:24:47.156 --> 00:24:49.156
HER

00:24:50.748 --> 00:24:50.963
 HAND IN MARRIAGE AND DOESN'T 
HAVE MUCH MONEY AT THE MOMENT.  

00:24:50.964 --> 00:24:52.964
AND SAYS TO YOU, I WANT

00:24:54.956 --> 00:24:57.340
 TO DO THIS AND GOES TO THE ONLY
 PLACE WHERE HE CAN GET THAT 

00:24:57.341 --> 00:24:59.341
MONEY, AND THAT IS

00:25:02.232 --> 00:25:06.722
 TO SHYLOCK, WHO SHYLOCK TELLS 
HIM FIRST,HIM FIRST, OF COURSE, 

00:25:06.723 --> 00:25:10.851
HOW BADLY HE AND HIS FELLOW JEWS
 HAD BEEN TREATED BY THE 

00:25:10.852 --> 00:25:12.852
MERCHANTS OF VENICE AND YET COME
 TO HIM FOR MONEY. 

00:25:14.235 --> 00:25:16.918
 BUT HE SAYS, ISAYS, I WILL DO 
THIS.  AND IN THE PROCESS OF 

00:25:16.919 --> 00:25:18.919
THIS NEGOTIATION

00:25:20.113 --> 00:25:22.113
 SAYS,

00:25:25.801 --> 00:25:27.801
 YOU KNOW, I AM NOT GOING TO 
CHARGE YOU 

00:25:30.065 --> 00:25:35.003
ANYTHING.  I JUST WANT.  LET ME 
SAY, I'LL TAKE A POUND OF YOUR 

00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:38.725
FLESH.  TO BE CUT FROM WHEREVER 
AND YOUR BODY I WISH.  ANTONIO 

00:25:38.726 --> 00:25:42.312
WHO HAS BEEN A SUCCESSFUL 
MERCHANT FINDS THIS ACTUALLY A 

00:25:42.313 --> 00:25:44.313
CHARITABLE REQUEST, BECAUSE

00:25:45.872 --> 00:25:50.943
 IT'S BASICALLY IMPOSSIBLE.  AND
 HE COMES HOME WITH THE MONEY 

00:25:50.944 --> 00:25:52.944
AND BESANIO

00:25:56.583 --> 00:25:58.583
 GOES OFF TO BELLMONT

00:26:02.021 --> 00:26:09.913
 FOR PORSHA.  AND WE SHOULD 
MENTION YOUNG LORENZO.  WHO HAS 

00:26:09.914 --> 00:26:11.298
SEEN AND PERHAPS BECOME 
ATTRACTIVE AND FALLEN IN LOVE 

00:26:11.299 --> 00:26:13.299
WITH

00:26:15.390 --> 00:26:20.500
 A YOUNG JEW WHO LIVES IN THE 
GHETTO.  

00:26:20.501 --> 00:26:23.469
JESSICA.  IN THE PLAY RATHER 
EARLY ON, LORENZO ABDUCTS

00:26:26.958 --> 00:26:30.098
 JESSICA, QUITE WILLINGLY WHO 
LEAVES THE GHETTO AND HER FATHER

00:26:30.577 --> 00:26:32.577
 WITH A

00:26:33.988 --> 00:26:35.988
 GREAT DEAL OF HIS MONEY. 
SHYLOCK IS DEEPLY, DEEPLY, 

00:26:38.806 --> 00:26:40.806
DEEPLY DISTRESSED

00:26:44.213 --> 00:26:46.213
 BY THIS. 

00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:54.292
DISASTROUS.  THE SHIPS ARE 
WRECKED AND CANNOT PAY SHYLOCK 

00:26:54.293 --> 00:26:56.293
BACK.  THIS

00:26:57.535 --> 00:27:01.345
 COMES VERY SOON AFTER SHYLOCK 
-- HIS DAUGHTER HAS BEEN STOLEN 

00:27:01.346 --> 00:27:03.346
AND SHYLOCK DEMANDS THAT THE

00:27:03.583 --> 00:27:06.895
 BOND BE PAID.  
AND THAT THE POUND OF FLESH BE 

00:27:07.738 --> 00:27:16.562
TAKEN FROM ANTONIO'S BODY.  HERE
 IS A GREAT TRIAL WHICH WILL BE 

00:27:19.202 --> 00:27:21.363
DISCUSSED TONIGHT.  THE TRIAL.  
PORSHA

00:27:24.894 --> 00:27:27.583
 ARRIVES, DRESSED AS A MAN AND 
PRETENDS TO BE

00:27:31.191 --> 00:27:33.191
 A LAWYER.  
AND EVENTUALLY WINS

00:27:35.556 --> 00:27:37.556
 ANTONIO'S SUIT.  THIS

00:27:40.425 --> 00:27:42.425
 END NOT ONLY HAS TO GIVE HIS 
MONEY, BUT ALSO ASKED

00:27:44.765 --> 00:27:48.118
 AND TOLD THAT HE MUST FEED THAT
 TIE AS A CHRISTIAN AT THE END

00:27:51.884 --> 00:27:57.336
 OF THIS TRIAL.  THIS PLAY, 
EVERYBODY GOES BACK TO BELLMONT 

00:27:57.337 --> 00:27:59.921
AND SEEMS TO GET ALONG VERY 
WELL.  OTHER PRODUCTIONS, NOT SO

00:27:59.922 --> 00:28:01.922
 WELL.  AND IT IS WHY SHYLOCK 
WHO ENDS THE

00:28:04.832 --> 00:28:07.518
 4TH ACT.  AND THE AND THE 5TH 
ACT IS BELMONT AND THAT'S WHY 

00:28:09.503 --> 00:28:14.913
THIS PLAY IS ALWAYS PUT FIRST 
FOR COMEDIES, BECAUSE IT SEEMS 

00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:17.280
TO HAVE A HAPPY ENDING.  BUT 
THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT THE 

00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:26.263
RESIDENT ISSUE OF THIS PLAY AND 
THE LARGER PART OF THIS PLAY IS 

00:28:26.536 --> 00:28:28.536
SHYLOCK AND HIS FAITH.  AND 
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO TALK 

00:29:20.956 --> 00:29:22.956
ABOUT TONIGHT.  [APPLAUSE]. 

00:29:43.331 --> 00:30:35.402
ABOUT TONIGHT.  [APPLAUSE]. 
SPEAKER: EVENING.  IN THIS FIRST

00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:57.260
 SPEECH

00:28:58.744 --> 00:29:00.744
 SHYLOCK EXPRESSES

00:29:05.259 --> 00:29:08.490
 HIS SURPRISE QUEST.  SENIOR 
ANTONIO, MANY TIME OFTEN YOU 

00:29:11.284 --> 00:29:20.638
HAVE RATED ME ABOUT MY USE.  
BORN WITH THE PATIENT SHRUG OR 

00:29:20.982 --> 00:29:22.982

I'M A 

00:31:34.635 --> 00:31:36.635
JEW. 

00:31:57.392 --> 00:32:03.554
 OTHER JEW EYES.  
OTHER JEW HANDS, ORGANS, 

00:32:04.621 --> 00:32:09.330
DIMENSIONS, SENSES, PASSIONS.  
FED WITH THE SAME FOOD.  HURT 

00:32:09.892 --> 00:32:12.448
WITH THE SAME WEAPONS.  SUBJECT 
TO THE SAME DISEASES.  HEALED BY

00:32:13.833 --> 00:32:17.769
 THE SAME MEANS.  WARMED AND 

00:32:23.292 --> 00:32:28.737
COOLED BY THE SAME SUMMER THAT A
 CHRISTIAN IS.  DO NOT BLEED.  

00:32:28.738 --> 00:32:36.735
IF YOU TICKLE US, IF YOU POISON 
US, DO WE NOT DIE.  AND IF YOU 

00:32:36.736 --> 00:32:42.287
ARE AMONG US, SHALL WE NOT 
REVENGE. 

00:32:42.288 --> 00:32:44.288
WHEN WE REST, WE WILL

00:32:47.153 --> 00:32:56.729
 RESEMBLE YOU IN THAT.  WHAT IS 
HIS HUMILITY?  REVENGE.  A 

00:32:56.730 --> 00:33:05.139
CHRISTIAN OR A JEW, WHAT SHOULD 
HIS SUFFERANCE BE BY CHRISTIAN 

00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:11.680
FOR EXAMPLE?  WHY REVENGE?  THE 
VILLIAN YOU TEACH ME, I SHALL 

00:33:15.746 --> 00:33:24.309
EXECUTE AND IT SHALL GO HARD.  
BUT I WILL BETTER.  LASTLY, 

00:33:25.158 --> 00:33:30.460
SHALL I USE IN COURT AGAINST 
USING MERCY TO TEMPER JUSTICE IN

00:33:30.461 --> 00:33:32.461
 THE HOPES OF RECEIVING THE

00:33:36.191 --> 00:33:42.136
 SAME KINDNESS IN GOD'S FINAL 
JUDGMENT.  WHAT JUDGMENT SHALL I

00:33:42.137 --> 00:33:50.345
 DREAD DOING NO WRONG?  MANY 
APPROACH THE SLAVES LIKE

00:33:52.863 --> 00:33:54.863
 WHAT WHAT YOU USE IN OBJECTS 
FOR SLAVES BECAUSE YOU BOUGHT

00:33:56.840 --> 00:34:01.469
 THEM.  SHALL I SAY TO YOU IT 
CAN BE FREE, MARRY THEM TO YOUR 

00:34:03.527 --> 00:34:05.527
HEIRS.  
BURDENS, LET THE BEDS BE MADE AS

00:34:07.788 --> 00:34:09.788
 SOFT AS YOURS.  AND LET THEIR 
PAST BE WITH

00:34:12.364 --> 00:34:19.171
 SUCH DEMONS.  YOU WILL SAVE US.
  HOW DO I ANSWER YOU?  THE 

00:34:19.172 --> 00:34:25.932
POUND OF FLESH WHICH I DEMAND OF
 HIM IS DEARLY BOUGHT. 

00:34:25.933 --> 00:34:27.933
IT'S 

00:34:33.511 --> 00:34:36.177
BOUGHT. 
IT'S MINE.  AND I WILL HAVE IT. 

00:34:33.511 --> 00:34:35.511
IF YOU

00:34:42.152 --> 00:34:44.152
 DENY

00:34:51.183 --> 00:35:03.113
 ME, PRY UPON THE HORSE INTO THE
 CREASE OF

00:34:42.053 --> 00:34:44.053
  VENICE.
JUDGMENT.  ANSWER.  SHALL

00:34:49.647 --> 00:34:51.647
 I HAVE IT?  [APPLAUSE].

00:35:10.707 --> 00:35:16.444
 PROCEED WITH SHYLOCK APPEAL.  
BEFORE WE DO SO, LET ME CAUTION 

00:35:16.445 --> 00:35:23.510
COUNSEL THAT THE BENCH IS HAVING
 GREAT DIFFICULTY HEARING.  SO 

00:35:23.511 --> 00:35:27.870
YOU MIGHT TIP THE PODIUM 

00:35:30.965 --> 00:35:33.293
SLIGHTLY.  
SAFELY.  WE WILL HEAR FIRST FROM

00:35:41.105 --> 00:35:43.636
 SHYLOCK'S COUNSEL.  
SPEAKER:  GOOD AFTERNOON, YOUR 

00:35:43.637 --> 00:35:45.637
HONOR. 

00:35:46.646 --> 00:35:48.407
 I'M MICHAEL KLOTZ FOR THE 
APPELLANT.  BEFORE WE BEGIN I 

00:35:48.408 --> 00:35:50.408
WOULD LIKE TO RESERVE

00:35:52.071 --> 00:35:54.182
 TWO MINUTES FOR REBUTTAL.  
THERE ARE TWO CENTRAL ISSUES IN 

00:35:54.183 --> 00:35:56.183
THIS 

00:35:58.277 --> 00:36:01.219
APPEAL.  THE FIRST ISSUE IS 
WHETHER THE PARTIES THAT HAVE 

00:36:03.635 --> 00:36:05.710
ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT 
HAVEN'T FULFILLED ITS 

00:36:06.519 --> 00:36:08.519
OBLIGATIONS AND ABLE TO KEEP THE
 FRUITS OF THE AGREEMENT. 

00:36:09.941 --> 00:36:13.741
 TO KEEP THE FRUITS OF THE 
AGREEMENT.  MY CLIENT SHYLOCK 

00:36:09.941 --> 00:36:11.941
ENTERED INTO A LOAN AGREEMENT 
FOR 3,000

00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:15.560
 DOCKETS AND LENT TO BASANIO AND

00:36:18.175 --> 00:36:24.801
 ANTONIO WAS THE GUARANTOR FOR 
THAT AND THE MONEY WAS DUE AND 

00:36:24.802 --> 00:36:26.559
THE LOAN 

00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:29.058
WAS NOT REPAID AND TO THIS DAY, 
ANTONIO CONTINUES TO HOLD THE 

00:36:29.059 --> 00:36:31.590
MONEY AND NO INTEREST HAS BEEN 
PAID AND MY PAID AND MY CLIENT 

00:36:31.591 --> 00:36:33.591
HAS BEEN OUT OF LUCK.  THE ISSUE
 IN THIS

00:36:38.836 --> 00:36:40.836
 APPEAL IS WHETHER A NON-CITIZEN
 WHO

00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:43.960
 GOES TO A COURT AND DRAFTS A

00:36:44.861 --> 00:36:47.505
 LEGAL JUDGMENT CAN, IN DOING 
SO, COMMIT A CRIMINAL ACT.  AND 

00:36:47.506 --> 00:36:54.236
THAT IS WHAT MY CLIENT HAS BEEN 
CONVICTED OF.  SHYLOCK WENT TO 

00:36:56.961 --> 00:37:00.044
COURT AND ASKED TO HAVE THE 
CONTRACT ENFORCED AND HE ASKED 

00:37:00.045 --> 00:37:02.045
SPECIFICALLY TO HAVE THE PENALTY
 PROVISION

00:37:03.308 --> 00:37:05.741
 ENFORCED.  AND UNBE

00:37:09.134 --> 00:37:11.134
UNBEKNOWNST TO

00:37:12.407 --> 00:37:17.962
 HIM, PORSHA WAS DESCRIBED AS A 
JUDGE AND SHE IS NOT A JUDGE.  

00:37:17.963 --> 00:37:20.538
ISSUED A JUDGMENT AGAINST HIM 
AND FOUND THAT HE VIOLATED THE 

00:37:20.539 --> 00:37:23.561
ALIEN ACT WHICH PROTECTS ANY 
NON-CITIZEN

00:37:27.051 --> 00:37:30.935
 LIFE OF A CITIZEN.  AND SO IN 
MAKING THIS APPEAL TO THE COURT,

00:37:31.357 --> 00:37:36.509
 PLEASE GIVE ME THE MONEY DUE 
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, PORSHA 

00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:39.478
SAID THIS WAS ATTEMPTED MURDER 
AND OUR ARGUMENT ON THAT ISSUE 

00:37:39.701 --> 00:37:42.521
WAS, THAT CAN'T BE.  IT CAN'T BE
 THE CASE THAT WHEN SOMEBODY 

00:37:42.522 --> 00:37:44.708
GOES TO A COURT AND ASKS FOR 
JUSTICE, THAT

00:37:48.988 --> 00:37:52.859
 THAT'S A CRIME.  SO WE ASK THAT

00:37:56.448 --> 00:37:58.448
THE JUDGE BE

00:37:59.886 --> 00:38:03.045
 REVERSED WITHOUT RETRIAL, AND 
ANYTHING ELSE THAT THE JUDGE 

00:38:03.046 --> 00:38:05.814
DEEMS FIT.  
SPEAKER:  I WOULD LIKE 

00:38:06.218 --> 00:38:12.490
CLARIFICATION ON TWO POINTS.  
ONE, ARE YOU DEMANDING THE POUND

00:38:12.491 --> 00:38:14.491
 OF FLESH OR HAVE YOU

00:38:20.490 --> 00:38:23.340
 RELINQUISHED THAT REQUEST? 

00:38:30.938 --> 00:38:32.938
RELINQUISHING THE REQUEST AND

00:38:36.196 --> 00:38:38.196
 BELIEVE THAT WAS LEGAL. 
SPEAKER:  SO YOU ARE DEMANDING 

00:38:38.569 --> 00:38:40.569
RETURN OF YOUR

00:38:43.143 --> 00:38:46.194
 MONEY.  YOU SAID INTEREST BUT I
 THINK THE RECORD SHOWS THAT AT 

00:38:46.195 --> 00:38:48.195
THE TIME THIS LOAN WAS

00:38:51.871 --> 00:38:54.275
 NEGOTIATED, YOU SAID MY MONEY. 
 YOU WERE GIVING THE MONEY AND 

00:38:54.276 --> 00:38:58.352
YOU WERE NOT DEMANDING INTEREST.
  YOU WERE DEMANDING ONLY THE 

00:38:58.353 --> 00:39:02.582
POUND OF FLESH.  IS IT NOT TRUE 
THAT YOU RELINQUISHED

00:39:06.882 --> 00:39:10.233
 ANY CLAIMS OF INTEREST?  
SPEAKER:  YOUR HONOR, IN THAT 

00:39:10.945 --> 00:39:14.297
SAME NEGOTIATION, MY CLIENT 
REFERENCED THAT WHEN THE LOAN 

00:39:14.746 --> 00:39:19.628
CAME DUE, THAT HE WOULD BE GIVEN
 SUCH SUMS AS DUE UNDER THE 

00:39:19.865 --> 00:39:23.273
AGREEMENT SO I THINK IT WOULD BE
 UP TO THE COURT TO EXAMINE THE 

00:39:23.274 --> 00:39:25.275
CONTRACT AND DETERMINE WHETHER 
THERE IS PREJUDGMENT INTEREST.  

00:39:26.614 --> 00:39:29.252
THE PREJUDGMENT INTEREST IS FOR 
THE THREE MONTH PERIOD OF THE 

00:39:29.458 --> 00:39:31.458
LOAN AND THE POST JUDGMENT 
INTEREST IS WHEN THE

00:39:34.701 --> 00:39:36.701
 LOAN CAME

00:39:38.035 --> 00:39:41.967
 DUE UNTIL TODAY.  [LAUGHTER].  
SPEAKER:  THERE IS ANOTHER 

00:39:42.273 --> 00:39:46.713
UNUSUAL FEATURE OF THIS 
PROCEEDING.  ANTONIO IS SURE 

00:39:47.843 --> 00:39:51.605
THAT THE BENEFICIARY OF THE LOAN
 IS BASANIO BUT YOU ARE NOT 

00:39:51.606 --> 00:39:54.290
SUING BASANIO.  YOU BROUGHT A

00:40:01.072 --> 00:40:03.745
 SUIT AGAINST ANTONIO.  
SPEAKER:  THAT'S CORRECT YOUR 

00:40:04.079 --> 00:40:10.083
HONOR, HE WAS THE GUARANTOR OF 
THE LOAN AND WAS THE RECIPIENT 

00:40:10.877 --> 00:40:12.645
FOR THE UNDER LYING MONEY FOR 
THIS AGREEMENT.  

00:40:12.646 --> 00:40:20.536
SPEAKER:  EVEN THOUGH YOU KNEW 
FAIR WELL THAT BESANIO COULD PAY

00:40:21.113 --> 00:40:24.511
 BACK THE LOAN AND THEN THERE 
WOULD BE NO CLAIM AGAINST 

00:40:24.854 --> 00:40:26.854
SHYLOCK.  
SPEAKER:  YOU'RE CORRECT, YOUR 

00:40:27.376 --> 00:40:32.274
HONOR.  WE CHOSE THE DEFENDANT 
AND WE DIDN'T SUE BESANIO.  

00:40:32.275 --> 00:40:35.218
SPEAKER:  COUNSEL, WHY IS IT 
THAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR THE MONEY

00:40:35.411 --> 00:40:38.529
 NOW WHEN YOU WERE OFFERED THE 
MONEY AT TRIAL AND

00:40:44.399 --> 00:40:50.896
 REFUSED IT?  
SPEAKER:  WELL OUR POSITION HAS 

00:40:51.586 --> 00:40:53.586
CHANGED YOUR HONOR.  

00:40:56.174 --> 00:40:58.174
[LAUGHTER].
AT TRIAL WE WERE REQUESTING 

00:40:58.462 --> 00:41:01.275
SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE AND IT 
WASN'T GIVEN TO US.  AND WE THEN

00:41:01.737 --> 00:41:06.301
 ASKED FOR THE MONEY AND WE WERE
 TOLD THAT THAT WAS IMPOSSIBLE. 

00:41:07.539 --> 00:41:13.404
IN A WAY THAT, AS I BELIEVE THE 
COURT WILL REALIZE, IS TOTALLY 

00:41:13.864 --> 00:41:17.320
IMPROPER.  SHE INTERPRETED THE 
AGREEMENT TO ALLOW A POUND OF 

00:41:17.321 --> 00:41:21.873
FLESH BUT TO ALLOW NO BLOOD AND 
ABSOLUTELY NO MORE OR LESS THAN 

00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:27.161
A POUND OF FLESH.  SO SHE 
INTERPRETED THE AGREEMENT IN A 

00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:31.707
WAY THAT IT COULDN'T BE 
PERFORMED.  

00:41:31.708 --> 00:41:34.896
SPEAKER:  MR. KLOTZ, WHAT ROLE 
DO YOU THINK PORSHA'S DECEPTION 

00:41:36.529 --> 00:41:42.596
PLAYS IN THIS PROCEEDING?  
SPEAKER:  PORSHA'S DECEPTION IS 

00:41:45.062 --> 00:41:47.666
EGREGIOUSEGREGIOUS.  SHE IS NOT 
AN ATTORNEY.  SHE IS NOT A 

00:41:47.667 --> 00:41:51.376
JUDGE.  
SHE IS NOT A PART OF ANY COURT. 

00:41:51.377 --> 00:41:55.569
SHE OBVIOUSLY MISREPRESENTED WHO
 SHE WAS AND I THINK PERHAPS 

00:41:55.570 --> 00:42:02.741
MOST SIGNIFICANTLY, SHE WAS 
MARRIED TO BESANIO WHO JUSTICE 

00:42:04.799 --> 00:42:09.487
GINSBURG POINTED OUT WAS ON THE 
LOAN AND HAD FINANCIAL INTEREST 

00:42:09.488 --> 00:42:11.488
IN THE OUTCOME.  
SPEAKER:  AND WHAT SPECIFIC 

00:42:14.493 --> 00:42:16.876
DEFENSE DOES THAT GIVE YOUR 
CLIENT?  

00:42:16.877 --> 00:42:19.746
SPEAKER:  WELL I MEAN IF SHE WAS
 ACTUALLY A JUDGE, SHE SHOULD 

00:42:20.414 --> 00:42:24.698
HAVE REFUSED HERSELF AND BECAUSE
 SHE WAS NOT A JUDGE, THE 

00:42:24.699 --> 00:42:30.192
JUDGMENT IS COMPLETELY VOID.  
AND INVALID.  

00:42:30.193 --> 00:42:33.739
SPEAKER:  DID YOU NEED A 
DEFENSE?  YOU'RE THE PLAINTIFF 

00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:39.626
IN THIS SUIT?  SHYLOCK IS THE 
PLAINTIFF SUING ANTONIO.  

00:42:39.627 --> 00:42:43.013
SPEAKER:  CORRECT.  CORRECT.  
SPEAKER:  AND THE ROLE OF 

00:42:43.148 --> 00:42:48.792
REVENGE, SHYLOCK IS REPEATING 
THAT IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS SO 

00:42:49.139 --> 00:42:54.462
THAT HE WAS REVENGED AND 
CONNECTED TO HIS INTENT.  SO HIS

00:42:54.463 --> 00:43:00.097
 INTENT WAS FOR A VERY 
FATALISTIC ENDING FOR ANTONIO.  

00:43:00.098 --> 00:43:07.411
HOW DO YOU FIT THAT INTO SAYING 
THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO DEFEND 

00:43:08.490 --> 00:43:10.147
SHYLOCK?  
SPEAKER:  SHYLOCK HAS BEEN 

00:43:10.148 --> 00:43:13.479
MISUNDERSTOOD AND THE POINT OF 
REVENGE, IT'S TRUE THAT -- IT'S 

00:43:13.891 --> 00:43:19.868
TRUE THAT MY CLIENT AND ANTONIO 
WERE NOT THE BEST OF FRIENDS.  

00:43:20.155 --> 00:43:25.345
BUT HE HAD TWO OTHER MOTIVES IN 
PURSUING THE PENALTY PROVISION. 

00:43:26.099 --> 00:43:30.438
AND HE MADE THAT VERY CLEAR 
DURING THE PROCEEDING.  AND ONE 

00:43:30.439 --> 00:43:32.694
OF THOSE POINTS THAT HE WAS 
SEEKING IS TO

00:43:37.829 --> 00:43:41.946
 FINALLY HAVE THE CHANCE UNDER 
THE LAW.  IT PUNISHES 

00:43:42.584 --> 00:43:46.353
NON-CITIZENS IN A DISTANT 
MANNER.  AS WE HEARD ALREADY, 

00:43:46.354 --> 00:43:50.301
JEWISH CITIZENS WERE FORCED TO 
LIVE IN THE GHETTO, THEY HAD A 

00:43:50.302 --> 00:43:53.267
CURFEW AND CAN ONLY TAKE CERTAIN
 OCCUPATIONS AND ACTUALLY HAD TO

00:43:53.566 --> 00:44:00.371
 PAY TO HAVE THE GHETTO PATROL. 
 BUT AS THE COURT IS AWARE, 

00:44:00.372 --> 00:44:03.524
FREEDOM OF CONTRACT IS ONE OF 
THE GREAT THINGS THAT WHATEVER 

00:44:03.525 --> 00:44:06.674
THE GENERALLY APPLICABLE LAW IS,
 TWO PEOPLE CAN SIT DOWN AND 

00:44:06.845 --> 00:44:09.831
AGREE, THIS IS WHAT YOU WILL DO,
 THIS IS WHAT I WILL DO AND THEY

00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:14.628
 MAKE THEIR OWN LAW ESSENTIALLY.
  SO MY CLIENT WAS VERY ANGRY 

00:44:14.629 --> 00:44:18.715
AND VERY UPSET WHERE IN THIS ONE
 ASPECT OF HIS LIFE THAT HE 

00:44:18.716 --> 00:44:24.860
COULD CONTROL, HIS RIGHTS WERE 
NOT BEING RECOGNIZED.  

00:44:24.861 --> 00:44:30.753
SPEAKER:  WE HEARD THAT SHYLOCK 
WAS IN A STATE OF EXTREME 

00:44:30.997 --> 00:44:40.439
DISTRESS.  ARE YOU MAKING ANY 
PLEAS THAT HE WOULD BE 

00:44:40.796 --> 00:44:42.796
INCOMPETENT TO HAVE BEEN

00:44:47.419 --> 00:44:53.127
 ACCUSED OF A CRIMINAL ACTION 
BECAUSE HE WAS SO DISTRAUGHT AT 

00:44:53.128 --> 00:44:57.418
HIS DAUGHTER AND STEP OF THE 
WORDILY GOODS.  

00:44:57.419 --> 00:45:00.267
SPEAKER:  YOUR HONOR WE ARE NOT 
ARGUING THAT SHYLOCK WAS 

00:45:03.111 --> 00:45:05.382
INCOMPETENTINCOMPETENT.  WE ARE 
ARGUING THAT FIRST OF ALL HE 

00:45:05.383 --> 00:45:08.338
DIDN'T HAVE AN INTEND TO MURDER 
ANTONIO.  

00:45:08.339 --> 00:45:11.516
HIS INTENT WAS TO REBEL AGAINST 
THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT HE FOUND 

00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:14.380
HIMSELF IN AND ON THE SECOND 
POINT THAT EVEN IF THE COURT 

00:45:14.552 --> 00:45:18.233
WERE SOMEHOW TO FIND THAT HE HAD
 AN INTENT TO MURDER, THERE IS 

00:45:18.234 --> 00:45:20.234
NO ACT.  THERE IS NO ACT OF

00:45:23.136 --> 00:45:25.136
 ACTUALLY DOING ANYTHING.  HE 
CAN'T BE CONVICTED

00:45:29.126 --> 00:45:31.521
 FOR MURDEROUS WORDS ANY MORE 
THAN ANYONE ELSE COULD SAYING I 

00:45:31.522 --> 00:45:36.082
WANT TO DO THIS. 
HIS SITUATION, YOUR HONOR, WOULD

00:45:36.939 --> 00:45:39.762
 BE COMPARABLE TO A MURDER TRIAL
 WHERE THE PARENT COMES IN TO 

00:45:39.763 --> 00:45:43.157
THE COURT AND SAYS THIS MAN 
SHOULD BE EXECUTED AND THIS 

00:45:43.158 --> 00:45:46.076
PERSON IS ARRESTED FOR MURDER.  
THAT WOULD BE A RELATIVELY 

00:45:46.077 --> 00:45:47.969
SIMILAR SITUATION. 
&gt;&gt; YOU STARTED OUT WITH THE 

00:45:47.970 --> 00:45:51.770
POINT THAT HE COULDN'T BE TRIED 
FOR MURDER WHEN ALL HE NEEDED TO

00:45:51.771 --> 00:46:00.060
 DO WAS BRING A CIVIL SUIT TO 
ENFORCE A CONTRACT.  

00:46:00.061 --> 00:46:02.061
SPEAKER:  YES, YOUR HONOR.  

00:46:05.113 --> 00:46:09.363
[LAUGHTER].  NO.  I THINK BOTH 
THINGS ARE TRUE.  I THINK THAT 

00:46:11.345 --> 00:46:17.839
IT'S TOTALLY INAPPROPRIATE THAT 
ANY REQUEST OF A COURT COULD BE 

00:46:18.383 --> 00:46:21.942
A CRIMINAL ACT.  SO FOR THAT 
REASON, I DON'T THINK IT'S 

00:46:22.197 --> 00:46:24.465
POSSIBLE TO CONVICT HIM UNDER 
THE ALIEN ACT.  I DON'T THINK 

00:46:25.318 --> 00:46:29.176
THERE IS ANY WAY THAT THIS COULD
 BE ATTEMPTED MURDER AND 

00:46:29.986 --> 00:46:32.031
SEPARATELY AND NOT IN A 
CONSISTENT POINT, HE DIDN'T DO 

00:46:32.032 --> 00:46:34.032
ANYTHING.  DURING THE SCENE HE

00:46:36.474 --> 00:46:41.884
 HAD A KNIFE.  AND HE SAID SOME 
WORDS THAT HE MAY 

00:46:46.674 --> 00:46:48.386
REGRET.  AND NOTHING ELSE 
HAPPENED.  

00:46:48.387 --> 00:46:51.438
SPEAKER:  BUT THE QUESTION OF 
MOTIVE IS IMPORTANT TO US.  IT'S

00:46:51.713 --> 00:46:55.632
 IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF THINKING 
WHAT SHYLOCK DID AND HOW WE 

00:46:55.633 --> 00:47:00.029
SHOULD RULE HERE.  I MEAN, ONE 
MOTIVE IS REVENGE WHICH 

00:47:00.202 --> 00:47:02.429
OBVIOUSLY WOULD BE CAUGHT UP 
WITH THE MURDER AND YOU MAKE AN 

00:47:02.868 --> 00:47:07.072
ARGUMENT IN YOUR BRIEF THAT YOU 
JUST MENTIONED A MINUTE AGO THAT

00:47:07.073 --> 00:47:11.597
 SHYLOCK WAS IN FACT IN A SENSE,
 REBELLING THROUGH THIS 

00:47:11.750 --> 00:47:13.750
CONTRACT.
I'M NOT SURE I REALLY UNDERSTAND

00:47:13.764 --> 00:47:17.548
 WHAT YOU MEAN BY THAT.  MAYBE 
CAN YOU ELABORATE A LITTLE BIT 

00:47:17.898 --> 00:47:22.259
ON THAT FOR US.  WHAT DO YOU 
MEAN?  WHAT WAS SHYLOCK DOING 

00:47:22.907 --> 00:47:27.676
HERE IF IT WASN'T REVENGE?  
SPEAKER:  YES, YOUR HONOR.  THE 

00:47:28.639 --> 00:47:32.933
INTENT TO ENFORCE THE PENALTY 
PROVISION WAS A REBELLION 

00:47:33.347 --> 00:47:37.769
AGAINST THE VENETIAN LAWS THAT 
TREATED HIM SO DIFFERENTLY AND 

00:47:38.083 --> 00:47:40.797
THIS WAS THE ONE AREA WHERE HE 
WAS ABLE TO SORT OF SET THE 

00:47:40.798 --> 00:47:43.447
TERMS OF HIS LIFE.  AND THE 
OTHER PART OF THIS IS DURING THE

00:47:44.059 --> 00:47:47.832
 PROCEEDING, WHAT SHYLOCK POINTS
 OUT ABOUT ANTONIO AND THE OTHER

00:47:47.833 --> 00:47:55.453
 VENETIAN MERCHANTS IS THE 
INCREDIBLE HYPOCRISY.  VENETIAN 

00:47:55.870 --> 00:47:58.481
CAPITALISM, THERE IS TRADE IN 
MANY THINGS.  BUT ONE OF THE 

00:47:58.874 --> 00:48:06.760
ASPECTS OF TRADE WAS SLAVERY.  
AND SO IT SEEMS VERY CRITICAL 

00:48:07.128 --> 00:48:11.580
AND IMPROPER THAT MERCHANTS LIKE
 ANTONIO SHOULD BE ABLE TO GROW 

00:48:12.106 --> 00:48:15.977
WEALTHY SELLING PEOPLE AGAINST 
THEIR WILL AND MY CLIENT SHOULD 

00:48:15.978 --> 00:48:18.488
NOT BE ABLE TO RECOVER THE 
PENALTY PROVISION, EVEN THOUGH 

00:48:18.632 --> 00:48:22.368
THERE IS, YOU KNOW, THERE IS A 
PHYSICAL COMPONENT TO IT. 

00:48:30.273 --> 00:48:34.289
SPEAKER:  AS I UNDERSTAND IT, IT
 WAS A CONTRACT.  THEY ACTUALLY 

00:48:35.243 --> 00:48:38.651
MADE A LEGAL CONTRACT, EVEN 
THOUGH SHYLOCK SAID SOMETHING 

00:48:38.971 --> 00:48:41.353
ABOUT BEING A MARRIED JOKE OR 
SOMETHING, WHICH MEANT THAT THEY

00:48:41.354 --> 00:48:43.354
 FULLY

00:48:44.356 --> 00:48:49.684
 EXPECTED THE MONEY WOULD BE 
RETURNED ON TIME.  AND THEN HE 

00:48:49.685 --> 00:48:52.039
PERCENT PERSEVERED TO THE POWER 
OF FLESH AND THEN HE FINDS OUT 

00:48:52.040 --> 00:48:57.655
ABOUT THE BLOOD, YOU KNOW, DO 
YOU THINK IT COULD BE DONE IN 

00:48:57.656 --> 00:49:05.456
SOME OTHER WAY SO THAT ANTONIO 
WOULD NOT DIE?  WHAT DID YOU 

00:49:05.457 --> 00:49:07.457
FIND OUT IN YOUR

00:49:11.857 --> 00:49:16.680
 INVESTIGATION OF THIS CASE?  OF
 WHAT HE HAD IN MIND.  

00:49:16.681 --> 00:49:19.303
SPEAKER:  SHYLOCK DID NOT INTEND
 TO MURDER ANTONIO.  IT WAS A 

00:49:19.502 --> 00:49:23.854
POUND OF FLESH.  IT WAS NOT A 
DAGGER IN THE HEART OR ANYTHING 

00:49:23.855 --> 00:49:26.829
LIKE THAT.  
SPEAKER:  HE WANTED IT NEAR THE 

00:49:27.134 --> 00:49:29.383
HEART?  
SPEAKER:  YEAH, HE WANTED IT 

00:49:31.126 --> 00:49:34.762
NEAR THE HEART, BUT THE COURT 
DOESN'T KNOW ANY MORE THAN I DO 

00:49:35.047 --> 00:49:41.802
IF HE HAD BEEN GRANTED THAT.  IF
 PORSHA HAD GRANTED HIM THAT 

00:49:41.803 --> 00:49:45.157
RIGHT AND DIDN'T FORCE THAT 
SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE, HE MIGHT 

00:49:45.158 --> 00:49:47.956
HAVE DROPPED THE KNIFE AND ASKED
 FOR THE MONEY INSTEAD.  THERE 

00:49:47.957 --> 00:49:50.875
IS NO WAY TO KNOW AT THIS POINT.

00:49:50.876 --> 00:49:55.581
SPEAKER:  ANY CASE, WE HAVE 
SETTLED THE POUND OF FLESH IS 

00:49:55.785 --> 00:49:58.756
OUT OF THE CASE NOW.  IT'S JUST 
A MATTER OF MONEY.  

00:49:58.757 --> 00:50:05.033
SPEAKER:  YES, YOUR HONOR.  
WE'RE NOT SEEKING THE POUND OF 

00:50:05.205 --> 00:50:08.938
FLESH.  AND AFTER ALL THIS TIME 
WE'RE NOT COMING TO HAVE THAT BE

00:50:08.939 --> 00:50:11.173
 ENFORCED.  
SPEAKER:  BUT MR. KLOTZ IF 

00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:14.849
YOU'RE JUST FOCUSING ON THE 
CIVIL ACTION AND NOT SEEKING THE

00:50:14.850 --> 00:50:19.602
 POUND OF FLESH, YOU'RE SEEKING 
THE REPAYMENT OF THE MONEY PLUS

00:50:23.049 --> 00:50:26.854
 INTEREST, ISN'T THIS A CLAIM 
NOT RAISED BELOW?  THIS ISN'T 

00:50:27.408 --> 00:50:30.019
APPELLATE COURT.  DID YOU RAISE 
THIS CLAIM BELOW? 

00:50:37.582 --> 00:50:39.582
 [LAUGHTER].  
SPEAKER:  THAT'S A GREAT 

00:50:40.388 --> 00:50:42.388
QUESTION YOUR HONOR.  
SPEAKER:  THANK YOU. 

00:50:48.149 --> 00:50:50.855
SPEAKER:  I TAKE IT YOU'RE 
SEEKING A SUBSTITUTIONAL REMEDY 

00:50:51.221 --> 00:50:55.013
SINCE THE ONE YOU ASKED FOR, THE
 LAW DOES NOT PERMIT.  

00:50:55.014 --> 00:50:59.381
SPEAKER:  WELL, WHAT I THINK 
YOUR HONOR IS -- I MEAN THE 

00:50:59.788 --> 00:51:02.637
PROCEEDING IS OBVIOUSLY TOTAL 
IMPROPER WITH PORSHA ACTING AS 

00:51:03.096 --> 00:51:06.579
THE JUDGE.  THE OTHER MAIN POINT
 THAT WE HAVEN'T DISCUSSED YET 

00:51:07.125 --> 00:51:10.949
BUT IS DISCUSSED IN THE BRIEF IS
 THE INCREDIBLE DURESS FROM MY 

00:51:10.950 --> 00:51:14.466
CLIENT DURING THE PROCEEDING.  
FIRST PORSHA SAYS YOU KNOW, YOU 

00:51:14.736 --> 00:51:18.311
CAN GET THE POUND OF FLESH AND 
YOU DON'T GET BLOOD AND DON'T 

00:51:19.375 --> 00:51:22.748
GET ANY MORE OR LESS THAN THAT. 
AND SHYLOCK HAS BEEN ASKED FOR 

00:51:22.889 --> 00:51:28.774
THE MONEY AND BEEN TOLD NO AND 
PORSHA THEN SAID HE VIOLATED THE

00:51:29.055 --> 00:51:32.412
 ACT SUPPOSEDLY FOR MAKING THE 
REQUEST TO COURT.  AND THEN 

00:51:32.554 --> 00:51:37.489
SHYLOCK WAS FORCED TO CONVERT TO
 CHRISTIANITY AND THE DUKE SAID 

00:51:37.635 --> 00:51:39.635
VERY 

00:51:41.222 --> 00:51:46.850
CLEARLY, IF HE DIDN'T DO THAT, 
HE WOULD BE EXECUTED.  TO THE 

00:51:46.851 --> 00:51:50.114
EXTENT THAT THERE IS A LABOR 
ARGUMENT, I THINK

00:51:56.494 --> 00:52:02.018
 WE CAN LET THAT SLIDE.  BUT WE 
ASK -- WE'RE ASKING THIS COURT 

00:52:02.019 --> 00:52:09.012
-- TO FOLLOW-UP ON YOUR POINT, 
THE CIVIL REMEDIES, WE'RE ASKING

00:52:09.013 --> 00:52:11.682
 TO HAVE MY CLIENT'S NAME 
CLEARED AFTER ALL OF THIS TIME. 

00:52:11.872 --> 00:52:15.197
 THERE IS NOTHING THAT, YOU 
KNOW, NOTHING THAT WE CAN DO 

00:52:15.198 --> 00:52:20.690
ABOUT THIS IMPROPER VERDICT, 
OTHER THAN TO, YOU KNOW, 

00:52:20.691 --> 00:52:23.890
COMPLETELY NULLIFY HIM.  
SPEAKER:  YOU MADE A COMMENT 

00:52:25.311 --> 00:52:27.848
ABOUT THE ALIEN ACT.  ARE YOU 
ARGUING THAT THE ALIEN ACT IN 

00:52:28.311 --> 00:52:31.929
AND OF ITSELF, MAYBE YOU CAN 
EXPLAIN WHY THAT IS, ARE YOU 

00:52:32.309 --> 00:52:34.309
ARGUING THAT THAT IS SOMEHOW

00:52:38.558 --> 00:52:47.515
  NOT LEGITIMATE OR SOMEHOW 
APPLIED WRONG TO SHYLOCK?  

00:52:47.516 --> 00:52:49.211
SPEAKER:  IT'S TOTALLY 
LEGITIMATE.  FOR A CERTAIN GROUP

00:52:49.212 --> 00:52:54.386
 OF PEOPLE, IT PROTECTS VENETIAN
 CITIZENS IN A WAY THAT 

00:52:56.169 --> 00:52:59.768
NON-CITIZENS WOULD BE PROTECTED.
IF SOMEONE HAD MADE AN ATTEMPT 

00:52:59.954 --> 00:53:03.354
TO MURDER MY CLIENT SHYLOCK, 
THAT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN IN 

00:53:03.545 --> 00:53:06.355
VIOLATION AND NOTHING WOULD HAVE
 HAPPENED WHAT SO EVER.  AND 

00:53:06.356 --> 00:53:09.806
JUST TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE FROM OUR
 CASE, THE DUKE SAYING, SHYLOCK,

00:53:10.040 --> 00:53:14.430
 IF YOU DON'T CONVERT TO 
CHRISTIANITY, I'M GOING TO 

00:53:15.103 --> 00:53:18.876
EXECUTE YOU, YOU KNOW, THAT IS 
CONCERNING.  

00:53:18.877 --> 00:53:23.076
SPEAKER:  BUT DID YOU CONSIDER 
THAT THE ONLY CHANCE THAT 

00:53:23.603 --> 00:53:29.317
SHYLOCK HAD WAS SALVATION, SO 
FAR FROM BEING A PENALTY, IT WAS

00:53:30.278 --> 00:53:35.509
 A TREMENDOUS ADVANTAGE TO 
SHYLOCK TO BE CONVERTED TO A 

00:53:35.859 --> 00:53:37.859
CHRISTIAN, SO THEN HIS

00:53:44.801 --> 00:53:48.960
 SOUL CAN BE SAVED.  [LAUGHTER].

00:53:48.961 --> 00:53:50.961
SPEAKER:  YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY 
CORRECT, YOUR HONOR.  I THINK 

00:53:51.123 --> 00:53:54.063
THAT IS WHAT HE BELIEVES.  
SPEAKER:  IN OTHER WORDS THE 

00:53:54.064 --> 00:54:02.158
DUKE WAS ACTING MERCIFULLY AND 
SHYLOCK WHO PORSHA BEGGED TO

00:54:04.110 --> 00:54:08.259
 ACT MERCIFULLY NEVER DID.  
SHYLOCK REFUSED, UP UNTIL THE 

00:54:08.260 --> 00:54:16.375
LAST MINUTE, TO RENOUNCE THE 
POUND OF FLESH.  

00:54:16.376 --> 00:54:20.319
SPEAKER:  WE CAN'T DISPUTE, YOUR
 HONOR, THAT SHYLOCK DIDN'T ACT 

00:54:21.173 --> 00:54:24.244
WITH ALL OF THE MERCY THAT HE 
COULD HAVE IN THIS PROCEEDING.  

00:54:24.394 --> 00:54:28.247
BUT I BELIEVE THAT THE FACTORS 
THAT WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT, YOU 

00:54:28.799 --> 00:54:33.188
KNOW, THE TREATMENT THAT HE 
EXPERIENCED, HIS VIEW THAT IF HE

00:54:33.673 --> 00:54:36.561
 DOESN'T HAVE HIS RIGHTS UNDER 
THE CONTRACT, WHAT RIGHTS DOES 

00:54:37.165 --> 00:54:42.279
HE HAVE?  HE IS ALREADY TREATED 
IN THIS TOTALLY UNFAIR AND 

00:54:42.679 --> 00:54:51.425
DESPERATE WAY.  AND YOU KNOW, 
THE AUDACITY OF ANTONIO TO ACT 

00:54:51.426 --> 00:54:55.152
AS IF THIS PENALTY PROVISION 
THAT THEY HAD AGREED UPON AND 

00:54:55.443 --> 00:55:02.373
NEGOTIATED AND REDUCED TO 
WRITING WAS SOMEHOW AN OUTRAGE 

00:55:02.858 --> 00:55:05.823
AND SHYLOCK WAS BEYOND THE PAIL 
TRYING TO ENFORCE THE TERMS THAT

00:55:05.824 --> 00:55:11.178
 THEY AGREED ON.  
SPEAKER:  DID YOU SAY HE DID NOT

00:55:11.179 --> 00:55:13.179
 VIOLATE THE ALIEN RULE BECAUSE 

00:55:16.332 --> 00:55:19.622
HE DIDN'T ACTUALLY PERFORM 
ANYTHING AGAINST ANTONIO, EVEN 

00:55:20.081 --> 00:55:22.724
THOUGH HE MAY HAVE WANTED TO?  
SPEAKER:  THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT, 

00:55:23.474 --> 00:55:26.570
YOUR HONOR.  
SPEAKER:  OKAY.  YOUR TIME IS 

00:55:26.896 --> 00:55:30.761
ALMOST UP.  DO YOU WANT TO JUST 
QUICKLY SUM UP?  

00:55:30.762 --> 00:55:35.089
SPEAKER:  YES, YOUR HONOR TO 
REITERATE, WE ASK THE COURT TO, 

00:55:35.451 --> 00:55:41.030
ONCE AND FOR ALL, VACATE THE 
DECISION BELOW WITHOUT THE NEED 

00:55:41.031 --> 00:55:47.507
FOR RETRIAL FOR MY CLIENT AND 
THE 3 THOUSAND IN DUCKETS BE 

00:55:48.693 --> 00:55:52.021
RETURNED IN FULL AND HE BE 
AWARDED INTEREST IN THIS MONEY 

00:55:53.010 --> 00:55:55.340
AND THE COURT AWARDS FURTHER 
RELIEF THAT YOU THINK IS 

00:55:55.516 --> 00:55:58.473
APPROPRIATE, PARTICULARLY IN 
LIGHT THAT HE AND OTHER JEWISH 

00:55:59.401 --> 00:56:02.899
RESIDENTS IN VENICE SUFFERED.  
SPEAKER:  THANK YOU, 

00:56:07.956 --> 00:56:09.956
COUNSEL.  

00:56:12.857 --> 00:56:13.248
SPEAKER:  THANK YOU.  
[APPLAUSE]. 

00:56:13.249 --> 00:56:16.789
SPEAKER:  WE WILL NOW HEAR FROM 
COUNSEL FOR THE MERCHANT OF 

00:56:18.043 --> 00:56:22.139
VENICE, ANTONIO AND THE REPUBLIC
 OF VENICE.  

00:56:22.140 --> 00:56:26.850
SPEAKER:  THANK YOU YOUR HONOR. 
I WANT TO BEGIN BY REJECTING THE

00:56:27.589 --> 00:56:29.610
 TRANSPARENTLY FALSE NARRATIVE 
THAT WE HAVE BEEN PRESENTED WITH

00:56:30.648 --> 00:56:32.664
 HERE.  THE NOTION THAT SHYLOCK 

00:56:36.470 --> 00:56:40.075
WAS ENGAGED SIMPLY IN A NOBLE 
AND HONORABLE PROTEST OF WHAT HE

00:56:40.076 --> 00:56:44.251
 THOUGHT TO BE THE DEFICIENCIES 
AND UNFAIRNESS OF VENETIAN LAW. 

00:56:44.581 --> 00:56:46.581
THAT IS

00:56:50.742 --> 00:56:54.681
 SIMPLY NOT TRUE.  AND NEVER 
UNTIL THIS APPEAL HAVE WE HEARD 

00:56:54.682 --> 00:56:58.533
THAT TRUE.  IF WE LOOK AT THE 
CASE, AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN,

00:56:59.548 --> 00:57:01.713
 IT SHOWS THAT SHYLOCK ENTERED 
INTO A PREMEDITATED

00:57:05.340 --> 00:57:12.318
 AND DECEITFUL COURSE OF ACTION 
IN ORDER TO LURE ANTONIO INTO 

00:57:12.676 --> 00:57:16.092
HEALING A BOND THAT WOULD BE THE
 MEANS OF HIS OWN DESTRUCTION 

00:57:16.093 --> 00:57:20.604
AND THERE ARE FOUR CRITICAL 
ELEMENTS IN THIS SCHEME THAT ARE

00:57:20.605 --> 00:57:23.178
 UNDISPUTED IN THE RECORD OF THE
 CASE.  FIRST THROUGHOUT SHYLOCK

00:57:23.571 --> 00:57:27.028
 ADMITTED TO HIS MOTIVES, EVEN 
BEFORE HE NEGOTIATED THE PENALTY

00:57:28.353 --> 00:57:33.751
 BOND, HE WAS OVER HER TO SAY 
QUOTE, SPEAKING OF ANTONIO, I 

00:57:33.912 --> 00:57:38.331
HATE HIM.  FOR HE IS A 
CHRISTIAN.  IF I CAN CATCH HIM 

00:57:38.495 --> 00:57:43.293
ONCE ON THE HIP, I WILL FEED FAT
 THE ANCIENT GRUDGE I BEAR HIM. 

00:57:50.274 --> 00:57:54.487
HIMSELF A FEW MINUTES AGO SAY 
THAT THE POUND OF FLESH WILL BE 

00:57:54.488 --> 00:57:59.649
ABLE TO STATE DISH WITH ALL.  
AND FURTHER USE THAT POUND OF 

00:57:59.874 --> 00:58:04.850
FLESH TO FEED HIS REVENGE.  
OTHER EVIDENCE OF THE MOTIVE OF 

00:58:07.674 --> 00:58:10.535
REVENGE AND HATRED THROUGHOUT 
THE RECORD OF THIS CASE.  BUT IF

00:58:10.536 --> 00:58:14.400
 THERE ARE ANY DOUBTS, IT WOULD 
HAVE BEEN SATISFIED WHEN AT HIS 

00:58:14.813 --> 00:58:18.768
TRIAL IN RESPONSE TO QUESTIONS 
BY THE DUKE, HE EXPLAINED THAT 

00:58:19.812 --> 00:58:28.414
HIS MOTIVE WAS A QUOTE LOGIC 
HATE AND UNCERTAIN LOATHING.  

00:58:28.618 --> 00:58:30.290
END QUOTE.  
SPEAKER:  COUNSEL, BEFORE WE GET

00:58:30.291 --> 00:58:33.859
 INTO YOUR DISCUSSION OF THE 
MERITS OF A CRIMINAL 

00:58:34.196 --> 00:58:38.214
PROSECUTION, I THINK YOU 
CONCEDED AT THE OUTSET THAT THAT

00:58:38.215 --> 00:58:43.565
 TURN OF THE PROCEEDING FROM A 
CIVIL SUIT TO ENFORCE A 

00:58:44.004 --> 00:58:49.005
CONTRACT, INTO A CRIMINAL CASE, 
WAS HIGHLY INAPPROPRIATE.  DID 

00:58:49.376 --> 00:58:52.109
YOU NOT MAKE THAT CONCESSION IN 
YOUR BRIEF?  

00:58:52.110 --> 00:58:54.755
SPEAKER:  I THINK WE HAVE TWO 
RESPONSES TO THAT, YOUR HONOR.  

00:58:56.017 --> 00:59:00.990
THE FIRST IS THAT ANTONIO WAS 
PERMITTED TO USE AS A 

00:59:02.283 --> 00:59:06.159
COUNTERCLAIM, OR AS A DEFENSE.  
ANY LAW THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE.

00:59:06.956 --> 00:59:09.965
SPEAKER:  CAN YOU BRING IN A 
CIVIL CASE?  A CRIMINAL 

00:59:10.224 --> 00:59:12.224
PROSECUTION AS A 

00:59:14.703 --> 00:59:16.209
COUNTERCLAIM?  
SPEAKER:  ABSOLUTELY.  

00:59:16.210 --> 00:59:19.157
SPEAKER:  ABSOLUTELY.  UNDER THE
 LAW OF VENICE AT THAT TIME, 

00:59:19.158 --> 00:59:22.163
THIS KIND OF PLEADING IS 
RECOGNIZED. 

00:59:22.164 --> 00:59:25.530
AS WE ARGUE IN THE BRIEF YOUR 
HONOR, WE HAVE AN ADDITIONAL 

00:59:25.745 --> 00:59:30.186
POINT.  AND THAT IS, WE DO AGREE
 ON ONE POINT WITH SHYLOCK.  AND

00:59:30.187 --> 00:59:35.683
 THAT IS THAT THE PROCEDURES 
WERE FLAWED BY REASON OF 

00:59:35.684 --> 00:59:43.180
PORSHA'S MISREPRESENTATION AND 
MASCERADE AND FOR THIS REASON WE

00:59:43.626 --> 00:59:47.999
 ASK THE COURT TO CONSIDER THIS 
CASE DE NOVA.  

00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:50.000
SPEAKER:  WELL,

00:59:54.607 --> 00:59:57.087
 JUDGE REMINDED US THAT THIS IS 
A COURT OF 

01:00:00.269 --> 01:00:02.751
VIEW.
NOT FIRST VIEW.  WE WOULD BE 

01:00:02.945 --> 01:00:09.214
LOOK AT A CASE.  BUT WE ARE AN 
APPELLANT FOR THEM.  SO WE HAVE 

01:00:09.490 --> 01:00:12.559
NO AUTHORITY TO HEAR WITNESSES. 
AND WE JUDGE THE CASE

01:00:16.599 --> 01:00:19.104
 ACCORDING TO THE LAW.  SO I 
DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW YOU CAN ASK

01:00:19.932 --> 01:00:25.748
 THIS COURT TO SERVE AS A FIRST 
INSTANCE.  DE NOVO COURT.  

01:00:25.749 --> 01:00:27.749
SPEAKER:  EVEN THIS COURT SHOULD
 DECLINE TO CONSIDER THE

01:00:30.934 --> 01:00:34.133
 CASE ENTIRELY NEW, THE 
OPPORTUNITY OF REPRESENTATION BY

01:00:34.503 --> 01:00:38.190
 VARIABLE COUNSEL AND THE 
OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE ALL OF HIS 

01:00:38.191 --> 01:00:43.016
ARGUMENTS ENSURES THAT SHYLOCK 
NOW HAS THE RIGHT TO ARGUE 

01:00:43.017 --> 01:00:47.457
AGAINST THE APPLICATION OF THE 
ALIEN LAW TO HIM.  

01:00:47.458 --> 01:00:55.129
SPEAKER:  AND WITH THE 
PROCEEDING, IS IMPROPER.  THEN I

01:00:55.130 --> 01:00:59.978
 SUPPOSE THE APPELLATE COURT 
SHOULD JUST DISMISS IT, AND IF 

01:01:01.152 --> 01:01:06.073
IT DISMISSES THE CASE, THEN 
WHERE ARE WE?  

01:01:06.074 --> 01:01:09.399
SPEAKER:  WELL IF THIS COURT 
SIMPLY DISMISSES THE CASE, THEN 

01:01:10.233 --> 01:01:13.180
I THINK IT WOULD PUT ANTONIO AND
 THE DUKE OF VENICE IN THE 

01:01:13.432 --> 01:01:16.346
POSITION THAT THEY WOULD WANT TO
 BE IN.  BECAUSE IT WOULD DENY 

01:01:16.845 --> 01:01:22.614
ANY AND ALL RELIEF TO SHYLOCK.  
SPEAKER:  BUT YOU ARE NOT URGING

01:01:22.808 --> 01:01:25.600
 US TO DO THAT BECAUSE YOU 
RECOGNIZE THAT HE DID NOT GET A 

01:01:26.014 --> 01:01:29.133
FAIR TRIAL, IS THAT IT?  
SPEAKER:  WE GRANT THAT THE 

01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:32.534
PROCEDURES WERE NOT FAIR 
PROCEDURES.  YES.  

01:01:32.535 --> 01:01:36.632
SPEAKER:  LET ME GO TO WHAT 
SEEMS TO BE YOUR PRINCIPLE 

01:01:36.972 --> 01:01:40.410
ARGUMENT, THAT THIS WAS AN ACT 
OF VENGINCE

01:01:44.961 --> 01:01:47.936
 ON SHYLOCK'S PART.  
BUT SHYLOCK, WHEN THE 

01:01:47.937 --> 01:01:57.690
TRANSACTION TOOK PLACE, CALLED 
IT A MERRY SPORT.  A MERRY BOND.

01:01:57.885 --> 01:02:03.974
AND REALLY THE ASPECT OF YOUR 
POSITION THAT IT'S ALL 

01:02:08.622 --> 01:02:13.950
VENE NVENENGANCE AND AT THE 
TIME, WAS ABLE TO THINK THAT 

01:02:13.951 --> 01:02:18.414
RICH MERCHANT OF VENICE WOULD BE
 ABLE TO PAY HIM.  HE HAD NO 

01:02:18.415 --> 01:02:23.386
IDEA OF THE PROPOSED TRAGEDY AT 
SEA.  HE EXPECTED, AS ANTONIO 

01:02:23.706 --> 01:02:27.786
DID, THAT ANTONIO WOULD BE -- 
HIS WEALTH WOULD BE INCREASED, 

01:02:27.787 --> 01:02:32.602
WELL WITHIN THE TIME OF THE 
LOAN.  

01:02:32.603 --> 01:02:36.618
SPEAKER:  I THINK THE RECORD 
SHOWS THAT FROM THE VERY 

01:02:37.302 --> 01:02:39.302
BEGINNING, SHYLOCK WAS SCHEMING 

01:02:45.709 --> 01:02:50.442
TO TRAP ANTONIO.  HE SAID TO 
ANTONIO AT THE TIME THEY WERE 

01:02:50.732 --> 01:02:54.572
DISCUSSING THE BOND, HE WAS 
OFFERING THE LOAN FOR 

01:02:54.769 --> 01:02:57.337
RECONCILIATION AND FRIENDSHIP.  
HE SAID QUOTE I WOULD BE FRIENDS

01:02:58.336 --> 01:03:02.932
 WITH YOU AND HAVE YOUR LOVE TO 
ANTONIO.  AS YOU POINT 

01:03:08.134 --> 01:03:11.152
OUT, HE REFERRED TO THE BOND AS 
A SPORT.

01:03:11.153 --> 01:03:14.222
AND QUICKLY ADDED IT WAS 
WORTHLESS.  NOBODY COULD EXPECT 

01:03:14.223 --> 01:03:17.051
HIM TO EVER CLAIM THE BOND 
BECAUSE A POUND OF MAN'S FLESH 

01:03:17.052 --> 01:03:26.197
TAKEN FROM A MAN IS NOT 
ESTIMATABLE, PROFITABLE EITHER 

01:03:27.996 --> 01:03:30.967
FROM GOATS.  
SPEAKER:  BUT HOW -- WHAT BASES 

01:03:31.633 --> 01:03:33.633
DID SHYLOCK HAVE TO

01:03:39.576 --> 01:03:42.709
 EVEN SUSPECT THAT THIS QUESTION
 WOULD ARRIVE AND THAT ANTONIO 

01:03:42.710 --> 01:03:48.031
WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO REPAY HIM? 
 ANTONIO WAS A RICH MERCHANT?  

01:03:48.032 --> 01:03:54.555
THERE WERE NO STORMS AT SEA.  
WHY WOULD YOU ATTRIBUTE TO 

01:03:54.556 --> 01:03:59.990
SHYLOCK SUCH A MOTIVE OF 
VENGEANCE WHEN SHYLOCK HAD EVERY

01:04:00.499 --> 01:04:03.068
 REASON IN THE WORLD TO EXPECT 
THAT WITHIN THE THREE MONTH'S 

01:04:03.069 --> 01:04:05.069
TIME HE WOULD BE REPAID?
SPEAKER: 

01:04:08.278 --> 01:04:10.278
 HE WAS LAYING A

01:04:12.374 --> 01:04:14.374
 TRAP. 
HE UNDERSTOOD THAT HE WOULD 

01:04:15.319 --> 01:04:18.053
PROBABLY BE REPAID.  AND IF HE 
WERE NOT, THIS WOULD BE HIS 

01:04:19.114 --> 01:04:23.600
OPPORTUNITY FINALLY TO HAVE THE 
REVENGE THAT HE FOUGHT SO 

01:04:24.465 --> 01:04:26.932
DEARLY.  THERE IS A LITTLE 
NOTICED FACT THAT IS SO 

01:04:26.933 --> 01:04:29.776
INTERESTING IN THIS CASE AND 
THAT IS WHEN HE FIRST HEARD

01:04:36.207 --> 01:04:40.249
 ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A
 PENALTY BOND FROM ANTONIO, 

01:04:40.648 --> 01:04:43.639
SHYLOCK DIDN'T HAVE THE MONEY.  
HE DIDN'T HAVE THE MONEY.  WHAT 

01:04:43.865 --> 01:04:48.515
DID HE DO?  HE WENT TO HIS MONEY
 LENDER FRIEND AND BORROWED THE 

01:04:48.772 --> 01:04:52.141
MONEY TO LEND IN ORDER TO GET 
THE PENALTY BOND.  IN OTHER 

01:04:56.607 --> 01:04:58.607
WORDS, HE

01:05:00.197 --> 01:05:04.772
 WAS WILLING TO PAY INTEREST TO 
TUBAL AND LOAN FREE OF CHARGE, 

01:05:04.773 --> 01:05:07.886
FREE OF CHARGE.  AND THAT WAS TO
 SET UP THE TRAP.  

01:05:07.887 --> 01:05:11.145
AND IT SHOWS THROUGHOUT FROM THE
 VERY BEGINNING TO THE VERY END,

01:05:11.570 --> 01:05:13.570
 EVEN THOUGH HE RECOGNIZED THAT 

01:05:18.023 --> 01:05:20.755
HE WOULD PROBABLY BE REPAID, THE
 TRAP COULD BE SET AND

01:05:26.674 --> 01:05:28.674
 HE WOULD HAVE HIS REVENGE.  
SPEAKER:  ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

01:05:28.782 --> 01:05:32.399
 SHYLOCK SAID A FEW TIMES.  I 
CRAVE THE

01:05:39.753 --> 01:05:43.218
 LAW.  NOBODY TOLD HIM ABOUT THE
 ALIEN ACT.  SO OBVIOUS 

01:05:43.219 --> 01:05:48.283
OPPORTUNITY TO RETHINK THE CASE 
IN LIGHT OF THE LAW.  BUT 

01:05:49.056 --> 01:05:51.216
SHYLOCK CRAVED THE LAW, ONCE HE 
SAW WHAT THE LAW IS.  AND HOW 

01:05:53.710 --> 01:05:57.484
THE FLESH IS OFF THE TABLE.  
SPEAKER:  THE POUND OF FLESH IS 

01:05:58.680 --> 01:06:06.006
NOT A VALID PENALTY BOND UNDER 
VENETIAN LAW.  VENETIAN LAW, 

01:06:06.007 --> 01:06:09.646
IT'S TRUE, ENFORCED COMMERCIAL 
CURVES.  THE PENALTY BOND HERE

01:06:13.217 --> 01:06:17.469
 IS NOT A COMMERCIAL TERM.  IN 
FACT SHYLOCK HIMSELF ADMITTED 

01:06:17.802 --> 01:06:22.461
MANY TIMES IT WAS NOT A 
COMMERCIAL TERM WHEN HE SAID 

01:06:22.669 --> 01:06:26.674
THAT HE WOULD GLADLY GIVE UP 
REPAYMENT OF 20 TIMES THE LOAN, 

01:06:27.260 --> 01:06:29.260
IN ORDER TO ENFORCE

01:06:31.511 --> 01:06:35.255
 THE PENALTY BOND.  
SPEAKER:  BUT WHAT ABOUT THE 

01:06:35.646 --> 01:06:39.159
STATE OF MIND OF YOUR CLIENT 
ANTONIO?  WHY DID HE AGREE TO 

01:06:39.356 --> 01:06:41.356
THIS SO QUICKLY?  
SPEAKER:  AND JUST TO FOLLOW-UP 

01:06:41.568 --> 01:06:44.879
ON THAT, I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH 
THAT AS WELL.  IT'S NOT HARD FOR

01:06:45.080 --> 01:06:48.930
 ME TO UNDERSTAND WHY SHYLOCK 
WOULD WANT THIS BOND, WHETHER WE

01:06:49.295 --> 01:06:52.266
 THINK IT WAS REVENGE OR WHETHER
 WE THINK IT WAS POLITICAL 

01:06:52.525 --> 01:06:56.442
EXPRESSION OF SOME SORT.  BUT 
WHY WOULD ANTONIO AGREE TO BE 

01:06:56.801 --> 01:07:01.186
BOUND BY THIS BOND?  WHY WOULD 
HE AGREE TO GIVE UP A POUND OF 

01:07:01.565 --> 01:07:06.321
HIS OWN FLESH JUST TO GET MONEY 
FOR BESANIO AND WHAT I AM 

01:07:06.811 --> 01:07:11.088
THINKING HERE IS REALLY, IS IT 
POSSIBLE THAT ANTONIO WAS THE 

01:07:11.089 --> 01:07:15.779
ONE LAYING THE TRAP FOR SHYLOCK,
 BECAUSE ANTONIO KNEW THAT 

01:07:16.150 --> 01:07:18.150
SHYLOCK WOULD BE

01:07:19.437 --> 01:07:23.542
 HIT WITH THE ALIEN ACT.  
SPEAKER:  WELL THERE IS NO 

01:07:23.543 --> 01:07:27.220
EVIDENCE IN THE RECORD TO 
SUGGEST.  

01:07:27.221 --> 01:07:29.456
SPEAKER:  THERE MAY NOT BE 
REFERENCE IN THE RECORD TO THAT.

01:07:29.745 --> 01:07:36.687
BUT I AM JUST SPECULATING.  
SPEAKER:  MAY I INTERJECT THAT 

01:07:36.688 --> 01:07:41.961
THERE ARE MULTIPLE CLUES IN THE 
RECORD.  WHEN WE FIRST MEET 

01:07:42.690 --> 01:07:44.704
ANTONIO, HE SAYS ENSUED.  I KNOW
 NOT

01:07:49.352 --> 01:07:58.051
 WHY.  I AM SAD.  HE LATER SAYS 
I AM TAINTED WHETHER OF THE 

01:07:58.052 --> 01:08:00.827
FLESH, TAINTED OR DEATH.  THIS 
IS A VERY SAD MAN WHO

01:08:09.424 --> 01:08:11.424
 IS LONGING FOR 

01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:19.178
DEATH.  
SPEAKER:  I THINK HE SNAPPED OUT

01:08:19.179 --> 01:08:23.645
 OF THE QUESTION.  TO ANSWER THE
 QUESTION, ANTONIO WAS FULL AND 

01:08:24.181 --> 01:08:27.092
TAKEN IN BY THE RECONCILIATION 
AND FRIENDSHIP THAT HE THOUGHT 

01:08:27.404 --> 01:08:31.869
WAS BEING OFFERED BY SHYLOCK.  
AND IN FACT, ANTONIO, AS HE WAS 

01:08:31.870 --> 01:08:38.712
GOING AND SEALING THE BOND SAID 
QUOTE, THERE IS MUCH KINDNESS IN

01:08:39.172 --> 01:08:43.701
 THE JEW, END QUOTE.  AND I HAVE
 TO SAY, ALTHOUGH HE IS MY 

01:08:44.133 --> 01:08:51.399
CLIENT, THAT ANTONIO WAS EASY 
PREY IN ANOTHER SENSE.  HE 

01:08:54.112 --> 01:08:56.112
PROFOUNDLY EX

01:09:02.074 --> 01:09:05.677
TRAVAGENTLY HAD A PROUD SENSE OF
 HONOR.  AND SHYLOCK, COMING AS 

01:09:05.678 --> 01:09:10.428
HE WAS, PREYED ON THIS CHARACTER
 DEFECT OF ANTONIO AND HE DID SO

01:09:10.655 --> 01:09:14.067
 IN THE FOLLOWING WAY.  HE 
RECOGNIZED THAT IF IT EVER CAME 

01:09:14.068 --> 01:09:18.200
TIME TO ENFORCE THE PENALTY 
BOND, ANTONIO WOULD BE TOO PROUD

01:09:18.201 --> 01:09:21.735
 TO DISHONOR IT.  AND THAT IN 
OTHER WORDS, HE WOULD ADMIT IT. 

01:09:21.907 --> 01:09:24.695
 AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT 
HAPPENED.  

01:09:24.696 --> 01:09:31.439
ANTONIO DIDN'T HIRE A LAWYER.  
ANTONIO OFFERED NO DEFENSE.  

01:09:32.007 --> 01:09:36.004
ANTONIO CONFESSED THE BOND AND 
OFFERED HIMSELF UP TO BE KILLED.

01:09:36.005 --> 01:09:39.972
AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT 
SHYLOCK'S SCHEME WAS.  HE KNEW 

01:09:41.376 --> 01:09:44.755
THAT ANTONIO'S SCHEME WOULD NOT 
EXIST AND THERE WOULD BE NO 

01:09:45.171 --> 01:09:47.171
COURT PROCEEDING STANDING 
BETWEEN HIMSELF

01:09:49.833 --> 01:09:52.517
 AND HIS OPPORTUNITY TO KILL 
ANTONIO AND THAT'S WHY THE 

01:09:52.518 --> 01:09:59.591
ARGUMENT THAT THERE IS AN INNER 
SESSION OF THE COURT PROCEEDING 

01:09:59.592 --> 01:10:02.425
WOULD WORK.  
BECAUSE SHYLOCK TAKING ADVANTAGE

01:10:04.245 --> 01:10:08.019
 OF HIS CHARACTER FLAW KNEW THAT
 THERE WOULD BE NO MEANINGFUL 

01:10:08.339 --> 01:10:10.967
ADDITIONAL PROTECTION OF 
ANTONIO.  

01:10:10.968 --> 01:10:14.700
SPEAKER:  SPEAKING OF BEING 
TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF, SHYLOCK, IN 

01:10:14.980 --> 01:10:17.532
A WAY, NEVER GOT DUE PROCESS.  
NEVER HAD ANYBODY TO ADVISE HIM 

01:10:17.721 --> 01:10:23.853
OF WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES WOULD 
BE.  OR WHAT THE JOURNEY THROUGH

01:10:25.196 --> 01:10:28.976
 THE LAW WOULD MEAN FOR HIM.  IS
 IT NOT AMAZING TO YOU THAT YOU 

01:10:29.124 --> 01:10:33.235
TAKE A CIVIL CASE AND IT ENDS UP
 BEING A CRIMINAL CASE?  SHOULD 

01:10:34.122 --> 01:10:36.122
HE NOT HAVE BEEN GIVEN DUE 
PROCESS ALONG

01:10:38.891 --> 01:10:41.268
 THE WAY.  
SPEAKER:  LET'S TAKE IT IN 

01:10:41.721 --> 01:10:46.231
STEPS.  IN THE NEGOTIATION IN 
THE PENALTY BOND,

01:10:50.546 --> 01:10:54.430
 I THINK THAT SHYLOCK IS A VERY 
EXPERIENCED MONEY LENDER AND 

01:10:54.431 --> 01:10:56.431
KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT THE

01:11:00.464 --> 01:11:02.464
 APPLICABLE

01:11:03.618 --> 01:11:05.618
 LAW.  AND IT SHOWS

01:11:09.193 --> 01:11:12.842
 THAT REGARDLESS OF THE 
CRITICISM WE HAVE IN THE LAW, 

01:11:12.843 --> 01:11:15.608
COURT PROCEEDINGS WERE OPEN TO 
JEWS IN VENICE AND THE 

01:11:16.174 --> 01:11:18.174
PROTECTION OF THE LAWS WERE 
APPLICABLE TO

01:11:21.105 --> 01:11:27.287
 THEM.  YOU ARE RIGHT THAT WHEN 
THEY GOT TO COURT, THE SHARADE, 

01:11:29.490 --> 01:11:32.831
MASCERADE DID DENY HIM DUE 
PROCESS.  AND WE ENTIRELY AGREE 

01:11:32.832 --> 01:11:36.882
WITH THAT.  WE THINK, HOWEVER, 
THOUGH, THE BASIS OF THE RECORD 

01:11:36.883 --> 01:11:39.689
AND THE DEVASTATING ADMISSIONS 
REPEATEDLY MADE

01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:47.248
 BY SHYLOCK, THAT HE PROPERLY 
STANDS CONVICTED OF THE OFFENSE 

01:11:47.249 --> 01:11:52.353
AT WHICH HE WAS FOUND GUILTY. 
SPEAKER:  HOW DOES THE ALIEN ACT

01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:57.212
 COME INTO THE PICTURE?  YOU 
JUST SAID THAT ANTONIO WASN'T 

01:11:57.213 --> 01:12:03.733
PUTTING UP ANY DEFENSE.  HE 
CERTAINLY DIDN'T RAISE THE ALIEN

01:12:04.138 --> 01:12:10.546
 ACT.  IT WAS THIS SHAM LAWYER 
JUDGE PORSHA WHO BROUGHT THAT.  

01:12:10.746 --> 01:12:17.927
SPEAKER:  WELL, OUR BRIEF POINTS
 OUT THAT THE INTERVENTION OF 

01:12:18.601 --> 01:12:22.922
PORSHA INDEED SAVED THE LIFE OF 
ANTONIO AND INDEED SAVED THE 

01:12:22.923 --> 01:12:26.276
LIFE OF SHYLOCK. AND SAVED 
SHYLOCK BECAUSE SHYLOCK WAS 

01:12:26.735 --> 01:12:29.401
READY, WILLING AND ABLE TO KILL

01:12:32.474 --> 01:12:36.885
 ANTONIO.  THE NOTION THAT 
ANTONIO WOULD HAVE BEEN SPARED 

01:12:38.393 --> 01:12:41.773
BY SHYLOCK IS ABSOLUTELY CRAZY. 
THE RECORD SHOWS

01:12:48.259 --> 01:12:51.229
 SHYLOCK WAS EARNESTLY 
SHARPENING HIS LIFE IN THE 

01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:54.455
COURT.  AND SHYLOCK HAD A 
BALANCE SCALE, IN ORDER TO 

01:12:54.871 --> 01:13:03.346
MEASURE THE POUND OF FLESH.  DO 
IT.  AND IT WAS ONLY PORSHA THAT

01:13:03.516 --> 01:13:05.935
 SAVED ANTONIO AND SHYLOCK 
HIMSELF.  

01:13:05.936 --> 01:13:08.255
SPEAKER:  COUNSEL, I WOULD LIKE 
TO ASK A QUESTION HERE.  I THINK

01:13:08.604 --> 01:13:12.951
 WE WOULD ALL AGREE THAT THE 
RECORD IS BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN. 

01:13:18.731 --> 01:13:22.863
LEAST OF THE COURT PROCEEDINGS. 
AND I BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE 

01:13:23.081 --> 01:13:26.991
ASKING US TO DRAW A LOT OF 
INFERENCES FROM THE RECORD.  

01:13:26.992 --> 01:13:29.589
WHAT ABOUT THIS INFERENCE THAT 
SHYLOCK NEVER BELIEVED THAT THE 

01:13:29.860 --> 01:13:35.777
COURT WOULD ALLOW HIM TO EXACT 
HIS FLESH.  HE DOES SEEM 

01:13:36.374 --> 01:13:39.434
SURPRISED IN THE COURT 
PROCEEDING WHEN PORSHA SAYS, 

01:13:39.693 --> 01:13:44.204
YOU'RE RIGHT.  YOU MAY ENFORCE 
THE PENALTY BOND AND PRAISES HER

01:13:45.077 --> 01:13:49.998
 AND SOUNDS VERY SURPRISED.  WHY
 ISN'T IT A REASONABLE INFERENCE

01:13:50.201 --> 01:13:57.005
 AS YOU HAVE HAVE US DRAW, THAT 
HE WAS WILLING TO PUT THE KNIFE 

01:13:57.459 --> 01:14:01.156
TO ENTER HIS HEART.  WHY ISN'T 
IT JUST AS EQUALLY VALID 

01:14:02.113 --> 01:14:06.407
INFERENCE THAT HE NEVER THOUGHT 
THAT THE COURT WOULD ALLOW HIM 

01:14:07.315 --> 01:14:11.845
TO EXACT THIS MEASURE -- ENFORCE
 THE PENALTY BOND LITERALLY?  

01:14:12.095 --> 01:14:15.060
SPEAKER:  WELL, WITH ALL 
RESPECT, WE DON'T THINK THERE IS

01:14:15.254 --> 01:14:18.023
 ANY QUESTION OF INFERENCE.  
BECAUSE WE HAVE THE MAN'S WORDS.

01:14:19.084 --> 01:14:25.043
AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN.  
THOSE WORDS, EVENTS, NOTHING 

01:14:25.330 --> 01:14:32.596
OTHER THAN AN INTENT TO EXECUTE 
ANTONIO TO HAVE REVENGE AND TO 

01:14:33.237 --> 01:14:37.914
REALIZE THE LONG-STANDING OBJECT
 OF HIS HATRED.  THAT IS THE 

01:14:38.487 --> 01:14:40.487
KILLING EVENT.  
SPEAKER:  THAT'S ANOTHER 

01:14:41.980 --> 01:14:47.090
INFERENCE.  JUST AS GINSBURG 
POINTED OUT.  SHYLOCK SAID ON 

01:14:47.454 --> 01:14:51.074
SEVERAL OCCASIONS, THIS IS A 
MARRIED BOND.  THIS IS NOTHING 

01:14:51.379 --> 01:14:53.925
TO BE WORRIED ABOUT.  AND HE 
DOES APPEAR SURPRISED WHEN 

01:14:53.926 --> 01:15:01.842
PORSHA SAYS, YOU'RE RIGHT.  YOU 
WIN.  WHY IS THIS NOT A PROPER 

01:15:02.185 --> 01:15:04.913
INFERENCE FOR US TO DRAW THAT HE
 MIGHT HAVE, SINCE YOU WANT US 

01:15:04.914 --> 01:15:09.040
TO DRAW SOME INFERENCES FROM THE
 RECORD, WHY ISN'T IT 

01:15:09.041 --> 01:15:12.517
APPROPRIATE TO DRAW THAT 
INFERENCE AS WELL? 

01:15:12.518 --> 01:15:19.871
SPEAKER:  AS I READ THE RECORD, 
BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN AS IT IS, I 

01:15:20.192 --> 01:15:23.418
WOULD CHARACTERIZE SHYLOCK'S 
REACTION NOT AS

01:15:26.456 --> 01:15:30.313
 SURPRISED.  BUT AS EXULTANT 
DELIGHT.  

01:15:30.314 --> 01:15:34.605
SPEAKER:  COUNSEL, COUNSEL, YOUR
 TIME IS ABOUT TO RUN OUT.  SO 

01:15:34.606 --> 01:15:38.222
IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO CONCLUDE.  
SPEAKER:  THANK YOU.  FOR THE 

01:15:41.027 --> 01:15:43.876
REASONS ARGUED IN OUR BRIEF AND 
THE ARGUMENTS THAT I WOULD HAVE 

01:15:44.775 --> 01:15:52.556
MADE, IF I DID NOT HAVE SO MANY 
GOOD QUESTIONS, WE BELIEVE, WE 

01:15:53.425 --> 01:15:56.518
BELIEVE THAT THE JUDGMENT WAS 
CORRECT, AND THAT THIS COURT 

01:15:57.068 --> 01:15:59.471
SHOULD ARRIVE AT THE SAME 
JUDGMENT ON ITS OWN INITIATIVE. 

01:15:59.924 --> 01:16:02.386
THANK YOU.  
SPEAKER:  INCLUDING CONVERSION. 

01:16:02.907 --> 01:16:06.034
SPEAKER:  ABSOLUTELY INCLUDING 
CONVERSION.  THAT'S TO SAVE THE 

01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:11.160
ETERNAL SOUL OF SHYLOCK.  

01:16:18.327 --> 01:16:23.925
[APPLAUSE]. 
SPEAKER:  WE WILL NOW HEAR FROM 

01:16:26.226 --> 01:16:28.226
PORSHA'S COUNSEL.  
SPEAKER:  JUSTICE

01:16:34.084 --> 01:16:36.084
GINSBURG AND 

01:16:37.888 --> 01:16:39.888
COURT, I'M TERESA 
MIGUEL-STEARNS.  I'M COUNSEL FOR

01:16:40.289 --> 01:16:43.579
 PORSHA.  YEARS AGO, PORSHA 
PROVIDED TO THE COUNSEL OF 

01:16:43.915 --> 01:16:52.504
VENICE.  IN A DISPUTE BETWEEN 
SHYLOCK, AND CO-APELLEE ANTONIO,

01:16:52.819 --> 01:16:56.108
 THIS ALMOST TURNED DEADLY.  
PORSHA'S SKILLFUL NAVIGATION OF 

01:16:58.006 --> 01:17:03.529
VENETIAN LAW SAVED BOTH MENS' 
LIVES.  AS A DIRECT RESULT AND 

01:17:03.943 --> 01:17:09.013
HER ROLE IN THIS SHYLOCK ANTONIO
 DISPUTE, PORSHA HAS SUFFERED 

01:17:09.474 --> 01:17:13.333
UNJUSTIFIED TARGETED ATTACKS TO 
HER REPUTATION OVER THE COURSE 

01:17:13.688 --> 01:17:21.036
OF THE LAST 400 YEARS.  TODAY 
PORSHA ASKED THAT SHE BE 

01:17:21.392 --> 01:17:23.433
DISCHARGED FROM THIS CASE AND 
FROM ANY

01:17:32.041 --> 01:17:37.431
 FUTURE RELATED PROCEEDINGS.  
YOUR HONOR, WE HAVE FIVE POINTS 

01:17:37.432 --> 01:17:41.838
TO OUR BRIEFS AND THE FIRST AND 
FOREMOST IS THAT PORSHA IS THE 

01:17:41.839 --> 01:17:47.314
PRIMARY DEFENDEE IN THIS CASE 
AND PORSHA'S ALLEGED 

01:17:47.844 --> 01:17:50.226
MISREPRESENTATIONS TO THE COURT 
AND ALLEGED INTERESTS IN THE 

01:17:50.637 --> 01:17:56.428
OUTCOME OF THIS MATTER ARE 
WITHOUT MERIT OR AT MOST, 

01:17:58.343 --> 01:18:04.917
HARMLESS ERROR.  AND I WILL TURN
 TO THOSE MATTERS NOW.  FIRST 

01:18:06.649 --> 01:18:14.029
PORTIA IS THE DEFENDANT IN THIS 
CASE.  AND COUNSEL IS WELL AWARE

01:18:15.502 --> 01:18:20.258
 THAT PORTIA'S ROLE WAS TO 
LEGALLY PROVIDE THE ADVICE TO 

01:18:21.624 --> 01:18:24.095
DUKE OF VENICE.  
SPEAKER:  PORTIA, ALTHOUGH SHE 

01:18:25.902 --> 01:18:29.086
WAS NOT A LAWYER, WE SEEM TO 
RECOGNIZE THAT SHE KNEW 

01:18:29.087 --> 01:18:31.087
SOMETHING ABOUT THE LAW.  AND 
SURELY SHE

01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:37.333
 WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT FOR HER, 
FOR PORTIA TO GIVE COUNSEL TO 

01:18:37.334 --> 01:18:43.451
THE DUKE.  AND FOR SHYLOCK TO 
STAND THERE UNREPRESENTED, THAT 

01:18:43.452 --> 01:18:48.901
SHE WAS WILLING TO DO WHEN SHE 
WAS A CIVIL PLAINTIFF.  BEING 

01:18:50.744 --> 01:18:57.092
PROSECUTED AND NO COUNSEL, APART
 FROM YOUR CONFLICT OF INTEREST,

01:18:57.398 --> 01:19:02.761
 BEING MARRIED TO THE PRINCIPLE,
 ISN'T THAT JUST OVERWHELMING?  

01:19:03.726 --> 01:19:06.581
SPEAKER:  YOUR HONOR RAISES 
THREE POINTS.  AND I WOULD LIKE 

01:19:07.245 --> 01:19:12.572
TO ADDRESS THEM ALL.  FIRST, 
THAT PORTIA WAS NOT LEARNED IN 

01:19:12.967 --> 01:19:16.147
THE LAW.  THE RECORD 
DEMONSTRATES THAT PORTIA WAS 

01:19:16.521 --> 01:19:20.905
INDEED LEARNED IN THE LAW.  AND 
IN 16TH CENTURY VENICE, ONE DID 

01:19:21.250 --> 01:19:26.987
NOT NEED A UNIVERSITY DIPLOMA OR
 ANY -- 

01:19:26.988 --> 01:19:31.798
SPEAKER:  CONCEDING THAT SHE WAS
 LEARNING IN THE LAW.  MAYBE I 

01:19:32.314 --> 01:19:35.854
MISSPOKE OR MISUNDERSTOOD.  SHE 
WAS IN THE LAW AND HAD TO BE IN 

01:19:36.690 --> 01:19:38.752
ORDER TO BE SUCH

01:19:47.294 --> 01:19:52.426
 A TRIXTER.  AND LEARNING FOR 
THE REPUBLIC OF VENICE AND 

01:19:52.589 --> 01:19:54.815
ANTONIO.  AND SHYLOCK IS 
STANDING THERE WITH NO ONE TO 

01:19:54.816 --> 01:19:58.222
REPRESENT HIM.  HE IS THE TARGET
 OF A CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.  

01:19:58.483 --> 01:20:01.126
DOESN'T HE HAVE A RIGHT TO 
COUNSEL?  

01:20:01.127 --> 01:20:04.550
SPEAKER:  YOUR HONOR, ON THE 
ISSUE OF NOTICE, IT WAS SHYLOCK 

01:20:06.034 --> 01:20:14.793
WHO DRAGGED EVERYONE INTO COURT.
 BASANIO, THE DUKE OF VENICE AND

01:20:15.922 --> 01:20:22.401
 OTHERS TRIED TO SETTLE THE CASE
 PRIOR TO COMING TO COURT AND 

01:20:22.402 --> 01:20:26.154
SHYLOCK CRAVED HIS BOND AND 
SHYLOCK WANTED THE POUND OF 

01:20:26.340 --> 01:20:28.607
FLESH AND BROUGHT EVERYONE INTO 
COURT ON A CIVIL PROCEEDING.  

01:20:28.896 --> 01:20:33.966
THIS CASE NEVER TURNED INTO A 
PROSECUTION.  PORTIA WAS NEVER A

01:20:34.919 --> 01:20:40.946
 PROSECUTOR AND THE ALIEN ACT 
REMAINED A CASE.  AND AS SOON AS

01:20:41.606 --> 01:20:47.925
 PORTIA EXPLAINS TO THE DUKE OF 
VENICE WHAT WAS INVOLVED IN THE 

01:20:48.705 --> 01:20:53.008
ALIEN STATUTE, BEFORE SHYLOCK 
HAD TO UTTER A WORD, THE DUKE OF

01:20:53.009 --> 01:20:56.626
 VENICE SAID IMMEDIATELY, NO WE 
ARE NOT GOING TO CONSIDER THIS 

01:20:57.833 --> 01:21:01.172
CAPITAL PUNISHMENT CASE.  WE 
WILL KEEP IT AS A CIVIL CASE AND

01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:05.630
 SHYLOCK'S CASE IS THE ONLY 
THING IN JEOPARDY.  SHYLOCK'S 

01:21:05.631 --> 01:21:09.418
LIFE OR FREEDOM WERE NEVER IN 
JEOPARDY THROUGHOUT THE COURSE 

01:21:09.419 --> 01:21:13.111
OF THESE PROCEEDINGS.  
SPEAKER:  BUT SHYLOCK NEVER KNEW

01:21:13.325 --> 01:21:18.547
 THAT THE LAW PUT HIM IN THAT 
POSITION.  HE SAID, REPEATEDLY, 

01:21:20.041 --> 01:21:30.036
I CRAVE THE LAW.  HAD HE BEEN 
COUNSELED, HE

01:21:30.866 --> 01:21:34.528
 WOULD HAVE KNOWN. 
SPEAKER:  WITH DUE RESPECT, YOUR

01:21:34.529 --> 01:21:42.841
 HONOR, IGNORECE OF THE LAW IS 
NO DEFENSE.  

01:21:42.842 --> 01:21:44.842
SPEAKER:  BUT HAVING NO COUNSEL.
SPEAKER:  MANY PEOPLE TRIED TO 

01:21:45.774 --> 01:21:50.868
CONVINCE SHYLOCK TO SETTLE THIS 
CASE PRIOR TO IT BECOMING THE 

01:21:51.350 --> 01:21:53.350
CIVIL CASE REQUIRED BY THE ALIEN

01:21:58.929 --> 01:22:04.499
 ACT.  IN FACT, WHEN PORTIA 
FIRST ENCOUNTERED THE COURTROOM.

01:22:04.500 --> 01:22:08.941
  SHE SAID WHO IS THE JEW AND 
WHO IS THE MERCHANT.  SHE PLACED

01:22:09.096 --> 01:22:12.396
 BOTH PEOPLE, BOTH PARTICIPANTS 
IN THIS TRIAL AT THE SAME LEVEL 

01:22:12.397 --> 01:22:15.957
AT THE EYES OF THE LAW.  
SPEAKER:  WHO IS THE JEW?  NOT 

01:22:16.337 --> 01:22:20.014
WHO IS THE LENDER AND WHO IS THE
 BORROWER?  

01:22:20.015 --> 01:22:22.283
SPEAKER:  RIGHT.  IT WAS -- 
THAT'S CORRECT, YOUR HONOR.  

01:22:22.509 --> 01:22:25.418
THIS IS WHAT THE TRANSCRIPT 
SHOWS. 

01:22:29.636 --> 01:22:34.604
 [APPLAUSE]. 
SPEAKER:  WE HAVE ANOTHER CLUE 

01:22:34.605 --> 01:22:36.605
TO PORTIA'S CHARACTER.  SO SHE 

01:22:45.132 --> 01:22:51.073
CALLS SHYLOCK A JEW.  BACK IN 
BELMONT, SHE SAYS WE DON'T NEED 

01:22:51.292 --> 01:22:59.297
PEOPLE OF THAT DARK COMPLEXION. 
THIS IS A WOMAN WHO ENTERTAINS 

01:23:00.052 --> 01:23:04.188
CERTAIN BIASES.  
SPEAKER:  YOUR HONOR.  PORTIA 

01:23:04.189 --> 01:23:08.674
HAVE A VERY DISTINCT IDEA IN 
BELMONT THAT SHE HAD WANTED TO 

01:23:08.961 --> 01:23:12.298
MARRY BESANIO.  THEY HAD LAID 
EYES ON EACH OTHER IN THE PAST 

01:23:12.299 --> 01:23:17.326
AND HOPING THAT BESANIO WOULD BE
 THE SUITOR WHO WOULD CORRECTLY 

01:23:17.508 --> 01:23:22.776
GUESS THE BOX, THE CASKET THAT 
HER FATHER LAID OUT.  

01:23:22.777 --> 01:23:25.991
SPEAKER:  WAS PORTIA FREE TO 
MARRY ANYONE SHE WANTED TO?  

01:23:26.169 --> 01:23:30.445
SPEAKER:  NO, SHE WAS NOT YOUR 
HONOR.  PORTIA WAS A WEALTHY 

01:23:30.601 --> 01:23:35.451
ORPHAN WHOSE LIFE WAS DICTATED 
BY HER LATE FATHER.  HER LATE 

01:23:36.239 --> 01:23:38.927
FATHER HAD PROVIDED FOR HER 
EDUCATION, BUT HAD ALSO PROVIDED

01:23:39.156 --> 01:23:44.464
 THE METHOD FOR DICTATING WHO 
HER HUSBAND WOULD BE.  

01:23:44.465 --> 01:23:46.465
SPEAKER:  AND

01:23:47.954 --> 01:23:52.469
 THAT MAY HAVE BEEN VERY 

01:23:58.317 --> 01:24:08.080
PATRIACHIAL.  BUT SPOKE ABOUT 
BURNISH SKIN.  DID NOT REQUIRE 

01:24:08.081 --> 01:24:10.081
HER MARRIAGE FROM THE PEOPLE OF 

01:24:16.297 --> 01:24:18.297
MOROCCO.  
SPEAKER:  THAT'S CORRECT YOUR 

01:24:18.528 --> 01:24:20.058
HONOR.  
SPEAKER:  SO WE RECOGNIZE THAT 

01:24:20.059 --> 01:24:29.702
SHE HAS CERTAIN BIASES BASED ON 
RACE AGAINST MOROCCO, AGAINST 

01:24:30.111 --> 01:24:31.740
SHYLOCK.  
SPEAKER:  I WOULD PICK UP ON 

01:24:31.741 --> 01:24:35.346
THAT.  I SEE THAT, REALLY, AS A 
CONFLICT OF INTEREST.  AS A 

01:24:35.640 --> 01:24:40.227
CONFLICT OF INTEREST, THE 
UNCLEAN HANDS, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE

01:24:40.228 --> 01:24:45.306
 OF BESANIO AND SHE WAS TO GAIN 
FROM THE SITUATION.  

01:24:45.307 --> 01:24:51.199
SPEAKER:  YES, REGARDING THE 
CONFLICT OF INTEREST, PORTIA HAS

01:24:51.562 --> 01:24:55.301
 BOTH A FINANCIAL AND CONFLICT 
OF INTEREST IN THIS CASE.  I 

01:24:55.302 --> 01:24:58.238
WILL ADDRESS BOTH.  FIRST THE 
FINANCIAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST. 

01:24:58.583 --> 01:25:00.583
FROM THE VERY

01:25:03.547 --> 01:25:06.919
 BEGINNING, PORTIA SETTLED WITH 
SHYLOCK, EVEN BEFORE SHE AND 

01:25:06.920 --> 01:25:12.591
BESANIO WERE MARRIED.  OFFERED 
HER BUCKETS TO BESANIO TO SETTLE

01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:15.784
 THE CASE.  
WHEN PORTIA FIRST WALKED INTO 

01:25:16.321 --> 01:25:20.011
COURT, SHE PLEADED WITH SHYLOCK 
TO SETTLE THE CASE.  

01:25:20.012 --> 01:25:26.522
FINANCIALLY, TWO TIMES THE 
AMOUNT, THREE TIMES THE AMOUNT, 

01:25:27.484 --> 01:25:34.139
TEN TIMES THE AMOUNTS OF HER 
DUCKETS WERE OFFERED TO SHYLOCK.

01:25:34.357 --> 01:25:38.770
WAS REFUSED.  SHE BROUGHT IN THE
 QUALITY OF MERCY.  THE QUALITY 

01:25:39.263 --> 01:25:45.145
OF MERCY -- EXCUSE ME.  THE 
QUALITY OF MERCY IS NOT 

01:25:45.607 --> 01:25:49.437
STRAINED.  IT'S DROPPED AS THE 
GENTLE RAIN FROM HEAVEN BEYOND 

01:25:49.438 --> 01:25:53.892
THE PLACE BENEATH.  
SPEAKER:  WHERE WAS HER MERCY?  

01:25:54.104 --> 01:25:58.281
SHE IS URGING SHYLOCK TO BE 
MERCIFUL.  AND THEN SHE TURNS ON

01:25:58.728 --> 01:26:00.790
 HIM AND SAYS, I HAVE NO MERCY 
FOR YOU.  

01:26:00.791 --> 01:26:04.448
SPEAKER:  I BELIEVE YOUR HONOR 
IS REFERRING TO THE ALIEN ACT.  

01:26:05.683 --> 01:26:08.449
AND IT IS ACTUALLY PORTIA'S 
MERCY WHICH SAVED BOTH

01:26:11.563 --> 01:26:15.396
 OF THEIR LIVES.  PORTIA IS 
MERELY PROVIDING LEGAL ADVICE TO

01:26:15.397 --> 01:26:19.442
 THE DUKE OF VENICE.  WHEN 
PORTIA REALIZES THAT SHE IS NOT 

01:26:19.443 --> 01:26:27.431
ABLE TO CONVINCE SHYLOCK TO 
SETTLE THIS CASE, SHE GRANTS HIM

01:26:27.432 --> 01:26:29.633
 SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE ON THE 
CONTRACT.  

01:26:29.634 --> 01:26:34.899
AND THAT IS TO TAKE THE POUND OF
 FLESH.  BUT AT THE MOMENT THAT 

01:26:35.049 --> 01:26:41.198
SHYLOCK IS READY TO CARVE OUT A 
POUND OF FLESH FROM ANTONIO'S 

01:26:41.584 --> 01:26:47.608
CHEST, PORTIA STOPS THE 
PROCEEDING, STRICTLY INTERPRETS 

01:26:47.929 --> 01:26:51.704
THE CONTRACTS WITH THE REFERENCE
 THAT WAS MADE EARLIER, IN THAT 

01:26:51.705 --> 01:26:55.637
A STRICT INTERPRETATION OF A 
CONTRACT WOULD REQUIRE NO MORE, 

01:26:55.859 --> 01:26:58.978
NO LESS THAN A POUND OF FLESH.  
AND NOT ANY OTHER MATTER.  NO 

01:26:59.407 --> 01:27:03.969
BLOOD.  NO OTHER MATTER.  NO 
BONE.  NO ORGAN.  AT THAT POINT 

01:27:03.970 --> 01:27:10.346
SHE ALSO ADVISES THE DUKE THAT 
SHYLOCK'S ACTIONS, SHYLOCK'S 

01:27:10.534 --> 01:27:16.254
ATTEMPT TO MURDER ANTONIO, WHICH
 IS NOT IN DOUBT AT THIS POINT, 

01:27:16.255 --> 01:27:19.603
IS PUNISHABLE BY THE ALIEN 
STATUTE.  THE ALIEN STATUTE -- 

01:27:19.821 --> 01:27:23.464
SPEAKER:  YOU'RE TELLING US THEN
 THAT THE CONTRACT, IT WAS 

01:27:23.737 --> 01:27:28.212
IMPOSSIBLE TO ENFORCE THE 
CONTRACT.  SO THE POUND OF FLESH

01:27:28.944 --> 01:27:36.659
 HAS TO GO BY POSSIBILITY.  
EVERYONE KNOWS THAT YOU CAN'T 

01:27:36.871 --> 01:27:39.936
TAKE FLESH WITHOUT BLOOD AS 
WELL.  SO THEN WHAT WOULD HAPPEN

01:27:39.937 --> 01:27:45.491
 IF HE CAN'T GET THE REMEDY HE 
IS DEMANDING, HE WOULD GET A 

01:27:45.953 --> 01:27:48.906
SUBSTITUTIONAL REMEDY AND WOULD 
GET THE ORDINARY REMEDY FOR A 

01:27:49.277 --> 01:27:52.680
BREECH OF CONTRACT.  THAT IS, IN
 THIS CASE, HIS MONEY BACK.  

01:27:52.847 --> 01:27:55.729
SPEAKER:  YOUR HONOR, 
RESPECTFULLY, THIS CONTRACT WAS 

01:27:56.240 --> 01:28:00.894
ENFORCEABLE UNDER THE LAWS OF 
VENICE.  THIS IS A COMMERCIAL 

01:28:01.185 --> 01:28:10.170
CONTRACT AND VENICE AS THE 
INTERNATIONAL COMMERCIAL THAT IT

01:28:10.659 --> 01:28:12.397
 WAS, IT ENFORCES ALL CONTRACTS.

01:28:12.398 --> 01:28:15.978
THE DUKE KNEW THIS.  ANTONIO 
KNEW THIS AND EVEN SAID IT TO 

01:28:16.923 --> 01:28:19.975
HIS FRIENDS WHEN HE WAS GOING 
INTO THE COURT.  

01:28:19.976 --> 01:28:23.958
SPEAKER:  BUT PORTIA IS CORRECT.
THE CONTRACT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO 

01:28:24.717 --> 01:28:28.130
ENFORCE.  YOU CAN'T TAKE FLESH 
WITHOUT TAKING BLOOD.  THAT IS 

01:28:28.376 --> 01:28:30.755
NOT A POSSIBILITY.  
SPEAKER:  YOUR HONOR, IT IS MY 

01:28:31.079 --> 01:28:33.938
UNDERSTANDING THAT WITH A

01:28:38.511 --> 01:28:41.634
 VERY HOT KNIFE, ONE CAN TAKE 
FLESH WITHOUT BLOOD.  

01:28:42.882 --> 01:28:44.882
[LAUGHTER]. 

01:28:51.673 --> 01:28:55.430
 THIS CASE WAS TO MAKE SURE THAT
 BOTH MEN WALKED OUT OF

01:28:58.752 --> 01:29:03.930
 THE COURTROOM ALIVE.  NOT ONE 
ON A STRETCHER HAVING HIS CHEST 

01:29:03.931 --> 01:29:08.786
LED OUT AND CARVED ON HIS CHEST 
AND NOT ANOTHER BEING HUNG OFF. 

01:29:11.399 --> 01:29:13.399
JUDGE.  NOT

01:29:16.179 --> 01:29:21.088
 A CONFLICTED ONE.  
SPEAKER:  MS. MIGUEL-STEARNS, I 

01:29:21.277 --> 01:29:25.188
BELIEVE IT'S YOUR POSITION THAT 
PORTIA DID NOT ENGAGE IN ANY 

01:29:25.674 --> 01:29:27.484
MISREPRESENTATION.  IS THAT 
RIGHT?  YOU HAVE CERTAINLY 

01:29:27.485 --> 01:29:31.979
POINTED TO FACTS IN THE RECORD 
THAT DO SUPPORT THE CONCLUSION 

01:29:32.743 --> 01:29:38.725
THAT SHE WAS VERY LEARNED IN THE
 LAW.  BUT DIDN'T SHE ENGAGE IN 

01:29:39.077 --> 01:29:44.629
MISREPRESENTATION AND IF SO, 
DOESN'T THAT TAINT THE 

01:29:45.313 --> 01:29:47.997
PROCEEDING SO THAT THE JUDGMENT 
SHOULD BE SET ASIDE AND THERE 

01:29:48.571 --> 01:29:52.819
SHOULD BE A RETRIAL?  
SPEAKER:  YOUR HONOR, THE ONLY 

01:29:53.243 --> 01:29:56.564
MISREPRESENTATION THAT PORTIA 
MADE WAS DISGUISING HERSELF AS A

01:29:57.427 --> 01:30:01.093
 MAN.  THAT SHE WAS A WOMAN, HAD
 ABSOLUTELY NO BEARING ON THE 

01:30:01.094 --> 01:30:04.009
OUTCOME OF THE CASE.  SHE WAS 
LEGITIMATELY IN THE COURT HAVING

01:30:04.689 --> 01:30:10.264
 BEEN SENT THERE BY DR. BELARIO 
TO PROVIDE LEGAL ADVICE TO THE 

01:30:10.841 --> 01:30:14.247
DUKE OF VENICE.  THE DUKE OF 
VENICE DID NOT WANT TO ENFORCE 

01:30:14.248 --> 01:30:17.275
THE CONTRACT, EVEN THOUGH HE 
FELT HE NEEDED TO, BECAUSE THE 

01:30:17.594 --> 01:30:20.626
LAWS OF VENICE NEED TO BE 
STRICTLY ENFORCED IN ORDER TO 

01:30:20.806 --> 01:30:27.247
RETAIN IT, AS I MENTIONED.  
SPEAKER:  BUT DID VELARIO KNOW 

01:30:27.762 --> 01:30:30.014
THAT PORTIA WAS MARRIED TO THE 
PRINCIPLE IN THIS CASE?  

01:30:30.015 --> 01:30:37.751
SPEAKER:  YOUR HONOR, THE RECORD
 IS NOT CLEAR ON THAT POINT.  

01:30:38.311 --> 01:30:40.479
HOWEVER, DR. VELARIO DID KNOW 
THAT PORTIA WAS LEARNED IN THE 

01:30:40.703 --> 01:30:45.513
LAW AND WAS VERY CAPABLE OF 
PROVIDING APPROPRIATE LEGAL 

01:30:46.239 --> 01:30:50.230
ADVICE TO THE DUKE.  DR. VELARIO
 WROTE A LETTER PERSONALLY TO 

01:30:50.231 --> 01:30:55.567
THE DUKE AND ATTESTED PERSONALLY
 TO THE DUKE, THAT HE AND PORTIA

01:30:56.137 --> 01:31:00.591
 HAD REVIEWED THE CASE AND 
TURNED OVER MANY BOOKS TOGETHER 

01:31:00.592 --> 01:31:05.409
IN THIS MATTER AND DR. VELARIO 
PROVIDED PORTIA WITH HIS 

01:31:05.410 --> 01:31:15.309
OPINION, WHICH ON TOP OF 
PORTIA'S OWN LEGAL ADVICE,

01:31:15.797 --> 01:31:19.123
 DR. VELARIO KNEW HE WAS GOING 
TO DESCRIBE HIMSELF AS A MAN AND

01:31:20.212 --> 01:31:23.109
 WAS GOING TO DO SO.  WAS A 
TRUSTED LEGAL ADVISOR IN THE 

01:31:23.500 --> 01:31:32.716
DUKE OF VENICE AND WAS ILL THAT 
DAY AND SAID PORTIA IN HIS 

01:31:34.279 --> 01:31:36.801
STEAD.  PORTIA HAD NO OTHER 
INTEREST IN THIS MATTER OTHER 

01:31:37.727 --> 01:31:42.731
THAN TO SEE THE DISPUTE RESOLVED
 AND SEE BOTH MEN ALIVE.  

01:31:42.732 --> 01:31:45.212
SPEAKER:  DID SHE NOT, AT SOME 
POINT AT THE END, REJECT 

01:31:46.558 --> 01:31:50.507
SHYLOCK'S REQUEST FOR REPAYMENT?
SPEAKER:  YES, YOUR HONOR, SHE 

01:31:50.508 --> 01:31:54.293
DID.  AND THAT IS BECAUSE 
MULTIPLE TIMES THROUGHOUT THE 

01:31:54.508 --> 01:31:57.915
COURSE OF THE PROCEEDINGS, 
SHYLOCK HAD BEEN OFFERED TO 

01:31:59.294 --> 01:32:04.259
SETTLE THE CASE FINANCIALLY.  AT
 SOME POINT THAT -- WHEN HE 

01:32:04.638 --> 01:32:06.638
FINALLY SAID NO, I

01:32:08.904 --> 01:32:13.145
 DEMAND MY BOND AND PORTIA 
ADVISED THAT SPECIFIC 

01:32:13.146 --> 01:32:15.428
PERFORMANCE WOULD BE THE ONLY 
REMEDY, AT THAT POINT ANY 

01:32:15.429 --> 01:32:19.021
NEGOTIATIONS ARE OFF THE TABLE. 
 VENICE IS A PLACE OF NO TAKE 

01:32:19.365 --> 01:32:22.534
BACKS.  YOU DON'T GET TWO 
CHANCES IN VENICE.  ONCE THEY 

01:32:22.830 --> 01:32:25.286
PASS THE POINT OF SETTLING THE 
CASE 

01:32:30.865 --> 01:32:35.110
AMMICIBLY AND FINANCIALLY, THAT 
DOOR WAS CLOSED.  I GUESS I 

01:32:35.111 --> 01:32:37.746
CAN'T TAKE THAT POUND OF FLESH 
AND LET'S GO BACK AND TIME AND I

01:32:37.916 --> 01:32:42.233
 WILL TAKE THE MONEY AND LEAVE. 
THAT IS JUST NOT -- THAT IS JUST

01:32:42.418 --> 01:32:47.739
 NOT THE LAW IN VENICE.  
SPEAKER:  PORTIA'S MOTIVATION TO

01:32:48.590 --> 01:32:51.737
 GET INVOLVED IN THIS, I DON'T 
QUITE UNDERSTAND THE WAY YOU ARE

01:32:52.350 --> 01:32:56.177
 CHARACTERIZING IT.  SHE DECIDES
 TO GET INVOLVED AFTER SHE HAS 

01:32:56.555 --> 01:33:04.238
HEARD THAT ANTONIO HAS LOST HIS 
SHIFT.  SHE DECIDES THAT SHE 

01:33:04.419 --> 01:33:07.791
WANTS TO HELP ANTONIO BECAUSE 
ANTONIO MUST BE A WONDERFUL 

01:33:08.243 --> 01:33:10.487
PERSON SINCE HE IS THE BEST 

01:33:14.486 --> 01:33:17.286
FRIEND OF HER HUSBAND.  AND AT 
THAT POINT SHE DECIDES THAT SHE 

01:33:17.780 --> 01:33:21.002
IS GOING TO PLAY THIS TRICK. 
DOESN'T THAT MOTIVATION IN AND 

01:33:21.531 --> 01:33:25.256
OF ITSELF, SHOW THAT SHE IS 
DEEPLY CONFLICTED HERE IN TERMS 

01:33:25.813 --> 01:33:27.813
OF HER

01:33:30.763 --> 01:33:34.956
 INTEREST IN THE MATTER?  
SPEAKER:  YOUR HONOR, AS I HAVE 

01:33:35.261 --> 01:33:39.218
MENTIONED, PORTIA IS NOT 
CONFLICTED IN THIS CASE.  IT'S 

01:33:39.219 --> 01:33:45.894
TRUE THAT VESANIO AND ANTONIO 
WERE FRIENDS.  BUT PORTIA HAD 

01:33:45.895 --> 01:33:53.423
NEVER MET ANTONIO.  PORTIA HAD 
NEVER MET SHYLOCK.  PORTIA WAS 

01:33:53.424 --> 01:33:57.187
ONLY CONCERNED ABOUT PROVIDING 
PROPER LEGAL ADVICE AND ENSURNG 

01:33:57.188 --> 01:34:00.757
THAT BOTH MEN WALK OUT OF THIS 
CASE ALIVE.  

01:34:00.758 --> 01:34:02.758
SPEAKER:  HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT 

01:34:05.343 --> 01:34:09.325
WHEN THE ONLY REASON SHE WENT TO
 VELARIO AND THEN WENT TO VENICE

01:34:09.504 --> 01:34:13.573
 WAS IN THE INTEREST OF HER 
HUSBAND?  

01:34:13.574 --> 01:34:17.921
SPEAKER:  YOUR HONOR, PORTIA AS 
A WOMAN IN 16TH CENTURY VENICE, 

01:34:17.922 --> 01:34:24.155
HAD VERY LIMITED OPPORTUNITIES 
TO PURSUE A CAREER.  [LAUGHTER].

01:34:25.007 --> 01:34:30.614
THIS WAS AN OPPORTUNITY, NOT 
ONLY TO SAVE THE LIFE OF A 

01:34:31.080 --> 01:34:37.143
FRIEND OF HER HUSBAND, BUT ALSO 
TO PUT HER LEGAL EDUCATION TO 

01:34:38.859 --> 01:34:44.914
USE.  SHE KNEW THAT DR. BELARIO,
 HER COUSIN, WOULD PROPERLY 

01:34:45.397 --> 01:34:52.248
RECOMMEND HER.  AND DR. BELARIO 
WOULD NOT RECOMMEND A COUSIN WHO

01:34:52.652 --> 01:34:57.002
 COULD NOT PROVIDE LEGAL ADVICE,
 MUCH LESS A FEMALE COUSIN TO 

01:34:57.423 --> 01:35:02.513
SEND INTO COURT, PUTTING HIS OWN
 REPUTATION ON THE LINE, 

01:35:02.819 --> 01:35:11.881
PROVIDING ADVICE TO THE DUKE OF 
VENICE.  DR. BELARIO WAS A 

01:35:11.882 --> 01:35:14.582
CAREER MEMBER IN THE COMMUNITY 
AND WOULD NOT HAVE PUT HIS 

01:35:15.150 --> 01:35:19.692
ENTIRE CAREER ON THE LINE FOR 
PORTIA.  YOUR HONOR, I SEE

01:35:22.770 --> 01:35:24.770
 MY

01:35:27.495 --> 01:35:32.861
 TIME IS UP.  IF I MAY JUST 
CLOSE THAT PORTIA REQUESTS ONCE 

01:35:32.862 --> 01:35:39.742
AGAIN THAT SHE BE RELIEVED FROM 
THIS CASE.  PORTIA DID NOT HAVE 

01:35:39.743 --> 01:35:42.596
A CONFLICT OF INTEREST AND HER 
APPEARANCE AS A MAN DID NOT 

01:35:42.786 --> 01:35:49.423
AFFECT THE OUTCOME OF THIS CASE 
AND SHE WAS QUALIFIED TO GIVE 

01:35:49.768 --> 01:35:52.861
LEGAL ADVICE AND SHYLOCK WOULD 
HAVE MURDERED ANTONIO AND 

01:35:53.144 --> 01:35:57.656
SHYLOCK HIMSELF WOULD HAVE BEEN 
EXECUTED.  RATHER PORTIA, 

01:35:58.122 --> 01:36:01.195
DESPITE ATTEMPTS OVER AND OVER 
AGAIN TO CONVINCE SHYLOCK TO 

01:36:01.705 --> 01:36:06.975
SHOW MERCY, SAVED BOTH SHYLOCK 
AND ANTONIO'S LIVES WITH 

01:36:09.963 --> 01:36:12.433
SKILLFUL NAVIGATION OF VENETIAN 
LAW AND EVEN IF THE COURT DOES 

01:36:12.434 --> 01:36:19.887
NOT AGREE THAT THEY ACTED 
SINCERELY, THE APPELLE IN THIS 

01:36:19.888 --> 01:36:25.884
CASE IN THE CITY ALONE.  PORTIA 
WAS MERCIFUL AND IN THAT SPIRIT,

01:36:27.322 --> 01:36:34.517
 WOULD BE WHOLLY IN FAVOR OF 
THIS COURT REDUCING THE VENICE'S

01:36:34.678 --> 01:36:39.531
 ORDER THAT SHYLOCK CONVERT TO 
JUDAISM, JUST AS PORTIA WOULD 

01:36:40.425 --> 01:36:44.492
HAVE LIKED TO HAVE FREELY AND 
OPENLY PRACTICED LAW IN 16TH 

01:36:45.249 --> 01:36:48.133
CENTURY VENICE AND SO SHE 

01:36:57.554 --> 01:37:00.457
PERSISTED.  [APPLAUSE]. THANK 
YOU FOR YOUR GENEROUS TIME AND 

01:37:03.931 --> 01:37:05.931
YOUR MERCIFUL ATTENTION.  

01:37:26.828 --> 01:37:29.761
[APPLAUSE]. 
SPEAKER:  EACH COUNSEL WILL NOW 

01:37:26.828 --> 01:37:28.828
HAVE TWO MINUTES OF

01:37:40.437 --> 01:37:43.370
[APPLAUSE]. 
SPEAKER:  EACH COUNSEL WILL NOW 

01:37:40.437 --> 01:37:42.437
HAVE TWO MINUTES OF 

01:37:54.156 --> 01:38:27.708
REBUTTAL.  
SPEAKER:  YOUR HONOR, I'M GOING 

01:37:23.470 --> 01:37:27.614
TO BE VERY BRIEF.  BUT I WOULD 
LIKE TO ADDRESS A FACTUAL POINT 

01:37:27.615 --> 01:37:31.234
THAT I THINK IS VERY IMPORTANT 
THAT HAS COME UP.  COUNSEL FOR 

01:37:31.733 --> 01:37:36.147
ANTONIO AND FOR THE REPUBLIC OF 
VENICE HAS TRIED TO TOTALLY TURN

01:37:36.956 --> 01:37:42.620
 THE FACTS ON THEIR HEAD AND 
SOMEHOW ANTONIO HAS HAD THE 

01:37:42.621 --> 01:37:45.281
FINANCIAL WINDFALL AND FORCED 
SHYLOCK TO CONVERT TO 

01:37:45.618 --> 01:37:49.124
CHRISTIANITY, SOMEHOW HE IS THE 
VICTIM.  AND THERE REALLY ISN'T 

01:37:49.337 --> 01:37:52.933
ANY EVIDENCE IN THE RECORD TO 
SUPPORT THAT.  AND I WOULD LIKE 

01:37:53.140 --> 01:37:59.351
TO JUST POINT OUT TWO THINGS 
THAT JUSTICE GINSBURG POINTED US

01:38:02.569 --> 01:38:07.884
 TO.  OBVIOUSLY WHEN HE ENTERED 
INTO THIS BOND, HE NEVER THOUGHT

01:38:08.191 --> 01:38:11.880
 IT WOULD COME DUE.  HAD 
MULTIPLE SHIFTS AT SEA AND ONLY 

01:38:11.881 --> 01:38:16.473
THROUGH HIS BAD FORTUNE THAT THE
 BOND ITSELF CAME DUE.  AND THE 

01:38:16.474 --> 01:38:24.519
SECOND POINT IS THAT CHIEF 
JUSTICE GINSBURG POINTED OUT

01:38:27.544 --> 01:38:30.491
 THAT ANTONIO IS A MAN, AND IT 
DOESN'T MAKE A LOT OF SENSE THAT

01:38:30.492 --> 01:38:34.385
 HE HAS BEEN VICTIMIZED HERE.  
AND STRANGE ASPECT OF ALL THE 

01:38:34.386 --> 01:38:39.267
FACTS IS THAT AFTER THIS 
PROCEEDING WHERE ANTONIO HAS HAD

01:38:39.728 --> 01:38:44.286
 THIS INCREDIBLE VICTORY THAT 
TOTALLY HAS NO BASIS IN LAW, WE 

01:38:44.287 --> 01:38:48.666
DON'T SEE HIM CELEBRATING.  WE 
DON'T SEE HIM EXCLAIMING.  WE 

01:38:48.667 --> 01:38:54.578
REALLY NEVER SEE THAT.  AND SO, 
I WOULD JUST SUBMIT TO THE COURT

01:38:55.124 --> 01:39:01.982
 TO THE VIEW THAT HE HAS BEEN 
SOMEHOW VICTIMIZED BY MY CLIENT.

01:39:01.983 --> 01:39:06.287
  THANK YOU.  [APPLAUSE]. 
SPEAKER:  I HAVE TWO CLIENTS, 

01:39:06.473 --> 01:39:08.473
ANTONIO AND THE DUKE OF 

01:39:10.388 --> 01:39:12.637
VENICE. 
AND THE DUKE IS PRIMARILY 

01:39:14.930 --> 01:39:20.754
CONCERNED THAT JUSTICE BE DONE 
AND HE HAD NO IMAGINE OF THE 

01:39:22.826 --> 01:39:25.525
MASCERADE PORTIA.  AND HE ASKED 
ME TO MAKE THE POINT THAT THERE 

01:39:26.805 --> 01:39:32.371
WERE MISREPRESENTATIONS.  THE 
SO-CALLED LETTER OF DR. BELARIO 

01:39:32.947 --> 01:39:34.947
WHO WAS READ

01:39:36.252 --> 01:39:41.103
 IN COURT RECITES THAT BALTHIZAR
 VISITED HIM AND WENT OVER THE 

01:39:41.104 --> 01:39:46.545
COURT CASES AND THE LAW.  NOT 
THAT PORTIA HAD ANY 

01:39:46.546 --> 01:39:49.847
PARTICIPATION IN THAT.  AND THEN
 PORTIA SPEAKING TO 

01:39:53.899 --> 01:39:57.198
NURISSA, SAYS ABOUT THE UPCOMING
 MASSACRE

01:40:05.843 --> 01:40:09.401
MASSACRE, THAT OUR HUSBANDS WILL
 SEE US AND THINK SUCH 

01:40:09.402 --> 01:40:12.269
ACCOMPLISH IN WHAT WE LACK.  IN 
OTHER WORDS, SHE WAS ADMITTING 

01:40:12.270 --> 01:40:14.107
THAT SHE WAS NOT ACCOMPLISHED IN
 LAW.

01:40:14.108 --> 01:40:19.331
AND THAT SHE WOULD DRESS AS A 
LAWYER AND SEEMED TO BE 

01:40:19.835 --> 01:40:26.543
ACCOMPLISHED WITH WHAT SHE 
LACKED.  BUT THE BIG PICTURE IS 

01:40:26.766 --> 01:40:31.508
THIS.  SHYLOCK HAD A SCHEME TO 
MURDER ANTONIO.  A LEADING 

01:40:31.509 --> 01:40:39.302
CITIZEN OF VENICE.  HE COULD 
HAVE BEEN CONVICTED AND 

01:40:39.539 --> 01:40:44.524
EXECUTED.  THE DUKE SPARED HIS 
LIFE.  ANTONIO -- 

01:40:44.525 --> 01:40:48.601
SPEAKER:  WE WERE TOLD BY 
PORTIA'S COUNSEL THAT THE ALIEN 

01:40:49.067 --> 01:40:55.114
ACT WAS A CIVIL MEASURE.  
NOTHING ABOUT HANGING.  

01:40:55.115 --> 01:40:59.298
SPEAKER:  THE LAW, AS IT IS 
STATED IN THE RECORD, GIVES THE 

01:40:59.670 --> 01:41:04.896
DUKE ABSOLUTE DISCRETION AS TO 
WHETHER OR NOT TO HAVE EXECUTED 

01:41:04.897 --> 01:41:10.879
ANY PERSONS WHO VIOLATE THE 
ALIEN ACT.  NOT SIMPLY CIVIL 

01:41:10.880 --> 01:41:17.742
NATURE.  THE DUKE HERE WAS 
MERCIFUL.  ANTONIO HIMSELF GAVE 

01:41:17.923 --> 01:41:22.147
UP THE HALF SHARE OF SHYLOCK'S 
FORTUNE THAT HE COULD HAVE 

01:41:25.491 --> 01:41:29.332
CLAIMED ON THE MILD CONDITION 
THAT SHYLOCK GIVE IT TO HIS 

01:41:29.333 --> 01:41:33.324
DAUGHTER AND SON-IN-LAW UPON HIS
 DEATH.  JUSTICE WAS DONE HERE. 

01:41:35.425 --> 01:41:38.140
RECOGNIZE THAT.  THANK YOU.  
SPEAKER:  THANK YOU, COUNSEL.  

01:41:45.275 --> 01:41:49.289
[APPLAUSE]. 
SPEAKER:  I HAVE TO CLARIFY THE 

01:41:49.977 --> 01:41:53.154
ACT ABOUT BEING A CIVIL FORCEFUL
 MEASURE.  

01:41:53.155 --> 01:41:58.132
SPEAKER:  YOUR HONOR, THE POINT 
THERE -- SO THE ALIEN ACT DOES 

01:41:58.511 --> 01:42:03.079
SAY THAT ANY NON-CITIZEN OF 
VENICE WHO INTENDS -- WHO 

01:42:04.041 --> 01:42:07.923
ATTEMPTS MURDER OR COMMITS 
MURDER, EITHER DIRECTLY OR 

01:42:10.188 --> 01:42:12.188
INDIRECTLY COULD BE

01:42:13.310 --> 01:42:17.963
 PUNISHABLE BY DEATH OR 
FORFEITURE OF THE STATE AND 

01:42:17.964 --> 01:42:23.100
PORTIA DESCRIBED TO THE DUKE OF 
VENICE.  AND IT NEVER WENT TO A 

01:42:23.101 --> 01:42:27.477
CRIMINAL MATTER.
THERE ARE VERY DISCRETE STEPS IN

01:42:27.478 --> 01:42:31.773
 VENICE, STARTING WELL BELOW THE
 16TH CENTURY AND HOW CRIMINAL 

01:42:31.944 --> 01:42:35.587
CASES ARE HANDLED.  AND THEY ARE
 NOT CONVERTED FROM A CIVIL CASE

01:42:35.588 --> 01:42:39.659
 TO A CRIMINAL CASE ON THE FLY 
IN A COURTROOM.  THERE ARE 

01:42:39.660 --> 01:42:42.775
TRAINED PROSECUTORS THAT BRING 
CHARGES. 

01:42:42.776 --> 01:42:47.192
AND THERE ARE SEPARATE TRIALS IN
 CRIMINAL MATTERS IN VENICE IN 

01:42:47.193 --> 01:42:52.578
THE 16TH CENTURY.  WHAT HAPPENED
 HERE IS THAT THE LAW WAS 

01:42:53.373 --> 01:42:56.760
INTERPRETED AS A CIVIL 
FORFEITURE CASE.  SHYLOCK WAS 

01:42:57.481 --> 01:43:03.360
NEVER IN JEOPARDY OF LOSING HIS 
LIFE OR LOSING HIS LIBERTY.  

01:43:03.514 --> 01:43:08.522
SIMPLY OF SIMPLE FORFEITURE OF 
THE STATE.  I WOULD LIKE TO 

01:43:08.925 --> 01:43:11.452
ADDRESS NOW THE TWO POINTS THAT 

01:43:15.124 --> 01:43:23.281
CO-APELLEE FOR ANTONIO RAISED.  
FIRST, THE DUKE SAID HE WAS 

01:43:23.759 --> 01:43:33.712
RECEIVING LEGAL ADVICE FROM 
BELTHAZAR AND CO-APPELLEE IS 

01:43:34.146 --> 01:43:40.501
BRINGING GENDER INTO THIS CASE. 
SOMEONE WHO WAS TRAINED IN THE 

01:43:41.537 --> 01:43:43.537
LAW NAMED BELTHAZAR AND 

01:43:45.899 --> 01:43:48.246
DR. BELARIO KNEW WELL THAT 

01:43:51.326 --> 01:43:56.183
PORTIA WAS HIDING HERSELF BY 
BELTHAZAR AND AS A WOMAN, HAS NO

01:43:56.633 --> 01:44:00.395
 BEARING ON THIS CASE NO MATTER 
WHAT IT WAS.  SECOND, COUNSEL 

01:44:01.548 --> 01:44:03.548
FOR ANTONIO JUST REFERRED TO ACT

01:44:07.723 --> 01:44:09.723
 4 SCENE THREE LINE 59. 

01:44:14.389 --> 01:44:16.389
 WHERE NARISSA AND PORTIA, ARE 
PREPARING TO

01:44:19.894 --> 01:44:25.357
 GO TO THE TRIAL.  
WHERE PORTIA IS PREPARING TO 

01:44:25.756 --> 01:44:30.656
DISGUISE HERSELF AS A MAN, TO 
PUT ON JUDICIAL ROBES AS WE HAVE

01:44:31.309 --> 01:44:37.669
 ON TODAY.  WHICH CAN HIDE 
ANYONE'S GENDER.  NARISSA ASKS 

01:44:38.175 --> 01:44:41.521
PORTIA, SHALL THEY SEE US?  
REFERRING TO THEIR HUSBANDS.  

01:44:41.522 --> 01:44:48.473
AND PORTIA RESPONDS, IN FULL, 
THEY SHALL, NARISSA, BUT IN SUCH

01:44:48.739 --> 01:44:52.045
 A HABIT THAT THEY SHALL THINK 
THAT WE ARE ACCOMPLISHED WITH 

01:44:52.046 --> 01:44:59.245
WHAT WE LACK.  I WILL HOLD THEE 
ANY WAGER WHEN WE ARE LIKE YOUNG

01:44:59.680 --> 01:45:03.574
 MEN.  I'LL PROVE THE PRETTIER 
FELLOW OF THE TWO.  SHE WAS NOT 

01:45:03.903 --> 01:45:11.644
-- PORTIA WAS NOT REFERRING TO 
THEIR LEGAL EDUCATION.  PORTIA 

01:45:12.239 --> 01:45:14.239
WAS REFERRING TO WHAT WOULD BE 

01:45:17.346 --> 01:45:21.471
HIDDEN UNDERNEATH THE ROBES.  
UNLESS THIS COURT HAS ANY 

01:45:21.765 --> 01:45:24.941
ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS, WE WILL 
REST ON THE PREVIOUS STATEMENTS 

01:45:25.329 --> 01:45:29.724
MADE IN TERMS OF WHAT PORTIA 
DESIRES FROM THIS COURT.  

01:45:29.725 --> 01:45:33.214
SPEAKER:  THANK YOU, COUNSEL.  

01:45:41.864 --> 01:45:42.058
SPEAKER:  THANK YOU.  
[APPLAUSE]. 

01:45:42.059 --> 01:45:44.059
SPEAKER:  THE COURT WILL TAKE A 
RECESS TO

01:45:48.500 --> 01:45:50.500
 CONFER ON THIS CASE. 

01:47:11.846 --> 01:47:59.779
SPEAKER: HI.  THIS IS A LITTLE 
DIFFERENT THAN AN ORDINARY COURT

01:46:28.113 --> 01:46:31.618
 PROCEEDING IN WHICH NOW WOULD 
BE THE TIME TO GET A CUP OF 

01:46:31.619 --> 01:46:37.963
COFFEE, CHECK YOUR SMART PHONES,
 AND TRY TO GUESS HOW LONG IT 

01:46:37.964 --> 01:46:43.474
WILL BE BEFORE THE JUSTICES 
RETURN.  I HAVE BEEN TASKED WITH

01:46:43.475 --> 01:46:48.197
 TWO THINGS.  ONE, TO KEEP YOU 
ENTERTAINED UNTIL THEY DO IN 

01:46:48.729 --> 01:46:54.580
FACT RETURN, AND THE OTHER IS TO
 PROVIDE A LITTLE INCITE AND 

01:46:55.483 --> 01:46:59.964
BACKGROUND AS A LITERARY AND 
CULTURAL HISTORIAN INTO THE PLAY

01:47:00.528 --> 01:47:08.687
 AND INTO THE WAY IT MATTERED 
BOTH IN SHAKESPEARE'S DAY AND IN

01:47:08.832 --> 01:47:12.637
 OUR OWN.  IT'S TRICKY, THOUGH, 
JUST TO GUESS HOW LONG THEY ARE 

01:47:13.108 --> 01:47:18.428
GOING TO DELIBERATE.  AND I WAS 
IN VENICE WHEN JUSTICE

01:47:21.445 --> 01:47:25.733
 GINSBURG TOOK ON THIS ROLE LAST
 YEAR.  I AM JUST GUESSTIMATING.

01:47:25.734 --> 01:47:30.329
  I HAVE BEEN INSTRUCTED THAT IF
 MY 14 TO 15 MINUTES OF SPEAKING

01:47:30.677 --> 01:47:35.606
 DOES NOT COVER, I'M GOING TO 
TAKE QUESTIONS FROM THE AUDIENCE

01:47:36.102 --> 01:47:39.610
 UNTIL THEY DO RETURN.  BUT I AM
 HOPING TO TIME IT JUST RIGHT.  

01:47:39.823 --> 01:47:43.284
ABOUT 20 YEARS AGO I WROTE A 
BOOK CALLED SHAKESPEARE AND

01:47:48.020 --> 01:47:50.792
 THE JEWS.  AND ONE OF THE 
THINGS THAT I LEARNED IN WRITING

01:47:51.181 --> 01:47:59.212
 THAT BOOK WAS THE PERSISTENCE 
OF VARIOUS MYTHS THAT HAVE 

01:47:59.213 --> 01:48:01.664
ATTACHED THEMSELVES TO THE 
CONNECTION OF SHAKESPEARE AND 

01:48:01.865 --> 01:48:05.030
JEWS.  TWO OF 

01:48:10.847 --> 01:48:17.985
THOSE MYTHS CONCERN THE 
EXPULSION OF THE JEWS IN 1290 

01:48:17.986 --> 01:48:24.878
AND THE READMISSION IN 1656.  AS
 POINTED OUT, THERE WAS NO 

01:48:25.213 --> 01:48:28.062
READMISSION IN 1656 AND IN FACT 
THERE IS NO 

01:48:31.440 --> 01:48:36.997
EXPULSION ORDER IN 1290 AND LATE
 MID EVIL AND MODERN ENGLAND IS 

01:48:36.998 --> 01:48:39.906
POORLY UNDERSTOOD AND OFTEN 
MISREPRESENTED.  YET ANOTHER 

01:48:40.323 --> 01:48:43.455
MYTH IS THAT THERE WERE NO JEWS 
IN ENGLAND IN SHAKESPEARE'S DAY.

01:48:43.709 --> 01:48:50.523
HISTORIANS HAVE SHOWN THAT THERE
 ABOUT 150 TO 200 JEWS LIVING IN

01:48:50.524 --> 01:48:58.153
 LONDON AND BRISTO IN 
ELIZABETHIAN, ENGLAND AND HAD 

01:48:58.452 --> 01:49:02.289
SHAKESPEARE WANTED TO SPEAK TO 
ONE.  HE COULD HAVE WENT TO A 

01:49:03.028 --> 01:49:09.205
CONVERT'S HOUSE ON HOLBORN 
STREET AND SPOKE TO A MAN 

01:49:11.302 --> 01:49:15.919
NETANYAL AND CONVERTED IN LONDON
 BY JOHN FOX, MORE FAMOUS FOR 

01:49:15.920 --> 01:49:20.453
HIS ACTS AND MONUMENTS.  BUT 
ALSO A MAN WHO TOOK PLEASURE IN 

01:49:20.710 --> 01:49:23.583
CONVERTING A NORTH AFRICAN JEW 
AND CELEBRATING THAT

01:49:29.158 --> 01:49:32.505
 BEFORE HIS CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY.
  BUT I WOULD MUCH RATHER TALK 

01:49:32.506 --> 01:49:36.597
TODAY LESS ABOUT THE HISTORY OF 
JEWS IN ENGLAND AND

01:49:41.903 --> 01:49:46.880
 WAYS OF WHICH SOMEONE LIKE ME 
WHO HAS BEEN TEACHING PLAYS FOR 

01:49:46.881 --> 01:49:51.114
YEARS AND ON THE ATLANTIC SIDE 
OF IT, THAT EVEN THE MOST 

01:49:51.115 --> 01:49:56.891
BRILLIANT MINDS SEE IT.  SO I 
WILL TRY TO SHARE THAT WITH YOU.

01:49:56.892 --> 01:50:01.662
  THE DISCUSSION THAT WE HAVE 
HEARD QUITE BRILLIANTLY FOR THE 

01:50:01.663 --> 01:50:07.854
LAST HOUR OR SO, CONCERNS THE 
FAMOUS COURTROOM SCENE IN ACT 4 

01:50:07.855 --> 01:50:15.740
OF SHAKESPEARE'S PLAY.  I SEE IT
 IN A RADICALLY DIFFERENT WAY.  

01:50:15.943 --> 01:50:19.086
CONSIDER PORTIA'S SITUATION.  
SHE HAS BEEN MARRIED FOR A VERY 

01:50:19.445 --> 01:50:24.935
BRIEF TIME TO A VERY HAND SOME 
MAN THAT SHE HAS LONG WANTED TO 

01:50:25.293 --> 01:50:29.974
MARRY.  AND IN THE TIME BETWEEN 
THE MOMENT WHERE HE SUCCESSFULLY

01:50:30.113 --> 01:50:35.088
 CHOSE THE RIGHT CASKET AND THE 
MOMENT THAT SHE SPEAKS HER 

01:50:35.437 --> 01:50:38.275
FAMOUS LINES ABOUT THE QUALITY 
OF MERCY, SHE HAS DISCOVERED 

01:50:38.440 --> 01:50:41.750
THAT THE MAN SHE IS HOPING AND 
PLANNING TO SPEND THE REST OF 

01:50:41.927 --> 01:50:47.674
HER LIFE WITH, IS DEEPLY AND 
EMOTIONALLY CONNECTED TO SOMEONE

01:50:48.081 --> 01:50:54.625
 ELSE.  AND IF SHE HAS ANY 
DOUBTS ABOUT THAT, SHE LEARNS IT

01:50:54.805 --> 01:50:59.780
 AT THIS TRIAL.  HERE IS WHAT 
ANTONIO SAYS TO HER HUSBAND, 

01:51:00.118 --> 01:51:07.413
MOMENTS BEFORE SHE DELIVERS THAT
 FAMOUS SPEECH.  THIS IS ANTONIO

01:51:07.764 --> 01:51:13.413
 TO BESANIO.  COMMEND ME TO YOUR
 HONORABLE WIFE.  TELL HER THE 

01:51:14.443 --> 01:51:19.999
PROSPECTS OF ANTONIO'S END.  SAY
 HOW I LOVED YOU.  SPEAK ME FAIR

01:51:20.460 --> 01:51:28.722
 IN DEATH AND WHEN THE TALE IS 
TOLD, LET HER BE JUDGE.  WHEN 

01:51:29.038 --> 01:51:35.126
BESANIO IS NOT JUST LOVE.  
REPENT THAT YOU SHALL LOSE YOUR 

01:51:35.127 --> 01:51:41.816
FRIEND AND HE REPENTS NOT.  AND 
IF IT IS DEEP ENOUGH, I WILL PAY

01:51:42.321 --> 01:51:45.901
 IT PRESENTLY WITH ALL OF MY 
HEART.  AND IF SHE HAS ANY 

01:51:46.462 --> 01:51:48.777
DOUBTS AT THIS POINT ABOUT 
ANTONIO'S INTENTIONS FOR HER 

01:51:48.778 --> 01:51:54.221
HUSBAND, THIS IS BESANIO'S 
RESPONSE DELIVERED BEFORE HER, 

01:51:54.458 --> 01:51:58.224
ALTHOUGH HE DOESN'T KNOW THAT 
PORTIA IS DISGUISED AND IN 

01:51:59.122 --> 01:52:02.721
COURT.  ANTONIO, I AM MARRIED TO
 A WIFE WHICH IS AS DEAR TO ME 

01:52:02.722 --> 01:52:06.665
AS LIFE ITSELF.  BUT LIFE 
ITSELF, MY WIFE AND ALL THE 

01:52:06.666 --> 01:52:14.182
WORLD ARE NOT WITH ME ESTEEMED 
ABOVE THY LIFE.  I WOULD 

01:52:14.183 --> 01:52:18.436
SACRIFICE THEM ALL, THIS DEVIL, 
TO DELIVER YOU.

01:52:18.437 --> 01:52:24.322
WHAT IS PORTIA TO DO?  I MEAN, 
IF SHE KILLS ANTONIO, JUST 

01:52:24.323 --> 01:52:28.293
IMAGINE WHAT SHE WILL BE HEARING
 FOR THE REST OF HER LIFE FROM 

01:52:28.453 --> 01:52:31.165
BESANIO.  HE LOVED ME SO MUCH.  
MORE THAN YOU DID.  I DON'T KNOW

01:52:31.357 --> 01:52:37.635
 WHY I ENDED UP WITH YOU AND NOT
 HIM.  SHE CAN'T LET ANTONIO 

01:52:37.944 --> 01:52:41.901
DIE.
BUT IF SHE LET'S ANTONIO LIVE, 

01:52:42.735 --> 01:52:46.953
SHE IS STUCK IN A LOVE TRIANGLE 
THAT SHE COULD NEVER GET OUT OF.

01:52:47.519 --> 01:52:55.010
THE BRILLIANCE OF PORTIA IN THIS
 SCENE IS THAT SHE RESORTS TO A 

01:52:58.506 --> 01:53:03.082
LEGAL FICTION, HER MARRIAGE.  IN
 SUGGESTING THIS, I AM REALLY 

01:53:03.367 --> 01:53:09.106
SAYING THAT IN THE MOMENT THAT 
IT WAS FIRST STAGED AND FOR THE 

01:53:09.947 --> 01:53:12.537
FOUR CENTURIES AFTER IT WAS 
FIRST WRITTEN, THE MERCHANT OF 

01:53:13.232 --> 01:53:16.982
VENICE REMAINS A REALLY COMPLEX 
AND DEEP WORK OF ART THAT RAISES

01:53:17.451 --> 01:53:20.382
 MANY MORE QUESTIONS THAN WE CAN

01:53:23.690 --> 01:53:27.421
ANSWER EVEN IN THIS MOOD COURT. 
IT'S TO DISGUISE PORTIA'S 

01:53:28.002 --> 01:53:30.938
QUESTION ON ENTERING THE COURT. 
WHICH IS THE MERCHANT HERE?  AND

01:53:31.194 --> 01:53:36.657
 WHICH IS THE JEW TO BE TAKEN 
SERIOUSLY?  OR WITHIN SO MANY 

01:53:37.101 --> 01:53:45.953
PRODUCTIONS IS IT A LIFE LINE?  
AS JUSTICE GINSBURG INDICATED 

01:53:46.662 --> 01:53:55.840
EARLIER, IS PORTIA A RACIST FOR 
A DARK SKINNED MUSLIM MOROCCON 

01:53:56.304 --> 01:53:59.506
PRINCE.  IS ANTONIO SO SAD 
BECAUSE OF HIS FINANCIAL WORRIES

01:53:59.807 --> 01:54:02.149
 OR BECAUSE OF HIS UNSANCTIONED 
LOVE FOR

01:54:05.288 --> 01:54:09.960
 BESANIO WHICH REMAINS. 
IS THE PLACE SO TROUBLING 

01:54:10.296 --> 01:54:16.359
BECAUSE MANY FELT ITS PORTRAYAL 
OF SHYLOCK IS NAKEDLY 

01:54:17.131 --> 01:54:20.196
ANTI-SEMITIC OR IS IT SO 
DISTURBING BECAUSE IT DISPOSES 

01:54:20.652 --> 01:54:25.631
WHAT UGLY MYTHS LEAVE THOSE WITH
 INSECURE IDENTITIES, BE IT 

01:54:26.582 --> 01:54:29.834
CHRISTIAN OR JEW, TO THINK AND 
DO WHEN THREATENED AND HOSTILITY

01:54:30.943 --> 01:54:36.564
 OF ALL KINDS, WHETHER THAT 
DIFFERENCE IS RACIAL, NATIONAL, 

01:54:36.743 --> 01:54:42.024
SEXUAL OR RELIGIOUS, REFORMS 
THOSE WHO ARE INTOLERANT AND 

01:54:42.401 --> 01:54:44.218
ENFORCES ANY SOCIETY THAT 
QUESTIONS IT.  THESE ARE THE 

01:54:44.219 --> 01:54:47.701
QUESTIONS THAT DON'T GO AWAY.  
AND FOR ME, AS A CULTURE 

01:54:48.204 --> 01:54:50.753
HISTORIAN AND THEATER HISTORIAN,
 WHAT IS FASCINATING IS HOW THEY

01:54:51.452 --> 01:54:54.908
 MANIFEST THEMSELVES IN 
DIFFERENT TIMES AND IN DIFFERENT

01:54:55.238 --> 01:54:59.893
 PLACES.  
IN NAZI, GERMANY, THIS WAS A 

01:55:00.192 --> 01:55:03.798
FAVORED PLAY.  STAGED 50 
DIFFERENT TIMES AND DIFFERENT 

01:55:04.210 --> 01:55:06.610
PRODUCTIONS.  ALTHOUGH THOSE 
PRODUCTIONS DID NOT ALLOW FOR 

01:55:07.223 --> 01:55:12.147
THE INTERMARRIAGE OF JESSICA AND
 LORENZO.  SOME OF YOU MAY BE 

01:55:12.845 --> 01:55:19.391
FAMILIAR IN THE LAST WEEK OR SO,
 WITH A PROTEST AND CONTROVERSY 

01:55:23.157 --> 01:55:26.675
AT THE DELACORE THEATER IN 
CENTRAL PARK WHERE SHAKESPEARE 

01:55:27.586 --> 01:55:30.013
PLAYS HAVE BEEN PERFORMED AND 
THERE WAS VERY AGGRESSIVE 

01:55:31.221 --> 01:55:33.129
PROTESTS THAT TRIED TO STOP THAT
 PRODUCTION.  THAT WAS THE 

01:55:33.130 --> 01:55:35.130
PRODUCTION OF

01:55:36.331 --> 01:55:42.355
 JULIUS CEASOR AND SOME OF YOU 
MAY BE LESS AWARE IN 1962, THE 

01:55:42.356 --> 01:55:46.857
FIRST YEAR IN WHICH THAT THEATER
 IN CENTRAL PARK STAGED PLAYS, 

01:55:46.858 --> 01:55:50.471
IT WAS A DIFFERENT PROTEST, A 
PROTEST ABOUT THE MERCHANT OF 

01:55:51.182 --> 01:55:56.790
VENICE.  AND AN ATTEMPT TO STOP 
THE WIDE CIRCULATION AND 

01:55:56.791 --> 01:56:03.303
DEMONSTRATION OF THAT PLAY.  JOE
 PAP IN THAT YEAR HAD THE 

01:56:05.078 --> 01:56:09.559
EXTRAORDINARY ACTOR AS SHYLOCK. 
 AND SCOTT'S PORTRAYAL OF 

01:56:09.560 --> 01:56:13.428
SHYLOCK WAS A REALLY SYMPATHETIC
 ONE.  HE LATER SAID AND I 

01:56:13.837 --> 01:56:16.916
QUOTE, I PLAYED SHYLOCK AS 
THOUGH HE WAS DEAD RIGHT AND 

01:56:16.917 --> 01:56:21.357
THAT HE WAS SCREWED.  BUT THERE 
WERE OBJECTIONS NONETHELESS, TO 

01:56:21.518 --> 01:56:27.593
PERFORMING THIS PLAY IN 1962.  
17 YEARS AFTER THE END OF THE 

01:56:28.563 --> 01:56:33.313
SECOND WORLD WAR, AND THE 
EXPOSURE OF THE HOLOCAUST.  

01:56:33.314 --> 01:56:37.438
MEMBERS OF THE JEWISH WAR 
VETERANS PICKETED.  AND THE NEW 

01:56:37.439 --> 01:56:42.319
YORK BOARD OF RABBIS WROTE TO 
THE NEW YORK TIMES, TRYING TO 

01:56:42.320 --> 01:56:47.321
STOP A TELECAST OF THAT 
PRODUCTION WHICH WOULD HAVE GONE

01:56:47.531 --> 01:56:52.308
 OUT TO 2 MILLION TELEVISION 
VIEWERS.  THE RABBIS WROTE AND I

01:56:52.864 --> 01:56:58.228
 QUOTE, TO PUT IT BLUNTY, THE 
PLAY WITH SHYLOCK AS A TYPICAL 

01:56:59.187 --> 01:57:04.479
JEW AMOUNTS TO DISTORTION AND 
DEFAMATION TO THE PEOPLE OF OUR 

01:57:05.126 --> 01:57:07.126
FAITH.  WHILE I RESPECT THEIR 
CONCERNS I BELIEVE THEIR 

01:57:07.449 --> 01:57:10.402
POSITION IS WRONG.  AND I'LL 
SUGGEST THROUGH A FINAL EXAMPLE 

01:57:10.403 --> 01:57:15.097
WHY IT IS SO DANGEROUSLY SO.  
AND WHY WE NEED TO KEEP STAGING 

01:57:15.459 --> 01:57:20.060
AND NOT CENSORING SHAKESPEARE.  
WHEN I FINISHED WRITING MY BOOK,

01:57:20.710 --> 01:57:23.946
 SHAKESPEARE AND THE JEW, I TOOK
 A TRIP TO ISRAEL, AND IT WAS 

01:57:24.132 --> 01:57:28.497
BACK IN 1994.  AND I WENT TO SEE
 A PRODUCTION OF THE MERCHANT OF

01:57:28.824 --> 01:57:36.012
 VENICE AT THE CAMORY THEATER IN
 TEL AVIS.  IT WAS PRETTY WEIRD 

01:57:37.754 --> 01:57:43.243
AT FIRST.  MY HEBREW IS NOT VERY
 GOOD.  IT TOOK A WHILE.  AND 

01:57:43.244 --> 01:57:47.494
THE ACTOR PLAYING SHYLOCK BEGAN 
IN THE EARLY SCENES OF THE PLAY,

01:57:47.730 --> 01:57:52.300
 AS A SECULAR JEW, HIS HEAD 
UNCOVERED WEARING A NICE SUIT.  

01:57:52.301 --> 01:57:56.116
BUT WHEN HIS DAUGHTER JESSICA 
WAS STOLEN AWAY FROM HIM, HE 

01:57:57.012 --> 01:58:04.798
BECAME RADICALIZED AND HE 
STARTED WEARING THE CIPA, OR THE

01:58:04.799 --> 01:58:09.426
 HEAD COVER OF THE JEW, AND HE 
BECAME AGGRESSIVELY FURIOUS AT 

01:58:10.415 --> 01:58:14.699
EVERYBODY SPRAYING AN 
IMAGINATION OOZY AT EVERYBODY 

01:58:15.713 --> 01:58:17.746
INVOLVED.  AND IT BECAME A VERY 
DISTURBING PRODUCTION.  AND IT 

01:58:17.940 --> 01:58:23.141
WAS A DISTURBING PRODUCTION IN 
PART BECAUSE THE DIRECTOR HAD 

01:58:23.142 --> 01:58:26.240
DONE THIS INTENTIONALLY TO DRAW 
ATTENTION TO WHAT HAD HAPPENED 

01:58:26.529 --> 01:58:31.312
WHILE THIS PLAY WAS BEING 
REHEARSED.  AND THAT WAS AN 

01:58:31.531 --> 01:58:34.457
ATTACK BY SOMEONE LIKE ME WHO 
HAD BEEN BORN IN BROOKLYN AND 

01:58:34.705 --> 01:58:40.590
ACTUALLY GONE TO MY ELEMENTARY 
SCHOOL BARUCH GOLDSTEIN WHO HAD 

01:58:40.591 --> 01:58:42.591
ENTERED THE TOMB OF THE 

01:58:44.837 --> 01:58:49.861
PATRIACHS AND KILLED 
PALESTINIANS AND INJURED 

01:58:49.997 --> 01:58:53.924
HUNDREDS OF OTHERS, AND IT WAS 
TRYING TO ENGAGE WITH THAT IN A 

01:58:54.601 --> 01:58:56.636
VERY DIRECT WAY.  ONE OF THE 
THINGS THAT I LOVE ABOUT THEATER

01:58:57.387 --> 01:59:03.041
 AND SHAKESPEARE IN PARTICULAR 
IS THE WAY IN WHICH THESE WORKS 

01:59:03.042 --> 01:59:07.581
ARE SOMEHOW ABLE TO GET AT 
THINGS WHICH NEWSPAPERS, RADIO, 

01:59:07.582 --> 01:59:12.901
MEDIA TODAY DON'T GET AT.  THEY 
HAVE, IF YOU WILL, A PREDICTIVE 

01:59:13.128 --> 01:59:19.465
QUALITY.  AND ONE OF THE THINGS 
THAT I ENJOYED SO MUCH ABOUT THE

01:59:21.034 --> 01:59:24.033
 MOOD COURT THAT I TOUCHED SO 
MUCH UPON TODAY, ARE MANY OF THE

01:59:24.274 --> 01:59:28.609
 ESSENTIAL ISSUES THAT WE ARE 
STILL WRESTLING WITH TODAY.  

01:59:28.770 --> 01:59:33.170
ACCESS TO EDUCATION, ALIENS, THE
 RIGHTS OF WOMAN TO EQUAL 

01:59:33.320 --> 01:59:36.184
EDUCATION AND THE LIKE.  THIS 
PRODUCTION AT THE CAMERY THEATER

01:59:36.562 --> 01:59:42.025
 IN 1994 ALSO STRANGELY HAD A 
PREDICTIVE QUALITY.  ABOUT SIX 

01:59:42.278 --> 01:59:47.574
OR EIGHT MONTHS AFTER I SAW THAT
 PRODUCTION, A MAN NAMED UGAL 

01:59:49.497 --> 01:59:55.311
AMIR CUT FROM THE VERY SAME 
CLOTH THAT SHYLOCK MORPHED INTO 

01:59:55.312 --> 02:00:01.448
SHOT RABBIN SHORTLY AFTER THE 
CORDS HAD BEEN SIGNED, AND PUT 

02:00:01.449 --> 02:00:03.940
AN END TO THAT POSSIBILITY OF 
PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST.  

02:00:03.941 --> 02:00:09.569
AND IT'S EXTRAORDINARY TO ME AS 
I STILL REFLECT ON IT, 20 SOME 

02:00:09.749 --> 02:00:15.457
ODD YEARS LATER, THE WAYS IN 
WHICH A PERFORMANCE OF 

02:00:15.771 --> 02:00:18.945
SHAKESPEARE'S PLAY CAN TELL US 
SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT IS BUBBLING

02:00:19.954 --> 02:00:23.896
 UP WITHIN THE CULTURE.  I'LL 
STOP AT THIS POINT.  AND I WILL 

02:00:24.278 --> 02:00:26.479
TAKE QUESTIONS FROM THE 
AUDIENCE.  THERE IS ONE IN THE 

02:00:26.480 --> 02:00:30.709
FRONT ROW.  I'M GOING TO DO, 
SINCE THIS IS BEING TAPED, IS I 

02:00:31.591 --> 02:00:34.073
WILL REPEAT THE QUESTION.  AND 
IF I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO 

02:00:34.353 --> 02:00:36.353
IT, I WILL TURN IT INTO A

02:00:43.652 --> 02:00:45.652
 QUESTION THAT I CAN ANSWER. 

02:00:51.404 --> 02:00:54.132
SURE.  THE QUESTION IS.  WHAT 
ABOUT THE FACT THAT SHAKESPEARE 

02:00:54.866 --> 02:00:59.562
WROTE THIS PLAY IN RESPONSE TO 
OR REBUTTAL TO CHRISTOPHER 

02:01:00.706 --> 02:01:05.347
MARLO'S PLAY THE JEW OF MALTA. 
THESE ARE REALLY VERY, VERY 

02:01:05.819 --> 02:01:10.221
DIFFERENT PLAYS.  AND YOU CAN 
SAY THAT HE WROTE THE PLAY IN 

02:01:10.569 --> 02:01:13.466
REBUTTAL TO.  SOME MIGHT BELIEVE
 THAT HE WROTE THE PLAY IN A 

02:01:13.467 --> 02:01:15.467
SENSE TO CAPITALIZE ON THE

02:01:17.704 --> 02:01:20.563
 INTEREST IN JEWISH QUESTION.  
I'M A JEWISH GUY FROM BROOKLYN. 

02:01:20.752 --> 02:01:24.945
BUT I'LL BE THE FIRST TO ADMIT 
THAT SHAKESPEARE AND MARLO

02:01:28.154 --> 02:01:31.626
 WERE NOT REALLY INTERESTED IN 
LIVING JEWS, EVEN THOUGH THERE 

02:01:31.627 --> 02:01:36.793
WERE 100 OR SO LIVING AMONGST 
THEM.  THEY WERE INTERESTED IN 

02:01:36.794 --> 02:01:42.541
JEWS BECAUSE JEWS ENABLED THEM 
TO UNDERSTAND THEIR OWN CULTURE 

02:01:42.542 --> 02:01:47.187
AT A MOMENT OF GREAT -- HOW 
SHOULD I PUT IT, GREAT CHANGE.  

02:01:47.188 --> 02:01:50.163
IN SHAKESPEARE'S DAY, 
EVERYBODY'S GRAND PARENTS HAD 

02:01:50.164 --> 02:01:53.275
BEEN CATHOLIC, A 

02:01:58.913 --> 02:02:00.913
PRODESTANT AND CHANGED BACK TO 

02:02:06.086 --> 02:02:09.747
CATHOLOCISM AND A RELIGION THAT 
WAS ONCE SO STABLE IS NOW 

02:02:11.242 --> 02:02:12.700
UNSTABLE.  
INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS BETWEEN 

02:02:12.701 --> 02:02:16.721
CHRISTIANS, JEWS AND MUSLIMS 
WERE FAR MORE COMPLICATED IN AGE

02:02:16.722 --> 02:02:24.420
 THAN OF EMPIRE.  AND NOTIONS OF
 WHAT CONSTITUTED A NATION OR A 

02:02:24.834 --> 02:02:32.224
RACE OR PEOPLE, ALL OF WHICH 
BUBBLE-UP IN PLAY AND ALL OF 

02:02:32.225 --> 02:02:34.225
WHICH WAS WRESTLING YEARS LATER.
AND COME INTO PLAY IN 

02:02:38.097 --> 02:02:41.530
MARLO'S WORK AND SHAKESPEARE.  
IT'S A REBUTTAL OF.  I WOULD SAY

02:02:41.675 --> 02:02:44.632
 THAT BOTH OF THESE PLAYS ARE 
WRITTEN AT A MOMENT OF 

02:02:44.633 --> 02:02:48.126
UNCERTAINTY.  
AND TWO OF THE GREATEST 

02:02:49.899 --> 02:02:53.292
DRAMATISTS WHO WROTE IN ENGLAND,
 RETURN THE QUESTION OF 

02:02:53.664 --> 02:02:58.019
JEWISHNESS AS A WAY TO TRY TO 
HELP ENGLISH PLAY GOERS AT THE 

02:02:58.791 --> 02:03:03.434
TIME, WRESTLE WITH THEIR OWN 
CONFLICTED IDENTITIES.  MORE 

02:03:03.435 --> 02:03:10.731
QUESTIONS?  AND HOPEFULLY 
JUSTICE GINSBURG WILL RETURN 

02:03:11.131 --> 02:03:13.131
WITH A VERDICT.  ANOTHER 
QUESTION?  I'LL COME FORWARD. 

02:03:17.267 --> 02:03:22.122
  WHAT DO I ATTRIBUTE THE 
INTENSE KNOWLEDGE THAT 

02:03:22.760 --> 02:03:28.546
SHAKESPEARE HAD OF THE LAW?  
SHAKESPEARE CARED ABOUT THE LAW 

02:03:28.704 --> 02:03:33.534
AND LIKE MANY IN HIS LETIGIOUS 
DAY, HAD A LOT OF LEGAL INTEREST

02:03:33.718 --> 02:03:37.026
 AND A LOT OF LEGAL 
CONTROVERSIES.  THIS WAS A MAN 

02:03:37.027 --> 02:03:42.697
WHO WROTE 36 OF THE GREATEST 
PLAYS IN ENGLISH AND ALSO 

02:03:44.039 --> 02:03:49.545
PURSUIT DEATH FOR 7 POUNDS.  HE 
ACTUALLY CARED.  BECAUSE HE WAS 

02:03:49.546 --> 02:03:52.324
INVOLVED IN SO MANY REAL ESTATE 
CASES, HE HAD A VEST AND 

02:03:52.325 --> 02:03:54.704
INTEREST IN THAT AND HAD A VEST 
AND INTEREST SECURING FOR HIS 

02:03:54.848 --> 02:03:59.940
FATHER, AND HEIRS, A CODE OF 
ARMS.  SO ALMOST EVERYWHERE 

02:04:00.231 --> 02:04:04.148
SHAKESPEARE TURNED IN THE PERIOD
 IN WHICH HE WAS A PLAY WRITE 

02:04:04.149 --> 02:04:08.466
AND A SHAREHOLDER IN A THEATER 
AND A JOINT STOCK COMPANY, HE 

02:04:08.467 --> 02:04:11.087
HAD VERY PARTICULAR LEGAL 
INTERESTS TO PROTECT AND I THINK

02:04:11.435 --> 02:04:15.550
 SHAKESPEARE WAS A PRETTY FAST 
STUDY AND I THINK HE WAS A 

02:04:15.551 --> 02:04:18.644
PRETTY FAST STUDY WHEN IT CAME 
TO THE LAW AND I THINK HE WAS 

02:04:18.645 --> 02:04:22.601
THE BEST LISTENER. 
WE DON'T ATTRIBUTE SHAKESPEARE'S

02:04:23.352 --> 02:04:26.550
 LISTENING ABILITIES AS HIGH AS 
WE ATTRIBUTE HIS WRITING 

02:04:26.767 --> 02:04:29.611
ABILITIES, I SUPPOSE.  BUT I'M 
SURE HE SAT DOWN WITH MORE THAN 

02:04:29.869 --> 02:04:34.179
ONE OR TWO LAWYERS AND BOUGHT 
THEM DRINKS AND PUMPED THEM FOR 

02:04:34.180 --> 02:04:37.440
ALL OF THE INFORMATION HE COULD 
GET.  NONE QUITE AS BRILLIANT AS

02:04:37.644 --> 02:04:39.644
 JUSTICE

02:04:41.439 --> 02:04:44.135
 GINSBURG BUT ENOUGH TO WRITE 
QUESTIONS LIKE THIS.  NEXT 

02:04:44.136 --> 02:04:45.618
QUESTION PLEASE.  
SPEAKER:  I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS. 

02:04:45.619 --> 02:04:51.632
ONE, DO YOU THINK THERE IS ANY 
CONNECTION TO THE THEORY THAT 

02:04:52.156 --> 02:04:55.132
SHAKESPEARE'S FAMILY WAS SECRET 
CATHOLICS?  AND TWO, HOW WOULD 

02:05:00.502 --> 02:05:04.392
YOU SUMMARIZE THE MAJORITY OF 
LITERARY CRITIC VIEW OF SHYLOCK,

02:05:04.993 --> 02:05:09.593
 GIVEN THAT THE SPEECH HAVE NOT 
A JEW, EYES, ET CETERA, IS IT

02:05:15.530 --> 02:05:19.732
 BY AND LARGE THROUGH THE AGES 
ESPECIALLY IN THE 20 AND 21ST 

02:05:20.342 --> 02:05:24.724
CENTURY, POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE. 
SPEAKER:  I'LL ANSWER THE FIRST 

02:05:25.637 --> 02:05:30.049
QUESTION FIRST.  WE HAVE NO IDEA
 WHAT SHAKESPEARE'S POLITICAL 

02:05:30.215 --> 02:05:34.545
BELIEFS WERE.  WE DON'T KNOW 
WHETHER HE LIKED DOGS OR CATS OR

02:05:34.546 --> 02:05:39.080
 WHAT.  ALL WE HAVE IS 36 PLAYS 
AND BIOGRAPHICAL EVIDENCE AND 

02:05:39.406 --> 02:05:43.107
ONE OF THE DANGERS IS LEAVING 
THE LIGHT OUT OF THE WORK.  WHAT

02:05:43.830 --> 02:05:46.273
 IS DANGEROUS, DOESN'T SPEAK 
WHAT HIS VIEWS ARE IN THE PLAYS.

02:05:46.274 --> 02:05:52.341
  HE CREATES CHARACTERS WHO 
EXPRESS VIEWS WHICH TEND TO 

02:05:52.342 --> 02:05:56.584
COLLIDE WITH OTHER VIEWS.  AND 
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS LOST 

02:05:56.585 --> 02:06:03.730
WHEN I'M SITTING IN THE HOUSE AT
 THE DELECOURT, LISTENING TO 

02:06:03.731 --> 02:06:06.685
PEOPLE CONFUSED ABOUT 
IDENTIFYING SHAKESPEARE'S VIEWS 

02:06:06.686 --> 02:06:16.636
OF TERRONY VISA VIE CEASOR.  
SHAKESPEARE HIDES HIS OWN VIEWS.

02:06:16.637 --> 02:06:20.308
  AND IF HE WANTED TO EXPRESS 
THEM, HE COULD HAVE BEEN THE 

02:06:20.309 --> 02:06:23.586
GREATEST PREACHER OF HIS DAY.  
BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT HE DECIDED 

02:06:23.587 --> 02:06:27.276
TO DO FOR A LIVE.  
THANK GOD.  THE SECOND QUESTION 

02:06:28.384 --> 02:06:35.565
IS WHAT DO SHAKESPEARENS THINK 
OF SHYLOCK?  ARE THEY PRO OR 

02:06:35.566 --> 02:06:39.060
CON?  I HAVE TO TELL YOU.  
MONDAYS, WEDNESDAYS AND FRIDAYS 

02:06:39.061 --> 02:06:43.542
I AM SYMPATHETIC TO HIM AND 
TUESDAYS, THURSDAYS AND SUNDAYS 

02:06:43.886 --> 02:06:47.778
I AM LESS SO.  I THINK FOR ME, 
THE HONEST ANSWER TO THAT 

02:06:48.023 --> 02:06:53.596
QUESTION IS, WHAT IS MORE 
IMPORTANT IS TO SEE WHAT THE 

02:06:53.597 --> 02:06:56.806
PLAY MEANS IN HISTORY.  HOW IT 
SPILLS OUT IN DIFFERENT TIMES 

02:06:57.428 --> 02:07:02.526
AND DIFFERENT PLACES.  THERE IS 
A WONDERFUL FILM, LITTLE KNOWN 

02:07:02.894 --> 02:07:08.462
IN PART BECAUSE IT'S IN HEBREW 
THAT CAME OUT AFTER THE 6TH DAY 

02:07:08.463 --> 02:07:14.277
WAR AND IT'S AVANTI POPULO AND 
ONE OF THE GREATEST MOMENTS THAT

02:07:14.278 --> 02:07:18.465
 TOUCHED ON THIS PLAY.  AND IN 
THIS PLAY, ISRAELI TUNE HAS 

02:07:19.651 --> 02:07:25.547
DEFEATED IN THE SINAI DESERT, 
THE EGYPTIAN ONES, SCRIPTED IN 

02:07:25.707 --> 02:07:30.893
THE '67 WAR AND THE EGYPTIAN 
SOLDIERS ARE DYING OF THIRST.  

02:07:31.092 --> 02:07:36.563
AND THE EGYPTIAN SOLDIER WHO IS 
AN ACTOR IN REAL LIFE, GOES UP 

02:07:37.080 --> 02:07:39.080
AND TRIES TO GRAB

02:07:43.926 --> 02:07:49.583
 A CANTEEN OF ONE OF THE ISRAELI
 SOLDIERS AND PICKED UP AND 

02:07:49.584 --> 02:07:53.436
DROPPED AGAIN.  
THEY SPEAK ARABIC.  THEY SPEAK 

02:07:54.314 --> 02:07:57.092
HEBREW.  ENGLISH IS THE ONLY 
THING THEY SHARE.  AND SAID IN 

02:07:57.459 --> 02:08:05.672
THE FIRST ENGLISH SPOKEN IN THIS
 FILM.  I AM A JEW.  HAVE NOT I.

02:08:07.305 --> 02:08:10.817
AND IT'S A BREATH TAKING MOMENT 
THAT RESOLVES THE DIFFERENCE 

02:08:10.818 --> 02:08:13.879
BETWEEN THESE TWO OPPOSING 
FORCES AND ACTUALLY A BRIEF 

02:08:13.880 --> 02:08:18.528
WHILE, BEFORE A TRAGIC ENDING, 
JOIN FORCES.  SO I GUESS MY 

02:08:18.925 --> 02:08:24.220
ANSWER IS, I'M LESS INTERESTED 
IN WHAT STEVEN

02:08:28.737 --> 02:08:32.907
 GREENBLAT OF HARVARD SAYS, BUT 
I'M INTERESTED IN WHAT THE PLAY 

02:08:32.908 --> 02:08:36.913
TELLS US ABOUT OURSELVES AND OUR
 CULTURAL MOMENTS ABOUT 

02:08:36.914 --> 02:08:40.027
OURSELVES OVER TIME.  YES?  
SPEAKER:  UNLESS I'M 

02:08:40.600 --> 02:08:42.965
INTERPRETING THIS WRONG, IT 
SEEMS THAT SHAKESPEARE WAS 

02:08:43.994 --> 02:08:46.619
INCREDIBLY PROGRESSIVE WITH HIS 
VIEWS ABOUT WHETHER IT WAS A 

02:08:47.024 --> 02:08:49.801
WOMAN OR WHETHER IT WAS ABOUT A 
MAN LOVING ANOTHER MAN, ET 

02:08:50.029 --> 02:08:55.839
CETERA, HOW DO WE ACCOUNT FOR 
THAT?  

02:08:55.840 --> 02:08:57.840
SPEAKER:  I THINK SHAKESPEARE 
HAD HIS

02:09:00.774 --> 02:09:06.014
 FINGER ON THE AGE.  I'M GETTING
 OFF THIS STAGE QUICKLY. 

02:09:06.015 --> 02:09:12.781
OUR JURISTS HAVE RETURNED.  
THANK YOU.  [APPLAUSE]. 

02:09:12.782 --> 02:09:16.327
SPEAKER:  THE COURT HAS REACHED 
A UNANIMOUS JUDGMENT.  BUT 

02:09:17.852 --> 02:09:24.461
BEFORE I ANNOUNCE IT, WE ALL 
AGREE THAT SHYLOCK,

02:09:28.685 --> 02:09:35.946
 ANTONIO, AND PORTIA WERE 
REPRESENTED BY MOST 

02:09:56.242 --> 02:10:07.208
EXCELLENT COUNSEL.  [APPLAUSE]. 
SO TO START TOEXCELLENT COUNSEL.

02:09:49.542 --> 02:09:51.542
  [APPLAUSE]. 
SO TO START TO OUR JUDGMENT, AS 

02:09:51.830 --> 02:09:56.213
SHYLOCK'S ADVOCATE CONCEDED, ITS
 POUND OF FLESH IS OUT OF THE 

02:09:56.214 --> 02:10:03.729
CASE SO THAT IS OFF THE TABLE.  
WE ARE ALSO GOING TO HOLD 

02:10:04.163 --> 02:10:09.899
SHYLOCK TO HIS STATEMENT, THAT 
HE WANTED NOT A DROP OF 

02:10:11.267 --> 02:10:17.354
INTEREST.  SO HE GETS INTEREST. 
BUT HE DOES GET BACK HIS 

02:10:18.101 --> 02:10:21.085
PRINCIPLE.  AS A SUBSTITUTIONAL 
REMEDY, BECAUSE HE DIDN'T

02:10:24.495 --> 02:10:33.505
 GET THE POUND OF FLESH.  AND 
THE CONVERSION WAS ONLY ONE 

02:10:33.506 --> 02:10:39.311
PARTY WHO WAS STILL INSISTING ON
 THE CONVERSION.  BUT WE ARE 

02:10:39.312 --> 02:10:45.462
GOING TO TAKE COUNSEL FOR 
PORTIA'S GOOD ADVICE, THAT THE 

02:10:45.463 --> 02:10:47.463
CONVERSION SHOULD BE 

02:10:51.749 --> 02:10:57.896
VACATED.  SO SHYLOCK GETS HIS 
MONEY BACK BECAUSE OTHERWISE, 

02:10:57.897 --> 02:10:59.897
ANTONIO WOULD BE 

02:11:03.295 --> 02:11:08.216
UNJUSTLY ENRICHED.  AND THE 
FORFEITURE THAT IS OUT BECAUSE 

02:11:09.172 --> 02:11:13.218
THE DUKE EXPLAINS THAT THIS 
ALIEN STATUTE LEAVES IT IN HIS 

02:11:13.468 --> 02:11:19.706
JUDGMENT, WHETHER TO TAKE 
SHYLOCK'S LIFE, SO THAT IS A 

02:11:19.707 --> 02:11:27.552
CRIMINAL SANCTION, THEREFORE THE
 ALIEN STATUTE IS OUT OF THE 

02:11:28.082 --> 02:11:31.888
CASE.
AND WE ALSO GRANT PORTIA'S 

02:11:31.889 --> 02:11:41.805
MOTION TO BE DISMISSED FROM THE 
PROCEEDINGS.  AND THAT'S THE SUM

02:11:41.806 --> 02:11:43.806
 OF IT.  [APPLAUSE].

02:12:05.597 --> 02:12:07.597
 AND

02:12:19.534 --> 02:12:21.534
 AND NOW

02:12:33.612 --> 02:13:06.259
 I THINK EACH OF MY COLLEAGUES 
WILL COMMENT BRIEFLY.  

02:12:04.565 --> 02:12:09.192
SPEAKER:  I WILL START US OFF.  
WHAT A PLEASURE IT HAS BEEN TO 

02:12:09.412 --> 02:12:11.412
SEVEN WITH MY THREE

02:12:12.570 --> 02:12:17.199
 SISTERS AND ONE BROTHER ON THE 
BENCH.  WHAT A PLEASURE TO HEAR 

02:12:17.200 --> 02:12:21.615
FROM THE ABLE COUNSEL AND TO BE 
A PART OF THIS. 

02:12:29.630 --> 02:12:32.581
 MIGUEL-STEARNS, YOU WERE SUCH A
 WONDERFUL ADVOCATE FOR YOUR 

02:12:32.582 --> 02:12:35.603
CLIENT.  AND I HOPE YOU TELL HER
 I THINK SHE WOULD BE A REALLY 

02:12:35.604 --> 02:12:40.715
WONDERFUL CANDIDATE FOR 
ADMISSION TO WAKE FOREST LAW 

02:12:46.454 --> 02:12:49.492
SCHOOL.  [APPLAUSE]. 
SPEAKER:  I WANTED TO THANK THE 

02:12:50.444 --> 02:12:53.406
LAW LIBRARY HERE AT THE LIBRARY 
OF CONGRESS FOR WHAT THEY HAVE 

02:12:54.069 --> 02:12:56.069
DONE AND THE 

02:13:03.937 --> 02:13:09.103
COMM ESHINGS MEMORY OF APRIL 
23RD.  AND I AM BEING REMINDED 

02:13:09.104 --> 02:13:12.985
WHEN HE ONCE SAID, DAMN, THOSE 
ANCIENTS HAVE STOLEN MY THOUGHTS

02:13:13.213 --> 02:13:15.785
 AND WHEN I THINK OF SHAKESPEARE
 AND I THINK OF THE MERCHANT OF 

02:13:15.961 --> 02:13:18.875
VENICE AND ALL OF THOSE LINES 
THAT WE HAVE HEARD AND WHAT THEY

02:13:19.905 --> 02:13:24.860
 SIGNIFY, YOU KNOW THERE IS SO 
MUCH IN THAT.  THERE IS SO MUCH 

02:13:24.997 --> 02:13:29.443
PERCEPTION, PROVOCATION, 
SENTIMENTALITY AND HUMOR IN THE 

02:13:30.297 --> 02:13:33.937
PLAY.  AND AS IT HAS BEEN 
DEPICTED.  AND I DO WANT TO SAY 

02:13:33.938 --> 02:13:38.472
ALSO THAT I THINK THE COUNSELS 
WERE FANTASTIC.  I ENJOYED BEING

02:13:38.930 --> 02:13:46.145
 WITH THE JUDGES AND TO ME, 
JUSTICE GINSBURG IS A ROLE MODEL

02:13:47.106 --> 02:13:54.133
 AND AN IDOL AND I VERY MUCH 
PREACH HER BEING

02:13:58.912 --> 02:14:03.686
  HERE.  AND THANK YOU FOR 
SETTING IT UP, TOO.  AND YOU 

02:14:03.687 --> 02:14:06.603
HAVE BEEN A GREAT AUDIENCE.  THE
 ENTHUSIASM HAS BEEN THERE AND 

02:14:06.604 --> 02:14:09.400
THE HUMOR AND UNDERSTANDING.  
THANK YOU.  

02:14:09.401 --> 02:14:17.263
SPEAKER:  THANKS.  I ADD MY 
THANKS AS EXPRESSED BY THE 

02:14:17.589 --> 02:14:23.539
HONORABLE REYNOLDS AND MORELLA 
AND MY APPRECIATION TO EVERYONE 

02:14:23.943 --> 02:14:28.070
FOR PUTTING THIS ON AND SUCH A 
WONDERFUL PERFORMANCE BY 

02:14:28.443 --> 02:14:30.443
EVERYBODY.  IT WAS GREAT.  IN 

02:14:32.587 --> 02:14:36.921
THE 18TH CENTURY, PEOPLE COULD 
NOT ACCEPT PEOPLE, WHEN I SAY 

02:14:36.922 --> 02:14:41.696
PEOPLE OF THE ENGLISH, I AM 
THINKING MOSTLY COULDN'T ACCEPT 

02:14:41.697 --> 02:14:46.496
BAD ENDINGS, TRAGIC ENDINGS, SO 
THEY CHANGED THE ENDINGS OF 

02:14:46.894 --> 02:14:50.080
SEVERAL PLAYS.  CHANGED THE 
ENDING OF KING LEER FOR EXAMPLE 

02:14:51.426 --> 02:14:57.854
TO MAKE SURE THAT CORNELIUS 
LIVES AND GOES APPLE TO APPLE 

02:14:57.855 --> 02:15:03.035
AND CHANGE THE FEELING OF 
HAMLET.  SO THEY GET MARRIED.  I

02:15:03.487 --> 02:15:07.200
 FEEL LIKE, TO A CERTAIN EXTENT,
 THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE 

02:15:07.201 --> 02:15:11.080
DOING WHEN WE HAVE THIS 
PERIODICALLY REPEATED APPEAL OF 

02:15:11.274 --> 02:15:15.352
SHYLOCK.  I FEEL LIKE WE ARE 
SOMEHOW ADDING OUR OWN ENDING TO

02:15:15.353 --> 02:15:20.648
 A VERY SAD STORY THAT 
SHAKESPEARE TOLD ABOUT EXCLUDING

02:15:20.958 --> 02:15:26.586
 PEOPLE AND EXCLUDING GROUPS OF 
PEOPLE, WOMEN AND JEWS AND 

02:15:31.289 --> 02:15:34.989
MOROCCANS WAS BROUGHT UP HERE 
AND WE CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE WITH

02:15:35.185 --> 02:15:41.715
 THIS AS A SOCIETY AND OUR DOING
 THIS IS REALLY, IN THIS SENSE, 

02:15:41.716 --> 02:15:44.774
READDING ANOTHER ENDING.  
GETTING ANOTHER CHANCE OF 

02:15:44.775 --> 02:15:47.566
FINDING SOME JUSTICE HERE.  IT 
HAS BEEN GREAT TO BE PART OF 

02:15:47.567 --> 02:15:50.686
THAT PROCESS.  AND I HAVE TO SAY
 AS WELL FROM THE HEART THAT YOU

02:15:50.687 --> 02:15:54.818
 KNOW, I SO APPRECIATE JUSTICE

02:15:58.547 --> 02:16:02.495
 GINSBURG AGAIN DOING THIS IN 
VENICE LAST SUMMER AND NOW DOING

02:16:03.112 --> 02:16:06.140
 IT AGAIN.  
SHE IS ALSO FOR ME AN INCREDIBLE

02:16:06.625 --> 02:16:11.195
 IDOL AND ROLE MODEL.  AND I 
THANK HER FOR AGREEING TO DO 

02:16:16.857 --> 02:16:18.857
THIS.  [APPLAUSE]. 
SPEAKER:  I WANTED TO SAY THANK 

02:16:19.005 --> 02:16:22.085
YOU TO THE LAW LIBRARY FOR 
INVITING ME.  IT HAS BEEN A VERY

02:16:22.344 --> 02:16:26.589
 GREAT EXPERIENCE.  ESPECIALLY 
WITH SUCH A DISTINGUISHED PANEL.

02:16:26.899 --> 02:16:31.694
AND I AM ALSO GLAD THAT THE 
UNITY HAS BEEN RESTORED.  EVEN 

02:16:31.890 --> 02:16:38.593
WITH A LITTLE BIT OF DELAY.  BUT
 AS BEING AS ITALIAN, I KNOW 

02:16:38.594 --> 02:16:42.433
THAT JUSTICE MIGHT BE SLOW.  SO 
I AM HAPPY THAT YOU FINALLY GOT 

02:16:42.434 --> 02:16:44.434
IT.  

02:17:02.636 --> 02:17:11.955
[APPLAUSE]. 
SPEAKER:  OKAY.  THE CAST HAS 

02:16:56.117 --> 02:16:58.917
[APPLAUSE]. 
SPEAKER:  OKAY.  THE CAST HAS 

02:16:56.117 --> 02:16:59.272
AGREED TO TAKE A FEW QUESTIONS. 
AND SO WE HAVE SOME MICROPHONES 

02:16:59.717 --> 02:17:03.065
OUT IN THE AUDIENCE.  SO PLEASE 
RAISE YOUR HAND.  AND THEY WILL 

02:17:03.289 --> 02:17:10.534
HAND YOU A MICROPHONE.  YOU CAN 
ASK ANY OF THE CAST MEMBERS, 

02:17:11.182 --> 02:17:14.937
EXCEPT ME, QUESTIONS AND DIRECT 
THEM.  OR YOU CAN JUST ASK

02:17:26.655 --> 02:17:28.129
GENERAL QUESTIONS.  OKAY.  I 
DON'T THINK WE HAVE ANY 

02:17:28.130 --> 02:17:30.932
QUESTIONS.  MAYBE WE HAD 

02:17:38.151 --> 02:17:40.163
QUESTIONS BEFORE.  [APPLAUSE]. 
BUT I DO WANT TO, ON BEHALF OF 

02:17:40.283 --> 02:17:42.539
THE LAW LIBRARY OF CONGRESS, I 
WOULD LIKE TO THANK ALL OF THE 

02:17:42.540 --> 02:17:49.194
CAST MEMBERS AND SPEAKERS 
TONIGHT.  AND LET ME ALSO THANK 

02:17:49.549 --> 02:17:52.238
SHYLOCK FOR A TERRIFIC 

02:17:59.624 --> 02:18:04.414
PERFORMANCE.  [APPLAUSE]. AND 
ALSO, I WILL ADD MY THANKS TO 

02:18:05.825 --> 02:18:09.047
JUSTICE GINSBURG BECAUSE THIS IS
 A VERY BUSY TIME, AS YOU KNOW, 

02:18:09.048 --> 02:18:11.607
FOR THE SUPREME COURT.  AND WE 
REALLY APPRECIATE HER BEING 

02:18:11.817 --> 02:18:14.175
HERE.  PLEASE JOIN US UPSTAIRS 
IN THE GREAT HALL FOR A
