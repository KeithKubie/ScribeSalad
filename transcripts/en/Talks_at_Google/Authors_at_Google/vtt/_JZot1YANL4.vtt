[APPLAUSE]

00:00:07.754 --> 00:00:09.170
ANNIE JACOBSEN:
Thank you so much.

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:11.140
Can everyone hear me all right?

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:13.680
And thank you so much
to Google for having me

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.974
and the tech guys for
trying to make this work.

00:00:15.974 --> 00:00:17.140
We'll do a little test here.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:18.120
I'll [INAUDIBLE] work.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.340
OK.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:20.660
So I am Annie Jacobsen.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.140
Thank you for the intro.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.310
And this book is about
the Pentagon's Brain,

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.820
which is sometimes how DARPA
is referred to at the Pentagon.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.170
One of the most frequent
questions that I am asked

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:35.370
is how do I get these
guys to talk to me?

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.080
So I just wanted to
begin for a moment

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.720
with that, because I do
write about these seemingly

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.340
impenetrable areas,
whether it's Area

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.410
51 or the old Nazi
scientists program,

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.000
which was still very classified
up until recently, to DARPA.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.390
And what I would like to mention
is that one of my Area 51

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.960
sources, a physicist
who invented

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.730
stealth technology for the
government going back to when

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.437
Eisenhower was president
told me, he said, Annie,

00:01:06.437 --> 00:01:08.020
there's two things
to always remember.

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.160
One, "fortune favors
the prepared mind,"

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.920
and he was quoting Pasteur, but
the idea is that we should just

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.910
be as knowledgeable as
we can and be prepared

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.850
for amazing things to happen.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.890
And the other thing that he
told me was look up, not down,

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.470
and he said that because
physicists, as I have learned,

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.690
are always looking
up to understand

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.960
the mysteries of whatever it
is they have in front of them.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.280
And the physicists
that I work with

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.660
are dealing with weapons
related issues, but looking up,

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:46.340
whether it's at bees, birds,
bats, the moon, or the cosmos,

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.650
that is where so
many of the answers

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.450
lie to this kind of
a scientist's mind.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.170
But he also meant look
up, meaning go up.

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.980
If you get a no,
[? Lavik ?] told me,

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.650
then go to that guy's boss,
and if that guy gives you a no,

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:03.860
then go to his boss.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.700
Because, he told me-- and I
have found this to be true--

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.050
that the most knowledgeable
people among us

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.660
often want to share
their information.

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.810
They do not want to
hoard the information.

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.360
Particularly as
they get older, they

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.890
find that it's important for
this country that they love.

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.260
All of the national security
scientists I work with

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.890
are real patriots, and
they talk about how

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.900
even if they worked on
classified programs,

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.980
they stay abreast of
what is unclassified

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.470
as they get older so
that they can then

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.240
share that information.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.970
And so that is how I approach
these things, and three

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.110
of the scientists that
I was most happy to work

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.000
with on this book-- Charles
Townes invented the laser,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.890
and he recently passed
at the age of 99.

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.740
And the way that I
got to Townes was

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.740
I was at the Pentagon trying to
learn about laser beam weapons.

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:02.540
They're called directed
energy weapons, DEW weapons.

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.460
They're among the most
classified systems

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:07.020
in the government and no
one would tell me anything.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.360
They wouldn't even tell me basic
technology about how it worked.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.700
I followed [? Lavik's ?] lead.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.060
I looked up and not
down, and ultimately I

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.480
found my way to Charles Townes,
still giving interviews at age

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.700
98 when we spoke at the
University of California,

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:23.660
Berkeley.

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.910
And he told me some amazing
stories about the laser

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.162
and about early laser
development, which

00:03:28.162 --> 00:03:29.870
I write about in the
book, which give you

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.830
a real clear idea of why these
weapons are so important, why

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.670
they're so secret, and it has to
do with accuracy and precision.

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.850
In the middle there
is Murph Goldberger,

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.180
and he worked in the
Manhattan Project.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.630
He too passed this last year.

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.950
He was the co-founder
of the Jason scientists.

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.200
So if anyone has heard
of the Jason scientists,

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.480
they are perhaps the most
elite, most secretive defense

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.930
scientists in the
nation, and have

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.020
been since they created
their organization in 1960,

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:06.340
specifically to work for DARPA,
which was then called ARPA.

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.208
It did not yet have the D.

00:04:09.208 --> 00:04:12.150
And Joseph Zasloff
also died recently,

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.710
but I was able to interview him.

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:18.800
And he was a social scientist,
and he ran the program

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.690
during the Vietnam
War, specifically

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:25.990
for ARPA, which was called the
Viet Cong Motivation and Morale

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:27.350
Program.

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.510
You could do a whole
linguistic study on that title.

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.620
But it was interesting to
see how social science played

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.020
a role in the Vietnam
War, and then again played

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.230
a role in the Iraq
war, and even more

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:41.480
interesting for a
reporter like me

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.710
to realize that DARPA, who
is an organization that

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.760
is so involved in the
highest technology

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.550
weapons of the present
and of the future,

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:55.120
is also in the business
of social science.

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.020
I also say that-- I like
to say that the truth has

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.180
many points of
view, and the reason

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.520
why is this document, which
is this is one of my sources,

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.840
and it says at the
top Francis Murray.

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.940
It says he's at
headquarters, US Air Force.

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.117
That's at the Pentagon.

00:05:10.117 --> 00:05:11.700
And it gives the
dates and everything,

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.790
and it gives them grade
marks and whatnot.

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:17.540
But Frank Murray was also
one of my Area 51 sources,

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:21.700
and he was in fact out at Area
51 during this entire time

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.910
that he was allegedly
at the Pentagon,

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:27.320
even though this documentation
says he was there.

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.220
So I like to say that as
a point that the truth has

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:32.670
many parts to it.

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:35.080
It has many points
of view, and whenever

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.360
you're dealing with
government secrecy

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.810
there's always the sense
that more will be revealed.

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:48.150
This here, which is the
DARPA Cheetah robot runs.

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:52.730
It starts at zero miles an hour,
and it begins to gain momentum

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:56.940
through like 10, 11, 12, and
suddenly it's going so fast you

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.960
can barely see its legs moving,
and then you cannot see its

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.200
legs moving anymore.

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:04.130
It's going 28 miles
an hour, and then

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.678
suddenly it crashes by sort
of falling back on itself,

00:06:06.678 --> 00:06:09.879
and it's tethered to a rope,
so it doesn't really crash.

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:11.420
The reason why this
is so astonishing

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:15.310
is this is, you know, this
incredible thing to look at

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:17.140
to watch, and you
realize this is

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:19.060
where our weapons are heading.

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:22.650
Our weapons are heading
toward autonomous robotics.

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:24.640
And I write about this
at the end of the book,

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:29.050
but I wanted to give you an
idea of what they look like now.

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:32.570
So we'll jump way
back in time, when--

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:38.060
Because computers and computing
are so much of a part of where

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:41.410
we are today and where the
Pentagon is with its weapons

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:43.990
systems, it's
important to realize--

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:47.730
or at least it was for me-- to
realize that back in this day--

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:49.580
this is around 1946.

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:53.030
That's John von Neumann
and Robert Oppenheimer,

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:57.816
and they're at the Princeton
Institute for Advanced Study,

00:06:57.816 --> 00:06:59.190
and they're down
in the basement,

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:01.390
and that's the MANIAC computer.

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:06.710
And at the time, a little
before this, during the war,

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:10.320
John von Neumann was what I
call the first Pentagon's brain.

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:13.940
He was the smartest
man in Washington, DC,

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:17.490
and the Pentagon looked
to him to solve solutions.

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:19.570
For example, when
the decision was

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:22.330
made to drop the atomic
bomb on Hiroshima,

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:23.900
scientists wondered
whether or not

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:26.520
they should have it explode
when it hit the ground.

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:28.380
Well, von Neumann,
in his ability

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:33.260
to do math calculations in his
head at an extraordinary speed

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.040
said no, and with a
little bit of pen to paper

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:38.100
he determined that
actually the bomb

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:42.990
should be dropped at
1,800 feet above Hiroshima

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:45.230
for the largest kill rate.

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:47.760
So that's how von
Neumann's mind worked.

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:51.080
He was what was called
a human computer.

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:53.030
That's what computers were then.

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:56.280
He built this computer,
a machine computer,

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:59.250
and he was one of the first
people in the United States

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:03.830
who had this idea that one
day computers could think.

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:07.920
And he actually called
what we now call software,

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:11.350
he called it the
computer's organs,

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:13.570
just like a human being.

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:18.800
von Neumann died of cancer the
year before DARPA was started,

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:20.465
most likely from a
speck of plutonium

00:08:20.465 --> 00:08:23.420
that he inhaled while he
was working on the Manhattan

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:24.330
Project.

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:29.830
But he is the first Pentagon's
brain that I write about.

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:32.610
So why did I begin the
book here where I did,

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:35.690
which this is the
thermonuclear bomb going off

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:37.230
in the Marshall Islands.

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:39.970
It's a 15 megaton
bomb, and what I

00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:42.440
found astounding was
for a while when I first

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:44.130
used to look at
this photograph, I

00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:46.380
thought that those images
there at the bottom

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:48.940
were the waves in the sea,
because I interviewed many

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:51.184
of the scientists who
worked on this bomb program

00:08:51.184 --> 00:08:53.100
and they would talk to
me about being on boats

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:54.660
and whatnot watching
it, and then

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:56.870
I realized those
are actually clouds.

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:59.380
That's how high up
that mushroom cloud is,

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:02.850
and it's 70 miles across.

00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:05.660
It was a 15 megaton explosion.

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:08.490
It was supposed to
be six megatons,

00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:13.330
and the science got away
with itself, so to speak.

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:17.600
But this is why
DARPA was created.

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:22.130
Scientists had created
a weapon against which

00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:26.110
there is no defense, and there
still is no defense today,

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:27.500
by the way.

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:31.020
One of the first
jobs that DARPA did

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:33.480
was-- and this was a
very classified program.

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:36.070
I don't think it's ever
been revealed before.

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:38.260
I certainly couldn't find
it in the public domain,

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.432
but I did find in an archive.

00:09:40.432 --> 00:09:42.640
One of the first things that
the DARPA scientists did

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:49.570
was calculate down to the
second how many seconds it takes

00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:53.710
for a nuclear weapon like
this to leave the Soviet Union

00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:55.890
and travel to Washington, DC.

00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:57.810
Does anyone have a guess?

00:09:57.810 --> 00:09:59.007
How many seconds?

00:09:59.007 --> 00:09:59.590
I'll tell you.

00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:01.131
It's 1,600.

00:10:01.131 --> 00:10:04.910
1,600 seconds.

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:06.860
So that's not very much time.

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:10.580
That is still a fact today,
by the way, and something

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:14.010
that the nuclear
agency of the day

00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:17.080
will neither confirm nor deny.

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:18.360
But it is a fact.

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:19.990
So this is why
DARPA was created.

00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:22.190
How do we defend
against these weapons

00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:24.520
that there is no
defense against?

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:26.340
And then the idea
was, well, we'll just

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:27.770
go into the offensive.

00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:30.480
So we'll create more
and bigger weapons.

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:32.390
This little slide
I like to show,

00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:34.320
just because it's so
astonishing to me.

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:38.250
I was able to interview one of
the men who was in this bunker.

00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:40.560
There were 10
scientists and engineers

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:43.790
19 miles from ground zero
where that thermonuclear weapon

00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:44.760
went off.

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:47.760
And the idea was the
Defense Department

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:51.210
wanted to see, well, since
we can't defend against it,

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:53.917
maybe we can create
these bunkers

00:10:53.917 --> 00:10:55.750
and we can all live
underground for a while.

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:58.820
If we have enough time,
1,600 seconds, if we

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:00.910
can all get in a
bunker before then.

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:04.040
So they built this-- I mean, I
have all the specs in the book.

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:06.430
It's just a crazy bunker.

00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:07.890
The men lived.

00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:09.150
They barely lived.

00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:12.670
But they had to be
airlifted out of it hours

00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:16.520
later because the radiation was
so intense no one could go in.

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:20.110
So unless you had
one of these built

00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:22.450
to these wild
specifications, there's

00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:25.300
no way to survive
a nuclear bomb.

00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:26.720
Sputnik came along.

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:31.890
This is a replica of that
23 inch diameter sphere

00:11:31.890 --> 00:11:36.600
that made the American public
go wild in October of 1957,

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:39.560
thinking my god, the
Soviets are coming.

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:42.710
"Time" magazine had
this on its cover.

00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:45.460
And the idea--
You know, Sputnik.

00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:46.400
Just a satellite.

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:47.450
How bad could it be?

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:52.250
But of course, this ICBM
would be the launch vehicle

00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:54.240
for that satellite,
and you can see

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:56.110
this interesting
anthropomorphization

00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:58.720
of that nuclear weapon.

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:01.440
It's got a brain,
and it has a finger

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:05.570
pointed at the East Coast.

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:09.010
So competition
creates excellence,

00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:11.210
and this is how DARPA began.

00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:14.580
Here you have the weapons
directors at the big two

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:17.970
laboratories which were
created specifically

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:22.670
to compete with one
another so that America

00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:28.040
could maintain technological
superiority over the Soviet

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:32.350
Union and never again be beaten
by the Soviets after Sputnik.

00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:34.130
And here's what's interesting.

00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:35.960
DARPA is a double edged sword.

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:38.490
On the one hand, there
are very serious concerns

00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:40.460
that I raise in the
book about where

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:42.260
weapons technology is going.

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:45.540
On the other hand, one
must keep on balance

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:48.070
this idea that the
United States has never

00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:50.620
been taken by
technological surprise,

00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:53.220
and that is owing to DARPA.

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:56.410
That's Murph Goldberger, and it
was-- he was the Jason founder,

00:12:56.410 --> 00:12:58.720
and there he is at
his home looking--

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:02.470
he's also served as a
presidential science adviser--

00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:05.630
looking at one of the
photographs of when he was

00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:09.870
in his heyday, and talking
with me about what it was

00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:13.440
like working on nuclear--
what it was like working

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:18.850
on these major DARPA programs
in the very beginning of DARPA.

00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:20.530
But of course, it all changed.

00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:22.960
These big nuclear
ballistic missile

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:25.480
related defense
technologies that DARPA

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:29.510
was pursuing-- By the way, it
was called ARPA up until 1972.

00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:32.790
For ease, I'm just going
to always call it DARPA.

00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:34.470
Along came Kennedy.

00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:38.680
He had a very different
attitude than Eisenhower.

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:40.940
And you see LBJ in
the background there.

00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:42.490
Both of these men
would authorize

00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:48.070
some of the most controversial
DARPA weapons ever to exist.

00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:50.240
We had a problem in Vietnam.

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:51.690
That is how it was seen.

00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:55.120
And ARPA was sent in
to take care of this.

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:57.600
In President Diem
there in the front,

00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:03.120
we had a person who was very
interested in technology,

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:08.794
and Johnson was sent by Kennedy
to make a deal with Diem

00:14:08.794 --> 00:14:13.950
that we would create some
weapons facilities in Saigon

00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:18.440
and begin manufacturing the
most state of the art weaponry

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:20.870
to give them to the
Vietnamese soldiers.

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:23.520
Diem thought this
was a fabulous idea,

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:24.830
and that's where it all began.

00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:27.970
Now what's fascinating is
these are in the early years

00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:29.980
of the Kennedy presidency.

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:31.260
Here's an example.

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:34.710
So the small in
stature Vietnamese

00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:38.260
were having trouble handling
these semiautomatic weapons,

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:43.180
and so DARPA pushed
through the AR-15 rifle.

00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:45.050
And what was
interesting, when you

00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:49.540
can see how swift and agile
DARPA is-- And by the way,

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:53.407
the whole entire Vietnam program
was called Project Agile.

00:14:53.407 --> 00:14:55.240
It was like, we're going
to get things done,

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:56.860
and we're going to
get them done fast.

00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:59.580
There had been a debate
going on at the Pentagon ever

00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:03.400
since the end of World
War II about what rifle

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:05.040
would be the standard rifle.

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:06.880
DARPA made it happen.

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:09.210
They ordered 1,000 AR-15s.

00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:10.730
They sent them to Saigon.

00:15:10.730 --> 00:15:12.490
They gave them to the soldiers.

00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:15.300
And today that has
become the M16,

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:19.360
and that is the standard bearer
of what all our soldiers carry.

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:22.660
This is another example
of what DARPA got into.

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:26.550
Because they had their hands
now in so many different pieces

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:31.660
of the pie, chemical warfare
became a DARPA program,

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:33.370
and this is of
course Agent Orange

00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:35.180
being sprayed over the jungles.

00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:39.530
It was perceived to be the magic
bullet that might end the war,

00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:41.870
and that's not what happened.

00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:43.847
So where was technology in 1960?

00:15:43.847 --> 00:15:44.930
I mean, stop for a moment.

00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:48.000
There is Secretary of
Defense Robert McNamara

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:53.080
with a pointer and a slideshow.

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:56.330
Even more astonishing, this
is where technology was.

00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:58.710
This was a bright
red telephone that

00:15:58.710 --> 00:16:01.290
was installed in the
Secretary of Defense's house

00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:03.240
and also in the
President's house.

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:08.200
And that analog idea--
So if-- In the event

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:11.470
of a nuclear decision
needing to be made,

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:17.950
that dreaded go/no go decision,
Khrushchev or Kennedy,

00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:19.904
this is what they had.

00:16:19.904 --> 00:16:21.570
First it had to go
through a White House

00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:24.990
operator on our end, then
it had to go like this,

00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:27.170
and then imagine dialing.

00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:30.090
And the Pentagon said,
this is-- Actually,

00:16:30.090 --> 00:16:32.440
Congress said this
is unacceptable,

00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:37.610
assigned DARPA to the job,
which meant the arrival

00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:41.680
of this fellow at ARPA in 1962.

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:43.760
This is JCR Licklider.

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:46.830
Many people consider him
the father of the internet.

00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:49.330
When he arrived at
ARPA, his job was

00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:52.420
to deal with
command and control,

00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:55.330
also called C2,
this idea that we

00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:58.800
must be better in command
and control of our technology

00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:00.110
than a red phone.

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:04.190
And he had this crazy idea
of creating something called

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:07.660
an intergalactic network,
and that is what we now

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:09.069
know as the internet.

00:17:09.069 --> 00:17:15.300
It started out first
as the ARPANET at ARPA.

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:19.180
The Jason scientist--
Another interesting way

00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:23.290
in which I write about
the Pentagon's brain

00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:27.170
and how it works is that
these different programs are

00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:28.830
kind of falling
into the background

00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:31.080
and then coming back
into the fore again,

00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:35.000
and that is what happened with
nuclear weapons in Vietnam.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.800
The Secretary-- This was a very,
very little known fact until

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:41.380
recently that
Secretary McNamara,

00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:45.380
Secretary of Defense McNamara,
really considered using nuclear

00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:48.310
weapons on this, the
Ho Chi Minh trail,

00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:50.620
which was the trail in the
jungle that all the jungle

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:53.320
fighters travelled from
the north to the south.

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:56.910
And he gathered the Jason
scientists together and said,

00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:58.480
is this possible?

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:01.260
And they conducted a
report as they always did.

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:02.780
They would meet in the summers.

00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:05.500
They were full time academics
and part time defense

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:06.570
contractors.

00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:09.960
They met and they said dropping
a nuclear weapon on the Ho Chi

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:14.090
Minh trail is a bad idea,
because the Viet Cong are

00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:17.230
so crafty, they
will just figure out

00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:20.260
a way to create a trail
that goes around it.

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:25.220
And so instead the idea that the
Jason scientists came up with

00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:29.230
was something called
McNamara's electronic fence.

00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:32.570
And pause for a moment and
consider this, if you will.

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:37.610
This is really where all
sensor technology began.

00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:40.760
All the programs of the present
day, the prison programs,

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:43.010
et cetera, et cetera,
the NSA, that people

00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:45.610
worry about and wonder
about and are curious about,

00:18:45.610 --> 00:18:47.910
they all began right
here in Vietnam,

00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:52.110
and they began with this idea
of McNamara's electronic fence.

00:18:52.110 --> 00:18:54.640
That large, weird,
dart looking thing

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:57.610
with the antennas coming
out of that, that's

00:18:57.610 --> 00:19:02.790
what's called an ADSID, and
it's actually an audio detection

00:19:02.790 --> 00:19:03.750
device.

00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:07.380
And the guys who I interviewed
for this book, the VO-67 Navy

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:09.660
crew, would get
into that aircraft

00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:13.220
and they would fly
low and slow over some

00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:17.890
of the most dangerous parts
of the Ho Chi Minh trail,

00:19:17.890 --> 00:19:21.650
and they would drop those
sensors out in a string.

00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:24.260
And they would come
hurtling out of the aircraft

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:26.500
and they would sort of land
in the ground, hopefully.

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:28.570
A lot of them fell on the side.

00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:32.360
And the idea was to create
this string of sensors

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:34.360
with audio technology.

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:36.800
The information would be
sent up to an aircraft that's

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:39.350
flying around in a
racetrack formation.

00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:42.520
Then it goes back to
an information center

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:45.940
at an airbase, a US
airbase, in Thailand.

00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:49.960
And then everyone's using these
new things called computers

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:53.300
to try to make sense
of this information,

00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:56.200
basically to hear some
fighters say, yes,

00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:58.730
there are some trucks coming
down the trail tomorrow.

00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:01.650
They're bringing lots
of X, Y, and Z weapons.

00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:04.720
At which point, a targeting
strip would be made,

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:08.070
and the aircraft would go
out and strike those targets.

00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:10.980
It was an idea that was
ridiculed at the Pentagon

00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:12.180
by the generals.

00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:14.770
No one liked this idea.

00:20:14.770 --> 00:20:16.000
There you see another.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.190
That's a different version
of things being thrown out

00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:20.390
of a helicopter.

00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:23.320
There were also seismic
sensors that were going out,

00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:25.130
magnetic sensors.

00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:27.180
This was early
sensor technology.

00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:28.370
You can see how big it is.

00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:30.650
I mean, now these
sensors are so small.

00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:34.210
DARPA even has some new
technology I've been told

00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:38.520
about, but I could not verify,
because it might still be

00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:42.030
in the classified department,
sensors that actually cannot be

00:20:42.030 --> 00:20:45.620
seen, but they go on people's
fingertips unwittingly.

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:49.667
So when they're typing
everything is going back.

00:20:49.667 --> 00:20:51.250
And when you think
about that concept,

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:54.470
that this all began on
the Ho Chi Minh trail,

00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:56.960
it's pretty remarkable.

00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:59.100
No amount of
technology could go up

00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:02.250
against this, which
was student protesters,

00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:04.770
and it had a great impact
on the Vietnam War,

00:21:04.770 --> 00:21:08.560
and ultimately we did get
the hell out of Vietnam.

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:10.860
But it was a fascinating
time at DARPA.

00:21:10.860 --> 00:21:13.930
And there was the Mansfield
Amendment, and suddenly

00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:17.510
weapons, any kind of
new weapons technology

00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:21.780
was seen as thumbs down, and
Congress jumped and screamed

00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:25.470
and said we don't want any of
these pre-requirement research

00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:26.240
projects.

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:28.884
We just want good old
military projects.

00:21:28.884 --> 00:21:31.050
But it was interesting,
because this fellow came in,

00:21:31.050 --> 00:21:34.470
Harold Brown, and he came up
with a new strategy, which

00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:36.680
was making science
and technology

00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:38.760
an industry at the Pentagon.

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:42.840
And he put into play long
term research projects

00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:45.080
with all of that
sensor technology

00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:49.460
I was just talking about, and
it would build all the way

00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:50.820
to the Gulf War.

00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:54.590
I'll stop for a minute and tell
you quickly about this guy.

00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:56.200
This is Allen Macy Dulles.

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:59.355
He was an infantry
lieutenant in the Korean War.

00:21:59.355 --> 00:22:00.980
And the reason he
was important to me--

00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:04.730
his father was the director
of the CIA, Allen Dulles.

00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:09.240
And Allen Macy Dulles was
a young soldier in Korea,

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:13.170
and he went out in
November of 1952

00:22:13.170 --> 00:22:16.260
to check a perimeter
fence, as soldiers

00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:19.900
have been doing forever.

00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:24.110
And he was hit by a mortar, and
he suffered a traumatic brain

00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:27.710
injury that made
him have something

00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:29.320
called retrograde amnesia.

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:31.640
He can't remember any--
He can speak eloquently,

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:33.910
but he could not remember
anything that happened

00:22:33.910 --> 00:22:36.220
to him 10 minutes before.

00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:39.290
So this idea of
a perimeter fence

00:22:39.290 --> 00:22:41.510
was something that existed.

00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:45.010
In Vietnam we were creating
an electronic fence,

00:22:45.010 --> 00:22:47.810
and then now with Harold
Brown in the Pentagon,

00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:51.440
this movement came toward
creating a system where

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:52.750
it wasn't a fence.

00:22:52.750 --> 00:22:58.490
It's an area network, and we
can watch and survey that.

00:22:58.490 --> 00:23:01.160
So they began-- they
being the Pentagon,

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:03.860
DARPA-- began looking at
some of the technology

00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:07.990
from the Vietnam War and
rebundling it and working

00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:10.100
with the fact that
all technology was

00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:11.650
becoming nanotechnology.

00:23:11.650 --> 00:23:12.530
Not quite yet.

00:23:12.530 --> 00:23:15.250
But in other words, things
were getting smaller.

00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:17.970
And as things got smaller,
they could be more

00:23:17.970 --> 00:23:20.120
effective in the war theater.

00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:21.530
And these are two
of the earliest

00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:24.210
drones from the Vietnam War.

00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:28.260
This is like a reconfigured
helicopter that

00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:30.230
used to fly off of a submarine.

00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:33.360
And then the guy in the
Jeep is driving around

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:36.470
with all that technology,
gathering the information,

00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:38.020
video and audio.

00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:39.830
And they really had
very little effect

00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:42.120
on winning the Vietnam
War, but it's certainly

00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:44.080
a different story now.

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:48.890
So the Pentagon spent all
the way until the late '80s

00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:52.060
pushing technology,
pushing sensor technology,

00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:55.420
pushing drone technology,
building entire industries.

00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:57.970
The ARPANET became the
internet, and there

00:23:57.970 --> 00:23:59.930
was a movement
toward what is now

00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:05.500
called network-centric warfare.

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:10.680
And in the Gulf
War with Secretary

00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:15.470
of Defense Cheney
in charge, the idea

00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:19.180
that technology could
win a war like that

00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:21.640
became evident instantly,
and you can see that.

00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:23.770
This was called the
highway of death,

00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:29.220
and this is just the results
of that kind of technology.

00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:32.840
That stealth fighter
back there, the F-117,

00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:34.970
which was another
DARPA project-- Again,

00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:38.170
stealth, early
workings in Vietnam.

00:24:38.170 --> 00:24:40.960
20 years secretly in the making.

00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:44.240
10,000 Lockheed
employees, by the way,

00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:46.810
were cleared for the
Skunk Works program.

00:24:46.810 --> 00:24:51.220
Not one single leak ever
in that 18, 19 years,

00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:53.840
until it made its
debut in the Gulf War.

00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:57.050
But that took a lot of the
limelight, when in fact there

00:24:57.050 --> 00:25:00.410
was so much other DARPA
technology going on

00:25:00.410 --> 00:25:01.340
in that Gulf War.

00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:03.570
I write about it in the book.

00:25:03.570 --> 00:25:06.360
And most importantly,
something called JSTARS.

00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:10.050
So that old idea from Vietnam
of having an aircraft flying

00:25:10.050 --> 00:25:11.860
around in circles
trying to gather

00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:15.630
the technology from those giant
sensors had gotten shrunk down.

00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:18.520
So you had this
computer in the sky--

00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:22.820
it had 600,000 lines
of code-- gathering up

00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:27.180
the technology during the Gulf
War and relaying information,

00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:30.010
early drone technology.

00:25:30.010 --> 00:25:32.830
The Pentagon had a big
problem in urban warfare,

00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:33.640
and they knew it.

00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:36.770
But this was what their idea of
what urban warfare would look

00:25:36.770 --> 00:25:38.910
like, which is really laughable.

00:25:38.910 --> 00:25:40.560
They had, like, a
little drawing here,

00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:43.460
what looks to me like
a German village.

00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:46.980
So DARPA again got pulled
away when this happened,

00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:49.930
Mogadishu, Somalia, 1992.

00:25:49.930 --> 00:25:53.230
And there was lots of
activity at DARPA talking

00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:57.180
about how America
was going to deal

00:25:57.180 --> 00:25:59.210
with the possibility
of having to fight wars

00:25:59.210 --> 00:26:01.070
in urban environments.

00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:06.060
They would quote Sun Tzu a
lot, from 2,500 years ago.

00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:09.435
Sun Tzu said the worst
idea is to attack cities.

00:26:09.435 --> 00:26:11.060
And there was a lot
of debate at DARPA.

00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:13.800
Like, the worst idea
is to attack cities,

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:16.759
but what are we
going to do about it?

00:26:16.759 --> 00:26:18.550
Another interesting
thing happened at DARPA

00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:21.680
right around this same time,
which is the Berlin Wall fell.

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:24.640
And when the Berlin
Wall fell, a number

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:26.950
of very serious
Soviet scientists who

00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:29.390
had been working on
biological weapons programs

00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:31.310
defected to the
United States and they

00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:33.050
began working for DARPA.

00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:36.230
And this is Ken Alibek,
whom I interviewed.

00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:39.050
He's back in Uzbekistan now.

00:26:39.050 --> 00:26:43.040
But he was a major player in
the biological weapons program,

00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:44.830
and was very
controversial, because some

00:26:44.830 --> 00:26:49.330
say that he created the problem
that then needed to be solved.

00:26:49.330 --> 00:26:51.110
So again, you see
that conundrum,

00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:55.790
which is a bit like the nuclear
weapon issue, the thermonuclear

00:26:55.790 --> 00:26:58.450
weapon issue, that you
create a weapon that then you

00:26:58.450 --> 00:27:00.190
must defend against.

00:27:00.190 --> 00:27:02.160
But Alibek worked for
us for a long time

00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:03.770
before he left the country.

00:27:03.770 --> 00:27:06.850
And what was interesting
about these Soviet scientists

00:27:06.850 --> 00:27:09.010
is-- in terms of the
big picture of DARPA--

00:27:09.010 --> 00:27:14.260
was that before then there were
no biologists at the Pentagon.

00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:17.350
And that's kind of a term that
scientists will throw around

00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:20.790
loosely, but it's
pretty accurate.

00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:24.640
DARPA was interested in what I
call the Superman of science,

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:28.520
the Murph Goldbergers, the Jason
scientists, the physicists,

00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:29.570
the engineers.

00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:33.550
Biology was considered
soft science.

00:27:33.550 --> 00:27:37.070
That all changed,
and that has taken us

00:27:37.070 --> 00:27:40.090
in a very different
direction, because we are now

00:27:40.090 --> 00:27:43.100
looking inside the body.

00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:47.610
And again, things took a
very big change after 9/11,

00:27:47.610 --> 00:27:51.100
because suddenly we had
to deal with urban warfare

00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:53.694
and we had to deal with this
biological weapons threat.

00:27:57.490 --> 00:28:01.060
But you cannot prepare
for everything,

00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:04.300
and what happened to DARPA in
the early days of the Gulf War

00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:11.200
was that a $25 homemade bomb
called a IED was very quickly

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:15.300
became responsible for
63% of coalition deaths.

00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:18.790
And suddenly we were
spending-- We spent $6 billion

00:28:18.790 --> 00:28:23.630
trying to create technology
called Defeat the IED

00:28:23.630 --> 00:28:25.720
technology, and this
involved computers.

00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:29.200
We created jammers to
try to jam the IEDs,

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:32.980
and then the terrorists would
create anti-jamming devices,

00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:36.610
and this went on and on,
and many, many people died.

00:28:36.610 --> 00:28:38.710
I write about
different technologies

00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:41.480
that were looked at
during the war on terror

00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:45.650
by DARPA in this process.

00:28:45.650 --> 00:28:48.890
So then the-- Finally one of
the solutions was the robots.

00:28:48.890 --> 00:28:51.190
And that is a Talon
robot, and it's

00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:54.050
an example of-- at
least to the EOD techs

00:28:54.050 --> 00:28:57.770
that I spoke with--
of how robots

00:28:57.770 --> 00:28:59.490
are saving lives in warfare.

00:28:59.490 --> 00:29:05.600
These robots can go in and do
a lot with looking at the IEDs

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:07.990
and sending back
information to operators

00:29:07.990 --> 00:29:12.820
and even remotely
dismantling some of them.

00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:15.430
But another idea
that sprang forth

00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:18.660
was this idea-- from
the electronic fence.

00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:21.140
DARPA pumped an
enormous amount of money

00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:23.650
into its urban
operation programs,

00:29:23.650 --> 00:29:28.090
and it created a system
called Combat Zones That See.

00:29:28.090 --> 00:29:32.190
And that little WASP
drone there being

00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:34.440
shot off the arm
of an operator is--

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:36.870
it weighs just a
few pounds, and it

00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:39.240
has some of the most
incredible technology.

00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:40.770
All the specs are in the book.

00:29:40.770 --> 00:29:42.500
It flies in a swarm.

00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:45.840
If one of them is lost, the
others will reconfigure.

00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:49.430
And what they're doing is
taking an audio of an area.

00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:52.360
So for example, if the unit
goes into the war theater

00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:55.370
and they understand that there's
a terrorist hideout over there,

00:29:55.370 --> 00:29:58.170
they'll send the
WASPs in, and they

00:29:58.170 --> 00:30:02.050
will be taking video
and audio in real time

00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:05.690
and painting the picture for
the operators on the ground.

00:30:05.690 --> 00:30:10.070
The robots have moved
so quickly into a kind

00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:12.060
of advanced
technology world where

00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:14.100
it's really impossible
to even consider

00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:15.780
how fast things are moving.

00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:19.620
This is called the Modular
Advanced Armed Robotic System.

00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:22.530
It can kill a human
target two miles away.

00:30:22.530 --> 00:30:25.070
It has everything
that was ever designed

00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:28.950
in Vietnam shrunken down to
the size of my fingernail,

00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:30.660
and more.

00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:32.700
It also has encryption
software, so that no one

00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:33.980
can get a hold of it.

00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:40.510
But this is where our
defense systems are going.

00:30:40.510 --> 00:30:43.150
And there we have
the Atlas robot.

00:30:43.150 --> 00:30:44.740
Same thing.

00:30:44.740 --> 00:30:47.060
Looking more and
more like people

00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:49.320
for a very important reason.

00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:51.630
These are actually
the L3 robots.

00:30:51.630 --> 00:30:54.110
They carry the load.

00:30:54.110 --> 00:30:56.610
But what's also
fascinating about the L3

00:30:56.610 --> 00:31:00.300
is that it works on an
operator's voice command.

00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:04.120
So the commanding officer
talks to the robot

00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:06.820
through a headpiece
and it follows.

00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:09.280
And if you've ever
seen these in video,

00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:10.840
it's astonishing
what they can do.

00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:13.180
I mean, they can fall
over and get back up.

00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:15.750
They can climb terrain.

00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:18.760
But again, these are
just the DARPA robots

00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:21.050
that we know about.

00:31:21.050 --> 00:31:26.230
I went to Los Alamos to
look at the synthetic brain

00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:27.740
that DARPA is
creating out there.

00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:29.323
This was the only
picture I could get.

00:31:29.323 --> 00:31:32.350
It just shows the force
protection outside.

00:31:32.350 --> 00:31:36.980
Inside, DARPA's using what's
left of this IBM Roadrunner

00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:40.180
supercomputer, which
in 2008 was the fastest

00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:41.830
computer in the world.

00:31:41.830 --> 00:31:43.450
It has since become obsolete.

00:31:43.450 --> 00:31:45.520
It was $100 million to build.

00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:48.060
But of course, Los Alamos
needs the best computer

00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:52.370
that there is, so-- And
they can't reuse it,

00:31:52.370 --> 00:31:54.340
because it has the
nuclear codes on it.

00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:56.330
So they're incinerating it.

00:31:56.330 --> 00:31:58.650
But in the meantime,
little pieces of it

00:31:58.650 --> 00:32:02.420
are being used to help power
this synthetic brain, which

00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:04.490
really begged the question
for me-- I was, like,

00:32:04.490 --> 00:32:06.150
is that a good idea?

00:32:06.150 --> 00:32:09.480
But you know, what
I really think,

00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:11.490
and what I write about
in the end of the book--

00:32:11.490 --> 00:32:13.615
And I'm going to leave you
with this thought, which

00:32:13.615 --> 00:32:18.150
is that the idea of dual use.

00:32:18.150 --> 00:32:20.289
All technology has dual use.

00:32:20.289 --> 00:32:22.080
And you often hear--
You know, the Iranians

00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:24.640
are always getting in trouble
for dual use technologies.

00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:28.170
But DARPA does this too,
and here's an example.

00:32:28.170 --> 00:32:33.350
This is this incredible
prosthetic that DARPA makes.

00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:38.110
But from the guys I spoke to
who actually use this limb,

00:32:38.110 --> 00:32:42.120
it's really not as incredible
as it's often cracked up to be.

00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:43.360
There are problems with it.

00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:45.770
And so most of the
guys who use this,

00:32:45.770 --> 00:32:47.700
or who appear on "60
Minutes" or whatnot

00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:50.430
showing how great the
prosthetic is, they go home

00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:53.030
and they put back on their
Dorrance hook, which is

00:32:53.030 --> 00:32:57.470
that hook from 1922 technology.

00:32:57.470 --> 00:32:58.790
So this looks good.

00:32:58.790 --> 00:33:00.330
But is it really working?

00:33:00.330 --> 00:33:04.010
And what I believe
is going on at DARPA

00:33:04.010 --> 00:33:06.200
is that this dual
use technology,

00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:10.960
the synthetic brain,
the robots, we're

00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:13.760
moving-- I found a document
at the Defense Department that

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:16.180
talks about human-robot
interaction,

00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:19.960
and that that is the movement
that the Pentagon is taking us

00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:22.350
toward, which is where
robots and humans learn

00:33:22.350 --> 00:33:23.830
to sort of love each other.

00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:26.990
And the idea that
we are creating

00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:28.980
cyborg drones, which we are.

00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:30.900
We now have rats
that we can control.

00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:35.500
We have moths that we
can steer at DARPA.

00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:39.460
Getting, you know, humans
to be ultimately turning

00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:42.630
over the reins to
autonomous weapons.

00:33:42.630 --> 00:33:46.050
And one of the ways
in which-- that

00:33:46.050 --> 00:33:50.420
I find difficulty in wrapping
my head around this-- and DARPA

00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:53.700
was one of the few places they
absolutely would not let me go,

00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:57.200
which was interviewing
soldiers who now have come back

00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:01.040
from that war in Iraq, the
wars in Iraq and Afghanistan,

00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:02.950
with traumatic brain injuries.

00:34:02.950 --> 00:34:05.260
There are 300,000
of these soldiers.

00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:11.020
And the programs that DARPA has
put brain chips in the brain

00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:15.040
and are working with
sending electronic signals.

00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:17.429
In some cases, if the
soldiers have PTSD,

00:34:17.429 --> 00:34:20.260
it's a kind of electroshock
therapy on the go.

00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:23.260
In other cases, they're
trying to repair

00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:24.870
cognitive functioning.

00:34:24.870 --> 00:34:29.699
But it really does beg the
question, what is the dual use?

00:34:29.699 --> 00:34:32.110
And from the scientists
that I have interviewed,

00:34:32.110 --> 00:34:34.310
it appears that
DARPA now believes

00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:38.400
that that brain-computer
interface technology there

00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:41.989
will push us toward that
artificial intelligence which

00:34:41.989 --> 00:34:46.230
has long been sought and
coveted and has not yet

00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:47.440
been attainable.

00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:50.300
And the Jason scientists
who I spoke to-- these

00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:54.039
are old men who passed
on some words of wisdom,

00:34:54.039 --> 00:34:55.830
said that they-- and
showed me this report.

00:34:55.830 --> 00:34:59.330
They had written a report saying
DARPA should not be doing this.

00:34:59.330 --> 00:35:02.790
This is a dangerous area to get
into, because it is leading us

00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:05.380
toward brain control.

00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:09.000
And so DARPA has just
in the past few years

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.290
pushed the Jason
scientists aside,

00:35:11.290 --> 00:35:14.750
and now takes their advice
from an in-house Pentagon

00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:18.570
organization called the
Defense Science Board.

00:35:18.570 --> 00:35:20.820
My final image I'm going
to leave you with is this.

00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:24.130
This is actually
Allen Macy Dulles,

00:35:24.130 --> 00:35:26.290
the CIA director's only son.

00:35:26.290 --> 00:35:28.150
He's 84 years old.

00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:29.300
There he is.

00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:32.970
He was the brain-- He had
a brain injury in Korea.

00:35:32.970 --> 00:35:33.909
He disappeared.

00:35:33.909 --> 00:35:34.950
No one knew he was alive.

00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:35.760
I tracked him down.

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:39.547
That's his sister, a
delightful woman, Joan Dulles.

00:35:39.547 --> 00:35:41.380
She's been taking care
of him all this time.

00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:43.415
She was a Jungian analyst.

00:35:43.415 --> 00:35:47.520
But he cannot remember anything
from 10 minutes before.

00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:52.670
His entire life he only
remembers up to November 1952.

00:35:52.670 --> 00:35:54.730
And because he was
this brilliant man when

00:35:54.730 --> 00:35:58.460
he was young, or boy when he
was young-- He went to Princeton

00:35:58.460 --> 00:36:01.260
and he studied warfare,
and then he went to Oxford

00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:02.590
and got a PhD.

00:36:02.590 --> 00:36:04.790
And I sat with him in
his home and talked

00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:08.240
about the most incredible
historical ideas about warfare.

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:11.050
I mean, it was like speaking
to the most erudite person

00:36:11.050 --> 00:36:12.230
you could imagine.

00:36:12.230 --> 00:36:14.100
But then I said to
him, Allen, will you

00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:16.360
remember this conversation
in 10 minutes?

00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:18.340
And he said no, and he wouldn't.

00:36:18.340 --> 00:36:20.090
And I asked him what
he had for breakfast,

00:36:20.090 --> 00:36:21.210
and he doesn't remember.

00:36:21.210 --> 00:36:26.270
And he won't remember having
been with me after I left.

00:36:26.270 --> 00:36:27.890
And the reason
why I bring him up

00:36:27.890 --> 00:36:30.450
is because it was astonishing
to me, because this--

00:36:30.450 --> 00:36:33.510
And by the way, he lost
hearing in one ear.

00:36:33.510 --> 00:36:37.700
So he talks through this device
that's like 1980s technology.

00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:40.980
He's got an earpiece, and Joan
holds this little thing out

00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:42.410
and I talk into it.

00:36:42.410 --> 00:36:45.450
And he was amazed at
this high technology,

00:36:45.450 --> 00:36:47.870
right, because all of
the technology he knows

00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:50.540
is from before 1952.

00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:52.600
And he can apparently
remember a little bit

00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:55.200
about this technology because
it's with him every day.

00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:58.580
But what I would like to
remind you of is this,

00:36:58.580 --> 00:37:01.445
is that Carl Sagan
once said, if you're

00:37:01.445 --> 00:37:02.820
going to create
a world-- and I'm

00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:06.300
paraphrasing-- where science and
technology is beyond anyone's

00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:09.280
understanding, that's suicide.

00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:11.860
And Allen Dulles
gets a pass on that,

00:37:11.860 --> 00:37:17.470
because he doesn't remember
and he can't remember.

00:37:17.470 --> 00:37:21.440
But I believe the rest of
us, what President Eisenhower

00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:25.570
called an alert and
knowledgeable citizenry,

00:37:25.570 --> 00:37:31.250
we have a responsibility to
remain alert and knowledgeable,

00:37:31.250 --> 00:37:33.880
and to know what's going
on, and to be aware of it.

00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:36.950
And that is where, in
the words of Eisenhower,

00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:39.540
the military-industrial
complex and democracy

00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:41.920
can live together and flourish.

00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:42.890
Thank you so much.

00:37:42.890 --> 00:37:44.195
I'll now take some questions.

00:37:44.195 --> 00:37:47.590
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:51.970 --> 00:37:54.230
AUDIENCE: What proportion
of ARPA's work is public

00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:57.590
and what proportion is not?

00:37:57.590 --> 00:37:59.030
If I were to [INAUDIBLE]?

00:38:02.872 --> 00:38:04.705
ANNIE JACOBSEN: You
mean in the present day?

00:38:04.705 --> 00:38:05.150
AUDIENCE: No.

00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:07.191
Let's say when we worked--
well, when I worked on

00:38:07.191 --> 00:38:08.190
it was a long time ago.

00:38:08.190 --> 00:38:11.698
But over time, how many
projects have been secret

00:38:11.698 --> 00:38:13.825
and how maybe have been public?

00:38:13.825 --> 00:38:15.950
ANNIE JACOBSEN: Well, for
starters, DARPA's working

00:38:15.950 --> 00:38:19.500
on 100 of projects
at any given time,

00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:21.940
and thousands of scientists,
probably tens of thousands

00:38:21.940 --> 00:38:22.630
of scientists.

00:38:22.630 --> 00:38:25.960
So I look at it
from a reverse point

00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:29.230
of view, which is
looking back at history

00:38:29.230 --> 00:38:31.140
and looking at documents.

00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:34.260
I'm only seeing
declassified documents that

00:38:34.260 --> 00:38:37.090
are stamped in a certain
manner-- Top Secret, Secret,

00:38:37.090 --> 00:38:39.790
or No Dissemination.

00:38:39.790 --> 00:38:45.650
So I don't know that it's
possible to be able to know,

00:38:45.650 --> 00:38:49.580
you know, on a pie chart of how
much of its work is classified.

00:38:49.580 --> 00:38:52.900
But my guess is it would be
more like a Titanic structure.

00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:55.450
You know, that the tip is what
we know about at any given

00:38:55.450 --> 00:38:58.640
time, and the real research
is going on down here.

00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:01.990
Because scientists
that I interview often

00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:04.660
work-- the ones that work
on declassified programs--

00:39:04.660 --> 00:39:07.150
For example, I read about
a limb regeneration lab

00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:10.470
in Irvine, California,
which is fascinating.

00:39:10.470 --> 00:39:13.680
And their project
is all unclassified,

00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:16.090
but they give the
technology to DARPA,

00:39:16.090 --> 00:39:17.970
and then DARPA takes
that technology

00:39:17.970 --> 00:39:22.070
and puts it into
classified programs.

00:39:22.070 --> 00:39:22.570
Yes.

00:39:22.570 --> 00:39:28.270
AUDIENCE: So I know that an area
of concern for a lot of people

00:39:28.270 --> 00:39:31.643
in military technology
is whether we

00:39:31.643 --> 00:39:36.500
should take human beings out
of the fire control loop.

00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:39.184
I worked in the
1990s on training

00:39:39.184 --> 00:39:44.064
for the Aegis-class
cruisers, and in the training

00:39:44.064 --> 00:39:46.504
we told people basically
that the computer is

00:39:46.504 --> 00:39:48.700
much smarter than you are,
it understands the combat

00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:50.408
theater better
than you, and when

00:39:50.408 --> 00:39:53.340
the computer says
shoot, just shoot,

00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:55.405
which was troubling to me.

00:39:55.405 --> 00:40:00.534
You talk about the notion
that a responsible citizenry

00:40:00.534 --> 00:40:05.510
needs to sort of apply
checks and balances.

00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:11.054
But given the history of DARPA
and other organizations--

00:40:11.054 --> 00:40:13.489
so perhaps your Manhattan's
another good example--

00:40:13.489 --> 00:40:18.134
to do very large scale things
over non-trivial timeframes

00:40:18.134 --> 00:40:23.779
with near-absolute secrecy, how
does a responsible citizenry

00:40:23.779 --> 00:40:30.667
stop something like weapons that
are in a combat theater that

00:40:30.667 --> 00:40:35.050
have autonomous fire control
and have serious fire control

00:40:35.050 --> 00:40:39.129
bugs, which is, I think,
one of the major concerns

00:40:39.129 --> 00:40:41.560
about the autonomy
of the fire control.

00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:43.610
So what do we do so we
avoid that happening?

00:40:43.610 --> 00:40:44.740
ANNIE JACOBSEN: So
that's a great question.

00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:46.240
And I'm going to add
one little detail which

00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:47.615
you might find
interesting, which

00:40:47.615 --> 00:40:49.970
is that when the
Pentagon came out

00:40:49.970 --> 00:40:54.250
with its roadmap for weapons
through 2038, autonomous

00:40:54.250 --> 00:40:57.100
weapons, drones,
unmanned technologies,

00:40:57.100 --> 00:40:59.580
it created kind of a
problem inside the Pentagon,

00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:02.840
in that many of the
generals, and also

00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:06.990
drone operators on down, did not
want to move in that direction.

00:41:06.990 --> 00:41:09.930
There was a lot of what
Ashton Carter, who was then

00:41:09.930 --> 00:41:11.660
the Undersecretary
of Defense, called

00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:14.230
unfortunate negative feedback.

00:41:14.230 --> 00:41:17.970
And so they created a
program called robot ethics,

00:41:17.970 --> 00:41:19.830
and this was taught
at the Pentagon.

00:41:19.830 --> 00:41:22.290
And the result of that was
exactly the problem that you're

00:41:22.290 --> 00:41:25.800
indicating, even more
dissent from generals

00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:27.510
down to drone
operators saying we

00:41:27.510 --> 00:41:29.240
don't trust this,
and the reason why

00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:32.890
had to do with what was called
robot ethics, that robots don't

00:41:32.890 --> 00:41:35.190
have ethics, that they
don't have morality.

00:41:35.190 --> 00:41:38.730
So then the Pentagon created a
program called the robot ethics

00:41:38.730 --> 00:41:42.210
program to educate people about
it, and the problem persisted.

00:41:42.210 --> 00:41:45.820
So I found out that DARPA
is now working on the answer

00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:48.090
to that, in my estimation.

00:41:48.090 --> 00:41:50.980
DARPA's working on a new program
called Narrative Networks.

00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:56.350
It's a very innocuous
sounding program title.

00:41:56.350 --> 00:41:59.700
But what it is working with
a chemical in the brain

00:41:59.700 --> 00:42:04.340
called oxytocin, which
manipulates a person's trust

00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:07.190
and loses their sense of fear.

00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:11.270
And so when you look at that
that might be the answer,

00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:14.400
then an alert and
knowledgeable citizenry

00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:16.550
can draw their own conclusions.

00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:20.060
Both of those subject
matters are unclassified.

00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:25.920
But by being knowledgeable,
you can put A and B together,

00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:28.900
and in that example, I had
never seen A and B together.

00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:31.720
I had read some things
about what the heck is DARPA

00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:33.510
doing with a narrative program.

00:42:33.510 --> 00:42:36.920
Well, let's find out what the
narrative program really is.

00:42:40.420 --> 00:42:42.252
Questions?

00:42:42.252 --> 00:42:43.710
All these smart
people in the room.

00:42:43.710 --> 00:42:46.910
There have to be some questions.

00:42:46.910 --> 00:42:47.990
Or you know everything.

00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:50.810
Everything I said
was already known.

00:42:53.590 --> 00:42:57.408
AUDIENCE: So tell us a little
bit about the management style.

00:42:57.408 --> 00:43:00.541
When I worked on
ARPA projects, it

00:43:00.541 --> 00:43:03.674
was typically called a program
director or program manager.

00:43:03.674 --> 00:43:05.487
I forget what the title was.

00:43:05.487 --> 00:43:06.986
We seemed to have
a lot of autonomy,

00:43:06.986 --> 00:43:09.950
and we seemed to
have-- seemed to count

00:43:09.950 --> 00:43:12.213
a lot on his personal
relationships

00:43:12.213 --> 00:43:16.596
with principal
investigators, PIs.

00:43:16.596 --> 00:43:19.310
Is that the style of
management everywhere?

00:43:19.310 --> 00:43:22.569
Is that only in the
academia-facing side of ARPA?

00:43:22.569 --> 00:43:24.110
ANNIE JACOBSEN: From
what I've heard,

00:43:24.110 --> 00:43:25.200
that is exactly the same.

00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:29.300
There are about 120 program
managers at DARPA today,

00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:31.514
as there have been
through its history.

00:43:31.514 --> 00:43:32.680
And you're absolutely right.

00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:35.600
Those program managers
have serious autonomy.

00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:39.750
I mean, they have $50
or $150 million budgets

00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:41.200
at their discretion.

00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:43.710
They hire university labs.

00:43:43.710 --> 00:43:45.820
They hire military labs.

00:43:45.820 --> 00:43:49.130
And then they begin to put
their programs in effect,

00:43:49.130 --> 00:43:50.790
and they can really
start and stop

00:43:50.790 --> 00:43:52.830
just about anything they want.

00:43:52.830 --> 00:43:56.710
So it is one of--
The organization

00:43:56.710 --> 00:44:00.150
is almost entirely free from
red tape in that regard.

00:44:00.150 --> 00:44:03.450
And I was actually interviewing
one of the CIA fellows

00:44:03.450 --> 00:44:07.970
who set up the early
design for IARPA, which

00:44:07.970 --> 00:44:11.260
is the CIA's DARPA, in essence.

00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:13.550
And you know, the
two organizations

00:44:13.550 --> 00:44:18.010
don't always compliment one
another, to put it politely.

00:44:18.010 --> 00:44:20.710
But in this
situation, the Agency

00:44:20.710 --> 00:44:25.290
was very complementary
about how flexible

00:44:25.290 --> 00:44:29.510
and how financially
swift DARPA was,

00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:30.838
how they were able to do that.

00:44:35.157 --> 00:44:35.990
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:39.370
I guess, to sort
of follow up here.

00:44:39.370 --> 00:44:40.694
That's part of the answer.

00:44:40.694 --> 00:44:44.656
The other issue
was the ones I saw,

00:44:44.656 --> 00:44:48.750
they weren't bureaucrats,
these program managers.

00:44:48.750 --> 00:44:50.628
They would say,
I want this done,

00:44:50.628 --> 00:44:53.380
and they would have an
idea of is this going well.

00:44:53.380 --> 00:44:54.657
Well, you know, no.

00:44:54.657 --> 00:44:55.990
I don't like the way it's going.

00:44:55.990 --> 00:44:57.460
Change it around.

00:44:57.460 --> 00:45:01.223
It wasn't at all what you
see in a more formal contract

00:45:01.223 --> 00:45:03.660
structure, where you say, OK,
you have a year to do this,

00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:06.000
here are the milestones,
again, we'll review it.

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:07.830
It was, we're three months in.

00:45:07.830 --> 00:45:09.843
I'm not seeing
what I want to see.

00:45:09.843 --> 00:45:12.674
I'm going to pull the plug
and go to someone else.

00:45:12.674 --> 00:45:14.340
ANNIE JACOBSEN: You're
absolutely right.

00:45:14.340 --> 00:45:16.940
And the program managers
themselves are often--

00:45:16.940 --> 00:45:19.300
or most of the time are--
very gifted scientists

00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:19.890
and engineers.

00:45:19.890 --> 00:45:21.640
That's who they put in charge.

00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:23.310
In the book, I
write about someone

00:45:23.310 --> 00:45:24.950
who I can think of
no better example,

00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:29.450
Doctor Jack Thorpe, who created
the first training program

00:45:29.450 --> 00:45:34.305
for DARPA using internet
technology, called SIMNET,

00:45:34.305 --> 00:45:37.180
and "Wired" magazine
called Thorpe

00:45:37.180 --> 00:45:38.990
the father of cyberspace.

00:45:38.990 --> 00:45:42.710
And you see his own talents
applied in exactly that

00:45:42.710 --> 00:45:43.910
manner you're talking about.

00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:46.270
He's having a problem
with this technology,

00:45:46.270 --> 00:45:49.010
so he bends and moves
and brings other people

00:45:49.010 --> 00:45:52.100
on board that can
solve it, which

00:45:52.100 --> 00:45:53.730
is unusual for government.

00:45:53.730 --> 00:45:55.410
You normally have
these long tags

00:45:55.410 --> 00:45:58.110
of things that get
pushed through a system.

00:45:58.110 --> 00:46:01.510
So to have these people--
most of them men-- who

00:46:01.510 --> 00:46:03.120
are able to just
make decisions happen

00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:04.161
like that is astonishing.

00:46:10.132 --> 00:46:11.340
I think that'll do it for us.

00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:12.747
Thank you all so
much for coming,

00:46:12.747 --> 00:46:14.580
and I hope you have a
great rest of the day.

00:46:14.580 --> 00:46:17.930
[APPLAUSE]
