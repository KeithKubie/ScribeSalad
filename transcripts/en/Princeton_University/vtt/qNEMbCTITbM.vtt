00:00:01.262 --> 00:00:03.220
IAGO ROBERTSON-LAVALLE: Butler
College actually brought

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:04.840
in an artist, Will Kasso.

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:08.860
And he's here to help
us paint a mural.

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.110
And we're going to be
putting it in Butler College,

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:12.100
here at Princeton.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.250
We actually gathered, I'd
say, around 15 students

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.050
in order to conceptualize
this project.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.860
And we talked about issues
that have happened on campus

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.956
as well as great forms of change
that have happened on campus.

00:00:24.956 --> 00:00:26.830
TJ SMITH: The process
was really interesting.

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.790
I found it really, really fun
to be in a small workshop group

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:34.840
and just be able to throw things
out there, sketch things out.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.660
To have the white men
kind of spreading apart

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.460
to have a black woman
coming forward --

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.074
because we're having the
50th anniversary of Princeton

00:00:43.074 --> 00:00:44.740
admitting women, so
we thought that that

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.780
was a really important thing
to include in some way, shape,

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:48.550
or form.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:49.966
IAGO ROBERTSON-LAVALLE:
It's not every day

00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:51.460
that you get a
chance to, I think,

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.260
leave your mark on
Princeton University.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.484
So for me it was an opportunity
that I could not miss.

00:00:57.484 --> 00:00:59.275
WILL KASSO CONDRY: Most
of our environments

00:00:59.275 --> 00:01:02.110
are these stark, really
bland environments.

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.140
As soon as you start to
put up color and artwork,

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.406
it opens people's minds up.

00:01:07.406 --> 00:01:08.780
Think about ancient
civilizations

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.350
like Rome, Greece, Egypt.

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.480
Everything was
painted -- everything.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.390
We looking at it now thousands
of years later in these ruins.

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.700
But everything was painted --

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:19.450
inside, outside.

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.824
And these were some of the
most enlightened civilizations

00:01:21.824 --> 00:01:22.372
of our time.

00:01:22.372 --> 00:01:26.350
The majority of my early
work has been in Trenton.

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.030
When I would go
out and paint, you

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.570
will automatically -- when
you're doing public work,

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.000
you're going to draw attention.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.200
Typically when you go
into a neighborhood

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.970
that you're not from,
people are going

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.010
to be apprehensive about
you, regardless of what

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:37.360
your intentions are there.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.892
So you bring people to you.

00:01:38.892 --> 00:01:40.350
You let them know
what you're doing

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.806
and take their ideas into
consideration as well.

00:01:42.806 --> 00:01:43.930
And that's the start of it.

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.260
You have to be social in
doing community murals

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:48.210
and doing public art.

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.350
It's an opportunity
for me to educate them

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.240
and also to be educated
about the area.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.640
Because there's certain things
that I may not know that

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.920
are pivotal to the
outcome of the product.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.150
It's basically like the
students wrote a script.

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.460
And me as the illustrator,
I illustrate the script.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.750
And then we all have a hand at
producing the final product.

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.350
So five days later, I feel
I've made some new friends.

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.210
And I hope they
feel the same way.

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:13.270
TJ SMITH: I think I bring
something that's inherently

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.080
me and is only my perspective
as an international,

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.650
as a queer person,
as a white person,

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.940
as all these identities that
I have mingling within myself.

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.370
So I was really excited
to have the opportunity

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.460
to add something to the
campus that is tangible

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:31.701
and that you could see.

00:02:31.701 --> 00:02:33.700
IAGO ROBERTSON-LAVALLE: I was
very surprised and happily

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.430
surprised, I would say,
that students took this

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.590
as an opportunity not only to
show their artistic talents,

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.390
but also to send messages that
they would like to send maybe

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.930
to the University or to
peers here at Princeton.

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.080
WILL KASSO CONDRY: You know,
art is that missing link

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.390
when you're talking about
building community relations.

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.680
What we're doing is bringing
awareness to a history

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.560
that most have no
idea that took place.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.540
And whether they
love it or hate it,

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.510
it's going to initiate
a conversation.

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.142
And then that's the
basis of any change

00:03:05.142 --> 00:03:06.475
is just you have to communicate.

00:03:06.475 --> 00:03:09.180
