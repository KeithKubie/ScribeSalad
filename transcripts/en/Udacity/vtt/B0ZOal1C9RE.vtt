00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:04.240
Now you have the tools to build fluid designs from previous lessons. And you can

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.130
adapt those designs to radically different scenarios using

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:09.740
media queries. The only thing that's still missing

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.830
is how to make images look beautiful,

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:14.790
across all these different devices and screens. So

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:15.900
that's what we're going to take on in the

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.390
next lesson, when we dive into adaptive images.
