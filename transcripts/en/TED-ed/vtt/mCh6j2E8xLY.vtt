00:00:04.935 --> 00:00:08.563
StoryCorps Founder &amp; TED Prize winner
Davey Isay has created an app that aims

00:00:08.563 --> 00:00:12.340
to bring people together in a project of 
listening, connection, and generosity.

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:13.136
Here's why...

00:00:13.136 --> 00:00:16.545
This is the library of lost stories.

00:00:16.545 --> 00:00:20.721
It's where you'll find the true origins
of the Sphinx and Stonehenge,

00:00:20.721 --> 00:00:23.388
the text lost in the fire of Alexandria,

00:00:23.388 --> 00:00:27.820
all of the great ideas 
that Einstein never thought to write down,

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.124
the dream you can't quite 
remember from last night,

00:00:32.124 --> 00:00:34.750
your ancestor's first words,

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:41.660
her last words.

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.803
And it's the fastest growing library
in the world.

00:00:44.803 --> 00:00:46.611
In the next year,

00:00:46.611 --> 00:00:49.885
25 languages will be added
to the collection,

00:00:49.885 --> 00:00:53.317
never to be heard aloud again,

00:00:53.317 --> 00:00:57.853
50 million points of view
never related,

00:00:57.853 --> 00:01:03.311
the last eyewitness account
of an incredible act of athleticism,

00:01:03.311 --> 00:01:04.661
disobedience,

00:01:04.661 --> 00:01:06.292
courage,

00:01:06.292 --> 00:01:07.478
unread,

00:01:07.478 --> 00:01:09.078
unheard,

00:01:09.078 --> 00:01:15.448
unwatched.

00:01:15.448 --> 00:01:20.135
But this is the StoryCorps archive
at the Library of Congress

00:01:20.135 --> 00:01:25.464
where everything recorded by StoryCorps
is preserved for posterity.

00:01:25.464 --> 00:01:26.743
This is where,

00:01:26.743 --> 00:01:28.444
if you record your parents,

00:01:28.444 --> 00:01:29.638
your grandparents,

00:01:29.638 --> 00:01:30.924
your neighbors,

00:01:30.924 --> 00:01:32.942
your children,

00:01:32.942 --> 00:01:37.052
their stories will live on.

00:01:37.052 --> 00:01:43.929
What if Anne Frank hadn't kept her diary?

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:48.272
What if no one could listen to
Martin Luther King's Mountaintop speech?

00:01:48.272 --> 00:01:58.199
What if the camera hadn't been rolling
during the first moon landing?

00:01:58.199 --> 00:02:00.994
But what if, this Thanksgiving,

00:02:00.994 --> 00:02:06.149
the youngest member of every family
interviewed the oldest?

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.616
"It's like the only thing on his mind
was to tell the kids that he loved them."

00:02:10.616 --> 00:02:16.268
Or if on February 14th, you asked a person
you love some questions

00:02:16.268 --> 00:02:18.841
you've never thought to ask.

00:02:18.841 --> 00:02:21.371
"Being married is like having
a color television set,

00:02:21.371 --> 00:02:23.585
you never want to go back 
to black and white."

00:02:23.585 --> 00:02:26.125
History is all of these things,

00:02:26.125 --> 00:02:28.078
the testament to tragedy,

00:02:28.078 --> 00:02:30.171
the progress of civilization,

00:02:30.171 --> 00:02:32.032
the heroic triumphs,

00:02:32.032 --> 00:02:36.827
and the moments and stories
that are our lives.

00:02:36.827 --> 00:02:41.511
It's also the act of actively listening
to the voices of the past

00:02:41.511 --> 00:02:44.150
and the people who matter to us.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.746
"Grand Central Station, now,

00:02:46.746 --> 00:02:50.728
we know there's an architect, 
but who hung the iron?

00:02:50.728 --> 00:02:53.908
Who were the brick masons?

00:02:53.908 --> 00:02:56.126
Who swept the floor?

00:02:56.126 --> 00:02:58.721
Who kept the trains going?

00:02:58.721 --> 00:03:02.992
We shall begin celebrating the lives
of the uncelebrated."

00:03:02.992 --> 00:03:07.455
So you can make history
by recording it.
