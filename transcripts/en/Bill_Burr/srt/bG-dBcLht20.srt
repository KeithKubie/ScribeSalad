It's just a, you know, it's
everything you want to see. You know,

19
00:01:16,121 --> 00:01:17,350
it's a,
it's,

20
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:22,380
it's conflicting groups of people duking
it out with not a lot of skillful and

you just get to sit there and enjoy it.
Um,

22
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:30,070

a lot of maniacs there. Uh,

23
00:01:30,071 --> 00:01:33,370
as you know, Youngstown
is no joke. All right?

24
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:37,960
And I can't wait to be there and not
fight anybody like the coward that I am.

25
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:43,450
Having said that, let me be, uh,

26
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:47,860
let me live my best life.
Let me be a hero to myself.

27
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:53,610
My goals for the second half of
2018 is to be my own personal hero.

28
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:57,190
Okay.

29
00:01:57,190 --> 00:02:00,100
These fucking social media people,
have you ever like,

30
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,530
there's nothing, I don't know. I
didn't know where to begin with this.

31
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:10,330
If I see one more fucking fat,
miserable loser

32
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:16,110
was wearing a tee shirt that has
some sort of self help, advice to me,

33
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:20,160
like they've reached the Mecca of peace
and happiness. It's just like, Ooh,

34
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,100
is that fucking tee shirt for you?
As is it for me?

35
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:26,850
You know,
I just saw this,

36
00:02:26,851 --> 00:02:31,510
this fucking miserable look in person
sitting down in the airport, you know,

37
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:37,530
tens and tens and tens of fucking pounds
overweight eating shit food with a tee

38
00:02:37,901 --> 00:02:41,380
shirt that says love yourself.
You know what I mean?

39
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:42,970
And all of this fucking crap.

40
00:02:42,971 --> 00:02:47,170
Now will you pat people on the back
because they're fucking up their lives,

41
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:51,160
but they still feel good about,
you know what? I like who I am.

42
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,140
I'm not saying you shouldn't
like who you are, but I mean,

43
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,860
you gotta look at yourself in the mirror
at some point. It just be like, dude,

44
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:58,570
the fuck are we doing here?

45
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,083
You know,

46
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:07,190
not saying I'm perfect.
I'm not a perfect person,

47
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,940
right? But I'm not, you know,

48
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:13,070
sitting around here like
calling myself a hero,

49
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,840
you know,
based off of all my fucking

50
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:19,910
shortcomings,

51
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:24,560
Hollywood puts pressure.

52
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:30,530
[inaudible] is that Hollywood.
Hollywood gives people what they want.

53
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:33,290
All right?
You fucking cons.

54
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:37,070
So sick of everybody
blaming this innocent town

55
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:46,400
we hear in all he would happen
to be some of the, the most,

56
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:51,890
uh, dependable, loyal, honest human
beings you ever get to, mate. Yeah.

57
00:03:51,891 --> 00:03:55,930
I couldn't even get through without
laughing. Whatever. Fuck you this car.

58
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:58,880
This time we'll give you
whatever the fuck you. Bye. Okay.

59
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:02,600
And you've been looking at fucking abs
and big tits since the second they had

60
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:07,370
moving pictures. So I didn't want to
fucking hear it. These fucking assholes,

61
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,793
you know.

62
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,460
Then I liked those other people,
the fucking fat guys with the, uh,

63
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:17,700
with the tough guy. Shit
on this shirt, you know?

64
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:24,120
Do I look like I give a shit? You
know, that's no, no you don't.

65
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:29,220
Yeah, I don't. I, I, I would believe that
you don't give a shit about anything.

66
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:30,541
All right.

67
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:35,541
With you fucking fungus riddled toenails
while wearing your little fucking flip

68
00:04:36,721 --> 00:04:40,310
flops.
Oh my God.

69
00:04:40,311 --> 00:04:41,840
Do you ever see people
that their toe nails,

70
00:04:41,841 --> 00:04:45,650
they look like fucking petrified wood and
they're literally walking around just,

71
00:04:45,651 --> 00:04:50,030
you know, I guess living their best
life but making you look at them.

72
00:04:50,031 --> 00:04:53,880
I swear to God, man. I saw somebody
in airport recently that had a,

73
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:57,860
these flip flops that also had
like this toenail flap on it.

74
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:01,880
Joe Is really excited about,
I hear stomping feet. That
can only mean one thing.

75
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:07,060
Oh, hey buddy, how you doing?

76
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:13,290
Daddy's in here making a fool of
himself running in here. Come on.

77
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:21,990
How big are you getting?

78
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:30,330
Oh, come on. Come on buddy. Do
what your mom says. Trust me.

79
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:35,350
I've tried it the other way.
It doesn't work. All right.

80
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:40,680
The money morning podcast has
been previously interrupted. Oh,

81
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:46,020
somebody is tired. Fly By.
Oh, you want to say hi?

82
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:50,500
Let me give her a hug. Hang on, I'll
get any pause. All right. I'm back.

83
00:05:50,501 --> 00:05:53,020
Crisis averted.
The fuck was I talking about

84
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:59,060
how great people are in
Hollywood? How we are, you know,

85
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:00,430
there's a couple of bad apples.

86
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,810
I'm not going to lie to you if there's
a few people out here, you know,

87
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:07,010
I might be one of those people who knows,
you know?

88
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:13,490
Um, anyways, what was I talking about?

89
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,410
Dog Gone It. Ah, Jesus Christ.

90
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:20,120
They're just interrupted Christ
and fucked up my whole flow.

91
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:22,860
Okay.

92
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:25,470
I Dunno what I was talking. Who
gives a shit, right? What do I pitch?

93
00:06:25,471 --> 00:06:29,700
Stop and go back and fucking
try and listen to it. Um,

94
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:31,913
anyways.

95
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:33,750
Yeah.

96
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:38,130
I have no idea what I was talking about.
Let me plow ahead here. As I always do,

97
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:44,020
I swear to God, this fucking house,
I swear to God, this fucking house,

98
00:06:44,021 --> 00:06:46,240
if it's not one thing,
it's another.

99
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,870
Every time I get I get something fixed.
Something else breaks.

100
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:56,930
You know what I mean? This kid be
what? Owning a house is like. I just,

101
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,990
I had to bond out. There's gotta
be some sort of fucking lemon law.

102
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:07,100
I'm fucking,
it's fucking believable.

103
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:09,810
What are those people?

104
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:13,080
They have a lawyer on retainer that just
means a constantly getting in fucking

105
00:07:13,081 --> 00:07:15,180
trouble. So they're just
constantly paying the fucking guy.

106
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:20,140
I should have a plumber on retainer.
I don't know what that means.

107
00:07:20,141 --> 00:07:24,190
What the fuck does that mean? It just
sounds cool. I have a lawyer on retainer.

108
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,393
Okay.

109
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:30,040
Oh my God. Oh my God. Give me an
idea. What the Fuck my dad does

110
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:33,651
that has got I,

111
00:07:33,651 --> 00:07:38,500
I still cannot get over the fact that
an adult said that to another adult.

112
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:41,800
Do you have any idea what
the fuck my dad does?

113
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:47,130
You know, it's like, it's you like
your there and the other guys there.

114
00:07:47,131 --> 00:07:51,460
You guys are facing off with each other
and then the fucking other du grabs her

115
00:07:51,461 --> 00:07:51,960
by the throat,

116
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,650
throws him down to the ground and
then he stands up and all he has is,

117
00:07:55,651 --> 00:08:00,510
you're fucked. You're fucked.
And I evidently, he walks
away to go get his dad.

118
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:04,390
The kids in his twenties,
Dad,

119
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,370
what's the matter? Is that 35 year old
across the street picking on you again,

120
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:12,953
Sean.

121
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:13,993
Okay.

122
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:14,921
Um,
anyways,

123
00:08:14,921 --> 00:08:19,921
I went down to a comic con all freckles
who's done nothing but make fun of comic

124
00:08:20,681 --> 00:08:23,110
con, um, forever.

125
00:08:23,111 --> 00:08:27,070
I went down there on Thursday because,
uh,

126
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:32,380
Vince and all the guys at better call
Saul were nice enough to ask me to

127
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:37,240
mediate. Is that the word? Basically
host the panel, the better call Saul,

128
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,970
uh, to promote their season
premiere August 6th on AMC, um,

129
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:46,210
season four premiere.
And uh,

130
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,150
and after that, the 10 year, um,

131
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:53,610
breaking bad reunion 10 years
since their first episode debuted,

132
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:56,430
I would think 2008. And, uh,

133
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,030
I went down there and there was all
these people dressed like superheroes.

134
00:09:00,031 --> 00:09:01,200
Most people are not dressed up,

135
00:09:01,201 --> 00:09:04,170
but there's enough people that
dressed up that it was cool.

136
00:09:04,171 --> 00:09:07,980
And I went down there and I gotta tell
you I've really liked those fucking nerds

137
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:10,170
man.
They were really cool people.

138
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,830
I only teased him one time cause I was
saying something that was a spoiler and I

139
00:09:13,831 --> 00:09:17,700
was like, hey spoiler alerts, everybody
saw it last season of better call Saul.

140
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,970
You saw what happened in the last episode
and this dude down front was like,

141
00:09:20,971 --> 00:09:23,010
yeah, I didn't see it.
And I was like, all right,

142
00:09:23,011 --> 00:09:28,011
well a stick a couple of light safers in
your ear because I have to fucking read

143
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,880
this show. Something like
that. And everybody left.

144
00:09:29,881 --> 00:09:31,050
Everybody had a good time with it.

145
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:36,290
I wasn't sure if you know
the self sabotage NB wanted
to walk out and open with

146
00:09:36,601 --> 00:09:38,730
I,
you doin you fucking nerds.

147
00:09:38,731 --> 00:09:42,090
But I just didn't want to
bring them back to high school.

148
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:46,560
I figured I was in their Dojo. I'm going
to be polite. You know what I mean,

149
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:52,590
is fun as it is to do what that fucking
guy on Fox News did that one time when

150
00:09:52,591 --> 00:09:55,830
he went on that show with Barbara Walters,
you know,

151
00:09:55,831 --> 00:10:00,300
remember that half the fucking
crew of them walked off the stage.

152
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,290
I can't remember anybody's
fucking names anymore. Anyways,

153
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:08,520
I was down there and I had a great time
and I flew a with my instructor down

154
00:10:08,521 --> 00:10:11,850
there and an our 44.
It's the first time I've flown.

155
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:16,140
I hadn't flown since the end of
May, you know, it was overseas, uh,

156
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,550
you know, doing gigs and celebrating
my birthday probably far too long,

157
00:10:20,551 --> 00:10:22,980
admittedly. And then the last
week of June, I, you know,

158
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:25,980
at the beginning of July had to get
caught up with all the work that I lost.

159
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:30,480
I missed, I mean, sorry. And uh,
I flew and a, I did all right man,

160
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:31,570
you know,

161
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:36,490
little rusty at first and then all
fucking came back and I had my best f

162
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:37,403
landing.

163
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,140
Yeah.

164
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:43,580
I've ever had as far as uh,
you know,

165
00:10:43,581 --> 00:10:47,780
not having to look at my instruments too
much and just feeling, just failing it,

166
00:10:47,781 --> 00:10:51,950
being common. One with the
fucking machine man, uh,

167
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:57,420
was getting dark out and we came back to
Burbank and we will listen to the 80s,

168
00:10:57,561 --> 00:11:02,000
which is just the information that's
updated every hour for the airport.

169
00:11:02,001 --> 00:11:05,090
You have to listen to it and
some computer voice, you know,

170
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:09,580
we're in Scarborough tow driver, a girl,
your wire up information night gave, okay,

171
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:13,210
so then you get on with Burbank Tower,
like Burbank Tower, helicopter, Blah Blah,

172
00:11:13,211 --> 00:11:16,570
blah, blah, blah, blah blah. [inaudible]
Elica at fucking Hollywood reservoir,

173
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:20,530
a requested full stop at
Atlantic with information Yankee.

174
00:11:20,531 --> 00:11:24,140
So they know you got the
latest information. Then
they tell you what to do. A,

175
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:27,490
there was a bunch of traffic coming in.
So they told us to hold over old Maca,

176
00:11:27,491 --> 00:11:28,990
which is his fucking hunk of shit.

177
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:32,950
Macy's off the one seventies that they're
finally redoing and he just fucking

178
00:11:32,951 --> 00:11:36,850
orbit over there to all the big boys
go in and then they say, you know,

179
00:11:36,851 --> 00:11:38,140
helicopter Blah Blah,
blah,

180
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:43,470
cleared for landing runway eight west
of Delta eight so that you just say all

181
00:11:43,631 --> 00:11:48,250
that shit back. So I said all that
shit back. I come in, they got the uh,

182
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:51,220
the fucking whatever they would
call, you know, those, those fucking,

183
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:55,030
the power lines there.
She that chop your head off.

184
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,540
I flew over the tower like you're
supposed to, not over the wires.

185
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:03,040
And then I was coming in at the right
speed because it was a jet behind me. Um,

186
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,620
but I was a little too high,

187
00:12:05,621 --> 00:12:08,950
so I just banked it really hard using
my gs to make the fucking helicopter

188
00:12:08,951 --> 00:12:12,610
heavier. Don't ask me how physics.
Right. And then it fucking came down.

189
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:16,270
I was going to come down
to like 600 feet permitted,

190
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:19,300
which as long as I'm moving forward
is fine. But as I slowed down,

191
00:12:19,301 --> 00:12:23,200
I got it down to 300 commercial fucking
landing right in the fucking glidepath

192
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,510
right in the numbers and
fucking banged a left on delta.

193
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,170
8:00 AM I instructor goes, that's the
best lesson that you've ever done.

194
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:31,540
The of becoming one with the helicopter.

195
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:33,940
And I turned around and
my wife's in the back end.

196
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,940
Her headphones weren't working and
she didn't hear it. And you know what?

197
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:39,370
I hate to say it. So it was
like, it never happened.

198
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:44,050
And it was literally sitting there like
a five year old talking to my mom going,

199
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,230
dia, did you hear that? Did
you? And she was like, wow,

200
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,453
you know,

201
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:56,150
there's a part of me that
actually thinks she did here,

202
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,800
you know,
but to keep me in fucking line to keep me,

203
00:12:59,801 --> 00:13:02,740
keep chasing the fucking carrot.
She acted like she didn't hear it.

204
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,970
So anyways, um, moving along,

205
00:13:09,971 --> 00:13:12,400
I want to thank everybody on uh,
uh,

206
00:13:12,401 --> 00:13:16,570
the casts of breaking bad and better
call Saul for doing the heavy lifting and

207
00:13:16,571 --> 00:13:20,290
telling the stories and all that. I
mean I was having like a, you know,

208
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:25,350
nightmares about hosting that and meet
turning into the real version of Chris

209
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:29,950
Farley, you know, that that character,
he would do a Paul Mccartney,

210
00:13:29,951 --> 00:13:34,810
remember you and John Lennon you
guys wrote to the white album? Uh,

211
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:38,950
yes Chris. Yes, I do.
Yeah, that was awesome.

212
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:40,690
Like I was worried that I
was going to be doing that.

213
00:13:40,691 --> 00:13:44,980
I'm not going to say there wasn't a
couple moments of that, but, uh, you know,

214
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,230
the whole time I was up there I was like,

215
00:13:47,231 --> 00:13:51,760
why didn't they get Jimmy Kimmel to do
this? That was my first fucking thought.

216
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:56,800
Cause I remember he did. Um, he did the,

217
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:57,760
uh,

218
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,760
when they had the final episode and in
La they did this thing at the Hollywood

219
00:14:03,881 --> 00:14:08,320
forever cemetery and they showed
the, uh, the final episode.

220
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,620
You could sit outside and fucking with
all these other breaking bad fans.

221
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:14,200
It was really a fucking awesome night.

222
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,300
And Kimmel hosted it
and he did a great job.

223
00:14:16,301 --> 00:14:21,301
So I imagine the reason why he didn't
do it was because he had to host his own

224
00:14:22,271 --> 00:14:25,000
show and uh, yeah, that
makes sense. Right.

225
00:14:25,001 --> 00:14:29,710
He had the host is talk show tapes at
five and that was going to be from three

226
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:34,300
to five 30 down in San Diego.
Oh, there we go. Hey you go.

227
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:39,100
That's why all freckles got
called up from the mind, uh,

228
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:40,720
for a cup of coffee,

229
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:44,740
speaking a cut and called up from the
minors and a cup of coffee and all that.

230
00:14:44,741 --> 00:14:49,000
I'm back into watching the Red Sox,
uh, Bradley's paying attention, man.

231
00:14:49,001 --> 00:14:51,070
I'd started with me trying,
like using,

232
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:56,500
listening to baseball as a way to
not flip out and traffic and um,

233
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:01,220
you know,
and just settling in to just not,

234
00:15:01,221 --> 00:15:03,620
I just stopped fighting the
city just like, yeah, man,

235
00:15:03,621 --> 00:15:04,970
this is going to be a lot of traffic.

236
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:08,600
There's going to be a lot of people doing
things that I'm not going to like and

237
00:15:08,601 --> 00:15:10,770
I just need to just,

238
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:15,410
I'm just gonna sit there and watch it
happen and just sort of inch along as I

239
00:15:15,411 --> 00:15:20,411
listened to five innings of a baseball
game and go maybe three quarters of a

240
00:15:20,421 --> 00:15:23,570
mile. That's what I'm going to do.
And that's what I've been doing.

241
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:28,430
And I just listened to the red sox games
and, um, the Red Sox, I'll tell you too,

242
00:15:28,431 --> 00:15:29,900
they're on fire.

243
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,330
I was worried that the all star
break was going to slow them down.

244
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:37,610
Date one 10 out of 11. Um, I'm sorry,

245
00:15:37,611 --> 00:15:41,660
they won 11 out of that 10 11.
They won 11 out of 12.

246
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:43,690
That's right,

247
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:48,580
because he went 10 and all than they lost
one and then they won a ripple for the

248
00:15:48,581 --> 00:15:50,860
all star game. I know. I sound
like the fucking Raymond.

249
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,740
And then we just took two
or three from the Tigers.

250
00:15:53,741 --> 00:15:58,120
So we went 13 out of the last 15. Uh,
and the Yankees just keep winning too.

251
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:00,160
Um,
but I gotta tell you,

252
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:03,040
I watched a little bit of the Astros
who have been watching those guys.

253
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:06,190
I still think they're the team to be.
Um,

254
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:10,600
they had Verlander, they
got a great picture of staff
and they, they got the bats,

255
00:16:10,601 --> 00:16:13,840
they get the whole fucking thing and they
want it last year and nobody's really

256
00:16:13,841 --> 00:16:18,250
talking about and everybody's all
excited for fucking Yankees, red sox and

257
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:23,930
uh, this is what I think.
All right. Yankees bullpens,

258
00:16:23,931 --> 00:16:27,220
socks that's going to come
back and bite him in the ass.

259
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:29,680
And,
uh,

260
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:33,460
Chris sale is our guy and

261
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:39,160
you know, as much as I
love David Price, you know,

262
00:16:39,161 --> 00:16:44,161
he had a really rough outing against the
Yankees in New York and a him cursing

263
00:16:44,951 --> 00:16:46,960
out Dennis Eckersley.
I Dunno,

264
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:52,680
I don't know that that guy was like,
oh, that's a hall of fame a man.

265
00:16:52,681 --> 00:16:54,690
You don't curse out a
fucking hall of Famer.

266
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:59,940
So I'm worried that that guy
is a little, uh, you know,

267
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:05,040
what, are you a little
shaky between the, uh, the,

268
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:08,820
is there little Odell Beckham there?
Right.

269
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:14,940
You know, I dunno. I hope
he is because if he isn't,

270
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:17,460
we got to beast.
He is a beast.

271
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:20,630
But I'm just worried that when he went
down in New York and all those people had

272
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:22,290
buy a fucking

273
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:27,300
kind of imploded rather than being like,

274
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:32,330
I'm going to ruin that fat
mantated singing fucking jackass,

275
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:37,770
Yankee Fan, they still do that roll
call thing. It's like Jesus Christ.

276
00:17:37,771 --> 00:17:41,850
I always feel like a musical is
going to break out after that. Um,

277
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,600
yeah, they do have a lot of that
and then they do the Ymca thing.

278
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:46,710
I mean it's just,
you know,

279
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:50,640
and every time you think that's the
worst thing than sing sweet Caroline.

280
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:51,563
It's just,

281
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:56,010
I don't know what has happened
to both of those franchises.

282
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:01,120
It's so weird how so
much shit just got nicer.

283
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:05,260
But people are so much meaner in a way.

284
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:06,710
Yeah.

285
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:11,360
You know? Thank you. Go to New York
City, like fucking Yankee store.

286
00:18:11,361 --> 00:18:13,250
I went to a game in 1983 there,

287
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,210
the whole family went down there and
it was like taking your fucking Louise

288
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:19,580
would day game
and as you got to New York,

289
00:18:19,581 --> 00:18:23,720
there was literally cars just burned
out on the side of the fucking highway.

290
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:28,700
And I don't mean in the middle of nowhere
on some side road on the side of the

291
00:18:28,701 --> 00:18:31,460
highway,
like burn to the fucking ground.

292
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:37,570
I remember that was one of the
things when Giuliani got an office,

293
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:40,510
so it was one of the first things he
did was he got those things off of the

294
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:40,900
highway.

295
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:45,790
It was such a bad fucking look for New
York or maybe it was a good look because

296
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,450
it was warning terror,
terrorists,

297
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:52,780
tourists about what they were about
to experience. But um, I don't know.

298
00:18:52,781 --> 00:18:54,940
Everybody was getting Giuliani credit.
Who is the head,

299
00:18:54,941 --> 00:18:58,540
the chief of police there that he fired
along the way so he'd get all the credit.

300
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:01,550
Oh, Bill, do you always have
to be a con? Yeah, I do.

301
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,580
Julie.
Uh,

302
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:07,510
the fees

303
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:12,140
chief of Foley's fired.

304
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:15,410
Let's see who this guys come on.
Come on.

305
00:19:15,411 --> 00:19:19,700
Slow Internet A's bill as the
slowest Internet in Los Angeles.

306
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:21,453
Wow.

307
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:27,690
It's still fucking gone.
Um,

308
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,380
and now man, I like, I don't even know.
I don't even know like a sporting event.

309
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,270
They used to always be like an element of,
hey,

310
00:19:33,271 --> 00:19:35,520
keep your head on a fucking
swivel in Jesus Christ.

311
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,310
You have no idea where you're going
to see that people acted like fucking

312
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:41,640
animals. There was fights in the
stands and all that type of shit.

313
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:45,330
I'm not saying obviously that
I wanted to go back to that,

314
00:19:45,331 --> 00:19:49,500
but somewhere along the line like it just
became like, it's like, it's just weird.

315
00:19:49,501 --> 00:19:53,950
It's like you go into a Chucky cheese,
um,

316
00:19:53,951 --> 00:19:57,190
it's still loading by the way.
Still loading.

317
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:02,480
That's probably cause I typed in
Giuliani and something negative that,

318
00:20:02,481 --> 00:20:05,750
that's my guess. I'm going to go with
the whole conspiracy theory here.

319
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:12,120
Um, yeah. Anyways, I don't know.

320
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,630
He go to sporting events now. It's like
every time there's a stoppage of play,

321
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,760
then something happens up
on the fucking flat screen.

322
00:20:16,761 --> 00:20:18,860
Everybody just stares at it
with their mouth hanging open.

323
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,870
And I really think that
that's like this thing.

324
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:25,550
So people like don't fight
and behave themselves.

325
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:27,231
You know,
you know,

326
00:20:27,231 --> 00:20:31,160
you get that camera on your flat screen
TV and all those fucking nerds at the

327
00:20:31,161 --> 00:20:35,330
best buy sit there watching you jerking
off to the fucking Charlie's angels on

328
00:20:35,331 --> 00:20:38,780
me TV, whatever you're
doing. Right. But you know,

329
00:20:38,781 --> 00:20:41,330
in between those times when they're
waiting for you to fuck your wife or

330
00:20:41,331 --> 00:20:45,710
whatever those fucking nerd perverts I
doing down there that for some reason is

331
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:47,300
not fucking forced.

332
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,013
You know what I mean?

333
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,980
You got all this fucking
me too shit happening.

334
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:58,240
And meanwhile these fucking nerds
are watching you in your living room.

335
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:05,320
It's, I'm not making this shit up.
Like they'd gotten busted doing it.

336
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:08,050
I don't know why they admitted to it.
They were like, are you doing that?

337
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,150
They're like, oh, you know,
we're not going to say we're not.

338
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:14,120
Um,
I dunno.

339
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:20,330
Anyways. Yeah, they just sit there
fucking, I mean, if you're gonna,

340
00:21:20,331 --> 00:21:24,900
if you're gonna go after
the, the perfect. Okay.

341
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:27,690
Giuliani renews ties with police chief.
He ousted

342
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:33,440
in 1995 William Jay Brandon
left the New York City,

343
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:38,540
New York City police commissioner with
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, the two men.

344
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,830
Yeah, that's the guy.
From what I've heard,

345
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:45,440
I granted this might've been
people that hated Giuliani,

346
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,910
which God knows a lot of people do.

347
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:49,780
MMM.

348
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:52,420
This might be bullshit, but I don't
know what it was. This coming from.

349
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:59,150
This is the New York Times. All right, so
they hate Giuliani. Alright. The two men,

350
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:01,400
Rudolph Giuliani and his
former Police Commissioner,

351
00:22:01,401 --> 00:22:04,340
William j Bratton had not spoken
to each other in 10 years.

352
00:22:04,341 --> 00:22:07,440
This is from 10 years ago. This was
written when they had crossed paths,

353
00:22:07,441 --> 00:22:10,790
a social GAM. They exchanged a little
more than I see nods, but time,

354
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:13,720
tragedy and presidential campaign
has started to change all of that.

355
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:16,923
Uh,

356
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:19,910
all right.
I don't even what the fuck it is.

357
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,620
I think that was the guy
that really turned it around.

358
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:27,150
That started on the road where
it's now like, it's weird.

359
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,210
It's like,
uh,

360
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:34,860
my father in law seven came down and you
standing in Brooklyn because gee, wow,

361
00:22:34,861 --> 00:22:38,610
this is like a, it's like
a theme park. You know,

362
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:41,200
it's like people ride bicycles
along the river and all the steps.

363
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:45,240
It's sort of like a, uh, it's
sort of like if you have money,

364
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,290
it's become this utopia.

365
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,053
There's something,
I don't know.

366
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:56,070
When does the pendulum swing back?
That's what I want to know. Jesus Christ.

367
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,293
Yeah.

368
00:22:58,790 --> 00:22:59,840
Because I imagine

369
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:05,810
in the 70s when New York almost went
bankrupt, there was a bunch of old people.

370
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:09,780
When this place was,
was your dream or add,

371
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:13,480
what was that? Grandma. Okay.

372
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:18,560
Back when whites were only allowed to
play baseball back when hippo was walking

373
00:23:18,721 --> 00:23:19,554
the earth.

374
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,153
Okay.

375
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:25,720
Well, I suppose yo change
weren't right, but uh,

376
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:29,970
you're a good wave.
Your door unlocked. Um,

377
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,060
that is the thing, man.
Anytime you say good old days,

378
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:35,370
there's always some fucked
up shit going on, right?

379
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:41,110
I don't, yeah. Built, yeah. That,
that really wasn't anything deep.

380
00:23:41,111 --> 00:23:42,300
I didn't say it was.

381
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:44,580
Yeah.

382
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:47,510
All right.
So I've been doing lately a Speyside,

383
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:49,730
not boozing.

384
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:56,390
I'll tell you right now, all
fucking, uh, oh freckles here.

385
00:23:56,391 --> 00:24:01,330
I haven't drank all this month. It's
been great, man. It's really been great.

386
00:24:01,331 --> 00:24:05,070
I'm still fucking tired though, having
a kid, you still tired? But, um,

387
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:11,150
um, but like I remember one day waking
up when I was on the road anticipating a

388
00:24:11,151 --> 00:24:14,990
hangover and not having
one and I was like, wow,

389
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:20,810
that's pretty awesome. You
know, I'm trying to eat well,

390
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:24,530
thinking of talking to a nutritionist,
you know what I'm saying?

391
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:28,670
I got to get the answers to the test
here rather than listen to fucking,

392
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:31,730
it'd be Tom, Dick and Harry. You know,

393
00:24:31,731 --> 00:24:33,620
Dean del Ray knows what the
fuck he's talking about,

394
00:24:33,621 --> 00:24:36,560
but I'm getting bored with the Diet.
I got to add on this shit and uh,

395
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:41,270
want to add some vegan
meals, you know, you know,

396
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:42,530
not because I want to go Vegan,

397
00:24:42,531 --> 00:24:46,220
just because I know if you eat them
then you know, your stomach is flatter.

398
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:50,790
Just give my body a break from,
you know, the ballgame, you know,

399
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:56,420
skirt steaks and all of that shit. You
know. Um, I saw this thing the other day.

400
00:24:56,421 --> 00:24:58,820
I said, he just, you don't even
know who the fuck the belief.

401
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:00,500
Like one of the things,
you know,

402
00:25:00,501 --> 00:25:05,420
when you look at Vegetarians and you
look at Vegan people, uh, you know,

403
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:10,650
there's an astounding level of fleshy
fat people that don't eat meat,

404
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:12,560
you know what I mean?

405
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:16,130
And they'll eat French fries because
it's made from potatoes and they're a

406
00:25:16,131 --> 00:25:19,860
vegetarian, but it's fried and they'll
say, you know, potatoes on Good Friday.

407
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,490
Anyways, I far as I know,
I'm actually even say that.

408
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,730
And I don't want to be all opera here and
get people to stop eating potatoes and

409
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:30,620
then the whole fucking potato farm farming
industry sues me here at the Monday

410
00:25:30,621 --> 00:25:31,910
morning podcast.
Um,

411
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,230
yeah,

412
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:36,030
but there's just a lot,
you know, like fucking,

413
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:41,550
just all carbohydrates and shit and
they just stay away from me. Uh,

414
00:25:41,551 --> 00:25:43,530
I think a lot of people love animals,

415
00:25:43,531 --> 00:25:48,531
but they hate reading is what I've sort
of learned from looking at Vegetarians

416
00:25:49,621 --> 00:25:52,560
and Vegan people, you know,
so they don't eat meat,

417
00:25:52,561 --> 00:25:54,900
but then they don't really know
what the fuck it is they're doing.

418
00:25:55,470 --> 00:26:00,300
But the people that do take
the time to do it, right?

419
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,130
Like nobody who lived in this house
for a hundred fucking years. Evidentaly

420
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:12,500
took the time to do something.
Right. Do it. Fuck it,
friend. To face it, didn't it?

421
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,193
Okay.

422
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:17,910
Fuck it in a permit. Fuck
it. Somebody licensed.

423
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,480
Fuck all of that.
What did they do?

424
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:27,510
They just fucking lived here. They
had a problem. They asked a friend.

425
00:26:27,511 --> 00:26:29,970
And I think a lot of vegans
and vegetarians do that.

426
00:26:29,971 --> 00:26:32,430
They fucking talk to
people rather than reading.

427
00:26:32,431 --> 00:26:34,350
And that's what I do because it's easier.

428
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:39,900
It's easier than sitting down and
actually doing the fucking work. So,

429
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:44,910
you know, I see that, you
know, like can anybody,

430
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:46,800
it's Gundy your fucking head.

431
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:51,540
Can anybody tell you whether having an
egg is good for you? A bad. At this point,

432
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:57,030
eggs had been good, bad, good. And
now they're starting to be bad again.

433
00:26:57,031 --> 00:26:59,880
While people who are saying they're
good or fucking, you know that Duke,

434
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:03,480
and it is like the rubber
match, the rubber game,
whatever the fuck it's called.

435
00:27:03,481 --> 00:27:07,610
Right? Um, so I'm gonna, I'm gonna talk to
a nutritionist and I'm gonna, I'm gonna,

436
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:11,760
you know, try to read up on
it, but it's, it's really dry.

437
00:27:11,761 --> 00:27:16,761
And if you actually look up shit
on becoming a vegetarian or,

438
00:27:17,071 --> 00:27:20,860
or, or eating a little like
that, like a Vegan or something,

439
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:24,820
it's just Hatfields and McCoys McCoy.

440
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:29,980
It's between the fucking meat eaters to
carnivores and the vegetarian people.

441
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:34,780
And there's a lot of money at stake,
no pun intended. Sorry about that.

442
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:38,950
Um,
so I,

443
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:43,490
I think like the big farming cattle,
fucking people,

444
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:45,421
you know,

445
00:27:45,421 --> 00:27:50,190
they're trying to have all this shit come
up first and then all the hit the tree

446
00:27:50,191 --> 00:27:54,060
hugging like, hey man, like, you know,

447
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:56,610
trees are alive,
man.

448
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:01,090
Those fucking people are trying to
say that, you know, eating meat is,

449
00:28:01,091 --> 00:28:01,770
is like,

450
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:06,420
like I saw this thing right where they
were saying that this guy was trying to

451
00:28:06,421 --> 00:28:11,421
say that like animals get protein from
eating plants and when you eat an animal

452
00:28:13,021 --> 00:28:16,890
it's an indirect protein because she
should've just gone directly to the plant

453
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:21,990
and it's like both then explain
tigers and they're fucking,

454
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:26,670
you know, Mister Universe
physiques as far as I know,

455
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:31,050
which is, I don't know shit. So I
should shut up right now in Google.

456
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,130
What a tigers eat.

457
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:37,730
What do tigers eat?

458
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:39,990
Okay.

459
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:43,380
Meet only one of,
they're always in a bad mood.

460
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:47,250
I can't even take a shit Siberian.
The species died.

461
00:28:47,251 --> 00:28:52,140
Ordinary consists about 50% wild boar
meat. Doesn't that sound delicious?

462
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:57,030
If they cannot get their paws on some
wild boar, they've been known to eat elk,

463
00:28:58,290 --> 00:29:02,530
deer in the legs. They're like, wait,
what did we fuck with me? For me?

464
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:07,230
I didn't do nothing.
And sometimes even bears,

465
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:13,540
oh my God, what size? Jesus Christ.

466
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:20,180
That's a big thing in Asia, Huh? Putting
like a bear in a tiger in a fucking cage.

467
00:29:20,181 --> 00:29:21,110
And just filming it.

468
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:26,210
If large sources of meat
are not readily available,

469
00:29:26,211 --> 00:29:30,920
Siberian tigers will eat rabbits,
fish and any rodents they can get to.

470
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:33,483
Yeah.

471
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:36,190
Let's see.
Okay,

472
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:40,450
well there's no meat in that do to,
and that's the first thing I saw.

473
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:43,630
Do Tigers eat plants?

474
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:52,140
What do tigers eat? Siberia and the
species side consists of still this,

475
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,400
uh,
tiger's diet,

476
00:29:55,640 --> 00:30:00,640
eating tigers eat a variety of prey
ranging in size from termites to elephant

477
00:30:01,281 --> 00:30:05,750
calves. All that would break my heart to
see a baby elephant get killed. However,

478
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:08,330
an integral component of the Diet,
Laura,

479
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:12,680
are large body pray weighing
45 pounds or larger,

480
00:30:12,681 --> 00:30:16,430
such as Moose d.
What did we fucking me Moose and bear?

481
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:17,450
Where the fuck are those things?

482
00:30:17,451 --> 00:30:22,190
I thought they would feel that most
were only over here. Deer species,

483
00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:26,360
pigs, cows, horses, buffaloes and goats.

484
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:30,610
Yeah. Well they have a different
digestive system of evidently,

485
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,220
cause if you just fucking eat that,
that space,

486
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:35,430
they're basically on the
Atkins Diet, right? Yeah.

487
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:40,060
He's much fucking back in as you want
tigers looking at you like, yeah.

488
00:30:40,061 --> 00:30:44,930
I realized that. I realized
that. Um, too. Anyways,

489
00:30:44,931 --> 00:30:46,370
I'm going to try to fucking,
uh,

490
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:47,980
okay.

491
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:50,230
I Dunno,
I'm gonna talk to a nutritionist.

492
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,950
Somebody read all this shit that I'm
supposed to read and maybe try to get them

493
00:30:53,951 --> 00:30:55,270
to tell me some bow pill.

494
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:57,970
And you really going to buy books on
nutrition like you're gonna fucking read

495
00:30:57,971 --> 00:31:01,240
them today.
A lot of pictures.

496
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:07,410
Um, anyways, I should probably
read some advertising.

497
00:31:07,411 --> 00:31:09,690
I don't feel like fucking doing that.
Hey,

498
00:31:09,691 --> 00:31:12,990
I'm almost like halfway
through this season,

499
00:31:12,991 --> 00:31:17,010
six of a 77 sunset strip.

500
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:22,800
Um, and evidently see, I, as I said,
season six, you gotta watch it.

501
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:26,070
It's on a 4:00 AM on BTBY.
Just take the fucking thing.

502
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:29,790
I want to get more people to watch it
because I'm worried because I found out

503
00:31:29,791 --> 00:31:33,480
that they started broadcasting all the
episodes back in November and I missed

504
00:31:33,481 --> 00:31:37,440
the first five seasons and we're getting
towards the end here of season six

505
00:31:37,441 --> 00:31:39,360
because they didn't do a full season.

506
00:31:39,361 --> 00:31:42,750
They got canceled like three
quarters of the way through. Um,

507
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:47,470
and I'd like to see the original ones
because I'd like to see what La look back

508
00:31:47,471 --> 00:31:49,900
then. You know, hopefully
they do some exterior's,

509
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:54,310
although I know most of it was formed
on the backlot filmed on the backlog in

510
00:31:54,311 --> 00:31:58,490
Warner brothers. Um, but,

511
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:00,223
uh,

512
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:03,860
I'm loving this season so I'm worried
that the other one's going to be a little

513
00:32:03,861 --> 00:32:07,160
hokey cause I guess a lot of people
didn't like seasoned six. First of all,

514
00:32:07,161 --> 00:32:11,880
they fired the whole fucking
cast as I butchered. Sorry.

515
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:13,000
Um,

516
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,460
but I also didn't realize that they made
Efram Zimbalist juniors character a lot

517
00:32:16,461 --> 00:32:19,850
more surly and uh,
but I'm loving them.

518
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:23,240
So now I'm worried that I
saw the season six first.

519
00:32:23,241 --> 00:32:24,380
And if I go back and look at the others,

520
00:32:24,381 --> 00:32:27,920
I'm not going to like the show the same
with the other people cause I get you

521
00:32:27,921 --> 00:32:31,340
just get used to how the guy behaves,
you know. But some of the lines, man,

522
00:32:31,341 --> 00:32:35,090
some of the shit that people say on there,
here's some mix in like,

523
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:40,190
you know, women are, are, are uh, are
talking about how behave around them.

524
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:45,410
You know, like in some of the shit that
they say, it's like Jesus Christ. I mean,

525
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,310
I'm sure that guy's out there,
but what the fuck, you know,

526
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:54,050
sunset season six of
psalm 77 sunset strip.

527
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:59,420
They sounds like what some of these women
and describing is some of the shit I

528
00:32:59,421 --> 00:33:03,440
heard them say guys saying to
women on that show pipe down,

529
00:33:04,370 --> 00:33:05,203
shut up.

530
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:12,410
Not to mention after f from tries to bang
his fucking secretary tried to look up

531
00:33:14,281 --> 00:33:15,210
or dress one ups.

532
00:33:15,211 --> 00:33:19,080
I'm just sitting like this guy would get
me to and so fucking fast and have his

533
00:33:19,081 --> 00:33:20,520
full head of hair spinning.
Right.

534
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:23,880
And then my favorite one ever favorite
one ever is that mentioned on another

535
00:33:23,881 --> 00:33:27,610
podcast is when east sat down in um,

536
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:33,710
this episode with the actor that ended
up playing the professor or Gilligan's

537
00:33:34,651 --> 00:33:36,630
island. Sorry, I'm talking
through yards right now.

538
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:41,100
The accident played the professor on
Gilligan's island and the guy was three

539
00:33:41,101 --> 00:33:44,220
drinks in and,
and Av firms meeting him.

540
00:33:44,221 --> 00:33:47,790
It's the middle of the day and
the guy orders his fourth drink

541
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:53,120
and a afro goes, you've got a pretty
active available for lunchtime.

542
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:54,470
You on the sauce.

543
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:02,970
That is the one thing also
that I love about that show.

544
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:06,510
It makes you feel better about
drinking and smoking cause uh,

545
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:08,300
that from Zimbalist almost made 90.

546
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:09,653
Okay.

547
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:12,490
And there's barely a scene.

548
00:34:12,491 --> 00:34:15,340
He's not smoking a cigarette
and he's really smoking it too.

549
00:34:15,341 --> 00:34:18,970
And that's just on the tape
that they use. So who knows? I'm

550
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:24,160
all right with that. Should I read
a little bit of advertising? Yeah.

551
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:28,510
Why don't I do that 77 sunset strip.

552
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:34,320
Um, oh Jesus. Here we go. There's
somebody new mint, mobile, mobile

553

wireless stands for a lot of things.

554
00:34:41,981 --> 00:34:43,000
Big Contracts,

555
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:48,030
big bills and big fees like a t and
t's new $800 million administration fee

556
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,940
increase. Wow. They're just
making up phase now. I know.

557
00:34:54,941 --> 00:34:58,480
I love when they do that because they
think that you don't have a choice.

558
00:34:58,690 --> 00:35:03,130
What big wireless doesn't want
you to know at this. There's that.

559
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:06,790

Yeah.

564
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:18,690
Well,
let's hope they stay that way.

565
00:35:18,691 --> 00:35:21,150
Let's hope they don't put the other
guys out of the business and then they

566
00:35:21,151 --> 00:35:24,360
become the devil because that's
usually what happens. But right now,

hey, by the way, you know what, I got a,

671
00:42:18,021 --> 00:42:22,070
I got an email from a Darren king,

672
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:23,863
credible drummer.

673
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:26,020
Uh,
yeah,

674
00:42:26,490 --> 00:42:29,130
one of the best drummers I've
ever seen to be honest with you.

675
00:42:29,610 --> 00:42:32,070
And I had no idea that he
could sing and play guitar,

676
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:36,990
but he did a cover of Richie, uh, um,
I got him saber. Is it Richie havens?

677
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:42,450
Let me make sure I have
this right. Uh, fuck yeah,

678
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:44,820
let me yes,
I was correct.

679
00:42:44,821 --> 00:42:49,080
Richie havens does a song
called freedom and um,

680
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:52,530
he did a cover version of that that
then goes into something else that is

681
00:42:52,531 --> 00:42:53,710
fucking incredible.
Uh,

682
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:58,710
I tweeted out the video and we'll have
a link to it on the MM podcast. Um,

683
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:00,660
Jesus Christ.
Do you know,

684
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,710
I like watching how talented that guy is.

685
00:43:04,711 --> 00:43:08,340
I don't even know what the fuck I'm even
doing in this businessman. Incredible,

686
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:11,880
incredible monster talent. Uh,
check it out. And I already,

687
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:16,170
as a solo album coming up,
people were alluding to it.
I hope he does. If he does,

688
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:19,350
we are going to promote it here and
I hope you guys buy it because, uh,

689
00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:24,360
he is the real deal. Um, all
right, let's check out some,

690
00:43:24,970 --> 00:43:27,690
uh, am I going to read
some stories? I know.

691
00:43:27,691 --> 00:43:31,530
You know what I'm actually going to do.
I actually came across this foot.

692
00:43:31,531 --> 00:43:34,860
Could think it says news is bad for you.

693
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:37,360
Okay.

694
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:42,360
This is from something the guardian.com
says news is bad for you and giving up

695
00:43:42,731 --> 00:43:46,570
reading it will make you happier. All
right, now I'll tell you right now,

696
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:49,960
I didn't need this fucking
article to tell me this.

697
00:43:49,961 --> 00:43:54,930
I just realized that I figured it out
after I went down a rabbit hole of fucking

698
00:43:54,930 --> 00:43:55,763
,

699
00:43:57,020 --> 00:43:57,853
uh,

700
00:43:58,610 --> 00:44:00,740
you know, conspiracy theory,
you guys remember that?

701
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,460
People listen to the podcast 10 years
ago. I mean, I was fucking, I was, yeah,

702
00:44:04,490 --> 00:44:06,620
I was missed, you know,
chem trail guy, you know,

703
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:11,120
I was that guy saying you got to shut
down the Federal Reserve and I had no

704
00:44:11,121 --> 00:44:15,350
solution to do like what would what
you would do after that, you know,

705
00:44:15,351 --> 00:44:17,990
I'm sure people that are well read
on it had the solution, but I didn't.

706
00:44:17,991 --> 00:44:21,650
So I was just walking around freaking
people out. I was a cunt basically.

707
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:25,650
Um, so anyways, it says
news is bad for your health.

708
00:44:25,651 --> 00:44:26,960
So I just stopped watching the shit.

709
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:28,573
All right.

710
00:44:29,830 --> 00:44:31,030
I'm just banking on the,

711
00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:37,790
that there's going to be some smart
people with a good heart that,

712
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:42,300
that, uh, that are gonna lead us out of
this fucking mess because I don't have any

713
00:44:42,301 --> 00:44:44,760
solutions. All right. I go on stage,

714
00:44:44,790 --> 00:44:48,990
I jump around like a monkey and I
make you laugh. Okay. That's my lane.

715
00:44:50,070 --> 00:44:53,400
And it's a rock used to say no.
Your role in shut your mouth.

716
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:57,480
So I'm staying over there. I
tried to watch the news. I try,

717
00:44:58,020 --> 00:44:59,190
I can't,
you know,

718
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:04,140
it's the weirdest thing going from Obama
to Trump going from Obama where all

719
00:45:04,141 --> 00:45:08,910
they did was lick his balls for eight
years and then they go to Trump and it's

720
00:45:08,911 --> 00:45:11,340
just like, all they do is shit on
the guy in the entire fucking time.

721
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,750
And they're both kind of doing,
you know what? The foreign policy,

722
00:45:15,810 --> 00:45:19,440
the same fucking shit, although I
don't, Trump is like a fucking lunatic.

723
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:24,660
You know what I mean?
I, you know, I heard,

724
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:28,620
I was on the Howard stern show and he
went on this fucking rant about Russia.

725
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:33,630
It was just not talking about the fucking
people just talking about, you know, uh,

726
00:45:34,050 --> 00:45:36,990
of laddy daddy over there.
He goes,

727
00:45:36,991 --> 00:45:40,540
I'm sick of people fucking talking
about Russia. You know, like, like they,

728
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:43,980
they're not that bad. He's like, did they
fucking, you know, they kill gay people.

729
00:45:44,850 --> 00:45:48,310
They kill reporters just for having
a difference of opinion in the,

730
00:45:49,110 --> 00:45:53,940
and he's right. He's fucking right. Um,

731
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:58,920
I dunno, I once that his, his,

732
00:45:58,921 --> 00:46:03,350
his fucking wife wore that coat when he
was going to go visit those kids, that,

733
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:07,170
that she was going to go visit those
kids that they had stuck in cages and she

734
00:46:07,171 --> 00:46:10,350
wore a jacket that said, I don't
really care to you and then try it. Oh.

735
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,690
Then had to do with fake news.
It's just like,

736
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:17,160
it's literally like listening to a
toddler that ally and I, God bless you,

737
00:46:18,390 --> 00:46:22,110
if you can still watch that and try
and stay politically active because,

738
00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:27,150
I don't know, it's just too fucking
depressing. I can't fucking deal with it.

739
00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:30,600
So I choose not to watch.

740
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:35,410
And the last presidency, you
know, I just, I just, it was, I,

741
00:46:35,411 --> 00:46:38,820
I couldn't fucking,
you know,

742
00:46:38,850 --> 00:46:42,840
I had hope and then I was just like, oh,
this is going to be more of the saying,

743
00:46:42,870 --> 00:46:45,270
oh, bankers don't go to
jail. Oh yeah. If, yeah.

744
00:46:45,271 --> 00:46:48,330
Insurance companies could do whatever
they, whatever they fucking want. And uh,

745
00:46:48,690 --> 00:46:48,931
yeah.

746
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:52,230
We're not going to
constructively criticize our
foreign policy and we're just

747
00:46:52,231 --> 00:46:55,250
going to stay the fucking course and
shut down the government every fucking

748
00:46:55,290 --> 00:46:58,230
August for a week. And our solution
is always going to be the say, well,

749
00:46:58,231 --> 00:47:02,520
what if we raise the
debt? Right? You know?

750
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:03,450
And then meanwhile,

751
00:47:03,450 --> 00:47:06,710
everything that his wife did was just
considered like angelic. And it's just,

752
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:08,100
it was the whole fucking
thing was annoying.

753
00:47:10,110 --> 00:47:13,620
That was like when he was in office
was like watching a fucking award show.

754
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:16,530
Everybody's just walking around,
blowing each other,

755
00:47:16,531 --> 00:47:19,920
talking about how fucking
brilliant they are. And then this,

756
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:23,220
we went from an awards show
to a fucking train wreck.

757
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:28,050
I honestly don't know how people
have the stomach to pay attention.

758
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:32,440
Like you're, you're a whole other level
tough mentally than I am. So anyways,

759
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:35,140
here's, here's this whole
fucking article here says,

760
00:47:35,141 --> 00:47:38,050
news is bad for you and giving up
reading it will make you happier.

761
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:40,630
All in the past few decades,

762
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:45,670
the fortune fortunate among us have
recognized the hazards of living with an

763
00:47:45,671 --> 00:47:49,420
over abundance of food,
parentheses, obesity, and diabetes.

764
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:52,510
And having started to change and
have started to change your dies,

765
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:57,430
but most of us do not yet understand
that news is to the mind what sugar is to

766
00:47:57,431 --> 00:48:00,520
the body.
News is easy to digest.

767
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:04,420
The media feeds a small bites of
trivial matter tidbits that don't really

768
00:48:04,421 --> 00:48:06,700
concern our lives and
don't require thinking.

769
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:09,550
That's why we experience
almost no saturation.

770
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:13,060
Unlike reading a book or a long magazine,
articles which require thinking,

771
00:48:13,210 --> 00:48:16,330
we can swallow limitless
quantities of news flashes,

772
00:48:16,510 --> 00:48:20,140
which are bright colored
candies for the mind. Today,

773
00:48:20,141 --> 00:48:25,030
we have reached the same point in relation
to the information that we faced 20

774
00:48:25,031 --> 00:48:26,980
years ago in regard to food.

775
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:30,310
We're beginning to recognize
how toxic news can be.

776
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:35,580
I agree with all of this, but everybody
can't stop paying attention or else,

777
00:48:35,581 --> 00:48:39,290
you know, somebody has to pay attention,
right? Somebody's gotta be like, you need,

778
00:48:39,350 --> 00:48:40,650
you can't put it on cruise control.

779
00:48:40,910 --> 00:48:42,420
So I don't know if I hundred
percent agree with this,

780
00:48:42,421 --> 00:48:45,450
I just know I'm not going to be the
Gandy that leads us out of this.

781
00:48:48,530 --> 00:48:50,210
You don't?
So as long as I know that.

782
00:48:51,250 --> 00:48:51,900
Yeah,

783
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:53,700
I mean I will,
abuse can be content.

784
00:48:55,210 --> 00:48:58,380
The listen to Howard in the morning and
then I listened to fucking baseball at

785
00:48:58,381 --> 00:49:01,860
night.
That's what the fuck I do.

786
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:06,990
I don't pretend to know things. All
right. News misleads all my God. What?

787
00:49:07,830 --> 00:49:12,300
Take the falling event. A car drives
over a bridge and the bridge collapses.

788
00:49:12,690 --> 00:49:15,360
What does,
what does a news media focus on the car,

789
00:49:15,450 --> 00:49:18,720
the person in the car where he came from,
where you plan to go,

790
00:49:18,870 --> 00:49:21,270
how he was he transitioning?
How did, he didn't say that.

791
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:24,420
How we experienced the crash
parentheses if he survived.

792
00:49:24,450 --> 00:49:27,360
But that is all irrelevant.
What's relevant?

793
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:29,760
The structural stability of the bridge.

794
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:33,630
That's the underlying risks that has
been Larkey and could lurk and other

795
00:49:33,631 --> 00:49:34,110
bridges.

796
00:49:34,110 --> 00:49:39,110
All they get to that after
they go painstakingly
through the horror of the end

797
00:49:40,531 --> 00:49:44,910
of that man's life or life
altering injuries and then
they get to his family and

798
00:49:44,911 --> 00:49:48,960
they're all crying and all
of that shit. Um, you know,

799
00:49:48,961 --> 00:49:53,550
as much as a moron, as as I am, I
always turn that shit off. You know,

800
00:49:53,551 --> 00:49:58,430
like out here, we had a hostage
situation. At a trader Joe's and um,

801
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:01,590
the people I was with were just watching
it and watching, watching. It's like,

802
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:03,420
like just out of curiosity,

803
00:50:03,450 --> 00:50:06,840
what are you going to do with this guy
just runs out in such shooting people in

804
00:50:06,841 --> 00:50:08,610
the fucking head. Like,
you want to watch this?

805
00:50:09,570 --> 00:50:11,520
These people in the store
are fucking terrified.

806
00:50:11,521 --> 00:50:14,880
This is the worst fucking
moment of their life. All right?

807
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:19,380
The news eventually is going to tell you
what happened and they're going to give

808
00:50:19,381 --> 00:50:22,830
you an edited version so you don't have
to see people's brains getting blown out,

809
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:26,550
you know, and why, you know, they live,

810
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:29,240
he had like the were crying and all
that shit. And then I found on the end,

811
00:50:29,241 --> 00:50:33,560
you know, some poor woman died was,
it was fucking terrible. The one,

812
00:50:33,570 --> 00:50:38,300
I'm just going to sit at home
watching it for hours, ordering food,

813
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:43,550
you know, going online. Are they
tweeting from there or what's going on?

814
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:46,040
Then all these fucking
assholes on Youtube,

815
00:50:46,330 --> 00:50:50,360
not youtube on Twitter or these social
media if are going to go on and say the

816
00:50:50,361 --> 00:50:53,870
obvious, oh my God, this is so bad.

817
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:57,920
I'm like freaking out right now. I love
that. Oh, is that what you're doing?

818
00:50:57,921 --> 00:50:59,870
Are you freaking out of the safety,
your own home?

819
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:03,900
Why don't you make this about yourself?
Your Fuck God. Jesus. Social Media,

820
00:51:03,901 --> 00:51:06,650
I bet is people's, a lot of shit
that says that's depressing too.

821
00:51:07,610 --> 00:51:11,210
But you know what?
Podcasts actually feed the soul.

822
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:17,060
I believe I'm part of the problem.
News misleads bill Burmis leads.

823
00:51:18,350 --> 00:51:19,790
Uh, anyways, plowing ahead.

824
00:51:19,791 --> 00:51:23,870
We are not rational enough to be exposed
to the press and see this guy same.

825
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:24,590
We're all dumb.

826
00:51:24,590 --> 00:51:28,430
Watching an airplane crash on television
is going to change your attitude toward

827
00:51:28,431 --> 00:51:31,460
that risk regardless of
its real probability.

828
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:34,760
If you think you can compensate with
the strength of your own inner con

829
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:37,190
contemplation,
you are wrong.

830
00:51:38,510 --> 00:51:42,770
I think the subtext of this is you dumb
fuck bankers in economists who have

831
00:51:42,771 --> 00:51:47,771
powerful incentives to compensate for
news born hazards have shown that they can

832
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:53,960
not the only solution cut yourself off
from the news consumption entirely.

833
00:51:54,230 --> 00:51:59,230
News is irrelevant of the approximately
10,000 news stories you have read in the

834
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:00,200
last 12 months.

835
00:52:00,201 --> 00:52:04,790
Name one that because you consumed it
allowed you to make a better decision

836
00:52:04,791 --> 00:52:08,780
about the serious matter affecting your
life, your career and your business. Well,

837
00:52:08,781 --> 00:52:10,550
I would say anything
about the environment.

838
00:52:12,830 --> 00:52:16,550
You know Jesus gas guys
chip off the old block here.

839
00:52:16,850 --> 00:52:18,320
Paint with a broad brush.

840
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:22,700
The point is the consumption
of news is irrelevant to you,

841
00:52:22,701 --> 00:52:25,730
but people find it very difficult
to recognize what's relevant.

842
00:52:26,030 --> 00:52:28,940
It's much easier to recognize what's new.
All right.

843
00:52:28,941 --> 00:52:29,900
I think we get the point here.

844
00:52:29,930 --> 00:52:34,930
News has no explanatory power news items
or bubbles popping on the surface of a

845
00:52:35,751 --> 00:52:37,700
deeper world who that's deep.

846
00:52:38,570 --> 00:52:42,320
That's something got fucking progressive
rock band like a line in the song.

847
00:52:44,390 --> 00:52:49,280
Um, in 74 I imagine will accumulate
facts that help you understand the world.

848
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:54,560
Sadly no, the relationship is inverted.
The important stories are non stories.

849
00:52:55,250 --> 00:52:56,690
I would agree with that slow,

850
00:52:56,691 --> 00:53:01,400
powerful movement that develop a load
journalists radar but have a transforming

851
00:53:01,401 --> 00:53:04,460
effect.
The more news factoids you digest,

852
00:53:04,461 --> 00:53:06,470
the less of the big picture
you will understand.

853
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:09,410
Maybe this way everybody's showing
each other news is toxic to your body.

854
00:53:09,410 --> 00:53:12,800
This is, I'll just read the headlines
here. News increases cognitive errors.

855
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:15,770
News inhibits thinking.
News works like a drug.

856
00:53:16,310 --> 00:53:20,060
News waste time and news makes us
passive. Well, that worked with me.

857
00:53:20,061 --> 00:53:24,560
News kills creativity. Uh, well
there you go. Jesus Christ.

858
00:53:24,561 --> 00:53:27,750
That's pretty negative, Huh?
Let's get to some positive shit.

859
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:33,540
I gotta I gotta fucking note from
a possible visit to dove, Ron,

860
00:53:34,890 --> 00:53:39,360
Vic Bravo Rove. Nick though,
Bro, Croatia, my friend.

861
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:45,450
Uh, while you're checking where the
hell I'm contacting you from, uh,

862
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:50,550
let me jump you with invitation.
Invitation to my country. Slash. City.

863
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:55,620
I run brewery and we are in debt at the
moment. So don't expect this is money.

864
00:53:55,621 --> 00:53:56,970
Interesting invitation.

865
00:53:57,330 --> 00:54:01,920
This is opportunity for you to check
out crazy side of Buckland's and getting

866
00:54:01,950 --> 00:54:06,480
hours and hours of future material.
By the way, you're funny. Well,

867
00:54:06,481 --> 00:54:07,980
thank you sir.
Uh,

868
00:54:07,981 --> 00:54:12,720
that read like a fucking ransom note from
eastern Europe and I would be lying to

869
00:54:12,721 --> 00:54:15,060
you if I wasn't a little
afraid to go to your bar.

870
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:20,210
I need a couple of those in there. You
know, while you're checking where, oh,

871
00:54:20,310 --> 00:54:21,450
he got the hell.

872
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:26,480
I'm contacting you from letting me jump
in with an invitation that be jumping

873
00:54:27,121 --> 00:54:31,320
with invitation. Uh, you, you
fucking talk like Ivan Drago.

874
00:54:32,610 --> 00:54:33,810
Um,
listen buddy,

875
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:37,470
I'm going to try to get as close to
done Bruv nick as I possibly can.

876
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:41,670
I wish you bar was making more money.
Uh,

877
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:44,850
and I'd love to go in there and help
you out with your fucking monthly rent.

878
00:54:44,851 --> 00:54:46,950
Buy Booze and my face off.
But I don't,

879
00:54:47,130 --> 00:54:51,490
I can tell you I don't think I'm gonna
make it there. Uh, eastern European tour.

880
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:53,400
Jesus Christ.
If this is all I'm getting,

881
00:54:54,210 --> 00:54:58,440
this is all east eastern Europe
where Eastern European tour,

882
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:02,010
dear Billy Bald Burger. Oh, come on now.

883
00:55:02,110 --> 00:55:05,670
That was feeling I was
feeling good about myself. Uh,

884
00:55:05,671 --> 00:55:09,540
I'm a huge fan of your comedy and F is
for family is my favorite thing on next

885
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:11,220
flicks. Well, thank you
very much. Therefore,

886
00:55:11,221 --> 00:55:14,250
I am very excited that you were
thinking of visiting Prague,

887
00:55:14,490 --> 00:55:19,290
Czech Republic comedy scene in Prague
is pretty much nonexistent. Oh,

888
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:24,240
Gigi. So I'm sure you would kill
with your knock, knock jokes. Um,

889
00:55:24,270 --> 00:55:29,160
if you are interested, pint of beer cost
between one to $2 and it's delicious.

890
00:55:29,550 --> 00:55:32,250
You also have to try
traditional alcohol drink

891
00:55:34,170 --> 00:55:39,170
slip Bovis it's made from distilled
plums and has about 51% of alcohol.

892
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:42,690
Okay,
I'm in.

893
00:55:42,750 --> 00:55:47,580
You can visit the Czech hockey hall of
fame or you could go to cr mayor or play

894
00:55:47,590 --> 00:55:50,920
some second division hockey.
Oh, that would be cool as shit.

895
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:52,680
I'm probably only gonna
be there for a night.

896
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:57,150
I think this is going to be a a bunch
of one nighters here. A while back,

897
00:55:57,151 --> 00:56:01,680
you mentioned you saw the movie
anthropoid about a checklist of Akian

898
00:56:01,710 --> 00:56:06,510
paratroopers assassinating high ranking
German Nazi official. I loved that movie.

899
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:08,790
The movie ends with the
final shootout in the church.

900
00:56:08,791 --> 00:56:11,730
You can actually go to the crips of the
church and see the bullet holes from the

901
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:14,070
injury incident.
I'm fucking doing that.

902
00:56:15,490 --> 00:56:20,070
I hope you decide to come and share
your Moroccan wisdom with us savages.

903
00:56:20,310 --> 00:56:23,620
Thanks. And Go make love to your
lovely wife. Oh, thank you. Bless you.

904
00:56:24,310 --> 00:56:28,380
Go Fuck your wife. You fucking ready
it. Prick Eastern European. Tori.

905
00:56:28,390 --> 00:56:29,560
Hey Bill.

906
00:56:31,030 --> 00:56:34,990
I've just wanted to say that I know a
lot of people waiting for you to come to

907
00:56:34,991 --> 00:56:36,010
Poland.
Oh Great.

908
00:56:36,070 --> 00:56:39,460
I guess your agents already figured out
that Warsaw's seems the most logical

909
00:56:39,461 --> 00:56:42,540
place to do your show as it's
the biggest city in the capitol.

910
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:44,290
It's located somewhat in
the middle of the country,

911
00:56:44,291 --> 00:56:46,540
so most of the people from outside boards,
so like me,

912
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:48,280
will be able to come and see you live.

913
00:56:48,610 --> 00:56:50,980
I'm 100% sure you'll sell
out all of the tickets.

914
00:56:50,981 --> 00:56:54,610
Plus Warsaw is a great place to visit
because of its history and of course all

915
00:56:54,611 --> 00:56:55,960
the cool stuff going on there.

916
00:56:56,140 --> 00:57:00,070
I guess people from the states think
you'll see white bears and trams and horse

917
00:57:00,071 --> 00:57:03,580
drawn carts in the street, but that's
not the case. I didn't think that.

918
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:08,980
I just thought I'd see four people
trying to screw in a light bulb. Sorry.

919
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:13,780
Just like everywhere else. We've got
hipsters in Starbucks, moderately fat,

920
00:57:13,781 --> 00:57:17,530
lazy fucks in shopping malls and generally
people wasting their lives on social

921
00:57:17,531 --> 00:57:21,010
media. Yeah, yeah. That's, that's
a reoccurring thing. Anyway,

922
00:57:21,190 --> 00:57:23,860
my friends and I can't wait for your
show. Thanks and go fuck yourself. Yeah.

923
00:57:24,270 --> 00:57:26,890
Everybody's staring at their phones is
a big thing and I do that all the time.

924
00:57:29,020 --> 00:57:31,360
Uh, persistent colds. You
may have walking pneumonia,

925
00:57:31,361 --> 00:57:34,860
go see a doctor when you get
back to la. I need a doctor. Some

926
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:42,220
soft tires and Nazi symbolism. I
love this guy. This guy's just,

927
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:47,620
he's just doing the whole gamut,
isn't he? Um, running the gamut. Hey,

928
00:57:47,621 --> 00:57:50,140
let's look that up.
Let's see what the fuck that means.

929
00:57:50,350 --> 00:57:54,010
How does that expression come about?
All right.

930
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:58,120
Run the gamut.
Origin meaning the entire range.

931
00:57:58,121 --> 00:58:03,121
The word Gamet traces its origins to the
Middle Ages in a system for designating

932
00:58:04,451 --> 00:58:07,510
musical notes around the turn
of the second millennium.

933
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:12,060
But fuck you mean the second millennium?

934
00:58:12,061 --> 00:58:15,630
I thought this was the second
millennium. 2000, right?

935
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:21,420
Isn't a millennium a thousand years.
I'm an evil monk. Developed a system.

936
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:26,700
Jesus fill I, you know,
just gets to the point like,

937
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:31,540
I try to be informed.
Thank you.

938
00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:35,920
The second you going to bring up a
fucking monk around the turn of the second

939
00:58:35,921 --> 00:58:39,840
millennium, Guido of our, our Xo.

940
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:41,380
A medieval monk.

941
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:43,050
Yeah.

942
00:58:43,050 --> 00:58:46,020
Developed a system of Psalm Ization.

943
00:58:46,050 --> 00:58:49,860
I designating musical
notes by syllable names.

944
00:58:49,861 --> 00:58:54,000
While today we are familiar with
the Sung syllables do re Mi fa.

945
00:58:54,001 --> 00:58:58,770
So La ti back in Guido's time,
he died in 10 50.

946
00:58:59,190 --> 00:59:04,190
They had a hex tonic scales six note
and he used the symbol earth re me fa,

947
00:59:05,791 --> 00:59:08,010
Sol and La

948
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:14,540
and the represented the lowest note.
Oh,

949
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:19,810
it's be far. So at La and uh, I can't,

950
00:59:19,811 --> 00:59:23,000
I can't, that's why I
drums and tell jokes. Uh,

951
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:28,370
ut what represents the lowest tone
recognized in music theory at that time.

952
00:59:28,550 --> 00:59:33,530
The second g below middle c. What the
fuck? I don't give a fuck about Wayne.

953
00:59:33,740 --> 00:59:38,010
So what is the gamut?
The range of notes. Okay.

954
00:59:38,011 --> 00:59:42,540
Building on this denotation
detonation, I dunno.

955
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:47,160
Gamut eventually came to mean
the whole musical scale. Oh,

956
00:59:47,161 --> 00:59:51,580
so you're running the whole fucking
scale. Okay. Jesus Christ. Alright.

957
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:55,960
Hey Belton soft tires and Nazi
symbolism by the way. Hey Bill,

958
00:59:55,961 --> 00:59:58,990
I think I can answer both of your
questions from Thursdays podcast.

959
00:59:59,020 --> 01:00:03,280
I'm in law school and a motor
sport fanatic. So the questions,

960
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:08,700
these questions are right
in my wheelhouse. All right.

961
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,720
[inaudible] you were in law school.
What, so you know about Nazi symbolism?

962
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:15,320
Do you prosecute hate crimes?
I hope a number one.

963
01:00:15,321 --> 01:00:20,070
Why the soft tires in Moto
GP? Uh, principally you,

964
01:00:20,071 --> 01:00:23,690
you're right. I know the tires to
grade towards the end of the race.

965
01:00:23,691 --> 01:00:27,140
So it makes sense to use harder
ones to get consistent performance.

966
01:00:27,141 --> 01:00:29,870
Especially now that's slightly sliding.

967
01:00:29,871 --> 01:00:32,360
The bike is the quickest
way around the track.

968
01:00:32,361 --> 01:00:36,840
How the fuck you learn how
to do that is crazy. I mean,

969
01:00:36,841 --> 01:00:40,710
I've seen people do that in cars,
you know, drifting. But you know,

970
01:00:40,711 --> 01:00:43,440
you're on four wheels.
Like the level of balancing scale though,

971
01:00:43,770 --> 01:00:48,270
be ability become one with the Macheda
judge on their all with a work of art and

972
01:00:48,271 --> 01:00:52,770
Germany. Lorenzo used a soft front
tire while Marcus took the hard one.

973
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:57,960
Uh, for the rears. Lorenzo was on a
medium tire in Marquez on the soft.

974
01:00:58,830 --> 01:01:02,520
Marcus is a special driver and tends to
get a better feeling for the bike with

975
01:01:02,521 --> 01:01:05,160
the hard tire. Um, the sidewalls,

976
01:01:05,460 --> 01:01:07,680
some simply don't wobble around too much.

977
01:01:07,950 --> 01:01:11,880
Lorenzo's bet was to use the
superior pace of the soft tire,

978
01:01:11,910 --> 01:01:15,510
more grip to build enough of an
advantage to win. This is fascinating.

979
01:01:16,060 --> 01:01:20,520
Mark has meanwhile expected a tight
field and wanted to nurses tires while

980
01:01:20,521 --> 01:01:22,020
keeping with the pack.

981
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:26,160
Thus having enough tire left for the
last lab and a final attack for a wind,

982
01:01:26,161 --> 01:01:27,600
which is exactly what he did.

983
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:31,920
Simply put the drivers have to decide
between an early pace advantage and

984
01:01:31,921 --> 01:01:36,550
therefore superior track position was soft
tires and the consistency of the hards

985
01:01:38,110 --> 01:01:41,730
add, add changing conditions, different
writing styles and bikes to that.

986
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:46,230
And you'll see how hard it is to
pick up a winning package. Well,

987
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:49,970
my thing is,

988
01:01:50,030 --> 01:01:52,850
is there a way for him to know what
Mark Marcus is going to be running

989
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:55,790
considering he's the best writer
out there as far as I can tell,

990
01:01:56,060 --> 01:01:59,950
no disrespect to Jorge Lorenzo. I know
he's one of the couple of times, but um,

991
01:02:00,020 --> 01:02:03,350
the championship, I believe
he's won two of them. Um,

992
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:07,790
no matter what tire you're going to have,
you're not going to open up this

993
01:02:08,670 --> 01:02:09,503
like

994
01:02:10,610 --> 01:02:11,810
insurmountable lead.

995
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:16,170
So I just think eventually that soft
tire is going to fucking wear out.

996
01:02:16,171 --> 01:02:17,280
And then mark has his behind.

997
01:02:17,281 --> 01:02:20,730
He's going to overtake you and then he
then can ride hard for the first time in

998
01:02:20,731 --> 01:02:24,420
the race.
It beat the shit out of those tires.

999
01:02:24,421 --> 01:02:27,690
But by the time they get fucked up in
the race is going to be over before that

1000
01:02:27,691 --> 01:02:32,040
happens. I don't know. But
thanks for that. That is,

1001
01:02:32,070 --> 01:02:34,620
that is fastened.
Cause everybody says you watch Reishi,

1002
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:37,860
she's blind people driving around,
driving around track,

1003
01:02:37,890 --> 01:02:41,310
driving around in circle stock, car
racing. You're like, do you need to know?

1004
01:02:41,311 --> 01:02:45,270
Go turn left. Um, yeah,
that's all he needs to know.

1005
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:50,250
Band Nazi symbolism. Um, I'm
enrolled in one of the best school.

1006
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:53,250
I love how people are too
dumb to understand racing
and then they sit there and

1007
01:02:53,251 --> 01:02:55,140
they shit on it.
Uh,

1008
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:59,700
I'm enrolled in one of the
best law schools in Germany
over here displaying Nazi

1009
01:02:59,701 --> 01:03:04,680
symbolism is punishable with up to five
years in prison in the context of the

1010
01:03:04,681 --> 01:03:09,330
whole legal system. It's quite an
unusual article of the law usually.

1011
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:11,670
This is amazing. So you, cause
you're a lawyer in Germany,

1012
01:03:11,970 --> 01:03:16,970
usually the political background of an
opinion is irrelevant to the criminal

1013
01:03:17,220 --> 01:03:19,410
repercussions to avoid discrimination.

1014
01:03:19,411 --> 01:03:23,520
Usually objective factors are
used instead of political ones.

1015
01:03:23,820 --> 01:03:27,990
It was discussed whether it banning and
punishing Nazi sympathetics displays is

1016
01:03:27,991 --> 01:03:32,850
constitutional. It is an infringement
on the freedom of speech. Yes, it is.

1017
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:37,370
Um, and also let you know
who the Nazis, ah, uh,

1018
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:39,760
the one argument that
won in court was this,

1019
01:03:39,950 --> 01:03:44,310
this was the historic significance in
Germany. Uh, the constitution with,

1020
01:03:44,311 --> 01:03:47,250
by the way, I'm loving all these,
these letters from around the world.

1021
01:03:47,251 --> 01:03:50,070
This is fucking incredible. If I
could just get some women to write it.

1022
01:03:51,210 --> 01:03:53,100
I know I'm off putting ladies.
But you know,

1023
01:03:53,130 --> 01:03:55,770
that kind of gives you an
opportunity to put me in my place,

1024
01:03:55,771 --> 01:03:57,930
which is one of my favorite things.
You hear when my wife's on here,

1025
01:03:57,931 --> 01:04:01,650
she shits all over me. I love
it. Giggling like a schoolgirl.

1026
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:06,800
The constitution was put into place in
1949 while most cities still look like

1027
01:04:07,710 --> 01:04:09,090
downtown Baghdad,

1028
01:04:09,450 --> 01:04:14,450
circa 2004 a and when the ovens
of Auswitch had just cooled down,

1029
01:04:14,521 --> 01:04:15,870
Jesus,
uh,

1030
01:04:15,871 --> 01:04:20,871
the content of the con constitution is
an answer to all this shit that went down

1031
01:04:21,031 --> 01:04:25,440
between 1933 and 1945.
Yeah.

1032
01:04:26,820 --> 01:04:29,850
Because most of those lunatics
died or were put to death.

1033
01:04:30,750 --> 01:04:33,630
And then some more rational
people were like, hey, yeah,

1034
01:04:34,530 --> 01:04:37,330
let's try to prevent that happen.
And again, I look at the city. Yeah.

1035
01:04:37,331 --> 01:04:38,010
This is amazing.

1036
01:04:38,010 --> 01:04:41,920
You can see all the way to the other
city because there's no cities left. Um,

1037
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:48,510
anyways. Um, so the constitution
is the answer to, that's really,

1038
01:04:48,511 --> 01:04:53,511
I know you don't see a lot about Germany
other than 1933 to 1945 or the show

1039
01:04:55,381 --> 01:04:57,360
shit about, you know, World War One,

1040
01:04:58,890 --> 01:05:03,870
but they don't show about the steps
that they took afterwards to ensure that

1041
01:05:03,871 --> 01:05:06,630
this wasn't going to happen again.
Uh,

1042
01:05:06,631 --> 01:05:09,480
I'm sure there's a nice book on it that
I could sit down and read if I wasn't

1043
01:05:09,481 --> 01:05:10,314
such a moron.

1044
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:13,980
And he was denying support of that
regime is part of the constitution is

1045
01:05:13,981 --> 01:05:18,460
inherent character. I agree with that.
The problem, it doesn't change anything.

1046
01:05:18,490 --> 01:05:22,780
It's symbolism. We can now point at
our laws and tell other countries,

1047
01:05:22,781 --> 01:05:26,530
see we learned and what
do the neonazis do?

1048
01:05:26,740 --> 01:05:29,890
They use fucking code,
which is not forbidden,

1049
01:05:30,250 --> 01:05:33,130
such as 88,

1050
01:05:33,370 --> 01:05:37,780
I guess that means Heil Hitler or
Hkn K R Z shirts,

1051
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:42,960
which in German is recognize is saying
Hakan Kreutz which equals swastika.

1052
01:05:45,430 --> 01:05:46,330
I swear to God,

1053
01:05:46,331 --> 01:05:51,331
those fuckers parody the run DMC
logo with HKN space R Z shirts.

1054
01:05:53,681 --> 01:05:57,130
I had no idea.
Wow,

1055
01:05:57,790 --> 01:06:01,000
thanks for the podcast.
They keep me laughing during exams.

1056
01:06:01,001 --> 01:06:04,660
Looking forward to your German European
tour, you freckle con, you know,

1057
01:06:04,661 --> 01:06:08,260
that's gotta be the most fascinating
Shit I've heard about Germany since,

1058
01:06:08,261 --> 01:06:12,790
you know, the same shit that
they show a zillion times on,

1059
01:06:13,510 --> 01:06:16,890
um, on the history channel. Me obviously
you got to show that. So, you know,

1060
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:20,080
hopefully that never happens again.
Um,

1061
01:06:20,770 --> 01:06:24,220
but they should probably shine a light
on this to know that that is going down.

1062
01:06:26,020 --> 01:06:28,690
I Dunno. It's hard, man. I, I
believe looked like the Nazis.

1063
01:06:28,950 --> 01:06:32,170
They kind of like a fucking
think I used to do a bit on this.

1064
01:06:32,171 --> 01:06:36,340
They're kind of like a band that had a
bunch of hits like fucking 40 years ago

1065
01:06:36,850 --> 01:06:40,900
and now they're coming back and it's just,
you know, there's no original members.

1066
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:45,400
They don't have the magic. Any wishes it's
over. It's over. It's, it's uh, you know,

1067
01:06:46,510 --> 01:06:48,220
it's like, uh, you know, some,

1068
01:06:48,221 --> 01:06:52,690
some bands it's just their name
becomes toxic after awhile,

1069
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:54,993
you know.

1070
01:06:55,270 --> 01:06:58,660
Although sometimes they're so bad that
they come back and people love him again.

1071
01:07:00,060 --> 01:07:01,500
I don't know,
it's probably a bad analogy,

1072
01:07:01,860 --> 01:07:04,080
but that's pretty frightening
that that shit's going down,

1073
01:07:04,650 --> 01:07:09,130
that people still like,
you know,

1074
01:07:11,970 --> 01:07:15,360
I dunno, I've never really been
to a Holocaust museum. It's just,

1075
01:07:15,380 --> 01:07:18,060
I just don't think I could handle it.
You know,

1076
01:07:18,061 --> 01:07:22,530
knowing that people are capable
of that level of fucking evil.

1077
01:07:22,650 --> 01:07:25,260
Just literally separating,
you know,

1078
01:07:25,370 --> 01:07:30,030
it's Shit and slavery the Shit at the
board to separate parents from their

1079
01:07:30,031 --> 01:07:34,840
children to sit there and fucking do that.
I don't,

1080
01:07:34,850 --> 01:07:38,890
I don't give anybody a pass.
Even the fucking kid down
there like, this is my job.

1081
01:07:39,010 --> 01:07:43,540
Quit your fucking job.
I'm not fucking doing this.

1082
01:07:45,130 --> 01:07:47,120
Like, when do you, when
is that Kid's screaming,

1083
01:07:47,180 --> 01:07:51,440
crying voice gonna leave your fucking
head for the rest of your life. Oh my God.

1084
01:07:51,560 --> 01:07:54,170
Especially now having a kid and
no one like how much they need.

1085
01:07:54,171 --> 01:07:56,540
Like my daughter just came in,
she was like whining and all that.

1086
01:07:57,110 --> 01:08:01,070
For whatever reasons she wanted to
hug me, you know? I don't know why,

1087
01:08:01,071 --> 01:08:05,240
but they need just to take that away
from a kid at just, it's fucking,

1088
01:08:06,860 --> 01:08:10,130
you know, over some, I don't
know that this guy, you know,

1089
01:08:10,131 --> 01:08:14,420
there's gotta be another
way. Right. Anyways, uh,

1090
01:08:14,421 --> 01:08:18,830
you sent my to the hospital.
The fuck are you talking about?

1091
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:24,290
Can I legally read this
without getting all right? Hey,

1092
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:28,460
Billy broke killer. My brother and
I went to your show early years,

1093
01:08:28,470 --> 01:08:32,630
your early show in Minneapolis a couple
of weeks ago. And as we were leaving,

1094
01:08:32,631 --> 01:08:36,770
he was complaining about his back and
shoulder hurting being the Douche. I am.

1095
01:08:36,771 --> 01:08:39,410
I assumed he was whining
about the uncomfortable seats.

1096
01:08:39,411 --> 01:08:43,160
So the next few days he started coughing
and hearing a rattle in his chest. Yeah.

1097
01:08:43,161 --> 01:08:46,220
Okay. We'll go to the doctor. He went
to the doc and as we were cautioned,

1098
01:08:46,250 --> 01:08:47,900
it turns out at some
point during your set,

1099
01:08:48,140 --> 01:08:53,140
his right lung made like the
Falcons and Superbowl 51 collapsed.

1100
01:08:56,530 --> 01:08:59,890
Well, if that's not from laughing, that
was like, you know, you went there. Yeah.

1101
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:04,440
This is probably everything he
did up until that point. Um,

1102
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:05,051
he spent,

1103
01:09:05,051 --> 01:09:08,370
I would love to take credit for any
joke being funny enough to make somebody

1104
01:09:08,380 --> 01:09:12,940
lung collapse, but I think
you're, uh, thank you. Uh,

1105
01:09:12,970 --> 01:09:15,520
yeah. You're looking at the asset
of the problem there, buddy.

1106
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:20,470
He spent the next six days in the hospital
and had to get a tube stuck through

1107
01:09:20,471 --> 01:09:24,970
his rib cage, like Carl weathers,
destinies, death scene in Predator.

1108
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:30,240
Then they hope that shit up
to a dustbuster sucked out
the air that was outside

1109
01:09:30,701 --> 01:09:35,020
of his lung and sold the whole shot.
That's fascinating.

1110
01:09:35,530 --> 01:09:37,900
He finally got out of the
hospital and is doing fine,

1111
01:09:37,901 --> 01:09:40,450
but I just thought you'd appreciate
knowing you're at the level where your

1112
01:09:40,451 --> 01:09:45,451
comedy caused someone's Oregon to explode
like the Goddamn deathstar keep this

1113
01:09:45,521 --> 01:09:49,390
up and you'll be well on your way to
fixing the overpopulation problem anyways.

1114
01:09:49,391 --> 01:09:53,230
Can't wait for you to get come back to
Minnesota so he can finish the job and

1115
01:09:53,231 --> 01:09:56,670
get his left lung. Hope all is
well with the family. Thinks. Ah,

1116
01:09:56,820 --> 01:10:00,430
I'm glad you guys came out and I'm glad
your brother's doing all right. Um,

1117
01:10:01,820 --> 01:10:04,990
all right. I think that's the, uh,
I think that's the podcast here,

1118
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:10,960
uh, for this week. Um, all right. I
think there was a formula one race today.

1119
01:10:11,030 --> 01:10:14,980
I'm taping this Sunday night.
I got to sit down and watch that,

1120
01:10:14,981 --> 01:10:18,040
but I got so much shit to do.
Um,

1121
01:10:19,850 --> 01:10:21,530
is that it is, do I
have anything? Oh yeah.

1122
01:10:21,531 --> 01:10:26,240
This weekend I'm going to be with
Nate Kraig and Houston. All right.

1123
01:10:26,300 --> 01:10:31,090
Houston, Texas in July as
a bald, redheaded male.

1124
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:33,680
And then I'm going to be in Dallas.

1125
01:10:33,740 --> 01:10:36,260
I didn't know how many shows I'm fucking
doing here. Let me check it out here.

1126
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:38,720
All right,
so here's the deal.

1127
01:10:38,721 --> 01:10:43,721
Thursday I got a show at
revention music center in Texas.

1128
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:49,240
Friday I have a show at prevention
music center in Houston,

1129
01:10:49,341 --> 01:10:53,720
Texas. There's still tickets
to Thursday, Friday sold out.

1130
01:10:54,290 --> 01:10:58,340
And then I got two shows in,
uh,

1131
01:10:58,370 --> 01:10:59,330
the pavilion

1132
01:11:01,310 --> 01:11:05,300
up in Dallas at the Toyota music factory.
Um,

1133
01:11:05,330 --> 01:11:09,920
also I added a show right before
the rough and rowdy in Rochester,

1134
01:11:09,921 --> 01:11:13,130
New York, right outside of Buffalo,
which I haven't been to in a Zillion,

1135
01:11:15,090 --> 01:11:17,040
um,
Rochester,

1136
01:11:17,041 --> 01:11:22,041
former home of the Rochester royals that
then became the Cincinnati royals than

1137
01:11:22,921 --> 01:11:27,780
the Kansas City Slash Omaha
kings than the Kansas City kings.

1138
01:11:28,110 --> 01:11:31,200
And then the Sacramento Kings.
Hey Bill, why would they,

1139
01:11:31,201 --> 01:11:34,260
Kansas City and Omaha King spoke cause
they used to split their home games

1140
01:11:34,261 --> 01:11:37,800
between both those cities.
Seeing which town gave a fuck more.

1141
01:11:38,490 --> 01:11:41,970
Kansas City didn't have any
college football. Omaha did.

1142
01:11:42,170 --> 01:11:43,590
While I guess it's the
Lincoln, Nebraska, right?

1143
01:11:45,180 --> 01:11:47,730
Where is the University of Nebraska?
I only went to a fucking game out there.

1144
01:11:47,731 --> 01:11:51,540
I always forget what it had said and
then they became the Sacramento Kings.

1145
01:11:52,050 --> 01:11:55,230
I'm into that shit.
I'm going to pass tissues.

1146
01:11:55,231 --> 01:11:58,530
You want to do a couple of cool
ones? All right. Here's a good one.

1147
01:11:59,010 --> 01:12:00,510
Kansas City Scouts,

1148
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:04,230
NHL team moved to Colorado,

1149
01:12:04,231 --> 01:12:07,650
became the Colorado Rockies
and then moved to New Jersey,

1150
01:12:07,651 --> 01:12:12,570
became the New Jersey devils. Okay.
I can't do all your homework for you,

1151
01:12:12,571 --> 01:12:16,620
but I can do some of it. All right.
The original Washington senators,

1152
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:22,400
1901 to 1960 they left and became the
Minnesota twins and then the senators came

1153
01:12:23,971 --> 01:12:26,520
back briefly in Washington,

1154
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:31,410
almost like they retain the name like
the Cleveland browns and it was a second

1155
01:12:31,710 --> 01:12:36,710
incarnation of the fucking Washington
senators and they also failed and then

1156
01:12:38,071 --> 01:12:42,150
they moved to Texas and
became the Texas Rangers.

1157
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:47,100
All right.
You want to hit some more?

1158
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:52,380
What else do I go? All right. The New
York Yankees. Who were they originally?

1159
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:54,180
The Baltimore Orioles.

1160
01:12:55,650 --> 01:12:58,620
1901 to 1902 then they became
the New York islanders,

1161
01:12:58,980 --> 01:13:02,730
1903 to 1912 then they
became the New York Yankees,

1162
01:13:02,950 --> 01:13:07,740
1913 to present now the
Baltimore Oil Oreos.

1163
01:13:08,850 --> 01:13:10,710
I knew they were the
old Saint Louis Browns,

1164
01:13:10,711 --> 01:13:12,570
but I didn't realize they were the first,

1165
01:13:12,571 --> 01:13:16,050
they were the Milwaukee brewers in 1901
then they will then that Saint Louis

1166
01:13:16,051 --> 01:13:21,051
browns in 1902 to 1953 and from
1954 till now they became the Oreos.

1167
01:13:21,580 --> 01:13:25,620
All right, that's it. Ken, I want to
talk to you guys anymore about this.

1168
01:13:25,621 --> 01:13:30,190
What the Oakland A's, is that, is that,
is that what you were asking about? Well,

1169
01:13:30,191 --> 01:13:34,650
they were the Philadelphia athletics
in 1901 to 1954 then the Kansas City

1170
01:13:34,651 --> 01:13:38,670
athletics to 1955 in
1967 and then they will,

1171
01:13:38,700 --> 01:13:43,700
the became the Oakland A's 1968
to 1986 and then the Oakland,

1172
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:46,560
Oakland Athletics 1987 to present.

1173
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:48,090
I don't know what that means
as far as I'm concerned.

1174
01:13:48,210 --> 01:13:50,390
They've been the Oakland A's
or the athletics and 68 but I,

1175
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:53,820
that's what this fucking thing
said to me. You know, and you know,

1176
01:13:53,821 --> 01:13:55,080
I learned about all of this shit.

1177
01:13:55,260 --> 01:13:58,620
A lot of teams have passed
through Kansas City started there,

1178
01:13:58,980 --> 01:14:02,820
have gone through there, and
then they just fucking, you know,

1179
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:06,330
Kansas City Scouts,
Kansas City kings,

1180
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:12,510
Kansas City athletics. They've had a
lot of people come and go, you know,

1181
01:14:13,830 --> 01:14:16,800
and there's only one
solution that I can think of.

1182
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:21,270
There's a lot of constant Kansas
City. All right, go fuck yourselves.

1183
01:14:21,271 --> 01:14:22,260
I'll talk to you on Thursday.
