00:00:00.191 --> 00:00:02.223
- I would like you to pause the video

00:00:02.223 --> 00:00:06.286
and think about what 64 minus 31 is.

00:00:06.286 --> 00:00:09.456
Alright, now let's think about this together.

00:00:09.456 --> 00:00:13.900
So what does 64 actually mean?

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.818
Well we can use place value to think about that.

00:00:15.818 --> 00:00:18.280
The six is in the tens place

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.828
and the four is in the ones place.

00:00:21.828 --> 00:00:25.826
So the six over here, that means six tens.

00:00:25.826 --> 00:00:27.927
It means six groups of ten.

00:00:27.927 --> 00:00:31.596
And so, we can visualize that right over here.

00:00:31.596 --> 00:00:35.393
Six tens, one, two, three, four, five, six

00:00:35.393 --> 00:00:37.157
groups of ten.

00:00:37.157 --> 00:00:38.260
Or another way to think about it,

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.650
six tens, these are 60 boxes right over here

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:43.125
in groups of ten.

00:00:43.125 --> 00:00:44.994
And then we have four ones.

00:00:44.994 --> 00:00:49.893
Well this is four ones right over here.

00:00:49.893 --> 00:00:51.484
Four ones.

00:00:51.484 --> 00:00:54.352
So this is 64.

00:00:54.352 --> 00:00:55.907
Six tens, four ones.

00:00:55.907 --> 00:00:58.357
Altogether I have 64 boxes.

00:00:58.357 --> 00:01:00.284
Sixty of these blue ones

00:01:00.284 --> 00:01:01.887
and I have four ones.

00:01:01.887 --> 00:01:03.884
Four of these individual ones.

00:01:03.884 --> 00:01:06.519
Now I want to take away 31.

00:01:06.519 --> 00:01:08.226
Well what is 31?

00:01:08.226 --> 00:01:11.384
Thirty-one is three tens and one one.

00:01:11.384 --> 00:01:14.646
So let's first take away the one one.

00:01:14.646 --> 00:01:15.761
We're going to take this away,

00:01:15.761 --> 00:01:16.550
we're subtracting.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:17.850
We're subtracting three tens

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.790
and we're subtracting one one.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.448
So let's take away that one one.

00:01:22.448 --> 00:01:24.920
And then how many ones are we left with?

00:01:24.921 --> 00:01:27.545
Well now we're left with three ones.

00:01:27.545 --> 00:01:30.354
So four ones minus one one

00:01:30.354 --> 00:01:32.583
is three ones.

00:01:32.583 --> 00:01:37.483
Now let's think about the tens.

00:01:37.483 --> 00:01:40.116
So I had six tens.

00:01:40.116 --> 00:01:42.243
I'm going to take away three of them.

00:01:42.243 --> 00:01:43.949
I'm going to take away three of the tens.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:44.658
So let's do that.

00:01:44.658 --> 00:01:47.176
Let's take away, that's one ten,

00:01:47.176 --> 00:01:49.923
two tens and then three tens.

00:01:49.923 --> 00:01:52.240
And so what am I going to have left over?

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.452
Well I'm going to have left over,

00:01:53.452 --> 00:01:55.540
just three tens.

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.653
Just these three, these three right over here.

00:01:58.653 --> 00:02:03.193
So six tens minus three tens is three tens.

00:02:03.193 --> 00:02:07.686
And so 64 minus 31 is 33.

00:02:07.686 --> 00:02:09.787
Three tens and three ones.

00:02:09.787 --> 00:02:12.860
Three tens, this is a group of ten,

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:13.827
another group of ten, another group of ten.

00:02:13.827 --> 00:02:16.219
Three tens and then three ones.

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:19.267
One, two, three.
