00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:04.710
&gt;&gt;Cliff: So, good afternoon everyone. Welcome
to another awesome Authors@Google talk. Today,

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.400
we're particularly honored to host Eboo Patel.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.430
Now, as part of the Campus Honors Program
at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign,

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:18.039
the name Eboo Patel is always displayed prominently
on our walls, it's sort of a myth and legend

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:22.901
thing as, as we progress through the program;
someone larger than life. And that's, to a

00:00:22.901 --> 00:00:26.579
certain extent who Eboo is; he's always striving
for the greater good.

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:30.869
He found his calling through the promotion
of interfaith dialogue, making the interfaith

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.850
conversation as, as important and relevant
as the environmental con-, conversation, the

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.720
social justice conversation, and he's found
his particular outlet on, on college campuses,

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:47.519
which is a, a traditional area for, for discussion
and, and un-, understanding. And E-, Eboo's

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:52.999
team has made a big impact in terms of fostering
interfaith dialogue on college campuses.

00:00:52.999 --> 00:00:57.379
Now, his work does reach beyond the college
campus and the University. He serves currently

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:02.409
on the board of President Obama's Religious
Advisory Committee, and he writes regularly

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:07.920
for The Washington Post in a, a blog that
deals with interfaith issues. It's entitled,

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.520
"The Faith Divide."

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.420
Today, he'll be speaking to us about his work
through his non-profit, which is the Interfaith

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.280
Youth Corps, and as well as his book, his
book, which is entitled, "Acts of Faith: The

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.079
Story of an American Muslim, the Struggle
for the Soul of a Generation." Now, Eboo has

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:28.009
many titles and awards from being a, a Rhodes
Scholar to an Ashoka Fellow to a, a member

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:31.619
of the, the National Committee of the Aga
Khan Foundation.

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.770
He's one of the social entrepreneurs to watch
on our nation's stage, but, but his true merit

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.649
lies in his impact in work and by fostering
interfaith dialogue, Eboo helps make the world

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:45.980
truly a better place. So, we'll have some
time for Q&amp;A at the end. Feel free to use

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.090
the, the mics and otherwise, please join me
in welcoming Eboo to Google.

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:55.130
[applause]

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:56.130
Thank you.

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.270
&gt;&gt;Patel: Thank you. Well, thank you to my
fellow Ilini, Cliff. Thank you, too, Usma,

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:05.620
Mahin, and Cliff, for hosting me for lunch.
Thank you to Google. This, you wanna talk

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:13.390
about legend, this company is legend, this
campus is legend, and I was joking with Usma

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.640
and Mahin, and Cliff earlier saying, "I've
long wanted to visit Google, but I felt a

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.390
little peculiar about being a tourist here."
So, when I got the, the invitation to come

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.410
speak I thought, "Well, you know, this is,
this is my opportunity to kind of get an oogle

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:33.440
at Google, if you will, and see the famous
pool tables and the coffee shops and the cafeterias

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.370
and, and the tents and, thank you."

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:43.620
Thank you. Thank you for, for being part of
a generation that envisioned a new world and

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.570
then built that world. And that's what we're
trying to do in our own way at the Interfaith

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:54.460
Youth Corps. And I wanna, what I wanna describe
for you is, is where that vision came from,

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:59.640
what that vision is, and how we're trying
to build it. And then what I'd love is your

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:05.620
advice. I mean your advice as a community
of people who, as I said, have imagined a

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:13.840
new world and then built that new world, right?
How, how could you counsel us in dramatically

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.700
expanding our reach and our impact?

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.790
So, to begin with, I wanna take you back to
a place that Cliff and I happen to share,

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.590
which is the University of Illinois, and I
understand that there's a pretty good pipeline

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:32.930
from Champaign Urbana, Illinois to Mountain
View, California, a set of very, very talented

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:38.330
computer engineers who are working here at
Google and I wanna tell you that, that my

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:45.890
year, my time in Champaign was a dramatic
paradigm shift for me. My, and, and the paradigm

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:52.900
shift was largely around issues of identity
and diversity, right? I grew up as a, as a

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:59.480
person of color, an Indian American who's
Muslim in the suburbs of Chicago and, you

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:05.100
know, frankly, I, I spent a lot of time trying
to be white in the western suburbs of Chicago

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.510
because that's was kind of the dominant cultural
archetype.

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.500
And when I got to the University of Illinois,
I became part of a conversation about what

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:20.049
does it mean to build a truly multicultural
America where people are proud of their racial,

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:25.330
their ethnic, their national backgrounds,
and where they're contributing the best of

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:30.009
those backgrounds to build this, this nation
that has gathered people from the four corners

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:36.719
of the Earth. And the multicultural conversation
was very, very prominent in the mid 1990s

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:40.211
all over the country and including the University
of Illinois.

00:04:40.211 --> 00:04:45.810
And like any good 17-year old, first year
student, I would go home to my parent's house

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:51.430
in Glen Ellyn and I would regale my father
with all my newfound wisdom from my first

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:56.051
year in college. And I would lecture him over
and over again about identity and diversity

00:04:56.051 --> 00:05:01.009
and my dad would kind of roll his eyes and
be like, you know, "I got my MBA from Notre

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:06.371
Dame University in South Bend, Indiana, and
I was one of the first Indian Americans in

00:05:06.371 --> 00:05:10.729
a senior position in corporate advertising.
You think I don't know something about diversity?

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:16.659
And you think I don't know something about
trying to advance multiculturalism?"

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:21.729
My dad said one thing to me, which not only
struck me deeply at that point, but frankly,

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:27.110
changed my life. And he said, "For all your
talk about identity and diversity, you, you

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:33.749
never mentioned the form of identity and the
type of diversity that's driving global politics.

00:05:33.749 --> 00:05:41.949
And that's religion." My dad was exactly right.
Think about '93, '94, '95, '96, that mid to

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:43.060
late 1990s.

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:48.699
Think about some of the most prominent global
events during that time. There was the World

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:54.069
Trade Center bombing in 1993, kind of Al-Qaeda's
coming out party, if you will, there was the

00:05:54.069 --> 00:06:00.439
assassination of Yitzhak Rabin in the Middle
East, there was the possibilities represented

00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:05.340
by the Oslo Process and then the breakdown
of that process, there was a nuclear test

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:11.139
in India dubbed, "The Hindu Bomb," there was
the response in Pakistan dubbed, "The Muslim

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:19.659
Bomb," there was a, a terrible rampage through
Champaign, Illinois and Chicago and Bloomington,

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:27.389
Indiana, somebody who shot and targeted Jews,
Asian Americans, and African Americans.

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:35.039
And each of those incidents of horror, you
know, an additional one is the bombing at

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:41.710
the Atlanta Olympics in 1996, each of those
incidents of horror was perpetrated to the

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:47.069
soundtrack of prayer. It was committed in
the name of God, right? And what's interesting

00:06:47.069 --> 00:06:53.159
is that the perpetrators came from different
religions, so Al-Qaeda clearly claims Muslim

00:06:53.159 --> 00:07:00.159
heritage. The assassin of Yitzhak Rabin in
1995 was Jewish; claims Jewish heritage.

00:07:00.159 --> 00:07:06.870
The person who shot Jews, African Americans,
and Asian Americans in, in the Midwest, was

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:13.999
part of the Christian Identity movement, right?
So, a huge part of national and global politics

00:07:13.999 --> 00:07:19.449
was this emergence of religious extremism.
And Sam Huntington, the late Harvard political

00:07:19.449 --> 00:07:25.309
scientist, put a framework on this. For my
money, a very dangerous framework. He said

00:07:25.309 --> 00:07:31.770
that the next era in human history was gonna
be defined by what he called "The Clash of

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:32.770
Civilizations."

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:38.289
The simple definition of the Clash of Civilizations
is that people from different religious backgrounds

00:07:38.289 --> 00:07:43.490
were inherently and inevitably at odds with
each other, right? We were gonna enter a period

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:48.460
of inter-religious war. So, his message to
people from different religions is espe-,

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:54.180
is essentially that people from the other
faith are coming; sharpen your swords, right?

00:07:54.180 --> 00:08:00.120
You have to if, if, if, if you don't wanna
die, you have to, you have to prepare to defeat

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:05.800
and kill and win, right? That's the message
of the Clash of Civilizations. And my dad

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:07.969
was exactly right.

00:08:07.969 --> 00:08:14.379
There was almost no discussion of this on
my college campus. And Diana Eck, a professor

00:08:14.379 --> 00:08:18.400
at Harvard, who writes on religious diversity,
actually pointed out that there was almost

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:22.840
no discussion of religion in the diversity
multicultural conversation nationally. She

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:29.699
says religion is the missing "R" in the diversity
conversation. And not only was this missing,

00:08:29.699 --> 00:08:34.380
in kind of a global macro way, it was also
missing in a personal way and there's something

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:40.070
that happened when I was a resident advisor
at the University of Illinois that I, I still

00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:41.950
remember.

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:48.510
So, again, this is in the midst in the multicultural
movement where, where we are often invited

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:53.610
to share our identities and to talk about
how we might have met-, been made to feel

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:57.370
uncomfortable because of a certain part of
our identity. So, we're having this type of

00:08:57.370 --> 00:09:01.820
workshop as a group of resident advisors at
the University of Illinois and people are

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:06.810
saying, "Well, you know, as an African American,
you know, this happened to me. As a Latino

00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:11.110
American, this happened to me that made me
feel uncomfortable or marginalized."

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:16.120
So, it gets around to my friend Kizar and
Kizar says, "You know, there was something

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:20.950
that happened in the cafeteria a couple weeks
ago that made me feel really uncomfortable."

00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:25.630
There was a group of student who basically
had a food fight, who kept on getting food

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:31.111
and throwing it around and, and everybody,
including the resident advisors and the cafeteria

00:09:31.111 --> 00:09:36.550
workers, they were all laughing and effectively
encouraging this terrible waste of food. And

00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:43.050
Kizar said, you know, "For me, food is life
and life is from God and that is precious

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:49.010
because I'm a Muslim and, so I was a little
bit offended by what happened. As I looked

00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:53.180
around at the faces of these resident advisors
and these other kind of campus leaders of

00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:58.570
the University of Illinois, people who are,
you know, trained to be aware of how people's

00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:03.350
identities affect their lives, blank stares."

00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:08.770
They weren't opposed to what Kizar was saying;
they just had no radar screen for it. They

00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:15.180
had no radar screen for somebody making salient
their religious identity and the role it played

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:22.010
in their lives. And I thought to myself, "Wow.
You know, we're missing a great opportunity

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:29.270
here, right? Because at the global, political
level, the story that's being written is a

00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:34.930
story of religions and conflict with each
other. And who seemed to be the perpetrators

00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:39.680
of that conflict? Who, who were, were the
foot soldiers of religious extremism?

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:46.230
They're always teenagers and twenty-something's,
right?" I mean, the assassin of Yitzhak Rabin

00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:52.930
is 26 years old. Almost all of the September
11th hijackers; in their twenties, right?

00:10:52.930 --> 00:11:01.740
Osama bin Laden recruited into extremism when
he's14 years old, right? The person who bombs

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:07.540
the Atlanta Olympics, part of the Christian
Identity movement, is just 30 years old. Religious

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:11.530
extremism is a movement of young people taking
action.

00:11:11.530 --> 00:11:17.490
Well, here was this other movement happening
on college campuses of young people who wanted

00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:23.340
to be aware, in an appreciative way, of identities
that mattered to people and to bring those

00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:29.060
identities into harmony and cooperation, but
we weren't talking about religion. We were

00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:34.310
forfeiting that territory to the religious
extremists of the world. I thought to myself,

00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:40.260
"You know, we, we oughtta be able to do something
different. We oughtta be able to do something

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:41.260
different."

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:44.970
And, and one of the things that gave me an
awful lot of encouragement and inspiration

00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:51.760
was history, you know? So much of the 20th
century's most inspiring movements are actually

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:57.140
interfaith movements started by young people.
So, Martin Luther King Jr. is obviously a

00:11:57.140 --> 00:12:02.490
great civil rights hero, he's a great African
American hero, he's a great American figure,

00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:09.480
but he's also a great interfaith hero. Now,
King, after all was inspired by Gandhi's movement

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:16.190
in, in India. He marched in Selma with Rabbi
Abraham Joshua Heschel; he carried out a correspondence

00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:22.000
that deeply influenced him by a Buddhist monk
named The Venerable Thich Nhat Hahn, right?

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:28.630
King learns from people from a variety of
religious backgrounds even as he s-, remains

00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:33.000
deeply, deeply rooted in his own Christian
faith and he learns how to bring people from

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.570
different religions together to serve the
common good. The Civil Rights movement is

00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:43.220
an interfaith movement. Same with Gandhi's
Hintz Barrage movement in India, same with

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:50.760
the struggle in South Africa, right? Same
with movements like community organizing;

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:53.360
these are interfaith movements.

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:58.620
And so, I think to myself, "If those were
movements that were built of the early and

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:04.610
mid-late part of the 20th centuries, couldn't
we be part of writing the next chapter in

00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:11.200
interfaith cooperation, especially in an era
of global religious conflict?" Final inspiring

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:18.610
dimension from history: the people who started
those interfaith movements, they're our age,

00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:26.070
younger. King, in Montgomery in 1955, when
he led the bus boycott, was 26 years old.

00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:31.690
Mandela, when he founds the Youth League of
the African National Congress; 26 years old.

00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:35.310
Gandhi, when he starts the movement against
the racist pass laws of South Africa in the

00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:43.400
early 20th century; 24 years old. The Dalai
Lama, when he moves Tibetans into India; 24

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:50.710
years old, right? Well, if interfaith cooperation
in previous eras was a movement of young people,

00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:58.470
why not today? Why can't we make the story
of young people's involvement in religious

00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:02.840
diversity in the 21st century, not a story
of the Clash of Civilizations, but a story

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:05.540
of interfaith cooperation?

00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:11.640
I think religion in the 21st century can go
one of four basic directions. It can be a

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:16.660
bubble of isolation, you can say that your
religious commitment or your, your humanist

00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:20.860
commitment, whatever it might be, walls you
off from everybody different and if you're

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:25.250
a Muslim, you can't talk to anybody else.
If you're a Hindu or a Christian or a Humanist,

00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:28.610
you can't have any dealings with anybody else
from a different background, so it can be

00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:34.290
a bubble. It can be a barrier of division.
Your religion is so different from anybody

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:38.120
else's that you're actually in an oppositional
tension.

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:43.670
It can be a bomb of destruction, you know,
you feel like you need to dominate people

00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:50.310
from other backgrounds, violently. Or, it
can be a bridge of cooperation. The 21st century

00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:54.380
could lift up the best of the spirit of the
Civil Rights movement, the best of the spirit

00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:58.550
of the south-, the, the struggle in South
Africa, the best of the spirit of the Settlement

00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:03.350
House Movement in the United States, and say
that people from different religious backgrounds,

00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:08.670
including no religion at all, ought to interact
in ways that build understanding and cooperation.

00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:14.520
We oughtta be building bridges, right? I think
that there are four main trends in the world

00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:19.380
that make this one of the great topics of
our times, right? Trend number one is we're

00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:24.300
living during a time of religious revival.
You know, the best sociologists forty years

00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:29.450
ago, people like Peter Berger, many, many
other were saying that, you know, religion

00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:36.970
is dead. As societies modernize, they secularize
necessarily, right? Well, a lot of those sociologists,

00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:41.660
in light of you know, recent movements and
trends and demographics, say that they made

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:47.600
what Berger calls a "category mistake." Modernity
doesn't so much secularize as it pluralizes,

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:53.680
right? And, indeed, what numbers show right
now is that there's, there's religion, as

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:59.150
Peter Berger says, "The world is as religious
as it ever was; perhaps more furiously religious

00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:03.750
than ever." Right? Sure, there's a growth
in people who call themselves nonbelievers,

00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:10.750
but there's increased fervence in a particular
set of believers, especially in areas of the

00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:15.350
world defined by the second trend. The second
trend is the "youth bulge".

00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:20.200
We live in a very, very young world. You at
Google are probably hyperaware of this because

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:26.730
a lot of, so many people who are fast adopters
of new Google technologies and approaches

00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:30.880
are very young people because they're, they're
the first ones who kind of, you know, they

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:35.180
don't have to go from a landline to a cell
phone. They just go straight to a cell phone

00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:39.920
and then whatever the next technology is that
you guys are, are, are developing here. Lemme

00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:47.440
give you some stats on this. The median age
in Iraq is 19.5. The median age in Afghanistan

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:54.560
is 17.6. There are more children in India
than there are citizens of the United States,

00:16:54.560 --> 00:17:00.720
and none of those places is the youngest place
on the planet. That award goes to Uganda,

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:07.870
right? How are all these young people gonna
view their identities in an era of religious

00:17:07.870 --> 00:17:15.019
revival? Are they gonna view them, those identities,
as bubbles, as bombs, as barriers, or as bridges?

00:17:15.019 --> 00:17:21.919
Ok, third trend that I wanna make salient
is the breakdown of traditional socioeconomic

00:17:21.919 --> 00:17:30.299
patterns. Very simply, for much of human history,
people have expected to live the type of life,

00:17:30.299 --> 00:17:35.259
have the kind of job, have the kind of family,
have the kind of socioeconomic pattern, if

00:17:35.259 --> 00:17:42.759
you will, that their parents had, right? Well,
those jobs don't exist anymore from, you know,

00:17:42.759 --> 00:17:50.600
Kansas City to Cairo to Cape Town, right?
And if the same jobs don't exist then you

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:53.929
can't build a family structure on top of those
jobs, right?

00:17:53.929 --> 00:18:01.289
You're, you're seeing entire socioeconomic
patterns, entire waves, ways of life disappear.

00:18:01.289 --> 00:18:07.830
And what that does is make identity questions.
"Who am I?" questions that much more acute,

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:13.139
that much sharper, right? Because you no longer
have the same kind of identity in being a,

00:18:13.139 --> 00:18:21.129
a worker at a GM factory or being a worker
at a government office in Cairo. So, you're

00:18:21.129 --> 00:18:26.039
constantly saying, "Who am I and what type
of pattern, what type of life pattern am I

00:18:26.039 --> 00:18:27.429
expected to live?"

00:18:27.429 --> 00:18:32.080
The fourth trend, another type of, another
thing you guys are hyperaware of here at Google,

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:37.110
and in fact, a trend that you have dramatically
accelerated, is the increase in interaction

00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:45.509
by people from different backgrounds, ok?
So, just about everybody on Earth right now

00:18:45.509 --> 00:18:51.240
is aware that there are people who are very
different than them on Earth. And think about

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:53.720
how shocking that is.

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:59.639
If you weren't aware, if, if, if you thought
that the whole world went to church on Sunday,

00:18:59.639 --> 00:19:05.320
right, you're entire town of seven hundred
people goes to church on Sunday and then one

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:10.809
person moves in to your town who doesn't go
to church, right? Or you're aware of somebody

00:19:10.809 --> 00:19:14.399
on the other side of the world because of
some Google application that puts you in touch

00:19:14.399 --> 00:19:20.520
with that person, of somebody who prays very
differently, or doesn't pray at all, doesn't

00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:26.240
believe in God at all or believes in a, in
one God fervently, or believes that Jesus

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:30.230
is the son of God when you believe Jesus is
a prophet of God, right?

00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:37.539
You start asking yourself two, deep, gut level
questions. Question number one: If that person

00:19:37.539 --> 00:19:42.450
believes something differently, why do I believe
what I believe? If the Buddhist kid who just

00:19:42.450 --> 00:19:47.899
moved into my town doesn't go to church on
Sunday, why do I go to church on Sunday? Now

00:19:47.899 --> 00:19:54.340
what you took for granted because it was your
whole world before, because, you know, all

00:19:54.340 --> 00:20:01.799
you knew is a fish was water, right? When
somebody shows you air, you start to ask yourself

00:20:01.799 --> 00:20:04.669
the question, "Why do I live in water?"

00:20:04.669 --> 00:20:13.580
And the second question it makes salient is:
How do I relate to that person? So, she doesn't

00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:18.980
go to church on Sunday. He doesn't pray the
way that I do. She doesn't believe in God

00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:25.869
at all. So, what does that mean for how we
relate to each other? Right? So, think of

00:20:25.869 --> 00:20:31.610
the intersection of these four trends; the
religious revival, the youth bulge, the breakdown

00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:37.320
of socioeconomic patterns, and the increase
in interaction of people from different backgrounds.

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:45.289
And, if you will, personify that for a moment.
Think of the 17 year old kid in Cairo, or

00:20:45.289 --> 00:20:51.980
the 17 year old kid in a favela outside of
Rio, or in a township outside of Johannesburg,

00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:58.929
or in a small town in Nebraska, right? And
think of the number of 17 year old kids around

00:20:58.929 --> 00:21:08.700
the world who can't live the life that their
mom or dad lived, right? Who are asking themselves

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:13.190
all sorts of "who am I" questions and are
now asking not only what does it mean to be

00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:20.039
a Pentecostal in Brazil or a Catholic in Nebraska
or a Muslim in Cairo or a Hindu in India,

00:21:20.039 --> 00:21:27.399
but what does it mean to be one of those people
in a world of Pentecostal, of Brazilian Pes-,

00:21:27.399 --> 00:21:34.899
Pentecostals, Israeli Jews, Indian Hindus,
American Catholics, right? Who am I in this

00:21:34.899 --> 00:21:41.040
world? How do I relate to those people? There
is an enormous energy at the intersection

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:46.369
of those four trends and the thing that scares
me is the people who figured that energy out

00:21:46.369 --> 00:21:50.039
first are religious extremist movements, ok?

00:21:50.039 --> 00:21:55.980
I view extremist movements from Al-Qaeda to
the Christian Identity Movement to their equivalents

00:21:55.980 --> 00:22:02.470
in every faith and they have equivalents in
every faith. I view them as effectively youth

00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:09.330
movements. They are movements that understand
the psychology of 16 to 24 year olds, understand

00:22:09.330 --> 00:22:16.559
the confusion and power and search for clarity
and impact that it as at the heart of what

00:22:16.559 --> 00:22:22.129
it means to be at that intersection. These
movements re-, have a clear message to those

00:22:22.129 --> 00:22:30.630
young people, "Your religious civilization
was once a magnificent people and look at

00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:38.409
us now. We are in the gutter. We're suffering,
but you can return us to glory. All you need

00:22:38.409 --> 00:22:43.920
to do is dominate those other people, right?"

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:52.259
These religious extremist movements recruit,
train, network, and mobilize young people

00:22:52.259 --> 00:22:58.220
to be the foot soldiers of religious extremism.
That's why on the evening news tonight, and

00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:02.830
tomorrow night, and the next night, you're
gonna see some story of some young person

00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:07.509
killing other people to the soundtrack of
prayer. It's no accident that they're young.

00:23:07.509 --> 00:23:13.210
They were recruited young. They were trained
young. They were mobilized young. The Interfaith

00:23:13.210 --> 00:23:20.450
Youth Corps is a movement that wants to turn
the tide. We wanna change the story. We see

00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:26.549
a movement of young people taking up the mantle
of King, and Jane Adams, and Dorothy Day,

00:23:26.549 --> 00:23:32.539
and Mother Teresa, and Abraham Joshua Heschel,
and Nelson Mandela; a movement of young people

00:23:32.539 --> 00:23:37.529
who believes in a world of pluralism, who
believes in a world where people from different

00:23:37.529 --> 00:23:41.450
backgrounds live in equal dignity and mutual
loyalty.

00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:45.980
A world where people's identities are respected,
a world where there are positive relationships

00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:51.249
between people of different communities, and
a world where those people are coming together

00:23:51.249 --> 00:23:56.850
to serve the common good. We call that a world
of pluralism. That's the world that we're

00:23:56.850 --> 00:24:05.280
trying to build, right? We would like interfaith
cooperation to be a social norm in the same

00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:09.169
way that environmentalism has become a social
norm, in the same way that service learning

00:24:09.169 --> 00:24:13.549
has become a social norm, in the same way
that the human rights movement is a social

00:24:13.549 --> 00:24:14.549
norm.

00:24:14.549 --> 00:24:19.539
When you walk out onto the street, the Google
campus is a unique chakra of the world, so

00:24:19.539 --> 00:24:25.980
let's not use you guys as the, as the test
case here, but let's say you were to walk

00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:31.279
some miles in any direction. You tap somebody
on the shoulder and say, "Human Rights Movement."

00:24:31.279 --> 00:24:34.889
They would know what you were talkin about.
"Environmentalism." They would know what you

00:24:34.889 --> 00:24:38.039
were talkin about. They would say, "Yeah,
that's a good thing. The Earth is precious

00:24:38.039 --> 00:24:43.000
and it ought to be protected and, you know,
I recycle and I drive a hybrid car and we

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:49.080
compost at my home. I participate in this
thing." What would it look like for interfaith

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:54.769
cooperation to have the same clarity of definition?
To have the same participatory culture? Where

00:24:54.769 --> 00:24:58.590
you walk out in the street in ten or fifteen
years and tap somebody on the shoulder and

00:24:58.590 --> 00:25:02.269
say, "Interfaith cooperation," and the, the
person says, "Yeah, you know, people from

00:25:02.269 --> 00:25:06.090
different religious backgrounds including
no religion at all, they ought to be coming

00:25:06.090 --> 00:25:09.200
together in ways that build understanding
and cooperation."

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:13.000
That's the definition of interfaith cooperation
and, and I'm a part of that. You know how

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:19.749
I'm a part of it? Because I, I have a knowledge
base of, of how different religions speak

00:25:19.749 --> 00:25:25.669
to service, right? So, I don't get my, my
information on Islam from the evening news.

00:25:25.669 --> 00:25:30.019
I don't get my information on Judaism or Hinduism
or Evangelical Christianity from the evening

00:25:30.019 --> 00:25:34.830
news. I have an appreciative knowledge of
the world's religions, including humanism,

00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:41.570
right? I, my church or synagogue or mosque,
we're part of a congregational exchange, right?

00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:47.429
My 15 year old son or daughter, he or she
participates in Interfaith Habitat for Humanity

00:25:47.429 --> 00:25:52.389
builds four times a year as part of the youth
group of our temple. The college campus that

00:25:52.389 --> 00:25:57.120
my 19 year old daughter is on, she's the leader
of the Interfaith Student Council. The mayor

00:25:57.120 --> 00:26:01.679
of Mountain View or the mayor of Palo Alto
or the mayor of Chicago, they hosted their

00:26:01.679 --> 00:26:07.929
eighth annual Day of Interfaith Service and
this year it had eight thousand people, right?

00:26:07.929 --> 00:26:12.860
That's the kind of texture that I'm talking
about for interfaith cooperation being a social

00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:18.020
norm. It means people have a framework of
what it means to build interfaith cooperation;

00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:22.879
it means they have a knowledge base of how
different religions speak to service and what

00:26:22.879 --> 00:26:27.010
it is in their own tradition that would inspire
them to cooperate with others. And they have

00:26:27.010 --> 00:26:31.220
a skill set. They have the ability to bring
people from different religious backgrounds

00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:37.210
together to build understanding and cooperation.
That's interfaith cooperation becoming a social

00:26:37.210 --> 00:26:38.210
norm.

00:26:38.210 --> 00:26:45.230
We think that there, that, that we can advance
three core strategies against this. Obviously,

00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:50.489
in any movement that becomes a social norm,
there are a thousand organizations. There

00:26:50.489 --> 00:26:55.529
are a million different niches. Environmentalism
has, you know, people who chain themselves

00:26:55.529 --> 00:27:00.730
to redwood trees and people who buy hybrid
cars and people who start recycling programs

00:27:00.730 --> 00:27:04.080
in elementary schools and people who give
money to the Sierra Club, right?

00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:09.269
There are a million riffs on environmentalism,
but everybody knows that at the end of the

00:27:09.269 --> 00:27:14.659
day, what they're about is that the Earth
is precious it ought to be protected, right?

00:27:14.659 --> 00:27:19.039
For interfaith cooperation to become a social
norm, it has to be a field and a movement

00:27:19.039 --> 00:27:24.179
that's as diverse and large and robust as,
as any other movement; as environmentalism

00:27:24.179 --> 00:27:29.370
or human rights or civil rights or service
learning. We would like to advance three key

00:27:29.370 --> 00:27:30.700
strategies.

00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:37.789
Key strategy number one: We need to spread
a message and shape a discourse around interfaith

00:27:37.789 --> 00:27:45.789
cooperation. Part of what I woke up and realized
a couple years ago is every night, Al-Qaeda

00:27:45.789 --> 00:27:52.739
advertises "religion is violent" on the evening
news for free, right? If you want a commer-,

00:27:52.739 --> 00:27:56.880
if you're a toothpaste company, or a cola
company, or a car company and you wanna get

00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:04.759
your message out on MSNBC or CNN or NBC, you
gotta pay $50,000 for 30 seconds or $200,000

00:28:04.759 --> 00:28:09.809
for 30 seconds, but if you're a religious
extremist group, all you have to do is videotape

00:28:09.809 --> 00:28:14.139
your beheading and send the videotape to a
media company. And the media company plays

00:28:14.139 --> 00:28:15.139
it for free.

00:28:15.139 --> 00:28:20.019
Now what that effectively is, is an advertisement
for "religion is violent." So, what that means

00:28:20.019 --> 00:28:24.739
is there's a lot of people who walk around
the world and all they know about religion

00:28:24.739 --> 00:28:30.970
period, or somebody else's religion, is that
videotape, and I think that that's terrible,

00:28:30.970 --> 00:28:36.330
right? What does it look like for those of
us who believe in interfaith cooperation and

00:28:36.330 --> 00:28:41.940
who believe that religion can be a bridge
of positive cooperation, to be as aggressive,

00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:47.960
as strategic about advancing our message of
interfaith cooperation, of religion as a bridge,

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:57.320
through media and policy circles? What does
it mean for us to, to shape a discourse that,

00:28:57.320 --> 00:29:04.619
that says that religions, although they have
clear doctrinal differences, also have very

00:29:04.619 --> 00:29:09.789
important shared values? Show me a religion
that doesn't value mercy. Show me a religion

00:29:09.789 --> 00:29:15.770
that doesn't value compassion, hospitality,
service, right? The message that we have to

00:29:15.770 --> 00:29:21.360
send is that religious communities can come
together on these shared values.

00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:26.249
Those values are mutually enriching and they
are actionable and that ought to be part of

00:29:26.249 --> 00:29:33.129
the character of the next era. We cannot forfeit
the, the space of the media or the policy

00:29:33.129 --> 00:29:39.129
to people who believe in the Clash of Civilizations.
We have to make sure that that space is imbued

00:29:39.129 --> 00:29:44.679
with the message of interfaith cooperation.
Strategy number two: We believe a sector needs

00:29:44.679 --> 00:29:49.549
to show what "good" looks like, you know?
One of the things that I love about Google

00:29:49.549 --> 00:29:54.559
is that, in so many ways, this is a company
that shows what "good" looks like; how it

00:29:54.559 --> 00:29:56.989
should treat its employees, right?

00:29:56.989 --> 00:30:02.129
And so many other companies have had to follow
the lead of Google to the benefit of the workforce

00:30:02.129 --> 00:30:07.639
around the country and the world. We think
that college campuses can show what "good"

00:30:07.639 --> 00:30:11.879
looks like when it comes to interfaith cooperation.
Just like college campuses that are around

00:30:11.879 --> 00:30:18.149
multiculturalism and sensitize people to the
importance of, of ethnic and racial and national

00:30:18.149 --> 00:30:23.159
identity, and sought to build a culture where
people from different racial and ethnic and

00:30:23.159 --> 00:30:27.470
national backgrounds were coming together
in a spirit of cooperation.

00:30:27.470 --> 00:30:31.379
College campuses are places where there are
different religious student groups; where

00:30:31.379 --> 00:30:36.029
there's a volunteer office, where there's
an ethos of leadership development, where

00:30:36.029 --> 00:30:41.549
there is a, a sense of being on the vanguard.
Why shouldn't every college campus consider

00:30:41.549 --> 00:30:47.470
it part of its mission to model interfaith
cooperation? Every college campus has days

00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:52.370
of interfaith service. College presidents
give inaugural speeches to the freshman class

00:30:52.370 --> 00:30:57.210
about the importance of religious diversity
and engaging it positively. Well, there are

00:30:57.210 --> 00:31:03.220
academic courses that builds peoples knowledge
base and skill set in interfaith cooperation.

00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:08.529
Orientation leaders, our age, are trained
in religious diversity and interfaith cooperation,

00:31:08.529 --> 00:31:13.139
right? College campuses can show what "good"
looks like.

00:31:13.139 --> 00:31:18.100
And that has, there are two clear benefits
to that. One, is it's a sector that other

00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:23.409
people follow, ok? I'm pretty convinced that
if college campuses show what "good" looks

00:31:23.409 --> 00:31:30.889
like, the corporate sector will follow, high
schools will follow, municipalities will follow,

00:31:30.889 --> 00:31:34.590
right? Higher education likes to serve as
the vanguard. I think they ought to serve

00:31:34.590 --> 00:31:36.469
as a vanguard in this area.

00:31:36.469 --> 00:31:43.269
The second thing is that higher education
trains a nations next generation of leaders.

00:31:43.269 --> 00:31:49.080
So, if you have a generation of leaders who
are imbued with the importance of interfaith

00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:53.730
cooperation, who develop some of the knowledge
base, who acquire the skill set of interfaith

00:31:53.730 --> 00:31:59.289
cooperation, not only do they have a chance
to practice that on their campuses, but they

00:31:59.289 --> 00:32:05.139
go ahead and bring that into the culture when
they graduate. And they take it their neighborhoods

00:32:05.139 --> 00:32:10.309
and to their communities and to their companies;
they become interfaith leaders.

00:32:10.309 --> 00:32:18.619
And that's the third part of the Interfaith
Youth Corps strategy. We need, just like the

00:32:18.619 --> 00:32:22.820
environmental movement has a, a critical mass
of people called "environmentalists" who are

00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:26.269
driving it, and the human rights movement
has a critical mass of people called "human

00:32:26.269 --> 00:32:27.979
rights activists".

00:32:27.979 --> 00:32:33.019
For interfaith cooperation to become a social
norm, we need to have a critical mass of people

00:32:33.019 --> 00:32:38.340
who are called "interfaith leaders." We need
to have an identity category that people can

00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:45.480
i-, that people can relate to, consider themselves
a part of, be in a community within, and that

00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:54.429
identity category says, "It's our job to advance
this ethos, this quality, across the planet."

00:32:54.429 --> 00:33:00.509
One of the most important movements of the
past 25 years has been social entrepreneurship,

00:33:00.509 --> 00:33:05.279
and one of the most important conventions
of that movement is simply the identity category

00:33:05.279 --> 00:33:10.379
titled, "social entrepreneur," right? You
have a bunch of people around planet Earth

00:33:10.379 --> 00:33:15.850
who say, "Hey, I'm a person who dreams new
dreams for the social sector, for how the

00:33:15.850 --> 00:33:21.059
world can be better, and I put those dreams
into action. That means I'm a social entrepreneur.

00:33:21.059 --> 00:33:26.039
That means I'm in this community of people
called social entrepreneurs, right?"

00:33:26.039 --> 00:33:31.009
We need a community of people called interfaith
leaders and there needs to be enough of them

00:33:31.009 --> 00:33:37.029
in neighborhoods, and on campuses, and in
companies across the world to help make interfaith

00:33:37.029 --> 00:33:45.799
cooperation a social norm. So, here is where
I would love the help of Googlers. Why it,

00:33:45.799 --> 00:33:55.619
it, it strikes me that so much religious extremist
messaging and recruitment takes place online,

00:33:55.619 --> 00:34:01.210
right? This is where so many young people,
especially, develop their identity of religion

00:34:01.210 --> 00:34:09.030
as a barrier or as even a bomb. How do we
use the online space to send the message and

00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:13.990
build a community of religion as a force for
interfaith bridge building?

00:34:13.990 --> 00:34:17.841
That's what part of what I'd like to focus
the discussion on, but before I go on to that,

00:34:17.841 --> 00:34:26.169
I wanna leave you with, with a piece of one
of my favorite poems by Williams Stafford,

00:34:26.169 --> 00:34:33.020
a great poet of the West Coast, a native American
poet, and he says in this, in this beautiful

00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:35.040
poem called, "A Ritual to Read to Each Other,"

00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:36.049
[quotes from poem]

00:34:36.049 --> 00:34:39.049
"If you don't take the time to get to know
me

00:34:39.049 --> 00:34:44.970
And I don't take the time to get to know you
Then a pattern that others made may prevail

00:34:44.970 --> 00:34:49.849
in this world
And following the wrong God home, we could

00:34:49.849 --> 00:34:52.200
miss our star.

00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:57.809
Those who are awake must be awake now
Or else a falling line will lull us back to

00:34:57.809 --> 00:35:02.720
sleep.
The signals we give--yes or no or maybe--

00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:06.540
Must be clear now because the darkness around
us is deep."

00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:19.359
Thank you for having me at Google. I look
forward to the conversation [ ].

00:35:19.359 --> 00:35:20.359
[applause]

00:35:20.359 --> 00:35:24.870
&gt;&gt;Cliff: So, we do, we do have the, the mic
if, if people have any, any questions to,

00:35:24.870 --> 00:35:27.050
right there.

00:35:27.050 --> 00:35:28.130
[pause]

00:35:28.130 --> 00:35:37.650
I guess, I guess one, one question that I
had is, in terms of, of really making, making

00:35:37.650 --> 00:35:42.010
people aware beyond the college campus, how,
like what, what concrete steps should people

00:35:42.010 --> 00:35:44.640
take when they, you know, move to a corporate
America where--

00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:45.640
&gt;&gt;Patel: Right.

00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:48.420
&gt;&gt;Cliff: the atmosphere is, is different,
or like people in their middle age--

00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:49.420
&gt;&gt;Patel: Mm-hmm.

00:35:49.420 --> 00:35:51.970
&gt;&gt;Cliff: or senior citizens? How, how can
we continue the interfaith dialogue--

00:35:51.970 --> 00:35:52.970
&gt;&gt;Patel: Right, well--

00:35:52.970 --> 00:35:53.970
&gt;&gt;Cliff: later in years?

00:35:53.970 --> 00:35:58.299
&gt;&gt;Patel: Cliff, lemme, lemme ask, lemme, lemme
respond to that in two ways. Number one, I

00:35:58.299 --> 00:36:02.010
think one of the best ways, obviously, of
getting, spreading the message is, is through

00:36:02.010 --> 00:36:08.360
communications in media. What I would love
your advice on is what does it look like to

00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:15.520
create online platforms to this kind of civic
goal of interfaith cooperation? And one of

00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:18.710
the things that strikes me is, as I was sharing
with you at lunch is, you know, I write a

00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:24.410
blog for The Washington Post called The Faith
Divide and I write for USA Today. With some

00:36:24.410 --> 00:36:28.599
frequency in the Sunday Times of India and
I, and I write for the Huffington Post and,

00:36:28.599 --> 00:36:36.260
and the vast majority of the comments on those
articles and blogs are hateful, right?

00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:42.750
And, and they're just, I mean, there's, they
range between "Islam is evil" and "religions

00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:49.250
are fated to fight," and I, I think to myself,
"Th-, that can't be representative of the

00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:55.200
vast majority of people, right?" Because you,
you don't necessarily see that poison in direct

00:36:55.200 --> 00:37:01.670
human discourse and clearly, there are things
about the online world which make it easier

00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:06.390
because of anonymity for people to say terrible
things they might not say to somebody's face.

00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:14.490
But, how would the smartest people in the
online space think about spreading a message

00:37:14.490 --> 00:37:19.619
and creating an online community of people
who believe in interfaith cooperation, given

00:37:19.619 --> 00:37:29.720
my very real experience of people responding
to, you know, frankly, noncontroversial pieces

00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:33.700
about the importance of interfaith cooperation?
And I don't, you know, my job is not to take

00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:37.010
controversial policy stands, it's just to
hold up the idea that religion can be a bridge

00:37:37.010 --> 00:37:41.430
of cooperation and what people said about
that, like I said, it's, it's, it's unbelievable.

00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:45.780
So, that's one way of spreading this. Lemme,
lemme give a more direct answer to your question,

00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:51.350
which is you know, just like I think college
campuses are a great place to do interfaith

00:37:51.350 --> 00:37:55.210
service projects. You have 12,000 people here
at your Google campus at Mountain View, right?

00:37:55.210 --> 00:38:00.740
Do an interfaith service project amongst Googlers
and, and have it be open to people who, who

00:38:00.740 --> 00:38:05.030
are Muslim and Jewish and Evangelical and
Catholic and Hindu and Buddhist and Humanist

00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:08.780
and say, "Part of what it means to have an
interfaith service project is not just to

00:38:08.780 --> 00:38:14.950
gather the organic diversity of Google together
to, to clean rivers and tutor children, but

00:38:14.950 --> 00:38:21.079
to have an, to have a facilitated discussion.

00:38:21.079 --> 00:38:27.240
This is what we do. We train these facilitators,
have a facilitated discussion about how people's

00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:33.170
various faith identities and religious traditions
inspire them to do service. So, effectively,

00:38:33.170 --> 00:38:40.609
you're using a service project as an opportunity
to have a discussion about how religion is

00:38:40.609 --> 00:38:47.020
a bridge of cooperation, and the shared value,
and the, and the, and the pragmatic action

00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:52.731
project of serving others, right? I think
you can do that in a city. I think you can

00:38:52.731 --> 00:38:57.170
do that on a campus. I think you can do that
at Google and I hope you do.

00:38:57.170 --> 00:38:58.780
[pause]

00:38:58.780 --> 00:39:01.010
&gt;&gt;membermale1: I've read your book.

00:39:01.010 --> 00:39:02.010
&gt;&gt;Patel: Oh, thank you.

00:39:02.010 --> 00:39:06.860
&gt;&gt;membermale1: And, in fact, a whole group
of people through my church read it. We've

00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:11.760
read it; we have an ongoing discussion group
called, "God's Politics," inspired--

00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:12.859
&gt;&gt;Patel: Ahh.

00:39:12.859 --> 00:39:14.510
&gt;&gt;membermale1: by Jim--

00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:15.609
&gt;&gt;Patel: Wallis.

00:39:15.609 --> 00:39:18.799
&gt;&gt;membermale1: Jim Wallis and Sojourners.
And I grew up in the Midwest, so I relate

00:39:18.799 --> 00:39:26.930
somewhat to your, the, the book says, about,
I grew up in a much more nondiverse community;

00:39:26.930 --> 00:39:32.940
a little town. One of the things I see that
with my son's generation is that they are

00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:34.690
seeing religion as a very divisive issue --

00:39:34.690 --> 00:39:35.690
&gt;&gt;Patel: Yeah.

00:39:35.690 --> 00:39:39.140
&gt;&gt;membermale1: And they say, "Heck with it.
All it does is make people angry. All it does

00:39:39.140 --> 00:39:43.799
is make people fight. All it does is kill
people, so I don't wanna have anything to

00:39:43.799 --> 00:39:48.670
do with it." And so, to bring up anything
about religion, even my boys who went to church,

00:39:48.670 --> 00:39:58.220
but don't want to now, is, is divisive to
even mention that idea. So, I'm, I'm not sure

00:39:58.220 --> 00:40:05.450
it's the big atheist movements, like Richard
Dawkins and the people who are so strong against

00:40:05.450 --> 00:40:11.640
religion are the problem, but the people who
are just sort of seeing religion as not a

00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:14.770
force for "good", but a force for--

00:40:14.770 --> 00:40:15.950
&gt;&gt;Patel: Right, right.

00:40:15.950 --> 00:40:16.950
&gt;&gt;membermale1: for destruction.

00:40:16.950 --> 00:40:21.390
&gt;&gt;Patel: Right. So, thank, thank you for that,
that comment. You know, I, I actually have

00:40:21.390 --> 00:40:25.700
many more "B's" than before that I listed,
you know. So, I listed religion as a bubble,

00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:29.829
as a barrier, as a bomb, and as a bridge.
I think the fourth one, and an increasingly

00:40:29.829 --> 00:40:33.670
prevalent one, is religion as blasé, right?
I-, people who just don't wanna have anything

00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:40.190
to do with it and I think that that is one
of the consequences of, of religious violence

00:40:40.190 --> 00:40:45.779
playing out in the evening news, and it's
one of the consequences of people from other

00:40:45.779 --> 00:40:48.619
faiths denouncing people of different faiths.

00:40:48.619 --> 00:40:54.210
And I think that in a way, any of us who are
religious, or anybody who has a friend who's

00:40:54.210 --> 00:41:01.079
religious, right? Who ha-, is, has an appreciation
of tha-, of, of how precious that identity

00:41:01.079 --> 00:41:10.000
is to that friend, to say, "Gosh, you know,
it's, it's wrong and damaging and false to

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:15.750
only have the story of religion as poison
and violence out there." You would not have

00:41:15.750 --> 00:41:20.599
had a civil rights movement if you didn't
have the religious inspiration. It's the power

00:41:20.599 --> 00:41:21.690
of the Montgomery Bus Boycott.

00:41:21.690 --> 00:41:28.240
They met in churches, they sang, they sang
gospel songs together, they called it a movement

00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:35.260
of Christian Love. King said Jenu-, Jesus
first the inspiration and Gandhi, a religious

00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:41.140
Hindu, gave us the message. I saw Nelson Mandela
speak in Cape Town in 1999, and he said, "I

00:41:41.140 --> 00:41:48.059
would not be standing here today if it wasn't
for Christians and Muslims and Hindus and

00:41:48.059 --> 00:41:54.150
Jews and Traditionalists in Africa coming
together to build a struggle against apartheid."

00:41:54.150 --> 00:42:02.890
Right? So, I just think it is, it is a terribly
sad thing if this generation passes on to

00:42:02.890 --> 00:42:08.520
the next generation that religion can only
poison things and therefore, you shouldn't

00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:16.200
touch it at all. What we ought to be passing
on is religion can be a real force for "good",

00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:19.010
but you have to make it a force for "good."
Right?

00:42:19.010 --> 00:42:22.690
And in order for you to make it a force for
"good," you can't forfeit it into the hands

00:42:22.690 --> 00:42:27.359
of bad people. That's a big part of the message
of the Interfaith Youth Corps, is to, is to

00:42:27.359 --> 00:42:32.680
lift up that message and to empower young
people who ba-, wanna believe in religion

00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:37.510
as a force for "good" in their own lives,
in history, in the lives of their friends,

00:42:37.510 --> 00:42:38.970
to make it so. Thank you.

00:42:38.970 --> 00:42:43.099
&gt;&gt;memberfemale2: So, there have been recent
talks about building a mosque at Ground Zero

00:42:43.099 --> 00:42:44.099
in New York,--

00:42:44.099 --> 00:42:45.099
&gt;&gt;Patel: Mm-hmm

00:42:45.099 --> 00:43:02.270
&gt;&gt;memberfemale2: and I read in the news that
there have been protests, where people have

00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:09.772
essentially gone with signs that say stuff
like, "Building a mosque at Ground Zero spits

00:43:09.772 --> 00:43:10.772
on the graves of 9/11 victims." So, to that
end, what do you think the residents of New

00:43:10.772 --> 00:43:11.772
York could do--

00:43:11.772 --> 00:43:12.772
&gt;&gt;Patel: Right.

00:43:12.772 --> 00:43:13.772
&gt;&gt;memberfemale2: to build bridges?

00:43:13.772 --> 00:43:15.160
&gt;&gt;Patel: Right. I think, so I think that's
a great question, so lemme, lemme offer a

00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:22.660
story and then platform off that story into
a more direct response to this. So, when Keith

00:43:22.660 --> 00:43:27.289
Ellison, who's a friend of mine and the first
Muslim to get elected into Congress in American

00:43:27.289 --> 00:43:33.970
history, from the fifth district in Minnesota
representing Minneapolis, when people started

00:43:33.970 --> 00:43:40.760
to, when some people said, "We shouldn't have
a Muslim in Congress and we definitely shouldn't

00:43:40.760 --> 00:43:42.950
let him take his oath of office on the Koran,"

00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:49.700
Keith Ellison's response was to walk across
the street to the Library of Congress and

00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:55.990
to request the Koran reverently owned by The
Honorable Thomas Jefferson, and to take his

00:43:55.990 --> 00:44:03.230
oath of office on that Koran, right? And the
message he was sending is that religious diversity

00:44:03.230 --> 00:44:09.359
and interfaith cooperation was part of the
founding ideals of this country. And by suggesting

00:44:09.359 --> 00:44:12.460
that there shouldn't be a Muslim elected to
Congress, or that "I shouldn't take my oath

00:44:12.460 --> 00:44:17.270
of office on the Koran," is actually violating
a core American value.

00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:24.520
So, I don't want to call you just an Islamaphobe,
I wanna call you somebody who is advancing

00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:32.089
a message that's anti-American, right? You
know, George Washington carried out a correspondence

00:44:32.089 --> 00:44:37.310
with the Hebrew congregation of Newport, Rhode
Island, and this, this, this Jewish leader

00:44:37.310 --> 00:44:45.150
sent him a letter saying, "In this new country
called America, are my people safe here?"

00:44:45.150 --> 00:44:52.049
And Washington says, "This nation will give
bigotry no sanction." Right? That's as American

00:44:52.049 --> 00:44:59.069
an ethic as you have, that, that diversity
oughtta flourish and oughtta become cooperation.

00:44:59.069 --> 00:45:04.289
And I think that that's the message that not
just the Muslims of New York, but that the

00:45:04.289 --> 00:45:08.540
people of New York oughtta bring to the people
who are violating that message. That you're

00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:14.619
being a-, by, by saying that a group of people
cannot build a house of prayer here, you're

00:45:14.619 --> 00:45:19.450
violating the ethic of Washington, you're
violating the ethic of Jefferson, you're violating

00:45:19.450 --> 00:45:27.180
the eth-, ethic of Madison, Franklin, and
those people who built this nation. And you

00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:30.490
don't know anything about Islam, but that's
point number two.

00:45:30.490 --> 00:45:35.329
&gt;&gt;memberfemale2: Thanks.

00:45:35.329 --> 00:45:37.750
[pause]

00:45:37.750 --> 00:45:42.579
{background chatter]

00:45:42.579 --> 00:45:48.140
&gt;&gt;Patel: I'm at Google; I have all the time
in the world.

00:45:48.140 --> 00:45:49.140
[laughter]

00:45:49.140 --> 00:45:57.660
&gt;&gt;membermale3: One, one of the big concerns
that I have about, I'm sorry. Most religions

00:45:57.660 --> 00:46:01.789
have their core in exclusivism. I've read
the Bible, I haven't read the Koran, but I've

00:46:01.789 --> 00:46:07.510
read other religious writings and so many
of them have, at least as part of it, saying,

00:46:07.510 --> 00:46:10.300
"We are the good people, everybody else is
the bad people." Maybe they said that 2,000

00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:18.170
years ago, but in Islam, I don't know, but
in the Bible, clearly it says in parts of

00:46:18.170 --> 00:46:22.900
Genesis, "kill all the people who aren't,
aren't Jews." And people use that all the

00:46:22.900 --> 00:46:31.080
time. How do we get be-, my own religious
group is Lutheranism and there's a group of

00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:33.740
Lutherans who refuse to have anything to do--

00:46:33.740 --> 00:46:34.740
&gt;&gt;Patel: Mm-hmm.

00:46:34.740 --> 00:46:38.539
&gt;&gt;membermale3: with people who are not their
particular brand of Lutherans because even

00:46:38.539 --> 00:46:42.460
working with them together is a sign that
somehow they're--

00:46:42.460 --> 00:46:43.460
[Patel clears throat]

00:46:43.460 --> 00:46:44.680
sanctioning somebody else's belief as being--

00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:45.680
&gt;&gt;Patel: Mm-hmm.

00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:49.869
&gt;&gt;membermale3: valid. And how do you, how
does one get to people who--

00:46:49.869 --> 00:46:50.869
&gt;&gt;Patel: Mm-hmm.

00:46:50.869 --> 00:46:56.760
&gt;&gt;membermake3: have that mindset that, "I'm
right and everybody else is wrong?" There,

00:46:56.760 --> 00:46:58.039
there jokes about it, of course--

00:46:58.039 --> 00:46:59.039
&gt;&gt;Patel: Right.

00:46:59.039 --> 00:47:00.450
&gt;&gt;membermale3: but it's serious and I think--

00:47:00.450 --> 00:47:01.450
&gt;&gt;Patel: Mm-hmm.

00:47:01.450 --> 00:47:02.829
&gt;&gt;membermale3: I think it's so easy for people
to fall into, how do you--

00:47:02.829 --> 00:47:03.829
&gt;&gt;Patel: Right.

00:47:03.829 --> 00:47:06.790
&gt;&gt;membermale3: how do you start opening up
dialogue with people who start from there?

00:47:06.790 --> 00:47:15.809
&gt;&gt;Patel: Right. So, lemme, lemme tell you
a story. It's a great story about a Christian

00:47:15.809 --> 00:47:24.650
pastor who is sta-, American, who is stationed
in Europe during World War II, and his congregation

00:47:24.650 --> 00:47:29.760
sends him money so that he can make the voyage
back to America to spend Christmas with his

00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:32.210
family and his, his church community.

00:47:32.210 --> 00:47:40.680
And he uses that money to help a group of
Jews flee from Hitler's fires into safety.

00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:46.390
And one of his congregants writes and says,
"But they weren't even Christian." And he

00:47:46.390 --> 00:47:54.829
writes back and says, "Yes, but I am." Right?
And what strikes me about that is, is here

00:47:54.829 --> 00:48:01.680
is somebody who says at the heart of my faith
is standing up for people from a different

00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:02.680
faith.

00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:09.410
And you know what? That's a theology. That's
not just that guy was a nice guy. That's the

00:48:09.410 --> 00:48:16.529
Good Samaritan story, right? That's Jesus
reaching out to the marginalized and so, where

00:48:16.529 --> 00:48:23.839
I would begin is not so much arguing point-counterpoint
with people who have what I would call a "theology

00:48:23.839 --> 00:48:30.670
of separation" or a "theology of domination",
I would just lift up the theology of interfaith

00:48:30.670 --> 00:48:35.349
cooperation. And I would say, "Look, there
are parts of the Cription-, of the Christian

00:48:35.349 --> 00:48:43.210
scripture and moments of Christian history
that clearly sacrilize, make holy, cooperating

00:48:43.210 --> 00:48:44.680
with people from different religions."

00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:50.420
Those are the parts that I, I relate to and
want to make real. That's not to say that

00:48:50.420 --> 00:48:55.400
there aren't other parts, but you know, the
Bible is a big book, you know? Muslim history

00:48:55.400 --> 00:49:03.099
is 1,400 years long, right? There are clearly
contradictory dimensions to, to both scripture

00:49:03.099 --> 00:49:08.760
and to the history of a religious tradition.
And at the end of the day, adherents of different

00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:13.589
traditions, whether its Hinduism or Humanism,
choose which parts of that tradition that

00:49:13.589 --> 00:49:17.210
they're gonna emphasize, that they're gonna
be inspired by, right?

00:49:17.210 --> 00:49:23.740
Khaled Abou Al-Fadl, great Muslim theologian,
Usma was talking about earlier actually, you

00:49:23.740 --> 00:49:27.779
know, he writes a beautiful essay on this
called, "The Place of Tolerance in Islam."

00:49:27.779 --> 00:49:33.490
Where he says, you know, here are the scriptures,
here are, here are the parts of Muslim scripture

00:49:33.490 --> 00:49:38.470
and the places in Muslim history that emphasize
domination, right? And then he says, here

00:49:38.470 --> 00:49:43.130
are the parts of scripture and the places
in Muslim history which emphasize cooperation,

00:49:43.130 --> 00:49:47.230
right? And then he says, so how do you choose
which one is more important? And he goes through,

00:49:47.230 --> 00:49:54.690
you know, a set of kind of, more technical,
theological approaches which say, you know,

00:49:54.690 --> 00:49:59.420
there are certain verses which are, you know,
de-emphasized for his-, because they're historically

00:49:59.420 --> 00:50:05.280
bounded in other verses which are considered
eternal, etc., but then at the end of the

00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:07.162
essay, he says something that so powerful
to me.

00:50:07.162 --> 00:50:13.420
He says, "You know what, at the end of the
day, the Koran will morally enrich the reader

00:50:13.420 --> 00:50:19.240
to the extent that the reader morally enriches
the Koran." Right? At the end of the day,

00:50:19.240 --> 00:50:25.289
God has written kindness in the human heart
and the human heart is meant to approach a

00:50:25.289 --> 00:50:29.420
religious tradition in the spirit of kindness.
That's what Khaled Abou Al-Fadl is saying.

00:50:29.420 --> 00:50:31.170
He says, "That's Muslim theology." Right?

00:50:31.170 --> 00:50:38.529
It comes from surah two of the Holy Koran,
in which God says he created Muslims, he created

00:50:38.529 --> 00:50:43.670
humankind as his "abden halifa", his servant
and representative on Earth. God gave us his

00:50:43.670 --> 00:50:50.539
breath, his rule: we tend towards the good,
as the Muslim tradition says, and we act on

00:50:50.539 --> 00:50:55.400
those dimensions that we consider "good" in
the scripture and in the tradition, right?

00:50:55.400 --> 00:51:04.289
So, I, I don't wanna get into, you know, a
theological like, you know, sword wielding

00:51:04.289 --> 00:51:10.349
match with people who have a theology of domination.
I would much rather lift up and make salient

00:51:10.349 --> 00:51:15.589
a theology of interfaith cooperation and,
and say to people around the world, most of

00:51:15.589 --> 00:51:20.940
whom are good, right? I share that belief
with, with Google that people are good. The

00:51:20.940 --> 00:51:25.809
more you lift up that positive theology, the
more people will, will relate to it. And,

00:51:25.809 --> 00:51:30.210
and I think that, you know, to be a little
bit sharp about this, I think we have failed

00:51:30.210 --> 00:51:31.940
to do that, right?

00:51:31.940 --> 00:51:38.730
And I'm always struck that people who believe
in, in, in, in the bubble, the barrier, or

00:51:38.730 --> 00:51:43.980
the bomb, they can quote chapter and verse
on why they believe that. Bang, bang, bang.

00:51:43.980 --> 00:51:48.930
They have it on the tip of their tongue, but
those of us who believe in the bridge we don't

00:51:48.930 --> 00:51:53.440
really, we can't really cite, you know, surah
49 of the Holy Koran says, "God made us different

00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:57.099
nations and tribes that we may come to know
one another." Right?

00:51:57.099 --> 00:52:03.589
From, from the Constitution of Medina, right,
where the prophet Muhammad made the peace

00:52:03.589 --> 00:52:10.250
and blessings of God be upon him, created
a framework where people from different religious

00:52:10.250 --> 00:52:16.359
backgrounds would come together in one city
in Medina through the great Muslim empires

00:52:16.359 --> 00:52:21.720
of Cordoba, and the Fatimids, and Bagdad through
Akbar and the Ottomans, through what Rwandan

00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:27.369
Muslims did in the genocide, you know? The
Muslim communities have often built partnerships

00:52:27.369 --> 00:52:31.029
and, in fact, stood up for people who are
different from them.

00:52:31.029 --> 00:52:35.059
That's what I wanna act on, right? And it's
the same in Judaism, it's the same in, in

00:52:35.059 --> 00:52:40.400
Christianity, it's the same in Hinduism, it's
the same in Humanism. Lifting that up, teaching

00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:46.290
that theology, I think that, that that oughtta
be a high priority.

00:52:46.290 --> 00:52:47.290
[pause]

00:52:47.290 --> 00:52:57.170
&gt;&gt;memberfemale4: Hi. I just wanna say thanks.
Great subject and a good discussion to have.

00:52:57.170 --> 00:53:02.920
I was a member of an interfaith group in college,
so I want to thank you for supporting the

00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:08.100
movement, but one problem we had, or that
I observed in our small group, was we had

00:53:08.100 --> 00:53:11.401
a lot of people from different faiths, but
we didn't have anyone like you said from the

00:53:11.401 --> 00:53:18.299
humanist movement or people without a religiously
defined faith. So, how do we make sure that

00:53:18.299 --> 00:53:22.619
we reach out to those groups who don't necessarily
have a religion and make sure they're not

00:53:22.619 --> 00:53:24.470
turned off by the mention of faith?

00:53:24.470 --> 00:53:28.980
&gt;&gt;Patel: Yeah. I think that's a great question,
thank you for that. So, I, I think part of

00:53:28.980 --> 00:53:35.220
it is language and, and you know, I've gotten
better at this and so I, I include humanism.

00:53:35.220 --> 00:53:39.170
It's not a religious tradition, but it is
indeed a tradition, right? And it's a tradition

00:53:39.170 --> 00:53:45.539
that has, has books and heroes and, and inspiration
for people to cooperate and serve. So, just

00:53:45.539 --> 00:53:51.610
including that in our language I think is
important. There are leaders of the humanist

00:53:51.610 --> 00:53:55.190
movement, like my friend Greg Epstein, who's
the Humanist Chaplain at Harvard, who you

00:53:55.190 --> 00:53:59.529
oughtta invite to speak here, who has written
a book called, "Good Without God," where he

00:53:59.529 --> 00:54:05.619
talks about how Humanists ought to be involved
in interfaith cooperation and interfaith service.

00:54:05.619 --> 00:54:11.359
And so, use of language is important, issuing
the invitation to Humanists is important,

00:54:11.359 --> 00:54:16.150
and finding the leaders of the Humanist Movement
who are pushing interfaith cooperation as

00:54:16.150 --> 00:54:19.631
a priority; those are three ways to do that.
Thank you.

00:54:19.631 --> 00:54:22.950
[pause]

00:54:22.950 --> 00:54:28.690
Nobody's giving me advice on how to build
an interfaith movement online!

00:54:28.690 --> 00:54:29.690

be problem solvers?

00:54:34.700 --> 00:54:35.799

thing and I, I don't want, I hope by the name

00:54:35.799 --> 00:54:36.799
it doesn't sound like, degrading. I don't
know too much about it, but I'm in engineering

00:54:36.799 --> 00:54:37.799
department and someone that I don't work directly
with, but is also in that department recently

00:54:37.799 --> 00:54:42.780
went to a fairly major conference in New York
called, I don't know what it was called, but

00:54:42.780 --> 00:54:51.190
it was regarding something called "Serious
Games", and he mentioned that with these things

00:54:51.190 --> 00:54:59.600
called serious games, which are somewhat like
education games, but less, the education is

00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:08.000
less directly in your face. It's a little
more appealing, I guess, to kids--

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:09.210
&gt;&gt;Patel: Yeah.

00:55:09.210 --> 00:55:16.180
&gt;&gt;memberfemale5: a little more playing than,
you know, kind of a fake set up and they say

00:55:16.180 --> 00:55:18.890
this is a game but it's actually a math problem,
right? But he, he mentioned that there's people,

00:55:18.890 --> 00:55:24.339
you know, from all different subjects and
movements and a lot of social activists and

00:55:24.339 --> 00:55:34.930
different things doing, with ideas in the
realm of, of, of what they're calling serious

00:55:34.930 --> 00:55:36.799
games and I don't, I don't build platforms,
but that's just something that struck me as

00:55:36.799 --> 00:55:37.799
you were talking and I, I've been trying to
think for the last five minutes of the name

00:55:37.799 --> 00:55:45.030
of, I've forgotten it, but it's something
in the serious games that took place, I think

00:55:45.030 --> 00:55:53.840
largely in the San Francisco Bay area, but
with environmentalism in which people, I don't

00:55:53.840 --> 00:56:01.760
know, I watched a YouTube video on it, but
they, they pretty much, it was like a real

00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:10.829
life game and they took, they took, they pretty
much videotaped themselves, put it on YouTube

00:56:10.829 --> 00:56:11.941
through the game, I can't remember the name
of.

00:56:11.941 --> 00:56:13.220
When they were, you know, of different actions
they were taking to help the environment and

00:56:13.220 --> 00:56:16.040
it was kind of made into a game with people
across the city playing this game for environmentalism.

00:56:16.040 --> 00:56:17.040
I don't know, I'd have to be--

00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:26.579
&gt;&gt;Patel: I, I love that, I mean this is, that's
actually exactly the kind of, the kind of

00:56:26.579 --> 00:56:32.119
advice I'm looking for is, is part of what
you have to do in, in the online space is

00:56:32.119 --> 00:56:37.060
things like, figure out where young people
already are and how you can weave messages

00:56:37.060 --> 00:56:41.250
like interfaith cooperation into things that
they're already involved with. So, it, I love

00:56:41.250 --> 00:56:45.140
to hear that environmentalism is being woven
into games and I think you could do the same

00:56:45.140 --> 00:56:46.140
with interfaith cooperation.

00:56:46.140 --> 00:56:47.140
&gt;&gt;memberfemale5: Right.

00:56:47.140 --> 00:56:51.240
&gt;&gt;Patel: Right, like, so, so you could be
an interfaith leader online and, and kind

00:56:51.240 --> 00:56:56.200
of mimic talking to the leader of a synagogue
about how to get their synagogue involved

00:56:56.200 --> 00:56:59.960
in an interfaith project, right? I mean, that,
that could be an online kind of interaction,

00:56:59.960 --> 00:57:00.960
so--

00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:01.960
&gt;&gt;memberfemale5: Right.

00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:02.960
&gt;&gt;Patel: Thank you for that. It's a great,
great suggestion.

00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:06.000
&gt;&gt;memberfemale5: Sure. So, yeah, it's called
Serious Games and there's some other, some

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:10.500
other things related, but that's the name
that jumps out at me. The other thing is that

00:57:10.500 --> 00:57:15.789
I'm here for the year, but really I'm a, I'm
a teacher most of the time and I was just

00:57:15.789 --> 00:57:20.950
wondering what, what kind of things are being
done through your organization or other similar

00:57:20.950 --> 00:57:26.830
ones, like more at the high school level.
Because, I mean, you can keep going down forever,

00:57:26.830 --> 00:57:27.830
but--

00:57:27.830 --> 00:57:28.830
&gt;&gt;Patel: Yeah, yeah.

00:57:28.830 --> 00:57:32.020
&gt;&gt;memberfemale5: I know that high school students
do go on to…

00:57:32.020 --> 00:57:33.020
&gt;&gt;Patel: Yeah.

00:57:33.020 --> 00:57:37.200
&gt;&gt;memberfemale5: college, and I know high
school students who have started groups based

00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:38.490
on race and things, things like that, so I,
are there things being done at high schools?

00:57:38.490 --> 00:57:42.339
&gt;&gt;Patel: Yeah. So, so, we don't do a ton of
direct work with high schools. I mean, occasionally,

00:57:42.339 --> 00:57:46.769
I'll be asked to like, be the Martin Luther
King Jr. Day speaker at a school and, you

00:57:46.769 --> 00:57:49.589
know, I, I'll do it if I can, I, but I clearly
enjoy that stuff.

00:57:49.589 --> 00:57:50.589
&gt;&gt;memberfemale5: Mm-hmm.

00:57:50.589 --> 00:57:54.289
&gt;&gt;Patel: Not afraid of the microphone, as
you can see.

00:57:54.289 --> 00:57:55.289
[laughter]

00:57:55.289 --> 00:57:58.670
But part of building a movement, a part of
a movement is that different organizations

00:57:58.670 --> 00:58:03.640
emerge and kind of drive different dimensions
of work, and so I think there, there should

00:58:03.640 --> 00:58:07.410
be national and international level org-,
interfaith organizations that focus on high

00:58:07.410 --> 00:58:11.650
schools. And at the end of the day, you know,
our hope, the wonderful thing about college

00:58:11.650 --> 00:58:15.519
students is that they become college graduates
and then they go off and they take their message

00:58:15.519 --> 00:58:21.259
and knowledge base and skill set into whatever
they do. And hopefully, a lot of them become

00:58:21.259 --> 00:58:22.259
high school teachers.

00:58:22.259 --> 00:58:23.259
&gt;&gt;memberfemale5: Haha. Ok.

00:58:23.259 --> 00:58:24.259
&gt;&gt;Patel: Cool.

00:58:24.259 --> 00:58:25.259
&gt;&gt;memberfemale5: Ok, and maybe the last one,
this is something that we're currently having

00:58:25.259 --> 00:58:28.250
a lot of trouble with our work on, because
we're doing things education, but other than

00:58:28.250 --> 00:58:36.849
online, just like, if there's any way to get
it into curriculum, you know--

00:58:36.849 --> 00:58:37.849
&gt;&gt;Patel: Yeah.

00:58:37.849 --> 00:58:39.130
&gt;&gt;memberfemale5: I mean, then you, you hit
into--

00:58:39.130 --> 00:58:40.130
&gt;&gt;Patel: Yeah, yeah.

00:58:40.130 --> 00:58:41.630
&gt;&gt;memberfemale5: that's kind of like the thought
process--

00:58:41.630 --> 00:58:42.630
&gt;&gt;Patel: Yeah.

00:58:42.630 --> 00:58:43.630
&gt;&gt;memberfemale5: that's difficult to change.

00:58:43.630 --> 00:58:45.490
&gt;&gt;Patel: You know, we do that at the college
level, you know--

00:58:45.490 --> 00:58:46.490
&gt;&gt;memberfemale5: Right, right.

00:58:46.490 --> 00:58:50.329
&gt;&gt;Patel: like, we help faculty shape new courses
in interfaith cooperation. I just finished

00:58:50.329 --> 00:58:53.839
teaching a course at Northwestern University
called Interfaith Leadership, and we're trying

00:58:53.839 --> 00:59:01.440
to spread that course, so, and then again,
we hope the theory of change is that campuses

00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:06.530
serve as a vanguard sector and as they teach
courses in interfaith cooperation, high schools

00:59:06.530 --> 00:59:07.710
start to do that.

00:59:07.710 --> 00:59:09.930
&gt;&gt;memberfemale5: Right, right, true. Thank
you very much.

00:59:09.930 --> 00:59:12.720
&gt;&gt;Patel: Thank you. Thanks for having me,
again. Thank you so much.

00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:13.000
[applause]
