00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:03.620
The goal of this video is to
explore some of the concepts,

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.590
or formulas you might see in
a traditional physics class.

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:09.460
But even more importantly to see
that they're really just common

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.540
sense ideas.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.000
So let's just start
with a simple example.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.100
Let's say that-- and for
the sake of this video

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.947
just so I don't
have to keep saying

00:00:17.947 --> 00:00:19.530
this is the magnitude
of the velocity,

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.029
this is the direction of the
velocity, et cetera, et cetera.

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:24.870
Let's just assume that if I
have a positive number that it

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.580
means, for example, if I
have a positive velocity,

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.994
it means that I am
going to the right.

00:00:29.994 --> 00:00:32.369
And let's say if I have a
negative number, which we won't

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.987
see in this video, let's assume
that I'm going to the left.

00:00:34.987 --> 00:00:36.820
And that way I can just
write a number down,

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.700
are we're only operating
in one dimension.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.158
You know that it
is specifying what

00:00:40.158 --> 00:00:41.720
the magnitude and
the direction is.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.072
If I said the velocity is
five meters per second,

00:00:44.072 --> 00:00:46.030
that means five meters
per second to the right.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.120
If I say it's negative
five meters per second,

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.480
that means it's five meters
per second to the left.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.220
Now let's just say
just for simplicity,

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.430
let's just say we start
with an initial velocity,

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.317
of five meters per second.

00:00:59.317 --> 00:01:01.400
And once again, I am
specifying both the magnitude

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.150
and the direction.

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.370
Because of this convention here,
we know it is to the right.

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.050
And let's say that we have
a constant acceleration.

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.010
We have a constant
acceleration at play

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.310
of two meters per
second, per second,

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.730
or two meters per
second squared.

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.470
And once again, since this is
positive, it is to the right.

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.340
And let's say that we
do this for a duration.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.810
So my change in
time is- let's say

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:31.560
we do this for a duration
of four-- I'll just use s.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.520
So I don't use seconds
and then sec, and then

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:34.580
s in different places.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.150
So s for this video is seconds.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.170
So I want to do is think
about how far do we travel.

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.860
Well there's two things.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.320
How fast are we going
after four seconds,

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.490
and how far have we traveled
over the course of those four

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.610
seconds.

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.960
So let's draw ourselves a
little bit of a diagram here.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.840
So this is my velocity axis and
this over here is my time axis.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.490
I can draw a straighter
line than that.

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.010
So that is my time axis.

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.940
This is velocity.

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.250
That is my velocity
right over there.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.890
And I'm starting off at
five meters per second.

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.820
So this is five meters per
second right over here.

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.650
So v i is equal to
five meters per second.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.530
And then every second
that goes by, I'm

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.380
going two meters
per second faster.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.060
Because it's two meters
per second, per second.

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.710
So every second that goes
by-- so after one second,

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:35.740
I'm going to go two
meters per second faster.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:36.876
So I'll be at seven.

00:02:36.876 --> 00:02:38.250
Or another way to
think about it,

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.080
is the slope of
this velocity line

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.645
is my constant acceleration.

00:02:42.645 --> 00:02:44.310
Or I have a constant slope here.

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.440
So it might look something
look something like that.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.290
So what has happened
after four seconds?

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.860
So one, two, three, four.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.470
So this is my delta t.

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.380
So my final velocity is
going to be right over there.

00:03:02.112 --> 00:03:03.820
I'll write it down
here just because it's

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.080
getting in the way of
this word velocity.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.830
And so this is v. This
is my final velocity.

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:11.150
And what would it be?

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.690
Well I'm starting at
five meters per second.

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.780
So I'm going to do it
both, using the variables,

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.800
and using the concrete numbers.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.940
So starting at some
initial velocity.

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.750
The subscript i
says i for initial.

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.720
And then each second
that goes by, I'm

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.830
getting this much faster.

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.470
So if I want to see how
much faster have I gone,

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.640
I multiply the
number of seconds--

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.180
I'll just multiply the
number of seconds that go by,

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.265
times my acceleration.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.800
And once again, this
right here, I just

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.400
wrote the subscript
c saying that it's

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.120
a constant acceleration.

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.650
And so that will tell
me how fast I've gone.

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.310
If I start at this
point, and I multiply

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.950
the duration times my
slope, I will get this high.

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:58.475
I will get to my final velocity.

00:04:01.365 --> 00:04:03.455
And just to make it
clear with the numbers,

00:04:03.455 --> 00:04:05.080
these numbers really
could be anything,

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.990
I'm just picking these to
make it concrete in your mind.

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:12.330
You have five meters per
second, plus four seconds,

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.760
plus-- I want to
do that in yellow--

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.680
plus four seconds times
our acceleration of two

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.500
meters per second squared.

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.814
And what is this
going to be equal to?

00:04:26.814 --> 00:04:29.230
You have the seconds canceling
out with one of the seconds

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.450
down here.

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:32.640
So let me write it.

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.210
So we have five
meters per second,

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:40.100
plus four times two is eight.

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.996
This second's gone.

00:04:40.996 --> 00:04:42.620
We're just left with
meters per second.

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.580
Eight meters per second.

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:49.490
Or this is the same thing as
13 meters per second, which

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.837
is going to be our
final velocity.

00:04:51.837 --> 00:04:53.170
And I want to take a pause here.

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:54.961
And you can pause and
think about yourself.

00:04:54.961 --> 00:04:56.710
This hopefully
should be intuitive.

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.780
We were starting at going
five meters per second.

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.590
Every second that
goes by we're going

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.920
to go two meters
per second faster.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.630
So after one second we will
be at seven meters per second.

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:09.870
After two seconds we will be
at nine meters per second.

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:14.142
After three seconds we will
be 11 meters per second.

00:05:14.142 --> 00:05:15.600
And then after four
seconds we will

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.420
be at 13 meters per second.

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:20.220
So you multiply how much time
passed times acceleration.

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.460
This is how much faster,
we're going to be going.

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.520
If we're already going
five meters per second.

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.220
Five plus how much faster?

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:28.250
13 meters per second.

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:34.150
So this right up here
is 13 meters per second.

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.840
So, I'll take a
little pause here.

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.340
Hopefully that's intuitive.

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.090
And the whole point
of that is to show you

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.867
that this formula that you'll
often see in many physics

00:05:42.867 --> 00:05:45.200
books-- It's not just something
that randomly popped out

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.330
of the air-- it just makes
complete common sense.

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.190
Now the next thing
I want to talk about

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:54.250
is what is the total distance
that we would have traveled.

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.630
Now we know from the last
video that distance is just

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:59.970
the area under this
curve right over here.

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:03.440
So it's just the area
under this curve.

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.870
You say wait, this is kind of
a strange shape right here.

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:07.540
How do I calculate its area?

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:09.470
And we can just use a
little simple geometry

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:11.790
to break it down into
two different areas, that

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:14.740
are very easy to
calculate their areas.

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:16.000
Or two simple shapes.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.950
You can break it down into
this blue part, this rectangle

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:20.510
right over here.

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:22.670
Easy to figure out the
area of a rectangle.

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:25.030
And we could break it down
into this purple part.

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:26.490
This triangle right here.

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:28.920
Easy to figure out the
area of a triangle.

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:30.890
And that will be the
total distance we travel.

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:33.330
And even this will hopefully
make some intuition.

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:36.000
Because this blue
area is how far would

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.470
we have traveled if we
were not accelerating.

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:42.330
If we just went five meters
per second, for four seconds.

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.192
So if you go five meters
per second times--

00:06:44.192 --> 00:06:46.400
so this is one second, two
second, three second, four

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.320
second.

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:51.020
So you're going from
times zero to time four,

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:54.020
your change in time
is four seconds.

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:57.330
So if you go five meters per
second, for four seconds,

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:59.610
you're going to go 20 meters.

00:06:59.610 --> 00:07:02.360
This right here is 20 meters.

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.040
That is the area
of this right here.

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.840
Five times four.

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:09.750
This purple or
magenta area tells you

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:12.040
how further than
this, are you going,

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:14.050
because you are
accelerating, because you

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:16.840
kept going faster and
faster and faster.

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:19.400
And it's pretty easy
to calculate this area.

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:22.850
The base here is still
five, because that's

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:24.090
five seconds have gone by.

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:25.750
And what's the height here?

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:28.740
The height here is
my final velocity

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:30.275
minus my initial velocity.

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:38.240
Or it's the change in velocity
due to the acceleration.

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:40.860
And the change in velocity
due to the acceleration.

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:43.200
13 minus five is eight.

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:44.810
Or it's this 8 right over here.

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:48.300
It is eight meters per second.

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:51.290
So this height right over here
is eight meters per second.

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:54.720
The base right over
here is four seconds.

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:56.320
That's the time that past.

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:59.230
So what's the area
of this triangle?

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:02.760
Area of a triangle is
one half, times the base,

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:07.000
which is four seconds,
times the height, which

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.570
is eight meters per second.

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:11.940
Seconds cancel out.

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:14.540
One half times four
is two, times eight

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:21.130
is equal to 16 meters.

00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:24.850
So the total distance we
traveled is 20 plus 16,

00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:27.090
is 36 meters.

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:30.250
That is the total, or I could
say the total displacement,

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:33.010
and once again, it's to the
right, since it is positive.

00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:35.590
So this is our displacement.

00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:38.054
Now what I want to do is do
this exact same calculation,

00:08:38.054 --> 00:08:39.720
but keep it in variable
form and that'll

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:42.500
give another formula that many
people, many often memorize.

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:44.000
But I want you to
understand it it's

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.100
a completely intuitive
formula, and it just

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:49.400
comes out of the logical
flow of reasoning

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:51.410
that we went through
in this video.

00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:52.670
What is the area?

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:56.320
Once again, if we just
think about the variables.

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:58.790
Well, the area of
this rectangle right

00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:03.100
here is our initial velocity,
times our change in time.

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:11.460
So this is the blue
rectangle right over here.

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:13.770
And then plus-- what
do we have to do--

00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:15.960
we have the change
in time, once again,

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:19.730
we have the change in
time, times this height.

00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:22.560
Which is our final velocity.

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:24.220
Which is times
our final velocity

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:28.160
minus our initial velocity.

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:29.822
These are all vectors.

00:09:29.822 --> 00:09:32.280
They're just positive, telling
us we're going to the right.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.340
And we don't just multiply
the base times the height.

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:36.270
That would give us the area
of this entire rectangle.

00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:38.690
We have to take it by half
because a triangle is only half

00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:40.020
of that rectangle.

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:41.280
So times one half.

00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:46.320
And so this is the area.

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:47.560
This is the purple area.

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:49.160
That's not purple.

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:53.810
This is the purple
area, right over here.

00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:55.140
This is the area of this.

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:57.479
This is the area of that.

00:09:57.479 --> 00:09:59.020
And let's simplify
this a little bit.

00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:00.890
Let's factor out a delta t.

00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:02.850
So if you factor
out a delta t, you

00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:07.965
get delta t times, a
bunch of stuff, v sub i.

00:10:07.965 --> 00:10:11.580
So your initial velocity.

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:12.780
We factored this out.

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:14.710
Plus this stuff.

00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:17.070
Plus this thing right over here.

00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:18.790
And we can distribute
the one half.

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:24.330
We factored the delta t's out.

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:26.910
And let's multiply the one half
times each of these things.

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:30.810
So it's going to be
plus, one half times v f,

00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:32.670
times our final velocity.

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:35.040
That's not the right
color, let me actually

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:38.040
do it in the right color so
you understand what I'm doing.

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:39.750
So this is the one half.

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:42.870
So plus one half times
our final velocity.

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:49.845
Minus one half times
our initial velocity.

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:55.271
I want to do that in blue.

00:10:55.271 --> 00:10:57.270
Sorry, I'm having trouble
changing colors today.

00:10:57.270 --> 00:10:59.635
Minus one half times
our initial velocity.

00:11:03.572 --> 00:11:05.030
And now what does
this simplify to?

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:07.450
We have something plus one
half times something else,

00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:10.230
minus one half times
that original something.

00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:14.490
So what is v i minus
one half times v i.

00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:16.230
So anything minus
half of it, you're

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:19.070
just going to have a
positive half left.

00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:21.490
So these two terms,
this term and this term

00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:27.300
will simplify to one half v i.

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:30.980
One half the initial
velocity plus one half times

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:31.780
the final velocity.

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:37.730
And all of that is
being multiplied

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:42.740
by our change in time.

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:45.410
Or the time that has gone by.

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:49.359
And this tells us the distance.

00:11:49.359 --> 00:11:50.650
The distance that we travelled.

00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:53.050
Or another way to
think about it-- let's

00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:56.090
factor out this one half.

00:11:56.090 --> 00:12:00.200
You get distance is equal
to change in time, times--

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:06.930
factoring out the one
half-- v i plus v f.

00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:09.260
No, that's not the right color.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:13.150
v i plus v f.

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:17.220
So this is interesting.

00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:21.020
The distance we traveled
is equal to one half

00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:24.340
of the initial velocity
plus the final velocity.

00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:26.350
So this is really--
if you just took,

00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:28.330
this quantity right
over here is just

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:32.140
the arithmetic-- I always
have trouble saying that word.

00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:35.829
It's the arithmetic mean
of these two numbers.

00:12:35.829 --> 00:12:37.870
And so I'm going to define
this as something new.

00:12:37.870 --> 00:12:39.920
I'm going to call this
the average velocity.

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:42.000
But we have to be very
careful with this.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.130
This right here is
the average velocity.

00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:48.830
But the only reason
why I can just

00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:52.137
take the starting velocity and
the ending velocity and, adding

00:12:52.137 --> 00:12:53.720
them together, and
then divide by two.

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:55.803
Essentially taking the
average of these two things

00:12:55.803 --> 00:12:57.370
which would be
someplace over here.

00:12:57.370 --> 00:12:59.220
And I take that as
the average velocity,

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:02.280
is because my
acceleration is constant.

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:05.771
Which is usually an assumption
in most introductory physics

00:13:05.771 --> 00:13:06.270
classes.

00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:07.770
But it's not always
the assumption.

00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:11.090
But if you do have a constant
acceleration like this,

00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:13.900
you can assume that
the average velocity

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:17.890
is going to be the average
of the initial velocity

00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:19.647
and the final velocity.

00:13:19.647 --> 00:13:21.980
If this was a curve or if the
acceleration was changing,

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:23.720
you could not do that.

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:25.430
But what's useful
about this-- is

00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:28.270
if you want to figure out the
distance that was traveled

00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:30.530
you just need to know
the initial velocity

00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:32.350
and the final velocity.

00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:34.980
Average the two, and
then multiply that

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:37.310
times the time that goes by.

00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:39.210
So in this situation,
our final velocity

00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:41.150
is 13 meters per second.

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:44.180
Our initial velocity was
five meters per second.

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:47.600
So you have 13 plus
5 is equal to 18.

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:49.230
You divide that by 2.

00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:53.350
Your average velocity
is 9 meters per second,

00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:55.480
if you take the
average of 13 and 5.

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:58.440
And then 9 meters per
second times 4 seconds

00:13:58.440 --> 00:13:59.977
gives you 36 meters.

00:13:59.977 --> 00:14:01.560
So hopefully that
doesn't confuse you.

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:03.200
I just want to show you
where some of these things

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:04.360
that you'll see in
your physics class,

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:06.693
some of these formulas, why
you shouldn't memorize them,

00:14:06.693 --> 00:14:08.607
and they can all be deduced.
