00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.340
What we're going to
think about in this video

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.110
is elasticity of
demand-- tis-sit-tity,

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.890
elasticity of demand.

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:13.010
And what this is,
is a measure of how

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.410
does the quantity demanded
change given a change in price?

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.060
Or how does a change in price
impact the quantity demanded?

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:34.207
So change in price--
impact quantity--

00:00:34.207 --> 00:00:36.040
want to be careful
here-- quantity demanded.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.210
When you talk about
demand, you're

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:38.460
talking about the whole curve.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.530
Quantity demanded is a specific
quantity-- quantity demanded.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.070
And the way that we, as
economist-- I'm not really

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.174
an economist, but since
we're doing economics,

00:00:50.174 --> 00:00:51.590
we could pretend
to be economists.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.270
The way that
economists measure this

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:03.380
is they measure it as a
percent change in quantity

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:09.870
over a percent-- over the
percent change in price.

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.040
And the reason why they do
this, as opposed to just,

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.059
say, change in quantity
over change in price,

00:01:15.059 --> 00:01:17.600
is because if you did change in
quantity over change in price

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.240
you would have a number that's
specific to the units you're

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.740
using.

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.865
So it would depend on
whether you're doing quantity

00:01:22.865 --> 00:01:25.290
in terms of per hour, or
per week, or per year.

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.950
And so you would have different
numbers based on the time

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.360
frame, or the units,
that you might use.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.980
But when you use a percentage
it is a unitless number.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.220
Because the percentage--
you're taking a change

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.100
in some quantity,
divided by that quantity.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.260
So the units themselves
actually cancel out.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.370
And the reason why it's
called elasticity--

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:47.740
this might make some sense
to you-- or the reason

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.850
why I like to think
it's called elasticity,

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.020
is I imagine something
that's the elastic.

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.710
Like a elastic band
or a rubber band.

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.110
And in the rubber
band, if you pull it,

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.430
depending if something--
so let's say this one

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:01.060
is inelastic.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.160
So if you pull, you're not
going to able to pull it much.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.440
It's going to be fairly stiff.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.150
It's not going to stretch a lot.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.540
While something is
elastic-- if something

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.770
is elastic for a given
amount of force--

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.660
so this is for a given
amount of force--

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.284
you're not able to pull it much.

00:02:20.284 --> 00:02:21.700
And if something
is elastic, maybe

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.500
for the same amount
of force, you're

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.200
going to be able
to pull it a lot.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.050
So this right over
here is elastic.

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.150
And so the analogy, maybe,
might make a little bit sense--

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.890
relative to applied
price and demand.

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.130
Something is elastic-- so
let me write this down.

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.760
So let me write, very elastic.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:50.810
If a given change in
price-- given price change

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.460
you have-- and we'll talk about
percentages in a little bit.

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:57.080
But a given change in price,
you have a large change

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.046
in demand-- so large
percentage change.

00:02:59.046 --> 00:03:00.920
And let me just speak
in terms of percentage.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:07.260
Given a percentage
change in P, you

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:13.140
end up having a large
percentage change in Q.

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.290
That would be very elastic.

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.770
So you could imagine
the P is like the force,

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.290
and the Q, the
quantity demanded,

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.962
is how far the thing
can get stretched apart.

00:03:24.962 --> 00:03:26.920
And that's why we would
call this very elastic.

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.200
Just like a very
elastic rubber band.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:35.580
And if something is very
inelastic, if given a percent

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:45.780
change in P, you have a
small percent change in Q.

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.420
So just like a rubber band--
for a given amount of force,

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.120
if you're not able to
pull it much at all,

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.330
then it's inelastic.

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.250
If you're able to pull
a lot, it's elastic.

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.530
Same thing with
price and quantity.

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.610
For a given change in price, if
the percent quantity demanded

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.720
changes a lot-- very elastic.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.810
If it doesn't change a
lot-- very inelastic.

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.310
Now, with that out
of the way, let's

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.980
actually calculate
the elasticity

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.260
for multiple points along this
demand curve right over here.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.510
And I think that will give
us a bit better grounding.

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.055
Especially because there are a
little slightly-- I would call

00:04:24.055 --> 00:04:27.320
them unusual ways of calculating
the percent change in quantity

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.034
and the percent
change of price--

00:04:29.034 --> 00:04:30.700
just so that we get
the same number when

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:32.550
we have a positive
change in price.

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.300
And the same as we get
the negative change

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.440
in price-- or a negative and a
positive-- or a drop in price

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.820
and an increase in price.

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.870
So let me give myself
some real estate over here

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.370
because I want to do
some actual mathematics.

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.880
And actually all of this we will
be reviewing in what I'm about

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.320
do, and it will give me some
real estate to work with.

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.160
So let me clear all of that.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.689
And let me clear is
that right over here.

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:56.230
And what I'm going
to do is I'm going

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:59.340
to calculate the
elasticity of demand

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.040
at several points along this
demand curve right over here.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.380
And so the first one,
I will do it at point A

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.870
to point B. So let me
make another column

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.175
right over here--
elasticity of demand.

00:05:10.175 --> 00:05:11.550
And actually,
we're going to have

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.080
one column that's
elasticity of demand.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.674
So it's a big E with a little
subscript D. And the other one,

00:05:16.674 --> 00:05:18.090
I'll just take its
absolute value.

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.340
Because, depending
on-- sometimes

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.510
people like to just
think of the number,

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:24.494
which will tend to
be a negative number.

00:05:24.494 --> 00:05:25.910
And sometimes,
people like to look

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:27.220
at the absolute value of it.

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:30.640
So we'll look at both and
see what it actually means.

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:33.570
So let's say our price
drops from point A

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:35.940
to point B. So from
point A to point

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:41.800
B we have a $1-- a negative
$1 change in price.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.670
And we have a positive--
so this is a negative $1

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:45.850
change in price.

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:48.980
And we have a
positive $2-- sorry--

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:54.450
a positive two burger per hour
change in quantity demanded.

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:56.834
So what is the elasticity
of demand there?

00:05:56.834 --> 00:05:58.000
So let's write it over here.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.860
I'll do it in A's color.

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:03.170
So the elasticity
of demand, remember,

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:06.260
it's the percent
change in quantity.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.610
So percent change in
quantity-- I'll rewrite it.

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:13.520
It's the percent
change in quantity

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:20.210
over percent change in price.

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:24.240
And so we have-- what's our
percent change in quantity?

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.770
So it's going to be the change
in quantity over some base

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:28.640
quantity.

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.550
So our change in
quantity is two.

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:34.350
So it's going to be
equal to 2 over-- now

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:37.020
in traditional terms-- and this
is what I want to, kind of,

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:39.620
clarify-- is a little bit
unusual in how we do it.

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:42.890
But we do it, so that we get
the same elasticity of demand

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:44.780
whether we go from
A to B or B to A.

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:46.690
Or essentially, we get
the same elasticity

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:49.770
of demand along this
whole part of the curve.

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:51.640
Instead of just
dividing the change

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:54.492
in quantity divided by
our starting point, what

00:06:54.492 --> 00:06:55.950
I want to do is
I'm going to divide

00:06:55.950 --> 00:07:00.290
the change in quantity divided
by the average of our starting

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:01.550
and our ending, points.

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:04.220
So that's going to be 2
over-- and I'll actually

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:05.340
do the math explicitly.

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:06.345
Actually, no, let's
just think about it.

00:07:06.345 --> 00:07:07.910
What's the average
between 2 and 4.

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:10.670
Well, the average is
just going to be 3.

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:13.530
That's the average of 2 and 4.

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:17.180
Let me write it down
to, just so it's clear.

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:21.780
That right over here
is 2 plus 4 over 2.

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:22.750
That's how you get 3.

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:24.541
That's how you would
calculate the average.

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:30.120
So that is our
proportionate change.

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:33.160
And then you want to
multiply by 100-- times 100--

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.500
to actually get a percentage.

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:37.330
And then, what is
our change in price?

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:40.550
Well we're going to do the
same thing, or the percent

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:41.590
change in price.

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:44.040
Our change in price
is negative 1.

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:47.960
It is negative 1 over-- and
once again, we don't just

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:50.460
do negative 1 divided
by 9, we do it

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:53.120
over the average of 8 and 9.

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:57.190
And the average
of 8 and 9 is 8.5.

00:07:57.190 --> 00:08:00.480
And then multiply by 100
to get your percentage.

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:02.710
Now, these 100s,
obviously, cancel out.

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:04.610
These 100s cancel out.

00:08:04.610 --> 00:08:07.094
And so we are going to be
left with-- when you divide

00:08:07.094 --> 00:08:08.510
by a fraction,
it's the same thing

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:10.720
as multiplying by its inverse.

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:17.320
So we're going to get 2/3
times negative 8.5 over 1--

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:22.830
or times negative 8.5.

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:24.930
I'll get out our
calculator and it

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:32.559
is-- well, multiply
2 times negative 8.5,

00:08:32.559 --> 00:08:38.610
and then divided by 3, which
gives us negative 5.6667.

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:40.779
It's really negative 5 2/3.

00:08:40.779 --> 00:08:42.320
So I'll just write
it negative-- I'll

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:44.950
round it-- it's negative 5.67.

00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:51.260
So this is approximately
equal to negative 5.67.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:55.570
So right over here
it's negative 5.67.

00:08:55.570 --> 00:09:00.190
And this absolute value
is, obviously, just 5.67.

00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:03.710
And I'll leave it to you
to verify, for yourself,

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:06.470
that you'll get the same
elasticity of demand

00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:08.040
using this technique--
where you use

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:10.470
the average as your
base in the percentage.

00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:13.970
Going from 9 to 8 as
going-- going from 9 to 8

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:16.580
in price as going
from 8 to 9 in price.

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:20.330
Which is different than if you
used the 9 as the base or the 8

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:21.330
as the base.

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:22.990
So this right here
is the elasticity

00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:25.470
of demand-- not just at point
A. You can, kind of, view

00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:27.410
it is the average
elasticity of demand

00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:29.680
over this little part of
the curve, which is really

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:33.400
a line in this example--
over this part of the arc.

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:36.680
So we'll write that
part right over here.

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:38.090
I'll write the absolute value.

00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:42.040
The absolute value of our
elasticity of demand is 5.67.

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:45.200
Now let's do the other two
sections right over here.

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:47.920
So let's think
about what happens

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:55.230
when we go from C to D. So our
elasticity of demand there.

00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:59.420
So from C to D we have a
change in quantity, once again,

00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:00.410
of plus 2.

00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:03.990
And our change in price,
once again, is negative 1.

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:07.291
But we'll see, even though
that the change in the quantity

00:10:07.291 --> 00:10:09.040
over-- the change of
quantity is the same,

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:10.540
and the change in
price is the same,

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:12.830
we're going to have a
different elasticity of demand,

00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:15.650
because we have different
starting points.

00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:17.920
Our starting points and
our ending points for price

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:20.560
are lower and our starting
and ending points for quantity

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:21.110
are higher.

00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:23.650
So it will actually
change the percentage.

00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:25.180
So let's see what we get.

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:27.920
So our percent change
in quantity-- we

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:30.470
have a change in quantity of 2.

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:33.070
And then our average
quantity is 9

00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:38.690
plus 11, which is 20,
divided by 2 is 10.

00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:41.980
All of that over
percent change in price.

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:51.410
So we have-- let me scroll down
a little bit-- negative one

00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:53.660
divided by the average price.

00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:55.550
So negative 1 is
the change in price.

00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:58.170
And we want to divide
that by the average price.

00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:02.370
Well, $5.50 plus $4.50 is
$10-- divided by 2 is $5.00.

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:04.980
So the average is $5.00.

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:06.550
And we can multiply
the numerator

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:08.340
by 100 and the
denominator by 100,

00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:11.060
but that won't change
anything, because we could just

00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:12.750
divide both by 100.

00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:15.340
And so this is
equal to 2 over 10,

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:17.870
times-- dividing by a
fraction is the same thing

00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:22.070
as multiplying by its inverse--
times negative 5 over 1.

00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:25.320
And this is just because 2 over
10 is the same thing as 1/5.

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:29.340
1/5 times negative 5 over
1-- it is negative 1.

00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:30.700
So this right over here.

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:33.116
So our elasticity of demand
right over here is negative 1.

00:11:33.116 --> 00:11:34.990
Or it's absolute value is 1.

00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:38.470
So the absolute value of
the elasticity of demand,

00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:41.602
right over here, is equal to 1.

00:11:41.602 --> 00:11:43.060
Now let's just do
one more section,

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:45.185
and maybe, the next video
we can think a little bit

00:11:45.185 --> 00:11:47.090
about what it's telling us.

00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:49.220
So let's do this last
section over here,

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:51.100
just for some practice.

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:53.224
I encourage you to pause
it and try it yourself.

00:11:53.224 --> 00:11:55.140
And so we're going to
think about this section

00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:55.990
right over here.

00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:59.470
So once again, our change
in quantity is plus 2,

00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:02.440
and our change in
price is negative 1.

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:05.200
And our elasticity
of demand-- change

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:10.030
in quantity-- 2 over average
quantity, which is 17.

00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:14.180
Change in price is negative
1 over average price--

00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:16.760
1 plus 2 divided by 2 is $1.50.

00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:21.100
Or $1.50 is right in between
these two-- divided by $1.50.

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:23.930
We don't have to multiply the
numerator and the denominator

00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:25.780
by 100 because those
just cancel out.

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:30.110
So we get 2 over 17,
times negative-- well,

00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:33.990
we could just write this
as negative $1.50 over 1.

00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:36.630
And this is equal
to-- getting our--

00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:38.940
getting our calculator back out.

00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:41.890
So this is equal to--
I'll just write-- well,

00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:44.470
it's really just going to be
negative 3 over 17, right?

00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:48.560
2 times negative $1.50
is negative 3 over 17.

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:55.480
So negative 3 divided by 17
is equal to, I'll just say,

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:57.580
negative 0.18.

00:12:57.580 --> 00:13:05.860
So here it is, negative 0.18,
and its absolute value is 0.18.

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:11.440
So the elasticity of
demand over here is 0.18.

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.710
And I'll leave you there,
and in the next video

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:17.170
we'll think about these
results a little bit.
