00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.022
Welcome to the
presentation on ratios.

00:00:03.022 --> 00:00:05.580
Now, I'm going to start just
giving you a definition

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.770
of ratios, and this I
got from Wikipedia.

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.420
"A ratio is a quantity that
denotes the proportional amount

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.980
of magnitude of one quantity
relative to another." So I'm

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.600
going to tell you from the
beginning that I think a ratio

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.870
is something that's easier to
understand than to give a

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:20.580
definition for because I
don't think that Wikipedia

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.090
definition is that useful.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:24.490
Let me give you some examples.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.210
If there are-- let's say
there are-- let me make

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.640
this pen size is right.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:39.480
Let's say there 10 boys
and 2 girls in a class.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:47.270
So the ratio of boys to girls
would be 10:2 or 10/2.

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.070
Those are two different
ways of writing it.

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.030
And we know from fractions
that that's also the same

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:57.720
thing as 5:1 or 5/1.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.320
We want to keep the 1 there
because we know that it's a

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.520
ratio of one thing
to another thing.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.560
So what does that mean?

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.240
All that means is that for
every 5 boys there's 1 girl.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.240
And so if we told you that the
ratio of boys to girls in a

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:16.290
room is 5:1, and we told you
that there are-- let's say that

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:23.300
we told you that there are 100
girls, then we'd know that,

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.290
well, for every 1 of those
girls, there's 5 boys, so

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.860
that means that there'd
be 500 boys, right?

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.795
Or you could also look at that
as the ratio of boys to girls

00:01:34.795 --> 00:01:39.320
is 500/100, which equals 5/1.

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.730
And this is the typical way
that a ratio is written:

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:47.690
500:100 of boys girls.

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.620
Now, let me ask you a couple
of questions based on that.

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.340
I think you get
the general idea.

00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:04.380
If I told you that the ratio
of, let's say, red balls to

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:15.190
green balls in a bag is 2:3.

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:33.330
And then if I also told you
that there are 40 red balls,

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.750
how many green balls are there?

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.730
Well, what we say is the ratio
of red balls to green balls--

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.240
so we know that there are 40
red balls, and then we want to

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.970
solve for the number of green
balls, that that

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.770
is equal to 2/3.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.970
And then we could
just solve this.

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.440
We just cross multiply.

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:04.325
40 times 3 is 120 is equal to
2g, and then we just solve.

00:03:04.325 --> 00:03:08.190
We just say g equals 60.

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.560
And there's an easier way of
doing this kind of in your

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.270
head, and this is the algebraic
way that'll always work.

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:15.440
But you could also just say--
let me write this a little bit.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.690
This is a 3 down here.

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.570
You can also say, well, to get
from 2 to 40, you have to

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:26.005
multiply by 20, so to get from
3 to g, I'm also going

00:03:26.005 --> 00:03:28.170
to multiply by 20.

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.090
And so 3 times 20 is 60.

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.270
That's another way to do it.

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:33.110
A lot of you might actually
find it more intuitive

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.900
just to think about it.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.510
Well, if for every 2 red balls,
there are 3 green balls.

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:43.310
Then if there are 40 red balls,
then it makes sense that there

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.640
would be 60 green balls because
for every 20, there'd be 30,

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.020
for every 40, there'd be 60.

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.940
I hope I'm not completely
confusing you.

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:54.070
Let me give you
another example.

00:03:54.070 --> 00:04:11.790
Let's say the ratio of boys
to girls is equal to 2 to 7.

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:20.950
And if I were tell you that the
total class has 180 kids in it,

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.050
can we figure out how many
boys and girls there

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.620
are in the class?

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.110
Well, let's think about it.

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:36.000
Well, we know that the boys to
girls is equal to 2/7, and we

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.750
also know that the boys plus
girls is equal to 180.

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.330
So here, we have a system of
two equations and two unknowns.

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.380
And you could actually, if
you really think about it,

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.210
you could actually solve
this without algebra.

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.920
But I'll show you the algebraic
way, because when problems get

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.590
complicated, this'll
always work.

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.730
So what we can do is we
can do substitution.

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:03.220
We know that b is
equal to 2/7g, right?

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:07.650
I just multiplied both sides
of this equation by g.

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.570
It cancels out there, and then
times g, and you get this.

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:14.940
And then we can just substitute
that back in for b.

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:24.620
So then we have 2/7g
plus g is equal to 180.

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:31.290
And what's 2/7g plus--
we could 1g or 7/7g?

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:33.900
Well, you could do the
fraction, but it's 2/7 plus 1

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:41.420
is the same thing as-- that's
equal to 2/7 plus 7/7, right,

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:45.430
because that's just
1g is equal to 180.

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:47.670
And I'm jumping around on the
chalkboard on purpose to

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:51.170
intentionally confuse you.

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:52.550
OK, this is where I am.

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:55.400
So 2/7 plus 7/7g equals 180.

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:00.580
So we have 9/7g
is equal to 180.

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:02.640
And then we just multiply
both sides times the

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:07.560
reciprocal of 7/9.

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:07.930
Oops!

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:08.490
That's not a g.

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:09.570
That's a 9.

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:12.965
Once, again, an intentional
device to confuse you.

00:06:12.965 --> 00:06:23.450
These cancel out, and you
get g equals 180 times 7/9.

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:27.420
Well, 180 divided by 9,
this is just 20, right?

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:30.650
So g is equal to 140.

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:34.250
So if there's 140 girls in
the room, how many boys

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:34.850
are there going to be?

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:39.060
Well, we know that the whole
class has 180 people, and we

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.960
know b plus g is 180, so
there's going to be-- the

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.610
boys are equal to 40.

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:50.420
And this is really about as
difficult as I guess we could

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:52.650
say basic ratio problems get.

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:54.280
There's nothing really
difficult about ratios.

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:57.710
They're just representing, for
every amount of one thing, how

00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:59.350
much do you have of
the other thing?

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:04.170
And then you can use that
ratio if you have some other

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:06.840
information in terms of how
many total people there are, or

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:09.000
how many total objects there
are, or how much of one object

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.810
there is, you can use that to
figure out how much of the

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:16.110
other object there is or how
many total objects there are.

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:19.840
I think you're now ready to try
some of the ratio problems, and

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:22.230
I'm going to do another
presentation on what I would

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:25.260
consider slightly more
advanced ratio problems.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.330
So have fun.
