00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:05.500
Here is a plot showing infection rate of the Code One Version Two Worm which

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.280
ultimately infected 350,000 vulnerable hosts. Note the shape

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.610
of this curve. The worm is effectively dormant

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:16.620
or spreading extremely slowly for quite a

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.700
period of time. And then there's a inflection

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.750
point at which point the infection rate becomes

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.920
exponential At some point then, infections slow and

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.430
the infection rate ultimate plateaus, presumably after

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.009
all of the infected hosts have been found.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.190
We can actually model the spread of these

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.680
worms using the random constant spread model. If

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.440
Kis the initial compromised rate, N is the

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.040
number of vulnerable hosts, and a is the

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.530
fraction of hosts already compromised, we can now

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.170
express the number of hosts infected at a

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.670
particular time increment in terms of the machines already

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.660
infected, and the rate at which uninfected machines become compromised. So

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.950
if Nda. Is the number of newly infected machines

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:11.310
in DT, we can express that in terms of the number of machines

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.290
already infected. Which is, N times a. So these are the

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:23.550
host already capable of doing more scanning. And now K times 1 minus a

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.160
is the rate at which uninfected machines

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.570
become compromised, in a particular time interval

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.440
dt. If we solve for a the fraction of hosts compromised, which is effectively

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.650
the y-axis of this graph and we get the following. You get an exponential curve

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.740
that is exponential where the growth rate depends

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.250
only on K, or the initial compromise rate.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:49.990
This is very interesting because it tells us

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.000
that if we want to design a very fast

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.580
spreading worm, then we should design a worm

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.640
such that the initial compromise rate is as high

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.400
as possible. So how do we increase K.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.280
Or how do we increase that initial compromise rate?
