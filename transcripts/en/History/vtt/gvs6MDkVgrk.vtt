00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:04.770
MIKE: Danielle is sending us to
visit Terry and his wife Jean.

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.830
Their collection
covers everything,

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.470
but it focuses on
eye-related stuff.

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:12.800
FRANK: Hello!
JEAN: Hi, there.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.030
FRANK: Jean and Terry?
MIKE: How're you doing?

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:15.200
JEAN: Yes.
FRANK: How're you doing?

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.930
MIKE: Man, this is
a beautiful property!

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:18.130
FRANK: Beautiful.
JEAN: Thank you so much.

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:19.400
FRANK: I see the lake
out there for fishing too.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.130
JEAN: Oh, yeah, yeah.
That's kind of a bonus.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:22.830
MIKE: Here, watch this,
I'm gonna bust these out on ya.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.100
TERRY: Oh, there,
I've seen them before.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:25.200
MIKE: She said you
were in the business.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.230
TERRY: There you are.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:27.500
MIKE: How many years
were you in?

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.130
TERRY: 40.
MIKE &amp; FRANK: 40 years!

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.930
TERRY: As an ophthalmologist,
I'm interested in collecting

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.070
old eye-related antiques
and instruments

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.730
that were used back
in the early 1900s.

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.870
And also quackery.

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.600
MIKE: She also said that
you guys have been married

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.700
for over 50 years?

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.130
TERRY: 54.
JEAN: 54 and a half now.

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:47.570
MIKE: No kidding.
FRANK: That's how old I am.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:48.600
TERRY: We were
high-school sweethearts.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.670
MIKE &amp; FRANK: No kiddin'.

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.330
TERRY: So we ended up
getting married.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.830
Interestingly, she was 21, I was
20; we're about 5 months apart.

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.100
MIKE: Oh, really?
JEAN: [laughs]

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.230
MIKE: Can we look
around a little bit?

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.330
TERRY: Oh, absolutely.
JEAN: Sure, come in.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:00.400
MIKE: Man.
TERRY: Come on in.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.800
TERRY: We decided to downsize,

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.070
because the kids have let
us know what they want,

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:05.930
and there's still
a lot of stuff.

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.070
And we would like to pass it on
so someone else can enjoy it.

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.330
MIKE: Oh, my gosh,
look at those, Frank.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:11.370
TERRY: What'd you find?

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:12.900
FRANK: This is a cool
little sign here.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.900
It's got the spectacles
right on there.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.200
TERRY: That is very nice.
FRANK: I mean, it's early.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.300
Do you remember
where you got this?

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.330
TERRY: No.

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:20.400
FRANK: No?
Just when you were buying?

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.700
TERRY: That's probably
30, 40 years ago.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.070
FRANK: You wanna
plug this one in?

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.770
TERRY: Yes.
FRANK: Hit it.

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.070
TERRY: There it is.
FRANK: Oh, yeah.

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:28.130
That's pretty.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.600
FRANK: You know, when
the bulbs burn out,

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.900
a lot of people put
a regular 50-watt, 60-,

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.470
or 100-watt in there.
Well, that heats up,

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.330
and then makes it flake
away from the front.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:37.330
FRANK: Octagon, right?

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:38.730
8-side?
TERRY: Right.

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:43.400
That particular configuration
was replaced by oval frames,

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.730
probably in the 40s.

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.630
So that dates it
probably from the 30s.

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.500
TERRY: That would be in an
optician's dispensing shop.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.100
You go in and you see
these little glasses and,

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.070
how could you leave without
buying a pair of glasses, right?

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.200
FRANK: Is this something
you would sell?

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.570
TERRY: I would,
if the price was right.

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.270
FRANK: Okay.
I think in a retail setting,

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.570
it'd be up to maybe 700.

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.830
I would be in it...
for $550.

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.100
TERRY: I think that's good.
Let me...

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.670
Jean?
JEAN: Yes.

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.800
You said how much, 550?
FRANK: 550.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.870
JEAN: I think that's good.

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.530
FRANK: So 550 will do it?
TERRY: It's done.

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.670
FRANK: Alright.
Thank you.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.000
TERRY: Done deal.
FRANK: Thank you very much.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.170
FRANK: A lot of this stuff
Terry and Jean have bought

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.670
is great, highly
collectible stuff.

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.700
But they bought it
at the right time,

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.730
and now it's worth
a lot of cash.

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.770
MIKE: Jean and Terry
bought the best of the best.

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.700
And for them, it wasn't
just about the buying,

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.870
it was about the journey.
FRANK: Ooh, here we go.

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.100
MIKE: For them, it was about
travelling together and finding

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.670
these things directly
connected to their life.

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:40.730
FRANK: See you, Terry!
[honks horn]

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.800
FRANK: See you, Jean!
JEAN: Bye!
