00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Here is a quick quiz on diminishing returns.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Say if we have an execution time that's this long

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and function A takes up 90 seconds, and function B takes up 10 seconds

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
for a total of 100 seconds execution time.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Let's saw we're able to make an improvement to our code.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
We speed up B by a factor of 10.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
We make B ten times faster.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
The question is how much faster do we make the overall execution

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
of our whole program if B is made 10 times faster?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Do we make the whole program 9 times faster,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.000
5 times faster, 2 times faster, or 1.1 times faster?

00:00:53.000 --> 09:59:59.000
These are approximate number, not exact numbers.
