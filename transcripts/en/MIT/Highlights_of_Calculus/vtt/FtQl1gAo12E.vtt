00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.640
PROFESSOR: OK, this lecture
is about the slopes, the

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.690
derivatives, of two of the
great functions of

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.830
mathematics: sine
x and cosine x.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.250
Why do I say great functions?

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.670
What sort of motion do we
see sines and cosines?

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.960
Well, I guess I'm thinking
of oscillations.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.470
Things go back and forth.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.270
They go up and down.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.850
They go round in a circle.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.980
Your heart beats and
beats and beats.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.530
Your lungs go in and out.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.470
The earth goes around the sun.

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:52.490
So many motions are repeating
motions, and that's when sines

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:56.030
and cosines show up.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.810
The opposite is growing
motions.

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:03.990
That's where we have powers of
x, x cubed, x to the n-th.

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:06.170
Or if we really want
the motion to get

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.820
going, e to the x.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.010
Or decaying would be
e to the minus x.

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.760
So there are two kinds here.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.830
We're talking about the ones
that repeat and stay level,

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.480
and they all involve
sines and cosines.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.010
And to make that point,
I'm going to have to--

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.910
you know what sines and cosines
are for triangles from

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:31.250
trigonometry.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.920
But I have to make those
triangles move.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.830
So I'm going to put the triangle
in a circle, with one

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.400
corner at the center, and
another corner on the circle,

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.450
and I'm going to move
that point.

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.820
So it's going to be
circular motion.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.550
It's going to be the
motion that--

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.890
the perfect model of repeating
motion, around

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.940
and around the circle.

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.690
And then the answer we're going
to get is just great.

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.170
The derivative of sine x turns
out to be cosine x.

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.699
And the derivative of cosine x
turns out to be minus sine x.

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:11.740
You couldn't ask for more.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:18.230
So my interest is always to
explain those, but then I want

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.320
to really--

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.370
we're seeing this limit stuff
in taking a derivative, and

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:31.230
here's a chance for me
to find a limit.

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.900
This turns out to be the crucial
quantity: the sine of

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:42.320
an angle divided by the angle,
when the angle goes to 0.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:48.030
Of course, when it's at 0,
the sine of 0 is 0, so

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.300
we have 0 over 0.

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.560
This is the big problem
of calculus.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.110
You can't be at the limit,
because it's 0

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.020
over 0 at that point.

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.060
But you can be close to it.

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.480
And then if we drew a graph, had
a calculator, whatever we

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.950
do, we would see that that ratio
is very close to 1, but

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:11.770
today we're going to actually
prove it from the meaning of

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:13.170
sine theta.

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.390
Now remember what
that meaning is.

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.160
So back to the start
of the world.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.040
Actually back to Pythagoras,
way, way back.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.780
The key fact is what you
remember about right

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:31.580
triangles, a squared plus b
squared equals c squared.

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.545
That's where everything starts
for a right triangle.

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.000
I don't know if Pythagoras
knew how to prove it.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.270
I think his friends
helped him.

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:44.510
A lot of people have
suggested proofs.

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:46.570
Einstein gave a proof.

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:49.290
Some US president even
gave a proof.

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:57.440
So it's a fundamental fact, and
I'm going to divide by c

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.940
squared, because I'd like the
right hand side to be 1.

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.870
So if I divide by c squared, I
just have a squared over c

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:10.440
squared plus b squared
over c squared is 1.

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.840
And I'm going to make that
hypotenuse in my picture 1.

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:23.130
So then this will be the a over
c, and that ratio of the

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.110
near side to the hypotenuse
is the cosine.

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.940
So what I have here is
cosine theta squared.

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:33.440
Let me put theta in there.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.390
Theta is that angle
at the center.

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:37.440
And what's b?

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.240
So this is a over c.

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.110
That's cosine theta.

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:49.670
B over c is this point,
and that's sine theta.

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:52.500
And they add to 1.

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:58.250
So that's Pythagoras using
sines and cosines.

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:02.590
So this is the cosine.

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:07.300
And this vertical distance
is sine theta.

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.200
OK, so that's the
triangle I like.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.680
That's the triangle that's
going to move.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.860
As this point goes around the
circle at a steady speed, this

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.970
triangle is going to move.

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:25.850
The base will go left and
right, left and right.

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:30.370
The height will go up and down,
up and down, following

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.400
cosine and sine.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.370
And we want to know things
about the speed.

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:39.460
OK, so that's circular motion.

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.440
Now I've introduced
this word radians.

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:49.190
And let me remind you what they
are and why we need them.

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:54.230
Why don't we just use 360
degrees for the full circle?

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:56.420
360 degrees.

00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:02.280
Well, that's a nice
number, 360.

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.200
Somebody must have thought it
was really nice, and chose it

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:10.750
for measuring angles
around the world.

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:21.030
It's nice, but it's
not natural.

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:25.370
Somebody thought of it,
so it's not good.

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:30.580
What we need is the natural
way to measure the angle.

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:35.540
If we don't use the natural way,
then this is the sine--

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:39.060
if I measure this x
in degrees, that

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:40.240
formula won't be right.

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:44.240
There will be a miserable factor
that I want to be 1.

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:47.210
So I have to measure the angles
the right way, and

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:50.310
here's the idea of radians.

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:55.960
The measure of that
angle is this

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:59.720
distance around the circle.

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:03.630
That distance I'm going to call
theta, and I'm going to

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:05.980
say this angle is theta
radians when

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:09.790
that distance is theta.

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:12.770
So that now, what's
a full circle?

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:16.870
A full circle would mean the
angle went all the way round.

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:20.430
I get the whole circumference,
which is 2 pi.

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:24.575
So 360 degrees is
2 pi radians.

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:31.010
So the natural number
here is 2 pi.

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:35.150
This can't be helped, it's
the right one to use.

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:38.590
Radians are the right way
to measure an angle.

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:44.370
So now I'm ready to do the job
of finding this derivative.

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:45.620
OK.

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:52.370
Let me start at the
key point 0.

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:57.330
If we get this one, we get
all the rest easily.

00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:00.080
So I'm looking at the graph
of the sine curve.

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:02.460
I'm starting at 0.

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:09.450
We know what sine theta looks
like, and I'm interested in

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:11.950
the slope, the derivative.

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:15.920
That's what this subject
is about, calculus,

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:17.530
differentiating.

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:20.810
So I want to know the
slope at that point.

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:25.310
And it's 1.

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:27.260
And how do we show
that it's 1?

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:35.520
So now I'm coming to the point
where I'm going to give a

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:37.419
proof that is 1.

00:08:37.419 --> 00:08:43.624
And the proof isn't just for the
sake of formality or rigor

00:08:43.624 --> 00:08:45.390
or something.

00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:50.120
You really have to understand
the sine function, the cosine

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:53.350
function, and this is
the heart of it.

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:54.560
OK.

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:56.470
So we want to show
that slope is 1.

00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:57.720
How am I going to do that?

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:03.510
That's the slope, right?

00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:08.400
If I go a tiny amount theta,
then I go up sine theta.

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:14.960
So in this average slope, if
I take a finite step--

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:17.440
I could have called it delta
theta, but I don't want to

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:19.000
write deltas all the time.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.300
So I just go out a little
distance theta and up to the

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:25.190
sine curve.

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:28.890
I stopped at the sine
curve by the way.

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:32.730
The straight line is a little
above the sine curve here.

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:39.560
And that ratio, up divided by
across, that's the delta sine

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:42.610
divided by delta theta.

00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:47.530
And because it started at 0,
it's just sine theta is the

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:50.070
distance up, and theta is
the distance across.

00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:53.220
So this is the average slope.

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:56.760
And of course you remember
what calculus is doing.

00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:01.720
There's always this limiting
process where you push things

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:05.300
closer and closer to the point,
and you find the slope

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:10.390
at that point, sometimes called
the instantaneous

00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:13.840
velocity or slope
or derivative.

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:15.830
Now here's the way it's
going to work.

00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:18.940
I'm going to show that sine
theta over theta is

00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:20.200
always below 1.

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:22.590
So two facts I want to prove.

00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:27.440
I want to show that sine theta
over theta is less--

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:30.670
sorry, sine theta over theta--

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:34.510
well, let me get this right.

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:36.690
I might as well put
it the neat way.

00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:41.250
I want to show that sine
theta is below theta.

00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:45.190
This is for theta
greater than 0.

00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:46.180
That's what I'm doing.

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:47.430
OK.

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:56.550
So that tells me that this
curve stays under that

00:10:56.550 --> 00:11:00.500
straight line, that 45 degree
line, which I'm claiming is

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:02.800
the tangent line.

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:05.830
And it tells me when I divide
it by the theta, it tells me

00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:08.920
that sine theta over
theta is below 1.

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:13.360
But now how much below 1?

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:15.920
Right now if I only know this,
I haven't ruled out the

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:18.860
possibility that the slope
could be much smaller.

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:21.310
So I need something below it.

00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:24.830
And fantastically, the
cosine is below it.

00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:29.190
So the other thing that I want
to prove is that the cosine--

00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:31.590
and I'll let me do
it this way.

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:36.310
I'm going to show the tangent of
theta is bigger than theta.

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:39.430
Again, some range of thetas.

00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:41.570
Positive thetas up
to somewhere.

00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:44.333
I don't know, I think
maybe pi over 2.

00:11:44.333 --> 00:11:49.800
But the main point is near
0, that's the main point.

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:51.160
So can I just rewrite--

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:53.600
do you remember what
the tangent is?

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:57.340
Of course, sine theta
over cosine theta.

00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:02.000
So this is sine theta
over cosine

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.480
theta, bigger than theta.

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:06.870
We still have to prove this.

00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:10.590
And now I want to bring the
theta down and move the cosine

00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:16.240
up, and that will tell me that
sine theta, when I divide by

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:20.510
the theta and multiply
by the cosine theta.

00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:27.980
So that was the same as that,
was the same as that.

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:29.710
And that's what I want.

00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:36.210
That tells that this ratio is
above the cosine curve.

00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:41.800
Do you see that if I can
convince you, and convince

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:45.450
myself that these are both true,
that this picture is

00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:47.215
right, then--

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:54.520
I haven't gone into gory
detail about limits.

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:58.400
If you really insist,
I'll do it later.

00:12:58.400 --> 00:12:59.650
But whatever.

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:06.400
You can see this has just got to
be true, that if this curve

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:14.180
is squeezed between the cosine
curve and the 1, then as theta

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:18.230
gets smaller and smaller,
it's squeezed to

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:21.780
equal 1 in the limit.

00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:25.155
Allow me to say that that's
pretty darn clear.

00:13:25.155 --> 00:13:26.405
OK.

00:13:29.210 --> 00:13:32.410
Whatever limit meets.

00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:35.620
So these are the main facts
that I need to show.

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:39.760
And I need to show those
using trig, right?

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:44.250
I have to draw some graph
that convinces you.

00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:46.950
And this isn't quite good
enough, because I just

00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:48.910
sketched a sine graph.

00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:51.565
I have to say where does
sine theta come from?

00:13:51.565 --> 00:13:52.590
OK.

00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:57.150
So this will be number one, and
this will be number two,

00:13:57.150 --> 00:14:03.450
and when we get those two things
convincing, then we

00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:07.570
know that sine theta over theta
is squeezed between and

00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:09.380
approaches 1.

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:14.780
And then we'll know the story
at the start, and you'll see

00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:21.060
that it becomes easy to
find these formulas

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:21.980
all along the curve.

00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:23.130
OK.

00:14:23.130 --> 00:14:24.500
Ready for these two?

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:26.330
Number one and number two.

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:27.580
OK, number one.

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:31.590
Why is sine theta--

00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:35.240
oh, I can probably see
it on this picture.

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:37.880
Yeah, I can prove number
one on this picture.

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:40.950
Look, that piece was
sine theta, right?

00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:48.890
And I want to prove
that this length--

00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:49.910
what am I trying to prove?

00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:51.800
That sine theta is
below theta.

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:55.701
Let me write it again
what it is to show.

00:14:55.701 --> 00:14:59.000
In math it's always a good
idea to keep reminding

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.170
yourself of what it
is you're doing.

00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:03.899
Sine theta is below theta.

00:15:03.899 --> 00:15:03.958
OK.

00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:05.208
So why is it?

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:09.850
And you see it here.

00:15:09.850 --> 00:15:12.400
That was sine theta, right?

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:14.260
And where was theta?

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:18.690
Well, because we measured theta
in radians, theta is

00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:23.080
this curvy distance that's
clearly longer.

00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:28.250
The shortest way from this to
the axis there is straight

00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:30.590
down, and that's sine theta.

00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:35.560
A slower way is go round and
end up at not the nearest

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:38.310
point, and that was theta.

00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:39.570
Is that good?

00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:44.570
I could sometimes just to be
even more convincing, you add

00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:48.890
a second angle, and you say OK,
there's 2 sine thetas and

00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:52.750
here is 2 thetas, and clearly we
all know that the shortest

00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:57.210
way from there to there
is the straight way.

00:15:57.210 --> 00:16:03.580
So I regard this as done
by that picture.

00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:05.960
You see we didn't
just make it up.

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:08.800
It went back to the fundamental
idea of where sine

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:10.390
theta is in a picture.

00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:13.920
Now I need another picture.

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:20.100
Yeah, I need another picture
for number two to show that

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:23.340
tan theta is bigger
than theta.

00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:24.930
That was our other job.

00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:30.370
So essentially, I need that
same picture again.

00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:33.900
Whoops, let me draw
that triangle.

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:41.240
Yeah, and it's got a circle.

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:44.320
OK, that's not a bad circle.

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:47.010
It's got an angle theta.

00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:48.260
And now I'm going to--

00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:54.140
math has always got
some little trick.

00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:55.590
So this is it.

00:16:55.590 --> 00:17:01.840
Go all the way out, so now the
base is 1, and this is still

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:03.090
the angle theta.

00:17:06.069 --> 00:17:08.520
And what else do I know
on that picture?

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:12.060
Now I've scaled the triangle
up from this little one, so

00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:13.190
the base is 1.

00:17:13.190 --> 00:17:15.589
So what's that height?

00:17:15.589 --> 00:17:19.960
Well, the ratio of the opposite
side to the near

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:23.819
side, that's what tangent is.

00:17:23.819 --> 00:17:25.619
Tangent is the ratio--

00:17:25.619 --> 00:17:27.470
whatever size the triangle--

00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:30.310
is the ratio of the opposite
side to the near side.

00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:37.180
Sine to cosine, here it's
tan theta is that

00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:39.690
distance, and to 1.

00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:40.630
Good.

00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:43.650
OK, but now how am I
going to see this?

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:51.870
I have to ask you--
and it's OK--

00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:55.770
to think about area instead
of distance for a moment.

00:17:55.770 --> 00:17:57.230
What about area?

00:17:57.230 --> 00:17:59.130
So what do I see of area?

00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:06.480
I see right away that the area
of this triangle is smaller

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:08.360
than the area--

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:10.520
sorry, I shouldn't have called
that a triangle.

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:15.020
That's a little piece of pie,
a little sector of a circle.

00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:17.080
So the area of this shaded--

00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:18.590
did I shade it OK--

00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:22.980
is less than--

00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:26.330
so this is the area
of the sector.

00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:30.470
Can I just call it the pie,
piece of a pie, is less than

00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:32.070
the area of the triangle.

00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:39.300
But we know what the area
of the triangle is.

00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:41.290
What's the area of a triangle?

00:18:41.290 --> 00:18:42.750
We can do that.

00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:45.200
It's the base half, right?

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:48.010
1/2 times the base
times the height.

00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:51.230
So the area of the triangle
is 1/2 times the

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:52.555
base 1 times the height.

00:18:52.555 --> 00:18:53.805
OK.

00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:58.950
Notice we've got the sign
going the right way.

00:18:58.950 --> 00:19:01.680
We want tan theta to be
bigger than something,

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:03.420
so what do I hope?

00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:08.620
I hope that the area of this
shaded part, the area of the

00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:15.520
circular sector, is
1/2 of theta.

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:18.660
Wouldn't that be wonderful?

00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:22.310
If I look at those areas,
nobody's in any doubt that

00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:26.390
this piece, this sector that's
inside the triangle, has an

00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:28.530
area less than the area
of the triangle.

00:19:28.530 --> 00:19:33.560
So now I just have to remember
why is the area of this

00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:37.120
sector, half of theta.

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:40.680
You know, there's another reason
why areas come up right

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:44.600
when we use a radians, when we
measure theta with radians.

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:52.050
So remember, just think about
this piece of pie compared to

00:19:52.050 --> 00:19:53.300
the whole pie.

00:19:56.180 --> 00:19:59.660
What's the area of the
whole piece of pie?

00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:03.740
So I'm explaining 1/2 theta.

00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:07.320
The area of the whole pie--

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:12.350
I'm going to get some terrible
pun here on the word pie.

00:20:12.350 --> 00:20:15.460
Unintended, forgive it.

00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:19.170
The area of that whole circle,
the radius is 1, we all know

00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:22.030
what the area of a circle
is pi r squared.

00:20:22.030 --> 00:20:26.020
r is 1, so the area is pi.

00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:29.240
My God, I didn't expect that.

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:30.860
Now what about this?

00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:34.280
What fraction is this sector?

00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:40.020
Well, the whole angle would be
2 pi, and this part of it is

00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:49.320
theta, so I have the sector is
theta over 2 pi, that's the

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:56.420
angle fraction, times the
pi, the whole area.

00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:58.190
Do you see it?

00:20:58.190 --> 00:21:02.830
This piece of pie, or
pizza, whatever--

00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:04.940
yeah, if I'd said pizza, I
wouldn't have had that

00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:06.840
terrible pun.

00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:08.940
Forget it.

00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:14.330
So the area of this piece of
pizza compared to the whole

00:21:14.330 --> 00:21:18.050
one is theta over
the whole 2 pi.

00:21:21.270 --> 00:21:25.690
Suppose it was a pizza cut
in the usual 6 pieces.

00:21:25.690 --> 00:21:28.180
Then this would be a 60
degree angle, but

00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:30.290
I don't want degrees.

00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:34.010
What would be the angle of that
piece of pizza that's cut

00:21:34.010 --> 00:21:36.510
when the whole pizza's
cut in 6?

00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:41.750
It would be 1/6 of 360.

00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:42.900
That's 60 degrees.

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:44.300
But I don't want degrees.

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:47.580
It's 1/6 of 2 pi.

00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:50.130
And this one is theta of 2 pi.

00:21:50.130 --> 00:21:52.540
Anyway, the pis cancel.

00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:57.090
Theta over 2 is the right
answer, and now we can cancel

00:21:57.090 --> 00:21:59.640
the 1/2, and we've
got what we want.

00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:08.660
That's pretty nice when you
realize that we were facing

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:12.210
for the first time, more or
less, the sort of tough

00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:16.970
problem of calculus when I can't
really divide theta into

00:22:16.970 --> 00:22:18.270
sine theta.

00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:22.880
Sine theta, I can't
just divide it in.

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:27.770
I have to keep them both
approaching 0 over 0, and see

00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:29.910
what that ratio is doing.

00:22:29.910 --> 00:22:36.800
And now I said to conclude,
I'll go back and prove the

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:40.830
slopes, find the slopes
at all points.

00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:43.140
OK, so at all points--

00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:44.920
now let's start with sine x.

00:22:49.150 --> 00:22:51.430
So what am I doing now?

00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:55.570
I'm looking at the sine curve.

00:22:55.570 --> 00:22:58.560
You remember it went up like
this and down like this.

00:22:58.560 --> 00:22:59.965
I'm taking any point x.

00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:07.870
Suddenly I changed the angle
from theta to x, just because

00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:09.830
I'm used to functions of x.

00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:12.420
We're just talking
letters there.

00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:16.940
X is good, and this is
a graph of sine x.

00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:18.327
X is measured in radians still.

00:23:18.327 --> 00:23:19.600
OK.

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:23.090
So now what am I doing to find
the derivative at some

00:23:23.090 --> 00:23:26.400
particular point?

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:28.740
I look at the sine there.

00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:32.550
I go a little distance
delta x.

00:23:32.550 --> 00:23:37.120
I go up to here, and
I look to see--

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:42.950
I want to know the change
in sine x divided by

00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:46.600
the change in x.

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:48.710
And of course, I'm going
to let the piece

00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:49.750
get smaller and smaller.

00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:52.320
That's what calculus does.

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:55.700
The main point is my x is
now here instead of

00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:57.120
being at the start.

00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:59.510
I've done it for the start, but
now I have to do it for

00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:00.670
all the other x's.

00:24:00.670 --> 00:24:03.170
So there's the x.

00:24:03.170 --> 00:24:05.820
There's the x plus delta
x, a little bit long.

00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:13.230
In other words, can I write this
in the familiar way, sine

00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:20.275
of x plus delta minus sine
there divided by delta x?

00:24:20.275 --> 00:24:21.525
OK.

00:24:23.230 --> 00:24:28.150
So again, we can't simplify
totally by just dividing the

00:24:28.150 --> 00:24:31.000
delta x in.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.920
We've got to go back
to trigonometry.

00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:40.500
Trig had a formula for
the sine of a plus b.

00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:45.440
Two angles added, then there's
a neat formula for it.

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:46.540
So the sine--

00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:50.260
can I remind you of
that formula?

00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:55.390
It is the sine of the first
angle times the cosine of the

00:24:55.390 --> 00:25:04.960
second minus the cosine of the
first angle times the sine of

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:05.290
the second.

00:25:05.290 --> 00:25:06.540
OK?

00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:12.095
You remember this,
right, from trig?

00:25:12.095 --> 00:25:15.310
The sine of a plus b
is this neat thing.

00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:17.620
Now I have to subtract sine x.

00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:20.550
So now can I subtract
off sine x?

00:25:20.550 --> 00:25:27.650
When I subtract off sine x,
then I need a minus 1.

00:25:27.650 --> 00:25:31.920
And now I have to divide
by delta x.

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:37.270
So I divide this by delta x, and
I divide this by delta x.

00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:38.520
OK.

00:25:42.090 --> 00:25:43.990
This is an expression
I can work with.

00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:47.850
That's why I had to remember
this trig formula to get this

00:25:47.850 --> 00:25:49.700
expression that I
can work with.

00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:51.490
Why do I say I can
work with it?

00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:56.430
Because this is exactly what
I've already pinned down.

00:25:56.430 --> 00:25:59.080
Delta x is now headed for 0.

00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:03.040
This point is going to come
close to this one.

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:07.330
So actually, I've got two terms.
This sine delta x over

00:26:07.330 --> 00:26:12.590
delta x, what does that do
as delta x goes to 0?

00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:13.960
It goes to 1.

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:16.900
That was the point of that
whole right hand board.

00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:21.750
So this thing goes to 1.

00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:23.890
Wait a minute.

00:26:23.890 --> 00:26:26.380
That's a plus sign.

00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:33.530
Everybody watching is going
to think, OK, forgot trig.

00:26:33.530 --> 00:26:36.600
The sine of the sum of an angle
is the sine times the

00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:41.400
cosine plus the cosine
times the sine.

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:43.190
Sorry about that one too.

00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:47.680
OK, so sine of delta x over
delta x goes to 0.

00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:54.300
And now finally, this goes to 1,
and actually I need another

00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:55.590
little piece.

00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:59.030
I need to know this piece, and
I need to know that that

00:26:59.030 --> 00:27:02.010
ratio goes to 0.

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:08.750
So I need to go back to that
board and look again at the

00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:11.770
cosine curve at 0.

00:27:11.770 --> 00:27:17.240
Because this will be a slope
of the cosine curve at 0.

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:20.840
And the slope comes out 0
for the cosine curve.

00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:23.030
The slope for the sine
curve came out 1.

00:27:23.030 --> 00:27:25.470
Do you see how it's working?

00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:29.330
So this is gone because
of the 0.

00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:31.570
This is the cosine x times 1.

00:27:31.570 --> 00:27:36.590
All together I get
cosine of x.

00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:37.230
Hooray.

00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:38.430
That's the goal.

00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:44.410
That's the predicted plan,
desired formula cos x for the

00:27:44.410 --> 00:27:51.070
ratio of delta of sine x over
delta x as delta x goes to 0.

00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:53.270
Do you see that?

00:27:53.270 --> 00:27:56.760
So we used a trig formula,
and we got the sine

00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:59.340
right a little late.

00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:01.910
Well, of course the reason I--

00:28:01.910 --> 00:28:06.920
one reason I goofed was that the
other example, the other

00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:11.640
case we need for the
second formula does

00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:13.050
have a minus sign.

00:28:13.050 --> 00:28:16.160
And it survives in the end.

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:21.740
So I would do exactly the same
thing for the cosines that I

00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:22.930
did for the sines.

00:28:22.930 --> 00:28:24.710
If there's another board
underneath here,

00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:25.740
I'm going to do it.

00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:28.200
Yeah, there is.

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:38.480
Now I want to know the delta
of cosine x over delta x.

00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:43.190
That's what we do, we have to
simplify that, then we have to

00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:44.930
let delta x go to 0.

00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:46.780
So what does this mean?

00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:52.570
This means the cosine a little
bit along minus the cosine at

00:28:52.570 --> 00:28:55.950
the point divided by delta x.

00:28:55.950 --> 00:29:00.810
Again, we can't do that division
just right away, but

00:29:00.810 --> 00:29:03.790
we can simplify this
by remembering the

00:29:03.790 --> 00:29:06.750
formula that cosign--

00:29:06.750 --> 00:29:08.300
now let me try to remember it.

00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:17.160
It's a cosine times a cosine
for this guy plus a sine--

00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:23.510
no, minus a sine
times the sine.

00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:28.610
That's the formula that we all
remember and go to sleep with.

00:29:28.610 --> 00:29:30.160
Now divide by delta x.

00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:32.460
Oh, first subtract cosine x.

00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:35.909
So there was a cosine x, so I
want to subtract one of them.

00:29:35.909 --> 00:29:37.370
OK?

00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:39.860
And now I have to divide
by the delta x.

00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:42.260
So I do that there.

00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:44.290
I do it here.

00:29:44.290 --> 00:29:50.630
And you see that we're in
the same happy position.

00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:54.140
We're in the happy position that
as delta x goes to 0, we

00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:55.880
know what this does.

00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:57.770
That goes to 1.

00:29:57.770 --> 00:30:00.630
We know what this does,
or we soon will.

00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:05.000
That goes to 0, just the
way they did on the

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.430
board that got raised.

00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:10.160
So that term disappeared
just like before.

00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:12.340
This term survives.

00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:15.620
It's got a 1, it's got now a
sine x, and it's got now a

00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:16.950
minus sign.

00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:20.940
So that's the final result,
that the limit

00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:24.820
is minus sine x.

00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:30.740
That's the slope of
the cosine curve.

00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:33.050
And you wouldn't want
it any other way.

00:30:33.050 --> 00:30:35.030
You want that minus sign.

00:30:35.030 --> 00:30:38.660
You'll see it with second
derivatives.

00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:42.190
So it's just terrific that
those functions, the

00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:45.340
derivative of the sine is the
cosine with a plus, the

00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:47.310
derivative of the cosine is
the sine with a minus.

00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:48.570
OK.

00:30:48.570 --> 00:30:53.310
And we've almost proved it, we
just didn't quite pick up this

00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:56.210
point yet, and let me do that.

00:30:56.210 --> 00:30:58.190
That will finish this lecture.

00:30:58.190 --> 00:31:03.100
Why does that ratio
approach zero?

00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:05.750
What is that ratio?

00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:11.670
That ratio is coming from
the cosine curve.

00:31:11.670 --> 00:31:16.130
The cosine curve at 0, the way
this ratio came from the sine

00:31:16.130 --> 00:31:17.440
curve at 0.

00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:20.090
Here I'm taking--

00:31:20.090 --> 00:31:21.420
this is delta cosine.

00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:29.370
There's lots of ways I can do
this, but maybe I'll just do

00:31:29.370 --> 00:31:34.580
it the way you see it.

00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:37.230
What's the slope of
the cosine at 0?

00:31:40.340 --> 00:31:45.060
Yeah, I think I can ask that
without doing limits, without

00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:49.220
doing hard work.

00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:53.270
I'll just add the rest of the
cosine curve, because we know

00:31:53.270 --> 00:31:55.700
it's symmetric.

00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:57.410
What's the slope
at that point?

00:32:01.470 --> 00:32:04.750
This is actually the most
important application of

00:32:04.750 --> 00:32:09.140
calculus, is to locate
the place where a

00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:11.470
function has a maximum.

00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:14.630
The cosine, its maximum
is right there.

00:32:14.630 --> 00:32:19.030
Its maximum value is 1, and it
happens at theta equals 0.

00:32:19.030 --> 00:32:21.440
So the slope at a maximum--

00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:24.280
all right, I'm going
to put this--

00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:30.840
I could get this result by these
pictures, but let me do

00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:33.750
it short circuit.

00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:39.305
The slope at the maximum is 0.

00:32:39.305 --> 00:32:40.555
OK.

00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:47.870
Your intuition tells you that.

00:32:47.870 --> 00:32:52.960
If the slope was positive,
the function

00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:54.370
would still be rising.

00:32:54.370 --> 00:32:56.890
It wouldn't be a maximum, it
would be going higher.

00:32:56.890 --> 00:33:01.390
If the slope was negative, the
function would be coming down,

00:33:01.390 --> 00:33:04.470
and the maximum would
have been earlier.

00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:08.870
But here the maximum
is right there.

00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:11.840
The slope has to be
0 at that point.

00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:16.710
And that's the quantity that we
were after, because this is

00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:20.450
the cosine of delta x.

00:33:20.450 --> 00:33:23.060
There is the cosine
of delta x.

00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:28.970
Here is the 1, here is the delta
x, and this ratio is

00:33:28.970 --> 00:33:31.220
height over slope.

00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:35.310
It gets to height over slope as
we get closer and closer.

00:33:35.310 --> 00:33:39.510
It's the derivative, and
it's 0 at a maximum.

00:33:39.510 --> 00:33:47.640
And my notes give another way
to convince yourself that

00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:52.855
that's 0 by using these facts
that we've already got.

00:33:52.855 --> 00:33:55.040
OK.

00:33:55.040 --> 00:34:00.190
End of the-- so let me just
recap one moment, which this

00:34:00.190 --> 00:34:02.000
board will do.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.430
We now know the derivatives
of two of the great

00:34:05.430 --> 00:34:07.380
functions of calculus.

00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:11.600
We already know the derivative
of x to the n-th, and in the

00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:16.739
future is coming e to the
x and the logarithm.

00:34:16.739 --> 00:34:18.920
Then you've got the big ones.

00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:20.469
Thank you.
