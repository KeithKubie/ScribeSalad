00:00:12.358 --> 00:00:16.198
DAN PETERSON: So, good
morning everyone.

00:00:16.198 --> 00:00:18.500
Sorry, we're running a
little bit late here.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.080
The good news is that
we still have the full

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.920
hour for this session.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.900
So, if you didn't hear already,
this session is being moved

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.360
around a little bit, so that
you do 11:15 to 12:15 for

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.078
this particular session.

00:00:27.078 --> 00:00:28.760
So, I'm Dan Peterson.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:29.760
We have a fireside chat here.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.600
Just a chat about all
things going on with Wave.

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:33.860
I hope you liked our
announcement in the

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.500
keynote this morning.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.040
I think we'll start things off
here, just to introduce

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.440
everybody on the panel, and
then we'll be sort of switching

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.726
between our questions and
moderators, as well
17
00:00:42,726 --&gt; 00:00:42,16
as questions live.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.760
So, I'm Dan Peterson Product
Manager on the Federation

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:47.640
of API things.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.420
And, well Lars.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.980
We have a few mics.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.300
ALAN GREEN: My name is Alan
Green, I'm an Engineer on

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.560
Wave, and I'm most working
on Enterprise things.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:09.120
PAMELA FOX: My name is Pamela
Fox, and I work on Google Wave

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.580
API Developer Relations.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.880
DOUWE OSINGA: I'm Douwe, I'm
the TL on the API Team.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.900
JOCHEN BEKMANN: I'm
Jochen Bekmann, and work

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.380
primarily on Federation.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.500
So Lars would you like to kick
things off a little bit with

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.560
rehashing some of the
announcements in case

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.238
people missed it.

00:01:29.238 --> 00:01:29.860
LARS RASMUSSEN: Yes.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.690
First I should just say thank
you to all of you guys for all

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.720
the amazing things you've
built over the past years.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.360
And all of the feedback
we've gotten from you.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.458
That's been absolutely the
best part of the last year.

00:01:40.458 --> 00:01:41.040
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.860
Thank you.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.980
So, just to rehash the new
things we're announcing today.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.620
First and foremost where
opening up Wave to everyone.

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.860
So, you no longer need an
invitation to use Wave.

00:01:53.238 --> 00:01:56.040
This is true both for
individuals and for

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.880
organizations that
use Google Apps.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.198
If you have a Google
Apps domain, you can

00:02:00.198 --> 00:02:01.158
go and turn on Wave.

00:02:01.158 --> 00:02:03.998
I think we're rolling it out
during the morning here.

00:02:03.998 --> 00:02:07.254
So, it might not quite affect
your control panel yet,

00:02:07.254 --> 00:02:08.400
but it will be there soon.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.480
And, then with the API,
we're rolling out a

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.020
bunch of new things.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.520
For starters, we're starting
with a system that means Robots

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.520
no longer have to live on App
Engine, they can live

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.218
anywhere on the web.

00:02:22.218 --> 00:02:25.658
We're adding Media and
Attachment features to both

00:02:25.658 --> 00:02:28.098
our Robot and Media APIs.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.140
We are starting a new API, we
call it the Wave Data API, that

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.898
is designed to let you build
things like notifiers, and even

00:02:36.898 --> 00:02:39.818
light weight clients, in
particular for mobile devices.

00:02:39.818 --> 00:02:41.478
And, then we're adding a bunch
of smaller things, like a bunch

00:02:41.478 --> 00:02:44.080
of new hooks for your
extensions to better

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.918
integrate into our client.

00:02:45.918 --> 00:02:51.758
And, then on the protocol
track, we are open sourcing

00:02:51.758 --> 00:02:53.060
more of our production
code today.

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.020
I don't have the hit yet.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.538
who's in charge of
the hitting --

00:02:56.538 --> 00:02:57.498
JOCHEN BEKMANN: A summary
has been released, and

00:02:57.498 --> 00:02:58.300
there's more coming.

00:02:58.718 --> 00:02:59.498
LARS RASMUSSEN:

00:02:59.498 --> 00:02:59.758
OK.
71
00:02:59,758 --&gt; 00:02:59,138
Yes.

00:02:59.138 --> 00:03:02.558
The lines of code are trickling
in to the open source

00:03:02.558 --> 00:03:06.458
repository, its own particular,
the editor in our client, which

00:03:06.458 --> 00:03:09.078
by far is the hardest part to
write on the Wave client.

00:03:09.078 --> 00:03:11.380
We've open sourced that.

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.998
We're in the process of
open sourcing that today.

00:03:13.998 --> 00:03:15.598
I think, Jochen you can
nod if I'm telling

00:03:15.598 --> 00:03:16.898
the right thing here.

00:03:16.898 --> 00:03:19.160
Where, in the open source
repository, it's going to be

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.698
wrapped in a very simple Wave
plan, which speaks the

00:03:23.698 --> 00:03:28.478
beginnings of a client server
protocol between the

00:03:28.478 --> 00:03:31.838
lightweight web client and are
open source server

00:03:31.838 --> 00:03:32.860
called FedOne.

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.598
And, we also are putting up the
beginnings of a white paper

00:03:35.598 --> 00:03:36.238
describing that protocol.

00:03:36.238 --> 00:03:39.498
The idea is, and this is one of
the tough requested features,

00:03:39.498 --> 00:03:42.158
that you guys will be able to
build a web client from

00:03:42.158 --> 00:03:45.198
scratch, using our open source
code or not, that you can put

00:03:45.198 --> 00:03:48.898
on top of different Wave
systems that speak

00:03:48.898 --> 00:03:49.698
this protocol.

00:03:49.698 --> 00:03:52.438
Which, of course,
will include ours.

00:03:52.438 --> 00:03:55.558
And, so that's the
news from today.

00:03:55.778 --> 00:03:59.498
The primary reason that we're
opening out Wave now is that

00:03:59.498 --> 00:04:02.878
while when we started the
invitation only preview, it was

00:04:02.878 --> 00:04:06.798
clearly still, and we knew
this, it was pretty still

00:04:06.798 --> 00:04:10.398
buggy, it was slow, it has a
bunch of usability features.

00:04:10.978 --> 00:04:14.678
And, what we've measured in the
feedback from people actively

00:04:14.678 --> 00:04:16.118
using it over the past couple
of months, more and more we

00:04:16.118 --> 00:04:20.640
hear people actually
finding Wave make the more

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:21.180
productive and work.

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.380
And, that's why we're
opening up today.

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.100
And, in particular, the use
cases where Wave really shines

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.620
is for groups of people all
adopting Wave at the same time,

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.160
and using Wave as a primary
tool for coordinating the work,

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.240
for collaborating on it, for
writing their design documents,

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.698
for tracking their tasks, for
all those kinds of things.

00:04:38.698 --> 00:04:42.298
Let me just stop there,
and we'll take questions.

00:04:42.298 --> 00:04:43.118
DAN PETERSON: Maybe to kick
things off live, how about

00:04:43.118 --> 00:04:45.220
we take the first question
from the audience?

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.820
Wait, there's a mic
here in the middle.

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.338
Or, if there's nobody super
eager, we can jump into the

00:04:49.338 --> 00:04:50.360
moderator, because were are
geeks and have been

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.120
using Wave a lot.

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:59.118
You have a mic?

00:04:59.118 --> 00:04:59.638
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:05:00.938 --> 00:05:02.598
We've just been looking at
the new data APIs that

00:05:02.598 --> 00:05:03.358
you've have announced.

00:05:04.858 --> 00:05:07.398
We've noticed at the
moment that their still

00:05:07.398 --> 00:05:07.680
lockdown to sandbox.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.300
You know, what's the timescale
that you are working on to

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:18.498
release it to the main
preview or collabs.

00:05:18.498 --> 00:05:20.178
DOUWE OSINGA: Sorry
Data API, was it?

00:05:20.178 --> 00:05:22.300
AUDIENCE: The new Data API
that you just released today.

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:28.480
The inbox sort of access.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.138
DOUWE OSINGA: I'm pretty
sure that works.

00:05:30.418 --> 00:05:31.598
AUDIENCE: Is that on
preview as well

00:05:31.598 --> 00:05:31.678
as.

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.518
DOUWE OSINGA: You mean the,
sorry, do you mean the Data

00:05:38.518 --> 00:05:40.680
API or the Robot liberation?

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:41.800
AUDIENCE: The Data API.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:46.000
DOUWE OSINGA: The Data
API should work on --

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:46.120
DAN PETERSON: Yes.

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.120
So, the Data API is enabled
on both the sandbox instance

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.358
and the external instance?

00:05:51.358 --> 00:05:52.398
DOUWE OSINGA: I
sincerely hope so.

00:05:52.398 --> 00:05:53.160
DAN PETERSON: OK.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.818
If it's not, it will
be fixed, quickly.
139
00:05:56,818 --&gt; 00:05:56,338
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:05:56.338 --> 00:05:57.040
Thank you.

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.360
Thank you.

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.440
PAMELA FOX: The new Chrome
notifier extension is actually

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.638
using the Wave Date API.

00:06:05.638 --> 00:06:07.600
And, you can use it with your
Google Wave preview account.

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.800
I've been using it for
the last 24 hours.

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:11.000
It's been riveting.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.818
So, that kind of proves that.

00:06:13.818 --> 00:06:16.920
If there's a mistake in the
docs, I might have written

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:17.618
them a bit late last night.

00:06:17.618 --> 00:06:24.160
So, we can take a look,
and check on that.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:24.980
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:27.318
On the new, the Editor that's
been open sourced, do I need

00:06:27.318 --> 00:06:29.398
to use GWT to use that?

00:06:29.398 --> 00:06:33.778
DAN PETERSON: The new
web client is uses GWT,

00:06:33.778 --> 00:06:37.398
yeah, so its Java code
would be releasing.

00:06:37.398 --> 00:06:40.058
AUDIENCE: Hi, will
there be some sort of

00:06:40.058 --> 00:06:40.658
federation liberation?

00:06:43.578 --> 00:06:45.160
JOCHEN BEKMANN: Federation
is liberated, could

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:46.580
you elaborate please?

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:47.510
AUDIENCE: So, that we
could federate with

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:49.778
a real Wave account?

00:06:49.778 --> 00:06:53.298
I thought at least they
was liberated only to the

00:06:53.298 --> 00:06:53.878
extent to the sandbox.

00:06:53.878 --> 00:06:54.338
JOCHEN BEKMANN: Right.

00:06:54.338 --> 00:06:54.660
OK.

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:57.798
So, yes, we don't have it
on GoogleWave.com, we have

00:06:57.798 --> 00:06:58.758
it on WaveSandbox.com.

00:06:59.178 --> 00:07:03.140
And, yes, we hope
they will be one.

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:06.300
We don't have an exact
timeline, but hopefully

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:07.456
it will be soon.

00:07:07.456 --> 00:07:10.508
UNKNOWN: Months.

00:07:10.508 --> 00:07:14.220
DAN PETERSON: So the thing with
federating on Google Wave, it

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:16.160
is something that treally
want to do soon.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.420
Unfortunately, there's a
lot of work to be done

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:19.720
at the model level.

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:21.278
Because, it's rather
complicated if we were to be

00:07:21.278 --> 00:07:24.638
sort of changing the model
after the fact of the

00:07:24.638 --> 00:07:25.858
that port being open.

00:07:25.858 --> 00:07:28.058
And, so it is something we want
to address, but we also need to

00:07:28.058 --> 00:07:30.878
sort of keep iterating through
the use cases of the model.

00:07:30.878 --> 00:07:32.738
So, we can make sure there
aren't going to be major

00:07:32.738 --> 00:07:34.178
changes after that point, or
at least they're backwards

00:07:34.178 --> 00:07:35.458
compatible and it
can be graceful.

00:07:35.458 --> 00:07:39.560
JOCHEN BEKMANN: And, the
major problem is that all

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:43.038
of the changes in Waves are
signed cryptographically.

00:07:43.038 --> 00:07:45.118
It's really hard to do
migration with a distributive

00:07:45.118 --> 00:07:48.388
system where, you know, you
can't ask different servers

00:07:48.388 --> 00:07:51.458
to migrate their data.

00:07:51.458 --> 00:07:51.600
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:54.820
Do you have a plan for
developing Gadget API?

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:58.980
There are so much ways where
it can [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:02.938
For instance, accessing the
parent iFrame, parent window,

00:08:02.938 --> 00:08:08.638
having those cool name pages
inside a gadget, and so on.

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:10.240
What are your plans
for updating Gadget

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:14.558
API in Google 8?
197
00:08:14,558 --&gt; 00:08:14,464
DOUWE OSINGA: Gadget API?

00:08:14.464 --> 00:08:14.918
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:08:14.918 --> 00:08:15.918
DOUWE OSINGA: What

00:08:15.918 --> 00:08:16.038
would you like to see?

00:08:16.038 --> 00:08:19.958
AUDIENCE: First, I would like
to access the parent scroll,

00:08:19.958 --> 00:08:20.580
the parent window scroll.

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:23.360
Because, I'm now doing crazy
hacks just to get the

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:27.638
parent window scroll Like
positioning text area

00:08:27.638 --> 00:08:29.378
and setting focus to it.

00:08:29.378 --> 00:08:31.558
So, the browser can scroll.

00:08:32.138 --> 00:08:37.458
And, now I implemented name
pages on my own, but they are

00:08:37.458 --> 00:08:38.018
not so good, and [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:38.018 --> 00:08:38.918
needed.

00:08:40.898 --> 00:08:43.500
DOUWE OSINGA: Yeah, we
should totally do that.

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:45.020
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER]

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:50.400
What are your plans about it?

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:52.400
PAMELA FOX: Yeah, We've heard
that there's definitely been a

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:55.140
lot of people who are running
into issues with Gadgets, when

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:57.260
they have Gadgets that take
up like a large canvas.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:58.960
And, there's
scrolling involved.

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:00.980
And, there's panning.

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:02.800
And, so the things we're
looking into is stuff like

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:04.180
letting Gadgets full
screen themselves.

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:05.780
Right.

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:08.740
And, also giving Gadgets,
you know, more control

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:09.640
over where the Wave is.

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:12.500
So, I don't think we
necessarily give you access

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.058
to the parent, because
that's kind of dangerous.

00:09:14.058 --> 00:09:17.400
But, we would give you a method
that says like you need to

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.540
scroll to this position now.

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:20.600
Right.

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:22.380
AUDIENCE: Is there
approximate schedule.

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:25.280
When can we expect it?

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:28.280
Next year or next month?

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:29.400
PAMELA FOX: Months.

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:30.452
AUDIENCE: Months.

00:09:30.452 --> 00:09:30.980
OK.

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:32.780
And, according to
security issue.

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:38.380
As a user I'm a bit scared that
Gadgets can make any request

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:39.640
to any public server.

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:43.540
So, it can transfer any of my
personal information that

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:46.800
Google Wave, Gadget API
they provide a lot of

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:47.540
information of me.

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:51.258
So, is there any ability for
the user to control what

00:09:51.258 --> 00:09:53.520
information can be transferred.

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:53.720
DOUWE OSINGA: Yes.

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:58.408
So we have plans, and I'm
afraid we have been saying

00:09:58.408 --> 00:10:02.280
that for too long to do
something about that.

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:08.420
Basically there is this other
project in Google that allows

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:09.220
you to lockdown JavaScripts.

00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:14.480
And, so we will start using
that for the subset of

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:18.020
the gadget, where this
would be a concern.

00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:21.974
And, for the other ones,
we would have a sort

00:10:21.974 --> 00:10:24.400
of opt-in scheme.

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:25.140
AUDIENCE: Thank you.
252
00:10:25,14 --&gt; 00:10:25,084
PAMELA FOX: Yeah.

00:10:25.084 --> 00:10:26.660
That project is called Taha.

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:28.420
So, if want you could open
search project so you

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:29.400
can actually check out.

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:31.000
It's being used for
various Gadgets.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:31.978
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:10:31.978 --> 00:10:34.138
And what will be response for
me as a Gadget developer.

00:10:34.138 --> 00:10:37.158
So, first my Gadget is
gathering Google Wave IDs

00:10:37.158 --> 00:10:39.738
and storing it in an
external SQL server.

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:45.520
So, what will be response to
my Gadget if user decided to

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:47.480
protect this information.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.540
DOUWE OSINGA: Well, then
you wouldn't be able

00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:51.100
to talk to children.

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:51.520
AUDIENCE: Ah-ha.

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:56.500
So, I will be just able to
make any adjunct requests

00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:58.500
to external servers?

00:10:58.500 --> 00:10:59.440
DOUWE OSINGA: Well, so, we
haven't really settled down

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:02.868
on what exactly what
this API will be.

00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:08.480
But, I think vaguely our plans
are to have a sort of a more

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:09.460
open thing, where you can do
all kinds of things, but

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:12.460
where you have to first get
permission from the user.

00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:17.400
And, have a lockdown API where
the user doesn't have to open.

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:20.740
But, lets you build as a
developer, small controls

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:22.520
that, you know, don't need
to make these outside calls.

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:23.080
AUDIENCE: Yeah, yeah.

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:24.420
this third question.

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:28.678
I remember that actually why I
need access -- I'm finished --

00:11:28.678 --> 00:11:31.038
why I need to access the
server, just I need to store

00:11:31.038 --> 00:11:34.258
some information for user,
not for Blimp, not for

00:11:34.258 --> 00:11:35.400
Gadget but for user.

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:38.418
Is there plans for -- I need
storage for user users.

00:11:38.418 --> 00:11:41.700
DOUWE OSINGA: Yes, we
have actually silently
284
00:11:41,7 --&gt; 00:11:41,16
promoting them.
285
00:11:42,54 --&gt; 00:11:42,34
PAMELA FOX: Oh yeah.
286
00:11:43,4 --&gt; 00:11:43,34
Sorry.

00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:45.480
I didn't do them.

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:45.740
OK.

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:49.960
So, we did launch Private
Gadget State API a few weeks.

00:11:49.538 --> 00:11:50.820
It's in the reference.

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:54.460
So, you can actually store
information pertinent to the

00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:57.518
user, like maybe notes that
the user has left in Gadget

00:11:57.518 --> 00:12:01.160
that's only for them, or
personal preferences.

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:05.280
So, you can start using
that for a few use cases.

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:07.240
AUDIENCE: Is it Wave wide?

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:07.460
So --

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:10.730
PAMELA FOX: No, that one, the
private Gadget State API is

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:13.460
just per that Gadget instance.

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:15.636
So, you're also asking about
a Wave-wide thing, because

00:12:15.636 --> 00:12:15.720
--

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:19.740
AUDIENCE: I need to store
some personal things.

00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:21.200
PAMELA FOX: Yeah, So, I
think we could look into a

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:24.100
Wave-wide settings as well.

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:24.260
Yeah, yeah.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:25.472
I mean generally a

00:12:25.472 --> 00:12:27.418
Wave has more work to do
in the settings area.

00:12:27.418 --> 00:12:30.720
And, once we see more settings
for different parts of Wave, we

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:33.760
can bring that into Gadgets
and Robots as well.

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:33.880
AUDIENCE:

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:33.940
OK.

00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:34.760
Thank you.

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:37.320
DAN PETERSON: Yeah, I do want
to make sure to jump into the

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:38.700
moderator questions as well.

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:39.580
So, let's grab one from there.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.020
So, is there a plan to add
capability for Wave to allow

00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:44.980
contributions to Wave by
non-Wave users through

00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:54.160
email or IM service when
requested by a Wave user?

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.280
Is there a plan to add
capabilities for Wave users to

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:59.120
allow contributions to Wave by
non-Wave users through

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:04.280
email or IM service?

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:04.680
LARS RASMUSSEN: Yeah.

00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:08.100
So, we are working on a few
more email things ourselves,

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:11.860
so already you can get
email notification

00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:12.120
when a Wave changes.

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:15.980
We're just about to launch a
feature where you can add an e

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:17.380
mail address to a Wave as well.

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:20.700
And, then some content from the
Wave will go out in an email

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:22.900
with a link pointing
back to that Wave.

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.680
And, sometime later, I'm not
going to give any particular

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:29.540
time frame, but sometime later
we'll make it possible to

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:30.700
reply to those emails.

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:33.620
And, have the your reply
grafted into the Wave.

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:36.280
I think it's already possible
to have interactions in various

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:40.440
ways between email and Wave
written by extension

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:40.760
developers.

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:43.740
I saw someone wearing a
Mr-Ray t-shirt here.

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:45.940
You can check out
extensions like that.

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:50.660
And, maybe get inspired
by that as well.

00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:55.580
Yeah, Mr-Ray actually lets
people respond just by a

00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:59.040
statically rendered Wave
that they get a link

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:00.460
to in their email.

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:02.860
And, so, they don't have
to be Wave users at all.

00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:04.960
So, I used it for communicating
with some of my friends

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:05.760
who didn't have Wave.

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:09.620
So, if you want to check that
out, the Wave to people,

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:11.158
they'll be at the Wave
sandbox tomorrow.

00:14:11.158 --> 00:14:13.120
There he goes, there he is.

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:14.840
And, they created Mr- Ray.

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:16.820
So, they have some ideas
about, you know, what

00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:18.860
that that looks like.

00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:20.940
STEPHANIE HANNON: I just wanted
to add after a September 30th

00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:23.040
preview, we spend a lot of time
talking to our user surveys,

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:25.140
our users doing usability
studies, trying to figure out

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:27.700
what people wanted from Wave.

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:29.900
And, the top two categories we
either wan to see our Waves

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:33.660
in Gmail, or we want to
manage our email in Wave.

00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:37.600
How many of you guys want that?

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:38.720
Which one?

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:42.000
Both?

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:42.220
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:44.540
We want everyone to know that
we'd be very happy to have your

00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:45.760
Waves wherever you want them.

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:47.878
Like we, you know, we
saw the Buzz launch.

00:14:47.878 --> 00:14:49.600
And, Buzz started out as a
product integrated into Gmail.

00:14:50.918 --> 00:14:53.178
And, we'd be very happy if
Waves were inside of Gmail too.

00:14:53.178 --> 00:14:56.400
But, it's a significant
amount of engineering work.

00:14:56.400 --> 00:14:58.700
And, we've been focused on
the Waves experience itself,

00:14:58.700 --> 00:14:59.600
and making Waves great.

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:02.400
But, there is Gmail Apps, and
we're hoping that we can launch

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:04.800
some cool Apps that would let
us experiment with different

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:07.220
Waves to integrate into
other Google products.

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:09.658
And, see what users like, and
what sort of things they

00:15:09.658 --> 00:15:13.800
mean by integration.

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:14.680
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:17.760
Going back to the Gadget API,
one other thing that would be

00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:21.400
very useful for us is the
ability to have a Gadget take

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:23.900
the user to a different
Wave by its Wave ID.

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:27.940
DOUWE OSINGA: Yes.

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:30.360
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I mean we're
actually doing that now with an

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:33.960
ugly URL hacker that assumes
the structure of the like

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:35.620
restored Wave calling thin.

00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:37.860
But, you know, that doesn't
seem like something we

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:38.200
will rely on long term.

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:38.440
DOUWE OSINGA: No.

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:39.800
But, I'm aware.

00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:41.060
And, you know, we'll add this.

00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:43.360
And, this is, I think, you
know, we need to look at in a

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:48.100
wider thing a sort of stuff, a
Window management sort of stuff

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:50.220
that Gadget should have.

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:52.168
But, definitely.

00:15:58.700 --> 00:15:59.460
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:03.940
And, the other thing is just
now with Wave being opened to

00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:08.500
everybody, does that mean that
like people's Wave addresses

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:10.800
will now be Gmail.com
instead of GoogleWave?

00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:12.840
PAMELA FOX: No.

00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:15.020
There's still at
GoogleWave.com, but there's

00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:16.260
a one-to-one mapping.

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.660
So, on Stephanie@Gmail.com, I'm
also Stephanie@GoogleWave.com.

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:22.780
And, so, as of today anyone
can sign in with their

00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:23.360
existing Gmail account.

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:26.440
You know, they don't have to
put an actual GoogleWave.com

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:28.100
extension on sign in page.

00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:30.180
So, there's a one-to-one
mapping with those accounts.

00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:30.780
DAN PETERSON: OK.

00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:33.200
And, when you add a participant
to Wave, you can actually type

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:35.260
-- it will work you
out at Gmail.com.

00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:37.960
It will re-resolve it
at GoogleWave.com

00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:38.500
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:40.600
Great, yeah, that was
the main question.

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:42.700
Okay, thank you.

00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:44.100
DAN PETERSON: So, got another
question from moderator.

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:49.520
Is progress being made
on the mobile front?

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:52.000
LARS RASMUSSEN: So, I think the
biggest progress is that these

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.220
guys launching Data API, that
lets others build Liferay

00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:58.480
clients, or mobile.

00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:02.680
We are a little bit behind with
getting the full Wave client

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:03.460
to work on mobile devices.

00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:06.920
You can see how far we are if
you have a late model iPhone,

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:08.820
or a late model Android.

00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:11.340
Actually, try and go to
Wave.Google.com, and you'll

00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:13.480
see a thing saying that
we don't support it.

00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:15.300
Try clicking through, and
then you'll see exactly

00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:18.960
how far we are.

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:23.140
PAMELA FOX: And, once again,
the Wave 2 developers created a

00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:25.680
an Android App called WaveUp,
that let's you view

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:26.120
Wave and Android.

00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:29.100
Right now, using the Robot,
but I expect you to port

00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:32.540
that the Data APIs tonight.

00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:37.040
So, check it out tomorrow.

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:37.660
AUDIENCE: Hi guys.

00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:38.720
Thanks for your time today.

00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:40.540
Two parter.

00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:42.900
One, is could you talk a little
bit about the platform

00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:44.920
strategies as it relates to
other Enterprise portals,

00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:46.020
like Liferay, for example?

00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:47.720
And, also if you have any
plans in terms of SSO

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:51.420
integration support?

00:17:51.838 --> 00:17:54.900
LARS RASMUSSEN: I'm sorry, your
first question was about how?

00:17:54.660 --> 00:17:57.800
AUDIENCE: So, how -- are there
any plans, has there been any

00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:00.240
thought around how Wave
services could be integrated

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:04.460
with, or might replace or
compete with other Enterprise

00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:07.540
portal platforms that are used
for integrating systems

00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:09.600
in portal-like fashion?

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:11.800
LARS RASMUSSEN: I would say no.

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:14.940
We don't have any plans
in that regard just yet.

00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:16.640
What was your second question?

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:18.640
AUDIENCE: The follow on is, are
there any plans for single sign

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:24.140
on support standards, like Cast
or SiteMinder or OpenID,

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:26.220
potentially to be integrated so
that users could use other

00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:29.980
credentials to get
into the system?

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:30.220
LARS RASMUSSEN: I say no.

00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:32.860
I don't think that's something
we have plans for yet.

00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:34.920
So, No.

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:36.840
JOCHEN BEKMANN: So, what I
would say is that the

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:40.452
Federation product allows you
to have your own subversion,

00:18:40.452 --> 00:18:42.620
and you extend it.

00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:46.760
As far as supporting OpenID,
we have a very light way to

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:49.920
authentication mechanism that
we currently use for these

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:51.400
client that we will
be releasing.

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:55.760
However, anyone can take the
code that is out there, all

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:59.140
done some OpenID support,
and you're ready to go.

00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:04.520
This is still early days.
464
00:19:04,52 --&gt; 00:19:04,3
You know, fairly
experimental code.

00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:07.200
Hopefully it will grow into
something that we'll be able to

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:10.940
support this on wider platform.

00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:13.380
AUDIENCE: So, there's nothing
that would preclude somebody

00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:15.220
from using another
authentication later,

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:15.500
on top of Wave?

00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:16.560
JOCHEN BEKMANN: Would be fine.

00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:20.120
I mean, the server-to-server
sides has full support with,

00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:23.540
you know, certificates
between domains.

00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:27.320
And, it's up to domain, the
provided, to make sure that

00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:28.000
their users authenticate it.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.300
Authenticate to their
specification, so that

00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:33.004
OpenID, whatever is fine.

00:19:33.004 --> 00:19:34.118
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:35.020
There's one more --

00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:36.720
STEPHANIE HANNON:
Wait, there's Dr.
480
00:19:36,72 --&gt; 00:19:36,48
Wave, Dr.

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:37.240
Wave, ouuuuhh.

00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:39.948
AUDIENCE: You've got Dr.

00:19:39.948 --> 00:19:40.250
Wave up there?

00:19:40.402 --> 00:19:40.520
That's awesome.

00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:42.098
STEPHANIE HANNON: I know.

00:19:42.098 --> 00:19:43.968
GREG D'ALESANDRE: That's
another guy, I met him before.

00:19:44.252 --> 00:19:47.640
It's -- So, you can actually
do single sign on using

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:48.500
your Google Apps domain.

00:19:49.618 --> 00:19:51.220
You can set up single
sign on with that.

00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:53.760
Announcements, Wave can be
associated with your domain.

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:54.880
You can, therefore, do it that.

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:56.960
If you're interested.

00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:59.400
The other thing is we
have a talk tomorrow

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:00.640
about Google Wave.

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:03.740
In the Enterprise we're going
to be talking with sales

00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:05.278
forces as well to show some
of their integrations.

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:08.940
But, I think, the other thing
we're going to be talking about

00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:11.860
more is how you can use the new
active API with Robots to

00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:14.220
actually pull data from
other systems in Wave.

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:15.904
To try to make it more
the kind of portal you

00:20:15.904 --> 00:20:16.818
were talking about.

00:20:16.818 --> 00:20:17.014
AUDIENCE: Thanks guys.

00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:17.278
I appreciate it.

00:20:17.758 --> 00:20:19.880
GREG D'ALESANDRE: Sure.

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:21.740
DAN PETERSON: So, there's a
question from the moderator.

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:23.950
Is there already a way for
Wave users to embed their

00:20:23.950 --> 00:20:27.380
own moderator series and
Wave like you did here?

00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:31.680
PAMELA FOX: So, we created a
few special Gadgets for the

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:33.920
I/O Waves, and one of those
was a Google moderator.

00:20:34.558 --> 00:20:38.260
So, right now, the Gadget is
kind of specialized for I/O,

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:39.040
you know, has a few
things, hard coded.

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:43.280
But, we're working on both open
sourcing it, and also sticking

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:46.558
in the gallery so other
people can put moderator

00:20:46.558 --> 00:20:48.040
Gadgets in their Waves.

00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:50.560
That's an easy way to ask
questions, and sync it back

00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:55.720
to the moderator back end.

00:20:55.720 --> 00:21:03.020
AUDIENCE: Will Gmail contextual
Gadgets work in Wave?

00:21:03.020 --> 00:21:08.700
DAN PETERSON: So, I think that
the set of Gadget features

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:11.480
involved there is slightly
different, and so I don't think

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:12.820
they'll work right
out of the box.

00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:17.060
We should investigate
that more.

00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:18.720
DOUWE OSINGA: I'm pretty sure
as Gadgets they would work, but

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:24.548
we don't have the partnering
matching setup to do it,

00:21:24.548 --> 00:21:25.160
but you can probably.

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:25.442
STEPHANIE HANNON: I want to
make sure we understood

00:21:25.442 --> 00:21:25.820
what you meant.

00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:29.798
Do you mean how when you have
a UPS number or an address

00:21:29.798 --> 00:21:31.840
inside of a Gmail?

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:33.700
Do you mean how there's
certain text we recognize in

00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:35.080
Gmail, we show kind of --

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:35.484
AUDIENCE:

00:21:35.484 --> 00:21:42.560
[INAUDIBLE]

00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:45.360
DAN PETERSON: So, I can't quite
tell if the question is if

00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:49.640
somebody were to build it for
Gmail's contact inbox, or if

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:50.280
somebody were building
it for Wave.

00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:52.072
Which direction are
you trying to go?

00:21:52.072 --> 00:21:55.860
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:55.860 --> 00:22:30.780
DAN PETERSON: Absolutely.

00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:32.800
PAMELA FOX: So, you think the
basic idea of contextual

00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:35.540
Gadgets from what I see it, is
that it's recognizing something

00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:38.460
in your email, and doing
something smart with it.

00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:41.080
So, this is something that
Robots can do today.

00:22:41.080 --> 00:22:44.920
You can actually -- we just put
the documentation out for regex

00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:48.358
hook, which means that if it
recognizes a pattern, it'll

00:22:48.358 --> 00:22:49.618
give you a little light bulb.

00:22:49.618 --> 00:22:51.818
And, say do you want to
run this extension.

00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:51.258
Right.

00:22:51.258 --> 00:22:54.938
Add that an extension, and then
that extension does something

00:22:54.938 --> 00:22:55.760
with that bit of content.

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:56.020
Right.

00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:58.678
So, that's a similar
experience.

00:22:58.678 --> 00:23:00.298
There, we're just
triggering a regex hook.

00:23:00.298 --> 00:23:03.400
But, in the future, I'd imagine
getting the trigger on other

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:05.618
kind of hooks, like you know,
we found an address or

00:23:05.618 --> 00:23:07.578
some other piece of data.
556
00:23:07,578 --&gt; 00:23:07,298
Like that.

00:23:07.298 --> 00:23:10.260
And, I think the development
strategy is going
558
00:23:10,26 --&gt; 00:23:10,08
to be different.

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:12.140
Because, we are two entirely
different environment.

00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:15.380
But, I think the user
experience is fairly similar.

00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:19.160
Its just being smart about
finding stuff in your content.

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:22.460
And, giving the user something
that they can do with it.

00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:32.060
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:34.780
PAMELA FOX: Well, I'm sure
we both use the Gadget API.

00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:36.580
So, that part.

00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:39.100
I think the part that's
different is the non-Gadget

00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:40.640
part, which is how you're
actually doing the matching,

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:43.480
and adding it on,
and all of that.

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:44.220
DAN PETERSON: At the
base layer, it is

00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:45.000
the same Gadget API.

00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:47.020
It's just that there are
different features involved.

00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:50.460
And, then the different sort
of processing mechanisms.

00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:53.292
STEPHANIE HANNON: I just want
to stress that all 8 of us

00:23:53.292 --> 00:23:55.140
are just off the plane from
Sydney, and anyone who follows

00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:57.860
a Wave, know that we kind of
work independently from

00:23:57.860 --> 00:23:58.080
the rest of Google.

00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:01.560
And, that mean sometimes
we aren't on the leading

00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:03.120
edge of things that other
product teams are doing.

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:05.180
But, we can definitely answer
more details around this.

00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:07.780
We can learn more about the
Gmail contextual stuff, and put

00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:09.480
it in our developer help form.

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:10.240
Right Pamela?
583
00:24:10,24 --&gt; 00:24:10,18
PAMELA FOX: Yeah, sure.

00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:10.860
Yes.

00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:14.840
STEPHANIE HANNON: We can
put more detail there.

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:17.100
AUDIENCE: Hey, I got
a couple questions.

00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:20.920
First of all, the sort of
Robot to robot interaction.

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:25.560
Is that coming, are we going
to see it anytime soon.

00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:28.460
DOUWE OSINGA: It's
a little tricky.

00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:30.120
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:33.600
DOUWE OSINGA: So, yeah, the
question was Robot to the Robot

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:38.180
communication, and what we're
going to do about that?

00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:41.094
PAMELA FOX: Right now Robots
can actually hear events

00:24:41.094 --> 00:24:41.996
from other robots.
595
00:24:41,996 --&gt; 00:24:41,9
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:43.660
DOUWE OSINGA:

00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:47.598
The intent behind it is
to avoid ugly loops.

00:24:47.598 --> 00:24:47.778
AUDIENCE: Yeah.
599
00:24:47,778 --&gt; 00:24:47,598
DOUWE OSINGA: Right.

00:24:47.598 --> 00:24:49.020
AUDIENCE: Well obviously yeah.

00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:52.640
Would it be possible to have
like a maximum recursion

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:52.860
depth, or something.

00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:56.380
So that we could still
communicate through the Wave

00:24:56.380 --> 00:25:02.940
using robots, but obviously
not get into an ugly loop.

00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:07.960
DOUWE OSINGA: Anything is
possible, but -- it's

00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:09.100
somewhat tricky to solve.

00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:13.060
So, we have to way it against
other feature requests.

00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:18.118
You make a lot of noise and
build an Android App and stuff.

00:25:18.118 --> 00:25:18.198
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:25:18.198 --> 00:25:18.240
Yeah.

00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:23.240
The second question is now that
you sort of opened up to the,

00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:27.020
you know, more APIs to the
inbox sort of integrating

00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:29.100
more tightly with users.

00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:33.720
Are we going to see the ability
to be able to proxy for proper

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:37.380
users, so I can send a message
from a robot using my actual

00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:41.740
account into a Wave?

00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:46.520
DOUWE OSINGA: You mean write
access to the Data API or --

00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:47.880
AUDIENCE: No.

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:49.380
So with the Robot at the
moment, you've got the

00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:51.420
option to proxy for.

00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:53.858
So you can say I'm
proxying for this user.

00:25:53.858 --> 00:25:54.740
DOUWE OSINGA: Yes.
623
00:25:54,74 --&gt; 00:25:54,34
AUDIENCE: But,

00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:57.532
will it be possible to a
proxy for an actual Wave

00:25:57.532 --> 00:25:57.620
user?

00:25:57.620 --> 00:26:01.420
Well, so if you have the auth
of integration stuff from the

00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:04.480
user, then your Robot can just
use that stuff to sign it

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:07.640
outgoing request and it will
be proxying for that user.

00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:09.358
AUDIENCE: Oh brilliant.

00:26:09.358 --> 00:26:11.820
That's with the new API?
631
00:26:12,46 --&gt; 00:26:12
Yeah.

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:21.400
We're a little unsure when
we'll have the ability to

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:29.040
robots to write on behalf of
the user but that will be soon.

00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:29.172
AUDIENCE: Sweet.

00:26:29.172 --> 00:26:29.240
OK.

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:30.220
Thank you.

00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:33.520
DAN PETERSON: A common
theme of weeks or months.

00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:35.700
So, let's grab a question
from moderator.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:39.740
Are there any plans for
integrating Google Wave with

00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:42.300
more features from Docs?

00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:44.880
Sorry there is little of a URL
escaping problem with our

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:48.578
moderator Gadget which is
something we're working on.

00:26:48.578 --> 00:26:51.200
Google Wave and Google Docs
is sort of the question of

00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:53.140
integration opportunities.

00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:57.140
LARS RASMUSSEN: So, I think
you'll see fairly soon it's

00:26:57.140 --> 00:27:01.400
just the ability to convert
between the two products.

00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:04.040
Is the person who asked
the question in the room?

00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:06.360
DAN PETERSON: I know this
is from the Wave so

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:07.518
I'm not entirely sure.

00:27:07.518 --> 00:27:08.238
LARS RASMUSSEN: They might
still be in the room though.

00:27:08.238 --> 00:27:12.680
I'm just wondering which
particular feature the

00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:13.124
person is thinking about.

00:27:13.212 --> 00:27:13.300
OK.

00:27:13.388 --> 00:27:23.680
They're not here.

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:25.540
PAMELA FOX: So,
basically, export sync,

00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:32.000
that's, you know --

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.760
DAN PETERSON: So we're working
on exporting and printing Wave.

00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:37.140
And that you'll
see within weeks.

00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:39.792
Including exporting
over to Google Docs.

00:27:39.006 --> 00:27:42.120
They have better formatting
features that Google Wave has.

00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:44.200
So it will be
collaborated on content.

00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:46.960
In Wave you'll be
able to export

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:47.520
it over there.

00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:52.020
To better formatting for
printing and so on.

00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:54.140
DAN PETERSON: Pamela you want
to mention Fairy as well?

00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:55.820
PAMELA FOX: Yeah.

00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:57.600
Once again there is an
extension that you can

00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:00.920
use today to export and
sync to Google Docs.

00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:03.200
And it just uses the
Google Docs Data API.

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:06.200
It let's you authenticate
and then save to there.

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:09.300
I just used it this morning for
exporting something to Docs,

00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:13.040
so I could do a little more
formatting and print it out.

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:15.224
That's called Fairy and
you can find it in the

00:28:15.224 --> 00:28:16.058
extensions Gallery.

00:28:16.058 --> 00:28:19.120
STEPHANIE HANNON: I'm just
going to ask Lars the tough

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:19.480
question which I think
was implicit in there.

00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:23.180
Which is a few weeks ago Google
Docs launched a really cool

00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:25.240
feature of live typing,
similar to Wave.

00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:29.120
And, are these products
on a similar path?

00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:30.282
What's the future?

00:28:30.484 --> 00:28:32.780
Go.

00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:33.318
LARS RASMUSSEN: I don't know.

00:28:33.318 --> 00:28:34.440
I have much better
tough questions.

00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:34.640
Yes.

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:36.598
So, we are actually working
very closely with the Docs

00:28:36.598 --> 00:28:39.000
team to make the live
typing work over in Docs.

00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:43.038
The two parts that still have
quite a different focus.

00:28:43.038 --> 00:28:43.740
Right.

00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:45.700
So it means Wave is a place
that, you know, used to

00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:46.860
coordinate all of your work.

00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:50.900
It's much more about
communication and collaboration

00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:51.660
in a single space.

00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:55.618
Whereas the Docs team our focus
is mostly on being able to

00:28:55.618 --> 00:29:00.620
produce high fidelity documents
for printing, for exploring and

00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:02.900
importing to and from other
document formats like

00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:04.560
Works and PDF and so on.

00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:08.640
The question of how tightly
we should integrate the two

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:10.598
products in the future, is
something that we're starting

00:29:10.598 --> 00:29:11.460
to talk to them about.

00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:14.220
I think, and this is the way
Google operates in general.

00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:15.880
We really want to
hear from you guys.

00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:18.320
Just like we were asking you
earlier whether a Wave should

00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:20.500
live inside of Gmail.

00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:25.200
And you could imagine that over
time all of those formatting

00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:28.500
features are available inside
of Google Wave or maybe

00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:28.700
the other way around.

00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:31.140
But all of the communication
features of Wave are

00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:31.840
inside Google Docs.

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:33.140
We really truly don't know yet.

00:29:33.140 --> 00:29:36.080
And, so if you have
opinions don't be shy

00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:39.000
to share them with us.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.800
DAN PETERSON: So the next
question is an interesting one.

00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:43.480
What are the Google Wave
Teams thoughts on long-term

00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:44.680
archive issues of Wave?

00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:47.700
I'm concerned that a Wave using
Gadget heavily will become

00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:50.020
unintelligible a few years down
the line, when the Gadget

00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:57.598
provider goes bust, or there's
incompatibility issues.

00:29:57.598 --> 00:29:59.838
GREG D'ALESANDRE: So, this is
actually something that a lot

00:29:59.838 --> 00:30:01.680
of businesses bring
up with us as well.

00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:03.500
Making sure their sort
of data sticks around.

00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:07.520
Some of the things we are doing
-- eventually you will be able

00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:11.500
to export to other formats,
such as PDF, etc.

00:30:12.538 --> 00:30:15.940
So, we've looked into being
able to do appropriate

00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:17.098
renderings of Gadgets
in those formats.

00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:20.340
And, so if this is something
that you're concerned about

00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:23.480
making sure you have archive,
searchable copies of

00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:25.420
everything, a lot of businesses
do that sort of thing where

00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:29.478
they export everything to PDF
or some other format

00:30:29.478 --> 00:30:31.100
periodically.

00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:33.420
You know we obviously can't
control what the Gadget

00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:36.340
developers do in terms of
either going to, you know,

00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:37.280
keep their Gadgets around.

00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:38.140
That sort of thing.

00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:43.478
But, the other thing that we're
looking for -- and I'm only

00:30:43.478 --> 00:30:46.420
assuming his question is geared
towards business usage.

00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:49.960
For businesses, a lot of times
what they tend to do, they'll

00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:54.038
tend to make internal versions
of Gadgets specifically

00:30:54.038 --> 00:30:55.518
for that reason.

00:30:55.518 --> 00:30:58.040
So, they don't have to
worry about if something

00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:03.740
changes on the outside.

00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:04.660
DAN PETERSON: Any more on that
question, or we can take

00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:07.720
another one from moderator?

00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:08.358
Alright.

00:31:08.358 --> 00:31:10.598
What plans are there for
getting more people

00:31:10.598 --> 00:31:13.620
interested in using Wave?

00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:15.780
LARS RASMUSSEN: So I guess
we've done probably the biggest

00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:18.458
thing we could do along those
lines today, by just opening

00:31:18.458 --> 00:31:19.740
it up for everyone.

00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:24.780
I think this would be obvious
that just the barriers that we

00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:27.760
actually put in there on
purpose to make it hard for

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:28.240
people to get in there.

00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:31.560
Remember six months ago, you
remember how Wave was like.

00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:34.040
At the time we could actually
only scale to about

00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:35.740
a few 100,000 users.

00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:39.838
had 5 million or so people
wanting to try it out.

00:31:39.838 --> 00:31:41.598
So, we put in these barriers.

00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:43.940
And, we have just
removed them today.

00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:46.098
So, it's a lot easier for you
to get your whole team on Wave.

00:31:46.098 --> 00:31:48.118
To get your friends
or family on Wave.

00:31:48.118 --> 00:31:50.820
We'll make it even easier in a
couple weeks, where you can

00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:53.240
just throw an email address
on a particular Wave.

00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:55.718
And, it will get a
link to that Wave.

00:31:55.718 --> 00:31:56.358
And they can click it.

00:31:56.358 --> 00:31:58.940
And, they'll look at --
I don't know if you pop

00:31:58.940 --> 00:32:00.780
that in the keynote.

00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:03.280
But, there's a UI now for
Wave, where you just

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:04.280
see that single Wave.

00:32:04.580 --> 00:32:06.080
So, it's a lot more.

00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:06.420
So,

00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:09.040
I get lot less daunting
for new user to look at.

00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:12.680
But, really I think we have
definitely learned, and

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:13.626
you guys would have felt

00:32:13.626 --> 00:32:17.100
this too, during this
invitation only preview

00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:18.486
period, is that we need
to do a lot more work.

00:32:18.692 --> 00:32:21.640
Help people understand what
Wave is, and what it's good

00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:23.058
for, and how to use
it, and so on.

00:32:23.058 --> 00:32:25.700
And, part of that is just
an explanation of Wave.

00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:29.040
When we showed Wave first, we
showed this very long demo of

00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:32.560
how Wave might one day in the
future play a role in a lot

00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:33.580
of different contexts.

00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:35.100
And, we put it up there.

00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:38.960
And, we have found that very
much the sweet spot the early

00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:43.100
use cases that are merging for
waves are all about groups

00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:44.340
collaborating on
their projects.

00:32:44.340 --> 00:32:47.558
And, so we can know much more,
in a much more focused way,

00:32:47.558 --> 00:32:50.960
make those kinds of usage
scenarios work really well.

00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:51.720
And, that's what we've
been doing for the

00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:52.140
past couple of months.

00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:55.040
And, the reason that we are
choosing to open it up at this

00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:58.358
point is that increasingly
we're hearing from people that

00:32:58.358 --> 00:33:00.818
wow, I was kicking these
tires a while ago.

00:33:00.818 --> 00:33:01.280
It looked interesting.

00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:04.780
But, now it's actively starting
to get good enough to

00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:05.118
get real work done.

00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:08.900
The other obvious answer to the
question is that we're going to

00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:13.278
try and help you guys build
really cool stuff with Waves

00:33:13.278 --> 00:33:16.038
which will get more people
interested in using Waves.

00:33:16.038 --> 00:33:21.660
I think for example if the
Embed API takes off, and people

00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:25.318
start stumbling over Waves all
around the web, and seeing this

00:33:25.318 --> 00:33:29.800
live and incredible, probably
rich engagement with each

00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:33.300
other, then that in itself will
draw more people to Wave.

00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:36.300
It was something we've
observed with maps.

00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:38.520
Which a lot of us
worked on Maps before.

00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:41.320
We think that most users
actually saw their first Google

00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:43.920
Maps on some other site
that had embedded a Map.

00:33:44.838 --> 00:33:46.358
Rather than going to
Maps.Google.com.

00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:50.760
PAMELA FOX: I think another
thing that we did was

00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:52.720
add the templates.

00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:55.260
Because one of the big things
is that users, once they

00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:56.980
actually had people on Wave,
they didn't actually know

00:33:56.980 --> 00:33:58.140
what to do with Wave.

00:33:58.140 --> 00:34:00.100
Because it was, you know, maybe
we weren't clear in the

00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:02.140
beginning, or we didn't know
ourselves what is great for.

00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:02.420
Right.

00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:04.200
So once we figured it out.

00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:05.400
We created these templates.

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:08.200
So now when you sign into Wave
you'll see six templates on the

00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:11.818
side that's like new document,
new brainstorming, new task

00:34:11.818 --> 00:34:13.238
tracking, new event planning.

00:34:13.238 --> 00:34:15.358
And those are some of
the people's favorite

00:34:15.358 --> 00:34:16.678
use cases of Wave.

00:34:16.678 --> 00:34:17.790
And, you know,
somebody signs in

00:34:17.790 --> 00:34:18.638
they see that.

00:34:18.638 --> 00:34:20.540
And, before maybe they
didn't know what exactly

00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:20.780
to do with Wave.

00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:22.680
Maybe they're just chatting.

00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:24.320
But, now they think, oh
I can use this to track

00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:25.620
my meeting notes right.

00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:28.760
So I think that templates may
be our going away towards

00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:30.660
educating users and getting
them thinking that this is

00:34:30.660 --> 00:34:34.778
something they can actually
use and want to use.

00:34:34.778 --> 00:34:35.778
STEPHANIE HANNON: And, sort of
a tangent, but I think it's

00:34:35.778 --> 00:34:39.200
important on that is we want to
make those templates

00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:39.440
customizable.

00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:41.652
So, today it's the six we
836
00:34:41,652 --&gt; 00:34:41,378
pick.

00:34:41.378 --> 00:34:44.298
But, you know, our team does
all of our work inside of Wave.

00:34:44.518 --> 00:34:46.398
And, if we have a UX review
temple and a production release

00:34:46.398 --> 00:34:49.440
kind of template, and all these
different templates we copy

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:51.220
over and over again, and we
want to put those right on the

00:34:51.220 --> 00:34:54.340
blank Wave panel so we can
easily initiate them.

00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:56.960
And, we also want to let people
hook in their favorite

00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:58.700
extensions, so that they just
always want to initiate a Wave

00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:00.418
with a certain extension
they can do that easily.

00:35:00.418 --> 00:35:01.458
So, I just wanted
to highlight that.

00:35:01.458 --> 00:35:01.698
PAMELA FOX: Yeah.

00:35:01.698 --> 00:35:04.200
STEPHANIE HANNON: Because I
think the templates we put

00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:04.590
there are a basic start.

00:35:04.590 --> 00:35:05.020
And they're helping people
figure out what to do

00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:06.558
when they get in Wave.

00:35:06.558 --> 00:35:11.678
But, for power users we want to
make them more customizable.

00:35:11.678 --> 00:35:13.840
AUDIENCE: Hi Jarrod
from Away Fund.

00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:15.162
It's really, really awesome
to see that you've opened

00:35:15.162 --> 00:35:16.260
it up to everybody.

00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:18.840
That was always my issue is I
want to have a Wave, but

00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:20.898
there's two people that don't
use it and that's that.

00:35:20.898 --> 00:35:23.178
Because were doing
a lot of meetings.

00:35:23.178 --> 00:35:25.280
But, at think that Wave has
an incredible potential

00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:27.398
for changing the workflow
in organizations.

00:35:27.398 --> 00:35:29.058
It's neat that Waves
sort of spread through

00:35:29.058 --> 00:35:30.458
Google and teams.

00:35:30.458 --> 00:35:33.518
And, I think that it has that
potential to do that, you

00:35:33.518 --> 00:35:34.080
know, just in general.

00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:37.420
But, I don't think that the
initial experience, even with

00:35:37.420 --> 00:35:40.020
templates and with, you know,
a couple of initial Waves

00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:42.440
that you get is enough.

00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:44.560
Because I think most Google
products kind of takes an

00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:47.700
existing metaphor like
email, or maps, or

00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:48.100
whatever it happens to be.

00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:49.960
And, they sort of change
it a little bit.

00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:51.460
But, you sort of have a
paradigm behind you.

00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:54.580
Whereas Wave you could sort of
say that about Wiki, but it's

00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:55.980
combining a lot of things.

00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:58.898
So I'm curious what you're
looking to do to maybe break

00:35:58.898 --> 00:36:01.780
outside of some of the way that
Google approach things, in

00:36:01.780 --> 00:36:03.478
terms of how you create that
initial experience, you know.

00:36:03.478 --> 00:36:05.030
Like if you think of a
traditional web app like I

00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:07.820
might create or someone in this
room creates, they probably do

00:36:07.820 --> 00:36:10.378
things where they kind of get a
little more in the users face.

00:36:10.378 --> 00:36:13.938
And say, do this first, or
invite these people first.

00:36:13.938 --> 00:36:17.698
Or, just things that you could
do that I think really educate

00:36:17.698 --> 00:36:19.478
the user about how their
workload can change the

00:36:19.478 --> 00:36:23.458
potential benefits that go
beyond templates, and pure

00:36:23.458 --> 00:36:25.724
text, and even just some of the
videos that you did that you're

00:36:25.724 --> 00:36:26.960
about to answer this question.

00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:27.780
So, I'm just curious
what you're going

00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:31.678
to do to make that experience
educate on workflow.

00:36:31.678 --> 00:36:32.840
Because, I think it
could be wonderful.

00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:35.898
GREG D'ALESANDRE: So, I think
you actually did a really good

00:36:35.898 --> 00:36:38.718
job of describing in some of th
things we're looking

00:36:38.718 --> 00:36:39.360
towards doing.

00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:45.718
Because we see that people are
using Wave in sort of small

00:36:45.718 --> 00:36:47.760
groups to get things done, a
lot of what this means

00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:48.140
really is workflows.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.598
But, what kind of happens with
workflow is you have some

00:36:52.598 --> 00:36:55.860
people -- and I suspect many of
you in this room -- who sees

00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:59.590
something new and powerful, and
sort of broad that you can

00:36:59.590 --> 00:37:00.178
do a lot of things with.

00:37:00.178 --> 00:37:02.898
And, are able to very quickly
imagine what you can do

00:37:02.898 --> 00:37:04.998
with it, and then start
making it happened.

00:37:04.998 --> 00:37:05.458
There's the flip side.

00:37:05.458 --> 00:37:07.378
There's a lot of people who
when they see something like

00:37:07.378 --> 00:37:08.820
that they're frightened.

00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:10.480
And, they're like this
is something new.

00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:10.600
I don't get it.

00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:11.820
I don't want to get it.

00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:13.320
I don't want to have to
learn something new.

00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:16.080
And, so what we're trying to do
is put the tools in the hands

00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:19.198
of the people like you, who
will understand what it is and

00:37:19.198 --> 00:37:23.380
have a vision for what it is,
to draw those people in and put

00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:24.000
more things in their face.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.640
And, this is how Stephanie
referred to some of the

00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:29.980
templates to be able to
create things for them.

00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:33.060
But, even more so allowing.

00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:35.820
And, so one of the things we
are starting to put a lot more

00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:37.438
work into is group support.

00:37:38.538 --> 00:37:43.800
So, that you can have full
groups using Wave, and allowing

00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:46.020
the person that sets that group
up, to really tailor the

00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:48.160
experience for those
users a little more.

00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:50.300
And, kind of get them started
and get them on board.
921
00:37:50,3 --&gt; 00:37:50,124
Because, I

00:37:50.124 --> 00:37:53.520
think we can do a lot of things
to explain sort of Wave in

00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:56.698
general to people, but I think
the key really is the people

00:37:56.698 --> 00:37:59.838
who are heading up those
workflows and projects in

00:37:59.838 --> 00:38:03.578
groups, to be able to sort of
set it up for the people to

00:38:03.578 --> 00:38:07.340
make it more meaningful
to them directly.

00:38:07.098 --> 00:38:08.760
AUDIENCE: Just as a thought.

00:38:09.138 --> 00:38:11.018
I feel like you have obviously
a pretty large group

00:38:11.018 --> 00:38:13.198
of intelligent people.

00:38:13.478 --> 00:38:15.840
And, you have the ability
to really change workflow.

00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:18.780
And, I would consider things
like looking how to --

00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:19.960
you know, from a machine
learning perspective.

00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:21.580
I know you guys have a
whole NLP team with Casey

00:38:21.580 --> 00:38:22.540
and all those people.

00:38:24.518 --> 00:38:27.258
Like look at what people are
doing, and do something

00:38:27.258 --> 00:38:28.518
reactive in response to
that through some sort of

00:38:28.518 --> 00:38:30.700
JERP sequence of email.

00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:32.700
The idea of -- I know that
Google does a really good

00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:34.400
job of sort of getting
out of people's way.

00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:38.100
But, I feel like Wave really
can be instrumental in changing

00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:42.180
people's behavior in a way that
really reduces redundancy in

00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:43.440
organizations, and
creates knowledge.

00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:46.420
And, I think you could do that
through JERP sequences in terms

00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:49.800
of education overtime, or also
through just figuring out

00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:51.900
kind of some patterns and
how they're using it.

00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:54.938
And, then doing education
response to that.

00:38:54.938 --> 00:38:56.472
It's just different than
other Google products

00:38:56.472 --> 00:38:57.378
and you could do that.

00:38:57.378 --> 00:38:59.878
LARS RASMUSSEN: I think
you're absolutely right.

00:38:59.878 --> 00:39:02.338
And, it is definitely an
area we are still weak in.

00:39:02.338 --> 00:39:05.198
Even though we're a little
bit better than in the past.

00:39:05.198 --> 00:39:09.618
I don't know if you saw this,
but just this morning, we added

00:39:09.618 --> 00:39:13.060
three little tutorials to
that saying Welcome Panel.

00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:14.860
If you click one of them,
there's a link below

00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:15.906
the templates.

00:39:15.972 --> 00:39:17.760
If you click it, it
kind of unfolds.

00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:19.920
And, then you click a tutorial
you get a UI where you just

00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:21.640
have a single Wave that
we pre-populated.

00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:25.558
And, a bunch of simple
steps you can execute

00:39:25.558 --> 00:39:26.118
over on the left.

00:39:26.118 --> 00:39:28.878
It's still all very
static content.

00:39:28.878 --> 00:39:31.518
We are actually working on --
I don't know if I'm suppose

00:39:31.518 --> 00:39:32.258
to tell you what we're
working on in this space.

00:39:32.258 --> 00:39:37.460
But, we're working on a Robot
of course that we might

00:39:37.460 --> 00:39:42.238
actually name it Doctor Wave or
some such thing, that can take

00:39:42.238 --> 00:39:44.540
a user through, OK,
now do this and.

00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:47.400
And, the Robot connected it
and see if the user does it.

00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:48.740
It can see it and
so on, it's --

00:39:48.740 --> 00:39:48.960
AUDIENCE: Clippy?

00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:51.398
LARS RASMUSSEN: Clippy.

00:39:51.398 --> 00:39:54.638
Damn it.

00:39:54.638 --> 00:39:57.638
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:57.638 --> 00:39:59.700
It looks like you're writing
to it, I don't know.

00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:05.860
DAN PETERSON: The human
doctor is getting tired.

00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:06.698
STEPHANIE HANNON: OK.

00:40:06.698 --> 00:40:07.738
I just wanted to say
one more thing.

00:40:07.738 --> 00:40:12.400
In the spirit of helping people
be smarter, work smarter, and

00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:15.480
Casey and the NLP team, I think
one area we barely scratched

00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:16.060
the surface is the inbox.

00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:19.500
And, showing people what's
happening in the inbox and

00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:20.560
what's interesting to them.

00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:22.178
It's very basic and
it's based on time.

00:40:22.178 --> 00:40:25.358
And, I don't want anyone
here to think that we

00:40:25.358 --> 00:40:26.838
think that's sufficient.

00:40:26.838 --> 00:40:29.078
Like, we know there's
information overload.

00:40:29.078 --> 00:40:31.018
And, that was part of the
problem in the early days

00:40:31.018 --> 00:40:32.418
of Wave when public
Waves went crazy.

00:40:32.418 --> 00:40:34.898
And, every public Wave
you touched showed

00:40:34.898 --> 00:40:35.898
up in your inbox.

00:40:35.898 --> 00:40:38.520
So, we want to do much smarter
things, because if I'm

00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:41.918
explicitly on a Wave it matters
more to me than something I'm

00:40:41.918 --> 00:40:42.320
on because of a group.

00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:46.698
Something you've replied to or
edited is something I wrote.

00:40:46.978 --> 00:40:47.840
It's more important to
me than other things.

00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:50.878
If somebody put an ad in
front of my username and a

00:40:50.878 --> 00:40:52.660
Twitter-like style probably
directed at me in some way.

00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:55.778
So, we just kind of apply some
of the genius engineering on

00:40:55.778 --> 00:40:58.238
this team, and to kind of
really presenting you with

00:40:58.238 --> 00:41:03.598
information you care most
about in an interesting ways.

00:41:03.598 --> 00:41:04.818
DAN PETERSON: Thank you
for the discussion.

00:41:05.318 --> 00:41:06.618
So, the next question we'll
grab from moderator.

00:41:06.358 --> 00:41:10.938
Will GTalk be updated to have
a new Wave notifier, or have

00:41:10.938 --> 00:41:12.818
currently online Wave users
added to the contact list?

00:41:15.098 --> 00:41:16.820
PAMELA FOX: Good idea.

00:41:16.820 --> 00:41:18.894
Let's do that.

00:41:20.750 --> 00:41:26.320
I'm just joking.

00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:28.238
We obviously haven't
built it yet.

00:41:28.238 --> 00:41:30.078
But I think it's a good idea
and we should probably figure

00:41:30.078 --> 00:41:32.738
out how to make it the Waves
integrated with the GTalk.

00:41:32.738 --> 00:41:34.538
PAMELA FOX: I want
to talk in Wave.

00:41:34.538 --> 00:41:36.978
STEPHANIE HANNON: Okay

00:41:36.978 --> 00:41:37.498
DAN PETERSON: Good idea.

00:41:37.498 --> 00:41:39.118
Live question.

00:41:39.118 --> 00:41:40.838
AUDIENCE: Daniel Grayrosen.

00:41:41.118 --> 00:41:44.218
You've talked about this group
collaboration for apps.

00:41:46.018 --> 00:41:46.958
Currently it's not possible.

00:41:46.958 --> 00:41:47.938
Yeah.

00:41:47.938 --> 00:41:52.838
I'm trusting out apps on my
domain as part of the preview.

00:41:52.838 --> 00:41:56.860
It seems it's not possible
to send Waves to groups,

00:41:56.860 --> 00:42:03.312
or not to other domains
posted at this domain.

00:42:03.366 --> 00:42:05.758
So if I have one domain I
cannot send Waves to all

00:42:05.758 --> 00:42:08.158
the other domains that
I'm hosting there.

00:42:09.198 --> 00:42:16.920
GREG D'ALESANDRE: So, the way
it should work is that if you,

00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:18.260
I'll talk to him afterwards.

00:42:18.378 --> 00:42:22.780
The way it should work is that
you can add any -- if you have

00:42:22.780 --> 00:42:25.098
a domain turned on for Wave,
you can choose to have

00:42:25.098 --> 00:42:26.738
it open or closed.

00:42:26.738 --> 00:42:31.160
If it's closed it means
your users can only Wave

00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:31.460
within their own domain.

00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:33.940
And, this is a lot of people
have asked for this

00:42:33.940 --> 00:42:36.940
specifically, both in education
to protect students,

00:42:36.940 --> 00:42:37.980
that sort of thing.

00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:39.518
And, also in businesses to
just make sure they're

00:42:39.518 --> 00:42:40.560
not sort of over sharing.

00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:45.938
The way it should work though
is also if your domain is open,

00:42:45.938 --> 00:42:48.160
you should be able to add
anyone outside your

00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:49.000
domain to Waves.

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:51.500
And, it'll show you at the top
of the Wave that someone from

00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:52.940
outside of your domain
is on that Wave.

00:42:52.940 --> 00:42:55.458
If that's not what you're
seeing, let's talk afterwards.

00:42:55.458 --> 00:42:59.958
AUDIENCE: It works that way but
if I'm outside the Wave and add

00:42:59.958 --> 00:43:02.820
a group, that's not possible.

00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:04.598
GREG D'ALESANDRE: Oh, so
you're talking about being

00:43:04.598 --> 00:43:05.840
able to add groups --

00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:08.398
AUDIENCE: But that's probably
what you're also working on

00:43:08.398 --> 00:43:09.760
with the group experience
and whatever.

00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:11.238
GREG D'ALESANDRE: So, there's a
number of things that we're

00:43:11.238 --> 00:43:11.800
working on with the
group experience.

00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:13.218
The very first thing we're
working on is just being able

00:43:13.218 --> 00:43:16.178
to follow a group so that
Waves of those groups

00:43:16.178 --> 00:43:17.760
go to your inbox.

00:43:18.458 --> 00:43:22.658
There also is an interaction
between Wave groups in your

00:43:22.658 --> 00:43:24.738
domain versus sort of public
groups and who can

00:43:24.738 --> 00:43:25.140
be added to those.

00:43:27.118 --> 00:43:29.720
There's kind of a large number
of settings that we're kind of

00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:32.280
working through to make sure
all of that's working smoothly.

00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:36.618
But, as I said, we're putting
a lot more energy now into

00:43:36.618 --> 00:43:37.940
improving the group's support.

00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:41.280
Because, this really is sort
of a core part of the Wave

00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:44.198
experience for a lot of people.

00:43:44.198 --> 00:43:46.018
DAN PETERSON: So, next question
from moderator here is

00:43:46.018 --> 00:43:47.220
speed, performance.

00:43:47.220 --> 00:43:50.020
What are we doing about
speed and performance?

00:43:50.020 --> 00:43:51.478
LARS RASMUSSEN: What
are our goals?

00:43:51.478 --> 00:43:56.798
So, speed and performances has
always been a focus of ours.

00:43:56.798 --> 00:43:58.978
Will continue to be
a focus of ours.

00:43:58.978 --> 00:44:01.938
I don't know if you saw the
graph that flashed by.

00:44:01.938 --> 00:44:04.578
But, sort of roughly speaking
speed is about an order of

00:44:04.578 --> 00:44:06.918
magnitude better now
than six months ago.

00:44:07.418 --> 00:44:11.340
Stability, closer to two
orders of magnitude.

00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:14.378
Better we measure it with
metrics like crashes.

00:44:15.338 --> 00:44:18.300
Like how many sessions in with
the thing crashing with.

00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:21.558
And, it used to be actually in
whole percents, and it's now

00:44:21.558 --> 00:44:22.998
down to something like 0.1%.

00:44:25.698 --> 00:44:30.840
My hope and aspirations is that
we'll do another order of

00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:33.898
magnitude change over the next
six months to a year or so.

00:44:33.898 --> 00:44:34.818
It starts getting hard.

00:44:34.818 --> 00:44:37.518
A thing we had a real problem
with earlier was the speed

00:44:37.518 --> 00:44:39.320
of opening large Waves.

00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:40.718
It's very simple, because
we loaded the whole

00:44:40.718 --> 00:44:41.978
thing into memory.

00:44:41.978 --> 00:44:44.398
We rendered the entire
Wave in the browsers dom,

00:44:44.398 --> 00:44:46.360
which was very slow.

00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:51.238
And, so just recently, we made
it so that we only render the

00:44:51.238 --> 00:44:53.478
part of the Wave that you're
actually looking at.

00:44:53.478 --> 00:44:55.678
Sort of an obvious thing to
do, but it was trickier

00:44:55.678 --> 00:44:56.538
than we thought.

00:44:56.538 --> 00:44:58.598
Because, it's hard to predict
how tall each part of the

00:44:58.598 --> 00:45:01.018
Wave is going to be on
until you render them.

00:45:01.018 --> 00:45:06.788
A next thing that we're working
on, so apparently when a Wave

00:45:06.788 --> 00:45:10.338
gets loaded into the browser,
it's in a format that

00:45:10.338 --> 00:45:12.598
specifically tailor it to
making collaborative

00:45:12.598 --> 00:45:13.398
editing work.

00:45:13.398 --> 00:45:16.878
And, in the browser we
convert that to HTML

00:45:16.878 --> 00:45:17.598
to actually show you.

00:45:17.598 --> 00:45:20.038
And, we build all of the
data structures to manage

00:45:20.038 --> 00:45:21.158
the convert editing.

00:45:21.158 --> 00:45:24.000
And, so at some point,
we'll make it so that the

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:25.780
server produces the HTML.

00:45:25.780 --> 00:45:29.180
And, we only show the HTML
when you load a Wave.

00:45:29.180 --> 00:45:32.240
And, then we only build a
collaborative editing data

00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:33.260
structure as if you
actually need them.

00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:35.760
And, again, a super
obvious thing to do.

00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:37.998
But, quite a lot of
work in practice.

00:45:37.998 --> 00:45:41.078
But, I think it's possible to
achieve another order of

00:45:41.078 --> 00:45:45.878
magnitude speed improvement
there for sizable Waves.

00:45:45.878 --> 00:45:48.278
DAN PETERSON: And there's
actually a talk about, in the

00:45:48.278 --> 00:45:52.918
Qwit track actually, about how
Wave has helped, sort of work

00:45:52.918 --> 00:45:55.738
through how you can make big
applications fast with Qwit.

00:45:55.738 --> 00:45:57.478
So, check the
schedule for that.

00:45:57.478 --> 00:45:59.958
AUDIENCE: Once again
about a Gadget API.

00:45:59.980 --> 00:46:03.540
What about merging Gadget
states and callback

00:46:03.540 --> 00:46:04.760
the state has changed.

00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:07.300
Now I know the only
state has changed.

00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:08.420
And, I know what is changed.

00:46:08.420 --> 00:46:11.440
And I'm doing Gadget is
this whole big documents.

00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:13.760
Build a heirarchy
tree, rather big.

00:46:14.458 --> 00:46:17.658
And it takes a lot to
merge it to zip it.

00:46:17.658 --> 00:46:21.748
And, now I'm using the approach
that I store the document at

00:46:21.748 --> 00:46:23.978
the sequence of comments.

00:46:23.978 --> 00:46:26.298
It is good for merging but it
takes now a lot of time to

00:46:26.298 --> 00:46:27.658
load the ready document.

00:46:27.918 --> 00:46:31.698
So, what are your plans,
what are your advice?

00:46:31.698 --> 00:46:33.840
DOUWE OSINGA: So basically
you want to have a diff?

00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:34.400
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I would
like to have a diff.

00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:36.338
What have changed in the state?

00:46:36.338 --> 00:46:41.178
DOUWE OSINGA: Yeah,
that seems very smart.

00:46:41.178 --> 00:46:42.092
AUDIENCE: OK.
1130
00:46:42,55 --&gt; 00:46:42,464
Months, weeks?

00:46:42.922 --> 00:46:44.818
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:44.818 --> 00:46:47.520
DOUWE OSINGA: Well in a similar
way one thing we have been

00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:52.018
wanting for a long time is to
actually give you a diff open

00:46:52.018 --> 00:46:58.158
so that when, you know, when th
user comes back to the Gadget,

00:46:58.158 --> 00:47:02.738
your Gadget gets a
diff open state.

00:47:02.738 --> 00:47:04.218
And can show the user
what has changed, since

00:47:04.218 --> 00:47:11.558
he last time looked.

00:47:11.558 --> 00:47:15.778
PAMELA FOX: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:47:15.778 --> 00:47:16.018
STEPHANIE HANNON:
He said weeks.

00:47:16.018 --> 00:47:16.818
PAMELA FOX: He said weeks.

00:47:16.818 --> 00:47:24.918
DAN PETERSON: We'll grab a
question from up in the laptop.

00:47:24.918 --> 00:47:25.478
Yeah.

00:47:25.478 --> 00:47:29.058
So, last year you preview
Rosy with Google Wave.

00:47:29.058 --> 00:47:33.038
Wondering about some plans for
when Rosy may be available

00:47:33.038 --> 00:47:35.518
in the acceptance gallery.

00:47:35.518 --> 00:47:37.798
LARS RASMUSSEN: A favorite
question of mind.

00:47:37.798 --> 00:47:37.850
Yeah.

00:47:37.904 --> 00:47:41.640
So Rosy was actually built by
someone from the Google machine

00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:43.798
translation tool, which
is not surprising.

00:47:43.798 --> 00:47:46.398
And, I'm not gonna --
this is not someone

00:47:46.398 --> 00:47:48.280
who works in my team.

00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:50.860
So, it's doubly hard to predict
when it's going to be.

00:47:50.860 --> 00:47:53.538
But, I would hope, and
we're talking months here.

00:47:53.538 --> 00:48:01.118
One of my favorite Robots ever.

00:48:01.118 --> 00:48:03.938
AUDIENCE: I have a question
about Wave organizations.

00:48:03.938 --> 00:48:11.318
Is it something planned to
have less Wave viewable

00:48:11.318 --> 00:48:13.800
at the same time.

00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:19.564
I mean I have an idea.

00:48:19.390 --> 00:48:23.958
It's something that would
be a mind map, but

00:48:23.958 --> 00:48:28.318
with Waves as notes.

00:48:28.318 --> 00:48:31.138
That would be something very
useful if you worked on very

00:48:31.138 --> 00:48:38.238
large projects that are to be
discussed by several groups of

00:48:38.238 --> 00:48:44.638
people, maybe other
things of course.

00:48:44.638 --> 00:48:50.238
But, say 100 person
are not to be made as

00:48:50.238 --> 00:48:54.658
recipients of one Wave.

00:48:54.658 --> 00:48:56.558
DOUWE OSINGA: So, I suppose you
could build something like

00:48:56.558 --> 00:48:59.458
that using embedded Waves.

00:48:59.458 --> 00:49:00.320
AUDIENCE: Using what?

00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:02.000
DOUWE OSINGA: Using
embedded Waves.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:04.418
AUDIENCE: Embedded Waves, yeah.

00:49:04.418 --> 00:49:05.478
DAN PETERSON: So, if I
understand the question though,

00:49:05.478 --> 00:49:09.258
what you're saying is you want
to build something mind map

00:49:09.258 --> 00:49:12.798
like each note has all the
Wave-like properties to it.

00:49:12.798 --> 00:49:15.718
Is that is that kind of
what you're getting at?

00:49:15.718 --> 00:49:17.958
AUDIENCE: Yeah, that's my idea.

00:49:17.958 --> 00:49:19.690
DAN PETERSON: So, do that
is what it seems like he's

00:49:19.690 --> 00:49:24.658
kind of aiming towards.

00:49:24.658 --> 00:49:26.938
We'll discuss it.

00:49:26.938 --> 00:49:29.738
PAMELA FOX: Remember at one
point, you know, wanting to

00:49:29.738 --> 00:49:33.300
actually visualize your nodes
as a map and seeing the

00:49:33.300 --> 00:49:34.878
connections between them.

00:49:35.498 --> 00:49:37.498
Is that?

00:49:37.498 --> 00:49:38.058
AUDIENCE: OK --

00:49:38.058 --> 00:49:38.780
DAN PETERSON: You
need a whiteboard.

00:49:41.078 --> 00:49:41.260
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:49:41.260 --> 00:49:44.038
JOCHEN BEKMANN: I'd also like
to say the client that we're

00:49:44.038 --> 00:49:47.860
releasing, that source code
can be taken and turned

00:49:47.860 --> 00:49:49.438
into something like that.

00:49:49.438 --> 00:49:51.158
So, if you have an entirely
different rendering engine and

00:49:51.158 --> 00:49:54.918
you want to embed [? LIPS ?]

00:49:54.918 --> 00:49:58.158
or Waves in a mind map, you
know, we'd love to see it.

00:49:58.158 --> 00:50:00.098
AUDIENCE: Yeah I'd like to.

00:50:00.098 --> 00:50:03.898
So just to, I'll try
to make it clearer.

00:50:03.898 --> 00:50:09.498
Say someone is creating a Wave,
starting Wave for a big

00:50:09.498 --> 00:50:14.100
project, that involves hundreds
of people in a company

00:50:14.100 --> 00:50:15.938
of thousands of people.

00:50:15.938 --> 00:50:16.898
OK.

00:50:16.898 --> 00:50:19.338
Say it took off.

00:50:19.338 --> 00:50:22.758
One wave the node of the
mind map would be about

00:50:22.758 --> 00:50:29.478
the engine, another about
the wheels, and so on.

00:50:29.478 --> 00:50:31.268
PAMELA FOX: Yeah, so I think
that's about connecting the

00:50:31.268 --> 00:50:31.820
waves together semantically.

00:50:31.922 --> 00:50:34.998
So I was Right.

00:50:34.998 --> 00:50:35.478
DAN PETERSON: Pamela
was a right.

00:50:35.478 --> 00:50:37.178
PAMELA FOX: So, right now there
are Robots that people are

00:50:37.178 --> 00:50:40.258
building to do very basic
structures within Waves like

00:50:40.258 --> 00:50:43.538
having, there's task key, you
know, doing sub tasks

00:50:43.538 --> 00:50:43.998
and sub task is that.

00:50:43.998 --> 00:50:45.538
Which is like a tree.

00:50:46.658 --> 00:50:48.718
You're probably looking
for something a little

00:50:48.718 --> 00:50:50.098
bit more flexible.

00:50:51.160 --> 00:50:53.920
So, I think we've
thought about that.

00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:56.260
JOCHEN BEKMANN: You can also
easily do a Wiki like linking

00:50:56.260 --> 00:50:58.960
between Waves This is
what we do internally.

00:51:00.518 --> 00:51:00.978
Easily.

00:51:00.558 --> 00:51:03.058
So, there's a button
linked to this Wave.

00:51:03.058 --> 00:51:07.518
You can use that or you can
drag from search panel.

00:51:08.578 --> 00:51:10.752
The Wave digest onto
a different Wave

00:51:10.752 --> 00:51:11.558
and you have a link to it.

00:51:11.558 --> 00:51:12.740
And, if you interlink
them just like --

00:51:12.740 --> 00:51:13.420
GREG D'ALESANDRE: But
that being said.

00:51:14.740 --> 00:51:17.420
Being able to visualize that
sort of Wiki like structure

00:51:17.420 --> 00:51:21.240
easily, is I think a
really interesting idea.

00:51:21.240 --> 00:51:23.300
DOUWE OSINGA: So, in my talk if
you also visit this afternoon

00:51:23.300 --> 00:51:28.340
I'll show some code on the
Wiki Robot that I've

00:51:28.340 --> 00:51:29.018
been working on.

00:51:29.018 --> 00:51:32.378
And, of course that thing only
allows you to create new Waves

00:51:32.378 --> 00:51:35.118
based on selecting a piece of
text, and then you, you know,

00:51:35.118 --> 00:51:36.878
click a button and it creates
a Wave with that thing.

00:51:36.878 --> 00:51:38.318
So, it helps you
set up the Wiki.

00:51:38.318 --> 00:51:42.300
It would be an awesome thing
to, you know, have that same

00:51:42.300 --> 00:51:44.520
Robot then, you know, maybe
maintain one Wave with the

00:51:44.520 --> 00:51:46.720
overall structure of
what you have built.

00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:49.120
And, you get, I think, so
much close to, you know,

00:51:49.120 --> 00:51:51.458
where you're heading at.

00:51:51.258 --> 00:51:56.198
GREG D'ALESANDRE: And, in
Alan and my talk tomorrow.

00:51:56.698 --> 00:51:59.998
DAN PETERSON: No, Douwe's
talk is at 3 o'clock today.

00:51:59.998 --> 00:52:04.298
GREG D'ALESANDRE: Yeah, but but
part of the thing we're going

00:52:04.298 --> 00:52:07.960
to be showing is exactly the
same sort of thing, but with

00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:10.620
also the ability to have Robots
cross updating between these

00:52:10.620 --> 00:52:11.420
Waves and these nodes.

00:52:11.420 --> 00:52:13.820
Because, I think that's one
of things that we get asked

00:52:13.820 --> 00:52:14.060
about all the time is.

00:52:14.060 --> 00:52:17.580
It's really interesting to
have sort of a Wiki kind

00:52:17.580 --> 00:52:19.960
of a mesh of Waves.

00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:22.678
But, what you want to be able
to do is have the information

00:52:22.678 --> 00:52:22.778
flowing between them.

00:52:22.778 --> 00:52:26.640
And, this is something the
robots, the actual robot

00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:27.120
API really enables.

00:52:27.560 --> 00:52:29.718
And, I think Pamela
mentioned task key which

00:52:29.718 --> 00:52:30.518
does this as well.

00:52:30.518 --> 00:52:35.698
So, I think there's a really
interesting aspect there too.

00:52:35.698 --> 00:52:38.338
AUDIENCE: Do you mind if
I ask another question?

00:52:38.338 --> 00:52:39.998
DAN PETERSON: Go ahead.

00:52:39.998 --> 00:52:42.238
AUDIENCE: A question
about groups.

00:52:42.218 --> 00:52:46.178
I'm working on something
that could give restricted

00:52:46.178 --> 00:52:52.280
rights to users OK.

00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:59.918
Say I have a Wave with only two
groups as recipients, and one

00:52:59.918 --> 00:53:04.358
group is read only, and the
other has full access.

00:53:04.358 --> 00:53:14.438
How can I know the group's
other user that is

00:53:14.438 --> 00:53:16.038
interacting with the Wave.

00:53:16.038 --> 00:53:19.118
DAN PETERSON: So, I think your
question is how do you know

00:53:19.118 --> 00:53:22.760
which user is getting
the access through.

00:53:22.760 --> 00:53:24.392
Is that essentially?
1265
00:53:24,392 --&gt; 00:53:24,366
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:53:24.366 --> 00:53:28.178
DAN PETERSON: Yeah.

00:53:28.178 --> 00:53:30.098
PAMELA FOX: If you're looking
to find out stuff about, you

00:53:30.098 --> 00:53:32.838
know, what group somebody is
in, or why it is they're able

00:53:32.838 --> 00:53:34.738
to view a Wave or edit a
Wave, there's really

00:53:34.738 --> 00:53:35.678
nothing like that.

00:53:35.678 --> 00:53:38.998
And, there's not really a
Groups API for normal groups.

00:53:38.998 --> 00:53:43.678
There is somewhat of an API for
Google Apps Groups, little bit.

00:53:43.678 --> 00:53:45.478
But, usually when people are
doing that, I tell them

00:53:45.478 --> 00:53:47.638
to create their own
concept of groups.

00:53:48.538 --> 00:53:49.840
You know, using App Engine.

00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:51.758
I guess your own server now.

00:53:52.478 --> 00:53:56.038
So, you really have full
access to the data.

00:53:57.218 --> 00:53:58.558
DAN PETERSON: Robots
can configure read

00:53:58.558 --> 00:53:59.698
only info access.

00:53:59.698 --> 00:54:00.880
PAMELA FOX: Right.

00:54:00.880 --> 00:54:01.158
On.

00:54:01.658 --> 00:54:02.358
DAN PETERSON: Right.

00:54:02.358 --> 00:54:04.098
GREG D'ALESANDRE: So, one of
things that will happen is if

00:54:04.098 --> 00:54:07.960
you have access through both
of those groups, you'll get

00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:11.500
the highest level of
access that you get.

00:54:11.500 --> 00:54:14.058
So, I guess there's
also a question.

00:54:14.058 --> 00:54:16.300
It sounds like you want to
know which group its coming

00:54:16.300 --> 00:54:17.360
from for another reason.

00:54:17.360 --> 00:54:21.444
But, the access levels are
controlled by whatever group

00:54:21.444 --> 00:54:24.780
gives you access to the
Wave, if that make sense.

00:54:24.780 --> 00:54:25.218
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it makes sense.

00:54:25.218 --> 00:54:32.358
But, my point was more about
one user belonging to one group

00:54:32.358 --> 00:54:38.138
in the two groups that are
recipients of the Wave.

00:54:38.138 --> 00:54:46.518
And, so when the Robot reacts
to the user interaction, I

00:54:46.518 --> 00:54:50.338
would like to know which
group does he belong to.

00:54:50.338 --> 00:54:51.938
PAMELA FOX: Yeah,
I would keep --

00:54:51.938 --> 00:54:52.358
AUDIENCE: What are his rights.

00:54:52.358 --> 00:54:57.058
PAMELA FOX: I would keep your
own list of groups, and

00:54:57.058 --> 00:54:59.898
have your Robot check it.

00:54:59.898 --> 00:55:01.198
It's own data store.

00:55:01.198 --> 00:55:01.340
DOUWE OSINGA: Yeah.

00:55:02.018 --> 00:55:07.878
In this situation, so the user
gets edited away at that point.

00:55:07.878 --> 00:55:09.898
So, you could just check what
the access right to the user

00:55:09.898 --> 00:55:12.678
has, because tha would be
inherited from the group.

00:55:12.678 --> 00:55:12.918
Right.

00:55:12.918 --> 00:55:14.558
So, you have one group
that's read only.

00:55:14.558 --> 00:55:17.138
So, if the user accesses --
well actually with a [? URL ?]

00:55:17.138 --> 00:55:19.958
you can't do anything.

00:55:19.958 --> 00:55:22.298
DAN PETERSON: So, actually
we're going to try and wrap

00:55:22.298 --> 00:55:24.278
things up a few minutes early
given the crazy schedule

00:55:24.278 --> 00:55:24.918
changes that happened
with the keynote.

00:55:24.918 --> 00:55:28.004
But, we'll be happy to hang out
here answer questions more of

00:55:28.004 --> 00:55:28.118
sort of live and in person.

00:55:28.918 --> 00:55:31.698
Or, rather one on one in
person for a little bit.

00:55:31.698 --> 00:55:33.040
And, thank you so
much for coming.

00:55:33.040 --> 00:55:34.098
We have three
receptions todays.

00:55:34.260 --> 00:55:35.840
Three receptions tomorrow.

00:55:35.840 --> 00:55:38.158
And, then it's a regular
officer hours and such.

00:55:38.158 --> 00:55:40.218
STEPHANIE HANNON: We'll stay
up here and answer questions.

00:55:40.218 --> 00:55:43.538
Just, if you want to
remember who we are.

00:55:43.538 --> 00:55:46.838
Dan knows everything about
platform and Federation,

00:55:46.838 --> 00:55:48.858
Enterprise, whatever we do.

00:55:48.858 --> 00:55:51.280
Enterprise, developer
relations, platform,

00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:52.598
and then protocol.

00:55:52.598 --> 00:55:53.118
So, we'll stay up here
for a few minutes.

00:55:53.118 --> 00:55:55.658
And, come talk to us
especially this gentleman

00:55:55.658 --> 00:55:57.678
who has more ideas.

00:55:57.678 --> 00:55:57.918
Thanks everyone.

00:55:57.918 --> 00:55:59.100
Thanks so much for all
your work with Wave.

00:55:59.302 --> 00:56:04.302
[APPLAUSE]
