00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.260
XIAOHUI YUAN: Today we're going
to talk about numbers in

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:06.190
China and what sort of other
meanings it might be

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:07.670
associated with.

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.160
I believe the most famous
one would be number 8.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.240
It's serious stuff, because
people are willing to pay a

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.360
fortune to get as many 8 on
their registration numbers for

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.590
their cars, on their phone
numbers, work out how to have

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.310
a child on the right date
and in the right

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.270
month with number 8.

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:36.300
This is number 8 in
Arabic numeral.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.930
And in Chinese, it
is just that.

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.050
BRADY: Oh, that's
pretty simple.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:44.910
XIAOHUI YUAN: That's
pretty simple.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.650
That's the simplest
one, probably.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:47.680
People love it.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.190
Everybody wants to be
able to write it, so

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:50.610
they keep it simple.

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.380
Number 8 is pronounced
as "ba" in China.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.900
The pronunciation is very
similar to that of "fa," which

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.020
means getting wealthy.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:13.370
Like, this is "fa." This
is "ba." This is "fa."

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:14.600
For example--

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.770
[SPEAKING MANDARIN]

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.150
--means, wish you become
really wealthy.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:21.470
So they're making
loads of money.

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.090
Doesn't matter if you
become a fat cat.

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.340
So to encode, to symbolize their
wish to get wealthy,

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.330
just in a very simple manner,
like on their registration

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.360
numbers for the car and
their phone numbers.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.060
So they just love to use
the number eight.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.990
And I have the tendency-- if I
look at a car in the street

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.790
and pay attention to the
registration number, if

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.340
there's one with particularly
a lot more number 8's than

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.310
normal cars, I would tend
to look at the driver.

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.430
And 9 out of the 10
times, it would be

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.280
an Asian-faced person.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.210
Or Asian person.

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:59.460
Asian-looking person.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:13.340
Sometimes if you want to book a
particular table in a really

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.780
posh, expensive restaurant--

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.430
like I want table 8.

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:23.970
Or when somebody gets engaged,
the bride-to-be's family would

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.690
expect number 8 is involved
in a certain way.

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.660
If it is not, they
will get upset.

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.950
People are very much
hooked up on it.

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.420
Chinese people, you know,
historically, the average

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.550
people have struggled a lot
over thousands of years,

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.170
because there's almost a
straight transition from a

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.600
feudal society to a Communist
society, where always a large

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.800
number of population and
limited resources.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:55.370
Everybody wants to become
wealthy, important, have a new

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:56.670
life, have a better life.

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.130
Therefore, this number 8 kind
of symbolizes every--

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.780
or if not every, most Chinese
people's dream to have a good

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.555
life, to have good luck, to
have quite a few money in

00:03:07.555 --> 00:03:08.780
their pocket.

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.550
BRADY: You live in England
at the moment.

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:11.290
XIAOHUI YUAN: Yeah.

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.680
BRADY: Do you still have a funny
thing about number 8, or

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.430
have you been shaken
out of it?

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.040
Or do you still find
8 special?

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.250
Is it ingrained in you?

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.150
XIAOHUI YUAN: I--

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.380
I'm normally not that
much fussed by it.

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.740
But when I go buy a lottery, I
sort of would prefer number 8

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.430
on it, either 8 or
18, 28, or 38.

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.230
As long as there's an 8 on it.

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.930
BRADY: Is the number 88
considered especially lucky?

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:37.840
XIAOHUI YUAN: Oh, yeah.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:38.320
Yeah.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.625
88, 888, 8,888.

00:03:42.625 --> 00:03:46.240
If a bride-to-be at an
engagement party received

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:52.750
8,888 yuan from the groom-to-be,
that's very

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.715
pleasant and expected
very much.

00:03:55.715 --> 00:04:00.210
We also have another special
number which is associated

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:06.670
with good luck and associated
with "things will happen

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.300
smoothly." It's number 6.

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.650
This is 6 in Chinese
character.

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:18.360
And we also have traditional
Chinese characters which

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:22.340
indicate 6, which is normally
used in very formal occasions,

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.360
like on a check or
on a property

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.610
title deed, which is--

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.010
BRADY: So that's a more
formal number 6.

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.740
XIAOHUI YUAN: Yeah.

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:34.330
Yeah.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:40.590
Number 6, its pronunciation is
liu, which is very similar to

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.600
another Chinese character
indicating good luck, which is

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.590
[SPEAKING MANDARIN].

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:53.456
6 is liu, and good luck, things
happen smoothly is liu.

00:04:53.456 --> 00:04:54.610
BRADY: That's the same!

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:55.520
XIAOHUI YUAN: Yeah,
that's the same.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.500
Just the tone is different.

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:02.700
Normally, people like number 6
to be involved before they go

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.805
on a journey, before
they take a flight.

00:05:04.805 --> 00:05:08.060
They hope everything would
go smoothly when

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.480
they go on a cruise.

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:16.280
So 6, liu, really means
something--

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.010
everything will happen or turn
out to be fine, so there's no

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:22.310
unpleasant surprise involved.

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:27.160
While 8, number 8, fa, is
specifically associated with

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.370
getting wealthy.

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.765
BRADY: You've told me that
people in China prefer the

00:05:31.765 --> 00:05:33.860
number 8 to the number 6.

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:34.680
XIAOHUI YUAN: Yeah.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:35.890
BRADY: Does that mean
they would rather

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:37.755
be rich than lucky?

00:05:37.755 --> 00:05:41.080
XIAOHUI YUAN: [LAUGHS], looks
like money is the first

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.476
priority of people's concern
in China, certainly.

00:05:45.476 --> 00:05:47.990
BRADY: Do people in
China realize that

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:50.550
666 is a bad number?

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:50.950
XIAOHUI YUAN: No.

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:53.866
In China, that's a very
lucky number.

00:05:53.866 --> 00:05:54.319
BRADY: OK.

00:05:54.319 --> 00:05:56.753
But they do know that Westerners
don't like it.

00:05:56.753 --> 00:05:59.780
XIAOHUI YUAN: No, they're
not aware of that.

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.835
It's a very Western thing
about triple 6.

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:06.570
Yeah.

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:10.880
There is a number which could be
disliked by lot of people.

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.540
It's number 4.

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:14.110
Why is that?

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:16.770
It's also because of
the pronunciation.

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:22.740
Number 4, in Chinese,
is pronounced as si.

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:25.810
Another Chinese word, which
means death, is

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:28.980
pronounced as si.

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:31.780
So the pronunciation is
exactly the same,

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:33.400
apart from the tone.

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:40.250
A simple Chinese character for
4 and the traditional Chinese

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:45.010
character for 4, which
is used in formal

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:46.700
occasions like title deed.

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:47.740
BRADY: What does that mean?

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:48.990
Does that mean people
just avoid--

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:49.830
XIAOHUI YUAN: Oh, yeah.

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:51.365
BRADY: You can't avoid
the number 4.

00:06:51.365 --> 00:06:54.630
XIAOHUI YUAN: Well, you try to
avoid as much as possible.

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:57.230
People would pay for
number 8 or 6.

00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:59.290
Nobody would want to
pay for number 4.

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:03.180
And they try to avoid it as
much as they possibly can.

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:04.710
There's an anecdote here.

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:10.310
I have an acquaintance who's
got six 4's in his phone

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:14.110
number, and he was trying to
phone up for Chinese delivery.

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:16.940
And the lady, the Chinese lady
on the other side of the phone

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:19.170
would not take his
number down.

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:20.995
The lady took the
first number 4.

00:07:20.995 --> 00:07:22.530
It was all right, 4.

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:25.020
When it's come to the second
one, the lady's

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:26.690
voice started to shake.

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:29.840
When it comes to the third one,
the lady asked, how many

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:30.880
other 4's you have?

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.060
He said, another three.

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:34.190
She said, I'm not going
to take your order.

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:34.860
I'm sorry.

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:37.615
It's just so unlucky
in Chinese culture.

00:07:37.615 --> 00:07:39.200
BRADY: That was in the
UK, wasn't that?

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.180
XIAOHUI YUAN: That's
in the UK.

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:42.650
That's actually Nottingham.

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:46.060
BRADY: So if someone in China
had a whole bunch of 4's in

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:48.370
their phone number, would they
get rid of that phone number?

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:48.950
XIAOHUI YUAN: Oh, yeah.

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:50.570
They would definitely
try if they can.

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:50.910
Yeah.

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:54.580
They would complain to the phone
shop and swap to another

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:55.830
number, yeah.

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:02.790
BRADY: The r, the [INAUDIBLE],
is 200.

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:05.135
FEMALE SPEAKER: And this number
is called a googolplex.

00:08:05.135 --> 00:08:06.875
BRADY: OK, [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:06.875 --> 00:08:08.125
is 6.
