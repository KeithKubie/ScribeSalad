00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.920
In this class, we'll be
using R to work with data

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.630
and build models.

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:16.640
But what is R?

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.420
R is a software environment
for data analysis,

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.690
statistical computing,
and graphics.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.850
It is also a
programming language

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.000
which is natural
to use and allows

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.119
you to complete data
analyses in just a few lines.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.210
We won't be doing much
programming in class,

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.640
and almost everything
we ask you to do

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.370
can be completed in a few lines.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.780
There's a lot more
that you can do with R

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.910
than just what we
teach in this class,

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.260
but you will have a
good understanding of R

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.440
and how to use it
in just a few weeks.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.470
R originated from the
statistical programming

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.470
language S, which was
developed by John Chambers

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.980
while at Bell Labs in the 1970s.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.390
The first version
of R was developed

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.530
by Robert Gentlemen
and Ross Ihaka

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.480
at the University of
Auckland in the mid-1990s.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.810
They wanted a better
statistical software

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.400
to use in their Macintosh
teaching laboratory

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.880
and decided to create their own.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.860
They also released it as an
open-sourced alternative to S

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.390
and encouraged others
to download and help

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.080
develop the software.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.289
There are many choices
for data analysis

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:33.640
software available today.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.450
In addition to R,
some popular examples

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:45.479
are SAS, Stata, SPSS, Excel and
Excel add-ons, MATLAB, Minitab,

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.860
and pandas in Python.

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.460
So, why are we using R?

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.190
R is free and
open-sourced and is

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.670
available on all platforms,
Mac, Windows, and Linux.

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.780
R is also widely used.

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.510
There are more than two
million users around the world.

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.590
This means that new features are
being developed all the time,

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.430
and there are a lot of
community resources for R.

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.140
Additionally, R makes it
easy to re-run previous work

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.000
and to make adjustments.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.050
R also has nice graphics
and visualizations.

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.800
We will just be using the
R command line interface.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.770
However, if you would like
to try a graphical user

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.110
interface, or GUI,
there are many choices.

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.620
Two popular choices
are RStudio and Rattle.

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.760
There are many R resources
available online.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.810
In addition to the official
R page and the download page,

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.850
there are many helpful websites.

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.750
Here are a few popular ones.

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.650
In general, though, if
you're looking for a command

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.280
or how to do something
in R, try googling it.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.790
Often, if you just try typing
"R" and then what you're

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:02.840
looking for in a
search engine, you

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.730
can find some very helpful
posts and websites.

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.390
We want to emphasize, though,
that the best way to learn R

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.260
is through trial and error.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.070
So, let's get
started working in R.
