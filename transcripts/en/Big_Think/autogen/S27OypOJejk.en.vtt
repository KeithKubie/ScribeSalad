that could be found on the planet so

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940
that could be found on the planet so
 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.369
that could be found on the planet so
then they weren't saddled with a name

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:47.379
then they weren't saddled with a name
 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:49.829
then they weren't saddled with a name
that speaks of sin and and just

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:49.839
that speaks of sin and and just
 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:52.590

some kind of evolutionary loser because

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.110
some kind of evolutionary loser because
 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.109
some kind of evolutionary loser because
they're slow we think that they are

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:01.119
they're slow we think that they are
 

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:04.799
they're slow we think that they are
therefore kind of stupid and useless and

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809
therefore kind of stupid and useless and
 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:08.100
therefore kind of stupid and useless and
well they can't run from danger so you

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110
well they can't run from danger so you
 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.499
well they can't run from danger so you
know how do they survive well they

00:01:10.499 --> 00:01:10.509
know how do they survive well they
 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:13.230
know how do they survive well they
actually survive very well indeed which

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240
actually survive very well indeed which
 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.300
actually survive very well indeed which
is why I think they are the true king of

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310
is why I think they are the true king of
 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.490
is why I think they are the true king of
the jungle because there was a survey

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500
the jungle because there was a survey
 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.880
the jungle because there was a survey
done in a Panamanian rainforest and they

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890
done in a Panamanian rainforest and they
 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.490
done in a Panamanian rainforest and they
found that it was something like a third

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.500
found that it was something like a third
 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.639
found that it was something like a third
of the mammalian biomass in that

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:26.649
of the mammalian biomass in that
 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:29.370
of the mammalian biomass in that
particular forest was made up of sloths

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380
particular forest was made up of sloths
 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.160
particular forest was made up of sloths
so that's like you take all the mammals

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170
so that's like you take all the mammals
 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.599
so that's like you take all the mammals
from the forest 1/3 1/3 of that mass

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:36.609
from the forest 1/3 1/3 of that mass
 

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:38.789
from the forest 1/3 1/3 of that mass
would have been taken up by sloths so

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:38.799
would have been taken up by sloths so
 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:41.399
would have been taken up by sloths so
all the rest was all the rats all the

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409
all the rest was all the rats all the
 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:44.429
all the rest was all the rats all the
ocelots all the tape here's everything

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:44.439
ocelots all the tape here's everything
 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:47.580
ocelots all the tape here's everything
else took up 2/3 third of it was sloths

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590
else took up 2/3 third of it was sloths
 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.590
else took up 2/3 third of it was sloths
which is just a huge amount I mean

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600
which is just a huge amount I mean
 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.730
which is just a huge amount I mean
that's a very successful creature partly

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740
that's a very successful creature partly
 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.410
that's a very successful creature partly
we just don't realize that because

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420
we just don't realize that because
 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.419
we just don't realize that because
they're very hard to see they're very

00:01:57.419 --> 00:01:57.429
they're very hard to see they're very
 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:59.819
they're very hard to see they're very
stealthy you know so one of the things

00:01:59.819 --> 00:01:59.829
stealthy you know so one of the things
 

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:02.550
stealthy you know so one of the things
the great things about being really slow

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560
the great things about being really slow
 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.510
the great things about being really slow
is you don't really get noticed which if

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520
is you don't really get noticed which if
 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.460
is you don't really get noticed which if
you're trying not to be eaten is really

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470
you're trying not to be eaten is really
 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.280
you're trying not to be eaten is really
quite a good idea so monkeys for

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290
quite a good idea so monkeys for
 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.559
quite a good idea so monkeys for
instance you're always aware of monkeys

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569
instance you're always aware of monkeys
 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:14.789

when they turn up there's a lot of

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:14.799
when they turn up there's a lot of
 

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:16.830
when they turn up there's a lot of
crashing around and fruit being thrown

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840
crashing around and fruit being thrown
 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:17.970
crashing around and fruit being thrown
to the ground and they may

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980
to the ground and they may
 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.500
to the ground and they may
a lot of noise the sloth is moving very

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510
a lot of noise the sloth is moving very
 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.839
a lot of noise the sloth is moving very
slow with extraordinary control I always

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:24.849
slow with extraordinary control I always
 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:27.119
slow with extraordinary control I always
watch them and think wow the core

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:27.129
watch them and think wow the core
 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:29.610
watch them and think wow the core
control of that animal is amazing it's

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620
control of that animal is amazing it's
 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.789
control of that animal is amazing it's
like watching Swan Lake in slow motion I

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:32.799
like watching Swan Lake in slow motion I
 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:35.130
like watching Swan Lake in slow motion I
mean they really just move so

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140
mean they really just move so
 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.949
mean they really just move so
fantastically slowly but those slow

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959
fantastically slowly but those slow
 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.440
fantastically slowly but those slow
movements we think slip under the radar

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450
movements we think slip under the radar
 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.170

of the harpy eagle as its swooping

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180
of the harpy eagle as its swooping
 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.930
of the harpy eagle as its swooping
around the canopy they simply don't get

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940
around the canopy they simply don't get
 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.080
around the canopy they simply don't get
noticed and I think one of the reasons

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090
noticed and I think one of the reasons
 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.140
noticed and I think one of the reasons
why the early explorers so misunderstood

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150
why the early explorers so misunderstood
 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.930
why the early explorers so misunderstood
the sloth is because they were viewing

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940
the sloth is because they were viewing
 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.470
the sloth is because they were viewing
it the wrong way up so I think when the

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480
it the wrong way up so I think when the
 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.050
it the wrong way up so I think when the
the conquistadors you know first arrived

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060
the conquistadors you know first arrived
 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.789
the conquistadors you know first arrived
in the new world they would have been

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799
in the new world they would have been
 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:05.670
in the new world they would have been
brought examples of animals they

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680
brought examples of animals they
 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.440
brought examples of animals they
wouldn't have gone into the jungle and

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450
wouldn't have gone into the jungle and
 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:08.970
wouldn't have gone into the jungle and
observed them in 6:u they would have

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980
observed them in 6:u they would have
 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.420
observed them in 6:u they would have
been brought animals and with the sloths

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430
been brought animals and with the sloths
 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.869
been brought animals and with the sloths
you know this is a an inverted quadruped

00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:15.879
you know this is a an inverted quadruped
 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:19.170
you know this is a an inverted quadruped
it it is designed it is it is evolved to

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180
it it is designed it is it is evolved to
 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.089
it it is designed it is it is evolved to
live its life upside down because that's

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:21.099
live its life upside down because that's
 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:23.309
live its life upside down because that's
incredibly energy efficient if you are

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:23.319
incredibly energy efficient if you are
 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:26.039
incredibly energy efficient if you are

only muscles that you really need to
 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.569
only muscles that you really need to
work are these ones so they can hook on

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:30.579
work are these ones so they can hook on
 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:32.789

just get on with the bit the busy
business of digesting their very

business of digesting their very
 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:39.990
business of digesting their very
undigestible food they're basically sort

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000
undigestible food they're basically sort
 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.979
undigestible food they're basically sort
of dangling fermenting bags of food and

but that upside down existence requires

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269
but that upside down existence requires
 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:52.140
but that upside down existence requires
very little energy so they've almost got

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150
very little energy so they've almost got
 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.430
very little energy so they've almost got
rid of the muscles that that like

just have the muscles that you use to

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500
just have the muscles that you use to
 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.460
just have the muscles that you use to
sort of draw yourself along and you know
