00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.080
&gt;&gt; Alright, so let's start off, maybe you can tell

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.250
me what happens when Tit for Tat plays against always cooperate.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.080
&gt;&gt; So what happens if you always

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.050
cooperate? Well, let's see, I start out cooperating.

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:11.795
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:11.795 --> 00:00:13.850
&gt;&gt; And since the other person is cooperating I will

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:16.040
continue to cooperate because that's what they did the last time.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:16.274
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:16.274 --> 00:00:17.570
&gt;&gt; So, I will always cooperate.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.150
&gt;&gt; That's right. Good. Alright, so what

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.810
about if we play against always defect.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:25.290
&gt;&gt; Well if we always defect, the first

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.800
time I'm going to cooperate because that's what you said Tit for Tat is.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.860
&gt;&gt; Hm.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.650
&gt;&gt; But from that point on, I will do what my opponent does, which

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.230
is defect. So I will cooperate and

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.825
then defect, defect, defect, defect, defect, defect, ellipses.

00:00:35.825 --> 00:00:38.480
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I put this always defect in there, but actually it

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.420
can't ever be the right answer right [LAUGH] because Tit for Tat always starts

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.960
off cooperating. So the, the other three seem like they might be possible,

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.620
always defect is not possible. Good. Alright. So, what if Tit for Tat plays

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.280
against another Tit for Tat?

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:58.370
&gt;&gt; Well, I started out cooperating my opponent cooperated. And since

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.160
I'm going to do what that person does I will cooperate, but

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.900
since that person's doing what I did, they will also cooperate.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.280
And so we will both cooperate forever, so we will always cooperate.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.237
&gt;&gt; Nice. So isn't that kind of interesting? So Tit for Tat

00:01:11.237 --> 00:01:15.440
even though, if, when it's playing against itself, is a very cooperative fellow.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.725
&gt;&gt; Hm, I

00:01:15.725 --> 00:01:16.300
like that.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.830
&gt;&gt; But if Tit for Tat is playing against

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.760
something that defects, it becomes a little bit more vengeful.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:21.410
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.010
&gt;&gt; Alright, so what if it plays against something that is

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.560
a little unsure of itself? So it starts off defecting, then

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.170
cooperating, then defecting, it's sort of almost an anti kind of thing,

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.990
right? So it's, this is one that starts off with a defect.

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.030
&gt;&gt; Right, so it always, so I, first thing I do is

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.740
cooperate. And then after that, effectively I do what the opponent does one

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.990
step before. So I basically take what you, I'm pointing to the

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.310
screen, you can't see me. I take the the D-C-D-C-D, and I

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.140
just put a C in front of it, because that's what I'm

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.725
going to do. So, I will do,

00:01:52.725 --> 00:01:57.162
C-D-C-D-C-D-C-D, ellipsis. So that's your last choice.

00:01:57.162 --> 00:01:59.860
&gt;&gt; Isn't the C-D-C-D-C-D, ellipsis in Atlanta?

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.858
&gt;&gt; It is, actually. It is the home of

00:02:01.858 --> 00:02:05.220
all such analysis of diseases in the United States.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:05.778
&gt;&gt; The Center

00:02:05.778 --> 00:02:06.981
for Disease Control?

00:02:06.981 --> 00:02:07.344
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:02:07.344 --> 00:02:08.690
&gt;&gt; Is that what it's called?

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.905
&gt;&gt; Yes, that's exactly what it is. Come to Atlanta and work for us.

00:02:11.905 --> 00:02:14.897
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Alright, so good. So, that, that's the pattern of,

00:02:14.897 --> 00:02:17.990
of responses that Tit for Tat makes against this set of strategies.

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:19.390
&gt;&gt; Oh, so we answered my question.
