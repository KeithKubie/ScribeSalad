00:00:03.905 --> 00:00:05.280
RIO ANDERSON: The
point of ballet

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.580
is to make it look effortless.

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.760
But beneath all of that,
it's the most difficult thing

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:12.950
I could imagine.

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:19.254
Ballet can completely break you,
and it's pretty all or nothing.

00:00:19.254 --> 00:00:20.920
INTERVIEWER: When did
you start dancing?

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.461
RIO ANDERSON: I
didn't start studying

00:00:22.461 --> 00:00:24.700
ballet, seriously,
at City Ballet School

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.370
until 14, which is pretty late.

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:30.610
A lot of girls start when
they're like 6, 7, 8,

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.580
and I started in level
three with the 11-year-olds.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.330
INTERVIEWER: Did you ever
feel dejected because you

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:39.120
were older, thinking
that you had

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.710
to do so much more to catch up?

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.810
RIO ANDERSON: So I would leave
the class almost every day

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.600
and go cry in the bathroom
before coming back in,

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.980
because the 11-year-olds
were so talented.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.950
And it was really
depressing, and I thought

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.960
about quitting all of the time.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.335
INTERVIEWER: What
kept you going?

00:00:56.335 --> 00:00:58.043
RIO ANDERSON: It's
hard because you don't

00:00:58.043 --> 00:00:59.530
see improvement day to day.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.246
But eventually, you
see just a glimpse,

00:01:03.246 --> 00:01:06.480
and that feels so when
you can see that you've

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:07.870
accomplished something.

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:09.995
INTERVIEWER: Tell me about
some of the competitions

00:01:09.995 --> 00:01:10.828
that you've won.

00:01:10.828 --> 00:01:13.161
RIO ANDERSON: This year, we
did participate in the Youth

00:01:13.161 --> 00:01:14.330
America Grand Prix.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.287
It's the biggest student ballet
competition in the world,

00:01:17.287 --> 00:01:19.480
and I ended up winning
the silver medal.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.240
So I received a scholarship
to the Royal Ballet School.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.280
I was accepted to
Harvard this year,

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.511
but I'm choosing to defer.

00:01:26.511 --> 00:01:27.886
INTERVIEWER: And
how difficult is

00:01:27.886 --> 00:01:29.662
it to get into the
Royal Ballet School?

00:01:29.662 --> 00:01:31.620
RIO ANDERSON: I think
it's harder than Harvard.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.060
It's definitely a
dream come true.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.070
INTERVIEWER: You have a very
distinct ritual when it comes

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.340
to performance and ballet.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.990
Can you tell me about that?

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.080
RIO ANDERSON: So
part of the ritual

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.690
for me is a very set routine
for preparing your body.

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.280
And in doing such a repetitive
and specific warm-up,

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.120
you also get your mind
into that sort of zen zone.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.060
I just sit down, close
my eyes, and then I

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.900
rehearse my dance in my head.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.650
Sometimes I'll put in
earbuds, but the music

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.390
activates the muscle
memory when you're dancing.

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.840
I like to visualize
all the dancing,

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.770
go through each step in
my mind, just thinking

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.350
about the movements,
and also, really

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.920
train to feel them in my body.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.762
You do the ideal in your
head and hope it translates.

00:02:18.762 --> 00:02:20.470
INTERVIEWER: What
pressure are you under?

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.127
How high are the stakes for you?

00:02:22.127 --> 00:02:23.960
RIO ANDERSON: As a
student, each performance

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.640
matters so much, because
you just don't have as many,

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.920
in the competitions.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.640
You only have one
chance on stage.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.040
It's a lot of pressure.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.710
The visualization is so
important, because it shows me

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.560
what I'm going for, what I'd
like the performance to be.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.950
And I get really nervous.

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.790
So if my mind goes
blank onstage,

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.190
the muscle memory kicks
in, because your body

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.370
recognizes what's going on
and what's going to happen.

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.320
INTERVIEWER: What lessons have
you learned about success?

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.320
RIO ANDERSON: The most
surprising thing, for me,

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.390
has just been that
success can come.

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.120
When I started and I was nowhere
near the top of my class,

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.530
I never imagined any of this.

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.520
I really fell in
love with dance when

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.700
I discovered classical ballet.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.630
And it's strange, but what
I like the most about it

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.140
is just how challenging it is,
and improvement that you see

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.290
is directly proportional
to what you put in.

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.020
You decide how hard
you work, and you

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.310
decide how much better you
get, and it's all on you.

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.114
Which that independence and
control is really satisfying.

00:03:22.114 --> 00:03:26.098
[MUSIC PLAYING]

SUBJECT: The ritual of swimming
is so important for me.

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:01.530
Every day my body gets to
be immersed in the bay.

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.870
I can't imagine my
life without it now.
