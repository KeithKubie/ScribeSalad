00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.030
- [Tutor] The Bill of
Rights, as we know it today

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:07.030
were the first 10 amendments
to the Constitution

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.700
and these amendments
guaranteed individual liberty

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.700
to make sure that citizens
had stated expectation

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.950
for what the government
could or could not do to them

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:25.430
and you can kind of see here
in many of these rights,

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.310
the legacy of the Revolutionary War

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.830
and the kinds of government abuses,

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.999
that citizens in the Colonies had feared.

00:00:33.999 --> 00:00:36.410
Now I'm going to go
over these very quickly,

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.210
we'll spend a lot more
time in other videos

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.436
talking more about these amendments,

00:00:41.436 --> 00:00:44.130
but I wanna give you an overall sense

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.630
of what they're driving at.

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.710
Now the first four amendments

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.273
guarantee individual liberties,

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.190
these are freedom of religion,
speech, press, assembly,

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.460
freedom to ask the government
for redress of grievances

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.730
or to deal with a problem,

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.530
that the government may
have caused in your life,

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.300
the right to bear arms
and assemble militias,

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.210
state and local militias had
made the Revolutionary War

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.410
a success for the United States,

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.750
a ban on quartering soldiers in homes,

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.970
recall that the Quartering Act,

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.600
when the British government
said that the Colonies

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.700
had to put up soldiers in their homes

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.910
was a major driver of revolution

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:34.770
and a ban on unreasonable
search and seizure,

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.050
that is it would be necessary

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.200
for the government to get a warrant

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.050
to enter your home or to
search your belongings.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.500
The next four amendments
in the Bill of Rights

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.203
deal with protections for
people accused of crimes

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.077
and again, you see the legacy
of the Revolutionary War

00:01:56.077 --> 00:01:59.010
and the idea that the Crown

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.374
had had too much power
to persecute individuals,

00:02:03.374 --> 00:02:08.374
so this includes things like
the right to due process,

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.200
that is to make sure that all the steps

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.040
of following the law are taken,

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.000
a ban on being tried
twice for the same crime,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.580
rights to a speedy and public trial,

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.240
a jury of your peers, to
even have a jury in cases,

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.932
that don't have to do with violent crimes,

00:02:26.932 --> 00:02:29.560
but rather civil disputes

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.080
and a ban on excessive bail

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.620
and cruel and unusual punishment,

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.000
basically this is a guarantee

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.843
that the government will respect
the rights of individuals.

00:02:41.843 --> 00:02:44.770
Now, one of the arguments made against

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.400
including a Bill of
Rights in the Constitution

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.770
was that listing out those rights

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:55.270
might then mean that
they were the only rights

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:58.656
and that by listing out
these rights in particular,

00:02:58.656 --> 00:03:03.400
they might be forfeiting
their liberties in other ways,

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.560
so the ninth and tenth amendments

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.630
attempt to deal with that worry,

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.890
they say in the ninth amendment,

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.660
any right that isn't listed here

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.270
is still retained by the people,

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.840
so this is not an exhaustive list,

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.380
this is not the complete list

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.220
of all the rights retained by the people

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:28.210
and the tenth amendment
is slightly different,

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:30.560
but kind of on the same line,

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.560
they say that if this Constitution
has not delegated a right

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.800
directly to the federal government,

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.860
then that right is reserved
to the states or the people,

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.290
so the federal government can only do

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.330
the things that are listed
in this Constitution,

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.940
it is a limited government,
limited by this document.

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.320
On the other hand, the rights
of the people are unlimited,

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.210
so if the Constitution doesn't say

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:04.250
that the federal government can do it,

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.483
that's then a right of
the states or the people.
